Her hair was fashionably styled\u00a0in big, loose curls. She had casually pulled her black hair behind one ear revealing a shiny pearl earring. On the other side, her hair was draped over her chest covering half of the matching pearl necklace. She sat in front of a huge poster with a cigarette in her slender fingers. A thin wisp of smoke rose from her exquisite fingertips.Su Mingmei didn\u2019t fit in with the excitement of the Spring Festival, but she was utterly gorgeous. Zheng Baozhu couldn\u2019t look away.Zheng Baozhu, her mind blank, stood at the door looking at Su Mingmei. Zheng Baozhu completely forgot that her grandmother had asked her to call her aunt over for dinner.Sensing someone\u2019s eyes on her, Su Mingmei turned her head. When she saw the tiny figure standing in the doorway, she smiled.Her smile was perfectly copied on the poster behind her.Su Mingmei herself was depicted on the poster. Six-year-old Zheng Baozhu heard countless adults discussing Su Mingmei, both her aunt and the most popular female celebrity.Her movie posters lined the streets as far as the eye could see. Her jewelry advertisements ran on television constantly. Her fervent fans could circle the world twice.Su Mingmei, however, committed suicide when she was just 25-years-old.Zheng Baozhu never would have imagined that her first meeting Su Mingmei would also be her final farewell.That spring was exceptionally bright and beautiful. Su Mingmei\u2019s film \u2018No More Spring\u2019 was released that season. The film described a depressed painter. After experiencing a series of twists and turns and love-hate relationships, the artist committed suicide with a toxic paint called Paris Green. After her death, the value of her artwork soared. Most notably, her last piece \u2018No More Spring\u2019 sold for an astonishing price.The painter died in spring, and so did Su Mingmei.Some people said that she couldn\u2019t land a role; others said she had a bad relationship. No matter what outsiders said, Su Mingmei had become a taboo amongst the Su and Zheng families.Even the term \u201cfemale celebrity\u201d became taboo.It was under these circumstances that Zheng Baozhu confronted the taboo head-on. She wrote the words \u201cfemale celebrity\u201d on her homework.\u201cBaozhu, Qu Zhi, how come you guys came out ten minutes late today?\u201d Zheng Baozhu\u2019s mother, Su Mingxi, had come to pick up her daughter from school. She also brought Zheng Baozhu\u2019s deskmate, Qu Zhi, home along the way. Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu lived in the same neighborhood. His parents were both involved in scientific research. When they got busy, they asked their neighbor, Su Mingxi, to take care of their son.Qu Zhi was a boy, but he was handsome and smart. Su Mingxi liked him very much.Qu Zhi raised his head to answer Su Mingxi\u2019s question, \u201cToday\u2019s last class was composition class. Teacher Zhang has asked us to write an essay. We can\u2019t leave school until we finish writing.\u2019\u2019\u201cOh, I see.\u201d Su Mingxi held Zheng Baozhu\u2019s hand in her left and Qu Zhi\u2019s in her right as they walked toward the parking spot. \u201cWhat\u2019s the topic of the essay?\u201dQu Zhi said, \u201d\u300a My Dream \u300b.\u201dSu Mingxi asked curiously, \u201cWhat did you write, Qu Zhi?\u201d\u201cScientist,\u201d he said as he straightened his back. He looked as neat as the words written on his assignment. \u201cI want to become a scientist and contribute to the development of my country just like my parents.\u201dOn the other side, Zheng Baozhu rolled her eyes and snorted internally.Other children, especially Zheng Baozhu, were na\u00efve and cute when they spoke. Not Qu Zhi. He really knew how to speak beautiful words.Su Mingxi was very happy. After praising Qu Zhi, she turned around and asked, \u201cWhat did you write, Baozhu?\u201d\u201cMe? I\u2026\u201d\u201cZheng Baozhu wrote about becoming an actress.\u201d Zheng Baozhu had only just opened her mouth when Qu Zhi replied. \u201cI saw it.\u201dZheng Baozhu clearly felt the hand around hers tighten.Her hand ached with the increased pressure. Before she could squeeze out a few tears to gain sympathy, Su Mingxi looked at her with raised eyebrows. \u201cZheng Baozhu! You still want to be a female celebrity?\u201dThe shocked Zheng Baozhu reflexively yanked her hand away and ran off. Su Mingxi chased and cursed after her, \u201cDo you want to be a female celebrity? I\u2019ll beat you to death today!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t! Qu Zhi is talking nonsense!\u201d Zheng Baozhu was making a scene at the school gate. None of the parents passing by extended a helping hand to her. Instead, they giggled as they watched. Qu Zhi also watched from the side. He looked like a righteous messenger. \u201cI didn\u2019t speak nonsense. Auntie Su, you will know if you ask Teacher Zhang.\u201d\u201cGood, you even learned to lie!\u201d Su Mingxi caught Zheng Baozhu and scolded,\u201d You\u2019re getting bolder and bolder. You have been spoiled! You want to become a female celebrity? Do you dare tell your grandparents?\u201d\u201cWaaah!\u201d Despite her wailing, Zheng Baozhu did not forget to scold Qu Zhi. \u201cDoggy Qu Zhi! I, Zheng Baozhu, will never forgive you for this!\u201dPerhaps it was these words that woke Zheng Baozhu from her sleep.The phone on the bedside table was still vibrating. She reached out to silence the alarm and sat up.Heavens, had she actually dreamt about\u2026Qu Zhi?Pei 2the sound of spitting due to anger ! How unlucky!She put on her slippers and pulled open the curtains to her French windows. Rays of bright sunlight poured into the room. She ran her fingers through her long hair as she ran her fingers through her long hair. Standing in front of the window, Zheng Baozhu stretched her arms. Turning her head, she saw an essay on the wall.This was the essay she had written when she was in third grade, but her mother had torn it to pieces. This did not deter little Zheng Baozhu. She used her tenacious willpower to continue fighting. She taped it back together and kept the essay to this day.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I want to be like her. I want to wear the most fashionable big wavy curls, wear the brightest earrings and necklaces, and have the most beautiful nails. I also want to act like my little aunt. I want everyone to watch my movies. The mall will have to put my poster where everyone can see it. They will say, \u2018Wow, it\u2019s Zheng Baozhu. She\u2019s so beautiful!\u2019 I hope that one day I will be as bright as my aunt and my whole body will shine!\u201dAt the bottom of the composition was the comment that the teacher had written for her.\u201cBeing a celebrity isn\u2019t just about looking bright and beautiful on the surface. They also suffer from the hardships of filming. We can\u2019t just consider their bright side. We also need to understand the hard work and significance of their job. I hope that in the future when Baozhu experiences setbacks, she won\u2019t give up lightly. That way she can one day become a shining female star.\u00a0Jiayou!\u201dIt was very moving, but she only managed a modest B-.Hm .She remembered that Qu Zhi received an A+ on his composition.Qu Zhi\u2019s grades had been very good ever since he was young. After graduating from high school, he naturally went to study abroad and exited Zheng Baozhu\u2019s life. Ever since he left, she felt that her life had begun to reach its peak.Although she did not manage to apply for the film academy after graduation, she had an exceptional talent for business. Or was it her luck? Ever since college, she had been making money whenever she wanted. It had been such smooth sailing that her business continuously grew.However, her dream of being a female celebrity had not changed even to this day. In the third semester of her senior year, she secretly set a small goal for herself. Once she earned fifteen million dollars, she would pursue her dream without her family\u2019s knowledge!She was about to take her first step toward this great dream!Zheng Baozhu knew that her age, 25 years and 1 month, would make it difficult to enter the entertainment industry. Especially now that the debut age was getting younger and younger. However, it did not matter. She did not intend to be an idol anyways. In her aunt Su Mingmei\u2019s era, a lot of superstars had started out with walk-on parts. She wanted to try it out.Zheng Baozhu was not from an academic class. She had only studied acting for a few months with her teacher. By doing this, she could hone her acting skills while keeping it completely hidden from her family. This way she could enter the entertainment industry with the least commotion.Today, she had gotten up early to go to the film studio complex and get to know the market.Zheng Baozhu took a shower first. Then, she dried her hair and stepped into her walk-in closet. Clothes, shoes bags, accessories, and anything else you could wear filled her giant closet. She even made a personal stage to show off her favorite gold gown.\u201cToday\u2019s lucky color is green\u2026\u201d Zheng Baozhu picked a French-style sharp-necked jacket and paired it with a vintage green skirt. Before she turned off the app1probably she was browsing weibo for today\u2019s fortune, she caught a glimpse of \u201cToday\u2019s Star Language\u201d at the top.\u201cAre you looking forward to the reunion?\u201dZheng Baozhu raised her slender eyebrows, closed the app, and went downstairs to eat.Currently, City A was vigorously developing its southern blocks. The construction of Starlight Park and Starlight Farm had brought a lot of popularity to the area. Zheng Baozhu\u2019s Garden Wind Hotel was a popular accommodation in Starlight Farm. Although it was not comparable to a five-star hotel in the public center, it attracted many tourists.Zheng Baozhu was staying at her hotel. She ate three meals a day in the kitchen. The hotel had a cafeteria and a Chinese restaurant. Guests could eat both pizza and steak as well as farmhouse stir fry.\u00a0When Liang Huihui saw her come down, she quickly brought breakfast to Zheng Baozhu\u2019s table. \u201cMiss Baozhu, your breakfast!\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Zheng Baozhu smiled at her and thanked her. She picked up the spoon with her hand somehow enhancing her already exquisite beauty.Today, Liang Huihui was still struck by that beauty. She stood next to Zheng Baozhu and said, \u201cMiss Baozhu, I heard that the Science Park will have a new company today. It\u2019s an artificial intelligence company.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Zheng Baozhu nodded her head. The science and technology park was another key project for the government in the development of the area. Construction had only been completed at the beginning of the year. The result was a beautiful park that a number of technology companies had entered.Liang Huihui asked, \u201cIs artificial intelligence just a robot?\u201d\u201cMore or less.\u201dLiang Huihui suddenly wore a strange expression. \u201cI saw it on the news before. There are already robots in hotels and restaurants in China. They\u2019re studying this. Are they here to steal our jobs?\u201dZheng Baozhu finally understood why she was gossiping today. So she was worried about losing her job? She chuckled at Liang Huihui\u2019s thoughts and looked up at her. \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026that won\u2019t do. A robot doesn\u2019t have feelings!\u201dZheng Baozhu smiled, \u201cAlright, robots can\u2019t completely replace humans in a short period of time.\u201dLiang Huihui felt relieved when she heard that. She put away her plate and walked a few steps before turning around to add, \u201cCould a robot greet customers with a smile like I can?\u201dAs she said that, Liang Huihui revealed the most brilliant smile of her life featuring two white front teeth.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Zheng Baozhu was swayed by her smile. Huihui had given it her all in order not to lose her job.Because of the threat to their jobs, everyone had a prejudice against this new technology company. Zheng Baozhu heard them whispering and smiled as she opened Weibo.Zheng Baozhu would log on to Weibo every day to learn about the entertainment industry she hoped to enter. The first thing to do was to look at the hot search.Apart from the familiar names and a few pieces of political news, one topic stood out to her\u2014\u201cHow high could an ordinary person\u2019s looks be?\u201dZheng Baozhu entered excitedly.\u201cYan Xinglian is the most attractive #How impressive could a normal person\u2019s look be? #Come, come, come, let\u2019s post the most handsome amateur guy you\u2019ve seen!\u201dThe hot reviews were all handsome photos, but the most eye-catching one was definitely Hot One. After all, he was a man who relied on half of his face to win a few praises from Hot Two!\u201cEveryone, move aside! This was what I saw at the airport in the morning. A real handsome guy could turn people upside down with just half a face! [Picture]\u201dThe man in the picture was wearing a mask. His short, soft, black hair was lazily styled. However, the pair of eyes looking at the camera were striking.Zheng Baozhu\u2019s heart skipped a beat when she saw this. His masculine energy was almost tangible, even through the screen.The hint of displeasure in his eyes indicated he may have noticed the person secretly photographing him. Although the mask covered the lower half of his face, she could recognize his superior bone structure.\u201cHoly shit, he\u2019s so handsome. I declare that he\u2019s today\u2019s champion!\u201d\u201cAh, the handsome guy\u2019s eyes are too fierce. He\u2019s shooting my heart through the camera!\u201d\u201cHubby!!!!!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just leave a chicken coop here[doge].\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t allow this kind of fish to escape the entertainment industry. Handsome guy, debut!\u201d\u201cA City International Airport? I was at the airport in the morning, but I missed the handsome guy?!![vomiting blood]\u201dZheng Baozhu stretched her chin and frowned as she stared at the man on her phone. A strange feeling was creeping over her.Am I being haunted? Why does this person resemble Qu Zhi the more I look?The author had something to say.Zheng Baozhu: My peak of life seems to be on the verge of collapse.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng Baozhu feared that the man who looked like Qu Zhi would plague her. She quickly minimized the photo and exited Weibo.After she finished breakfast, she called a car to the film studio complex.The middle-aged driver\u2019s hairline was already in danger. When Zheng Baozhu entered the car, he was arranging his precious remaining locks in the rearview mirror.The two simply verified the other\u2019s identity before departing.Though the Film and Television City in City A was not the largest nor the most famous in China, it was close to Zheng Baozhu\u2019s residence. Additionally, the high-speed ways made for a smooth ride.The driver also enjoyed the free-running speed, so he put on some music for his own enjoyment.The radio station he selected was currently playing Su Mingmei\u2019s \u201cFirst Love \u201c.It was the interlude of the movie \u201cSpring Day No More \u201c. When the male and female protagonists first met, this was the background music. \u2018First Love\u2019 had been one of the best songs of the year. It won countless awards and echoes through every street and alley. Not even Su Mingmei\u2019s suicide affected its popularity.Nearly twenty years later, her songs still played on the radio.\u201c\u2026 secretly looking up, does it feel like first love?\u201d Zheng Baozhu hummed softly to the music flowing from the speakers. The driver looked in the rearview mirror and said, \u201cYoung Miss, do you also like Su Mingmei\u2019s song?\u201dZheng Baozhu smiled and said, \u201cYeah, this song is very famous.\u201d\u201cThat it is.\u201d The topic made the driver even more energetic. \u201cIn those days, Su Mingmei was popular all over the country. From toddlers to grown women, all of them were her fans.\u201dZheng Baozhu smiled and asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t that an exaggeration?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not exaggerating at all. Back then my first girlfriend broke up with me because of Su Mingmei!\u201d\u201cOh? Was it because you liked Su Mingmei so much that your girlfriend got jealous?\u201d\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t. It was impossible for the two of us to get access to Su Mingmei\u2019s meeting, but one of us managed to secure a ticket\u2026\u201d The driver was a little smug. \u201cThankfully, I was the lucky one.\u201dZheng Baozhu, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSir, it seems you won the battle but lost the war.\u201cAlas, it\u2019s a pity that such a beauty lived such a short life. Why do you think she didn\u2019t just take a moment before committing suicide?\u201d When the driver said this, he could not but shake his head and sigh.Zheng Baozhu did not say anything else. The driver looked at her from the rearview mirror and exclaimed, \u201cYoung Miss, you\u2019re going to the film studio. Are you a celebrity?\u201d\u201cNot at all,\u201d Zheng Baozhu shook her head. \u201cI haven\u2019t even dipped my toe in the water yet. I just want to broaden my horizons first.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you can. Has anyone ever told you that you look like Su Mingmei?\u201dZheng Baozhu pretended to be embarrassed and covered her mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people say that before.\u201d\u201cRight! When you got in the car, I thought you looked familiar!\u201d After receiving a positive reply, the driver became even more excited. \u201cLook at your face! The more I look, the more you look like Su Mingmei!\u201d\u201cReally? Hahaha!\u201dThe driver continued chatting with Zheng Baozhu. When he sent her off, he even patted his chest and promised that she would become popular in the future.Having been showered in the driver\u2019s compliments, there was no way Zheng Baozhu would be able to haggle the fare.After getting out of the car, Zheng Baozhu went to take a look at her rented house. Although she did not plan to live here, she could stay the night if she ended up on a set that finished work late. The houses around the film studio complex were average. Zheng Baozhu had chosen the most expensive one, but it just barely satisfied her. She had asked the landlord to help her replace all the daily necessities in the room. After seeing that everything was in order, she went to the actors\u2019 union to get an actor\u2019s pass.It was not difficult to get an actor\u2019s pass. All she had to do was take a general knowledge exam and complete a short training session. After Zheng Baozhu received the actor\u2019s pass, she was added to a notification group with administrators. Whenever a crew needed actors for performances, management would post an announcement.The announcements were usually sent in advance. The news in the group was from the previous day. Since she was already here, Zheng Baozhu decided to go to the actor service department. She heard that they could \u201cpick up pigeons\u201d there.She had heard the phrase \u201cpick up a pigeon\u201d from a more experienced group when she was applying for her pass. If someone left a set crew, you would have a chance to \u201cpick up a pigeon\u201d and become a substitute.There were many people in the service department, young and old. When Zheng Baozhu began to approach, everyone looked at her. She pretended to fix her hair and stood outside.After standing for less than two minutes, a big, sturdy brother rushed over. He was stunned when he saw Zheng Baozhu at the door. He hesitated for a few seconds before he came forward to talk to her. \u201cSister, are you also here to act?\u201dZheng Baozhu nodded.\u201d Yeah.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. I have a few spots to fill. Come with me later,\u201d He said to her. Then, shouted into the room, \u201cFive group performances! Both men and women can do it!\u201dEveryone quickly gathered together. Zheng Baozhu followed the rest of the team into the crew van. Zheng Baozhu felt the excitement building inside her. Her brother was also very curious about her. Looking at Zheng Baozhu beside him, he could not help but ask, \u201cSister, you would have no trouble being an internet celebrity these days. Why did you choose to be a group actor here?\u201dZheng Baozhu said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be an Internet celebrity. I want to be a serious actor.\u201dThe elder brother smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be a group performer, and it\u2019s hard to get ahead. You see, so many people come and go here every day. Who didn\u2019t come with a dream at the beginning? But after a long time, they either give up or become a bully in the crew.\u201dZheng Baozhu looked at him with a smile. \u201cBig Brother, this is my first time here. Don\u2019t pour cold water on me.\u201dThe eldest brother also laughed, \u201cOK, you\u2019ll perform as a prospect in the foreground later. Do you know what this entails?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d During the training session, Zheng Baozhu listened to her teacher\u2019s lecture. The group performances were divided into different grades. The \u201ccrowd\u201d was the most ordinary. The better part was the \u201cprospects\u201d. The best part was the \u201cspecial arrangement\u201d. This big brother was talking about the role of \u201cprospect\u201d standing at the front of the scene. A prospect could appear in special shots and even have lines, not to mention a relatively higher salary. These roles also had requirements for the appearance and height of the actors.Scoring a prospect role was no easy task. Zheng Baozhu had not found just pigeons, but a prospect. She was feeling quite lucky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe car stopped at the end of a street that looked straight out of the early twentieth century. During the drive to set, the elder brother had already explained that this was a spy film from the Republic of China. Today, they would be acting as passers-by on the street. Zheng Baozhu went to costume design to get her attire. It was a red cheongsam. After Zheng Baozhu put it on, the costume designer could not help but look at her a few more times.The costumes for the group show were very ordinary. Many people had worn this particular red cheongsam before, and it had seemed mediocre in both quality and price. Now that Zheng Baozhu had adorned it, however, she felt that the cheongsam had become expensive. It was as if it had been tailor-made for the daughter of a wealthy family.Her styling complete, Zheng Baozhu waited for the director to send someone over so that they could start filming. Seeing Zheng Baozhu, the director pulled Little Gao beside him and asked, \u201cWhere did you find this girl?\u201dLittle Gao said, \u201cShe came with the group from the service department.\u201dThe director patted him on the shoulder, \u201cThis girl isn\u2019t bad. I even suspect that her costume doesn\u2019t belong to our crew.\u201d\u201cWell, who said otherwise? I saw her at the door of the service department. I\u2019m not sure if she came to be a group performer.\u201d The clothes she had been wearing were particularly exquisite. He assumed that this was the daughter of a rich family aiming to experience life.\u201cIf you look closely, do you get the sense that her charm is similar to Su Mingmei\u2019s?\u201dHearing what he said, Little Gao nodded. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d\u201cBut she looks a little brighter than Su Mingmei.\u201d The beauty of that era always carried an air of melancholy. \u201cMiss! Yes, you. Come here for your directions.\u201d The director waved to Zheng Baozhu and called her over. \u201cYou will perform in the foreground of our scene later. Just stand in front of the booth and look around. Then take something and ask the boss how much it is. Do you understand?\u201dZheng Baozhu nodded. \u201cUnderstood!\u201dZheng Baozhu stood in the designated spot from which this set of scenes would be shot. Then, the female lead walked out of the cafe and past Zheng Baozhu. When the female lead came, Zheng Baozhu turned her head to take a look. The lead was also wearing a cheongsam, but it was obviously much more exquisite than Zheng Baozhu\u2019s. The female lead appeared to be a popular singer, but she was actually a liaison within her party.The female lead happened to catch Zheng Baozhu looking at her. The lead frowned.\u201cWhere did you get these actors?\u201d the female lead asked, her voice dripping with disdain. \u201cHow did someone so ugly manage to be cast as a prospect?\u201dZheng Baozhu, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe set fell silent for a second. Then the man who had brought Zheng Bauzhu, Xiao Gao, weakly asked, \u201cHer? Would you call her ugly?\u201d\u201cOf course! Don\u2019t you have eyes?\u201dAfter being called ugly again, Zheng Baozhu could not stay quiet. \u201cEnough is enough! Don\u2019t open your mouth. This behavior is disgraceful. You are also a woman. I don\u2019t want to scold you, but you can\u2019t just come in here and humiliate another person based on her appearance.\u201dThe female lead scoffed. \u201cHumiliate? What? I can\u2019t speak the truth now?\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201d Cheng Baozhu\u2019s temper flared. \u201cIsn\u2019t Sun Jing the best at covering others\u2019 mouths? Don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t recognize you just because you\u2019re in a different style. Aren\u2019t you the one who sued netizens on Weibo? The audience can\u2019t mention your bad acting?\u201d\u201cYou! Who are you calling bad at acting?!\u201d Afraid that others might question her acting skills, Sun Jing raised her voice eight degrees. \u201cDirector Liu, if you guys use this acting group, I won\u2019t act anymore!\u201d\u201cCalm down, calm down. Let\u2019s change people.\u201d The director wanted to defuse the situation, so he had no choice but to change Zheng Baozhu. \u201cXiao Gao, quickly take her to return her costume and find someone else.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you guys to take me. I\u2019ll go myself!\u201d retorted Zheng Baozhu with bitterness in her heart and simply turned to leave.After Zheng Baozhu left, the scene quickly returned to normal. The director looked at Xiao Gao next to him and grumbled in a low voice, \u201cAre you trying to stir up trouble by finding such a beautiful group act? Will the audience be watching the female lead or watching her?\u201dXiao Gao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDirector, that\u2019s not what you said just now.\u201cThen what kind should I be looking for?\u201d Sun Jing\u2019s actions put Xiao Gao in an impossible situation.The director said, \u201cAre you simple? Find someone who looks good but not better than Sun Jing. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cGot it. Got it.\u201dXiao Gao went to scout more group performers again. On the way, he saw Zheng Baozhu rushing away ahead of him. He shouted to her, \u201cHey, Miss. I\u2019m sorry about what happened today.\u201dZheng Baozhu looked back at him and said, \u201cIt has nothing to do with you. It\u2019s just my bad luck.\u201dAnd she had thought that her luck had finally turned. Misfortune had just been waiting for her here!Xiao Gao felt a little apologetic. He took out his phone and said, \u201cHow about this? I\u2019ll send you the group for prospects. You can join yourself. You\u2019ll find regular announcements there.\u201d\u201cOkay, thank you, brother.\u201d Zheng Baozhu took out her mobile phone and scanned the QR code of the group. Xiao Gao sent a message to the administrator so that Zheng Baozhu could enter the group. He asked Zheng Baozhu to wait saying, \u201cHe\u2019ll approve you once he sees it. Just know, prospect positions are competitive, so you have to move quickly.\u201d\u201cOh, oh, okay.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll head out with you. You\u2019ll have to walk by yourself for a while.\u201d\u201cThank you, Big Brother.\u201dAfter leaving the set, Zheng Baozhu called for a car and returned to Starlight Farm.I\u2019ve been busy all day but, in the end, it was for nothing. Well, it wasn\u2019t completely fruitless. At least I joined the prospect group.Zheng Baozhu comforted herself. When she entered the hotel, she saw the back of a tall man at the front desk checking in.The windbreaker looked familiar.\u201cMiss Baozhu, you\u2019re back!\u201d Seeing her, Xiao Yu called out excitedly, \u201cThis gentleman is your friend!\u201d\u201cMy friend? \u201cZheng Baozhu looked at the back of this man\u2019s head in confusion.He turned around and happened to meet her gaze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe High-End Talent Community associated with the Science and Technology Park will officially open for sale this Saturday. Zheng Baozhu has been paying attention to this property since its construction started. Unlike many developers who start pre-selling as soon as the buildings reach ground level, this property waited until the roof was completed before preparing for the opening.The houses in the High-End Talent Community were all beautifully designed and had spacious layouts. Zheng Baozhu watched as they were gradually constructed, and now that the opening is approaching, she felt like she must go and join in the excitement. The sales office for the property was also completed in the past two months, and it could be seen that people occasionally went there for inquiries. The location of the sales office is near Starlight Park. Zheng Baozhu changed into flat shoes, started the car smoothly from the garage, and drove out like a sparkling ruby.Since today was not the official opening day, there weren't many people at the sales office. After parking her car, Zheng Baozhu changed back into high heels and carried her bag as she walked out.The nearest salesperson at the entrance greeted her, \"Hello, how may I assist you, Miss?\"Zheng Baozhu glanced at the person who appeared to be around her age, dressed in a uniform with neatly tied-up hair, giving off a capable and professional aura. She smiled and stopped, saying, \"I heard that the opening is scheduled for this Saturday, I'm here to learn more about the property.\"Curious, she looked towards the center of the sales office where the sand table was located. Seeing her interest, the salesperson directly led her there.In addition to the informal name [High-End Talent Community], this property also had an official name, Jin Yu Man Tang1. Zheng Baozhu thought the name was cleverly chosen. It not only conveys the abundance of knowledge but also suggests immense wealth.It sounded bright and shiny, and she liked it.The community was beautifully constructed. Based on what she saw from the sand table, there were a total of twelve buildings arranged with careful consideration, ensuring that no building blocked another, and the spacing between them was generous, with a low plot ratio. Most importantly, the location of this property was exceptional, adjacent to Starlight Park. Standing on the high-level platform, one could view a large part of Starlight Park.It was clear that the government was truly determined to attract talent.\"I heard that an invitation letter is required now for eligibility to purchase, is that correct?\" Zheng Baozhu asked, finding it interesting that while other properties were based on lottery numbers, this one relied on educational qualifications.Who says studying is useless?The salesperson nodded and explained, \"The first phase is mainly open to individuals who meet the high-end talent policy requirements. However, we will have a second phase later, which will be available to the general public. If you're interested, you can register with us, and we will notify you when there's further information.\"\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu pondered for a moment and nodded, \"So there's a second phase as well? But isn't the second phase just what others have left behind?\"The salesperson smiled and said, \"It's not accurate to put it that way. Buying a house is like choosing between radishes and greens; everyone has their preferences. What others like may not necessarily be what you like. The key is to find what suits you, don't you agree?\"Zheng Baozhu blinked, \"You truly live up to being a property consultant. You have excellent eloquence. I envy your boss for having an employee like you.\"\"You're too kind,\" the salesperson modestly replied and invited her to sit on the nearby sofa, \"Please fill out this form.\"\"Alright,\" Zheng Baozhu took the pen and began filling out the information. In addition to basic details, the form also required occupation and annual income. It was only missing a bank statement.\"Um, may I ask, is this form subject to review?\" Zheng Baozhu raised her gaze and looked at the salesperson beside her, \"Is qualification for purchasing the second phase contingent on passing the review?\"The salesperson smiled and said, \"We are simply gathering basic information about our customers and, of course, conducting a simple screening. After all, the residents here are of a higher level. Like entrepreneurs such as yourself, you certainly have the qualifications.\"Zheng Baozhu liked the title \"entrepreneur\" given to her by the sales consultant. After completing the form and receiving a copy of the property information, she left the sales office in her car. When she returned to the hotel, she realized it was almost lunchtime, so she went directly to the restaurant. During peak hours, the hotel would deliver two dishes to her room, but during the low season, she preferred to dine in person.As she entered the Chinese restaurant, Zheng Baozhu chose a seat by the window. This row of seats by the floor-to-ceiling windows was adjacent to the hotel garden, which was meticulously maintained throughout the year, creating a beautiful landscape. Usually, these seats needed to be reserved in advance, even for Zheng Baozhu, who visited the restaurant only a few times a year.Shortly after the dishes she ordered arrived, Qu Zhi and Qi Sheng also walked in.They came for lunch. Although they could order takeout in the Science and Technology Park, Qi Sheng had heard that the farmhouse stir-fry at Zheng Baozhu's hotel was famous, so he persuaded Qu Zhi to come over for lunch.\"I see that you're not here for the stir-fry; you just want to meet Zheng Baozhu, don't you?\" Qu Zhi saw through Qi Sheng's little scheme.\"I want both, of course.\" Qi Sheng looked at Qu Zhi with a smile, \"I did some research. This restaurant is only open to the public during the off-peak season. If it were the regular season, you wouldn't be able to eat here even if you wanted to.\"What Qi Sheng said was true. The Chinese restaurant in Zheng Baozhu's hotel was popular. Normally, they were busy accommodating tour groups and hotel guests, so they didn't accept other individual orders. During the off-peak season, the restaurant wasn't as busy and would be open to the public, but most customers preferred takeout, and only a few came to dine in person.After hearing Qi Sheng's words, Qu Zhi looked at him and chuckled, \"I live here, so I could just come down to eat by using my room key.\"Qi Sheng: \"...\"F**k! He fell into his trap again.\"Mr. Qu, are you here for lunch?\" Liang Huihui noticed Qu Zhi entering and warmly greeted him, \"Is this your friend?\"\"Yes, that's right. Hello,\" Qi Sheng greeted Liang Huihui in a casual manner, then turned his head and saw Zheng Baozhu sitting by the window.\"Qu Zhi!\" He quickly grabbed Qu Zhi, his eyes fixed on Zheng Baozhu's direction with excitement, \"Is that the beautiful Zheng Baozhu sitting by the window?\"Qu Zhi followed his gaze and also saw Zheng Baozhu. She was dressed the same as in the morning, with her hair pinned to the left side, shining pearl earrings dangling from her ears, and her hairpin and sparkling diamond on her fingertips, creating a brilliant and dazzling appearance.Qu Zhi even felt that she deliberately chose to sit by the window to let her hairpin and nails catch the light and shine even more.\"Yes, she is,\" he replied nonchalantly to Qi Sheng, then said to the nearby Liang Huihui, \"Isn't she easily recognizable? Doesn't she look exactly like 'Xiu Xiu'?\"Qi Sheng: \"...\"Something seemed off, yet nothing seemed wrong.Liang Huihui was also puzzled for a moment, \"Xiu Xiu? Is that the magical character from the movie?\"Perhaps sensing their gaze, Zheng Baozhu also looked up and noticed Qu Zhi standing at the entrance. He was accompanied by another person, slightly shorter but fair-looking. Judging by the employee ID card hanging around his neck, he should be Qu Zhi's colleague.Qi Sheng pulled Qu Zhi over and approached them. As they got closer, Qi Sheng found Zheng Baozhu even more radiant, \"Hello, you must be Qu Zhi's childhood friend Zheng Baozhu, right? You are indeed as beautiful as he described!\"Zheng Baozhu initially wanted to refute the term \"childhood friend\", but she realized the biggest glaring point in his statement was elsewhere, \"What? He complimented me for being beautiful?\" Zheng Baozhu glanced at Qu Zhi, who stood beside her, \"Why do I find it hard to believe?\"Qu Zhi glanced at Qi Sheng and told Zheng Baozhu, \"Because my original comment was 'all show and no substance'.\"Qi Sheng: \"...\"Qi Sheng felt that Qu Zhi's attractive face was the only reason he could survive to this age.Fortunately, Zheng Baozhu didn't confront them on the spot. She simply nodded gently, understanding the situation, and replied, \"Oh, so he did indeed compliment my appearance.\"\"...Right!\" Qi Sheng suddenly felt relieved and casually sat down across from Zheng Baozhu, \"I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Qu Zhi's colleague, Qi Sheng.\"Zheng Baozhu praised, \"A victorious start, a good name.\"\"You're praising me too much,\" Qi Sheng chuckled innocently, \"It's because my father's surname is Qi and my mother's surname is Sheng.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"This is what they mean by \"high-quality ingredients often only need simple cooking methods\", right?\"By the way, since we've bumped into each other, can we eat together?\" Qi Sheng asked with a beaming smile.Zheng Baozhu glanced at Qu Zhi and nodded, saying, \"Sure, but the dishes I ordered may not be enough. You can order a few more that you like.\"\"Got it!\" Qi Sheng pulled Qu Zhi, who was still standing there, to sit down. Liang Huihui handed them the menu. Qi Sheng ordered several signature dishes and eagerly waited to eat.On the opposite side, Zheng Baozhu seemed to remember something and hesitated before mentioning, \"Tong Tong said she wants to organize a welcoming dinner for you. It will be held here. Do you have time tonight?\"Cen Tongtong is a mutual friend of Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi. The three of them lived in the same residential complex when they grew up. Although Cen Tongtong didn't attend the same school as Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi attended, they still grew up together as childhood friends.Tongtong had mentioned the dinner to Qu Zhi earlier in the morning, but Qu Zhi was busy at the time and didn't reply.After thinking for a moment, Qu Zhi nodded and said, \"I can make it.\"\"Great, I'll let her know then,\" Zheng Baozhu scooped a few spoonfuls of soup into her small bowl, \"Meng Yaxin also knows about this. She will come tonight as well.\"\"Meng Yaxin?\" Qu Zhi looked up at Zheng Baozhu. Meng Yaxin was their high school classmate and was close to Zheng Baozhu during their studies, \"You and Meng Yaxin are still in touch?\"\"Good friends?\" Qu Zhi chuckled and looked at Zheng Baozhu, \"Does Meng Yaxin knows you're friends with her because she has three 'jins'2\u00a0in her name?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"............\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Zheng Baozhu was in high school, for the college entrance examination preparation, the school divided students into arts and sciences. In\u00a0their sophomore year, during the division of arts and sciences, Zheng Baozhu unfortunately ended up in the same class as Qu Zhi and they became deskmates.The first class was the self-introduction session. Due to the heavy workload, the teacher allowed everyone to stay in their seats and casually say a few words in introducing themselves. The classmates' introductions were indeed casual, basically just stating their names and quickly sitting down.In her mind, Zheng Baozhu rehearsed how she would introduce herself when Meng Yaxin stood up to introduce herself.\"Hello, everyone. I'm Meng Yaxin. 'Meng' from Mengzi, 'ya' meaning elegance, and 'xin' representing three 'jins'.\"Zheng Baozhu's eyes lit up and she looked towards Meng Yaxin. She was a clean-looking girl with a high ponytail and a smiling face. This type of appearance was common on the high school campus, but in Zheng Baozhu's eyes, she radiated a unique charm that others lacked.\"Three 'jin's'? That's a good choice of characters, it sounds prestigious,\" Zheng Baozhu whispered in admiration, \"It shines just like my name, Zheng Baozhu.\"Qu Zhi, who was sitting beside her, rolled his eyes discreetly.Meng Yaxin finished her introduction and sat down. Zheng Baozhu's gaze remained on her, \"Meng Yaxin, Zheng Baozhu, we are destined to be friends.\"Qu Zhi sneered mockingly.Accustomed to his strange behavior, Zheng Baozhu didn't want to pay him any attention. After class, she approached Meng Yaxin and they became friends. Zheng Baozhu was beautiful and persuasive. In today's terms, she had that \"social influence\". Meng Yaxin quickly became good friends with her, and their relationship had lasted until today.But there were some things Qu Zhi couldn't simply say.\"What do you mean three 'jins' in her name?\" Zheng Baozhu coldly snorted, looking at Qu Zhi, \"I wanted to be friends because we have a connection.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi sneered in disdain, \"Could it be that your friendship is based on the three 'jin's' and the word 'baozhu'1?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu stubbornly raised her eyebrows, \"Don't try to sow discord between us innocent children. It's pointless.\"Qu Zhi arrogantly smirked, \"Plastic friends like you don't need my interference.\"\"Aiyah, some people can't find friends themselves, so they criticize other people's friendships as plastic,\" Zheng Baozhu picked up a piece of cold cucumber and took a bite, \"Hiss, so sour.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Afraid that the two would start fighting like children, Qi\u00a0Sheng quickly intervened, \"Oh! Is this the information for the High-End Talent Community?\"He grabbed the property information booklet next to Zheng Baozhu as if it were a lifeline, attempting to shift everyone's attention, \"Miss Baozhu, are you also interested in buying a house here?\"Qu Zhi raised an eyebrow and turned to look at him, \"Miss Baozhu?\"Qi\u00a0Sheng said, \"That's what the waiter just called her.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"It was hard to believe that this person actually worked at the same company as him.Zheng Baozhu didn't think there was anything wrong with it and started chatting with Qi Sheng, \"Yeah, the grand opening is this Saturday, right? I went to the sales office this morning to get some information.\"\"Oh, really? I'm also going on Saturday with Old Qu!\" Qi Sheng happily envisioned the future, \"If you also buy a house there, won't we all be neighbors in the future!?\"\"...\"Hearing his words, Zheng Baozhu suddenly didn't feel like buying a house there anymore, \"Do you both have invitation letters?\"Qi Sheng nodded, \"Yes.\"Zheng Baozhu blinked, showing some curiosity, \"If you guys buy houses there, does the government provide subsidies?\"\"Yes, the current policies are quite favorable.\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him enviously and leaned slightly toward him, \"Mr. Qi, do you have any friends?\"Qi Sheng, who was always easygoing, blushed at being asked such a question, \"No, I don't have any...\" he stammered a bit and looked at the overly beautiful face in front of him, \"Miss Baozhu, do you have any thoughts?\"Zheng Baozhu smiled at him and said, \"I was thinking, if you don't have any friends, would it be convenient for you to bring me along on Saturday? I also want to see the houses.\"\"...\"Qi Sheng realized what she meant and felt that he had overthought it. :)\"There's no inconvenience with that,\" Qi Sheng replied, pretending to be cheerful, trying to hide his slight embarrassment. Qu Zhi, sitting next to him, let out a faint chuckle. The sound was quiet, but it sounded like thunder in Qi Sheng's ears....He must have seen through his little thoughts!Fortunately, Zheng Baozhu didn't catch on and thanked him with a smile, \"Thank you. I went to the sales office today to register. They said they would call me when the second phase opens, but I still want to go on Saturday to join in the excitement.\"\"Oh, that's no problem. Don't be so polite with me,\" Qi Sheng laughed twice, trying to brush off the matter. Throughout the meal, he and Zheng Baozhu were almost the only ones chatting. Qu Zhi didn't speak much. During the meal, Qi Sheng added Zheng Baozhu's WeChat.On the way back to the technology park, Qi Sheng complained to Qu Zhi, \"Old Qu, you said Miss Baozhu doesn't have any thoughts or soul, but I find her much more interesting than you.\"Qu Zhi replied indifferently, \"Hmm, it seems like you two do have similar tastes.\"\"...\"Qi Sheng clicked his tongue a few times, \"I suddenly feel like being friends with you is an act of charity. I'm such a good person.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"\"No wonder Miss Baozhu prefers to ask me for help rather than go with you to see the houses.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi paused for a moment, then turned his head to look at Qi Sheng, \"What data did you ask me to check this morning? Why don't you ask the \"interesting\" Zheng Baozhu instead?\"\"...\"Qi Sheng looked at his fast-walking figure and caught up with him, \"Hey, don't be so petty. I was just joking with you.\"Qu Zhi kept walking without stopping and replied casually, \"Being your colleague is truly an act of charity. I'm such a good person.\"\"...\"Qi Sheng thought, with this personality, it was definitely Qu Zhi's problem that he and Zheng Baozhu were not compatible. :)In the evening, Cen Tongtong had reserved a private room at Zheng Baozhu's place and ordered a table full of dishes to warmly welcome Qu Zhi's return to the country. Zheng Baozhu originally didn't want to go, but Cen Tongtong personally came upstairs to convince her, so she changed into a different outfit and went downstairs.When she pushed open the door to the private room, she found that Qu Zhi and Meng Yaxin were already there, and Qi Sheng, whom she had just met at noon, was also inside.Zheng Baozhu wore a light purple embroidered sweater with a large collar, paired with a black skirt of the same embroidered craftsmanship. The style was simple, but the embroidery was delicately embellished with fine golden thread, giving it a low-key yet luxurious look.As soon as Qi Sheng saw this, an image of sniffing flashed in his mind.2He quickly deleted the image from his mind and greeted Zheng Baozhu with a smile, \"Miss Baozhu, nice to see you again. Do you mind if I join you for dinner?\"\"I don't mind, anyway, Cen Tongtong is treating us,\" Zheng Baozhu said generously, glancing at Meng Yaxin, who was holding a beer bottle and seemed a bit drunk, \"And you, how about you? Are you so happy to see Qu Zhi?\"As Zheng Baozhu said this, her eyebrows slightly raised as she looked at Meng Yaxin in front of her, \"Were you secretly in love with Qu Zhi during high school?\"Although Qu Zhi acted like a hypocrite in front of Zheng Baozhu, not everyone had her good eye to see through his fa\u00e7ade. During their school days, there was a wave of students who were attracted to Qu Zhi one after another, all mesmerized by his appearance.Because of Zheng Baozhu's association with Qu Zhi, some students even asked her about Qu Zhi's situation and asked her to pass messages. Zheng Baozhu got annoyed with being pestered and helped pass messages a few times. But Meng Yaxin, being the good friend that she was, always stood her ground and never passed on these messages!Meng Yaxin blushed a little and rolled her eyes while holding the beer bottle, \"Ugh, I broke up with my boyfriend!\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu fell silent for a moment and said, \"Oh, it's a happy occasion then.\"Zheng Baozhu had only met Meng Yaxin's boyfriend once and had always felt that he was unreliable. But Meng Yaxin liked his face and was charmed by him, but now she seemed to have figured things out and was willing to break up?Cen Tongtong also didn't like Meng Yaxin's boyfriend and curiously approached Meng Yaxin, \"Why? What's the reason?\"Everyone in the room looked curious as well.Meng Yaxin burped and muttered while holding the beer bottle, \"Because of international relations.\"\"...\"The whole room fell silent for a second.Zheng Baozhu felt that she had misunderstood that young boy all along.Wasn't this a discussion with a broad perspective?\"Tell me, how did international relations affect your relationship?\" Zheng Baozhu asked sincerely.Meng Yaxin started to complain endlessly, \"Now, isn't the High Hair fashionable? I reminded him to wear a mask when going out. But, who would have thought he would start preaching about the uselessness of masks? Then we went from politics and economics to history and culture, and he kept talking about how everything is better abroad and how we are inferior. Ha! Does that little brat think I haven't lived abroad? What does he know! If abroad is so great, why did Qu Zhi give up a high salary and come back here?\"Qi Sheng, who was listening with great interest, timely chimed in, \"Of course, it's for the sake of developing our motherland! Old Qu's dedication in this aspect is commendable.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Qu Zhi had really established his persona well; people in the entertainment industry should learn from him.\"That's right, Dr. Qu is a true adult! I won't look for little brats anymore next time!\" Meng Yaxin slammed the table and enthusiastically poured a drink for Qu Zhi, \"Let's forget about that unlucky thing, Zhou Jun, today we're gathered here to welcome Qu Zhi back to the country! By the way, it's been about eight years since we last met, right?\"\"Yes, around eight years,\" Qu Zhi raised his hand to block the glass in front of him, \"That's enough.\"Meng Yaxin then moved to the side and poured a drink for Qi Sheng. \"Little Qi, you and Qu Zhi are colleagues, and I heard that you both graduated from the same university?\"\"Yes,\" Qi Sheng nodded, \"Although you may not believe it, I'm actually his senior.\"\"...\"Meng Yaxin looked at Qu Zhi, then looked at Qi Sheng, \"Then you should confront him face to face!\"\"...\"Do you think I don't want to?\"Baozhu,\" Meng Yaxin approached Zheng Baozhu with a beer in hand, \"Let's have a drink too! You mentioned before that you went to the Film and Television City, how did it go?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zheng\u00a0Baozhu forced a smile on her face and said, \"Hahaha, Meng Yaxin has had too much to drink, don't listen to her.\"Meng Yaxin frowned unhappily and denied, \"I'm not drunk, I can still drink!\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu picked up a piece of food and stuffed it into Meng Yaxin's mouth.Meng Yaxin whimpered twice but found the food tasty and picked up the chopsticks to grab another piece herself.\"Hehe, everyone, let's eat,\" Zheng Baozhu forced a laugh and urged everyone to enjoy the food, attempting to divert the topic from the Film and Television City. Unfortunately, Qi Sheng, the oblivious god, enthusiastically asked, \"Miss Baozhu, you went to the Film\u00a0and Television City? Did you... go to invest?\"Zheng Baozhu thought that was a good excuse and was about to respond when Meng Yaxin spoke vaguely, \"No, she went there to become an actress.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Qi Sheng widened his eyes in surprise, \"You want to become an actress?\"\"I... didn't...\"\"I think you'd be perfect!\" Qi Sheng didn't even give her a chance to deny it, and he was acting as if he himself were going to become an actor, \"You're so beautiful, you're on par with those celebrities on TV! Right, Qu Zhi?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She wanted to throw Qi Sheng and Meng Yaxin out together. :)Qu Zhi responded with an ambiguous smile and looked at Zheng Baozhu, \"Speaking of which, Zheng Baozhu's childhood dream was to become a celebrity.\"\"Is that so? I support you, Miss Baozhu!\" Qi Sheng had already started supporting Zheng Baozhu with enthusiasm.Zheng Baozhu fell silent for a moment, and patted Qi Sheng's shoulder with her hand, gesturing for him to step back a bit. Then she took a handful of peanuts from the plate and looked at Qu Zhi with a wicked smile, saying, \"Qu Zhi, I'm not a third grader anymore. If you dare to tattle to my mom, I'll make sure we both go down together.\"As she spoke, she twisted the handful of peanuts in her hand, and when she loosened her grip slightly, the crushed peanut shells fell from her palm like dust.It was as if she could shatter Qu Zhi's confidence.Qi Sheng: \"...\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Qu Zhi remained silent for a moment, looking at Zheng Baozhu's hand, he asked, \"Doesn't your hand hurt?\"\"...\"It did hurt, but it didn't matter. Zheng Baozhu didn't even furrow her brows and raised her voice with a confident tone, \"Do you know what you should do now?\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Perhaps Zheng Baozhu really was suited to be an actress; he admired her acting skills.Seeing that the dinner was about to turn cold, Cen Tongtong and Qi Sheng tried to rescue the situation, allowing the dinner to continue.Afterward, everyone tacitly avoided mentioning the incident. It was already dark when they finished dinner. Zheng Baozhu saw that Meng Yaxin was so drunk that she couldn't walk steadily, so she arranged for her to stay in a hotel room for the night. Cen Tongtong and Qi Sheng drove back to the city together in the same car. Qu Zhi watched their car drive away, then turned back to the hotel. As he waited for the elevator, he happened to encounter Zheng Baozhu, who was also going upstairs.Zheng Baozhu glanced at him and clicked her tongue, then walked toward the elevator. After the elevator doors opened, they both stood on opposite sides, creating a symbolic \"38th Parallel\" just like the one drawn on the school desk during elementary school.The enclosed space was quiet, but they didn't pay attention to each other. Finally, as the doors opened, Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but remind him, \"Remember not to tattle to my mom.\"Qu Zhi snorted lightly and looked sideways, \"Do you think I can keep it a secret from your family forever?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"I didn't plan on hiding it from them forever. When I achieve success, it won't matter even if they oppose it.\"Qu Zhi responded indifferently, \"Just like those scumbags who want to reap the rewards without putting in any effort.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"\"I remember when we were in our final year of high school, you wanted to apply to the Film Academy, but it almost sent your grandmother to the ICU in anger,\" Qu Zhi glanced at her, \"Now your grandmother is even older, but it looks like you're not afraid anymore.\"\"Don't bring that up to me,\" Zheng Baozhu frowned slightly. Originally, she had planned to apply to the performing arts program, but she didn't anticipate that the class teacher would inform her parents. The whole family exploded after that, \"It was only after I arrived at the hospital that I realized where my late aunt's acting skills came from. It turns out my grandmother was the master in acting.\"\"... Did your grandmother pretend to be ill?\" Qu Zhi asked.Zheng Baozhu clicked her tongue twice, \"Our whole family is full of seasoned actors.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"\"Since she just pretended to be ill, why didn't you still register later on?\" Qu Zhi asked.Zheng Baozhu said, \"In order to stop me from registering, they even came up with tactics like that. If I had actually registered, who knows what kind of trouble they would have caused.\"In the past, she chose to compromise for the sake of family harmony, but now that she was independent, it was much easier to keep it hidden from her family than when she was in school.Provided that Qu Zhi didn't tattle.Thinking about it, she looked at Qu Zhi again. Qu Zhi seemed to know what she wanted to say and spoke before she did, \"I'm not that bored, just make sure you keep it to yourself.\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him in surprise, \"You're that easy to talk to?\"\"I'm not in third grade anymore, and I don't want to go down with you,\" he said, then looked at Zheng Baozhu and chuckled, \"But I didn't expect you to be so persistent in your dream.\"Zheng Baozhu raised her head slightly defiantly, \"Why? Just because your dream got an A+ and mine got a B-, you're allowed to be persistent, but I'm not? Dreams don't have a ranking!\"\"...\"Qu Zhi nodded and said, \"But there's a difference in writing skills.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"\"Hmph!\" Zheng Baozhu let out a proud snort and turned to leave.As soon as she returned to her room, she heard a notification sound from her phone. It was a notice sent to the group chat. Almost instantly after the message was sent, people started replying to sign up. Zheng Baozhu had previously heeded Wang Jingyi's advice and had prepared her information in a note on her phone. She quickly copied and pasted it in response to the message.Her speed was pretty good; she managed to secure a spot in the top ten. The group admin would select based on the order of registration and announce the final list.Zheng Baozhu's name luckily appeared in the list compiled by the group admin, right after Wang Jingyi's name. Just as she was about to message Wang Jingyi, Wang Jingyi sent her a message first, \"Congratulations! We can go to the set together tomorrow!\"Zheng Baozhu: Great!Wang Jingyi: The group chat sends out pre-registration information at this time every day. You have to be quick!Zheng Baozhu: Yeah, snatching roles is quite exciting!Zheng Baozhu's heart was still pounding with excitement. She planned to check out this group chat at this time in the future, hoping for more opportunities.Wang Jingyi: Hahaha, see you at the parking lot tomorrow. By the way, do you have a folding chair? If not, I'll bring one for you tomorrow.Zheng Baozhu: Thanks, sis! I'll prepare one too.Wang Jingyi: Yeah, there's nowhere to sit on the set, so we have to bring our own chairs.Wang Jingyi also shared some extra casting tips with Zheng Baozhu and the two of them prepared eagerly for tomorrow's schedule. They were supposed to meet at 9:30 in the morning. Although Zheng Baozhu lived a bit far, she had plenty of time.She woke up early in the morning, got everything ready, and opened her fortune-telling app to check her luck for the day\u2014it was brown.She picked a caramel-colored chiffon scarf from her hat, matched with a light brown wool coat. After changing into her outfit, she went to the restaurant for breakfast and then took a taxi to the Film and Television City.She had considered driving herself, but thinking about how exhausted she might be after filming, she chose to take a taxi instead.When she arrived at the parking lot, there were still twenty minutes left until the agreed time. The place was already crowded, they would be arranged together to go to the shooting location. Zheng Baozhu was looking for Wang Jingyi among the crowd when a girl called out to her, \"Are you Zheng Baozhu? I'm Wang Jingyi.\"Upon hearing her name, Zheng Baozhu turned to look. Wang Jingyi was a slim girl with long black hair and a pretty face.\"Hello, I'm Zheng Baozhu,\" Zheng Baozhu smiled and greeted her. Wang Jingyi had brought two chairs with her, she quickly handed one over to Zheng Baozhu. Then she continued to assess Zheng Baozhu and said with some astonishment, \"You're so beautiful! How come you're in the standby group?\"\"Well...\" Maybe because the elder brother had only introduced her to the standby group admin?\"You have good qualifications too. How come you're in the standby group?\" Zheng Baozhu took the initiative and asked.Wang Jingyi replied, \"My height is just shy of the requirement. If I were 168 centimeters tall, I could be in the main group.\"\"Oh, it's okay.\" Zheng Baozhu reassured her, \"Anyway, I heard that both the main group and the standby group receive the same pay.\"\"Hahaha, that's true,\" Wang Jingyi laughed and started looking at Zheng Baozhu again.Zheng Baozhu had really good qualifications. Although she wasn't particularly slim, her figure was great, and she was definitely taller than 168 centimeters, so entering the main group wouldn't be a problem. Most importantly, her face was exceptionally beautiful. Wang Jingyi had been a background performer in the industry for two months but hadn't seen such a gorgeous looking extra before.Suddenly, Wang Jingyi exclaimed, \"I heard that a foreground extra had a dispute with Sun Jing the day before yesterday. It's not you, is it?\"Zheng Baozhu blinked, slightly surprised. Bad news travels fast, doesn't it?\"How did you hear about this?\" she asked.Wang Jingyi replied, \"I heard it from other colleagues who happened to be in Sun Jing's crew. They said Sun Jing felt that the foreground extra was too beautiful and was stealing the limelight.\"When Wang Jingyi first heard about this, she didn't believe it. Although Sun Jing's acting skills were in doubt, her appearance was widely recognized. She couldn't be that lacking in confidence, right? Today, after meeting Zheng Baozhu in person, she finally understood.\"Sis, you're amazing!\" Wang Jingyi gave Zheng Baozhu a thumbs-up, \"Foreground extras are the bottom of the food chain on the set, and yet you dared to stand up to Sun Jing! You're incredible!\"Zheng Baozhu waved her hand, gesturing for Wang Jingyi to keep it low-key, \"The status of foreground extras may be low, but we should still consider what is right and wrong.\"\"You're right, but on the set, the one who's more popular is always considered right,\" Wang Jingyi explained. She had also worked as an extra on the set and had experienced her fair share of frustrations, but she didn't dare confront the leading actors directly as Zheng Baozhu did.Here, being unpopular was a sin.\"I see you're wearing Bunny's runway collection. Your family must be well-off, right?\" Wang Jingyi earnestly suggested, \"If possible, ask your family to invest some money in promoting your career. It'll be much better than struggling on your own here.\"Zheng Baozhu responded, \"My family doesn't support me in pursuing this career. I'm here on my own.\"\"Oh... I see.\" Wang Jingyi nodded. She heard the group leader organizing everyone to get on the bus, so she quickly pulled Zheng Baozhu along. It took an hour for the crew transportation to arrive at the shooting location. Before the bus even came to a stop, Wang Jingyi suddenly grabbed Zheng Baozhu's hand with a grip as strong as when Su Mingxi's when heard that Zheng Baozhu wanted to become a celebrity.Startled, Zheng Baozhu asked, \"What's wrong?\"Wang Jingyi couldn't contain her excitement and said, \"This... This is the set of [Qing Chen]! The male lead is Lin Ziqin!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs an aspiring star who constantly keeps an eye on the entertainment industry, Zheng Baozhu naturally knew who Lin Ziqin was.He had just finished a popular historical drama and had become one of the hottest rising stars among male actors, thanks to his outstanding appearance.There were many girls in Zheng Baozhu's hotel who liked him, so it wasn't surprising that Wang Jingyi was also a fan.Zheng Baozhu was also a bit surprised because the group announcements in the chat didn't mention the crew's information. She only found out later, \"Really? Will Lin Ziqin come today?\"Though it may not be true, she was still excited to catch a glimpse of the handsome actor.\"He should be coming. We'll find out when we receive the call sheet!\" Wang Jingyi held onto Zheng Baozhu, her hands trembling, \"Ah, what should I do? I'm so nervous right now!\"\"Take it easy, take a deep breath.\"Wang Jingyi took a few deep breaths, and with the folding chairs on their backs, she and Zheng Baozhu got off the bus together.At present, the crew was shooting another scene, so they were arranged in a studio to change costumes and do makeup. [Qing Chen] was a fantasy martial arts drama, and today Zheng Baozhu was set to play a disciple of a sect, wearing the same costume as Wang Jingyi. It was her first time wearing this type of outfit, and after the makeup was done, she happily took a few selfies, \"I didn't expect to look good in ancient costumes.\"Wang Jingyi stood beside her with her phone and said, \"You stand up and let me take a full-body photo of you!\"\"Sure!\"The two helped each other take several photos, and then the crew started serving lunch. Working all morning, everyone was naturally hungry. Wang Jingyi quickly pulled Zheng Baozhu to get their meals.\"I heard someone say that the boxed lunches from the [Qing Chen] crew are the best tasting!\" After receiving their box lunches, Wang Jingyi and Zheng Baozhu found a spot in the rest area and sat on their small chairs. They eagerly opened their meals, \"The boxed lunches for background performers are the same as the staff's, but the food is slightly better.\"\"Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded. It was no wonder everyone was eager to be in the main group or have special contracts, as even these small details made a difference. She opened her box lunch and looked inside. As someone who worked in the food industry, she knew that the quality of this box lunch couldn't compare to a restaurant's, but it was enough to fill her stomach. She took a spoonful and told Wang Jingyi, \"It tastes better than I imagined.\"\"Yeah, it's no surprise. It's a big production,\" Wang Jingyi said. In her eyes, everything would be great on a set where Lin Ziqin was present.Zheng Baozhu had only taken a few bites when her phone on the table vibrated.She picked it up and glanced at the caller ID. Her eyebrows raised slightly, and she answered the call, \"Hey, are you finally awake, Meng Yaxin?\"\"...\"Meng Yaxin knew something was wrong from the tone, \"Hahaha, Baozhu, I drank too much last night. Did I say something I shouldn't have?\"\"And you still have the audacity to ask? You blabbered about me going to the Film and Television City in Qu Zhi's presence!\" Zheng Baozhu retorted.\"...I'm sorry, I really drank too much! It's all because of Zhou Jun, that bastard!\" Meng Yaxin promptly shifted the blame onto Zhou Jun, \"So, is it resolved now? Qu Zhi is a mature person, he wouldn't go to your mother to complain, right?\"Zheng Baozhu hummed twice, \"It's resolved, but I've taken note of this.\"\"Okay, okay. I'll get you a gift to make it up to you! I'll give you the shiniest one. You'll definitely like it. Where are you now, on the set?\"\"Yes, having lunch.\"\"In that case, I won't bother you. I'll go have lunch too!\" Meng Yaxin hurriedly hung up the phone. Zheng Baozhu took a few more bites of her meal when Wang Jingyi grabbed her hand again.\"Lin Ziqin is here!\" Wang Jingyi's voice was filled with excitement, her tone even changed. Zheng Baozhu followed her gaze to see a group of staff members approaching, occasionally catching a glimpse of Lin Ziqin's face within their encirclement.His appearance in ancient costume was handsome, even just a casual glance at his profile was breathtaking. This styling was even colder and more elegant than his previous historical drama role, exuding a transcendent charm that seemed to have a touch of cultivation.\"Ah, he's so handsome! This styling looks amazing too!\" Wang Jingyi, who had been focused on eating, picked up her phone and took a picture in the direction of Lin Ziqin. After Lin Ziqin came out, he sat down on his chair. It was one of those chairs that everyone had been instructed not to sit on without permission.A staff member handed him water and a box lunch. Wang Jingyi, holding her lunch, couldn't take her eyes off the area where Lin Ziqin was, as though he was more appetizing than the food in her box.\"Baozhu!\" Suddenly, Wang Jingyi called out to Zheng Baozhu. Zheng Baozhu had grown accustomed to these surprises, \"What's wrong?\"\"Can you take a picture for me later?\" Wang Jingyi looked at her with anticipation. Zheng Baozhu quickly understood what she meant, \"A photo with Lin Ziqin?\"\"Yes, exactly!\" Wang Jingyi nodded eagerly.Zheng Baozhu asked, \"But will the staff members there agree?\"\"No need for their agreement!\"\"?\" At first, Zheng Baozhu didn't understand, but after finishing her meal, she held her phone and prepared to take pictures for Wang Jingyi, she understood.Wang Jingyi's so-called \"photo together\" meant pretending to casually pass by behind Lin Ziqin. Zheng Baozhu's task was to quickly capture a photo of them appearing together during that moment when they crossed paths.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"This was getting even more exciting.\"Do you understand now?\" Wang Jingyi tidied her hair and attire and confirmed with Zheng Baozhu one last time. Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"I understand.\"\"Then I'm off!\" Wang Jingyi quickly returned, leaning over to look at Zheng Baozhu's phone screen. Zheng Baozhu made an OK gesture and handed her the phone, \"I took a lot of pictures, choose the one you like the most.\"\"Wow, thank you so much, sis!!\" Wang Jingyi felt like she had found a treasure and earnestly began selecting the photos.While she was choosing, Zheng Baozhu noticed that some of the staff members next to Lin Ziqin had left. She tapped Wang Jingyi, \"It seems like only Lin Ziqin is there now. Do you want to go and ask if he'd be willing to take a photo? What if he agrees?\"This suggestion was undoubtedly tempting, but after hesitating several times, Wang Jingyi tearfully said, \"I don't dare, wu wu wu! I don't want to appear timid in front of Lin Ziqin, even though I am timid. I don't want to embarrass myself!\"\"...Then I'll pretend that I want to take a photo with him, and you can help us take it. After that, I'll offer to take a photo for both of you,\" Zheng Baozhu suggested.\"!\" Wang Jingyi's eyes lit up as if she had seen hope, \"That seems like a good idea!\"\"Okay, let's do that!\" Zheng Baozhu pulled Wang Jingyi and walked towards Lin Ziqin again, but Wang Jingyi's hands were trembling.\"Relax, it's just chasing after a star, it's not that serious!\"Wang Jingyi swallowed nervously. Although she called Lin Ziqin her husband in online posts every day, when she saw him in person, she became too timid to even speak properly.She followed Zheng Baozhu like a quail, lacking in confidence. On the other hand, Zheng Baozhu remained calm and composed. When she approached Lin Ziqin, she smiled and greeted him, \"Hello, Teacher Lin.\"Lin Ziqin glanced up at them, seeming somewhat skeptical. Zheng Baozhu smiled at him again and spoke, \"Sorry to bother you. I'm also from the [Qing Chen] drama crew. May I ask if you'd be willing to take a photo with me?\"Lin Ziqin looked at them and nodded, \"Sure, but please try not to share it online.\"\"No problem, no problem,\" Zheng Baozhu quickly agreed, \"I'll keep it for myself and won't spread it!\"Lin Ziqin smiled faintly. He put away his phone, stood up from the chair, and Zheng Baozhu stood next to him, maintaining a polite distance without getting too close.\"Let's take the photo,\" Seeing that Wang Jingyi hadn't reacted, Zheng Baozhu reminded her. Wang Jingyi finally snapped out of her daze and quickly raised her phone to take two pictures of them, \"Done.\"Acting according to the plan, Zheng Baozhu suggested to Lin Ziqin, \"How about I also take a photo with both of you?\"\"Sure,\" Lin Ziqin didn't refuse. His attitude had always been friendly.Zheng Baozhu hurriedly ran over to switch places with Wang Jingyi. Just as she took the phone from Wang Jingyi, a crew member held up a megaphone and shouted, \"Get ready, we're starting!\"Lin Ziqin's assistant also returned, whispering something to him. Lin Ziqin nodded and said to Zheng Baozhu and Wang Jingyi, \"Sorry, I have to start working now. Maybe next time we'll have the chance to take more photos.\"\"Alright,\" Zheng Baozhu responded with a hint of regret, \"Thank you, Teacher Lin.\"Lin Ziqin nodded slightly and followed the crew member. Zheng Baozhu sighed and reassured Wang Jingyi, \"It's okay. Let's see if there's another opportunity later. He should be at the set all day today.\"Once again, Wang Jingyi grabbed Zheng Baozhu's arm tightly.Zheng Baozhu: \"?\"\"Ah ah ah ah ah!\" Wang Jingyi exclaimed excitedly, \"I've been holding it in until now! Lin Ziqin is really handsome!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"After Wang Jingyi's excitement subsided, she finally remembered to show the photos she just took, \"Take a look at the photos. You look especially good in them! You're still so beautiful standing next to Lin Ziqin!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She made a sound of agreement, \"My beauty is not overshadowed by others.\"\"Hahaha, make sure to keep them well!\"\"Well, how about I send you a copy?\" Zheng Baozhu suggested, opening Wang Jingyi's WeChat and sending her all the photos they took today, \"You can Photoshop my face into yours and pretend you took a photo with your idol.\"\"...Thank you, that's really an irresistible offer.\"\"The extras are also gathering over there!\" The group leader shouted, \"Get ready, we're starting the shoot!\"Zheng Baozhu and Wang Jingyi quickly put away their phones and ran toward the gathering spot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayToday's scene\u00a0to be filmed is a grand spectacle, gathering various immortal sects and prestigious families from [Qing Chen]. This was the reason they needed so many foreground extras to portray disciples from each sect.Zheng Baozhu received a Taoist sword prop and stood in the designated position with Wang Jingyi. The director had just explained the scene to them. Today, they were filming the scene where disciples from various sects gathered at the male lead's doorstep, asking him to play the role of the demonic cult demon. If the male lead refused, they planned to barge in.\"This is the siege of the six major sects at Ming Summit,\" Zheng Baozhu whispered to Wang Jingyi beside her.Wang Jingyi was staring in the direction of Lin Ziqin. The director was still discussing the scene with the main actors, \"Do you see that actor wearing the costume over there? He's a well-known stuntman here. He will have a fight scene with Lin Ziqin later.\"\"Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded. That actor's appearance wasn't particularly handsome, but he must be skilled since he was chosen for the role.\"Ah, I really want to be a stuntman. Maybe then I'll have a chance to have a fight scene with Lin Ziqin!\" Wang Jingyi said.Zheng Baozhu asked, \"How can you become a stuntman?\"Wang Jingyi replied, \"After running as an extra in the film and television city for one or two months, you can sign up for the stuntman exam. There are different requirements for major, medium, and minor stunts. I went to take the exam last week, but I didn't pass. Sigh.\"\"Oh... well, it's just about gaining more experience,\" Zheng Baozhu said.\"Everyone, get into position. We're about to start shooting,\" After the director finished talking with the main actors, they were ready to begin filming. The focus of this scene was on the male lead. Disciples like Zheng Baozhu were there to fill the scene. Their role was simple. When the leaders of their sects confronted the male lead, they would draw their swords together.The director let them practice once before officially starting the shoot. In this scene, the male lead was facing a large group, and almost all the action belonged to Lin Ziqin. Although they hadn't reached the point where Zheng Baozhu and others drew their swords, they still had to stand there and wait.Since the camera wasn't on them at the moment, they could relax a bit. Wang Jingyi quietly approached Zheng Baozhu and whispered, \"Lin Ziqin's action scenes are so impressive, he isn't even using a stunt double!\"Zheng Baozhu had also noticed that. Although the crew had prepared a stunt double for Lin Ziqin, he didn't use one. Even the elders from the sects who fought him had stunt doubles, but Lin Ziqin insisted on doing it himself.\"He's dedicated,\" Zheng Baozhu said quietly.Wang Jingyi nodded repeatedly, \"Yes, nowadays many actors filming action scenes aren't trained at all. It's all slow motion and camera tricks! Lin Ziqin actually learned some martial arts before. Look how great he looks!\"Wang Jingyi, as a devoted fan of Lin Ziqin, always praised him. As they conversed, the scene was finally over, and the director let them rest for a few minutes before starting the next scene.In the next scene, it was finally time for Zheng Baozhu and others to draw their swords!Although there were no lines this time, there were close-up shots of them. Zheng Baozhu felt a bit nervous. Several cameras were pointed in their direction, and the actor standing in the front began delivering their lines. Zheng Baozhu didn't pay attention to what was being said; she focused on the director's voice.\"Draw your swords!\" The director commanded, and everyone swiftly unsheathed their swords with a \"swish, swish, swish\".\"Your movements are still not synchronized enough,\" the director said in heavily accented Mandarin, waving his hand to stop, \"Make them more synchronized, more spirited. Also, pay attention to your facial expressions. Now, you're going for a fight. Show some vigor! Let's do it again.\"Everyone sheathed their swords and stood in position, waiting for the director's signal. When they drew their swords for the second time, their movements were much more synchronized. The director scrutinized them and didn't find any flaws, \"Okay, this one passes.\"Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, except for Zheng Baozhu, who wasn't satisfied yet. The previous segment was too short, not allowing her to fully showcase her acting skills! Although they didn't have any lines in the upcoming scenes, they couldn't leave. They had to stay and fill the scene.In winter, the daylight was short. The sky started to darken before 7 o'clock. The crew didn't know when they would wrap up today's filming. The director dismissed some people and changed the shooting location. Zheng Baozhu and Wang Jingyi were still needed, so they followed the rest of the crew to an area outside the mountains. Since it was almost dark, the specially arranged mountain area looked eerie.With the cold wind blowing, everyone took their positions and filming quickly resumed. Zheng Baozhu continued to follow their sect leader, as they had heard that special effects actors would be appearing later. As long as they followed their sect leader, they would be able to run away.While filming, Zheng Baozhu vaguely heard some rustling noises behind her. Maintaining a professional demeanor, she didn't turn around to check until something firmly grabbed her ankle, causing her to slightly turn her head and glance.\"Roar...\" A creature with a grotesque face covered in water crawled on the ground, its blurry eyes gazing up, emitting incomprehensible growls toward Zheng Baozhu. And the one gripping her ankle was its bandaged and decayed hand.For a brief second, Zheng Baozhu's mind went blank. She was so scared that she jumped straight up from her original spot, \"Ah ah ah ah, there's a ghost!\"Her reaction was so intense that even the creature that had grabbed her was kicked away by her. Everyone on set was drawn to the commotion and looked over. The director, somewhat annoyed, waved his hand to stop the filming and asked, \"What's going on? Why are you screaming?\"\"What... What is that thing? It suddenly crawled out and grabbed my leg!\" Zheng Baozhu, not caring about the director's anger, hopped away while pointing at the creature on the ground.Everyone now looked down at the ground, where the creature had been kicked away by Zheng Baozhu. It seemed dazed and curled up. The director ordered the lights to be directed towards it to get a clear view and became even more furious, \"What's wrong with you? It's not yet time for your scene. What are you causing a disturbance for?\"\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" A staff member quickly came out to apologize and picked up the special effects actor from the ground, \"He probably didn't hear clearly.\"\"Keep an eye on your people! What are they doing, running out like that?\"\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" the staff member repeatedly apologized and hurriedly led the special effects actor away. The director then pointed at Zheng Baozhu and scolded, \"And you, stop getting scared so easily. Show some professionalism!\"\"...I'm sorry.\"\"Alright, let's continue filming.\"The director instructed everyone to return to their positions and the shooting resumed. Zheng Baozhu thought about straightening her costume when she realized that her clothes and shoes had been stained red. The outfit she was wearing was a simple and elegant white, and the red stains were highly visible, especially the clear handprint left on her shoes by the person who had grabbed her.\"Director, my costume got stained,\" Zheng Baozhu could only report the situation to the director. Seeing the significant red stain on the costume, the director had someone come over and said, \"Quickly get it changed, we need to keep shooting.\"The costume designer hesitated and explained, \"There are many extras today, these sect costumes are one set per person. We don't have any extras.\"The director furrowed his brow impatiently, then turned to Zheng Baozhu and said, \"In that case, you can go back for now. Return the costume and you're free to leave.\"\"...Alright,\" Zheng Baozhu waved to Wang Jingyi and followed the costume designer to return the costume. When she arrived at the Starlight Farm, it was just past 9:15 p.m. Meng Yaxin and Qu Zhi were sitting on the couch in the reading area, chatting.Zheng Baozhu approached them and asked, \"What's going on? You two are still chatting?\"Meng Yaxin held an apple with a few bites taken out of it and looked over upon hearing Zheng Baozhu's voice, \"Baozhu, you're back? I just finished dinner and happened to run into Dr. Qu, so I came to plead with him to not tattle about you to your parents.\"\"Oh, now you're trying to fix the situation? Are you trying to fix the stable door after the horse has bolted?\" Zheng Baozhu sat down on the nearby couch and asked, \"Why are you still here? Aren't you supposed to be working?\"Meng Yaxin replied, \"I took a vacation. I planned to treat my injuries here.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Qu Zhi sat on the couch across from them without saying a word. He leaned back and lowered his gaze, reading a science magazine he had taken from the hotel's bookshelf.Meng Yaxin took another bite of her apple, producing a crisp sound, \"I have to say, the apples here are really delicious. I think I'll go to the orchard and pick some tomorrow,\" She then curiously turned to Zheng Baozhu and asked, \"Why did you come back so early? It's still early for the crew to finish work.\"\"Finish work early? I came back ahead of time,\" Zheng Baozhu shook her head, \"I went to the film studio twice, but both times were unsuccessful. Maybe it's because someone passed their bad luck on to me.\"\"...\"Meng Yaxin glanced at Qu Zhi sitting across from them. He truly was a stoic adult, unaffected by Zheng Baozhu's misfortune. She cleared her throat a few times and asked Zheng Baozhu, \"Tell me, what happened today? You didn't get into an argument with someone again, did you?\"\"Of course not. Today's incident...\" Zheng Baozhu vividly described the situation to Meng Yaxin, \"We were in the middle of filming when we arrived at a desolate place. The night wind was howling and it was dark all around. Suddenly! I felt something grab onto me! When I turned around, oh my goodness, there was a blurry zombie-like creature crawling towards me from under my feet!\"As Zheng Baozhu reached this point, she deliberately grabbed Meng Yaxin's leg and let out a low growl. Meng Yaxin was startled and almost threw her apple away, \"You, just sit there and talk. Don't touch me.\"Zheng Baozhu retracted her hand and clicked her tongue, \"Let me tell you, the set design, makeup effects, and atmosphere on that set were scarier than any horror game we've played before! I was so scared that I jumped up and kicked that thing away with one foot!\"\"...\"Meng Yaxin pursed her lips and tentatively asked, \"So the director sent you back?\"\"... More or less.\"\"...\"You truly are something, Zheng Baozhu.Qu Zhi, who was still reading the magazine across from them, chuckled lightly without looking up and sighed, \"Let's look forward to what mishap Zheng Baozhu will cause tomorrow.\"\"You...\" Zheng Baozhu looked like she was about to go fight Qu Zhi but was promptly restrained by Meng Yaxin.\"Haha, anyway,\" Meng Yaxin changed the topic, pretending to be very interested, \"I heard that, Qu Zhi, you're researching artificial intelligence, right?\"\"Mm,\" Qu Zhi responded casually.Meng Yaxin asked with feigned curiosity, \"So, can you create those human-robot hybrids like in the movies?\" She sighed and continued, \"It's so tiring to interact with humans. I want to buy a robot boyfriend.\"Qu Zhi said, \"In theory, it's possible, but it will still take some time. It will be up to my descendants to make it happen.\"Zheng Baozhu exaggeratedly laughed and said, \"What? Do you actually think you'll have descendants? Who would have descendants with you? Hahaha!\"\"...\"Qu Zhi put down the magazine, turned his head, and walked away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMeng Yaxin was speechless and suspected that there was some unresolved grudge between Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi, which was why they couldn't help but quarrel whenever they saw each other.Zheng Baozhu was pleased that she was able to make Qu Zhi angry. She took out her phone and shared her experiences at the Film and Television City with Meng Yaxin, \"The male lead of the production I visited today is Lin Ziqin...\"Before Zheng Baozhu could finish her sentence, Meng Yaxin interrupted, \"What? [Qing Chen]?\"Zheng Baozhu glanced at her in surprise, \"You know about it too?\"\"Of course! I'm a fan of Lin Ziqin!\"\"...But I thought you liked Qi Wang?\"Meng Yaxin replied, \"It's not unusual to like multiple men at the same time, is it?\"\"...\"Okay. Zheng Baozhu opened the photos she took with Lin Ziqin, \"Take a look at this photo of me and Lin Ziqin!\"\"!\" Meng Yaxin quickly leaned over, \"Wow, there are perks like this when you go to the set!\"\"Hehe...\" Zheng Baozhu laughed proudly.\"Lin Ziqin is really handsome. You also look good in this outfit,\" Meng Yaxin took out her own phone and said to Zheng Baozhu, \"Send me this photo.\"\"What are you going to do with it? Your big brother said not to post it online.\"Meng Yaxin replied, \"I won't post it online. I'll just photoshop my face onto yours.\"\"...\"Who said being friends with Meng Yaxin wasn't a matter of fate?After sending the photo to Meng Yaxin, Zheng Baozhu didn't chat any further and went straight upstairs. After taking a shower and nestling in bed, she received a message from Wang Jingyi.Wang Jingyi: We finally finished work. Now we're taking the bus back. It's cold.Zheng Baozhu: Hahaha, I'm already lying in bed!Wang Jingyi:Wang Jingyi: Don't worry too much about what happened on set today. The director is always like that, shouting at everyone.Zheng Baozhu: Haha, it's fine. My mental fortitude isn't that weak. \u00a0Besides, the director has a point. I indeed didn't behave professionally.She became a foreground extra at the Film and Television City to improve herself. It's important to identify one's shortcomings and make timely corrections.Zheng Baozhu: I wonder if that special effects actor I kicked is okay [facepalm emoji]. I was so scared at that moment that I didn't hold back my strength.Wang Jingyi: Hahaha, don't worry, he's fine. But he'll definitely be scolded by the crew.Zheng Baozhu: As long as he's okay.While the two of them were chatting, Sun Jing's crew also finished work. Unlike the foreground extras, they had their own chauffeur to pick them up. Sitting in the car, Sun Jing felt much warmer. She adjusted the chair to a comfortable angle and played with her phone while semi-reclining.The assistant sat next to her and shared some gossip she had heard from another source, \"Sister Jing, do you remember that guy, Wang Lei? The one who often works as a background actor on the set?\"Sun Jing thought for a moment and nodded, \"Yeah, the one who always appears as an extra? What about him?\"\"He went to work on the set of [Qing Chen] today. And that foreground extra, Zheng Baozhu, who had an argument with you last time, was also there,\" the assistant lowered her voice instinctively and continued, \"I heard that Wang Lei deliberately scared Zheng Baozhu on set today, and as a result, he got scolded by the director. It's definitely his way of seeking revenge for you.\"Sun Jing raised an eyebrow and glanced at her, \"He's clever, but there's no need to specifically target someone like Zheng Baozhu. Isn't that degrading himself?\"The assistant, being an old acquaintance of Sun Jing, quickly understood her meaning, \"I got it, I'll let someone know.\"\"Okay.\" Sun Jing responded and started playing with her phone again.On the other end, Wang Jingyi was still messaging Zheng Baozhu, \"Are you going to the Film and Television City tomorrow? I plan to take a day off tomorrow and go the day after.\"Zheng Baozhu: I am also not going. I'm going to look at houses tomorrow.Wang Jingyi: ????After sending three question marks, Wang Jingyi remembered the Bunny fashion show outfit that Zheng Baozhu wore today and gradually regained her composure.Wang Jingyi: Are you planning to buy a house?Zheng Baozhu: I'm just going to take a look tomorrow. I don't have the qualifications to purchase.Wang Jingyi: Really? You don't have the qualifications? Aren't you rich?Zheng Baozhu: It's because of insufficient education credentials.Wang Jingyi: ?Is that how it is in the world of wealthy people?The two of them didn't discuss this matter further. After spending a day on the set, they were both exhausted. Zheng Baozhu yawned and bid Wang Jingyi goodnight. The next day, the sales office opened promptly at 10 o'clock. Since it was only open to high-end individuals with invitation letters, there wasn't the usual crowded scene seen at regular real estate projects.Zheng Baozhu and Qi Sheng arrived at 9:30 am, but there weren't many people at the sales office yet. Qu Zhi also came today but walked ahead with a cold expression, not saying a word. Qi Sheng noticed this and felt concerned. Although Qu Zhi had conflicts with Zheng Baozhu in the past, he would still engage in banter. But today, he seemed distant, as if he was carrying a heavy burden.\"Miss Baozhu, did you have another argument with Old Qu?\" Qi Sheng walked beside Zheng Baozhu and quietly asked, \"I can tell that Old Qu is not in a good mood today.\"Zheng Baozhu also glanced at Qu Zhang's back and shook her head, saying to Qi Sheng, \"No, yesterday I even praised him as unprecedented and unparalleled.\"Qi Sheng was puzzled, \"Unprecedented and unparalleled? That's a good phrase. Why is he upset then?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"Maybe it's because my emphasis was on 'unparalleled'.\"Qi Sheng: \"........\"Miss Baozhu is quite humorous, haha.Zheng Baozhu successfully entered the venue with Qi Sheng and Qu Zhi. The last time she came here, the sales office looked cold. But today, it was decorated with flowers, ribbons, and balloons, as if it were a children's festival.There were also plenty of fruits and snacks prepared at the sales office today. Zheng Baozhu followed them inside and eagerly stuffed a piece of chocolate into her hand. As soon as the clock struck ten, the boss came out and cut the ribbon, and the high-end individuals efficiently proceeded to the buying process.Since the properties were already completed, most people selected a few options they liked and then asked the sales staff to take them to visit those properties in person. The sales staff in charge of assisting Qu Zhi and Qi Sheng handed them a few forms and placed them on the table, \"Please fill out the forms and provide the intent deposit. After that, I can take you to visit the properties.\"Zheng Baozhu was eager to see the properties in person, so when she heard the sales staff's instructions, her eyes brightened.Qu Zhi and Qi Sheng were serious about purchasing a property, so they quickly filled out the forms and provided the intent deposit. After completing the formalities, the sales staff led the three of them outside and onto a tour bus. Zheng Baozhu often saw tourists riding this type of bus in Starlight Park, but she didn't expect it to be used in the real estate industry as well.After Qu Zhi boarded the bus, he sat alone on one side, resembling a child sulking in a corner.Although the sales staff was curious about the mysterious relationship between the three of them, they refrained from asking. Seizing the opportunity during the journey, the sales staff handed each of them a set of property information and began to professionally introduce the details.When Zheng Baozhu reviewed the information earlier, she was particularly interested in the penthouse with a loft. It had a total area of over 300 square meters, which was beyond Qi Sheng's consideration. But seeing Zheng Baozhu's interest, the sales staff took them to have a look.Since Qu Zhi and Qi Sheng were accompanied by the same sales staff, they had to go together. The environment of the community was pleasant, with well-maintained greenery, and the actual presentation was as impressive as the scale model. The sales staff took them to the top floor in the elevator and introduced the property, \"Since the penthouse units are directly accessible by elevators, stepping out of the elevator leads to a private garden, which can be arranged according to your preferences. There's also an elevator that goes to the housekeepers' quarters at the back. I can show it to you later.\"The top-floor unit had a particularly good view. Just as advertised, it offered a panoramic of Starlight Park. Zheng Baozhu was especially envious of the large terrace where one could roll around.\"This layout has two master bedrooms. The convertible space here can be used as a guest room, nursery, or study, depending on your needs for reading or work,\" the sales staff led them upstairs and continued, \"There's also a rooftop garden upstairs. Although it doesn't have the same large terrace as before, it is positioned higher, offering an even better view.\"Zheng Baozhu enthusiastically followed him upstairs to the garden he mentioned. Although it was still unfinished, she could already imagine how beautiful it would look with a conservatory!\"I really love this layout! A spacious and bright living room; the master bedroom's walk-in closet is also large enough!\" Zheng Baozhu expressed her excitement.Qi Sheng also had a longing look. Although this penthouse unit exceeded his budget, who wouldn't want a bigger house!\"Just a pity it's a bit expensive...\" Qi Sheng lamented.Hearing his comment, the sales staff said, \"Because of the larger area, the total price is naturally higher. However, with the government subsidies for your purchase, it's still quite cost-effective. If you like it, I suggest you secure it directly. These penthouse units are in high demand, and if you wait too long, they might be gone.\"Zheng Baozhu became anxious upon hearing this. She would only be able to secure a spot in the second batch, but would there still be penthouse units available by then?\"Um, can you hold this penthouse unit for me?\" Zheng Baozhu smiled at the sales staff, \"I can provide a larger deposit.\"The sales staff looked hesitant and replied, \"It's not that I'm unwilling, but I truly can't hold it. As you can see, many other people are also looking at the property. Whoever makes the payment first will get the penthouse unit.\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"Well, it doesn't necessarily mean that someone else will take it. I know you have many unspoken rules. Please think of a solution for me. There must be a way...\"\"I'll take this penthouse unit,\" Qu Zhi, who had been silent throughout the journey, suddenly spoke up.Everyone in the room was momentarily stunned. It took the sales staff a couple of seconds to react before energetically asking, \"Mr. Qu, have you decided to purchase this penthouse unit?\"\"Yes,\" Qu Zhi nodded and looked toward Zheng Baozhu, smiling, \"Do you really like this penthouse unit? It's mine now.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"............\"Qu Zhi, you sly dog!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let's go and have a look. Maybe there's something even better!\"He crazily signaled the sales staff with his eyes, and the sales staff, understanding the hint, nodded repeatedly. \"Yes, let's go and have a look at other units.\"Although the sales staff said that, there were only a limited number of penthouse units available, and some of them had already been sold. The choices were quite limited. Zheng Baozhu followed the sales staff and looked at two more units, but she couldn't tell if it was just her imagination or not, she felt that they weren't as good as the previous one.\"Are these really the same?\" Zheng Baozhu furrowed her brows and asked.The sales staff replied, \"Yes, these units I'm showing you are the same layout as the previous one, just in different buildings, so the view might be slightly different.\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"No wonder, I felt that the view from the previous building was the best.\"The sales staff remained silent.Qi Sheng pulled Zheng Baozhu aside and tried to console her, \"Miss Baozhu, you don't need to be angry with Qu Zhi. The more you get angry, the happier he'll be, right? Besides, think about it, the penthouse units are so popular that even if Qu Zhi doesn't buy one, someone else will buy it in a minute. If someone else buys it, then you truly won't have a chance at this property. But if Qu Zhi buys it, you can still visit in the future!\"\"...\"What's going on? Why did his words actually make some sense?\"Also, Qu Zhi originally didn't plan to buy such a large area. Now he'll have to pay off the mortgage for many more years,\" Qi Sheng glanced at Qu Zhi and said to Zheng Baozhu, \"You see, just to provoke you, he's willing to spend so much money.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu remained speechless.Should she feel honored?But when she thought about how Qu Zhi would have to carry the burden of the mortgage for many more years, she did feel a lot more at ease in her heart.\"Little Qi,\" Zheng Baozhu looked at Qi Sheng, filled with appreciation, \"Listening to your words is as good as listening to a wise saying. I feel much happier now.\"\"...As long as you're happy.\"After spending so much time looking at penthouse units, Qi Sheng finally managed to reconcile the conflict between the two of them. They could finally go and look at regular floor units. Since Qu Zhi chose Building Eight, Qi Sheng also planned to buy a unit in Building Eight for the convenience of visiting Qu Zhi. The sales staff led them back to Building Eight, where the layout of the regular floor units was actually the same as penthouse units, with the exception of an additional mezzanine floor. Qi Sheng didn't have any objections to the layout and primarily chose a lower floor before finalizing the purchase of the property.They still had a lot of procedures to handle, so Zheng Baozhu didn't join them for the rest. They went to the sales office, completed the necessary paperwork, and then drove back to the hotel. As they walked through the lobby, the front desk attendant, Xiao Yu, informed Zheng Baozhu that there was a package for her.\"Thank you,\" Zheng Baozhu took the package and glanced at it. Surprisingly, it was sent by the sales department of the Golden Jade Mansion. They must have used the contact information and address she provided last time. Curiously, she opened the envelope and found an invitation inside.It wasn't an invitation for purchasing a property; it was an invitation to a cocktail party.The event was scheduled for tonight at the private club of the Golden Jade Mansion. The sales staff also sent a text message, sincerely inviting her to attend. Zheng Baozhu blinked and decided to call the sales staff back, \"Hello, may I ask what kind of cocktail party is happening tonight?\"The sales staff's end was quite noisy, probably due to the opening event and being busy.\"Hello, is this Ms. Zheng? Well, tonight's cocktail party is primarily for our property owners and customers like yourself who have registered with us.\"\"Oh... Is it a celebration for the opening?\"\"Not entirely,\" the sales staff found a quieter spot and explained, \"As you know, our property targets both high-end talents who meet certain criteria and entrepreneurs like yourself. This cocktail party aims to let both sides get to know each other. After all, business eventually involves product conversion, and that requires financial support. People with funds can also take the opportunity to explore any good investment projects at the party.\"Zheng Baozhu understood the meaning, \"Oh... I see. You've done a great job.\"The sales staff smiled and said, \"This cocktail party is also supported by the government. It serves as a platform to connect both parties. Consider it a chance to have fun and make some friends.\"\"Alright, I'll be there on time,\" Zheng Baozhu agreed.The cocktail party was scheduled to start at 6 p.m. Zheng Baozhu selected a white evening gown from her closet and matched it with a set of necklace, earrings, and a ring. She adorned herself with the jewelry before heading downstairs to the restaurant for lunch.At 5:30 p.m., Zheng Baozhu had already dressed up in her exquisite attire, ready to attend the cocktail party. The private club hosting the event had taken them on a tour today, showcasing its magnificent and luxurious decorations, living up to its name [Golden Jade Mansion] in a splendid way.When Zheng Baozhu arrived, there were already several cars parked outside the club. She found a parking spot for her car and stepped out, walking into the venue wearing specially matched silver high heels.The heating in the venue was set to a comfortable level, so Zheng Baozhu didn't feel cold despite her attire. Although it was not yet six o'clock, guests had already arrived and were chatting in small groups. With just one glance, Zheng Baozhu spotted Qu Zhi not far away, dressed in a suit. Though she didn't want to admit it, his face was indeed outstanding, and he always stood out in a crowd, catching one's attention at first sight.Qu Zhi was surrounded by people. Zheng Baozhu didn't know if they were his colleagues or executives with an interest in his research. She didn't intend to approach him for a conversation and instead found a place for herself, taking a dessert to taste.Casually standing there, she attracted the attention of others. She neither looked like a researcher at a technology park nor a high-level executive in the business world. Instead, she appeared more like a popular celebrity, as if she was walking the red carpet from the dessert table.Qi Sheng heard people discussing celebrities and looked around. Indeed, he spotted Zheng Baozhu. At that moment, Zheng Baozhu was smiling and talking with several men in suits across from her. Qi Sheng walked up to them with a glass of champagne and called out, \"Miss Baozhu.\"Zheng Baozhu turned around and, seeing it was Qi Sheng, smiled lightly and nodded at him. The people across from her, realizing a friend had arrived, stopped interrupting and went to chat with others while holding their wine glasses. Qi Sheng glanced at them, then walked up to Zheng Baozhu and asked, \"Who were those two people just now? Your friends?\"\"No,\" Zheng Baozhu shook her head, \"I just met them at the cocktail party. One is Manager Liu, the other is Manager Zheng. Interestingly, we share the same surname, haha.\"Glancing at Qi Sheng, who was also dressed in a suit, she asked him, \"Are you here as a sponsor too? I heard that you're involved in developing guide robots for the visually impaired?\"Qi Sheng replied, \"Qu Zhi is primarily responsible for the guide robots. Currently, funding is not an issue because we're working in cooperation with the municipal government and metro stations. It can be considered a semi-charitable project.\"This surprised Zheng Baozhu. She had always thought they were developing alternatives to guide dogs, providing one-on-one service for the visually impaired, \"Are you going to deploy guide robots at metro stations?\"\"Yes, if it proves successful, it will make traveling by metro much more convenient for visually impaired individuals in the future.\"\"Wow, that sounds great,\" Zheng Baozhu asked, \"Why are you still seeking sponsorships then?\"Qi Sheng replied, \"Well, our company needs a few profitable projects as well. I have developed a delivery robot, which still has demand in the market. So, I'm here to see if any potential investors are interested.\"Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow playfully, \"You actually have delivery robots?\"\"Yes,\" Qi Sheng nodded, \"Why? Are you interested, Ms. Zheng? I think your hotel could buy a few. They could even deliver takeout to your guests in the evenings.\"\"That does sound good,\" Zheng Baozhu pondered, \"But my employees have strong opinions about delivery robots.\"\"It shouldn't be a problem,\" Qi Sheng said, \"After all, employees have their off-duty hours, but our robots never stop working as long as they have power!\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu fell silent for a moment, \"You're quite persuasive, but I don't think you'll make any sales today, right?\"\"We're still in negotiations. In order to sell the robots, I even brought Qu Zhi here today,\" Qu Zhi didn't like these kinds of occasions, so it took a lot of effort to convince him to come to this cocktail party.Zheng Baozhu glanced at Qu Zhi, who stood there with a cold expression, and clicked her tongue, \"What's the use of having him here? With that face of his, even if you close a deal, he might ruin it for you.\"\"You just don't understand,\" Qi Sheng said mysteriously, \"He's good-looking, you know. By bringing him here, we can attract bosses like you.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Qi Sheng appeared to be someone capable of achieving great things, willing to sacrifice his colleague to sell the robots.\"I'm going to the restroom,\" Zheng Baozhu put down the dessert in her hand and informed Qi Sheng before walking towards the restroom. Suddenly, she felt a pain in her abdomen and mentally calculated her menstrual cycle, thinking it shouldn't be happening now. She quickly checked in the restroom and discovered that her period had indeed arrived early, and unfortunately, it stained her underwear!... Zheng Baozhu felt like the ground should open up and swallow her.She looked at herself in the mirror, realizing it was very noticeable. If she walked out, everyone would immediately see it.Trapped by her period in the restroom. :)She needed to borrow clothes from someone to temporarily cover up, but she only knew Qi Sheng and Qu Zhi at this cocktail party. Qi Sheng...though they got along well, it would be awkward to ask him for help with this. As for Qu Zhi...Help! Zheng Baozhu suddenly realized that this had happened before, didn't it? Wasn't it during her sophomore year in high school?She was also trapped in the restroom by her period, it was Qu Zhi who came to her rescue with spare clothes, wasn't it??...Stay calm, Zheng Baozhu. If this has happened once before and Qu Zhi already has the experience, then he must be used to it.She took out her phone, intending to message Qu Zhi, but then realized she didn't have his phone number or WeChat.\"...\" Zheng Baozhu silently opened her class group and searched for Qu Zhi's profile picture among all her classmates. She clicked on it and sent a friend request.Qu Zhi heard the notification sound from his phone and glanced down.Zheng Baozhu was requesting to add him as a friend.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQu Zhi knew that Zheng Baozhu was also attending the cocktail party tonight, but neither of them had any intention of approaching each other. Now he suddenly received a friend request from Zheng Baozhu. Qu Zhi instinctively looked around the venue.He didn't see any trace of Zheng Baozhu.Knowing Zheng Baozhu well, he understood that she wouldn't send him a friend request unless something happened.He clicked [accept], and Zheng Baozhu's message quickly arrived.\"I'm trapped in the restroom at the venue. Can I borrow your clothes for a moment?\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"It was such a concise sentence, without stating the reason why she was trapped in the restroom or explaining what she needed his clothes for, but Qu Zhi somehow understood.After all, lightning does strike twice. :)He still remembered when he was a naive high school sophomore, he never could have imagined that he would encounter Zheng Baozhu by the restroom door during a physical education class break.Zheng Baozhu, at that time, also didn't expect that after waiting at the restroom door for half an hour, hoping for someone to pass by, she was been surprised to hear footsteps and see Qu Zhi's face.Zheng Baozhu was taken aback, and Qu Zhi was also momentarily stunned, but then he continued walking as if nothing had happened.\"Qu Zhi!\" Zheng Baozhu called out, stopping him. Qu Zhi hesitated for a moment but eventually stopped and looked at her.Zheng Baozhu looked at Qu Zhi's school uniform jacket with envy in her eyes, \"Um, can you take off your school uniform and lend it to me?\"Their school wasn't very strict about wearing uniforms, except for the weekly flag-raising ceremony when it was mandatory. The rest of the time, students were free to wear their own clothes. Fashionable as Zheng Baozhu was, she disliked wearing the uniform, but today, for the first time, she felt the uniform offered a sense of security.Qu Zhi remained silent for a moment. Zheng Baozhu's gaze made him contemplate\u2014what should one do when encountering a rogue by the restroom door?Zheng Baozhu was already in a hurry at this point. Seeing Qu Zhi's indifferent reaction, she wanted to reach out and snatch his clothing. Qu Zhi instinctively moved away, not expecting that someone would be lying in wait at the restroom entrance to rob him. Zheng Baozhu, acting as the robber, chased after him for two steps but suddenly realized something and swiftly retreated back to the safety of the restroom, seemingly as if fearing that leaving this protective circle would bring some unfortunate consequences.Initially, Qu Zhi found Zheng Baozhu's behavior perplexing. However, as he turned to retreat into the restroom, he accidentally noticed the red stain on Zheng Baozhu's clothes.\"...\"Suddenly, everything became clear to his naive mind.Without uttering a word, Qu Zhi took off his jacket and threw it to Zheng Baozhu, then without looking back, he entered the men's restroom.Zheng Baozhu instinctively paused for a moment, then immediately put on the school uniform, zipping it up.Qu Zhi was tall, so his school uniform completely covered Zheng Baozhu's body. Zheng Baozhu was finally liberated from the restroom's confinement and quickly ran out. She found Meng Yaxin, who was engrossed in watching a match, and tugged at her forcefully, \"Meng Yaxin.\"\"Baozhu, you finally came back. Zhuo Haoyu just scored a goal...\" Meng Yaxin stopped mid-sentence, only then realizing that the uniform Zheng Baozhu was wearing didn't belong to her, \"Where did you get the school uniform from?\"\"It's Qu Zhi's.\"Upon hearing that name, Meng Yaxin exaggeratedly covered her mouth, \"What? Why are you wearing Qu Zhi's school uniform?\" She raised an eyebrow, implying something, \"You two...\"\"You're overthinking it,\" Zheng Baozhu firmly interrupted her, \"I have something else to tell you.\"When Qu Zhi returned to the scene, he saw Zheng Baozhu whispering something into Meng Yaxin's ear. After hearing it, Meng Yaxin shook her head at first, but then seemed to have thought of something. She took Zheng Baozhu and went to find another student in their class.The three students gathered together, engaged in a hushed conversation, and this time, the other student nodded. The three of them walked towards the restroom together.\"...\"Sometimes, Qu Zhi hated how smart he was. He had actually understood the silent performance they just had. But it was the first time he learned that students could borrow things from each other in this way.The loud conversation at the party brought Qu Zhi back to his thoughts. He lowered his head and looked at the message Zheng Baozhu had just sent him. He replied, \"Wait for me.\"Zheng Baozhu's phone, which she held in her hand, made a \"ding\" sound. She quickly checked the message and felt relieved.After a while, footsteps could be heard at the entrance. It wasn't the sound of high heels, but rather the sound of leather shoes stepping on the floor.Cough, cough.Someone outside lightly coughed twice and softly called, \"Zheng Baozhu.\"Zheng Baozhu quickly ran out and saw Qu Zhi wearing a light gray waistcoat in the corridor, holding the suit jacket that he had been wearing earlier.\"Thank you!\" Zheng Baozhu didn't say much, she just took the jacket from his hand and quickly moved to lean against the wall.Qu Zhi: \"...\"Back in the room, when Zheng Baozhu put on the jacket, she discovered a packet of sanitary pads in the suit pocket. The simple and elegant packaging had the words \"ultra-thin\" written on it, and there were a total of five pads inside.... Zheng Baozhu didn't dwell on how Qu Zhi got these as she silently took out one pad.Qu Zhi stood in the corridor and waited for a while until Zheng Baozhu came out wearing his suit jacket. The suit fit him perfectly, but now that it was on Zheng Baozhu, it looked oversize on her.Zheng Baozhu once again noticed the difference in size between men and women. Qu Zhi's suit completely covered her body; the shoulders were much wider, giving the outfit a powerful presence.The two of them stood at the restroom door, the atmosphere slightly awkward. Qu Zhi didn't say anything, while Zheng Baozhu, in her \"I'm not awkward, awkward is for other people\" mode, smiled at him nonchalantly and said, \"I'll go back first. I'll wash your jacket and return it to you.\"\"Okay,\" Qu Zhi responded casually and walked out with her, \"I'm leaving too.\"\"Alright,\" Zheng Baozhu didn't ask if he succeeded in impressing closing any deals, she just wanted to leave as soon as possible. They walked through the crowd, attracting some curious glances, especially towards the jacket she was wearing, which sparked people's imaginations.Qi Sheng, who was busy selling the robot, also caught sight of them. He was also filled with curiosity, but could only watch them leave the party.After leaving the venue, Zheng Baozhu finally sighed with relief, and Qu Zhi lightly hummed beside her. He spoke up, \"I never expected that in my short twenty-five years of life, I would encounter you getting trapped in the restroom twice.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu remained silent.Qu Zhi continued, \"So many years have passed, yet some people have only grown in age, not in maturity. History always has surprising similarities.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but speak, \"Aren't you going a bit too far? It was just an accident.\"Qu Zhi looked at her and said, \"Don't tell me you can't even remember your own menstrual cycle?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"You don't think it's always on time every month, do you?\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Seeing him speechless, Zheng Baozhu smiled playfully and said, \"As an elite talent like you, you must have heard of hormonal imbalances, right?\" She clicked her tongue and continued, \"I'm sure my hormonal imbalance is all because of you, getting on my nerves.\"\"...Ha.\"Zheng Baozhu unlocked her car and glanced at Qu Zhi beside her, \"I drove here. Do you want to ride together?\"Qu Zhi took a moment to assess the situation and asked, \"Did you drink alcohol just now?\"\"No, do you want to come or not?\" Zheng Baozhu opened the car door and got in. Qu Zhi stood outside for a second before following her into the car.He didn't sit in the front passenger seat but chose the backseat. Zheng Baozhu didn't question it; in fact, it suited her preferences. She took out a pair of flat shoes that she always kept in the car, bent down to change them, and Qu Zhi curiously glanced at her, \"What are you doing?\"\"Changing shoes.\"Qu Zhi raised an eyebrow unexpectedly and said, \"I didn't expect you to have a sense of safety.\"\"Yes, indeed. After all, there are very few like me, losing even one is a huge loss to the world.\"\"...\"After driving back to the hotel, Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi walked in together. Xiao Yu, who saw them entering together, widened her eyes in surprise. Liang Huihui, who had just finished work, was also in the lobby and her eyes widened along with Xiao Yu's.Both Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi had good appearances. They had just come from the cocktail party, dressed in sophisticated suits and formal attire. This scene could easily be inserted into any idol drama, and it would make the bullet comments flood with comments like \"They're killing me!\"Liang Huihui and Xiao Yu also felt the same way.Moreover, Zheng Baozhu was wearing a men's suit jacket, and it was clearly the one borrowed from Qu Zhi!\"Miss Baozhu, Mr. Qu, what's going on with you two?\" Liang Huihui couldn't contain her curiosity and asked. Zheng Baozhu paused for a second, smiled, and explained, \"Oh, we just came back from the cocktail party. I felt a bit cold, so Qu Zhi lent me his jacket.\"\"Oh, I see,\" Everything sounded reasonable, and Liang Huihui believed it without any doubts. When Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi entered the elevator, she excitedly exclaimed to Xiao Yu, \"Miss Baozhu and Mr. Qu are such a perfect match! When they walked in just now, they looked even better than the idol dramas I've seen!\"\"Yeah, absolutely!\" Xiao Yu echoed, \"And isn't Qu Zhi so handsome! I'm totally shipping this couple!\"\"I'm shipping them too!\"Unbeknownst to Zheng Baozhu, her employees were already shipping her with her archenemy. Once she returned to her room, she immediately busied herself with tidying up. After finishing her toiletries, she picked up Qu Zhi's suit and examined it. Although there were no stains, it still needed to be cleaned. The fabric looked high-quality, so she decided to take it to the shop where she usually cleans her formal wear.Lying on the bed, Zheng Baozhu felt much more comfortable. Now she had the time to check the messages on her phone and found that the wages from the set were already paid. She received a total of 220 yuan.\"Wow!\" Zheng Baozhu felt somewhat happy. Although the amount wasn't much, it was the first money she earned as an actress. Being an extra on a set wasn't easy, and the pay was not even comparable to a regular job in a factory, but there were still many people fighting for chances in the Film and Television City.Perhaps it was because everyone still had dreams in their hearts.Zheng Baozhu inexplicably felt something, looking at the framed composition on the wall. The handwriting was childish, but every stroke was written with seriousness: \"Keep up the good work, future star!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn't post frequently, and his most recent posts before returning to China were about the several potted green plants he kept on the balcony.Zheng Baozhu couldn't believe that this seemingly cold-hearted straight guy would actually like green plants, and they were all the refreshing kinds....Is this what a straight guy does?Even more surprising, Qu Zhi's mom, Su Mingxi, was actively commenting on every one of his posts about the green plants, sharing her experiences with nurturing them!Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"In ancient times, this would be considered collaborating with the enemy. :\uff09\"I'm not looking at this anymore!\" Zheng Baozhu locked her phone and tossed it aside, covering herself with the blanket to go to sleep.Since she didn't manage to grab any extra roles today, she had no plans to go to the Film and Television City tomorrow. She slept until 8 o'clock, then went downstairs to have breakfast in a deep-colored outfit.The hotel had hosted a tourist group from out of town yesterday, consisting of older uncles and aunties. As Zheng Baozhu walked downstairs, the group was still having breakfast in the restaurant. The tour guide, holding a small loudspeaker, stood at the entrance and shouted, \"Attention, everyone! We will gather at the entrance at 8:30, so please finish your breakfast on time.\"Passing by the tour guide, Zheng Baozhu sat at the only available table in the restaurant. Just as she sat down, Qu Zhi also came downstairs. It seemed he didn't expect the restaurant to be so crowded today. He paused for a moment before looking for a place to sit.After scanning the room, he decided to sit across from Zheng Baozhu, holding a tray of food.As Zheng Baozhu was eating her steamed egg, she glanced at him and then continued with her meal. Qu Zhi drank his freshly poured hot milk but didn't initiate any conversation.An auntie who was sitting next to them initiated a warm conversation, \"Are you two together?\"Ahem.Zheng Baozhu choked on her steamed egg and raised her head to smile at the talking auntie, \"Auntie, you've misunderstood. I'm the owner of this hotel, and he's just a guest staying here.\"\"You're the owner of this hotel?\" The auntie looked surprised and pulled her friend over to take a look, \"Xiao Chen, look, she's the owner of the hotel we're staying at, and she's so young and beautiful.\"The so-called Xiao Chen also showed enthusiasm, \"Indeed, young people nowadays are really impressive. And the guy next to you is your boyfriend, right? He's so handsome, you two are a perfect match!\"\"I'm not her boyfriend, Auntie,\" Misunderstood again, Qu Zhi couldn't help but explain, \"I'm also a guest staying at the hotel.\"The auntie who initiated the conversation said, \"But I saw you looking around and then sitting down next to the hotel owner. If you two don't know each other, then you must be interested in her.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi was quite impressed by this auntie's logical thinking, \"We are old classmates.\"\"I knew it!\" The auntie gleefully signaled to her companion that she was right, looking as if she had made a brilliant deduction, \"Young man, where do you work?\"\"At the Science and Technology Park.\"\"Oh, the one nearby?\" The auntie's eyes lit up even more, \"Our tour guide told us that the place is filled with high-end talents brought in by the government. If you work there, your IQ must be very high.\"Another auntie chimed in, \"If you two get married and have children, won't they be both good-looking and intelligent?\"Qu Zhi & Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Aunties' vision often surpasses that of the sharpest investors.\"Auntie, that's not necessarily true,\" Zheng Baozhu grabbed a tissue and began explaining to the aunties, \"I know a child whose parents are both professors at a top university, which means they are very intelligent, right? But this child's academic performance is quite poor! He ranks last in his class in exams!\"\"...\"This child seemed to have challenged the aunties' perception, they looked incredulous, \"Is that even possible? Is he really their biological child?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She wanted to explore a scientific question, but the aunties turned it into an ethical, moral dilemma.Qu Zhi said, \"From an evolutionary perspective, intelligence is inherited from the previous generation, which also requires a 'tax'. It's similar to income tax \u2013 the higher the income, the higher the tax.\"The aunties looked puzzled by this \"tax theory\", so one of them asked, \"Where does that tax go?\"\"It goes to benefit the general population. I'm sure you've heard of cases where parents with low education levels have genius children, right?\"\"\u2026That, wait a minute,\" the auntie waved her hand and regained her ground, \"The examples you mentioned are exceptional. In most families, smart parents have smart children, right? Young man, what do your parents do?\"Qu Zhi paused and replied, \"They work in scientific research.\"\"You see!\" The auntie gave a triumphant look, \"You've clearly inherited your parents' intelligence!\"Zheng Baozhu on the side quietly said, \"But perhaps you've heard of the regression to the mean phenomenon? It's when from one generation to the next, intelligence declines. Each generation is smarter than the previous, but when it reaches the peak, the intelligence starts to regress.\"She paused for a moment, adding a mystical touch, \"So, in the next generation, the intelligence might plummet to the bottom.\"Auntie: \"...\"Zheng Baozhu looked at Qu Zhi and said, \"He might have reached the peak of his family's intelligence now, his next generation might be very dull, just like the child I mentioned earlier. So, for the sake of the next generation, staying single might be better for him.\"Auntie: \"...\"Are young people nowadays so crazy about not getting married and having children??At this moment, Auntie Xiao Chen spoke up, \"Oh well, whether the child is intelligent or not is uncertain, but your child will definitely be good-looking! That's for sure, right?\"The auntie who initiated the conversation nodded repeatedly, \"Yes, Xiao Chen is right. Even if this young man's intelligence reached its peak, aren't you there to balance it out?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"?\"Auntie, what do you mean??Qu Zhi chuckled on the side. Zheng Baozhu tugged at the corner of her mouth, forcing a laugh as she explained to the auntie, \"Auntie, don't judge me based on my appearance. I took the college entrance exam when I was under seventeen and passed with high marks.\"This was truly unexpected for the auntie, her gaze carried a hint of hesitation, \"Really? You took the college entrance exam when you were sixteen?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu maintained her smile, \"I skipped a grade in elementary school because I was too outstanding.\"This statement was half true and half false. It was true that Zheng Baozhu had skipped a grade, but the reason was not that she was too outstanding; it was because she wanted to get away from Qu Zhi. Ever since Qu Zhi tattled about her dream to her mother, Zheng Baozhu considered him her archenemy. How could a normal person study with their archenemy in the same class, let alone sit at the same desk?!In the third grade of elementary school, Zheng Baozhu had a clear understanding that she needed to get rid of Qu Zhi through her own efforts. So, she decided to transfer to another class.Obviously, her request to transfer was rejected by both her parents and teachers. But who was she? She was Zheng Baozhu, not afraid of difficulties, and believed that there were always more solutions than challenges!So, she decided to skip a grade.According to the school's system, as long as she passed the skip-a-grade exam, she could move up a grade smoothly. This time, the teacher and parents didn't oppose it as much, and they agreed to let her take the exam. After all, if she didn't pass, there would be no significant loss.Zheng Baozhu studied hard for a semester and successfully entered the fifth-grade classroom in the new school year, only to find Qu Zhi sitting next to her...This feeling, who could understand it? :)Qu Zhi's parents also asked him why he wanted to skip a grade. Was it because he couldn't bear to be separated from Zheng Baozhu?At that time, Qu Zhi answered this way, \"How can I let Zheng Baozhu surpass me and become my senior?\"Thinking about the past, Zheng Baozhu still felt a surge of emotions in her heart. She gently pressed her lips and smiled to soothe herself.\"There are five minutes left, uncles and aunties. Please tidy up and gather outside,\" the tour guide shouted again with his small megaphone. The two aunties finally stopped chatting with Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi, said their goodbyes with laughter, and left the restaurant.Zheng Baozhu calmly picked up her spoon and continued eating her breakfast. Once the table next to them was cleared by Liang Huihui, Qu Zhi took his tray and moved there. He also asked Liang Huihui, \"Do you know if Starlight Park sells green plants?\"Liang Huihui nodded, \"Yes, there is a large flower market in Starlight Park where they sell all sorts of flowers and plants. Mr. Qu, do you want to buy some green plants?\"\"Yeah,\" Qu Zhi replied, \"I want to put them in my room.\"Liang Huihui thought for a moment and offered to help, \"How about I take you there later? I'm about to finish my shift.\"Qu Zhi seemed a bit surprised and looked at her, \"You will take me there?\"\"Yes, you know, the flower market is always full of tourists, and they tend to overcharge. If I go with you, I can help you bargain. I'm good at bargaining!\" Liang Huihui said enthusiastically.This made Qu Zhi consider her offer, \"Wouldn't that be too much trouble for you?\"\"Not at all! I'll finish soon after you finish breakfast!\" Liang Huihui quickly made the arrangement, then went to tidy up the table.Zheng Baozhu had been eavesdropping on their conversation since it started. Despite all her instructions to keep a distance from Qu Zhi, why couldn't she get them to listen?!Zheng Baozhu sighed deeply in her heart.When Liang Huihui finished her shift, both Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi had finished breakfast. Liang Huihui changed back into her regular clothes and was ready to take Qu Zhi to the flower market when Zheng Baozhu joined in, \"You guys are going to the flower market? I want to buy some green plants too, I can drive you both there.\"\"That's great, thank you, Miss Baozhu!\" Liang Huihui happily agreed as she was originally planning to take Qu Zhi on a tourist shuttle to the flower market. Although Starlight Farm and Starlight Park were not far apart and had dedicated shuttle services between them, it wouldn't be convenient if they had to carry many plants.Once Zheng Baozhu's car approached, Liang Huihui quickly opened the back door and got in. Qu Zhi paused briefly at the car door handle but eventually went to the front and opened the passenger's door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As long as one had a thick face, there wouldn't be any awkwardness.Zheng Baozhu snickered to herself and adjusted her seatbelt before driving off.Throughout the journey, there was no conversation between Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi, but Liang Huihui, who was sitting in the back seat, was still very excited\u2014it was like sitting in the VIP section and witnessing a celebrity couple!Starlight Park was famous for its large-scale cultivation of various flowers and special architecture. The flower market was located near the flower fields, attracting visitors and locals alike who came to buy flowers and plants.Finding a parking spot was not easy, but after Zheng Baozhu managed to park the car, the three of them strolled through the flower market together. Although it wasn't springtime, the flower market still offered a wide variety of plants, from small and delicate ones to large plants worth thousands of yuan. Qu Zhi picked two pots of green plants from a store, Zheng Baozhu took a glance at them\u2014indeed, they were of the fresh and delightful kind.He seemed to have a special preference for this type of green plants.The shop owner asked for seventy yuan for the two pots, but Liang Huihui immediately protested, \"Boss, selling one pot for thirty-five yuan is too expensive. We'll take both pots for forty yuan.\"The shop owner wasn't pleased either, \"Your price is too low; I can't accept that, little girl.\"\"Come on, boss, it's not my first time here. Two pots with plants usually go for about thirty-five yuan, and your price is too high. I'll give you forty yuan for both.\"\"Forty yuan is really too low; I'd lose money.\"\"How is that possible? You're trying to deceive me. Okay, how about I add five yuan, making it forty-five?\"After haggling back and forth with the shop owner, they finally settled on a deal for fifty yuan for both pots. Liang Huihui saw that he wouldn't go any lower, so she said, \"Alright, then give me a few more saucers as a bonus.\"\"One saucer for each pot.\"\"Come on, don't be so stingy. Saucers are not worth much.\"The shop owner replied, \"How are they not worth much? The saucers are five yuan each!\"\"That's not worth much. It's only a few yuan!\"\"...\"Then why are you wasting my time by arguing with me over a few yuan?!In the end, Liang Huihui managed to get both pots of green plants and four saucers for fifty yuan, and she was somewhat satisfied with her bargaining skills. Qu Zhi walked ahead, carrying the green plants he purchased, and continued to browse around. Zheng Baozhu and Liang Huihui followed from behind. Unable to resist, Zheng Baozhu said, \"Huihui, you're good at bargaining. How about helping me bargain when I go shopping?\"\"Sure!\" Liang Huihui nodded in agreement, \"But, Miss Baozhu, can one even bargain at the places you shop at?\"\"...\"It seemed like she couldn't.Liang Huihui looked at her and couldn't help but gossip, \"Miss Baozhu, you said you and Mr. Qu don't get along, but you still brought him here. You even said you two aren't...\"\"Enough!\" Zheng Baozhu quickly interrupted Liang Huihui's words, \"I came here not for him, but for your sake!\"\"For me?\" Liang Huihui was taken aback by this statement and looked at Zheng Baozhu in confusion.Zheng Baozhu explained, \"I already told you to stay away from Qu Zhi for your own safety. But you didn't listen. How could I let you go out alone with him? You're still deceived by his appearance and haven't seen his true colors!\"\"...\"Liang Huihui thought for a moment and then looked panicked, \"Miss Baozhu, you don't think I like Mr. Qu, do you?\"\"Isn't that the case?\" Look at how warm you are to Qu Zhi all day long and offering to bargain for him.Growing up with Qu Zhi, Zheng Baozhu knew very well how troublesome he could be. With Liang Huihui's innocence and naivety, it was normal for her to fall for him!Liang Huihui waved her hands in alarm, \"I don't like Mr. Qu at all. I'm just a fan of the CP!\"\"...What?\"\"...I mean, I already have a boyfriend!\" Liang Huihui looked at Zheng Baozhu, afraid that she might misunderstand, \"Please don't get the wrong idea, Miss Baozhu!\"After a long silence, Zheng Baozhu finally snapped out of it, \"What? You have a boyfriend? Who is it? Why have I never heard you mention him??\"\"Uh...\" It was true that Liang Huihui had never mentioned having a boyfriend to anyone before. But since the topic came up today, she didn't want Zheng Baozhu to misunderstand, so she explained, \"He's a guy from the same town I used to live in. He's now studying at H University, so you've never met him.\"Liang Huihui's hometown was a small town and her family's conditions weren't good. Her academic performance was average, so after graduating from high school, her family asked her to start working directly. Zheng Baozhu understood all of this. Though Liang Huihui didn't have a high education, she was clever and hardworking, with a strong sense of responsibility. So, as the hotel owner, Zheng Baozhu had high hopes for her.However, the news of her having a boyfriend from her hometown was something Zheng Baozhu had never heard before, \"Huihui, tell me honestly, did your grades suffer because of your puppy love with that boyfriend during high school?\"\"...\"Liang Huihui never expected that even as a working member of society, she would still be asked about her high school grades, \"It's not that, it's just that I'm too dumb. Li Yifan didn't have any problems with his grades. He even got into H University!\"\"...\" Isn't this even more unfair!\"Huihui, you're not dumb at all. You learn things quickly.\"\"Thank you, Miss Baozhu, for the compliment.\"\"So it's really because of the puppy love. There must be some truth in the high schools' rule against dating!\"\"...\"\"Your boyfriend, Li Yifan, he didn't graduate yet?\"\"No, he's doing well academically. He's preparing to take the postgraduate entrance exam!\"\"Oh... So his family's financial situation should be okay, right?\" Even in a small town, there were some well-off families. Since Li Yifan's family supported him to pursue postgraduate studies, it should be because they could afford it.Liang Huihui shook her head, \"No, it's just slightly better than my family's.\"\"What about his tuition and living expenses in H city? The expenses are not low, is he working while studying?\"\"He has scholarships and financial aid, he also works part-time. But this year, he's been focusing on preparing for the postgraduate exam and can't afford to be distracted.\"\"Then...\" As Zheng Baozhu was speaking, something suddenly crossed her mind, \"Wait, Huihui, you are usually so frugal, you don't even go out for meals. You didn't give him all the money you saved, did you?\"While Zheng Baozhu paid her employees well, she noticed that Liang Huihui lived quite a modest lifestyle, always trying to save money. She assumed Liang Huihui saved it for herself, but now she wondered if Liang Huihui had given it all to her boyfriend.Liang Huihui scratched her head, feeling a bit embarrassed, \"I don't really have many expenses. Li Yifan needs to maintain a good diet for his preparation, and as you said, living in H city is costly...\"\"...So you really gave him all your money?\"Liang Huihui nodded.After a moment of silence, Zheng Baozhu spoke again, \"Then maybe you do like Qu Zhi after all.\"Liang Huihui: \"...\"Meanwhile, Qu Zhi stopped in front of a pot of green plant and gestured to Liang Huihui. She immediately understood and ran over to help him negotiate the price.Considering the fact that he would be moving houses soon, Qu Zhi exercised restraint and only bought three pots of green plants. Before leaving the flower market, he spotted a small pot of Pilea Peperomioides and decided to buy it for his office desk.Zheng Baozhu, on the other hand, chose the pot of Mentha Suaveolens.As the three were about to leave the flower market, Qu Zhi suddenly stopped. Liang Huihui thought he had spotted another green plant he liked and followed his gaze. However, she saw a stray dog lying at the entrance of a shop. The shopkeeper was not present, and the dog seemed to be guarding the shop.\"What's wrong, Mr. Qu?\" Liang Huihui looked at Qu Zhi with suspicion. Could it be that he took a liking to this dog? Dogs were not for sale, though.Zheng Baozhu also noticed the dog and burst into laughter, \"Hahaha, no way! After all these years, Qu Zhi, you're still afraid of dogs?\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Seeing him remain tense without saying anything, Zheng Baozhu teased him further, \"So many years have passed, yet some people have only grown in age, not in bravery. History always has surprising similarities.\"Qu Zhi: \"............\"Zheng Baozhu really held grudges. :)At this point, Liang Huihui finally understood that Qu Zhi wasn't interested in the dog; he was afraid of it.\"Mr. Qu, this dog is tied up and won't bite. It's safe,\" reassured Liang Huihui.Qu Zhi: \"...\"Being comforted like this made him even more embarrassed.Standing on the side, Zheng Baozhu enjoyed the sight of Qu Zhi's embarrassment, \"Are you so scared? Should I hold your hand like when we were kids and go over there?\"Qu Zhi pursed his lips, glanced at Zheng Baozhu, and walked forward while holding the green plants. The dog remained calm and curious, observing them without giving them any trouble.As they were about to pass by the shop, Zheng Baozhu took advantage of Qu Zhi's fear and suddenly barked loudly in his ear: \"Woof woof woof!\"Qu Zhi was startled, and in one jump, he leaped about a meter away, still holding the green plants.Zheng Baozhu stood in place, laughing uncontrollably, \"Hahaha, that was hilarious! Your jumping ability is quite impressive!\"Qu Zhi: \"............\"\"Zheng Baozhu, are you crazy?!\" Qu Zhi couldn't hold back his frustration any longer. Liang Huihui, who was following them, also felt complicated about the situation. Is this what childhood friends are like?Indeed, it's different from an ordinary CP.\"Woof woof woof!\" This time, the dog really barked. Qu Zhi no longer cared about being angry with Zheng Baozhu. He quickly turned and walked away. On the return journey, Qu Zhi swiftly chose the back seat, asking Liang Huihui to sit next to Zheng Baozhu.As Zheng Baozhu drove, she cheerfully told Liang Huihui, \"You know, Qu Zhi was scared by a small dog on our street when he was a child. Thinking back now, it's still so funny. That dog was really tiny...\"\"The smaller the dog, the more they tend to bite, don't you know that?\" Qu Zhi interjected coldly from the back seat.Zheng Baozhu responded with an \"Oh,\" and asked, \"So, was that the reason you cried for half an hour?\"\"When did I cry for half an hour?\"\"Oh, then for twenty minutes?\"Qu Zhi: \"............\"He refused to engage in this conversation anymore.Upon returning to the hotel, Zheng Baozhu was still laughing. Qu Zhi took his green plants from the trunk and walked away without wanting to spend an extra second with them. Zheng Baozhu and Liang Huihui followed him into the hotel. As they entered the lobby, they heard some squabble.\"What's going on?\"Zheng Baozhu walked towards the lounge area next to the front desk. Manager Wei, whom she personally promoted, noticed her return. He adjusted his glasses on the bridge of his nose as he looked at her and said, \"Miss Baozhu, you came back just in time. This gentleman here was about to complain about us because he couldn't catch any dolls in the claw machine.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 15": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWei Zhen was one of the first employees hired\u00a0after the hotel's opening and also a management talent nurtured by Zheng Baozhu herself. It was because she had a capable assistant like Wei Zhen to help manage the hotel that Zheng Baozhu could pursue her dreams in the entertainment industry with peace of mind.It was not uncommon for hotels to receive customer complaints, but raising a complaint because the claw machine couldn't catch a doll? Zheng Baozhu was curious to see who this gentleman was and why he was so passionate about it.In the lounge area in front of the claw machine, there were two young men standing there. The man was wearing a black sheepskin jacket with a big collar and had short brown hair, giving off a handsome vibe. The one next to him seemed younger, dressed in a matching outfit, like a college student who hadn't graduated yet.Zheng Baozhu's eyes lightly swept over the two individuals and walked up to the man with a smile, \"Sir, are you the one who wants to complain about us?\"The man looked her up and down before asking with a slight tilt of his head, \"And who are you?\"\"I am the owner here. You can tell me if you have any questions,\" Zheng Baozhu replied.\"The owner?\" The man seemed surprised that the owner of the place was a young and beautiful woman. He was momentarily stunned and then pointed to the claw machine behind him, \"You came just in time. I want to complain that you are using this claw machine to cheat customers by making it impossible to catch the dolls!\"He said it with such seriousness, as though he already had concrete evidence of their deceptive practices. Qu Zhi didn't rush to leave; he put down the green plants and leaned casually against a nearby pillar, waiting to see how Zheng Baozhu would handle this challenge.Zheng Baozhu remained composed and gestured to the wall decorated with photos next to the claw machine. She said to the man in front of her, \"Have you seen those pictures? These are all the dolls that our customers have caught. There's also a whole wall full of dolls in my room, all of them were caught by myself using the same claw machine you're pointing at now.\"\"...\" The man looked at the entire wall full of dolls caught by Zheng Baozhu and coldly snorted, \"As the owner, you must have adjusted the claw machine to its maximum strength, so you can easily catch the dolls, right? Do you think I don't know how it works?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"So you think that I adjusted the settings and that's why you can't catch the dolls?\"\"Of course!\" The man firmly believed that Zheng Baozhu, the unscrupulous owner, tampered with the claw machine, \"Otherwise, with my skills, I would have emptied the machine in minutes. Do you really think nobody's watching your business? I'm calling to complain about you right now!\"\"Haha!\" Zheng Baozhu laughed and looked at the young man standing beside him, \"Is it you who wanted to catch the dolls in the claw machine?\"The young man nodded in agreement; Zheng Baozhu looked back at the man with a clear understanding.Isn't this just a case of a man trying to show off in front of the young man but failing and then venting his anger on them?Men. Heh.Zheng Baozhu smiled at the young man and asked, \"Which one do you want?\"The young man pointed to a rabbit inside the claw machine and said, \"That rabbit.\"Zheng Baozhu walked up to the machine, inserted a coin, skillfully manipulated the controls a few times, and deftly grabbed the rabbit with one claw, placing it securely at the exit.It all took less than ten seconds.The man: \"...\"Wait, what just happened?Zheng Baozhu bent down, took out the rabbit, and handed it to the young man, \"Here, it's yours.\"\"Wow,\" the young man exclaimed with delight, \"Thank you, boss!\"\"You're welcome,\" Zheng Baozhu smiled and turned to look at the man, \"This gentleman, it seems like your skills weren't good enough.\"The man: \"...\"\"Did you tamper with the machine?\" The more the man thought about it, the more he felt that he was making sense, \"This is your hotel, and you are so familiar with the machine. You must have tampered with it when I wasn't paying attention!\"\"Haha!\" Zheng Baozhu stepped aside, giving the man a stage to perform, \"Then why don't you try again? I'll let you play for free.\"\"Pff, who cares if it's free?\" The man sneered repeatedly, \"Do you think I can't afford this little money? If you have the guts, let's compete somewhere else, not in your hotel. I'll pick another place.\"Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow, \"Compete in what?\"\"Compete in catching dolls, but not in your store. We'll choose another place,\" the man, Tan Yao, said as if he wanted to redeem himself, \"If you win, we're done with this matter. If you lose, I'll make sure your hotel gets enough complaints to shut it down!\"Zheng Baozhu chuckled, \"Sure, why not?\"Let's see who loses face in the end.Tan Yao saw the smug look on the other person's face and intentionally added a harsh remark, \"Don't get too cocky. Believe me, I'll make you look bad in a moment.\"\"Look bad?\" Zheng Baozhu casually swept her hair behind her ear and gave him a slight smile, \"From childhood till now, Zheng Baozhu has never looked bad.\"Tan Yao: \"...\"The rest: \"...\"Well... that's convincing.For fairness, the location of the competition was chosen by Tan Yao. There was a large chain claw machine store in Starlight Park with lots of new dolls, including collaboration items with popular IPs.Zheng Baozhu had no objections to Tan Yao's choice. Firstly, it was close to their hotel, and secondly, this chain store had a guarantee mechanism. If a customer failed to catch a doll within a certain number of attempts, the staff would directly give that doll to the customer.Zheng Baozhu thought this kind of store was suitable for someone like Tan Yao, who had a big addiction to catching dolls. If he lost, it wouldn't be too embarrassing, and he might even get a guaranteed doll.They all went to the claw machine store together. Qu Zhi was also dragged along by Liang Huaihui to watch the fun.As soon as the store owner saw so many people coming in, he thought it was some big client. However, when he raised his head and saw Zheng Baozhu, his face turned pale with fright, \"Miss Baozhu, why are you here again? Don't you have a claw machine in your hotel? You can just catch them there!\"Liang Huaihui considerately provided some background information, \"Before we bought the claw machines for our hotel, Miss Baozhu used to come here to catch dolls. She was so skilled that the owner almost printed her photo with the word 'stop' at the entrance.\"Tan Yao, who was ahead, overheard their conversation and felt a bit uneasy. His cousin pulled his sleeve and whispered, \"Cousin, let's forget about it. After all, the shop owner already gave me a doll.\"\"How can we do that?\" Tan Yao refused to back down, \"This is about justice. We can't let innocent customers be deceived. Clearly, their machines have issues, and who knows how many people they've cheated already? We can't let more innocent customers be harmed!\"Zheng Baozhu paid no attention to their small talk and just smiled at the shop owner, \"This gentleman is here to compete with me in catching dolls.\"The shop owner looked at Tan Yao as if he was looking at a brave warrior, \"Young man, why are you so reckless?\"\"... What do you mean by that?\" Tan Yao looked at him suspiciously, \"It seems like the both of you are in cahoots, aren't you?\"Zheng Baozhu scoffed, \"You chose this location yourself.\"The shop owner couldn't be happier, \"If you think we're in cahoots, you can go to another shop. There's an amusement park ahead. Why don't you go there to catch dolls?\"\"...\"Tan Yao looked around the shop and decided to stay. There were plenty of doll machines inside. He picked two and said to Zheng Baozhu, \"Let's go with these two. Whoever catches more dolls in ten minutes wins.\"The shop owner quickly calculated in his mind. How many dolls will this Zheng Baozhu catch in ten minutes?\"I think three minutes is more appropriate. It's shorter but more exciting!\" the shop owner suggested.Tan Yao nodded and accepted the proposal.They started their game together as the shop owner timed them. In less than a minute, Zheng Baozhu had already caught a doll, causing heartache for the shop owner.As time passed second by second, Zheng Baozhu had already caught three dolls, while Tan Yao was still trying to catch his first one. He finally managed to position the doll properly and felt confident that he could succeed this time when the shop owner suddenly called, \"Time's up! Let go of the claws!\"Zheng Baozhu released her grip, and as soon as the claws let go, the doll fell precisely into the chute.Zheng Baozhu scored another win.\"Four to zero!\" the shop owner announced loudly.\"...\" Tan Yao felt defeated on the spot.There must be an issue with the doll machines in this shop! He would complain together with others!\"Hey, cheer up,\" Zheng Baozhu took one of her winnings and handed it to Tan Yao, \"This doll is for you. Be happy.\"Tan Yao: \"...\"\"And this one is for you,\" Zheng Baozhu also gave a doll to Tan Yao's cousin and another one to Liang Huihui who came along, \"This is for Huihui.\"Qu Zhi was standing next to Liang Huihui. Seeing him, Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment, then hugged the last doll to her chest, \"That's it.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Ha.Finally, the farce came to an end, and the shop owner quickly escorted Zheng Baozhu out. Though Tan Yao was unwilling, he kept his promise and didn't bother Zheng Baozhu again. When they returned to the hotel, Meng Yaxin happened to be coming back from the strawberry field with a large basket of strawberries.Seeing everyone holding a doll, she curiously asked, \"Where did you guys go? Why is everyone holding a doll?\" Then she noticed Qu Zhi empty-handed and asked, \"Why doesn't Qu Zhi have one?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"Because I'm not that childish.\"Zheng Baozhu chuckled and handed her doll to Meng Yaxin, \"This one is for you. I just caught it.\"\"Wow, really? Thank you!\" Meng Yaxin happily took the doll and then remarked, \"But don't you have a doll machine here?\"\"That's a long story,\" Zheng Baozhu glanced at the strawberries Meng Yaxin had just picked, \"Are those all from your picking?\"\"Yes, I've tried them, and they're so sweet! Why don't you take some to enjoy?\"\"Sure.\"\"How about you, Qu Zhi? Take some as well.\" Meng Yaxin was much more considerate in this matter and didn't intentionally leave Qu Zhi out.\"Thank you,\" Qu Zhi thanked and then lifted the potted plants he bought earlier, \"I'll go up and put these things away first.\"After he left, Zheng Baozhu took a small bag of strawberries and returned to her room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the morning, they were running around outside, but in the afternoon, Zheng Baozhu lay on the bed resting until evening when Meng Yaxin sent a message to go down for dinner.Meng Yaxin had been having a great time at the Starlight Farm these past two days. She went to the strawberry field in the morning to pick strawberries and spent the afternoon with a group of children at the ranch, watching cows. She even rented a small plot of land on the farm and said she would come to take care of it every week.As working professionals couldn't come to the farm every day to tend to their vegetables, Starlight Farm also offered a hosting service. For a fee, they could have someone take care of their plot regularly. Zheng Baozhu thought of it as an \"intellectual tax\" because she couldn't see much difference between this and farmers growing vegetables and then you buying them at the market. But she hadn't expected that there were many people rushing to pay this \"tax\".\"You don't understand. This is something engraved in the DNA of our Chinese people,\" Meng Yaxin shrugged, refusing to admit that she was subjected to this \"intellectual tax\".\"Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu didn't bother arguing further; it wasn't her money anyway. As they chatted, Zheng Baozhu's phone alarm suddenly went off. Meng Yaxin was startled and looked with her chopsticks in her mouth, \"What did you set the alarm for at this time? Reminding you to have dinner?\"Zheng Baozhu shouldn't be so obsessed with work that she would skip meals, right?Zheng Baozhu turned off the alarm and quickly entered the background casting group, \"At this time, they will post the casting notice in the group. I missed it yesterday, I can't afford to miss it again today!\"\"Oh,\" Meng Yaxin didn't expect that posting a casting notice in a group was as competitive as snatching seconds in a sale, \"There's so much competition even for foreground roles?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"There are only one or two casting notices in the group each day, but there are hundreds of people waiting for them. Do you think the competition isn't fierce?\"Meng Yaxin: \"...\"She couldn't understand. With that effort, why not try to find a role directly at the studio?\"It's here,\" the group admin's announcement message was posted, and Zheng Baozhu quickly pasted her pre-written response, \"Yes! I'm the first today!\"\"... Congratulations to you.\"While Zheng Baozhu and Meng Yaxin were having dinner, Tan Yao was singing at the KTV with his brothers.On the sofa was the stuffed doll that Zheng Baozhu gave him today.\"I didn't expect Brother Tan to be sentimental,\" one of his brothers picked up the doll that Tan Yao had placed on the sofa, \"How strange.\"\"Tsk, don't make it dirty,\" Tan Yao took the doll back and placed it on the other side. The brother couldn't help but laugh, \"What's going on? Is this doll a gift from your friend? Wait, when did you make new friends? Why didn't I know about it?\"Someone nearby informed him, \"Today, Brother Tan took his little cousin to the Starlight Farm to play. He competed with a boss there in catching dolls; he lost with a score of zero to four. He hasn't recovered from the embarrassment yet.\"\"Hahaha, tell me more!\"\"Don't mention it. He was really embarrassed today. It's a pity I was not there to witness it, hahaha.\"Tan Yao: \"...\"What kind of friends did he have? :)\"Stop laughing!\" Tan Yao stood up from the sofa, took the microphone in his hand, and announced, \"I've made up my mind. Sooner or later, I will make Zheng Baozhu fall for my charm!\"Others exchanged comments like watching a show:\"Oh, are you planning to pursue her?\"\"But what does she see in you? Your skill in catching dolls?\"\"Hahaha.\"\"...\"Tan Yao shook his head, trying to exude charm desperately, \"Can't she like me for being handsome? I refuse to believe I can't win her over.\"He lost face today, but he was determined to regain it tomorrow!Tan Yao wasn't joking. Early the next morning, he went to the Starlight Farm to find Zheng Baozhu.Since he made a fuss in the lobby yesterday, the front desk remembered him, so they quickly brought Manager Wei over when they saw him again.\"Mr. Tan, wasn't yesterday's issue already resolved?\" Manager Wei was wearing a suit and stood straight in the lobby, \"Is there something else you're not satisfied with?\"Tan Yao squinted at Manager Wei and replied off-topic, \"Where's your Boss Zheng? I came to see her.\"Wei Zhen replied, \"Miss Baozhu left early this morning. If you have any business, you can tell me, and I'll do my best to assist you.\"\"Gone?\" Tan Yao obviously didn't expect this result, \"So early in the morning, where did she go?\"Wei Zhen said, \"The boss's schedule is not something we can decide, and I can't answer you.\"Frowning, Tan Yao turned to the front desk and said, \"Alright then, please help me book a room for a month.\"\"?\" Xiao Yu looked hesitantly at Wei Zhen, who nodded, giving permission to arrange it.Xiao Yu proceeded to book a room for Tan Yao and handed him the room card. Tan Yao took the card and headed upstairs.\"Manager Wei, what kind of person is this Mr. Tan?\" Xiao Yu couldn't understand. Was he planning to stay in their hotel for an extended period?Wei Zhen said, \"We don't need to guess a guest's intentions. As long as he doesn't cause trouble or owe room fees, he can stay as long as he wants.\"\"Alright... but why did he come looking for Miss Baozhu?\"Wei Zhen shook his head, \"I'll inform Miss Baozhu; you all should keep an eye on Mr. Tan.\"\"Okay, Manager Wei.\"At this moment, Zheng Baozhu had already arrived at the hotel where the crew was getting their makeup done. As today's assembly time was relatively early, she worried that it might be difficult to get a taxi, so she drove herself.The hotel was right next to the film studio. Zheng Baozhu parked her car before following the signs to find the makeup room of the extras.The makeup room was spacious and bright, clearly belonging to a well-funded production. After learning that they would be shooting a Republican-era drama today, Zheng Baozhu was worried if it would be Sun Jing's crew again, but upon arrival, she realized it was a different one.The makeup artist even complimented her when doing her makeup and hair, making Zheng Baozhu feel good. Although she only had a small role as a nurse, she still couldn't hide her natural beauty.Since today's assembly time was early, the crew provided breakfast for everyone. After finishing breakfast, Zheng Baozhu went outside to wait for the crew's bus to the shooting location. As she walked out of the hotel, she noticed two extras discussing her car.\"Who's that? Driving a Porsche to work as an extra?\"\"...Is this what extras these days drive?\"Zheng Baozhu calmly walked past them, pretending the car was not hers. After a while, the group leader finished counting the number of people and asked the bus driver to depart. The bus drove to the same Republican-era street as before, but today's shooting took place in a hospital.Everyone was queuing to get their costumes, Zheng Baozhu also joined the line to receive a nurse uniform and a child.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"The child was a young actor, wearing a patient's gown, portraying a hospital patient. The group leader explained that, later on, she would be fleeing with the child and needed to show that she was protecting the child while running.Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"Understood.\"The child's mother accompanied the child to the set since they would be shooting scenes with Zheng Baozhu together. The child sat beside Zheng Baozhu the whole time, unlike other children, he was well-behaved and obedient on set. Zheng Baozhu noticed his big, bright, and lovely eyes, making him look very adorable.Perhaps aware that Zheng Baozhu was looking at him, the child turned his head to glance at her and then shyly hid in his mother's arms. His mother asked, \"What's wrong?\"The child looked at Zheng Baozhu and said, \"Big sister looks so beautiful.\"His mother laughed and suggested, \"How about taking a photo with big sister?\"\"Okay!\" The child nodded in agreement.Zheng Baozhu happily agreed to take a photo with the child actor. They took several pictures together. After they finished, she sent one of the photos to Wang Jingyi and wrote, \"Met this adorable young child actor on the set today!\"Wang Jingyi had finished work at 2 AM yesterday, so she didn't take any new acting jobs today. She just woke up and saw Zheng Baozhu's message, \"Wow, adorable! Are you filming another Republican-era drama today? You're a beautiful nurse!\"Zheng Baozhu:Wang Jingyi: Is this for the [Glory] drama set? The lead actress is Teacher Lu Xinci!Zheng Baozhu: Yes![Glory] is a tribute drama. All the actors in the show are well-known veteran actors, making the cast truly star-studded. Take the lead role, Lu Xinci, for example, she won all the Best Actress awards when she was young and is now a prominent figure in the film and television industry even in her forties.Wang Jingyi: I've played an extra on this set before! Teacher Lu Xinci's acting skills are really amazing!Wang Jingyi: And she's still so beautiful! Goddess of the silver screen!Zheng Baozhu: I haven't seen her yet (:\u0437\u300d\u2220)Zheng Baozhu has been on the set for the whole morning but hasn't filmed her scenes yet. After waiting for a while, it started to rain, and many extras were caught in the rain. Zheng Baozhu heard from others that they would receive a rain fee if it rained, but it's only 10 yuan per person, barely enough to buy a packet of instant noodles...Zheng Baozhu: Being an extra is really tough.Just as she sent this message to Wang Jingyi, the director finally called them to start shooting.Zheng Baozhu's role was straightforward; she was a nurse leading the hospital patients to take shelter during an enemy air raid. Many people were playing doctors and nurses, but Zheng Baozhu was the only one assigned to take care of a child, and she had to accompany the child throughout the evacuation.At first, Zheng Baozhu was worried about how to cooperate with the young actor, but after chatting with the child's mother, she found out that this little actor had much more experience in acting than she had expected. :)The child could be considered her senior in the industry.Once filming began, she finally got to meet Lu Xinci, who portrayed a character visiting the hospital to see patients, only to encounter an air raid. They then joined everyone else to take shelter during the air raid.\"Imagine this, outside is the enemy bombing, with the sound of explosions all around, you all must be very scared,\" the director emphasized to everyone, \"You must show that look of terror and fear, understood?\"Everyone replied that they understood and the director officially began shooting. The escape route was pre-planned, so everyone ran in terror along the route. Zheng Baozhu carried the child to prevent him from being bumped or hurt in the chaos and simply held him in her arms.The director shot this scene three times before he was satisfied. Zheng Baozhu felt like she might develop biceps from all the carrying.After the fleeing scenes were done, they moved on to the scene of taking shelter during the air raid. This was a significant scene for the lead character where she would deliver an important speech.Zheng Baozhu, holding the child, crouched behind Lu Xinci. During the scene, the young actor would have to cry, and Lu Xinci would come over and comfort him.In this way, Zheng Baozhu and Lu Xinci had some scenes together. The director had high demands for this part, asking them to portray the emotional transition from fear to hope when hearing the lead's words.\"You must act out this psychological change. Don't just crouch there, act with your expressions when Teacher Lu speaks!\" The director explained. He let them prepare and then officially started filming the scene.There were no real bombings on the set; everything was dependent on the actors' imagination. Everyone performed with a great sense of terror. Some acted as if they were so frightened that they screamed. The child in Zheng Baozhu's arms was also scared and cried loudly, creating a trembling sound.Lu Xinci walked over and whispered a few words to the child, and he stopped crying. However, the sounds of bombing continued outside, filling the tense space with a sense of urgency.It was at this moment that the lead stepped forward to speak. Zheng Baozhu had originally been worried that she might not be able to perform at the level the director wanted, but as soon as Lu Xinci began delivering her lines, she realized she had been overthinking.The \"goddess of the silver screen\" in the film industry was not just a title; Lu Xinci's performance was beyond the reach of many young actors. Her lines were full and realistic, and in just a few lines, she drew Zheng Baozhu into that era.It was as if she had personally experienced living in that era, endured the enemy's bombardments, and witnessed the devastation all around. But even in such dire circumstances, there were always those who resisted, relying on their beliefs to tear open a path in the darkness.It was precisely because of the existence of such people that others could see hope.\"Cut! Excellent!\"When the director called cut, Zheng Baozhu suddenly noticed that her eyes were filled with tears!In the blink of an eye, tears streamed down uncontrollably!The director was so satisfied with the scene that he passed it in one take. Afterward, Zheng Baozhu didn't have any more scenes, but the crew didn't release anyone, so she could only wait on the side. When the crew finished work, it was already 11 PM.Zheng Baozhu calculated that she had already worked overtime today, so she would receive overtime pay. Overall, she could earn more than 300 yuan for a day's work.When the crew's bus returned to the hotel for makeup, it was almost midnight. It was too late for Zheng Baozhu to drive back, so she decided to stay overnight in the apartment she had rented earlier.The next morning, as soon as Tan Yao arrived, he asked the front desk about Zheng Baozhu, and the answer was still the same: she wasn't here. Tan Yao was speechless, \"How come the boss is never around?\"The front desk responded, \"Because she's the boss.\"\"...\"This logic was indeed irrefutable.\"Do you know where she went?\"The front desk shook their head, \"I don't know, maybe she went home.\"Before coming here, Tan Yao had considered that things might not go smoothly. He also considered that Zheng Baozhu might initially reject him. However, he never imagined that after a whole day and night had passed, he couldn't even see Zheng Baozhu!He decided to leave the hotel and stopped waiting there.When Zheng Baozhu returned, it was already past 10 AM. Upon seeing her, Xiao Yu immediately told her, \"Miss Baozhu, the man who caused a commotion because of the claw machine, Tan Yao, has booked a room in the hotel for a month. He has been inquiring about your whereabouts.\"Zheng Baozhu had already heard about this from Wei Zhen, but she didn't pay much attention to it since she had been on the set all day yesterday. Now, Xiao Yu mentioned it again, she finally had time to pay attention to it, \"What does he want from me? Does he still want to complain about the hotel?\"\"No,\" Xiao Yu shook her head, looking at Zheng Baozhu, \"I think he seems to be interested in pursuing you.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"This seemed more terrifying than his complaints about the hotel.\"Stop talking nonsense, it's not good to say such things in broad daylight.\"Xiao Yu: \"...\"Zheng Baozhu went upstairs to change her clothes, then had a brief meeting with Wei Zhen before going to the restaurant for lunch.In the restaurant, Meng Yaxin and Qu Zhi were sitting together and eating. When Zheng Baozhu saw them, she raised an eyebrow and approached them, \"You two seem to get along well?\"Meng Yaxin smiled and said, \"We just happened to have lunch together in the restaurant. When we ran into each other, we decided to eat together,\" she pulled Zheng Baozhu to their table, \"I heard you didn't come back last night?\"\"Yeah,\" Zheng Baozhu replied, \"I stayed at the rented apartment near the film studio.\"Meng Yaxin knew about her rented apartment, so she didn't ask further, \"Did you finish filming late yesterday? It seems to be going smoothly this time?\"\"Too smoothly! It was the best performance I've ever given!\" Zheng Baozhu spoke excitedly about the filming process yesterday, \"I was on the same set with Lu Xinci, the big senior. Her acting was so amazing that it effortlessly led me into the scene.\"Although Lu Xinci wasn't a young star, her name carried weight in the entertainment industry. Even if you weren't a fan, you would still respect her. Meng Yaxin had also seen some of her movies and curiously asked Zheng Baozhu, \"Did you have a scene together?\"\"Not exactly, but I was lucky to witness some intense acting on the set!\" Zheng Baozhu remembered the experience and shivered with excitement, \"It was like I was baptized, you know? Her acting slapped me in the face, even if you were wooden, she would bring out your emotions!\"\"Hmm, it sounds profound, but her acting is indeed top-notch.\"\"It's really amazing!\" Zheng Baozhu sighed, \"After seeing her performance, I realized how far I am from being a good actor. No, I have to take more acting classes.\"\"...\"Meng Yaxin bit her chopsticks, \"Are you really taking this so seriously?\"\"Of course!\"Qu Zhi, who had been silent on the side, took a tissue and stood up from the table, \"I'm done eating, I'll go back to the company first.\"\"Okay,\" Meng Yaxin glanced at him and continued chatting with Zheng Baozhu.When Qu Zhi walked to the lobby, he saw Liang Huihui sitting in the same place where Zheng Baozhu had been interviewed last time, reading and writing. Curious, Qu Zhi walked over to take a look and found that she was studying English vocabulary.Seeing Qu Zhi approaching, Liang Huihui stood up and smiled at him, \"Mr. Qu, is there something you need?\"Qu Zhi shook his head and asked, \"Am I disturbing you?\"\"No, not at all.\" Liang Huihui smiled apologetically, \"I'm just taking the opportunity of having no work this afternoon to catch up on my assignments.\"Qu Zhi was somewhat surprised, \"You're still studying?\"\"Not exactly,\" Liang Huihui shook her head, \"It's the classes that Miss Baozhu signed us up for!\"Now Qu Zhi was even more surprised, \"Zheng Baozhu?\"\"Yes, since we often have foreign tourists here, Miss Baozhu signed us up for English classes,\" Liang Huihui explained, \"It's a video-based course, we can watch it whenever we have free time; it's very flexible. But the teacher checks our assignments weekly, and if we don't complete them, Miss Baozhu will be informed of it!\"\"Oh, I see...\"\"And there's also a makeup class!\" Liang Huihui gestured as she spoke, \"Because the service staff and front desk staff need makeup, Miss Baozhu specifically signed us up for makeup classes. When I first came here, I really didn't know anything and looked very unsophisticated, but now I can do beautiful makeup!\"Qu Zhi didn't say anything; he seemed to be pondering something. Liang Huihui couldn't stop praising Zheng Baozhu, \"Mr. Qu, have you noticed that most of the hotel's staff are youngsters? Miss Baozhu could have easily recruited people who already knew English and makeup, but she still gave us a chance! She said that even if we don't stay here in the future, having these skills will make it easier for us to find jobs elsewhere. She's such a good person! Not only is she beautiful, but she also knows everything. I hope I can be like her in the future!\"Qu Zhi was momentarily taken aback. In his eyes, Zheng Baozhu was nothing more than someone who knew how to look good; he hadn't thought she would be seen as an inspiring figure. He hadn't expected that she could do the things Liang Huihui just mentioned.\"Mr. Qu, are you alright?\" Liang Huihui noticed him standing there lost in thought and waved her hand in front of him.\"It's nothing,\" Qu Zhi snapped out of it and replied to Liang Huihui.When Zheng Baozhu came out of the restaurant, she saw that Qu Zhi was trying to hit on her female staff member!Qu Zhi was so persistent that it made Zheng Baozhu feel exhausted.\"Huihui, what are you doing here?\" Zheng Baozhu approached Liang Huihui and asked.\"I'm studying vocabulary here!\" Liang Huihui replied.\"Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu glanced at her and saw that she was indeed studying, which relieved her a little, \"By the way, I heard from Wei Zhen that everyone is going to sing tonight. Since you're not on the night shift today, do you want to join us?\"Liang Huihui thought for a moment but shook her head, \"No, thank you. I'd better study more vocabulary. My foundation is not good, so I need to spend more time on it.\"Zheng Baozhu observed her and said, \"Are you doing it to study vocabulary, or to save money?\"Liang Huihui replied, \"I'm really doing it to study vocabulary!\"\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu casually responded, then changed the topic, \"By the way, about the boyfriend you mentioned before, which university in H city does he attend?\"\"H University. Is there something wrong?\" Liang Huihui asked.\"No,\" Zheng Baozhu smiled at her, \"Have you visited him before?\"Liang Huihui nodded, \"I visited him once last year, but this year he's preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination, and he said I would disturb him if I visited, so I didn't go.\"\"Oh... Then...\"Zheng Baozhu wanted to say something, but Liang Huihui picked up her books and retreated, \"Miss Baozhu, I won't disturb you and Mr. Qu anymore!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Qu Zhi tugged at the corner of his mouth and was about to leave. Zheng Baozhu called out to him from behind, \"Hey, Qu Zhi, wait a moment, I want to ask you something.\"Qu Zhi turned back and asked, \"What is it?\"Zheng Baozhu casually picked up an orange from the table and sat down on the sofa, \"Sit down, let's talk.\"Qu Zhi pursed his lips and walked over to sit on the opposite sofa.As Zheng Baozhu peeled the orange, she spoke to him, \"Huihui has a boyfriend in H city who is still studying and she sends her entire salary to him every month. From a man's perspective, do you think this guy is reliable?\"Qu Zhi asked, \"Is it the boyfriend you mentioned earlier, the one who wants to take the postgraduate entrance examination?\"\"Yes, that's him.\"\"He's not reliable.\"\"Exactly!\" Zheng Baozhu agreed with Qu Zhi for once, \"I also think he's not reliable, but I'm afraid of jumping to conclusions about him.\"\"There's nothing to hesitate about. A man who is in his twenties and still relies on his friend's salary to live has some serious issues.\"\"But he's busy preparing for the entrance exam...\"\"When I was studying abroad, I worked also part-time while studying, and it didn't affect my studies.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Although she didn't believe in that Li Yifan, Qu Zhi's remarks were a bit harsh.\"I think his brain is probably not as good as yours...\"\"If his brain isn't good, why is he taking the entrance exam?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"This academic genius is quite assertive.At this time, Tan Yao sneaked back inside.As soon as he entered, he saw Zheng Baozhu sitting on the sofa and quickly ran up to her, \"Miss Baozhu, you finally came back.\"He noticed the man sitting opposite Zheng Baozhu, who looked extremely handsome, and instantly became alert, \"Who is this guy?\"Zheng Baozhu ate another slice of orange, \"He's a guest here. Yesterday, he even witnessed you losing to me with a score of zero to four. Don't you remember?\"Tan Yao: \"...\"He did remember, but there was no need to bring up the four-zero loss again.Upon learning that the man wasn't Zheng Baozhu's boyfriend, Tan Yao relaxed his guard a bit. Zheng Baozhu glanced at Tan Yao and asked, \"I heard you were looking for me. What's the matter?\"Tan Yao smiled sheepishly, \"It's nothing major, I just wanted to ask you to be my mentor and teach me how to catch dolls.\"Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow, \"Aren't you the one who claimed to be an expert? Why do you need me to teach you?\"\"Well, there will always be someone better than you. There's always a sky beyond the sky,\" Tan Yao humbly replied.Zheng Baozhu considered for a moment and said, \"Alright, I can do that, but I don't have much time, and I'll charge you for it.\"\"Sure, everything will be according to your terms,\" Tan Yao said, feeling triumphant. He didn't believe that Zheng Baozhu, who would now be in close contact with him, wouldn't be captivated by his charm!Seeing Zheng Baozhu eating oranges, Tan Yao asked politely, \"Miss Baozhu, do you like this type of orange?\"Zheng Baozhu answered, \"Not particularly.\"Qu Zhi snorted lightly and spoke, \"It's just convenient, you can peel it with your hands without needing to use a knife.\"Zheng Baozhu finished the last slice of orange, \"That's the basic quality of an excellent fruit.\"Qu Zhi gave a faint hum and left.Watching him walk away, Tan Yao had a hunch that Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu's relationship was not simple. However, asking Zheng Baozhu about it right now might cause her to react defensively, so he changed the topic, \"What were you two talking about just now?\"\"Men's topics,\" Zheng Baozhu replied.\"Well, I'm a man too, so why don't you talk to me about it?\" Tan Yao suggested.Zheng Baozhu glanced at him and asked, \"Do you know anyone at H University?\"\"As a matter of fact, I do!\" Tan Yao snapped his fingers, \"My cousin, the one who came here to play with me yesterday, is a student at H University!\"Zheng Baozhu's eyes lit up; she hadn't expected to casually find the right person who can help her.\"In that case, help me inquire about someone, and in return, I'll teach you how to catch dolls for free.\"\"Sure,\" Tan Yao readily agreed, \"Who do you want me to inquire about?\"\"A person named Li Yifan.\"Zheng Baozhu didn't know much about Li Yifan, but she shared what she knew with Tan Yao, thinking she would ask Huihui for more information later. Xiao Yu and Liang Huihui were standing at the front desk, watching Zheng Baozhu and Tan Yao whispering to each other, and Xiao Yu became even more convinced of her guess, \"I was right. This Mr. Tan must be interested in Miss Baozhu.\"As a CP fan of Zheng Baozhu-Qu Zhi, Liang Huihui felt threatened, \"What should we do? Will Mr. Qu's position be in danger?\"Xiao Yu said, \"I don't think so.\"Liang Huihui was still worried, \"Although Mr. Qu is Miss Baozhu's childhood friend, this Mr. Tan is like a gift from the heavens! I've heard people say that childhood friends can't compete with gifts from the heavens!\"Xiao Yu shook her head disapprovingly, \"Huihui, you only know one aspect of it. Mr. Qu is not an ordinary childhood friend; he's a gift-from-the-heavens type of childhood friend! Being a gift-from-the-heavens type means having both the attributes of a childhood friend and a gift from the heavens, making him unbeatable!\"\"Oh!\" Liang Huihui felt more relieved after hearing this explanation.As long as the CP doesn't become a BE1, it's good.Passing by, Meng Yaxin saw the two of them whispering and curiously approached, \"What are you looking at?\"Liang Huihui greeted her and said, \"Xiao Yu said that Mr. Tan seems to be interested in Miss Baozhu.\"\"Oh?\" Meng Yaxin turned her head to see who this Mr. Tan was.Liang Huihui continued, \"But we just discussed it, Mr. Qu's position is still unshakable.\"Meng Yaxin couldn't help but feel that something was wrong with this statement. She turned back to look at Liang Huihui and Xiao Yu, \"You two don't think Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi are a couple, do you?\"Liang Huihui nodded repeatedly, \"Many of our colleagues at the hotel ship their CP!\"Meng Yaxin: \"...\"Let your colleagues find another CP to ship.Kind of pitiful.\"Well,\" Meng Yaxin leaned in closer to them and whispered, \"Do you know that Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi were high school classmates?\"\"Yes,\" Both of them nodded.Meng Yaxin continued, \"One is beautiful; the other is good at academics. Don't they seem like a perfect match?\"\"Absolutely!\"\"But in our high school, no student thought they were a couple!\" Meng Yaxin shook her head, \"Everyone knew they were childhood friends, but those who liked Qu Zhi didn't envy Zheng Baozhu because the whole grade knew they were incompatible. Their childhood friend, the one who came to see Qu Zhi last time, do you remember her?\"\"You mean Miss Cen?\"\"Yes, that's her. She once declared that if Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu got together, she would eat all the keyboards at home.\"Liang Huihui: \"...\"Xiao Yu: \"...\"\"There are countless CPs in this world; if this one isn't sweet, find another one,\" Meng Yaxin spoke sincerely, \"Don't stick to one choice.\"Zheng Baozhu was unaware of the small meeting between the three of them. Lately, she was focusing all her efforts on improving her acting skills. She had even enrolled in an acting class to watch videos whenever she had spare time. She had initially signed up for an offline class, but now, due to her role as an extra in the film and television studio, she switched to an online training course.The videos were pre-recorded by the teacher and the students practiced along with them. After each session, there would be an assignment for them to record their own performances, and the teacher would review them in the next video.This method, though lacking face-to-face interaction, provided flexibility in scheduling, which was more convenient for Zheng Baozhu. Besides watching videos, she also bought various books, not only related to acting but also directing.Between attending classes and learning on the set, Zheng Baozhu felt that she had made some progress during this period. However, it was apparent that this progress was still far from enough. Her goal was to become an actress like her aunt, Su Ming, and she knew she needed to put in much more effort.When Qu Zhi came to the restaurant for lunch, he saw Zheng Baozhu sitting in her usual spot, wearing earphones, watching videos, and taking notes. He glanced at her and then went straight to the restaurant. After finishing his meal and returning, Zheng Baozhu was still sitting there, but she had already fallen asleep with her head resting on the table.Zheng Baozhu liked to read in this specially arranged study corner. The sofas here were carefully selected for comfort and the books on the shelf were carefully put together one by one. In winter, during a clear noon, sunlight would shine through the floor-to-ceiling windows, and sitting in this cozy space, basking in the sun while reading, made Zheng Baozhu feel content.However, being too comfortable had its consequences, as she easily fell asleep.Qu Zhi stood still for a few seconds, then walked towards Zheng Baozhu. Facing her was a tablet with a video on pause; the teacher's explanation was frozen in an interesting position. The earphones hadn't been unplugged from the tablet and were casually placed on the table. Zheng Baozhu had a book open as a pillow and slept soundly. Surprisingly, the pen she was holding didn't fall down and maintained its writing posture.This scene suddenly reminded Qu Zhi of their high school days. Back then, Zheng Baozhu would sometimes fall asleep on the desk when she was tired of studying. Once she even used her newly written notes as a pillow, and when she woke up, the notes' marks would be imprinted on her face.Thinking of that scene from the past, Qu Zhi felt amused. He took another step forward, lowered his head, and glanced at Zheng Baozhu's book. It was her notebook on acting, filled with colorful notes and even sticky notes in some places.Since the third grade of elementary school, Qu Zhi knew that Zheng Baozhu wanted to be a star.However, he never expected Zheng Baozhu to be so serious about it.Her dedication was far beyond his imagination and much more long-lasting than he had thought.The sunlight from the window quietly fell on them. Qu Zhi picked up a thin blanket from the sofa and gently placed it over Zheng Baozhu's shoulders.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter Qu Zhi left the hotel, he went straight back to the company. The development of the guide robot they were working on was still in progress, and the project was time-consuming, so they had to utilize their lunch break as well.When Qu Zhi returned to the office, most of his colleagues were already working. Qi Sheng's main task recently was to sell the delivery robots, which would generate revenue for the company. He never expected that as a developer, he would also have to take on the responsibility of sales.He thought he was the most troubled person in the company, but as soon as Qu Zhi walked in with a look of deep frustration, Qi Sheng became interested, \"Old Qu, what happened to make you look so upset? Tell me about it, so I can have a good laugh.\"Qu Zhi sighed and replied, \"It's nothing.\"Qi Sheng didn't believe him and prodded, \"Then what's with the gloomy face? What are you thinking about?\"Qu Zhi said, \"Zheng Baozhu.\"As soon as Qi Sheng heard that name, he became even more intrigued, \"What's wrong with Miss Baozhu again?\"A colleague with a low ponytail sitting nearby, who had heard them mention this name frequently lately, asked, \"Is she the one who wants to become a star?\"Qu Zhi paused for a moment and glanced at Qi Sheng, \"What do you think?\"Qi Sheng chuckled nervously, \"Haha, I just said it without thinking...\"The colleague said, \"Wanting to become a star is not a big deal. Stars can dress up beautifully and be adored by so many people, satisfying their vanity easily.\"\"It's not like that,\" Qu Zhi retorted, \"Being a star is still a job, and it's not necessarily easier than other professions. To excel at it, you still need to put in a lot of effort.\"The colleague looked at him in astonishment, seeming surprised by his response.Qu Zhi then took out a rolled-up blueprint and slowly spread it out on the table, \"Let's talk about work. I've received the layout plan of the subway station, and they've drawn it very detailed, but we still need to visit the site in person.\"Collaborating with the subway station to launch the guide robot was a completely new attempt. The subway transportation had made traveling convenient for many people, except for blind individuals who were over ten million. This was the reason why people who take the subway daily would rarely encounter a blind person on the train.According to the relevant regulations of the subway, guide dogs are allowed on the subway, but the process of taking the subway involves many issues that guide dogs cannot solve for their owners. Therefore, visually impaired individuals usually enter the subway under the accompaniment of staff and are then escorted out by waiting staff after arriving at their destination.What Qu Zhi and his team were working on was to develop a guide robot that could replace the staff in performing this task.Qu Zhi attached great importance to this project because it was not merely about developing a robot; it was about integrating the subway, a mode of transportation, into the lives of visually impaired people, enabling them to live better in the city.Time flew by quickly when they were working. When Qu Zhi came back to his senses, it was already quite dark outside. He changed his clothes and left the laboratory, encountering Qi Sheng waiting outside.\"Waiting for me?\" Qu Zhi swiped his card and walked out. Qi Sheng followed him and said, \"Waiting for you to have dinner.\"Qu Zhi snorted, \"I think you're just here to gossip.\"\"... You found me out,\" Qi Sheng replied sheepishly, \"But you seemed a bit unusual today; you were actually speaking up for Miss Baozhu?\"Qu Zhi paused for a moment and said, \"I'm not defending her. I just realized that maybe I did have a little prejudice before.\"Qi Sheng thought in his mind: I think it's more than just a little, isn't it?Seeing Qu Zhi's cold and piercing gaze, Qi Sheng hurriedly continued, \"Can you share your thoughts with me?\"\"...\" Qu Zhi had seen how nosy Qi Sheng could be. If he didn't satisfy his curiosity today, he would bother him for a whole week, \"I heard from Liang Huihui that she signed up for English classes and makeup classes. Would hotel employees start from scratch and learn on the job? Would a real boss do business like this?\"High employee turnover was already common in the service industry. It was very likely that right after training this batch of employees, they might quit. Not to mention that the classes Zheng Baozhu had them enrolled in were not professional skills, but basic skills that employees should already have.\"It's not about doing business; it's about charity,\" Qi Sheng responded after hearing Qu Zhi's explanation, \"She genuinely wants to help her employees.\"Qu Zhi didn't say anything. They fell silent for a while until Qi Sheng broke the silence, \"Miss Baozhu is such a kind person. She should be willing to buy a few of my robots, right?\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"At this moment, Zheng Baozhu was practicing her acting in her room. She could read books downstairs, but when it came to practicing acting, she needed to be indoors and focus. Speaking of reading, she remembered waking up at noon with a thin blanket draped over her shoulders. She didn't know who draped the blanket over her.Probably a hotel staff member.While she was lost in thought, her phone rang. It was a call from Tan Yao. He had been helping her investigate Li Yifan's situation, so they exchanged contact information. Since adding each other on WeChat, Tan Yao messaged her every day, but due to her busy schedule, she mostly ignored him.Today, Tan Yao called directly, Zheng Baozhu guessed that there might be some information on Li Yifan.She answered the call and asked, \"Hello, Tan Yao? What's up?\"Tan Yao's voice came from the other end, \"Miss Baozhu, I found the information on the person you asked me to check. Let's meet and talk about it.\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"I'm busy right now, so just tell me over the phone.\"Tan Yao, who hadn't forgotten his original intention of coming to Starlight Farm to pursue Zheng Baozhu, said firmly, \"If you can't go out, then I'll come to your room to find you.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"After hanging up Tan Yao's call, she decided to make a video call to him.Tan Yao answered with a puzzled expression.On the other side of the video call, Zheng Baozhu smiled at him, \"Now we can consider it a meeting. Go ahead, tell me.\"Tan Yao: \"...\"He hated this high-tech stuff that made human interactions lack sincerity. :)Zheng Baozhu urged him again, and finally, Tan Yao said, \"My cousin asked his classmate, it turns out that this Li Yifan is quite famous in their major. He seems to have good grades and receives scholarships every year. Also, he's dating the department's campus belle.\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback, \"What?\"Tan Yao repeated, \"He's dating the campus belle. According to my cousin, he made quite a scene when he was pursuing her, giving her lots of gifts.\"\"...Oh!\" this time Zheng Baozhu heard it clearly. Just as she suspected, Li Yifan turned out to be unreliable.\"Scumbag!\" Zheng Baozhu had been practicing her lines lately, and her delivery of the words \"scumbag\" was spot on, hitting Tan Yao directly in the face.\"...Are you talking about someone else?\" Tan Yao looked puzzled as he glanced behind him, making sure it wasn't him she was referring to.No matter who it was, it definitely wasn't him.Zheng Baozhu collected herself and asked, \"Are you sure you got the right person?\"\"Absolutely,\" Tan Yao nodded. He wanted to impress Zheng Baozhu and did his best to handle things, so there's no way he made a mistake, \"There's only one Li Yifan in that major, we matched it with the information from the graduate exam. Oh, I also have some pictures taken by my classmates. Shall I send them to you?\"\"Sure.\"Tan Yao ended the video call and sent all the photos of Li Yifan to Zheng Baozhu. He couldn't resist asking, \"Who is this Li Yifan? Your relative?\"Zheng Baozhu didn't want to reveal the matter about Liang Huaihuai, so she made up an excuse, \"Hmm, he's a distant relative.\"After sending that reply, the photos arrived. Apart from individual pictures of Li Yifan, there were also photos of him together with a girl, showing their intimacy. It should be the campus belle Tan Yao mentioned.Zheng Baozhu: Thanks for your help with this matter. Consider it a favor owed to you.Tan Yao: Sigh, it's nothing. Don't be so polite to me.Tan Yao: But if you really want to thank me, that's not impossible.Tan Yao: Recently, there's a new movie released, with good reviews. How about we go watch it?Tan Yao was excitedly talking to himself, but Zheng Baozhu didn't even look at her phone. She was currently contemplating a major issue \u2013 how to tell Liang Huihui about Li Yifan.If she tells her directly, it will definitely hurt her feelings. But if she doesn't say anything, it's not right either. Li Yifan used Liang Huihui's money to pursue someone else, which made Zheng Baozhu extremely angry.\"No, enduring the pain won't do. I'll go find Huihui right now!\" Zheng Baozhu opened the door, ready to talk to Li Huihui directly. However, the moment she opened the door, she hesitated.\"No, this won't do,\" she closed the door and went back inside, \"I can't be so impulsive. I need to tell her, but I have to consider the right way to do it.\"After pondering for a few seconds, she realized there might not be a good method: \"I'll just be straightforward. Regardless of how I say it, the result will be the same!\"She opened the door again with determination but hesitated once more. She closed the door again and retreated back inside.\"She may look carefree, but she's sensitive inside. Will she be able to handle this?\"...Zheng Baozhu was in distress, all because of that scum Li Yifan!No, she has to tell her!Zheng Baozhu opened the door again. Qu Zhi, who was standing in the hallway, had seen her opening and closing the door multiple times. Unable to contain himself, he asked, \"Zheng Baozhu, are you out of your mind? Suffering from mania?\"\"...Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu finally noticed Qu Zhi in the hallway, not knowing when he had returned. She frowned and closed the door again. Two seconds later, she opened it again, with only her head poking out from inside, \"Qu Zhi!\"She called out to Qu Zhi.Qu Zhi glanced at her, gesturing to ask what she wanted to ask.Zheng Baozhu beckoned him over with a wave, whispering, \"Come here.\"\"...\" Qu Zhi's eyebrows twitched slightly. After hesitating for a couple of seconds, he walked over.Zheng Baozhu was standing on the other side of the door, with a half-open door separating them. She didn't step out; Qu Zhi didn't enter.Glancing around the hallway, Zheng Baozhu whispered to Qu Zhi, \"Do you remember I told you about Liang Huihui's boyfriend, Li Yifan?\"\"Uh-huh,\" Qu Zhi nodded gently, \"What happened?\"Zheng Baozhu indignantly said, \"I asked a friend to investigate; he really turned out to be a scum! He spent Huihui's money and pursued someone else at the university!\"\"Hmph!\" Qu Zhi sneered, \"Not surprising.\"Zheng Baozhu frowned, \"But how do I tell Huihui now?\"Qu Zhi asked, \"Do you have any evidence?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu wanted to show Qu Zhi the photos, but realized she had left her phone on the table, \"Wait a moment.\"She quickly went inside to retrieve her phone and found the photos Tan Yao had sent: \"Look, these are pictures of Li Yifan with that girl! It's obvious they have a special relationship, right?\"Qu Zhi glanced at the screen. The two people in the photos did seem intimate, \"You should show these photos directly to Liang Huihui.\"Zheng Baozhu hesitated, \"But wouldn't that be too direct? How much would it hurt Huihui?\"Qu Zhi said, \"The hurt is caused by the situation, not by what you say to her. No matter how tactful you are, the result will be the same; hurt.\"Zheng Baozhu furrowed her brows, thinking Qu Zhi was right.\"Then... the sooner, the better. Let's go and tell her now?\"Qu Zhi raised an eyebrow, \"Us?\"\"Let's go!\" Zheng Baozhu grabbed Qu Zhi's coat and dragged him all the way to the entrance of the restaurant, mustering her courage.Qu Zhi: \"...\"Liang Huihui was currently working the night shift and was still in the restaurant. Zheng Baozhu pulled Qu Zhi all the way there.The employees couldn't help but marvel at the scene they witnessed along the way.Liang Huihui and Qi Sheng were standing at the restaurant's entrance, talking. When Liang Huihui saw Zheng Baozhu approaching, she greeted her cheerfully, \"Miss Baozhu, you're here? Mr. Qi is preparing to book tomorrow's dinner.\"Qi Sheng glanced at Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi's current posture and smiled, \"Tomorrow, the people from the Euro Grand Hotel will come to our company for a visit. Professor Luo asked me to treat them to a dinner in the evening, and I thought it would be convenient to have it here since it's nearby and the food is good.\"Their synchronized conversation caused Zheng Baozhu to momentarily forget the main issue at hand for a second, \"The Euro Grand Hotel? Are they buying your service robots?\"\"Yes,\" Qi Sheng nodded, \"They are a five-star hotel and currently don't have service robots for delivering meals. The demand is considerable. If we can successfully negotiate with them, it will be a substantial deal!\"And Professor Luo had given him strict orders to close the deal.Qi Sheng once again doubted his position in the company.In just a few sentences, Li Huihui also caught the key information, \"Service robots for delivering meals?\"\"Yes,\" at this point, Qi Sheng still hadn't realized the issue.The usual smile disappeared from Liang Huihui's face, her eyes were now filled with wariness and disdain as she looked at Qi Sheng, \"Are you researching service robots for delivering meals? And selling them to various hotels?\"\"Uh...\" Qi Sheng finally realized that something was wrong.\"No, our robots are mainly used for delivering takeout to customers and won't interfere with your work,\" he tried to explain.Liang Huihui asked, \"Can they serve dishes in the restaurant?\"\"Uh... Well, technically, they can.\"Liang Huihui exclaimed, \"You are researching these robots without considering what will happen to humans! We are already competing with each other for jobs, and now we have to compete with robots too! Is there any future left for humans at all?\"Qi Sheng sighed.\"Little sister, please calm down,\" Qi Sheng patiently advised, \"It's inevitable that robots will gradually replace some human positions. Jobs with repetitive and simple tasks, like waiters and bank tellers...\"\"You're even targeting bank tellers?!\"Qi Sheng turned to Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi, changing the topic, \"What are you two doing here?\"Though the conversation had shifted, Zheng Baozhu still remembered the purpose of their visit.\"Uh...\" Zheng Baozhu glanced at Liang Huihui and pulled her towards the window, \"Huihui, look at this. Is this Li Yifan?\"She showed Li Yifan's individual photo to confirm with Liang Huihui. Although the photo was not very clear, it was indeed Li Yifan.\"Yes, Miss Baozhu, how did you get a photo of Li Yifan?\" Liang Huihui asked, a bit puzzled.Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment and then showed Li Yifan's photo with the girl to Liang Huihui, \"I heard from my friend at H University that your boyfriend seems to be dating the campus belle.\"Liang Huihui was momentarily stunned as if she didn't understand what was being said. She just stared at the photo in her hands.Zheng Baozhu was worried that this news might be too devastating and wanted to say something comforting. However, Liang Huihui raised her head and said, \"Miss Baozhu, are they mistaken? This photo doesn't prove anything.\"\"Ah,\" Zheng Baozhu carefully chose her words, \"But Li Yifan is...\"\"Miss Baozhu, I will ask Li Yifan about this,\" Liang Huihui interrupted, \"I'm leaving work now.\"Qu Zhi approached Zheng Baozhu and asked, \"What happened?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"She doesn't seem to believe it and wants to ask Li Yifan.\"Qu Zhi wasn't surprised by this answer, \"When faced with unwelcome news, avoidance is a human instinct. Give her some time.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, still feeling uneasy, \"But I'm afraid Li Yifan will lie again.\"\"He definitely won't admit it easily, but deep down, everyone knows the truth. It's just a matter of whether they are willing to face it,\" Qu Zhi explained.At this moment, Qi Sheng became curious and walked over, \"What are you talking about? What happened to that girl just now?\"Qu Zhi glanced at him, \"If you have spare time, you should think about how to close the deal tomorrow.\"Qi Sheng said, \"I've already thought about this question.\"\"Oh?\" Qu Zhi pretended to be interested.Qi Sheng replied, \"I plan to take you along. I inquired and found out that there's a senior executive on the other side who is coming tomorrow.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"\"Well, Miss Baozhu, I'll leave the dinner arrangement to you!\" Qi Sheng checked the time and said to Zheng Baozhu, \"I'm heading back now!\"Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"Sure, don't worry, I'll take care of it.\"With that, Qi Sheng left, and after he was gone, Qu Zhi intended to go back to his room as well. Before leaving, he glanced at the phone Zheng Baozhu was holding, \"That 0-4 is inviting you to have dinner and watch a movie.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQu Zhi didn't say anything; Zheng Baozhu indeed didn't notice the series of messages from Tan Yao.Moreover, she didn't find anything unusual with the message.\"Oh,\" She finished reading the chat log of the messages Tan Yao had just sent, and replied to him, \"Watching a movie might not be possible, but we can have dinner. Let's eat at our restaurant, my treat.\"Tan Yao, who had been anxiously waiting: \"......\"Not watching a movie was fine, but having dinner at her restaurant lacked the right atmosphere!Tan Yao: What are you busy with every day? I often don't see you at the hotel.Zheng Baozhu: Doing side business.\"......\"Tan Yao hadn't expected her to be so ambitious. At her age, owning a hotel already exceeded the capabilities of many people of the same age.Tan Yao: What kind of side business?Zheng Baozhu: You'll naturally know when I succeed.Tan Yao: ......So mysterious.Zheng Baozhu: Sigh, if I fail, it would be so embarrassing. But if I succeed, I'll make it my main business.Zheng Baozhu: When are you free? I'll treat you to the meal.Tan Yao: I think you're busier than me. Let's go with your schedule.Zheng Baozhu: Okay, I'm not free tomorrow, how about the day after?After Zheng Baozhu finished replying to the message, she looked up, and Qu Zhi was no longer there.When did he leave?Zheng Baozhu raised her eyebrows, took her phone, and went directly to pick up the car. The notice she got tonight required her to gather at five in the morning, so Zheng Baozhu could only go there one night early and stay at the rented apartment.Getting up at five in the morning was quite challenging, especially in cold weather. Zheng Baozhu set five alarms for herself, afraid that she might oversleep. If she missed the gathering, someone else might take advantage of the opportunity.Before going to bed, she double-checked her alarms, set from 4:30 am to 4:45 am, to put her mind at ease and sleep.The next day, when the alarm went off at 4:30 am, Zheng Baozhu felt completely disoriented. After a moment of confusion, the second alarm went off, even louder than the first one.Zheng Baozhu quickly sat up in bed, but before she could fully recover, the third alarm started ringing.Finally, she managed to turn off the alarm and got up to wash up. While brushing her teeth, she couldn't help but think: If I had this kind of determination back in high school, maybe I'd be a highly sought-after talent by the government now; perhaps Qu Zhi wouldn't have snatched the penthouse from me.After washing up, Zheng Baozhu didn't bother with makeup and directly put on a mask before heading out. Initially, she felt compelled to maintain her image, despite knowing that once she was on the set, the makeup artist remove everything and start from scratch. Nevertheless, she still insisted on wearing makeup every day when going out.However, as time went by, she grew more at ease with just wearing a mask, thereby saving the makeup artist some time.The meeting point was near the Film and Television City. Zheng Baozhu drove her car there on time. After parking, she saw Wang Jingyi, who greeted her warmly.It had been a while since the two of them worked on the same set. Wang Jingyi ran over excitedly, teasing Zheng Baozhu about her fancy car.\"Wow, I've heard about people delivering food in a Maserati and setting up a stall in a Maybach, but today, I get to witness someone driving a Porsche while being an extra!\" Wang Jingyi exclaimed.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Rich people sure could be over the top!They joined the group together.\"The crew has prepared breakfast; let's go get it and then head to the makeup room!\" Wang Jingyi hooked her arm around Zheng Baozhu's and led her to queue up for breakfast. The breakfast on the set was simple, soy milk and bread, but at least it was served hot and was quite satisfying.As she was eating breakfast, Zheng Baozhu removed her mask. Wang Jingyi, although accustomed to seeing her without makeup, couldn't help but sigh, \"Your skin is so good! It's so fair and flawless!\"Zheng Baozhu had always had great features, coupled with good skin, which made her look beautiful even without makeup.Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and replied, \"Maybe it's genetic; my family has good skin.\"Wang Jingyi fell silent, realizing that while skincare products and treatments could help to a certain extent, good genes were something that couldn't be imitated or acquired. :)Today, they were filming another historical drama. Zheng Baozhu and Wang Jingyi were playing disciples from the same sect. This time, their costumes were more elegant than the previous fantasy-themed drama, with long flowing sleeves, which added to their charm.Upon arriving at the shooting location, they realized that they were working with Lin Ziqin's crew again!This made Wang Jingyi ecstatic, considering the scenes they were going to shoot today.Both of them were playing two lovestruck disciples. They not only had to interact with the male lead, but they also had to intentionally bump into him!What a stroke of luck! Wang Jingyi couldn't contain her excitement and her joy was evident.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She felt that today's scenes were tailor-made for Wang Jingyi.Wang Jingyi was excited throughout the day until they got to their scenes in the afternoon. Before the filming began, Zheng Baozhu pulled Wang Jingyi to her right side and said, \"I've checked the script; the male lead will come from this direction. You walk here, then you can bump into him!\"Wang Jingyi's hands trembled with excitement, \"I-I-I'm a bit scared!\"\"Don't worry!\" Zheng Baozhu reassured, \"When the time comes, we'll walk ahead together, and I'll bump into you, pushing you into his arms!\"\"!\" Wang Jingyi looked at Zheng Baozhu, tears welling up in her eyes, \"Sister, you're like my Dad in this life!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"That's a bit exaggerated.The director soon started filming. The scene they would be filming should go like this: The male lead, Lin Ziqin, would walk over from a distance. Zheng Baozhu would first exchange love-struck glances with Wang Jingyi, then they would intentionally step forward, pretending to accidentally bump into him and fall into his arms.Zheng Baozhu could feel how nervous Wang Jingyi was; her shoulders were slightly trembling.As Lin Ziqin approached them, Zheng Baozhu seized the right moment, using her shoulder to bump Wang Jingyi. Wang Jingyi stumbled and fell toward Lin Ziqin's direction. The male lead, known for his cold and aloof demeanor, gently supported the person who bumped into him without even changing his expression, and then he silently walked away.\"Cut! That shot's done!\"The shooting went smoothly, and after the director called for a break, Wang Jingyi was still reminiscing about the moment she bumped into Lin Ziqin.She had actually bumped into him! It was the happiest thing ever!\"Thank you, Dad!\" she shouted towards Zheng Baozhu.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Not necessary at all.At five o'clock, the sky began to darken. However, the crew finished work early today, letting them go at six o'clock. After changing back into their own clothes, Wang Jingyi walked out with Zheng Baozhu while boasting about her achievements today to her other friends.\"There's a line over there to collect something,\" Zheng Baozhu patted Wang Jingyi, \"What are they queuing for?\"Wang Jingyi glanced over but couldn't make sense of it, \"I don't know. Whatever it is, let's just go and collect it!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"......\"Just as Wang Jingyi pulled her over, some people had already come out of the queue from inside. Wang Jingyi asked them and found out that it was a treat from Lin Ziqin to the crew, inviting everyone for tea and snacks.\"Oh my goodness, not only did I run into Lin Ziqin today, but I also got to enjoy the tea and snacks he treated us to! I declare today as Wang Jingyi's lucky day!\" Wang Jingyi exclaimed excitedly, dancing with joy. Zheng Baozhu also went to collect a portion, both the tea and snacks were still very warm. As they say, one must not refuse others' kindness. Zheng Baozhu decided that from today onwards, she would consider herself an \"extra\" of Lin Ziqin.On the way back to the hotel in the car, Wang Jingyi had been hesitating to drink her bubble tea; instead, she kept taking photos of it. On the other hand, Zheng Baozhu finished hers. When Wang Jingyi saw this and she exclaimed anxiously, \"How did you finish it already?!!\"Zheng Baozhu was puzzled, \"Can't I finish it?\"\"......Calories, calories! Don't you have any awareness as a star?!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"\"Don't worry, I won't gain weight,\" Zheng Baozhu tried to reassure her.Wang Jingyi: \"...\"She decided to cut off her \"Dad\" relationship with Zheng Baozhu.After removing their makeup at the hotel, Zheng Baozhu put her mask back on and said, \"Where are you staying? I can drop you off on my way.\"\"Sure, thank you!\" Wang Jingyi got into the car and couldn't resist taking a few selfies. \"By the way, there's an audition for supporting actors next week. Are you going to sign up?\"Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and nodded, \"Yes, I'll go. If I don't pass this time, I'll wait for the next opportunity.\"Wang Jingyi said, \"I'm sure you'll pass on your first try! Although they evaluate the lines and acting skills for the supporting role auditions, looking beautiful is still essential!\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"But there are many beautiful girls at the Film and Television City.\"\"You are even more beautiful than them! You have the aura of a big star; I believe in you!\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and said, \"Thank you. Let's work hard together.\"\"Sure thing.\"After dropping off Wang Jingyi, Zheng Baozhu drove straight back to the Starlight Farm. She remembered that tonight, Qi Sheng was treating the people from Euro Grand Hotel to a meal, so she went to the restaurant to check on the situation. She had arranged a private room for Qi Sheng and found out they were still dining inside. She asked the service staff at the entrance, \"Are they still eating?\"\"Yes, it seems like the atmosphere is good.\"\"That's good.\"Zheng Baozhu nodded and then the staff informed her, \"Oh, by the way, Miss Baozhu, Liang Huihui took a two-day leave. She said she had something to attend to.\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback and asked, \"Did Huihui mention where she was going?\"\"No,\" the staff continued, lowering their voice and leaning towards Zheng Baozhu, \"But I saw her booking a flight ticket yesterday.\"Zheng Baozhu furrowed her eyebrows slightly. Could Huihui have gone to H City to find Li Yifan? Why did she go alone? This seemed like a risky move!\"I see. I'll call her later,\" Zheng Baozhu said, and then she went upstairs. On her way, she called Liang Huihui, but there was no response. She ended up sending her a message, offering help if she needed anything.After reaching her room, Zheng Baozhu took off her mask, quickly freshened up her makeup, and decided to head to the restaurant to have some food.When she arrived, it seemed like the group in Qi Sheng's private room was engaged in a drinking game. Though she despised the drinking culture at such gatherings, it was difficult to avoid. Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but sigh at the fact that even scientific researchers had to face such situations. Especially Qu Zhi, who always acted high and mighty; how could he handle these situations? Wouldn't he leave immediately if he felt unhappy?Curious, Zheng Baozhu glanced inside the room and saw a boss, who seemed quite tipsy, encouraging Qu Zhi to drink. Qu Zhi's face had turned dark, and if it weren't for Qi Sheng holding him back, Zheng Baozhu was certain he would have left on the spot.Seeing Qu Zhi refusing to drink, another person stood up with a drink in hand and approached him. Qi Sheng tried to intervene and block the drink, but the boss insisted on Qu Zhi drinking. The atmosphere became tense for a moment until Zheng Baozhu knocked on the door and entered with a smile, \"Hey, everyone, how's the meal going?\"All eyes turned to her. The person who had been insisting on Qu Zhi drinking scrutinized her and asked, \"Who's this?\"\"I'm the owner here and also Qu Zhi's old classmate,\" Zheng Baozhu said with a smile as she took a glass and poured herself some wine, \"I heard you all were dining here today, so I came over to say hello.\"\"Oh, you're the owner, huh? Didn't expect the owner to be so young and beautiful.\"\"You're too kind,\" Zheng Baozhu clinked glasses with him, \"What's the point of forcing Qu Zhi to drink? Let me have a couple of drinks with you all instead.\"\"Sure!\" The attention of the other bosses immediately shifted to Zheng Baozhu, and after a few rounds, they found themselves defeated by her.Qi Sheng: \"...\"\"Miss Baozhu, you're amazing,\" Qi Sheng gave Zheng Baozhu a thumbs-up.Zheng Baozhu seemed unfazed. On the other hand, only one of the executives from the other side was still standing. He didn't continue drinking with Zheng Baozhu and instead confirmed the signing agreement with Qi Sheng before a driver came to help the tipsy guests leave the room.Qi Sheng and Qu Zhi both went to see the guests off. Zheng Baozhu also followed behind them. As they watched the cars drive away, Qi Sheng let out a deep sigh and said, \"Oh my, it's finally over.\"Qu Zhi, with a cold expression, said, \"Don't invite me to these kind of occasions next time.\"\"Okay, okay, I know you made a significant sacrifice today. I'll make sure to mention it when reporting to Professor Luo tomorrow!\" Qi Sheng praised him and then looked at Zheng Baozhu, \"But the biggest hero of today is still Miss Baozhu! If it weren't for her, I think it would have been us who needed help leaving.\"Zheng Baozhu didn't react much after he spoke. Qi Sheng looked at her curiously and asked, \"Miss Baozhu, why are you not saying anything?\"Suddenly, Zheng Baozhu turned her head, raised her right hand high, and shouted into the night sky, \"Warrior\u2014Transform!!\"Qi Sheng: \"...\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"But that wasn't the end of it. Zheng Baozhu even hummed the theme song to herself and started dancing!Qi Sheng & Qu Zhi: \"...\"Zheng Baozhu had learned dancing when she was young, and although she was a bit tipsy now, her dance moves were still surprisingly well executed.The shock was too much for Qi Sheng and Qu Zhi; they just stood there, watching her complete the short dance.Her pose finally froze in the iconic Sailor Moon fighting stance.The night breeze brushed past the three and the place returned to silence. Qi Sheng quietly took out his phone and activated the video recording function, \"Miss Baozhu, do it again.\"And incredibly so, Zheng Baozhu actually did it again.Qu Zhi: \"...\"Before Zheng Baozhu finished her dance, Qu Zhi closed Qi Sheng's phone camera, then he walked up and held Zheng Baozhu, \"That's enough, let's go back and dance some other time.\"Qi Sheng watched the recorded video and followed them, laughing, \"After you wake up tomorrow from your alcohol haze, I'll send this video to everyone, hahaha!\"\"...\" Qu Zhi supported Zheng Baozhu and walked back, giving Qi Sheng a glance, \"I wonder why she drank so much.\"Cough, cough. Qi Sheng cleared his throat twice, put away his phone, and walked up to Zheng Baozhu, \"Miss Baozhu, next time on such occasions, let me handle it. You don't have to drink.\"Zheng Baozhu didn't like his suggestion, \"What do you mean? Are you looking down on me?\"\"It's not that. After all, you're still a child...\"\"So what if I'm a child!\" Zheng Baozhu debated with him, \"Do you think that battlefield belongs only to adults? Saving the world doesn't necessarily require only adults; it can also be warriors!\"She continued, pushing Qu Zhi aside and raising her right hand high, \"Moon Prism Power\u2014\"\"Stop, stop, stop!\" Qi Sheng quickly grabbed her raised hand, \"Let's not do that anymore, alright?\"Unhappily, Zheng Baozhu looked at him, \"What's wrong with you, playing the villain? How dare you interrupt my spellcasting?\"Qi Sheng: \"...\"\"If you don't follow the script, you'll have your pay deducted,\" Zheng Baozhu started complaining, and Qu Zhi used the opportunity to guide her into the elevator. Qi Sheng didn't follow; he went to find Manager Wei, thinking that children should be taken care of properly.Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi stayed on the same floor. Qu Zhi escorted her to the door and said, \"Open the door.\"\"Huh?\" Zheng Baozhu glanced at him and then at the door in front of her, \"Is this my room?\"\"...Why wouldn't it be?\"\"It can't be. I'm a warrior; I live on the moon!\"\"...\"Qu Zhi directly reached out and used her thumb to press the doorknob.And it unexpectedly opened.After the door opened, Qu Zhi helped Zheng Baozhu to the sofa. As he put her down, Qu Zhi finally breathed a sigh of relief. But unexpectedly, before he could stand up straight, Zheng Baozhu grabbed his tie and pulled him down.Qu Zhi quickly stabilized himself by placing his hand on the sofa and managed to steady their positions.Zheng Baozhu remained oblivious and closed her eyes, humming the theme song of the warrior.Qu Zhi furrowed his brows; he thought Qi Sheng was right \u2013 children shouldn't drink so much.Zheng Baozhu's face was close to his, and though they had known each other for many years, they had never been this close before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPlop.Qu Zhi distinctly heard the sound of his heartbeat, like a thunderclap exploding in his ears. He slightly stiffened, feeling somewhat at a loss.Unaware of all this, Zheng Baozhu, with her head tilted, seemed as though she had fallen asleep, leaving only a slender and enchanting side profile.Qu Zhi's facial expression tightened slightly. Then, he heard two firm knocks on the door, which finally allowed him to regain his composure.He swiftly moved away from the sofa and stood aside.Wei Zhen, at the door, coughed lightly, and walked in, \"Thank you for your help, Mr. Qu. I'll take it from here.\"\"Mhmm.\" Qu Zhi responded, quickly leaving Zheng Baozhu's room.Back in his own room, his heartbeat was still beating fast. He thought it must have been due to the alcohol he just consumed; the alcohol's effect, surely.Indeed, he couldn't attend such dinner parties.Zheng Baozhu, on the other hand, slept peacefully. When she woke up, it was close to noon the next day. Though her head ached a little, she felt much clearer than last night. After taking a quick hot shower and feeling refreshed, she thought about what happened last night. She could only recall drinking the other executives of the Euro Grand Hotel under the table; they were all eventually helped into their cars.However, how did she get back later?Zheng Baozhu shook her head and didn't dwell on it further. She picked out a dress from the wardrobe, changed, and decided to do her makeup before heading downstairs for lunch. As she picked up the lipstick from the dressing table, her phone beeped. She glanced at the screen and saw a message from Qi Sheng.Her slender fingers lightly tapped on the screen and Qi Sheng's message appeared.Qi Sheng: Miss Baozhu, are you awake now?Zheng Baozhu: What's up? Do you want me to buy your robots again?Qi Sheng: Seems like you're awake now.Qi Sheng: [Video]Seeing herself on the video thumbnail, Zheng Baozhu sensed that something was off. She opened the video, and an enthusiastic voice erupted from the phone - \"Warrior, transform!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\"In the video, she started to hum the theme song of the warrior and then danced along to her own rhythm.Zheng Baozhu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Help! I want to move to another planet overnight!As the video progressed to over ten seconds, a well-defined hand moved the camera lens, and then Qu Zhi appeared in the frame, trying to take her away from the scene.Zheng Baozhu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Qu Zhi was also at the scene?!Death from embarrassment, the ultimate death from embarrassment. :)For the next whole year, I don't want to see Qi Sheng and Qu Zhi together. :)Zheng Baozhu: I'll buy your robots, now immediately delete the video for me.Qi Sheng:Qi Sheng: It's not that serious. If you don't like it, I'll delete it. \u00a0I thought it was quite good, hahaha.Zheng Baozhu: If the one dancing in the video was you, I would also think it was good.Qi Sheng: \u00a0I've already deleted it.Qi Sheng: But I sent it to Qu Zhi.Zheng Baozhu: \u2026\u2026Who else did you send it to?Qi Sheng: No one else, just Qu Zhi. He definitely won't share it.\"\u2026\u2026\" That's not necessarily true! Qu Zhi is not known for being discreet!Zheng Baozhu: You make sure he deletes it too! I'll buy your robots!Qi Sheng: I'll do it right away!Zheng Baozhu took a few deep breaths, reassuring herself that it's okay, it's okay, she actually danced pretty well.After calming herself down, she finished applying her lipstick when her phone beeped again.This time it was Meng Yaxin.Meng Yaxin had already finished her annual leave and returned to work a few days ago. Though she was physically gone, her spirit remained with the hotel staff\u2014ever since the day she had a talk with Liang Huihui and Xiao Yu, she joined the hotel's CP fan group.The CP, of course, was Qu Zhi - Zheng Baozhu.Last night, Manager Wei sent an explosive message in the group, causing everyone to type excitedly.Meng Yaxin was puzzled. Weren't they supposed to be at work??Meng Yaxin: [Chat history]Meng Yaxin: Take a look.Zheng Baozhu curiously opened the chat history; the first message was from Wei Zhen.Wei Zhen: When I went to look for Miss Baozhu, Mr. Qu was holding her on the sofa. The atmosphere between the two was ambiguous and enchanting, making people blush and their heart race.Zheng Baozhu: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\"What the heck! Manager Wei couldn't be that kind of person!Zheng Baozhu: What is this group??Meng Yaxin: It's your hotel's group chat. [Picking Nose Emoji] Liang Huihui created the CP fan group.Zheng Baozhu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Zheng Baozhu: But why are you in there too??Meng Yaxin: Liang Huihui invited me in. [Picking nose] Not only me, but Cen Tongtong is also in it. I specially invited her so we could be the first to know how far we are from becoming keyboard warriors in the live chat.Zheng Baozhu:\u2026\u2026Meng Yaxin: Did you have fun with Qu Zhi last night?Zheng Baozhu: Rumors are just rumors, believe it or not. \u00a0Wise people don't spread or believe rumors.Meng Yaxin: [Picking nose]Zheng Baozhu put down her phone and covered her face with her hands.Qu Zhi sent her back to her room last night???After watching the video that Qi Sheng had just sent, it was indeed Qu Zhi helping her back. But... what scene was it on the sofa? Why did she have no recollection of it at all?!...Fake alcohol is harmful. :)She went through the chat history that Meng Yaxin had sent. Initially, she just wanted to see which employees had so much free time, but after reading it, she realized that Liang Huihui, the group owner, never appeared in the chat.Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but worry. Liang Huihui didn't reply to the message she sent yesterday either, and now her phone was turned off. She dialed Liang Huihui's number again, but it was still unreachable.Feeling anxious, she opened the door, and suddenly Tan Yao's voice came through, \"Good afternoon, Miss Baozhu. Do you have time to have lunch with me?\"Tan Yao was wearing his best black leather jacket and his hair was styled with hair wax. He leaned against the corridor wall with one hand and looked very cool.Zheng Baozhu stared at him for a moment, thinking it might be a good opportunity to ask about Liang Huihui. She nodded and said, \"Sure, I was just about to go downstairs for lunch.\"\"Then let's go together,\" Tan Yao said, and like magic, he produced a rose from behind and handed it to Zheng Baozhu, \"This is for you.\"\"Thank you,\" Zheng Baozhu took the rose and walked downstairs with him. When the restaurant staff saw them together, with Zheng Baozhu holding a rose, they couldn't help but speculate.Wasn't Miss Baozhu still having a passionate moment with Mr. Qu last night? Why did things suddenly change?Zheng Baozhu didn't care about their thoughts and found an empty table with Tan Yao to sit down. Because she had previously agreed to treat him, she ordered several signature dishes from the restaurant, all of which had the best reputation.\"Take a look and see if there's anything else you'd like to eat, don't be polite,\" Zheng Baozhu just handed over the menu when she saw Qu Zhi and Qi Sheng coming to the restaurant for lunch.Without a second thought, she grabbed Tan Yao's hand and pulled him into an empty private room, and then \"slammed\" shut the door.\"...\" Qi Sheng looked at the closed door of the private room and fell silent for two seconds, \"What's going on? Is that Miss Baozhu's boyfriend?\"Qu Zhi also looked in the direction of the private room, but he didn't answer Qi Sheng. He just sat down silently at the dining table.Inside the private room, Tan Yao still hadn't recovered from the surprise. Why did Miss Baozhu suddenly become so passionate? Could it be that she finally noticed his charm?He knew it; Tan Yao's charm was irresistible.\"Let's eat here,\" Zheng Baozhu smiled at Tan Yao and sat down on the chair, \"I'll have them bring the dishes here.\"\"Sure,\" Tan Yao followed and sat down on the chair, \"It's more private in the private room.\"\"You're right,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"I actually wanted to talk to you about something personal.\"Tan Yao's mind raced, preparing himself for Zheng Baozhu's confession, \"Go ahead.\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"Actually, it's like this. Do you remember the last time I asked you to inquire about Li Yifan?\"Tan Yao: \"......?\"Ah? Is she talking about that?Zheng Baozhu didn't notice his change of mood and continued, telling Tan Yao about Liang Huihui and Li Yifan's situation. After listening, Tan Yao remained silent for a while. Just as Zheng Baozhu was about to speak, he suddenly slammed the table and loudly cursed, \"Scumbag! He's so shameless!\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"You're right.\"\"Don't worry, I'll have my cousin find someone to bring that scumbag Li Yifan to you!\"\"No need for that, I'm just worried that Huihui might be taken advantage of over there. Her phone is off, and I can't reach her. Can you help me ask around and find out how Huihui is doing?\" If it's not possible, she might have to go to H City herself.\"Okay, don't worry. If she's still at the campus, they probably won't dare to do anything,\" Tan Yao created a group and added his cousin and Zheng Baozhu. He wanted to share any information they found in the group.Tan Xin: Don't worry, Miss Baozhu. I've already informed my roommate and his friends. We're going to look for Li Yifan together!Zheng Baozhu: Thank you, little brother.Tan Yao: You guys can directly go ask Li Yifan. If Liang Huihui did go to H City, she must be looking for him.Tan Xin: Okay, we'll do that.Tan Xin: This Li Yifan is really disgusting! \u00a0He's tarnishing the reputation of our H University students!Tan Xin: How could our university produce such a scumbag! He even fooled the campus belle!While Tan Xin vented his anger, they didn't neglect the main task. They worked efficiently, and half an hour later, they replied to Zheng Baozhu, \"We didn't find Liang Huihui, Li Yifan said he hasn't seen her either. We questioned him for a long time, but he doesn't seem to be lying.\"Zheng Baozhu: It shouldn't be. Huihui should have gone to find him. She doesn't have many friends outside our town.Liang Huihui was a girl from a small town, and her circle of friends was limited to the people from her town. Although the internet was well-developed now, it's unlikely that she would take two days off to meet someone she met online. The only person she would make such an effort to meet was Li Yifan.Tan Xin: We'll keep looking. Meanwhile, you can try calling her. If there's still no news, then you should report it to the police.Zheng Baozhu: Alright, I guess that's the only option now.She was now worried that Huihui went to find Li Yifan, saw something she couldn't bear, and did something impulsive.She tried calling Liang Huihui several times, but her phone was still off. Finally, she had no choice but to report it to the police. Initially, she didn't want to make this matter public, as it was Huihui's private affair. But now that the police were involved, other employees would naturally come to know about it.Liang Huihui had done a really good job of keeping her relationship with Li Yifan a secret. After hearing about Li Yifan's behavior, he was criticized by everyone. The police were also looking for her, but they hadn't found any information yet.In the evening, Xiao Yu exclaimed while looking at the hotel entrance, \"Huihui is back!\"Liang Huihui was taken aback by everyone's presence. Zheng Baozhu hurriedly looked over; although Huihui seemed physically fine, she looked downcast, and her eyes were slightly swollen, indicating she had been crying.Wei Zhen frowned and approached her, adjusting his glasses on his nose, \"Huihui, where did you go? Your phone was off! You have no idea how worried everyone was about you. Miss Baozhu even reported it to the police to find you.\"Although Zheng Baozhu was the hotel owner, she was usually easygoing and didn't interfere much with the employees' affairs. As a result, everyone was more afraid of the strict Manager Wei. Hearing Wei Zhen's scolding, Liang Huihui's eyes started to well up again. Zheng Baozhu stepped forward to comfort her, \"It's alright now, as long as you're back safely.\"Liang Huihui choked up and burst into tears, hugging Zheng Baozhu tightly.Wei Zhen: \"...\"Is he really that scary?Liang Huihui returned safely; Zheng Baozhu reported the same to the police. Then, she took Liang Huihui to the employee lounge. She handed her a cup of hot milk and asked, \"Huihui, where did you go these past two days? Did you go to find Li Yifan?\"Liang Huihui choked on her milk, nodded, and replied, \"I asked him on WeChat, but he denied having any relationship with that woman and blamed me for not trusting him, then he got angry with me.\"Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow, \"He's using a typical tactic to play the victim. Truly despicable.\"Liang Huihui held back her tears and continued, \"Then I thought I might have misunderstood him and wanted to go to H University to find him. But when I got there, I happened to see him with that woman from the picture right outside the dormitory building. He even kissed her,\" Liang Huihui's eyes turned red again as she spoke, \"I was afraid they'd see me, so I quickly ran away. I didn't even notice that my phone had run out of battery.\"Zheng Baozhu patted her head reassuringly, \"It's alright, let it all out. It's good to see the true face of that scumbag. This is a blessing in disguise.\"Liang Huihui sniffled, \"I can't figure it out. He used to be so good to me. Does he think I'm not worthy of him just because I'm a waitress?\"\"Hmph, it's ridiculous,\" Zheng Baozhu interrupted, \"He thinks you're not worthy of him, yet he's been using your money all this time? You may be a waitress, but you live a dignified life, which he's not worthy of.\"Liang Huihui was comforted by her words, and she hugged Zheng Baozhu again, shedding more tears.Zheng Baozhu patted her back and thought it was essential to sort out the money issue with Liang Huihui, \"Break up with that kind of person, but what about your money? He needs to pay you back.\"Liang Huihui said, \"I deleted all his contact information, and he doesn't have any money either...\"\"Even if he has no money, make him sign an IOU. He can repay it slowly after getting a job. You can't let him off the hook, right?\"Liang Huihui thought about it and shook her head. \"I don't want to have anything to do with him anymore. Consider that money lost.\"Zheng Baozhu understood her point. Who would want to maintain contact with such a scumbag? Besides, compared to the money, it was better for Liang Huihui to sever ties with him definitively, \"You're right. It's best not to have any contact with that kind of person. But if he comes back and tries to coax you again, you must not fall for it.\"Liang Huihui wiped her tears and replied, \"I won't.\"\"I'm afraid he might say a few things to convince you and you might be convinced by his act.\"Liang Huihui smiled self-deprecatingly, \"He won't come to beg me. He has already found someone better than me. I saw the girl myself; she was even more beautiful than in the photo and must be smart to get into H University. Why would Li Yifan come back to me?\"Zheng Baozhu furrowed her brows. The girl from H University probably didn't know about Li Yifan's girlfriend back in their hometown. Sighing, she comforted Liang Huihui, \"That's for the best. Huihui, you're wonderful, and you'll definitely meet someone better than Li Yifan. Remember what we talked about today; even if he comes to find you, you can't be swayed!\"Liang Huihui wiped her tears and nodded, \"Okay.\"Zheng Baozhu patted her head, \"Cry as much as you want today. Tomorrow, when the sun rises, don't shed another tear for this scumbag!\"\"Alright, Miss Baozhu. Sob...\"After these two days of rushing around and crying, Liang Huihui quickly became tired. Zheng Baozhu told her to rest early and returned to her room. Tan Yao had a family gathering, so he left early. Zheng Baozhu informed him via WeChat that Liang Huihui had returned safely.As soon as the message was sent, someone knocked on the door. Thinking it was Wei Zhen coming to discuss something, Zheng Baozhu walked up and opened the door.Qu Zhi, wearing a black coat, was standing outside.Zheng Baozhu was silent for a moment, recalling the scene of her dancing with him last night. Feeling embarrassed, she couldn't just back away in front of Qu Zhi! She slightly raised her chin, brushed her fingers against her hair, and put on a seemingly indifferent expression, \"What's up?\"Qu Zhi's gaze inadvertently swept over her neck and then shifted away, \"I heard that Liang Huihui is back. How is she doing?\"\"She's fine; I've already deleted that scumbag from her contacts.\"\"Okay, that's good. Then, I'll go now,\" Qu Zhi finished speaking and quickly left Zheng Baozhu's room, as though he was afraid of staying there for an extra second. Zheng Baozhu watched his departing figure and felt puzzled. Was he avoiding her? Wasn't he quite enthusiastic last night?With a light tsk, she returned to her room and closed the door.After a good night's sleep, Liang Huihui felt more stable and went back to work. However, Zheng Baozhu was still worried, so she asked others to keep an eye on her to prevent any impulsive actions.Two days later, they received a package at the front desk, addressed to Liang Huihui. Xiao Yu noticed that it was from H University and became alert. Not knowing what was inside, she didn't dare to give it directly to Liang Huihui and called Zheng Baozhu instead.Zheng Baozhu took the package and checked the address; it was indeed from H University, but the sender's name was an unfamiliar one. She shook the package lightly and confirmed it wasn't heavy or suspicious, \"It shouldn't contain anything dangerous. Couriers are strictly checked.\"Xiao Yu asked, \"Should we give it directly to Huihui?\"Since it was Liang Huihui's package, they couldn't open it themselves. Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and sent a message to Tan Xin.Zheng Baozhu: Is the H University girl Li Yifan was with named Chen Danni?Tan Xin: Yes, how do you know?Tan Xin: We told her about Li Yifan and Liang Huihui. They seemed to have had a big fight. I heard they broke up.Zheng Baozhu: He got what he deserved.\"Miss Baozhu?\" Xiao Yu noticed Zheng Baozhu was silent and asked again. Zheng Baozhu put away her phone and said, \"Bring Huihui over.\"\"Okay,\" Xiao Yu sent a message to Liang Huihui.Liang Huihui, who wasn't on duty at the moment, quickly arrived after hearing about the package. Seeing it was sent from H University, she hesitated. Zheng Baozhu informed her, \"I asked earlier. It's indeed from the H University girl, Chen Danni.\"Liang Huihui frowned and looked at Zheng Baozhu, \"How did she know about me?\"\"Tang Xin told her about you and Li Yifan. They seem to have broken up.\"As Zheng Baozhu finished speaking, Liang Huihui didn't show much reaction, but Xiao Yu pounded the table, \"Ugh, he deserves it!\"Liang Huihui took the package, shook it twice, and then took out a small knife from the front desk. She opened the package, and inside, there were no dangerous items, just a scarf and a jewelry box. The jewelry box contained a necklace with a delicate gold chain.Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow; she recognized this necklace. It was a well-known jewelry brand's Christmas limited edition. The scarf was also no ordinary item; it was a collaboration between Bunny and a popular IP.Apart from these two accessories, there was also a small card. Liang Huihui picked up the card and read it before telling Zheng Baozhu and Xiao Yu, \"That girl said these are gifts from Li Yifan. She knows he spent my money, so she sent these things to me. She also said that she didn't know Li Yifan had a friend back in his hometown, but now that she did, they have broken up.\"Xiao Yu couldn't hold back her anger and cursed, \"Li Yifan is truly despicable! He's playing both sides! Does he even deserve you? Bastard!\"\"Alright, Xiao Yu, calm down. It's not worth getting upset over such a scumbag,\" Zheng Baozhu comforted her and then turned to look at Liang Huihui, asking, \"What do you plan to do with these things?\"Liang Huihui furrowed her brows. These were all gifts Li Yifan gave to the other girl, she naturally didn't want to keep them. However, he had spent her money on these items, so throwing them away felt like a waste...Zheng Baozhu seemed to understand her dilemma and offered a suggestion, \"How about selling them on a second-hand website? These items still look new, so you should be able to sell them and recover some of your losses.\"Liang Huihui thought it was a good idea, \"Alright, I'll look into it later.\"Xiao Yu chimed in, \"What's there to look into? I'll do it! I have an account, I'll help you list them!\"\"Wow, thank you so much, Xiao Yu!\"\"Don't mention it!\"With the matter resolved, Zheng Baozhu didn't linger at the hotel. She had to go to the Film and Television City today to participate in a supporting role audition.The audition was held at the Actor Service Department. When Zheng Baozhu drove there, there was already a long queue outside. Wang Jingyi was also there to audition today. She had previously taken the audition once, so she could give Zheng Baozhu some advice, \"We are now queuing to get the topics for the preliminary round. One is improvisation; the other is monologue.\"Zheng Baozhu nodded. She had been taking acting classes during this period and had mainly practiced these two aspects. However, while waiting in line, she inquired around and found out that most of them were graduates of acting majors, which made her feel less confident.\"How many people pass the audition for supporting characters?\" she asked Wang Jingyi.Wang Jingyi shook her head with a bitter smile, \"When I took the audition last time, there were a lot more people in the queue compared to now, but only a little over ten passed in the end!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"\u2026\"The competition was indeed too fierce.Zheng Baozhu wrapped her down jacket around her and stomped her feet to keep warm while waiting in line for nearly two hours before they finally received the topics for the preliminary round.Zheng Baozhu's improvisation was to act as a scene where she was making a bowl of fried rice. She raised an eyebrow. This was a coincidence as she had a background in the culinary industry. Then, she looked at the monologue topic, and she was even more surprised by her luck. It was a scene from a movie starring Su Ming, her aunt.When Zheng Baozhu was a child, she watched Su Ming's movies with her parents, but she was too young at the time. Apart from thinking that her aunt was beautiful, she didn't remember much. Later, Su Ming passed away, and all the posters in their house were torn down, even the DVDs were stored away somewhere she didn't know.She knew that her family did this because they were afraid that she would be influenced, so they stored away everything related to Su Ming. However, she didn't agree with this decision because those were proof of her aunt's existence.Though her aunt's life was short, she lived those twenty-five years more brilliantly than many people could live in a lifetime.When she grew up, Zheng Baozhu secretly rented Su Ming's movies and TV dramas from the DVD store. Su Ming's company even released a commemorative edition of her movie collection, so Zheng Baozhu used all her saved pocket money to buy the box.The monologue she was set to perform was from one of the movies from that collection.Su Ming played the role of a well-behaved young lady in the movie, someone who had been strictly disciplined since childhood, always following the rules in her actions and words. The monologue Zheng Baozhu received was the only scene where the character experiences an emotional breakdown.The monologue had intense emotional ups and downs, which added to the difficulty of delivering the lines\u2014many actors tend to stumble when they get emotional.After receiving the topics, Zheng Baozhu had only five minutes to prepare. She took the script and silently rehearsed the lines, getting herself into the right mood.She entered the audition room before Wang Jingyi. Wang Jingyi made a cheering gesture from behind and watched her go in.Inside the audition room, two teachers sat in front of Zheng Baozhu. She greeted them before starting the improvisation. Zheng Baozhu's appearance and temperament were outstanding and she added more charm to her performance - the teachers appreciated her appearance and were looking forward to her performance.The improvisation scene with her cooking presented no difficulty for Zheng Baozhu. She was someone who had cooked before and her performance showed it with meticulous details. The teachers nodded after watching, then they moved on to the monologue.The lines could be read directly from the script. Zheng Baozhu held the paper in her hand, took a deep breath, and quickly got into character, \"Dreams? Are you talking to me about dreams? How ridiculous! I am nothing but a puppet pulled by my family's strings. When they want me to laugh, I laugh. When they want me to cry, I cry. To survive in this suffocating family, I have to kill myself over and over in my heart! Do you think I could have any dreams? Is escaping from this horrifying family considered a dream?\"This movie was a social drama that reflected the appalling discipline in large families through the protagonist's experiences.Zheng Baozhu's performance was excellent, her emotions were on point, and her enunciation was clear. The teachers praised her and almost without hesitation, gave her a pass. Zheng Baozhu didn't expect it to go so smoothly and thanked the teachers repeatedly.The teacher on the left looked at her and said, \"You really look like Su Ming.\"Zheng Baozhu touched her nose and smiled, \"People often say that.\"\"Then go and prepare for the final audition. You'll have a callback later.\"\"Sure, thank you, teacher.\"Zheng Baozhu went to the designated area and received the callback script.The final audition required two actors to perform together in a scene. Zheng Baozhu was assigned a quarrel scene, fortunately, not the kind of scene with shouting. Instead, it was a scene with sarcastic and witty exchanges, written in an interesting way.This time, they had forty minutes to prepare and they had to perform from the script. Zheng Baozhu found her partner, a handsome young man who was also tall. He had been standing there rehearsing lines, but when he saw Zheng Baozhu approaching him, his ears turned a bit red.Zheng Baozhu chatted with him and learned that he was a student majoring in performing arts. Knowing that he was a professional performer, Zheng Baozhu felt relieved. If the scene partner couldn't keep up, it would definitely affect her performance. However, this young man seemed reliable, and he might become a good partner.They quickly went over the lines together and rehearsed the scene twice before they were called in for the audition.Their performance during the official audition was the best they had done. It was quite remarkable to develop such chemistry in just forty minutes of preparation. The teachers approved of both of their performances, and they both passed.Although the supporting character audition wasn't a life-or-death situation, the acceptance rate was still quite low. Now that both of them passed together, they were thrilled. When parting, the young man even asked for Zheng Baozhu's WeChat.Zheng Baozhu felt that this young man was promising and had good acting skills. He might become popular in the future.Passing the audition meant they could join the drama group as supporting characters. From now on, they could take on supporting character roles, starting with a minimum salary of four to five hundred. Most importantly, with a special contract, they had officially stepped into the acting industry, and \"celebrity\" was no longer an unattainable dream.Overjoyed, Zheng Baozhu immediately announced in the group chat that she would cook dinner when she returned to the hotel, so everyone should keep some room in their stomachs.As she finished sending the message, she saw Wang Jingyi coming out too. Wang Jingyi had also made it to the callback this time. Zheng Baozhu rushed over and asked, \"How did it go? Did you pass?\"\"Sniff, sniff, I still didn't make it. I failed in both attempts!\" Wang Jingyi felt a bit frustrated, \"But at least I passed the initial audition this time, so I guess it's progress!\"\"Uh-huh, keep that attitude, and you'll pass the callback next time!\"\"Taking your good wishes!\" Wang Jingyi hugged Zheng Baozhu and said, \"You passed in one go, so let me soak up some of your luck!\"\"Sure thing.\"While Zheng Baozhu was participating in the audition, Qi Sheng came across the video of Zheng Baozhu's business interview in the office. After watching it, he called Qu Zhi and said excitedly, \"Old Qu, the interview you mentioned last time has been broadcasted on TV!\"Zheng Baozhu appeared on the morning news, which ran from six to nine o'clock daily. Naturally, Qi Sheng didn't watch the live TV broadcast; he watched the recorded version on the internet. He sent the video link to Qu Zhi and added a comment, \"Last time, you only hear the part where she talked about selling the car for money, didn't you? What she said afterward shows that she has ideas. Honestly, do you think someone without thoughts and soul can succeed in entrepreneurship? Parent's wealth wouldn't be enough for such a venture.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"He temporarily put aside his work and clicked on the video link to watch it. The video was edited, only showing all the highlights. Zheng Baozhu talked about the difficulties she faced while setting up her restaurant, including times when she had to endure hardships, and even the situation when the head chef left halfway through. However, she persevered through all of that, which eventually led to the success of her hotel at Starlight Farm.Qi Sheng: After watching it, don't you feel a little guilty?Qu Zhi: \"...\"He pursed his lips, closed the video, and continued working.Today, he worked overtime again until nine o'clock. When he left, he was the only one left in the company. Returning to the hotel, he smelled the aroma of food and guessed that the front desk staff was having a late-night snack.\"Mr. Qu,\" Xiao Yu saw him come back and greeted him, \"Are you just off work?\"\"Yeah,\" Qu Zhi nodded.Xiao Yu asked, \"Did you have dinner yet? It's quite late now.\"Qu Zhi had only eaten a little bit earlier, so now he was indeed feeling a bit hungry, \"I'll order takeout later.\"\"Hey!\" Xiao Yu waved at him and said, \"No need for takeout. Miss Baozhu is in the kitchen making food right now! She passed some kind of exam today and is so happy that she is preparing some late-night snacks for us.\"Qu Zhi was surprised, \"Zheng Baozhu? She's in the mood for cooking?\"\"Yeah,\" Xiao Yu continued, \"She made so much food that we can't finish it all. You should go and have some too; otherwise, it'll go to waste!\"Qu Zhi thought for a moment, nodded, and headed toward the direction of the kitchen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng Baozhu had returned to the hotel in the afternoon, but at that time, the hotel kitchen staff hadn't finished their shifts, so she didn't dare to barge into the kitchen at that time. It was only after dinner was over and the chefs had gone off duty that Zheng Baozhu could finally take over the kitchen.At this time of day, she could only prepare some late-night snacks for everyone. Although her room had a kitchen, it definitely wasn't as spacious and well-equipped as the hotel kitchen, nor did it have the same variety of ingredients. So, she preferred to showcase her culinary skills in the hotel's large kitchen.When Qu Zhi entered, Zheng Baozhu was waiting for the crispy pork belly to be ready. The aroma of the roasting was already very enticing; the smell alone was mouthwatering.Zheng Baozhu heard someone coming in and turned her head to take a look. Both of them stood, locking eyes in silence.The atmosphere felt a bit awkward, so Zheng Baozhu tugged at the corner of her mouth and asked, \"Why are you here? Did the aroma of my roast waft into your room?\"Qu Zhi cleared his throat and stood there, saying, \"When I came back, the front desk told me that you made a lot of late-night snacks and asked me to help eat them so that they won't go to waste.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Why did he make mooching for food sound so fresh and popular!The front desk staff too, why didn't they send anyone else to mooch off her food? Why only Qu Zhi? Huh, it's obvious that they're doing it just for the CP!She couldn't understand why people ship couples that have no chemistry or logical basis. Are they really so indiscriminate about it?After mentally venting her frustration, Zheng Baozhu got up from her stool. She had indeed made a bit too much tonight, and if it went to waste, it would be a pity.\"Consider yourself lucky; I'm in a good mood today,\" Zheng Baozhu walked to a large pot and scooped a bowl of lean pork congee for Qu Zhi, \"This is my stewed century egg and lean pork congee. I made a bit too much.\"The congee had been kept warm in the pot, so it was still hot. Qu Zhi took the bowl and thanked Zheng Baozhu.\"I also grilled a lot of barbecue over there; take a look and see what you'd like to eat,\" Zheng Baozhu said as she estimated that the crispy pork belly was almost done. She quickly put on gloves and took out the pork belly.The two pieces of crispy pork belly were roasted to perfection, with crispy golden skin and sizzling oil on top. As soon as they were taken out, the aroma became even more alluring, tempting anyone who smelled it.Qu Zhi's stomach growled.The sound wasn't loud, but Zheng Baozhu heard it. She turned to look at Qu Zhi and burst into laughter, \"Was that your stomach just now? My crispy pork belly is so tempting, hahaha!\"\"...\"Qu Zhi pursed his lips, trying to maintain his composure, \"I haven't had dinner tonight.\"Zheng Baozhu continued to laugh, \"You've been working overtime until now? That's really tough, hahaha.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"After Zheng Baozhu finished laughing, she finally started cutting the crispy pork belly. Because it was roasted to be crispy, the knife made a crackling sound as she cut through it. Once the pork belly was cut, Zheng Baozhu arranged it on a plate and also placed the dipping sauce she had prepared earlier on the side.\"Give it a try,\" She motioned toward Qu Zhi.Qu Zhi used chopsticks to pick up a piece of the crispy pork belly, dipped it into the sauce, and took a bite.Crunch.The pork belly made a crispy sound, and Qu Zhi's eyes brightened.Zheng Baozhu asked him, \"How does it taste?\"Qu Zhi swallowed the piece of crispy pork belly and slightly pursed his lips, \"It's delicious.\"Although Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu had many differences, their tastes were exceptionally compatible, both enjoying spicy and numbing flavors. Hearing his praise, Zheng Baozhu proudly harrumphed, \"Of course, who made it.\"She also tried a piece herself and indeed, the taste was absolutely fantastic. No wonder!Qu Zhi then tasted the congee, which had a perfect balance of saltiness and lightness, very flavorful. Honestly, he didn't expect Zheng Baozhu's culinary skills to be this good, \"I didn't know you can cook.\"\"I learned it,\" Zheng Baozhu started to boast, \"Back then, I almost mastered all eight major Chinese cuisines.\"\"Oh,\" Qu Zhi lowered his head to eat more congee, \"Because the head chef of the restaurant left?\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him in surprise, \"How did you know?\"Qu Zhi said, \"I saw the video of your interview.\"\"Really?\" Zheng Baozhu's eyes widened with delight, \"I've been so busy lately that I forgot about it!\"She would check it out later in her room.\"Did I look good in the interview?\" Zheng Baozhu asked.\"...Uh,\" Qu Zhi was speechless for a moment and made a vague \"hmm\" sound, \"I saw you mention in the interview that the chef opened his own restaurant and then it closed down?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"Opening a restaurant is not easy. Do you know how many restaurants go bankrupt in the country every year? Master Liao's restaurant was one of them.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"He silently ate a piece of crispy pork belly and curiously asked, \"What happened to Master Liao after that?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"He came back to work at our hotel as one of the chefs.\"\"Uh...\" Qu Zhi almost choked on the spiciness in the dish. He coughed lightly a couple of times and found it somewhat unbelievable, \"He came back to find you again?\"\"Yes.\"\"...And then you agreed?\"Zheng Baozhu laughed and glanced at Qu Zhi, \"Do you think it's awkward for Master Liao, or is it awkward for me? If he hadn't reached a dead-end, he wouldn't have come back to find me.\"Qu Zhi looked on without saying a word. Zheng Baozhu picked up her chopsticks and took a piece of crispy pork belly for herself. She said, \"Master Liao is very skilled. When he first came to the restaurant, he didn't cause any trouble, and we had a pleasant cooperation. As the restaurant gained some popularity, one of his relatives instigated him to open his own restaurant. Master Liao believed in his relative's words, borrowed money from friends and family in his hometown, and opened a restaurant. However, in less than a year, it closed down due to poor management. The relative who instigated him saw that things weren't going well and left, but Master Liao couldn't escape the situation. His two children were studying in the city, and his family depended on him. The people from his hometown were urging him to repay the debts. If it wasn't because he was at his wit's end, he wouldn't have had the audacity to come back and find me.\"Qu Zhi's eyes flickered. He didn't expect Zheng Baozhu to think this way, but at the same time, it didn't surprise him.Zheng Baozhu continued, \"After Master Liao left, I also had a hard time. At that time, the kitchen only had one apprentice, and I couldn't find a suitable replacement right away. I had to take some dishes off the menu and help the apprentice in the kitchen every day. That's how I honed my culinary skills. When both the apprentice and I were about to give up, Chef Zhao suddenly appeared as if sent by the heavens!\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Zheng Baozhu seemed to recall the past with relish, \"Chef Zhao's skills were outstanding too, no less than Master Liao's! When he came, our kitchen's momentum soared! The restaurant's customer flow was already significant, and Chef Zhao's signature dishes helped save the day!\"\"... Are you sure you want to be an actor and not a comedian?\" Qu Zhi couldn't help but ask.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"\"Don't eat anymore, give me the chopsticks,\" Zheng Baozhu said, reaching out to collect Qu Zhi's utensils, but Qu Zhi protected his food and retreated slightly.\"And then? Did your restaurant revive from that point on?\" Qu Zhi asked seriously.Zheng Baozhu snorted and replied, \"Of course! The restaurant is still being led by Chef Zhao now, and the former apprentice has grown into a capable chef!\"\"Oh, so you arranged for Master Liao to work at the hotel?\"\"Well, it was also Master Liao's good luck. I was preparing to open the hotel back then. Master Liao was also a grateful person. When the hotel was being established, he brought his whole family to help, doing everything he could. Over the years, he has been working diligently here and repaid all the debts he owed from his hometown.\"Qu Zhi lowered his gaze slightly and said, \"Giving someone roses leaves a lingering fragrance on your hand1.\"\"Wow!\" Zheng Baozhu looked at him in surprise, \"Are you praising me?\"\"...\" Qu Zhi cleared his throat, feeling somewhat uncomfortable. He raised his hand and loosened the top button of his collar, feeling that his breathing wasn't smooth.Outside, Xiao Yu, who smelled the aroma of the roasted pork, wanted to get some pork belly, but she saw Qu Zhi unbuttoning his shirt at the kitchen door!She quietly retreated, thinking it's better to leave them alone; after all, what's more important than enjoying the food is discussing their CP relationship! Just as she was about to leave, Zheng Baozhu noticed her and said, \"Xiao Yu.\"With a helpless expression, Xiao Yu turned back, \"Miss Baozhu.\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and said, \"Are you here to get the crispy pork belly?\" She pushed a plate of freshly cut pork belly towards her, \"I've already prepared it. Take this plate to enjoy.\"\"Thank you, Miss Baozhu!\" Xiao Yu happily took the plate of pork belly and left. Qu Zhi stood up and said to Zheng Baozhu, \"I'll take some back to my room to eat.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu replied and started to tidy up the kitchen. If the chefs come to work the next day and see the messy kitchen, they would probably want to have a heart-to-heart talk with her again.Qu Zhi took a plate and put the porridge and some snacks in it. He carried the plate and headed outside. When he reached the doorway, he turned around and glanced at Zheng Baozhu, who was tidying up.Sensing his gaze, Zheng Baozhu looked in his direction. Qu Zhi quickly averted his eyes, hurriedly leaving the area.\"...\"Zheng Baozhu felt that Qu Zhi had been acting strangely lately.That night, Xiao Yu ate well and returned to her room after work, feeling satisfied, and went to sleep. She slept until nearly noon before waking up lazily, holding her phone to browse.Suddenly, her second-hand trading app beeped, and Xiao Yu received a new message on her account.Recently, she had just listed the necklace and scarf for Liang Huihui in the app, and there were occasional inquiries, but due to the relatively high prices of these items, she hadn't sold them yet.Today, when the app beeped, Xiao Yu thought it was another inquiry about the price. However, when she opened the private chat, she was astonished by what she saw.On the other end was Li Yifan!Xiao Yu suddenly sat up from the bed, looking at the successive messages from Li Yifan.Xiao Yu immediately sat up from the bed, looking at Li Yifan's messages that kept coming in one after another.\"Huihui, I'm Li Yifan. Is this your account?\"Why did you delete my contact information? I need to talk to you. Can you add me back?\"\"I know I was wrong in that matter. I have reflected on it. Can you forgive me?\"This infuriated Xiao Yu. How could this scumbag think of getting back together with Huihui? Disgusting!Xiao Yu: Forgive you? Dream on! Add you back? Not in a million years!Xiao Yu: Not only won't I add you back, but I'm also going to block your account! Get lost!After venting her anger, Xiao Yu immediately blocked Li Yifan's account.Feeling refreshed, Xiao Yu decided to keep this matter to herself and bury it deep in her heart.At the same time, Zheng Baozhu was chatting with Cen Tingting online.Cen Tingting: [Chat history]Cen Tingting: Take a look at this, take a look! Last time, it was Qu Zhi getting too close to you on the sofa, and now he's unbuttoning his shirt!Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"It must be Xiao Yu spreading rumors in the group chat!She clicked into the chat history and found that it was indeed Xiao Yu, adding fuel to the fire in the group chat, describing everything vividly as if she was writing a fictional novel!Zheng Baozhu finally understood. Fans who ship CP rely on their imagination!Cen Tingting: Baozhu, I'm disappointed in you.Cen Tingting: Reflect on why you and Qu Zhi have reached this point.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Cen Tingting: I hope you understand one thing, eating keyboards will lead to death.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"After she finished chatting with Cen Tingting, Zheng Baozhu got busy with the delivery robot business. She had promised to buy delivery robots from Qi Sheng, and he had already prepared the robots and contracts, waiting for the payment.The robots needed to be connected to the hotel's network and some data had to be configured. Qi Sheng personally brought the robots to the hotel. Since they were mainly used for delivering takeout to guests, he also taught the front desk staff how to use the robots.Zheng Baozhu gathered all the front desk staff and learned the usage from Qi Sheng.\"Our delivery robots are very simple to use. Just press the open button to unlock the compartment. Put the food inside, enter the room number, and then press the close button. It will automatically go to the room to deliver the food.\"As he explained, the colleagues from the food and beverage department were all standing around, observing him. Especially Liang Huihui, whose gaze was particularly penetrating. She had just gone through a bad breakup with a scumbag and had barely recovered. Today, she encouraged herself, saying to herself that if Miss Baozhu could be so outstanding and still study for exams, then she should also focus on her work!But then, Qi Sheng showed up in the afternoon with these gadgets.She looked at the two round and silly-looking delivery robots and asked, \"They have no hands or feet. How do they use the elevators?\"Other colleagues from the food and beverage department joined in with a chorus of agreement.Qi Sheng wiped the sweat off his forehead and explained, \"Because they are connected to the hotel's network, the elevators will automatically open the doors and select the floor when they enter.\"Liang Huihui then asked, \"How do they notify the guests when the food is being delivered?\"Qi Sheng replied, \"When they reach the door of the room, they will call the room. Once the guest answers the call, they can open the door and collect the food.\"Liang Huihui shrugged, \"But guests may not know how to use them.\"\"Our robots are very user-friendly, and they have voice systems that will guide the guests step by step,\" Qi Sheng added. Then he turned to the front desk staff and added, \"In addition to delivering takeout, you can also use them to deliver other items that guests might need. This will reduce a lot of your workload.\"Liang Huihui whispered, \"If our workload is reduced, we might lose our jobs.\"Qi Sheng: \"...\"He had mentioned before that machines gradually replacing some human positions was an inevitable trend. Of course, it was not an easy concept for humans to accept.\"Don't worry, Huihui. These robots are not meant to replace the restaurant's delivery staff, so you won't lose your job,\" Zheng Baozhu reassured Liang Huihui. She knew that everyone worked hard and nobody wanted to be unemployed.However, Zheng Baozhu was personally interested in these delivery robots. Since the product had not been widely adopted yet, hotel guests might find them intriguing, which could be a selling point to attract customers. And, she had to admit, the cost of using robots was indeed lower than human labor.Before the robots could officially start working, Qi Sheng had to conduct another round of testing and some final adjustments. So, for the time being, the robots remained in a dormant state. After explaining to the front desk staff, Qi Sheng had the robots stored away. Liang Huihui was still standing there, eyeing him like he was her arch-nemesis.He walked up to her and smiled, \"I'm just an ordinary researcher. Besides me, there are many others working on these types of robots.\"Liang Huihui retorted, \"But they aren't coming to our hotel to sell it.\"\"...\"Qi Sheng smiled, \"As a token of appreciation for Miss Baozhu taking care of my business, I'm you all to dinner tonight. Will you come too?\"Liang Huihui snorted, \"Humph, the virtuous do not accept gifts from others.\"Qi Sheng: \"...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlthough Qi Sheng said he would treat Zheng Baozhu to dinner, but she wasn't sure if she would have time tonight.Yesterday, she received her first acting gig, and the notification to join the rehearsal was for 4:00 PM. Zheng Baozhu had never attended rehearsals this late; usually, she would finish by the evening if she went early in the morning. Today might end up being a late night for her.She asked Qi Sheng to reschedule the dinner for tomorrow and then took a cab to the film studio.On the way, Zheng Baozhu was still wondering about the nature of this production. Why would they assemble so late? Upon arriving at the hotel where they did makeup, she finally understood that it was a horror film production!She never imagined she would be so unlucky that she would land a minor role in a horror film! And it was one of those Chinese-style horror movies, the type she feared the most! Even the actor who had special effects makeup scared her so much last time that she got fired from the set.The film they were about to shoot was titled [Wedding Feast]. Zheng Baozhu would be playing a guest attending a banquet, but before the banquet ended, she would meet a chilling fate.Perhaps to set the mood for the actors, the staff had been intentionally or unintentionally discussing the old mansion where they were filming. According to them, previous crews that shot there had encountered strange occurrences.Zheng Baozhu's heart raced when she heard this and couldn't help but ask, \"What kind of strange occurrences?\"The makeup artist surnamed Zhang hesitated for a moment and then sighed, \"Forget it, I shouldn't scare you.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Now she was even more scared!After getting into character, the sky outside had turned dark. This time, she didn't have to take a bus with other extras to the filming location; the crew arranged a separate car to transport the featured actors to and from the site.The upgraded treatment for being a featured actor brought a little relief to Zheng Baozhu's nerves.On the way, she distracted herself by taking selfies with her phone. Her role today was that of a Republican-era university student, and the hairstylist gave her two braids, making her look innocent and pure.Upon arriving at the filming location, Zheng Baozhu immediately spotted the old mansion that the makeup artist had mentioned earlier. It was already quite dark outside, but the set didn't have many lights on, leaving the mansion silently standing in the night, looking eerie.Dry ice machines were also prepared on set, likely to create a foggy atmosphere later.Zheng Baozhu's nerves were on edge; it felt like she had stepped into a highly realistic escape room.Summoning up courage, Zheng Baozhu went to the wardrobe truck and collected her outfit\u2014a short top paired with long bottoms, complemented by a pair of black leather shoes, giving her a complete student look. After changing into the costume, Zheng Baozhu noticed that the crew's suona team had also arrived, and there were plenty of paper money and white wax candles prepared on the scene...Suddenly, making money from this gig seemed less appealing.\"Let's have a meal first, and after that, we'll start shooting,\" the crew's staff pushed the boxed lunches over. Zheng Baozhu chased after them and got one. Whether it was because of the special treatment for featured actors or because the crew sympathized with the trauma she was about to experience on set, this boxed lunch was the most luxurious one she had ever had since she started as an extra...And this made her feel even more uneasy!After finishing the meal, Zheng Baozhu was called over to start shooting. The set lights were really bright and expertly positioned, creating an unsettling atmosphere in the composition. Although the scene was set at a wedding banquet, there were white lanterns hanging around instead of the typical red ones...Zheng Baozhu and a few other actors followed the director's instructions and sat down at their designated spots, pretending to eat. Everything was going smoothly, and suddenly, the main light on set went out without any warning, plunging the scene into darkness. At the same time, the sound of loud suona instruments came from the courtyard, and paper money rained down from the night sky.Zheng Baozhu was left stunned.Several extras were scared and ran out when the lights went off. Everyone looked genuinely terrified. The director's voice came from the side, \"Great, this shot was perfect, everyone's reaction was so real.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"......\"Yes, the reaction was so real that she almost lost it.After the main light went out, it never came back on. The scene was illuminated only by two dim lights and the white lanterns hanging inside the house. Zheng Baozhu's scenes were not finished yet; she had to deliver lines when the bride appeared.As they were getting ready, the bride was brought out, supported by two maids with eerie makeup. Just one glance at that scene from a distance gave Zheng Baozhu a bone-chilling feeling. She knew she had to face them directly and deliver her lines...She thought she had never experienced anything as intense even in the escape room missions she participated in. :)With the actors in their positions, the director quickly started shooting again. The bride suddenly appeared in the courtyard after the paper money was scattered, and no one knew where she came from. She wore a red veil on her head, stood on tiptoes, and her posture looked extremely peculiar.Zheng Baozhu's heart kept pounding. The makeup on the two maids was so terrifying that it triggered a psychological fear in her. Nevertheless, when the director signaled her to go up, she could only muster the courage to step forward.\"Wen Wen!\" She rushed forward, holding the bride's hand and shaking it hard. \"I'm Xiao Ling, do you remember me? Why did you suddenly stop coming to school? You never mentioned anything about getting married!\"While speaking, the two maids kept staring at her, their faces lifeless and devoid of any expression. Zheng Baozhu didn't dare to look at them. After delivering her lines, the two maids received instructions from the director and approached her, one on each side, lifting Zheng Baozhu and dragging her away from the courtyard.\"Let go of me!\" Zheng Baozhu struggled as she was dragged out of the frame.\"Cut! Let's redo the shot with her being dragged away!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"......\"After today's shoot, the director might discover that each of his featured actors had changed into two people because they \"cracked\" open. :)Zheng Baozhu's scenes were completed before 8:30 PM. The director didn't keep her waiting on set and he let her go home directly.This turned out to be an unexpected delight for Zheng Baozhu. She started work at 4 o'clock today, and by 8:30 PM, they were already done! If it weren't for the terrifying scenes they shot, she would consider it a perfect day!She was given a separate car to go back to, which would take her directly to Starlight Farm. During the ride, the driver played a few festive songs, trying to wash away the memories of the set.She really didn't want to have nightmares tonight. Help!As they were approaching Starlight Farm, the car stopped at a junction, waiting for the traffic light. The car was still playing [Good Fortune Comes], sounding lively and festive. Zheng Baozhu adjusted her hair and caught a glimpse of Qu Zhi through the rearview mirror.He must have just finished work. This road was a must-pass route from the Science and Technology Park to the hotel. When Zheng Baozhu saw him, he was moving several shared bicycles parked on the blind road to the designated parking area behind.Zheng Baozhu was stunned for a moment. It was already pitch-dark outside, and this area was not in the city center. At this time, there weren't many people on the road. Why was Qu Zhi performing here? Who was he doing this for?There were three bicycles parked on the blind road and Qu Zhi was moving them one by one. When the car Zheng Baozhu was in drove away, he was arranging the last one. Zheng Baozhu turned her head, watching Qu Zhi's figure getting smaller through the car window.Back at the hotel, Zheng Baozhu applied a face mask and took a bath before crawling into bed. She thought she would keep thinking about the paper money, the bride, and the eerie maids from the set. But once she lay down, she realized that she couldn't stop thinking about Qu Zhi??It wasn't her fault; it was because Qu Zhi was too strange! He was actually clearing the blind road? Had he gone bad by maintaining his set persona for so long??Zheng Baozhu tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep. Qu Zhi's image haunted her mind and wouldn't leave....Forget it. Zheng Baozhu forced a smile, thinking that it was better to think about Qu Zhi than the eerie maids from the set.That night, Zheng Baozhu indeed had a nightmare and couldn't escape it. Since she couldn't sleep well at night, she stayed in bed longer and didn't wake up until 10 o'clock. She didn't have any work to attend today and didn't need to go to the Film and Television City.When she went downstairs, Qi Sheng was already there, testing the robot. Xiao Yu came over and smiled, \"Miss Baozhu, Mr. Qi said the robot can be put to use today. I tried it myself just now, it's so much fun!\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and walked over to take a look at the cute robot, its appearance and the childlike voice used in the speech system made it even more endearing.\"It's basically ready now, it can officially start working today,\" Qi Sheng said to Zheng Baozhu, \"If you encounter any issues during use, you can contact me.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"How about this, I will have little guy send me my lunch today at noon?\"\"Sure!\" Xiao Yu immediately agreed, \"I'll have it send the lunch to you at lunchtime!\"Qi Sheng tidied up his things and asked Zheng Baozhu, \"Miss Baozhu, have you decided where to go for dinner tonight?\"Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and said, \"You've all been eating at my place lately and you might be tired of it. Let's go to a different restaurant tonight.\"\"Alright, where do you want to go?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"To my other restaurant.\"Qi Sheng: \"......\"Sure, that works.As he was about to return to the company, a delivery guy came in holding a bouquet of flowers. Qi Sheng paused for a moment, looking curious. The delivery guy held the flowers and said to the receptionist, \"This is for Ms. Zheng Baozhu.\"Upon hearing this, Zheng Baozhu raised her eyebrows slightly in surprise, \"For me?\"The delivery guy looked at her and asked, \"Are you Ms. Zheng Baozhu?\"\"Yes, the flowers are for me?\"\"Yes, please sign your name here.\"Zheng Baozhu signed her name on the receipt and took the flowers. There was a small card on the bouquet, and she picked it up to read. It had something written on it, signed by Tan Yao.Zheng Baozhu: \"......\"Tan Yao had been showing up at Starlight Farm a lot lately. He said it was because the end of the year was busy at the company and his father kept him tied to work. His presence didn't have much to do with Zheng Baozhu, anyway; whether he stayed in the room here or not, he still had to pay for it on time.What she didn't expect was that despite being tied to work, he still found the opportunity to send her a bouquet of flowers.Xiao Yu curiously craned her neck, wanting to see what was written on the card. Qi Sheng also stood beside her curiously and asked with a smile, \"The flowers are beautiful. Who sent them to you?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"Tan Yao.\"Upon hearing Tan Yao's name, Xiao Yu immediately made a teasing comment, \"Mr. Tan Yao again? I told you, he must be interested in you!\"Zheng Baozhu glanced at her and was about to take the flowers upstairs, \"Alright, stop guessing randomly. Maybe he just likes sending flowers to people? Please remind me to have the robot bring my lunch later, I want to try it.\"\"...Okay,\" Xiao Yu replied, but couldn't help but worry about Qu Zhi again.Not only Xiao Yu was worried, but Qi Sheng also felt concerned. When he returned to the company, he told Qu Zhi about Tan Yao sending flowers to Zheng Baozhu, \"When I was leaving the hotel just now, I saw Tan Yao send Miss Baozhu a big bouquet of roses! Even the receptionist noticed that he's interested in her.\"Qu Zhi was currently testing the robot's obstacle avoidance ability with his colleagues. Upon hearing Qi Sheng's words, he paused slightly and then focused back on the robot, \"Oh.\"Qi Sheng approached him, asking, \"Why aren't you worried at all?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"I am worried. Professor Luo didn't give me much time left, so maybe you should leave the lab first?\"Qi Sheng: \"......\"\"No wonder Miss Baozhu isn't interested in you. You're really wasting your looks,\" Qi Sheng shook his head and sighed as he walked out of the lab.Qu Zhi's gaze flickered as he lowered his head to record the data on the form.In the evening, Qi Sheng left work before Qu Zhi. He went directly to Zheng Baozhu and suggested going to a restaurant in the city together. Zheng Baozhu had been shuttling between the Film and Television City and Starlight Farm, and at this moment, she realized that she hadn't been to the city for a long time!The last time, Bunny's store called and said they had new arrivals, she hadn't found time to go and see!After dinner, she might as well go shopping at Starlight Department Store.\"Oh, by the way, I also invited Old Qu, but he has been working overtime recently, so I don't know if he can make it today,\" Qi Sheng mentioned to Zheng Baozhu as he sat in the front passenger seat.Hearing Qu Zhi's name and remembering last night's incident, Zheng Baozhu nodded and glanced at Qi Sheng in the rearview mirror, \"Qi Sheng, you and Qu Zhi attended the same university, right?\"\"Yes, we had the same teacher, but I graduated two years earlier than him,\" Qi Sheng replied, feeling a bit puzzled. Why did Miss Baozhu suddenly inquire about Qu Zhi today? It seems that she's not completely disinterested in him!Zheng Baozhu asked him, \"So, what kind of person do you think Qu Zhi is?\"\"Sharp-tongued, holds grudges, not easy to deal with,\" Qi Sheng said, \"I used to think he was a Scorpio, but later found out he's actually a Virgo!\"Zheng Baozhu agreed with his assessment, \"I think so too.\"Qi Sheng glanced at her and added, \"Of course, he also has his own good qualities. He's intelligent and patient, which makes him well-suited for research work.\"Zheng Baozhu chuckled, \"Research work can bring fame and recognition.\"\"It's not entirely like that. If he only wanted fame in academia, he wouldn't have returned to the country. Look at how much overtime he puts in every day; he's no different from an ordinary office worker,\" Qi Sheng admired Qu Zhi's dedication to research, \"In fact, with his abilities, he could excel in many fields, but he chose to work on guide robots. He genuinely wants to do something for the people with disabilities.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng Baozhu couldn't help but retort when Qi Sheng praised Qu Zhi so much, \"Exactly, that's what makes his 'for the country, for the people' persona more convincing.\"Qi Sheng questioned back, \"How do you know he's not sincere?\"\"Because I know him,\" Zheng Baozhu replied. She recalled last night when Qu Zhi moved the shared bicycles outside in the cold darkness. She couldn't help but wonder why he did that in the middle of winter.Could it be that he got tired of his own persona?Qi Sheng pondered for a moment and asked Zheng Baozhu, \"Let's say there's a hypocritical person who has done good deeds all their life. Doesn't that make them a good person?\"\"For others, maybe, but for those who know them, it would be considered hypocrisy,\" Zheng Baozhu explained.Qi Sheng leaned forward, gazing at Zheng Baozhu's back, \"I'm curious. Why do you think Qu Zhi's actions are driven by the desire for fame and recognition?\"\"Because I know it's true. He has built such a perfect image that even if he did something bad, no one would believe it,\" Zheng Baozhu said, glancing at Qi Sheng through the rearview mirror, \"Just like you, someone who is deceived by his facade.\"\"...\"Qi Sheng fell silent for a moment, becoming even more curious. \"So, what bad thing did Qu Zhi do?\"Zheng Baozhu hesitated and then held back her words, \"Forget it, I don't want to say. Besides, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe it.\"\"...How do you know I wouldn't believe it?\" Qi Sheng, being a gossip enthusiast, couldn't stand being left in the dark, \"Tell me, and I'll help you analyze it!\"\"Forget it, I get angry when I think about it.\"\"...\"Qi Sheng fell silent.Oh well, he would just go and ask Qu Zhi directly later! He wanted to see what bad thing Qu Zhi had done to leave such an impression on Zheng Baozhu for all these years.At this time, it was the peak of the evening rush hour. Zheng Baozhu's car was stuck in traffic for a while, causing her to arrive at the restaurant later than expected. This restaurant was the first Chinese restaurant she opened in the area and had been in business for many years. Over time, its storefront had expanded several times, and the interior decoration had been renovated a few times. Other nearby shops changed owners frequently, but this restaurant had always stood firm.After parking the car, Zheng Baozhu led Qi Sheng into the restaurant. It was Qi Sheng's first time eating here. The restaurant had a trendy decor, and most of the diners were young people. There were also private rooms in the restaurant, usually reserved for banquets. Today, Zheng Baozhu booked one of these private rooms. The restaurant staff recognized her and promptly led them to the reserved room when they entered.\"This is the menu, take a look,\" Zheng Baozhu handed the menu to Qi Sheng. Qi Sheng glanced at the prices; they were moderate, and he could afford it. He smiled and passed the menu back to Zheng Baozhu, saying, \"I said I'm treating you, so you can order.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu didn't even look at the menu and ordered some signature dishes and seasonal specialties, \"Let's start with these. If Qu Zhi arrives later and we need more, we can order then.\"\"Sounds good.\"The server collected the menu and left. Another person came in to pour tea and serve some snacks to them.After a short while, the server brought Qu Zhi over. Qi Sheng hadn't expected Qu Zhi to arrive so early and looked at him in surprise, \"You're not working overtime today?\"\"Uh,\" Qu Zhi nodded and took a seat at the table, \"I left a bit early today and took the subway.\"\"Oh... no wonder,\" Qi Sheng said, smiling playfully, \"So, you really wanted to have a meal with Miss Baozhu.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi picked up the teacup and took a sip, \"You're overthinking. This meal is on you, so I shouldn't let it go to waste.\"\"...\"Hmph, men.Seeing another person join them, the server handed Qu Zhi the menu. Qu Zhi took a look. Although this restaurant also served Chinese cuisine, it was more delicately designed compared to the dishes in Zheng Baozhu's hotel restaurant, which focused on authentic homestyle stir-fry. Here, the dishes were more elaborate.He ordered two dishes that Zheng Baozhu hadn't picked and then handed the menu back to the server.The restaurant's serving speed was quite good. Before Qu Zhi finished his tea, the dishes Zheng Baozhu ordered were already brought to the table. Qi Sheng tasted a shrimp and nodded repeatedly towards Zheng Baozhu, \"The taste is excellent, and the presentation is so appealing, crystal clear.\"Zheng Baozhu naturally praised her own chef, \"Tonight, all our dishes were personally made by Wang Yuqi. He's now on par with Chef Zhao, a top chef in our restaurant.\"Qu Zhi heard this and remembered the apprentice mentioned earlier, \"Is that the apprentice you mentioned before?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"He is very talented in culinary skills. When Chef Zhao first arrived, some people had prejudices against him because he was young, but now Chef Zhao is our restaurant's top chef.\"Qi Sheng praised while picking up some food, \"His skills are indeed impressive. These dishes may not look extraordinary, but they are delightful when you take a bite.\"Zheng Baozhu added, \"Unfortunately, the kitchen is busy right now, or else I could have introduced you to our head chef. Well, it goes to show that I have good judgment.\"As Zheng Baozhu spoke, she started boasting about how she had chosen the seemingly ordinary Wang Yuqi from among many other candidates back then.It wasn't too late when they finished their meal. Zheng Baozhu had already planned to go to Starlight Department Store and asked Qi Sheng and Qu Zhi if they would be joining her.Qi Sheng tactfully said, \"I won't go; I'll head back first. Qu Zhi can accompany you, and we'll meet back at Starlight Farm later.\"Qu Zhi glanced at Zheng Baozhu but didn't say anything. Seeing that he didn't refuse, Zheng Baozhu thought he probably wanted to hitch a ride in her car, \"Whatever, if he wants to go, let him. I can't stop him.\"\"Then you two can go together, Qu Zhi can help you carry things,\" Qi Sheng arranged for them and excused himself.Starlight Department Store wasn't far from the restaurant. Zheng Baozhu got into her car and noticed that Qu Zhi had opened the passenger side door and bent down to get in. She didn't say anything, just looked at him with a puzzled expression. Qu Zhi seemed oblivious to any discomfort as he fastened his seatbelt and turned to look at Zheng Baozhu, \"Why are you looking at me like that?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu tugged lightly at the corner of her mouth, withdrew her gaze, and started driving.When they arrived at Starlight Department Store, Zheng Baozhu went directly to Bunny's counter. Being a regular customer, she was already a prestigious VIP member, and the store staff warmly greeted her. In the past, when Zheng Baozhu came to buy clothes, she would mostly come with her girlfriends. Today, with a handsome and outstanding guy beside her, the staff couldn't help but steal a few more glances at him.One of the staff members, while helping Zheng Baozhu choose clothes, asked, \"Miss Baozhu, is that handsome guy your boyfriend? Is he a model?\"Zheng Baozhu glanced sideways at Qu Zhi. A man with such a tall and slender figure and a handsome face naturally stood out. Not only were the staff occasionally stealing glances at him, even some customers were looking at him.Qu Zhi's looks indeed caused quite a stir.\"No, he's a scientist researcher,\" Zheng Baozhu replied.The staff member looked surprised and glanced at Qu Zhi again, \"A scientist? I couldn't tell. He has a great physique and a good temperament. Why don't you buy some men's clothing? We have a few new designs that would suit him well.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"No need. He spends all his time in the lab and doesn't have a chance to wear them.\"\"Alright,\" The staff member took out a half-knit gold tie and handed it to Zheng Baozhu, \"I saw this tie and thought it would suit you perfectly! The gold color exudes elegance, and the pattern is subtle and natural.\"\"It really is beautiful,\" Zheng Baozhu felt an immediate liking for the tie; it seemed tailor-made for her.\"Let me put together a set for you. It's the end of the year now, you can wear it for attending events and such.\"\"Alright.\"\"You can also try this bag; it's one of our new arrivals and complements the tie well.\"Zheng Baozhu took a look at the bag; it was nice, but she had received a bag as a gift from Meng Yaxin recently and hadn't had a chance to use it yet. That bag was also sparkling, and it could match this tie as a set, \"I don't need the bag for now; help me find a shirt.\"\"Sure,\" As the staff member brought over the matching shirt, they also brought a few accessories for Zheng Baozhu. She tried them on, and the overall effect was impressive, exuding an aura of luxury.\"Miss Baozhu, this tie looks exceptionally suitable on you. Not everyone can pull off a gold look like this!\" The staff member began showering Zheng Baozhu with compliments, \"And with these accessories, you look so dazzling and luxurious!\"Zheng Baozhu knew they were exaggerating to encourage her to buy the entire set, but it did look good, and she wouldn't regret the purchase. As she changed direction in front of the mirror, she noticed the spot where Qu Zhi had been standing earlier was now empty.The staff member astutely noticed her gaze and said, \"That gentleman just left suddenly without saying anything. He might have gone to the restroom.\"Zheng Baozhu didn't believe he had gone to the restroom; he probably just didn't want to wait around while she tried on clothes. After all, Qu Zhi was never fond of people who dress up with jewelry and accessories.\"Never mind him,\" Zheng Baozhu said to the staff member after she finished looking in the mirror, \"I'll take the entire set.\"\"Sure, sure. Is there anything else you find not quite right? We can make alterations for you.\"\"No need, everything fits well,\" Zheng Baozhu was about to change back into her own clothes when she saw Qu Zhi return. He was carrying a bag with the logo of Sweet Treats, a famous dessert shop. Zheng Baozhu walked over and glanced at the paper bag in his hand, \"You bought some desserts?\"\"Yes,\" Qu Zhi nodded, \"I heard Sweet Treats is famous here.\"Zheng Baozhu understood and responded with an understanding tone. Qu Zhi had a similar preference to her for enjoying desserts. Sweet Treats had been established in the past few years, and as Qu Zhi had spent most of his years abroad, he hadn't been to this place yet for desserts.\"I also bought a piece of strawberry mousse cake; I remember you like this kind,\" Qu Zhi opened the paper bag to show Zheng Baozhu. She lowered her head and peeked into the bag, finding a piece of strawberry cake inside.\"Really? Are you planning to treat me to cake?\" Zheng Baozhu looked at him suspiciously. Qu Zhi cleared his throat and explained, \"You treated me to supper last time, so it's just returning the favor.\"\"Oh...\"\"And besides, I don't have anything to do while waiting here,\" Qu Zhi added.Hearing his words, Zheng Baozhu playfully raised her hand and said, \"Who said you have nothing to do? Can't you help me pick out clothes? Look, how about this one?\"Qu Zhi's gaze stayed on the outfit for a few seconds before he slightly averted his eyes, feeling somewhat uncomfortable, \"It suits you.\"Zheng Baozhu was waiting for him to mock her, but she didn't expect him to respond that way. It almost caught her off guard.What's going on with Qu Zhi? Did he change his stance?Looking at him, Zheng Baozhu said, \"Really? Are you actually praising me? Aren't you supposed to say, 'Huh, I think you should change your name to Zheng Baoqi; it suits you better'.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"He had indeed said that before.Zheng Baozhu observed him curiously when he didn't respond, \"Why do I feel that you've been acting strangely recently?\"\"... Do I?\" Qu Zhi slightly pursed his lips.\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu stated firmly, \"You're not secretly planning something big, are you?\"Qu Zhi remained silent for a moment and then asked, \"Are you done with your selection?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu glanced at him and went to change into the outfit. Afterward, she paid and left with Qu Zhi.On the way back, Qu Zhi still sat in the passenger seat, and Zheng Baozhu realized she had become accustomed to this arrangement.So Qu Zhi was adopting the strategy of befriending the enemy? It must be that; he might be waiting for the right moment to strike!However, he wouldn't have tampered with the strawberry cake, so she could still take it back to eat.Qu Zhi bought himself a matcha fruit mousse cake. After finishing it, he took a shower and prepared to dry his hair before going to bed. After he was done bathing, he put on a bathrobe and held a large towel to dry his hair as he walked out.The phone on the bedside lit up. Qu Zhi picked it up to check. It was a message from Qi Sheng.Qi Sheng: Have you and Miss Baozhu gone back already?Qu Zhi: Just say what you want.Qi Sheng: ...You really lack humor.Qu Zhi: Strange, why should I humor you?Qi Sheng: :)Qi Sheng: Then I'll just say it directly. What bad thing did you do when you were in school that caused Miss Baozhu to have a bad impression of you until now?Qu Zhi: ?Qi Sheng: Stop pretending. She mentioned it today. It seems she was still angry about it.Qu Zhi furrowed his eyebrows. What bad thing did he do when he was in school? He also wanted to ask Zheng Baozhu about it.Qi Sheng: Did you abandon some kid back then? I think that's the mistake you're most likely to make.Qu Zhi: ... My biggest mistake was joining the same company as you.Qi Sheng: :)Qu Zhi put down the phone and didn't bother responding to him further. However, while drying his hair, he kept pondering about this question.What bad thing did he actually do??On the other hand, Zheng Baozhu had finished her cake and went to sleep immediately. She wasn't concerned about the calories or anything like that. The next day, she still didn't receive any acting job, so there was no need to go to the Film and Television City. She realized that in this industry, there were many actors vying for limited roles, and not getting a job was a common occurrence for supporting actors.However, Zheng Baozhu wasn't worried. Without any acting gigs, she continued practicing acting and lines in her room while watching videos. The morning passed quickly. She checked the time and sent a message to Xiao Yu, asking for lunch to be delivered by the robot.These days, Zheng Baozhu had been particularly fond of using the robot and didn't bother going downstairs to eat.At this moment, Xiao Yu was teaching a delivery guy how to use the robot. The delivery guy wore a helmet and listened attentively.\"How is it? Isn't it easy to operate?\" Xiao Yu, who had already learned from Qi Sheng for two days, was now a proficient user of the robot and explained everything to the delivery guy, \"This way, when we're busy, you can also use it on your own. It will save time.\"\"Yeah, got it,\" the delivery guy nodded and lifted the round robot, \"Technology is really advanced nowadays.\"\"Exactly, technology changes lives!\" Xiao Yue said, then noticed a young man walking into the hotel's lobby. He was wearing a big coat and a plaid scarf. After entering, he looked around.\"Hello,\" Xiao Yue greeted him, feeling that the man seemed familiar.Strange, where had she seen this person before?Before she could figure it out, the man had already approached the front desk and said, \"Hello, I'm looking for Liang Huihui.\"Xiao Yue was taken aback, but she finally remembered where she had seen this person!Wasn't this the scumbag, Li Yifan?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter she recognized the person in front of her as Li Yifan, Xiao Yu's attitude took a complete 180-degree turn, and even her usual professional\u00a0smile disappeared: \"Looking for someone? Please go to the police station to report.\"Li Yifan didn't expect the receptionist to be so rude. He stiffened for a moment, then looked visibly annoyed, \"What's with your attitude? Is this how you treat guests at the front desk?\"Xiao Yu replied, \"Of course, we don't treat guests like this. The problem is, are you really a guest? No, you're just a fraudster.\"Li Yifan's face became even more unsightly. He realized that the front desk might have learned about his situation from Liang Huihui and didn't bother arguing further. He turned away and went to find the restaurant.He knew Liang Huihui worked as a waitress at the hotel's restaurant. Although it was his first time here, hotels usually had signs, so finding the restaurant wasn't difficult.Xiao Yu had wanted to stop him, but another guest came down to check out, so she had to handle that first.When Li Yifan entered the restaurant, he spotted Liang Huihui tidying up a table. She was wearing the uniform of the restaurant staff, with her hair tied up in a bun and light makeup on her face. Li Yifan hesitated for a moment when he saw her. It had been a long time since he last saw Liang Huihui, and she seemed more beautiful than he remembered.\"Huihui,\" he approached her and called her name. Liang Huihui froze for a moment upon hearing his voice, then turned to look in his direction.It was indeed Li Yifan, she didn't mishear.Li Yifan looked happy to see her and wanted to hold her hand, but Liang Huihui dodged his attempt. He hesitated for a moment, knowing that she was still angry with him. He adopted a humble posture, trying to coax her, hoping that he could be forgiven, \"Huihui, I know I was wrong this time. I've reflected on my actions. Can you stop being angry, please?\"Liang Huihui pursed her lips and avoided him impatiently, \"I'm working; don't disturb me here.\"Li Yifan still followed her, insisting, \"Huihui, I really know I was wrong. I've broken up with Chen Danni, can you forgive me this time?\"Liang Huihui didn't want to pay him any attention, but his words were so laughable. She stopped and looked at Li Yifan with a mocking expression, \"You broke up? I think she dumped you, didn't she?\"\"...\"Li Yifan bit his lips, wanting to reach out for Liang Huihui again. However, she shook off his hand and, for once, got angry, \"Li Yifan, have some self-respect! She dumped you, and now you come back to find me. What do you take me for? A garbage dump?\"Li Yifan's face stiffened once again. He didn't expect Liang Huihui to speak so harshly. They had known each other for so many years, and Liang Huihui had always cared for him, never speaking to him so loudly.Before he could react, three foreigners entered the restaurant. Liang Huihui saw the guests coming in. She didn't bother with Li Yifan anymore and went to greet the customers. Li Yifan stood aside, watching her fluently communicate with the foreign guests in English, leading them to a table by the window. Her smile was so radiant.Li Yifan felt a bit dazed. When did Liang Huihui's English become so good? Back in high school, she struggled with reading textbooks and pronunciation. She used to be a shy and reserved girl with few friends in high school, and even in their small town, she was not that noticeable.But the Liang Huihui before him was no longer the same person he used to know. She had become smarter, more beautiful, and more confident.Li Yifan couldn't describe the feeling in his heart. Unconsciously, he walked up to her and called her name. Liang Huihui's smile faded when she saw him. Seeing that she still didn't intend to acknowledge him, Li Yifan tried a different approach, \"Can I have a meal here?\"Liang Huihui replied, \"The window seats are all reserved. Did you make a reservation?\"\"Huihui, do you have to be like this?\" Li Yifan took two steps toward Liang Huihui, who instinctively stepped back. As she took a step back, she accidentally bumped into someone. Liang Huihui quickly turned to apologize to the person, \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\"\"Little sister, it's hot today,\" Qi Sheng's voice descended from above. Liang Huihui was stunned for a moment and then raised her head.Sure enough, it was Dr. Qi Sheng standing there.Liang Huihui felt really unlucky.Qi Sheng pulled Liang Huihui behind him and looked at Li Yifan across from them, \"Are you bothering our waitress?\"The commotion at the restaurant had already attracted some guests' attention, some were even pointing at Li Yifan. Li Yifan was still a university student, so he was embarrassed, \"No, I am Huihui's boyfriend.\"Liang Huihui loudly denied it from behind Qi Sheng, \"He's not!\"Qi Sheng looked at Li Yifan and said, \"She said you're not, and if you keep causing a scene, I'll get the security to throw you out.\"Before he finished speaking, Zheng Baozhu arrived with the hotel security. The dining guests rarely encountered such a situation and looked on with interest.After Zheng Baozhu arrived, she didn't waste any words with Li Yifan, immediately instructing the security to lift him up and take him out of the restaurant - the same way she was carried out by the two maids on set that day.\"I apologize for disturbing everyone's meal.\" Zheng Baozhu smiled at the customers in the restaurant and said, \"Everything is fine now, you can continue dining. As an apology, we will offer a complimentary snack to each table later. I wish you all a pleasant meal.\"She repeated the message in English as there were foreigners present in the restaurant.The diners naturally appreciated the gesture. They not only got to witness a scene but also received a free snack.After speaking with everyone, Zheng Baozhu left the restaurant. The two security guards didn't immediately Li Yifan out; instead, they escorted him to the lounge. Zheng Baozhu followed and sat down on the sofa, looking at Li Yifan with a smile, \"Since you're here, let's have a chat. How do you plan to repay the money you owe to Huihui?\"Li Yifan furrowed his brows, asking, \"Who are you? What's it to you?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"I'm the owner of this hotel. You caused trouble here, so it's related to me, isn't it?\"Li Yifan's frown deepened, and he said, \"Did Huihui tell you all of this? It's our private matter; there's no need to make it public!\"This remark amused Zheng Baozhu, \"You have the nerve to say that, yet you're afraid of others knowing? What's so public about it? It wouldn't even make to trending news.\"Li Yifan clenched his jaw and finally managed to say something unoriginal, \"It's our private matter and none of your business.\"\"Get the facts straight. You and Liang Huihui have nothing to do with each other now, and there's no private matter to discuss,\" Zheng Baozhu said, feeling like he needed a reality check, \"If you come here to cause trouble again, I'll call the police.\"\"...I get it. It's you trying to sow discord between us!\" Li Yifan suddenly stood up aggressively, and the nearby security guards immediately stepped forward to stop him.\"Don't come back here; we have surveillance,\" Zheng Baozhu glanced at him and stood up as well, \"What you've done is enough; you don't need anyone to sow discord. Your only connection with Huihui now is the debt you owe her. The next time you appear in front of us, it better be to repay the money.\"After saying that, she gestured to the security guards, saying, \"Get him out of here; he's a nuisance.\"\"Yes, Miss Baozhu!\"The security guards escorted Li Yifan out, but he remained persistent. If the hotel didn't let him in, he waited outside, seemingly determined not to leave until he saw Liang Huihui.When Qi Sheng came out of the hotel, Li Yifan was still standing there. Qi Sheng had bought the meal that Qu Zhi ordered, and after taking a glance at Li Yifan, he walked towards the company.\"Old Qu, your fried rice is here,\" Lately, Qu Zhi had been so busy that he didn't even have time to eat, staying in the laboratory even during lunchtime. Qi Sheng brought the food back for him and took the opportunity to chat with him while he ate, \"When I went to have lunch just now, I saw a young man, who looked like a university student, come to find Liang Huihui. The security guards had to escort him out.\"Qu Zhi paused with the spoon in his hand and asked Qi Sheng, \"Who is he?\"Qi Sheng replied, \"He claims to be Liang Huihui's boyfriend, but she denies it. He's shameless; when I left, he was still lingering outside the hotel.\"Qu Zhi snorted coldly, \"Of course, he has to be shameless. How else could he have the audacity to use Liang Huihui's money to pursue the campus beauty?\"Qi Sheng had heard that something happened to Liang Huihui before, which led to the police being involved, but he never expected it to be about this, \"What? In this day and age, there are still such naive girls? It really proves the saying that being with men leads to misfortune!\"Qu Zhi remained silent for a moment before speaking, \"In a society governed by the rule of law, be careful not to leave any evidence.\"Qi Sheng: \"...\"Qu Zhi was right.As a typical scumbag, Li Yifan's shamelessness knew no bounds. He waited outside the hotel for two hours until Liang Huihui finally came out. Seeing her, Li Yifan's face lit up, and he immediately approached her.\"Huihui...\"Slap!Liang Huihui walked out of the hotel angrily and, upon seeing Li Yifan, gave him a resounding slap.This slap left Li Yifan stunned. In his expectations, Liang Huihui should have felt sorry for him, considering he had been freezing here for two hours, and then should've forgiven him.\"Li Yifan, although you have no face, I still have! Look at what you've done! Do you want to grab a megaphone and broadcast it to everyone? How dare you come to find me?\" Liang Huihui had been holding in her anger and grievances for two hours, and now she finally let it all out.Li Yifan snapped back, covering his stinging face and getting angry as well, \"Do you think I want to be like this? If I don't act this way, will you come out? You think you're the only one who feels wronged? Your friends have been talking about me at the university, now even my grade counselor knows about it! I'm about to take an exam, yet you still have to cause trouble for me at this time?\"\"What do you mean cause trouble? Are you feeling wronged now? Who used my hard-earned money to pursue the campus beauty? Was it someone else?\" Liang Huihui shouted back even louder, \"Do you want to calculate how much money you've taken from me in these two years? Not to mention the monthly allowances I gave you. Just during your postgraduate entrance exam year, I spent thousands of yuan ordering takeout for you at night! Will you ever repay that money, you despicable creature!\"Watching from the hotel entrance, Xiao Yu and others were left speechless.Liang Huihui was truly impressive.Li Yifan felt powerless against her barrage of accusations. Under the scrutiny of the onlookers, he reluctantly looked at Liang Huihui, \"I really don't have money right now, but I'll pay you back when I start working! Having money doesn't give you the right to humiliate others; don't look down on the poor!\"\"Huh, do you think you're some male lead from a drama series?\" Liang Huihui couldn't help but chuckle in exasperation. Li Yifan's arguments were absurd, and she was almost amused to death, \"Even those male leads from drama series would curse you after hearing your reasoning!\"\"You!\" Li Yifan found himself unable to argue with Liang Huihui any further and had to leave in embarrassment. After the heated exchange, Liang Huihui suddenly felt much better. She walked back to the hotel entrance and asked her colleagues who were gathered there, \"How did I do just now?\"Xiao Yu gave her a thumbs up, \"Absolutely perfect.\"\"That's good to hear,\" Liang Huihui sighed with relief, \"It's all thanks to Miss Baozhu's excellent teachings.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"That's too much praise.Coughing lightly, Zheng Baozhu walked up to Liang Huihui with her phone and said, \"I recorded the part where Li Yifan promised to repay you. If he ever tries to default, you can use the video as evidence against him.\"\"Thank you, Miss Baozhu,\" Liang Huihui's eyes welled up again as she wiped away her tears. She turned to the people at the entrance and said, \"Alright, everyone, let's get back to work. I'm fine now.\"\"Yes, everyone, don't stay here. Let's get back to work,\" Manager Wei habitually pushed his glasses up and sent everyone back to their positions.After spending the entire day testing in the lab, Qu Zhi finally let out a sigh of relief. Thinking about what Qi Sheng had said to him at noon, he picked up his phone and opened Zheng Baozhu's WeChat.They had added each other on WeChat for quite a while, but apart from the day he was asked to deliver sanitary pads to her, they hadn't spoken to each other. Qu Zhi thought for a moment, then sent her a message.Qu Zhi: I heard Li Yifan came to the hotel?Zheng Baozhu: Did you hear it from Qi Sheng? He was scolded and chased away.Qu Zhi: Scolded by you?Zheng Baozhu: I played a part, but mainly it was all thanks to Huihui's efforts.Zheng Baozhu: [Video]The video she sent was the footage of Liang Huihui and Li Yifan quarreling. After watching it, Qu Zhi silently sent a thumbs-up emoji.Qu Zhi: Is Liang Huihui okay now?Zheng Baozhu: She's definitely still feeling a bit upset, but there's no major problem.Qu Zhi's fingers paused on the phone screen as he thought about what to send next. Qi Sheng then approached him and teased, \"Old Qu, were you watching some silly short videos just now? I could hear it from here! I didn't know you also like watching this kind of stuff!\"\"...\"Qu Zhi glanced at him and played the video for him. Qi Sheng watched with amazement, \"Wow! This little sister has quite the combat power; she was able to hold her own against the other person's insults. I'll be relieved if my future daughter has this kind of strength.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi curiously looked at him, \"Since when did you start thinking about having a daughter?\"\"I've always thought about it,\" Qi Sheng said, \"I just don't know where the mother of my child is, sigh.\"Qu Zhi ignored his musings. After Qi Sheng sighed, he glanced at Qu Zhi's phone again and said, \"Hey, wait a minute. Were you really that concerned about Liang Huihui? Or were you deliberately finding a topic to talk to Miss Baozhu?\"\"...You're overthinking it,\" Qu Zhi denied.Qi Sheng leaned in, using his keen, curious gaze, scrutinizing Qu Zhi, \"Old Qu, there's something not quite right with you lately.\"Thinking about Zheng Baozhu saying something similar to him last night, Qu Zhi pursed his lips and asked Qi Sheng, \"Is it that obvious?\"\"Well, by saying that, you're admitting it, right?\" Qi Sheng gossiped, getting closer to him, \"What's going on?\"Qu Zhi pushed him away a bit and turned slightly, \"It's nothing. I just realized recently that I did have some misunderstandings about Zheng Baozhu. She's not as thoughtless and soulless as I used to think. She has her own thoughts.\"\"Oh...\" Qi Sheng nodded as he looked at Qu Zhi, \"And then you realized you've developed feelings for her?\"\"Of course not,\" Qu Zhi furrowed his brows and quickly denied Qi Sheng's suggestion, \"I just feel a bit guilty...\"\"Really? What do you feel guilty about?\" Qi Sheng looked at him in surprise, \"I have never seen you feel guilty about me!\"Qu Zhi gave him a glance and walked back to the lab.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySince taking that horror film, Zheng Baozhu hasn't received any supporting roles for many days. Although she has been keeping busy by watching videos and practicing, she can't help but doubt her life choices. If she had known, she wouldn't have been so picky about horror films. Having acting opportunities is so much better than having none at all.With these thoughts in mind, when it was almost time, she picked up her phone and started checking the supporting roles group, hoping for news of any audition.Her luck was good today. The group administrator posted the notice on time, with a special requirement for a supporting role actor\u00a0who could dance.Zheng Baozhu's eyes lit up. That was exactly what she could do! She quickly pasted her information on the post.The list of applicants scrolled by with rows of names. The administrator asked all the applicants to send a dance video, preferably a Chinese dance.This request was tailor-made for Zheng Baozhu. Since her mother tore up her essay about her dream as a star, she knew it was impossible for her family to agree to her studying acting. But dancing? Su Mingxi wouldn't suspect anything. Since Zheng Baozhu liked it, she enrolled her in a dance class. Zheng Baozhu's plan was that if she became an actress in the future, dance skills might come in handy. Even if they didn't, it would improve her overall charm. After all, the more skills, the better.And now, the opportunity had presented itself.Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but sigh. I was really clever from a young age, planning for the future so early.After praising herself, Zheng Baozhu found an appropriate Chinese dance costume in her room. She adjusted the lighting and camera, then started recording her dance video.Perhaps because they had to screen through additional dance performances, the list for today came in quite late. Zheng Baozhu had been waiting until she was almost falling asleep when she heard another notification from the group.The administrator had selected three contract actors, and Zheng Baozhu's name was listed first.\"Great!\" Zheng Baozhu's sleepiness was instantly replaced with joy and she twirled around in place. Seeing the group's notification that they would gather at 8 a.m. the next morning, Zheng Baozhu quickly got into bed to sleep.It had been a long time since she had to go out so early in the morning. When she put on her mask, she was still yawning. She called herself a car, thinking that she might as well take a nap on the way.When she arrived at the hotel for makeup, it was 7:50 a.m. There were already many extras queuing up in the hotel corridor to get their makeup done. Normally, Zheng Baozhu would have to line up with them, but now that she was a supporting actor, she was exempted from the queue!She contacted the makeup artist, who said that the lead actors were getting their makeup done, and after they were done, the contract actors could have theirs. Zheng Baozhu took advantage of this time to have breakfast and review the script.This is a palace drama. The character she's playing is a dancer who was sent into the palace and amazed everyone with her dance in the grand hall. However, her main objective in entering the palace was to assassinate the crown prince, but unfortunately, she was killed by the crown prince instead.Although this character only had one line, she had an important dance scene with many camera shots. Moreover, it was a large-scale production; Zheng Baozhu had previously seen photos shared by netizens on Weibo where the actors' makeup and costumes looked stunning.She started looking forward to her own look.After the makeup artist called her, Zheng Baozhu hurriedly ran up. Her character was from the Western Region, so the makeup had an exotic touch. The eye makeup took an especially long time, as it needed to match the intricate gold accessories. The overall makeup mainly used golden shades. Once the makeup was done, the makeup artist started curling and styling Zheng Baozhu's hair, then began putting on the headpiece, forehead ornament, face decoration, and earrings one by one.Although these accessories were not made of real gold, they were exquisitely crafted and adorned with pearls and sequins, making them look incredibly luxurious.After putting on the necklace, Zheng Baozhu thought it was over, but to her surprise, the makeup artist also brought out bracelets and anklets. The dangling bells rang with every move Zheng Baozhu made.\"Oh my gosh, this looks so beautiful!\" Zheng Baozhu admired her sparkling golden bracelet in the mirror and kept changing angles to appreciate her appearance.\"It will look even better when you put on the costume,\" the makeup artist was also very satisfied with her work. Although she usually did makeup for actors in the film and television city, it was rare to encounter such a stunning actor, \"Can I take a few photos?\"\"Sure,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded and posed for several shots facing the camera.After leaving the hotel, Zheng Baozhu found the car that the crew had arranged for the contract actors. She went with two other actors today, and their glamorous makeup attracted requests for photos from the other actors.After driving for less than an hour, they finally arrived at the grand palace where the filming would take place. It was Zheng Baozhu's first time there, so she admired the scenery before going to collect her costume. The dancer's costume was light and ethereal, with a veil and a sheer outer robe. However, there were no shoes provided this time, so Zheng Baozhu had to temporarily wear her own shoes while walking.Yesterday, the group admin sent the dance video they would be shooting today. Zheng Baozhu quickly glanced at it last night and saw that they were relatively simple routines, so she went to sleep directly. During the makeup session earlier, she had already memorized the dance moves. Unexpectedly, the crew had also arranged a dance teacher, and as soon as she arrived, the teacher took her away to practice dancing.While rehearsing the dance, every staff member passing by would take a few more glances, and even during mealtime, other actors came over to ask for photos together. Zheng Baozhu felt that she looked particularly beautiful today and wanted to commemorate it by posting on her social media. She took a few selfies with her phone and selected the most beautiful one to post on her moments.Zheng Baozhu: Today's appearance is really so beautiful! Ahhhh! [Picture]Quickly, a wave of likes and flattering comments flooded her moments. While Zheng Baozhu was reading everyone's praise, suddenly her mother's message popped up.Mother: What are you doing?Zheng Baozhu: \"......\"Zheng Baozhu quickly tried to make amends: Unified response: taking promotional photos.After this response was posted, the comments' direction changed; everyone started asking for the name of the photo studio.Zheng Baozhu didn't reply, but one of the actors, who was together with her in the supporting cast last time during the horror film, asked with a question mark: \"Aren't you on set?\"Zheng Baozhu sent him a \"hush\" emoticon.The actor understood the situation and sent back a grinning emoticon, adding, \"You look particularly beautiful.\"Zheng Baozhu liked this honest boy.Mother: Show me the photos.Zheng Baozhu: \"......\"For two seconds, she was speechless, and then another like appeared, this time from Qu Zhi.The corners of Zheng Baozhu's mouth slightly lifted. Qu Zhi actually gave her a like?Her fingertips lightly tapped the side of her phone as comments from her mother began to roll in: \"I saw that Qu Zhi liked your photo. Oh, did you finally add him on WeChat?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"......\"From the beginning, she should have remembered to block her mom from viewing her moments.Zheng Baozhu put her phone away, finished eating, and then practiced the dance routine with the two backup dancers before heading to the shooting location. When the director saw her, he teased, \"Hey, here comes the famous dancer the whole crew is talking about.\"The male actor who was playing the emperor heard this and also chimed in, \"Such a beautiful young lady, and you only gave her a minor role? That's too wasteful!\"He was a veteran actor, Zheng Baozhu had seen him in several TV dramas when she was young. Being praised like this by him made her a bit embarrassed.But joking aside, the director had high demands during the shoot. Zheng Baozhu's main part was the dance. To have more material for editing in post-production, the director had them repeat the dance many times and even instructed the cinematographer, \"Close-ups, get direct close-ups, shoot more of them.\"After the shoot, Zheng Baozhu was exhausted. Dancing took much more effort than just acting a normal scene with lines. Also, because of her costume, she didn't wear shoes, so jumping around barefoot started to take a toll on her feet. She hadn't noticed during the shoot, but now that she relaxed a bit, she felt pain in her right ankle.She didn't know when she had accidentally twisted it.She sat in the resting area, massaging her foot for a while, before being called for an additional close-up shot of her character's death scene. Finally, they wrapped up for the day. As her character died, the crew gave her a red envelope as a gesture of good luck. It only contained five yuan, but as it was meant for auspicious purposes, Zheng Baozhu didn't mind.As per the crew's tradition, this red envelope had to be spent before returning home. So, Zheng Baozhu bought a few packs of spicy chips from the small shop near the set.Today, she wore a lot of accessories, and she had to return them all to the makeup artist. The arranged car only took her to the makeup hotel and left afterward. Once she returned everything, she hailed a car to go back. She was glad she had hailed a car today; otherwise, with her current sore feet, she wouldn't have been able to drive back home.By the time she reached Starlight Farm, it was already 9 o'clock. With her feet hurting, she walked with some difficulty.\"What happened to your foot?\" Qu Zhi had just finished overtime and saw Zheng Baozhu limping ahead as soon as he entered the hotel.Zheng Baozhu turned back to look at him and continued dragging herself forward, \"I might have twisted it accidentally, it'll be fine after applying some ointment.\"\"What do you mean 'might have'? If you twisted it, you should know!\" Qu Zhi walked up and bent down to look at Zheng Baozhu's ankle, \"It seems a bit swollen.\"\"It's okay.\" Zheng Baozhu continued moving forward stubbornly, \"I have some medicinal liquor in my room. An overnight rest will make it better.\"Qu Zhi stood still, watching her struggle for two steps before he went forward and bent down to lift her horizontally.Zheng Baozhu was taken aback for a moment, wondering if she had suddenly taken flight. It wasn't until a strong hand held her waist that she turned to look at Qu Zhi in surprise, \"What are you doing?\"Qu Zhi's expression remained unchanged as he said, \"Carrying you up. You won't be able to move by yourself until tomorrow morning.\"\"...You're exaggerating,\" Zheng Baozhu originally wanted to argue with him, but she found that being carried like this was surprisingly comfortable, so she simply stayed quiet. Qu Zhi carried her to the elevator, and with a calm tone, he said, \"Press the elevator button.\"\"......Oh!\" Zheng Baozhu reached out and pressed the button.Xiao Yu stuck her head out and, seeing the two disappear from view, she rushed to their CP group and announced, \"Good news, good news! Just now, just now! Mr. Qu carried Miss Baozhu upstairs! A princess carry!\"Liang Huihui: !Meng Yaxin: !Wei Zhen: Tell us more!Cen Tongtong: No, I don't want to hear.In the elevator, Zheng Baozhu rested her head on Qu Zhi's chest, watching as the elevator numbers slowly climbed. Outside, she hadn't noticed anything, but inside the confined space of the elevator, she realized that her position with Qu Zhi was overly intimate. She could even hear Qu Zhi's strong and forceful heartbeat.One beat after another, powerful and rhythmic.Her ears felt a little warm, but fortunately, their floor wasn't too high, and the elevator door soon opened. Qu Zhi carried her all the way to her room's entrance. This time, Zheng Baozhu had learned from the previous experience and used her fingerprint to open the door.Qu Zhi carried her inside and used his foot to close the door behind them. Zheng Baozhu watched the door slowly shut and began to feel uneasy.This... didn't seem right.As she pondered whether it was appropriate or not, Qu Zhi had already placed her on the sofa. He didn't seem to have any intention of leaving; instead, he took off his jacket and draped it over the side, then stood in front of the sofa and asked Zheng Baozhu, \"Where is your medicinal liquor?\"Looking at the person before her, rolling up his shirt sleeves, Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but look doubtful. \"Are you planning to administer the medicine to me?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"En, that's exactly what I was thinking.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She knew Qu Zhi was acting strange! Could he be possessed by something weird?\"If you have something to say, just say it straight. Don't do these unnecessary things,\" Zheng Baozhu warned as she watched him cautiously.Qu Zhi stood still, pursing his lips, and then turned around to look in the TV cabinet's drawer.Zheng Baozhu had indeed placed the medicinal liquor there.\"Here. Roll up your pants a bit,\" Qu Zhi said, sitting down next to Zheng Baozhu without any hesitation. Zheng Baozhu looked at him and hesitated for a moment, but Qu Zhi waited a while and then reached out to help her.\"I can do it myself!\" Zheng Baozhu blocked his hand and rolled up her pants on her own, putting her foot aside. Upon inspection, her ankle was slightly swollen and had a bruise, confirming that she had indeed twisted it.\"What were you doing today?\" Qu Zhi poured some medicinal liquor into his hand and warmed it up.Zheng Baozhu noticed that he was acting quite professional, so she didn't resist as much and replied, \"Nothing much, just dancing all day.\"Qu Zhi recalled the photo she posted on her Moments today; she indeed looked like a dancing girl from the Western Region. He chuckled lightly and applied the medicinal liquor in his hand to Zheng Baozhu's ankle, \"See? You didn't even need me to tell on you; you got yourself in trouble.\"Zheng Baozhu forced a smile, \"Huh, in the end, didn't I still fulfill my obligation?\"Qu Zhi nodded, \"Remember to show the photos you took to Aunt Su.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She felt like her mom would probably forget about this in a few days! Yeah!Qu Zhi applied a little more pressure with his hand, and Zheng Baozhu immediately exclaimed, \"Qu Zhi, I knew you had ulterior motives! You did this on purpose!\"Qu Zhi glanced at her, \"This is just a normal technique. If you're so afraid of pain, why weren't you more careful while dancing?\"Zheng Baozhu defended herself, \"There were so many cameras focusing on me while I was dancing! How could I notice this! Hey, can't you be more gentle!\"\"Being gentle won't be effective,\" Qu Zhi said, but he did ease up a bit, \"It would be for best to rest indoors for a few days, don't walk.\"\"That's not possible,\" Zheng Baozhu said, \"This job lasts for three days in total, I have to go back to the film set tomorrow.\"Qu Zhi frowned slightly, \"Are you sure you'll be able to dance tomorrow?\"Zheng Baozhu pursed her lips and explained, \"The dance is already done today. The next two days I should be on standby at the set to re-shoot any scenes if needed.\"Qu Zhi looked at her, poured a bit more medicinal liquor into his hand, and warmed it up with his palm, \"While at the set, has anyone told you that you look like Su Ming?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"Why do you ask?\"Qu Zhi said, \"If you take advantage of your relationship with your aunt, you wouldn't have to push yourself so hard, and you could get much better roles.\"\"Hmph, you're a scientist, and yet you have such thoughts!\" Zheng Baozhu accused him righteously, \"So, does that mean when you write a research paper, you can just put your mom's name on it and get it published in top journals?\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Zheng Baozhu often accused him of being proud, but he didn't think Zheng Baozhu was any better either.\"I want to succeed as Zheng Baozhu, not just as Su Ming's niece.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sons, brothers, and sisters of certain famous individuals continue to emerge, and unless you achieve more fame than those famous figures, the label of being someone's son, brother, or sister will follow you forever.Zheng Baozhu hoped that in the future, when people mention or introduce her, they won't think of her as \"Su Ming's niece\".When Qu Zhi heard this, he slightly tightened his grip on her injured ankle, and then said with a light smile, \"You have integrity.\"\"Of course,\" Zheng Baozhu elegantly reclined on the sofa and started envisioning her future. \"Think about it, once I become even more famous than my aunt, people won't call me Su Ming's niece. They will introduce me as 'Zheng Baozhu's aunt'. A complete reversal, isn't it exciting?\"\"...\"Qu Zhi remained silent for a moment, \"Yes, who said that a sparrow cannot aspire to be a phoenix.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu raised the back of her hand and playfully tapped Qu Zhi's arm, \"Who are you calling a sparrow?\"Qu Zhi smiled and stepped back without answering. Zheng Baozhu looked at the seemingly hidden smile on his face and suddenly felt a bit uneasy, \"Qu Zhi, just be honest with me, what kind of big move are you planning?\"Qu Zhi looked at her and asked, \"What do you mean?\"\"Don't pretend,\" Zheng Baozhu fixed her gaze on him, \"You carried me up to my room and applied medicine, and considering your recent behavior, I have reasons to suspect that you are planning something big. If you have a move, just show it to me, stop scaring me like this.\"Qu Zhi loosened his grip, looked at her, and a hint of annoyance showed between his slightly furrowed eyebrows, \"Zheng Baozhu, it's true that we've never gotten along since we were young, but think about it, every time you were in trouble, did I not help you?\"\"Um...\" Zheng Baozhu was momentarily speechless. Qu Zhi was right; he had always been there to help her in difficult situations. After all, he was the one who scared away the little dog that was frightening her.Wait a minute... Zheng Baozhu suddenly remembered something, \"Back then, when I was two yuan short in buying those fish, you didn't lend me the money!\"Qu Zhi raised an eyebrow, \"I told you at that time those little fish were dyed artificially and wouldn't survive for long. Some unscrupulous shopowners thought of this idea to deceive elementary school students.\"\"I don't care about that. Anyway, you didn't lend me the money!\"\"Heh, if I had lent it to you, you would have blamed me when the fish died.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"That was undoubtedly true. She would have definitely held him responsible if the fish died.Awkwardly clearing her throat, Zheng Baozhu glanced at Qu Zhi beside her, \"But you dare to say that in front of the shopowner without fear of getting beaten.\"Qu Zhi replied, \"I'm just a primary school student. If he had beaten me in front of a bunch of students and parents at the school gate, he would have completely ruined his business.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu fell silent. So, primary school students were this powerful? Then she should have told the shopowner back then, 'I'm a primary school student, so you should give it to me for free! And buy me an ice cream too!'\"Okay, don't get your feet wet tonight, and don't walk too much these two days,\" Qu Zhi closed the bottle of medicine and stood up from the sofa, \"I'll head back now.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded and thanked him, \"Thanks.\"Qu Zhi responded with a low \"Hmm\" and picked up his coat before leaving Zheng Baozhu's room. After he left, Zheng Baozhu raised her right foot and tested it slightly. It seemed to be much better than before.The medicine worked well.Wearing slippers, she hobbled to the wardrobe and changed her clothes, then freshened up a bit before lying down on the bed to rest.Her phone, placed on the bedside table, lit up. Zheng Baozhu picked it up and checked it.Wow, Cen Tingting had been sending messages for the past hour and even made two phone calls in between.\"...\"Zheng Baozhu glanced at the incoming messages and replied with a slight exasperation, \"Aren't you active enough in the CP group? Why not just leave it altogether?\"Cen Tingting: You finally replied! My goodness, how long has it been! Is it even useful for you to reply now? Everything that needed to be done has been done!\"...\"She couldn't quite understand what Cen Tingting was saying.Zheng Baozhu: I put the phone on silent on the set; I forgot to switch it back. I haven't seen any messages.Cen Tingting: So, what were you two doing just now?Zheng Baozhu: I twisted my foot, Qu Zhi helped me apply some medicine.Cen Tingting: Just that? Is Qu Zhi not capable enough??Zheng Baozhu: ...She couldn't figure out whether Cen Tingting wanted to eat her keyboard or not.Zheng Baozhu: Going to bed early tonight.Cen Tingting: Are you sleeping alone or with someone else?Zheng Baozhu: ...With my big bunny doll :)After sending this message, Zheng Baozhu put her phone on [Do Not Disturb] mode and covered herself with the blanket to sleep.The next day, the supporting actors were set to assemble at 8 AM. Zheng Baozhu naturally took a taxi to the location. Her makeup was the same as the day before, but she didn't have to dance anymore. Zheng Baozhu had a leisurely day, sitting in the resting area most of the time, wrapped in her down jacket. She only went out to shoot a scene or two when required.Staying on the set, Zheng Baozhu had nothing else to do, so she casually scrolled through Weibo, played some games, and checked her friends' updates when needed.Qu Zhi's moments were posted out of boredom.His moments had no creativity, always filled with pictures of his beloved plants. Zheng Baozhu opened the photos and enlarged them. Surprisingly, he took good care of them. They had bought these plants together at the flower market. Zheng Baozhu's money plant was barely holding on, but Qu Zhi's Chinese money plant looked flourishing....Indeed, the Chinese money plant was way more impressive than the money plant!She closed the pictures and noticed her mother's avatar appearing below Qu Zhi's moments, indicating she liked it.Zheng Baozhu smiled.Then she watched as the two of them shared their new planting experiences in the comments....While Zheng Baozhu silently criticized them, she copied their words into the notes app, planning to save her struggling money plant.When it was getting dark, the director released Zheng Baozhu. She happily packed her things and waited outside for the crew's car to pick her up. While standing there, a man wearing a black down jacket and a black mask approached her. Zheng Baozhu glanced at him and then looked down at her phone.\"I'm the director of [New Moon Wuxin Sword]. Are you interested in auditioning for our crew?\" The man spoke, sounding quite young.Zheng Baozhu was somewhat surprised as, during her time at the Film and Television City, many people had come up to her with various claims. Some said they were assistant casting directors for a crew, some said they were from a talent agency, and some even claimed to be talent scouts. In this place, there were all kinds of people, so Zheng Baozhu had learned to be cautious and refused those who seemed unreliable.But this man was different\u2014his confidence stood out!Among all the people who approached Zheng Baozhu, the most boastful were those who claimed to be casting directors, and their crews were relatively unknown small productions that Zheng Baozhu had never heard of. However, this man directly introduced himself as the director, and he mentioned the movie name, [New Moon Wuxin Sword].Even if one didn't watch Wuxia dramas, they would have definitely heard of this name. Since the 1980s, this work had been repeatedly remade, and many well-known actors had played its roles. Even Zheng Baozhu's aunt, Su Ming, had played the lead role in one of its versions.While it may not be the most classic version, it was indeed a significant one. Even to this day, whenever this work was mentioned, it was impossible to avoid referring to Su Ming's version.This young man actually approached her with such a big opportunity?Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but wonder if he was too amazing.\"Are you interested?\" The man asked again when Zheng Baozhu remained silent, \"Although the main roles have already been cast, we are still recruiting actors for some supporting roles.\"Zheng Baozhu tilted her head and rubbed her reddening nose due to the cold, \"Are you serious?\"\"Why wouldn't I be?\" The man seemed to suddenly realize something, \"You don't think I'm a scammer, do you?\"\"Oh no, of course not,\" Zheng Baozhu laughed twice, \"It's just that there are quite a few scammers around here, and you seem so young...\"\"Aren't you young too? Can't young people be directors?\"\"Well, that's true.\"\"Let's exchange contact information then,\" The man took out his phone, \"Send me your actor profile, and once the audition schedule is confirmed, I'll notify you.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu thought that adding each other on WeChat was no big deal. Since the existence of WeChat, she had come across men asking to add each other for various reasons.Perhaps this person just wanted to connect via WeChat?Ah... is this what they call a modern-day dilemma?After scanning his WeChat, she casually asked, \"For casting supporting roles, does the director have to personally handle it?\"\"I didn't come here specifically to look for actors. I just happened to see you while meeting someone else,\" the man said.\"I see,\" Zheng Baozhu replied. The man left after saying that.On her way back, she checked the director's moments. It seemed all related to the preparations for the drama and didn't look like those of a scammer. While scrolling, she noticed he had posted a new status.Gao Boyun: To prove that I'm not a scammer, here's a photo. [Image]The photo was a picture of him with Lin Ziqin, probably taken just now on the set.Zheng Baozhu lightly raised her eyebrows as she thought about his earlier comment about meeting someone. Did he mean he met Lin Ziqin?After some consideration, she sent a private message to Gao Boyun.Zheng Baozhu: Director Gao, I also took photos with Lin Ziqin. [Image]Zheng Baozhu: We can take a photo together too. [Picking Nose]Gao Boyun: ...After a while, Gao Boyun sent the chat record between himself and Lin Ziqin to Zheng Baozhu. He only shared the part that didn't involve Lin Ziqin's private matters. Zheng Baozhu took a look and found that Gao Boyun had shown the photo they took together to Lin Ziqin, and surprisingly, Lin Ziqin remembered it.Zheng Baozhu: Director Gao, there's no need to do this. I believe you.Gao Boyun: Heh, aren't you worried that the Lin Ziqin on the other side is fake?Zheng Baozhu: [Picture]Zheng Baozhu: I just searched your name online, and it's clearly stated in the encyclopedia!Gao Boyun: ...Oh.Zheng Baozhu smiled, realizing that chatting with young people should be more relaxed. After looking up Gao Boyun's information, she understood how he was able to become the director of [New Moon Wuxin Sword] at such a young age.The reason was simple: his father was the renowned director Gao Tianming. :)Now, not only were there second-generation stars in the entertainment industry, but second-generation directors were also starting to emerge.However, Gao Boyun couldn't be considered a newcomer; he had previously directed a web drama. Though the production had limited investment, it still made some waves online. Perhaps because he delivered a decent performance despite the low budget, his father gave him the opportunity for this new take on a big IP.[New Moon Wuxin Sword] was undoubtedly a major IP with its inherent popularity. Just by shooting the drama, it would attract attention\u2014both criticism and praise. Such projects are generally out of reach for ordinary people. It was apparent that Gao Boyun secured this project with his father's support. Moreover, the drama had a significant investment, and Gao Boyun was likely there to discuss the male lead role with Lin Ziqin.If he could secure Lin Ziqin, Young Director Gao could be considered to have a bright future ahead.After confirming the legitimacy of the project and the director, Zheng Baozhu naturally began to take this opportunity seriously. Even though only a few supporting roles were left, transitioning from an extra to a supporting role represented a qualitative leap! Not to mention that this was [New Moon Wuxin Sword]!Zheng Baozhu felt that her previous actor profile might be a bit outdated, so she had a new one professionally taken, which she then sent to Gao Boyun.Gao Boyun: I thought you wouldn't send it to me. [Picking Nose]Zheng Baozhu: I updated my profile! Yesterday's data can no longer match the present me!Gao Boyun: ...Okay.Zheng Baozhu: Thank you, Director Gao, for giving me this opportunity!Gao Boyun: ...Young people are indeed adaptable.Zheng Baozhu:\"Miss Baozhu!\" Liang Huihui ran over to Zheng Baozhu, who was sitting by the window, having lunch. Zheng Baozhu lifted her eyes from the phone screen to look at Liang Huihui, \"What's up?\"Liang Huihui said cheerfully, \"Didn't Xiao Yu help me put the necklace and scarf on the second-hand website for sale? Well, the necklace has been sold, and I've already received the money! It's over three thousand yuan!\"\"Wow, that's great!\"\"Hehe!\" Liang Huihui smiled happily, \"I thought about it; I didn't go to the group dinner last time. So this time, I'll treat everyone to a meal and karaoke! Are you available tonight?\"Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"Yes.\"\"I'm not working the night shift tonight, so let's go tonight.\" Liang Huihui said, adding, \"I've also invited Mr. Qu!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Once she said that she knew this meal won't be just a simple one!However, since Liang Huihui was treating, and she wanted to invite Qu Zhi, Zheng Baozhu couldn't object. Besides, with Qu Zhi's busy work schedule, he might not be able to attend.However, Zheng Baozhu's hopes were destined to be dashed. At the dinner that evening, Qu Zhi appeared on time at the hotpot restaurant.\"...\"Zheng Baozhu looked at Qu Zhi sitting beside her and couldn't help but say, \"I noticed that Dr. Qu's 'overtime' is very flexible. It's very considerate of them not to let you work overtime whenever someone invites you out.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi remained silent for a moment before saying, \"We consider this as being flexible and adaptable.\"\"Heh,\" Zheng Baozhu smirked, waiting for the hotpot to start boiling. She couldn't help but notice how Liang Huihui had cleverly placed Qu Zhi next to her; it was as if she was fueling the CP fans' hearts.\"I've booked the KTV next to this hotpot place. Xiao Yu and the others sang here last time, and they said the sound system is excellent,\" Liang Huihui said while brushing the meat.It had been a long time since Zheng Baozhu last sang karaoke, and the KTV Liang Huihui mentioned was a new one she hadn't been to yet. After brushing the meat, she said to Liang Huihui, \"You should keep the money for yourself and use it for gatherings like this, going out to sing and eat with friends is great.\"\"Yeah!\" Liang Huihui placed the brushed meat into a bowl, \"I haven't heard Miss Baozhu sing yet, why don't you have a duet with Mr. Qu later!\"Zheng Baozhu & Qu Zhi: \"...\"There's absolutely no need for that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qu Zhi, who had never liked such noisy gatherings, walked alongside them. Zheng Baozhu looked at Qu Zhi and asked, \"Aren't you working tomorrow? Are you still going to sing tonight?\"Liang Huihui, who was walking ahead, overheard the conversation and turned around, saying, \"We considered that everyone has to work tomorrow, so we'll only sing until 11 pm!\"Since the hotel belonged to the service industry, there were no days off. As she had to work the day shift tomorrow, she didn't plan on staying out too late.Hearing this, Zheng Baozhu didn't say anything else. Liang Huihui reserved a large private room. As soon as they entered, they were provided with a fruit platter and a few bottles of beer. After Xiao Yu entered the room, she and Liang Huihui went to choose songs, whispering and occasionally glancing at Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"In any case, it would be impossible for them to sing a duet.With Xiao Yu and Liang Huihui singing, the atmosphere in the private room quickly heated up. Previously, Xiao Yu was considered the karaoke queen in such gatherings, but today Liang Huihui sang even more passionately, even surpassing Xiao Yu for several songs.\"Huihui, you can't keep singing alone; it's cutting into other people's songs,\" Xiao Yu urged Liang Huihui while eating watermelon from the fruit platter. Liang Huihui acknowledged with an \"oh\" and quickly made a selection on the screen during the instrumental break.After this song ended, the room was filled with the lively prelude of an old MTV, followed by a very vintage-looking music video on the screen.\"Here it comes, Miss Baozhu and Mr. Qu's song!\" Liang Huihui and Xiao Yu each held a microphone and handed one to Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"No, singing a duet is already awkward enough, why do they have to choose such an ancient song? Do they think they can't sing modern songs?Also, she and Qu Zhi aren't that much older than these two girls.\"I don't know this song,\" Qu Zhi straightforwardly put the microphone back on the table. Zheng Baozhu followed suit, saying, \"I haven't even heard it before!\"\"What?!\" Xiao Yu looked surprised at both of them, \"This song is so famous; how come you both don't know it?\"\"Yeah, even I know it!\" Liang Huihui chimed in from the side.Zheng Baozhu clapped her hands. \"Perfect, you two can sing it then! Go on!\"\"...\"Liang Huihui and Xiao Yu had to follow the instructions given by the boss; they picked up the microphones and started singing. They were telling the truth; they sang the song effortlessly, even imitating the dance moves from the old MTV.After they finished singing, they playfully picked another song for Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi. Zheng Baozhu quickly stood up and said, \"I'll go out and buy some snacks for you guys!\"Liang Huihui didn't even have a chance to refuse before Zheng Baozhu hurriedly pushed open the door and went outside.When Zheng Baozhu came in earlier, she noticed there was a small supermarket inside the KTV. Although buying snacks here was much more expensive than outside, they mainly made money from drinks and room fees, so they could still profit.The KTV's decoration was quite psychedelic, and everything looked similar. Since it was her first time here, Zheng Baozhu couldn't find the small supermarket they passed earlier. She was about to ask a staff member when she heard someone calling her name, sounding pleasantly surprised, \"Miss Baozhu? Are you here to sing?\"Zheng Baozhu turned around and saw Tan Yao, whom she hadn't seen for a long time.She smiled and nodded, saying to Tan Yao as he walked over, \"We're here for a gathering with colleagues. Are you here to sing too?\"Tan Yao replied, \"This KTV is run by my buddies! We like to hang out here after we finish work!\"\"Oh... I see.\"Tan Yao had been pressed to work at his father's company for a while now, so it had been a long time since he last saw Zheng Baozhu. He was worried about how to meet her, now she came looking for him on her own. What a coincidence!Opportunities like this should be seized without hesitation. Tan Yao immediately said enthusiastically, \"Today, your expenses here are on me. Whatever you want to eat, just order!\"\"Well... I'm not so sure about that.\" Zheng Baozhu hesitated a bit.\"There's nothing to worry about. You guys are at my place; there's no reason for you to pay. If word gets out, wouldn't it ruin my reputation?\" Tan Yao said firmly.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"As long as you're happy.Zheng Baozhu originally came out to buy snacks, so Tan Yao took her to the small supermarket. Zheng Baozhu carried a shopping basket and didn't want to take too much. Tan Yao directly brought a small cart and started throwing things into it.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Finally, with Tan Yao pushing a cart full of snacks, they returned to the private room.When they saw Tan Yao and Zheng Baozhu coming in together, the singing in the private room momentarily stopped. Liang Huihui stood up from the sofa, looking surprised, and asked Tan Yao, \"Mr. Tan? What are you doing here?\"Tan Yao replied, \"This place is run by my buddies and we happened to be hanging out here today.\"\"Oh...\" Liang Huihui was regretting it now. If she had known earlier, she would have preferred to walk a bit further and choose a different KTV!The cart that Zheng Baozhu pushed into the private room also drew everyone's attention. After exchanging greetings with Tan Yao, their eyes fell on the cart. Zheng Baozhu laughed and said, \"All of these snacks are courtesy of Tan Yao.\"\"Yes, everyone, please don't be polite,\" Tan Yao warmly invited everyone to enjoy the snacks. Liang Huihui took some food off the cart and looked at Qu Zhi, asking, \"Mr. Qu, is there anything you'd like to eat?\"Qu Zhi glanced at the cart full of snacks and sat on the sofa without taking any, \"It's all processed food, eating these high-calorie snacks late at night isn't a good idea.\"Liang Huihui hesitated as she reached for the potato chips, \"Then maybe I won't eat either.\"\"Why not? Don't listen to him.\" Tan Yao glanced at Qu Zhi and handed the potato chips to Liang Huihui, \"Eating a little won't make you gain weight. Indulging occasionally is not a problem!\"Qu Zhi raised his gaze and also looked at Tan Yao, \"Mr. Ling doesn't seem like the occasional indulging type.\"Tan Yao initially wanted to refute him, but suddenly realized something was wrong, \"No, who is Mr. Ling? My last surname is Tan.\"\"Oh, sorry,\" Qu Zhi apologized insincerely, \"I often confuse things and thought you were 4.\"Tan Yao: \"...\"Can we stop mentioning that number!\"You're such a strange person...\" Tan Yao rolled up his sleeves, as if he was going to argue with Qu Zhi, \"Is your way of speaking always like this?\"Zheng Baozhu nodded from the side, \"Yes.\"Tan Yao: \"...\"Xiao Yu glanced at the three of them, smiling to defuse the situation, \"Anyway, let's not stand around, let's continue singing!\"\"Yes, let's continue singing,\" Liang Huihui chimed in.Tan Yao enthusiastically suggested, \"Baozhu, let's sing a duet together!\"Xiao Yu: \"...\"If Qu Zhi had half of Tan Yao's enthusiasm, their CP ship would already be sailing. :)Tan Yao reached for the microphone, but Qu Zhi acted first, taking the microphone from the table, \"It's my turn for the next song.\"\"...Sure,\" Tan Yao smirked, \"You go ahead and sing.\"Liang Huihui quickly put Qu Zhi's chosen song at the top of the list.Qu Zhi selected a song by Li Shen, known for his deep and magnetic voice. While it wasn't as challenging to sing as Gu Xin's songs, it still required good vocal skills, especially demanding vocal range.As soon as Qu Zhi started singing, his magnetic voice captured everyone's attention. His speaking voice was already pleasant to listen to, but when he sang, it became even deeper and more melodious. Qu Zhi didn't rely on elaborate techniques while singing; it was mainly the natural quality of his voice that stood out.Zheng Baozhu had known Qu Zhi for many years but hadn't heard him sing many times. Today, Qu Zhi joining them at the KTV was already out of the ordinary, and now he was enthusiastically singing a song?...However, truth be told, he did sing quite beautifully.The entire private room was immersed in Qu Zhi's magnetic voice. After the song ended, Xiao Yu led the applause, giving Qu Zhi praise. Liang Huihui also applauded and looked at Qu Zhi, saying, \"Mr. Qu, you sang so beautifully! Let's have another song!\"Qu Zhi certainly didn't sing another song; he handed the microphone to Tan Yao, displaying gentlemanly manners, \"Let... Mr. Tan take the next song.\"He intentionally emphasized the pronunciation of \"Tan\".Tan Yao, who was just flirting about singing a duet with Zheng Baozhu earlier, now pushed it away, \"Yeah, I think you're right. Singing also requires proper order. I'll wait a bit longer.\"All the flirting aside, who would want to follow after him? He set the standard so high. If he were to sing after him, wouldn't it be a bit embarrassing for him?\"Let the others sing first.\"By doing this, Tan Yao made the most regrettable mistake tonight because he realized that since he handed the microphone to Liang Huihui and the others, it never returned to his hands again.At 11 o'clock, Xiao Yu's alarm clock rang. After turning it off, she said to everyone, \"It's 11 o'clock; let's head back.\"Just as Tan Yao was about to propose playing Truth or Dare, he was taken aback, \"Going back so early?\"Xiao Yu replied, \"Yeah, we have work tomorrow, and our place is quite far.\"Qu Zhi picked up his coat and stood up from the sofa, \"Remember to take your belongings.\"Tan Yao watched as they started packing up and silently put down the cards in his hand.\"Thank you for the snacks, Mr. Tan,\" Liang Huihui said as she packed the snacks into her bag. Although they hadn't finished all the snacks, they could take them home. Luckily, everyone had brought large bags, or else they wouldn't have been able to fit all the snacks!\"We'll be leaving now,\" Zheng Baozhu smiled at Tan Yao and walked out of the private room with everyone else.Soon after, only Tan Yao was left in the private room, and the microphone finally returned to his hands.He chose the song [A Night Alone] and started wailing and howling in the room all by himself.One of Tan Yao's friends approached from outside and glanced at Tan Yao, \"What's going on? Did they leave so early?\"\"Yeah, they said they have work tomorrow,\" Tan Yao replied and continued wailing and howling.After listening for a while, his friend couldn't help but cover his ears, \"Brother Tan, did you get dumped by that Ms. Zheng?\"\"What dumped? Don't say that!\" Tan Yao rebuked him with a sense of justice, \"Spreading rumors can lead to legal consequences!\"\"Tsk, in the process of trying to charm others you put yourself in trouble,\" his friend retorted.\"Hmph, as if that would happen!\" Tan Yao responded, but then he thought about tonight's Cheng Yaojin1, and added, \"But there are many others interested in pursuing her, there's even a childhood friend.\"At this moment, Zheng Baozhu and Zheng Baozhu's childhood friend were sitting in the car on the way back. Zheng Baozhu was driving, and she glanced at him in the rear-view mirror, \"Did Tan Yao offend you in any way?\"Qu Zhi thought for a moment and said, \"No.\"Zheng Baozhu didn't believe it, but then again, Qu Zhi had only met Tan Yao once before, so she couldn't figure out where he might have offended him.The witty Xiao Yu spoke from the back seat, \"Is Mr. Qu jealous?\"Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi: \"...\"\"I believe he didn't offend you,\" Zheng Baozhu quickly changed her tone, \"Maybe he's just naturally unlikable.\"\"Hmm,\" Qu Zhi responded nonchalantly.\"But Mr. Qu, your singing tonight was really good! Let's go together next time!\" Liang Huihui extended another invitation. They didn't get to hear a duet from Miss Baozhu and Mr. Qu tonight, so they couldn't just give up now!Qu Zhi paused for a moment and said, \"Then next time, let's invite Qi Sheng too; he's especially good at singing.\"Liang Huihui: \"...\"That won't be necessary.When they returned to Starlight Farm, it was already 11:40 PM and everyone went back to their rooms yawning. Despite feeling tired, Zheng Baozhu still insisted on taking a shower. Even though she was feeling so sleepy, after she lay on her bed, she suddenly wanted to play with her phone for a while.Zheng Baozhu checked Weibo on her phone and found marketing accounts already starting to spread rumors about Lin Ziqin possibly starring in a big IP. She guessed these rumors were deliberately released by the production team to generate some hype.And just as she was thinking about the director, Gao Boyun, she received a message from him: The audition time is set for the day after tomorrow at 2:30 PM.The message was followed by a location of a hotel.Zheng Baozhu: Wow, Xiao Gao, you're still not sleeping at this hour? Truly dedicated.Gao\u00a0Boyun: Flattery won't work on me. I won't go the day after tomorrow; the casting director and several other main creative members will go instead.Zheng Baozhu: \u2026Oh, then I'll go to sleep first. [goodnight.jpg]Gao Boyun: Heh.Gao Boyun was indeed busy until now. [New Moon Wandering Sword] was an opportunity he fought hard to get, and there were many excellent actors working in it, so he held significant power. If he could remake this old classic into a new classic, his reputation in the industry would be solidified. If not, he would still be renowned in the industry, just in a bad way.Just as he got up from the computer, someone knocked on his door, \"Boyun, are you asleep?\"Hearing the voice, Gao Boyun hesitated for a moment and walked up to open the door for him, \"Dad, you're still not sleeping this late?\"Gao Tianming, wearing a coat and slippers, walked in, \"I was just looking at the actor profiles you posted. I want to talk to you about something.\"\"Oh...\" Gao Boyun followed him to the sofa and sat down, \"Dad, you said before that you wouldn't interfere with my casting.\"Gao Tianming chuckled, \"I didn't say I would interfere. I just wanted to ask, where did you meet Zheng Baozhu, the supporting actress?\"Gao Boyun didn't expect him to suddenly ask about Zheng Baozhu, but upon careful consideration, it wasn't too surprising, \"I met her at the film studio. I was waiting there for a ride, and I noticed she had good conditions, so I got her contact information. Dad, do you also think she looks a bit like Su Ming?\"Gao Tianming didn't answer but instead asked him, \"Did you choose her because she looks like Su Ming?\"\"Not exactly, I just felt she stood out at first glance, and when I got closer, I noticed she also resembled Su Ming.\"\"Mm...\" Gao Tianming responded, seemingly lost in thought, and didn't speak for a while.\"What's wrong?\" Gao Boyun asked.\"Nothing,\" Gao Tianming straightened his clothes and stood up from the sofa, \"By the way, how long did you schedule the pre-production meeting?\"\"The day after tomorrow afternoon, in the studio.\"Gao Tianming nodded and said to him, \"If there's nothing else, go to bed early. Even young people shouldn't stay up all night.\"\"Mm...\" Gao Boyun watched his dad walk away, feeling a bit puzzled. So, his dad came over in the middle of the night just to ask him that question?...It's evident that Director Gao really likes Su Ming.The next day, a middle-aged couple arrived at Zheng Baozhu's hotel early in the morning. When Xiao Yu saw them coming, she smiled and asked, \"Good morning, are you here to stay?\"The middle-aged woman in a padded jacket looked around and said, \"We're not staying at the hotel. We're here to find Liang Huihui.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Could this middle-aged couple be the reinforcements sent by that scumbag Li Yifan?Maintaining a smile on her face, she asked, \"May I ask who you are?\"\"We're her parents.\"Xiao Yu was taken aback for a moment, then looked them up and down, smiling as she said, \"Please have a seat here, Uncle and Auntie. Let me check for you.\"Leading Liang Huihui's parents to the sofa in the lounge area, she also brought them a pot of lemon water. Back at the front desk, she sent a message to Liang Huihui to come and take a look. Qi Sheng walked into the hotel from outside, glanced at the couple in the rest area, and then walked over to the front desk with a smile, \"I'm here to do a consumer follow-up on the robot.\"Qi Sheng had arranged to follow up with them today. Xiao Yu knew he was coming but still couldn't help but be surprised, \"Mr. Qi, are you starting work this early?\"\"Yes, after the follow-up, I'll be going back to the lab to work,\" today's follow-up was mainly to understand the consumers' usage and see if there were any issues or suggestions for optimization. If the robots had any problems, they could also make adjustments on-site for the consumers. Qi Sheng thought that they were the best in the industry and that consumers wouldn't go wrong buying their robots.He looked again at the couple sitting in the rest area and asked Xiao Yu in a low voice, \"Who are those people? They don't look like tourists.\"Xiao Yu replied in a hushed voice, \"They say they are Liang Huihui's parents, but I'm not sure if it's true.\"As soon as she finished speaking, Liang Huihui hurriedly walked over from the direction of the restaurant. When she saw the couple sitting on the sofa, she quickly walked over to them, \"Dad, Mom, why are you here?\"Father Liang snorted impatiently and looked at Liang Huihui, \"If we didn't come, wouldn't you go crazy?\"Liang Huihui pursed her lips and sat down across from them, \"Dad, Mom, I'm still at work. How about you wait for me in the employee dormitory?\"\"What's wrong? Are you afraid of embarrassment? How did you treat Xiao Fan when he came to find you?\" Father Liang sat firmly on the sofa, showing no intention of moving, \"We'll talk here so that your colleagues can hear it too.\"Liang Huihui sat on the other side; her father played the role of the bad cop, while her mother played the good cop, \"Huihui, we know about you and Xiao Fan. Xiao Fan indeed made a mistake and he has admitted it to us. But think about it, do you have no faults at all?\"Liang Huihui glanced at them and replied, \"Of course, I have faults. I shouldn't have given him that money!\"\"You're just being short-sighted!\" Father Liang angrily slammed the sofa, \"You're just a service staff, how high can your salary be? What's that little money you gave him? When Xiao Fan starts working, do you think he can earn more than you?\"Hearing him say this, Liang Huihui's expression wasn't as good as before, \"What does it matter if he earns more than me? It would be good enough if he can return my money!\"\"Hey, you two, stop arguing,\" Mother Liang stepped in to mediate, \"Huihui, you're just talking nonsense. You and Xiao Fan have been together since high school, for so many years. Both of our families assume that you will get married in the future. After you get married, his earnings will naturally be related to you.\"\"Mom, I think you're thinking too much,\" Liang Huihui sneered, \"He used my money to pursue other girls. What about when he starts working? Won't he find more mistresses? Even if he has money, he'll spend it on those mistresses!\"\"Huihui, don't be so impulsive. Xiao Fan came to us crying and apologized when he came that day,\" Mother Liang held Liang Huihui's hand and tried to persuade her earnestly, \"He promised us that he won't do it again. Can't you give him a chance to change? I know you're angry now, so all you see are his flaws. But think about his good side, back then, when his mother was sick, he took care of her while studying. What a filial child, right? Weren't you attracted to him because of this?\"Hearing this, Liang Huihui also remembered Li Yifan's past actions. Her eyes slightly reddened, and she said to her mother, \"Mom, people can change. If he can cheat once, he can cheat again. Yes, he's filial, but that's to his mother. There's only one mother, but there are many women.\"\"Why are you so stubborn?\" Father Liang angrily took over the conversation again, \"Just think about it. With just a high school diploma, what can you do in the future? Do you plan to be a service staff for your whole life? The fact that Li Yifan is willing to come and apologize to us shows that he still cares about you! Getting married to him is better than being a service staff for your whole life, isn't it?\"Liang Huihui looked at him and said, \"Even if I'm a service staff for my whole life, I'm self-reliant!\"\"You!\" Father Liang was agitated and stood up from the sofa; Mother Liang pulled him and advised him to speak properly. Qi Sheng walked over and sat next to Liang Huihui, \"Uncle, Auntie, sorry for interrupting. I just overheard a bit from the side, and I feel that you're thinking about this matter too pessimistically.\"Father Liang, seeing a stranger approach, suppressed his anger and looked the person up and down, asking, \"Who are you?\"Qi Sheng smiled and said, \"My surname is Qi, I'm a friend of Liang Huihui.\"Father Liang and Mother Liang, observing his refined appearance and sophisticated demeanor, remained silent for a moment. Qi Sheng smiled and said to them, \"Why do you assume that Liang Huihui will be a service staff for her whole life? At her age, she should be studying at university. Also, people her age have infinite possibilities for the future. They are in the best stage of their lives.\"Father Liang and Mother Liang, who were not well-educated people and rarely interacted with such individuals, were a bit taken aback by Qi Sheng's words. He seemed to make a lot of sense, leaving them momentarily speechless. However, Father Liang quickly found a counter-argument, \"You said it yourself, that's someone who has gone to university! What about Huihui? Her high school grades were poor. How can she compare to Li Yifan, who's about to take the postgraduate entrance exam? I just don't understand why a high school student like her dares to look down on others?\"Liang Huihui wanted to say something, but Qi Sheng held her back and spoke to Father Liang, \"Uncle, when we evaluate a person, we shouldn't just focus on their education. Diligence, progress, bravery, kindness\u2014are all excellent qualities in a person. Liang Huihui is your daughter, you know her strengths better than I do.\"Father Liang pursed his lips, showing signs of calming down. After a moment of silence, he asked Qi Sheng, \"Can you make a living with all that you said?\"Qi Sheng smiled and replied, \"Indeed, when we look for jobs, employers may value education more, but that's not a problem. Perhaps you're not familiar with our country's policies, but our country has always encouraged continuous education and improving one's qualifications. Many universities have special programs for adult education. As long as one passes the adult university entrance examination, they can continue studying on university campuses.\"Liang Huihui was taken aback. She never knew that she could continue studying at a university. Her parents also seemed surprised; they had never considered such an option and were a bit stunned.Father Liang glanced at Qi Sheng and said, \"Mr. Qi, right? I can see that you're an educated person, and what you said may be valid, but not everyone is like you, suited for studying. Huihui had poor grades, that's why she started working after high school. Can she start studying again now? Is it worth it?\"\"Of course,\" Qi Sheng said confidently, \"It's never too late to study.\"Perhaps because Qi Sheng's words were too overwhelming, for a moment, no one said anything. Zheng Baozhu, who had been standing nearby for a while, walked up with a smile and greeted Father Liang and Mother Liang, \"Hello, Uncle and Auntie, I am the owner of this place.\"Father Liang and Mother Liang stood up when they saw the owner approaching. Apparently, they didn't expect the owner to be such a young and attractive person, so both of them were a bit stunned. Zheng Baozhu smiled and invited them to sit down, \"I understand what worries you, Uncle and Auntie. Some elders always think that getting married is more important than education. This mindset may take some time to change. But it's okay. Even if Huihui gets married one day, Li Yifan isn't the only man in the world. There are plenty of men who are better than him. Why can't Huihui choose someone else? I know what you want to say \u2013 you think Huihui only has a high school education and is a service worker, so it's hard to find someone better than Li Yifan, right? Then, as long as Huihui becomes better herself, won't she have better options? So we should still support Huihui to pursue her education.\"Father Liang and Mother Liang: \"...\"After a moment, they straightened themselves up and composed themselves.Mother Liang looked at Liang Huihui sitting across from her and asked, \"Do you still want to continue studying? You know our family's financial situation; we can't afford to send you to university\u2026\"\"Mom, I'm already working now, and I have a salary,\" Liang Huihui interrupted, \"Even if I decide to continue studying later, I can earn the tuition myself.\"Father Liang glanced at her, \"So, you really plan to continue going to university?\"Zheng Baozhu playfully called him, \"Uncle, there's nothing wrong with studying. I know you're worried that if Huihui doesn't achieve much in her studies, she won't be able to find anyone better than Li Yifan when she decides to get married. But that's not true, Uncle. Remember before, Huihui only knew boys from your town, and the most remarkable one was Li Yifan, right? But now, Huihui knows our Dr. Qi too.\"As she said this, she pointed at Qi Sheng sitting on the sofa.Father Liang and Mother Liang immediately looked in that direction.\"\u2026\"Qi Sheng suddenly felt uneasy.\"Dr. Qi, as in he has a Ph.D.?\" Mother Liang asked, a bit taken aback. While they knew that this person was undoubtedly an educated man, they didn't expect him to have such a high level of education.Zheng Baozhu continued, \"Yes, he works in the nearby Science and Technology Park. He even recently bought a house in the High-End Talent\u00a0Community!\"Qi Sheng: \"\u2026\"He understood now; Miss Baozhu is sacrificing himself to convince Liang Huihui's parents.The way Father Liang and Mother Liang looked at him changed compared to just now. Zheng Baozhu didn't stop there; she also pointed at the delivery robot placed at the front desk, \"Look, that's the delivery robot we developed with Dr. Qi. He is today for a consumer review.\"\"Oh, you're already using robots for delivery?\" Mother Liang looked at Qi Sheng with excitement in her eyes, \"Dr. Qi is so excellent; he should already be married, right?\"\"Heh, they are researchers. How could it be that easy for them to get married?\" Zheng Baozhu leaned in and whispered to Mother Liang, \"He and his friends haven't settled down yet either.\"Qi Sheng: \"\u2026\"She's truly squeezing out my last remaining value. :)Father Liang and Mother Liang exchanged pleasantries with Qi Sheng for a while but didn't mention Li Yifan again.\"We should get going now,\" Mother Liang took out some local specialties from her bag and handed them to Liang Huihui, \"These are some local specialties we brought for you and your friends. You especially love this beef; your father bought it for you yesterday.\"Zheng Baozhu stood up with them and courteously suggested, \"Uncle and Auntie, are you in a hurry? How about having lunch before you leave?\"\"No, it's alright. We have some matters to attend to back home; we don't want to delay any longer,\" Father Liang said, picking up his bag and heading toward the exit. Liang Huihui followed to see them off.In the hotel's rest area, Qi Sheng was still sitting on the sofa, watching Zheng Baozhu scanning the local specialties, \"I truly admire Miss Baozhu. I now understand how you've built your business so successfully. It's all thanks to your eloquence and persuasiveness.\"\"You're flattering me,\" Zheng Baozhu waved her hand modestly, \"Some older generations have fixed mindsets that are difficult to change. Debating with them here won't be useful. We're not trying to make them agree with these viewpoints today; we just want them to support Huihui in continuing her education. So, we need to persuade them using their own ways.\"\"Well said. You truly are a promising entrepreneur,\" Qi Sheng said with a smile, \"So, you sacrificed me for this purpose, right?\"\"Well, uh\u2026 Haha, it's just that you happened to be here,\" Zheng Baozhu handed him a bag of local specialties, \"It's all about fate. Here, try some local specialties from Huihui's hometown.\"Qi Sheng held the bag and continued smiling, \"If it were Qu Zhi who was here today, would you have sacrificed him too?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"Of course! But I guess Huihui's parents wouldn't have been interested in him. I don't want to bring harm to Huihui.\"\"Heh!\" Speaking so much, isn't she just reluctant?!As they were chatting, Liang Huihui returned. Seeing her, Zheng Baozhu asked, \"How did it go? Did Uncle and Auntie trouble you again?\"\"No,\" Liang Huihui shook her head, \"But they said that if I want to continue studying, I have to pay for it myself. They won't help.\"\"It's alright. If you really want to study, I'll have the restaurant schedule your shifts so that your salary remains the same, but you'll have more time to prepare for exams and save some money. By the time the new university year starts, you'll have enough for tuition, and during vacations, you can work here part-time.\"Liang Huihui felt touched, \"Thank you, Miss Baozhu.\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and said, \"These are just minor things. The important thing is for you to think carefully about whether you want to continue studying and if so, what major you want to pursue.\"\"Yes, I'll give it serious consideration!\"Qi Sheng stood up, \"You guys continue chatting, I'll go on with the follow-up.\"\"Wait,\" When Liang Huihui saw that he was about to leave, she instinctively stopped him. Qi Sheng turned back and asked, \"What's wrong? You're not trying to take back the bag of local specialties, are you?\"\"No, no.\" Liang Huihui felt a bit embarrassed and handed the bag of beef over to Qi Sheng, saying, \"This... this is delicious, you should try it.\"Qi Sheng looked at the beef in his hand and smiled, \"Not bad, you know how to show gratitude. Helping you today wasn't in vain.\"Qi Sheng waved the bag at them and went back to his work.Since Liang Huihui's situation was resolved, Zheng Baozhu returned to her room to prepare for the audition. The hotel location that Gao Boyun sent was near the Film and Television City, and on the day of the audition, Zheng Baozhu had eaten in advance and drove over by herself.When Qi Sheng and Qu Zhi came to have lunch, Zheng Baozhu had already left. Qu Zhi had been staying in the lab for a while and even had his meals brought to him by Qi Sheng. Today was an exception. They ordered three dishes and a soup; Liang Huihui brought the dishes over to serve them.Qu Zhi looked around and asked Liang Huihui, \"Where is Zheng Baozhu?\"\"She had something to do today, so she left already,\" Liang Huihui replied.Qi Sheng teased Qu Zhi, \"Are you missing Miss Baozhu?\"Qu Zhi glanced at him but didn't respond. Liang Huihui placed the last dish on the table. Qi Sheng looked at it and exclaimed, \"We didn't order this dish.\"\"This dish is a gift from me to you,\" Liang Huihui put away the tray and smiled at them, \"I have already made up my mind. I want to continue my studies at the university and study Business Administration. After graduation, I can come back and help Miss Baozhu manage the hotel! I know Miss Baozhu has been busy with other things. Since she is helping me achieve my dreams, I also want to take care of the hotel well, so that she can pursue their dreams without any worries!\"Qi Sheng, holding the chopsticks, listened to her passionate words, and then said, \"It's a good idea, but you have to pass the entrance exam first. If you get in, you have to graduate successfully, and after graduation, you'll have to compete with others for a job.\"Liang Huihui: \"......\"Qu Zhi looked at Qi Sheng and said to Liang Huihui, \"Don't mind him. Since you've made up your mind, give it your all. As long as you have no regrets, that's what matters.\"\"Yes, thank you, Mr. Qu! I'll do my best!\" Liang Huihui carried the tray with enthusiasm and left. Qi Sheng served himself a bowl of rice and sighed, \"Rare, Old Qu, you can actually speak like a human.\"Qu Zhi said, \"Well, at least one of us should speak like a human.\"\"Uh...\" Qi Sheng pushed the bowl of white rice toward Qu Zhi and changed the topic, \"You weren't there the other day, you didn't see Miss Baozhu's persuasive skills; it was quite impressive. Miss Baozhu is genuinely good; bosses like her are like national treasures.\"\"En,\" Qu Zhi responded vaguely. Since the last gathering, he hadn't seen Zheng Baozhu again.He wondered what she was busy with.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng Baozhu was still on her way to the\u00a0audition location.The audition location usually takes place at a hotel. But, there would be other actors auditioning on-site besides the main creative team, so there should be a lot of people. So, there was nothing to be afraid of. However, still sent her location to Wang Jingyi after arriving, just in case.These past two days, Zheng Baozhu watched the web drama directed by Gao Boyun before, and although she could tell that his filming was somewhat immature, she really liked his camera work. Gao Boyun's previous web drama was also in the martial arts genre, and he seemed to have a preference for that world of chivalry, enjoying the sense of justice and revenge in it. The world he depicted through his lens had that kind of chivalrous spirit he admired, so if he could fully express himself in this production, the visuals would surely be impressive.The core of a television drama had always been its script. Although [New Moon Wuxin Sword] had the original work as its foundation, it was not known how the production team was going to adapt it, especially for a drama that had been remade several times. Everyone hoped that they could bring some fresh elements to the story.Zheng Baozhu only received the audition-related part of the script and didn't know the full details of it, but the section she had read was well-written.Today, she was vying for the role of Ye Ling, the first major character she had received until now. In the original work of [New Moon Wuxin Sword], Ye Ling was a divine healer who saved the male lead after he fell off a cliff with severe injuries. She soon developed feelings for him as they spent time together. The male lead lost his memory from the fall and he temporarily forgot about the deep enmity he carried with him, so the time he spent with Ye Ling in the mountains could be considered as the most relaxed and purest period of his life. After regaining his memory, the male lead naturally left, and to avoid involving Ye Ling in his affairs, he told her he would return once he resolved everything.In the end, he did come back, but with another woman by his side.Ugh, a scumbag. Zheng Baozhu cursed in her heart.Ye Ling's role wasn't extensive, totaling no more than five episodes. But in the many remakes, the writers always liked to be innovative with this character. Some turned her into a white lotus, others into a villain, or changed her into someone seeking revenge. However, no matter the changes, the core of this character remained the same - hopelessly in love with the male lead.When Gao Boyun chatted with Zheng Baozhu about the script last time, he specifically mentioned that this time, Ye Ling had been modified. This time, Ye Ling was portrayed as a cold and indifferent divine healer who would say there was no need for the male lead to come back after he left.Zheng Baozhu was thrilled by this development.Upon arriving at the studio, Zheng Baozhu parked her car and sent her location to Wang Jingyi. Wang Jingyi quickly replied, \"Have you arrived? You can do it! Don't be nervous!\"Zheng Baozhu: Okay! If I successfully secure the role, I'll send you a big red envelope!Wang Jingyi: I'm waiting!Zheng Baozhu put away her phone and pressed the elevator button to go upstairs. Inside the hotel elevator, she received information from the crew. After arriving at her floor, as soon as she stepped out of the elevator, she saw actors lined up for the audition, so she didn't have to worry about finding the place.The place was truly crowded. There were four roles to be cast today, two male and two female. Zheng Baozhu quietly joined the end of the queue. In the corridor, she could see not only the actors waiting in line but also those who had received the script and were preparing for their performances. Zheng Baozhu was relatively calm at first, but now she started to feel a bit nervous due to the atmosphere on the scene.Fortunately, the queue didn't take too long; it was faster than the last time she auditioned for a supporting role. When she walked into the room, she took a moment to look around.Unlike the audition photo sent by Wang Jingyi, this crew had booked an executive suite, which was more spacious. The living room was filled with people, including actors auditioning and members of the creative team. There were some snacks and drinks on the table, and the place looked relatively tidy, much more comfortable than the last crew she and Wang Jingyi had auditioned for.In addition to the people in the living room, there was also a man sitting on the stage. He wore a mask and a hat, sitting alone in a corner, not interacting with anyone, only occasionally glancing around the room.Based on Zheng Baozhu's experience, this person might be an important figure, at the very least, the most influential person in this room.After a few actors had finished their auditions, it was finally Zheng Baozhu's turn. The casting director and several creatives asked her a few questions before letting her perform a scene. Zheng Baozhu felt she did well; after all, she had been practicing her lines and acting during this period, and even her teacher praised her for significant improvement.After the performance, they asked about her availability. For an actor like Zheng Baozhu, there was no issue with availability, and she immediately assured them that she was flexible and available at any time.The casting director nodded and told her to wait for the results. Zheng Baozhu was about to leave when the man who had been sitting on the stage suddenly spoke, \"Hey, young lady, come over. Let's have a chat.\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback. None of the previous interviewees had gone over to chat with him after the audition. Now, he specifically called her for a conversation; was it because of her age?She took a peek at the several creatives sitting in the living room when the casting director chuckled and said, \"Just go over; he won't eat you.\"\"...Alright,\" Zheng Baozhu slung her bag over her shoulder and walked over, smiling at the man on the wicker chair, \"Hello, Teacher.\"\"Sit,\" the man pointed to the chair opposite him and said. His voice sounded mature, probably older than the creatives who interviewed them. But even in this face-to-face conversation, he didn't take off his mask.Zheng Baozhu was increasingly suspicious that he was someone important, and because he didn't want to be seen, he didn't take his mask off.But she couldn't ask about it, she could only smile and take a seat in front of him.\"Are you Zheng Baozhu?\" the man asked as he started the conversation. Without waiting for Zheng Baozhu's response, he handed her a business card. Zheng Baozhu took the card and glanced down at it.The name \"Gao Tianming\" was impressively written on it....Goodness, since Little Director Gao couldn't come today, Big Director Gao has filled his shoes??Zheng Baozhu cleared her throat and greeted him, \"Hello, Director Gao.\"Gao Tianming waved his hand, saying, \"This production is from Boyun Productions. I just came here to take a look today.\"\"Alright, got it,\" Zheng Baozhu replied with a smile.Gao Tianming looked at her and said, \"You don't need to be too formal. I just want to chat with you casually. How did you decide to become an actress?\"Zheng Baozhu was a little surprised by his question. Why would they talk about dreams before the audition? But since Director Gao asked, she replied honestly, \"There's no special reason. I've just loved it since I was young, so I decided to pursue it.\"Gao Tianming nodded and asked again, \"Being an extra must be tough, right?\"\"It's challenging, but I also learn a lot from it,\" Zheng Baozhu smiled, \"Besides, which industry isn't tough?\"Gao Tianming also smiled, looking at her, \"You're a beautiful and hardworking girl. You remind me of Su Ming.\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback. She knew that Gao Tianming was acquainted with her aunt since he had directed several movies with Su Ming. Even the movie [Spring No More] had Gao Tianming's name listed as the director.However, she didn't expect him to suddenly bring up Su Ming in the conversation.Gao Tianming remained relatively calm, \"You don't have to be so surprised. I've heard your name mentioned before. It's been so many years, but I still remember that name...\"Gao Tianming spoke with a hint of emotion, \"Baozhu, it's indeed a good name.\"Zheng Baozhu didn't say anything and Gao Tianming continued, \"I attended your aunt's funeral and even met you there. But you probably don't remember.\"Zheng Baozhu did recall Su Ming's funeral because at that time her family held strong reservations about the entertainment industry, thus, they kept the funeral low-key, inviting only close relatives and not people from the entertainment circle.Gao Tianming might have attended as a representative from the entertainment industry, but Zheng Baozhu didn't have much of an impression back then, as she didn't have a clear concept of prominent directors.\"In fact, I was quite surprised when you decided to enter the entertainment industry, considering your family's strong opinions about it due to Su Ming's situation,\" Gao Tianming added.After a moment of silence, Zheng Baozhu spoke, \"They do have reservations about the entertainment and I understand their concerns, but I don't think that means they are right. I wanted to be an actress. It's been my dream since I was little, so that's why I'm here.\"Gao Tianming didn't say anything; he seemed to be contemplating something. After a while, he spoke again, \"I watched your performance just now. I can tell you've had some training in acting, and your delivery of lines is good. If you continue to take supporting roles or small roles like Ye Ling, where the screen time is limited, your current level is sufficient.\"Zheng Baozhu looked up at him and asked, \"What do you mean, Director Gao?\"Gao Tianming said, \"If you want to climb higher, become a nationally or even internationally renowned actress, then you are far from there yet. You have talent and charisma, but your understanding of acting lacks a more systematic and profound approach. Your current performance is mostly imitation, imitating what your teachers have taught you, so you haven't developed your own style yet. In the end, your performance needs to have your own interpretation.\"Zheng Baozhu nodded slightly. She was aware of everything Gao Tianming mentioned, but reaching the level he described required not only innate talent and insights but also the guidance of a great teacher. However, finding such a teacher wasn't an easy task. Everyone strived to get into top universities because they had the best teachers to provide the finest guidance.Gao Tianming took a pen and wrote on a notepad in the room for a while, then tore out a page and handed it to Zheng Baozhu, saying, \"Next Tuesday, go to this address and find this teacher with the last name 'Ge'.\"Zheng Baozhu was somewhat perplexed as she received the paper. On it was indeed an address in the old city district, and beneath the address, the word \"Ge\" was written. There was no phone number or other contact information.\"What is this for?\"\"You just need to go there at the appointed time.\"Though Zheng Baozhu had some doubts, she still put the paper into her bag, \"Alright, thank you, Director Gao.\"\"Mhm, you can go back now.\"\"Okay, goodbye, Director Gao,\" Zheng Baozhu stood up, slung her bag over her shoulder, and walked out.In the corridor, there were still many people waiting in line, showing that the competition this time was intense. There was no guarantee of being selected, but worrying about it now wouldn't help. She should wait for the results calmly.Walking to the elevator, Zheng Baozhu noticed that the two actors who had auditioned with her earlier were also waiting there. When they saw her approaching, the two of them whispered to each other. Zheng Baozhu guessed they were definitely talking about her. It was natural to have thoughts when someone was called for a separate chat after the audition.After the elevator doors opened, the three of them entered together. The executive suite was on a higher floor, so the elevator slowly descended. One of the other actors couldn't resist and asked, \"Who was the person you were talking to just now on the stage? What did he talk to you about?\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and replied, \"Nothing much, he just asked me some questions and gave me a few pointers.\"\"Is that so?\" the other actor nodded in response, but it was uncertain how much they believed her. Suddenly, the elevator shook, and the lights flickered on and off. The two actors next to Zheng Baozhu were frightened and looked around in panic, \"What's happening? What's going on?\"Before they could finish their question, the elevator rapidly descended again, causing both of them to scream in fear.The descent was brief, lasting only a couple of seconds before the elevator stopped once more. However, the two actors who were in the elevator with Zheng Baozhu were already terrified, tears welling up in their eyes. Zheng Baozhu pressed the emergency button and pulled them up from the floor, \"Don't crouch down; follow my lead and stand up straight.\"Both of them stood up trembling, afraid that the elevator might descend again. One of them asked anxiously, \"Is the elevator malfunctioning? What do we do now?\"Zheng Baozhu pressed all the remaining floor buttons, but the elevator didn't respond, \"It seems to be malfunctioning. I already pressed the emergency button, you can try calling this number. The signal inside the elevator is weak, so try dialing it several times.\"The person next to her dialed the number several times, but none of the calls went through. They panicked and cried out, \"We can't get through on the phone! What do we do? Are we going to be stuck here and die?\"\"We won't,\" Zheng Baozhu said, feeling a bit scared herself, but she had to calm them down because they were even more frightened than her, \"Elevators have steel cables, emergency brakes, limited speed, and safety clamps. Unless all these things fail, the elevator won't fall.\"Zheng Baozhu replied calmly. Influenced by her calm composure, the two actors also calmed down a bit, \"How do you know all this?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"A top student told me before. He's now a scientist. You may not believe me, but you should believe him.\"The two individuals pursed their lips and stood in the elevator. Zheng Baozhu also walked over, trying to make a phone call while reassuring them, \"Unless we are really unlucky and all the things I mentioned earlier have malfunctioned, the elevator will not fall. It will only stay here until the maintenance team comes to rescue us.\"After hearing her words, the two individuals also picked up their phones and dialed the number again. This time, the call finally went through. The staff member on the other end of the line tried to comfort them, \"Don't worry; the maintenance team has already rushed over. They will rescue you soon! Now, all you need to do is stay calm and don't be afraid!\"The successful call seemed to symbolize that their luck wasn't so bad after all. The maintenance team arrived shortly and opened the elevator doors to pull them out one by one. Zheng Baozhu was the last one to come out. After coming out, she tidied her hair and then looked at the apologetic hotel manager, \"I also work in the hotel industry, so we are in the same field. Elevators must be regularly inspected; waiting until something happens to think of maintenance is too late.\"\"I'm really sorry; our elevators are regularly inspected. This time was indeed an accident,\" The hotel, to comfort them, also gave each of them a small gift and a bottle of hot milk.Since the three of them got out of this situation unharmed, there was no further investigation. Zheng Baozhu held the bottle of hot milk and went outside to retrieve her car. The two actors, who were lingering nearby, approached her, \"Thank you just now. If it wasn't for you, both of us would have been terrified.\"\"No problem,\" Zheng Baozhu smiled at them.The actor who tried to probe her earlier felt a little embarrassed and said, \"I might have been a bit abrupt just now because I noticed that only you were called for a separate chat. So, I was a bit suspicious. But in fact, you performed really well just now, better than both of us.\"\"It's alright, don't worry about it,\" Zheng Baozhu replied.After chatting a bit with them, the two actors took a taxi and left. Zheng Baozhu went to her car, opened the door, and sat inside. After fastening her seatbelt, she didn't immediately start the car. Instead, she sat in the car, took a deep breath, and then opened the bottle of milk to take a big sip.The warm milk flowed into her stomach, making Zheng Baozhu feel warm all over. She picked up her phone and posted a new status on her social media.Zheng Baozhu: I was so scared just now, wuwaa QAAAQAfter posting the status, Zheng Baozhu took another deep breath, put her phone aside, and was about to drive the car. However, her phone started vibrating. Zheng Baozhu glanced at it and saw Qu Zhi's name on the caller ID.Her eyes widened slightly. Why was Qu Zhi calling her?The phone kept vibrating without stopping. Zheng Baozhu picked up the phone again and answered the call.Before she could say anything, Qu Zhi's voice came through the receiver, \"Zheng Baozhu, what happened to you?\"Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment and subconsciously asked him back, \"What happened to me?\"Qu Zhi's voice sounded a little annoyed, \"Then what's the meaning of the status you just posted?\"Zheng Baozhu understood; Qu Zhi must have seen her social media post, so that's why he called her.Leaning back in her seat, Zheng Baozhu asked Qu Zhi on the other end of the phone, \"Qu Zhi, do you still remember the year we got trapped in the elevator on Meng Yaxin's birthday?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng\u00a0Baozhu still remembered that day when she wore a new dress and used her mom's curling iron to style her favorite curls. She happily set out.Meng Yaxin had reserved a table at the rooftop restaurant of the hotel and invited some close classmates to join her for a meal. Originally, they hadn't planned to invite Qu Zhi, but Mother Meng, who was treating them, insisted on inviting the top student of their grade to encourage others to learn from him.Meng Yaxin thought that Qu Zhi might decline the invitation given his cold and distant personality. However, to her surprise, Qu Zhi readily accepted the invitation to join them for dinner.Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi lived in the same neighborhood, and theoretically, they could have gone together, but their relationship had always been rocky, so they both chose to take separate taxis.Although they set out separately, they arrived at the hotel at almost the same time.As both of them got out of their cars simultaneously, Qu Zhi glanced at Zheng Baozhu, who was dressed up for the occasion, and without saying a word, he walked into the hotel. Although he didn't speak, Zheng Baozhu already understood a thousand words from his eyes.\"Qu Zhi, what do you mean by that look just now?\" Holding the gift prepared for Meng Yaxin, Zheng Baozhu caught up with him and asked, \"Can't stand seeing me, huh?\"\"...\"Qu Zhi remained silent and walked straight to the elevator, pressing the button. Zheng Baozhu didn't want to take the same elevator with him, but when she saw the other elevators had long waiting periods, she reluctantly decided to go in with him.In the elevator, it was just the two of them. Zheng Baozhu looked Qu Zhi up and down and asked, \"Are you empty-handed? What about your birthday gift?\"\"In my backpack,\" Qu Zhi replied.Zheng Baozhu glanced at Qu Zhi's backpack. Oh my, who would bring a backpack to a classmate's birthday banquet. :)He wouldn't be preparing to perform a math test for everyone later, right? :)Thinking about this, Zheng Baozhu looked at him suspiciously, \"Did you prepare a set of test papers to give everyone as a birthday gift?\"\"...\"\"You're thinking too much.\"\"That's good, then,\" Zheng Baozhu then picked up the little gift box she prepared and waved it in front of Qu Zhi, \"This is the lipstick I got for Meng Yaxin. It looks really nice.\"Qu Zhi glanced at it and said, \"Makeup is not allowed at school.\"\"That's fine; she can use it when she goes to university. Anyway, we'll be graduating soon,\" Thinking about this, Zheng Baozhu was a bit excited. She heard that Qu Zhi was planning to study abroad, which was great news.Zheng Baozhu! You can finally get rid of the disaster that is Qu Zhi!Just as she thought of the word \"disaster\", the elevator suddenly shook and the lights went out.Zheng Baozhu let out a high-pitched scream in fright. Fortunately, the lights quickly came back on, but the elevator was still stuck. Zheng Baozhu looked at Qu Zhi in the corner and asked nervously, \"What's happening?\"Qu Zhi remained in his place but stepped forward to press the buttons for other floors. When there was no response, he pressed the emergency call button and said, \"It seems like it's malfunctioning.\"\"Malfunctioning?\" Zheng Baozhu turned pale when she heard those three words. She instantly imagined various scenes from movies and TV shows where elevators plummeted to the ground, \"No way, why do you look so calm as if nothing is happening?\"Qu Zhi turned around and glanced at her, \"Then what should I do? Panic with you?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu pursed her lips, took out her phone, and tried to make a call, but the signal was particularly weak, and she couldn't get through. Her composure was starting to break, \"Qu Zhi, you really are a jinx. I shouldn't have taken the same elevator with you!\"\"...\"Qu Zhi also took out his phone and checked the signal, which was indeed very weak. His calls couldn't get through either, \"I already pressed the emergency call button. The people in the control room should have heard it.\"As he finished speaking, the elevator suddenly dropped again, scaring Zheng Baozhu, who screamed, \"Aaaahhhh!\"Even the composed Qu Zhi, a sixteen-year-old boy, felt a bit scared at this moment. He glanced at Zheng Baozhu and walked up to press all the floor buttons, then he helped her up from the floor, \"Lean against the wall, tuck your head down, and bend your knees, standing on your tiptoes.\"While instructing her, he adjusted Zheng Baozhu's posture correctly and then took the same position himself. With tears in her eyes, Zheng Baozhu looked at him and said, \"This position looks so ugly.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Zheng Baozhu was indeed Zheng Baozhu. Even at a time like this, she was still concerned about whether the position looked ugly or not.He gently pushed Zheng Baozhu's head back and pressed it against the wall, saying, \"Don't look at me, tuck the back of your head against the wall. This position protects the spine. Bending your knees is because ligaments are the only tissue rich in elasticity. If the elevator drops, using your knees to absorb the force is better than using your bones.\"After listening to him, Zheng Baozhu's heart pounded even harder, \"So the elevator is really going to fall, right?\"\"...\"Qu Zhi slightly pursed his lips and said, \"Usually, elevators have five to six steel ropes, and there's a holding brake in the traction machine. The cabin also has a speed governor and safety gear. Unless all of these things malfunction, the elevator won't fall.\"Qu Zhi's words brought some relief to Zheng Baozhu's fragile heart. She sniffed and asked Qu Zhi, \"When will the maintenance team come? It's so tiring to stand like this.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"It was indeed a bit exhausting.\"The elevator shouldn't drop again. You can relax a bit. If the elevator drops again...\"\"Shut up!\" Zheng Baozhu interrupted him, \"Please, don't talk about it.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi fell silent.Both of them shifted to a relatively relaxed position, waiting for someone to come and rescue them. Midway through, they managed to make a phone call, briefly informing the person on the other end of their approximate floor location. The time waiting for help felt particularly long. Although the elevator didn't drop again, Zheng Baozhu didn't dare to let her guard down.When they heard voices from outside, Zheng Baozhu was relieved and excited. She pounded the elevator door as if she had seen her loved ones, \"Uncle, we're in here! We're inside!\"After a while, the elevator door was finally pried open, and Zheng Baozhu let out a deep sigh of relief.\"Zheng Baozhu, you go up first, and I'll support you from below,\" Qu Zhi suggested. Zheng Baozhu didn't hesitate and climbed out, but halfway through, she suddenly realized she was wearing a skirt. She turned back to look at Qu Zhi, \"Don't look at me!\"\"...\"Qu Zhi said seriously, \"I'm closing my eyes.\"\"...\"Regardless of whether he was telling the truth, Zheng Baozhu chose to believe him.After Zheng Baozhu was safely out, the rescue team pulled Qu Zhi out as well. The two of them had been trapped in the elevator for over half an hour. At the top floor, Meng Yaxin had already received the news and was waiting outside. Meng Yaxin's mother had rushed over as well; if something happened to the two children inside the elevator, the responsibility would be significant.\"Baozhu, are you okay?\" Meng Yaxin hurried over and looked at Zheng Baozhu worriedly. Zheng Baozhu tearfully hugged her, \"I was so scared. I thought I couldn't get out, wuwuwu...\"\"It's okay, it's okay. You're safe now,\" Meng Yaxin patted Zheng Baozhu's back, comforting her like she was a child.\"I had my hair beautifully curled today, but the curls are all gone now, wuwuwu...\"\"It's alright! You're still the most beautiful!\"\"Really?\"\"Really!\"\"Sob, sob, sob.\" Zheng Baozhu cried a few more times and took out the lipstick she had prepared for Meng Yaxin, \"This is the lipstick I got for you, but it fell on the floor when the elevator malfunctioned. I don't know if it's broken.\"\"It's fine, even if it's broken, I can still use it!\" Meng Yaxin said and didn't forget to inquire about Qu Zhi. He was their grade's top student and had represented the country in competitions. If he got hurt, it would be a big loss!\"Qu Zhi, are you okay too?\"\"I'm okay,\" Qu Zhi glanced at the teary Zheng Baozhu, \"You should take care of Zheng Baozhu.\"\"...Okay,\" This was the top student? Trapped in the elevator for over half an hour, yet he remained unfazed.\"Remember what happened?\" Qu Zhi's voice came through the phone, pulling Zheng Baozhu out of her memories, \"I remember you cried even worse than when you saw the puppy that other day.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"A crooked log cannot make a straight plank1. :)\"Is this related to the post you made on your moments?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"I got trapped in the elevator again.\"There was a brief silence on the other end of the line before Qu Zhi's voice came back, \"Are you okay now? Where are you?\"\"I'm fine, I came out safely, and I'm about to head back to the hotel.\"Qu Zhi slightly furrowed his brows, \"Are you driving yourself?\"\"Yeah.\"\"Then wait a bit, calm down first before driving, and be safe.\"\"Okay...\" The more Zheng Baozhu listened, the more it felt unusual. Was Qu Zhi this concerned? He called before even her mother did.Suddenly feeling a little embarrassed, she raised her hand to touch her nose and changed the subject, \"By the way, why are you so free today? I just posted on my moments, and you saw it?\"\"...I'm outside this afternoon.\"\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu replied, and then another call came in. It was from her mom.\"My mom is calling, let's talk later.\"\"Mhm,\" Before Qu Zhi hung up, he reminded her, \"Drive safely. If not, get a designated driver.\"\"No need to worry that much, I'll hang up first.\" Zheng Baozhu ended the call and answered her mom's call, \"Mom, what's up?\"On the other end of the line, Su Mingxi asked, \"Baozhu, I saw your post on moments. What happened? Did you see a mouse or a spider?\"\"...Mom, it's not that. I just came out to do something, the elevator had a minor malfunction, but I'm fine now.\"\"What? Another elevator malfunction? I remember when you were in high school when you were stuck in an elevator, you were so scared, crying miserably...\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu hurriedly interrupted her, \"Mom, I'm fine now. I'm driving, so I won't talk to you anymore.\"\"Oh, then focus on driving. Are you really not hurt?\"\"I'm really not.\"\"That's good. I'll hang up then.\"After Su Ming hung up the phone, Zheng Baozhu posted a unified response in her moments and then drove away.Upon arriving at the hotel, she received a call from Gao Boyun. Zheng Baozhu opened the hotel room door, answered the call, and walked inside, \"Director Gao, the casting results won't be out so soon, will they?\"\"Of course not,\" Gao Boyun replied, \"I saw your moments about the elevator incident, so I called to check on you.\"\"Oh, I'm fine. Thanks for your concern, Director Gao.\"\"That's good to hear,\" Gao Boyun then changed the topic, \"By the way, let's talk about the role of Ye Ling.\"\"Sure,\" Zheng Baozhu put down her car keys, sat on the sofa, and continued, \"Is this also part of the audition process?\"\"Just casual chat, no need to be so formal,\" Gao Boyun said, \"Some people say that the role of Ye Ling was written by the author just to increase the word count and earn more money. Even if this character is removed, it won't affect the overall plot of the drama. What do you think about this?\"\"I don't agree with that. On the contrary, I believe the author created this character with a purpose and depth,\" Zheng Baozhu analyzed, \"From the male lead's conduct during his memory loss period, we can see that he is inherently a kind and innocent person. He even saved the people in the village with Ye Ling, showing his heroic side. This sets the foundation for his later decision to abandon hatred and choose family and national righteousness, making it a logical and natural choice, as this character represents purity. I also see symbolism in the role of Ye Ling, representing the unblemished part of the male lead's heart that hasn't been consumed by hatred. It's because of this purity that he is able to preserve his humanity and not completely become a tool for revenge. Therefore, I completely disagree with any adaptation that portrays Ye Ling as a villain. Such a change would deviate from the author's original intention.\"Zheng Baozhu then added, \"Of course, this is just my personal understanding, and I'm not saying this to dissuade you from deleting the role.\"Gao Boyun chuckled and said, \"Don't overthink it. We never planned to delete this role. That's settled then. I won't disturb your rest anymore.\"Gao Boyun hung up the phone and looked at Lin Ziqin beside him, \"What do you think? The actor we selected isn't just making up the numbers, right?\"Lin Ziqin nodded slightly and replied, \"Her understanding of the role is profound and her appearance is also outstanding. It's a bit of a pity for her to play such small roles.\"But Gao Boyun saw it differently, \"I think the role is just right. Although it's not a major role, it's an important one. The revised character settings in this adaptation are more in line with the audience's preferences nowadays. Introducing the audience to the story through this role is perfect. With her current acting skills, she can handle the role of Ye Ling perfectly. If we had given her a leading role, her weaknesses might have been exposed.\"Lin Ziqin couldn't help but laugh, \"I can tell that Director Gao really likes this actress.\"Gao Boyun didn't refute and raised an eyebrow slightly, saying to Lin Ziqin, \"You know, big directors like to discover and nurture actors themselves. I discovered Zheng Baozhu in the Film and Television City. I have that kind of eye for talents, just like with Su Ming and my father, who can appreciate each other.\"Lin Ziqin responded, \"Oh, I thought it would be me who you appreciate like that.\"Gao Boyun smiled, \"Teacher Lin is being modest. With your current status in the industry, I should be the one trying to get close to you, not the other way around.\"Zheng Baozhu had no idea that Gao Boyun already considered her as someone he discovered and nurtured. At this point, she was still scrolling through her moments until she came across a photo of someone she wasn't used to seeing on moments \u2013 Qu Zhi.What's going on? Did he finally realize that handsome guys should post selfies?She stopped and looked closely. It turned out this post wasn't made by Qu Zhi himself; it was posted by their elementary school teacher, Teacher Zhang.Zheng Baozhu was briefly stunned. She had Teacher Zhang on her WeChat because they met when Teacher Zhang visited Starlight Farm once and recognized her instantly. Even though so many years had passed, Zheng Baozhu couldn't recognize Teacher Zhang at first glance, but Teacher Zhang easily recognized her.Since then, they became friends on WeChat. Since Teacher Zhang hadn't retired yet, her moments mostly consisted of their former elementary school students' daily lives. And today, a picture of a successful former student from more than a decade ago appeared in her moments.Teacher Zhang: My student from over a decade ago is giving a lecture to the children at the school today. Isn't he handsome?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, he was giving a lecture at the school? Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and gave a thumbs-up to Teacher Zhang's post on moments.She then took a towel and went to the bathroom to take a shower and change into fresh clothes before heading downstairs to have dinner. It was almost dark and the garden lights were already on. Since Christmas was soon approaching, the hotel management decided to decorate the hotel with some Christmas ornaments. So, some people were still working outside to set up the decorations.Zheng Baozhu was pondering about whether to help with the decorations after dinner when Liang Huihui came over, holding several thick books.\"Miss Baozhu, did you send these books for me?\" Liang Huihui placed the books on the table and pointed at them, \"A delivery guy just brought them to me. He left them at the front desk, and I didn't have a chance to ask who sent them.\"Zheng Baozhu flipped through the books on the table; they were the ones Liang Huihui needed for her exams. Opening one of them, she found a message written inside: \"At any point in time, life can start anew.\"Liang Huihui read the message aloud as both of them looked at the line of words. Zheng Baozhu smiled and said, \"It's well written. It's not only suitable for you but also for me.\"Liang Huihui looked up and asked, \"So, Miss Baozhu, did you send me these books?\"\"No,\" Zheng Baozhu shook her head, \"But these are the books you'll need for your exams.\"Liang Huihui became even more puzzled. Who else would be so kind besides Miss Baozhu? \"Ah, I know! Did Mr. Qu send them to me?\"Zheng Baozhu shook her head again, \"This isn't Qu Zhi's handwriting.\"Liang Huihui widened her eyes, seeming somewhat disbelieving, \"Then who could it be?\"\"It's probably Qi Sheng who sent them to you,\" Zheng Baozhu replied.Liang Huihui thought about it and realized there was no one else other than Mr. Qi who would send her these books.\"Alright, no matter who sent them, it's their blessing for you. Study hard and don't let their blessings go to waste,\" Zheng Baozhu advised.\"Yes, I will!\" Liang Huihui nodded firmly, holding the books in her arms. Before leaving, she turned back to Zheng Baozhu, \"Miss Baozhu, can you recognize Mr. Qu's handwriting?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Was this the main point?Looking at Liang Huihui's rejoicing expression, Zheng Baozhu smiled faintly, \"I have been Qu Zhi's deskmate for so many years, it's not surprising that I recognize his handwriting, right?\"\"Not surprising at all! Got it!\" Liang Huihui seemed truly convinced this time and walked away with the books, \"I won't disturb Miss Baozhu's dinner!\"Zheng Baozhu chuckled as she watched her leave, then continued eating her meal. Her phone was placed on the table. After eating a piece of tofu, she lightly swiped her index finger on the screen. The phone unlocked, it was still on the moments. At the top, there was a red number \"1\", indicating that there was a new message.She tapped it and saw that Teacher Zhang had left a comment on the post she had liked.Teacher Zhang: It seems the charm of a handsome guy is irresistible, even exploding in my moments! \u00a0Replying to all the younger sisters and moms, I asked for you, the person is still single! \u00a0However, our Dr. Qu now has only one goal\u2014to serve the country, and he has no time for dating.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Wow, even in someone else's moments, Qu Zhi's character remains intact. Let's keep him focused on serving the country and not let him cause any trouble for those young girls!As she continued to scroll through her friend circle while eating and finishing her meal, Teacher Zhang left two more comments.Teacher Zhang: You guys are too enthusiastic; it seems even the country can't stop you! \u00a0I'm not convenient to give you contact information, but I'm having dinner with him right now. If you want to send photos for him to look at, hurry up and send them, I'll show them to him!Teacher Zhang: Oops, he said it himself\u2014he really isn't looking for a girlfriend or a boyfriend! \u00a0This is the video of our lecture today, you can watch it on the school website. Since you guys are so enthusiastic, why not watch our lecture? [link]Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Teacher Zhang is on fire today.Zheng Baozhu dabbed the corners of her mouth with a tissue and gently tapped on the link.The page redirected to the school website; the video's cover was a picture of Qu Zhi. It could be considered as using Qu Zhi to attract people to watch the lecture.These days, for the sake of education, they were using every means necessary.Zheng Baozhu sighed.Because this lecture was for school students, it wasn't an academic one but a public welfare lecture.The topic was about visually impaired people.Qu Zhi was wearing a well-tailored suit and stood on the lecture hall's platform, greeting everyone. The response from the young audience below was particularly enthusiastic. They not only gave him the loudest applause but also shouted, \"Brother is so handsome!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Shouldn't their teacher control the situation? Qu Zhi is not human; even school students can't escape his charm. :)On the platform, Qu Zhi seemed unperturbed by the situation. After signaling for everyone to be quiet, he began his lecture: \"Do you know how many visually impaired people there are in our country?\"The students answered in unison, \"Don't know\u2014\"Qu Zhi said, \"In our country, there are over ten million visually impaired individuals, making it the country with the highest number of blind people in the world. But have you ever seen them when you're out and about?\"\"No\u2014\"\"Then have you ever wondered why? Is it because they never leave their homes?\" This time, Qu Zhi didn't ask the children for an answer but continued, \"They might indeed stay at home because going out is extremely difficult for them.\"At this point, Qu Zhi clicked on the computer's PPT and the large projection screen behind him displayed the images from his presentation. Considering the audience were all elementary school students, Qu Zhi's PPT was designed to be colorful and appealing, using images that kids would like. Clearly, it wasn't something Qu Zhi made himself.How could he be so considerate?Zheng Baozhu smirked and continued watching the video.\"Speaking of this, let's take a look at how visually impaired people usually get around,\" Qu Zhi pointed to the projected tactile paving on the screen and said to the children, \"This is tactile paving, also known as the lifeline of blind people. You can see these tiles have two types of raised patterns\u2014one is straight lines, the other is dots. The straight lines represent a safe path, while the dots indicate obstacles ahead that require a turn.\"Qu Zhi patiently explained how tactile paving is used and then walked to the center of the stage, \"Today, to let you experience what it's like to be visually impaired, we have specially set up a simple tactile path here. Any kids who want to try it out, please come up!\"This game segment was especially exciting for the children and seeing the attractive teacher on stage made most of them raise their hands eagerly, \"Me, me, me!\"Qu Zhi eventually selected a little boy and a little girl to come up on stage. He had two blindfolds in his hands that would cover the children's eyes later. To prevent any accidents, they laid foam pads on both sides of the tactile path.The two children put on the blindfolds themselves and Qu Zhi handed each of them a simple white cane. He then told them they could start walking.With the white canes in hand, the two children slowly walked on the tactile path, feeling the patterns beneath their feet. When they reached the circular tiles, they attempted to turn around.The children in the audience below were watching with extreme focus, even holding their breaths as if afraid that any noise would disturb the kids on stage.Qu Zhi accompanied the two children throughout the entire process, helping them reach the end successfully. The young audience below applauded warmly when Qu Zhi had the children on stage take off their blindfolds. He then asked the little boy beside him, \"Can you tell everyone about your experience just now?\"This little boy was particularly outgoing and didn't feel nervous standing on such a big stage. He leaned over to Qu Zhi's microphone and began speaking, \"After my eyes were covered, I felt very unsafe, but I could still feel the patterns on the floor tiles. I only dared to continue walking when I stepped on them!\"Qu Zhi nodded and then asked the other child, \"What about you?\"The child replied, \"I feel the same way. The patterns on the floor are very important to me.\"Qu Zhi nodded again and turned to address everyone, \"Through the demonstration of these two students just now, you should realize how important tactile paving is for blind people. Now, let's take a look at what real tactile paving looks like.\"Qu Zhi asked the two children to return to their seats and walked back to the computer to display several pictures he had taken himself. The photos showed tactile paving being obstructed by various objects, \"These are all candid shots I took, and you can see that anything and everything can end up on the tactile paving, besides blind people.\"His words elicited a chuckle from the children in the audience, but after the laughter, they subconsciously started to reflect on the issue.Qu Zhi then showed a few pictures of poorly designed tactile paving, \"Aside from being obstructed, there are also poorly designed cases, like manhole covers directly on the tactile paving or complicated, winding paths that lead blind people straight into walls.\"The little boy who had just been on stage saw the pictures displayed by Qu Zhi and couldn't help standing up and shouting loudly, \"Isn't this just fooling around? What are all these things? If it doesn't work, let me go up there!\"The children below burst into laughter, and a few of his close classmates playfully encouraged him to go up on stage.Qu Zhi once again quieted the audience and told the boy what field of study he should consider for such designs, then he continued with his lecture. After discussing tactile pavements, he moved on to talk about two other important aids for blind people: the white cane and guide dogs.\"Do you all know about guide dogs?\"\"We know!\"Qu Zhi displayed several pictures of guide dogs on the computer. A bold little boy stood up, holding a headband with dog ears, and said, \"Teacher, this one!\"Qu Zhi looked at him, not sure of his intention. The innocent child said, \"Dogs are so cute. Teacher, can you put this on and continue the lecture for us?\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"\"Hahaha!\" Zheng Baozhu, watching from the screen, burst out laughing, \"Well done!\"All the children looked expectantly at Qu Zhi, even the teacher in charge of the order encouraged him, \"Teacher Qu, why not wear it? Kids love this kind of thing, it will make the lecture more interesting and engaging, and they will be more attentive.\"Reluctance was written all over Qu Zhi's face.Zheng Baozhu couldn't stop laughing. This teacher definitely wanted to see Qu Zhi wearing the dog ears too, but... Qu Zhi was afraid of dogs, hahaha!Zheng Baozhu watched Qu Zhi on the screen, feeling a sense of schadenfreude. Who could have imagined that the ones to punish Qu Zhi in the end would be these innocent and adorable kids!Although Qu Zhi's face clearly showed reluctance, to avoid disappointing the children, he finally put the headband with dog ears on his head.Zheng Baozhu quickly took a screenshot, feeling like she had captured an important handle on Qu Zhi.After putting on the headband, Qu Zhi initially felt a bit awkward, but as he continued speaking, he forgot about it. \"Although guide dogs are adorable, when you see them outside, they are working seriously, so we should not disturb them. Understood?\"\"Understood!\"After he finished speaking this, Qu Zhi introduced to the children the advancements in technology that could assist blind people, which was his area of expertise. However, since these things were relatively complex for the children, he only touched on them briefly, with the main aim of sparking their interest in scientific research.\"Alright, our lecture for today concludes here,\" Qu Zhi's PowerPoint reached the last page, where he wrote the conclusion for the day, \"Through today's lecture, when you see your parents parking their cars on tactile pavements in the future, you can correct their behavior. As long as we all start from ourselves, the living environment for blind people will gradually improve.\"Looking at the eager faces of the children below, Qu Zhi continued, \"You are all the future of our country. When you become better, our country becomes better.\"The progress bar of the video reached the end and stopped. The lecture lasted for over an hour, but Zheng Baozhu felt like she had only watched for a short time. With Qu Zhi finally elevating the meaning behind the lecture, it ended on an impressive note.She locked her phone and looked outside. It was already dark outside and the staff setting up the Christmas tree had finished their work. Zheng Baozhu hadn't realized she had been sitting here watching Qu Zhi's lecture for such a long time. The restaurant was now empty...She cleared her throat, picked up her phone, and returned to her room. After she watched Qu Zhi's lecture, her phone's battery was left with only about ten percent, so she plugged it in to charge. She then heard someone knocking on the door.She walked up to take a look, and to her surprise, it was Qu Zhi. With a quick glance, she opened the door for him, \"Dr. Qu, is there something you need?\"Qu Zhi was still wearing the suit he had on in the video, but he had taken off the headband with dog ears. Zheng Baozhu felt a bit regretful about that.Qu Zhi stood outside the door and looked her up and down, showing no sign of entering, \"Nothing, I just came to see you. When you got stuck in the elevator today, were you not scared to tears?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu snorted disdainfully, \"Do you still think I'm the same as I was years ago? Today, my performance was the best in the entire group!\"Qu Zhi lightly chuckled, seeing that there didn't seem to be any particular matter to discuss, he said, \"Then, I'll go back now.\"Zheng Baozhu glanced at him, \"Is that all you came to say?\"\"En,\" Qu Zhi also glanced at her, \"Did you have something you wanted to tell me?\"Zheng Baozhu pursed her lips, and reached up to adjust her hair, \"I saw you on Teacher Zhang's moments today. Not bad, huh? One photo causing a sensation. No wonder they say that handsome guys posting selfies is an act of charity.\"Qu Zhi thought for a moment and subconsciously asked, \"Is there such a saying?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"So, in the future, you can consider posting more selfies. It's like accumulating virtue for yourself.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi looked at her silently, nodded, and replied, \"I see.\"After saying that, he returned to his room. Zheng Baozhu closed the door, opened her computer, and prepared to continue watching Gao Boyun's online drama. Since her phone was charging, she logged in to the web version of WeChat as well. After finishing one episode of the TV drama, she absentmindedly checked her friends' moments and found that Qu Zhi had actually posted a selfie!Zheng Baozhu sighed and enlarged the photo to take a closer look. Qu Zhi's selfie was taken casually, without deliberately posing, but because he had good looks, he looked handsome even in casual shots. She gave him a like and waited to see her friends' circle explode.She had some friends in common with Qu Zhi, but after waiting for ten minutes, Qu Zhi's selfie only had one like\u2014hers! This was not scientifically possible!Even Su Mingxi, who was usually active in Qu Zhi's friend circle, seemed to have missed this post!...Did everyone suddenly go blind??Zheng Baozhu couldn't understand, so she waited for another ten minutes, but there was still only one like. Finally, she couldn't resist asking Qu Zhi about it.Zheng Baozhu: Why is there only one like on your moments post??Qu Zhi quickly replied: Because it's only visible to you.Zheng Baozhu's heart skipped a beat, inexplicably beating fast. She looked at Qu Zhi's reply and touched her own cheek with the back of her hand.Zheng Baozhu: What do you mean?Qu Zhi: This is targeted poverty alleviation.Zheng Baozhu: ............Poverty alleviation my foot!Zheng Baozhu gritted her teeth, and with a series of messages, she retorted, \"How can I be considered from a poor household? My friend circle is full of handsome guys, okay!\"Qu Zhi: Oh? Let me see.Zheng Baozhu quickly took screenshots and sent them all to Qu Zhi: Hehe!One minute later.Qu Zhi: Finished looking. I'm still the most handsome.Zheng Baozhu: ...Before she could even start to mock him, Qu Zhi sent another message: Why did you add so many guys?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQu Zhi's question left Zheng Baozhu stunned. Why did you add so many guys?...What business of his was it anyway!Zheng Baozhu: It's not that I added so many guys, it's just that there are always guys who want to add me. Sigh, you wouldn't understand my troubles.Qu Zhi: ...Acting ostentatious, huh?1Zheng Baozhu: But recently, I've met some nice little brothers in the Film and Television City. They're handsome and fun. When I become famous in the future, I'll probably get to know even more handsome guys in the entertainment industry.Qu Zhi: Is that your reason for wanting to get into the entertainment industry?Zheng Baozhu: Who doesn't like handsome guys?\"...\"Qu Zhi tossed his phone aside, too lazy to bother with her, and went to take a shower.In the bathroom, the mirror was covered with a layer of mist due to the steam. Qu Zhi stood under the showerhead, tilting his head back to flick his short hair behind. He raised his hand to clear the mist on the mirror.His naked upper body appeared in the mirror. The well-defined abs and waist, a result of his regular exercise, were clearly visible in the reflection.Qu Zhi had always been a disciplined person, even if he was busy with work, he would still pay attention to self-management. Cool water droplets rolled down his neck, and he stared at his reflection in the mirror, contemplating if he should take a photo...Wait, what was he thinking???Qu Zhi was speechless for a moment. He turned the shower to the highest setting and rinsed himself as if trying to wash away the ridiculous idea from his mind.The next day, Qu Zhi went to the company early in the morning. He even avoided having breakfast in the restaurant, fearing he might run into Zheng Baozhu.He didn't know why he felt guilty.Zheng Baozhu had no idea what Qu Zhi had experienced last night. Today, she didn't need to go to the Film and Television City, so she stayed at the hotel to help decorate the Christmas tree. The hotel had purchased a large Christmas tree, but the decorations and the tree were separate, so they had to put them up themselves.Just having a Christmas tree wasn't enough; they also needed to arrange other small items. Zheng Baozhu had always enjoyed doing these kinds of activities since she was a child. Dressing up something plain and making it look beautiful gave her a sense of achievement.During the break, she took a cup of milk and sat on the sofa, drinking while playing with her phone.Yesterday's update from Teacher Zhang continued.Teacher Zhang: Dr. Qu's lecture video has received many views. Thank you all for your support.\u00a0Little Qu really isn't looking for girlfriends, please don't ask me again. \u00a0Although you can't get him in person, I can show you his handwriting. [Image]Zheng Baozhu clicked on the image to take a look. It was a few lines of penmanship; the handwriting was not like Qu Zhi's now, showing that it was written when he was younger.Zheng Baozhu remembered when she was in elementary school, the teacher organized them to participate in the fountain pen handwriting level exam. The whole class participated. When the results were reported, Qu Zhi's handwriting was rated highly.When Zheng Baozhu was young, her handwriting wasn't good, so naturally, she didn't make the cut. But after entering junior high school, she suddenly realized that if she were to become famous in the future, she would need to sign autographs! If her handwriting was too ugly, wouldn't that be embarrassing?Since then, Zheng Baozhu became conscious about practicing her handwriting. As she was busy with dance classes at school, she didn't enroll in a calligraphy class, so she bought some copybooks and practiced at home. Her handwriting had indeed improved significantly compared to her elementary school days.Her eyes fell on the photo Teacher Zhang posted. It was a piece of calligraphy written by Qu Zhi after his fountain pen handwriting was rated highly. Teacher Zhang specifically had him write it and displayed it in the classroom for everyone to see.She hadn't expected it to still be there.Of course, not only Qu Zhi's handwriting was rated highly in the class; several classmates also wrote a piece of calligraphy and displayed them on the blackboard. Most of them copied a few lines from the poems in the textbook, but Qu Zhi was different. Although he also copied from an article, Zheng Baozhu couldn't understand it at that time.\"For the heart of heaven and earth, for the mission of the people, for continuing the legacy of the saints, for bringing eternal peace to the world,\" Zheng Baozhu read aloud what Qu Zhi wrote. This passage came from Zhang Zai's [Record of the School of Principles]. Qu Zhi, a third-grade elementary school student at the time, already had such a high level of consciousness?Tsk tsk.Zheng Baozhu sighed and gave Teacher Zhang's post a like.Unexpectedly, Teacher Zhang sent her a private WeChat message.Teacher Zhang: Baozhu, I heard from Little Qu that you two are living together now, huh?\"Poof\u2014\" Zheng Baozhu almost spewed out the milk in her mouth.Zheng Baozhu: Maybe he didn't explain it clearly. He is staying at my hotel.Teacher Zhang: That's what I meant. My bad.\u00a0You two have been together since you were little, and now you're still together. That's nice.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Maybe in the eyes of others, it really is nice...Teacher Zhang: I remember Little Qu was not close to others when he was little, he only played with you. Even when you skipped a grade, he followed along.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"No, Teacher Zhang, you misunderstood. And could you please stop mentioning that heart-aching incident?Teacher Zhang: You two are living together now, spending more time together. You're both outstanding kids; who knows, sparks might fly.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Aren't you supposed to be teaching?After being caught up in a chat with Teacher Zhang for a while, Zheng Baozhu went back to her busy task of decorating.When Qi Sheng came to have lunch, he saw Zheng Baozhu busy with decorating and couldn't help but call out, \"Miss Baozhu, it's lunchtime.\"Zheng Baozhu was holding a Christmas decoration and turned to look at him, \"I'll finish this first, you go ahead and eat.\"Seeing that Qi Sheng came alone, she asked subconsciously, \"Isn't Qu Zhi coming out for lunch?\"Qi Sheng replied, \"He did a lecture yesterday afternoon and said he needs to catch up on some work today.\"\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu nodded thoughtfully, hanging up the Christmas decoration, \"He went to our elementary school to give a lecture yesterday. I saw it in our teacher's WeChat moments. It caused quite a stir. Everyone wanted a blind date with him.\"Qi Sheng hadn't heard this gossip yet, so he became interested, \"Really? Did anyone approach him?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"Qu Zhi said he only has his country in his heart and doesn't want to date.\"\"Pfft!\" Qi Sheng was exasperated, \"If he doesn't want to date, then why didn't he let me go to the lecture!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Qi Sheng walked to the restaurant, still contemplating how to talk to Qu Zhi so that next time he would let him have such opportunities.Liang Huihui came over to deliver the meal to him and hesitated for a moment before calling him, \"Mr. Qi Sheng.\"Qi Sheng looked up and smiled at her, \"What's up?\"Liang Huihui tugged at her work uniform nervously and asked, \"Those books used for exams, are you the one who sent them to me?\"Qi Sheng nodded, \"Yes, what's the matter?\"\"N-nothing! I just wanted to say thank you!\" Liang Huihui said and quickly ran off. Qi Sheng watched her leave and picked up his chopsticks with a smile, \"This little sister is really polite, coming all the way to say thank you for a few books.\"After finishing his meal, he took the food he bought for Qu Zhi and returned to the company. He felt like he was Qu Zhi's exclusive delivery person now.After the lunch rush, the restaurant gradually quieted down. Liang Huihui gathered some snacks and took them to Xiao Yu to satisfy her cravings. Just as she was returning from the elevator, she saw the delivery robot coming out by itself, asking people to make some room as it wheeled on its way back to the front desk.Liang Huihui curiously approached and patted the robot's head, \"This little guy even reminds people to make way for it?\"\"Yeah, it's so smart,\" Xiao Yu said with a mysterious expression, \"Hey, Huihui, didn't you dislike these delivery robots? Why are you interested now?\"\"I didn't,\" Liang Huihui denied, \"I just think this little thing is not as annoying as it used to be. You know there have been news reports about bad people pretending to be delivery drivers, sneaking into hotels, stealing, and even harming guests, right? Now with these delivery robots bringing food up to the rooms, it's safer for guests, and it also saves time for the delivery drivers, right? It's a win-win!\"\"Oh...\" Xiao Yu responded with a meaningful tone.After work, Liang Huihui changed out of her work uniform and returned to her dormitory. The restaurant department had reorganized the shifts, and now she had more time to rest, which Liang Huihui used to study for her exams.Looking at the books Qi Sheng had given her, she cut out the phrase [At any point in time, life can start anew] written on the title page and put it into a photo frame, placing it on her desk.When Qu Zhi returned from work, he found that the hotel looked completely different from when he left in the morning. In the morning, there were only some Christmas decorations in the garden, but now a large Christmas tree had been set up in the hotel lobby, accompanied by several reindeer figurines.\"Hey, Qu Zhi, you came at the right time,\" Zheng Baozhu stood on a small ladder and turned to him, \"Come over and see if it's crooked.\"Zheng Baozhu was decorating the glass and the ladder was placed by the window. She was standing on it without anyone assisting her.Qu Zhi frowned when he saw this, quickly walked up the ladder, and asked, \"What are you trying to do again, Zheng Baozhu? Are you trying to fall from the ladder?\"\"Hmph, do you think I'm that foolish in your eyes?\" Zheng Baozhu sneered, \"Just help me see if it's crooked.\"\"It's not,\" Qu Zhi stood by her side, still with a furrowed brow, \"You, as the boss, have to do this kind of work by yourself?\"\"Other people have their own jobs to do, while I'm just idle,\" after Zheng Baozhu heard him say that it wasn't crooked, she hung the ornament, \"Alright, it's done.\"Qu Zhi saw that she was about to come down the ladder and reached out to assist her. Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment but eventually accepted his help.Once she was stable, she took a few steps back to admire her creation, nodding with satisfaction, \"Not bad, it looks really good.\"Just as she was feeling proud, she suddenly felt a sharp pain in her abdomen. Her face changed, and she squatted down, holding her stomach.Qu Zhi quickly approached, crouching beside her, \"What happened? Did you bump into something?\"\"No,\" Zheng Baozhu shook her head lightly, \"My stomach hurts a little.\"\"Stomachache?\" Qu Zhi furrowed his brow, trying to remember something, and then asked, \"Is it your period?\"\"...\"There was no need to ask so specifically.Seeing Zheng Baozhu not speaking, Qu Zhi guessed it was probably right, \"What's so embarrassing about it? I even went to the restroom to deliver sanitary pads...\"\"Alright, stop talking. Thank you,\" Zheng Baozhu interrupted him with a smile.Qu Zhi chuckled lightly, helping her up from the ground, \"Your periods are quite unpredictable.\"Zheng Baozhu said irritably, \"I used to have very regular periods, but ever since you came back these past two months, my menstrual cycle has become irregular! Do you think you're the one causing it?\"\"...You are blaming that on me? Ha,\" Qu Zhi sarcastically retorted, assisting her as they walked towards the elevator, \"But you do seem to have irregular cycles. Do you need to go to the hospital for a check-up?\"\"No need, thanks,\" Zheng Baozhu sighed, staring at the ceiling in exasperation. Why, oh why, was she discussing menstrual topics here with Qu Zhi?Life truly is absurd.Qu Zhi supported Zheng Baozhu all the way back to her room. She asked him to get her a cup of hot water and took out some pain relievers from the drawer, swallowing one.Qu Zhi watched her closely, \"Feeling better?\"Zheng Baozhu pulled a wry smile, \"It doesn't work that fast. It's not some miraculous pill, you know?\"\"...\"Qu Zhi frowned slightly, then closed his eyes and suddenly reached out to embrace her, holding her gently.Zheng Baozhu stiffened all over!What just happened? She was leaning perfectly fine on the sofa, and now, in the blink of an eye, she was in Qu Zhi's embrace??What's going on??Her heart raced as she momentarily forgot to struggle out of his arms.Qu Zhi simply held her, not making any further moves. The clock in the room ticked away, but it couldn't hide the rapid heartbeats between them.\"You... \"\"Hugging can trigger the brain to release endorphins and oxytocin, which can have a pain-relieving effect.\"Both of them spoke at the same time.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Oh. :)\"Thank you, I'm not in pain anymore,\" Zheng Baozhu straightened up and smiled at Qu Zhi, \"You can go now.\"Qu Zhi carefully assessed her, \"Are you really okay?\"\"It's nothing, I'll just lie down on the bed for a while, and I'll remember to drink more hot water,\" Zheng Baozhu maintained her smile.\"...\"Qu Zhi stood up from the sofa, \"Drinking more hot water does indeed help.\"\"Yes, well then, goodbye!\"\"...Goodbye,\" Qu Zhi opened the door and walked out.The next day, Zheng Baozhu slept until past 10 AM. When she went downstairs, she saw Qu Zhi sitting in the reading corner with a tablet in front of him. Curiously, she walked up to him, \"Hey, not going to work today?\"Qu Zhi turned to look at her, \"Today is the weekend.\"\"...Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu tried to regain her composure, \"So you guys also have weekends off?\"\"Yes...\" Qu Zhi nodded.She glanced at his tablet, \"What are you looking at?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"Interior design plans.\"After completing the procedures for his penthouse, Qu Zhi contacted an interior design company to start the renovation. The designer had already visited his place for measurements and they had made several revisions to the design drafts. Now, they were waiting for his final confirmation to begin the actual renovation.\"Wow, you're already starting the renovation for your penthouse?\" Zheng Baozhu became even more curious upon learning that he was going to renovate his penthouse.Qu Zhi nodded and added, \"The designer sent me these renderings a few days ago, but I've been too busy recently, so I haven't had time to look at them.\"\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu casually replied and was about to leave when Qu Zhi stopped her.\"Wait a moment,\" Qu Zhi called out.She turned to look at him, \"What is it?\"Is he trying to boast about his renovated penthouse now? Hmph.Qu Zhi asked, \"Are you feeling better today?\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback for a moment, then smiled slightly, \"I'm much better, why do you ask?\"Qu Zhi seemed to deliberately avoid her gaze, coughed softly, and said, \"Then could you take a look at this renovation for me?\"Ha! Just as I thought, he wants to show off the renovation!Zheng Baozhu crossed her arms and looked at him, \"Why should I help you look at it?\"Qu Zhi said, \"Aren't you the most knowledgeable about these things? So I wanted to hear your opinion.\"Zheng Baozhu thought to herself, Zheng Baozhu, don't be fooled, and honestly walked over, \"Hmph, you got that right. I had a lot of input in the design of my restaurant and hotel. The world of interior design is deep, and if you're not careful, you'll get taken advantage of.\"\"Hmm...\" Qu Zhi slightly pursed his lips, moved the tablet to her side, and asked, \"What do you think of this style?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQu Zhi showed Zheng Baozhu the monotonous renovation renderings, which were primarily in black, white, and gray, giving off a cool and subdued atmosphere. However, Qu Zhi liked green plants, so the designer added some greenery in the renderings to prevent the entire room from feeling too dull.The main attraction of the spacious ground floor was the unobstructed large living room, and of course, the super-sized balcony. Zheng Baozhu had been obsessed with that balcony where one could lie down and roll around freely. It was evident from the renderings that the designer had given special attention to the balcony, creating a mini \"plant garden\" for Qu Zhi to nurture his green plants.Within the embrace of the greenery, the designer placed a rattan hanging chair, a small coffee table, and two chairs, creating a comfortable space for reading and tea drinking.The study, master bedroom, and guest bedroom were all arranged on the first floor. On the second floor, they had designed a gym, which had a glass room next to it for resting and enjoying the view after a workout.\"It looks pretty good overall,\" Zheng Baozhu gently traced her fingertips on the tablet, feeling curious, \"But I didn't expect you to have your own gym. Do you even work out?\"Qu Zhi looked at her and replied, \"Is it strange? I've always been committed to exercising, but I didn't have much time to go to the gym, so I set up one at home.\"Zheng Baozhu seemed doubtful and looked him up and down. \"You've always been committed to exercising?\"Looking at her expression, Qu Zhi's face darkened. \"Is it strange? I have a good physique.\"\"Hahaha, really?\"\"...\"Qu Zhi stared at her, \"Should I demonstrate for you?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu was afraid he might be serious, so she quickly shook her head, \"No need, no need. The gym looks great.\"Qu Zhi's expression eased, and he asked again, \"Then do you think there's anything else that needs to be changed?\"Looking at the renderings, Zheng Baozhu commented, \"If you ask me, I think the room looks too monotonous. This minimalist style doesn't necessarily have to be entirely black, white, and gray. You could add some gold accents; gold can also have a modern feel.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"After a moment of silence, he cautiously asked, \"Are you suggesting painting the walls gold?\"\"It's not a bad idea, of course, you don't have to cover an entire wall. You can coordinate it with other colors to create a visual impact. Or you could choose some gold decorative pieces, like for these large cabinets, they don't have to be all white. You can select a few to be in a different color, making the room feel more vibrant.\"Qu Zhi thought for a moment and nodded, \"That's worth considering. I'll talk to the designer about it. Is there anything else?\"\"Everything else looks fine, your mini garden is also beautiful,\" Zheng Baozhu said, glancing at Qu Zhi, \"But you're so busy with work, do you have time to take care of it?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"Taking care of the garden is a way for me to relax.\"\"Oh... Well, that's good then,\" Zheng Baozhu finished speaking and stood up from the sofa, \"I'm going to have a meal.\"As Zheng Baozhu walked away, Qu Zhi opened WeChat and sent the modification suggestions to the designer.Because she had an appointment with a certain Teacher Ge on Tuesday, Zheng Baozhu hadn't dared to pick up any calls these past few days, fearing it might cause delays. Since there wasn't much to do at the hotel, she went to the farm with Meng Yaxin to see the crops.Meng Yaxin said she would come every week to water and fertilize the vegetables, and she kept her word. The crops were growing well, so Zheng Baozhu and Meng Yaxin picked some celery and Chinese cabbage, planning to stir-fry them later in the evening. After picking the vegetables, they also went to the orchard to gather oranges and strawberries, making a substantial harvest.\"You have a kitchen in your room, right? I'll cook myself later and let you taste my cooking,\" Meng Yaxin rolled up her sleeves, eager to try. Zheng Baozhu didn't stop her but reminded her, \"Just don't blow up the kitchen, okay?\"\"How could that happen! You'll soon regret what you just said!\" Meng Yaxin teased.Zheng Baozhu laughed and washed the strawberries while Meng Yaxin washed the vegetables. She suddenly asked, \"Should we invite Qu Zhi to join us for dinner?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"Come on, with the small amount of food you're making, it might not even be enough for the two of us.\"Meng Yaxin: \"...\"She couldn't argue with that, \"Well, let's not invite him then. But we have plenty of fruits; you can give him some.\"Zheng Baozhu turned off the tap and shook her head, \"Meng Yaxin, are you secretly scheming against Qu Zhi?\"Meng Yaxin grinned and glanced at her, \"Of course not. I'm just giving you two a chance. Plus, I mainly want to see Cen Tongtong eat all the keyboards from her house.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Is this how best friends are nowadays?She took a bowl filled with fruits and sent some strawberries and oranges to Qu Zhi. It had been a long time since Qu Zhi started living in her hotel, but she hadn't visited his place yet.Holding the bowl of fruits, Zheng Baozhu walked to Qu Zhi's room door, raised her hand, and knocked.\"Who is it?\"Qu Zhi's voice came from inside the room. Zheng Baozhu cleared her throat and replied, \"It's me, Zheng Baozhu.\"The door \"clicked\" open, and Qu Zhi, wearing navy blue sleepwear, stood there, looking at her.It was the first time Zheng Baozhu had seen him in sleepwear, and she couldn't help but stare. She didn't expect Qu Zhi to be so stylish even in his sleepwear; unexpectedly, it had a deep V-neck design?Her eyes couldn't help but focus on the part of his skin that was exposed, his slender neck, the collarbone, and more...Zheng Baozhu quickly shifted her gaze away.Qu Zhi looked at the fruits she was holding as if he did not notice her gaze and asked, \"Did you come to give me the fruits?\"\"Ah, yes,\" Zheng Baozhu pretended to be casual and handed the fruits to Qu Zhi, \"Meng Yaxin and I went to the orchard to pick these up in the afternoon, so I thought of giving you some.\"\"Thank you.\" Qu Zhi thanked her and looked down slightly, saying, \"By the way, the designer has already made the changes to the previous renovation design. Do you want to take a look?\"\"Huh?\" Zheng Baozhu subconsciously glanced at the room behind him and firmly shook her head, \"No, no need. I have to go back and watch over Meng Yaxin's cooking. I don't want the kitchen to blow up.\"Qu Zhi paused for a moment and nodded, \"Alright.\"Zheng Baozhu wasn't sure what he meant by \"alright\", but she didn't ask further and returned to her room empty-handed. In the kitchen, Meng Yaxin, who was busy cooking, saw her return so quickly and couldn't help but ask, \"So fast? Is Qu Zhi not interested?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She thought it might be time to find a new friend.Ignoring Meng Yaxin, Zheng Baozhu sat on the sofa and ate a strawberry. Her phone, placed on the table, lit up, and she picked it up to see a message from Gao Boyun.Gao Boyun: Congratulations, Zheng Baozhu. You passed the audition.Zheng Baozhu was taken aback, and in her excitement, she accidentally pushed the remaining half of the strawberry into her mouth. She quickly replied, \"Are you sure it's me, Ye Ling?!\"Gao Boyun: Yes, it's you. Since you don't have an agent, I'll directly send the contract to you later.Zheng Baozhu: !!! Thank you for your appreciation, Director Gao!Gao Boyun: It's an exaggeration. Your start date for the filming is temporarily set for after the New Year. Due to venue issues, your scenes will be filmed last.Zheng Baozhu: Okay, no problem!After replying to Gao Boyun, Zheng Baozhu jumped up from the sofa. \"Ah, ah, ah, Meng Yaxin, I'm going to be popular! I'm going to be popular!\"Meng Yaxin was busy cooking inside and didn't hear clearly what she was saying, \"What? Am I turning up the heat too much?\"\"Tsk!\" Zheng Baozhu put on her slippers and rushed into the kitchen, leaning close to Meng Yaxin's ear, \"I passed the audition for a\u00a0drama! I'm going to be popular!!\"Now Meng Yaxin heard clearly, she turned off the gas stove with excitement and looked at Zheng Baozhu with enthusiasm, \"What, what? You auditioned for a drama? Which drama?\"\"Yes, 'New Moon Wuxin Sword'!\" Zheng Baozhu replied.\"Oh my god!\" Meng Yaxin covered her mouth in astonishment, \"Is it the same 'New Moon Wuxin Sword' that I know?\"\"Yes, it's the 'New Moon Wuxin Sword' you know!\"\"Ah ah ah Baozhu, you've made it! Quickly tell me which role you're playing!\"\"Ye Ling!\"\"...\"Meng Yaxin fell silent for a moment and calmed down, \"Is it that Ye Ling with only three episodes?\"\"Yes!\"\"...\"Meng Yaxin turned on the gas stove again, \"Don't distract me from cooking.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Ah, people like you know nothing about the entertainment industry!\"From an extra to a supporting role, it's a qualitative leap!\"\"Oh.\"\"...The male lead is Lin Ziqin! It should be announced in the next two days!\"\"!\" Meng Yaxin turned off the gas stove again, \"Baozhu, you've really made it!\"Although Ye Ling's role only has three episodes, all of her scenes are with the male lead!\"The two dishes you made today aren't enough. I'll order some barbecue!\"\"Okay!\" Meng Yaxin nodded, \"And order a few bottles of beer! Let's drink!\"Zheng Baozhu thought back to the scene how Qu Zhi got to know about her joining the entertainment industry because Meng Yaxin got drunk, she shook her head, \"No need for alcohol. I don't trust your drinking capacity.\"Meng Yaxin: \"...\"That's fine. It's better not to drink too much and end up having to send another package.After ordering the barbecue, Zheng Baozhu sent a big red envelope to Wang Jingyi. As soon as Wang Jingyi received the red envelope, she sent a message, \"Ah ah ah, were you selected?\"Zheng Baozhu: Yes! The director just informed me. I'll join the crew after the New Year!Wang Jingyi: Congratulations, sister!! Sob sob sob, I need to work hard too. I must pass the audition for the supporting role this time!Zheng Baozhu sent another red envelope with \"You'll definitely pass the audition for the supporting role!\" written on it.Wang Jingyi: Thank you, sister! If I pass, I'll send you a red envelope too!Zheng Baozhu: [OK]With the role secured, Zheng Baozhu's heart finally settled. Now she just had to meet with this Teacher Ge.If it weren't for Gao Tianming giving her this address, she would have thought that it could be another scam. But Gao Tianming was such a prominent director and he had a connection with her aunt. No matter what, he wouldn't deceive a junior, right?Since Gao Tianming only asked her to find this Teacher Ge on Tuesday without specifying the time, Zheng Baozhu estimated around nine o'clock and arrived at the given address.Being a native of City A, she recognized this place as the old city area. Although she hadn't been here for a long time, it still matched her impression.The houses on this street were mostly old-style red-brick buildings, not very tall, and some were not even multi-story. Since the houses lacked balconies, residents living on the upper floors would directly hang a pole outside the window to dry their laundry. Those on the ground floor would place a stove right outside their entrance for cooking.Zheng Baozhu wasn't too late, but there were already elderly ladies sitting in front of their houses with several baskets, selecting vegetables. It seemed they were accustomed to seeing someone dressed like Zheng Baozhu appearing here, and everyone glanced at her with varying degrees of curiosity.The street was not very wide, with occasional cyclists passing by, and cars honking as they drove past Zheng Baozhu. She parked her car outside the alley because she was worried it might not be easy to drive in, and she walked inside.Holding the note that Gao Tianming had written, she stood in front of the designated door number.\"Is this the place?\" Zheng Baozhu stood at the door and glanced inside. The house had a courtyard and through it was a two-story building.After observing for a while outside, not seeing the owner, Zheng Baozhu raised her hand and knocked on the door twice, \"Hello, is anyone there?\"No one answered from inside. However, on the opposite side of the street, a lady who was hanging clothes to dry heard the question and shouted from the window, \"Mr. Ge just went out to buy something. I saw him leave just now.\"Upon hearing this, Zheng Baozhu turned back and replied, \"I see, thank you, Auntie.\"\"You're welcome, you're welcome.\" The lady continued hanging clothes while sizing Zheng Baozhu up, \"So, you're here to find Mr. Ge? I knew someone so attractive would show up. Are you also a student from the film academy?\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and shook her head, \"No, I'm not. Someone else introduced me here.\"\"Oh... Then you must be someone from television,\" The lady said, \"Just stand here and wait. Mr. Ge won't be long; he'll be back soon.\"\"Alright, thank you, Auntie,\" Zheng Baozhu stood at the door and waited for about two minutes until an elderly man in a black cotton jacket walked towards her.His hair was already gray, indicating that he was much older, but he seemed spirited. He walked steadily and quickly. In his hand, he carried a plastic bag, one couldn't tell if it contained soy sauce or vinegar. She wasn't sure if he was the person she was looking for, so she asked, \"Hello, are you Teacher Ge?\"The old man stopped, looked inside the note, and smiled kindly, \"You must be Zheng Baozhu, right? You really resemble Su Ming. I saw you from afar just now.\"With his confirmation, Zheng Baozhu knew she hadn't found the wrong person. At that moment, her thoughts about this Teacher Ge became quite clear - film academy, Teacher Ge, it was hard not to associate him with the renowned Teacher Ge Hongyi.Ge Hongyi was originally a professor of acting, and while he might not be widely known, the students he taught were all prominent figures in the entertainment industry. For example, the recent three-time Best Actor, Feng Jing. He was also a disciple of Teacher Ge.During the time Zheng Baozhu's aunt, Su Ming, attended the film academy, her acting teacher was also Teacher Ge Hongyi.Though she had such a conjecture in her mind, Zheng Baozhu still felt a bit unreal. How could such a famous mentor be introduced to her by Director Gao Tianming?!Moreover, looking at Teacher Ge's current appearance, he seemed to have retired. Was he going to take her as his last disciple?Even though Gao Tianming was an internationally renowned director, Zheng Baozhu still felt he might not be able to convince Teacher Ge to guide and teach her.She hesitated for a moment, feeling both tense and unsure. Teacher Ge beckoned her to come in and said kindly, \"Come on in, don't just stand there.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu followed him inside. She had noticed a vegetable garden in the courtyard earlier. Although it wasn't large, it was enough for the elderly to pass the time. In terms of food, the vegetables grown in this small piece of land would be more than enough for one person.Next to the vegetable garden, there was a small pavilion with tables and chairs, probably used for resting. Considering the cold weather, there was an old-fashioned charcoal brazier placed beside the chairs. The item looked quite dated to Zheng Baozhu, who had recently seen charcoal braziers mainly used for barbecues. In the past, her grandmother would use this kind of brazier for heating.\"I'll go put the things away; please have a seat,\" Teacher Ge led Zheng Baozhu into the house. The living room was relatively modern, with central heating, making it suitable for elderly living. Zheng Baozhu sat down on the sofa and was drawn to a photo wall in the living room.These photos were of varying ages, some were already yellowed black-and-white pictures, while others were still colorful. Regardless of their age, every person in the photos was a well-known figure in the entertainment industry.Wow, this is the world of the strong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The wall had chipped paint, but the photos were all protected with a layer of plastic. Apart from the autographed individual photos of well-known figures in the industry, there were also pictures where Teacher Ge was photographed with others. Most likely, all of them were his students or people he had guided.In one old photo, Zheng Baozhu saw Su Ming.In the picture, Su Ming looked to be around seventeen or eighteen years old, much younger than Zheng Baozhu remembered her. She was wearing a light-colored dress, leaning against the shade of a tree. At that time, she was already very beautiful, and with just a slight smile, she was captivating.\"Looking at your aunt?\" Ge Hongyi had behind her without Zheng Baozhu realizing it. Zheng Baozhu turned to look at him, then hesitated before asking, \"Do you already know that she was my aunt?\"Ge Hongyi nodded, \"Tianming introduced you to me and told me about your situation. He hopes that I can mentor you, but I haven't agreed directly. I said I'll have you come over first so I can assess the situation.\"Zheng Baozhu suddenly understood. It seemed that Director Gao Tianming also couldn't easily persuade Teacher Ge. It looks like she had to go through an audition first.\"Tianming is also a student from the film academy. He majored in directing and is a few years older than Su Ming,\" Ge Hongyi continued, seeming somewhat nostalgic, \"Fate is truly a wondrous thing. Back then, Tianming found Su Ming, now Boyun has found you.\"As Ge Hongyi spoke, he took out an album from a drawer, \"I still have a few photos of Su Ming here. Do you want to take a look?\"\"Sure,\" Zheng Baozhu was very interested in her aunt's past. Her family had kept all the things related to Su Ming, but no one had ever told her about her aunt's past.\"At that time, the performance class had fewer people. Su Ming was the most beautiful among the students I had taught,\" Ge Hongyi flipped to a group photo and smiled as he pointed it out to Zheng Baozhu, \"This is a class photo from back then. Time flies.\"In the photo, the class had much fewer students compared to now. Zheng Baozhu immediately spotted Su Ming. Her hair wasn't as long at the time, but she had trendy curly hair. Standing beside her was a tall and handsome young man with thick eyebrows and big eyes, the epitome of a heartthrob from that era.Zheng Baozhu exclaimed, \"Oh my God, is this Zhang Wensheng?\"Zhang Wensheng was a contemporary superstar alongside Su Ming. He had acted in many famous films and won several Best Actor awards. Although he had now faded out of the entertainment industry at almost fifty years old, any event he attended could easily become newsworthy, with even just a few words exchanged with him by his juniors being enough to warrant media coverage and praise.When Zheng Baozhu was in school, she was a die-hard fan of Zhang Wensheng. He was not only handsome but also an outstanding actor. His gentle and elegant temperament, along with his deep and mesmerizing eyes, captivated countless fans.He turned out to be her aunt's classmate?!No one had ever told her!!Ge Hongyi glanced at the photo and nodded with a smile, \"Yes, he and Su Ming were the two students who had the best development in that class. They even dated for a while.\"\"????\" Zheng Baozhu's pupils contracted, \"What? My aunt dated Zhang Wensheng?\"Ge Hongyi remained calm and nodded, adding, \"But they broke up later because they couldn't meet each other for a long time. Afterward, Su Ming met a rock singer, who was entirely different from Zhang Wensheng.\"\"What? Wait a minute,\" Zheng Baozhu looked at Ge Hongyi, \"You mean the rock singer is Ray, the lead singer of Pumpkin?\"Ge Hongyi thought for a moment and somewhat uncertainly nodded, \"It seems to be that name. I'm not very familiar with those rock singers.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Pumpkin was definitely a representative rock band of that era, and the band's lead singer, Ray, had a significant influence on a generation. Whether it was his magnetic singing style or his visual appearance, he fascinated countless fans. Even later, Gu Xin's initial style was clearly imitating him.If there had been the term \"national husband\" for male stars at that time, Ray's looks would have been a perfect fit.\"My aunt also knew him?\"Ge Hongyi replied, \"Not only knew him but also dated him.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"..........\"Oh my god, what kind of person was my aunt? Were all ancient male gods her ex-boyfriends?Winner in life. :)Zheng Baozhu was envious.\"Alright, let's stop talking about your aunt. Let's talk about your situation,\" Ge Hongyi closed the album and looked at Zheng Baozhu across from him, \"I heard you've been working as an extra in the Film and Television City?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, trying to calm her emotions, \"Since I haven't received formal acting training, I thought of starting from being on set as an extra. Maybe I can pave my way in the industry that way.\"Ge Hongyi smiled and said, \"It's a method indeed. Back in the day, stars who came up that way had to work harder than others. Tianming said you've become a supporting character artist now?\"Zheng Baozhu nodded again. \"Yes, when I attended the audition, I ran into Director Gao Tianming. He gave me your address. To be honest, I didn't expect it was you.\"Ge Hongyi asked, \"Is it because you didn't expect me to live in a place like this?\"Zheng Baozhu truthfully replied, \"Yes, it was somewhat unexpected. The neighborhood here is quite complex, and I noticed you live alone.\"\"My son wanted me to move to another place, but I don't like those villa areas. They are too quiet and lack vitality,\" Ge Hongyi said, looking outside, \"Look at this place, it's so lively, full of life. I enjoy observing people. Living with people is so interesting. If you make me move to the mountains, that won't do.\"As Zheng Baozhu listened, she nodded slightly. The old community was indeed livelier than high-end neighborhoods, and everyone was very friendly. When newcomers arrived, people could easily recognize them, and the security might even be better.\"Let's go up to the second floor,\" Ge Hongyi took Zheng Baozhu to the second floor, where there were two chairs by the window facing the street. He sat by the window and watched the people passing by, \"I like sitting here when I have nothing to do, observing the people below. People may have different understandings of art, but I have always believed that no matter how refined art is, it cannot be detached from the masses. When your work is completed, it will ultimately be judged by the audience, not just a few judges.\"\"You are right,\" Zheng Baozhu looked out of the window, seeing the mundane life and ordinary people. Each person was unique in their own way, playing the protagonist in their own lives. A student in a school uniform rode a bike into her view, going at full speed while shouting, \"Aunt Wang, move aside, quickly move aside! Ah Cheng, your little brother is running around the street again, hurry and bring him back!\"Aunt Wang promptly pulled a young child back and scolded the kid like a gust of wind, \"Zhou Mengting, you're late for school again! Don't you know how dangerous it is to rush like a maniac every month?!\"Ge Hongyi noticed Zheng Baozhu looking at Zhou Mengting and asked, \"What kind of person do you think Zhou Mengting is?\"\"Well...\" Zheng Baozhu pondered for a moment and answered, \"She seems to be a reckless person on the surface, but her heart is warm. I guess she performs well academically and she's quite skilled at riding a bike. In school, she's full of energy and has many friends. People tend to like being friends with someone energetic like her. There may be boys who have a crush on her, but she may not like any of them. However, deep down, there might be a boy who is different from the others, someone reserved and thoughtful, who has helped her when she faced difficulties. Even though in the boy's eyes, it might have been a small favor, she remembers it. Despite her carefree appearance, she isn't really naive.\"After hearing this, Ge Hongyi stopped laughing and said, \"I see, you're also a warm-hearted and energetic person. People around you must really like you, right?\"Zheng Baozhu adjusted her hair and admitted frankly, \"Yes, that's true. I'm a kind and beautiful person. If someone doesn't like me, it's probably their problem.\"For example, someone with the surname Qu.Ge Hongyi smiled and said, \"Hmm, that's true. But you analyzed so much about Zhou Mengting just by looking at her. You can easily figure out her thoughts.\"Zheng Baozhu also smiled, \"I'm not boasting, but I own a restaurant and a hotel. I interact with people all the time and encounter all kinds of customers every day. Of course, I can't say that I fully understand others, but I enjoy observing people. I think what you said is right. Artists should not be detached from the masses; they should come from and return to the masses. Everyone has their own characteristics and path in life. I like acting because it allows me to experience other people's lives, which is an experience that is hard to come by in other professions.\"Ge Hongyi's smile deepened, \"You and Su Ming do look similar, but your personalities are completely different. You are much more articulate than she ever was.\"\"Well...\" Zheng Baozhu touched her nose, \"I might have a bit of the 'TMI syndrome'. If you don't like someone who talks too much, I can adjust myself!\"\"Haha, no need,\" Ge Hongyi chuckled, \"I think you're fine the way you are. Everyone has their own personality, and that's great. However, in acting, delivering lines on stage is just as important as offstage.\"Ge Hongyi stood up from his chair and said to Zheng Baozhu, \"You can go back today. Come back next week at the same time. I need to think about the best way to teach you, tailored to your needs.\"Zheng Baozhu stood up as well, unable to hide her excitement, \"Teacher Ge, have you decided to teach me?!\"\"Yes, Tianming was right. You are a promising talent,\" Ge Hongyi looked at her with a slight nod, \"But while a teacher can guide you, it's up to the individual to cultivate themselves. I can't guarantee what results you will achieve.\"\"I understand that. I'm already very happy that you are willing to teach me!\" Zheng Baozhu took out her phone and asked, \"Can I have your phone number? In case of emergencies, we can contact each other by phone.\"\"Sure,\" Ge Hongyi gave her a string of digits and then let her go home.Throughout the day, Zheng Baozhu was in a happy state, often smiling to herself while reading in the hotel's reading corner.When Qu Zhi came back from the company, she was still in the same mood.\"What's up with Zheng Baozhu?\" He casually asked Wei Zhen as he passed by him.Wei Zhen glanced at Zheng Baozhu and told Qu Zhi, \"I don't know. She's been like this since she came back. It seems she found some kind of teacher.\"\"A teacher?\" Qu Zhi thought for a moment, then walked over to where Zheng Baozhu was sitting.\"I heard you found a teacher? An acting teacher?\" Qu Zhi spoke, and only then did Zheng Baozhu notice that he had sat down in front of her. She nodded and peeled an orange in her hand.\"Yes, he's a highly respected teacher. Let me put it this way, in the world of martial arts, he's like the abbot of Shaolin or Zhang San from Wudang Mountain.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi couldn't help but comment, \"Are you sure you haven't been deceived? There are so many online scammers these days.\"\"Of course not,\" Zheng Baozhu looked around and leaned closer to Qu Zhi, speaking in a low voice, \"Ge Hongyi is the teacher I met just now. When I went for an audition, Director Gao Tianming gave me his address to meet him today. Today, I met him, and he agreed to teach me. Though it's only one class a week, it's one-on-one instruction. Jackpot!\"\"Oh,\" Qu Zhi responded and also took an orange in his hand to peel, \"So, today was your first class. What did you learn?\"\"Today, we didn't officially start the class, but it wasn't entirely unproductive.\"\"Oh, so what did you gain?\"Zheng Baozhu's voice became even lower than before, \"Ge Hongyi was also my aunt's teacher in the past, and I heard some things about my aunt from him. You probably don't know, but both Zhang Wensheng and Ray were my aunt's ex-boyfriends!!\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Although Qu Zhi had been abroad for many years, the time when Zhang Wensheng and Ray were at the height of their popularity was during his primary and secondary school years. So, he was very familiar with these two names, as they were not only popular among his classmates but also many of his teachers.The news Zheng Baozhu just mentioned was indeed sensational enough to crash Weibo ten times over today.\"Oh my, I really envy my aunt,\" Zheng Baozhu said earnestly, \"And those are just the ones Ge Hongyi knows about. Who knows how many more there were? Ah, all those male gods from that era were my aunt's ex-boyfriends. If I could... well, I shouldn't be so greedy. If half of the current male gods in the entertainment industry were my ex-boyfriends, I'd be content.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"\"Haha, you really have quite the imagination,\" Qu Zhi forcefully peeled an orange and threw the peel on the table. Zheng Baozhu glanced at the orange peel on the table and continued daydreaming about the future, \"Wait a few decades, when people from the future era research our current entertainment industry, they won't have to search through piles of information to find out which male stars were the most popular. They'd just need to look at a list - Zheng Baozhu's ex-boyfriends - and they'd know who the hottest male stars are. Hahaha!\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Your dreams are getting more and more wild. :)\"I think you should recognize reality and give up on these fantasies,\" Qu Zhi forcefully peeled another segment of the orange and fed it to Zheng Baozhu, and some orange juice splattered on her face.\"Hey, could you be a bit more gentle when peeling? Are you peeling an orange or torturing it!\" Zheng Baozhu wiped the orange juice off her face with her hand.\"...\"Qu Zhi peeled off another segment of the orange, fed it to her, and said, \"This orange is so sour! What kind of orange is this?\"\"It's a jelly orange, how could it be sour?\" Zheng Baozhu grabbed the orange from Qu Zhi's hand, peeled off a segment, and fed it to herself, \"It's fine; it's not sour at all. Maybe you just had vinegar and thought it was sour.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"He held the orange, stood up, and walked away without looking back.\"...\"Zheng Baozhu looked at his back and shrugged, \"What a strange person. So mysterious for no reason.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 34": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng Baozhu didn't pay any further attention to Qu Zhi and immediately forwarded the contract that Gao Boyun had sent her to her lawyer. Her lawyer was someone she had known since she started her restaurant business, and he had also helped her with many contracts when she was preparing to open the hotel. They had known each other for many years, so Zheng Baozhu trusted him quite a bit. However, since his expertise was in a different field, she wasn't sure how familiar he was with entertainment industry contracts.Lawyer Han responded quickly with three question marks.Lawyer Han: ???Lawyer Han: Are you going to enter the entertainment industry???Zheng Baozhu: Well, I have been considering opportunities in that area recently.Lawyer Han: ...Boss Zheng is truly extraordinary.Lawyer Han: I'll take a look at it for you. However, I'm more experienced with contracts in business fields. If you're really expanding into this area, I can recommend a friend who is more specialized in this field.Zheng Baozhu: Okay, Lawyer Han is reliable indeed. [Pat on the back]Lawyer Han: ...Reviewing a contract would take some time, as the devil is often in the details. He hadn't replied to Zheng Baozhu yet, but Gao Boyun seemed a bit impatient.Gao Boyun: Haven't you reviewed the contract yet? If everything is fine, let's sign it quickly and start shooting immediately.Zheng Baozhu: Wait a bit! Lawyer Han hasn't replied yet!Gao Boyun: ?Gao Boyun: You don't have a manager, but you have a lawyer?Zheng Baozhu: That's right, I do have a strong sense of the law.Gao Boyun: ...You think the salary from this role is enough to pay for a lawyer?Although the entertainment industry is now offering sky-high paychecks, it's mainly for A-list actors, and even their fees often come with some hidden terms. Their production doesn't offer astronomical salaries, especially so for a small supporting role like Zheng Baozhu's, with less than five episodes, the pay is not much.Zheng Baozhu: It's enough, your production is not paying that low either, have some confidence!Gao Boyun: ...Gao Boyun: Once you've reviewed it, sign the contract quickly, then we'll proceed with makeup and take the official photos. By the way, you'd better sign with a talent agent. Otherwise, you'll have to handle everything by yourself, and you might be overwhelmed.Zheng Baozhu: (\u2299-\u2299) What else could happen later? After I finish shooting for Ye Ling, I'll just continue working in the Film and Television City doing other jobs.Gao Boyun: ...Have some confidence! What if you become really popular?Zheng Baozhu: (\u2299-\u2299) But won't the drama need to air until the end of next year?Gao Boyun: ...You make a valid point.Gao Boyun: But what if other opportunities come up next year?Zheng Baozhu: If opportunities come, I'll consider them at that time. Otherwise, I'll end up supporting the agent instead.Gao Boyun: ...Gao Boyun: Then, do you want to sign with my studio?Zheng Baozhu was taken aback. Sign with Gao Boyun's studio? She hadn't thought about that, but although Gao Boyun was currently a lesser-known director, he was still the son of Gao Tianming and would likely have more connections and resources than an average person.Zheng Baozhu: Does Director Gao really think highly of me??? Signing with a studio under Director Gao's name would definitely ensure a good future. However, if I sign, does that mean you'll become my boss?Gao Boyun: What else?Zheng Baozhu: Then, wouldn't I have to listen to everything you say? I wouldn't be able to make my own decisions about what roles to take or not?Gao Boyun: ...Once you sign with a company, there will be certain limitations, of course.Zheng Baozhu: orz I see. In that case, let's forget about this for now. Focusing on my current work is the most important thing.Signing with a talent agent was not an urgent matter for Zheng Baozhu at the moment. Being an actress had been her dream since childhood, and she didn't want to reach a point where she would be constrained by signing with a company.Fortunately, nowadays many stars establish their own studios, becoming their own bosses. Why not do the same?After Lawyer Han reviewed the contract for Zheng Baozhu, she formally signed it with Gao Boyun. Soon, the production team contacted her for makeup trials. On the day she went for makeup, the lead actors were not present, only a few supporting actors like her were there for makeup trials.As Zheng Baozhu entered the makeup room, she saw an actor just finishing her makeup. She sat down next to her and started getting her makeup and styling done.Ye Ling's character in the original work was an otherworldly divine doctor, so her appearance would certainly be ethereal. Zheng Baozhu's makeup was kept simple and elegant, with just a hint of crimson on the hairpin she wore on her head. Once her styling was complete, she put on Ye Ling's white robe and carried the small medicine basket prepared by the crew on her back.The basket was exquisitely made and matched Ye Ling's attire perfectly. As Zheng Baozhu put it on, she felt like a young girl gathering mushrooms.\"All done, go over and let the director and others have a look,\" the makeup artist was quite satisfied with the look, as she had been worried it might be too plain and unremarkable. However, the actor had a very beautiful face, and even with this simple and fresh makeup, she exuded an otherworldly charm that wouldn't go unnoticed.Zheng Baozhu followed the makeup artist to the adjacent room, where Gao Boyun and other key members of the production were resting and discussing matters. The door of the room was open, but Zheng Baozhu still knocked twice before entering.As soon as she entered, everyone's eyes fell on her, and someone praised spontaneously, \"Beautiful, very pretty, well done!\"Gao Boyun stood on the opposite side and said, \"Turn around, let me see.\"Zheng Baozhu turned around in place, showcasing her appearance to everyone.\"It looks great, but I think we can make it slightly more intense. It's a bit too understated now, only the actor's charm is carrying the whole look,\" Gao Boyun communicated with the makeup artist next to Zheng Baozhu, \"Your temperament is excellent. Even with heavy makeup, you won't look tacky. So you can add a little more without worrying. Also, let's switch to the other pair of earrings we prepared.\"\"Okay, I'll make the adjustments,\" the makeup artist and Zheng Baozhu returned to the makeup room to make the changes. They didn't make major changes, just intensified the eye shadow and lipstick slightly, and added a bit more blush to make her appear more radiant.When they showed the revised look to the creative team, Gao Boyun nodded in approval, \"This is great, just like this. Let's take the official photos now.\"The official photoshoot was held in another room. As Zheng Baozhu entered, the photographer was sitting inside drinking water. He looked slightly surprised when he saw a new actor coming in and put down the water bottle before standing up, \"You're very pretty. Are you a supporting actor too?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu smiled and nodded, then stood in front of the backdrop.\"This is an underestimation of your talent,\" the photographer adjusted the equipment and asked her to move a bit backward, \"Yes, right there, try a different pose.\"Thanks to her dance background, Zheng Baozhu naturally coordinated her poses, and the photographer was delighted with the shots, taking many of them. After they were done, it was already dark outside. Zheng Baozhu changed back into her own clothes and glanced at Gao Boyun, who was at the door.Gao Boyun walked out, seeing her acting suspiciously, \"What's up? Need something from me?\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and pulled him aside, \"Well, Director Gao, I mean, not you, but your father, introduced me to a teacher\u2026\"\"Wait a minute,\" Gao Boyun couldn't help but interrupt her, \"When did you meet my father?\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him even more strangely, \"What? Don't you know? It was on the day I went to audition for the role.\"\"...\"Gao Boyun's eyelid twitched, \"My dad was there that day too?\"\"Yeah, he was sitting on the stage, all wrapped up tightly,\" Zheng Baozhu waved her hand, dismissing the topic, \"That's not the point. The point is that he introduced me to a teacher, and I've already met the teacher. The teacher agreed to teach me, but I don't know how to discuss the tuition fee. I feel awkward bringing up the question as if I'm implying that the teacher...\"Gao Boyun listened with some bewilderment. He interrupted her and asked, \"What's so embarrassing about that? Is your teacher some kind of immortal who doesn't care about worldly matters?\"\"Um, it's something like that. The point is, this teacher really doesn't need my money...\"Gao Boyun interrupted her again, \"Who is this teacher?\"Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and honestly replied, \"Ge Hongyi, Teacher Ge.\"Gao Boyun: \"???\"How many more surprises do you have in store for me? :)After a long silence, Gao Boyun smiled and said, \"You mean, my dad introduced Teacher Ge to you?\"Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"That's what I mean.\"\"And you don't know my dad?\"\"I really don't. Otherwise, I'd just contact him directly. But for now, I can only find you, right?\"Gao Boyun felt that the father-son relationship between himself and his father was facing a tremendous challenge. Why was his dad secretly meddling in so many things? Did he want to come and snatch Zheng Baozhu from him?\"Director Gao, can you help me ask your dad how to handle the tuition fee? Since it was his introduction, I thought I should inquire with him first to avoid appearing too presumptuous if I were to ask Teacher Ge directly. But I can't just let him teach me for free, right?\"Gao Boyun looked at her and said, \"Teacher Ge's tuition fee should be quite expensive.\"\"Money is not an issue.\"Gao Boyun finally voiced the question in his heart, \"Are you really just a small supporting actor?\"Zheng Baozhu remained silent for a moment and then said, \"Actually, I have other businesses.\"\"What?\"\"I have a restaurant and a hotel.\"Gao Boyun: \"...\"Gao Boyun wiped his face and smiled, \"President Zheng, would you like to invest more money in our drama?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Though Gao Boyun's worldview was shaken, he still went to ask his dad about the tuition fees.At this time, the productions team's Weibo had just announced the news of the start of filming for [New Moon Wuxin Sword]. The production team released the photos of the filming, and soon, Lin Ziqin dominated all the trending discussions.After a while, Gao Boyun also hurried over and finally managed to get his own two comments to the top. Zheng Baozhu hadn't joined the crew yet, so naturally, she didn't participate in the booting ceremony. She clicked on the large image of the booting photos and took a look. The male lead's appearance was quite good, especially since it was Lin Ziqin, truly living up to the title of the rising star of historical dramas; he stood out in this group photo.As she was immersed in all the discussions, she received a message from Gao Boyun.Gao Boyun: Are you Su Ming's neice?Zheng Baozhu: \"......\"She temporarily quit Weibo and replied to Gao Boyun: Calm down, don't blow my cover.Gao Boyun: \"......\"He thought he had casually picked up someone from the Film and Television City, but he didn't expect to get someone with such a background.This incident made him doubt himself for a while because he was still thinking about nurturing Zheng Baozhu and building a good relationship with each other. However, when the retouched version of the [New Moon Wuxin Sword] makeup photos came out, he felt reassured.He enthusiastically posted a new Weibo update.Gao Boyun: Found a treasure, our actress is really beautiful. [Image]As per their plan, the makeup photos were supposed to be released after the filming was finished, so he didn't fully reveal Zheng Baozhu's face. Instead, he cropped the photo to show only her nose and eyes. Zheng Baozhu had a delicate and beautiful appearance, and this partial photo was not only beautiful but also left ample room for imagination.Many people in the entertainment circle inquired about the identity of the actress, but Gao Boyun remained secretive and didn't reveal much.On Christmas Day, many people on Weibo were sharing their holiday celebrations, but Gao Boyun stood out by showcasing his actors.Zheng Baozhu's hotel was busy that day with many guests coming for dinner. When she had a free moment, she checked her Weibo and saw Gao Boyun's post. Her eyes brightened, and she sent him a private message: \"Director Gao, the makeup photo is out? Can I take a look?\"Gao Boyun: [Image] Don't spread it around.Gao Boyun: This is not the final version; there may be changes later.Zheng Baozhu: Wow!! I look really good!Gao Boyun: \"......\"Gao Boyun: How are you faring under Teacher Ge's guidance?Zheng Baozhu: I've just taken a couple of classes. Although it hasn't been long, I already feel the benefits are substantial! The tuition issue has also been resolved, thanks to you.Gao Boyun: You're welcome. Study hard, and when you join the crew, I won't go easy on you.Zheng Baozhu: Okay\u2026\"Miss Baozhu, Mr. Tan is here!\" Liang Huihui approached her from behind, bending down to say, \"He's in the lobby playing with the claw machine!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"......\"Hearing that Mr. Tan was playing with the claw machine again, Zheng Baozhu forgot about her meal and grabbed a tissue. She followed Liang Huihui outside. Indeed, Tan Yao was standing in front of the claw machine, playing with the joystick. Today, he dressed specially to match the Christmas atmosphere, wearing a combination of red and green.Zheng Baozhu walked up to him, smiled, and said, \"Mr. Tan, Merry Christmas.\"Upon hearing the voice, Tan Yao turned around with a smile, \"Miss Baozhu, it's been a while! I finally had some free time to come and see you today!\"Zheng Baozhu maintained her smile, \"What doll do you want to grab? How about I help you?\"The dolls in the claw machine had been changed; now there were new Christmas limited-edition dolls. Tan Yao was trying to grab one of those limited-edition dolls, but after all this time, his skills hadn't improved much.However, that didn't matter because he didn't come here today to play with the claw machine; he wanted to invite Zheng Baozhu to spend Christmas together.\"Miss Baozhu, are you free tonight?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"No, as you can see, the hotel is very busy today.\"\"...\" Tan Yao paused for a moment and said politely, \"That's okay; we can have our date here.\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him, \"A date?\"\"Yes,\" Tan Yao said confidently, \"You promised to teach me how to play the claw machine, and you haven't fulfilled that yet. How about teaching me today?\"\"...Alright,\" Zheng Baozhu walked over to the claw machine and asked him, \"Which one do you want to grab?\"Tan Yao pointed to the Christmas limited-edition doll, \"That one. I want to grab it and give it to you.\"Zheng Baozhu studied the doll's position, then explained various techniques to Tan Yao. While they were doing that, Qu Zhi's voice suddenly came from behind, \"What are you two doing?\"Both Tan Yao and Zheng Baozhu turned to see Qu Zhi. Tan Yao's expression changed when he saw Qu Zhi. Although he hadn't found an opportunity to let his friends meet Zheng Baozhu yet, they had already gathered information about Qu Zhi. They had learned that Qu Zhi was a handsome guy who had recently returned from overseas and was working in the nearby Science and Technology Park. He was considered a high-end talent.What infuriated him the most was that Qu Zhi took advantage of being childhood friends with Zheng Baozhu and brazenly lived in her hotel, meeting Zheng Baozhu every day!He thought he was the only one capable of such shameless actions!\"Oh, Mr. Qu Zhi, right?\" Tan Yao smiled at Qu Zhi and then leaned toward Zheng Baozhu, \"Miss Baozhu is teaching me how to play the claw machine.\"Qu Zhi furrowed his brows imperceptibly. He glanced at the claw machine behind them and then told Tan Yao, \"The trick to grabbing dolls is simple. It's just a matter of probability. As long as you try enough times, you'll eventually grab one.\"Tan Yao: \"...\"What an incredibly impressive trick, indeed.However, Zheng Baozhu, standing by the side, nodded convincingly, \"He's right, that's how it works.\"Before Tan Yao could say anything, Liang Huihui rushed over, \"Miss Baozhu, there's a guest waiting for you in the garden!\"Zheng Baozhu followed Liang Huihui and left. Tan Yao hesitated for a moment, then decided not to take any action. He glanced at Qu Zhi and teasingly smiled, \"I'll wait for Miss Baozhu here. Did you see this doll? I'll grab it for her when she comes back.\"Qu Zhi coldly looked at the doll in the machine and sneered, \"Oh, with your zero to four skills?\"Tan Yao: \"...\"Wasn't this joke getting old?\"You'll see how amazing I am soon enough,\" Tan Yao boasted with determination, rolling up his sleeves and trying to grab the doll again. Qu Zhi stood by, watching him grab the doll, sway it for a while, and then it fell back down, \"Oh, it fell again. Truly amazing.\"Tan Yao: \"...\"\"You!\" He was about to argue with Qu Zhi when his phone, in his pocket, started ringing. He took it out and saw the caller ID, his brows furrowed, \"Dad...\"\"You still remember I'm your dad? Where did you run off to again!\"Tan Yao unhappily retorted, \"Today is Christmas, can't you let me celebrate it!\"\"Are you a foreigner? What's there to celebrate about some foreign holiday? Hurry back!\"Tan Yao hung up in annoyance. He glanced at Qu Zhi across from him, lifted his head arrogantly, hummed at him, and then quickly left.Qu Zhi watched him leave, then walked up to the claw machine and scanned the QR code.After Zheng Baozhu finished her work, she returned to the lobby only to find that both Tan Yao and Qu Zhi were gone. She didn't bother asking where Tan Yao went; as long as he left, it was fine. She went back to her room, planning to take a bath and rest. As soon as she filled the bathtub with water, the room phone rang.She rushed over to pick up the phone and an electronic voice sounded from the receiver, \"Hello, dear guest. I am your delivery robot. Your ordered takeaway has arrived.\"Zheng Baozhu was stunned. When did she order takeaway? She walked over, opened the door, and indeed, the delivery robot was standing outside. She pressed the open compartment button and found that it wasn't a takeaway the robot brought, but a doll and a single rose.The doll happened to be the Christmas limited edition doll from the claw machine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The delivery robot stood on the opposite side and prompted, \"Dear guest, please remember to close the door after collecting your takeaway.\"Zheng Baozhu took out the packaged rose, pressed the door lock button, and after the robot closed the door, it spun around and proceeded on its way while speaking. Zheng Baozhu closed the door, holding the rose and doll as she walked back into her room.She wondered who sent these gifts. Was it Tan Yao?Thinking of Tan Yao's playful nature, Zheng Baozhu shook her head slightly. It couldn't be him; he would have made a big fuss about it in the lobby with a loudspeaker if he was the one who caught the doll. This unique way of delivering the gifts seemed more like something Qu Zhi would come up with.But Qu Zhi? That seemed far-fetched even to Zheng Baozhu herself. However, she couldn't think of anyone else who might have done it. Just as she was pondering over this, Tan Yao called her.Picking up the phone, Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow and answered, \"Mr. Tan, is there something you need?\"Tan Yao complained on the other end, \"My dad just nagged at me like he was urging me to my death. I guess I'll come help you catch dolls next time.\"\"No need for that,\" Zheng Baozhu replied, glancing at the doll in her hand; indeed, it wasn't Tan Yao who caught it.Tan Yao continued, \"Today is really embarrassing. My dad won't let me celebrate foreign festivals. I'll come see you next time on New Year's Day. He won't have anything to say then!\"\"...You should probably listen to your dad,\" Zheng Baozhu suggested.Tan Yao clicked his tongue on the phone, \"All he does is scold me every day. I just don't understand. If he thinks I can't do anything right, why does he keep me tied to the company? But forget about him. I've ordered a Christmas cake for you; it should be delivered soon. Remember to eat it.\"Zheng Baozhu blinked, and she told Tan Yao, \"Tan Yao, I don't have feelings for you like that.\"Tan Yao was caught off guard by Zheng Baozhu's refusal and all he could think of was \"I'm not listening, I'm not listening\".\"Don't say it so absolutely! You haven't discovered my charm yet!\" Tan Yao tried to defend himself with some force, \"I won't talk to you anymore; I'm driving now. Don't throw away the cake!\"After saying this, Tan Yao hung up without giving Zheng Baozhu a chance to respond.Zheng Baozhu put down the phone in speechlessness and looked at the doll in her hand again. Could it be Qu Zhi who sent it?She placed the doll in a specially-made cabinet designed to display dolls, then walked to the bedside and picked up the phone to call the front desk. Xiao Yu answered the call promptly, \"Hello, Miss Baozhu, do you need anything?\"Zheng Baozhu asked, \"Did you see Qu Zhi using the delivery robot downstairs?\"\"Delivery robot?\" Xiao Yu pondered for a moment and replied, \"No, but Mr. Qu ordered takeaway, and it was delivered by a robot.\"\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu thought for a while and said, \"I ran out of toothpaste in my room. Can you have the robot bring a box of toothpaste for me?\"\"Sure!\"After hanging up the phone, Zheng Baozhu looked around her room and noticed the Christmas candies that were prepared by the restaurant. They were made from fruits and included nuts inside, which she really liked. She picked up a few bags and gently shook one in her hand.She found a pen on the table, bent down to write a line on the small card of the candy bag, and then waited for the hardworking little robot to deliver the toothpaste.Zheng Baozhu opened the door for the robot, took the toothpaste out, pressed a few buttons on its interface, and entered the management mode. After setting everything up, she placed the Christmas candies inside the robot and closed the door for it.Once the robot confirmed the door was closed, it turned and left. Zheng Baozhu saw it heading toward Qu Zhi's room before she went back to her own room and closed the door.Qu Zhi was busy searching for information when the phone in his room suddenly rang. He answered the call, and indeed, it was the voice of the delivery robot on the other end. The takeaway he ordered had already been delivered, so someone was sending him something else now?He opened the door for the robot and received a bag of candies from its \"belly\". There was a small card attached to the candy bag, and Qu Zhi picked it up to read. On the card was a short message - \"Thank you for the rose; this is a return gift.\"Qu Zhi stood there for a moment and subconsciously glanced in the direction of Zheng Baozhu's room.At this moment, Zheng Baozhu had already removed her makeup and changed into her bathrobe, with her hair wrapped up. She was about to start her bath when the phone in her room rang again, prompting her to slip on her slippers and rush out.When she opened the door, she found the delivery robot still standing there.It seemed exceptionally busy tonight.Zheng Baozhu opened the robot's storage compartment and found another small card inside. She picked it up and opened it, finding Qu Zhi's handwriting.\"No need to be polite. I came across a flower-selling girl on the way back; she gave me the last one. The candies are delicious.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"There's no need to have the robot run again for these notes!...Give back the candies!Zheng Baozhu tossed the card aside and went back to her room to take a bath.The next day, the restaurant still had some festive atmosphere; the decorations were still up, but yesterday's limited-time dishes were taken off the menu. Zheng Baozhu woke up early and went to the restaurant for breakfast. When Qu Zhi came down, he happened to see Zheng Baozhu and walked over to her.\"Morning,\" he said, sitting across from Zheng Baozhu with a tray of food. Zheng Baozhu glanced at him and offered a fake smile while holding a spoon, \"Morning.\"Qu Zhi remained silent for a moment but was then drawn to the red velvet cake on the table, \"Where did you get this cake? I didn't see it before.\"\"Do you want to try it?\" Zheng Baozhu sliced a piece of red velvet cake and put it on a plate, passing it to him, \"It tastes pretty good.\"Qu Zhi picked up a fork and took a bite, \"Hmm, but it seems different from the cakes the hotel usually makes. Did they change the chef?\"Zheng Baozhu chuckled and looked at him, \"Your taste buds are quite sensitive.\"Liag Huihui, who was clearing the dishes nearby, happened to overhear this.What? Miss Baozhu praised Mr. Qu's sensitive taste buds? What did they do??Oh, goodness!She quickly left while carrying the tray.Meanwhile, Zheng Baozhu sat at the table and said to Qu Zhi, \"This cake was sent by Tan Yao last night. I had already brushed my teeth, so I didn't eat it and put it in the fridge. I took it out this morning.\"Ahem, cough.Qu Zhi lightly covered his mouth and coughed twice suddenly.Zheng Baozhu watched him and asked, \"What's wrong? Choking?\"\"Cough...\" Qu Zhi coughed again and reached for a glass of water, \"No, I just suddenly felt a bit choked.\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"Well, drink more water then.\"Qu Zhi silently drank half a glass of water and didn't touch the red velvet cake again.\"Oh, by the way, let me ask you something,\" Zheng Baozhu ate a piece of cake and inquired, \"Does your laboratory's guidance robot, the one developed for the subway station, still need funding for the project?\"Qu Zhi put down the water glass, wiped the corner of his mouth with a tissue, and asked, \"Why? Are you interested in investing?\"\"No,\" Zheng Baozhu said, \"I had previously consulted with Teacher Ge about the tuition fee. He said he didn't want to charge me for teaching. But I didn't want to take advantage of him either. So after discussing with Teacher Ge, he said I could donate the tuition fee for a good cause, and it's up to me what kind of good cause I want to support.\"Qu Zhi nodded understandingly and said, \"Our project has government funding, so there's currently no problem with funding. If you really want to donate to a good cause, you can donate to organizations that support people with disabilities.\"\"Oh... alright, I'll go back and think about it,\" Zheng Baozhu responded and continued eating.Qu Zhi looked at the large red velvet cake on the table and asked, \"Can you finish such a big cake all by yourself?\"\"I only had this small piece, the rest is untouched. I'll bring it to Huihui and the others later,\" Zheng Baozhu replied.\"Okay,\" Qu Zhi replied nonchalantly and didn't say anything further.Suddenly, Zheng Baozhu's phone started vibrating like crazy. She looked at the person sending the messages and couldn't help but chuckle.Cen Tongtong: [Group chat history]Cen Tongtong: [Group chat history]Cen Tongtong: What tongue? What sensitivity? It's too scandalous, such a corrupting influence!Cen Tongtong: How can Qu Zhi, a promising researcher, do such a thing? Is it the extinction of humanity or the decline of morality!Zheng Baozhu: ........Zheng Baozhu: Seriously, you should leave the group right away. CP can reduce one's intelligence.Qu Zhi glanced at Zheng Baozhu, who was tapping her phone, and asked, \"What's wrong?\"Zheng Baozhu locked her phone with a \"pat\" and raised her head, smiling at him, \"Nothing, hehe.\"She absolutely couldn't let Qu Zhi know about the existence of that group. :)She lowered her head again, pretending to be nonchalant, and continued eating breakfast. Cen Tongtong couldn't provoke any response, so she went straight to Qu Zhi's side.Qu Zhi looked at the flood of chat history that Cen Tongtong sent over and fell into deep contemplation.Zheng Baozhu thought he was troubled by something related to his research project, so she asked, \"What's wrong? Is there a problem with your research project?\"\"It's not my research project,\" Qu Zhi paused slightly, \"Or rather, it's a field I've never ventured into.\"Curiosity piqued, Zheng Baozhu asked, \"Ah? What kind of field is so difficult for you?\"From childhood to now, she had never seen any subject that could trouble Qu Zhi and make him look so serious.Qu Zhi said, \"CP.\"\"Ahem, cough,\" Zheng Baozhu quickly grabbed a tissue, covered her mouth, and stood up from the table, pretending to be in a hurry, \"I'm full now, see you later!\"She picked up her phone and hurriedly left. Qu Zhi watched her hurriedly depart and replied to Cen Tongtong, \"There's nothing going on. Stop spreading rumors, quit the group to preserve your intelligence.\"Cen Tongtong: ......Both of you are saying the same thing! And you said there's nothing going on!!Qu Zhi: \"......\"On Tuesday, Zheng Baozhu went to study with Teacher Ge as usual. This time, she brought some fruits from the orchard. Teacher Ge didn't charge her for tuition, but they could still enjoy the fruits.The courtyard was particularly lively today. Besides Ge Hongyi, a few neighbors were sitting there chatting. Zheng Baozhu had been here a few times before, so she quickly greeted the neighbors around her. After entering the courtyard and seeing the people, she smiled and walked up to them, saying, \"Aunt Wang, Cheng, you all seem so happy today. Did you come here to chat with Teacher Ge? Coincidentally, I brought some fresh fruits from the orchard this morning. Please try them.\"Zheng Baozhu walked to the pavilion and placed the fruits on the table, giving each of them one. Aunt Wang and Cheng were delighted, and they praised her, \"Our Baozhu is not only beautiful but also sweet, and she knows how to respect the elders.\"\"Yes, where can we find such a good girl?\" Aunt Wang looked at her, squinting with a smile, \"Baozhu, let me introduce you to a boyfriend. He works at the hospital. Although he's busy with work most of the time, he's really a good person, kind-hearted and capable, just like you!\"\"Hey, Xiao Wang, is this kind-hearted and capable young man you're talking about your nephew?\" Teacher Ge came out of the house, holding a box. Aunt Wang smiled apologetically and replied, \"So what if he's my nephew? Although he is my nephew, everything I said just now was true. Baozhu, consider it, okay?\"Cheng added, \"You can tell from Baozhu's qualities that she won't be interested in the boys who are chasing after her, let alone your nephew!\"\"Let's have a fair competition, right, Baozhu?\" Aunt Wang looked at Zheng Baozhu with a smile, \"Tell me, what kind of boy do you like? Even if my nephew is not suitable, I can find someone else who's suitable for you.\"Zheng Baozhu smiled at Aunt Wang, peeled an orange, and handed it to her, \"Aunt Wang, right now, my mind is focused on studying and working. I don't want to date anyone.\"\"Oh, that won't do. Work is important, but you should also consider dating,\" Aunt Wang persisted and continued to promote her nephew, \"How about this? I'll show you his picture later, and you can see if you two are a good match. Although he may not be as handsome as the male stars in the entertainment industry, he's decent-looking.\"\"Okay, that's enough. You didn't come here today to set Baozhu up on a blind date,\" Ge Hongyi placed the box he was holding on the table and sat on the chair. Zheng Baozhu curiously looked at the box and asked Ge Hongyi, \"What's inside this box?\"Ge Hongyi smiled and said, \"Aren't you young people into playing murder mystery games lately? Well, inside this box is a script I wrote myself for a murder mystery game. I invited you all\u00a0to play the game together.\"Zheng Baozhu's eyes widened, greatly surprised. Not only does Teacher Ge play murder mystery games, but he also wrote his own script??\"Surprised?\" Ge Hongyi\u00a0looked at her and smiled, \"I created this script specifically to train students' acting skills, so the mechanisms might not be as complex, but it's designed to be challenging. During our classes, we want to mix education with entertainment.\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and said, \"Teacher Ge's teaching method is indeed creative. But it's just a few of us?\"The murder mystery game she played before required at least four players, and now they only had three, excluding Teacher Ge as the author.\"There's one more person, Xiao Ling. Oh, there she is!\" Ge Hongyi\u00a0pointed to the entrance. Zheng Baozhu followed his gaze and saw a young girl in a down jacket walking in. She wore black-framed glasses on her face and slightly bowed her head, looking somewhat timid.\"Let me introduce you. This is Xiao Ling, an illustrator\u2014\"Xiao Ling interrupted him, \"Teacher Ge, I'm not an illustrator. I'm just a sketch artist, earning a living by drawing.\"\"Alright, a sketch artist then. Come, sit here,\" Ge Hongyi\u00a0gestured for her to sit beside Zheng Baozhu. Zheng Baozhu greeted her with a smile, but Xiao Ling seemed a bit nervous and only nodded slightly.\"Now that we're all here, we can begin,\" Ge Hongyi opened the box and took out four different character scripts, handing one to each of them, \"I've assigned the characters. Take a look first. Xiao Cheng, do you remember the rules I told you before?\"\"I remember, I remember,\" Cheng replied somewhat discontentedly, glancing at him, \"Teacher Ge, I'm more than ten years younger than you. How dare you make me address you that way?\"Ge Hongyi chuckled, \"Well, I'm just following Xiao Wang's lead. Should I also call you Xiao Cheng?\"Hearing their banter, Zheng Baozhu smiled and flipped open the script to read. The script revolved around the relationships between four neighbors, appearing harmonious on the surface but hiding undercurrents of tension. Each family seemed to be concealing something they didn't want others to know.After reading for a while, Zheng Baozhu found that the script was surprisingly suitable for Aunt Wang and Cheng to play. No wonder Teacher Ge invited them.Aunt Wang and Cheng were both first-timers in playing the murder mystery game, but due to the excellent scripts provided by Teacher Ge, their performances were so lifelike that Zheng Baozhu was impressed. It indeed verified the saying that experts arise from common people. These two were like hidden actresses among ordinary folks.Though Xiao Ling didn't speak much, every time she opened her mouth, she hit the mark and even set the tone effortlessly. She was also a formidable player not to be underestimated.Throughout the whole process, Zheng Baozhu struggled to survive. The script she got was the most difficult among the four, and her character was the most complex. Especially as the plot progressed, the layers of her character built up, and how to grasp the role and naturally present the character's depth was something Zheng Baozhu had to think about on her own.When the voting ended, Zheng Baozhu barely escaped; Aunt Wang and Cheng couldn't believe they were deceived by her. They kept talking about it even as they left.Zheng Baozhu quickly stuffed a few oranges into their hands.Ge Hongyi observed the entire performance; during the debriefing, he pointed out some of Zheng Baozhu's issues and praised her strengths, \"You have a precise understanding of the characters and have your own interpretations. That's your advantage. Acting requires actors to have their own insights. The theoretical knowledge we all learn is the same, but why do the final performances differ? It's because each person has a different understanding of the character, and each chooses different methods of interpretation. I can't judge who's right or wrong, but I can say that some people use the most suitable method, making their performance outstanding.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter returning from Teacher Ge's place, Zheng Baozhu reviewed her today's performance and organized her thoughts. She had attended classes with Teacher Ge numerous times, and each time, she felt that she gained new insights.Of course, she didn't neglect the practice of basic skills, which was also a requirement set by Teacher Ge. Zheng Baozhu practiced lines and postures for two hours every day. This was probably the most fair thing for every actor because, regardless of how talented someone was, basic skills could only be honed through consistent practice over time; they wouldn't improve without reason.While she was practicing, Meng Yaxin called her. Zheng Baozhu maintained the tone and manner she had just used and answered the phone, \"Heh, it's you again, my unlucky star. What do you want from me today? Need my help again?\"Meng Yaxin: \"...\"\"Sorry for bothering you; it seems I dialed the wrong number,\" Meng Yaxin said and hung up the phone. Zheng Baozhu put down her phone and waited for a couple of seconds, then Meng Yaxin's call came in again.Zheng Baozhu pressed the screen, and Meng Yaxin's voice came through the speaker, \"I double-checked; I didn't dial the wrong number, so it must be your brain acting up.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu cleared her throat and spoke in a normal tone, \"I'm practicing my lines; what do you want?\"Meng Yaxin made two clicking sounds and continued, \"There's a fashion show on the 31st; I got two tickets. Do you want to go?\"\"A fashion show?\" Zheng Baozhu was a bit puzzled, \"Which brand is it, and why are they having a show at this time?\"Meng Yaxin replied, \"It's not an international big brand; Senrui has a collaboration with a comic IP and is holding a show to release their spring and summer collection.\"Although Senrui, as Meng Yaxin said, wasn't an international big brand, it was still an established domestic brand and held a considerable market share in the country. Zheng Baozhu remembered that Senrui was particularly popular when she was a child. Later, it faced competition from other brands and gradually declined. However, in recent years, it underwent a change in style and marketing strategy, making a comeback in the public eye. Senrui now had three sub-brands, with the highest-end one targeting high-end consumers, and their prices were not low.Zheng Baozhu was somewhat interested in these things. After thinking for a moment, she said to Meng Yaxin, \"Sure, send me the time and location, and we'll meet there.\"\"Okay, it's at the exhibition center in Starlight Park, very close to you.\"\"...That's true.\"The exhibition center in Star Park had hosted many exhibitions since its construction, and fashion shows were not unusual events there. Zheng Baozhu thought about going to Senrui's fashion show and took out a set of Senrui clothes from the wardrobe to wear for the event.When they drove to the venue, almost all the parking spaces were taken, indicating the high enthusiasm for this fashion show. After parking the car, Zheng Baozhu went to Gate 3 to find Meng Yaxin. There were a lot of people at the entrance, including various internet celebrities and invited guests.Zheng Baozhu sent a message to Meng Yaxin, \"I can't find you. Why don't you find me? I think I'll be more noticeable.\"Meng Yaxin: ......True sisters. :)Putting down her phone, Zheng Baozhu looked around... Though she didn't want to admit it, she did stand out. She spotted Meng Yaxin walking toward her. Some people even mistook Zheng Baozhu for an internet celebrity and wanted to interview her.\"No, I'm just an ordinary audience here to watch the show,\" Zheng Baozhu politely declined the interview and saw Meng Yaxin approaching, \"My friend is here, excuse me.\"She walked over to Meng Yaxin, who was holding an invitation card as she mockingly said, \"Hey, it looks like you can't hide your star quality anymore.\"\"Calm down,\" Zheng Baozhu brushed her hair behind her ear and smiled at Meng Yaxin, \"I thought after knowing me for so long, you'd be used to my looks.\"\"...Ugh,\" Meng Yaxin handed her an invitation card, and they entered the venue together.Although it wasn't an international grand show, the venue was decorated in a high-end and fashionable manner. Zheng Baozhu and Meng Yaxin found their seats and couldn't resist taking selfies with their phones. There were many internet celebrities around, live streaming the event, and it was said that some brand endorsers would also appear later. Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and suddenly tapped Meng Yaxin's shoulder, \"I just remembered, isn't Lin Ziqin the spokesperson for Senrui?\"\"You're just realizing it now?\" Meng Yaxin took out her compact and elegantly touched up her makeup, \"Otherwise, what do you think I'm so proactive for?\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu fell silent for a moment, \"To watch the show?\"Meng Yaxin put away her compact and seemed a bit annoyed, \"Who cares if their clothes look good!\"\"...\"\"But Senrui has more than just Lin Ziqin as their spokesperson; I wonder which other celebrities will be here today.\" Meng Yaxin expressed dissatisfaction with this practice of not announcing who would attend, \"I hope their clothes are nice, or else I'll have wasted my trip.\"After the audience was seated, the fashion show began promptly. Senrui hired models who weren't international supermodels but had some fame in the country, resulting in a good overall effect. The designs of the clothes this time were also quite eye-catching, especially the spring and summer collections, which were artistic and romantic. Zheng Baozhu was already eyeing several pieces from the audience.\"Sensui has been doing well in recent years. Their fashion designs are getting better and better,\" Zheng Baozhu said to Meng Yaxin.Meng Yaxin replied, \"They underwent a restructuring at the top level and changed their designers. Indeed, their style has changed significantly. Their marketing strategy has also become smarter. First, they invited internet celebrities to endorse, and now they are so high-profile with this comic IP collaboration. You can tell they're determined to make a big impact.\"\"...You can also tell they really have money, definitely received new capital investment,\" Zheng Baozhu added.The two of them whispered while the fashion show was coming to an end, and finally, the eagerly awaited brand spokesperson appeared.\"It's Lin Ziqin, it's Lin Ziqin!\" Meng Yaxin grabbed Zheng Baozhu's hand and shook it excitedly, \"We're making big money today!\"When Lin Ziqin appeared on the runway wearing the latest spring and summer men's collection, the whole venue erupted in cheers, especially from the live-streaming internet celebrities who pointed their phones at him. Lin Ziqin wasn't a professional model, but his tall and slim figure and outstanding temperament made him shine on the stage effortlessly.\"Lin Ziqin's modern outfits look so good too! Whoever said he could only play ancient roles can eat their words!\" Meng Yaxin remarked. As Lin Ziqin walked a simple circle on the stage, he received another round of cheers.The flashes of cameras never stopped and the host had a hard time stabilizing the atmosphere. She managed to conduct a brief interview with Lin Ziqin. Because he had to rush back to the drama set for filming, he stayed only for about fifteen minutes, but even when he left, many people followed him.Zheng Baozhu glanced at Lin Ziqin, who was surrounded by the crowd, and said to Meng Yaxin next to her, \"I'm going to the restroom.\"\"Go ahead,\" Meng Yaxin was still staring in the direction Lin Ziqin left, not even sparing a glance for Zheng Baozhu. Zheng Baozhu tugged at her corner and left on her own.After so many years, Meng Yaxin hadn't changed a bit. She was still the same Meng Yaxin who preferred not to go to the restroom with her just to see a man.Perhaps because everyone went to see Lin Ziqin, surprisingly, there weren't many people in the restroom. While Zheng Baozhu was touching up her makeup in front of the mirror, someone else walked in. She glanced over at the mirror and saw a tall and slim figure\u2014a model who had just walked on the runway.Zheng Baozhu only glanced at him briefly before refocusing on her makeup. However, the person stopped when he reached her and stared at Zheng Baozhu for a while before uncertainly asking, \"Are you Zheng Baozhu?\"With her hand holding the lipstick pausing slightly, Zheng Baozhu twisted the lipstick back in and put it back in her purse. She looked at the person from the side and said, \"Do you know me?\"Hearing this, the person smiled and said, \"Is it really you? I'm Miao Siyu. I used to be in Class Nine, right next to your class.\"Zheng Baozhu looked at the face in front of her and carefully recalled, \"Miao Siyu?\"Seemingly uncertain if she was recognized, Miao Siyu appeared a bit embarrassed, \"You might not remember me. After all, I was quite inconspicuous during our school days.\"\"Oh, no, it's not that. I'm not very good at remembering people,\" Zheng Baozhu said. Suddenly, she remembered something, \"Ah, I recall now. I heard some students in our class mention you, saying something about you and Qu Zhi...\"Zheng Baozhu paused at this point. In her memory, she heard Miao Siyu's name mentioned by some classmates, saying that she had a crush on Qu Zhi and even walked home together with him after school.She hadn't paid much attention to such things back then, but mentioning it in front of the person involved still felt a bit awkward.Thankfully, she managed to stop in time.Apologizing with a smile, Zheng Baozhu was about to change the subject when Miao Siyu spoke up, \"Actually, everyone misunderstood that situation. Qu Zhi saw me crying that day, so he came up to comfort me. Unexpectedly, it got blown out of proportion.\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback. During their school days, many girls liked Qu Zhi, so scenarios of confessions and rejections were frequent. She didn't really care about Qu Zhi's matters, but hearing that he went to comfort someone was indeed a first.Seeing that Zheng Baozhu seemed a bit confused, Miao Siyu smiled gently and continued, \"In fact, I have a visual impairment. Because I can't distinguish things, I was often teased by my classmates. I cried that day because of this reason, and Qu Zhi came to comfort me, giving me a lot of courage. I've always been grateful to him.\"As Miao Siyu finished speaking, Zheng Baozhu began to recall. It seemed that she had indeed heard classmates mention that there was a visually impaired student in the neighboring class. So, this person was Miao Siyu?\"I never expected to meet you here. You're still as beautiful as you were during our school days,\" Miao Siyu said. Zheng Baozhu regained her composure and smiled, saying, \"Where did you get that from? You are the beautiful one here. You're a model now, that's amazing!\"Miao Siyu blushed slightly and replied, \"I have to thank Qu Zhi and also thank you.\"Zheng Baozhu was a bit puzzled, \"Thank me?\"Miao Siyu didn't elaborate further, saying, \"It doesn't matter. Let's not bring up the past. We've all become better now, and that's enough.\"Zheng Baozhu didn't press any further, but she couldn't help feeling curious. After chatting for a few more moments, she added Miao Siyu on WeChat and didn't delay any longer.When she returned to the show, most of the people had already left. Meng Yaxin was waiting there and walked up to her, \"Why were you gone for so long? I thought you fell into the restroom or something.\"\"...I just bumped into someone,\" Zheng Baozhu said and then asked Meng Yaxin, \"Do you remember a student named Miao Siyu from our high school days?\"\"Remember her?\" Meng Yaxin nodded, \"She had a visual impairment, right? She became quite famous for that, and oh, there were also rumors about her and Qu Zhi.\"Looking at Zheng Baozhu, she asked, \"Why did you suddenly bring her up?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"Oh, I met her in the restroom. She was one of the models in the fashion show.\"\"What?\" Meng Yaxin was very surprised, and her face showed it. \"That's impressive! Which one was she? I completely didn't recognize her.\"\"Me neither. Her makeup was quite heavy.\"\"Yeah, but now that I think about it, she was already quite tall during our school days. No wonder she can be a model,\" Meng Yaxin said, getting a bit excited, \"Where is she now? I want to take a look too.\"\"She's probably backstage. She must be busy, so you shouldn't disturb her.\"\"Oh... then let's go to the farm. I want to check on my vegetables!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She accompanied Meng Yaxin at the Starlight Farm, taking care of the vegetables for a while before returning to the hotel before it got dark. Meng Yaxin had originally wanted to go out again, but Zheng Baozhu's mind was still on Miao Siyu, so she didn't go.When they arrived at their room's door, Zheng Baozhu glanced at Qu Zhi's door. It was the last day of the year, was Qu Zhi working overtime or out celebrating?Standing at the door, she stared at Qu Zhi's door for a while, then walked over and raised her hand to knock.There was no response from inside the room for a moment, so Zheng Baozhu pressed the doorbell. \"Qu Zhi, are you in?\"Soon, she heard faint footsteps coming from inside the room. Zheng Baozhu stood outside until the door opened from the inside.Qu Zhi was dressed in navy-blue sleepwear, supporting himself with one hand on the doorknob. He looked somewhat surprised, \"Zheng Baozhu? Do you need something?\"Zheng Baozhu felt a bit uneasy as she pursed her lips and nodded slightly. \"I have something I want to ask you.\"Qu Zhi's gaze scanned her face for a moment, then he slightly opened the door to make way, \"Come in, let's talk.\"\"Alright,\" Zheng Baozhu held her bag and walked into the room.After closing the door, Qu Zhi casually picked up his outer coat from the sofa and put it on. Seeing his gesture, Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but quip, \"What's with that? Are you afraid I'll have some ulterior motives toward you?\"Now that she entered his room, if there was anything to worry about, it should be that big worry!\"...\" Qu Zhi remained silent and pursed his lips before saying, \"No, I just felt a bit cold.\"\"Hmph,\" Zheng Baozhu coldly snorted and didn't bother to argue with him. She walked over to the sofa, sat down, and placed her bag aside. Qu Zhi took a seat on the sofa opposite her and couldn't help but glance at her, asking, \"Did you just come back from outside?\"\"Yes, I went to see a fashion show and even saw Lin Ziqin.\"\"Oh,\" Qu Zhi smiled, \"So, what do you need from me?\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him but remained silent for a moment. Qu Zhi's expression started to look uneasy...Fortunately, Zheng Baozhu finally spoke, \"Do you remember a classmate from our high school days, Miao Siyu?\"Zheng Baozhu keenly noticed that after mentioning the name \"Miao Siyu\", Qu Zhi's expression changed.Oh, perhaps the rumors back then were not as simple as just rumors? Qu Zhi seems to remember her quite clearly.Qu Zhi fell silent for a moment before raising his gaze to look at Zheng Baozhu, \"I remember. Why are you suddenly asking about this?\"\"I just went to see the fashion show. She's a model now, and she was in that show,\" Zheng Baozhu explained.Qu Zhi seemed somewhat surprised; his expression didn't look like pretense, \"She's a model now?\"\"Yes.\" Zheng Baozhu scrutinized him and asked, \"You didn't know?\"\"I didn't,\" Qu Zhi said, \"I haven't been in contact with her for so many years.\"\"Oh? You don't have any contact with her, yet you remember her so clearly? So, you're the silent type, huh?\" Zheng Baozhu said teasingly.Qu Zhi: \"...\"He fell silent for a moment, not offering any defense, but instead asked, \"What did you talk about?\"\"Not much, just some casual conversation, but she said something strange,\" Zheng Baozhu looked at Qu Zhi and continued, \"She said she owes you gratitude for becoming a model and also thanked me.\"Zheng Baozhu still couldn't understand this point, \"I can understand why she thanked you since she mentioned that you comforted her when she was crying that day, giving her courage. But why would she thank me? Before and after we were separated into different classes, and I don't really remember much about her. Yet, it seems she recognizes me, like in the restroom today, she recognized me at first glance. Am I really that outstanding?\"Thinking about it, Teacher Zhang recognized her at first glance too, and today Miao Siyu also did the same. It seems she indeed leaves a lasting impression on people.Qu Zhi listened to her and, surprisingly, didn't respond with his usual annoyance. Instead, his eyes deepened slightly. He lightly pressed his lips together and remained silent for a while before looking at Zheng Baozhu, asking, \"You really don't remember anything?\"Zheng Baozhu's heart skipped a beat at his question, \"What do you mean?\"Qu Zhi asked, \"Did she tell you why she was crying back then?\"Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"She said she heard some classmates making fun of her.\"Qu Zhi looked at her, his jaw slightly clenched, and said, \"You were one of those classmates.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was Friday, and after the last activity class, everyone was preparing to leave for home. Qu Zhi attended a class on robotics development and future trends, and because the discussion was quite intense today, he left the classroom later than usual. When he returned to the classroom, he noticed that Zheng Baozhu was still there, sitting at her desk and packing her bag while chatting with two classmates about outfit combinations.Zheng Baozhu was taking a fashion design course. Qu Zhi didn't have a particular interest in designing beautiful clothes; he just liked beautiful clothes. He didn't engage in conversation with them and started packing his things at his own desk. Zheng Baozhu didn't pay attention to him either, continuing to chat and laugh with her classmates, \"Red with blue? It depends on what shade of red and blue we are talking about.\"\"Let's use the same shade of blue as our school uniform and pair it with the shade of red from the Disability High School uniform!\"After finishing packing his things, Qu Zhi turned around and saw a student from another class standing by the back door. Coincidentally, she was wearing the Disability High School uniform\u00a0paired with their own school uniform.Qu Zhi paused for a moment, and the student looked up at him, then ran off amidst laughter. Qu Zhi furrowed his brows slightly, turned back, and said to the people in the classroom, \"Are you all bored?\"Zheng Baozhu looked back at him and then snickered, \"What's so boring about pairing outfits? I find robotics boring, heh.\"Qu Zhi pursed his lips, said nothing, and then left. He remembered who that student was just now; it was Miao Siyu from the neighboring class. He had heard this name from other classmates and the only reason they knew about it was that she had a visual impairment.In the eyes of these unenlightened classmates, a visual impairment seemed like something novel, so when someone discovered that Miao Siyu couldn't recognize them, the news spread throughout the grade.Qu Zhi had thought that only elementary school students could be so boring, but it seemed that high school students weren't much better.He walked to the neighboring class's door and saw Miao Siyu talking to a male classmate, \"Where's my uniform?\"The male student being questioned had a nonchalant expression and even appeared somewhat pleased, \"Here it is!\" He handed Miao Siyu her uniform coat and couldn't help but tease, \"So, you really couldn't recognize anyone? You can't even recognize words, right? Hahaha.\"Miao Siyu pursed her lips and angrily threw the coat she was wearing on the ground, snatched her uniform back from the male student, and ran away.The high school Qu Zhi attended didn't enforce a school uniform policy, but Miao Siyu always wore the school uniform to school. Everyone wasn't oblivious; they understood that she always wore the uniform to avoid the hassle of coordinating outfits, as wearing a uniform was safe and wouldn't go wrong. The Disability High School uniform was almost identical to theirs, so someone came up with the idea to have some fun with it by wearing it on top of their own uniform.\"Don't you think you've gone too far?\" Qu Zhi stood at the classroom door, looking at the male student.\"What's it to you? I'm just having a laugh with my classmates,\" the male student retorted. He recognized Qu Zhi; after all, he was the top student in the grade and handsome too. But that didn't mean the male student would back down in front of him.\"Joking about someone else's flaws, do you really find that amusing?\"Finally, the male student showed some embarrassment, \"What's it to you? Just because you're the top student, you want to control everything?\"Qu Zhi didn't bother with him any further and walked towards the direction where Miao Siyu had run off to. There were not many people left in the school at this moment. Qu Zhi walked down the stairs and saw Miao Siyu sitting on the stairs, holding her uniform and crying.Hearing footsteps, Miao Siyu wiped her tears. Qu Zhi approached her and handed her a pack of tissues. Miao Siyu hesitated for a moment, then looked up at him. Qu Zhi slightly averted his gaze, placing the tissues on her uniform.\"Thank you,\" after a while, Miao Siyu opened the tissue pack and said thanks, \"You saw everything just now, right?\"\"Yeah,\" Qu Zhi replied softly, \"They were in the wrong.\"Miao Siyu held the tissues, and chuckled self-deprecatingly, \"I'm used to it, actually. In the past, some classmates would hold up colored M&M chocolates, saying red ones tasted the best, and they would ask me to choose the red ones. Then, when I picked the wrong color, they would be so happy. I just didn't expect high school students to be this boring too.\"\"Yeah,\" Qu Zhi responded again, \"So you don't need to take it to heart.\"\"I know...\" Miao Siyu said, her voice choked with emotion, \"But sometimes, I just can't help feeling wronged,\" She wiped her tears with the tissues, composed herself, and continued, \"I don't want to be visually impaired either. I know everyone thinks I'm uncool, but I can't help it. I also want to wear beautiful clothes, but I can't even distinguish colors...\"When Miao Siyu said this, she looked up at Qu Zhi and asked, \"Is the blue and red combination really that ugly?\"Qu Zhi fell silent for a moment, \"If the saturation is too high, it can indeed be glaring.\"\"Oh...\" Miao Siyu nodded gently, hugging her knees, \"That's what Zheng Baozhu said too... Actually, I've always envied Zheng Baozhu in your class.\"Hearing Zheng Baozhu's name, Qu Zhi's eyebrows twitched slightly, \"Envied? For what?\"\"She's beautiful, knows how to dress up, and everyone likes her.\"Qu Zhi remained silent for a moment before speaking, \"I actually think it's not very meaningful. Attractive appearances may temporarily please people, but in the end, what really matters is character.\"Miao Siyu smiled as she listened to him, \"It's not very convincing when it comes from someone who is good-looking like you.\"\"...\" Qu Zhi was taken aback, \"I truly believe that. I think character is more important than appearances.\"Miao Siyu stood up with her uniform in her arms and said, \"Thank you for comforting me. I feel much better now,\" She smiled and continued, \"Back in elementary school, I told myself not to cry over such things anymore. I didn't expect that even in high school, I haven't made much progress.\"Qu Zhi didn't say anything. Comforting others was never his strong suit. Today, he had already gone beyond what was normal by talking to Miao Siyu about all this.\"Let's go then,\" Miao Siyu put on her uniform and walked downstairs with Qu Zhi.After hearing the story, Zheng Baozhu was silent for a full thirty seconds. \"What are you talking about? Is this something you just made up now??? Why don't I have any recollection of it???\"\"...Maybe you said it casually back then and didn't take it to heart,\" Qu Zhi replied.Previously, he had always thought that Zheng Baozhu said it on purpose, but after meeting her again, he gradually realized that Zheng Baozhu was different from what he had assumed\u2014she wasn't that harsh of a person.\"What do you mean?\" Zheng Baozhu asked.Qu Zhi explained, \"What I mean is, back then we were only in our first year of high school, you were just fourteen years old. You probably didn't think it was a big deal, and there was no ill intent.\"This was the reason Qu Zhi had come up with recently to justify Zheng Baozhu's actions at that time.However, Zheng Baozhu didn't seem pleased with his explanation; instead, she became even angrier, \"So, you still think I was in cahoots with them, don't you? Hmph, even if I was only fourteen, I wouldn't do something like teasing classmates!\"Qu Zhi remained silent.\"And another thing, what do you mean by saying that appearances can only temporarily please people and it ultimately depends on the character? Are you saying my character is bad? You're implying that I'm not likable, aren't you?\" Zheng Baozhu's face turned red with anger, \"I won't stand for this injustice! You better explain yourself!\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"He sat on the sofa somewhat nervously, carefully choosing his words, \"I didn't say that. I just feel that even though you know how to dress up and understand fashion and beauty, you lack the most basic respect.\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu's fists were clenched, and she looked at Qu Zhi with a cold smile, \"Respect, huh? It's because I respected you too much that you're still alive today!\"\"...\" Qu Zhi remained silent.Zheng Baozhu couldn't sit still now; she paced back and forth in the room. She hadn't expected to be blamed like this on the last day of the year! This blame must not carry over to the next year!\"I remember now!\" Zheng Baozhu suddenly stopped her pacing, turned her head to look at Qu Zhi, and said, \"That day wasn't like that at all!\"Zheng Baozhu remembered that the main topic of the design class that day was fashion matching. After she presented her design from the previous class and received praise from the teacher, her spirits were high.Maybe it was because the teacher specifically praised her, so after class, some classmates approached her and wanted to discuss fashion matching.Zheng Baozhu had always been good at talking, and she was in a good mood that day, so she chatted with her classmates for quite a while, not paying attention to the time.She didn't notice when Qu Zhi entered the classroom.\"Baozhu, which two combinations do you think look the worst?\" one of her classmates asked.Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and replied, \"Actually, I don't think there's anything inherently ugly. It depends on how you match them. For example, many people say that red and green look tacky together, but these two colors can still be matched in a sophisticated way.\"\"Yeah, you're right,\" the classmate nodded, then asked with excitement, \"What about red and blue?\"\"Red and blue? It still depends on the specific shades of red and blue,\" Zheng Baozhu replied.\"It's the blue from our school uniform matched with the red from Disability High School uniform!\" The classmate became more and more enthusiastic as she spoke.Zheng Baozhu didn't know what the excitement was about, but hearing the combination of these two colors had a huge impact on her. She had seen their school uniform blue and Disability High School uniform red!She couldn't believe it and said, \"Ah... that's too extreme. Both of these colors have such high saturation; who would pair them like that? It's not even about whether it looks good or not; it would hurt your eyes!\"\"Exactly, hahaha! It's like those official notices with blue background and red text, hahaha, so ugly!\"\"Are you guys bored?\" Qu Zhi's voice suddenly echoed in the classroom. Zheng Baozhu was taken aback and turned to look in the direction of the voice.Qu Zhi stood in front of his desk, carrying his bag, with a slightly furrowed brow and a hint of anger.Zheng Baozhu frowned, not sure what Qu Zhi was up to again. He always found fault with things for no reason. Now, even when everyone was just discussing fashion matching, he couldn't stand it?With a sneer, she looked at him and said, \"What's so boring about discussing fashion matching? I find robotics boring, haha.\"She disliked his pretentious demeanor, as if only his actions had meaning in the world, and what others did was useless.Qu Zhi didn't say anything, picked up his bag, and left. Zheng Baozhu rolled her eyes and told the two classmates, \"Don't mind him, let's continue our discussion.\"\"Ah, okay.\"Whether it was Qu Zhi's sudden outburst or not, the enthusiasm of the classmates seemed to have diminished. Zheng Baozhu chatted with them for a while and then tidied up her things and left the classroom.After hearing Zheng Baozhu's version of the story, Qu Zhi also fell silent for half a minute, \"So, you genuinely didn't know that Miao Siyu was at the door?\"\"Oh my goodness, how would I know?\" Zheng Baozhu looked at Qu Zhi and asked, \"Do I have eyes on the back of my head or something?\"Qu Zhi remained silent.Given Zheng Baozhu's seating position at the time, it was entirely possible that she didn't see anyone at the back door.\"They must have suddenly noticed Miao Siyu passing by the back door dressed like that and deliberately asked you about it,\" Zheng Baozhu scoffed, \"I'm so angry! They used me as a pawn! I actually earnestly talked to them about fashion matching!\"Qu Zhi slightly straightened his back but didn't speak. Zheng Baozhu looked at him and redirected her frustration toward him, \"You are also strange. Since you saw it all, why didn't you just say it directly? You've been silently cursing me for so many years, couldn't you just ask me directly?\"\"...I haven't been silently cursing you for so many years,\" Qu Zhi replied.\"Heh, do you think I'd believe that?\"\"...\"After a moment of silence, Zheng Baozhu's emotions gradually eased. \"No, I have to go and explain to Miao Siyu. Luckily, I saved her WeChat today.\"Qu Zhi asked, \"Will she believe you?\"\"It doesn't matter if she believes it or not; as long as I clarify things for myself,\" Zheng Baozhu sat back on the sofa, took out her phone, and started typing a message. Qu Zhi sat beside her, looking down, and suddenly remembered something, \"By the way, while we're at it today, there's something I want to ask you about.\"Zheng Baozhu kept her eyes on her phone without lifting her head, \"What is it?\"Qu Zhi said, \"You told Qi Sheng before that I did something bad. I just wanted to ask, what bad thing did I do?\"Zheng Baozhu's fingertips paused and she looked up at him.After looking at Qu Zhi for a moment, she temporarily put down her phone, \"Don't you know it yourself?\"Qu Zhi couldn't help but laugh out of frustration, \"I really don't know. Why don't you tell me?\"\"Sure,\" Zheng Baozhu smiled at him. Thinking about this incident now, she found it amusing, \"Back in our second year of junior high, do you remember New He Street?\"Qu Zhi furrowed his brow slightly. New He Street was a small alley near their home, and it had been rebuilt and widened into a bustling street now, with tall buildings on both sides. There was no trace of the dirty and shabby alley it used to be.Zheng Baozhu observed his expression and hummed lightly, \"How about it? Does it ring a bell?\"Qu Zhi looked at her and didn't speak for a moment. Zheng Baozhu thought they had talked openly about everything today, so she honestly said, \"Back then, you were there. You pressed a student to the ground and beat him up, and I saw it happen.\"Qu Zhi's expression didn't change much, as if he wasn't particularly surprised. After a moment of silence, he looked at Zheng Baozhu and said, \"So, that's how you remember it?\"Zheng Baozhu became even more determined, \"How else should I remember it? You just admitted it!\"Qu Zhi replied, \"There was indeed such an incident, but it's not how you think it was.\"\"Don't care what I think! You admitted it, that's enough!\" Zheng Baozhu picked up her phone again and even turned on the voice recording function, \"Come on, say it again. You admit that during our second year of junior high, you pressed a male student to the ground and beat him up on New He Street.\"\"...\"\"Why are you silent now?\" Zheng Baozhu stared at him as if she had a deep-seated grudge to settle.Qu Zhi asked, \"I'm curious, is this incident so important to you?\"\"Of course!\" Zheng Baozhu said indignantly, \"After witnessing that scene back then, I went home and told my mom!\"In her mother's eyes, Qu Zhi had always been a smart, well-behaved, and ambitious child, and she had no idea about his true nature in private. Zheng Baozhu had been agonized by her mother being deceived by Qu Zhi's facade but couldn't find any flaws in him until that day when she saw him beating someone up.After returning home, she passionately told her mother about the incident.\"But my mother didn't believe me at first!\" Zheng Baozhu recalled, still feeling frustrated from back then, \"She said I must have mistaken the person. I regret not having a phone or internet back then; otherwise, I would have recorded it and made it go viral online.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"\"I wasn't willing to give up, so after starting school, I told the teacher about the incident, hoping the teacher would do justice for me,\" Zheng Baozhu's face was turning red again as she spoke, \"But even the teacher didn't believe me. They all thought I was lying! I swear, the biggest lie I've ever told in my life was 'I can handle spicy food!'\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zheng Baozhu, on the other hand, sat aside feeling upset, only understanding now how deeply cunning Qu Zhi could be!Since elementary school, Qu Zhi had excelled in his studies, leaving a lofty impression on others. He even crafted an image of himself as a scientist, always advocating for the country. Who would believe that such a smart, ambitious, and good classmate would be beating someone up in a small alley?Even Yue Buqun would feel inferior if he saw him!1Zheng Baozhu picked up an unopened bottle of mineral water from the table and twisted it open. She then drank almost half of it in one go.\"...\" Qu Zhi sat quietly beside her, watching her drink water like that.When Zheng Baozhu had nearly finished drinking, she put down the bottle and looked at Qu Zhi, \"So, you were well ahead of time. At that time, the entertainment industry wasn't even creating personas yet.\"\"...\" Qu Zhi pursed his lips. \"Someone said earlier, 'since you saw it with your own eyes, why didn't you just ask me directly? You spent so many years silently cursing me in your heart, couldn't you have asked me directly'?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Wow, how the tables had turned.\"I didn't see any need to ask you. I saw you beating someone with my own eyes, but my mom and the teacher didn't believe me. If I asked you, would you have admitted it?\" Zheng Baozhu snorted coldly.Qu Zhi slightly pursed his lips. He also picked up a bottle of mineral water from the table, twisted it open, and took a sip, \"This incident did happen.\"Zheng Baozhu sneered, \"Alright, let me hear your well-crafted story.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"He still remembered that day. The weather wasn't great, his parents were both at the research institute and hadn't come back. He was alone at home for the weekend. Although Aunt Su had said he could always go to their house for meals, he didn't want to bother Aunt Su since he had a strained relationship with Zheng Baozhu.When he was in elementary school, he was too young to cook for himself and had to rely on Aunt Su's hospitality. But in junior high, he knew how to cook for himself, so when he felt lazy, he would just find something to eat downstairs.New He Street was not far from where they lived and there was a place there that served delicious braised dishes. Qu Zhi was cooking rice in the pot and had some money in his pocket to buy some braised dishes to go with it.Shortly after he entered the alley, he heard some commotion up ahead. When he looked from a distance, he saw a male student taunting an auntie. The auntie seemed unable to see and was crawling on the ground, searching for something in a miserable state. The boy was holding a plastic bag, laughing and teasing her.Qu Zhi quickly approached and handed the blind woman her cane that had fallen aside. The boy, displeased by his interference, questioned him, \"What are you doing? Who asked you to pick that up?\"Qu Zhi turned to look at him. The other person appeared to be around the same age as him, but he was much more muscular, probably twice his size.\"I can pick it up if I want to, do I need your approval?\"The boy became even more defiant and tried to snatch the blind person's cane from Qu Zhi's hands, saying, \"You're so nosy, will you compensate me for the cake money?\"Not far from them, there was a cake that had been knocked over and ruined, mixed with dirt and oil on the ground, making it look very unpleasant.Qu Zhi had come down just to buy some pickled vegetables and hadn't brought much money. He took out all the money he had and exchanged it for the boy's contemptuous sneer, \"Just this little? Do you know how expensive my cake was? Poor guy, don't try to act like a righteous hero!\"Saying that, the boy tried to snatch the blind person's cane again and the two of them quickly started struggling. Since the other boy was much larger than him, Qu Zhi had to exert all his strength to subdue him and pin him down.However, he never expected that this scene was witnessed by Zheng Baozhu, who happened to pass by.\"That's the story. Auntie Xiao lived on New Grain Street. I met her shortly after she was discharged from the hospital. She lost her eyesight in a car accident and hadn't adapted to the life of being blind yet. When she was buying things, she accidentally bumped into that boy and ruined his cake.\"Zheng Baozhu frowned, \"Even so, there's no need to be so unreasonable. He wasn't intentional. Couldn't you just compensate him for the money?\"Qu Zhi sneered, \"He didn't really want the money. He just seized the opportunity to bully the weak.\"Zheng Baozhu pondered for a moment and suddenly realized, \"Wait, what you said is just your side of the story. How do we know if it's true?\"Qu Zhi snorted lightly and said, \"Tomorrow, I'll take you to meet Auntie Xiao. It also happens to be that I have something to give her too.\"Zheng Baozhu carefully scrutinized him, \"You better not hire an actor to deceive me. I'm a professional now, I can tell at a glance.\"Qu Zhi replied, \"You'll see for yourself tomorrow, then you'll know.\"\"Alright, let's see,\" Zheng Baozhu agreed. She then glanced at Qu Zhi, a bit curious, and asked, \"Is your decision to make a guide robot related to this Auntie Xiao?\"In Qu Zhi's story, this Auntie Xiao was a blind person, which coincided with Qu Zhi's expertise in guiding robots.Qu Zhi said, \"Not entirely. I want to help countless people like Auntie Xiao.\"\"Oh...\"\"Actually, I was hesitating about what research direction to choose in the future. After this incident, I realized that I don't have to follow in my parents' footsteps and focus solely on powerful matters to have meaningful research. Caring about some small things and the masses in everyday life, contributing to them is also meaningful.\"\"...\"Although Qu Zhi's words sounded very serious, Zheng Baozhu had heard similar things from him countless times since they were young, but she couldn't help but ask, \"No, you were just in the second year of junior high at that time and you were already contemplating your future research direction?\"Qu Zhi remained silent for a moment and replied, \"Yes, it was indeed a bit late.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Looking at Zheng Baozhu's expression, Qu Zhi couldn't help but chuckle.\"Why are you laughing?\" Zheng Baozhu glared at him.Qu Zhi grinned slightly and asked, \"So, when you saw me getting into a fight with someone, you didn't come to help me, but thought of going home to complain?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu shrugged, \"If you dare to fight, handle it yourself. Why would you expect a girl to help you? Not calling the police to arrest you was already helping you.\"\"Oh, thank you for sparing me then.\"\"You're welcome,\" Zheng Baozhu took another sip from the water bottle and said with some disdain, \"Why do you only have mineral water here? Don't you have any other drinks or tea?\"\"Drinking those is unhealthy.\"\"Who drinks those for the sake of being healthy?\"\"...\"Qu Zhi said, \"Next time, I'll have some in my room.\"After he said this, Zheng Baozhu suddenly felt a bit embarrassed, \"Who cares about next time? It's not like I'm coming to visit you.\"As they were talking, fireworks suddenly started outside. Zheng Baozhu was taken aback and quickly ran to the stage to watch the fireworks, \"Fireworks! It's almost the New Year!\"\"Mm,\" Qu Zhi also walked over, placing his hands on the railing of the stage and looking up at the fireworks blooming in the night sky.\"Wow, these are so beautiful,\" Zheng Baozhu took out his phone and started taking videos and photos of the fireworks. Qu Zhi looked at her, and the colorful fireworks intermittently illuminated her face, making it appear somewhat unreal.Just like all these years, it seemed that he had never truly understood or known her.\"Zheng Baozhu,\" He called out, but Zheng Baozhu was busy capturing the fireworks and only responded with a casual \"Mm\".Qu Zhi continued to look at him, his eyes also flickering intermittently, \"We've known each other for almost twenty years, except for the nine years we were apart, there have been ten years of time together. I've always believed that I knew you well, but in reality, I didn't. Over these years, I did misunderstand you and held biases against you. Here, I want to apologize to you.\"Zheng Baozhu paused, raising her head to look at Qu Zhi with some surprise. What was this situation? Qu Zhi was actually apologizing? Was this some kind of New Year's prank?The countdown for the New Year started outside. The moment the New Year's bell rang, Qu Zhi extended his hand to Zheng Baozhu, \"Happy New Year, Zheng Baozhu. In the coming year, I look forward to getting to know a better version of you.\"Zheng Baozhu looked at his slender and straight fingers and playfully tapped his palm, \"We're even now, both of us have misunderstood each other.\"After leaving Qu Zhi's room, Zheng Baozhu still felt a slight warmth in her palm. She sat on the sofa for a while, then suddenly remembered that she needed to explain to Miao Siyu, so she took out her phone.After several revisions, she finally sent the edited message.Zheng Baozhu: Hello, Miao Siyu, I am Zheng Baozhu. After going back, I asked Qu Zhi about what happened in the past. I don't know if you'll believe my explanation, but I genuinely didn't know you were behind that day. We were discussing color combinations in class, and that's why the topic came up. I thought those classmates were genuinely talking about color matching and had no idea it was about you. However, I still want to apologize because I unintentionally hurt you.Zheng Baozhu: Also, don't mind what others say. You are outstanding and shining brightly ^_^After sending the message, Zheng Baozhu noticed that Miao Siyu's status changed to \"Typing...\". It seemed that she was also revising her response. After a while, she finally sent a message.Miao Siyu: Hello, Zheng Baozhu, there's no need for you to apologize, you're right. High saturation blue with red does look a bit glaring. I often see netizens complaining about it under Blue V's Weibo posts [haha]. Actually, that day, a male classmate in our class intentionally swapped my school uniform. When I walked to your class's door and overheard your conversation, I unconsciously looked at my uniform. When I saw the name of our school embroidered on it, I understood what had happened. It wasn't your fault.Miao Siyu: Today, when I thanked you, it wasn't sarcastic. In fact, when I was studying, I admired you a lot. I wished I could be as beautiful, fashionable, and likable as you. Now, I have achieved that. Although I still can't distinguish colors, I wear the most fashionable clothes and stand on the most fashionable stage, attracting everyone's attention. I think I managed to persevere because I've always wanted to be like someone like you.After reading the message, Zheng Baozhu felt moved: You don't have to be for me, you are already the most beautiful!Miao Siyu: Thank you ^_^The two didn't exchange further words; it seemed unnecessary. Zheng Baozhu scrolled through her friends' posts on WeChat Moments and saw Miao Siyu's latest update.Miao Siyu: Everything that didn't kill me has made me stronger. [Picture]The picture she posted was from today's runway show, resembling a butterfly breaking free from its cocoon.Zheng Baozhu gave her post a like.After a while, she saw Miao Siyu commenting below her own post: A high school classmate told me this phrase; it has been encouraging me until today. ^_^Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow slightly, took a screenshot of the WeChat Moments post, and sent it to Qu Zhi: Is this classmate you? Should I introduce her to you again, maybe you two can rekindle your old connection.Qu Zhi: ...No need, thanks.Qu Zhi: There wasn't much of a connection, to begin with, and the way things are now is just fine.Zheng Baozhu: Oh, such a cold-hearted guy.Qu Zhi: \"...\"While Zheng Baozhu was chatting with Qu Zhi, Meng Yaxin video-called her. Zheng Baozhu pressed the call button and saw Meng Yaxin's face on the screen. She was still outside celebrating and the background looked lively.\"Mm,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded lightly, \"Another year where you've witnessed failure.\"\"...I won't fail next year, I promise!\" Meng Yaxin wrinkled her nose, \"Besides, why are you criticizing me when you're a lonely soul? You spend every New Year alone, it looks pitiful!\"\"Heh,\" Zheng Baozhu chuckled coldly, \"Who said I'm alone? I just came back from Qu Zhi's room.\"\"???\" Even without text, Zheng Baozhu could see the question marks on Meng Yaxin's face, \"What's going on between you two? Are you already friends who celebrate New Year's together?\"Zheng Baozhu considered and replied, \"Today, I bumped into Miao Siyu at the event, and because she said something about an incident, I went to ask Qu Zhi about it.\"\"What did she say?\" Meng Yaxin asked curiously.Zheng Baozhu said, \"It's nothing much, but after talking with Qu Zhi, I realized how many misunderstandings we've had all these years.\"\"What? You're only realizing now that you've misunderstood each other!\" Meng Yaxin exaggeratedly expressed surprise, \"Whenever I asked you before, you always insisted that there were no misunderstandings and that Qu Zhi was just that kind of person!\"\"Well...\" Zheng Baozhu scratched her head, \"Since third grade in elementary school, Qu Zhi tattled about me in front of my mom, claiming that I wanted to become a celebrity, so I started hating him. After that, I targeted him. You see, Qu Zhi Jian may seem pleasant and friendly on the surface, but he actually holds grudges like no other! Over the years, he must have noted down all the grievances he had against me in his little notebook, just waiting for the right opportunity to retaliate. From that moment on, it was destined that we wouldn't objectively look at each other anymore, right?\"Meng Yaxin reassured, \"Ah, it's not a big deal. That's how people are with each other. Just because you've known each other for a long time doesn't mean you truly understand each other.\"To emphasize her point, she gave an example, \"Look at Cen Tongtong, she's known you and Qu Zhi since you were kids, so you've known each other for a while, right? She thinks she understands you both well, that's why she dares to make bold statements, saying that the two of you could never be together. But it's only when pigs fly that she'll realize how wrong she is!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the past, when it was busy, Zheng Baozhu would stay at the hotel to take care of things. But today, she went out early with Qu Zhi.Qu Zhi said he wanted to take her to meet Auntie Xiao, so of course, they had to go see her. Xiao Yu saw them leave together in the morning and immediately sent a message to the group.Xiao Yu: Breaking news! Miss Baozhu and Mr. Qu are going out together! Looks like they're going on a date!Liang Huihui: Wow, they're starting the New Year by going out together!Liang Huihui: They just had breakfast together at the restaurant. I noticed that Qu Zhi always orders the same things as Miss Baozhu!Wei Zhen: From my observation, their tastes are very similar.Xiao Yu: As they say, 'if they eat together, they sleep together'!Meng Yaxin: ?? Is that a saying?Xiao Yu: Yes!Cen Tongtong woke up from a nap and found hundreds of chat messages in the group. She was startled and sat up in bed, completely awake.This was a group exclusively for shipping CP, where they could only talk about the CP. No other irrelevant chats were allowed. Today, everyone seemed so excited; it must be because Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi were being mischievous again!After skimming through the chat messages, her eyes were fixed on \"sleep together\".Oh my goodness! Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi are sleeping together???She quickly sent a string of question marks to Zheng Baozhu.By now, Zheng Baozhu was already with Qu Zhi at Auntie Xiao's place, so she didn't check her phone. Auntie Xiao no longer lived on New He Street, Qu Zhi brought her to an ordinary residential complex.Auntie Xiao lived on the sixth floor. Although the complex wasn't brand new, it had an elevator.\"Auntie Xiao, it's me, Qu Zhi,\" Qu Zhi knocked on the door and greeted the person inside. The door was quickly opened with Auntie Xiao standing on the other side, smiling in Qu Zhi's direction, \"Little Qu, you're here?\"\"Mm, and I brought a friend to see you.\"On cue, Zheng Baozhu stepped forward and greeted Auntie Xiao, \"Hello, Auntie Xiao, I'm Zheng Baozhu.\"As soon as Auntie Xiao heard a young voice, her conduct changed instantly, \"You're a friend of Little Qu, right? Come, come, have a seat.\"Auntie Xiao warmly invited them in, without giving them a chance to explain. The room was neatly arranged with a cozy atmosphere, and there weren't many things cluttering the floor, leaving as much space as possible. Auntie Xiao walked to the sofa and asked them to sit, \"Have a seat first; I'll get you some water.\"\"No need to trouble yourself, Auntie Xiao,\" Qu Zhi stopped her from getting water, guiding Zheng Baozhu to sit on the sofa, \"We came today to visit and also brought you this.\"Qu Zhi opened the box he had been holding and took out a smart white cane from it. \"This is the latest smart white cane developed by our company. It uses ultrasonic detection to simultaneously detect obstacles in front, on the left, on the right, and above. It then provides feedback through the handle's vibration. Additionally, it has a voice navigation system. After setting the destination, it can start guiding, and it also provides prompts for traffic lights. Moreover, I've added an emergency button. In case of an emergency, pressing the button will send your location to the nearest police station.\"\"Is it that amazing?\" Auntie Xiao slowly explored the smart cane Qu Zhi handed over, looking pleasantly surprised. Zheng Baozhu was also amazed. If Qu Zhi hadn't mentioned it today, she wouldn't have known that canes had advanced to this level.\"Its operation is not complicated; I'll teach you and you'll learn in no time.\"\"Alright.\"Qu Zhi turned on the smart cane and patiently taught Auntie Xiao how to use it. Although Auntie Xiao couldn't see with her eyes, she learned quickly, and after just one explanation from Qu Zhi, she grasped the basic usage, \"This is convenient to use. With this, going out will be even easier.\"Qu Zhi nodded and said to Auntie Xiao, \"When I first developed this smart cane, I hoped it could be a substitute for guide dogs.\"The number of guide dogs was limited as it was challenging to train and apply for them. The vast majority of visually impaired individuals still relied on walking canes.\"Technology has indeed advanced. When I first became blind, I used the most basic walking cane. Now, this small cane has so many functions. In the future, guide dogs might even be replaced,\" Auntie Xiao said with a smile to Qu Zhi.Qu Zhi replied, \"Things will only get better in the future.\"\"I believe that. With young people like you, we will definitely get better and better,\" Auntie Xiao spoke with a smile, showing her fondness for Qu Zhi, this young man.Qu Zhi chatted with Auntie Xiao for a while longer, but then the room's voice reporting the time rang. Feeling a bit embarrassed, Auntie Xiao said to Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu, \"I still need to go to work in the afternoon. You both came to see me and I didn't even treat you to a meal.\"\"It's okay, Auntie Xiao. I mainly came today to give you the smart cane,\" Qu Zhi didn't want to trouble her from the beginning, as Auntie Xiao's condition made things difficult for her, \"Actually, I wanted to come earlier, but I've been extremely busy lately and didn't find the time until now.\"\"Don't say that, Little Qu. You've already helped me a lot,\" Auntie Xiao stood up and tapped the smart cane again, \"This thing must be quite expensive, right?\"Qu Zhi said, \"It's alright. To make it more affordable for more people, I tried to control the cost.\"Auntie Xiao said, \"If I give you money, you definitely won't accept it. I have some specialties from my hometown here; you and Little Zheng can take them home and enjoy.\"\"No need, Auntie.\"\"Then you don't eat them; give them all to Little Zheng,\" Auntie Xiao said and grabbed Zheng Baozhu's hand, \"When I heard Little Zheng's voice, I knew she must be exceptionally beautiful. To have found such a good girlfriend, you must treat her well.\"Qu Zhi pursed his lips slightly, showing a hint of unease. Zheng Baozhu smiled at Auntie Xiao and said, \"Auntie Xiao, you misunderstood. Qu Zhi and I are old classmates, we're not dating.\"Auntie Xiao was taken aback, then turned her head towards Qu Zhi and said, \"So you haven't succeeded in pursuing her yet. You have to put in more effort, Little Qu!\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Since Auntie Xiao had to go to work in the afternoon, they didn't disturb her for too long. When they left, Auntie Xiao insisted on stuffing lots of specialties into Qu Zhi's hands and asked him to help Zheng Baozhu carry them back.After putting everything into the trunk, Zheng Baozhu curiously asked Qu Zhi, \"Where does Auntie Xiao work?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"She works at a nearby company as a telephone operator.\"\"Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, opened the car door, and got in. Qu Zhi followed and sat in the passenger seat, fastening his seatbelt. As Zheng Baozhu drove, she said to Qu Zhi, \"I can see that Auntie Xiao is still very active in her life, that's great.\"Qu Zhi said, \"Indeed, she has improved a lot. When I first met her, she couldn't accept the fact that she was blind. Moreover, her husband divorced her because of this, which was a double blow to her. Her emotions were very unstable at that time, and I was afraid she might not be able to handle it, but fortunately, she made it through.\"Hearing about Auntie Xiao's husband, Zheng Baozhu couldn't hold back, \"What kind of husband is he? The first thing he does after his wife becomes blind is to run away? Where's his responsibility? Men really aren't good people!\"\"...\"Qu Zhi fell silent for a moment, \"I agree that Auntie Xiao's husband isn't a good person, but he doesn't represent all men.\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"There's also that scumbag Li Yifan!\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"He coughed lightly, looking serious, and said to Zheng Baozhu, \"Though there are scumbags, there are still good men in this world.\"Zheng Baozhu sneered, \"Good men are like ghosts \u2013 everyone has heard of them, but no one has seen them.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"\"I think you have biases against men.\"Zheng Baozhu glanced at him, \"Oh, right, you are also a man, no wonder you've been defending men.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi pursed his lips and was amused by her teasing, \"Is it not obvious that I'm a man? Should I prove it to you?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu felt that the conversation was becoming a bit flirtatious and warned him while slightly shifting away, \"I'm driving, you better not distract me.\"Qu Zhi chuckled, and Zheng Baozhu quickly changed the topic, \"Have you been in contact with Auntie Xiao all these years?\"\"Yes, but due to my busy studies, we haven't contacted each other frequently.\"\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"Actually, I'm quite interested in this field. If you hadn't mentioned it today, I wouldn't have known that walking canes have become so advanced now.\"Talking about his expertise, Qu Zhi's attention shifted away from 'men': \"To replace guide dogs, scientists around the world started researching smart blind canes much earlier. The traditional blind canes can only detect obstacles in front of the road, but in fact, there may also be obstacles in the air. This makes it easy for blind people to bump their heads.\"Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment, realizing that it was indeed true.\"Later, electronic blind canes were invented, which expanded the range of detection and took the blind person's head into consideration. With the development of technology in recent years, smart blind canes have been continuously updated and iterated,\" Qu Zhi looked at the tall buildings outside the window as if he was looking at something beyond them, \"Technological development is never independent. Advancements in areas such as artificial satellites, the internet, and artificial intelligence have allowed blind canes to perform more and more functions.\"At a red light, Zheng Baozhu stopped the car and looked at Qu Zhi beside her. He had said similar things before, but at that time, she felt that he was just showing off. Today, she realized that when Qu Zhi spoke, he was serious, even devout.He genuinely wanted to improve people's lives through technology.He might genuinely care about the country.\"The light is green, why aren't you going?\" Qu Zhi turned to look at Zheng Baozhu. She quickly withdrew her gaze as if she had been caught doing something wrong and nonchalantly drove the car forward.Afraid that Qu Zhi would notice she was just looking at him, she cleverly followed his words and continued the conversation, \"It sounds impressive, but implementing a robot guide must be much more challenging, right? How does the robot recognize if someone is blind? How does it know who to serve?\"Qu Zhi explained, \"We have indeed considered this issue. Currently, the most feasible method is to use facial recognition technology.\"\"Facial recognition?\"\"Yes, as long as someone is registered with the Disabled Persons' Federation as visually impaired, the system can record their information. Then, through facial recognition, the robot can identify the target.\"\"Oh! I see!\" Zheng Baozhu sighed, \"But I heard that this technology might be exploited by bad people.\"Qu Zhi replied, \"We will definitely take measures to protect the information. The technology itself is not to blame; it's the human intentions that can be bad.\"\"Oh... Can I ask what other technologies are mainly used in the robot guide?\"\"The core technologies include environmental monitoring, positioning and navigation, as well as human-robot interaction. Besides that, the mobility of the robot is also crucial,\" Qu Zhi finished and looked at Zheng Baozhu with a curious expression, \"Why are you suddenly so interested in these things today?\"\"No, just... casual conversation,\" Zheng Baozhu pretended to be nonchalant when her phone, placed on the side, started ringing.The screen showed an incoming call from Tan Yao.Qu Zhi looked at the name and lightly snorted. Zheng Baozhu glanced at him and put on her earphones, answering the call, \"Tan Yao, what's up?\"\"Didn't we agree to meet up for a date on New Year's Day?\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow, \"Did we? I don't recall.\"Tan Yao's voice came through the earphones, \"Don't think I don't know. I heard from the hotel staff that you went out early in the morning with Qu Zhi! Where did you go?\"\"We met a friend. What does it have to do with you?\"\"How could it not have anything to do with me? I can tell he has ulterior motives toward you!\"Zheng Baozhu glanced at Qu Zhi beside her and denied Tan Yao's assumption, \"I think you are overthinking things.\"Tan Yao clicked his tongue and said, \"Then where are you now? I'll come to find you, and we can have lunch together.\"\"Lunch?\"As Zheng Baozhu was about to say those two words, Qu Zhi, who was sitting next to her, interjected, \"Why are you using your phone while driving? Driving improperly will lead to tears for your loved ones.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Since he said it loudly, Tan Yao on the other end heard it as well and exclaimed, \"I heard Qu Zhi's voice! You are still with him! It's too dangerous! This man clearly has bad intentions!\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu paused for a moment, \"You're acting like you have pure intentions.\"Tan Yao: \"...\"What's wrong with him? He just wants to pursue Zheng Baozhu, what bad intentions does he have!\"I can't return for the time being, so don't wait for me. Since it's a rare day off, you can go have fun with your friends. I'm driving, so I won't talk anymore,\" Zheng Baozhu hung up the phone after saying what she had to say.After seeing Zheng Baozhu hang up, Qu Zhi looked at her and said, \"Do you remember what you just said? Men are not good people, Tan Yao is one of them.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu's eyelid twitched, \"And what about you?\"\"Of course, I belong to the category of good men.\"\"Hahaha,\" Zheng Baozhu exaggeratedly laughed a few times, \"Thanks, I got a good laugh from that.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"He silently pursed his lips, pointing ahead at the Starlight Department Store, \"Let's park there.\"Zheng Baozhu asked, \"Why? Do you want to buy something?\"Qu Zhi said, \"Let's eat lunch outside first before going back.\"He wanted to avoid the situation of meeting that 0-4 guy back in the hotel.Zheng Baozhu didn't mind and thought it was about time for lunch anyway, so she nodded and drove over, \"What do you want to eat?\"\"Anything is fine, you choose,\" Qu Zhi glanced at her, \"Today, I'll treat you. Consider it a thank-you gift for coming with me to see Auntie Xiao.\"Zheng Baozhu glanced at him but didn't refuse, \"Sure, then let's go for barbecue?\"\"Alright.\"\"And you're in charge of grilling.\"\"...\"Lily BBQ in the Starlight Department Store was always crowded, and today, being New Year's Day, it was even more packed. Fortunately, Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi arrived relatively early, so they didn't have to endure the long queue.\"It's usually not this crowded at lunchtime. I didn't expect it to be so full today,\" Zheng Baozhu sat at the booth and started scanning the QR code to order, \"Since you're treating me, I'll order a bit more.\"\"Okay...\"Zheng Baozhu happily placed the order when suddenly a voice from the side said, \"Isn't this Qu Zhi? You're back from overseas?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A young woman wearing camel-colored clothing, holding a small plate of fruits, looked at Qu Zhi with surprise.She was beautiful and her makeup was well done. Qu Zhi didn't say anything, but Zheng Baozhu recognized her and called out, \"Li Huixin?\"Li Huixin seemed to have just noticed that there was another person sitting here and looked over, \"You are...?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu fell silent for a moment, raised her lips slightly, and smiled, \"I'm Zheng Baozhu. We were high school classmates.\"\"Oh... Zheng Baozhu, I didn't recognize you,\" Li Huixin also smiled, \"I didn't realize it was you.\"Zheng Baozhu smiled, \"It's okay, you might have a bad memory. Also, the person across from me isn't Qu Zhi; you mistook him.\"Li Huixin: \"...\"Qu Zhi glanced at Zheng Baozhu in silence without saying anything. Li Huixin laughed twice, breaking the awkward atmosphere, \"You're quite humorous, haha. How could I mistake Qu Zhi, our school's talented student?\"She casually placed the fruit plate on the table and looked at Qu Zhi, \"When did you return to the country?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"I came back not long ago.\"\"Why didn't you contact us, your old classmates?\"\"Too busy.\"The waiter came over to serve the dishes and said to Li Huixin, who was the person blocking the table, \"Excuse me, could you move a bit? We need to serve the dishes here.\"Li Huixin glanced at the dishes they ordered and smiled at Zheng Baozhu, \"Please move inwards.\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and scooted in, \"Are you eating alone here?\"\"Of course not, my friends are sitting inside,\" After saying that, Li Huixin added with a smile, \"But since I ran into old classmates, let's chat for a while.\"\"Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded with a smile.Li Huixin at Qu Zhi opposite her, \"Qu Zhi, where are you working now?\"\"At the Science and Technology Park.\"Li Huixin thought for a moment and asked, \"Is it the Science and Technology Park near Starlight Park?\"\"Yes.\"\"Wow, so you're really a scientist?\" Li Huixin continued chatting with him, \"I remember your parents are also involved in research, something related to nanotechnology? It's a coincidence; a few days ago, I went to see a doctor and the doctor told me they are using nanotechnology. Your parents' research is truly benefiting humanity.\"Zheng Baozhu absentmindedly picked up the lemon water on the table and took a sip, casually saying, \"Actually, Qu Zhi's parents' research is in aerospace.\"\"...\"Li Huixin turned her head to glance at Zheng Baozhu and smiled again, \"By the way, Zheng Baozhu, do you still remember Wei Yu? Back then, the rumors about you and Wei Yu were all over the place. Do you still keep in touch with him?\"Zheng Baozhu's eyebrows twitched as she looked up at Li Huixin, asking, \"Which Wei Yu?\"\"You know, the one you wrote a letter to, but I heard he rejected it.\"Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment, about to say something, but Li Huixin continued, \"Everyone was so surprised at the time; nobody expected him to refuse. But Wei Yu is one of the best-looking guys in our school, apart from Qu Zhi. It's normal for him to be a bit arrogant.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"This was simply beyond absurd.\"Li Huixin, I thought someone like you, who had been a class monitor, would have your own judgment. Your brain shouldn't be that dumb. I didn't expect you to be unable to distinguish rumors. No wonder we changed class monitors in the second semester.\"Li Huixin: \"...\"Right, the class monitor was changed in the second semester, and it was you, Zheng Baozhu. :)Li Huixin smiled at Zheng Baozhu, \"Sigh, let's not bring up these past matters since you don't like them. But Wei Yu is getting married soon; will you come to the wedding?\"\"We'll see when the time comes,\" Zheng Baozhu drank some water disinterestedly, looking at Qu Zhi across the table, \"Why aren't you grilling yet?\"\"...\"Qu Zhi, who was listening to gossip, reluctantly picked up the barbecue tongs and started grilling.Seeing that they were ready to eat and had no intention of inviting her, Li Huixin didn't want to force herself to stay any longer. She took out her phone and said to Qu Zhi, \"Let's add each other as friends. It's good to stay in touch if anything comes up.\"Qu Zhi replied, \"Aren't we all in the class group chat? If there's anything, we can just talk in the group.\"\"Okay, then,\" Li Huixin smiled and stood up, \"I'll head back to my friends; they are waiting for me over there.\"\"Sure.\"Li Huixin picked up the fruits she brought, not even looking back, and left.Zheng Baozhu looked at the departing figure with fruits and frowned, muttering, \"She actually took the fruits away! Well, I'll go get them myself!\"After informing Qu Zhi, she ran to the self-service area to get fruits and snacks. She went back and forth, carrying several plates back, and the table was almost full.\"That's enough; can you eat all of this?\"Zheng Baozhu considered it for a moment, feeling that Qu Zhi's words made a lot of sense.Finally, she settled down.Qu Zhi's first batch of grilled pork belly was ready. He evenly distributed it into their bowls and asked, \"You wrote letters to Wei Yu too? You had quite a rich high school life.\"\"Ew!\" Zheng Baozhu wrapped the grilled pork with lettuce and couldn't help but make a disgusted sound, \"Who wrote a letter to him? It was he who gave me the letter, and I rejected him! Unexpectedly, he is so good at distorting the truth, spreading rumors about me!\"In high school, people didn't have much entertainment, so gossip like this was what they loved to hear. By the time Zheng Baozhu heard from Meng Yaxin about this incident, the rumors were already everywhere.Fortunately, a few days after this incident, there was a monthly exam, and everyone's attention was quickly occupied by the exam results and the subsequent parent-teacher meeting.After hearing her explanation, Qu Zhi lightly nodded, \"That makes sense.\"Zheng Baozhu glanced at him, \"What makes sense?\"\"...Nothing,\" Qu Zhi cleared his throat, placed some marinated pork belly on the grill, and said, \"The rumors might not have been spread by Wei Yu himself; it could be other classmates taking things out of context and spreading them.\"\"But he still didn't come out to explain,\" Zheng Baozhu finished eating the lettuce-wrapped pork belly, \"Exactly as I said, men are not good people.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi flipped the skewers while saying, \"The grilled food you're eating right now was grilled by a man.\"\"Oh, thank you.\"\"...\"After finishing the grilled food, the two went to the dessert heaven on the first floor to buy some sweets and then returned directly to the Starlight Farm. When Qu Zhi entered the hotel, he paid special attention, and fortunately, 0-4 was no longer there.He left all the local specialties given by Aunt Xiao at Zheng Baozhu's door and planned to go back to his room. Zheng Baozhu looked at the bags and parcels at the door and stopped him, \"Are you really giving everything to me?\"Qu Zhi turned around and looked, saying, \"Aunt Xiao said they're all for you.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu was speechless, \"You don't have to be so polite.\"\"It's fine; it doesn't make much difference if you eat them or I eat them.\"\"...\"Really?While Zheng Baozhu was still pondering this question, Qu Zhi had already returned to his room. She could only carry all the local specialties given by Aunt Xiao back to her own room.After opening the dessert she bought from Starlight Department Store, Zheng Baozhu sat down and messaged Meng Yaxin: I bumped into Li Huixin while having barbecue just now.Meng Yaxin: Ah, you went out for barbecue with Qu Zhi? I've also decided, I'm having barbecue tonight too!Zheng Baozhu: ??? Is that the main point?Zheng Baozhu: No, how did you know I was with Qu Zhi?Meng Yaxin: Really? Don't tell me you haven't seen the hundreds of messages in the group chat today?Meng Yaxin: Cen Tongtong is even selling all the keyboards in her home on her WeChat Moments.Zheng Baozhu: ............After leaving the group, she indeed saw the chat records that Cen Tongtong sent.She then on Cen Tongtong's profile picture again and saw her WeChat Moments where she was selling her keyboards.\"..........\"Zheng Baozhu was utterly speechless. Cen Tongtong liked to play games and write novels, so she collected a lot of keyboards, separating them for gaming and typing. Whenever she saw a nice keyboard, she couldn't help but place an order. Over time, she lost count of how many keyboards she had at home.Oh, no, wait! Just now, after counting on her Moments, there were a total of seventeen keyboards, and so far, not a single one had been sold.Heartbreaking.Zheng Baozhu: I told you guys to leave the group, but you guys just don't listen. :)Meng Yaxin: You mundane folks wouldn't understand the joy of shipping CP. You said you met Li Huixin just now?Zheng Baozhu: Yes :)Zheng Baozhu: Do you think Li Huixin likes Qu Zhi? I feel like she's somehow dissatisfied with me.Meng Yaxin: She is indeed dissatisfied with you, but it might not be because of Qu Zhi.Meng Yaxin: I was in the same class as Li Huixin in our freshman year. You didn't know, right? She was the class flower back then!Zheng Baozhu: And then?Meng Yaxin: Then in sophomore year, we were divided into different classes, and you became the class flower.Zheng Baozhu: ..........Meng Yaxin: That's not all. You also snatched the position of the class monitor from her!Zheng Baozhu: ? Isn't the class monitor elected by the students' votes?Meng Yaxin: Go ask those defeated presidential candidates abroad if they remember the ones who voted against them or the ones who replaced them.Zheng Baozhu: ...Alright.As she was chatting with Meng Yaxin, Gao Boyun suddenly sent her a message.Gao Boyun: Next week, you may need to join the team earlier. Can you adjust your schedule accordingly?Zheng Baozhu: Yes, as a boss, my time is more flexible. [ok]Gao Boyun: Oh, if President Zheng says so, then I'm relieved. \u00a0I've made some modifications to the script. I'll send you the revised version and I'll notify you once the joining time is confirmed.Zheng Baozhu: Sure, Little Director Gao.Gao Boyun: ......He felt this actress was quite arrogant. :)The production team quickly sent Zheng Baozhu a new schedule, moving the date forward to next Wednesday. This time, joining the crew was different from her previous roles where she could go home after filming. The production team required her to stay on set throughout the filming period and she would also have to stay in the hotel arranged by the crew.Because of the sudden notice, Zheng Baozhu used all her time to prepare snacks and other necessities for her stay on the set. She also brought some clothes, but mainly for sleeping, as she would be in costumes during the shooting, and there wouldn't be many opportunities to wear regular clothes.While preparing these things, she also went through the revised script. Apart from one major scene change, everything else was just minor adjustments, and there were no major issues. Moreover, this time, Ye Ling's character was a skilled divine doctor with fewer lines.Zheng Baozhu quickly memorized her lines and attended one last class with Teacher Ge. After that, she would be confined to the film set, and she wouldn't be able to attend classes for a while.The day before departure, Zheng Baozhu was packing the things she would take with her when her phone suddenly started ringing. She picked it up and found that Meng Yaxin had added them to a new group.Zheng Baozhu: ? What kind of group is this?Meng Yaxin: Look at the group name! [My Daily Filming Journey with Top Stars]Zheng Baozhu: ..........Meng Yaxin: When you're on set, remember to take more photos of Lin Ziqin for me!Cen Tongtong: Lots of handsome photos!Zheng Baozhu: ....I understand the logic, but why is Qu Zhi also in the group?Qu Zhi: I was about to ask the same question.Meng Yaxin: It's more fun this way. [doge]Zheng Baozhu rolled her eyes. It seemed that Meng Yaxin still had too much free time on her hands. She ignored them, put down her phone, and continued packing her things.The next day, when she came out of her room with her luggage, she happened to run into Qu Zhi. Zheng Baozhu was a little surprised. It wasn't even bright outside yet and Qu Zhi was already leaving for work so early?Since she hadn't done her makeup, she was fortunate that she wore a mask.Looking at Qu Zhi approaching, she asked him, \"Are you going to work this early?\"The Science and Technology Park was only a walking distance away from the hotel. Wasn't Dr. Qu a bit too diligent?In response to her question, Qu Zhi calmly nodded, \"Yes.\"They walked together to the elevator door, and Qu Zhi glanced at her luggage, \"Can you manage it alone?\"\"It's fine. Director Gao has already arranged the room for me. I'll head directly to the set and join them after work,\" Zheng Baozhu replied, dragging her luggage as they both entered the elevator.Qu Zhi pressed the button for the lobby and looked at Zheng Baozhu, \"Did the director personally arrange your room?\"\"The production team has other people in contact with me, but many things are directly communicated by Director Gao,\" Zheng Baozhu smiled at Qu Zhi, \"Maybe he likes me more.\"Qu Zhi: \"......\"Didn't you find anything strange about that? :)\"I have to tell you...\" Zheng Baozhu leaned closer to Qu Zhi and whispered, \"Director Gao is the son of Gao Tianming; Gao Tianming was very close to my aunt.\"\"Oh,\" Qu Zhi cleared his throat awkwardly, \"He knows your aunt is Su Ming?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded as the elevator door opened, \"Well, I'm leaving now.\"With her luggage, Zheng Baozhu hurriedly went out, and the driver of her car, seeing her with the luggage, got out of the car and opened the trunk, helping her put the luggage inside. Qu Zhi stood at the door, watching her get in the car, and only returned to the restaurant after the car drove away.At the film set, Zheng Baozhu first went to the makeup room to change into her costume and then dragged her luggage to find Gao Boyun. Her role was the first love interest of the male lead. She didn't have many scenes with the other main characters, so the production team divided the filming into two groups. Today, the main cast was here, as they planned to shoot the part where the male lead comes to find Ye Ling.In the original story, this scene portrayed Ye Ling as heartbroken because she loved the male lead, but he brought another woman with him. If filmed according to the original story, it would be more challenging. However, the revised script removed any romantic feelings between Ye Ling and the male lead, so there would be no heartbroken portrayal. This scene was relatively easy for Zheng Baozhu and was suitable for her first day on the set.As Zheng Baozhu arrived, everyone turned to look at her. Gao Boyun noticed her presence and called for a break, walking over to her, and observed, \"You look good, this appearance looks even better outdoors.\"Zheng Baozhu obediently replied, \"Thank you for the compliment, Director Gao.\"Gao Boyun glanced at her luggage and said, \"I see you don't have an assistant. Let's put the luggage in my car. I won't be responsible if anything happens to it while you're on set.\"\"Oh, thank you, Director Gao!\" Zheng Baozhu was about to ask where his car was when Gao Boyun called a crew member over to help her with the luggage. She felt a little embarrassed about the situation.\"Greetings, Teacher Lin. Come and see our Ye Ling,\" Gao Boyun called Lin Ziqin over as well. Zheng Baozhu looked at Lin Ziqin; he was wearing white attire today, which somewhat matched the set. Lin Ziqin had acted in ancient dramas before, but he hadn't worn white in any of them. Usually, he was dressed ethereally, but this time, he exuded a bit of a heroic vibe.Lin Ziqin had a good posture, always standing straight, which gave him an elegant demeanor. Combined with his handsome face, it's no wonder he had so many fans from his ancient drama roles.When Lin Ziqin approached, Zheng Baozhu greeted him, \"Hello, Teacher Lin!\"\"Hello to you too,\" Lin Ziqin replied, looking at her, \"I remember you. You were a foreground extra in my previous drama, right?\"\"Yes, yes, Teacher Lin has a great memory!\"Gao Boyun interjected, \"It's probably because she's beautiful. Teacher Lin naturally remembers her.\"Lin Ziqin glanced at him, \"Isn't that what you're saying about yourself?\"Listening to their playful banter, Zheng Baozhu didn't say anything and simply stood on the side. Gao Boyun then turned the conversation back to Zheng Baozhu, \"Lin Ziqin, take a look at our Ye Ling. What do you think?\"\"Good,\" Lin Ziqin looked at Zheng Baozhu and replied, \"We will be working together for a while, so I hope Teacher Zheng will take good care of me.\"\"I will, I will. Teacher Lin, please take good care of me too.\"After exchanging pleasantries, Gao Boyun asked Lin Ziqin to continue shooting. Zheng Baozhu's scenes for the day were not extensive, so she spent most of her time waiting. Waiting, however, wasn't the most challenging part; the real challenge was the cold weather.Her costume had three layers, but each layer was thin and didn't provide much warmth. Even though she had warm packs inside during costume changes, the effect was limited. Sitting in the chilly resting area, Zheng Baozhu hugged her thermos and took a small sip of hot water.Drinking hot water was a way to stay warm, but it was inconvenient to use the restroom on the set. Zheng Baozhu didn't want to keep running to the restroom, especially since she was wearing such a bright white outfit.After lunch, Gao Boyun resumed filming the scene where the male lead persisted and asked Ye Ling why she refused to go with him. Zheng Baozhu thought, \"Why don't you consider her feelings?\"According to the script, she shot the scene with Lin Ziqin several times. Finally, Gao Boyun expressed his satisfaction, \"This take is good.\"After Gao Boyun's approval, Zheng Baozhu and Lin Ziqin approached the monitor to review the footage. After watching several shots, Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but say, \"Director Gao, you made me look so beautiful! A divine director!\"Even Lin Ziqin couldn't help but comment, \"Indeed, you really know how to shoot Zheng Baozhu.\"Gao Boyun replied, \"I know how to shoot everyone. Don't you think you look good in the shots I took?\"Zheng Baozhu chimed in, \"Lin Ziqin also looks handsome!\"Lin Ziqin, who stood by, received many compliments on his appearance before, but Zheng Baozhu's praise still made him slightly flustered, \"Thank you.\"Gao Boyun chuckled and told Zheng Baozhu, \"Your performance and delivery have improved since the last time I saw you. You're more natural and have your own style now. Looks like the time you've spent learning hasn't been in vain.\"\"I must improve. If I fail, it's not just my reputation at stake.\"\"Alright, you're done for now. Go take a rest.\"\"Oh...\"As Zheng Baozhu was about to leave, Lin Ziqin called her back, \"You can rest in my area; there's a small heater there to keep you warm.\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback; she could hardly believe her luck, \"Really?\"Although she wasn't in the industry for long, she had climbed up the ranks from an extra, and she understood how strict the hierarchy was on a film set. Even accidentally touching the belongings of an actor with such a status could get her severely scolded.She still remembered that in Lin Ziqin's previous set, the crew had reminded them thousands of times not to sit in Lin Ziqin's chair accidentally.Lin Ziqin responded nonchalantly, \"Why not? Bring your chair over.\"\"Okay, thank you, Teacher Lin! You are such a kind person!\" Zheng Baozhu had been freezing all morning, so now she was ecstatic to be able to use Lin Ziqin's heater. She moved her chair cheerfully. Gao Boyun looked at Lin Ziqin with a playful tone, \"Hey, has Teacher Lin received the 'Good Person Card'?\"Lin Ziqin gave him a glance, \"Hurry up and start shooting. The sooner we finish, the sooner we can leave work.\"\"Haha, are you the director, or am I the director? Are you ordering me?\"The shooting resumed quickly, while Zheng Baozhu sat by Lin Ziqin's heater. She snapped a photo and sent it to the group chat [My Daily Filming Journey with Top Stars].Zheng Baozhu: Wah, Lin Ziqin is such a kind person! He even let me use his heater!

You should have taken a photo with Lin Ziqin!Zheng Baozhu was speechless for a moment. She selected a few decent photos she had taken over the past few hours and shared them in the group chat.Meng Yaxin: Ahhhh! Lin Ziqin looks so handsome! That height, that slim waist! Let me just say it, I want to sleep with Lin Ziqin!Zheng Baozhu: .........Zheng Baozhu: Control yourself, Qu Zhi is still in the group chat.Meng Yaxin: Qu Zhi doesn't care if I want to sleep with Lin Ziqin. [doge]Cen Tongtong: Baozhu, share your photos! Let's see!Zheng Baozhu: [Pictures][Pictures][Pictures]Meng Yaxin: Whoa! Are you wearing a costume with Lin Ziqin?Meng Yaxin: Wahhh, they look so good! There are so many people on the set. Wahhh, can I visit the set? I also want to use Lin Ziqin's heater. [pity]Cen Tongtong: Baozhu, are you staying in the same hotel as Lin Ziqin? Lin Ziqin is really handsome. If not, can you work harder?Meng Yaxin: I see. Tongtong, you just don't want to eat your keyboard, so you're desperately trying to matchmake Baozhu with other men.Meng Yaxin: Qu Zhi is watching u.Cen Tongtong: No, I'm not, really, I'm just offering sincere advice.Zheng Baozhu: ...These photos are sent by the director. The photos I posted are for the group's viewing only, not for external sharing.After sending this message, Zheng Baozhu put down her phone and went back to work.Her first day on set went smoothly. The crew finished work early at 7 p.m. Zheng Baozhu heard from other actors that as long as they didn't film night scenes, the crew would usually wrap up around 6 or 7 p.m.Zheng Baozhu could only say that the crew was great with Gao Boyun as the director!As her luggage was in Gao Boyun's car, it was natural for her to walk back with him after work. It was apparent that Gao Boyun treated her differently, and everyone noticed, but no one said anything in front of them. They all whispered about it privately. Even Lin Ziqin's manager couldn't resist gossiping a bit on the way back to the hotel.\"Do you know what's going on between Gao Boyun and Zheng Baozhu?\" Lin Ziqin had some private conversations with Gao Boyun, so his manager assumed he knew some inside information.Lin Ziqin lay half-reclined on a chair, looking at his phone. Hearing this, he replied, \"What do you mean, what's going on?\"\"Don't you think Gao Boyun treats her too well?\"\"Oh, you're talking about that... Gao Boyun probably wants to nurture her; he appreciates her. Besides, she doesn't have a manager or an assistant, so he's just taking care of her a bit more.\"The manager suddenly remembered when she visited the set today, Zheng Baozhu was sitting in Lin Ziqin's resting area, using his heater. The assistant said it was at Lin Ziqin's request.The manager became alert instantly: \"So, you're also giving special treatment because of this?\"Lin Ziqin hesitated for a moment, sensing the implied meaning behind her words, \"Sister, not only do you think Gao Boyun has something with her, but now you also think I have something with her?\"\"...\"The manager coughed lightly, \"Well, she's very beautiful. Not just men, even I feel something when I see her.\"\"...\"Lin Ziqin looked up and said, \"Sister, your words are quite bold.\"The manager said, \"When I said feelings, I meant I want to sign her under my management.\"\"Oh...\" Lin Ziqin lay back down, \"But it seems like she doesn't plan to sign with the company. Gao Boyun wanted to sign her, but she rejected it.\"\"Haha, she even rejected Director Gao?\" The manager chuckled, \"This girl has some spirit.\"At this moment, Zheng Baozhu was sitting in Gao Boyun's car, sending a message to the group chat about finishing work. Suddenly, Qu Zhi, who had been quiet all day, sent her a private message.Qu Zhi: Don't you have a heater? Tell me your hotel address, and I'll send one to you.Zheng Baozhu: No need, I didn't bring a heater mainly because I'm lazy to carry it. Other people have a bunch of assistants, they can bring a lot of stuff, but I'm alone. Just carrying an actor's chair and a bag is already heavy enough.Qu Zhi: Oh... Do you want to hire an assistant?Zheng Baozhu: I thought about it, but I'm only staying on the set for twenty days. After twenty days, should I just fire the assistant? (:\u0437\u300d\u2220)Qu Zhi: ...That makes sense.Qu Zhi: What about driving there?Zheng Baozhu: I thought about it too, but my car is quite high-profile. If I drive it to the set, everyone will think too much. Ah, I envy those regular cars.Qu Zhi: ...Thanks, for being down-to-earth.Zheng Baozhu: But Gao Boyun said I can use his car every day, so I can bring more stuff now.Qu Zhi: Looks like everyone loves you on the set.Zheng Baozhu: You just realized it? I've always been loved.Qu Zhi: Oh. \u00a0I finished eating, back to overtime.Zheng Baozhu: Why do you keep sending me that?Zheng Baozhu: :):)Qu Zhi: :):):)Zheng Baozhu: \"......\"Help, why are they acting so childish. :)\"Are you texting your boyfriend?\" Gao Boyun suddenly asked while sitting beside her. Zheng Baozhu guiltily locked her phone. Then she wondered why she reacted like that.\"No, it's just an old classmate,\" Zheng Baozhu put away her phone and smiled at Gao Boyun.Gao Boyun raised an eyebrow, \"A male classmate?\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him, \"Is that important?\"\"If it's not important, why did you hide it?\"\"...\"Did she hide it? No, haha!After arriving at the hotel, Zheng Baozhu realized that the room Gao Boyun arranged for her was on the same floor as Lin Ziqin's. For a supporting role like her, the production crew wouldn't allocate such a good room. Before coming, she had already planned to book a better room herself in case the crew provided a poor one.Unexpectedly, Gao Boyun handled everything for her.Zheng Baozhu felt a bit uneasy, \"Director Gao, did the crew arrange such a good room for me?\"Gao Boyun nodded casually, \"Ordinary rooms might not suit President Zheng's preferences, right? If you're worried about the production budget, you can invest in us anytime.\"\"...That won't do,\" Zheng Baozhu dragged her luggage and spoke sternly, \"If I invest, wouldn't I be bringing money into the production? It would damage your reputation. I can't do something that would tarnish your reputation!\"\"... Well, thank you then.\"\"You're welcome. Director Gao, goodbye,\" Zheng Baozhu used her room key card to open the door and went in with her luggage. Although the production crew finished work early, they started quite early in the morning. Zheng Baozhu had to wake up around 4 a.m. to get ready and go to makeup and styling.To wake up early, she went to bed at 9 p.m.Even elementary school students would still be playing video games at this time.Zheng Baozhu checked her phone for a while and soon felt sleepy. She double-checked the alarm she set, yawned, and locked her phone.The next day, Zheng Baozhu woke up on time, did her makeup and styling early, and followed Gao Boyun to the shooting location. They were filming action scenes today, which excited her. The production crew had a specialized fight choreographer who taught Zheng Baozhu the moves. With her dance background and good flexibility and control, she found it not too difficult to learn.The fight scenes were specially designed by the choreographer. While they might not be practical for real combat, they looked impressive on screen. Zheng Baozhu was enthusiastic and practiced with the teacher. She was jumping and trying out various moves.\"Ah, great pose! It's my first time doing aerial silk!\"Listening to the fight choreographer's remarks, Gao Boyun, who had been talking with him, subconsciously glanced over, \"You seem excited.\"\"Well, a little, hahaha!\" After all, who doesn't have a martial arts dream deep down? Flying over roofs and walls is engraved in the DNA of the Chinese!After the final confirmation, Gao Boyun shouted \"Action\". In today's scene, after Ye Ling saved the male lead, the male lead's enemies came looking for him. The male lead had lost his memory completely, even forgetting his martial arts skills. Fortunately, Ye Ling knew martial arts and drove the troublemakers away.When Zheng Baozhu was flying on the aerial silk, she couldn't contain her joy and laughed in the air, \"Hahaha, I'm flying, I'm flying~~\"Gao Boyun: \"...\"I hope you can still be this happy later. :)After flying on the aerial silk twice, Zheng Baozhu mastered the techniques and felt a great thrill. She felt like an invincible martial artist!However, after being suspended in the air for the whole morning, Zheng Baozhu couldn't find it amusing anymore. Her entire body was sore, and she was exhausted. In this chilly winter, she was sweating profusely.Seeing the makeup artist coming with her tools to touch up her makeup, Zheng Baozhu drank several mouthfuls of water, feeling like she couldn't go on, \"Director Gao, I can't do this anymore. Flying so many times, but it's not that exciting anymore.\"Gao Boyun sat in front of the monitor, not even looking up, and said, \"You were so excited just now. Maintain that excitement.\"\"...\"Excited? Isn't it the recklessness of the young and inexperienced? Although aerial silk was thrilling, it was also painful!\"Alright, let's have lunch first. This scene is good enough; we'll continue in the afternoon.\"\"...\"The scenes in the afternoon were even more agonizing. In the morning, she had only flown around and did some somersaults, but in the afternoon, there were many aerial poses she needed to hold for a while. Moreover, the fight choreographer knew about her dance background and designed several high-difficulty moves for her. They looked stunning, but they were really painful...To endure the pain and still maintain an elegant posture, deliver lines, and make everyone believe you were as light as a swallow! At this moment, Zheng Baozhu apologized to all the actors she had criticized before!!I was wrong!!!After finishing filming for the day, Zheng Baozhu felt that her body was falling apart.Slumping in the car on the way back to the hotel, she saw Meng Yaxin and others constantly sending messages in the group.\"Where are today's behind-the-scenes photos? Why did you die after posting the aerial silk video in the morning!\"Zheng Baozhu: ...I truly almost died just now.Zheng Baozhu: I'm contemplating why I chose to become an actress.Meng Yaxin: ...Oh, really? What happened?Zheng Baozhu: I was hanging on the aerial silk all day and now my whole body is in pain. I just want to get a full-body massage.Zheng Baozhu: I finally understand why historical drama actors are so thin. Being lightweight surely helps.Zheng Baozhu: Before I got on the aerial silk, Lin Ziqin kindly came over to give me some tips on how to cushion myself to reduce the pain... but it still hurts a lot. My neck will be all blue for sure.Cen Tongtong: Oh, that's too miserable. \u00a0Hugs to you. You should get some medication at the hotel tonight. Do you have any medicine?Zheng Baozhu: Lin Ziqin gave me some. He's such a good person.Meng Yaxin: Lin Ziqin's dosage is too high.Cen Tongtong: Why don't you look at the group name?...Meng Yaxin fell silent.Zheng Baozhu: Gao Boyun told me that I'll get used to it after a few more takes. I guess this is being PUA'd by aerial silk.After sending this message, Qu Zhi contacted her privately.Qu Zhi: How are you feeling now?Zheng Baozhu: ? So you've been peeking at my messages all along!Qu Zhi: ...Zheng Baozhu: I should be feeling better after taking some medication and having a good sleep tonight. Today was just too exhausting.Qu Zhi: Then rest early. Send me your hotel address, I'll send something over for you.Zheng Baozhu sent him the address and then collapsed in her seat. Typing on her phone felt laborious now.After returning to the hotel, Zheng Baozhu checked herself and indeed found bruises and broken skin where she was strapped in the aerial silk. The last time she experienced such hardships was when she was just starting to learn dance. It's a good thing she had gone through tough times before; otherwise, she would have been too frustrated now.After taking a shower and applying some medicine to her injuries, Zheng Baozhu massaged herself for a while and then fell asleep.The next day, there were still fight scenes, but she didn't have to be suspended on the aerial silk for extended periods. Most of the scenes were performed on the ground. During breaks, she sat there roasting sweet potatoes while watching Lin Ziqin practice on the aerial silk.Indeed, watching someone do flips in the air was more enjoyable than doing them herself.Zheng Baozhu recorded a short video and shared it in the group: Lin Ziqin looks so cool doing aerial silk. It's simply beautiful.Meng Yaxin: So handsome!! How are you feeling today?Zheng Baozhu: I'm feeling better. People can gradually become numb to pain.Meng Yaxin: ...In the evening, Zheng Baozhu still hitched a ride with Gao Boyun back to the hotel. Now, she kept her actor's chair and backpack in Gao Boyun's car and only carried a small bag when getting off.When getting off, she also put on a mask and a hat. Gao Boyun even teased her, saying she hadn't become a big star yet, but she was already acting like one.After saying that, he put on a mask himself.As soon as they walked into the hotel lobby, the lobby manager recognized her and whispered, \"President Zheng, there's a gentleman waiting for you over there.\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback and looked in the direction the manager pointed to. There was a man sitting on the sofa in the lobby resting area. He was dressed in a black coat, leaning casually on the sofa with both legs crossed in front of him, and a magazine on his knees. He was slightly tilting his head, flipping through the magazine in his hands.Zheng Baozhu paused because that man was none other than Qu Zhi.How did he end up here??She greeted the lobby manager and walked over to Qu Zhi, \"Qu Zhi, what brings you here?\"Upon hearing her voice, Qu Zhi turned his head and stood up from the sofa, \"Didn't I say I would send something for you?\"\"???\" Zheng Baozhu was full of question marks, \"Wait, you mean you came here to personally deliver it?\"\"Of course.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Why are making it sound so reasonable?Gao Boyun approached from behind and stared at Qu Zhi curiously, \"Who's this gentleman?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"Oh, he's my old classmate.\"Qu Zhi also looked at Gao Boyun, greeting him, \"So you must be Director Gao? A pleasure to meet you.\"\"Nice to meet you too,\" Gao Boyun nodded toward him, playfully looking at Zheng Baozhu, \"Your old classmate is quite handsome.\"\"Haha, is that so?\" Zheng Baozhu pulled Qu Zhi's arm and walked toward the elevator, \"I'm going upstairs now.\"Without waiting for Gao Boyun to speak, she pulled Qu Zhi away. After turning into the elevator, she let go of Qu Zhi and scanned him up and down, \"Didn't you say you came to bring me something? Where is it?\"Qu Zhi looked at her, raised an eyebrow, and said, \"Didn't I say I was going to bring you something?\"Qu Zhi raised his eyebrows and was about to speak, but Zheng Baozhu interrupted with a startled expression, \"You're not talking about yourself, are you??\"\"...\"Qu Zhi remained silent for a moment, then nodded, \"You gave me a good reason, I can use that next time.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"\"But this time, you will have to be disappointed; I put that in the room.\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback, \"You even booked a room?\"\"What else would I do?\" Qu Zhi looked at her with a sideways glance, \"Don't tell me you're inviting me to stay in your room?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu choked, \"Aren't you supposed to be working?\"\"Tomorrow's the weekend, a day off.\"\"...\"Oh.The elevator door opened again, and Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi stepped out. Qu Zhi pressed the button for his floor, \"Let's go to my room first.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu looked up at him, \"What did you bring?\"\"Food and some medicinal plasters,\" Qu Zhi replied, then looked down, \"Didn't you say you wanted a massage?\"\"?\" Zheng Baozhu expressed a puzzled look, \"So?\"Qu Zhi said, \"Didn't you already experience my massage last time?\"As soon as he finished speaking, the elevator door opened again. The two young people, who were on the other side, looked at them ambiguously.\"...\"Zheng Baozhu took out another mask from her bag and handed it to Qu Zhi, \"You should wear one too.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQu Zhi's room was one\u00a0floor higher than Zheng Baozhu's room. Because this hotel often accommodated film crews, it was always fully booked. Since Qu Zhi had to make a last-minute reservation, he could only get a luxury suite.Zheng Baozhu followed him in, took off her mask, and looked around his room, \"I didn't expect you to be so extravagant and luxurious.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi remained silent for a moment, then asked, \"Extravagant I can understand, but where did you get 'luxurious' from?\"Zheng Baozhu looked at the double bathtub in front of the floor-to-ceiling window and said, \"Who puts a bathtub here like this?\"\"That's how the hotel arranged it. I'm also very curious about this layout,\" Qu Zhi said as he opened his suitcase, \"These are all for you.\"Zheng Baozhu leaned over to take a look. Qu Zhi's suitcase was filled with various snacks, separated from the medical plasters and medicinal wines. The most outrageous thing was that he even brought a collapsible foot bath!She picked up the foot bath and placed it on the floor, unfolding it, \"Is this also part of your preparations for me?\"\"Yes, foot baths can effectively relieve fatigue. To make it convenient to carry, I specially chose a collapsible one.\"\"...You've really thought of everything,\" Zheng Baozhu said.Qu Zhi didn't confirm or deny, \"Do you want to try it? The reviews say it's quite good.\"\"I'll try it later when I'm back in my room.\" Zheng Baozhu moved the foot bath to the side and took out the snacks from the big bag, \"My goodness, are you here to be my Buddha? I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed by your kindness.\"Qu Zhi took a sip of water and said, \"Don't overthink it. Aunt Su asked me to take care of you.\"\"What?\" Zheng Baozhu's hands trembled slightly upon hearing this, \"My mom knows I'm on the set?\"\"If she knew, would you still be able to stay here undisturbed?\"\"...You have a point,\" Zheng Baozhu clicked her tongue, \"So why are you scaring me?\"Qu Zhi paused for a moment, \"What I meant was that during the time I am staying in your hotel, Aunt Su asked me to take care of you. I've been staying with you for so long, and it's time to give something back, right?\"\"Of course!\" Zheng Baozhu got excited when he said that, \"Do you know how much your room costs per night? I let you stay for free! In that case, I think I'm the one at a loss here!\"\"...Then I'll come to deliver something for you next time,\" Qu Zhi said, taking out the medicated plasters, \"These are medicated plasters that my seniors personally tested and found effective. If you have any sore spots, just use one, and it works very well. I also brought medicinal wine. Where are you bruised?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu gently coughed at the question, \"You're so clever, why don't you guess which parts of me are most likely to get bruised from practicing wire stunts?\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"He turned his head slightly and coughed lightly, \"Then do it yourself and be careful with the technique.\"\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu looked up at him for a moment, put down the snacks in her hand, and leaned over, \"Actually, my lower back hurts too. Can you help me massage it? Consider it as your room payment.\"\"Okay...\"Qu Zhi tidied up the sofa a bit and brought two pillows for Zheng Baozhu, \"You can lie here.\"\"Alright,\" Zheng Baozhu took off her coat and lifted her hair, lying down on the sofa, \"Be gentle, my old back is quite fragile.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi went to wash his hands, not only to clean them but also to warm them up with hot water. After drying his hands, he returned to the living room and sat down beside Zheng Baozhu.Zheng Baozhu was only wearing a loose top and low-waisted jeans, which made it relatively convenient. Before Qu Zhi started, he deliberately said, \"I'm going to lift your top.\"\"...This announcement sounds very particular,\" Zheng Baozhu found it strangely amusing. As Qu Zhi's hands started moving, he pulled the top upwards and exposed a small section of her waist.She wasn't wearing anything else underneath, so her bare skin was revealed. She had thick winter clothes on. Qu Zhi didn't notice at first, but now, suddenly taking a closer look, he realized that Zheng Baozhu's waist was even slimmer than he had imagined.Her waistline was beautiful, with smooth curves all the way down, hidden by the jeans.\"What are you doing?\" After waiting for a while and seeing him being silent, Zheng Baozhu turned her head to look at him, \"Are you enchanted by my tiny waist?\"\"...\"Qu Zhi tugged at his collar and looked away, \"I was just thinking that you didn't wear an undershirt.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"......\"You're thinking about undershirts while looking at my waist! You're beyond help!!\"When I was on the set, I wore an undershirt. I took it off when changing clothes,\" Zheng Baozhu said with a pout and then leaned back down, \"Stop being chatty, I want to go back to my room and sleep soon.\"Qu Zhi poured some medicinal wine into his palm, warmed it with his hands, and gently applied it to Zheng Baozhu's waist. His technique was skilled, and the pressure was just right, making Zheng Baozhu close her eyes in comfort, \"Leaving other things aside, your massage skills are really good. Did you practice deliberately?\"\"I learned a bit. I used to massage my elders at home,\" Qu Zhi replied.\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu playfully rubbed her head against the pillow and surprisingly felt a bit sleepy, \"Once you retire, you can specialize in this.\"\"...Thank you for the compliment, but no need,\" Qu Zhi poured some more medicinal wine into his hand and warmed it up again before continuing to massage Zheng Baozhu's waist.Zheng Baozhu's skin was fair and smooth and her figure was exceptionally good. Her waist was trim, and measured by a man's hands, it was just as described in books, delicate and slender.\"Are you too thin?\" Qu Zhi asked softly. Zheng Baozhu didn't respond for a while, and when Qu Zhi glanced at her, he was surprised to find that she had fallen asleep on the sofa.\"...\"He hadn't expected that his massage skills were so good that she fell asleep like this.Seeing Zheng Baozhu looking really tired, Qu Zhi didn't wake her up. He carefully placed her on the bed in the bedroom, thinking she would wake up after a while. However, she slept soundly and showed no signs of waking up. After tidying up a bit, Qu Zhi went back to the bedroom and took the blanket from the bed to sleep on the sofa.Zheng Baozhu was awakened by her own alarm clock. In a daze, she reached out and turned off the alarm clock on the bedside table. Her hair was messy as she sat up. It was only 4:30 in the morning, so Zheng Baozhu blinked her eyes, turned on the small light, and looked around.Wait a minute, this room is not hers??Subconsciously, she lifted the blanket to check and saw that she was wearing her clothes properly, which relieved her a bit. No, she didn't drink last night, so how did she end up sleeping in someone else's room?\"...\"She remembered now, it was Qu Zhi!!She quickly got up, put on her slippers, and walked out of the room. On the sofa, she saw Qu Zhi still sleeping. The sofa in this room was not small, but it seemed uncomfortable for Qu Zhi's large frame.The sight of him sleeping with the blanket wrapped around him looked rather pitiful.Zheng Baozhu stood there staring at him for a while, then silently walked to the bathroom, took out a new set of toiletries, and began to wash up. While brushing her teeth, she reflected on herself in the mirror.She had actually fallen asleep in a man's room without any precautions. That was really dangerous! But it wasn't entirely her fault; it was all because Qu Zhi's massage was too comfortable!Fortunately, the person last night was Qu Zhi... Um, if it weren't Qu Zhi, she wouldn't have let him massage her, right?So, it wasn't entirely her carelessness, yeah.Looking closely in the mirror, she scrutinized her face. Luckily, she had already removed her makeup on the set yesterday. Otherwise, that straight guy Qu Zhi wouldn't have thought of helping with makeup removal.Well, it's okay. It was already good enough that he thought of covering her with a blanket. Moreover, she had been sleeping in her clothes for so long last night, and surprisingly, she didn't feel uncomfortable at all...She must have slept like the dead.After washing up, Zheng Baozhu didn't return to her room. Instead, she planned to go directly to the makeup hotel. When she reached the living room, she looked at Qu Zhi still asleep on the sofa, and quietly closed the door.Gao Boyun's driver had already brought the car over. These days, Zheng Baozhu rode in this car every day, so the driver recognized her. Zheng Baozhu greeted the driver and sat in the car. Gao Boyun quickly came down too and saw Zheng Baozhu sitting inside the car. He smiled ambiguously.Zheng Baozhu felt goosebumps rise as he smiled, \"Director Gao, it's very early in the morning, can you stop scaring me like this?\"Gao Boyun got into the car and continued to look at her with a mysterious smile, \"Is that old classmate from yesterday the same old classmate you mentioned before?\"Zheng Baozhu instinctively moved a bit away from him, \"Yes, what do you want to say?\"Gao Boyun's smile grew even more meaningful, \"Nice, Baozhu, you're bringing men to the set now.\"\"...Wait a minute,\" Zheng Baozhu's eyelid twitched lightly, \"Are you misunderstanding something? He just came to bring me some comfort.\"\"Oh, comfort,\" Gao Boyun looked at her with a knowing look, \"Being away from home for a long time does require some comfort. Last night...\"\"Stop right there!\" Zheng Baozhu interrupted him directly, \"Your brain is full of perverted nonsense.\"\"Haha,\" Gao Boyun chuckled lightly, his eyes seemingly seeing through everything, \"No need to pretend, you didn't go back to your room last night, did you sleep in his room?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"\"We're all adults here, nothing to be embarrassed about.\"Zheng Baozhu blushed, \"How do you know I didn't go back to my room?\"Gao Boyun gave her a sidelong glance, \"Do you know how many pairs of eyes are watching? Do you think you can hide this?\"\"...\"\"But you don't have to worry. You're not famous yet, so not many people are paying attention. But be careful when you become famous.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him, \"If I say I just slept in his room last night, will you believe me?\"\"What do you think?\" Gao Boyun had the look of someone teasing a fool.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"It's impossible to clear up even if I jump into the Yellow River!\"You two didn't get too intense last night, did you? If it affects today's shooting, I won't let it slide, haha.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Please, stop it!When Qu Zhi woke up, Zheng Baozhu had just finished doing her makeup. He got up from the couch, feeling a bit stiff, and then noticed the snacks, medicine, and footbath tub still neatly placed in his room.\"...\"He had only booked the room for one night, should he leave these things with the front desk for Zheng Baozhu?He walked into the bedroom and saw that Zheng Baozhu was indeed not there anymore, and he didn't know when she left. Qu Zhi returned to the living room, pulled open the curtains, and suddenly noticed a note on the coffee table.His eyes flickered slightly as he approached, moving the ashtray to the side and picking up the note.\"Qu Zhi, I'm going to the set to work! Can you take the things I left in your room and bring them into mine? I left the room key on your desk!\"Qu Zhi looked down and, sure enough, there was a room key on the desk.He bent down to pick up the key and chuckled softly. Zheng Baozhu still had a commanding presence.After a quick wash, Qu Zhi took the room key left by Zheng Baozhu and dragged his suitcase to her room's door. Standing at the door, he swiped the key card, and the door made a soft beep and opened.Just as Lin Ziqin walked by, he happened to see a stranger swiping Zheng Baozhu's room door.And he was also carrying a suitcase.\"...\" Lin Ziqin wore a mask, passing by the man, but his eyes stayed on him, even the two assistants behind him curiously sizing up this handsome guy.Qu Zhi's hand on the door hesitated for a moment and he turned his head to look at Lin Ziqin.Someone staying on this floor must be an actor, except for Zheng Baozhu. As for how he knew the person opposite was an actor... Besides the two assistants following him, it was also because he looked like a star.This was probably what people often referred to as star quality.The man wore a mask, covering most of his face, but Qu Zhi had seen too many pictures of him in the group chat these days that he already remembered what he looked like.The owner of those eyes was most likely Lin Ziqin.The two silently locked eyes for a moment, neither saying a word. Qu Zhi dragged his suitcase and entered the room, while Lin Ziqin walked past the room's entrance and turned towards the elevator.Only after the two assistants behind him couldn't hold back their curiosity did one of them gossip, \"Who was that man just now? He's so handsome.\"\"He's indeed very good-looking. I even thought he might be a celebrity at first! He's probably Zheng Baozhu's friend, as I saw him using a room key to open the door.\"\"And he was carrying a suitcase. Could he be Zheng Baozhu's boyfriend?\"\"Possible. It seems Zheng Baozhu has a boyfriend now!\"\"It's not surprising that she has a boyfriend, especially when the boyfriend is so handsome.\"\"You're right.\"Lin Ziqin coughed in front of them, interrupting their chatter, \"Stop gossiping. Don't mention this when we get to the set later.\"The two assistants nodded, \"Don't worry, we know how to handle it!\"Inside the room, Qu Zhi placed the suitcase in Zheng Baozhu's room, intending to give her the suitcase as well. He took a picture of the suitcase and sent it to Zheng Baozhu along with a message: \"I've sent the things over to you, and the room key is on the table.\"Zheng Baozhu saw the message and replied with an \"OK\" gesture.Qu Zhi stared at the conversation for a moment, contemplating whether he should tell Zheng Baozhu about running into Lin Ziqin earlier. After some thought, he decided to lock his phone directly.Today was Lin Ziqin's last makeup session, and when he arrived at the set, Zheng Baozhu had already finished shooting a scene. After these few days of practice, Zheng Baozhu's action scenes were getting better and more authentic.As soon as Lin Ziqin arrived, he was pulled away by Gao Boyun for filming. During the break, Zheng Baozhu and Lin Ziqin sat together and roasted sweet potatoes. After thinking for a while, Lin Ziqin decided to give Zheng Baozhu a reminder, \"There are a lot of paparazzi people trailing us at the hotel we are staying in.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"??!\"Does everyone already know about what happened last night in Qu Zhi's room?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis matter must be explained clearly!\"Teacher Lin, do you say this because you saw something?\" Zheng Baozhu asked cautiously.Lin Ziqin nodded slightly, looking like he knew something but wouldn't say it.Zheng Baozhu slapped the back of her chair, \"No, you've misunderstood. Yesterday, my classmate came to see me. He knew I got injured while filming, so he brought me band-aids and medicinal wine...\"Lin Ziqin raised an eyebrow, \"Your classmate? I saw him entering your room with a suitcase. I thought he was your boyfriend.\"\"Huh?\" Zheng Baozhu's brain froze for a moment, only to realize that Lin Ziqin wasn't talking about the overnight stay in Qu Zhi's room. \"Oh, you saw him this morning?\"\"Yeah, he used the room card to enter.\"\"That's right. I was in a hurry this morning, so I asked him to help me put the things in my room.\"Lin Ziqin looked at her with some surprise, \"Are all the things in that big suitcase brought by him?\"\"Yeah, he even prepared a foot soak bucket for me. Can you expect any less?\"Lin Ziqin chuckled, \"He's quite thoughtful.\"He glanced at Zheng Baozhu a few times, \"Is this classmate of yours pursuing you?\"\"Ah?\" Zheng Baozhu's brain froze again, Qu Zhi pursuing her? How could that be possible!\"No, he used these things to pay for the room.\"\"Room fee?\" Lin Ziqin had heard from Gao Boyun that Zheng Baozhu had her own businesses, like restaurants and hotels. He nodded slightly, not probing further, but still reminded Zheng Baozhu, \"I just wanted to let you know and remind you not to be too conspicuous. You know those paparazzi love to dig up this kind of news.\"\"Yeah, I know,\" Zheng Baozhu smiled at him, not taking offense, \"But they'll dig up news about you. They probably aren't interested in a small fry like me.\"\"It's hard to say,\" Lin Ziqin said, \"Your appearance is outstanding, they might take a few pictures if they see you.\"\"...\"That makes sense; it seems that being pretty has its drawbacks!As they were chatting, a new supporting actor arrived. The scenes to be filmed in the next few days were all around Ye Ling's small cabin, mainly the scenes when the male lead was first discovered. There was a village near the cabin, and occasionally, villagers came to bring food and drinks for Ye Ling, chat about village gossip, and learn a bit of medical knowledge from her. If anyone in the village had a headache or fever, Ye Ling would try to help, and if she couldn't, they would come to her for assistance.The supporting actor hired by the crew was playing one of the villagers.\"Baozhu! We're on the same set again!\" a familiar voice sounded, and Zheng Baozhu turned to see Wang Jingyi whom she hadn't seen for a long time. She stood up in pleasant surprise, \"Wang Jingyi, are you playing a villager?\"\"Yeah, I finally passed the audition for the supporting actor! Waaah!\" Wang Jingyi happily hugged Zheng Baozhu, \"I guess your good luck charm worked!\"\"It's because of your own abilities!\"Gao Boyun, seeing the two of them getting along so well, asked Zheng Baozhu, \"Do you know each other?\"\"Yes, we were in the same acting prospect group before. Now she was extra too!\"Wang Jingyi felt a little embarrassed by Zheng Baozhu's praise, especially when she noticed that Lin Ziqin was also looking at them.Ah, she's going to act with Lin Ziqin again, and this time there are lines!!Hard work really pays off! T^TAfter catching up briefly, Gao Boyun called for the start of filming. Today, Zheng Baozhu had a scene where she had to carry Lin Ziqin on her back, so she needed to do it properly.Though Lin Ziqin was slim, he was tall, so it was still a bit challenging to carry him on her back. Zheng Baozhu and Lin Ziqin discussed with Gao Boyun for a while and finally settled on how to carry and walk. When Wang Jingyi saw Zheng Baozhu approaching, she went up to her and said, \"If you can't carry him, I can be your substitute. I'm a strongman with a lot of strength!\"\"... No thanks,\" Zheng Baozhu looked at her with suspicion, \"You think you can carry him just because you see Lin Ziqin? You have the strength for that?\"Wang Jingyi: \"...\"Baozhu, what are you saying?Once the filming officially started, Zheng Baozhu showed Wang Jingyi what it meant to be a true strongman. She effortlessly carried Lin Ziqin, who was a tall man, performing much better than the several attempts they made during rehearsal.Although the story required Ye Ling to carry the injured male lead all the way back to the small cabin from a cliff, they didn't have to actually carry him that far during filming. Gao Boyun only chose a few key locations for filming, and Zheng Baozhu carried him a short distance before they could edit the shots together.Wang Jingyi's character, the little villager, was waiting outside the cabin to bring food for Ye Ling. When she found that Ye Ling wasn't inside, she waited outside and saw her coming back with a seemingly injured man on her back, so she rushed forward to help.\"Cut, let's do it again!\" Gao Boyun stopped and asked Zheng Baozhu to do it again.Zheng Baozhu, who had already carried Lin Ziqin several times: \"...\"No strongman could endure such turmoil! Qu Zhi's back massage last night would be in vain. Today, her condition will get even worse!But on the set, the director's words were supreme. Even though Zheng Baozhu's back was already sore and aching, she obediently went back to carry him again.After today's filming, Zheng Baozhu shared her life insights in the group chat.Zheng Baozhu: No matter how handsome a guy is, he's just a bunch of weight and bones.Meng Yaxin: ??? Is this what you were doing today, carrying Lin Ziqin? If you can't do it, let me do it!Zheng Baozhu: I actually wanted to put him down, but the director wouldn't let me.Cen Tongtong: This is not right, you're carrying Lin Ziqin, not a wild boar! Don't you feel your heart pounding and face blushing like a little deer crashing into things?Zheng Baozhu: After carrying him for so long, whether it's a handsome guy or a wild boar, I can't tell the difference anymore. \u00a0My heart only has the instinct for survival, no worldly feelings.Zheng Baozhu: [holding lotus.jpg]Meng Yaxin: ...Lin Ziqin is already so skinny! Look at his slim waist, tell me again that you don't have any worldly feelings!Lin Ziqin mainly acts in period dramas, which require multiple layers of clothing, and he often wears waist belts. So even if he gains a little weight, it looks a bit muscular on the screen. That's why he pays more attention to weight management compared to other male stars.Zheng Baozhu: Yes, his waist does look slim, but I'm carrying him, so there's more bone to carry =.=Meng Yaxin: ??? So you're complaining that his hands are not good enough!Meng Yaxin: Try carrying @Qu Zhi, he also has a slim waist.Cen Tongtong: ??? There's no need for that. Let's continue discussing Lin Ziqin happily.Qu Zhi, who had been silent for a long time, suddenly said in the group: I should be a bit better than him. He looks even skinnier in person than on TV.Meng Yaxin: ??? When did you see him in person??Qu Zhi hesitated for a moment, then went silent again.Meng Yaxin: @Qu Zhi, did you go visit the set?? @Zheng Baozhu\"...\" Zheng Baozhu also went silent.Meng Yaxin: Wow, everything speaks louder than words. Tongtong, do you prefer a keyboard with 87 keys or 104 keys?Cen Tongtong: ... Thanks for the invitation, but I prefer not to eat keyboards.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Qu Zhi sent a private message: How's your waist feeling?Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment and replied: It's sore from last night. Maybe you should just send me an ergonomic chair next time.Qu Zhi: ...Zheng Baozhu was currently using the footbath tub Qu Zhi sent her to soak her feet. She took a photo of the footbath tub and sent it to him, saying, \"The footbath tub works fine. I'll try the ointment you gave me tonight.\"\"Yeah, it should help a bit,\" Qu Zhi replied, and then added, \"Does your crew really make you carry people without substitutes? They let you carry him for real?\"Zheng Baozhu sent him a question mark, \"Is this how you approach scientific research?\"Qu Zhi: ...She seems to be making progress; it looks like she enjoys carrying Lin Ziqin. :)Qu Zhi locked his phone screen.During the shoot on the set, Zheng Baozhu celebrated Lin Ziqin's birthday. Lin Ziqin came to visit today and brought a custom-made huge birthday cake and many snacks to treat the whole crew to a meal.Zheng Baozhu excitedly live-streamed in the group, \"Look, I thought only novels had such big cakes!\"Meng Yaxin: Wow, isn't it about ten meters? That's so extravagant!Zheng Baozhu: Exaggerated, but it's even bigger than my bed.Zheng Baozhu: There's so much food on set today! So much! All from Lin Ziqin! Is this the treatment of a top star?Cen Tongtong: Keep it up, Baozhu. Let Meng Yaxin give you a ten-meter cake in the future.Meng Yaxin: Wait until Baozhu becomes famous; then it won't be my turn!Zheng Baozhu: Thanks, I have material for tonight's dream. I'm going over to take photos; let's chat later!After saying that, Zheng Baozhu walked away with her phone. The director and producers were taking pictures with Lin Ziqin, and Zheng Baozhu joined them. When people noticed her, they praised her, \"Little sister, you're so pretty! Are you playing the role of Ye Ling?\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and nodded, \"Yes, yes!\"Lin Ziqin introduced, \"Let me introduce you all. This is Ye Ling in our crew. Recently, I've been filming with her. She's a newcomer, so everyone can pay more attention to her.\"With Lin Ziqin's introduction, everyone started praising Zheng Baozhu even more. He received top-star treatment in advance.To avoid delaying the filming schedule, the crew limited their leisure time. After lunch, the crew started cleaning up the set. Today, Zheng Baozhu ate the most and felt really full. Lin Ziqin was truly considerate, ordering a big and delicious cake. Zheng Baozhu ended up eating three pieces.Back at the hotel, she soaked her feet and browsed through today's Weibo. As expected, Lin Ziqin's birthday was trending on hot searches. On his birthday, Lin Ziqin not only visited the set but also announced several new endorsements, making it lively like a festive day.Feeling somewhat uneasy, Zheng Baozhu carefully checked the comments on the photos. They were all praising his appearance, which finally put her mind at ease.Lin Ziqin's birthday buzz continued until the next day and gradually subsided. Zheng Baozhu continued her regular filming on the set and finished the shooting one day earlier. On the day of the wrap, the crew prepared a bouquet of flowers and a small cake for her, and Gao Boyun even sent her a red envelope separately.\"Since the Chinese New Year is approaching, consider this an early Chinese New Year gift from me. I wish you great success in the coming year and a step forward in your career,\" Gao Boyun said while handing the red envelope to Zheng Baozhu.\"Thank you, Director Gao!\" Zheng Baozhu happily accepted the red envelope.When it was time to leave the set, Zheng Baozhu felt a bit reluctant. Although she had only been on the set for twenty days, the feeling was somewhat similar to graduating. Ye Ling's role didn't have much screen time, and other than the action scenes, the rest of the acting was within her grasp. However, this was her first significant role with a name and surname, and it was a grand wuxia IP, which made it a memorable experience.When she returned to the Starlight Farm, it was already late at night. Although she hadn't stayed in the room for a while, it was regularly cleaned, so there was almost no difference from when she left. She placed the two suitcases to the side, planning to tidy up tomorrow. After that, she treated herself to a bath and relaxed.Sitting on the couch with dry hair, Zheng Baozhu tried sending a message to Qu Zhi: \"Qu Zhi, are you still awake?\"Qu Zhi wasn't working at this moment, so he replied almost instantly: \"Not yet, what's up?\"Zheng Baozhu: I'm back. Are you free to come over and help me with a back massage?Qu Zhi was taken aback; earlier in the morning, Zheng Baozhu had posted a photo in the group, saying that she would be back tomorrow, so Qu Zhi was thinking of going to pick her up.Qu Zhi: Didn't you say you'll be back tomorrow?Zheng Baozhu: I thought about it and decided to come back today. It's good to be able to have a good night's sleep tomorrow!Qu Zhi: Oh\u2026 I'll come over now then.Zheng Baozhu: Great!Qu Zhi quickly tidied up a bit and went to Zheng Baozhu's room. When he approached, he realized the door was open. He pushed it slightly and looked inside, only to find Zheng Baozhu already lying on the couch.Qu Zhi: \"\u2026\"\"Qu Zhi?\" Zheng Baozhu heard someone approaching and turned to look, \"Just come in, and close the door behind you.\"\"\u2026\" Qu Zhi closed the door and sat down next to Zheng Baozhu. There was already a jar of medicinal wine on the coffee table, and Zheng Baozhu poured herself a glass before lying down on the couch, saying, \"I'm ready, you can start.\"\"\u2026\" Qu Zhi hesitated for a moment. Zheng Baozhu seemed so calm that if he thought more of it, it would make him seem quite impure. :\uff09Qu Zhi rolled up his shirt sleeves and began to massage Zheng Baozhu. This time, Zheng Baozhu didn't fall asleep and started chatting with him, \"By the way, it's almost Chinese New Year in a couple of days. My mom wants you to come to our house for dinner.\"Qu Zhi paused for a moment and then nodded, \"Yes, I heard Aunt Su mentioned it.\"\"Huh, so she informed you first and then told me?\" Zheng Baozhu complained, \"Are your parents not coming home for the New Year again this year?\"\"En,\" Qu Zhi said calmly, \"As long as they are together, anywhere is home.\"\"\u2026\"Zheng Baozhu fell silent for a moment, \"In that case, you seem a bit redundant?\"\"Yes.\"\"\u2026\"Answering so straightforwardly, what have you been through all these years?\"But for me, whether I spend the Lunar New Year at home or not doesn't make much difference, except that they always trouble Aunt Su.\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"My mom just likes a lively atmosphere and you know she has liked you since we were kids. It's natural for her to want you to spend the New Year with us.\"Qu Zhi continued massaging while saying, \"Aunt Su is indeed very warm-hearted.\"As he was speaking, someone knocked on the door twice, \"Miss Baozhu, I heard from the front desk that you're back?\"Wei Zhen's voice came from outside the door and Zheng Baozhu was taken aback for a moment. Subconsciously, she propped herself up and looked toward the door.\"Never mind, I'll go and open the door,\" Qu Zhi asked Zheng Baozhu to continue lying down and walked over to open the door for Wei Zhen.Wei Zhen saw the door open and was about to speak, but then he saw Qu Zhi standing inside the room. He was stunned for a moment and forgot what he was going to say.Now his mind was full of one thought: did he interrupt something intimate?Compared to him, Qu Zhi remained composed, \"Manager Wei, is there something you need?\"Wei Zhen snapped back to reality and smiled awkwardly, \"Nothing, I heard Miss Baozhu is back, and I wanted to discuss some work matters.\"With the approaching Chinese New Year, it was a busy time for the hotel, and Zheng Baozhu had been away, so he had been making many decisions by himself.\"It seems I wasn't thoughtful enough. Miss Baozhu must be tired just coming back. I'll come back tomorrow to discuss work,\" Wei Zhen said, and he politely closed the door behind Qu Zhi.Inside the room, Zheng Baozhu: \"\u2026\"She had a bad feeling that the group chat was going to explode with more than 999+ messages again tonight.Qu Zhi returned to the couch without changing his expression and sat down next to Zheng Baozhu, saying, \"Let's continue.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Half-propping herself with her arms, she turned to look at Qu Zhi, \"I think your words sounded quite ambiguous. Others might think we were doing something inside!\"\"\u2026\"Qu Zhi stood in place, silently looking at Zheng Baozhu for a moment, \"Is it possible that you're overthinking things?\"\"Heh, clearly, your words were vague,\" Zheng Baozhu tried to sit up from the couch, but her elbow slipped, and she was about to fall. Qu Zhi quickly reached out and caught her.\"Are you okay?\" Qu Zhi hugged Zheng Baozhu, helping her up slowly. Zheng Baozhu held her waist with one hand, her brows furrowing, \"My waist\u2026\"The fall just now made her already sore waist even worse.\"Did you twist your waist? Does it hurt here?\" Qu Zhi supported her with one hand and gently pressed the area around her waist.\"Hey, hey, hey, be gentle\u2026\" Zheng Baozhu grabbed Qu Zhi's arm, trying to sit up from the couch. Seeing this, Qu Zhi gently pressed her back down, \"Don't move, you might fall again. Let me help you up.\"Zheng Baozhu leaned on Qu Zhi's shoulder. When she lifted her head, her lips inadvertently brushed Qu Zhi's lips.Zheng Baozhu: \"\u2026\"Qu Zhi: \"\u2026\"Both of them froze abruptly and the room fell into complete silence. Zheng Baozhu felt like she couldn't hold back anymore. Oh my god, what did I just do?! Did I accidentally kiss Qu Zhi?!The hand on Qu Zhi's shoulder began to sweat and her mind was filled with \"I'm done, I'm done\".Although Qu Zhi's face showed no change and remained expressionless, the slight blush on his cheeks unintentionally revealed his true feelings at the moment.The two of them froze like this for two seconds. Zheng Baozhu seemed to forget about her waist pain as she pushed Qu Zhi away and sat on the couch, hugging her knees, \"Uh, well, I'm fine now, you can go back!\"\"\u2026Mm,\" Qu Zhi nodded somewhat unnaturally. He glanced at Zheng Baozhu once more and then turned and left the room. After he left, Zheng Baozhu finally relaxed, listening to the thumping sound of her heart, and slowly collapsed onto the couch.This was just an accident, Zheng Baozhu! Everyone is an adult; no one would take this seriously! Yeah!Zheng Baozhu mentally reassured herself, grabbed a piece of medicinal plaster, tore it open, and applied it to her waist before crawling into the blanket.After Qu Zhi returned to his room, he walked directly to the bathroom, turned on the tap in front of the sink, and splashed cold water on his face. The water was still gushing, and Qu Zhi supported himself with both hands on the sink, looking up at his reflection in the mirror.When Zheng Baozhu's lips brushed across Qu Zhi's lips, he realized that it felt so light, as if a feather gently brushed his heart. Unconsciously, he raised his hand and lightly touched his lips. After a moment, he snapped back to reality, turned off the tap, and walked out of the bathroom.Whether Qu Zhi slept well that night, Zheng Baozhu didn't know, but one thing was certain: Zheng Baozhu didn't sleep well.Throughout her life, she had never dated or pursued any male celebrities. She was a person who remained calm and composed. However, last night, she actually dreamt of kissing Qu Zhi!She knew Qu Zhi was toxic, but she didn't expect him to be so intoxicating!After all, she only accidentally brushed against his lips yesterday; surely it shouldn't have such an intense aftermath!Zheng Baozhu stared at the ceiling until dawn. :)She was afraid that if she closed her eyes, she would see herself kissing Qu Zhi again, and her heart couldn't handle that.To avoid recalling any unpleasant scenes every time she saw Qu Zhi's face, Zheng Baozhu stayed in her room these days, not going out at all. Even during meetings, she had Wei Zhen come up to her room to conduct them.The hotel staff had been talking; it seemed like Miss Baozhu had returned, but not completely.\"Qu Zhi, have you seen Zheng Baozhu these past two days?\" When Qu Zhi and Qi Sheng were having a meal together, Qi Sheng asked him. As soon as Qu Zhi heard Zheng Baozhu's name, he paused with his chopsticks and calmly shook his head. Qi Sheng clicked his tongue, \"What's going on? Liang Huihui said she hasn't left her room, and even her lunch is delivered directly by a robot.\"Qu Zhi said, \"She might be in seclusion.\"\"\u2026\"Was that so? It seemed like Miss Baozhu couldn't be understood using ordinary thinking, \"Are you still going to her house for the New Year's Eve dinner tomorrow? Will she come out of seclusion by then?\"Tomorrow was New Year's Eve, and after they finished work today, they would be able to enjoy a short break. Qu Zhi had mentioned before that Professor Qu and his wife were staying at the research institute this year and couldn't come back, so Qu Zhi had no choice but to go to Zheng Baozhu's house for dinner.When Qi Sheng heard the first half of Qu Zhi's answer, he felt sorry for him, but the second half made him feel like Qu Zhi's parents were planning ahead, trying to find a wife for him.Qu Zhi didn't answer him. After finishing his meal, he put down the chopsticks and picked up some tissues, \"I'm done eating. Take your time.\"\"Eh, you're done so quickly?\" Qi Sheng looked surprised.Qu Zhi lightly frowned, looking at him, he repeated that word, \"Quick?\"Qi Sheng: \"\u2026\"He remained silent for a while before looking at Qu Zhi and saying, \"You can drive now? When did you start getting into these worldly things?\"\u201c\u2026\u201d Qu Zhi pursed his lips and walked away. Qi Sheng quickly finished his food and followed him.When Qu Zhi returned in the evening, he passed by Zheng Baozhu's door and deliberately paused. The door was closed, and Qu Zhi lifted his hand to knock, but right before doing so, he stopped.His hand hesitated for a moment, then he withdrew it and returned to his room.The next morning, Su Mingxi started calling Zheng Baozhu, urging her to come back early and help make dumplings. Annoyed, Zheng Baozhu had no choice but to get up and freshen up.Considering that it was almost New Year's Eve, Zheng Baozhu deliberately chose a long red velvet dress and styled her hair with a red-themed scarf. Finally, she put on her favorite pearl necklace and earrings.After getting ready, she hesitated whether to inform Qu Zhi or not. Her mom had already asked him to come along, so if they were seen leaving separately later, her mom would definitely chatter endlessly.It was one thing on a regular day, but it was better to be amicable on New Year's Eve.As she was pondering, Qu Zhi sent her a message.Qu Zhi: Su Auntie just called me, asking us to come over early.Zheng Baozhu pursed her lips and replied: Okay, I'll leave after having lunch. I'll wait for you at the entrance.Qu Zhi looked at the message, typed a line in the chat box, considered it for a moment, then deleted it all, and finally responded with a simple \"Okay\".When Zheng Baozhu saw his message, she put down her phone and went to the front desk to arrange for the meal delivery.At noon today, Zheng Baozhu deliberately controlled her food intake, as she knew there would be many delicious dishes in the evening. She wanted to save some space for them. After sending a message to Qu Zhi, she picked up her bag and went downstairs to get her car.As the car drove from the garage to the hotel's entrance, Zheng Baozhu saw Qu Zhi coming out from inside.The two of them locked eyes; Zheng Baozhu subconsciously focused on Qu Zhi's lips.To be honest, Qu Zhi's lips were indeed very attractive; his jawline was smooth and beautiful. Although slightly thin, the shape was alluring, making one unable to resist wanting to taste him.So it wasn't surprising that she had that kind of dream; it just meant that maybe she needed to find a boyfriend! And it happened to be the time she had accidentally touched Qu Zhi's lips, so the person in her dream naturally had Qu Zhi's face.Everything made sense now.Zheng Baozhu averted her gaze, gave a wry smile, and said, \"Let's get in the car. If we're late, my mom will nag again.\"\"Okay,\" Qu Zhi nodded, also looking away, and opened the passenger door to get in.If Zheng Baozhu hadn't been lost in thought just now, she would have noticed the subtly astonished look in Qu Zhi's eyes. Her skin was naturally good, and under the setting of the bright red dress, it appeared even fairer and more radiant. The pearls on her neck and ears added a perfect touch to the red outfit, making her look elegant and charming.From a young age, Zheng Baozhu had liked this kind of jewelry-like dressing, but Qu Zhi used to sneer at it. Today, when he saw Zheng Baozhu sitting in the car, he was somewhat astonished.Zheng Baozhu didn't notice his emotions. After he fastened his seatbelt, she drove the car out. To avoid any awkwardness during the drive, Zheng Baozhu deliberately played a nostalgic song playlist.The playlist consisted of old songs, and the first one was Su Ming's [Beginnings].The warm and clear voice flowed through the car. When it sang, \"The day I met you, it seemed to fill the whole world\", it almost tainted the air with sweetness.As the song approached its end, Qu Zhi, who was sitting in the passenger seat, casually remarked, \"Is this Su Ming's song? It sounds good.\"Humming along to the melody, Zheng Baozhu glanced at him, chuckled lightly, and said, \"So Dr. Qu also enjoys popular songs like this?\"Qu Zhi also turned to look at her. \"In your impression, am I someone who always listens to opera?\"Shaking her head, Zheng Baozhu replied, \"In my impression, you have always been disconnected from the music.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi fell silent for a moment and said, \"Then this is an opportunity to get to know me again.\"With Qu Zhi's words, Zheng Baozhu felt a bit shy. When did she become so easily shy, even though she thought she had thick skin?Clearing her throat, she continued driving, and the playlist had already moved on to the next song, a soothing tune.And so, Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi listened to the songs all the way back from the park to their old residential area.Both the Qu and Zheng families still lived in the same neighborhood. Qu Zhi had been abroad for so many years and rarely returned, while Zheng Baozhu rarely came back after moving to the hotel. Zheng Baozhu found a parking space and parked the car, and they both got out of the car together.Qu Zhi had brought some gifts; he didn't come empty-handed. Zheng Baozhu thought that Dr. Qu was not as ignorant of social customs as she had imagined. They went upstairs together, and when Su Mingxi heard the knocking, she rushed over to open the door for them.\"You're here!\" Su Mingxi opened the door and greeted Qu Zhi with a smile, \"Qu Zhi, come in, come in. Why did you bring so many things? You really are too courteous!\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu followed Qu Zhi and changed into slippers, closed the door, and walked to the sofa. Su Mingxi noticed her sitting there and immediately started ordering, \"Baozhu, go wash your hands. I've kneaded the dough, you can start making dumplings. We'll cook and eat them tonight.\"\"...What about Qu Zhi?\"Su Mingxi replied, \"I haven't seen Qu Zhi in so many years. Can't I chat with him for a bit?\"\"That's fine,\" Zheng Baozhu said, \"Making dumplings requires using hands, not mouths. It won't delay your chat.\"\"...\"Su Mingxi sighed inwardly.Qu Zhi stood up, took off his coat, and placed it aside, \"I'll help out as well.\"\"Alright. Let me bring the ingredients out for you both to work here,\" Su Mingxi also stood up and went to the kitchen to prepare the ingredients.The dining table was cleared out, with Qu Zhi kneading the dough, while Zheng Baozhu was preparing the fillings. Zheng Baozhu looked at Qu Zhi kneading the dough and couldn't help but say to her mother, \"Mom, you said making dumplings starts with kneading the dough?\"Su Mingxi corrected her, \"I meant kneading the dough after mixing it.\"Zheng Baozhu felt a bit speechless, \"Why don't you just buy some pre-made dumpling wrappers?\"\"But where's the ritual in that? Aren't you young people all about rituals?\" Su Mingxi picked up the dough Qu Zhi was kneading and examined it, \"Look at how well Qu Zhi kneads the dough!\"Qu Zhi said, \"When I was studying abroad, I couldn't come back for the Lunar New Year, so we international students would gather together. We'd make dumplings and knead the dough ourselves; we got used to it.\"\"It's not easy studying abroad. Luckily, you made it through,\" Su Mingxi said, then pulled a chair and sat at the table, curious about Qu Zhi, \"Little Qu, tell Aunt Su, did you have any girlfriends while studying abroad?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu rolled her eyes, \"Mom, why are you so nosy?\"\"I'm not asking you. I'm asking Qu Zhi,\" Su Mingxi ignored Zheng Baozhu's remark and kept her eyes on Qu Zhi.Qu Zhi lightly coughed and said, \"No, I was busy with my studies there, I didn't have time for dating.\"\"Oh...\" Su Mingxi nodded thoughtfully, \"You're not that young anymore. Now that you're back in the country, how about I introduce you to someone?\"\"...Huh?\"\"It's Aunt Chen, who dances with us in the square. She has a niece who also studied abroad and just returned last year,\" Su Mingxi enthusiastically introduced, \"You two are about the same age, both studied abroad, and have common ground. Why not give it a try?\"\"Mom, are you talking about Yue Yue? She likes sports! Can you imagine Qu Zhi doing sports?\" Zheng Baozhu quipped as she continued mixing the filling.Su Mingxi gave her a look and retorted, \"Why not? I remember Qu Zhi was good in physical education when he was little and even won a championship on sports day, right?\"\"...\"Qu Zhi admired Aunt Su's memory and said, \"Now, the work at the lab is quite demanding, so I don't have much time for sports.\"\"It's alright. I also know another person, she graduated from a prestigious domestic university and now works as a teaching assistant at a school. She's also a scholar-type, so she won't find you boring!\" Su Mingxi said enthusiastically.Zheng Baozhu laughed, \"So, what will they talk about? Experimental data and research papers? Can they find common ground in that?\"\"Hey, Zheng Baozhu, why do you have so many opinions?\" Su Mingxi looked at her, \"I'm just trying to introduce a potential partner to Qu Zhi here. Why are meddling?\"\"Am I meddling? I'm just worried you might bring disaster to that poor girl!\" Zheng Baozhu teased.\"How is Qu Zhi a disaster to the poor girl? Come on, tell me, what's wrong with Qu Zhi?\" Su Mingxi said and then narrowed her eyes, studying Zheng Baozhu, \"Zheng Baozhu, don't tell me you've developed feelings for Qu Zhi?\"\"Me? Haha, cough, cough,\" Zheng Baozhu coughed twice in a row, her face turning slightly red with embarrassment, \"Hehe, this is the funniest joke I've heard all year!\"\"Heh, you can still laugh. But what about your own boyfriend? You also settled down with anyone yet?\" Su Mingxi said, lightly tapping the table, \"Perfect! While you're home these days, I'll arrange a blind date for you.\"\"Don't... You better continue trying to set up Qu Zhi!\"Qu Zhi glanced at them and told Su Mingxi, \"Aunt Su, I am indeed busy with work right now and not looking to date. Please don't bother anyone on my behalf.\"\"How is it bothering anyone? Don't listen to Zheng Baozhu's nonsense; that girl is really exceptional,\" Su Mingxi continued to persuade, \"Look at your parents; aren't they both scholars? Aren't they doing well?\"\"Uh...\" Qu Zhi nodded, \"Actually, the issue is, they are too perfect.\"Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but burst into laughter again.Su Mingxi looked over and scrutinized, \"Baozhu, don't tell me you've actually fallen for Qu Zhi? Back in the day, you used to curse him all the time. Now don't embarrass yourself.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu changed the subject and handed the chopsticks to her mother, \"Mom, come, taste this. Is the flavor good enough?\"\"Take it away, take it away. You taste it yourself.\"As Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu sat down to wrap dumplings, Zheng Baozhu's father also returned from work and joined them in the dumpling-making. To bring good luck, they even placed a coin in two dumplings.As they were bustling with preparations for the Chinese New Year feast, the official character posters for the main roles in the drama [New Moon Wuxin Sword] were officially released today, with Zheng Baozhu playing the role of Ye Ling prominently featured.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySu Mingxi prepared a large table of dishes today, including roast duck. Zheng Baozhu ate almost everything, but when the dumplings were cooked in the evening, she still sat at the table with a dipping dish and hadn't eaten a single one.Qu Zhi sat beside her and had just taken a bite of a dumpling when his expression changed slightly. He put the dumpling back in the bowl and used chopsticks to split it open, revealing a coin inside the filling.Seeing this, Su Mingxi happily said to him, \"It looks like little Qu Zhi will get rich next year.\"Zheng Baozhu rolled her eyes, looking enviously at the coin in Qu Zhi's dumpling. Qu Zhi noticed her gaze and asked, \"Do you want it?\"\"What are you so proud of!\"\"...I mean, if you want it, you can have this coin.\"\"You weren't this accommodating when you took my dream penthouse,\" Zheng Baozhu glared at him; Qu Zhi seemed to have a habit of pretending to be a good person in front of his mother!Qu Zhi couldn't argue about the house, so he remained silent. Su Mingxi, however, became interested in the topic, \"I heard from Baozhu that you bought a penthouse and have started the renovation?\"\"Yes, but I haven't had a chance to go there yet. The project manager is overseeing it for me.\"\"That won't do; the renovation process is quite complex. Each project needs to be carefully inspected after completion.\"After some thought, Qu Zhi nodded, \"You're right. Since I have a few days off during the Chinese New Year, I'll take the opportunity to go and see.\"Su Mingxi suggested, \"Take Baozhu with you; she has experience with renovations as she's done it several times.\"Qu Zhi glanced at Zheng Baozhu as if asking if she wanted to go with him. Zheng Baozhu didn't respond, Qu Zhi fell silent for a moment before asking again, \"Do you really not want the coin?\"\"No, I want to earn it myself!\" There were two dumplings with coins inside, so the other one would be her reward!When she was a child, Zheng Baozhu had studied the differences between dumplings with coins and regular ones to improve her chances of finding the lucky ones. Over time, she had developed a keen eye. Carefully examining the plate, she occasionally used public chopsticks to tap the dumplings. After a moment, she locked onto a target and used her chopsticks to pick it up.Everyone at the table stared, as though waiting to see if her method worked. Zheng Baozhu carefully took a bite of the dumpling and soon felt something hard in her mouth.\"Um!\" She lightly bit down and the coin came out of the dumpling.\"Hehe, see?\" Zheng Baozhu took the coin out and placed it on a tissue, saying, \"I told you I could find it myself.\"Su Mingxi chuckled from the opposite side, \"Of course! Since childhood, you've always been the expert at finding these things. No matter how well-hidden something shiny is, you can dig it out.\"Upon hearing this, Qu Zhi also laughed softly. Zheng Baozhu really had a talent for sniffing out secrets.Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow, accepting the praise gladly. She picked up her phone, saw a notification from the [Blind Date and Family] group, and promptly entered the chat.Her older cousin kept flooding the group with numerous red envelopes, and while the elders might not notice, Zheng Baozhu immediately caught on that she was intentionally trying to dominate the chat.Hmm, what kind of forbidden secrets are being shared up there? She should take a look.Bracing herself, she sent the message up and then saw her older cousin's first message in the group.Cousin: Baozhu, are you and Lin Ziqin acting in a TV drama together?!!! [Picture]When Zheng Baozhu saw that image, her heart almost stopped. It was directly taken from Weibo, complete with the watermark of [Zheng Baozhu as Ye Ling] from [New Moon Wuxin Sword].This promotional photo was even better than the one sent by Gao Boyun earlier, but now she had no interest in admiring her own appearance.The production crew unexpectedly released the promotional photo suddenly! And they even included her in it!No one else in the group said anything below that message, so the next one was still from her cousin.Cousin: Sorry, Yao Yao was playing with my phone just now.Because the message had been sent for several minutes already, there was no way to take it back. To salvage the situation, her cousin kept sending red envelopes non-stop, trying to push the message up.It was clear that she was trying her best.But during those few minutes, surely other people had seen it!\"Zheng Baozhu!\" Su Mingxi suddenly raised her voice and called out to Zheng Baozhu, nearly scaring her into throwing her phone. Guiltily locking her phone, she looked at Su Mingxi with an innocent expression, \"What?\"\"Take a look at what your uncle just sent me!\" Su Mingxi threw her phone onto the table, showing a magnified version of the photo she had just seen\u2014the promotional photo with Zheng Baozhu.Qu Zhi and Father Zheng also leaned over to look at the phone screen, and their faces changed.Father Zheng furrowed his brows slightly and looked at Zheng Baozhu, \"Baozhu, did you go into acting?\"\"Haha,\" Zheng Baozhu forced a smile and said, \"This person really looks a bit like me, doesn't she?\"\"Stop pretending! Your name is written right there!\"Zheng Baozhu trembled slightly under Su Mingxi's scolding and was suddenly reminded of that memory from third grade when Su Mingxi chased her and beat her up at the school gate.The phone placed on the table beeped three times in a row, all messages from her older cousin. Zheng Baozhu guessed her cousin probably wanted to remind her or cheer her on, but it was too late!She didn't dare to pick up her phone and instead kept an eye on her mother across the table, who might explode at any moment.\"You...\" Su Mingxi had just started to speak when Zheng Baozhu quickly pulled Qu Zhi in front of her as a shield.\"Mom, if you have something to say, say it nicely. It's New Year's, don't get upset,\" She hid behind Qu Zhi and swiftly spoke before hiding again. Su Mingxi squinted at her from the other side and slammed the table, exclaiming, \"Come out and stop hiding behind Qu Zhi. You dared to go into acting, what are you afraid of now, huh?\"Saying this, Su Mingxi went around the table, intending to catch Zheng Baozhu. However, Zheng Baozhu held onto Qu Zhi tightly and didn't let go, using him as a shield, \"Don't come near me!\"Su Mingxi furrowed her brow and said to Qu Zhi, \"Qu Zhi, move aside.\"Qu Zhi slightly pursed his lips and said, \"Aunt Su, if there's something, let's sit down and talk calmly. There's no need to get so upset.\"\"How can I not be upset? She's already acting in a drama!\" Su Mingxi said, then glanced at Qu Zhi as if sensing something, \"Qu Zhi, did you already know about this?\"Qu Zhi paused for a moment and nodded gently, \"Yes, I did know...\"\"Great, so now you're lying to me too!\" Su Mingxi was getting angrier and angrier, \"Qu Zhi, back then, when Baozhu wrote about her dream of becoming a star in her composition book, you were the first one to tell me. And now that you've grown up, why are you helping her deceive people?\"\"...\"Qu Zhi said, \"Aunt Su, I don't want to deceive you. What I did back then was wrong.\"\"You're doing something wrong now!\"\"...\"Qu Zhi now understood how Zheng Baozhu felt all those years, no wonder she held a grudge against him for so long. When Aunt Su got angry, she was genuinely scary.\"Qu Zhi, this matter has nothing to do with you. I won't argue with you for helping her lie to me. Now, step aside and let me talk to Zheng Baozhu properly.\"\"No, no, no,\" Zheng Baozhu clung to Qu Zhi's clothes as if he were a life-saving straw. Qu Zhi turned to look at her, but he still didn't move away, \"Aunt Su, I know this is your family matter and I shouldn't interfere as an outsider. But Zheng Baozhu and I grew up together, and I hope she could do what she likes and pursue her dreams.\"Zheng Baozhu looked up at Qu Zhi, her eyes filled with surprise.She didn't expect Qu Zhi to say such things.Su Mingxi paused her actions, her lips loosening, and then she looked at Qu Zhi, \"I also want to her do what she likes, but acting is out of the question! There are so many things in the world that you can do. Why do you have to choose acting? Even if I were to agree, would your grandfather and grandmother agree? Zheng Baozhu, your grandmother is old. If she sees this photo, do you think she'll be able to take it?\"Zheng Baozhu cautiously peeked out from behind Qu Zhi, looking at her mother, and said, \"So, you must never show that photo to Grandma!\"\"...Are you still trying to reason with me?\" Su Mingxi rolled up her sleeves and continued to try and grab Zheng Baozhu, \"Come out here!\"\"Qu Zhi, let's go!\" Zheng Baozhu quickly reached for her phone and then pulled Qu Zhi towards the door. They opened the door and rushed outside!Their escape seemed fluid and seamless.After rushing downstairs with Qu Zhi, Zheng Baozhu finally stopped and caught her breath. She looked back upstairs and said, \"My mom doesn't seem to be chasing us. We're safe for now.\"Qu Zhi stood beside her, his heart was also racing. He let out a light sigh and looked at Zheng Baozhu, asking, \"What do we do next? We can't keep avoiding Aunt Su forever.\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"She's still angry right now. Let's wait until she cools down, then we can talk to her calmly.\"Qu Zhi keenly grasped the point, \"We?\"Zheng Baozhu cleared her throat, glancing at him with a slight smile, \"With you by my side, my mom won't scold me as harshly.\"\"...I'm not so sure about that,\" He had experienced Aunt Su's power firsthand just now.\"Oh, I forgot to take my bag,\" Zheng Baozhu's car keys were in her bag, \"Luckily, I was quick enough to snatch my phone back; otherwise, I wouldn't be able to go anywhere.\"She opened the ride-hailing app and asked Qu Zhi beside her, \"Are you staying here tonight or going back to the hotel?\"Seeing her ordering a ride, Qu Zhi replied, \"Are you leaving? How about you stay at my place tonight? Tomorrow, after Aunt Su calms down, you can talk to her properly.\"Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment and then looked at Qu Zhi. He felt a bit uneasy under her gaze, and he coughed lightly, avoiding her eyes, \"There are two rooms at my place. You can sleep in my room, while I sleep in my parents' room.\"After a pause, he added, \"The room doors can be locked from the inside.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu put away her phone and said, looking at him, \"I was actually thinking, since nobody has been living at your place for so long, is there a thick layer of dust everywhere?\"\"No, my house gets regularly cleaned. We had it cleaned just before the New Year.\"\"Oh...alright then,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded and followed Qu Zhi toward his apartment building. The shadows of the two were stretched long under the streetlamp. Zheng Baozhu's voice sounded gently in Qu Zhi's ear, \"Do you have food in your home?\"\"...Didn't you just eat? You're still hungry?\"\"...Are you implying that I ate too much?\"Qu Zhi stayed silent for a couple of seconds and then said, \"Let's go buy some food then. I'm not sure if the convenience store near my home is open.\"Fortunately, on this Chinese New Year's Eve, the convenience store near their home was still open. The store's owner, Uncle Liu, also lived in the neighborhood and had been running this shop for over a decade.As Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu walked in, Uncle Liu recognized them immediately, \"Aren't you Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu? You're back for the New Year?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu greeted him with a smile and picked a few bottles of beer from the shelf. Qu Zhi saw that she only took alcohol and then picked up several bags of snacks. They both went to the cashier to pay.As Uncle Liu scanned their items, he teased, \"You two have a really good relationship. After so many years, you still come here to buy things together.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Uncle Liu, don't pretend like you haven't seen us argue before.\"I'll handle the payment,\" Qu Zhi took out his phone and scanned the QR code to pay. It was then that Zheng Baozhu noticed Qu Zhi wasn't wearing a jacket, only a thin sweater, and she tugged it down.\"Your jacket is still at my home,\" she said.Qu Zhi nodded and replied, \"I'll get it tomorrow.\"Zheng Baozhu didn't say anything more and followed him upstairs. Qu Zhi's home was indeed kept clean and tidy through regular cleaning. He fetched a pair of slippers for Zheng Baozhu and turned on the air conditioner in the room.Zheng Baozhu sat down on the sofa and opened a can of beer, taking a sip. Qu Zhi knew she wasn't feeling well, so he also sat down on the sofa and opened a can of beer.Seeing him open a can of beer, Zheng Baozhu was a bit surprised and said, \"I thought you hated drinking.\"\"It depends on who I'm drinking with.\"Her heart skipped a beat at his response, then she saw Qu Zhi take a sip of his beer.\"Thank you just now,\" Zheng Baozhu said with a can of beer in her hand. She took another sip and expressed her gratitude to Qu Zhi, \"It was supposed to be a peaceful Chinese New Year's Eve, but it turned out like this.\"Qu Zhi replied, \"It's okay. Originally, if Aunt Su didn't object, I would've been spending it alone.\"Zheng Baozhu chuckled lightly, \"That sounds kind of pitiful.\"Qu Zhi followed her lead and chuckled as well. Both of them fell silent for a moment, and then Zheng Baozhu spoke again, \"You mentioned earlier that I should do what I like and pursue my dreams. I was quite surprised by that. Regardless of whether you meant it or not, I appreciate it.\"\"I meant it,\" Qu Zhi said, looking at her, \"You and your aunt are two different people; you have the right to pursue your own life.\"Zheng Baozhu pursed her lips, staring at the beer can in her hand, \"When I was in my third year of high school, I thought the same way, which is why I bravely applied to the art school. But later, my grandmother pretended to be sick and was hospitalized. Almost the entire family was worried, and I realized I was too naive. They cared more about this matter than I had imagined. I thought that now that I'm an adult, and it has been so long since my aunt's incident, they would be more lenient, but it turned out to be the same. My mom is right; if my grandmother found out, she might really be upset enough to end up in the ICU.\"\"It won't be that serious,\" Qu Zhi saw a side of Zheng Baozhu he had never seen before and wasn't sure how to comfort her, \"Aunt Su said that your grandmother is quite lively.\"Zheng Baozhu chuckled, raised her hand, and took another sip of beer, \"You really can't comfort people properly.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"\"But my grandmother is indeed lively. I heard that not long ago, she wanted to become a volunteer in the community, but they wouldn't let her participate due to her age, and she even had an argument with them.\"Qu Zhi drained the beer in his hand and looked at her, \"So, things might not be as bad as you think. Tomorrow, talk to Aunt Su calmly.\"At Zheng Baozhu's home, Su Mingxi was still sitting on the sofa, looking at the drama stills of [New\u00a0Moon Wuxin Sword] on her phone. She found the show on Weibo and read the comments. This was a classic wuxia drama IP that naturally attracted a large audience. In addition to the popular male lead and well-known female lead, there was a cast of important supporting characters. Among them, only Zheng Baozhu was a pure newcomer, without even a Weibo account.However, amidst all the discussions, some netizens still noticed her and even created a comment thread, albeit at the bottom of the popular comments.\"You've been sitting there for a long time, what are you looking at?\" Father Zheng finished smoking a cigarette and walked back to the living room. Su Mingxi sat aside with disdain, not even bothering to look at him, and replied, \"I'm reading netizens' comments about Baozhu.\"\"Oh? What are they saying?\" Father Zheng also became curious.Su Mingxi said, \"They are praising her beauty and charisma, some are even asking for her Weibo account.\"\"That's true. Our Baozhu has always been beautiful,\" Father Zheng commented.\"She's too beautiful,\" Su Mingxi sighed, \"If she weren't this beautiful, maybe she wouldn't be so eager to become a star.\"Father Zheng sat there silently when Su Mingxi zoomed in on Zheng Baozhu's makeup photo and examined it closely, \"She really looks so much like Mingmei.\"Su Mingmei used to be their pride, because having a big star in the family made them the focus of attention, and many distant relatives, who were usually unrelated, liked to come and establish connections with them. Su Mingmei also had charisma; all the movies she starred in received awards and they used to attend every premiere. But everything changed after her suicide.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySu Mingmei has always been beautiful since childhood, and being the youngest in the family, she was the most spoiled. She was also intelligent and had\u00a0a natural talent for acting. At a young age, she left home to study acting and traveled all over the country with different drama crews. At that time, whenever there were TV programs or disc posters, the whole family would gather around the TV to watch, and they would buy a lot of them.After her suicide, all these things were packed away, and no one was interested in watching TV anymore. The whole family was enveloped in an invisible haze.No one ever mentioned that name again, as if this could make the pain go away.Su Mingxi always thought that Zheng Baozhu's desire to become a star was just a dream that all children had. Now, in retrospect, her persistence in wanting to piece together that torn composition probably foretold today's ending.\"Don't be too angry. It's the New Year, and the child has finally come back,\" Father Zheng sat on the side, trying to persuade Su Mingxi, \"Talk to Baozhu calmly tomorrow.\"Su Mingxi looked at the poster of Zheng Baozhu on her phone, \"What's the point of talking? Do you think she'll listen to us?\"Father Zheng sighed, \"The child has grown up and has her own ideas. What can we do about it? We can't tie her down at home, right?\"Su Mingxi raised her head to look at him, \"I think your approach is feasible.\"Father Zheng: \"...\"At Qu Zhi's home, Zheng Baozhu had already finished one can of beer and was reaching for another. Qu Zhi moved the beer aside, preventing Zheng Baozhu from getting it, \"Aren't you afraid of getting drunk?\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him and raised an eyebrow teasingly, \"You know my drinking capacity, right?\"Qu Zhi nodded slightly, \"Are you talking about the warrior incident?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu suddenly recalled some embarrassing moments, and her tone wasn't as confident as before, \"That was wine. Are you saying two cans of beer can make me drunk? You're underestimating me too much.\"\"Oh,\" Qu Zhi responded half-heartedly, but he didn't remove his hand from the beer can.Zheng Baozhu stood up and took a can of beer that was further away, tauntingly raising her eyebrow at Qu Zhi.Qu Zhi: \"...\"Isn't she trusting him too much?Zheng Baozhu didn't know the doubts in his heart and asked, \"Did you delete the video from last time?\"Qu Zhi looked at her, and the corners of his mouth slightly curved, but he didn't answer.Just as Zheng Baozhu was about to say something, Qu Zhi's phone rang. He glanced at the table; it was a video call from his mother.\"It's my mom,\" Qu Zhi said as he bent down to pick up his phone and answered the call, \"Mom.\"\"Little Zhi, Happy New Year!\" Qu Zhi's parents appeared on the screen, smiling and greeting him. Qu Zhi nodded and replied, \"Happy New Year to both of you too. How are you guys doing?\"\"We're doing well, don't worry. Take good care of yourself.\"\"Sure, I have experience with that.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"\"What are you having for dinner tonight?\" Father Qu didn't notice or pretended not to notice the hidden meaning in his words, and cheerfully asked, \"Are you having dumplings?\"\"Yes.\"\"Huh?\" Mother Qu noticed something was off, \"Aren't you at Aunt Su's place? Why are you at home?\"\"Right,\" Father Qu also noticed the video background was his own home, \"You came back home so early? We were hoping for you to visit Aunt Su and celebrate the New Year together.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi remained calm, trying to figure out how to explain to them. At that moment, Qu Zhi's sharp-eyed mother noticed something unusual again, \"Is that Baozhu sitting next to you? Baozhu is also at our house?\"Upon hearing Mother Qu's words, Zheng Baozhu leaned over and said, \"Uncle Qu, Aunt Qu, Happy New Year!\"\"Happy New Year to you too! Baozhu is becoming more and more beautiful!\"\"Exactly!\"\"No, no, you both are looking younger and beautiful!\"\"Hahaha, Baozhu, you still have a way with words,\" Mother Qu laughed a few times and then hesitated before asking, \"What about you and Qu Zhi...\"\"Oh, we just finished dinner at my place. We felt too full, so we went downstairs for a walk, and then we thought of checking in with you guys,\" Zheng Baozhu half-truthfully explained, fearing they might misunderstand.\"Oh...\" Qu Zhi's parents seemed to misunderstand something as they smiled and said, \"In that case, we won't disturb you. Hang up now!\"As soon as they finished speaking, the video call was disconnected.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Looking at the darkened screen in silence for two seconds, Zheng Baozhu raised her head and looked at Qu Zhi, \"I think your parents misunderstood something.\"\"...Yeah.\"\"...Just 'yeah'?\"Qu Zhi put away his phone, stood up, and said to Zheng Baozhu, \"It's getting late, I'll take care of the remaining beers. You finish this one and get some rest. Tomorrow, I'll accompany you to meet Aunt Su.\"\"Oh, okay,\" Zheng Baozhu watched him hurriedly leave, feeling a bit puzzled as she took a sip of her beer.Qu Zhi brought the beers into his room, afraid that Zheng Baozhu might drink more. After a moment, he came back with a set of clean sleepwear, \"This is my mom's, it's clean. You can wear it for tonight.\"\"Alright.\"\"These are towels, brand new,\" Qu Zhi said, placing everything on the couch before turning back to his room. Zheng Baozhu looked at him closing the door and chuckled to herself.After finishing the beer, Zheng Baozhu took the things Qu Zhi gave her and went to freshen up. Although the apartment had two bathrooms, they were separate and not connected to the bedrooms. Zheng Baozhu changed into her sleepwear and came out of the bathroom. She glanced at Qu Zhi's room. The door was closed, but the light inside was still on, indicating that he hadn't gone to bed yet.Zheng Baozhu felt like he was waiting for her to freshen up first before he did.She smiled and walked to the other room, closing the door behind her.Qu Zhi heard the sound of the door closing and came out with a towel from his room. Zheng Baozhu was inside his room, admiring his trophies and certificates, when she heard the faint sound of running water from outside.The sound wasn't particularly loud, but it was especially noticeable in the quiet evening. A few years ago, when fireworks and firecrackers were still allowed in the city, the outside would be very noisy at this time. However, now the neighborhood was much quieter, with only occasional barking from dogs.The rushing water sound entered Zheng Baozhu's ears, seemingly neither near nor far but impossible to ignore. She stood there listening to the water for a while and then the sound suddenly stopped. Zheng Baozhu looked toward the door and opened it slightly to peek outside.Qu Zhi came out of the bathroom, water still on his hair, and saw Zheng Baozhu sneakily looking around.He froze for a moment, subconsciously used the towel to cover himself, meeting Zheng Baozhu's gaze, \"What are you doing?\"Zheng Baozhu blinked, then walked out of the room, \"Nothing, just wanted to get some water.\"Saying that, she intentionally glanced at Qu Zhi's unfastened collar, \"What are you hiding? We've been friends for so long, just be honest.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"He felt like Zheng Baozhu might be a bit drunk again. :)\"I suddenly remembered, didn't you set up a gym at home? You said you exercise regularly and that you have a good physique,\" Zheng Baozhu looked him up and down, \"But you didn't say the same thing to my mom today. Are you lying to me?\"\"...You've had too much to drink,\" Qu Zhi stood still, his tone somewhat stiff.\"Just a little beer,\" Zheng Baozhu didn't take the alcohol seriously.Qu Zhi looked at her, \"When you took the beer, I checked, it has a high alcohol content.\"\"It's nothing special,\" Zheng Baozhu continued to scrutinize him, \"You're changing the subject. Is it because I hit the nail on the head? Dare to show me how good your physique really is?\"\"...\"He didn't dare to answer.\"Weren't you saying you wanted water?\" Qu Zhi raised his hand and pointed in the direction of the kitchen, \"There's bottled water in the fridge, but it's cold. If you want some, you can warm it up first.\"\"Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded and walked in the direction he pointed. However, as she passed by him, she suddenly stumbled.\"Oops.\" Zheng Baozhu let out a cry and fell towards Qu Zhi. He instinctively reached out to catch her. Zheng Baozhu was caught by him, and when she raised her head, she saw a large area of his chest and abdomen.\"...\"The room seemed even quieter than before. Qu Zhi realized something and tried to let go of Zheng Baozhu, but just before he released his grip, Zheng Baozhu raised her hand and accurately placed it on his chest.Thump, thump \u2013 it seemed that he had indeed been exercising regularly.Qu Zhi froze for a moment, then abruptly let go of her hand, stepping back two steps as if Zheng Baozhu was some kind of fierce flood.Zheng Baozhu stood upright, looking in the direction of Qu Zhi, and smiled, \"You were right, you are indeed better than Lin Ziqin.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi fell silent for a moment, staring at her, \"You still remember Lin Ziqin?\"\"Of course, he was even in a movie with me!\" Speaking of filming, Zheng Baozhu remembered the incident with her mom discovering the stills from today, \"Oh no, my mom found out about my acting! What do I do?\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"He felt that he really couldn't let Zheng Baozhu drink anymore. On the surface, she seemed normal, but no one knew what she might do next.\"Drink some water and go to bed early,\" Qu Zhi quickly said this sentence, bypassing Zheng Baozhu, and went back to his room, locking the door behind him....Who would have thought that he would be the one locking the door in the end? :)Zheng Baozhu went to the kitchen and opened the fridge, and sure enough, she found bottled mineral water. Without heating it, she directly opened the bottle and took a sip.The cold water made her feel a little more comfortable. After closing the fridge, she carried the water back to her room.The next morning, Zheng Baozhu woke up groggily with a slight headache. Blaming herself for drinking such high-alcohol drinks last night, but then she thought, how could she choose low-alcohol drinks to drown her sorrows?It's a pity she had a good tolerance and she wouldn't easily get drunk.After taking a shower last night, she felt a bit feverish, so she went out to get a bottle of water. She turned her head to take a look and the water was still there on the bedside table.But it seemed like something had happened in between?She pondered for a moment and lightly touched her right hand.Wait, this feeling... She lifted her hand, incredulously staring at her palm.Did she use this hand to... Qu Zhi yesterday??...No, it must be an illusion. She has always had good alcohol tolerance.Zheng Baozhu convinced herself like that, changed into her own clothes, and went out to freshen up. When she opened the door, she noticed some noises coming from the kitchen. Out of curiosity, she walked over and saw Qu Zhi preparing breakfast.Looking at him with some surprise, she asked, \"You can cook?\"Qu Zhi heard her voice, turned his head, and glanced at her with a slight glimmer in his eyes, \"Awake?\"\"Mhm,\" Zheng Baozhu approached and looked into the pot that was being cooked, \"Are you making tangyuan?\"\"Yes, it's the only frozen food we have at home, so we'll just make do with it.\"\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu withdrew her gaze, \"I didn't think you could cook.\"Qu Zhi fell silent for a moment, then spoke to defend himself, \"I've been able to cook since junior high school. I've become even better during the years I studied abroad.\"Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but laugh at his earnest expression, \"Really? Then I'll have to see Chef Qu's skills someday.\"After teasing Qu Zhi, she went to freshen up and put on makeup, and when she appeared in the living room again, she was the elegant Zheng Baozhu.\"Be careful, it's hot,\" Qu Zhi sat opposite her and reminded her, \"After eating, let's go see Aunt Su.\"Mentioning going to see Su Mingxi, Zheng Baozhu still felt uneasy. Seeing her frown slightly, he reassured her, \"Don't worry, I'm on your side.\"This statement seemed to have some magic, calming Zheng Baozhu's nerves instantly.Yes, she wasn't fighting alone; she had friends supporting her.After finishing the tangyuan, Zheng Baozhu took her phone and returned home with Qu Zhi. Su Mingxi seemed to know they were coming and had been sitting on the sofa waiting for them. She appeared calmer today and didn't start scolding as soon as she saw Zheng Baozhu.Zheng Baozhu cleared her throat and called out, \"Mom.\"\"You finally remember I'm your mom?\" Su Mingxi looked at her, \"Let's not waste time with the small talk and get straight to the point.\"As soon as Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi sat down on the sofa, Su Mingxi said to Zheng Baozhu, \"Regarding that movie, since it's already filmed, there's nothing I can do about it. But let's put an end to this matter. You have fulfilled your dream, so from now on, focus on doing other things.\"Zheng Baozhu knew it wouldn't be that easy, but she didn't plan to back down today, \"Mom, do you think my dream is just child's play? Like playing house? You think it's enough for me to stop there, but I don't think so. When I said I wanted to be a star, I meant it seriously.\"Su Mingxi clenched her jaw, of course, she knew it was serious, but precisely because she knew it was serious, she had to firmly cut off such thoughts.\"You've made the movie, what else do you want? Do you have to see your grandma end up in the hospital before you'll be willing to settle down?\"Zheng Baozhu furrowed her brows and remained silent for a moment. The incident of her aunt's suicide hurt her grandma the most, and there was no way to make her grandma forget it ever happened. But what was her fault in all this?Thinking that she had to keep her dreams hidden in her heart since she was young, not daring to tell anyone, Zheng Baozhu also felt aggrieved. \"Mom, I know you can't forget what happened to Aunt, but why do you have to punish me based on Aunt's incident? I know what I'm saying might sound selfish, but in my senior year of high school, I already gave up my dream because of you all. Now, can't you make some concessions for me?\"Hearing this, Su Mingxi's eyes turned slightly red. In her senior year of high school, Zheng Baozhu gave up on taking the art exam, and that night, they heard her crying in her room.They all heard it.They knew it was unfair to Zheng Baozhu, but it was a thorn in everyone's heart that they carefully avoided so they could continue living.Choking up a bit, Su Mingxi looked at Zheng Baozhu and said, \"Baozhu, we don't want you to go into acting, not just because of the fear of mentioning Mingmei, but also because we're worried you might end up like her... From your grandfather's words, actors are all lunatics, and they might lose touch with what's real and what's just a performance.\"\"I admit that some good actors may have difficulty stepping out of their roles, but not everyone would do something extreme,\" Zheng Baozhu replied to her mother, \"My first lesson from my teacher was about drawing the line between acting and reality.\"Su Mingxi raised her eyebrows, \"What? You even got yourself a teacher? It seems like you really want to make a big splash in the entertainment industry?\"\"...\"Tears welled up in Zheng Baozhu's eyes, \"What's wrong with having a teacher?\"\"Fine, I've said everything I needed to say. I won't agree if you continue acting. Before this matter reaches your grandma's ears, I have to resolve it,\" Su Mingxi said, then moved a chair and sat down, blocking the doorway. She continued, \"I'll sit here until you've thought it through. No one is leaving through this door.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"While the three of them were in a standoff, Zheng Baozhu's phone started ringing. She picked it up and saw that it was Gao Boyun calling.Glancing at Su Mingxi, who looked like a door god guarding the entrance, Zheng Baozhu went into another room and answered the phone, \"Director Gao, what's up?\"\"Baozhu, Happy New Year!\" Gao Boyun sounded cheerful on the other end, \"Did you see the stills that were released yesterday? Everyone has given you great feedback. By the way, how come you don't even have a Weibo account? Hurry up and open an actor's Weibo.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu took a deep breath and yelled into the phone, \"Are you serious? How can you not inform me in advance when you release my stills? My family has seen the photos! Now my mom won't even let me leave the house!\"Gao Boyun was a bit flustered by this barrage of complaints, \"Hold on, why won't your mom let you go out?\"\"What do you think? You know my aunt is Su Ming, right? My aunt is my mom's sister, her real sister! The thing they hate the most is the entertainment industry, especially actors!\"Gao Boyun: \"...\"\"What should I do now?\"\"...\"Gao Boyun scratched his head, feeling troubled, \"Ah, I didn't expect this. My dad didn't mention it to me either. I even said we'll have you come back after the holiday to shoot another scene, but now you can't come?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"My mom is like Guan Gong standing at the door, she's just one big sword short.\"\"...\"Gao Boyun pondered for a moment and said, \"Then give me your home address, and I'll personally go and persuade Auntie?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn't take long to arrive at the building and followed the information she gave to find her unit.Su Mingxi was still sitting at the door, with no sign of softening her attitude. Zheng Baozhu peeled a tangerine for herself and glanced up at Su Mingxi, saying, \"Mom, aren't you eating? Want to have a tangerine?\"\"I'm not eating!\" Su Mingxi stared back, coldly sneering, \"Hmph, it's amazing that you can still eat.\"As Zheng Baozhu was about to feed her a piece of tangerine, she slurred her words a bit and said, \"It's your choice to sit there. Nobody forced you.\"Su Mingxi clicked her tongue and cursed Father Zheng in her mind. She knew he wouldn't come up with any good solutions!Just as she was thinking about that, someone knocked on the door twice from outside. Su Mingxi didn't even stand up, she just turned her head and asked, \"Who is it?\"A young male voice sounded from outside the door, \"Auntie, I've come to see Zheng Baozhu.\"Su Mingxi turned her head to look at Zheng Baozhu, her eyes scrutinizing, \"You've brought in reinforcements?\"\"No, it's just a friend who came to visit during the New Year.\"\"What friend? A boyfriend?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu fell silent. Gao Boyun was still outside knocking on the door, \"Auntie, could you please open the door? I've come to wish you a Happy New Year.\"Only then did Su Mingxi stand up and peeked through the peephole. Outside the door stood a young man. Although he wasn't as handsome as Qu Zhi, he looked neat and comfortable. His demeanor was better than most people, and unlike some others of his age, he seemed to care about the quality of life and had decent financial conditions.\"When did you meet him?\" Su Mingxi turned back to look at Zheng Baozhu.Zheng Baozhu replied vaguely, \"Just recently.\"Su Mingxi looked at him for a while, slightly moved the chair, opened the door, and Gao Boyun handed a gift box to her before entering, \"Auntie, Happy New Year. Sorry for disturbing.\"Because the chair was blocking the door, it only opened halfway. Gao Boyun sidestepped to get inside, smiling, and greeted Su Mingxi. Zheng Baozhu saw that he was still holding the gift and thought to herself that Gao Boyun truly lived up to his reputation as a director. Despite the unexpected situation, he remembered to bring a gift thoughtfully.Su Mingxi took the gift from Gao Boyun and placed it on the floor. After closing the door, she moved the chair back to its original position and sat down again.Gao Boyun observed this series of actions and awkwardly said, \"Auntie, what's this all about?\"Su Mingxi said, \"I'm just tidying up the place. Your timing is a bit unfortunate.\"\"Hahaha,\" Gao Boyun laughed dryly and looked at Su Mingxi, \"Auntie, you have a good sense of humor. It's the New Year, it's auspicious to be in a good mood.\"Su Mingxi looked up and carefully examined him, \"You are Baozhu's friend?\"\"Yes,\" Gao Boyun replied and then glanced at Qu Zhi, who was sitting on the sofa, folding his legs casually while peeling an orange. When he noticed Gao Boyun looking at him, he raised his eyes slightly and met his gaze.Gao Boyun's expression froze for a moment. Qu Zhi's gaze was somewhat sharp, it didn't seem very friendly.He chuckled twice, thinking that he had indeed walked into a difficult situation today, \"This gentleman is Baozhu's old classmate, right? You two... are meeting the parents?\"Zheng Baozhu pulled the corner of her mouth, remembering their conversation in the car that day, \"He lives in this neighborhood, he is very close to my parents since elementary school.\"\"Oh...\" Gao Boyun nodded slowly and then swept his gaze between the two. Su Mingxi asked him, \"Where did you get to know Baozhu? Why have I never heard her mention you?\"\"Oh, let me explain, Auntie, I am a director...\"\"A director?\" Su Mingxi raised her voice even before Gao Boyun finished speaking, \"Then why are you here in our home?\"Due to Su Mingxi's strong presence, Gao Boyun subconsciously took a step back and smiled, \"Auntie, please don't get upset. I'm here today just to talk to you about Zheng Baozhu.\"\"What does Baozhu's matter have to do with you?\" Su Mingxi said, and then realized something, \"I get it. The film Baozhu starred in, it's directed by you, isn't it?\"\"Indeed, it's me...\"\"Then you can leave. We have nothing to talk about!\" Su Mingxi directly issued him an eviction order.Gao Boyun hesitated and didn't leave, saying, \"Auntie, I know about your family's situation...\"\"What do you know?\" Su Mingxi's sharp gaze swept over him.Gao Boyun took another step back and looked completely different from the decisive director on the set, \"I heard my dad talking about some things from the past...\"Su Mingxi furrowed her eyebrows, \"Your dad? Who is your dad?\"\"My dad is Gao Tianming, I am Gao Boyun, and I am also the director of [New Moon Wuxin Sword],\" Gao Boyun realized that Su Mingxi didn't interrupt him this time, so he continued to speak non-stop, \"Although I am still a newcomer as a director, I believe in my eye for talent. When I first saw Zheng Baozhu in the film studio, I thought she had a unique aura, and her appearance was excellent. She has great potential as an actress. Although she played a small supporting role in [New Moon Wuxin Sword], I'm already working on preparing a new TV drama, and I intend to invite her to be the lead...\"When Su Mingxi heard that Gao Boyun's father was Gao Tianming, she was stunned, and she didn't really listen to what he said afterward. It wasn't until Gao Boyun's buzzing voice disappeared from her ears that her focus returned. She looked at the young man in front of her and asked, \"Your dad is Gao Tianming? The director of [Spring No More]?\"\"Yes...\" Gao Boyun nodded, intending to continue speaking, but Su Mingxi suddenly stood up from her chair. The three people in the room stared curiously as Su Mingxi went to the side and returned with a big broom in her hand.\"Your dad is Gao Tianming, right?\" Su Mingxi said, brandishing the broom at Gao Boyun, who quickly ducked away, clutching his head to dodge the imminent attack.\"No, Auntie, let's talk calmly!\" Gao Boyun, holding his head, scurried around the living room, looking as disheveled as Zheng Baozhu did back in elementary school, holding his head and running.Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi reacted quickly and moved forward to stop Su Mingxi, \"Mom, let's talk calmly. Please put down the broom first!\"Su Mingxi's face turned red, but even when someone held her back, she still held the broom and waved it in the air, \"I have nothing to say to him! He dares to come to our home to find you? It was because of acting in Gao Tianming's film that Mingmei committed suicide back then, and now his son is here to get someone from our family to act again! Do we owe the Gao family something? You're looking down on our family, aren't you?!\"\"Auntie, it's a misunderstanding, really!\"\"There's no misunderstanding! Get out of here!\"\"Alright, I'm leaving immediately! Please don't be upset!\" Gao Boyun, clutching his head, hurriedly ran past the living room, pushed the chair, opened the door, and rushed outside. Su Mingxi followed and slammed the door shut with a bang, then returned to her seat.Still holding the broom that had just struck Gao Boyun, she looked like Guan Yu.Gao Boyun hadn't expected Zheng Baozhu's mother to be so fierce and he was completely taken aback. He paced back and forth outside the door before finally taking out his phone and calling Gao Tianming, \"Dad, I've run into some trouble. It might require your help to resolve it.\"\"...\"Gao Tianming remained silent for a while before speaking, \"Are you going to ask me to some help you out from the police station? Gao Boyun, you are old enough now. Solve your own problems.\"\"What you said doesn't even make sense! I've only been in trouble once, and you're going to remember it forever?\"\"Well, you deserved it.\"\"...\"Gao Boyun sighed, calming himself down before speaking again, \"I called you today for a serious matter. We released the still photos of the drama yesterday; it turns out Zheng Baozhu's family saw them. I didn't expect them to be so opposed to her acting that she's now being confined at home by her mother. I thought I could persuade her mother, but it turned out...\"\"You got beaten up?\"\"...\" Gao Boyun paused for a moment, \"How do you know?\"Gao Tianming also paused, \"Because I was almost beaten up by them back then.\"When he said \"almost\", it was because he was lucky it happened during Su Ming's funeral. If it weren't for the sake of not causing a scene, he would have been kicked out long ago.After Gao Tianming finished speaking, there was silence on Gao Boyun's end for a while before he spoke again, \"So, it's useless for you to go there, right?\"After thinking for a moment, Gao Tianming replied, \"It's true that going there won't be appropriate. You come back first, I'll find a way to resolve this.\"\"What can you do?\"Gao Tianming said, \"Find a more suitable person.\"Back in the room, Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi sat back in the living room, and for a while, no one spoke. Su Mingxi's chest was still heaving; it seemed that she was truly furious earlier.[Spring No More] was the last movie Su Ming starred in, where she portrayed an unsuccessful painter. The painter's life could be described as tragic - an unfortunate year brought irresponsible parents, and painting was the only thing that could heal her. However, when she grew up, she realized that her paintings were worthless and not appreciated by the market. Later, when she finally found someone who appreciated her work, they spent some happy times together, but that man turned out to be married, and everything he said was a lie. The painter ultimately lost faith in the world and chose to end her life by taking poison during that bright spring.When the movie was released in theaters, many people were moved to tears by Su Mingmei's exquisitely delicate performance.Tragedies always shook people's hearts more than comedies.But not long after, Su Mingmei herself committed suicide.No one could say that this incident had nothing to do with her acting in that movie.Does embodying a role so vividly also mean losing oneself? Just like Su Mingmei, Zheng Baozhu was equally exquisite and powerful. Even the director said she had a unique aura. However, precisely because of this, they couldn't allow Baozhu to act again.If something like that happened in their family again, no one could bear it.\"Mom,\" Zheng Baozhu cautiously called out to Su Mingxi. Su Mingxi looked over, and Zheng Baozhu trembled slightly but smiled and said, \"It's getting late now; we should start making lunch.\"\"Hmph,\" Su Mingxi snorted coldly, looking at her, and said, \"You're still thinking about eating? Yesterday's leftovers are enough; you can just reheat them for lunch.\"\"But most of yesterday's leftovers are preserved dishes. It's better to make a couple of fresh dishes, right? Plus, we're out of rice, so we'll have to cook some, won't we?\"\"If you want to cook, then cook yourself. Don't play any tricks in front of me.\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu smiled and said, \"Alright, I'll do it myself. Today, let me show you my cooking skills.\"Zheng Baozhu entered the kitchen as she spoke, and Qu Zhi followed. Wearing an apron, Zheng Baozhu glanced at him, \"Why did you come in too?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"I'll help you with some prep work.\"\"No need,\" Zheng Baozhu looked towards her mom and said to Qu Zhi, \"Why don't you go out and have a heart-to-heart talk with my mom? You know she has liked you since we were kids. Maybe if you chat with her, you can convince her about the acting issue.\"\"...I think that's unlikely,\" he felt that Zheng Baozhu was being overly optimistic, \"But I can go talk to her again.\"\"In that case, my future will be in your hands!\"\"...\" Qu Zhi hesitated slightly, showing a hint of discomfort. Zheng Baozhu, who was accustomed to seeing his emotionless face, noticed the subtle change and asked, \"What's wrong?\"\"...Nothing,\" Qu Zhi said, then turned and left the kitchen.While Qu Zhi talked with Su Mingxi, Zheng Baozhu cooked the meal and prepared two dishes. As she was setting the dishes on the table, her phone vibrated. She took out her phone and saw a message from Gao Boyun.Gao Boyun: How are things now?Zheng Baozhu: Qu Zhi is having a heart-to-heart talk with my mom, while I'm cooking in the kitchen. Are you back home?Gao Boyun: I'm still at your doorstep.Zheng Baozhu: \u03a3(\u2299\u25bd\u2299) You haven't left yet?Gao Boyun: No, I thought with your mother's fiery temper, if things escalate, I can lend a hand from outside.Zheng Baozhu: ...Aren't you feeling cold?Gao Boyun: I can say that I'm both cold and miserable. \u00a0I have never been so humble in my life.Zheng Baozhu: ...I'll let my mom know, so you can come in and have lunch.After sending the message, Zheng Baozhu walked out of the kitchen, smiling at Su Mingxi, then leaned over to whisper to Qu Zhi, \"How did your talk go?\"Qu Zhi also whispered back, \"I didn't fully convince her, but Aunt Su's mood has improved a bit.\"\"That's good. It's already a small victory at this stage,\" Zheng Baozhu said to him, then sweetly called out to Su Mingxi, \"Mom.\"Su Mingxi felt goosebumps rising and looked at Zheng Baozhu warily, not knowing what new idea she had come up with, \"If you have something to say, just say it.\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"Gao Boyun, the one you almost drove away, is still waiting outside. Why don't you let him come in and have lunch too? It's the New Year, and the poor child is outside all alone, feeling cold and miserable.\"Su Mingxi was about to speak when Zheng Baozhu quickly continued, \"I know you have issues with Director Gao Tianming, but he's just a director, and making movies is his job. Can we solely blame him for Aunt's situation? Even if Director Gao is partly responsible, it has nothing to do with his son. At that time, Gao Boyun was just a child; he knew nothing about it. Look, you've already given him a beating; how about letting him have a warm meal? Besides, he's just a kid.\"\"...\"Su Mingxi fell silent for a moment. Sometimes she felt that Baozhu was so much like Mingmei, but at other times, they seemed completely different.If Mingmei had even half of Baozhu's eloquence, she wouldn't have been bullied and come home crying to their big brother when they were young.\"Fine, if you want him to have lunch, then let him eat,\" Su Mingxi finally made a concession, \"Anyway, I would feed a stray dog I saw on the street too.\"\"Okay then,\" Zheng Baozhu smiled, \"Would you please move aside so I can open the door for him?\"\"No need, I'll do it,\" Su Mingxi was afraid she might escape again, so she added a warning, \"You go back to the kitchen and continue cooking. I'll open the door for him. Just to be clear, after the meal, he has to leave, or don't blame me if I hit him again.\"\"Alright, alright,\" Zheng Baozhu took her phone and returned to the kitchen to send a message to Gao Boyun, \"Congratulations, the Empress Dowager has agreed to open the door and serve you some porridge.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She hadn't expected this young man to be so persistent.Upon hearing the sound of the door opening, Gao Boyun quickly looked up and greeted Su Mingxi with a smile, \"Hello, Auntie.\"Su Mingxi nodded casually and said to him, \"Come in.\"\"Thank you, Auntie!\" Gao Boyun hurriedly went inside, afraid that if he hesitated for a second, Su Mingxi might change her mind.After sitting down at the dining table, Zheng Baozhu came out holding the freshly cooked dishes. Placing the dishes on the table, she took a glance at Gao Boyun. His ears were red from the cold.\"Have some rice soup; it's hot,\" Zheng Baozhu said as she picked up a thermos filled with rice soup and poured half a bowl for Gao Boyun.Rice soup and rice wine looked somewhat similar, and Gao Boyun hadn't had rice soup in a long time. \"You're so cultured, even making rice soup.\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"Our hotel's restaurant specializes in farmhouse cuisine, and the rice we serve is steamed white rice, so of course, we have rice soup.\"Gao Boyun had heard before that Zheng Baozhu had a hotel, but he hadn't asked for more details. Now, he just learned that the hotel's specialty was farmhouse cuisine, \"Did you also make steamed white rice today?\"\"Yes, paired with our hotel's signature dishes,\" Zheng Baozhu pointed to the two dishes she had just served, \"This is Bean Curd Beef and this is Double Pepper Pork Liver. They are both masterpieces from me and the head chef. You've come to the right place today.\"Gao Boyun looked at the well-prepared dishes; they were well-presented, showing some culinary skills, \"I really couldn't tell that you can cook.\"\"Heh,\" Zheng Baozhu chuckled, \"I know, you ordinary folks have biases against us. You think we can't do anything except seduce men.\"\"...I didn't say that.\"\"I won't argue with you; let's eat,\" Zheng Baozhu went into the kitchen and brought out the rice, \"Help yourselves to rice since we have rice soup, I didn't cook any other soup.\"Seeing Qu Zhi also come over from the living room, Zheng Baozhu called out to Su Mingxi, \"Mom, come and eat too. Don't worry; I won't run away.\"\"...\" After going through all this trouble in the morning, Su Mingxi naturally gave in. She moved the chair away from the door, walked over, and sat down at the dining table, \"Let's all use chopsticks; the dishes should cool down a bit.\"With that said, everyone picked up their chopsticks and started eating. Most of the dishes on the table were leftovers from yesterday's preserved vegetables. Everyone naturally wanted to taste the two dishes cooked by Zheng Baozhu.However, the dish Bean Curd Beef had a lot of red oil in it, making it look fiery red. Gao Boyun hesitated for a moment and moved his chopsticks to the Double Pepper Pork Liver. This dish didn't seem spicy, but it contained a lot of chopped green peppers and small chili peppers.Zheng Baozhu noticed that Gao Boyun shook off all the chili peppers from the pork liver and couldn't help but correct him, \"The double peppers in this dish are essential; it tastes better when you eat them together with the chili peppers!\"\"I don't eat spicy food,\" Gao Boyun replied.He tasted a piece of pork liver; it had a sweet and sour flavor, not very spicy, but incredibly delicious and aromatic. His eyes brightened, and he exclaimed, \"This is so delicious! I never expected your cooking skills to be this good!\"\"I told you, I learned from the master chef. Our hotel's restaurant at Starlight Farm is well-known for this,\" Zheng Baozhu said proudly.\"In that case, I must bring my friends there some time,\" Gao Boyun replied.\"During the peak season, we don't accept individual customers or small groups. If you can meet the standards of a tourist group, then we can consider accommodating you,\" Zheng Baozhu said arrogantly, \"But if you book a room at our hotel, of course, you can dine at the hotel restaurant.\"\"...\"Gao Boyun fell silent for a moment. Zheng Baozhu was even more arrogant than he remembered her from the film set. After finishing the Double Pepper Pork Liver, Gao Boyun's eyes turned greedy as he glanced at the Bean Curd Beef.Zheng Baozhu said, \"Why are you staring at it? Eat!\"Gao Boyun hesitated, \"But it looks really spicy.\"Zheng Baozhu earnestly said, \"It's not spicy; go ahead and try it!\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Gao Boyun held his chopsticks but still hesitated.Zheng Baozhu turned to Qu Zhi, \"Qu Zhi, why don't you try it first to show him it's not spicy!\"Qu Zhi looked at it, scooped a spoonful of the bean curd into his bowl, and took a bite.Gao Boyun asked him, \"How is it?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"It's delicious, the tofu is tender, and the flavor is great,\" Then he added, \"It's not spicy.\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"See, I told you it's not spicy; it just looks red!\"Gao Boyun believed them and used a spoon to scoop some bean curd into his bowl. The tofu was coated with chili oil, emitting a dangerous and alluring signal. The aroma wafted into his nostrils, but Gao Boyun couldn't resist and took a bite of the bean curd.Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi stared at him without blinking. The moment Gao Boyun tasted the bean curd, his face twisted, and he exclaimed, \"Ah! It's hot and spicy!\"Worried, Zheng Baozhu asked, \"What's wrong? Is it too hot?\"Gao Boyun looked at Zheng Baozhu with teary eyes and said, \"It's both hot and spicy!\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"You're such a child! When Qu Zhi ate it earlier, he blew on it to cool it down!\"\"...The point is that it's spicy!\"Qu Zhi saw Gao Boyun's accusatory look but didn't show any change in his expression, let alone any sense of guilt.\"I do think it's not spicy,\" he asserted.Zheng Baozhu tasted the bean curd herself and told Gao Boyun, \"It's really not spicy!\"Gao Boyun remained silent.Su Mingxi sighed softly and spoke, \"Both of them like spicy food.\"Gao Boyun glanced at them, picked up the bowl of rice soup beside him, and drank some without touching the bean curd.Zheng Baozhu continued, \"Then, why don't you try the beef? The bean curd might have more chili oil, so the beef should not be spicy.\"Gao Boyun glanced at her skeptically, \"Do you think I'll believe you?\"Zheng Baozhu looked particularly innocent, \"I didn't realize you're so afraid of spiciness. How about you try eating it with rice? It won't feel as spicy then.\"At first, Gao Boyun firmly refused to try the bean curd beef again. However, he couldn't resist the temptation and eventually tested it using Zheng Baozhu's method. After the spiciness blended with the rice, it did become much milder.After the meal, he offered to help with washing the dishes. Although he usually had a housemaid taking care of him at home and didn't do household chores, today he wanted to stay a bit longer here to delay the time, so he rolled up his sleeves and got to work.Qu Zhi stayed in the living room and continued chatting with Zheng Baozhu's mother, hoping to find some breakthrough.In the kitchen, Gao Boyun stood by the sink, glanced towards the living room, and then asked Zheng Baozhu in a low voice, \"Is there really nothing between you and that old classmate of yours? Why do I find it hard to believe?\"Zheng Baozhu clicked her tongue impatiently, \"My mom even tried to introduce someone to him yesterday. What can there possibly be between us?\"Gao Boyun was still doubtful, \"So, on that day when you were in his room, you really didn't do anything?\"\"Well, not really...\"As soon as she said that, Gao Boyun raised an eyebrow as if saying, \"I knew it.\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him speechlessly, \"Are all directors' minds as complicated as yours? That night, I slept in the bedroom, and he slept on the couch. I fell asleep there because I was too tired from filming during the day!\"Gao Boyun observed her and felt that she wasn't lying, so he said somewhat cryptically, \"Is this old classmate of yours not up to par?\"\"............\"Sighing, Zheng Baozhu gave Gao Boyun a slight smile, \"If you directly say this to him, be prepared to get punched for the second time today.\"\"...\"Gao Boyun tried to look nonchalant, \"I made a reasonable inference based on your words.\"\"What's so reasonable about that? Let me tell you, Qu Zhi holds grudges if you offend him. Don't be fooled by his calm appearance. Once he finds an opportunity, he'll come back with a vengeance,\" Zheng Baozhu warned.\"...\"Is it that scary?\"But you've been friends with him for so many years, you must genuinely care about him.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu fell silent for a moment, \"Can you focus on washing the dishes properly?\"As Gao Boyun washed the dishes, he said teasingly, \"I do think he's interested in you. Otherwise, who would travel all the way to the set just to see an old classmate? Do you really think he's a Bodhisattva?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Qu Zhi appeared at the kitchen entrance without them noticing and stared at their backs with sharp eyes.\"What were you two talking about?\"Zheng Baozhu and Gao Boyun were taken aback when they suddenly saw him. Gao Boyun chuckled twice and said to him, \"When did you come? Why didn't we hear any sound? You scared us.\"Qu Zhi didn't answer his question and repeated his previous inquiry, \"What were you two talking about?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"He was praising you, saying that you are like a Bodhisattva.\"Gao Boyun: \"...\"Qu Zhi glanced at Zheng Baozhu and then walked into the kitchen, saying to Gao Boyun, \"I'll take over. Aunt Su wants to talk to you.\"Gao Boyun asked nervously, \"What does she want to talk about?\"\"How would I know?\" Qu Zhi pushed him away from the sink and rolled up his own sleeves, \"If you're scared, you can leave now.\"Gao Boyun was indeed afraid of Su Mingxi, but the matter with Zheng Baozhu wasn't resolved yet, so how could he leave?As he pondered how to handle Su Mingxi later, a series of hurried footsteps approached. Su Mingxi was holding her phone and ran to the kitchen door, saying, \"Baozhu, your uncle said your grandmother fell and is currently at the hospital!\"Zheng Baozhu was stunned for a moment, then quickly removed the plastic gloves from her hands, \"Let's go to the hospital now. My car is parked downstairs.\"\"Okay,\" Su Mingxi was too worried to pay attention to Gao Boyun at the moment, so she quickly packed her things and prepared to leave with Zheng Baozhu.\"Aunt Su, please don't worry,\" Qu Zhi reassured Su Mingxi, \"I'll go with you guys to the hospital and see if there's anything I can help with.\"Su Mingxi nodded and glanced at Gao Boyun, saying, \"You can go back home now.\"Although Gao Boyun also wanted to go to the hospital, he felt that it wouldn't be appropriate. In the end, he nodded and left on his own.Zheng Baozhu's car was parked in the community parking lot. When they reached the car and were about to get in, Qu Zhi placed his hand on her wrist, saying, \"I'll drive.\"Zheng Baozhu looked up at him, seemingly not understanding his intention. Qu Zhi explained, \"You seem a bit emotionally unstable right now. I'll drive.\"Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment, seemingly surprised, \"You have a driver's license?\"\"...\"Qu Zhi lightly pulled the car door open, \"I got my driver's license abroad, and when I returned, I exchanged it for the local one.\" He reassured her, \"Don't worry, I'm a skilled driver.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"After Qu Zhi sat in the driver's seat, she moved to the back and sat with her mother. Once everyone had fastened their seat belts, Qu Zhi drove the car out. Qu Zhi turned on the navigation and drove in the direction of the hospital.Zheng Baozhu sat in the back, comforting her mother, telling her not to worry too much. They had already inquired with her uncle earlier, her grandmother's injuries were not particularly severe. After getting her cast fixed, she would be able to go home. However, due to her old age, the family was still concerned.As the car approached the hospital, the traffic conditions worsened. Even during the Lunar New Year, it was crowded as usual. Finding a parking spot in front of the hospital was challenging. Zheng Baozhu originally planned to drop off her mother and Qu Zhi first and then find a parking spot for the car. Unexpectedly, Qu Zhi's driving skills were truly exceptional, and he elegantly maneuvered the car into an empty space.His parallel parking skills were truly remarkable.\"...Wow,\" Zheng Baozhu was both astonished and composed as she unfastened her seatbelt, \"You're really good at this.\"Qu Zhi glanced at her from the rearview mirror and also unfastened his seatbelt, \"Let's get out.\"Once the three of them got out of the car, they went straight to Zheng Baozhu's grandmother's hospital room. It was a double room, and the other patient wasn't there at the moment, so the room was occupied by Zheng Baozhu's family.Zheng Baozhu's Grandfather, uncle, aunt, elder cousin, cousin-in-law, and even little Yao Yao, who was still in elementary school, all came.Zheng Baozhu's grandmother's right leg was in a cast as she was sitting on the bed. Besides her pale appearance, she seemed relatively alert. Zheng Baozhu had experienced a similar scene during her senior year of high school, but back then, her elder cousin and Yao Yao weren't there. As soon as they entered the hospital room, everyone's eyes focused on them, and then their performance began.Because of the previous incident, and considering the timing of her grandmother's fall, Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but suspect that they were acting again.However, based on the appearance of her grandmother's leg in a cast, it didn't seem like a fake.\"Mom, how are you? How did you fall when you were doing fine?\" Su Mingxi hurriedly approached the hospital bed, looking a bit anxious. Beside her, Zheng Baozhu's aunt patted her hand and said, \"The doctor said it's not serious, but it's just that elderly people take longer to recover due to their weaker physical condition.\"Su Mingxi nodded, feeling slightly relieved, \"Does she need to be hospitalized now? Falling for elderly people is not a small matter. Shouldn't she undergo a full examination?\"Zheng Baozhu's Aunt said, \"The doctor said she doesn't need to be hospitalized, but she does need to rest at home. Don't worry, she has already undergone all the necessary examinations, and there are no major issues.\"Zheng Baozhu's hand holding her phone trembled slightly as she discreetly opened her phone and looked at the screen.Cousin: Baozhu, I'm sorry. This time it's all because of Yao Yao who sent your photo to the group. \u00a0It seems like she found out about it today. It was a neighbor who called my dad and that's how we rushed over.Cousin: This time it's true, not acting.Zheng Baozhu: \"......\"How did her grandmother, who wouldn't even browse the internet, find out about this so quickly? Who was spreading rumors in front of her!\"Baobao,\" her grandmother suddenly spoke to Zheng Baozhu, and Zheng Baozhu's whole body tensed up in guard.\"Grandma,\" she forced a smile and greeted her grandmother, pulling Qu Zhi's sleeve beside her as they walked closer to the hospital bed.Grandma Su glanced at the two of them, and she said, \"What's going on between you and Qu Zhi? Are you dating?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"......\"If she said they were dating now, could she use that to cover up the acting incident?Qu Zhi's expression also froze for a moment, as though he was somewhat unsure how to respond. In the end, Su Mingxi broke the awkward silence, \"Mom, you still recognize Qu Zhi?\"\"What are you saying? How could I not recognize him?\" Grandma Su looked at Su Mingxi and continued, \"Qu Zhi grew up together with Baobao since they were little. Besides, he hasn't changed much in appearance; he has always been so handsome.\"After praising Qu Zhi, Grandma Su returned to the main topic in a very rational manner, \"So, are you two dating? You came to the hospital together.\"Su Mingxi replied, \"Qu Zhi happened to be with us today, and he drove us here.\"\"Oh...\" Grandma Su responded and then looked at Su Mingxi, asking, \"Mingxi, do you know about Baobao taking up acting?\"\"...\"Su Mingxi didn't expect to be involved in this matter as well, but she could only nod and said, \"I just found out last night.\"\"Then why didn't you tell me?\" Grandma Su said with a hint of displeasure and frustration, \"I heard about it from Old Jiang.\"Su Mingxi pursed her lips and explained, \"I didn't want you to get angry.\"\"Am I not angry now?\" Grandma Su looked at Zheng Baozhu and asked, \"Baobao, tell me what's going on.\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment, then could only force a smile and said, \"Grandma, let's not talk about this for now. The most important thing now is for you to take good care of yourself and recover.\"\"Don't try to hide it from me. Do you think I don't know how I fell?\" As Grandma Su spoke, her face turned serious, \"Our family can't have a second celebrity.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe atmosphere in the\u00a0hospital room became tense. Everyone looked at Grandma Su lying on the bed, and for a moment, no one spoke.The air was suffocatingly quiet. Little did everyone know that Su Mingxi's assertiveness came from Grandma Su.Su Mingxi glanced at Zheng Baozhu, hesitated for a moment, and then went to persuade her mother, \"Mom, don't get angry. It's not worth it to get upset. Besides, Yao Yao is here; don't scare the child.\"Concerned about the child, Grandma Su suppressed her anger and spoke to Zheng Baozhu in a more gentle tone, \"Baobao, since you have already acted in the film, we won't pursue it any further. But you cannot act in any more films in the future.\"Su Mingxi added, \"I told her the same thing, but she still needs time to accept it. Give her some more time...\"\"I truly can't accept it,\" Zheng Baozhu clenched her hands by her side and looked at Grandma Su lying on the hospital bed, \"Grandma, I know you have always cared for me. When I got into trouble as a child, even when my mom wanted to scold me, you always protected me. But I can't understand why you're so hung up on Aunt's matter. When she passed away, you were all deeply grieving, and that's understandable. But it's been almost twenty years since then! Twenty years, and your time seems to have stopped on the day Aunt left. You could never move on. Is that normal?! You have hidden away everything related to her, you forbid anyone in the family to talk about celebrities, and you won't allow me to be a celebrity. You've erased all traces of her from our lives. Do you think you can be at ease like this?\"\"Baobao, do you even know what you're saying?\" Su Mingxi interrupted sharply.Zheng Baozhu turned to her mother, \"Mom, did you have pimples when you were young? If the pimples got infected, you had to get the pus out for it to heal. You all understand this principle, but none of you are willing to do it. I don't think the problem is with me; the problem lies with all of you!\"\"That's enough!\" This time, it was Zheng Baozhu's uncle who spoke up to stop her, \"Baobao, you're going too far! I think your mom spoils you too much!\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him, her heart pounding, but she didn't back down, \"Uncle, you're the eldest son in the family. I know that in the past, Grandpa and Grandma were busy with work, and my mom and Aunt were mostly taken care of by you. As a child, I always thought my uncle was amazing, like a superhero who was fearless of any difficulties. I wanted to grow up quickly, thinking that when I became an adult, I could be like my uncle, and no difficulty could deter me. But as I grew older, I realized that adults are not brave at all. They can also be afraid and escape, just like children can be cowardly.\"As Zheng Baozhu spoke, tears unconsciously streamed down her cheeks, and even her uncle, a man, had reddened eyes. He kept his lips tightly sealed, his thoughts in turmoil, but unable to say a word.Grandma Su, lying on the hospital bed, wiped her eyes and looked back at Zheng Baozhu, \"Baobao, do you think we stopped you from acting because we were afraid of recalling Mingmei? It's true that her loss will always be a pain in our hearts, but what we are more concerned about is that you might become like Mingmei, immersed in the world of acting and unable to distinguish reality from fiction.\"\"Grandma, my choices are different from Aunt's, and her decisions don't represent mine,\" Zheng Baozhu wiped away the tears on her face and looked at Grandma, \"I'm scared of dying. There are so many good things in this world that I can't bear to leave behind.\"\"Do you think Mingmei was willing to leave?\" Grandma Su's emotions finally overwhelmed her, and she spoke with some agitation, \"Mingmei used to be a vibrant and lively person! No one expected her to do such a thing before the accident...\"As Grandma Su spoke, her voice choked, and she couldn't continue. Su Mingxi rushed forward and gently patted her mother's back, helping her to breathe, \"Mom, don't get too upset. Be mindful.\"Su Mingxi's eyes were also tinged with red, and she glanced at Zheng Baozhu with some reproach, \"Baobao, let's drop the topic for today. Do you want to see your grandma get seriously ill before you're happy?\"Zheng Baozhu stood there without saying another word. If her grandma was already this upset, she didn't want to cause any further accidents.From the nearby table, Qu Zhi picked up a few tissues, hesitated as he looked at Zheng Baozhu, and finally quietly handed them to her. Zheng Baozhu took them, wiping away the tears on her face. Little Yao Yao looked up and suddenly burst into tears with a loud cry.The people in the room were startled, and they all turned to look. Children's emotions are always more sensitive, and Su Mingxi was worried that the argument had frightened Yao Yao. She comforted her softly, \"What's wrong, Yao Yao? Stop crying; we'll go home right away, okay?\"\"No, it's not okay,\" sobbed Yao Yao as she ran to Zheng Baozhu and hugged her, \"Why are you all bullying Aunt? So many of you bullying one person, Aunt is so pitiful, wu-waaaah\u2014\"Yao Yao's crying was ear-piercing, and Zheng Baozhu quickly wiped her tears, bending down to lift her up, \"Yao Yao, don't cry; Aunt is fine.\"\"But Aunt's eyes are all red from crying,\" cried Yao Yao, tears streaming down her cheeks. Zheng Baozhu's aunt hurriedly comforted, \"Yao Yao, come to Grandma. We're not bullying Aunt; we're doing this for her own good.\"Yao Yao looked at her own grandma, still clinging to Zheng Baozhu's neck and not letting go, accusing them tearfully, \"Mom told me that you don't like Aunt to act, saying that you would be sad if she acts, but if she doesn't act, Aunt will be sad. You are clearly doing this to avoid getting hurt yourselves, yet you claim it's for Aunt's good!\"Her teary voice lacked any intimidating power, but after she finished speaking, the hospital room fell into a new silence. Finally, her uncle looked at Yao Yao's mother beside her and spoke first, \"Su Jiaying, is this how you and your husband usually teach Yao Yao?\"Suddenly being brought to attention, Su Jiaying's shoulder trembled slightly, she looked at her dad and finally stood beside Zheng Baozhu, \"Dad, I think Baobao is right. Back then, when Grandma pretended to be sick to deceive Baobao and make her give up the arts entrance exam, I actually didn't approve in my heart, but I didn't dare to say anything. All these years, I've felt guilty towards Baobao. I understand that you have your concerns, but just like what Baobao said, it's been twenty years since Aunt Mingmie's incident, and it's time for you to move on.\"Uncle Su straightened up a bit, but his wife tried to mediate on the side, \"Jiaying, you know this matter is complicated...\"\"This matter is actually not complicated at all.\" Su Jiaying didn't wait for her mother to finish and turned her gaze to the hospital bed, \"You are so unwilling to let Baobao act because of two reasons. First, you don't want to see Aunt Mingmei's shadow in her. Sometimes I also feel that Baobao resembles Aunt Mingmei. But this is a difficulty we should overcome. Instead, we are transferring the burden onto Baobao. It's been so long; we should let go of Aunt Mingmei's matter. If she were alive, she wouldn't want to see us like this all the time. Second, as you said, you're afraid Baobao will walk the same path as Aunt Mingmei. If acting truly traps her, blurring the line between reality and fiction, then it falls under the category of mental illness, which can be resolved through self-adjustment or seeking help from a psychologist. Coincidentally, Xiao Zhou happens to be a psychologist.\"\"Xiao Zhou\" referred to Su Jiaying's husband. After Su Jiaying finished her lengthy explanation, everyone's attention turned to Xiao Zhou.Xiao Zhou felt the pressure was immense.Uncle Su looked at him and asked, \"Xiao Zhou, what do you think?\"\"...\"On one side was his father-in-law; on the other side was his wife -- he doesn't want to offend either of them. But he had to make a choice, \"Dad, Jiaying is right. This indeed falls under the category of mental illness. Many actors have experienced this situation, and if it's not severe, self-adjustment can resolve it. If it's more serious, seeking help from a psychologist is an option. It's not incurable; it can be treated.\"After he finished speaking, Grandma Su on the hospital bed suddenly snorted and laughed, \"Well, I see it now. The young people in our family are all quite something. You all have received higher education, you speak big words. Did we spend money and effort to raise you just so you could come here today and educate us?\"None of the younger generation spoke up. Grandma Su's gaze fell on Qu Zhi, and she asked, \"Qu Zhi, you have the highest education among them. Tell me, are they right or not?\"Qu Zhi was about to speak, but Su Mingxi had already interrupted, \"Mom, you don't need to ask him. He already did a morning's worth of ideological work for me at home.\"If it weren't for Grandma Su suddenly having an accident, she might have been talked into accepting this fact.\"...\" All the words Qu Zhi wanted to say were held back.The patient from the neighboring bed returned after a walk, and upon entering the ward, they were stunned by the atmosphere. Hesitating, they stood at the door and looked around with an awkward smile, \"Um... are you all having a family meeting? Should I go out for another walk?\"\"...\" Supported by Su Mingxi on the side, Grandma Su got up from the hospital bed, \"Let's go back first. If there's anything, we'll continue the discussion at home.\"Since Grandma Su had her foot in a cast, they had specially rented a wheelchair from the hospital to push her out. Today, everyone came in their own cars. After some discussion, Zheng Baozhu's uncle, aunt, and grandparents were in one car, while Yao Yao's family was supposed to be in another car. However, Yao Yao kept hugging Zheng Baozhu's neck and wouldn't let go, so Su Jiaying and Xiao Zhou decided to let her go in Zheng Baozhu's car. They took Su Mingxi back to their own car to avoid further conflict with Zheng Baozhu.With the vehicles assigned, Zheng Baozhu held Yao Yao in her arms, and together with Qu Zhi, they walked out of the hospital. Su Jiaying and Xiao Zhou walked behind them, watching the three of them. Su Jiaying couldn't help but comment, \"Don't you think they look like a family of three?\"Xiao Zhou looked at their backs and replied, \"But isn't this Mr. Qu the one you mentioned before? Weren't you saying that he and Baozhu had a terrible relationship, like water and fire?\"\"Yes!\" Su Jiaying couldn't make sense of it herself, \"Their relationship was really bad when they were kids. If it wasn't for the fact that murder is illegal, they probably wouldn't have been able to grow up together!\"\"...\"Xiao Zhou fell silent for a moment, \"So, what's going on between them now?\"Su Jiaying sighed, \"I suspect one of them, or both of them, got swapped.\"\"...Oh, that's possible.\"Walking in front, Zheng Baozhu was holding the tissues Qu Zhi handed her and wiped away the mucus from Yao Yao's face, \"Yao Yao, thank you for speaking up for your aunt. What do you want to eat? I will buy it for you.\"Yao Yao had stopped crying by now and looked at Zheng Baozhu cheerfully, \"Yao Yao doesn't want to eat!\"\"Oh, then what does Yao Yao want?\"Yao Yao blinked playfully, \"Aunt, can you help me get a signed photo of Lin Ziqin?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Yao Yao did it all for the handsome guy. :)\"Oh, is it because of Lin Ziqin's autograph that Yao Yao helped me?\" Zheng Baozhu pretended to be sad.Yao Yao quickly said, \"No! Yao Yao knows it was because I posted the pictures in the group chat that everyone scolded Aunt. Yao Yao really wants to help Aunt!\"\"Oh, okay then. Since you sincerely want to help me, I'll try to get you signed photos of Lin Ziqin.\"\"Thank you, Aunt!\" Yao Yao happily kissed Zheng Baozhu on the face, \"I want ten of them!\"\"...Little one, aren't you being a bit greedy?\"\"Also Zhou Ting, Huang Weiwei, Feng Yuanyuan, Xie You...\" Yao Yao began listing the names of other classmates who also wanted Lin Ziqin's photos, counting on her fingers.Zheng Baozhu interrupted with a black line on her forehead, \"Alright, I got it. I'll try to get you ten photos.\"\"Thank you, Aunt!\" After saying that, Yao Yao noticed Qu Zhi walking beside them and extended both her hands in his direction, \"Big brother, Aunt is tired of carrying Yao Yao, can you carry Yao Yao now?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Wait, when did I say I was tired? Although carrying a child can be tiring, what's a little weight for someone who carried Lin Ziqin on set all morning!Qu Zhi naturally took Yao Yao into his arms. Yao Yao hugged his neck with both hands, looking at him with a silly smile, \"Big brother, you're so handsome. Are you Aunt's boyfriend?\"Zheng Baozhu coughed on the side, \"Yao Yao, don't say that.\"\"But Aunt had never brought any other big brother home,\" After saying that, Yao Yao continued to stare at Qu Zhi's face, \"Big brother, your eyelashes are so long, and your eyes and nose are so good-looking.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Yao Yao's flattering skills are still as impressive as they were when she was little.Zheng Baozhu, hearing the praise for Qu Zhi, deliberately teased, \"So, Yao Yao, who do you think is more handsome; this big brother or Lin Ziqin?\"\"Well...\" Yao Yao wrinkled her small eyebrows in difficulty, \"Then I'll choose Lin Ziqin. After all, this big brother belongs to Aunt, while Lin Ziqin belongs to all of us.\"\"...\"As expected, when Yao Yao bravely defended her, she should have realized she's no ordinary primary school student.\"Qu Zhi was responsible for driving to Grandma Su's house, while Zheng Baozhu and Yao Yao sat in the back seat. Almost everyone arrived at the same time. Grandma Su was carried out of the car by Uncle Su and placed in a chair.Because Grandma Su's foot was injured, making it difficult for her to move, everyone began discussing taking turns to take care of her, but Grandma Su didn't agree.\"Don't bother so much. I know you all have your own families and are busy. With your dad taking care of me, that's enough,\" even though Grandpa Su was always carefree, he played an important role in this moment, \"His care is sufficient, and besides, I'm not that frail. I'll do what I can on my own.\"Still, everyone was a bit worried. Uncle Su suggested hiring a caregiver, but Grandma Su refused. Unable to change her mind, they compromised and decided to visit her every two or three days.\"Oh, we also need to buy a good wheelchair for Mom,\" Su Mingxi brought this up. Zheng Baozhu said, \"I know a friend who deals in medical equipment. I'll ask for help in purchasing it.\"Su Jiaying agreed, \"Sure, let Baozhu handle it, but let's split the cost. Good wheelchairs aren't cheap.\"\"It's fine. You two spend more time taking care of Grandma, so I'll cover the cost. No need to be concerned about it.\"Upon hearing this, Grandma Su chuckled, \"You're admitting you don't visit me often enough? Are you afraid I'll find out about your acting endeavors?\"\"...\" Indeed.\"Alright, Mom, let's discuss these matters later. I'll help you rest now, the doctor said you need some peace and quiet,\" Su Mingxi guided Grandma Su into the house. Zheng Baozhu's aunt thought since everyone was here today, they should have a family dinner together and celebrate the New Year.Uncle Su had been taking care of his siblings since he was young, and at that time, conditions were relatively difficult. In order to coax his two sisters to eat well, he did a lot of research on how to make the most delicious dishes with the simplest ingredients. Zheng Baozhu was influenced by him, which eventually led her to pursue a career in the culinary arts.Today, Grandma Su couldn't cook, so Zheng Baozhu's aunt dragged her uncle to the kitchen and let him be in charge of preparing meals for the younger generation. The kitchen wasn't very spacious, and the young people decided not to crowd in, so they sat in the living room and chatted.Zheng Baozhu was playing games with Yao Yao when she suddenly received a message from Tan Yao. This person had been quiet for a while, and Zheng Baozhu thought he finally stopped bothering her, but today he thought of messaging her again.Zheng Baozhu opened the message and saw that Tan Yao had seen the drama's first-look photo and ran over in shock to ask her about it.Zheng Baozhu: Yes, it's me.Tan Yao: !! So, the sideline job you mentioned before is acting??This was completely unexpected!Tan Yao: Are you planning to develop in the entertainment industry in the future?Zheng Baozhu: Let's see.Tan Yao furrowed his brows. What does \"let's see\" mean? With her background and resources, it would be effortless for her to develop in the industry. For example, just this makeup photo alone, despite being a minor supporting role, was enough to draw the attention of netizens among a group of lesser-known actresses.\"So, Brother Tan, did you confirm now?\" Tan Yao's friend leaned on the table, holding a pool cue, looking at him, \"I told you there's no fate between you and Miss Baozhu. You should give up.\"\"I think so too,\" Another friend pocketed a ball, straightened up with the pool cue, and said, \"Uncle Tan always disliked the entertainment industry. It's impossible for him to let you date a celebrity.\"Tan Yao furrowed his brows, unsure how things turned out this way. His dad indeed strongly opposed the entertainment industry. The Tan family business covered many areas, but they never got involved with anything related to the entertainment industry.On Zheng Baozhu's end, after sending the message, she put her phone aside. Yao Yao looked at her and asked in a low voice, \"Aunt, are you secretly messaging other guys behind Brother Qu Zhi's back?\"\"...What on earth are you thinking in that little brain of yours all day?\"\"Hehe.\"Yao Yao chuckled twice when the door was knocked. Zheng Baozhu put down the game controller and stood up, saying, \"It should be my dad. I'll go open the door.\"Her dad had gone out early this morning, saying that he needed to take care of something personally. Originally, he planned to return in the evening, but after learning about Grandma Su's injury at noon, he adjusted his schedule and rushed over in the afternoon.Zheng Baozhu walked up and opened the door, and indeed, her dad was standing outside. As soon as she called him \"Dad\", another person walked out from behind her dad.Zheng Baozhu looked at the person and was somewhat incredulous as she asked, \"Teacher Ge? Why are you here?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFather Zheng did have business\u00a0matters to attend to today, but in the middle of it, he received a call and went to the old city to pick up Teacher Ge.Zheng Baozhu invited them in, served them hot tea, and looked at them strangely, \"Dad, why did you come here with Teacher Ge?\"Father Zheng chuckled awkwardly and said, \"Oh, we happened to run into each other downstairs.\"Teacher Ge cooperated with his explanation, \"Yes, it was a coincidence. I heard that your grandma got injured, so I came over to check on her.\"Zheng Baozhu asked with some doubt, \"You know my grandma?\"After asking, she felt that the question was unnecessary. Teacher Ge was her aunt's teacher back then, so it wasn't strange for him to know her grandma.Ge Hongyi smiled and said, \"Indeed, we know each other. We met when Mingmei was still studying, and later, when Mingmei went to perform in another city and couldn't be reached, your grandma came to find me.\"And then, the incident with Mingmei happened.After hearing the commotion outside, Su Mingxi came out of the bedroom and was taken aback when she saw Ge Hongyi sitting on the sofa, \"You are... Teacher Ge?\"\"You must be Baozhu's mother,\" Ge Hongyi nodded and looked at Su Mingxi, \"I came here unannounced today, sorry for the disturbance.\"\"Not at all,\" Su Mingxi replied politely but quickly understood the situation. Teacher Ge was Ming's mentor, and after Mingmei's passing, they hadn't been in touch for a long time. Now, with the exposure of Baozhu's acting career, Teacher Ge reached out, so it must be that family with the surname Gao seeking his help.Teacher Ge was older than them and a respected teacher, so they didn't dare to raise their voices in front of him.\"I heard that Baozhu's grandma had a fall? How is she now?\" Ge Hongyi asked with concern.\"It's not serious. The doctor said she just needs to rest at home. My mom is resting inside; let me take you in to see her,\" Su Mingxi said.\"Alright,\" Ge Hongyi nodded and followed Su Mingxi into the bedroom.As they left, Su Jiaying curiously approached Zheng Baozhu and asked, \"Is this Teacher Ge the one who taught our aunt back then? I've heard about him; many top actors in the entertainment industry were mentored by him.\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded. Su Jiaying continued, \"How do you also know Teacher Ge?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"Director Gao introduced me to him to learn acting.\"Su Jiaying widened her eyes in surprise, \"Teacher Ge is personally teaching you? That's a rare opportunity; you must learn well!\"\"I know,\" Zheng Baozhu replied.\"Wow, then today, is Teacher Ge here to speak on your behalf?\" Su Jiaying asked curiously.Zheng Baozhu shook her head slightly without saying a word. Teacher Ge's sudden appearance here couldn't be a coincidence. It seemed likely that he came to speak on her behalf. But how did he find out about it?After some thought, she picked up her phone and sent a message to Gao Boyun, \"Did you tell Teacher Ge about my situation?\"Gao Boyun replied almost instantly, \"I didn't, but I told my dad, and he said he would find someone to help. Could it be Teacher Ge?!?\"Zheng Baozhu: ...That's probably it. He is currently at my house talking to my grandma.Gao Boyun: Ah, I see.It seemed that his dad was reliable this time, unexpectedly bringing out Teacher Ge to help.Gao Boyun: With Teacher Ge's involvement, things are probably under control. It seems like Teacher Ge doesn't want you to quit the entertainment industry either.Zheng Baozhu: I hope he can persuade my grandma (\u2510\u300c\u03b5:)Gao Boyun: Shouldn't be a problem. By the way, how is your grandma's injury?Zheng Baozhu: Not a big issue.Gao Boyun: ...\"Aunt, are you messaging other guys again?\" Yao Yao sneakily approached and wanted to see Zheng Baozhu's phone. Zheng Baozhu purposely moved her phone back, preventing her from looking. But in this act of evasion, she inadvertently placed the phone in front of Qu Zhi.Qu Zhi glanced down and saw the phone screen. Yao Yao looked up in Qu Zhi's direction and shouted, \"Big brother, did you see it?\"\"Mhmm,\" Qu Zhi replied softly, then averted his gaze.Zheng Baozhu: ?What kind of coordination game are they playing here??\"It's very unethical to look at someone else's phone!\" Zheng Baozhu locked her phone screen and turned to accuse Qu Zhi. Qu Zhi remained as calm as ever as if he wasn't the one who peeked at someone else's phone just now, \"You handed me the phone yourself, I only happen to accidentally see it.\"\"Hmph!\"Qu Zhi handed a peeled tangerine to Zheng Baozhu and said nonchalantly, \"Gao Boyun cares about you.\"Zheng Baozhu immediately ate the small tangerine, spitting out the seeds and telling Qu Zhi, \"Of course, he even said he wants me to reshoot a scene in a few days. If I can't make it, he'll be in trouble.\"\"Oh,\" Qu Zhi replied and picked up another tangerine, \"Do you want more?\"Yao Yao approached from the side and said, \"I want to eat too!\"Su Jiaying waved her hand and called out, \"Yao Yao, come here to Mommy. Don't disturb those two.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Inside the room, Ge Hongyi sat on a chair by the bed and first inquired about Grandma Su's condition. Then he got to the main topic, \"The reason I came today was to talk about Baozhu's matter. To be honest, Baozhu has been studying acting with me for a few months now.\"Su Mingxi was momentarily stunned. She had heard Zheng Baozhu mention having a teacher, but she didn't expect it to be Teacher Ge.Grandma Su didn't seem particularly surprised and smiled faintly, saying to Ge Hongyi, \"I had a rough idea. If Baozhu wasn't your student, why would you make this trip?\"Ge Hongyi adjusted his reading glasses and calmly said, \"Baozhu is very talented, she learns quickly and has a high understanding. I have high expectations for her. While she may have some similarities with Mingmei, they are still quite different.\"Grandma Su sighed lightly, \"Teacher Ge, I understand your intentions in coming today, but you also know the situation in our family...\"\"I know, you've all been through a lot over the years,\" Ge Hongyi said and sighed himself, \"But Baozhu shouldn't face the consequences. I can see that she genuinely loves acting; otherwise, she wouldn't persist even in the face of opposition from all of you. I understand your concerns, but will holding her back give her the best chance in life?\"Grandma Su pondered for a while before speaking, \"Teacher Ge, today at the hospital, Baozhu and the others talked to us about many things. I was just discussing it with Mingxi earlier. Have we really been wrong all these years? But we are genuinely worried about Baozhu.\"Ge Hongyi smiled understandingly and reassured her, \"I am also an elder, and I understand the concerns of elders. But if we constantly worry about our juniors' decisions, it will never end. If we don't worry about this matter, we'll worry about another. Besides, we can't control their entire lives. After we're gone, they will still live their lives as they wish. However, if they want to pursue their passions later in life, it might be too late. So we should relax and let our descendants find their own happiness.\"Grandma Su looked at him without saying a word as Ge Hongyi spoke earnestly, \"At our age, our lives are coming to an end. But young people are different. Baozhu is only twenty-five years old, her future is still long. In the future, she has to live on her own. We can't give her time back. If we force them to live according to our desires, we may feel temporarily happy, but they might be unhappy their entire lives and carry resentment toward us in the end. Is that really what we want?\"After Ge Hongyi finished speaking, the room fell into silence, and no one spoke for a while. Ge Hongyi sat for a moment, gave a few more instructions to Grandma Su, and then stood up from the chair, saying, \"I know that words from outsiders won't make much difference. Baozhu needs to figure it out herself. I won't disturb you any longer. Please rest well.\"\"Alright,\" Grandma Su nodded and looked at him, \"Teacher Ge, I know your words just now were sincere. I will think it over carefully. Mingxi, please see Teacher Ge off.\"\"Sure,\" Su Mingxi responded and followed Ge Hongyi out. Once outside, they noticed everyone secretly observing them but didn't say anything. Su Mingxi glanced at Father Zheng and said, \"Let's go, we'll send Teacher Ge back.\"\"Alright,\" Father Zheng picked up his coat and walked with them. Zheng Baozhu caught up with them and asked worriedly, \"Should I go and send Teacher Ge?\"\"No need, stay here and accompany Yao Yao. Your father's driving skills aren't that bad,\" Su Mingxi reassured.After bidding farewell to Ge Hongyi, Zheng Baozhu returned to the sofa. Su Jiaying asked, \"Why is your mother so inscrutable? She didn't say a word about what they talked about?\"\"I don't know,\" Zheng Baozhu was curious about what they discussed inside but didn't dare to ask.\"Baobao,\" suddenly came the voice of her grandmother from the room, \"Come in for a moment.\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback, a hint of panic flashed in her eyes. Su Jiaying patted her back and used her eyes to signal \"Stay calm, be steady!\"Qu Zhi followed Zheng Baozhu as she stood up and quietly asked, \"Do you want me to go in with you?\"Zheng Baozhu was about to nod when her grandmother said, \"No need. Baobao, come in alone.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu reluctantly looked at the people in the living room once more before walking in alone. Grandma Su was sitting in a wheelchair, having come down from the bed on her own. Zheng Baozhu rushed over, asking, \"Grandma, how did you come down by yourself?\"\"I'm fine,\" Grandma Su said, pushing the wheelchair toward an old cabinet. Zheng Baozhu followed and saw her grandmother trying to open the cabinet. She helped and opened the door, saying, \"Grandma, what are you looking for? Let me find it for you.\"\"It's the iron box at the very bottom. Help me take it out,\" Grandma Su pointed to the bottom of the cabinet.Inside the cabinet, there were still some old clothes. Zheng Baozhu bent down and searched for a while before finding the iron box her grandmother mentioned. The box had an old rusty lock, indicating it hadn't been used in a long time.Zheng Baozhu handed the box to her grandmother and curiously asked, \"Grandma, what's inside this box?\"The box seemed a bit large, it's unlike something that would contain small items.Grandma Su took out a key from the drawer of the dressing table, inserted it into the lock of the box, and twisted it forcefully several times before unlocking it, \"Indeed, when things aren't used for too long, they rust.\"Complaining a bit, she removed the lock and opened the box. Zheng Baozhu glanced inside and saw a picture of Su Mingmei on top.As she stood there in a daze, her grandmother took out the contents one by one, \"When Mingmei was popular, there wasn't much internet or Weibo. Back then, people read newspapers and magazines. Every time there was news about her, I liked to cut it out and keep it together. Look, they're all here.\"Yellowed paper filled with pictures and names of Su Mingmei, information about movies, interviews, reports of fans' gatherings, and stills from movie shoots. Finally, there were headlines from the year of her suicide, reporting the news all over.\"At that time, communication wasn't developed, and it was difficult for us to go watch her shoot movies in other places,\" Grandma Su touched the pictures of Su Mingmei, and her eyes began to moisten, \"I always felt sorry for Mingmei. She was so young and often away filming, enduring hardships, and I couldn't be with her most of the time. Once she got injured abroad, I only found out through the newspaper. I wanted to go and see her, but during that time, we couldn't get in touch. In the end, I had to ask Teacher Ge for help, and he managed to arrange for your mother and me to visit the film set. That time was even more extraordinary than my life.\"Zheng Baozhu's eyes also became a bit red. Listening to her grandmother's recollections of Su Mingmei, she realized that her aunt's original name was chosen by her grandmother.\"We never thought that one day she would choose to take her life and leave us,\" as Grandma Su said this, her emotions couldn't be controlled, her voice choked with sorrow, \"My child committed suicide, not only denying her own life but also my life as a mother! Over the years, besides heartache, I've felt so much guilt. I always thought, if I could be by her side more, would she not have done such a foolish thing?\"\"Grandma, don't be like this. Aunt definitely didn't mean it like that,\" Zheng Baozhu saw her grandmother so heartbroken and approached her with sadness, hugging her gently, \"Grandma, please don't be too sad. Take care of yourself.\"Grandma Su wiped the tears from her face and, after calming down a bit, took out the last item from the iron box, \"Before Mingmei committed suicide, she wrote a letter. Apart from the police and the staff around her at the time, only a few of us relatives have seen this letter.\"She opened the envelope and took out a yellowed piece of paper.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe ink on the letter paper had faded\u00a0somewhat, but the handwriting was still clear. Su Mingmei's writing was graceful, tidy, and appeared calm when writing this letter:I have finally come to this point, and surprisingly, my heart is calm. For a long time, I often felt pain, thinking that ending everything would bring relief, and indeed, I feel much lighter now. I admit that I am a weak person, and in the end, I chose to escape, but I am truly exhausted. The only thing I feel guilty about is my family. Mom, I'm sorry I didn't call you and talk to you. Like I said before, I am weak, and I didn't have the courage to make that call. I was afraid of hearing your voices, thinking about how sad you might be, and it would hurt me even more.But I am really in pain, and I just want to end it all.I know I might be sick, but I don't know how to cure myself. Acting used to bring me happiness, but now there is nothing that can make me happy. When I was studying, my teachers used to tell me that I was too immersed in my roles. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. Professional actors should be able to immerse themselves in the role and also detach from it. However, I find it difficult to separate from a character. To differentiate between the role and myself, I like to meet real people after finishing a film. That way, I can be in touch with reality and feel the existence of Su Mingmei.Mom, I haven't told you yet, but I've had a few boyfriends before. However, each time, it ended in a breakup due to work and other reasons. Nevertheless, I am grateful to them because being with them helped me find Su Mingmei again.After filming ]Spring No More', I didn't take on any new projects for a long time because I felt that my state of mind was not good. Some of my friends knew about my situation and often invited me to go out, hoping that I could gradually detach from my roles. During one of those outings with a friend, I met a man. He was different from any of my previous boyfriends; he wasn't from the entertainment industry and could be considered average-looking. However, I was deeply drawn to him.He exuded a strong vitality and life essence, just like how I used to be. He started doing business at a young age and traveled to many places, always sharing stories and experiences I had never heard before. While I knew that these stories might not be entirely true, they were still incredibly interesting. This surprised me because it had been a long time since I felt \"interested\".After that, we started meeting frequently, and every date was enjoyable. When I wanted to take our relationship further, he honestly told me that he was already married. I don't remember what I felt at that moment, but I had a profound feeling of destiny. It seemed like I could no longer detach the character of Jin Ya from myself.During that period, although I didn't take on any acting roles, I accepted many other jobs. I thought that keeping myself busy would prevent me from overthinking, and I even hoped that maybe after the movie was released, I would feel better. However, I have persisted until now, and my condition hasn't improved. I really don't have the strength to go on anymore. Mom, please forgive your weak child. Mingmei bids farewell.When Zheng Baozhu read the letter, she noticed tear stains on the paper, and she guessed they were the tears shed by her grandmother while reading the letter. She couldn't imagine how heartbroken her grandmother and the rest of the family must have been when they read this letter. The letter was more like a confession written by Su Mingmei to her family.Her grandmother must have read the letter many times before, as there were obvious creases in several places. Zheng Baozhu carefully folded the letter back along its original creases and put it back into the envelope. Grandma Su sat there silently, tears still flowing from her eyes.Zheng Baozhu handed her a tissue and gently wiped away the tears from her eyes, saying, \"Grandma, Aunt was ill.\"\"I know,\" Grandma Su's voice trembled slightly, \"I took her to see a doctor, but mental illnesses were hard to cure even now, let alone back then. If only we had spent more time with her, even just a little more, maybe the outcome would have been different.\"Not only their distant relatives, even the people who worked with Su Mingmei, were unaware of the situation. On the surface, everything seemed normal, and many were genuinely surprised when the police questioned them.\"If we had cared a bit more, even just a little, maybe the result would have been different.\"\"Grandma, it's not your fault,\" Zheng Baozhu reassured her softly, hugging her, \"Aunt also said in the letter that she didn't want to see you all sad.\"\"What's going on here?\" Su Mingxi walked in and was taken aback by the scene in the room. Seeing all these things related to Mingmei being taken out again, she felt something stir inside her, \"Mom, what is this...\"These things were all packed away by her mother and no one knew where.\"I let Baozhu read Mingmei's letter,\" Grandma Su said tearfully, turning to look at Su Mingxi, \"They talked so much today, even Mr. Ge personally came over. I think maybe we shouldn't have kept this secret from them all along, refusing to talk about her. It feels much better after sharing it.\"Su Mingxi pursed her lips slightly, feeling a mix of emotions. She walked over and looked at the newspapers with her little sister's pictures on them. After a while, she smiled faintly and said, \"It turns out so many years have passed already, and I'm getting old, but Mingmei still looks the same.\"\"Yes,\" Grandma Su nodded, putting back everything she had taken out into the iron box, \"Why did you come back so soon? Where's Mr. Ge?\"\"My husband is driving Teacher Ge back, so I didn't follow,\" Su Mingxi said, \"I just bought some food downstairs. Let's have a good meal together tonight.\"\"Okay,\" The iron box was closed again, but this time, Grandma Su didn't lock it, \"Baozhu, after reading your aunt's letter, do you still want to pursue an acting career?\"Su Mingxi also looked up. Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment before looking at her grandmother, \"Grandma, do you think Aunt regretted becoming an actress?\"Grandma Su's hand trembled slightly. She had never thought about -- or perhaps, deliberately avoided -- this question. In Mingmei's final letter, she wrote so many words, but not a single one mentioned that she regretted becoming an actress.\"When I was six years old, the first time I saw Aunt, I wished to grow up to become someone as radiant as her. And that dream has not changed even until today; it has only become more profound. Now I understand that being a good actress is tough and not easy, but I still want to become an actress.\"Zheng Baozhu's determination reminded Su Mingxi of the time when Zheng Baozhu sat on the floor, piecing the torn essay back together, piece by piece.Her eyes were as firm and determined as they were back then.The room fell silent for a while, only the faint breathing of a few people could be heard. Grandma Su set down the box in her hand and looked up, \"I can't stop you from doing what you want to do. I know I can't, but if you ask us to immediately accept this matter, we wouldn't be able to do it either. Let's give each other some time to think about it carefully.\"Zheng Baozhu knew this was already a concession from her grandmother and nodded, \"Alright, but Mom can't confine me to the house again.\"Su Mingxi chuckled, \"I'd love to confine you to the house, but can I actually do it?\"\"Alright, let's leave it at that for now. Let's all calm down,\" Grandma Su beckoned to Su Mingxi, \"Mingxi, help me to the bed. I need to rest for a bit.\"\"Okay,\" Su Mingxi went to help her mother, Zheng Baozhu also lent a hand. After Grandma Su lay down, Su Mingxi said to Zheng Baozhu, \"Let's go outside and let your grandmother rest. It's been quite a tumultuous day.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu followed Su Mingxi outside. As soon as they came out, the people in the living room all looked at them, seemingly wanting to gossip but not knowing how to start.Until dinner, everyone tacitly avoided discussing this matter. Tonight, Uncle Su had indeed displayed his skills and prepared a table full of delicious food. After eating so much good food, Zheng Baozhu's heart finally started to feel better.After dinner, everyone cleaned up the kitchen and the table. Su Mingxi then started urging everyone to leave, \"Alright, this house can't accommodate so many people here. You should all head back now and don't delay the elderly from resting. I'll stay here with my mom tonight and leave tomorrow.\"No one had objections and left together. Zheng Baozhu planned to go back to the hotel directly, so she asked Qu Zhi, \"Where are you heading?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"I'll go with you.\"Zheng Baozhu nodded, informed her father, and then went with Qu Zhi to get the car. Su Jiaying's car was parked nearby, and before Yao Yao got in the car, she reminded Zheng Baozhu, \"Aunt, don't forget to get me the autographed photos.\"\"Don't worry, I won't forget,\" Zheng Baozhu waved and smiled before getting into the car. On the way back, Qu Zhi sat in the front passenger seat and finally found an opportunity to ask, \"How was your conversation with your grandmother today?\"Zheng Baozhu nodded and replied, \"After Teacher Ge talked to her, my grandmother's attitude seemed to soften a bit. It seems being a teacher is beneficial; everyone subconsciously listens to your advice.\"\"That's not necessarily true; there are still mischievous and rebellious students.\"Zheng Baozhu laughed and said, \"True, but my grandmother's psychological burden has eased a bit. Today, she showed me my aunt's final letter.\"Qu Zhi was taken aback. Su Mingxi's final letter had never been made public, so many people were unaware of its existence. Qu Zhi was no exception.\"Your aunt left a final letter?\" he asked, surprised.Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"Yes. She had depression because of acting, which is why my family was so opposed to my pursuit of an acting career. My grandmother has been feeling guilty, thinking that she didn't care enough for my aunt. She kept saying that if she had spent more time with my aunt, maybe this wouldn't have happened.\"Qu Zhi fell silent for a moment and said, \"The term 'depression' has only become more prevalent in the ordinary people's field of view in recent years. Even today, some people still don't take it seriously and believe it's just something patients can't get over. Some people with depression may appear just like ordinary people on the outside, even close relatives and friends may find it challenging to detect that these people have depression.\"After listening to him, Zheng Baozhu thought for a while before saying, \"So, are you saying we shouldn't blame my grandmother?\"\"Um,\" Qu Zhi replied somewhat cautiously, \"But I understand that it's easy for family members to have such thoughts. It's normal for them to worry about you, but treatment for this has advanced a lot compared to several decades ago. As long as you take medication on time and cooperate with treatment, there is a chance for recovery.\"He paused for a moment and added, \"Of course, I'm not saying you'll definitely develop depression.\"Zheng Baozhu nodded, and if they weren't in a car, she would have given him a thumbs-up, \"Impressive, Dr. Qu, indeed very rigorous.\"Qu Zhi turned his head away and didn't say anything further. Zheng Baozhu remained quiet for a while before asking, \"Have you watched my aunt's film 'Spring No More'?\"\"I haven't,\" Qu Zhi shook his head, \"I heard it's profoundly melancholic, so I didn't watch it.\"Zheng Baozhu understood what he meant by \"profoundly melancholic\" and chuckled lightly, \"Indeed, I watched it, and then cried like a fool in my room. The following week was terrible for me, which made my mom think I had lost my mind.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"\"Even the audience finds it difficult after watching it, so my aunt must have found it even more challenging,\" Zheng Baozhu said in a light tone, \"I still remember in the movie, before the protagonist decided to commit suicide, someone asked what she would want to do if she had another life. The protagonist said she would do anything but be a painter. But if my aunt had a chance to start over, I think she would still choose to be an actress.\"Because under the camera's lens, Su Mingmei was the most dazzling.Zheng Baozhu always believed that life not only had length but also depth. Although Su Mingmei's life was short, she left a significant impact on the history of filmmaking.After returning to the hotel, Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi went straight to their rooms. Everyone was tired today and wanted to rest early.Two days later, Zheng Baozhu's friend contacted her, saying that the wheelchair had been delivered to the designated address. Zheng Baozhu thanked her and planned to personally go to her grandmother's place to check on the wheelchair. This wheelchair had many functions and she was worried that her grandmother wouldn't be able to figure it out on her own.As she was leaving, she happened to meet Qu Zhi. She hesitated for a moment, and then asked him as she closed the door, \"Are you going out?\"Qu Zhi nodded and looked at the bag on his shoulder, \"Are you going out too?\"\"Yes, the wheelchair has been delivered, so I'm going to my grandmother's to check it out,\" Zheng Baozhu said as she walked outside, \"Do you want something from me?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"I was originally planning to go and see the penthouse's renovation progress and wanted you to come along. But since you have something to do, let's do it another day.\"Zheng Baozhu suddenly recalled their original plans, \"No need to change the plan. I'll go with you after coming back from my grandmother's place. I won't be long.\"Qu Zhi thought for a moment and nodded slightly, then looked at Zheng Baozhu, \"In that case, I'll go with you.\"Zheng Baozhu blinked and agreed, \"Sure.\"Both of them went to Grandma Su's place together. The wheelchair, as expected, had been delivered. When they arrived, Su Mingxi was studying the instruction manual, \"Hey, why are you two here?\"Zheng Baozhu explained, \"My friend said the wheelchair had arrived, so I came to check it out.\"\"Oh, that's perfect. Little Qu, come and help me with this manual,\" Su Mingxi called Qu Zhi over and pointed to parts she didn't understand. Zheng Baozhu watched them fiddle with it while her phone suddenly rang. She quickly covered the screen when she saw it was Gao Boyun calling, stealing a glance at Su Mingxi.Being engrossed in Qu Zhi's explanation, Su Mingxi hadn't noticed Zheng Baozhu's phone call.With her phone in hand, Zheng Baozhu quietly went outside to answer the call. Qu Zhi glanced at her and said to Su Mingxi, \"Let's have Grandma try sitting on it herself.\"\"Sure,\" Su Mingxi followed Qu Zhi as they pushed the chair into the room and helped Grandma Su sit on it.As soon as Grandma Su sat down, she immediately noticed the difference from the previous chair she had used, \"Ah, this chair is really comfortable.\"\"Of course, otherwise, why would Baozhu go to so much effort to buy this for you?\" Su Mingxi adjusted her sitting posture and introduced, \"This chair has many functions, Qu Zhi suggests you try it out.\"\"Oh, okay then,\" Grandma Su said, glancing outside, \"Where's Baozhu?\"Su Mingxi also found it strange, \"Yeah, where did she go this time?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"It seems someone called her, so she went to answer the phone.\"As soon as Su Mingxi heard this, she suspected that Zheng Baozhu had sneaked off to deal with something secretly again, \"With her sneaky behavior, could it be another director looking for her?!\" Then she looked at her mother, \"Mom, you don't really plan to agree to Baozhu continuing to be an actor, do you?\"\"What's the use of me disagreeing? Even if I try to stop her, she won't listen. What can I do?\" Grandma Su said helplessly.Su Mingxi furrowed her brows, \"But we can't just let her do as she pleases. What if something happens one day...\"She didn't continue, but the implication was evident. Qu Zhi listened to their conversation, his gaze slightly changed before he said to them, \"Grandma, Aunt Su, Baozhu actually told me about everything. I know you worry that Baozhu might also suffer from depression due to acting, but nowadays people take this condition more seriously than before. Many people start receiving treatment when they have mild depression, and it's a treatable condition.\"Hearing him speak, Su Mingxi couldn't help but say, \"See, I knew you'd start advocating for Baozhu again. You already spent the whole morning advising me and still haven't had enough. In my impression, you weren't much of a talker before.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Su Mingxi looked at him and sighed gently, \"Ah, actually, what you said makes sense, but, on the one hand, we need some time to accept it, and on the other hand, we genuinely worry that Baozhu will be alone outside filming, and we won't be able to be by her side or know what's happening at all times.\"Qu Zhi interjected, \"You don't need to worry; I will be by her side.\"Both Su Mingxi and Grandma Su were taken aback for a moment, then they looked at each other and finally, Su Mingxi spoke, \"Qu Zhi, you and Baozhu grew up together, and you are so outstanding. We certainly trust you, but... you can't be by Baozhu's side forever, right? Eventually, you will get married to someone else, won't you?\"\"I won't.\"\"...Huh?\"\"I won't marry someone else,\" Qu Zhi gazed at them, as devout as when he discussed technological developments with Zheng Baozhu that day, \"I like Baozhu.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi\u00a0had known each other since primary school, and both families were quite familiar with each other. However, Su Mingxi had never considered setting up Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi because she knew they had not gotten along since they were little.So hearing Qu Zhi suddenly say he liked Zheng Baozhu, Su Mingxi was a bit puzzled, \"Um, Qu Zhi, I know you want to help Baozhu, but you don't have to tell such lies.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi fell silent for a moment and looked at Su Mingxi, \"Aunt Su, although there were misunderstandings between Baozhu and me when we were young, after I came back this time, we got to know each other in a new light. I'm not saying this to cover for Baozhu or on a whim. You have watched me grow up, and you know my character. I wouldn't make up something like this.\"\"Well, that's true. You've always taken everything seriously since you were young,\" Su Mingxi thought Qu Zhi wouldn't casually make things up, but still found it somewhat unbelievable, \"So, you mean you realized you liked Baozhu after returning home this time?\"\"You can say that,\" Qu Zhi didn't deny it, \"So, there's no need to worry. I will be by Baozhu's side and won't let her bear those negative emotions alone. If any symptoms of depression arise, I will accompany her through the treatment. So, please, allow Baozhu to pursue what she loves and follow her dreams.\"Su Mingxi exchanged a glance with Grandma Su, seemingly uncertain. They both remained silent for a moment before Su Mingxi spoke again, \"Qu Zhi, you suddenly said this, and we weren't prepared, but if you and Baozhu talk about it, we will certainly feel relieved. But about you liking Baozhu, have you told her yet?\"\"Not yet,\" Qu Zhi's lips tightened with a trace of distress, \"Because of past misunderstandings, I want to find a suitable opportunity to tell her.\"\"Oh, I see...\" Su Mingxi nodded slowly, then looked at him, \"Qu Zhi, I don't doubt you, but you also have a busy schedule in your research work. Look at your parents; they're hardly ever at home all year round. I guess you won't have much time to accompany Baozhu.\"Qu Zhi explained, \"Aunt Su, research projects vary, even between me and my parents. I won't be like them, locked up in a research base. I can go home every day.\"\"But if Baozhu is filming outside...\"\"Aunt Su, times have changed in the last twenty years.\" Qu Zhi preempted what Su Mingxi was about to say, \"During these twenty years, our country has rapidly developed, not only economically but also in technology and infrastructure. The internet allows people thousands of miles apart to see each other anytime. We can have daily calls and video chats. If we want to meet in person, it's just a two to three-hour flight away. Distance is not a problem in modern society.\"As soon as Zheng Baozhu walked in, she heard Qu Zhi's remarks. She paused with her phone in hand and looked at Qu Zhi's straight back, \"Ah, are you giving a technology lecture? Right on time.\"Dr. Qu truly lived up to his name; there seemed to be no limit to his knowledge-sharing, regardless of time and place!Qu Zhi turned around and looked at Zheng Baozhu. Su Mingxi and Grandma Su also focused their gazes on her, resulting in an eerie silence in the room.\"...\"Zheng Baozhu felt a bit embarrassed under their gaze, \"Did I interrupt your lecture? Well, I also want to hear it. Is it not allowed?\"\"............\"In the end, Su Mingxi's awkward laughter broke the silence, \"Haha, you came in a bit late. We've already finished the lecture.\"Zheng Baozhu shrugged; she wasn't actually interested in the lecture. She walked up to her grandmother and bent down to look at the wheelchair, \"Grandma, how's it going?\"\"Good, good,\" Grandma Su chuckled and nodded.\"That's great,\" Zheng Baozhu also nodded, \"If you encounter any problems, you can call me anytime. And since we have a new wheelchair at home, we should leave some extra space and not clutter the room with unnecessary things.\"\"Who said I don't want those things? You don't need to worry. With such a large house, I still have plenty of room for a wheelchair,\" Grandma Su demonstrated by moving around with the chair, \"You see, it's flexible.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"\"By the way, when you go back today, visit Teacher Ge as well,\" Grandma Su finished showcasing the wheelchair and began giving instructions again, \"Teacher Ge came to see me last time during the holiday. We should pay him a visit too. It is not convenient for me, so I'll have you go on my behalf. Take the snacks and drinks by the sofa with you, and while you're there, tell him that I'm doing fine and there's no need to worry.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded; it was also an opportunity to give Teacher Ge the certificates from her charity work.\"Then you and Qu Zhi go out first. Your grandfather is cooking, you two can have lunch here. Your mom and I will discuss this wheelchair further.\"\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu glanced at Qu Zhi and walked out with him. Once they left, Su Mingxi closed the door and started a little discussion with her mother.\"You see, what did I say?\" Grandma Su's eyes sparkled with the wisdom of an elder, \"Ever since that time Qu Zhi chased after our Baozhu back in fifth grade, I knew he couldn't bear to be without her!\"Su Mingxi: \"...\"She felt it might not be the case.\"Do you think what Qu Zhi said just now was true?\" Grandma Su asked Su Mingxi. After thinking for a moment, Su Mingxi nodded, \"Qu Zhi is a reliable kid. If he said that, he must really mean it.\"Grandma Su also nodded, feeling somewhat relieved, \"If Baozhu and Qu Zhi really get together, it will definitely be a good thing. There's a saying in books that being with someone outside of work can lead to healing and self-discovery. If Baozhu has a stable relationship, it should be beneficial.\"\"Yes, having someone by her side to care for her is definitely better. Moreover, we can trust Qu Zhi,\" To be honest, Su Mingxi had always been worried about Zheng Baozhu's future relationships since she was as beautiful as her late sister. Su Mingxi feared that Zheng Baozhu might encounter someone unsuitable, \"Qu Zhi is intelligent and attentive, so he might even notice things about Baozhu more easily than we do.\"\"You're right, but he hasn't confessed his feelings to Baozhu yet,\" Grandma Su suddenly noticed a loophole, \"We can make all these plans, but in the end, it depends on whether he takes action or not.\"In the living room, Zheng Baozhu sat on the sofa and curiously asked Qu Zhi, \"How did you end up talking about technological development just now?\"\"...\"Qu Zhi's face remained calm as he said, \"We talked about it from the perspective of wheelchair development and its changes.\"\"Oh... you never cease to amaze me.\"Qu Zhi glanced at her and asked, \"What about you? Who were you sneakily talking to on the phone earlier?\"\"Who else but Director Gao,\" Zheng Baozhu whispered as she chatted with him, \"He asked if everything was settled at home, afraid that I wouldn't be able to come back to the set for additional filming later.\"\"Oh,\" Qu Zhi nodded, \"I think about ninety percent of it should be resolved. The remaining ten percent might just need a bit more time.\"Zheng Baozhu widened her eyes, \"How is it already ninety percent?\" Judging from her grandmother's attitude before, it would be at most sixty percent, no more.Qu Zhi didn't say anything, and seeing Zheng Baozhu didn't press him further, he heaved a sigh and dropped the topic. After having lunch at her grandmother's place, Zheng Baozhu carried multiple bags of gifts for Teacher Ge and headed downstairs to get the car. Qu Zhi saw that she couldn't handle it all with both hands and wanted to help, but Su Mingxi stopped him before they left the house, \"Qu Zhi.\"She motioned for him to come over. Qu Zhi glanced at Zheng Baozhu, then stepped back and asked, \"What's the matter, Aunt Su?\"Su Mingxi smiled warmly at him and said, \"Nothing much, I just want to tell you that you should tell your feelings to Baozhu sooner rather than later. If there's anything we can do to help, we're more than willing to do so.\"\"Okay,\" Confessing his feelings to Zheng Baozhu was still somewhat awkward for Qu Zhi, \"I'll find the right opportunity to talk to her. Thank you, Aunt Su.\"\"That's good to hear. Now, you two go on, and be careful on the way.\"\"Okay,\" Only then did Qu Zhi go out to catch up with Zheng Baozhu.The house where Zheng Baozhu's grandparents lived was purchased by her uncle and her mother together when she was in university. It was a property in a building with elevators, which was more suitable for the elderly. Zheng Baozhu waited for a while in the elevator lobby, carrying her things, until Qu Zhi arrived. She glanced at him and asked, \"Why are you walking so slowly?\"Qu Zhi pressed the elevator button and casually took the things Zheng Baozhu was carrying, \"Aunt Su said a few things to me before we left.\"Curiously, Zheng Baozhu asked, \"What did my mom say to you?\"\"She asked me to take good care of you,\" Qu Zhi replied.\"Ahem...\" Zheng Baozhu felt a bit uneasy and looked up at the descending numbers. Although she knew that her mom didn't mean anything else when saying that, it was still a little strange to hear Qu Zhi say it out loud.\"By the way, I need to go see Teacher Ge first. Do you want to come with me?\" She stared at the elevator door and asked Qu Zhi.Qu Zhi nodded, \"Sure, it's not convenient for you to carry so many things.\"\"Yeah, the alley where Teacher Ge lives is not suitable for driving. Usually, I just park the car outside and walk in,\" she explained.Qu Zhi chuckled and said, \"It's okay, I can help you carry the things.\"Worried that Teacher Ge might be celebrating the Lunar New Year at his relatives' home, Zheng Baozhu had called him in advance to confirm his availability, \"Teacher Ge said he's at home. Let's go straight there,\" She opened the car door and let Qu Zhi put everything on the back seat.Among the items was a certificate she received for her charitable work as the tuition fees. Qu Zhi took a glance at it, then put the things down and closed the door.The roads were not too crowded today, so Zheng Baozhu drove smoothly. When they arrived at Teacher Ge's place, she parked the car outside and walked in with Qu Zhi.Aunt Wang, who was out shopping, saw Zheng Baozhu walking toward her and greeted her with surprise, \"Baozhu, it's been a while since you last came!\"With a smile, Zheng Baozhu replied, \"I was busy filming on the set, so I didn't have time for classes.\"\"Oh, I know!\" Aunt Wang clapped her hands with excitement, \"Is it for 'New Moon Wuxin Sword'? I saw it online, your look is so pretty!\"As she said this, Aunt Wang noticed Qu Zhi standing next to Zheng Baozhu. She took a closer look at this tall and handsome man and hesitated before asking Zheng Baozhu, \"Baozhu, is this your boyfriend?\"Zheng Baozhu glanced at Qu Zhi and thought about how eager Aunt Wang had been to introduce someone to her before. She lightly nodded her head and said, \"It's close enough.\"Qu Zhi didn't expect her to admit it and he glanced at her with surprise. Aunt Wang's expression also changed for a moment, but then she forced a smile and said, \"Oh, oh, this young man looks handsome. Why didn't you tell me you had a boyfriend?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"We just confirmed our relationship recently.\"Indeed, it was just confirmed, very recently.Aunt Wang could only say, \"It's okay, it's okay. You came to see Teacher Ge, right? I just saw him in the courtyard. He should be waiting for you. Hurry and go.\"\"Alright, then, see you later, Aunt Wang,\" Zheng Baozhu said and handed her a few pieces of fruit. After she and Qu Zhi walked away, Aunt Wang watched their backs and couldn't help shaking her head, \"Ah, he's so talented and good-looking. I knew my nephew wouldn't have a chance.\"As Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu walked ahead, he casually asked, \"Was that Aunt Wang trying to introduce someone to you?\"\"Yeah, she's been really eager about it,\" Zheng Baozhu said, \"I told her there's no need, but she just can't sit still.\"\"Oh, who did she want to introduce to you?\"\"Seems like her nephew, a doctor at some hospital.\"Qu Zhi said, \"Doctors have busy jobs, they may be called in for emergency surgeries at any time. If there are special cases, they can be even busier. They might not be available for days or even half a month.\"\"...Well,\" Zheng Baozhu glanced at him sideways, \"Aren't you researchers almost the same?\"\"I can go home every day,\" Qu Zhi responded.\"...Oh, you're quite proud,\" she teased him, \"We're here.\"Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi arrived at Teacher Ge's doorstep. She glanced into the courtyard and indeed saw Teacher Ge sitting in the pavilion, with a teapot on the table and an old-fashioned charcoal stove at his feet.\"Teacher Ge,\" Zheng Baozhu called out as she walked in. Ge Hongyi looked towards the entrance and saw a young man walking in with Zheng Baozhu. He vaguely remembered seeing this young man at Grandma Su's place before. He initially thought he was a relative, but now, seeing him here with Zheng Baozhu, it was more likely that he was her boyfriend?He greeted Zheng Baozhu with a smile and then looked at Qu Zhi, \"Who is this young man?\"\"Oh, he's Qu Zhi, my old classmate,\" Zheng Baozhu said and then whispered to Ge Hongyi, \"But I just told Aunt Wang that he's my boyfriend, so when you see Aunt Wang, please say he's my boyfriend too.\"Hearing this, Ge Hongyi smiled and nodded, \"Sure, got it.\" He smiled at Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi, \"Your old classmate and you grew up together since childhood?\"\"Yes.\"\"So, childhood sweethearts?\"\"...\"In the past, Zheng Baozhu would have firmly denied it and said they were arch-enemies. But now, she suddenly realized that she didn't seem to mind that much.\"Where do you work now, Mr. Qu?\" Ge Hongyi asked Qu Zhi with a smile.\"You can just call me Qu Zhi. I work at the Science and Technology Park,\" Qu Zhi replied.Ge Hongyi pondered for a moment, \"Is it the newly built Science and Technology Park in the south of the city?\"\"Yes.\"\"That place attracts high-end talents recruited by the government. It seems like you're quite outstanding,\" Ge Hongyi remarked, adding, \"A good match for Baozhu.\"Zheng Baozhu felt her heart inexplicably flutter, quickly pushing the gifts they brought towards Ge Hongyi, \"Teacher Ge, these are gifts from my grandmother. For the New Year's greetings.\"\"Very thoughtful of you,\" Ge Hongyi set the gifts aside and asked Zheng Baozhu, \"How is your grandmother doing?\"\"It's not a big problem; you don't need to worry, Teacher Ge,\" Zheng Baozhu said gratefully, \"Thank you for visiting my grandmother. Her attitude has changed now.\"\"That's good to hear. Please take a seat; we can chat while enjoying some tea,\" Ge Hongyi invited them to sit down, placing two tea cups in front of them and pouring tea.\"By the way, Teacher Ge, these are certificates I received for my charity work. Since I did it under your name, could you please keep these certificates?\" Zheng Baozhu handed over the certificates she had received. Ge Hongyi glanced at them and placed the certificates together with the gifts Zheng Baozhu brought, \"Sure, I will keep them safe.\"After taking a sip of tea, Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment and then spoke up, \"Teacher Ge, actually, there's something I wanted to ask you about today.\"Ge Hongyi nodded, \"Go ahead.\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"My grandmother showed me my aunt's final letter; in it, she mentioned that before her passing, my aunt was involved with a man. Do you happen to know who that man was?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayGe Hongyi had never met this man, but he had heard about him from Su Mingmei's family. When Zheng Baozhu asked him about it, he was momentarily stunned, then shook his head, \"After Mingmei graduated, we didn't keep in touch much. Your grandmother and others did ask me about Mingmei's relationships, but what I knew was all from the industry, as I mentioned last time. As for the person mentioned in the letter, I have no idea.\"\"I see,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded lightly and didn't pursue the matter further. Based on the letter's description, she felt that the man might have been a friend of her aunt or someone they knew. Back then, if they often met, her aunt's staff should probably know about it. She wondered if her grandmother and others had asked her aunt's staff about it.\"Baozhu, why are you inquiring about this?\" Ge Hongyi asked.Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and replied, \"I don't have any specific intention; I just wanted to know who this person was.\"\"And what difference would it make if you found out? This happened so long ago and Mingmei is no longer with us. It would only bring unnecessary trouble,\" Ge Hongyi said, sighing lightly, \"Your grandmother and others were probably curious about this person back then, but it seems they didn't find out in the end.\"Zheng Baozhu understood his reasoning, but she still felt somewhat frustrated. People only knew that Su Mingmei had committed suicide, but they didn't know that in the final stage of her life, she encountered such a scumbag!\"When Mingmei was in school, I noticed that she was easily immersed in her roles, more so than other classmates. It was harder for her to snap out of character,\" Ge Hongyi reminisced about the past, speaking calmly, \"I also sought help for this issue, but there wasn't a very good solution. If she only acted in ordinary roles, it wouldn't be a big problem, but many of the movies Mingmei acted in were more artistic or realistic. After playing Xiu Na, she clearly showed signs of depression.\"Zheng Baozhu was briefly taken aback; Xiu Na was the role her aunt played in the movie -- she had participated in the supporting actor audition by reenacting a scene as Xiu Na from that movie. The story mainly revolved around the restraint and exploitation imposed by a feudal family and was an early work with such subject matter. The main character, Xiu Na, lived a life of oppression and despair.\"Later, when she was going to act in 'Spring No More', I was worried, but I didn't expect... sigh,\" Ge Hongyi didn't continue speaking.Zheng Baozhu soon changed the subject and they chatted about other things for a while. Eventually, Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi said their goodbyes. As they walked outside, Zheng Baozhu remained silent, looking gloomy. Qu Zhi noticed her mood and asked, \"What are you thinking about?\"\"Huh?\" Zheng Baozhu snapped back to reality and glanced at him, \"I'm not thinking about anything.\"Naturally, Qu Zhi didn't believe her. He thought for a moment and asked, \"What about the man you mentioned to Ge Hongyi? What about him?\"At the mention of that scumbag, Zheng Baozhu let out a cold snort, \"He didn't get what he deserved; he simply made the same mistakes that men all around the world make.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"\"If only people like him could uphold some sense of decency and not try to seduce young and innocent girls after getting married.\"Qu Zhi now understood what was going on, \"Are you planning to find him and give him a good beating?\"\"...\"She was tempted to do just that, \"I want to condemn him morally!\"\"Alright.\"As they spoke, a private car approached from behind the alley. The alley was narrow, with barely enough space for one car to pass through, let alone for Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi, who were walking side by side. The car honked a few times from behind but didn't slow down. Qu Zhi immediately grabbed Zheng Baozhu's wrist, pulling her to the side of the wall, and he stepped forward to block the car's path.The private car narrowly passed by Qu Zhi and then honked at the person in front.With her back against the wall and Qu Zhi's face close to hers, Zheng Baozhu had to admit that Qu Zhi had really good skin. Seeing him up close, she noticed no flaws, and due to the close proximity, his appearance seemed even more attractive.His breath lightly fell on her face, and as she raised her eyes slightly, she met his passionate gaze. Her heart couldn't help but race faster, and his hand resting on her waist, despite the thick winter clothing, made her skin feel warm.Stiffening, Zheng Baozhu's mind went blank for a moment, the only sound she could hear was the thumping of her heartbeat ringing in her ears.\"Are you alright?\" Qu Zhi slowly let go and stepped back slightly. Zheng Baozhu inwardly composed herself and shook her head, \"I'm... I'm fine, thank you.\"\"Mm,\" Qu Zhi replied and continued walking toward the alley entrance. Zheng Baozhu remained silent for the entire journey, and her heart slowly returned to normal, but she still felt somewhat off.Why did she react so strongly just now? Qu Zhi had only gotten a bit closer and placed his hand on her waist! Why did she act like she had never experienced such a thing before? Her heart felt like it was about to leap out of her chest!It's as if she were an innocent young girl experiencing her first crush! Help!When Zheng Baozhu thought about it again, her cheeks started to blush.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Absolutely ridiculous. :)\"Why is your face so red? Are you feeling unwell somewhere?\" Seeing her flushed cheeks, Qu Zhi whispered, wanting to check her forehead's temperature with the back of his hand. Zheng Baozhu abruptly leaned back, \"I'm fine!\"\"...'\" Qu Zhi's hand paused in mid-air, then he withdrew it, \"That's good then.\"\"Haha,\" Zheng Baozhu forced a smile. She noticed a hint of disappointment in his dark eyes and started to reflect on whether her previous actions had hurt him.\"...\" She didn't know what to say. Zheng Baozhu felt speechless about herself, \"Let's head to your place now.\"Qu Zhi followed and got into the car, but after some thought, he changed his mind, \"How about we meet tomorrow? We've been to so many places today, and you must be tired.\"\"Sure, either way is fine,\" Zheng Baozhu didn't think too much and readily agreed.Qu Zhi said, \"Then I'll come to see you when I set off tomorrow.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu buckled her seatbelt and drove the car out.After returning to the hotel, Zheng Baozhu went straight to her room instead of hanging out with Qu Zhi any longer. She felt that spending too much time with him lately had made her abnormal!After much consideration, she finally sent a message to the experienced Meng Yaxin: \"Is it normal to blush and have a racing heart when you see any man after being single for too long?\"Meng Yaxin: ...? No, that's not normal at all.Meng Yaxin: Who made your face blush and your heart race?Zheng Baozhu: No one.Meng Yaxin: Since you came to me, you should be honest, or how can I help you analyze it?Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and conceded, \"There's no one. It's just Qu Zhi.\"Meng Yaxin: ...Meng Yaxin: Wait for a moment.Zheng Baozhu: What are you going to do?Meng Yaxin: I'm going to check if Tongtong's keyboards have been sold or not.Zheng Baozhu: ...Coming to find Meng Yaxin meant admitting that her mind wasn't clear right now.Yes, that's right. It must be because of recent events that her mind wasn't clear, causing her to blush and have a racing heart even around Qu Zhi.With this understanding, everything made sense, and Zheng Baozhu confidently closed Meng Yaxin's chat window.Thinking about how Gao Boyun specially called today to ask her to register on Weibo, she sat on the sofa and opened the Weibo app. The Weibo account she had been using had too much personal information, so she had to register a new one. After sitting there for a while, she finally set up the new account.Once the new account was ready, she immediately sent the account information to Gao Boyun: \"Reporting to Director Gao, my new Weibo account is ready!\"Gao Boyun seemed to have no personal life whatsoever and replied promptly, \"Good, I'll take a look.\"Zheng Baozhu's new account was named [Zheng Baozhu]. She chose a still from Ye Ling's drama as her profile picture. She adjusted it several times and finally selected the most attractive one.It's evident that the burden of being an idol is heavy.Gao Boyun: Alright, apply for the V certification as well, you can mention me and the producer in the application, and we'll confirm it for you.Zheng Baozhu: Ok.Gao Boyun: ...Why do I, as a director, have to take care of this kind of thing? This is what you call a babysitter-level director, right?Zheng Baozhu: [pat on the back.jpg]When Zheng Baozhu applied for verification, Gao Boyun had the TV drama Weibo account re-edit the profile picture and mentioned Zheng Baozhu in the post. He even left a comment under the post.In the end, afraid that fans might not notice, he told his Weibo account manager, \"Forget it, just repost another Weibo and let everyone know that Zheng Baozhu has opened a Weibo account. After all, there were many fans asking before, right?\"Weibo Account Manager: Alright, boss!The account manager willingly reposted another Weibo and made sure to modify the pinned post as well.After Zheng Baozhu completed the verification application, she found that she already had over a thousand followers! Oh my, does this mean she's becoming popular? She had been using her personal Weibo account for so many years, and it only had a little over a thousand followers!Now with just one verification application post, all the fans followed and commented on it. Zheng Baozhu scrolled through the comments, and many fans were requesting her to post a selfie. Since it was the Spring Festival, she thought she should appear festive and cheerful, so she went to her hat rack and found a red scarf to put on.After redoing her makeup and adding some accessories, Zheng Baozhu finally took a selfie and posted it on Weibo.Zheng Baozhu: Hello, everyone. I'm the actress who plays Ye Ling, Zheng Baozhu. Thank you all for your support. ^^ [Image]It was the first time she openly introduced herself as an actress, so Zheng Baozhu was a bit nervous.Fans were eagerly waiting for her Weibo post, and as soon as the selfie was posted, they started leaving enthusiastic comments.\u300cWife!!!!!!\u300dZheng Baozhu: \"......\"No need to be that extreme.\u300cAh ah ah ah, you look so beautiful, my wife! Modern outfits suit you so well!\u300d\u300cI just came here to leave a \u300d\u300cI've seen your set picture. You're really stunning!! You are definitely going to be popular!\u300d\u300cBaozhu, do you have any other works? I want to see them, humble.jpg.\u300dZheng Baozhu thought for a moment, she actually had quite a few works, even if they were just extra roles and small supporting roles, she was still part of them. But those dramas where she had those roles wouldn't be airing anytime soon, the earliest would be in the second half of the year.As Zheng Baozhu was about to reply to one lucky fan, she received a message from Gao Boyun: Don't interact too much with them. After the drama is aired, let them explore on their own!\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu deleted the reply she was about to send and then asked Gao Boyun: So, Director Gao, have you been watching my Weibo posts all along?Gao Boyun: I'm just worried that you don't have a manager and might not know much!Zheng Baozhu: \"......\"I think you're the one who might not know much.But for now, she should still address him as Director Gao and not be too arrogant.Gao Boyun: You really need a manager. Weibo is the place where you showcase yourself. Everything you say and do will be interpreted by everyone.Zheng Baozhu: Oh, I know. It's all about building an image, right?If it's just about building an image, she felt like she could ask Qu Zhi to be her manager.Of course, Dr. Qu probably wouldn't have the time for that.Zheng Baozhu: I will consider getting a manager. Before that, I won't say much on Weibo. Please rest assured, Director Gao.Gao Boyun: If you don't say anything, I might forget that I'm just a director.Gao Boyun: By the way, I have a suitable friend who could be your manager. Are you free tomorrow? I'll arrange for you to meet.Zheng Baozhu: Huh? Isn't it still the Spring Festival? Doesn't your friend have a day off?Gao Boyun: ...Just tell me if you have any plans tomorrow.Zheng Baozhu: I have plans to go with Qu Zhi to check out some houses tomorrow.Gao Boyun: ??? Are you buying a wedding house? Didn't you say you weren't serious with him??Zheng Baozhu: No! We're not buying a house. He already bought one!!Gao Boyun: What??? You two are moving so fast.Zheng Baozhu: ......I'm tired. I don't want to explain anymore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 54": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng Baozhu's Weibo quickly got the verified yellow V badge. She shared her Weibo in the small group that Meng Yaxin had originally invited her to and announced: Sisters, my actor Weibo is ready! Everyone go follow it!Meng Yaxin: As soon as you posted it, I followed!Zheng Baozhu: Reliable!Cen Tongtong: I'm relieved to hear you call Qu Zhi 'sister'.Zheng Baozhu: ......Qu Zhi: @Zheng Baozhu, can we meet at 9:30 tomorrow morning?Cen Tongtong: ??? What are you two going to do?Qu Zhi: Check out the house renovation.Cen Tongtong: Whose house? What house??Meng Yaxin: I'm guessing it's the wedding house.\u00a0 Tongtong, do you still have time to chat here? Weren't you rushing to sell your keyboards?Zheng Baozhu: If you have time to chat here, why not find a job?Meng Yaxin: Soon, soon.Zheng Baozhu: ...Goodbye.She exited WeChat and locked her phone.The next morning at 9:30, Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi went to Golden\u00a0Jade Mansion. Some of the units were already draped with red cloth, indicating they were under renovation. Zheng Baozhu parked the car at the entrance and asked Qu Zhi, \"Did you buy a parking space?\"Qu Zhi nodded, \"Yes.\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"Then should we go through the underground garage?\"\"Sure.\"Zheng Baozhu hadn't seen the underground garage on her first two visits, so today she finally took a look. The underground garage was brightly lit, and the floor was coated with epoxy paint, so there was not much dust.\"Not bad,\" They followed the signs and found Qu Zhi's parking space. She parked the car in the designated space, which was close to the residential block. Zheng Baozhu murmured as she got out of the car, \"When they open the second batch, won't all the good parking spots be gone?\"Upon hearing this, Qu Zhi asked after closing the car door, \"Are you still planning to buy a house here?\"\"Yes.\" Zheng Baozhu slung her bag over her shoulder and nodded, \"I like the layout of this place, and the price-to-value ratio is high. Don't just judge it based on the current market. Once the South City develops completely, the property prices in this area will definitely rise significantly.\"Qu Zhi chuckled, \"Yes, that's what they all say in real estate sales.\"Just as he finished speaking, they saw a fluffy thing swiftly running past them. Qu Zhi froze for a moment and stood still. Zheng Baozhu also saw the creature and immediately reassured Qu Zhi, \"Don't worry, it's a cat, not a dog!\"Just then, a small head popped out from behind a pillar, and the little creature meowed at them.Qu Zhi seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, and the tension on his face eased, \"Probably a stray cat nearby. Let's go.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu followed him while observing his expression, finding it somewhat amusing, \"You're so afraid of dogs. What will you do if your girlfriend has a dog in the future?\"Qu Zhi remained silent for a moment before saying, \"She doesn't have a dog.\"\"Huh?\" Now Zheng Baozhu was puzzled. What did Qu Zhi mean by that? Did he already have a girlfriend??Shocked, she asked, \"Who's that girl? When did you start dating?\"Qu Zhi, however, didn't elaborate further and appeared evasive. Seeing him acting like this, Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but guess on her own.According to Qu Zhi's own words, he didn't have any girlfriends abroad, so he must have met this girl after returning to China. Dr. Qu's daily life was quite simple; when he wasn't at work, he was on his way to work. If he had made friends, the most likely possibility was his colleagues!\"I know, is it someone from your research lab?\" She asked curiously.Qu Zhi glanced at her and denied, \"No.\"\"Not from the lab?\" Zheng Baozhu furrowed her brows in doubt and then widened her eyes, covering her mouth with her hand, \"Could it be a male colleague?\"Qu Zhi's gaze looked as if he were looking at a fool, \"Can you think of something useful in your head?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"Well, you're always at the company, so how could you find time to meet anyone?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"I don't spend 24 hours a day at the company. I go back to the hotel too.\"Now even more shocked, Zheng Baozhu exclaimed, \"You actually flirted with one of my hotel staff?!\"Qu Zhi: ...At that moment, the elevator door \"dinged\" open, and Qu Zhi stepped out, \"We've arrived.\"Zheng Baozhu followed him, still wanting to ask about the girl, but Qu Zhi skillfully changed the subject like a male celebrity avoiding paparazzi questions, \"The water and electricity have been set up right before the holiday. We're going to install floor heating soon.\"The house had changed significantly since Zheng Baozhu's last visit. Qu Zhi had altered the structure, making the living room look even more spacious. After going through the house, Zheng Baozhu complimented, \"Your contractor did a good job with the water and electricity.\"Qu Zhi said, \"The project manager is a friend of Qi Sheng's. He's in charge of both mine and Qi Sheng's houses.\"\"Oh...good,\" If it's Qi Sheng's friend, then they probably won't be cheated. They looked around the house for a while, took a few more photos, and left without encountering the stray cat from earlier.On the way back, Qu Zhi casually asked Zheng Baozhu, \"Do you want to have lunch together?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"I already have plans for lunch.\"Qu Zhi raised an eyebrow and asked, \"Who did you make plans with?\"\"Gao Boyun,\" Zheng Baozhu turned her head at the intersection, \"He said he wanted to introduce a manager for me, so we're meeting for lunch at our hotel.\"\"Our hotel?\" Qu Zhi unintentionally repeated her words. Zheng Baozhu glanced at him playfully and said, \"You really don't hold back. The hotel is 'ours' now?\"Qu Zhi awkwardly cleared his throat, \"I was just repeating what you said.\"\"Alright, alright,\" Zheng Baozhu said while driving, \"Gao Boyun mentioned before that he wanted to come to our hotel for a meal. Finally, he found the opportunity today. I've booked a private room, so we won't go out for lunch.\"Qu Zhi nodded, \"Okay, then let's plan for another time.\"\"Sure,\" Zheng Baozhu agreed, but then she suddenly realized something was off. How did she end up making plans with Qu Zhi??After they arrived back at Starlight Farm, Qu Zhi unbuckled his seatbelt, opened the car door, and said, \"You better not drink alcohol during lunch.\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him with some defiance, \"Why? I have a good alcohol tolerance. Last time, those CEOs were the ones who couldn't keep up with me!\"Qu Zhi didn't say anything, and suddenly, several images flashed through Zheng Baozhu's mind\u2014the exposed neckline under Qu Zhi's open collar and her lips brushing against his mouth.\"...\"Her face turned red.\"It seems I don't need to help you remember,\" Qu Zhi said, then glanced at her and got out of the car. After closing the door, Zheng Baozhu watched his back through the rearview mirror and mumbled, \"Hmph, clearly, before you came back, I was perfectly fine after drinking.\"Indeed, Qu Zhi always wins.But today, she was just meeting a manager, so there was no drinking involved. She had no intention of drinking. Returning to her room, she changed her clothes and went downstairs early to wait for Gao Boyun.As it was close to noon, customers who had reserved tables for lunch started to arrive one after another. Zheng Baozhu was originally sitting on the sofa in the lobby when she overheard some people talking about her. She looked up and saw a few customers waiting in the lobby, continually glancing at her.Wei Zhen hurriedly walked over and handed her a mask, saying, \"Miss Baozhu, it seems like they recognized you as Zheng Baozhu, the actress who is playing Ye Ling. You'd better not sit here.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She didn't expect that even as a minor supporting role, she would receive such treatment now! Being part of a big IP was truly amazing!With her mask on, Zheng Baozhu prepared to wait directly in the private room for Gao Boyun. The customers who had been watching also seemed to want to follow, but they were intercepted by Wei Zhen, \"Excuse me, your private room is ready. You can go to the room and wait.\"One of the customers stared at Zheng Baozhu's retreating figure and asked Wei Zhen, \"Wasn't that Zheng Baozhu? The actress who's playing Ye Ling!\"\"Yes, yes, we all think she looks more and more like her. She's really beautiful! Is she here to have lunch as well?\"Wei Zhen replied, \"I'm sorry, we can't discuss our customers' private matters. How about you go to the private room first and have some tea? Our tea is also famous.\"\"Alright!\" the customers were persuaded to the private room by Wei Zhen.Zheng Baozhu waited in the private room until Gao Boyun arrived. He was accompanied by someone who looked a bit older than Zheng Baozhu but exuded an air of competence, making her seem very reliable.Gao Boyun entered and removed his scarf, then introduced this person to Zheng Baozhu, \"This is Zhou Xiaonan. You can call her Sister Xiaonan. She used to work at Starlight Entertainment and managed Tang Shiran and B\u00b7I\u00b7G. Although they were all idol singers, she's excellent at what she does. She'll be more than capable of managing you.\"Tang Shiran and B\u00b7I\u00b7G were both idols from Starlight Entertainment, Zheng Baozhu had heard of them. However, they had been on a downhill trend in the past two years, and their influence had gradually diminished.Zheng Baozhu smiled and invited them to sit down, \"You both can sit first and have some tea. I've already ordered the dishes. We can chat while eating.\"\"Okay,\" Zhou Xiaonan sat down on the chair and glanced around, \"I heard from Director Gao when I came here that this hotel belongs to Boss Zheng?\"Zheng Baozhu smiled, \"You can just call me by my name. No need for 'boss'. I am indeed in the business and only started acting a few months ago. I hope Sister Xiaonan won't look down on me.\"\"Not at all,\" Zhou Xiaonan took a sip of tea and said, \"In such a short time, you were able to go from an extra to play the role of Ye Ling. It shows that you have both talent and luck. Your appearance is outstanding too, I heard you're also studying under Teacher Ge. You have great potential.\"Gao Boyun, sipping his tea on the side, commented, \"So, are we in the stage of mutual praise now?\"Zhou Xiaonan chuckled and looked at him, \"I'm speaking the truth. If I didn't think highly of her, why would I be so concerned about her business?\"Gao Boyun replied, \"I'm just looking out for you, Sister Xiaonan. You have an artist in need of a manager, while you are in need of an artist. Isn't that a perfect match? I'm just helping to make connections, but in the end, it's up to you to decide.\"Zheng Baozhu looked at Zhou Xiaonan and asked, \"I saw someone on the forum claiming that you left Starlight Entertainment. Is that true?\"Zhou Xiaonan nodded and said, \"I wasn't the top manager at Starlight, but I did groom B\u00b7I\u00b7G from the beginning. However, after they became popular, I found that my principles and the company's principles were getting further apart. I said that if B\u00b7I\u00b7G wanted to last, they needed to transform, and the same went for Tang Shiran later on. The company only wanted to maximize their value when they were popular and didn't plan for their long-term development. You know that Starlight Entertainment is best at selecting and creating stars. If this group is no longer popular, they'll just bring in the next batch. They never worry about not having talents. I also raised concerns about this model with the higher-ups, but they didn't care because this model has the lowest risk. As long as one person becomes successful, they've made a profit.\"Zheng Baozhu listened attentively while nodding slightly. Starlight Entertainment had created many groups over the years, most of which were short-lived. Of course, there were some that stood out and remained popular until now, just as Zhou Xiaonan mentioned, the ones the company \"profited from\". However, the others declined over time, and their resources became scarce, leading to a vicious cycle.\"Starlight Entertainment is indeed not that great, it was right for you to leave,\" Gao Boyun commented from the side, \"Back then, both Tang Shiran and Ding Meng were from the same selection round. One went to Starlight Entertainment, while the other went to Guangchen Records. Look at Ding Meng now; she's already one of the top female singers in the industry, able to compete with Sima Xiaoxiao. As for Tang Shiran? She's about to disappear from the radar.\"Zhou Xiaonan sighed, \"Actually, Tang Shiran has talent. The main problem lies in the company's planning and packaging. I clashed with the higher-ups multiple times because of these issues, which led to me being sidelined at Starlight in the past two years. So I decided to resign.\"While they were chatting, the dishes were served one by one. Today, Gao Boyun specially chose this place for the delicious stir-fry. Zheng Baozhu had ordered a variety of dishes, and the aroma filled the air. Gao Boyun called over the server, saying, \"Bring us some drinks.\"Zheng Baozhu glanced at him and asked, \"You want to drink?\"Gao Boyun replied, \"Eating without drinking is boring, right? Do you want to drink? I know Sister Xiaonan has a good tolerance for alcohol.\"\"Just average,\" Zhou Xiaonan waved her hand, \"A beer will do for me. I'll drink a bit with you.\"\"Okay,\" Gao Boyun ordered some beer. Zheng Baozhu hadn't planned to drink, but the atmosphere at the table was great, and as everyone got carried away, she unknowingly started drinking too.The three of them finished all the beer Gao Boyun had ordered, but luckily, no one seemed drunk, at least not visibly. They discussed the collaboration briefly, exchanged contact information, and decided to talk in more detail later. After seeing off Zhou Xiaonan and Gao Boyun, Zheng Baozhu arranged for a designated driver to take them home. As she turned around, she saw Qu Zhi standing behind her.\"...\"Zheng Baozhu paused, \"What are you doing here?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"I just came down for a stroll and happened to see you.\"\"Just came down? Happened to see me?\" Zheng Baozhu looked at him, \"Why do I find that hard to believe?\"Qu Zhi didn't answer but asked, \"Have you been drinking?\"\"No, not at all,\" Zheng Baozhu replied, trying to appear sober.Qu Zhi looked somewhat helpless as he glanced at her, \"You still haven't learned your lesson. Let's go, I'll take you upstairs.\"\"No need,\" Zheng Baozhu waved him off, \"I'm not drunk.\"\"Oh,\" Qu Zhi responded, and they walked together towards the elevator. On the way, Zheng Baozhu continued updating Qu Zhi on her progress in finding a manager, \"I think Sister Xiaonan is nice and we get along well. I told her about my idea of starting a studio, and she supports it. We'll discuss how to set up the studio and even recruit people.\"Qu Zhi smiled and said, \"You're acting like a star without making money but spending a lot.\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"It's all an early investment; you wouldn't understand.\"\"Oh,\" The elevator doors opened; Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu walked out together. Qu Zhi reached his room's door, opened it, and found Zheng Baozhu still following him. He turned to look at her, \"Your room is over there.\"Zheng Baozhu looked up at him and said, \"Can't I come to your room for a while?\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"He can't guess what crazy things Zheng Baozhu had in mind today. :)Without waiting for his reply, Zheng Baozhu went into Qu Zhi's room by herself. Qu Zhi sighed in resignation and followed her, closing the door behind them.Zheng Baozhu kicked off her shoes and sat on Qu Zhi's sofa, \"Just now, Sister Xiaonan asked me to eat less. My goodness, saying that stars always have to eat lightly, and I eat too much.\"Qu Zhi lightly furrowed his brows as he walked over and sat on the side, \"You're already thin; why do you need to eat less?\"\"Hehe,\" Zheng Baozhu chuckled and leaned closer to Qu Zhi's ear, whispering, \"Let me tell you a secret. During these past few days of the New Year, I gained two pounds.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Zheng Baozhu's breath tickled his ear, turning his earlobe a bit red. He abruptly stood up and walked to the side, \"Let me get you something to drink.\"When Zheng Baozhu visited last time, she complained that Qu Zhi only had plain water. This time, Qu Zhi had prepared some drinks. He took out a bottle of beverage and heard Zheng Baozhu murmuring from behind, \"Qu Zhi, do you think if a person gains weight, their head will also become bigger? Why can't I take off my clothes anymore?\"Qu Zhi: ?????He quickly returned to the living room with the drink and saw Zheng Baozhu struggling to take off her shirt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Zheng\u00a0Baozhu, what are you doing again?\" Qu Zhi placed the drink on the table and held Zheng Baozhu's hands, stopping her from removing her clothes.Zheng Baozhu winced since Qu Zhi grabbed her wrist too tightly, \"Ouch, that hurts! Be gentler!\"\"...\"Qu Zhi eased the pressure but still held her wrists firmly. Zheng Baozhu looked up at him and suddenly laughed, \"Hahaha, why are you so nervous? I'm wearing something inside, you know!\"Saying that, she intentionally turned around, seemingly wanting to show Qu Zhi the open zipper and the light-colored undershirt underneath.Qu Zhi's expression changed, and he turned his gaze away, \"Even so, you shouldn't casually undress.\"\"But I feel suffocated in this outfit. I can't breathe,\" Zheng Baozhu frowned, \"I think I ate too much at lunch.\"\"...Remove the 'I think',\" Qu Zhi glanced at her, \"You ate too much, and on top of that, you drank so much alcohol.\"\"The three of us were drinking!\" Zheng Baozhu argued, \"And I wasn't even drunk. Do you remember the last time? Who helped you handle the people from the financial side after they got drunk?\"Qu Zhi said, \"And do you remember what you did after that?\"\"What did I do?\" Zheng Baozhu pretended not to understand.\"Heh.\" Qu Zhi scrolled through his phone, opened a video, and Zheng Baozhu's loud voice came from inside, \"Warrior, transform\u2014\u2014!\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback and tried to snatch his phone. Qu Zhi quickly raised the phone above his head, and Zheng Baozhu, sitting on the sofa, couldn't reach it, \"Qu Zhi, didn't I tell you to delete that video?\"\"Fortunately, I kept a backup. Otherwise, you'd keep acting dumb and denying it,\" Qu Zhi said.\"You!\" Zheng Baozhu stood up determined to take his phone. However, she accidentally stepped on her dress, causing her to fall directly onto Qu Zhi. Qu Zhi instinctively caught her, and as they fell onto the sofa, the hand holding the phone raised high also resulted in the phone dropping to the ground.A loud bang echoed and the room fell silent. Zheng Baozhu looked wide-eyed at the person beneath her on the sofa; and felt that the fleeting panic and unease in his eyes seemed somewhat... intriguing?Qu Zhi's hand rested on Zheng Baozhu's lower back, and the zipper was still undone, with his palm directly touching the thin fabric of her undershirt. The warmth from Zheng Baozhu's body transmitted to his hand, feeling like it was about to burn.Qu Zhi's expression was hesitant, but Zheng Baozhu, now lying obediently on him, didn't make any further moves. Qu Zhi's hand clenched slightly, then slowly relaxed, and finally, in this position, he pushed Zheng Baozhu's hair at the back of her head aside and zipped up the dress for her.The sound of metal echoed in the room, when Zheng Baozhu felt tightness around her waist, making it hard to breathe. She glared at Qu Zhi with dissatisfaction, \"Why did you zip up my dress?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"To prevent accidents.\"Zheng Baozhu clicked her tongue but didn't plan to get up from him. She just stared at him. Qu Zhi became more and more uncomfortable under her gaze, and his ears gradually turned red, \"Why are you staring at me like that?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"I'm practicing my eye expression. As an actress, eye expression is essential. It should be focused and not scattered.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi pursed his lips; he couldn't agree with such a ridiculous reason, \"Staring at me can improve your eye expression?\"\"Yes, I usually practice in front of a mirror. Since there's no mirror now, I'll use your eyes instead,\" Zheng Baozhu said.\"...\"Qu Zhi fell silent for a while and gently pushed the person lying on him, \"Why don't you get up? I'll find a mirror for you.\"\"Forget it,\" Zheng Baozhu huffed, finally getting up from him, \"I'll practice later.\"Qu Zhi let out a sigh of relief and also sat up from the sofa. Zheng Baozhu opened the drink he brought and started drinking. Qu Zhi glanced at her and suddenly became a bit angry, \"Zheng Baozhu, don't you know that I'm a man?\"Pfft, cough, Zheng Baozhu choked on the water in her mouth and coughed several times in a row. After catching her breath, she looked at Qu Zhi with a smile, \"What do you mean? Of course, I know. Hahaha.\"Qu Zhi smirked as well, \"So you did that on deliberately?\"\"Deliberately what?\" Zheng Baozhu drank the water in her hand and looked at him curiously. Qu Zhi exhaled deeply and decided not to argue with someone acting crazy under the influence of alcohol, \"Never mind, I didn't say anything.\"After finishing her drink, Zheng Baozhu let out a small burp and continued to stare at him.Qu Zhi raised his hand to block her gaze and said, \"Go back to your room after drinking.\"\"Tch, stingy,\" Zheng Baozhu stood up and took her bag, \"I'm leaving; no need to send me off.\"\"...I'll still walk you to avoid you going to the wrong room again,\" It didn't matter if she walked to his room, but if she entered someone else's room by mistake, that would be a problem. Qu Zhi opened the door for her as Zheng Baozhu flicked her long hair, holding her bag, and walked out. There was no sign of her acting crazy like before. Qu Zhi kept watching until she reached her room, then he closed the door and went back inside his own room.After returning to her room, Zheng Baozhu washed her face and took a nap. When she woke up, her mind was clear. She looked down at her sleeping attire and blinked her eyes lightly.Just now, in Qu Zhi's room, things happened, right???Help! In the past, whenever she drank alcohol, she might act a little crazy after closing the door and being alone in her room! In front of others, she always maintained a normal appearance!Zheng Baozhu didn't easily show signs of being drunk, so whenever she was drunk, one can't tell from her face at all. Her alcohol tolerance was decent, and she would never get so drunk that she would lose consciousness, so most people who drank with her think she had a good tolerance.But only she knows that once the door is closed, she has had her own personal concerts in the bathroom. :)However, ever since Qu Zhi returned to the country, she noticed that she couldn't wait until she got back to her room to act tipsy. It would start right on the way there! The first time was when she danced like a warrior in front of Qu Zhi, which she could still accept because it was similar to her previous antics. But later on, it became more and more abnormal!The last time, she heard the sound of him taking a bath and felt restless, even going so far as to touch him all over. And now, she ended up in his room! And she even lay him at some point??\"...\"Why did she change her way of acting crazy in front of Qu Zhi?Could it be that being single for too long really made her eccentric? :)No, it must be Qu Zhi's fault. She is not that kind of person!Running her fingers through her hair, she saw the schedule for the reshoots that the crew had sent her. The reshoots wouldn't take too long; she would only need to stay on the set for three days. Zheng Baozhu didn't pack too much since she still had some space left in her luggage. She even brought the foldable foot bath bucket that Qu Zhi had bought for her.Most of the reshoots involved action scenes. On the first day, Zheng Baozhu spent the whole day practicing martial arts in the training room on the set. Although the last wire stunt was quite intense, after such a long break, she surprisingly felt excited wearing the wires again.As the reshoot scenes were not extensive, she spent a day in the training room and then returned to the set on the second day. There was still a difference between rehearsing moves in the training room and performing them on set, especially since she had to wear the costume which was a bit restrictive. They had to make a few adjustments on the set before they could achieve the effect that Gao Boyun was satisfied with.Once again, Zheng Baozhu got some new bruises. She understood why actors nowadays tend to perform slower and repeat moves during fight scenes. Even for someone with over ten years of dance experience like her, it was tiring. Those without any martial arts background would definitely not be willing to endure such hardships.After all, lying down and making money was much easier.But on Gao Boyun's set, even top actors like Lin Ziqin couldn't get away with faking fight scenes. Gao Boyun had a genuine passion for martial arts, so naturally, he had high expectations for the fight scenes. In [New\u00a0Moon\u00a0Wuxin Sword], fight scenes were crucial; they accounted for almost half of the success of the project.During the break, Zheng Baozhu sat in Lin Ziqin's resting area, taking a break with him. The filming on the set would be completed soon and Zheng Baozhu would finally get some time off.Lin Ziqin sat beside her and started chatting, \"I heard from Boyun that you had some trouble before and almost couldn't make it here today?\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and replied, \"Yes, but it's mostly resolved now. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to be here today.\"Lin Ziqin nodded slightly and said, \"It would be a shame if you couldn't continue filming. Your photos have received great feedback, and once the show officially airs, you're bound to become popular.\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"I'll take that as a good omen from you, Teacher Lin!\"Lin Ziqin chuckled but didn't say anything. Zheng Baozhu noticed that he seemed preoccupied, so she asked, \"What's on your mind? You seem a bit off today.\"After some consideration, Lin Ziqin replied, \"It's nothing, just that some people online said I only know how to act in period dramas and always stay in my comfort zone. Lately, I've been thinking about whether I should stop taking period dramas after finishing this show.\"\"Oh, don't listen to them. They're just jealous of you!\" Zheng Baozhu was worried when she heard that Lin Ziqin didn't want to do period dramas anymore, \"You look great in period dramas, why stop? They just can't stand seeing you succeed! Besides, you've only done three period dramas; it's not like you've been doing the same thing over and over. Look at other actors in the past; many of them focused on one genre and did multiple projects. Now they're considered classics. By their standards, aren't they also staying in their comfort zone?\"Lin Ziqin listened to her passionate words and couldn't help but laugh, \"Are you my agent? When I said I didn't want to do period dramas anymore, my social media was also blown up like this.\"\"Well, it's the same for anyone like you! As an ordinary viewer, I love seeing handsome guys in period dramas. Those people can't accept that, and now that period drama hunks like you are rare, they can't handle it. After you came into the scene, all the popularity flowed to you. You've only done three dramas, and some people are already pushing you out of your comfort zone. But honestly, who needs to move from their comfort zone if it's a brick that suits you?\" Zheng Baozhu said, feeling indignant on his behalf.\"Actors wanting to avoid repeating themselves is normal, but the three period dramas you've done are completely different. One was a prince, another a deity, and the other a martial hero. Moreover, you hardly need a double. How is that comfortable for you?\" Zheng Baozhu thought about how tiring it was for herself, who had only done a few fight scenes. Lin Ziqin, as the male lead, had fight scenes throughout the entire show, \"Oh, and when you step out of your comfort zone, won't they want you to spin in circles in a period drama?\"Lin Ziqin laughed and handed her a bottle of water. He said while looking at her, \"You've said so much; aren't you thirsty? Have some water.\"\"Thank you,\" Zheng Baozhu took the water. It had been placed near the heater and was still warm.Lin Ziqin said, \"I didn't say I won't act in period dramas anymore; I'm just considering doing something different next time.\"Zheng Baozhu asked, \"Do you have any ideas in mind?\" With Lin Ziqin's current popularity, it was likely that he already had offers for his next project even before finishing the current one. Judging by his expression, it seemed that some production companies had approached him.Lin Ziqin didn't intentionally hide anything and nodded, telling Zheng Baozhu, \"I have received several scripts, most of them are period dramas, and there are also some big IPs among them. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. A few days ago, Boyun also approached me, saying he wants me to play the male lead in his next project.\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback by the sudden revelation and almost choked on her water. She noticed that recently, whenever she drank water while sitting across from him, he would drop surprising news. Seeing her surprised expression, Lin Ziqin asked, \"What's wrong?\"Zheng Baozhu waved her hand, indicating that she was fine, \"Is Director Gao preparing for several new projects?\"Lin Ziqin smiled and said, \"Probably only one. Did he tell you about it too?\"\"Just mentioned once,\" Zheng Baozhu recalled how Gao Boyun had used the prospect of her being the lead in his next project to convince her mom when he visited their home, \"But I don't know if he meant it or not.\"If he really wanted Lin Ziqin to be the male lead in his next project, that would mean they could co-star together. This possibility seemed too good to be true.\"I'll ask him later then,\" Zheng Baozhu turned to the next page of the script, \"By the way, there's a cousin of mine who really likes you. She asked me to get your autographed photo. Would you mind?\"Lin Ziqin agreed readily, \"Sure, my assistant should have my photos. I'll have them find one for you.\"Zheng Baozhu felt a bit embarrassed and hesitated, \"Actually, quite a few kids in her class like you. She asked for ten autographed photos...\"She realized that this request might be too much and quickly added, \"But it's okay, ten is a lot to ask from you. One or two would be enough. Thank you, Teacher Lin!\"Instead of refusing, Lin Ziqin thought for a moment and said, \"Ten is not a problem. It's just that my assistant might not have that many. I'll go back and check. Next time, I'll bring them to you, or you can just give me an address, and I'll send them to you.\"\"Is that okay? Thank you for helping me send them. I can pay for the postage,\" Zheng Baozhu thought Lin Ziqin was quite considerate, which was probably why the kids liked him so much, \"Should I give you my address?\"Lin Ziqin replied, \"Just send it to me on your phone,\" After a moment's pause, he looked at her and asked, \"We haven't added each other as friends yet, right?\"\"That's right!\" Zheng Baozhu had been hesitant to ask him to add her, afraid that he might think she wanted something from him as a minor supporting role.Lin Ziqin took out his phone and opened WeChat, \"Scan mine, and I'll let you know when I have the signed photos ready.\"\"Alright, thank you, Teacher Lin.\" Zheng Baozhu excitedly scanned Lin Ziqin's QR code and successfully added him as a friend. Later that night, back at the hotel, she soaked her feet and showed off in her small group chat, \"Guys, I've added Lin Ziqin on WeChat, hahaha!\"Meng Yaxin: !!Zheng Baozhu: From now on, my circle of friends has gained one more handsome guy.Cen Tongtong: Don't make it sound like you're visiting the harem of a palace after watching a show. [Picking nose emoji]Zheng Baozhu: Well, it does feel like that.After soaking her feet, Zheng Baozhu laid on her bed and scrolled through her moments' posts, and there it was\u2014a handsome selfie.The handsome guy was Qu Zhi.\"...\"Zheng Baozhu was silent for a moment, then opened a private chat with Qu Zhi, \"Dr. Qu is going to impoverished areas again?\"Qu Zhi: Yes.Zheng Baozhu: ...Alright.Qu Zhi: When will you be back?Zheng Baozhu: I'll be back tomorrow after finishing filming.Qu Zhi: Okay.Zheng Baozhu was about to reply when her phone vibrated. Thinking it was Qu Zhi calling, she was surprised to see her mom's name displayed on the screen.Her hand trembled as she answered the call, \"Hello, Mom? Is there something you need so late?\"Su Mingxi's voice came from the other end, \"Where are you?\"\"I... I'm in my room,\" Zheng Baozhu was afraid of further questioning and asked again, \"What's the matter?\"Su Mingxi said, \"Your grandmother, after resting at home for a few days, couldn't stay idle. She insisted on going out today to buy groceries herself.\"\"What? Isn't she supposed to be resting?\"\"She didn't listen and went out on a chair. But that's not all, after going out, guess what she did?\"Zheng Baozhu couldn't even guess, \"What did she do?\"\"She started writing letters to government departments! She said the accessibility facilities here are poorly done. She tried sitting in a wheelchair, but it's inconvenient everywhere!\" Su Mingxi said with exasperation.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Her grandmother truly lived up to expectations. This turn of events was unexpected.\"She didn't buy many groceries and came back to the community first. She complained that many roads only have stairs and didn't consider people using wheelchairs. Tomorrow she plans to go to government departments to complain about the inconvenience of getting on and off buses. I can't stop her. Since you are so eloquent, why don't you accompany her tomorrow?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"\"Uh, well, Mom, Grandma is indeed well-intentioned, and she's not wrong about this... but I have work tomorrow, and I can't get away. How about you ask my cousin and others?\"\"But they all have work, right? You're the most flexible with your time,\" Su Mingxi replied.\"Um... then, can you ask Grandma to wait one more day? I'll be free the day after tomorrow.\"\"Okay, I'll talk to her again,\" Su Mingxi hung up the phone. Zheng Baozhu returned to her conversation with Qu Zhi and absentmindedly sent him a sweating emoji.Qu Zhi: What happened?Zheng Baozhu: My grandmother went out to buy groceries in the wheelchair today. She made an important speech about the accessibility facilities in our city and is already writing letters to the mayor's office. [Sweating emoji]Qu Zhi chuckled and replied, \"That's very much like something your grandmother would do. Our accessibility construction does indeed have many areas that need improvement. If everyone were as enthusiastic as your grandmother, it would definitely accelerate the process of accessibility construction.\"Zheng Baozhu: She's indeed enthusiastic. Tomorrow, she also plans to criticize the work of a public company. [Sweating emoji]Zheng Baozhu: My mom asked me to accompany her, but I have to film tomorrow.After considering it for a moment, Qu Zhi typed in the chat box, \"How about I accompany your grandmother?\"Zheng Baozhu: Huh? Weren't you going to work tomorrow?Qu Zhi: I can take half a day off; I still have unused vacation days.Zheng Baozhu: Okay, but won't that be too much trouble for you?Qu Zhi: It's fine, just let your grandmother know. I'll go see her tomorrow morning.Zheng Baozhu replied with a \"good\" and then called Su Mingxi, \"Mom, Qu Zhi said he can accompany Grandma tomorrow.\"\"Huh?\" Su Mingxi was taken aback and her tone became strange, \"You've been bothering Qu Zhi with our family matters. It seems like you don't treat him as an outsider at all?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu fell silent for a moment, feeling that there was an underlying meaning in her words, \"Isn't it you who doesn't treat him as an outsider?\"\"Well, that's true, but you didn't have this attitude before. It seems like you have a very good relationship with him now.\"\"Mom, don't bring up these irrelevant things,\" Zheng Baozhu quickly changed the topic, \"Qu Zhi has been giving lectures on blind alley construction before, which is also part of accessibility facilities. He has experience in this area, and I'm sure he and Grandma will get along well.\"\"Fine... but since you're bothering him, remember to treat him to a meal afterward as a thank you.\"\"I know, I'll hang up now,\" Zheng Baozhu quickly hung up the phone, not sure why she felt guilty about it.Early the next morning, Qu Zhi went to Grandma Su's house as arranged. Grandma Su was now very skilled with the wheelchair, and when she saw him, she even asked for his help in revising the letter she had written yesterday.\"When I wasn't using the wheelchair, I truly didn't realize these things. It was only when I went out yesterday that I discovered how inconvenient it is,\" While Qu Zhi helped read the letter, Grandma Su complained to him, \"You see, I only sat on the wheelchair for a short time, and I already found it so inconvenient. How do those disabled people manage? We can't ignore this matter.\"\"Grandma, don't worry. You are right, and your letter is written truthfully; there's no need to make any changes,\" Qu Zhi turned his head to comfort Grandma Su, \"Moreover, the country hasn't said it will ignore this issue. It's just that the construction of accessibility facilities requires a significant amount of manpower, financial resources, and time. We need to take it one step at a time. Some places indeed don't pay enough attention to these matters, but with people like you continuously providing feedback, we can gradually improve. In fact, many social figures are now concerned about this issue, and there will be a charity event about it next week.\"\"Really?\"\"Yes,\" Qu Zhi nodded. The charity event originally invited Professor Luo to attend, but he didn't like to attend such occasions and didn't want to miss this opportunity for popularizing knowledge. Thus, he asked Qu Zhi to go in his place.After she was done filmings, Zheng Baozhu headed straight back to Starlight Farm. On the way, she started messaging Qu Zhi, \"Did everything go smoothly today with my grandmother?\"Qu Zhi: Yes, it went smoothly. The public company took the feedback seriously and said they would carry out improvements soon.Zheng Baozhu: Wow! You guys are amazing!Qu Zhi: It's not that we're amazing; the public company has become more conscious.Zheng Baozhu: Haha, well, I was involved in charity work before. A few days ago, the person in charge of a project sent me an invitation to attend a charity event!Zheng Baozhu: I looked it up and found out it's also about accessibility facilities construction. How coincidental, isn't it?Qu Zhi's eyebrows gently raised. It was indeed quite coincidental. He didn't tell Zheng Baozhu that he would also be attending and asked instead, \"Have you returned?\"Zheng Baozhu: I'm on my way back.Qu Zhi: Give me a call when you arrive, I'll come to pick you up.Zheng Baozhu typed \"No need\" in the chat box but hesitated. She deleted those words and typed something else instead.Sure. (>\u25bd<)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng\u00a0Baozhu's car drove back to the Starlight Farm at night. Through the window, she could see Qu Zhi standing at the hotel entrance. He was wearing a long gray coat with a plaid scarf wrapped around his neck. Despite the temperature being just a few degrees outside, he stood there looking poised. If she hadn't seen the white breath he exhaled, Zheng Baozhu would have thought he wasn't feeling cold at all.The car's headlights illuminated him, causing Qu Zhi to look over in response. Once the car steadied, Zheng Baozhu immediately opened the car door and rushed down. Qu Zhi saw her coming down and handed her the paper bag he was holding, saying, \"Hold this, I'll help you with the luggage.\"Zheng Baozhu had noticed something in his hands, but now, as she received it, she found it was actually warm. She opened the paper bag and glanced inside, finding roasted sweet potatoes: \"Wow, roasted sweet potatoes? Where did you buy them?\"Qu Zhi took out her suitcase from the trunk and closed it: \"I roasted them myself. A while ago, Meng Yaxin dug a lot of sweet potatoes at the farm and gave me some.\"\"Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu didn't rush to eat, instead using the roasted sweet potatoes to warm her hands, \"What did you use to roast them?\"\"I bought an air fryer,\" the car that brought Zheng Baozhu back drove away into the night. Qu Zhi dragged the luggage and walked with Zheng Baozhu toward the hotel, \"I used to order takeout when I worked overtime, so I just bought an air fryer. It's convenient for making snacks.\"\"You're living well,\" Zheng Baozhu held the roasted sweet potatoes, looking at Qu Zhi walking beside her, \"Are you feeling cold? Do you want to borrow them to warm your hands?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"No need. I prepared them for you.\"\"Why did you wait outside? You could have waited for me in the hotel lobby; it's warmer in there.\"The hotel lobby had heating and sofas, which was much more comfortable than standing outside in the cold.Qu Zhi paused for a moment and said, \"Waiting outside allows me to see you earlier.\"Zheng Baozhu's heart skipped a beat at his words. Qu Zhi was a science guy, but he spoke in such an unassuming way. Was this the strength of someone who always got an A in essay writing since childhood? It was terrifying.Her face felt a bit warm, so she used the roasted sweet potatoes in her hand to cover her face and vaguely said, \"When I saw you in the car, I did feel relieved.\"Qu Zhi's paused again for a moment, then he awkwardly replied, \"Uh-huh.\"Zheng Baozhu followed him into the elevator. Xiao Yu immediately posted the photo of the two of them side by side, entering the hotel, in the group chat, and started shouting, \"Miss Baozhu is back! Mr. Qu has been waiting outside in the freezing cold for her to return! The temperature is already below zero, if this isn't considered dedication, then what is!\"Xiao Yu: He even prepared roasted sweet potatoes for Miss Baozhu, sob sob! I'm going to eat some in celebration!Liang Huihui: Wow! Xiao Yu, your photography skills are amazing! This photo looks so professional!Xiao Yu: It's not my skill, they just look great together! What you see is what you get, I didn't even use any filters!Wei Zhen: I added one [picture]Meng Yaxin: !! I would believe this is a movie poster!Meng Yaxin: Let me add a few words!Meng Yaxin edited the photo with the words [Winter Song] and sent it back to the group chat.Liang Huihui: I've already set it as my phone wallpaper [picture] Thank you, everyone!Cen Tongtong: ????Meng Yaxin: CP is going strong, Tongtong's keyboards are going to be discounted again.But the two people at the center of the topic were not concerned about Cen Tongtong's discounted keyboards. Qu Zhi brought Zheng Baozhu's luggage into the room and it seemed like he had no intention of leaving immediately. Zheng Baozhu didn't rush to pack her luggage either. She poured a cup of hot water for Qu Zhi and divided the roasted sweet potato in her hand into two halves, \"Do you want some? It's still hot.\"\"Sure,\" Qu Zhi accepted his share of roasted sweet potato that Zheng Baozhu handed to him. Zheng Baozhu took a bite of the sticky sweet potato and immediately sighed with happiness, \"So sweet, it's so delicious!\"Qu Zhi also took a bite and nodded, \"I still have some left. If you like it, you can have it all.\"\"No need, no need. You keep it for yourself. Meng Yaxin also gave me some, but I haven't had the chance to eat it yet since I went to the set,\" Zheng Baozhu said and took another big bite of the roasted sweet potato, \"Mmm, it's really sweet. I'll roast some for myself tomorrow.\"\"Oh, by the way, you mentioned the charity event earlier...\" Qu Zhi peeled the sweet potato in his hand and casually asked, \"Which dress do you think looks better?\"\"Huh?\" Zheng Baozhu looked up in confusion. Then focused on her own thoughts, walked to the closet, and rummaged around for a while before coming out with a golden fishtail dress, \"What do you think of this dress? It's my favorite and perfect for such an important occasion!\"The dress in Zheng Baozhu's hand was shining and eye-catching, clearly in her preferred style. In the past, Qu Zhi might have considered it too flamboyant, but now he imagined Zheng Baozhu wearing it and thought it looked good, \"It's beautiful.\"\"Right? I've already planned the accessories too. Just wait a moment,\" Zheng Baozhu put down the dress and took out her jewelry box, then opened it in Qu Zhi's direction, \"Ta-da! A golden necklace and earrings, don't they match perfectly! I had this jewelry set customized, the patterns and style are a bit retro, and it looks luxurious without being tacky!\"\"...Hmm, it does look luxurious,\" this kind of extravagant outfit, except for Zheng Baozhu, Qu Zhi couldn't imagine anyone else wearing it.\"It's been a while since I attended such an event, just thinking about it gets me excited!\"\"Well... but won't it be too grand?\" This attire seemed more suited for walking a red carpet.\"No, I bought it specifically for occasions like this. But I gained two pounds recently, I hope I can still fit into it.\"Seeing Zheng Baozhu holding up the dress and acting like she wanted to try it on right there, Qu Zhi quickly stood up from the sofa and said, \"Then I won't disturb you with the fitting. I'll leave first.\"\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu looked at his hurried departure and wanted to make a sarcastic remark but then remembered the scene of her showing off earlier.Hmm... his reaction seems pretty normal.Zheng Baozhu didn't pay him any more attention and went to try on the dress. Fortunately, it still fits well. After putting on the jewelry, she looked at herself in the mirror. What hairstyle should she go for that day? Retro big waves? Sounds good.Zheng Baozhu had made an appointment with the stylist in advance, and besides preparing for the charity event, she also discussed the studio's affairs with Zhou Xiaonan. The establishment of the studio seemed complex on the surface, but once the funds were in place, everything was processed quickly. After making arrangements, she signed the contract with Zhou Xiaonan as her manager, who then began to recruit staff for the studio.They needed assistants, PR staff, business management, makeup artists, and post-production staff. Currently, Zheng Baozhu didn't have any jobs on hand. :)Since the charity event was not a showbiz event, Zheng Baozhu didn't bring an assistant or manager. Nevertheless, she still dressed like a star and immediately attracted a lot of attention when she arrived.The recent makeup photos had caused some attention on the internet, but tonight, most of the attendees were from the older generation or not interested in showbiz, so they were unaware of this matter. There were a few familiar entrepreneurs present, people Zheng Baozhu had previously dealt with in the business world.Tonight, Zheng Baozhu had a retro-style big wavy hairstyle that perfectly matched her attire. Upon discovering Zheng Baozhu, the paparazzi started taking photos, and those who recognized her as the actress playing the new version of Ye Ling were even more enthusiastic about taking pictures.Later, the organizers requested them to take more photos of the event itself since they invited them not just to capture the stars.Zheng Baozhu was chatting with the other businessmen at the event. When she heard that some experts and professors would be attending tonight, she became curious about who they were. After a while, the specially invited experts and professors arrived, and everyone was eager to see who they were.Qu Zhi was dressed in a champagne gold suit, paired with a deep-colored tie, and he walked over with the guidance of the organizers. Zheng Baozhu was holding a glass of champagne and was stunned when she saw him.Tonight, Qu Zhi looked very handsome. Even his hair was done stylishly for the occasion. However, what shocked Zheng Baozhu was not his appearance; after all, he had been handsome since he was young. The surprise came from the fact that Qu Zhi was wearing a gold suit!!!This was more shocking than a stray cat in their neighborhood that had been spayed suddenly becoming pregnant again!Gold often gave people a feeling of flamboyance and extravagance, which was the complete opposite of Qu Zhi's steady and reserved personality. Moreover, he had never been interested in this kind of jewelry-like dressing, so how could he buy a gold suit for himself?!Zheng Baozhu suddenly felt that people were really complex creatures. :)However, she had to admit that he looked great in the champagne gold suit. Gold was quite picky, and if the person wearing it lacked a certain temperament, they would come off as nouveau riche. Zheng Baozhu, with her exceptional temperament, had been able to handle such flamboyant dressing since she was young. So even when she wore gold tonight, nobody found it tacky. On the other hand, Qu Zhi's temperament was much cooler, and normally, dressing in gold would clash with his aura. However, he combined the flamboyance of gold with a dark-colored shirt and tie, making the whole outfit look just right.As Qu Zhi appeared, his outstanding appearance and temperament caused a stir at the event. Originally, they thought this event was mainly for business people and expected to see various bald or greasy-looking, beer-bellied bosses. They didn't expect to encounter a beautiful star and a handsome expert.Putting these two on the cover today, who would worry about not getting enough attention?\"Let me introduce you all. This is Professor Qu, who we invited today,\" the organizer walked over to Zheng Baozhu's group and stopped to greet them. The boss next to Zheng Baozhu looked at Qu Zhi, nodded, and asked the organizer, \"I remember we were in touch with Professor Luo before, right?\"The head of the organizing committee smiled and said, \"Professor Luo isn't comfortable with this kind of occasion, so he sent his capable assistant instead. Don't be fooled by Qu Zhi's young appearance; his resume is quite impressive. Professor Luo speaks highly of him.\"\"You're too kind,\" Qu Zhi humbly replied.The boss who asked the question earlier chuckled and noticed something else, \"Is gold in fashion this year? Professor Qu and our Miss Zheng here match very well.\"After he mentioned it, others also noticed it, and someone jokingly said they were dressing in pairs.\"Don't make our Miss Zheng embarrassed.\"\"No need to worry about that,\" Zheng Baozhu held her champagne glass and smiled, \"I'm just afraid that Professor Qu is too thin-skinned.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi glanced at her and didn't say anything. Instead, he turned his head to the organizers and said, \"Let's get started then.\"\"Great, Professor Qu, come up from this side of the stage,\" the organizers led Qu Zhi to the side of the stage, where he would later need to give a brief speech. After the formal opening of the event, several leaders took the stage and thanked the enthusiastic attendees. Polite applause followed. When Qu Zhi went up on stage, the applause noticeably grew louder.Zheng Baozhu paid special attention. Tonight, apart from the bosses, it seemed that Qu Zhi was the one to look for, just as Qi Sheng had predicted.\"First of all, thank you all for attending tonight's banquet and for your continuous support for public welfare. Recently, a relative of mine had an injury and had to use a wheelchair. Going out to buy groceries, she found it very inconvenient. Many roads have stairs but no ramps, the bus's accessibility ramp doesn't connect with the platform, and there's even a lack of safety airbags. During my time abroad, I often saw people in wheelchairs on public transport, but in our country, due to insufficient accessibility facilities, it's challenging to see disabled individuals going out.Accessibility facilities are not irrelevant to ordinary people; anyone can get injured, and even mothers pushing strollers on the street need these facilities. Just like this relative of mine and all of you, they are all warm-hearted individuals. On that day, this relative wrote a letter to the municipal government and gave suggestions to the public transport company, and they received positive feedback. The use of these facilities is not the reason for us not to implement accessibility construction. The rights of disabled individuals should also be protected...\"Qu Zhi spoke eloquently on stage for about ten minutes. Perhaps, being good-looking made his speech more captivating, and everyone listened more attentively compared to before. When he finished, the applause was warm and enthusiastic. Zheng Baozhu felt regret that Qu Zhi didn't take the opportunity to promote his own laboratory's products.After Qu Zhi finished speaking, he was seated at the same table as Zheng Baozhu for dinner as arranged by the organizers. Everyone at the table showed strong interest in him. Zheng Baozhu noticed that it wasn't just the businessmen who were interested in Qu Zhi; even the married male entrepreneurs seemed to find him fascinating...After the banquet, the organizers offered to send Qu Zhi back, but he politely declined, \"I can go back on my own; there's no need to trouble you.\"\"Ah? That wouldn't be appropriate. Let us send you with our car,\" the organizers were in a dilemma.Qu Zhi politely refused, \"Really, no need. I can handle it on my own.\"\"...\"It's hard to say, considering the way everyone has been looking at you tonight, like wolves and tigers.Qu Zhi bid farewell and walked straight toward the exit. Once he stepped out of the venue, he saw Zheng Baozhu's eye-catching red sedan parked at the entrance.He walked over, and Zheng Baozhu, sitting in the back seat, opened the door and looked at him with a smile, \"Isn't this Professor Qu? All alone? How about I give you a ride?\"Qu Zhi gazed at her with a slight curve of his lips, opened the door, and got in.The event organizer who followed Qu Zhi out anxiously saw him getting into Zheng Baozhu's car and suddenly everything made sense.So, they deliberately dressed up like a couple tonight?In Zheng Baozhu's car, Qu Zhi loosened his tie to take a breather. Zheng Baozhu had been drinking tonight, so she had a designated driver. She sat next to Qu Zhi, looking at him, \"Professor Qu did well tonight and raised a good amount of money.\"\"Yeah...\" Qu Zhi leaned back against the seat. He gently closed his eyes, looking a bit tired. He had spent the whole day in the laboratory and rushed over for the evening banquet. Finally, he could take a short break.Seeing him closing his eyes to rest, Zheng Baozhu asked the driver to play a soothing piece of music, \"I heard that the funds raised tonight are mainly for renovating old buildings, adding elevators and ramps.\"\"Um... I hope it can help some people.\"\"By the way, I have a question to ask you. That relative you mentioned, could it be my grandmother?\" Zheng Baozhu spoke, \"When did she become your relative?\"Qu Zhi finally opened his eyes, leaning his head against the seatback, and looked at her. Perhaps because he was genuinely tired, his eyes seemed moist, which was quite different from his usual reserved and distant demeanor. He appeared unexpectedly tender.Zheng Baozhu's heart pounded again under his gaze, and she cleared her throat, turning her head to look at the night scenery outside the window, \"I was just joking. If you're tired, you can rest for a while. I'll take you home.\"\"Okay,\" Qu Zhi responded and closed his eyes again. Zheng Baozhu breathed a sigh of relief.There was no further conversation on the way. The driver was skillful and the car was driven smoothly. Qu Zhi fell asleep in the car. Seeing that he was deeply asleep, Zheng Baozhu specifically instructed the driver to park the car in the garage before stopping.Qu Zhi hadn't woken up yet, so after the driver left, Zheng Baozhu undid her seatbelt and looked at the person sitting next to her.\"Qu Zhi?\" she called softly, but he didn't react. Zheng Baozhu propped her head with one hand, gazing at him from the side. She couldn't deny that Qu Zhi's side profile was indeed handsome, with smooth and beautiful curves.He was sleeping without any defense as if he didn't worry about others doing anything to him.As Zheng Baozhu watched, she felt her gaze changing somehow. Even though she had drunk a bit tonight, she was still completely sober now. But memories of that day when Qu Zhi had just finished taking a shower came to her mind....Help! Could it be that she really has some inappropriate feelings for Qu Zhi?!She had known Qu Zhi for so many years, and she had never had any special feelings towards him. Why now, all of a sudden, was she feeling so vulnerable?But it was true that Qu Zhi seemed even more attractive now than during their school days. The kind of exclusive charm that came with being a man made it difficult to resist.Leaning slightly closer to Qu Zhi, she caught a faint whiff of his men's cologne, which smelled nice. Zheng Baozhu sniffed lightly and moved closer to him. His lips were lightly pursed, showing a hint of rosy red, a sight that aroused her imagination. Zheng Baozhu lowered her head slightly, getting very close to him. If she moved a bit closer, she could kiss him.Qu Zhi's eyelashes flickered and he suddenly opened his eyes without warning. Seeing Zheng Baozhu's face so close, he was momentarily stunned.Zheng Baozhu was now bewildered. She hadn't planned to do anything, she just wanted to take a closer look at the handsome face, but unexpectedly, the handsome guy suddenly opened his eyes. At this moment, she felt like she was in deep trouble, and it was difficult to explain the situation clearly.Both of them froze for a moment, maintaining that awkward position without moving. Qu Zhi cleared his throat and spoke with a hint of hoarseness, \"You got so close to me. Were you planning to kiss me?\"\"I-I'm not, I'm not!\" Zheng Baozhu quickly moved away from him, denying vigorously, \"I was just... just checking to see if you were still asleep!\"\"Is that so?\" Qu Zhi sat up, adjusted his tie again, and glanced at Zheng Baozhu beside him, \"Why did I feel like there was something unusual in the way you were looking at me just now?\"\"...You're overthinking it!\" Zheng Baozhu opened the car door and hurriedly got out, \"We've arrived. You should go back to your room and sleep!\"She said and fled in panic, her heart beating rapidly.If Qu Zhi hadn't woken up just now, would she have kissed him? Ah, no, she couldn't believe she actually had such thoughts about Qu Zhi!Taking out her phone, she sent a message to her experienced friend, Meng Yaxin: \"What should I do if I crave a man???\"Meng Yaxin: What else can you do? If you can sleep with him, then try to do so. If not, find a way to create opportunities.Zheng Baozhu: ...Is this what it's like to be in the new year? The way of speaking is completely different.Meng Yaxin: So who are you craving for? Qu Zhi?Zheng Baozhu: I'm not!Meng Yaxin: Don't be hypocritical. Honestly face your desires. There's nothing to be ashamed of.Zheng Baozhu:Meng Yaxin: I bet Qu Zhi also craves you. You don't need to think too much, just go and kiss him directly. He definitely won't be able to resist and will take the initiative.Zheng Baozhu locked her phone screen and put it aside. According to Meng Yaxin's advice, if she had just kissed Qu Zhi in the car, would he have taken the initiative in the car? Did that mean they would have...?This was way too stimulating. :)While she was thinking about some indescribable things, someone knocked on her door. Qu Zhi's voice came from outside, \"Zheng Baozhu.\"Zheng Baozhu trembled all over, \"What's the matter?\"Qu Zhi outside said, \"You forgot your car keys. You'll be searching everywhere for them later.\"\"Oh, oh, oh,\" Zheng Baozhu repeated several \"ohs,\" but she didn't dare to open the door for Qu Zhi, \"Um, just leave them by the door for me. I'm changing!\"\"...\" There was silence outside for a while before Qu Zhi's voice came again, \"Alright, I'll leave them on the floor. Don't forget to take them.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu responded and then pressed her ear against the door, listening to the sounds outside. Qu Zhi's footsteps gradually moved away, then the sound of the door opening and closing. Zheng Baozhu waited for a moment before quietly opening the door and picking up the keys from the floor. Then she quickly closed the door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Was it that evening when she saw him alone on the blind path, moving the shared bicycle in the cold wind? Or was it when she saw his lecture in elementary school? Whenever Qu Zhi talked about his expertise and ideals, he always had a captivating charm. Just like tonight when he spoke at the charity event, he seemed so charismatic.\"...\"The more she thought about it, the more Zheng Baozhu felt that something was off with herself.She covered her head with a blanket and closed her eyes, hoping that she wouldn't have any strange dreams tonight.The next morning, when she woke up, half of Zheng Baozhu's face was still buried in the blanket. She glanced outside, picked up her phone from the bedside table, and checked the time.It was already past 8 o'clock. It seemed that despite pondering too much before going to sleep, it didn't affect her ability to sleep. She hadn't dreamed anything strange last night, just dreaming about her high school days with Qu Zhi. Brushing aside her hair with one hand, she opened Weibo and checked the trending topics.Today, there were no scandals, no one going to jail, and no major controversies. The trending topics seemed rather unremarkable. The only thing that caught Zheng Baozhu's attention was the charity event they attended yesterday, which surprisingly made it to the trending list. Compared to the star-studded charity events, this one was quite low-profile, with only about 30+ positions on the trending list. Just as she was about to click on it, she noticed another trending topic right below it, titled [Zheng Baozhu].Zheng Baozhu was taken aback and quickly clicked on it. It turned out to be a post about her attending the charity event yesterday, accompanied by high-resolution pictures. While the pictures might not have been as photoshopped as those of the celebrities, Zheng Baozhu relied on her natural beauty to stand out.Though the trending topic wasn't ranked high, some netizens still noticed it and began commenting on the photos, lavishing her with praise and compliments. However, there were also some who made snide remarks, saying that she was trying to show off even before becoming famous.\"...\"She thought to herself, if she were going to show off, she should at least aim for the top spot on the trending list. What was the point of staying in the 30+ range?Fortunately, some keen-eyed netizens came to her defense.\u300cMy mom also attended this charity event. She said, only those who have been doing charity work and donating a significant amount of money were invited [doge].\u300dThis comment quickly received numerous likes and pushed her trending topic to the top. Zheng Baozhu decided not to join in the self-promotion, so she exited the trending topic.She then scrolled through the trending list and saw [Qu Zhi] listed a few positions below.Zheng Baozhu: \"!\"This trending topic was undoubtedly related to last night's event; Professor Qu managed to ride the coattails of the trending topics with his remarkable looks. Zheng Baozhu took a screenshot of the trending list and sent it to Qu Zhi.Zheng Baozhu: After so many years, I finally got a trending topic ahead of you! [Picture]Qu Zhi opened the picture she sent and replied with a single word: \u2026Impressive.Zheng Baozhu:Zheng Baozhu: Just say it, did you intentionally match outfits with me last night? Even the netizens noticed it!Qu Zhi: ...Coincidence.Zheng Baozhu: Pfft, you clearly knew I was going to wear gold!Qu Zhi: ...I'm at work, let's talk at lunch.Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow, feeling speechless. Did he just work-dodge her?Putting her phone down, Zheng Baozhu got up from the bed. During this period, she had been busy preparing for her personal studio with Zhou Xiaonan. After a few rounds of selection, they had finally identified a location for the studio, and they planned to visit the site that afternoon. The studio was located in a quiet and serene park within the city, an oasis of tranquility amidst the bustling city.There were already several studios in the park; the one they were going to see today was a relocated studio. The developer had recently rented out the building after the previous occupant moved out. The three-story building had a unique artistic style and the previous owner had left some small decorations behind.\"I think this interior design is quite good. With a few adjustments, it will be perfect. This way, we can save time. What do you think?\" After taking a tour of the place with Zhou Xiaonan, Zheng Baozhu discussed their ideas.\"I agree. After all, we'll need a place for our employees to work once they join us,\" Zhou Xiaonan said, and then she casually asked, \"I saw the trending topic about you yesterday, the charity event?\"\"Yes, I received an invitation from the organizers, so I attended,\" Zheng Baozhu replied with a smile, \"I didn't expect it to trend.\"\"...Right, that's good,\" Zhou Xiaonan wanted to say that many celebrities envy not being able to trend, but she stopped herself, \"I saw your photos online, they were beautiful. Did you do the makeup yourself?\"\"Yes, I used to attend similar events frequently, so I know some professional makeup artists.\"Nodding, Zhou Xiaonan thought for a while and began arranging work for Zheng Baozhu: \"I noticed that your photos received a good response online. How about next month, we take advantage of the spring season and shoot a large-scale spring-themed photoshoot?\"\"A spring-themed photoshoot?\"\"Yes,\" Zhou Xiaonan nodded, \"Your drama won't be airing for a while, so during this time, we should do something else to maintain your presence. Most of the attention you've received so far is due to your appearance. I think a photoshoot will not only solidify your presence but also potentially attract more attention.\"\"That sounds good. I don't have any other projects at the moment anyway,\" Zheng Baozhu agreed, thinking it was a great idea, and she liked taking photos too.\"Then I'll start making arrangements.\"\"Okay.\"Although Zhou Xiaonan had left Starlight Entertainment, she still had some connections, and she quickly contacted a professional team for Zheng Baozhu. Despite the early spring temperatures not being too high, the flowers in Starlight Park and Lizhe Park had started to bloom. The photography team selected several beautiful locations and chose a perfect day to take photos of Zheng Baozhu.Zheng Baozhu wore a beautiful spring dress from Senrui's runway collection. It was the same dress she had liked when she went to see the show with Meng Yaxin. The design was ethereal, with shimmering silver flowers embroidered on the skirt, perfectly matching her taste. The lightweight veil cascaded down to her ankles, making her figure even more elegant.Paired with a pearl necklace and her retro curls, Zheng Baozhu's appearance stunned Zhou Xiaonan, \"Has anyone ever told you that you look a lot like Su Mingmei???\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and nodded, \"I've heard people say that quite often.\"She hadn't told Zhou Xiaonan about her relationship with Su Mingmei, so Zhou Xiaonan's astonishment was understandable.Even the makeup artist couldn't help but admire while styling her hair, \"You're really beautiful, and your skin is exceptional!\"\"Thank you!\" Zheng Baozhu graciously accepted the compliment.Although it was sunny today, the temperature was still low. Zheng Baozhu wore a coat over her outfit and only removed it during the photoshoot. Her presence attracted strong attention from the surrounding tourists and many people stopped to watch.At first, they thought it was a wedding photoshoot, but then they noticed there was no groom and assumed it was an artistic portrait session.For the time being, no one recognized her as an obscure minor celebrity.Zhou Xiaonan realized that it was actually a good thing that no one recognized her at this point. Once she became famous, things might get uncontrollable.The photoshoot proceeded smoothly, and after it ended, Zheng Baozhu had initially wanted to invite Zhou Xiaonan for hotpot to warm up, but Zhou Xiaonan frowned and said, \"You're still going to eat hotpot? Haven't I told you that stars need to watch their diet? How much do you weigh now?\"\"...\"If she didn't want to eat, she didn't have to. Why suddenly ask about her weight?Zheng Baozhu smiled and said, \"I suddenly lost my appetite. I'll just cook some broccoli when I get back. You can go off work first. Goodbye!\"Without removing her makeup or changing her clothes, she asked the driver to take her back to the hotel. The sky was already getting dark at this time, Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment before sending a message to Qu Zhi: \"Are you done with work? I'll treat you to dinner tonight.\"Qu Zhi was just about to order some takeout and work for a little longer into the night when he received Zheng Baozhu's message. He paused for a moment before replying: \"Just finished work. Why do you suddenly want to treat me to dinner? Did you earn money again?\"Zheng Baozhu: No! Last time you accompanied my grandmother, so my mom wanted me to treat you to dinner on her behalf!Qu Zhi: ...Oh, alright. What are we having?Zheng Baozhu: Hotpot! I'll come to your workplace to pick you up.Qu Zhi: Sounds good.As Qu Zhi was changing his clothes in the dressing room, Qi Sheng saw him and looked somewhat surprised, \"Why are you here? Weren't you supposed to work a little longer tonight?\"Qu Zhi took off his white coat and hung it in the locker. He then took out his coat and replied, \"It's the same if I work longer tomorrow.\"Qi Sheng looked at him suspiciously, \"What's going on, Old Qu? Do you have a date with a beauty?\"Qu Zhi glanced at him but didn't deny it, \"Zheng Baozhu invited me out for hotpot.\"\"What?\" Qi Sheng immediately perked up, \"Old Qu, tell me the truth, how far have you two progressed? Have you kissed yet?\"Qu Zhi looked at him and furrowed his brows slightly, \"Is your mind filled with nothing but such vulgar thoughts?\"\"Vulgar?\" Qi Sheng hummed and looked at him, \"Tell me honestly, do you or do you not want to do these 'vulgar' things?\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"He closed the locker door and walked away. Qi Sheng closed his locker too and followed him outside, \"Where are you guys having hotpot? Can you bring me along?\"Qu Zhi casually replied, \"If you pay for a separate table, I might consider taking you with us.\"Qi Sheng: \"...\"Ha, you said you didn't have any vulgar thoughts? Right now, you can't even tolerate having a third wheel around!\"If you don't want to bring me, then don't. Who cares,\" Qi Sheng huffed a couple of times. When he saw Qu Zhi standing at the company entrance not leaving, he stopped and asked, \"Why are you standing here?\"Qu Zhi said, \"Zheng Baozhu is coming to pick me up.\"Qi Sheng: \"...\"He had never seen someone so happy about having a meal. :)\"Old Qu, you've fallen,\" Qi Sheng said with a heavy heart, \"You weren't like this before. Now you know the joy of eating.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"The two of them chatted at the company entrance for a while until Zheng Baozhu's car arrived. Qu Zhi walked up, opened the passenger door, and sat inside. Zheng Baozhu rolled down the window and looked at Qi Sheng outside, \"Qi Sheng, where are you going? I can give you a ride on the way.\"Before Qi Sheng could respond, Qu Zhi, who was sitting beside Zheng Baozhu, spoke, \"He's going to the subway station.\"Qi Sheng: \"...\"He smiled in their direction, \"Yes.\"\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"Then you can get in.\"\"No need,\" Qi Sheng declined Zheng Baozhu's offer on his own accord while Qu Zhi watched, \"The subway station is right outside the Science and Technology Park. I'll walk out myself.\"\"Oh, alright then. We'll go ahead,\" Zheng Baozhu waved to him and closed the window before driving away. Qi Sheng stood there, inhaling the car exhaust, but he still maintained a smile.Inside the car, Qu Zhi turned his head to look at Zheng Baozhu for a while and asked, \"Were you working in the afternoon? Your makeup seems a bit different from usual.\"\"Wow,\" Zheng Baozhu chuckled lightly, \"Professor Qu can even tell the difference in makeup?\"\"...\"Qu Zhi coughed lightly, \"Is it strange?\"\"Not at all, I'm just praising you,\" Zheng Baozhu said, \"I was outside shooting photos in the afternoon, so when I came out, I only changed my clothes and didn't remove the makeup.\"\"I see,\" Qu Zhi replied and didn't say anything more. Zheng Baozhu suggested, \"Since we're close to the area, shall we eat here? There's a hotpot restaurant near Starlight Park, and the food is quite good. I made a reservation on the phone earlier.\"\"Alright,\" Qu Zhi said but still seemed a bit worried, \"But you're a celebrity now. Aren't you afraid of being recognized?\"\"Don't worry, no one recognized me when I was outside shooting today.\"But just to be safe, they should try to get a private room later.The hotpot restaurant was packed, and when Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi arrived, most tables were occupied. Luckily, a group just finished dining in a private room, so the staff led them there.After ordering their dishes, Zheng Baozhu enthusiastically showed Qu Zhi a few photos she took in the afternoon, \"Look, these are the ones I took this afternoon. Aren't they beautiful?\"The photos on her phone were either taken by Zhou Xiaonan using a mobile phone or chosen by the photographer because they were of excellent quality. Qu Zhi flipped through several pictures and awkwardly said, \"Yes, very beautiful.\"\"I think so too. I'm really good-looking,\" Zheng Baozhu said confidently.\"...\"Qu Zhi chuckled softly and said, \"But didn't you feel cold in those clothes?\"\"Of course, I did. That's why I wanted to eat hotpot. But Sister Xiaonan wouldn't let me.\"Qu Zhi raised an eyebrow and said, \"She didn't let you eat, but she agreed for you to take me out for hotpot?\"Zheng Baozhu replied with conviction, \"As long as she doesn't see it.\"\"Hmm... a brilliant strategy, well done.\"However, Zheng Baozhu still felt a bit guilty in her heart, \"I'll just take a few bites tonight, and after I get back, I'll do some exercise and rest.\"Qu Zhi couldn't help but furrow his brows, \"You are already quite thin, losing more weight is not healthy.\"\"There's no way around it. Celebrities are all obsessed with being slim, needing to keep getting thinner and thinner.\"\"You don't have to follow their obsession,\" Qu Zhi said, \"You look great on camera now. You're very photogenic.\"Zheng Baozhu blurted out, \"That's because I'm like Xi Shi1\u00a0in your eyes.\"After saying this, the private room fell silent.Once Zheng Baozhu realized what she had said, she panicked: \"...\"Help! Help! Can I take back what I just said?What was I even saying, ahhhh!Zheng Baozhu felt like collapsing. Why did she always make a fool of herself in front of Qu Zhi?Both of them remained motionless for some time. Qu Zhi also seemed frozen in place, sitting on the chair in a daze.\"The hot pot base is here for you both,\" a server entered the room and noticed that the atmosphere felt like a paused frame from a movie.The server paused for a moment before placing the hot pot base and glancing around the room. Then he subtly arranged the ingredients before unwrapping them, \"Would you like to start cooking now?\" he asked uncertainly.Zheng Baozhu finally snapped out of her daze, \"Yes, please turn on the stove for us.\"\"Sure,\" The server turned on the stove while another server brought the dishes they ordered. The atmosphere in the room gradually returned to normal. Zheng Baozhu looked at Qu Zhi across the table and forced a dry smile, \"Haha, you know I've never been good at the Chinese language since I was a child. Please don't take it to heart.\"Qu Zhi remained silent for a moment, then looked up and said, \"What if I take it to heart?\"\"...What?\" Zheng Baozhu's mind went blank again.Qu Zhi looked at her and repeated, \"What if I take it to heart? Will you take responsibility for me?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He even learned to do moral blackmail.\"Half a year ago, a stray cat appeared at the entrance of our hotel. As soon as it saw me, it bumped into me and then just laid down on the ground. Later, Liang Huihui and others took care of it, I even saw you feeding it once.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi raised an eyebrow, \"So what?\"\"So, is this your way of repaying me by passing on that experience? Impressive,\" Zheng Baozhu replied.Qu Zhi looked at her for a while and then let out a soft hum, \"You said so much, but aren't you just trying to avoid taking responsibility?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She couldn't believe the person in front of her was really Qu Zhi! Could he be possessed by the cat's spirit or something?The nearby server was becoming anxious, thinking, \"Come on, girl, aren't you going to respond to such a handsome guy? If you can't handle it, let someone else take over!\"\"Alright, I'll take responsibility for it. I'll help you cook all the beef tripe and duck intestines!\" Zheng Baozhu said as she picked up a piece of premium beef tripe, dipped it in the sauce for a few seconds, and then fished it out, \"Just right!\"She placed the cooked tripe into Qu Zhi's bowl. The fragrance of the hot pot filled the air. Qu Zhi took a glance at it, picked it up with his chopsticks, and dipped it in the sauce.Zheng Baozhu looked at him as he ate the tripe and asked with concern, \"Is it delicious?\"Qu Zhi nodded, \"Not bad.\"\"Then let me cook another piece of beef for you!\" Zheng Baozhu started to serve him attentively, taking care of Qu Zhi all evening, but she didn't eat much herself.She couldn't help feeling a bit guilty.She wondered if Qu Zhi's earlier words held any hidden meaning, but she managed to brush it off, and Qu Zhi didn't bring it up again.She didn't want to admit it, but she felt a bit timid. Earlier, she had told Meng Yaxin that she craved Qu Zhi, but now that the opportunity was right in front of her, she felt somewhat scared.Could this be what they call \"Ye Gong Hao Long\"??1\"...\"No, that couldn't be right. Zheng Baozhu couldn't believe she was acting so timidly. It was probably just because the situation came up so suddenly that she wasn't mentally prepared. Yeah!Taking a deep breath, Zheng Baozhu tried to clear her mind, but thoughts of Qu Zhi kept flooding in. Did he mean what he said earlier as a joke, or did he really have those intentions?Qu Zhi wouldn't play such jokes with people, so maybe he really wants to...No, no, she can't think about this any further.Zheng Baozhu thought of some stimulating scenes and buried her face in the blanket, her cheeks burning.... So it turned out she was indeed Ye Gong Hao Long! What's the use of being so excited now!The sound of her phone vibrating was particularly noticeable in the quiet room. Zheng Baozhu reached out a hand from under the blanket to grab her phone and then buried herself back into the covers.The message was from Meng Yaxin, who saw someone in the group chat saying that Zheng Baozhu went out to eat hotpot with Qu Zhi, so she was asking about their progress.Zheng Baozhu: The progress is that I downloaded an anti-scam app after I came back.Meng Yaxin: ??? What's going on?What kind of magical development is this?Zheng Baozhu didn't reply further, she just held the blanket and daydreamed until she fell asleep.A few days later, the photography team quickly organized Zheng Baozhu's photoshoot pictures. The photographers thought the photos were great and they sent more photos than originally agreed. Zhou Xiaonan asked Zheng Baozhu to pick about fifteen photos to post on Weibo.Zheng Baozhu looked at the photos for a long time, finding it difficult to choose.Oh my, why do they all look so good! She's captivated by her own beauty!In the end, she managed to select fifteen photos and uploaded them on Weibo at the designated time. As soon as the photos were posted, her followers started leaving comments. During this time, they even gave themselves a name - Golden Yuanbao.However, Zheng Baozhu felt this nickname hit the nail on the head.Zhou Xiaonan anticipated that Zheng Baozhu's photos would garner attention on Weibo, but she never expected it to attract so many people. She initially thought about buying a trending hashtag for Zheng Baozhu, but it turns out Zheng Baozhu's photos had already climbed to the fifth spot on the trending list.This was the highest-ranking trending topic Zheng Baozhu had ever achieved, leaving her a bit stunned.\"Sister Xiaonan, this isn't a trending topic you bought for me, right?\" Zheng Baozhu held her phone, looking at Zhou Xiaonan with curiosity.Zhou Xiaonan sat in front of her computer, continuously refreshing the data: \"Really not, I originally planned to get you a trending topic around the tenth spot, but I never expected... you saved me some money.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu fell silent for a moment and asked again, \"But did you buy one for me, though?\"The comments were already in the tens of thousands, she couldn't keep up with all of them. Weibo seemed to have gone crazy, with hundreds of thousands of comments by now.Zhou Xiaonan replied, \"I've been busy with studio work lately. How would I have the time to buy a trending topic for you on Weibo?\"Zheng Baozhu quietly checked her comments and read through what the new ones were saying.\u300cAhhh, sister, you are too amazing! What kind of celestial being are you? \u300d\u300cWife, how can you be so enchanting!!! I'm completely mesmerized! \u300d\u300cSister Immortal, thank you for your hard work on Earth! \u300d\u300cZheng Baozhu looks very high-end, giving a feeling of the 70s and 80s! A bit like Su Mingmei!\u300d\u300cThe comment above is right. Nowadays, stars are so ordinary, all trying to become internet celebrities and losing their uniqueness! Promise me you won't lose your uniqueness, the current Zheng Baozhu is perfect!\u300d\u300cWuwuwu, thank you, sister, for taking the entertainment industry twenty years back! I'm really tired of seeing internet celebrities' faces. \u300d\u300cZheng Baozhu is wearing the high-end brand JS's spring show outfit! She looks stunning in it. JS, take my money!! [image]\u300dBelow are a bunch of comments urging JS to sponsor Zheng Baozhu.Zheng Baozhu: \"\u2026\"Every netizen is a genius. Not only do they know how to praise lavishly, but they also find ways to support income-generating endeavors.\"I see many netizens are going to JS's Weibo and asking them to sponsor you,\" Zhou Xiaonan noticed that the netizens were having fun with memes and told Zheng Baozhu with a smile.Zheng Baozhu replied, \"I saw that too, they're also telling me not to lose weight.\"Zhou Xiaonan: \"\u2026\"Clearing her throat, she pretended not to hear that statement, \"This wave is JS riding on your popularity. If they were smart, they should retweet your Weibo and claim credit for supporting you.\"Not long after Zhou Xiaonan said this, JS's official Weibo indeed retweeted Zheng Baozhu's post, thanking her for supporting domestic brands. Zheng Baozhu thought that things would end like this and the heat of the photos would gradually subside. The surge in attention was already an unexpected joy for her and she was quite satisfied.However, on that very day, someone from JS contacted Zhou Xiaonan, expressing their desire to make Zheng Baozhu one of the brand's spokespersons. JS was an established domestic clothing brand that had been targeting the mid-range market. Their products were not cheap, but compared to international luxury brands, they were considered affordable. With the rise of the internet, many emerging brands emerged and posed a significant challenge to JS, resulting in declining sales.However, since its restructuring a couple of years ago, the brand's style underwent a significant breakthrough, and its marketing strategies became more precise. The brand visibly revitalized, experiencing a resurgence and launching the high-end subsidiary line JS, promoting the slogan of being China's high-end custom.One could see their ambition.When Zhou Xiaonan saw the message from the other party, she was momentarily stunned and even suspected it might be a scam, \"Baozhu, someone from JS contacted me. They said they want to discuss a collaboration for brand endorsement.\"\"Huh?\" Zheng Baozhu was sitting there playing with her phone and was equally puzzled upon hearing this, \"Um, did you download the anti-scam app on your phone?\"\"...\"Zhou Xiaonan didn't reply but first verified the authenticity with the person on the other end and confirmed that they were indeed from JS. Then she told Zheng Baozhu, \"It's not a scam; they really want to discuss cooperation.\"Zheng Baozhu got up from the sofa and walked over to sit next to Zhou Xiaonan, pulling a funny expression, \"Recently, it seems like JS has indeed started looking for non-celebrity endorsements. Lin Ziqin is their main brand spokesperson, right?\"\"Yes, but their endorsements are very detailed. Lin Ziqin has the highest title, he's the only one with that title,\" Zhou Xiaonan was familiar with the way brands operated, \"Apart from Lin Ziqin, there's a lesser-known actress and a few contestants from talent shows.\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"I see. The hierarchy in the entertainment industry is strict. But I'm nobody, though.\"Just a while ago, she was still acting as a foreground actor at the Film and Television City.\"But you have a lot of popularity now. Your photos from today have truly gone viral. Besides, they probably really think you look beautiful in their outfits, so they offered you the endorsement for JS. Although it's a subsidiary brand, it's still their high-end line, and no star has endorsed it yet. Finally, they see great potential in your future development, so they want to sign you now while you're still relatively affordable,\" Zhou Xiaonan explained.Zheng Baozhu: \"\u2026\"The last reason was quite humbling.\"So, are you interested in the collaboration?\" Zhou Xiaonan asked.Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"Of course. Although the endorsement fee may not be much, every bit counts.\"\"Alright, then I'll go negotiate for you,\" Zhou Xiaonan said, \"I'll try my best to get a higher price for you.\"\"Thank you!\"Zhou Xiaonan quoted a price that was not too low for a newcomer and was prepared for a few back-and-forth negotiations. However, to her surprise, the other party agreed quite readily without much hassle. Perhaps they wanted to capitalize on the current wave of popularity and get things done quickly. The process went swiftly, and on the day of signing the contract, both Senrui and JS announced their first brand spokesperson for JS on Weibo.Zheng Baozhu's Weibo exploded with excitement.\u300c???? They actually paid for the endorsement!!!\u300d\u300cHahaha, I'm dying of laughter. Our Baozhu got her first endorsement?\u300d\u300cI knew it! Value truly is currency. \u300d\u300cCongratulations, beautiful sister! Looking forward to your TV drama. \u300d\u300cSince it's like this, let me be frank. The necklace and earrings Baozhu wore in the photos last time were from Zhenyi, so shouldn't Zhenyi Jewelry also get her to endorse their brand? \u300d\u300cZhenyi Jewelry, you're welcome!\u00a0 \u300dZheng Baozhu: \"\u2026\"This is going a bit too far. Zhenyi Jewelry is an absolute top-tier Chinese jewelry brand and is even older than Zheng Baozhu. They have always had high-profile endorsements and their brand ambassadors had always been top-tier celebrities like her aunt, Su Mingmei.When Su Mingmei was still alive, Zhenyi Jewelry was always endorsed by her, and they never changed their spokesperson. Many of Su Mingmei's personal jewelry pieces were also from Zhenyi. After Su Ming passed away, Zhenyi didn't hire any new ambassadors for quite some time, showing how devoted they were. Later on, when they did hire new ambassadors, they were all A-list actresses just like Su Mingmei.However, in recent years, they also started hiring some popular actors with high social media following. Currently, their spokesperson is Sun Jing, who had a minor conflict with Zheng Baozhu on a set before.Sun Jing is beautiful and popular, but her acting has always been controversial, and there have been rumors of her relying on resources for her success. In the past, Zhenyi Jewelry would never have considered her as a spokesperson.\"Perhaps the brand has no choice but to cater to the current trend and rely on popularity,\" Zheng Baozhu said while sitting in the studio with Zhou Xiaonan, overseeing the renovation and chatting.The studio renovation was almost complete and would be ready for official use soon. Due to Zheng Baozhu's sudden surge in popularity in recent days, there was a significant increase in job applications to the studio, and both Zheng Baozhu and Zhou Xiaonan were overwhelmed with the number of resumes.Zhou Xiaonan shuffled through a file and said, \"It might have something to do with their internal conflicts as well. I've heard some gossip about Zhenyi. They say there's a serious power struggle within their family. The young master of Zhenyi was not very powerful and was sent abroad for a while. Recently, I heard that he has returned.\"\"Really? Tell me more!\" Hearing about this, Zheng Baozhu's interest was piqued. Who doesn't enjoy hearing about gossip in wealthy families? \"The young master of Zhenyi was not very powerful?\"\"Why, haven't you seen it in palace drama? Wouldn't the crown princes always have less power? The emperors don't like to be sidelined by their heirs,\" Zhou Xiaonan explained.\"Haha, that makes sense,\" Zheng Baozhu recalled some palace dramas she had watched, \"So, this is a struggle between the pro-imperial faction and the reformist faction?\"\"More or less, but the spokespersons are just an external manifestation of their struggle,\" Zhou Xiaonan replied.\"Wow, it's so exciting.\"\"...\"Zhou Xiaonan glanced at Zheng Baozhu, \"You better get back to screening resumes. Zhenyi's situation is much more complicated than Senrui's. It's not like a few comments from netizens can secure you the endorsement.\"\"I'm not doing it for the endorsement,\" Zheng Baozhu muttered, \"I'm just interested in the gossip. I've been buying things from their brand for so many years, yet I had no idea about all this drama.\"Sitting back at the computer, while screening resumes, Zheng Baozhu received a message from Wang Jingyi.Wang Jingyi: Sister, I just saw the trending topic. You got an endorsement deal with JS!!!Zheng Baozhu: Yes!Wang Jingyi: Wow, that's awesome! Congratulations, sister, wuwuwu!Wang Jingyi: It's amazing how we both came from the same background. Now I suddenly feel emotional.Seeing this, Zheng Baozhu also remembered the days when they both worked hard together, doing foreground roles in the Film and Television City. Although it wasn't that long ago, it felt like a distant memory.Zheng Baozhu: How have you been lately? I've been really busy after the New Year and haven't contacted you for so long.Wang Jingyi: I'm still taking on acting roles in the Film and Television City.\u00a0 Luckily, now I'm getting some supporting roles, so it's not as tiring as before.Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and asked, \"Have you considered signing with a talent agency?\"Wang Jingyi: You know how it is in the Film and Television City. Many people come to approach us, but there aren't many trustworthy ones.Zheng Baozhu: I'm in the process of setting up my own personal studio. If you're interested, you can sign with my studio. Although I don't have many projects right now, I can guarantee that I won't deceive you.Wang Jingyi was taken aback. She didn't expect it could be done like this!Wang Jingyi: Wow, I feel at ease following you! Moreover, I believe in your potential. Once your drama airs, you'll definitely be popular. If I stick with you, I can enjoy the limelight too.Zheng Baozhu: Hahaha, sure! I'll send you the studio's address, and whenever you have time, you can come over for an interview.Wang Jingyi: Alright! You're truly a treasure of a sister.Zheng Baozhu sent the location to Wang Jingyi and then called out to Zhou Xiaonan, \"Sister Xiaonan, come here!\"Zhou Xiaonan didn't raise her head and asked, \"What's up? Did you find a suitable assistant?\"\"No,\" Zheng Baozhu chuckled, \"I just signed a new artist for our studio!\"Zhou Xiaonan: \"???\"Finally, Zhou Xiaonan lifted her head to look, is this Zheng Baozhu's self-cultivation as a businesswoman?But what surprised her, even more, was that just as the two of them were busy preparing for the studio, a trending topic called [Zheng Baozhu Plastic Surgery] unstoppably soared to the top of the trending list.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The account posted a photo of Zheng Baozhu from her days as an extra in the Film and Television City, but it's unclear where they got the picture from.At that time, Zheng Baozhu was just an extra, so her costume and styling in the photo were very ordinary. However, it was because she made an ordinary cheongsam look so stunning that it led to Sun Jing wanting to replace her. The blogger spreading the rumor was evidently not ignorant, they deliberately edited Zheng Baozhu's face to look ugly!Zheng Baozhu had never seen such a shameless person before, photoshopping the picture to imply she got plastic surgery!\"To think they're both photoshopping and buying hot searches for me. Am I already this popular?\" Zheng Baozhu was close to laughing out of frustration. Buying a hot search isn't cheap at all, she couldn't fathom who was willing to spend so much to get the top spot.The last time someone spent so lavishly just to annoy her was Qu Zhi :)Zheng Baozhu clicked on the marketing account's comments, and unsurprisingly, the top comments were all negative.\u300cA few days ago, she bought so many hot searches, now she's already crashed. \u300d\u300cShe copied Su Mingmei's appearance. \u300d\u300cSo what is Zheng Baozhu actually known for? The entertainment industry is really not picky anymore. Anyone can get an endorsement?\u300d\u300cHahaha, Zheng Baozhu is actually known for her face.\u00a0 Didn't expect even her face to be fake. \u300dZheng Baozhu smiled. She clicked on the profiles of those who were criticizing her and found out that many of them were Sun Jing's fans.\"Xiaonan, I found a blind spot!\" Zheng Baozhu, who was next to Zhou Xiaonan, called out, \"Many of those criticizing me are Sun Jing's fans! It's absurd. If I were to say I'm Sun Jing's rival, I'd probably want to criticize myself for reaching too far. But they're making her happy by raising my value!\"Zhou Xiaonan's fingers flew quickly on the keyboard, as she talked to people on the web version of WeChat and replied to Zheng Baozhu, \"Based on the information I've gathered so far, it's most likely Sun Jing's side causing trouble.\"Zheng Baozhu was speechless. She truly didn't expect Sun Jing to go this far, \"Why is she targeting me? Could it be because I cursed at her on the set back then, and she's held a grudge until now?\"\"...\"Zhou Xiaonan paused for a moment, stopped what she was doing, and turned to look at Zheng Baozhu, \"When did you curse at Sun Jing on set?\"\"It was when I was an extra... Let's not talk about it.\"\"...\"Zhou Xiaonan fell silent.Zheng Baozhu was indeed fearless. Even as an extra, she dared to argue with the lead actor on set!Coughing lightly, Zhou Xiaonan said to Zheng Baozhu, \"Sun Jing's endorsement contract with Zhenyi Jewelry is expiring in two months, so they might be worried that Zhenyi will really give the endorsement to you, hence deliberately causing this situation.\"As all of Zheng Baozhu's current works are yet to be released, her appeal largely relies on her face. Sun Jing has found the perfect angle to attack.Hearing Zhou Xiaonan's explanation, Zheng Baozhu found it even more amusing, \"They have quite a sense of crisis, huh? Zhenyi hasn't said anything, yet they jumped out first.\"Zheng Baozhu didn't believe that Zhenyi would change its spokesperson just because of a few comments from netizens.\"Anyway, it's not a bad thing, and it can even act as a barrier for you. With more popularity, you'll have more competition. This is a good opportunity to act on it while you're still not that well-known,\" Zhou Xiaonan suggested.\"Haha.\"\"I'll try to remove the hot search and lower the heat for you. How do you want to respond to this matter?\"Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and asked Zhou Xiaonan, \"Does removing the hot search also cost money?\"\"Yes,\" Zhou Xiaonan nodded.Zheng Baozhu said, \"Then why should I spend that money! I will have them foot the bill to remove the hot search!\"Zhou Xiaonan: \"...\"That's Zheng Baozhu's boldness for you.\"How are you going to handle this?\" asked Zhou Xiaonan.\"First, I'll start by going back home and digging up all my childhood photos!\" Zheng Baozhu replied.Although electronic devices were convenient nowadays, they only store recent photos. Childhood photos were usually kept in old albums at home. She didn't bring the album with her to the hotel; it was still at her parents' house, so she would have to make a trip back home...But, oh well, she could only hope her mother didn't have the leisure to browse the internet.\"I'll leave now, let's stay in touch by phone,\" Zheng Baozhu said, picking up her bag and leaving the studio.At the Research Institute in the Science and Technology Park, during the lunch break, the scientists gathered together. When they opened Weibo, they saw Zheng Baozhu's plastic surgery hot search.\"Old Qu!\" Qi Sheng instinctively called out to Qu Zhi, staring at his phone without even looking at the road as he walked towards Qu Zhi's office desk, \"Miss Baozhu is on the hot search again!\"Qu Zhi had seen Zheng Baozhu on the hot search quite frequently during this period and had gradually gotten used to it, \"Isn't it normal to be on the hot search?\"After all, she's now a celebrity.Qi Sheng anxiously said, \"This time is different! They're saying she got plastic surgery!\"Qu Zhi furrowed his brows, directly taking Qi Sheng's phone to look. Indeed, there were many comments on Weibo blackening Zheng Baozhu. Although there were also some defending her, it seemed like it would be hard to overpower the criticism in a short time.As Qu Zhi looked at those malicious comments, his brows furrowed even more. Qi Sheng stood next to him and asked, \"Zheng Baozhu couldn't have had plastic surgery, right? You have the most say in this matter!\"Qu Zhi replied, \"Of course not, she looked like this since childhood.\"He saved the photo from the marketing account and transferred it to his computer. Qi Sheng looked at him curiously and asked, \"What are you doing?\"\"Proving that this photo was photoshopped later,\" Qu Zhi said and started working on his computer. Qi Sheng watched him with admiration; Qu Zhi's focused look was on par with his usual demeanor in the laboratory.He suddenly had a new perspective. He used to think that Qu Zhi didn't understand romance, but now he realized that Qu Zhi was truly great! With his touch, even a piece of wood could be transformed into a delicate carving!While Qu Zhi was analyzing the photo, Zheng Baozhu had already returned home. She quietly opened the door with her key, but unexpectedly, her father was standing at the door, looking at her.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Awkwardly, she smiled at her father and asked him softly, \"Dad, why weren't you at the company during lunchtime?\"Father Zheng replied, \"Do you still have the audacity to ask? Your mother called me this morning, saying that everyone online is criticizing you. She was so angry that she scolded me over the phone.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Swallowing hard, she cautiously looked into the room, \"Then... where's Mom?\"\"Your mother is still arguing with people online,\" Father Zheng replied, with some helplessness in his voice, \"She was so angry that she even registered a Weibo account and was called a troll by others.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"\"You, why didn't you try to persuade Mom?\" Zheng Baozhu asked.\"Do you think I can persuade her? Just now, she even suggested that I should register an account and join her in confronting those netizens,\" Father Zheng replied.\"...\"Zheng Baozhu looked at her dad in astonishment, \"Dad, you even know the term 'netizens'?\"Father Zheng said, \"Your mom just learned it.\"\"...\"\"Is Baozhu back?\" Su Mingxi's voice came from inside the room, to which Zheng Baozhu responded attentively.\"Since you're back, come in. Why are you standing at the door?\" Su Mingxi's voice echoed again. Zheng Baozhu had to change into slippers and walked in, carrying her bag, \"Mom, you didn't take a nap?\"Su Mingxi looked at her and coldly snorted, \"Huh, can I even sleep? I was so angry that I woke up.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu sat down at the side and began to persuade, \"Mom, you're already an adult. Why are you arguing with those netizens? Many of them might still be in elementary school. What's the point of arguing with a bunch of elementary school students?\"\"Am I the one who started arguing with them? Weren't they the ones who insulted you first?\" Su Mingxi continued, then shifted her focus, \"You've arrived just in time. Tell me, how did those people start saying that you had plastic surgery?\"\"Sigh, why else? They just can't stand seeing others doing well.\"\"Why can't they stand you doing well? What did you do to them?\" Su Mingxi's anger flared up again, \"People you haven't even met in person are so certain that you had plastic surgery. It's ridiculous! I know what my own child looks like better than anyone else! They even called me a paid internet troll, but I think they are the real trolls!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"It seems that Mom has become proficient in various internet terms now.\"Mom, don't be angry. They are happy when you get upset,\" Zheng Baozhu patted Su Mingxi's back to comfort her, \"They are just afraid that I'll take away their endorsements, so they deliberately smear me, bringing me down, and then the endorsements will be theirs. Don't worry; I'm back to find my old photos. It's easy to clarify whether I had plastic surgery or not.\"Su Mingxi frowned and said, \"That's why I told you not to enter the entertainment industry. The internet is full of chaos now. People can say anything. Your aunt didn't have so many troubles back then...\"\"Mom, you can't generalize everything like that. Every situation has two sides. The internet has indeed brought us convenience, and technology has truly changed our lives,\" Zheng Baozhu explained.\"... \"Su Mingxi turned her head and carefully observed Zheng Baozhu, \"Why do I feel like you are starting to sound more and more like Qu Zhi? By the way, speaking of Qu Zhi, did you treat him to a meal last time as I asked?\"\"Yes, I did, I did,\" Zheng Baozhu replied eagerly, quickly getting up from the couch, \"By the way, Mom, are my photo albums still in my room? I'll go and find them.\"After speaking, Zheng Baozhu hurriedly walked into her room. The room had not been used for a long time, but it was still clean. Relying on her memory, she found the old photo album in the cabinet \u2013 a collection of photographs from her early years. Opening the cover, she looked inside.This album was purchased by her parents when she was born, the first photo inside was taken at the hospital. In those days, taking photos was not as convenient as it is now, but Zheng Baozhu's parents documented her growth through photographs.Since she was young, Zheng Baozhu loved taking photos, and the album was arranged chronologically. As she turned each page, the photos showed her gradually growing up.While looking through the album, Zheng Baozhu realized that she had taken many photos together with Qu Zhi when they were younger. Back then, they seemed to dislike each other, but there were surprisingly many pictures of them together. Seeing these photos, Zheng Baozhu started to recall some memories \u2013 some were taken during school performances, others at sports events, class photos, and even some of Su Mingxi pulling them together for individual shots.Looking at these photos, Zheng Baozhu suddenly had a strong feeling that Qu Zhi had truly grown up with her.After closing the album, she found a paper bag in the room and placed the album inside. When she came out carrying the paper bag, Su Mingxi was still sitting on the couch, but this time with an envelope in her hand.Seeing Zheng Baozhu coming out, Su Mingxi waved her hand and held her back, \"Baozhu, come over here, I need to talk to you about something.\"Zheng Baozhu immediately had a bad premonition. She could see that her parents' attitude towards her being a star might have changed again because of today's incident. Could they return to their original stance of not allowing it?Smiling at Su Mingxi, she thought it would be best to leave, \"Mom, I'm actually quite busy right now. How about we talk another day?\"Su Mingxi glanced at her and didn't relent, \"Come here; it won't take much of your time.\"Zheng Baozhu could only go over and sit on the nearby seat, feeling uneasy.Su Mingxi said, \"Your aunt left a will before she left.\"That statement instantly stunned Zheng Baozhu. She was at a loss for words and looked at Su Mingxi, asking, \"Huh?\"Su Mingxi opened the envelope and took out a bank card, saying, \"At that time, the country's economy wasn't as good as it is now, and actors' pay was far from what today's stars earn. Nevertheless, your aunt still made some money. She donated part of it and gave the rest to your grandparents, uncle, and me. We never used that money, and I kept it in the bank without paying much attention to it. Over the years, the interest has accumulated.\"As Su Mingxi spoke, she handed the bank card to Zheng Baozhu, saying, \"All the money is in this card, now I'm giving it all to you.\"Holding the card in her hand, Zheng Baozhu was still a bit puzzled, \"Why are you suddenly giving me money?\"Su Mingxi said, \"I know you're busy with your studio recently, and starting anything is difficult, you need money for everything. I heard even buying hot search topics on Weibo costs hundreds of thousands.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Mom has really figured out how Weibo works.\"Moreover, this money isn't mine; it's your aunt's. Consider it as her supporting your dreams.\"Zheng Baozhu hesitated and looked at Su Mingxi, \"Mom, from what you're saying, does it mean you no longer object to me becoming a star?\"Su Mingxi chuckled, \"I've objected for so many years. Do you think it made a difference? Did it? In the end, you guys educated me. Even if you are not to be a star, it has to be our own choice, never something forced upon us. They are now trying to discredit you, just to snatch your resources, right? Fine, then let's fight back and snatch theirs. Our family won't tolerate this.\"\"...\" Uh, how should I put it, thank you, Sun Jing?\"Mom, I didn't expect you to be so decisive in the battle,\" Zheng Baozhu chuckled from the side.Su Mingxi said, \"It's their fault. We're not afraid of competition. Whoever has the ability will succeed, but it has to be fair competition. What's the point of using dirty tricks behind someone's back? I can't stand that.\"\"Okay, let's not sit idly and just take it lying down, right?\" Zheng Baozhu put away the card given by Su Mingxi, stood up, and said, \"I'll go back and handle this matter. They won't be arrogant on the internet for much longer!\"After returning to the hotel with the photo album, Zheng Baozhu selected some pictures and took photos of them with her phone. She also picked some recent photos from her phone, arranging them in chronological order from the age of eleven to twenty-five. Then, she uploaded them all to her Weibo.Zheng Baozhu V: Sorry, but I am indeed Zheng Baozhu, from childhood to adulthood.With a concise caption and a cold smiley face, the sarcastic value skyrocketed. The fifteen photos in the post were even more impactful.Notably, this Weibo post was directly sent in response to the trending topic [Zheng Baozhu Plastic Surgery].This trending topic was still occupying the top spot, and soon after Zheng Baozhu's Weibo was posted, many people saw it.\u300cHahaha, I can't stop laughing! Sister, you're so amazing!\u300d\u300cWhat did I just see? Fifteen photos of our Baozhu growing up!! My wife, you're awesome!!!\u300d\u300cOh, really? I don't believe it. Unless you also post photos from ages one to ten for me to see.\u300d\u300cOh, wow, I wasn't interested in this drama at first, but now I declare myself as your fan. I like how fierce you are.\u300d\u300cIt's all solved now; the truth is out. \u300d\u300cLittle Yuanbao is here! Baozhu, don't mind those people. Someone has already provided evidence that the blackened photo is photoshopped!!\u300dZheng Baozhu was taken aback when she saw this comment. That photo was definitely photoshopped, but did Zhou Xiaonan manage to get it authenticated so quickly?Other comments also mentioned that the blackened photo was photoshopped and they included a link. Zheng Baozhu followed the link and found an unfamiliar account that posted evidence of the photoshopped images, providing convincing proof.What's more, this evidence was directly posted under the trending topic [Zheng Baozhu Plastic Surgery]....It seems like great minds think alike.She took a screenshot of the Weibo post and sent it to Zhou Xiaonan, asking, \"Sister Xiaonan, is this the person you found? Impressive evidence!\"Zhou Xiaonan: ? I did find someone, but it's not this account.Zhou Xiaonan: I just asked, it's not them.Zheng Baozhu: ? Then who is this person?Zhou Xiaonan: I don't know. Maybe it's someone from your side, or maybe a righteous vigilante.\"...\"Zheng Baozhu silently checked the account that posted the evidence of photoshopping. The account wasn't new, but there were only a few Weibo posts, and one of them was tagged with a location from abroad.With a thought, Zheng Baozhu sent the screenshot to Qu Zhi, asking, \"Qu Zhi, is this hero you?!\"Qu Zhi was currently at work and didn't have his phone with him. When he saw Zheng Baozhu's message, it was already after working hours. He thought for a moment and decided to call her. Zheng Baozhu answered the phone almost immediately, \"Qu Zhi, are you off work?\"\"Uh...\" Qu Zhi replied slightly embarrassedly as he was about to explain, \"I left my work phone in the locker and didn't see your message.\"\"I guessed as much!\"Qu Zhi said, \"If you need to reach me urgently in the future, you can call the administration office; there will always be someone there, and they'll help you get in touch with me.\"\"Oh... What's the number for the administration office then?\"Qu Zhi hooked his lips and smiled lightly as he walked outside the company, \"I'll write it down for you when I'm back, and you can save it.\"\"Okay then,\" Zheng Baozhu agreed and remembered the question she asked earlier, \"So, was that Weibo post from you?\"\"Yeah,\" Qu Zhi replied softly.Zheng Baozhu was not surprised, but her cheeks were still slightly flushed, \"Thank you. Your Weibo post is now at the top, and whenever someone opens this topic, they can see the evidence you posted.\"\"That's what I intended,\" Qu Zhi said, showing some concern, \"Are you okay now? Everything all right?\"\"Of course, I've posted photos of myself from the age of eleven to twenty-five. Anyone with eyes can see that I've been like this since I was young!\"Qu Zhi chuckled again and said, \"I'll be back soon. Are you still at the hotel now?\"\"Yes, I haven't eaten yet. Shall we eat together when you come back?\"\"Sure,\" Qu Zhi's lips curved slightly as he told Zheng Baozhu on the other end of the phone, \"I'll hang up now; I'm going to check your Weibo.\"\"Hahaha, go ahead!\"As Qu Zhi was checking Zheng Baozhu's Weibo, Sun Jing's manager was also following the latest developments, \"Now, the topic of Zheng Baozhu's plastic surgery has turned into a competition of her photos. This topic can't be used anymore; let's withdraw it. Otherwise, it will just fuel their momentum.\"Sun Jing clicked her tongue, \"Fine, let's withdraw it.\"The manager looked at the computer and frowned even more than before, \"Zheng Baozhu's studio just posted a Weibo saying they'll sue those who spread unfounded rumors.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng Baozhu's new lawyer was the one introduced by Lawyer Han previously. After the rumors about plastic surgery spread online, she immediately contacted her lawyer to handle the situation. The rumors had already been forwarded over five hundred times and the evidence that the photo was photoshopped was as solid as a mountain. If they were to sue, they had a strong case.Because the lawyer was assertive, the so-called [King of Eating Melon Seeds] marketing account quickly caved in and deleted the Weibo post. He then pinned an apology statement, but he didn't admit to photoshopping the pictures; he only claimed to have found them online.The matter of the apology also became a trending topic. Together with the trending topic [Zheng Baozhu from Childhood to Adulthood], Zheng Baozhu had three trending topics on the top rankings throughout the day, and all of them were high-ranking trends.Sun Jing's attempt to smear Zheng Baozhu backfired.After closing the Weibo app, Zheng Baozhu continued to flip through the photo album. By the time Qu Zhi arrived, she had already picked out their photos together.\"It's me, Qu Zhi,\" Qu Zhi knocked on her door. Zheng Baozhu had asked Qu Zhi to come to her room, as she was having the restaurant send their dinner up to the room. She went to open the door when she heard the knocking and even brought out a new pair of men's slippers, \"These were sent to me by Wei Zhen today, they're new!\"Qu Zhi glanced at the slippers she put out. While changing into them, he asked, \"Why did Manager Wei send you a pair of men's slippers?\"\"Uh, probably because they come in a set!\" Zheng Baozhu pointed to the pair she was wearing, which matched the pair Qu Zhi had put on, \"This pair was also sent by Manager Wei, and I think they're pretty good!\"\"Uh-huh, they are.\"But don't you find it a bit odd?Thinking about today's events, where they had been dealing with plastic surgery rumors all day, Qu Zhi realized Zheng Baozhu hadn't noticed anything amiss with this small matter.\"On my way back, I saw that the marketing account apologized to you?\"\"Yes, my lawyer handled it well,\" Zheng Baozhu closed the door and said to Qu Zhi, \"The food has been delivered, let's eat.\"\"Sure.\"The room where Zheng Baozhu stayed was a specially decorated suite with a kitchen and dining room. After washing his hands, Qu Zhi pulled out a chair and sat opposite Zheng Baozhu. When she brought the food out from the insulated container, Qu Zhi was still looking down at the photos on the table, \"Where did you find these photos?\"Zheng Baozhu put the plates down and smiled at him, \"Hehe, I found them while flipping through the photo album today. I never expected that we took so many photos together in the past.\"Zheng Baozhu pointed to one of the photos and lightly tapped it with her fingertip, \"Look, this one was taken when you were scared by a puppy, it was Mom who took the picture for us! Your eyes were all red; it really made me feel sorry for you.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"He raised his gaze and glanced at Zheng Baozhu, saying, \"Since you know your language skills aren't good, don't use words casually.\"\"How did I use it? Anyone would feel sorry for you in that situation!\"\"...\"Qu Zhi silently picked up his chopsticks, took his bowl, and said, \"Let's eat.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu also picked up her bowl and started eating. When she tried to pick up a dish, she noticed that Qu Zhi was attempting to take away the photo where she felt sorry for him.\"What are you doing?\" Zheng Baozhu swiftly pressed the photo with her finger and looked at Qu Zhi.Qu Zhi paused for a moment and said, \"Isn't this our photo together? I can take it.\"\"Uh, my mom already gave you another copy; this one is mine.\"\"Oh, really?\" Qu Zhi withdrew his hand and continued eating. Zheng Baozhu knew he wanted to get rid of his embarrassing photos, so she smiled sneakily, \"Besides, taking away this one wouldn't do you any good. I still have plenty of your embarrassing photos here.\"As she spoke, she pushed another photo in front of Qu Zhi. \"This one was taken during the Children's Day performance. As a boy, you wore heavy makeup. Look at your fiery red cheeks and those extremely long, curly lashes; it's so enchanting, hahaha!\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Why is this kind of stuff still kept until now???He felt a bit awkward, even the hand holding the chopsticks tightened. However, he pretended to be calm and said, \"Those are childhood photos. As long as I don't admit it, they aren't mine.\"\"...\"This response was not what Zheng Baozhu expected, \"You said something about my 'brilliant strategy' before, but your 'brilliant\u00a0strategy' is beyond my reach.\"Saying that, she smiled at Qu Zhi again, \"It's okay if you don't admit the childhood photos, but you can't deny the photos from when we grew up, can you?\"She then pulled out a photo from her phone and handed it to Qu Zhi, \"Take a look at this one.\"The photo was a screenshot from the video of Qu Zhi giving a lecture last time, where he was wearing a dog-ears headband given to him by a child.After seeing the photo, Qu Zhi was silent for three seconds, then looked up at the smug person sitting opposite him, \"Zheng Baozhu, don't forget that I also have your embarrassing past.\"\"Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu wasn't afraid, \"Then, I will also deny my childhood photos.\"Qu Zhi said, \"Warrior.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"\"You still haven't deleted it!\" Zheng Baozhu almost jumped up in frustration. Qu Zhi calmly held his bowl, picked up a dish slowly, and said, \"As it turns out, it was wise not to delete it. If you want us to hurt each other, I can post the video online.\"He looked up and glanced at Zheng Baozhu, \"Besides, you're a star now, maybe it will even become a hot topic.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi was indeed the same old Qu Zhi.She collected all the photos on the table and, as if afraid that Qu Zhi would sneak them off, hid them in the bedroom. Upon reflection, she initially took out the photos to reminisce with Qu Zhi about their childhood, but how did it turn into a mutual embarrassing history?...Forget it, there weren't many good memories from their childhood, and if they really reminisced, they would just end up cursing each other. :)After that day, the online uproar about Zheng Baozhu's plastic surgery gradually subsided, and Zheng Baozhu's studio officially began operating. Most of the studio's staff had been hired, enough to maintain Zheng Baozhu's daily work.However, Zheng Baozhu's current work mainly consisted of photoshoots. First, she did a set of endorsement photos for JS, then the person in charge of JS said she was arranged for an interview with a magazine, and she also had to do a set of magazine photoshoots, all featuring JS's clothing.The date for the magazine photoshoot hadn't been confirmed yet, but Gao Boyun came to visit Zheng Baozhu's studio right away.\"Not bad, it looks very professional,\" he said after touring the studio, then sat in Zheng Baozhu's office and even praised the sofa, \"This sofa is very comfortable to sit on.\"\"Of course, I tried several before picking this one,\" Zheng Baozhu put some effort into decorating the studio with Zhou Xiaonan. Although she wouldn't be working in the office most of the time, she still wanted to have the most comfortable sofa for herself.\"You've been in the spotlight recently, becoming a frequent hot topic,\" Gao Boyun said, taking a sip of the coffee on the table playfully, \"I thought you would become popular only after the drama aired, but it seems I underestimated you. Once your makeup photos were released, you became famous.\"\"That's all thanks to the support of my peers,\" Zheng Baozhu naturally referred to Sun Jing. If it weren't for Sun Jing's stunt, she wouldn't have risen to fame so quickly.Gao Boyun laughed, no longer arguing, and turned to talk about business matters, \"'New\u00a0Moon Wuxin Sword' has already wrapped up filming, and it will enter post-production. Since it's a regular martial arts drama, there won't be too many special effects, so post-production won't take too long. We aim to release it by the end of the year.\"\"Okay, that sounds good.\"\"As I mentioned before, I'm preparing for a new TV drama, and I came here today to discuss it with you.\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback, picked up the coffee on the table, and took a sip, \"Are you really planning to invite me to be the lead actress?\"\"That's the plan,\" Gao Boyun said, \"But you still need to audition for the investors to take a look.\"Zheng Baozhu asked him, \"What genre is the drama?\"\"It's a Republic-era business war drama, [Aspirations of the Heart]. It's an original script that I liked after reading it. The female lead was originally a young lady from a prominent family. Her father was framed and the family went bankrupt. The story is about her efforts to revive the family business and clear her father's name.\"Zheng Baozhu paused, \"Female-centric?\"\"Not exactly. Although the male lead doesn't have that much screen time, he has a strong influence on the story. If you had to categorize it, it would be more of a power couple?\" Gao Boyun chose his words carefully, \"The male lead came from a poor family as a child and was helped by the female lead's father. So later, when the female lead's family fell into financial ruin, he secretly supported her. However, the female lead didn't know about it initially, so they started out to be enemies at first. Later, they join forces to deal with the antagonists, so it's more of a balanced relationship.\"Zheng Baozhu recalled that Lin Ziqin also mentioned this matter last time and asked Gao Boyun curiously, \"Has the male lead been cast? Is it Lin Ziqin?\"Gao Boyun seemed a bit surprised at the question, \"Why did you think of him?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"He mentioned it to me before, saying that you wanted to cast him as the male lead for your new drama.\"\"...\"Gao Boyun pursed his lips and couldn't help but mock the popular male star, \"He's supposed to keep things secret! At least he was honest with you!\"\"...\"\"Well, when he told me that he hadn't agreed to take the role yet,\" Zheng Baozhu added on Lin Ziqin's behalf.\"...\"\"Forget it, it doesn't matter,\" Gao Boyun said, \"You said last time that Ye Ling's makeup was too plain, but this time the female lead is supposed to have a stunning appearance, and there will be many beautiful costumes.\"Zheng Baozhu was immediately interested, \"Director Gao, count me in.\"\"...\"Gao Boyun sighed.\"But this role is much more complex than Ye Ling's,\" Even though the TV drama hadn't started filming yet, Director Gao had already started discussing the characters, \"In the drama, Ye Ling had very few interactions with the male lead, and she's always portrayed as an aloof character with little emotional fluctuation. It's the easiest role for actors because there's only one state to portray.\"Zheng Baozhu nodded while listening. As she said before, the most challenging part of playing Ye Ling was the action scenes.Gao Boyun continued, \"This time it's different for the female lead. She has many different states. In the beginning, she's an innocent and naive young lady who doesn't understand the world. After the family's bankruptcy, she experiences hardships and breakdowns, but she eventually rises again with a strong heart. After she starts her career, she won't immediately succeed. She'll be deceived and betrayed; from knowing nothing to becoming cunning in her schemes. It's a role that requires the actor to patiently delve into it, it won't be easy to perform.\"Zheng Baozhu lightly replied, acknowledging that this was indeed a more complex role, especially since they wouldn't necessarily be filming in chronological order, which would increase the difficulty.After thinking for a while, Gao Boyun finally asked, \"What do you think? Are you confident?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"I think although the key moments for this character come later in the drama, the most difficult part to play will be in the beginning. I've watched similar films and television dramas before, and if the actor doesn't handle the early stages well, it's easy to make the character appear foolish, or, um, 'silly and sweet'. From the character's background, she has certainly received a higher education, even possibly having studied abroad. I believe she's highly intelligent and progressive; it's just that her family sheltered her too much, and she's inexperienced in dealing with the complexities of people's hearts.\"\"You're right.\" Gao Boyun nodded approvingly, \"That's also my biggest concern. If the early stages aren't handled well, it will discourage the audience, and the comments will be full of criticism about the lead being intellectually challenged.\"Zheng Baozhu added, \"Of course, it's not only the actor's performance but also the scriptwriting. The screenwriter shouldn't write any foolish or silly scenes for the character.\"Gao Boyun chuckled, \"Are you asking for the script from me? I'll send you the first half later, and you can take a look. The screenwriter is a well-known writer in the industry, specializing in business and espionage themes. They shouldn't disappoint you.\"\"Thank you, Director Gao. I feel relieved now.\"Just as Zheng Baozhu finished speaking, Zhou Xiaonan knocked on the door and walked in, asking, \"What are you discussing? It sounds intense.\"\"Oh, I just accepted a new script,\" Zheng Baozhu said.\"...\"Zhou Xiaonan was taken aback.Zheng Baozhu managed to receive a new script while she was here talking about the magazine photoshoot schedule?Seems like this manager is quite on top of things. :)\"I'll send you a copy of the script later, and you two can discuss it. If there are any updates on my end, I'll inform you promptly,\" Gao Boyun finished the last sip of his coffee, stood up from the sofa, and said, \"I'll head back now.\"\"Okay, Director Gao, take care!\" Zheng Baozhu walked out to see Gao Boyun off and then returned to her office. Zhou Xiaonan couldn't hold back her curiosity and asked, \"What script is Director Gao giving you?\"\"It's a Republic-era business war drama, it seems like Lin Ziqin has been confirmed for the male lead role,\" Zheng Baozhu replied.\"!\" Zhou Xiaonan immediately said without hesitation, \"Take it!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Her manager didn't seem to have any principles!\"In fact, I was also going to tell you that there's a variety show that wants you to participate, but if you're taking a TV drama role, it might conflict with the schedule,\" Zhou Xiaonan briefly mentioned the variety show. Zheng Baozhu had heard about it, and it had a lot of buzz around it, with favorable terms offered as well.After considering it for a while, Zheng Baozhu said, \"Forget about the variety show. If I'm really taking on a TV drama, I should focus on preparing for it. This role is already more challenging to portray, and it's my first lead role. I want to give it my best.\"\"Sure,\" Zhou Xiaonan wasn't someone who only focused on immediate benefits; otherwise, she wouldn't have left Starlight Entertainment. From the long-term perspective of an artist's career, Zheng Baozhu performing well in this role would be much more impactful than participating in a variety show.Soon, Gao Boyun sent over the electronic version of the script. Zheng Baozhu eagerly started reading it. The script was well-written, and the screenwriter was skilled in character development. Both the male and female leads were charismatic, especially the female lead, who was portrayed with innocence and charm without appearing naive. Even the male lead's storyline was full of tension; it was hard to believe that a male writer wrote such compelling material.\"Zheng Baozhu, there's a package sent to you,\" Zhou Xiaonan came in with a package and placed it on Zheng Baozhu's desk, \"Remember to open it later. And don't forget about the magazine photoshoot the day after tomorrow. You don't need to come to the studio tomorrow if there's no other work.\"\"Okay, Sister Xiaonan,\" Zheng Baozhu glanced at the package, and she saw the sender's name was written with a \"Lin\".Excitement filled her heart and she immediately opened the package.Inside, she found ten autographed photos from Lin Ziqin! Moreover, each photo was different! How could she choose just one?!!She couldn't contain her excitement and spread the photos on the desk, taking a picture of them and sending it to Qu Zhi: \"I received Lin Ziqin's autographed photos, yay!\"After work, Qu Zhi opened Zheng Baozhu's message and saw ten different Lin Ziqins posing and flirting with him. :)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you planning to ward off evil spirits with them?Zheng Baozhu: ...Yao Yao asked me to get them for her. You were there at the time too!Qu Zhi: Oh... Well, then go ahead and send them quickly!Zheng Baozhu: Let's give them to her when we meet next time!Qu Zhi: Just send them by courier. If you find it troublesome, I can do it for you.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Zheng Baozhu: No need, I'll send them myself :)She carefully packed the photos back into the package and asked the front desk to send the package out by post.Over the next two days, Zheng Baozhu either read the script or did the magazine photoshoot. Although it seemed like she had less work to do, her schedule was fully packed. JS was quick to work; they had already started placing Zheng Baozhu's billboards in the shopping malls, and her pictures were updated on various online platforms.Meng Yaxin saw Zheng Baozhu's billboard in a JS store while shopping and took a photo of it, sending it to their group chat: You are indeed a star now! Shouldn't you send a red envelope?Zheng Baozhu sent a big red envelope in the group chat.Meng Yaxin: Thanks, star!After Zheng Baozhu shared an emoji in the group chat, Zhou Xiaonan sent her a message: Baozhu, there's a fashion event invitation for you. Do you want to attend?She forwarded the event details and invitation to Zheng Baozhu. This fashion event was held annually and, although not the most influential among various parties, it still attracted some stars.Zheng Baozhu replied: Sure, attending won't take much time, and it can increase exposure.Zhou Xiaonan: That's what I thought too, but Sun Jing will also be there... I'm worried you two might start arguing on the spot.After all, Zheng Baozhu, being an extra, argued with Sun Jing, who was the lead.Hearing that Sun Jing would also be attending, Zheng Baozhu was indeed taken aback, but she couldn't let Sun Jing be the factor for her to avoid the event: Don't worry, as long as she doesn't provoke me, there won't be any issues.Zhou Xiaonan: ...Alright then. It's your first time attending such an event as a celebrity, so pay attention to your image, okay!Zheng Baozhu: OK.Zhou Xiaonan: I'll go talk to the organizers then.Upon learning that Zheng Baozhu would attend the fashion event, JS immediately offered a dress for her to wear on the occasion. After receiving it, Zhou Xiaonan had the styling team start working on Zheng Baozhu's makeup and hair for the event, providing several options for her to choose from.The dress for this event had a backless design, and to showcase the design, the styling team created an updo hairstyle for Zheng Baozhu. It not only highlighted her back but also accentuated her neck's graceful lines. Zheng Baozhu thought the look was stunning and decided to go with that version.On the day of the event, the weather was not very hot, so Zheng Baozhu kept a coat on while on the way. It was her first time walking the red carpet, and although it wasn't a major event, the reporters and audience at the scene were enthusiastic. As soon as she stepped out of the car, cameras were aimed at her, and the flashes kept going off.Zheng Baozhu had undergone some impromptu training beforehand, so although she felt a bit uneasy facing so many flashes when she first got out of the car, she quickly adapted to it. She stopped and smiled at the cameras.On both sides of the red carpet, there were not only reporters but also fans who managed to enter through various means. Zheng Baozhu was surprised to see some of the Golden Yuanbaos holding light boards to cheer her on! She waved at them before continuing forward.After signing on the autograph board, the emcee led her into the venue. The seating arrangement inside the venue was already prepared, and Sun Jing's seat was diagonally in front of her, relatively close.Sun Jing arrived at the venue before Zheng Baozhu and was already seated. When she saw Zheng Baozhu arriving, she only glanced sideways before smiling and chatting with the person beside her. Zheng Baozhu didn't bother with her and took her seat. Zhou Xiaonan sent her many candid shots from the red carpet, she selected some and forwarded them to a small group.Meng Yaxin: !!!!!Cen Tingting: !!!!!Qu Zhi: Alright.Meng Yaxin: ? What does 'Alright' mean?Qu Zhi: ...The literal meaning.Qu Zhi: @Zheng Baozhu, where are you attending the event?Zheng Baozhu shared her location in the group, and just then, another high-profile guest arrived. It was none other than Lin Ziqin, wearing designer haute couture, surrounded by a group of staff.Lin Ziqin had broad shoulders and a slender waist, his temperament cold and elegant. He looked great in modern clothing, exuding a sense of noble youth. His seat was next to Sun Jing's, even closer to Zheng Baozhu.As Lin Ziqin approached, he greeted Zheng Baozhu, \"Long time no see.\"\"Long time no see,\" Zheng Baozhu smiled back at him, \"By the way, I haven't thanked you for sending me the photos. The kids loved them.\"Lin Ziqin smiled and took a seat, \"You're welcome.\"Zheng Baozhu continued, \"You sent me ten different photos, it almost caused a fight among my good friends.\"\"...\"Lin Ziqin paused for a moment before speaking again, \"My bad, I didn't consider it well. I intended to sign ten different ones to make it more distinguished.\"\"Hahaha, I'm just teasing you.\"Sun Jing, who was nearby, overheard Zheng Baozhu chatting with Lin Ziqin. She knew they were both from the [New\u00a0Moon Wuxin Sword] drama. It wasn't surprising that they knew each other, but she didn't expect them to be so close.\"Can we take a photo together?\" Zheng Baozhu asked Lin Ziqin, holding her phone. Lin Ziqin nodded and said, \"Taking a photo with you is my pleasure.\"Zheng Baozhu opened the camera, \"Thanks, handsome brother!\"She held up her phone and took several photos with Lin Ziqin, then sent the pictures to the group.Zheng Baozhu: [Image] Lin Ziqin is here too! He's sitting in front of me!Meng Yaxin: Jealous.Cen Tingting: Jealous.Meng Yaxin: Wait, isn't that Sun Jing sitting next to Lin Ziqin??Zheng Baozhu: ...You're right, it's Sun Jing. You can recognize her even in a small corner.Meng Yaxin: Sun Jing's team posted photos on Weibo today! They even bought a high-ranking hot search. I recognize her!Zheng Baozhu: ...Oh.Meng Yaxin: By the way, why haven't you posted any red carpet photos on Weibo?Zheng Baozhu: I'm still retouching them. Once they're ready, I'll post them. We have our own photographer arranged for the red carpet.Meng Yaxin: That's good. Then take a few more photos with Lin Ziqin later and share them in the group.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She put away her phone after the event started. The fashion ceremony was organized by the hosts for their own awards, and although the awards were not widely recognized, it didn't matter much to the celebrities. After all, walking the red carpet itself was already a great exposure. The event didn't last long, and when it ended, Zheng Baozhu left with the emcee.The event took place at a hotel, and there were still many reporters waiting outside, seemingly preparing to interview the celebrities when they came out.Sun Jing was one of those who got surrounded.When Zheng Baozhu came out, she saw Sun Jing in the middle of a group of reporters. She took a glance but didn't plan to stay for long. She put on her coat and was about to leave when she heard Sun Jing let out a low cry.Zheng Baozhu turned back to look, Sun Jing was wearing a fitted floor-length dress today. She looked like she didn't expect the reporters to surround her, causing one of her feet to accidentally step on the dress's hem. The dress was already low-cut, and with that step, it almost exposed more than it should have. Sun Jing's quick reflexes saved the day; she immediately pulled up the neckline and blocked the front with her hand.The reporters who had been bombarding Sun Jing with questions were now taking pictures of the situation. Sun Jing kept trying to block the shots, asking them not to take pictures, but who would listen at a time like this?Zheng Baozhu didn't know where Sun Jing's staff had disappeared at this moment; they should have come out to help. Zheng Baozhu walked over to the front of the group of reporters, took off her coat, and covered Sun Jing with it.\"Do you have any professional ethics? Why are you taking photos of a celebrity like this?\" Zheng Baozhu looked at the group of reporters and said, \"I told you to stop taking pictures, can't you hear me?\"The reporters were taken aback for a moment, then they continued taking photos. One male reporter even tried to justify himself in a seemingly innocent manner, \"Isn't she the one intentionally trying to show everything just now? We're just doing our job.\"Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but laugh at their shameless excuse, \"So you're helping her by taking pictures then? How about I also show everything?\"Sun Jing never expected that Zheng Baozhu would be the one to shield her at this moment.The male reporter, who was scolded by Zheng Baozhu, wasn't backing down and started sowing discord, \"Didn't you have a conflict with Sun Jing? Why are you helping her now? Are you trying to gain some popularity?\"He saw Zheng Baozhu's dress was backless, so he targeted her back, insulting her however he pleased.\"Excuse me, please step aside,\" Qu Zhi's voice suddenly came from the front, and before Zheng Baozhu could react, a piece of warm clothing was already draped over her shoulders. She looked up in a daze at Qu Zhi, who had appeared out of nowhere.How did he end up here? Did he come after she shared her location just now?Before Zheng Baozhu could fully process the situation, Qu Zhi protected her from the surrounding reporters, leading her out. Sun Jing's manager hurriedly came over at this moment and, along with a few assistants, escorted them away.Zheng Baozhu's assistant quickly caught up with Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi, guiding them to the waiting car outside. Qu Zhi held Zheng Baozhu's hand and helped her get into the car, closing the door beside her.The driver immediately drove the car away from the blinding flashes of cameras. Zheng Baozhu's emotions gradually calmed down. Qu Zhi's hand was still holding hers, and she glanced at their joined hands, asking him, \"How did you end up here?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"I came here to find you.\"\"But how did you manage to get into the hotel? Didn't the security stop you?\"\"They did,\" Qu Zhi said, looking at her, \"I told them I am from your studio, and they let me in.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu was slightly speechless, \"It was that easy?\"\"Yeah.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu continued to scrutinize him; his appearance indeed made it easy for him to blend in among male celebrities.Even though they finished their conversation, Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi still held each other's hands. Seeing this, Zhou Xiaonan raised her eyebrows and asked Zheng Baozhu, \"What just happened?\"Zheng Baozhu explained, \"Sun Jing stepped on her dress and almost exposed herself. The reporters started taking photos of it. I don't know where her staff went; they disappeared at a crucial moment.\"Zhou Xiaonan: \"...\"Does this mean they will get scolded together?Sighing, Zhou Xiaonan said, \"It's definitely going to trend on social media. Who knows, it might even involve you too.\"Zheng Baozhu scoffed, \"Let it trend then. I'm not afraid of anyone. There was one male reporter who was particularly disgusting, doing vile things and then blaming others for it. It's really ridiculous.\"Zhou Xiaonan replied, \"Well, there's no use worrying anymore. You go rest for now. I'll keep an eye on the trending topics, and I'll react promptly if anything comes up.\"\"Okay.\"Zhou Xiaonan's gaze then fell on Qu Zhi and circled around him a few times. She asked, \"This handsome guy is...\"\"Oh, I forgot to introduce him,\" Zheng Baozhu said, \"He's my old classmate.\"\"Just an old classmate?\" Zhou Xiaonan hinted, looking at their hands still held together.Zheng Baozhu finally realized what she meant and quickly withdrew her hand, \"He really is just an old classmate.\"\"Okay,\" Zhou Xiaonan didn't press further, \"Boss Zheng, you're the boss of the studio, so who you date is none of my business. Besides, I never said you couldn't date anyone.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Didn't I already say he's just an old classmate!Zhou Xiaonan smiled at Qu Zhi, \"Where do you live? We can drop you off on the way.\"Qu Zhi replied, \"No need, I live with Zheng Baozhu.\"Zhou Xiaonan: \"???\"Well, this is redefining the term \"old classmate\", isn't it?\"No, no, don't misunderstand. He stays at my hotel,\" Zheng Baozhu tried to explain, \"It's not what you're thinking.\"Zhou Xiaonan defended herself, \"I didn't think anything. Why are you getting all defensive?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Can employees be this sassy with their boss now? :)After arriving at the Starlight Farm, Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi got out of the car together. Zheng Baozhu was still wearing Qu Zhi's coat, while Qu Zhi only had a shirt on, seemingly unprepared for the cold night wind.\"Are you cold?\" Zheng Baozhu asked Qu Zhi, looking up at him.Qu Zhi replied, \"It's just a few steps; I'm not cold.\"\"Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded and walked into the hotel with him. Instead of going directly to his room, Qu Zhi accompanied Zheng Baozhu back to her room. He poured a cup of hot milk for her.Zheng Baozhu was changing her clothes inside the room when Qu Zhi called from the direction of the bedroom, \"After changing, come out and have the milk.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu responded from inside the room and came out wearing pajamas shortly after. Her hair was also let down, casually draped over her shoulders. She sat on the couch wearing slippers and held the glass, taking a big sip of milk, feeling much better, \"Ah, it's so warm. My stomach was actually hurting a bit earlier, but now it feels much better.\"Qu Zhi sat next to her and observed, \"Then finish the milk.\"\"Mm,\" Zheng Baozhu agreed and gulped down the milk. When she finished, Qu Zhi spoke, \"I remember you had some conflicts with Sun Jing. Why did you still help her?\"Zheng Baozhu retorted, \"Those are two different things. I can't just stand by when I see a female celebrity facing trouble, right? Don't you know those reporters? They really have no sense of respect. Some even said it was intentional to attract attention. It made me laugh. Couldn't they see that Sun Jing was trying to cover herself with her hand? Even after being told to stop, they kept taking pictures.\"After hearing her, Qu Zhi lightly chuckled, \"You always have such a kind heart.\"\"Well, of course. Besides, Sun Jing and I don't have any deep grudges or hatred,\" Zheng Baozhu said, \"If it were me in that situation, I'd hope someone would help me too. I just don't know how they'll twist the story this time.\"Thinking about it, Zheng Baozhu furrowed her brows.Qu Zhi reassured her, \"You've already done a lot. Not everyone has the courage to step in and help.\"He looked at Zheng Baozhu with a gaze she had never seen before and said, \"You're brave, kind, and likable.\"As Zheng Baozhu was about to nod in response, she suddenly froze when she heard what he said at the end, \"What did you say?\"Qu Zhi leaned closer, gently kissed away the milk mustache on her upper lip, and whispered, \"I said, I like you.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Most men liked her for her beauty, but Qu Zhi was the first one to say that she was brave, kind, and likable.Zheng Baozhu's mind was already in a daze, and after Qu Zhi kissed her, her mind seemed to stop working altogether. His kiss was so light and gentle, and even his voice was soft, but when it landed on Zheng Baozhu, it sent a direct impact to her heart.Breathing suddenly became difficult.Qu Zhi's kiss was brief and he didn't put much distance between them afterward. He slightly lifted his gaze, as if waiting for something. Zheng Baozhu's eyes gradually focused again as she regained control of her breath.A wave of heat rushed to her head, Zheng Baozhu felt her cheeks and ears turn red. With Qu Zhi's presence surrounding her, her heartbeat accelerated uncontrollably. Trying to steady herself, she looked at Qu Zhi's enlarged handsome face and asked, \"Are you confessing to me?\"\"Yes,\" Qu Zhi answered without hesitation.Zheng Baozhu was stunned again, \"Didn't you used to dislike me a lot?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"Didn't you also dislike me before? If I had kissed you back then, would you have reacted differently?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu reflected on his words and realized that he might be right.Seeing her in silence, Qu Zhi continued, \"I didn't understand you enough before and assumed things about you. I have deeply reflected on that. These days together have allowed me to see a different side of you, and I've discovered many likable qualities in you...\"Zheng Baozhu interrupted him, \"Brave and kind?\"\"Yes.\"\"So you think I'm not beautiful?\"\"...\"Qu Zhi paused for a moment, then gently brushed aside the strands of her long hair, \"Before, I thought you were just beautiful, but now I know you have many qualities that are more attractive than just being beautiful. You are intelligent, determined, and committed to your ideals. No matter how many difficulties you face, they can't bring you down. You also have a precious sense of compassion and won't turn a blind eye to others' suffering. In your childhood composition, you wrote that you wished to shine like Su Mingmei, I think you already do. In my eyes, you shine brighter than any gem.\"Zheng Baozhu's eyes became slightly teary, overwhelmed by his words.She finally got to witness the true power of an \"A\" composition. It turns out that Teacher Zhang's grading had reasonable grounds.\"I, I'm not as great as you say,\" Zheng Baozhu bashfully averted her gaze, not daring to meet his deep and affectionate eyes.Qu Zhi gently hooked his finger and tucked her black hair behind her ear, revealing her flushed ear. He deliberately leaned closer to her ear and whispered softly, \"What I said is not even one-thousandth of how good you are.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Help! The science-loving straight-A guy is killing people with sweetness!Qu Zhi then kissed her again on her already reddened ear and asked, \"So, Zheng Baozhu, do you accept my confession?\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu took a deep breath, trying to calm her wildly beating heart, \"It's, it's okay, I guess.\"Qu Zhi chuckled softly and was about to say something, but Zheng Baozhu's phone on the table started vibrating incessantly. Qu Zhi turned to look at it when Zheng Baozhu took the opportunity to pick up her phone.Zhou Xiaonan had sent her several messages, all with screenshots from Weibo. As expected, the incident where Sun Jing almost exposed herself at the fashion event was trending, with marketing accounts insinuating that it was a deliberate act for attention. Although they added a question mark at the end, anyone with a discerning eye could understand their intention.The previously disinterested onlookers who didn't follow the fashion event were now drawn in by this trending topic, analyzing and commenting on the photos. While Sun Jing's reputation wasn't excellent, she couldn't handle the influx of negative comments.Zhou Xiaonan: You are also on the trending list, congratulations. [Zheng Baozhu slammed the reporters].Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Zheng Baozhu clicked on the Weibo link. Her trending topic was listed just two spots below Sun Jing's. There was a video snippet from the scene, showing Zheng Baozhu questioning the reporters about their professional ethics.This trending topic couldn't be classified as a \"black\" trending topic because it was related to Sun Jing's incident, and the truth would be quickly revealed. Netizens praised Zheng Baozhu's righteousness and criticized those who harassed Sun Jing, but some had a different perspective, accusing her of using Sun Jing's \"misfortune\" to gain attention.Zheng Baozhu had long witnessed the diverse opinions of netizens, so she wasn't surprised by the comments. She had considered responding, but then decided against it, realizing that it would bring up the incident with Sun Jing again.Fortunately, Sun Jing's team was actively mitigating the trending topic and even sent a lawyer's letter to the male reporter who kept harassing her. Whether it was the team's public relations strategy or not, Sun Jing's Weibo post redirected the discussion to the topics of \"respect\" and \"not tolerating offense\", garnering more support from the online community.Zheng Baozhu's popularity also surged as a result.It seemed that doing good deeds could indeed bring good results.Qu Zhi also sat next to her, reading Weibo on his own account. He had registered on Weibo early on but seldom used it, mostly for reading news. However, lately, he spent more time on Weibo, all thanks to being associated with Zheng Baozhu, the celebrity.\"You and Lin Ziqin are also trending,\" Qu Zhi said as he clicked on a candid picture taken at the event. In the photo, Lin Ziqin was turning back, talking to Zheng Baozhu with a smile in his eyes, \"You two seem to be having a great time chatting, and you already have a CP!\"Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment, glancing at Qu Zhi's phone screen, \"Um, well, I just thanked him for sending me the signed photos. These pictures have all been edited with filters, don't believe them!\"\"Oh, is that so?\"\"Yes, and we are not really a CP. He doesn't agree with it either. These CP rumors will be debunked soon!\"\"...I think it's you who will be debunked,\" Qu Zhi pointed at a Weibo post, \"Lin Ziqin's fan club has already publicly stated that they won't support certain artists who use him to create CP. Guess who these certain artists are?\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"\"Too presumptuous!\" Zheng Baozhu tapped on her screen a few times, then showed it to Qu Zhi, \"Look, the moment you escorted me away tonight was also captured by the photographers! These pictures are even better edited than Lin Ziqin's, right? We also have a CP now!\"\"...\"Qu Zhi looked at the edited collage. Zheng Baozhu had his coat on her while he was holding her hand, shielding her from the reporters as they walked out together.It had a caption too, \"Even if the world is against you, I will take you away without hesitation.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Perfect.Zhou Xiaonan sent Zheng Baozhu another message, \"You're amazing.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"?\"Zhou Xiaonan sent three trending CP pairs; one of them was Zheng Baozhu-Sun Jing, portrayed as a \"yuri\" couple.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Seems like netizens really don't discriminate; they can ship anything.Zheng Baozhu: I had a chaotic evening. How about I post my red carpet photos tomorrow?Zhou Xiaonan: Tomorrow might be a bit awkward. How about posting them at midnight tonight? Though the traffic won't be as good as it is now, your popularity is already enough for today.Zheng Baozhu: ...Alright.Qu Zhi checked the time and stood up, saying to Zheng Baozhu, \"It's already late. You must be tired. Rest early. I'll head back now.\"\"Oh, okay,\" Zheng Baozhu stood up as well and walked with him to the door, \"Wait, you forgot your coat.\"Zheng Baozhu hurried back to her room and brought out the coat that Qu Zhi had left behind. Qu Zhi took the coat from her hand and thanked her.Zheng Baozhu smiled and said, \"You're welcome.\"When Qu Zhi was about to leave, she stopped him, \"Qu Zhi!\"\"Uh?\" Just as Qu Zhi turned his head, Zheng Baozhu stood on tiptoe, circled her arms around his neck, and quickly kissed him on the cheek.Qu Zhi was momentarily stunned, and before he could react, Zheng Baozhu said \"Goodnight\" and closed the door, retreating to her room.Leaning against the door, Zheng Baozhu's heart was still pounding. Ahhh, I just kissed him!Although she ran off after the kiss, it could be considered a response to his feelings, right?She used the cool back of her hand to touch her flushed face and put her phone, which was on the table, against her face to cool down. The phone vibrated again. Worried that it might be another issue on Weibo, she hurriedly checked the notification.This time, it was from Qu Zhi.Qu Zhi: What do you mean by kissing and running?Zheng Baozhu:Qu Zhi: Turns out Zheng Baozhu can be mischievous too.Zheng Baozhu:Outside the door, Qu Zhi chuckled as he looked at her smiling face. Another message from Zheng Baozhu came in.Zheng Baozhu: It means; 'Goodnight, boyfriend'. Understand, straight man?Qu Zhi's lips curled up a bit. He hadn't noticed before, but it seemed Zheng Baozhu had a playful side.He replied to her with a voice message, and when Zheng Baozhu opened the message, she heard Qu Zhi's magnetic voice flowing from the speaker, \"Understood, girlfriend.\"Zheng Baozhu's heart had been restless all evening. If there was really a little deer inside her heart, it would have probably bumped itself to death by now. She replayed Qu Zhi's voice message repeatedly and then went to a private group chat to send a large red envelope.Even at this late hour, people in the group immediately responded when they saw the red envelope.Meng Yaxin: Yay! I'm the first!Cen Tongtong: What's the use of being the first? I have more than you.Meng Yaxin: Baozhu must be tired from trending tonight. She even came to send a red envelope to celebrate.Zheng Baozhu: No, it's not about trending. This red envelope is my goodbye to singlehood.Meng Yaxin: !!!Just as she sent the exclamation mark, Qu Zhi also sent a red envelope in the group.Qu Zhi: Goodbye to singlehood red envelope.Meng Yaxin: ??? You two?Qu Zhi: Exactly what you're thinking.Cen Tongtong: ............I'll return the red envelope to you both. Can you please go back to being single?Meng Yaxin: Hahahahahaha! Tongtong, when are you going to live-stream yourself eating the keyboards? Remember to share the link in the group.Cen Tongtong didn't respond.Meng Yaxin: @Cen Tongtong, come outside, stop pretending to be dead.Finally, Meng Yaxin managed to get Cen Tongtong to respond.Cen Tongtong: Thanks for the invitation, but I already threw all the keyboards in the house outside.Cen Tongtong: @Zheng Baozhu @Qu Zhi, I just want to ask, did both of you make such a big sacrifice just to see me eat the keyboards? You really didn't have to.Qu Zhi: Of course, it's because we like each other.Cen Tongtong: ............Meng Yaxin: I've already screenshot their conversation just now and sent it to the CP fans group next door. We're starting the Lunar New Year again.Meng Yaxin: In this group, I suggest that either Baozhu or Quzhi should stay, because I don't want to eat dog food every day.Qu Zhi: I suggest you leave this group.Meng Yaxin: ............Cen Tongtong: Hahahahaha, serves you right.Meng Yaxin: @Cen Tongtong, I'll send you a keyboard tomorrow.At this point, Zheng Baozhu was already lying in bed. She checked Weibo and saw that the studio had already posted the red carpet photos. Even at this late hour, there were still fans leaving sweet comments. As soon as she reposted the Weibo post, she received a message from Qu Zhi.Qu Zhi: Still browsing Weibo this late, haven't slept yet?Zheng Baozhu: ...Aren't you also peeking at the screen all the time?Qu Zhi: I'm not peeking, I'm openly looking.Qu Zhi: Since you have reposted it, go to sleep. Do you have any work tomorrow?Zheng Baozhu: Not for the time being.Qu Zhi: Then let's have breakfast together?Zheng Baozhu: Sure!Qu Zhi smiled and replied, \"I'll call you tomorrow morning.\"For some reason, even though they were just cold text on the screen, Zheng Baozhu could imagine Qu Zhi's voice and expression when he wrote those words. Thinking that, she couldn't stop smiling.It's amazing how, even after knowing Qu Zhi for so many years, she could still feel this way. Is this the effect of being childhood sweethearts? It feels familiar yet fresh at the same time.Speaking of which, it's been so long since they reunited, but she hasn't asked how Qu Zhi spent all these years abroad.With thoughts of Qu Zhi on her mind, she fell asleep. The next morning, she was awakened by a call from Qu Zhi.Seeing the caller ID on her phone, Zheng Baozhu's mind was still a bit fuzzy, and she sleepily answered, \"Hello...\"\"Still not awake?\" Qu Zhi's voice came from the other end of the phone, \"Get up, freshen up, and let's go downstairs for breakfast.\"Zheng Baozhu suddenly became alert and sat up in bed, \"Oh, okay, I'll be right there!\"She hung up the phone and quickly changed her clothes and freshened up before heading out. As soon as she opened the door, she saw Qu Zhi leaning against the corridor, waiting for her. When he saw her, Qu Zhi stood up straight and smiled at her.He looked so handsome when he smiled that Zheng Baozhu's face started to blush again. Clearing her throat, she closed the door behind her and asked, \"Why are you waiting for me here?\"Qu Zhi thought for a moment and looked at her, \"Next time, remember to invite me to your room.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"After a moment of silence, she walked with Qu Zhi toward the elevator, \"Are you really a science student? Why are you so good at sweet-talking?\"\"Sweet-talking?\" Qu Zhi looked at her and said, \"Those are all sincere words I said when facing you.\"\"...\"Oh no, she can't mock this hardcore straight science guy anymore.\"I guess you must have a lot of experience from your time studying, right?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"When we were studying, weren't we always together?\"\"What do you mean by that? You were abroad for so many years and we had no contact,\" Zheng Baozhu said as they walked side by side into the elevator, \"How did you spend those years abroad? Tell me.\"Qu Zhi asked, \"What do you want to hear?\"\"Well...\" Zheng Baozhu pretended to think for a moment, \"For example, your love life or the girls you liked.\"Qu Zhi glanced at her and chuckled, \"Are you already trying to dig into my past relationships?\"\"Wow, you have past relationships?\" Zheng Baozhu teased.\"...\"Qu Zhi touched his neatly combed hair, seemingly satisfied with it, \"What past relationships could I have? You know my biggest love is for our motherland.\"\"Hahaha!\" Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but laugh.Qu Zhi held her hand as they walked out of the elevator together. Along the way, the staff they encountered all looked at them with ambiguous eyes and the slight upturn at the corners of their lips seemed like proud mothers.\"They must all know!\" Zheng Baozhu now suspected that all the hotel staff must have joined that CP fan group!Qu Zhi didn't seem to mind, \"Let them know if they want to. Or do you want us to keep it a secret?\"\"...\"Keeping it a secret sounds a bit exciting too. Taking out two masks, she handed one to Qu Zhi, \"Let's test how it feels to be secretly together with a celebrity.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySince Zheng Baozhu was now a celebrity who had appeared in many trending topics, she started wearing a mask even in her own restaurant and would often sit in a private room for breakfast.The breakfast in the restaurant was originally buffet-style, but they ordered from the menu. Liang Huihui knew their preferences well and brought their favorite dishes directly to them, saying, \"Miss Baozhu, Mr. Qu, I've brought your breakfast over!\"\"Thank you,\" Zheng Baozhu replied while taking off her mask. As she lowered her head, she saw a heart-shaped steamed egg placed in front of them by Liang Huihui.Zheng Baozhu fell silent for a moment, but Liang Huihui took the initiative to explain, \"This heart-shaped steamed egg was specially made by Chef Liao for you and Mr. Qu. It's a heart shape! Isn't it adorable?\"Liang Huihui said as she made a big heart gesture with her hands towards Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She was very grateful that they were sitting in a private room.\"Wishing Miss Baozhu and Mr. Qu a sweet and happy relationship!\" After giving her blessings, Liang Huihui walked away with a smile.\"...\"Zheng Baozhu smiled awkwardly at Qu Zhi, \"Haha, Huihui has been preparing for exams recently, maybe she's a bit stressed.\"Qu Zhi looked at her and smiled. He picked up the silver spoon placed next to the steamed egg and said, \"I think it's nice.\"Zheng Baozhu followed, \"I think you're nice too.\"Qu Zhi paused for a moment as he held the spoon, then smiled slightly and scooped a spoonful of steamed egg to offer it to Zheng Baozhu, \"No one has praised me like this since I graduated from primary school. Thank you.\"Zheng Baozhu opened her mouth and ate the spoonful of steamed egg he fed her. Then she looked at him and said, \"It seems a little sweeter than usual. Did Chef Liao intentionally make a sweeter version?\"After all, it was even shaped like a heart.Qu Zhi scooped another spoonful of steamed egg and offered it to himself, \"Maybe it's because I'm sweeter.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu wanted to tease him, but when she saw him using the same spoon to eat the steamed egg, she changed her mind, \"That spoon was used by me!\"Qu Zhi nodded calmly, \"I know.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu pointed to the other spoon on the table, \"There's another one right there!\"Qu Zhi finished the steamed egg and looked at her, \"It does seem a bit sweeter than usual. It seems you're the sweet one.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Blushing, she turned her head away and continued to eat her breakfast.Qu Zhi had to go to work at the company. Since Zheng Baozhu had delayed him for a while, he ate a simple breakfast and stood up from the table, \"I should leave now. Take your time eating, don't rush.\"\"Huh?\" Zheng Baozhu glanced at her phone screen to check the time and realized it was indeed not early anymore. She put down what she was holding and said to Qu Zhi, \"How about I drive you to the company? It will be faster, and you can eat a bit more!\"Qu Zhi smiled, bent down, and kissed Zheng Baozhu's forehead, \"I've had enough, thanks for your hospitality.\"Zheng Baozhu froze in place.Qu Zhi still had a smile in his eyes and added, \"Eat a little more, don't rush. I'll be going now.\"Zheng Baozhu watched him leave the private room, her cheeks still flushed....This can't go on! Just a simple kiss on the forehead could make her blush. How is she going to handle things in the future?...No, it can't be like that!Zheng Baozhu picked up the slightly cool lemon water in front of her and drank a few sips to cool herself down.Qu Zhi usually arrived at the company first, but today, when he swiped his card, Qi Sheng was already inside. Upon seeing Qu Zhi coming in, Qi Sheng couldn't help but ask, \"Old Qu, what did you do last night? Why are you coming in so late today?\"Qu Zhi casually replied, \"Late? There's still some time before being late.\"\"Compared to your usual time, it's late!\" Qi Sheng stood up, approached him, and his tone turned ambiguous, \"We're both old friends, you don't need to hide it from me. I saw the trending topics last night; you spent the whole night with Miss Baozhu, didn't you?\"\"...\"Qu Zhi remained silent for a moment, then pulled out a chair and sat down at his usual spot, \"We are indeed together.\"Although Qi Sheng had previously teased him, hearing Qu Zhi admit it himself gave him a new shock, \"What do you mean??\"\"Exactly what it says.\"Qi Sheng looked at him silently for a while and tentatively asked, \"Yesterday, I saw online that you are part of Zheng Baozhu's studio. Since when did you become a member of her studio?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"As the boyfriend of the studio's boss, I can indeed be considered part of the studio.\"\"...\"So, was it indeed what he thought? Qu Zhi has confirmed it now!\"Old Qu... You and Miss Baozhu are in a relationship now?\" Qi Sheng asked, surprised.Qu Zhi looked at him with a frown, \"We've been talking about this for so long, yet you're just figuring it out?\"\"...\"Qi Sheng wiped his face. Although he had noticed that something was going on between the two of them early on, he couldn't digest the fact that they were actually together. While he was wiping his face, he saw Professor Luo, who had silver hair, walk in.Qi Sheng immediately stopped Professor Luo and said, \"Professor Luo, have you heard? Qu Zhi is in a relationship now!\"Professor Luo's smooth strides paused for a moment, then he looked at them, \"Qu Zhi is in a relationship?\"\"Yes!\" Qi Sheng was even more proactive in answering than Qu Zhi.\"Alright,\" Professor Luo only paused briefly and nodded, \"Qu Zhi is at an age where it's about time. He can't stay cooped up in the laboratory all day long. It's time for him to have a relationship.\"Qu Zhi then added, \"Thank you, Professor Luo.\"Qu Zhi had always been highly regarded by Professor Luo. Now that he heard about the relationship, he was curious about Qu Zhi's partner, \"What kind of girl is she?\"\"She's very beautiful!\" Qi Sheng was attentive and walked over with his phone, \"I have some photos here. Let me show you.\"Professor Luo adjusted his glasses and looked at the enlarged photo Qi Sheng showed him, \"Hmm, this girl is indeed beautiful. She looks a bit like that celebrity, Su Mingmei.\"Qi Sheng looked surprised, \"You know Su Mingmei?\"Professor Luo chuckled, \"What's so surprising about that? Do you know how popular Su Mingmei was back then? Her movies were playing in cinemas across the country, her posters filled all the stationery stores near schools.\"\"Oh, I was being presumptuous.\"Professor Luo glanced at him, \"However, why do you have pictures of her if she's Qu Zhi's girlfriend?\"\"I saved them from the internet!\" Qi Sheng hurriedly defended himself, \"This Miss Baozhu is also a celebrity!\"\"Oh?\" Professor Luo listened to him and looked at the photos on the phone again, \"No wonder she's so beautiful.\"He said that while looking at Qu Zhi and suddenly realizing something, \"No wonder when Professor Wang from the courtyard said he wanted to introduce you to someone, you rejected it without even considering. So, it turned out you were interested in a celebrity. Your standards are high.\"Qu Zhi smiled and explained, \"You misunderstood, Professor Luo. Baozhu and I grew up together since we were children.\"Professor Luo paused for a moment, then nodded, \"Alright, forget about Professor Wang's idea then. This excellent little seedling has been set since childhood.\"Zheng Baozhu had just finished her breakfast leisurely and returned to her room, wearing a mask again. As soon as she sat on the sofa, she received a friend request on WeChat. Zheng Baozhu clicked on it, and the verification message from the other person was \"I am Sun Jing\".Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She didn't know how Sun Jing got her WeChat ID, but after thinking for a couple of seconds, she decided to add her as a friend.After adding her as a friend, Sun Jing sent a message: Your coat is still with me. Give me your address, and I'll have someone deliver it to you.Zheng Baozhu suddenly realized that Sun Jing wanted to return the clothing.Feeling relieved, she sent her studio's address to Sun Jing. After that, Sun Jing didn't say anything else, and Zheng Baozhu didn't initiate any conversation either. During this time, due to work, she hadn't been going to Teacher Ge's place on a fixed schedule every Tuesday. She went there whenever she had time. Today, as there didn't seem to be any work-related issues, she called Teacher Ge to confirm his availability and then prepared to go to the class.In the afternoon, Sun Jing had the coat delivered to Zheng Baozhu's studio. Zheng Baozhu instructed the front desk to put the coat in the office. She would pick it up the next time she went to the studio.She didn't know where her mother heard it from, but while she was in class, her mother called and asked if she was in a relationship with Qu Zhi.Zheng Baozhu sighed and asked, \"Who told you that?\"Su Mingxi happily said, \"Cen Tongtong. She said that you and Qu Zhi announced your relationship in the group chat last night and even gave out red envelopes!\"\"...\"How dare Cen Tongtong tattle to her mom before she could feed her the keyboards! Does she want her mom to scold them like they did something wrong?Cen Tongtong was going to great lengths to avoid eating her keyboards!\"Mom, we are indeed together. If you object...\"\"Why should I object?\"\"...\"This question left Zheng Baozhu speechless. Right, why would her mom object? Her mom has liked Qu Zhi since they were kids!\"I'm not saying you would object. I was just saying if...\"\"There are no ifs. You should be with Qu Zhi properly,\" Su Mingxi interrupted her, \"He already expressed his feelings to us before... He told us that he likes you and will always be with you, so we don't need to worry about your acting career. Qu Zhi is someone we've seen growing up. We understand him, and when he said that, it gave us peace of mind.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu fell silent for a long time, \"When did this happen?\"\"When you delivered the wheelchair to your grandma,\" Su Mingxi thought since they were already together, she might as well tell her about the past, \"At that time, Qu Zhi said he hadn't confessed to you yet and asked us not to tell you. He said he wanted to find the right opportunity to tell you.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"So he was fooling around behind her back at that time?After Su Mingxi finished telling Zheng Baozhu, she curiously asked her, \"So what suitable opportunity has he found? Was it last night? Your dad and I saw your photos trending on Weibo.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Since her mom learned how to use Weibo, she felt she had no privacy in front of her. :)\"Those reporters were really bad, but you did the right thing yesterday,\" Su Mingxi continued, \"What did I say? Qu Zhi is reliable. When he says he'll be with you, he really means it. Look at last night's situation; he protected you from the reporters, right?\"Zheng Baozhu suddenly paused. She did not think much about it before, but now, after her mom mentioned it, a warm feeling welled up in her heart.Qu Zhi didn't say anything, and last night, he only asked where she was and went straight there. He didn't know what would happen afterward; he just wanted to be with her, to be closer.Just like he promised.\"Alright, I won't delay you anymore. Next time you have free time, bring Qu Zhi to visit your grandma and have a meal together. She really misses you both.\"\"Oh... alright,\" After hanging up the phone, Zheng Baozhu sheepishly told Ge Hongyi, \"It was my mom. She wanted to talk about some family matters.\"Ge Hongyi had been sitting there the whole time and had caught the general idea from the snippets of the conversation, \"Baozhu, are you together with that young man from last time?\"Zheng Baozhu didn't expect that even someone as dignified as Ge Laoshi would be interested in gossip, \"Yes, we just got together.\"Ge Hongyi nodded with a smile, showing a hint of approval on his face, \"That young man is not bad. Although I'm getting old, I'm still quite accurate in reading people. I feel relieved if you are with him.\"As an elder, Ge Hongyi couldn't help teasing Zheng Baozhu about such matters, which made her feel a little embarrassed, \"Teacher Ge, please don't join in with my mom to tease me.\"\"Alright,\" Ge Hongyi smiled kindly, \"You young people are sensitive about such things. I won't say anything more. We're almost done for today. You already have a good grasp of that role; just think it through by yourself.\"Zheng Baozhu had come to talk to him specifically about the role of the new drama. During this period, she had been reading the script and encountered some issues in understanding the character. Today, Ge Hongyi explained it in detail to her. Every time she listened to his lectures, Zheng Baozhu felt like a lightbulb would turn on in her mind. Of course, as Teacher Ge said, she still needed to practice and ponder more, learning to integrate and connect everything.After leaving Teacher Ge's place, Zheng Baozhu went straight back to her hotel. She had planned to have dinner with Qu Zhi tonight. Just like before, she had already pre-ordered the dishes, and the kitchen would deliver them to her room.Then, she would personally pick up Qu Zhi from his company after he finished work.Qi Sheng noticed that Qu Zhi hadn't been enthusiastic about overtime during this period!\"Old Qu, you are leaving working on time today also?\" Qi Sheng and Qu Zhi were both swiping their faces in front of the attendance machine, walking out of the company together, \"As expected, being in a relationship really leads to moral decline!!\"Qu Zhi glanced at him sideways, \"Moral decline sounds good, but unfortunately, you'll never experience it.\"\"Goodbye.\"Qu Zhi not only turned toxic but also sarcastic! Qi Sheng simply didn't want to stay in the same space with him for even a second!Just as Qi Sheng finished sweeping the shared bike, he saw a familiar car approaching.The car stopped in front of Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu's face slowly emerged from the lowered car window, \"I'm here to pick you up after work!\"Qi Sheng: \"...\"Why did he have to witness this scene? If only he had left a little earlier, he could have avoided this disaster!He turned around indignantly and looked at Qu Zhi, \"Old Qu, you even have your girlfriend coming to pick you up after work. I look down on you!\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"I came here on my own accord, hehe!\"Qi Sheng: \"...\"Miss Baozhu, could you have a bit of awareness as a rich woman! And you are a celebrity now!What qualifications does Qu Zhi have!\"Miss Baozhu, let me tell you, men cannot be pampered. They like it when women are indifferent to them. That's the only way they feel challenged and get the thrill of conquest. If you're too good to them, they will only think you're not a challenge!\"\"Is that so?\" Zheng Baozhu pondered seriously.\"Don't listen to his nonsense,\" Qu Zhi glanced at Qi Sheng and opened the passenger door, sitting inside, \"I think he's just overworked. Tomorrow, I'll talk to Professor Luo and have him share some of my workload so that I can have dinner with you every night.\"Zheng Baozhu happily said, \"Great!\"Qi Sheng: \"???\"Is this even a human thing to do?Bastard. :)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 64": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Science and Technology Park is very close to the Starlight Farm, it only takes a few minutes to drive there. Qu Zhi sat in the passenger seat and turned his head\u00a0to look at Zheng Baozhu beside him, \"Why did you think of coming to pick me up after work?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"I just felt like coming.\"Qu Zhi chuckled and said, \"Although I don't mind having dinner together, you don't need to come in person from now on. Just wait for me at home.\"Zheng Baozhu glanced at him and made a left turn at the previous intersection, \"If I'm out filming in the future, I won't have time to pick you up even if you want me to.\"Qu Zhi thought that what she said was not wrong and changed his statement, \"Then should I still wait for you at this time tomorrow?\"\"Hahaha,\" Zheng Baozhu laughed as the car continued on its way. Before the song in the car finished, they had already arrived near the hotel. Zheng Baozhu parked the car in the garage, unfastened her seatbelt, and asked Qu Zhi, \"But if I go to pick you up every day, will it affect you?\"Qu Zhi also unfastened his seatbelt and looked at her, \"It won't affect me much, but it might affect the mental health of my colleagues.\"\"Ha!\" Zheng Baozhu chuckled and pretended to think carefully, \"Then maybe I shouldn't pick you up anymore?\"Qu Zhi said, \"That's also fine, but if I miss a meal because of that, how will you compensate me?\"\"Wow, you are a research scientist, yet you are shameless like this,\" Nonetheless, she liked it, \"Alright, then tell me, how would you like to be compensated?\"Qu Zhi thought for a moment, slightly opened his arms, and looked at Zheng Baozhu, \"How about you hug me?\"Zheng Baozhu didn't expect him to make such a request and couldn't help but find it amusing, \"You, a high-end talent who studied abroad, still like to be hugged like a little kid?\"Perhaps Qu Zhi was used to being cold and indifferent, so he didn't change his expression even when Zheng Baozhu mocked him, \"Do you not want to hug me?\"\"No, too weird, hahaha.\"Qu Zhi also raised an eyebrow in response, \"Don't want to hug? I don't like your answer. You have a chance to say it again.\"\"Alright, alright, I'll hug you, I'll hug you,\" Zheng Baozhu leaned over and wrapped her delicate arms around Qu Zhi's lean waist. Her face naturally rested against his chest and she felt the powerful heartbeat resonating from his body.Men's physique and strength were indeed very different from women's. Zheng Baozhu was used to hugging other women, and when she did, she only felt their fragrant scent, but now, hugging Qu Zhi, she could sense his masculine demeanor and strength.Being held in his arms made her feel extremely safe.\"Hugging you feels really good,\" Zheng Baozhu commented. Qu Zhi's soft laughter came from above as he released his arms and embraced Zheng Baozhu, \"Hugging you is not bad either.\"\"Just not bad?\"\"I haven't hugged anyone else, so there's no comparison.\"\"...You can be quite talkative.\"Zheng Baozhu looked up at Qu Zhi, her eyes sparkling with a smile, which made Qu Zhi's heart flutter. Unable to resist, he slightly lifted her chin and leaned down to kiss her.At first, Zheng Baozhu was a bit stiff, but she was soon entranced by Qu Zhi's charm. She couldn't understand why a logical and straightforward guy like him could be so skilled. Was this just a natural instinct of men?While Qu Zhi continued to explore Zheng Baozhu's mouth, she gently pushed him away, and Qu Zhi leaned his forehead against hers, softly asking, \"What's wrong?\"Zheng Baozhu glanced at the wall and said, \"I suddenly remembered that there are surveillance cameras in the garage.\"Qu Zhi fell silent for a moment, then chuckled softly, \"Then let's go back to the room.\"Zheng Baozhu took out two face masks from the car and handed one to Qu Zhi. Qu Zhi didn't really want to wear it and said, \"I'm not a male celebrity; no one knows me.\"Putting on her own mask, Zheng Baozhu looked at him and replied, \"It's not about that. It's just that, right now, my lipstick is all over your lips.\"Qu Zhi looked at his reflection in the rearview mirror and indeed found some lipstick on his lips. He gently wiped it with his thumb, trying to remove it, but instead, the lipstick smeared onto his cheek, making it even more noticeable.Zheng Baozhu watched him from the side and blinked playfully, \"With this look, you're very... suitable. It suits you very well, you know.\"Qu Zhi just quietly glanced at her. Seeing that he didn't say anything, she got even more enthusiastic, \"I have many shades in my room; I can let you try them and see which one suits you best.\"Qu Zhi suddenly leaned closer, his low voice carrying a hint of danger, \"It depends on the method you use to help me try them.\"\"...!\" Zheng Baozhu quickly pushed him away, opened the car door, and escaped from the car. Once she was away from Qu Zhi's presence, she finally let out a long sigh of relief.Sigh, men really can't handle teasing.Qu Zhi put on the mask and got off the car. They returned to Zheng Baozhu's room and tidied up a bit before sitting down to have dinner. Zheng Baozhu held her bowl and ate while scrolling through Weibo to keep up with the industry trends.Qu Zhi watched from across the table, \"Don't use your phone while eating.\"\"Okay, okay,\" Zheng Baozhu lifted her head and smiled at Qu Zhi, \"It's fine for me to look at you, you're much better-looking than my phone.\"Qu Zhi nodded, \"That's the truth.\"Zheng Baozhu silently mocked him in her heart as her phone vibrated again. She looked down and saw a message from Meng Yaxin, \"It's Meng Yaxin, could be something important.\"Opening the message, she saw that Meng Yaxin had sent an electronic invitation.Meng Yaxin: Wei Yu is having his wedding at the Deinu Grand Hotel next Saturday. Will you and Qu Zhi come?Meng Yaxin: They asked me to check with you, thinking that you might be 'sensitive' about it.Meng Yaxin: Li Huixin has been hinting about it in our group chat, after all, there were rumors that Wei Yu was the man you couldn't get.Zheng Baozhu: ...Ugh!!Meng Yaxin: Hahaha, don't be angry. After all, you have Qu Zhi.\u00a0 I suggest you both go; you can either enjoy yourselves or mock them.Zheng Baozhu: I'll ask Qu Zhi.She raised her eyes and looked at Qu Zhi sitting across from her, \"Meng Yaxin said that Wei Yu will have his wedding next Saturday. They asked if we want to go.\"Qu Zhi replied, \"I don't mind. Are you available that day? If you want to go, I'll accompany you.\"\"I'm not sure right now, so I'll tell them we're not sure yet,\" Zheng Baozhu replied to Meng Yaxin's message and then stopped paying attention to her phone, \"Time flies so fast; our high school classmates are already getting married.\"\"Because they are older than you,\" Qu Zhi remarked.\"...Yeah, that's true. After all, I started high school at the age of fourteen.\"\"Wasn't Wei Yu the man Li Huixin mentioned, the one who rejected your love letter?\" Qu Zhi suddenly asked, causing Zheng Baozhu to almost choke on her food.\"Cough, I told you last time; he was the one who wrote me a letter, and I rejected him, but then he turned the situation around!\"\"Yeah, it's clear he's got a thick skin,\" Qu Zhi's voice revealed no emotions, \"After doing such a thing, he still has the face to invite you to his wedding and ask you for a wedding gift.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Gosh, thinking about it, attending his wedding is such a loss!\"But if I don't go, will everyone assume that I had a secret crush on him, that's why I couldn't attend his wedding?\" Zheng Baozhu thought more and felt it could be possible, \"No, although I couldn't clarify them back then, I can't let the rumors spread again! I want to show them that Wei Yu is beyond my reach!\"Qu Zhi sat across from her and watched for a while before he couldn't help but burst into laughter. Zheng Baozhu saw him shaking with laughter and kicked him under the table, \"What are you laughing at? Am I wrong?\"\"You're right,\" Qu Zhi laughed, \"I support you.\"\"Hmph!\"\"If you decide to go, inform me. I'll accompany you.\"\"Okay, okay.\"Although Zheng Baozhu wasn't happy with Wei Yu or how Li Huixin spread the rumors intentionally, she still thought it would be unbecoming to make a scene at their wedding. So she came up with a compromise and decided to go with Qu Zhi, showing them a low-key but resplendent appearance.Qu Zhi's usual casual attire was not bad, but this time, they were preparing to buy two sets of formal dresses to wear to Wei Yu's wedding. As the spokesperson for JS, Zheng Baozhu was self-conscious, so she contacted the brand manager of JS and explained her requirements.It's not strange to need formal dresses for attending a wedding, but they needed two sets, one for a man and one for a woman, and they also needed to be stylish... Sorry, the JS brand representative couldn't comprehend it without more context!Though extremely curious, the representative couldn't directly ask, so he could only start by helping Zheng Baozhu choose the dresses, \"I assume you'll be wearing the women's dress, right? We have all your measurements here, but we'll need the measurements for the men's dress. We'll make the necessary adjustments before the wedding according to the measurements you provide.\"Measurements? Although Qu Zhi had hugged and kissed her, Zheng Baozhu hadn't mastered the skill of directly measuring sizes with her eyes and hands.\"I'll let you know once I have measurements. Can you help us select some styles in the meantime?\" Zheng Baozhu asked.\"Sure,\" the representative replied, \"Or you can bring your male partner directly to our store. We'll prepare the dresses for you, and after you choose the styles, we can help measure the sizes.\"\"Sure, thanks, Mr. Xie!\"\"Don't mention it. Just let me know the date when you've decided.\"\"Okay, got it,\" Zheng Baozhu hung up and sent a message to Qu Zhi, asking him when he was available. Since Qu Zhi couldn't use his phone during work hours, she didn't wait for his reply and continued reading her script.Gao Boyun had informed her that they would do the makeup trial tomorrow. She would also have to meet with the producer. Zheng Baozhu only received a part of the script, but she had read it repeatedly and loved it. Gao Boyun had only talked to her about the female lead's part before, but the male lead's storyline was also very captivating.The male lead was a wealthy businessman who appeared gentle and humble on the surface but was actually very scheming and cunning. He was always entangled with various forces. Due to her father's favor in the past, he secretly helped the female lead after her family had bankrupted, and their paths converged from then on.Although Zheng Baozhu was not familiar with the name of the screenwriter, she searched and found that he was behind several popular dramas. He was particularly skilled in writing political intrigue storylines and handled the relationships between characters better than many male screenwriters. Zheng Baozhu had high expectations for this drama.It seems Gao Boyun still has a good eye for choosing scripts.Of course, she also had to thank herself for being so beautiful; otherwise, she wouldn't have gotten such excellent resources.\"Baobao, the vlog you filmed during the magazine shoot is still there, right?\"Zhou Xiaonan had sent a message to Zheng Baozhu, so she picked up her phone and replied, \"Yes, it's there. Do you want to release it?\"Zhou Xiaonan: Yes, the magazine is preparing two pictures, so they want you to release a vlog as a preview.Zheng Baozhu: Okay, when?Zhou Xiaonan: How about the day after tomorrow? I'll let you know the exact time. Get ready for it.Zhou Xiaonan: Don't forget about the makeup trial tomorrow; I'll come to pick you up on time.At first, Zheng Baozhu thought it would be fine to drive herself, as she had been doing before. However, Zhou Xiaonan criticized this thought, saying that now she wasn't just an extra at the Film and Television City. She needed to maintain a certain image; otherwise, people would laugh at her.\"And besides, even if you don't let your assistant accompany you, they will still receive their salary every month.\"Zhou Xiaonan's words completely convinced Zheng Baozhu.On the day of the makeup trial, Zheng Baozhu followed Zhou Xiaonan and an assistant. As soon as she got out of the car, she saw Lin Ziqin. Both of them knew he was auditioning for the male lead, so it wasn't surprising to see each other. They greeted each other and went inside together. Seeing them coming together, Gao Boyun started gossiping excitedly, \"Are you two secretly planning something? If it gets caught on camera, won't your CP relationship be ruined? Well, it's not a bad thing; it'll increase the hype for our drama.\"Zheng Baozhu reminded him, \"But Director Gao, the drama you'll release first is 'New Moon Wuxin Sword', and I'm not the female lead of that drama. Shouldn't you hype the CP of the main leads during the drama broadcast?\"\"...\"\"It's truly heartbreaking, Baobao. You've only been in the entertainment industry for a few days, yet you're already so well-versed in these unspoken rules?\"\"...Well, because I'm also an internet passerby.\"Lin Ziqin chuckled and said to Zheng Baozhu, \"Don't mind him; let's go to the makeup room.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu followed Lin Ziqin to the dressing room, while Gao Boyun, the director, was left behind with little dignity.Today, a costume designer had been assigned to take measurements for Lin Ziqin and Zheng Baozhu. Although Zheng Baozhu had not signed the official contract yet, it was almost certain. Gao Boyun had said that there would be many beautiful costumes for the female lead, and he wasn't lying.Since she started out as playing extras, Zheng Baozhu was used to wearing costumes that had been worn by others. It was already quite good to get a clean costume. When she filmed as \"Ye Ling\", she had her own exclusive costumes, but they were not custom-made. Now that she had jumped to the lead role, she could have costumes custom-made, and so many of them!No wonder everyone was striving so hard to climb up in the entertainment industry; the world of fame and fortune was indeed enticing.When sitting together for makeup, Lin Ziqin and Zheng Baozhu also discussed the script. In the middle of the trial, the producer and several other crucial crew members came to take a look and exchanged greetings with them before leaving.Makeup for men was simpler. When Lin Ziqin finished his makeup, Zheng Baozhu was still working on her eye makeup. Her character in the drama would have different looks, so her makeup would change accordingly. The one they were trying now was the early life of an innocent and carefree young lady.Zheng Baozhu had a striking and radiant appearance, belonging to the type of beauty that had a strong impact. At first, Gao Boyun was worried that her temperament might not suit Ye Ling's cool and ethereal role. However, the final result turned out to be excellent.Zheng Baozhu was highly adaptable, and with her acting skills, she could portray the character's essence effectively.This time, playing the young lady from the Republican era was no exception. After the makeup was completed, she tried out her expressions in front of the mirror. Even without changing costumes, the innocent and lively charm was vividly presented.\"Not bad, not bad,\" Gao Boyun was very satisfied with the makeup and became delighted, \"Looks great! Teacher Lin, what do you think?\"Lin Ziqin also thought it looked good, \"Yes, Teacher Zheng's adaptability is indeed very strong. This role might be perfect for her.\"The makeup artist asked, \"Shall we try the later-stage makeup as well?\"\"Sure, I'll have the production team come over to take a look first,\" Gao Boyun called over the several key creatives to see Lin Ziqin and Zheng Baozhu's makeup. Everyone was very satisfied. Lin Ziqin's position as a top actor was obvious, and his presence added to the hype. While Zheng Baozhu was a newcomer, she had exceptional physical features and was now on the rise, which the production team appreciated.Since no objections were raised, the makeup artist began to redo Zheng Baozhu's makeup, mainly focusing on eye makeup and lip color. Lin Ziqin's makeup was not as complicated, he could leave after finishing it. However, he didn't seem to have any intention of leaving and stayed back to see Zheng Baozhu's later-stage makeup.With the later-stage makeup, Zheng Baozhu transformed from innocent and youthful to calculating, just like the male lead. Her makeup became much more radiant compared to the early stage. This appearance suited her original temperament; however, Zheng Baozhu herself was a bit sweeter, while the character had a stronger presence.After changing her appearance, when Zheng Baozhu presented herself to everyone, her gaze also changed naturally. Her bright eyes concealed many secrets, and when she smiled slightly at someone, she appeared alluring while hiding countless mysteries in her gaze.\"This look is also beautiful!\" Gao Boyun got excited. He knew that Zheng Baozhu was his destined choice!Zheng Baozhu also loved both makeup looks from today and enthusiastically sent two selfies to Qu Zhi.Zheng Baozhu: Hey, this is your multi-faceted girlfriend! (For internal appreciation only, do not leak)Qu Zhi quickly replied this time: I barely have enough for myself to keep, how could I share with others?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng Baozhu couldn't help but doubt if Qu Zhi had received some kind of specialized training abroad all these years.\"Who are you texting now?\" Gao Boyun saw Zheng Baozhu sitting there staring blankly at her phone and asked teasingly, \"Is it your old classmate again?\"\"Mind your own business,\" Zheng Baozhu locked her phone and played with her hair, \"This updo looks nice.\"The makeup artist stood on the side and said, \"I did a simple one to save time. I'll make it more refined during the official makeup session.\"Today, they were just trying out the makeup. After the costumes were ready, they would need to adjust the makeup according to the costumes. Gao Boyun and the makeup artist exchanged a few words, and then he said to Zheng Baozhu, \"Let's end here for today. I'll send you the contract, and once you've reviewed it, we can sign it as soon as possible.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu sat back in her chair and let the makeup artist help her remove her headpiece and makeup. The producer invited Gao Boyun and others to have dinner together in the evening, but Lin Ziqin had other arrangements and declined. Gao Boyun also didn't agree, \"I still need to go to the studio and check the edited footage.\"Although [New Moon Wuxin Sword] had finished filming, as the director, he couldn't just leave it all and not follow up with the post-production progress. The producer saw that both of them were busy and suggested picking a time when everyone was available to meet up.After Zheng Baozhu finished removing her makeup, she put on a mask and left with Zhou Xiaonan and her assistant. On the way, the person in charge of JS sent a message, saying they had already arranged the time for them to try on the dress tomorrow.Zheng Baozhu thanked them and then sent a message to Qu Zhi: Tomorrow is set to try out the dress fittings. I hope you didn't forget.Qu Zhi had already finished work, and his reply was enthusiastic: Of course not, but do we need to make such a big deal out of it just to attend Wei Yu's wedding?Zheng Baozhu: It's not for Wei Yu, it's for my integrity!Qu Zhi laughed and found Zheng Baozhu's response a bit cute: Alright, I got it. I'll wake you up on time tomorrow.Last time, Qu Zhi had waited outside Zheng Baozhu's door, pretending to be pitiful, and successfully obtained the room key from her. Now, he could openly wait for her in her room.After waking up, Qu Zhi called Zheng Baozhu to offer his wake-up service, and then he got ready and went to her room. Since Zheng Baozhu needed to do her makeup, it would take her some time. Qu Zhi wasn't in a hurry and went to the kitchen to fry eggs and bacon and warm up some milk.When Zheng Baozhu came out, breakfast was already set on the table. She didn't even know she had so many things in her fridge.\"Did you make this?\" Zheng Baozhu casually picked up a cherry tomato and ate it. Qu Zhi patted her hand back gently and asked, \"Did you wash your hands?\"\"Uh, my hands are clean,\" Zheng Baozhu said so, but she still went to the kitchen to wash her hands, \"When did you stuff so many things into my fridge?\"Zheng Baozhu lived in the hotel and had her meals in the restaurant, so she rarely cooked for herself, and thus there weren't many things in her fridge. Qu Zhi sat down at the dining table and took a sip of milk, \"When I put things in my fridge, I also put some in yours.\"\"Hahaha,\" Zheng Baozhu laughed as she sat opposite him and tasted the eggs he fried, \"Your cooking skills are quite good, young man.\"Qu Zhi gladly accepted the praise, \"Well, it took me 25 years to hone my skills.\"Zheng Baozhu was amused by his sense of humor. She used to think Qu Zhi was snarky, but now she found that he not only spoke sweet words but also told jokes, \"You used to always call me a clown, but I think you're suitable to do comedy as well.\"\"It seems like we're a perfect fit.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu was silent for a moment and then started teasing him with some banter, \"But if we analyze the two lines you just said, it seems a bit off.\"Qu Zhi recalled their conversation, his silence lasting longer than Zheng Baozhu's, \"Do you usually read those novels?\"\"...I haven't!\" Zheng Baozhu denied it, feeling a bit embarrassed. Well, she did have a few bookmarked sites that she would occasionally flip through, \"What about you? Can you honestly say you don't watch unhealthy short videos?\"\"Unhealthy short videos?\" Qu Zhi thought for a moment, looking at her, \"You mean those mukbang videos where people eat large quantities of high-calorie food and then induce vomiting? Indeed, they are unhealthy.\"Zheng Baozhu shrugged, \"Don't pretend! Haven't you shared some of those videos with your buddies?\"\"I actually haven't shared any with them.\"\"Oh, so they shared some with you then!\"\"...\"Qu Zhi put down his cutlery, leaned on the table, and leaned slightly towards Zheng Baozhu, teasingly suggesting, \"If you're so interested in this topic, we could explore it together. It should be more interesting than watching short videos.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"So, scientists can also be rogues!Seeing Zheng Baozhu avoid his gaze uncomfortably, Qu Zhi chuckled lightly, picked up his cutlery again, and said, \"You can consider it.\"\"Consider your head!\" Zheng Baozhu retorted, picked up a cherry tomato with her fork, and ate it with gritted teeth.After finishing breakfast together, they went to JS's brand store. Since today was a private arrangement, Zheng Baozhu didn't bring an assistant and drove herself with Qu Zhi. On the way, Zhou Xiaonan sent a message to Zheng Baozhu. Since it was not convenient to read while driving, Qu Zhi sat beside her and relayed the message, \"It says that the legal department has reviewed your contract, and if there are no issues, you can sign it directly.\"\"Okay, good.\"Qu Zhi glanced at her and asked, \"Are those two trial makeup photos you sent me yesterday from this drama?\"\"Yes, it's for Gao Boyun's new drama, set in the Republic of China's business and politics,\" Zheng Baozhu said while driving, \"I've read the script, and it looks good.\"Qu Zhi wasn't interested in work-related matters and just reminded her, \"You should still take a look at the contract yourself.\"\"I already read it last night. Although I'm not a professional, I've signed many contracts over the years, so I have some experience,\" Zheng Baozhu smiled at him, \"Don't worry, my studio's legal affairs are handled by Lawyer Han's friend. Lawyer Han and I have cooperated for many years, and he's very reliable.\"\"That's good,\" As he said this, Qu Zhi didn't want to delve further. He remembered that Zheng Baozhu started her own business during her university years, starting with a few tea shops. It was indeed a risky venture for a university student without any prior business experience, \"When you started your own business in university, weren't you afraid of being cheated?\"\"Of course, that's why I had to be extra cautious with every decision I made, especially when signing contracts,\" Zheng Baozhu said, \"There were indeed people who tried to deceive me because they saw me as just a university student, but fortunately, I was careful enough not to fall for it. Lawyer Han was introduced to me by my father and he has helped me a lot over the years. So, you were right before, I should thank my father for my business ventures.\"Qu Zhi coughed uncomfortably, trying to explain, \"It's not that... My understanding back then was too one-sided. Doing business is never easy, let alone when you're a university student. You indeed have more courage and decisiveness than many others, and your investment judgment is quite accurate.\"Zheng Baozhu chuckled and said, \"Well, today I've come to understand that when you dislike someone, everything they do seems wrong in your eyes. But when you like someone, even if they slap you in the face, you still believe it's right.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Fine.\"Humans are truly hypocritical.\" Zheng Baozhu glanced at him. Qu Zhi raised an eyebrow, \"I won't deny that. Aren't you the same?\"\"...\"\"...No, weren't we just talking about the script?\" Let's not touch those scars and hurt each other, okay? \"By the way, the male lead in this drama is Lin Ziqin! I feel like we have some connection!\"\"...\"Qu Zhi's expression turned cold, \"Huh, let's get back to discussing business.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She cast a sidelong glance at Qu Zhi and asked him with amusement, \"Are you jealous again? You have such a small mind.\"Qu Zhi looked at her and replied, \"Perhaps my mind is even smaller than you imagine.\"\"...\" No, no, no, I've known since the third grade that Qu Zhi has a small mind!Zheng Baozhu didn't want to provoke Qu Zhi further and focused on driving her car. After arriving at JS's store, the staff warmly escorted them to the VIP area on the second floor.\"Miss Zheng, we have prepared three sets of dresses for you to choose from. Please have a look,\" the staff, wearing white gloves, brought out the prepared dresses, \"Considering that you are attending a wedding, we avoided the common red and white colors that might clash with the bride. Black might also be avoided by some people, so we selected light purple and yellow.\"Zheng Baozhu glanced at the dresses; they were all beautiful, but she paid more attention to the men's suits. JS prepared mainly suits for men, with slight variations in style, such as the choice of tie and pocket square, which would be in light pink.Looking at Qu Zhi, she asked, \"If I choose...\"\"No,\" Qu Zhi interrupted her before she could finish, \"I can't handle that.\"\"Who said that? You can even handle gold, so this won't be a problem for you,\" Zheng Baozhu coaxed him, hoping to see Qu Zhi try on the dress. The JS staff also chimed in, \"That's right, sir, men wearing light pink won't look strange; it's actually quite fashionable. And you have an excellent figure and temperament, so the effect will surely be outstanding.\"When Qu Zhi entered the store, the female staff took notice of this handsome guy, but out of politeness, she couldn't keep staring at him. Now, she finally had a reason to look at him openly!Although she worked in the business of flattering customers every day, the words she just said were not flattery at all. This gentleman was genuinely handsome and his figure was simply natural elegance.She didn't know his identity, but since Zheng Baozhu drove him here in a luxury car... this was the joy of being a rich woman! She wished she could have such happiness too!Although the staff's thoughts went off on a tangent, she maintained her professional and friendly smile.Still, Qu Zhi was not swayed by her words, \"I think the purple one looks the best.\"Zheng Baozhu looked at the dress he pointed out, which was probably because the nearby men's suit had a tie and pocket square in the purple color family.\"Do you like purple?\" Zheng Baozhu looked at him. Purple was also a charming color. She hadn't seen Qu Zhi wear it yet, \"Sure, we can try this purple set first.\"\"Okay,\" the staff led Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi to two separate fitting rooms and brought the dresses as well.Zheng Baozhu cautiously put on the dress and noticed that the zipper at the back was a bit difficult to pull up. She poked her head out of the fitting room, intending to ask the staff to help her, but she saw Qu Zhi had already changed into the suit and was standing in front of the mirror, adjusting it.\"Qu Zhi,\" She called him. Qu Zhi turned to look at her and walked towards her.\"What's wrong?\"\"I can't zip up the dress. Can you help me?\"\"Sure,\" Qu Zhi entered the fitting room. Zheng Baozhu turned her back, tucking her hair to the front, exposing her fair and smooth back to Qu Zhi.The last time Zheng Baozhu was in his room, she was still wearing a base layer underneath the dress, but this time, she had nothing underneath, and her snowy white back was exposed to Qu Zhi.Suddenly, Qu Zhi felt a little dry in his throat, and his heart seemed to race. He walked up and hugged Zheng Baozhu from behind with one hand. Lowering his head, he gently sniffed the skin on her neck. Zheng Baozhu felt slightly ticklish and couldn't help but giggle and squirm a bit, \"What are you doing? I asked you to help me with the zipper.\"\"Mhm,\" Qu Zhi responded softly, then he placed a kiss on Zheng Baozhu's neck. The touch of his lips sent shivers down her spine, she couldn't control the light moan that escaped her. Qu Zhi tightened his embrace, placing tender kisses on her back.\"Qu Zhi, don't do this here...\" Zheng Baozhu didn't expect Qu Zhi's kisses to weaken her knees so quickly. Qu Zhi turned her around and pinned her against the wall, asking, \"Why not?\"Blushing, Zheng Baozhu tried to say something, but before she could speak, Qu Zhi's lips sealed hers again. Since they confirmed their relationship, they occasionally shared kisses, but most of them were light and fleeting. However, this kiss was different, filled with a strong sense of possession, more intense than any before.Submitting to Qu Zhi's passionate attack, Zheng Baozhu wondered if he suddenly became so passionate because he found the fitting room exciting?He said he didn't watch unhealthy videos!\"Miss Zheng, are done trying on the clothes? Do you need any assistance?\" The staff's voice unexpectedly came from outside, interrupting the couple inside the fitting room. Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu slightly distanced themselves, Qu Zhi's lips formed a charming curve. Zheng Baozhu's heart was racing, and she quickly replied to the staff, \"I'll be ready in a moment.\"\"Alright, I'll be waiting outside. Let me know if you need any help.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Can you please go and be busy elsewhere for a while?Looking at Qu Zhi, she playfully pinched his waist, \"Are you still able to smile? How do we go out like this?\"Qu Zhi's hand reached around to her back and slowly zipped up the dress, \"Just find some kind of excuse to distract them.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu turned toward the staff outside and said, \"Um, I'm feeling a bit thirsty. Could you get me a glass of water?\"The staff replied, \"I already brought water and a fruit platter for both of you.\"\"Ah, I see,\" VIP service indeed, quite attentive.Qu Zhi gently kissed her again and suggested, \"Let's just go out directly. As long as we act nonchalant, it won't be awkward.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Is this even reasonable? :)Following the principle of \"I'm not awkward, the awkwardness is on others\", Zheng Baozhu was pulled out of the fitting room by Qu Zhi. The staff waiting outside saw them come out together and had a momentary eye-opening experience!But they were professionals, and even though their hearts might have been shaken, they maintained their professional smiles.They just smiled a bit more stiffly than usual.\"Are both of you dressed now?\" The staff didn't even ask why they came out of the same fitting room. They walked up to help adjust their clothes, \"Miss Zheng, you look lovely in this outfit. The purple complements your fair complexion.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Of course, how can it not complement my fair complexion, after all, I don't have a thick skin like Qu Zhi does. :)\"This suit looks great on Mr. Qu too. The purple tie is the finishing touch, making his temperament even more noble and adding a touch of charm.\"Zheng Baozhu didn't want to try on more outfits, so she directly decided on this one, \"Let's go with this set.\"\"Sure!\" The staff smiled and nodded, \"We'll take your measurements and make slight adjustments according to your physique. Once it's ready, we'll inform you right away.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng Baozhu had her measurements taken first. Then she sat on the sofa, eating fruit while watching the staff measure Qu Zhi.Qu Zhi took off his coat and cooperatively stood there while one of the staff members, wearing white gloves, measured his shoulder width and arm length, another staff member recording the measurements.Since Qu Zhi had a good physique, the scene was quite pleasing to the eyes.After the measurements were done, Qu Zhi went back to the fitting room to change clothes, while Zheng Baozhu paid with her card. The staff swiped the card and asked, \"Miss Zheng, the alterations will be ready in three days. Would you like to come and pick them up or have us deliver them to a specified location?\"\"Just have them delivered directly to me,\" Zheng Baozhu didn't want to go back again, so she asked them to help with the delivery. The staff nodded and said, \"Sure, please leave your address and contact number.\"Zheng Baozhu left her hotel address, and just as it was registered, Qu Zhi came out. Zheng Baozhu made him wait for a moment while she changed back into her regular clothes. Then, they walked out of JS together.The staff watched their car drive away before returning to the store. Their service was indeed very attentive. Qu Zhi was still sitting in the passenger seat and jokingly said, \"The way the staff looked at me just now, I couldn't tell if they were envious of you or envious of me.\"\"Haha,\" Zheng Baozhu glanced at him and said, \"What's the matter? Professor Qu finally couldn't maintain his thick-skinned attitude? But just now, when we came out of the fitting room, you were obviously quite thick-skinned.\"Qu Zhi didn't respond and simply smirked. Worried that he might actually have some psychological burden, Zheng Baozhu explained, \"Since the wedding was my invitation, I should be the one to provide the attire for you to attend. Besides, I'm their spokesperson, and I get an exclusive discount when I buy clothes from them.\"\"Oh,\" Qu Zhi's tone sounded a bit regretful, \"Then I should have taken advantage of your spokesperson discount and bought one more outfit just now.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"How could anyone think that Qu Zhi would have any psychological burden? :)In the afternoon, Qu Zhi received a call and had to go back to work. Zheng Baozhu stayed alone in the hotel and posted her previously taken vlog. The photoshoot for the magazine [TOMATO] was made possible through JS's introduction, giving Zheng Baozhu the opportunity to be featured. Although she only got a few pages and not the cover, the vlog she posted caused a lot of comments.Some fans eagerly anticipated the fresh photos, while others were envious and left bitter comments on Zheng Baozhu's Weibo, claiming that she was just a newcomer without any significant work and yet received endorsements and magazine features because of her connections in the industry.When she saw that she was approaching five million followers on her Weibo, Zheng Baozhu considered doing a giveaway to celebrate the milestone.Before reaching five million followers, Wei Yu's wedding date approached. Zheng Baozhu received her and Qu Zhi's altered outfits in advance, and when they tried them on, they indeed looked much better and well-coordinated.The wedding was held at the A-grade Oudou Hotel, a luxurious five-star hotel in City A. Wei Yu seemed to have done well for himself in these years. Zheng Baozhu didn't drive herself today; instead, her assistant drove her and Qu Zhi.Upon arriving at the hotel, Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi both wore masks that were in matching designs.Entering the hotel, they saw the grand display of Wei Yu and the bride in the lobby. Following the signs, Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi proceeded to the banquet hall on the second floor. The hall was not yet filled with guests, and due to Zheng Baozhu's special status, a private room was reserved for her high school classmates who came to attend.At the entrance of the banquet hall, Zheng Baozhu registered Qu Zhi's name and handed over the prepared red envelope. The registration personnel also offered a handful of wedding candies to Qu Zhi, but he politely declined, stating that he didn't eat.As they were about to head to the adjacent private room, Wei Yu and the bride came out. Despite wearing masks, Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi were still eye-catching, especially when they stood together.Wei Yu almost recognized them at a glance, \"Zheng... Qu Zhi, is it Qu Zhi?\"He intended to call Zheng Baozhu but stopped himself just in time and called Qu Zhi's name. Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi both turned to look in his direction.In high school, Wei Yu was quite good-looking and had decent grades, making him one of the popular boys in their year\u2014he was only \"one of the popular\" because of Qu Zhi, who was the most popular boy.While Qu Zhi was popular, he was also notoriously hard to pursue. Some students who found it difficult to approach him turned their attention to the second most handsome boy in their grade, Wei Yu. Many believed that he was easier to get close to until rumors spread that Wei Yu had rejected Zheng Baozhu.Zheng Baozhu was the most beautiful girl in their year and was well-liked by her classmates due to her cheerful personality, excellent academic performance, and decent luck.The fact that Wei Yu rejected Zheng Baozhu created quite a sensation at the time.Zheng Baozhu now understood why Wei Yu invited her here. It was for the sake of grabbing some attention! Wei Yu was piggybacking on her popularity!Wei Yu had gained some weight compared to before, and his hair had changed a bit, but he still retained some of his previous appearance, which both Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi recognized. The bride was standing beside him, and when she first heard that Zheng Baozhu was Wei Yu's old classmate and was coming to their wedding, she didn't believe it until she saw Zheng Baozhu with her own eyes.She was a big fan of Lin Ziqin, so she naturally noticed Zheng Baozhu and felt a bit annoyed upon hearing the news of Zheng Baozhu deliberately fueling their CP for attention. Since then, she quietly followed her Weibo, intending to find an opportunity to criticize her. However, she didn't expect to be captivated by Zheng Baozhu's appearance without realizing it, especially after seeing those beautiful spring photoshoots she posted. The set of photos from her childhood to adulthood was also stunning. And when she defended Sun Jing against the reporters, she was really cool!Before she knew it, she had started calling herself \"Gold Yuanbao\". :)Seeing Zheng Baozhu with her own eyes, the bride was in shock and covered her mouth in disbelief. Worried about causing a scene, Wei Yu quickly explained to Zheng Baozhu, \"Well, she's a big fan of yours, and she's been following your Weibo, so seeing you in person is a bit overwhelming for her.\"Zheng Baozhu was a bit surprised as she glanced at the bride; she hadn't expected this.The bride was a starstruck fan, and this was the first time she had seen a celebrity up close like this. It took some effort for her to calm down. Approaching Zheng Baozhu, she exclaimed excitedly, \"You look even better in person than in the photos! Oh my god, you're really stunning!\"Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but laugh, \"You can tell that even though I'm wearing a mask?\"\"Of course! A mask can't hide your beauty!\" The bride sincerely complimented and said, \"Can I give you a hug?\"\"Of course,\" Zheng Baozhu reached out and hugged the bride, saying, \"Congratulations on your wedding.\"\"Thank you!\"\"Um, you two can go to the small private room next door first. It will be a while before we start the banquet,\" Wei Yu saw more guests approaching and asked Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi to go ahead, \"Our high school classmates are all in there.\"\"Sure,\" Qu Zhi nodded, holding Zheng Baozhu's hand, and they walked away. Watching them holding hands, the bride suddenly grabbed Wei Yu next to her and asked, \"The handsome guy just now, is he Zheng Baozhu's boyfriend?\"Wei Yu was taken aback for a moment and replied, \"I don't think so. He's also our high school classmate and has been childhood friends with Zheng Baozhu.\"\"Childhood friends? Then they must be a perfect match!\"\"...Don't say that. It might affect them if it gets out.\"\"I didn't say anything.\" The bride said, \"Didn't you see that they are both wearing matching outfits? They even held hands when they walked away.\"Wei Yu was once again taken aback. He did see them holding hands, but he thought it was because they were close friends since childhood, not that they were...\"Are they really wearing matching outfits?\"\"...\"The bride looked at him speechlessly, \"The handsome guy deliberately chose a tie and pocket square that matched Zheng Baozhu's dress. It's definitely matching outfits!\"Wei Yu hadn't fully processed the information when he was forced to attend to other guests. He could only temporarily put this matter aside.Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi walked towards the private room, when Zheng Baozhu sighed softly, \"Let's forget about Wei Yu today. I've had enough of that debt from back then.\"Qu Zhi chuckled and turned his head to look at her curiously, \"Why the sudden change of heart? Didn't you want to prove to everyone that Wei Yu is unworthy of you? Weren't you trying to clear your name?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"It's true that Wei Yu is nothing special, but the bride is innocent in all this. Today is not just Wei Yu's wedding; it's hers too. I don't want to ruin her happy memories. Let's leave it be and let Wei Yu thank his wife.\"Qu Zhi wasn't surprised by her decision. He raised an eyebrow slightly, stopped, and knocked on the door of the private room.\"Is that Baozhu and Qu Zhi?\" Meng Yaxin's voice came from inside the room, \"I'll open the door!\"Eagerly, she went to the door and opened it, revealing Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi standing outside, dressed in matching formal outfits!\"Oh my goodness, you two look stunning!!\" Although Meng Yaxin often saw Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi, she couldn't help but exclaim. Upon hearing her words, everyone inside the room craned their necks to look toward the door.Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi entered the room when Zheng Baozhu took off her mask, \"Sorry, everyone. Did we come in late?\"As she removed her mask, the room erupted in astonishment, unsure if it was at her appearance or at the fact that a celebrity had actually arrived.Qu Zhi also took off his mask and greeted the people in the room. Everyone then regained their composure and stood up from the sofa to welcome them, \"Oh, not at all. Come, have a seat. We were just talking about you both!\"Meng Yaxin took the opportunity to glance at Li Huixin, whose face had turned a little pale, and said, \"Yes, especially Huixin. She kept mentioning Baozhu in the group chat. I even suspected she was secretly a fan of Baozhu.\"Li Huixin was called out and finally recovered her senses, \"Well, I was Baozhu's classmate for two years, after all.\"Another guy next to them, who wasn't familiar with Zheng Baozhu, said somewhat teasingly, \"Just now, I thought Li Huixin was becoming more and more beautiful, but now that I see Zheng Baozhu, I know what true beauty is!\"Meng Yaxin: \"...\"She, who wanted to tease Li Huixin a bit, now felt a little sorry for her.Li Huixin's expression changed slightly, but she didn't say anything and just sat quietly to the side, ignoring everyone. A few of them incredulously looked at Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi, \"Baozhu, you and Qu Zhi are together?!\"Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi were considered prominent figures in their grade back then. However, due to their notorious animosity, everyone had assumed they were the least likely to be a couple. Life truly is unpredictable.\"Are you two wearing matching outfits?\" Another person noticed their matching attire and exclaimed, \"Tell us, who pursued who?\"\"It must be Qu Zhi who pursued our Baozhu.\" Meng Yaxin added a comment from the side.Qu Zhi nodded, \"Yes, I pursued Baozhu.\"The room burst into cheers, and Meng Yaxin, acting like Zheng Baozhu's manager, reminded them, \"However, let's keep this within our group and not spread it around, okay?\"\"We know, we know,\" Everyone nodded in agreement.Li Huixin sat alone on the side, eating melon seeds. One of the classmates came over and grabbed a handful of melon seeds, sitting beside her, \"Huixin, didn't you previously like Qu Zhi?\"Li Huixin rolled her eyes, \"No, I definitely did not.\"\"Hah, what's wrong with admitting it? Zheng Baozhu was also rejected by Wei Yu, right?\" the person continued, not believing her words, \"Why do I feel like this whole thing is a bit absurd?\"Li Huixin didn't say anything and the other person continued to look in the direction of Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi, sighing, \"So many years have passed, yet Qu Zhi hasn't aged a bit. He looks even more handsome now than before! Wei Yu, on the other hand, is not doing so well. If he doesn't take care of himself, he'll gain weight in a couple of years.\"Li Huixin couldn't help but glance at Qu Zhi as well. After so many years since graduation, Qu Zhi still had that impressive and spirited look. The last time she saw him at Lily Roast, she didn't feel as strongly as she did today. Now, Qu Zhi, dressed in formal attire, stood out in a group of classmates.It was as if all the students from high school had gathered for a morning assembly, and they could always spot Qu Zhi with just one glance.Indeed, she had a crush on Qu Zhi during their school days, but back then, many other girls also had a crush on him. There were always girls pursuing Qu Zhi, even in their final year. Some girls would even slip notes to him, which angered their class teacher.Qu Zhi, of course, was never affected, or one could say that he was never influenced by anyone or anything.But why was Zheng Baozhu different?Why precisely Zheng Baozhu?If Li Huixin had any grievances in her high school, it should only be two: Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu.Li Huixin came from a well-off family and was beautiful, envied by many since childhood. But for the first time, she envied someone else when she met Zheng Baozhu.Zheng Baozhu was like a dazzling gem; when she was around, everyone else faded into the background. Fortunately, she was still the class monitor, which brought back some balance, but in the second semester, Zheng Baozhu took that role from her as well!Li Huixin couldn't understand it. :)After that, she silently competed with Zheng Baozhu, with their academic achievements being quite similar. Every time she surpassed Zheng Baozhu in exams, she would secretly rejoice, and if Zheng Baozhu outperformed her, she would work even harder. Zheng Baozhu was unaware of this, but her grades had unknowingly improved significantly...Back then, she thought that caring so much about Zheng Baozhu was because they were in the same class, and once they graduated, she would kick Zheng Baozhu out of her life.The only thing she didn't expect was that with the rapid development of technology, everyone swiftly entered the internet age, resulting in Zheng Baozhu forever occupying a spot in her mobile phone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Huixin had never added Zheng Baozhu as a friend on social media, but one day she was suddenly pulled into a class group chat. At first, she was quite happy until a notification popped up, indicating that Zheng Baozhu had joined the group as well.The corners of Li Huixin's mouth instantly drooped.Suddenly, there were two knocks on the door of the private room. Wei Yu pushed the door open and said to them, \"The ceremony is about to begin; you can take your seats.\"A total of ten high school classmates came; Wei Yu arranged for them to sit at one table. Zheng Baozhu put on her mask and left with Qu Zhi. Their table was located in a corner, not attracting much attention.The ceremony started promptly at twelve o'clock. The proceedings were similar to other weddings Zheng Baozhu had attended. However, the banquet hall was beautifully decorated.When it was time to dine, Zheng Baozhu removed her mask. Sitting beside her, Meng Yaxin asked, \"Aren't celebrities not supposed to eat high-calorie food?\"Zheng Baozhu calmly replied, \"As long as my manager doesn't see, it's fine.\"Meng Yaxin was speechless, \"You have no sense of self-discipline as a celebrity.\"Zheng Baozhu explained, \"Qu Zhi asked me not to follow other celebrities; he said I've already lost enough weight.\"Meng Yaxin glanced at Qu Zhi, who was sitting on the other side of Zheng Baozhu.Qu Zhi nodded indifferently, \"Yes, I told her.\"\"...Alright, as long as you're happy.\"The formal attire Zheng Baozhu wore today easily accentuated her lower belly, so she didn't eat much and only tasted a few bites of each dish. Halfway through the meal, the newlyweds came to propose toasts. Since there were many people at this table, no one was forced to drink; a symbolic gesture was enough.In the afternoon, the newlyweds reserved private rooms for the guests to drink tea, play mahjong, or even sing at karaoke. If the younger crowd wanted to go for karaoke, they could help book a place. Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi didn't stay to play with everyone and left early. After freshening up in the restroom and touching up her makeup, Zheng Baozhu ran into Wei Yu when she came out.Zheng Baozhu didn't know if Wei Yu happened to be using the restroom or if he intentionally waited there, but she didn't ask. She smiled and nodded at Wei Yu, preparing to leave when he stopped her, \"Um, Zheng Baozhu.\"Zheng Baozhu paused and looked at him. Wei Yu seemed a bit awkward, possibly because he was tipsy from the alcohol during lunch, and his face was a little red. He looked at Zheng Baozhu, hesitated for a moment, and then asked, \"I heard them say that you and Qu Zhi are together now?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu candidly nodded.A trace of self-mockery flashed in Wei Yu's eyes, \"So, you rejected me back then because of Qu Zhi, right?\"Zheng Baozhu glanced at him and suddenly smiled playfully, \"Wei Yu, I didn't even mention that today, yet you're running into a wall by yourself. So, are you admitting now that I rejected you back then?\"Wei Yu's face turned even redder than before, he pursed his lips as if trying to explain something, \"I didn't spread that story. At the time, a classmate saw it and asked if you rejected me... I, I don't know what got into me, I felt embarrassed about being rejected by you, so I casually said that it was me who rejected you. I didn't... I didn't expect him to spread it to everyone.\"Zheng Baozhu chuckled and looked at him, \"You being rejected by me is embarrassing, but me being rejected by you wouldn't be embarrassing, right?\"\"No, it's just that I...\"\"Don't explain. Even if someone else spread it, after you found out, you didn't come to clarify, did you?\"Wei Yu remained silent and Zheng Baozhu didn't want to argue with him anymore. It had been so many years since that incident, and if it weren't for Li Huixin bringing it up constantly, she would have almost forgotten about it.Without saying anything further, she raised her foot to leave. Wei Yu seemed like he wanted to hold her hand but midway, he realized it was inappropriate and withdrew his hand, \"Zheng Baozhu, I'm sorry.\"He suddenly apologized to Zheng Baozhu, perhaps finally breaking the ice, and the rest of his words sounded much more relaxed, \"I was wrong back then, and I apologize to you. I know my apology is too late, but I haven't forgotten about this incident all these years. I was indeed weak and concerned about my pride at the time.\"\"As long as you know,\" Zheng Baozhu said, looking at him, \"I hope that in the future, you'll treat your wife like a man and be responsible.\"Hearing such words from someone he once liked, Wei Yu's face definitely didn't look good. His hand that was placed beside him clenched into a fist, and his palm began to sweat. After a long pause, he finally managed to say, \"Uh, I will.\"Qu Zhi was standing outside the corner, waiting for the two of them to finish talking before walking over, \"Wei Yu, the bride is looking for you.\"\"Oh, alright,\" Wei Yu responded and glanced at Zheng Baozhu again before quickly walking outside. As he passed by Qu Zhi, his footsteps paused, and he stopped to say, \"Take good care of Baozhu.\"Qu Zhi's eyes appeared even colder than before, and his gaze swept over Wei Yu as if carrying icy debris, nearly freezing Wei Yu in place, \"From what standpoint are you saying that?\"\"Clas... classmates,\" Wei Yu's imposing manner inexplicably weakened. He had never liked Qu Zhi since their school days; Qu Zhi always carried an air of superiority, as if he didn't care about everything around him. So many years had passed, and he hadn't changed a bit, still as unlikable as ever.Qu Zhi gave a cold smirk and stood in place, waiting for Zheng Baozhu, \"I'll remember to invite you, an old classmate, to our wedding. Remember to bring gifts.\"\"...\"Wei Yu left in a hurry.Qu Zhi coldly smirked and stood in place, waiting for Zheng Baozhu, \"Let's go.\"\"Alright,\" Zheng Baozhu heard what he had just said to Wei Yu and curiously asked, \"Are you really planning to invite Wei Yu to our wedding?\"A smile finally appeared on Qu Zhi's face, and he turned his head to look at Zheng Baozhu, \"The prerequisite is that we have to have a wedding first.\"The mention of the word \"wedding\" made Zheng Baozhu's heart skip a beat, but she quickly regained her composure, \"You're not proposing, are you?\"\"Of course not,\" Qu Zhi said, \"My proposal won't be so simple.\"\"Oh...\"\"By the way, do you have work this afternoon?\"Zheng Baozhu shook her head, \"No, do you have any plans?\"\"I don't have any either,\" Qu Zhi looked at her with a smile, \"But Meng Yaxin said that Cen Tongtong has plans.\"Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow in suspicion. On the way back, she figured out what happened.Before this, Cen Tongtong made a bold claim that if Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi got together, she would eat all the keyboards at home. Although she later claimed to have thrown away all the keyboards, Meng Yaxin didn't plan to let her get away with it so easily.Since Cen Tongtong said she had no keyboards left, Meng Yaxin went ahead and customized a special keyboard for her.They were practically sisters.The customized keyboard took some time and it was only shipped by the seller a few days ago. Yesterday, when Meng Yaxin checked the tracking, it showed that the package had been delivered. So she immediately set up a live broadcast for Cen Tongtong, in which she would eat the keyboard.The broadcast was scheduled for this afternoon.\"Surprised or not? Unexpected, right?\" Meng Yaxin's voice on the phone sounded proud, and one could imagine her triumphant look, \"I was afraid you'd be upset at Wei Yu's wedding today, so I prepared this reserved program for you! I truly am your best sister!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Cen Tongtong might want to hit someone if she heard this.\"I'm still stuck playing mahjong with them. They won't let me go even though they need one more player,\" Meng Yaxin's voice could be heard in the background playing mahjong, \"But it's fine, it won't delay me from watching the live broadcast. Say hello to Cen Tongtong for me!\"Qu Zhi said, \"I'll go.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"?\"She suspected that Qu Zhi had been holding a grudge all this time.So, don't offend Qu Zhi, this narrow-minded person! This was a lesson learned from tears!Qu Zhi initiated a three-way video call and brought Cen Tongtong, who was reluctant, into the conversation. Cen Tongtong had a smiling face but her mind was full of foul words: \"You'll all get your retribution.\"Qu Zhi smiled and said, \"You eat the keyboard first before saying anything.\"\"Hahahahaha!\" Meng Yaxin laughed wildly.Cen Tongtong smiled and took out the custom-made keyboard from Meng Yaxin. As expected, Meng Yaxin still had some conscience and common sense, knowing that eating a keyboard would be deadly. So she found a dessert shop and had a chocolate keyboard custom-made.The chocolate was pure dark chocolate, slightly bitter but otherwise tolerable. Cen Tongtong took a few bites on the other end of the camera. Seeing this, Zheng Baozhu and Meng Yaxin were already laughing uncontrollably.\"...\"Cen Tongtong smiled and said, \"I didn't expect that my first mukbang in life would be like this.\"Zheng Baozhu laughed while wiping her tears, \"I also didn't expect that the first time I watched someone's mukbang, it would be so funny, hahaha!\"Cen Tongtong tried to eat a couple more bites, but even the dark chocolate started to feel too much, \"I can't eat anymore. Dogs die if they eat chocolate.\"\"...\"Meng Yaxin gave a thumbs-up, \"You truly deserve it. You can insult yourself to avoid eating it.\"Cen Tongtong smiled at her, \"You too, why are you laughing like a dog? Want a bite of dog food?\"\"...\"Meng Yaxin couldn't laugh anymore.\"Okay, that's enough,\" Cen Tongtong finished eating the keyboard, and Zheng Baozhu decided to spare her, \"Tongtong, after going through this, you should learn a lesson. Don't casually make vows.\"\"But it's all because you two are so annoying!\" Thinking about how they used to bad-mouth each other in front of her, Cen Tongtong couldn't hold back her anger, \"You two have been plotting against me for so many years. Did you really want to see me eat a keyboard?! What have I done to deserve this? Tui!\"\"Alright, alright. Tongtong, both of them have already backtracked on their own words,\" Meng Yaxin calmly said, \"After all, nobody can escape the law of reverse psychology.\"\"Cough.\" Zheng Baozhu coughed and pretended to be serious, \"Now that Tongtong has eaten the keyboard, I declare today's video conference concluded. Everyone, let's go.\"After finishing the call, he hung up and let out a sigh. Qu Zhi stood nearby, watching him, and teasingly asked, \"After interviewing the parties involved, did you find it exciting?\"Qu Zhi raised a corner of his mouth in a casual arc and leaned in to peck Zheng Baozhu on the lips, saying, \"Not sure if it's exciting, but it's sweet.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Not long after Wei Yu's wedding, Golden Jade Mansion called Zheng Baozhu to inform her that the second batch of properties was now available for selection. As expected, the penthouses were already gone, so they had to go with their second choice.\"If I had known, I would have pursued scientific research after graduation too,\" Zheng Baozhu held the property information from the sales and complained to Qu Zhi. To which Qu Zhi smiled and replied, \"I decorated my penthouse as a wedding house.\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him with surprise, \"What? Were you already planning to get married back then?\"Qu Zhi's penthouse had been renovated for quite some time. How come he was already preparing for marriage? If it were any other man, it wouldn't be so surprising, but wasn't Qu Zhi's mind only on the motherland back then? How could he have thought about marriage?\"You already like me back then?\" Zheng Baozhu blinked at him, \"My mom mentioned that you had expressed your feelings early on to them.\"\"Yeah, that's right,\" Qu Zhi admitted.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She had intended to tease Qu Zhi a little, but his candid admission left her speechless.\"You're shameless, you know that,\" Zheng Baozhu muttered as she looked at the property information in her hands.Upon hearing these words, Qu Zhi chuckled softly and said, \"After all, you're more important.\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"She really wanted to compile a collection of Qu Zhi's quotes.She had no idea that Qu Zhi was so good with words. :)\"Since I've already bought the penthouse there, do you still want to buy in the same neighborhood?\"\"Yeah, the potential for appreciation is great, and it's also considered an investment,\" Zheng Baozhu said, \"And if we ever have a fight in the future, it's convenient for one of us to move out.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi fell silent for a moment and then leaned closer to turn Zheng Baozhu around to face him, \"I won't fight with you.\"This made Zheng Baozhu burst into laughter, \"Say that again? Do you want me to count how many times we've argued from childhood till now?\"Qu Zhi hesitated for a moment and then replied, \"Well... If we ever have a real fight in the future, you can kick me out, but please don't leave yourself. I'm afraid you won't come back if you leave.\"His eyes were focused and gentle, causing Zheng Baozhu's heart to skip a beat again....Compiling a book of Qu Zhi's quotes was becoming urgent! He was so good with words every day!Eventually, Zheng Baozhu chose a different floor in the same building as Qu Zhi's. This way, it would be convenient for anyone to leave home if they needed to.After completing all the procedures, without realizing it, spring was coming to an end, and the weather was gradually getting warmer. Zheng Baozhu's new drama costumes were ready; Gao Boyun soon arranged for them to try on the costumes and take makeup photos.Gao Boyun had been busy during this time, preparing for the new drama while also overseeing the post-production of [New Moon Wuxin Sword]. On the day when Zheng Baozhu and Lin Ziqin were going to take the makeup photos, the first trailer for [New Moon Wuxin Sword] was officially released.The trailer was one minute and seventeen seconds long, not too short, but because it was an ensemble drama with many characters, apart from the male lead having more screen time, other characters only had a few seconds of appearance.Zheng Baozhu didn't expect that in such a competitive situation, Ye Ling would also have ten seconds of screen time!The final eight seconds of Ye Ling's appearance were action scenes, and the remaining two seconds showed a distant shot that zoomed in on her face, making it look very impressive.Sorry, but she counted it very carefully. After all, this was the first time she had a trailer, and she was like a newcomer who finally got a chance.During the break, while taking makeup photos, she immediately forwarded the trailer on her Weibo. Now her Weibo already surpassed five million followers. When it reached five million followers, she kept her promise and posted a childhood photo as a treat. Now people were already asking for six million followers treat.Naturally, the trailer comments were dominated by the male lead, but Zheng Baozhu's ten seconds included a scene with Lin Ziqin, and both of them looked very elegant and eye-catching. As CP, they were instantly picked up by fans.Fans of the CP were overjoyed and began to share their excitement. However, Lin Ziqin's fans were not happy, so a little war broke out.\u2014They called it little because the CP fans were too few and couldn't compete with Lin Ziqin's fans.However, because they were posting on their own fan base and getting beaten up by Lin Ziqin's fans, they felt upset and retaliated a little. Seeing that both sides were about to escalate, a marketing account suddenly intervened.\u300cLin Ziqin and Zheng Baozhu's CP fans are still fighting with Lin Ziqin's solo fans. Little do they know that Zheng Baozhu already has a boyfriend. [eating popcorn]\u300dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng Baozhu was not the type of mainstream\u00a0celebrity with a massive following, so she wasn't immediately catapulted to the top of the trending list when news about her having a boyfriend emerged. A marketing account released a screenshot of a chat between a netizen and themselves, along with a photo.In the photo, Zheng Baozhu was holding hands with a man, both dressed elegantly, and their relationship seemed extraordinary at first glance.This was like dropping a stone in water and soon someone recognized the male lead.\u300cIsn't this someone from Zheng Baozhu's studio? Wasn't he the one who left with her last time, escaping from the reporters? [eating popcorn]\u300d\u300cYeah, it seems to be that handsome guy! They are a CP couple too!\u300dVarious CP fans noticed the news and discussions about them kept increasing, pushing them up to the tenth place on the trending list. Zheng Baozhu had been busy all day and had just laid down on her bed after applying a face mask when she received a call from Zhou Xiaonan: \"You and Qu Zhi have been exposed. The trending rank is still climbing.\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback. She hadn't expected such a small star like her would receive so much attention.\"I saw the photo. It was taken at the wedding you and Qu Zhi attended last time,\" Zhou Xiaonan said, sitting in front of the computer, looking at the enlarged picture on the screen, \"It's an indoor shot, not like paparazzi photos. It's probably taken by guests at the scene.\"\"Oh, that...\" Zheng Baozhu put the call on speaker and also opened Weibo to see the photos that the marketing account had posted. The picture was taken in a private room where they were gathering with their high school classmates. Zheng Baozhu was speechless, \"Everyone in that private room was our high school alumni. We greeted them when we arrived. I can understand them taking photos of me, but why did they send it to a marketing account??\"\"They did it on purpose to stir up trouble,\" Zhou Xiaonan said, \"Do you have any enemies among your high school classmates?\"\"Come on, how could anyone have a grudge against me?\"\"...\"Zhou Xiaonan fell silent for a moment and then said, \"Well, it's not worth investigating. Let's discuss how to respond.\"Zheng Baozhu thought that only A-list celebrities needed to deal with this kind of life, but she didn't expect even a minor star like her would have to do this, \"I don't really mind, but I'm not sure if Qu Zhi minds. I'll ask him first.\"\"Alright,\" Zhou Xiaonan knew that Qu Zhi was engaged in scientific research; people of this kind often valued their reputation and were reluctant to be associated with the entertainment industry. If Qu Zhi wasn't Zheng Baozhu's old classmate, the two of them might not have gotten together.Zheng Baozhu hung up the phone and sent all the Weibo screenshots to Qu Zhi. Qu Zhi replied promptly, \"I don't mind. You can handle it however you like, and I'll cooperate.\"Zheng Baozhu chuckled and quickly edited the text in the chatbox: \"I'm afraid it's not good for the image of you researchers dating a celebrity.\"Qu Zhi: What era are we living in? Don't hold on to such professional discrimination.Zheng Baozhu: Hahaha, then should I just admit it?Zheng Baozhu: But I'll blur out your information!Qu Zhi: ...Just don't make me look like a wanted criminal.Zheng Baozhu: Nonsense! You're such a handsome wanted criminal, you won't be able to hide for more than two days before being recognized by the public!As soon as she sent this message, Zheng Baozhu's phone vibrated. It was Qu Zhi calling her. She peeled off the face mask on her face and answered the call, \"Qu Zhi?\"\"Yes,\" Qu Zhi's gentle voice came from the other end, \"Why are you still up so late? During dinner, you were about to fall asleep.\"\"I got distracted by the trending news again,\" Zheng Baozhu said, lying on her pillow while talking to him, \"Why are you still awake?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"I'm still working on my paper.\"\"Wow, as expected of you,\" Zheng Baozhu praised, \"You go ahead and continue writing. I won't disturb you. I'll handle the trending issue.\"\"Okay, you should get some sleep too,\" Qu Zhi's usually cold voice sounded warm in the night, \"Don't stay up too late. Goodnight.\"\"Goodnight.\" Zheng Baozhu hung up the phone, and her lips couldn't help but curl up. Feeling good, she opened WeChat to send a message to Zhou Xiaonan, \"Qu Zhi doesn't mind, so how about we just admit it? After all, I'm not trying to gain popularity and rely on hype.\"Although Zheng Baozhu had not been in the entertainment industry before, based on her everyday experiences as a netizen, she knew that the public was more accepting of female celebrities dating. Fortunately, she was a female celebrity.Zheng Baozhu: This way, Lin Ziqin's fans won't say that I'm intentionally hyping the CP anymore! Besides, I can see my and Qu Zhi's CP super-topic skyrocketing, everyone is celebrating.Zhou Xiaonan: ... You're right, but remember that celebrities also have careers. Unexpected, right? Not only do you have a career, but you've also started making it public on your super-topic.Zheng Baozhu: ...Quickly, she clicked into her super-topic, and at the top was a declaration from one of her fans:Bringing Happiness to the Entertainment Circle: Zheng Baozhu, you really disappoint me.\u00a0 I've been following you since you were just an extra. Seeing you go from being an extra to playing Ye Ling, I can't express how happy I am.\u00a0 Since you currently don't have any projects released, do you not realize how much you've been criticized?\u00a0 Because you have no projects, people mock you for accepting endorsements and doing magazine shoots.\u00a0 I was waiting for your project to be released so I could see those crtics eat their words, but guess what? Sorry, I got my face slapped first.\u00a0 Why do you have to handle men now? Instead of focusing on your career, you're focusing on men.\u00a0 Well, goodbye.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"It turns out that there are people who care about her career even more than she does.But there's no conflict between pursuing a career and dating a man! Besides, she never even handled any men!There were many comments like this, questioning Zheng Baozhu's focus on men rather than her career. In her Super Topic, others were advising her differently, saying that her performance in the trailer for [New Moon Wuxin Sword] showed great potential and that she would surely achieve a lot in the future.Then there was a reply that said: Indeed, she has great potential, but during the initial stages of her career, she's already busy with men. Does she even have any ambition for her career?Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"How come there are no replies now? Today, my back aches and I feel exhausted, not because of men, but because of my career!Zheng Baozhu replied to Zhou Xiaonan's message: With my current popularity, it shouldn't have caused me to trend, right?Zhou Xiaonan: ...Zheng Baozhu: Forget it, when should we respond?Zhou Xiaonan: The studio is currently working on the statement. Once it's ready, we'll send it to you.Zheng Baozhu: How about we do it tomorrow instead? Staying up late is tiring.Zhou Xiaonan: ...You seem to be very open-minded about this.Zheng Baozhu replied with an emoji and noticed she had been added to a group chat. The group was created by Wei Yu, consisting of twelve members.It happened to be the ten people who attended the wedding plus the bride and groom.Meng Yaxin privately messaged Zheng Baozhu: I added both you and Qu Zhi to the group. Wei Yu and the others want to find out who leaked the photos online.Zheng Baozhu: Ah, it's not necessary actually, as we won't have any further contact anyway.Meng Yaxin: No, I saw many people talking about it in your Super Topic! I checked the photos, and the person who took them must be among us!Meanwhile, the group chat became lively, with Wei Yu asking who leaked the photos to the marketing account, maintaining a relatively composed and rational tone. After he spoke, nobody in the group owned up to it. But then the bride, Yang Li, stepped in, and her tone was not as kind as Wei Yu's.Yang Li: The photos were clearly taken in a private room, and you are all Wei Yu's old classmates. We invited Zheng Baozhu to attend the wedding, yet someone backstabbed her behind her back. Isn't it inappropriate? How can we face her now? And you, who took the photos and sent them to the marketing account, are you deliberately trying to cause trouble? And you still claim to be old classmates? Huh? If you have the guts to do it, don't be timid now. This is already a violation of privacy!The group fell silent for a moment, and Zheng Baozhu was about to step in to mediate, but then Li Huixin suddenly spoke up: It's not me. Although I have some conflicts with Zheng Baozhu, I wouldn't do something so low-class.After the discussion, one after another, all eight people in the private room, excluding Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi, denied leaking the photos.Qu Zhi: The way you all are talking, it seems like we leaked it ourselves.Zheng Baozhu:Zheng Baozhu: Aren't you supposed to be writing your thesis? Continue writing it instead.Qu Zhi: Aren't you also not sleeping? You said goodnight but kept playing on your phone.Meng Yaxin: ??? You two can have your show here as well?Meng Yaxin: Be careful; it might screenshot your conversation and send it to the marketing account.Zheng Baozhu blinked; \"it\" was a fitting term.Her phone received a friend request, and to her surprise, it was from Li Huixin. After accepting it, Li Huixin began typing messages rapidly.Li Huixin: I know you probably suspect me the most, but it really wasn't me who leaked the photos.\u00a0 Whether you believe it or not, if I didn't do it, I won't admit it. I will definitely find out the truth and won't take the blame for that person.Zheng Baozhu: =.= I never said it was you.Li Huixin: You didn't say it, but I know you're thinking that.\u00a0 I'll contact you after I find out more.Li Huixin had always been someone who took things seriously, especially when it came to matters related to Zheng Baozhu. Back when they were studying, Zheng Baozhu noticed Li Huixin didn't like her and even considered her as a rival, so they didn't interact much.Zheng Baozhu told Qu Zhi about it, and he replied: If we want to investigate, it's actually quite easy. Based on the angle of the photo, we can deduce where the photographer was sitting. I remember that Zhang Lei was sitting in that direction.Zheng Baozhu: ??? You remember where each person was sitting?Qu Zhi: I glanced around when we entered.Zheng Baozhu: ...Ah, is it him? The one you mentioned.Qu Zhi lightly chuckled and replied: Versailles.Zheng Baozhu: Yes.\u00a0 But the person taking the photo might not necessarily have been sitting in that position.Qu Zhi: The angle of the photo should indicate that it was taken while sitting, but it's not impossible that he changed his seat. However, in my memory, most people didn't change their positions.Qu Zhi: Of course, I am just speculating, not saying it's definitely him. But if you want to investigate, you can start with him.Qu Zhi: Is Zhang Lei your secret admirer?\u00a0 Has he written a letter to you?Zheng Baozhu: ??? Why are you feeling so jealous? Why don't you say he's your secret admirer?Qu Zhi: Let's forget about it. We'll talk about this in person tomorrow. You should go to sleep now.Zheng Baozhu sent him a hundred yellow-faced smiling emojis: I've received countless smiles tonight, don't send me any more.\u00a0 Giving them back to you.Qu Zhi held his phone, chuckled, and lowered his head.Zheng Baozhu: They said I am busy handling men instead of focusing on my career , but in fact, I never had done it at least once in my life![Zheng Baozhu retracted the message]Qu Zhi: I saw it.Zheng Baozhu pretended to be dead.After a while, she heard the doorbell ring and hesitated for a moment. Then, she received a message from Qu Zhi on her phone.\"Open the door.\"\"...?\" Zheng Baozhu put on her slippers and got out of bed to open the door for Qu Zhi. He was also wearing slippers and his shirt was only buttoned at the center.Zheng Baozhu stood at the door and swallowed nervously, \"What are you doing so late at night?\"Qu Zhi said, \"Sleeping.\"\"...Ah?\"Zheng Baozhu couldn't believe how things had turned out. Qu Zhi, dressed in sleepwear, was sitting on her bed, looking as if he was ready to go to sleep, \"I've already taken a shower, so let's go to sleep.\"\"???\" Zheng Baozhu was incredulous, \"Why are you sleeping here?\"Qu Zhi leaned against the headboard and looked at her with a half-smile, \"Didn't you say you haven't...\"\"Ah ah ah ah ah!\" Zheng Baozhu cut him off sharply, \"Don't say it!\"\"Alright, I won't say it,\" Qu Zhi's corner of the mouth was still slightly curved as he calmly observed Zheng Baozhu standing by the bed, \"So, are you not planning to sleep?\"\"...\"Why are you sleeping here? Qu Zhi's audacity once again challenged Zheng Baozhu's understanding. How can he remain so composed and not blush or skip a heartbeat? \"Aren't you still working on your thesis?\"\"Well, I'll write it tomorrow. It's already late tonight.\"\"...Oh.\" Zheng Baozhu reflected on herself in her mind. Why was she afraid? Isn't it just handling men? What's there to be afraid of!She quickly lay down on the other side and instructed Qu Zhi, \"Turn off the light.\"As expected, the main character, Qu Zhi, became unnatural again. He agreed and turned off the light in the room before lying down next to Zheng Baozhu. Her heart was pounding rapidly, even in the darkness, Qu Zhi's presence was entwined with her, impossible to ignore.She felt stiff, not daring to move. Suddenly, she heard Qu Zhi's light laughter in her ear, followed by him embracing her, \"Don't be afraid, I don't plan to do anything. I just suddenly wanted to hold you and sleep.\"\"Uh...\" Zheng Baozhu responded slightly stiffly. Although she had known Qu Zhi for a long time, it was still the first time they shared a bed.Qu Zhi whispered in her ear, \"But if you want to do something to me, I won't resist.\"\"...\"Really, is that so? Zheng Baozhu was a bit startled. She turned over to face Qu Zhi and wrapped her arms around his waist.Qu Zhi murmured in her ear, \"Only this?\"\"What else do you want?\" Zheng Baozhu raised her head to look at him, her eyes sparkling in the darkness.Qu Zhi lowered his head and kissed her for a while, hugging her a bit tighter, \"You can hug me more.\"Zheng Baozhu moved closer to him again, resting her head on his chest. Qu Zhi's voice came from above, \"Baozhu, lift your head.\"\"What for?\" Zheng Baozhu raised her eyes to look at him. Qu Zhi kissed the tip of her nose and spoke hoarsely, \"What do you think? Some people only dare to talk but not to act.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu stubbornly said, \"How am I not daring enough?\"She raised her head and started kissing Qu Zhi's forehead to his temple and finally reached the thin lips that often said sweet words. Qu Zhi's fingers combed through her hair, holding the back of her head, and deepened the kiss.Suddenly, Zheng Baozhu felt that handling men was quite enjoyable.When Qu Zhi finally let go, she was already short of breath. Qu Zhi chuckled at her disheveled appearance and softly said, \"Alright, you're too tired today. Go to sleep.\"Zheng Baozhu glared at him, realizing that he had really come just to sleep with her.Sensing her gaze, Qu Zhi raised an eyebrow, \"Or do you want to continue?\"Zheng Baozhu quickly closed her eyes.Qu Zhi silently smirked and closed his eyes as well.When Zheng Baozhu woke up, she found herself alone on the bed. Sitting up, she ran her hand through her hair, pondering if last night was just a dream.\"Awake?\" Qu Zhi came out of the bathroom, still wearing the same sleepwear from last night, except this time it was even more revealing, with the only button unbuttoned.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Oh, knowing it wasn't a dream puts her mind at ease.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 69": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"What are you smiling\u00a0foolishly at me for?\" Qu Zhi came out after washing up and saw Zheng Baozhu sitting on the bed smiling at him, so he couldn't help but smile too.Zheng Baozhu grinned and said, \"Your figure looks really good.\"\"Oh,\" Qu Zhi responded calmly, \"No wonder you're drooling.\"\"...\" Almost subconsciously, Zheng Baozhu raised her hand to her mouth to make sure she wasn't drooling, then glared at Qu Zhi, \"You!\"Qu Zhi walked over, propped his hand on the bed, and leaned over to kiss her forehead, \"I woke up late today; I have to go to the company. You can sleep a bit more.\"Looking up, Zheng Baozhu casually wrapped her arms around his slim waist, \"I won't sleep anymore; I need to deal with yesterday's mess.\"Qu Zhi lifted her head and said, \"Then I'll make breakfast for you.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu replied and went to wash up in the bathroom. When she came out, Qu Zhi was no longer there, but there was breakfast from the restaurant on the table. She walked over and picked up a glass of milk, took a sip, and as she sat down on the sofa, she received a message from Zhou Xiaonan: Are you up? The PR team finished writing the draft. Take a look, and if there are no issues, I'll have them post it.Zheng Baozhu opened and looked at the drafted statement. The statement was concise and clear, acknowledging Zheng Baozhu's relationship with Qu Zhi and clarifying that the previous internet rumors about \"Qu Zhi being a member of Zheng Baozhu's studio\" were false. It also urged everyone not to excessively focus on artists' personal lives and finally condemned the person who leaked private photos, reserving the right to pursue legal action.The statement was well-written and comprehensive. Zheng Baozhu felt there were no problems and replied to Zhou Xiaonan with an \"OK\" emoji.With the approval, the studio's official Weibo quickly posted the statement, complete with the official stamp. Netizens seemed to be waiting for this response, as a flood of comments appeared as soon as the Weibo was published. Of course, there were supporters defending Zheng Baozhu, encouraging everyone to focus on her work. However, there were also some comments challenging her, questioning what work she had to be focused on.\"...Hmph!\" Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but laugh in exasperation. Even though her works hadn't been released yet, the photoshoots she had done were also part of her work. Taking beautiful photos for magazine spreads was also challenging and required a lot of acting skills. It's not like she could just stand there and call it a day!But she knew arguing with netizens about this was pointless. As long as her projects weren't released, they would use this to criticize her every day. After calming her mind while sitting on the sofa, she decided to repost the statement on her own Weibo and added some additional clarifications.Zheng Baozhu V: Mr. Qu and I have been childhood sweethearts since we were very young. After he graduated from high school, he studied abroad and only returned to the country at the end of last year. We only got together recently. He is not from the entertainment industry, so I don't want to share too much information about him. I can only say that he is even busier with work than I am, so please don't worry that my relationship will affect my work. \u00a0I believe a competent adult can balance work and personal life. Thank you all for your concern ^^.After posting her Weibo, the comments poured in even more intensely than the studio's post. While people knew that she was in a relationship with Qu Zhi, they didn't expect them to be childhood sweethearts! The popularity of their CP pairing skyrocketed, and under Zheng Baozhu's Weibo post, people enthusiastically explained the details of Qu Zhi's background.\u300cMr. Qu is involved in scientific research. He and Baozhu attended a charity gala together before, and it even trended. At that time, not many people paid attention to Baozhu, so some of you might not know about it. If you're interested, here's the [Link]!\u300d\u300cMr. Qu is truly handsome, kind-hearted, and intelligent! He's a perfect match for our Baozhu! He even gave a charity lecture at an elementary school before. Check it out! [Link]\u300d\u300cWuwuwu! childhood sweethearts are so adorable! Mom, I finally get to see this for real!\u00a0\u300d\u300cSisters, our brother-in-law is not only handsome but also highly intelligent. He's a rare find! And they've been childhood sweethearts! How can we not be excited about this? \u00a0And they are a perfect match!\u300d\u300cBaozhu has good taste in men! Mr. Qu is amazing! \u300dZheng Baozhu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Ah, she felt like Qu Zhi was even more popular than herself!Aside from these highly praised comments, there were also some negative remarks, but Zheng Baozhu knew she couldn't please everyone. Although some of the comments upset her, she believed that as more of her works release one by one, there would be more viewers who would appreciate her work.As she was thinking about this, her phone buzzed again; it was Meng Yaxin sending her a new message.Meng Yaxin: I saw your Weibo. Are you admitting now that you and Qu Zhi are childhood sweethearts? Weren't you always calling him your enemy before?Zheng Baozhu: Everything changes with time, people are no exception.Meng Yaxin: \u2026\u2026Huh, people.Zheng Baozhu: I'm not going to argue with you. I need to read the script now!Zheng Baozhu wasn't making up an excuse to avoid Meng Yaxin; she genuinely had to read the script. [The Pursuit of the Heart] had already released the official casting poster and was recruiting actors for some roles that had not been finalized yet. Gao Boyun had scheduled a time to hold a script-reading session with them.During the script reading session, apart from the director and screenwriter, the cinematographer, sound recorder, producer, and main actors were all present, even including Lin Ziqin. Zheng Baozhu thought that someone as busy and popular as him probably wouldn't attend a script reading, but now it seemed that Lin Ziqin valued the quality of the performance more than making money.It was Zheng Baozhu's first time attending a script reading session, and she was a bit nervous. It felt a bit like when she used to stand up and read texts in front of the teacher. Due to time constraints, they only selected a few scenes for the script reading and discussion. After a few hours, they gained a lot.After this period of settling down, the news about Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi gradually faded from the internet, and the situation stabilized. Fans of the CP and ordinary fans didn't interfere with each other.During the relatively quiet period in the entertainment industry, [The Pursuit of the Heart] officially announced its main cast.Lin Ziqin was currently the top male artist in the industry, and all aspects of his life were under scrutiny. When [The Pursuit of the Heart] first contacted him, rumors about him playing the male lead in the drama surfaced online. However, since the production team hadn't made an official announcement, they pretended not to know.Various versions of the casting for the male lead were circulating, including mentions of Zheng Baozhu. If the rumors about Lin Ziqin playing the male lead hadn't been leaked, there wouldn't have been so much attention on the male lead role. After all, this was an original script and not a drama based on a popular IP. However, because Lin Ziqin had a huge following, the male lead role had been closely watched.Unexpectedly, without any signs or preparation, the production team finally made an official announcement today![The Pursuit of the Heart]\u00a0official Weibo account had been active for some time, previously only posting casting calls. Today, alongside the announcement of the male lead, they also released two characters' official photos.TV drama - The Pursuit of the Heart: He is the legendary businessman Duan Lanying in the Republic of China, played by Lin Ziqin, who walks between the dark and light, and nobody can guess his heart. She is the wealthy daughter, Zhao Jinghong, played by Zheng Baozhu, who hides her true feelings behind innocence, but a single glimpse reveals her stunning beauty. In that era, how will their fates intertwine? What will happen to national grudges and family hatred? Welcome to watch the Republic of China's commercial war drama [The Pursuit of the Heart].Although this promotional message is full of clich\u00e9s, people don't care to criticize it because the four makeup photos below are all stunning.The production team released four makeup photos at once, two for each of the male lead and female lead. In one set, Lin Ziqin wore a Republic of China-style gown with delicate embroidery, showing an elegant scholarly temperament; in the other set, he wore a fitted suit with meticulous workmanship, exuding a powerful aura.As for Zheng Baozhu, one set featured a lively and cute sundress, perfectly combining the charm and grace of a wealthy young lady. The other set showcased an intricately embroidered dark red cheongsam, matched with a refined updo and stunning makeup, exuding a sense of dangerous allure.Both actors demonstrated strong rendition skills, and the two sets of photos showcased completely different auras, but the only common point was that they looked incredibly attractive!Lin Ziqin and Zheng Baozhu's fans went crazy in the comments; Lin Ziqin fans were too busy being ecstatic to even remember to complain about the casting choice.As for the Lin Ziqin and Zheng Baozhu CP, it was rejuvenated! After Zheng Baozhu publicly announced her relationship with Qu Zhi, their CP momentum declined, and many people stopped discussing it in their fan communities. But now, their CP fans were back in full force, celebrating as if it were New Year's.In celebration of this historic moment, they even applied for a new fan community, [ZhengQiLinRan] (Zheng Baozhu's energy and Lin Ziqin's charisma). It perfectly suited their current revitalized and radiant spirits!Zheng Baozhu, busy replying to comments, suddenly noticed that the CP [ZhengQiLinRan] had unexpectedly resurged. Compared to Qu Zhi, who was presented as her brother-in-law, Zheng Baozhu's solo fans definitely had a lower opinion of Lin Ziqin. Any association with Lin Ziqin would subject them to his fans' scrutiny and criticism. As for the CP fans of Qu Zhi-Zheng Baozhu, this surge in another CP was even more unbearable for them. How could Qu Zhi, their brother-in-law, lose face like that?So they also applied for a new fan community, [MingZhengQu] (Bright Zheng Qu). They were confidently proclaiming that they were the perfect match!Amidst the ongoing battle between CP fan communities, some people noticed that Zheng Baozhu's career had secretly made a comeback.Bringing Happiness to the Entertainment Circle: Ahhhh! Baozhu is awesome!!! Her acting skills are so strong!!! This drama will definitely be a big hit!!! Baozhu, fighting!\u300cOh, if I remember correctly, you were the one who wrote the short essay back then, right? [Picking nose]\u300d\u300cHaha, the shortest time in history! It seems no one can escape the 'true fragrance' law! \u300d\u300cWelcome to the sit-up live event, I am a reporter in the front. \u300dBecause there were too many comments, the person with the username [Bringing Happiness to the Entertainment Circle] posted another message.\u300cHello everyone, I am back. \u300dAfter this user's comment, many others also returned, all attracted back by Zheng Baozhu's two photos. Zheng Baozhu getting the lead role undoubtedly injected a booster shot for them. Zheng Baozhu Weibo also saw an increase in followers. Her followers were close to breaking eight million in just a blink of an eye, jokingly saying that at this rate, she would directly reach ten million followers soon.The drama team also had the male lead post a Weibo, and soon, Zheng Baozhu's Weibo was flooded with fans praising them as a perfect match.\"Sister Xiaonan, am I going to become popular?\" Zheng Baozhu excitedly jumped to Zhou Xiaonan, holding her phone. Although Zhou Xiaonan was also happy, she remained calm and reminded her, \"You'll only become popular if you act well. If you don't, you might just get burned.\"\"...\"Did Sister Xiaonan borrow this line from Qu Zhi?\"Also, fans of Lin Ziqin think your popularity is not enough...\"Before Zhou Xiaonan could finish, Zheng Baozhu interrupted, \"But there are others who think I look super attractive!\"\"Hmm,\" If Zheng Baozhu's makeup photo didn't have such a good effect, she would have already been criticized by Lin Ziqin's fans, \"Just remember to stay grounded and focus on your acting. Besides Lin Ziqin's fans, there are other celebrities' fans who are also nitpicking. If you mess up, they'll be the first to laugh at you.\"\"I know, I'll do my best in acting!\" The official filming was scheduled to start in October, and they would be going to another city since City A's film studio's Republican-era street wasn't as extensive as H City's.Before the official shooting, Gao Boyun arranged for another script reading session next month, and more actors would participate in this one.Feeling happy, Zheng Baozhu invited the staff from her studio to dinner, and she also invited Qu Zhi along. Qu Zhi didn't like these team-building activities, but he was afraid that Zheng Baozhu might drink too much alone outside, so he rushed over to join them.Zheng Baozhu booked two large private rooms at Tianxia Restaurant. The partition between the rooms could be removed to create a super-large private space. The studio's staff had grown in number, so two large tables were fully occupied.Qu Zhi arrived later as he was coming back from work. Zheng Baozhu originally thought of having everyone start eating without waiting for him, but it turned out that their attention was more focused on Qu Zhi.With everyone's eager anticipation, Qu Zhi was finally led into the private room. As the door opened, dozens of eyes immediately fell on him. Qu Zhi's steps paused for a moment, then he walked towards Zheng Baozhu and said, \"Sorry, I just got off work, that's why I'm late.\"\"Not at all, we're already happy that you could come,\" Zhou Xiaonan, as a representative, stood up to welcome Qu Zhi, \"Come, sit here next to Baozhu, we've reserved a seat for you.\"\"Thank you,\" Qu Zhi thanked them and took a seat next to Zheng Baozhu.Everyone's eyes were still fixed on him as he and Zheng Baozhu settled down.Zheng Baozhu thought that being stared at by her staff in the hotel was already awkward enough, but now she realized that it wasn't; this was even more awkward. :)\"Uh, well...\" Zheng Baozhu said to the waiter by the door, \"Since everyone's here, let's start serving the dishes.\"\"Sure,\" the waiter nodded and went out to arrange the dishes.Zheng Baozhu coughed lightly and said to Qu Zhi, \"Let me introduce you. These two are my assistants, you've met them before. Here are our colleagues from the business department, here are the public relations team, here is the finance department, administration, legal, and promotion...\"One by one, Zheng Baozhu introduced the departments of her studio to Qu Zhi. After listening, Qu Zhi smiled and commented, \"Although it's small, it's well-rounded.\"Seeing his smile, two of the colleagues cheered, and when Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi looked over, one of them, the lively administrative staff, boldly said, \"Brother-in-law looks so handsome, even more handsome than in the photos! And he's smiling at our boss!\"Now everyone started to smile ambiguously. Zheng Baozhu had to steady her emotions and not let her face turn red amid their laughter, \"What's so strange about him smiling at me? You guys haven't seen the world!\"\"Exactly, exactly!\" Another colleague chimed in, teasingly, \"It's nothing for him to smile, considering your relationship! Miss Baozhu is right. We just haven't seen the world!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"What kind of words were these?Fortunately, the waiter quickly brought the dishes, and everyone was occupied with eating.After drinking some wine, when they were leaving, Zheng Baozhu playfully clung to Qu Zhi, asking him to carry her, \"Carry me, if you don't carry me, I won't leave.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Her colleagues nearby were understanding and said, \"We'll leave now, we didn't see anything!\"Zheng Baozhu still held onto Qu Zhi's sleeve. With a sigh, Qu Zhi squatted down in front of her and said, \"Climb up.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng Baozhu made a leap and jumped onto Qu Zhi's back. Her hands wrapped around Qu Zhi's neck and she was holding a bunch of flowers that she somehow got from inside the private room.Qu Zhi stood up with her on his back and looked at the flowers in his hand, asking, \"Where did these flowers come from?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"I just took them from the private room.\"\"...You just took them without asking?\"The nearby waiter overheard their conversation and smiled, \"It's okay. If Miss Zheng likes it, consider it a gift.\"\"Did you hear that? They said it's a gift for me,\" Zheng Baozhu proudly shook the flowers in front of Qu Zhi. He reached back to grab her hand and gently pulled it away, warning her, \"Be careful not to fall.\"Following his warning, Zheng Baozhu obediently held onto his shoulders, picked a flower from the bouquet, and gently tucked it into Qu Zhi's hair without him noticing. The waiter on the side couldn't help but stifle a laugh. Zheng Baozhu turned her head and made a \"shush\" gesture.The waiter nodded, not saying a word. Qu Zhi carried Zheng Baozhu on his back all the way out of Tianxia Restaurant to where their car was waiting. After the assistant brought Zheng Baozhu's car over, he poked his head out and asked Qu Zhi, \"Qu...\"Before he could say \"Mr. Qu\", his gaze was drawn to the little flower on Qu Zhi's head. Zheng Baozhu blinked playfully, and the assistant understood, pretending not to notice the flower on Qu Zhi's head, \"Mr. Qu, should I drive you back, or will you be driving Miss Baozhu home?\"Qu Zhi would probably choose the latter option because he didn't drink much that night, so he would want to drive Zheng Baozhu home.Qu Zhi indeed chose the latter option, \"You go back with everyone first, I'll drive Baozhu home.\"\"Alright,\" The assistant opened the car door and got out of the car. He glanced at the flower on Qu Zhi's head, smiling at him, \"Then I'll go back first. Take care of yourselves, Mr. Qu and Miss Baozhu.\"\"Okay,\" Qu Zhi nodded slightly, then turned to look at Zheng Baozhu, who was still clinging to him, \"Are you sober now? If you are, come down.\"\"Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu replied and jumped down from Qu Zhi's back. She consciously walked to the passenger seat, opened the door, and sat inside. Qu Zhi took the driver's seat, and as he did, he automatically closed the side door.Zheng Baozhu buckled her seatbelt, but she struggled to fasten it for a while and couldn't manage it. Qu Zhi frowned slightly, \"Let go, I'll do it.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu obediently released her grip. Qu Zhi leaned over and helped her buckle the seatbelt. Just as he was about to sit upright, he looked up and saw the flower on his head in the rearview mirror.\"... \" He remained silent for a while before looking at the mischievous person sitting beside him, \"Zheng Baozhu, did you do this?\"\"What's wrong?\" Zheng Baozhu innocently looked at him as if she just noticed the flower on his head, \"Oh, why do you have a flower on your head? It looks surprisingly good.\"\"Hmm,\" Qu Zhi gave a faint smile, looking at the flowers in Zheng Baozhu's hand, \"What happened to the bouquet you had earlier? How come it's just a twig now?\"Zheng Baozhu lowered her head to look at the twig in her hand, showing the same surprise, \"Yeah, where did my flowers go?\"\"...Childish,\" Qu Zhi said as he took the flower from his head and casually pinned it onto Zheng Baozhu's head, \"You look even better with it.\"\"Who says that? I think you look good with it,\" Zheng Baozhu replied confidently, \"Look at those men from ancient times; they all liked to wear flowers on their heads, right?\"\"They are who they are, and I am me,\" Qu Zhi fastened his own seatbelt, started the car, and said, \"Sit properly.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu sat properly in her seat, took out her phone, tilted her head, and took a few selfies, \"I look really pretty.\"Qu Zhi smiled and responded with a simple \"Hmm\".Zheng Baozhu then took a picture of Qu Zhi driving, put her phone away, leaned back on the seat, and closed her eyes, \"I'm a bit tired, I'll take a nap.\"\"Sure, wake up when we arrive.\"Qu Zhi set the navigation and the car moved steadily through the city's night scenery. As Qu Zhi drove smoothly, Zheng Baozhu unknowingly fell asleep. When she woke up again, the car was already parked in the garage.\"Are we here?\" Zheng Baozhu opened her eyes, sitting up.\"Yes,\" Qu Zhi unbuckled his seatbelt and replied, \"Sober now?\"Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow defiantly, \"I only had a little; I wasn't drunk to begin with!\"\"Oh, then pretending to be drunk and making me carry you on my back was intentional?\"\"What pretending? Clearly, you were the one who carried me!\"\"Is that so?\" Qu Zhi leaned closer; his dark eyes looked into hers. \"So, do I need to carry you to your hotel?\"Worried that he might really do it, Zheng Baozhu instinctively put her hand on his chest, \"I've told you; there are surveillance cameras here.\"Qu Zhi chuckled and distanced himself, \"Why are you so defensive? Are you thinking of something unhealthy?\"\"...\" You really know how to turn the tables!Zheng Baozhu opened the car door and got out along with Qu Zhi. Qu Zhi saw her walking steadily and reminded her, \"Go back and rest early.\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"I'll rest after Sister Xiaonan returns me some luck! Didn't you see how she kept watching me during dinner today?\"Hearing Zheng Baozhu's words, Qu Zhi burst into laughter. Indeed, during dinner, Zhou Xiaonan had been watching Zheng Baozhu closely, afraid that she would eat more than she should.\"I'll have to start filming soon, so I definitely can't gain weight,\" Zheng Baozhu patted her own stomach while realizing that as long as she had thick skin, even if her manager kept watching her, it wouldn't affect her eating, \"I'll go back and exercise for twenty minutes.\"Qu Zhi lightly laughed, \"It seems like I made the right choice with my gym. Your usage rate might end up higher than mine in the future.\"Qu Zhi's penthouse was almost finished with renovations, they should be able to move in officially by the next Chinese New Year.\"When you have time, we can go together to pick out the decorations,\" Qu Zhi suggested to Zheng Baozhu, \"Some furniture needs to be customized, so we need to select them in advance.\"\"Sure!\" Zheng Baozhu was very interested in decorating the house, especially since it was going to be her wedding house with Qu Zhi, \"Homeland City is a great place to shop; I could spend a whole day there.\"Qu Zhi raised an eyebrow teasingly, \"You are already a popular star with millions of fans. Won't people recognize you in Homeland City?\"\"I can do disguises!\" Zheng Baozhu replied confidently and then looked Qu Zhi up and down, \"But you also need to disguise yourself; many fans recognize you.\"As Zheng Baozhu spoke, she recalled the time when Qu Zhi's half-face went viral and topped the trending list as [How High Can an Average Person's Value Be?]They soon arrived at the door of Zheng Baozhu's room as they chatted. Since the last time Qu Zhi slept in her room, he hadn't been there again. Zheng Baozhu stopped at the door and looked at him, \"I'm here.\"Qu Zhi also stopped, glancing at Zheng Baozhu for a moment, and nodded lightly, \"Hmm, then I'll head back now?\"Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment and also nodded, \"Alright, goodnight.\"\"Goodnight,\" Qu Zhi bid her goodnight and walked towards his room. Once Zheng Baozhu was back in her room, she closed the door and stomped her foot in frustration!Ah, should she have invited Qu Zhi inside for a bit? They were both adults and had mutual feelings for each other. Why were they being so polite?Maybe Qu Zhi had some concerns and might even hold back until their wedding day....No, she needed to come up with a way to devour this man.Judging from Qu Zhi's behavior, if she took the initiative, he probably wouldn't be able to resist!Just as Zheng Baozhu was thinking this, Zhou Xiaonan sent her a message: Are you back? Remember to exercise before sleeping.\"...\"Zheng Baozhu replied cheekily: Does that kind of exercise count?Zhou Xiaonan: ???Zhou Xiaonan: Did I disturb something?Zheng Baozhu: Not really.Zhou Xiaonan: ? Is it that you're not interested, or is it Qu Zhi?Zheng Baozhu: \u00a0It's not that. If you don't have anything else, I'm going for a non-aerobic workout.Zhou Xiaonan: Weren't you featured in a magazine a while ago? The pre-sale for the issue will start the day after tomorrow, and they'll give you a solo link.Zheng Baozhu: ...The timing is perfect.Zhou Xiaonan: Tell me about it. Your popularity has soared in the past two days, and they want to sell more copies. Don't forget to repost on Weibo tomorrow.Zheng Baozhu: Okay.The magazine feature Zheng Baozhu shot was just a page with a short interview, but the main sales didn't rely solely on that. However, the photoshoot turned out beautifully, which made it quite appealing. Originally, the magazine had no plans to include Zheng Baozhu's poster, but her popularity skyrocketed too fast. To attract more buyers, the magazine decided to add her poster as a last-minute bonus.The pre-sale started at noon, and soon, the inventory set was sold out in less than half a minute. Those who missed out rushed to the magazine's blog to question whether there was a limited quantity and why they didn't announce it earlier.The magazine was also feeling unjustified. Their inventory was set based on the typical sales level of magazines featuring stars over the past few years, and they didn't expect it to sell out so quickly. After receiving the feedback, the magazine hurriedly adjusted the inventory, this time setting it at 990,000 copies. This should be enough to avoid running out.Seeing that the magazine was available for purchase again, those who were complaining shifted their focus. To make up for their earlier mistake, the magazine even specially made a sales poster for Zheng Baozhu and promoted it on Weibo.With the success of Zheng Baozhu's magazine sales, the haters couldn't sit still. They alternated between mocking her for relying on speculative investments and mocking her for being naive enough to be used as a tool for speculation.However, Zheng Baozhu didn't pay too much attention to this matter. She had always been clear about her goals and wanted to be an actress. The magazine's success was just a bonus and she didn't rely on it to make a living. She thanked everyone for their support on Weibo and then shifted her focus back to the script.Recently, she had been studying the script on her own, and whenever she had questions, she would consult with Teacher Ge during classes. She even added the screenwriter on WeChat and bothered him from time to time.Although the screenwriter had complained about Zheng Baozhu to Gao Boyun before, he admired her dedication as an actress.Soon, the second script reading session was scheduled, and many actors attended, including representatives from the production company. Lin Ziqin, the male lead, also dutifully attended the script reading. Seeing everyone's seriousness, Zheng Baozhu felt more assured because making a TV drama wasn't a solo effort; it required everyone's collective effort to do well.During the script reading, everyone had different interpretations of the script, but the overall atmosphere was good. Afterward, Gao Boyun invited several key actors and creators to have dinner. The representatives from the production company who attended the reading were also present at the dinner that was held at Tianxia Restaurant.\"Baobao, I noticed that Yu Wei has been watching you,\" Gao Boyun quietly told Zheng Baozhu at the dinner table, \"Be careful, I'm afraid he's taken an interest in you.\"Zheng Baozhu also noticed that Yu Wei had been glancing at her. He even deliberately toasted her earlier. She responded quietly to Gao Boyun, \"Who is this person?\"\"He's from the Yu family,\" Gao Boyun whispered, using his hand to block the conversation, \"But you don't need to worry. The Yu family's influence in the company is not absolute anymore. Their CEO, Song Nanchuan, is very capable.\"\"Oh... I think I've heard of him. Isn't he a celebrity's husband?\"\"Yes.\"Gao Boyun nodded, and Yu Wei, who was nearby, interrupted them, \"Director Gao, what secret conversation are you having with our lead actress? Is there something we can't hear?\"\"Of course not,\" Gao Boyun smiled, \"I was just feeling a bit unwell and asked Baozhu if she could have a few drinks for me.\"\"But that's not acceptable. As a man, how can you let someone else drink on your behalf?\" Yu Wei raised his wine glass again, \"Let's all have another toast together.\"Everyone at the table raised their glasses for another toast. Meanwhile, Gao Boyun discreetly sent a message to Zheng Baozhu: Yu Wei doesn't have a good reputation in the industry. He often mingles with internet celebrities. Be cautious around him.After Zheng Baozhu replied with a \"Got it\", she received a message from Qu Zhi: Are you still at dinner?Zheng Baozhu: Yes.Qu Zhi: Are you drinking?Zheng Baozhu: Yes.Qu Zhi: I'll come pick you up. Wait for me.Zheng Baozhu smiled and put her phone aside. Since Lin Ziqin had another engagement the next day, he suggested leaving early. Zheng Baozhu followed his lead and stood up, saying she also needed to leave.Yu Wei tried to persuade them to stay for a while, but seeing their firm attitude, he also decided to leave.Ignoring him, Zheng Baozhu walked out of the private room, called her assistant to bring the car out, and prepared to wait for Qu Zhi in the car. However, Yu Wei caught up with her and said, \"Miss Zheng, where are you going? How about I give you a ride?\"\"No need, I have my assistant.\" Zheng Baozhu smiled at him and continued walking forward.Yu Wei still followed her, \"Don't be so distant. How about we have a few more drinks? I have some friends coming out, and we can go to KTV.\"\"Really, Mr. Yu, I have work tomorrow,\" Zheng Baozhu replied as they walked outside Tianxia Restaurant, but couldn't shake off Yu Wei. Her assistant had already brought the car out, and seeing Zheng Baozhu being pestered by a man, the assistant opened the car door and walked over, \"Miss Baozhu, you can get in the car first.\"\"Okay.\"Zheng Baozhu nodded and was about to get into the car when her arm was pulled by Yu Wei, \"Miss Zheng, don't be so disrespectful. You're not famous yet, and you're already ignoring the investors?\"Frowning, Zheng Baozhu pulled her hand back, looked at him, and said, \"Mr. Yu, the investors put money into the drama, not me. If you have any requests, you can talk to Director Gao.\"Yu Wei sneered, thinking that she didn't know what was good for her, \"Are you suggesting that I invest in you? Well, I can do that, can't I?\"Zheng Baozhu also sneered, about to tell him to use that money to fix his own brain when Qu Zhi's voice came from the side, \"Baozhu.\"Before Yu Wei could react, Qu Zhi had already approached them. Zheng Baozhu was surprised at how quickly he arrived. Qu Zhi pulled her towards him and looked at Yu Wei, \"Who is this?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"Oh, he's Yu Wei from Huanyu Pictures, one of the investors in our drama.\"\"Mr. Yu, right?\" Qu Zhi's tone was cold, \"I am Baozhu's boyfriend. Thanks for sending her out.\"After saying that, without waiting for Yu Wei's response, he directly pulled Zheng Baozhu away. The assistant followed them and quickly got into the car, not daring to delay for even a second before driving away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng Baozhu was not the type of mainstream\u00a0celebrity with a massive following, so she wasn't immediately catapulted to the top of the trending list when news about her having a boyfriend emerged. A marketing account released a screenshot of a chat between a netizen and themselves, along with a photo.In the photo, Zheng Baozhu was holding hands with a man, both dressed elegantly, and their relationship seemed extraordinary at first glance.This was like dropping a stone in water and soon someone recognized the male lead.\u300cIsn't this someone from Zheng Baozhu's studio? Wasn't he the one who left with her last time, escaping from the reporters? [eating popcorn]\u300d\u300cYeah, it seems to be that handsome guy! They are a CP couple too!\u300dVarious CP fans noticed the news and discussions about them kept increasing, pushing them up to the tenth place on the trending list. Zheng Baozhu had been busy all day and had just laid down on her bed after applying a face mask when she received a call from Zhou Xiaonan: \"You and Qu Zhi have been exposed. The trending rank is still climbing.\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback. She hadn't expected such a small star like her would receive so much attention.\"I saw the photo. It was taken at the wedding you and Qu Zhi attended last time,\" Zhou Xiaonan said, sitting in front of the computer, looking at the enlarged picture on the screen, \"It's an indoor shot, not like paparazzi photos. It's probably taken by guests at the scene.\"\"Oh, that...\" Zheng Baozhu put the call on speaker and also opened Weibo to see the photos that the marketing account had posted. The picture was taken in a private room where they were gathering with their high school classmates. Zheng Baozhu was speechless, \"Everyone in that private room was our high school alumni. We greeted them when we arrived. I can understand them taking photos of me, but why did they send it to a marketing account??\"\"They did it on purpose to stir up trouble,\" Zhou Xiaonan said, \"Do you have any enemies among your high school classmates?\"\"Come on, how could anyone have a grudge against me?\"\"...\"Zhou Xiaonan fell silent for a moment and then said, \"Well, it's not worth investigating. Let's discuss how to respond.\"Zheng Baozhu thought that only A-list celebrities needed to deal with this kind of life, but she didn't expect even a minor star like her would have to do this, \"I don't really mind, but I'm not sure if Qu Zhi minds. I'll ask him first.\"\"Alright,\" Zhou Xiaonan knew that Qu Zhi was engaged in scientific research; people of this kind often valued their reputation and were reluctant to be associated with the entertainment industry. If Qu Zhi wasn't Zheng Baozhu's old classmate, the two of them might not have gotten together.Zheng Baozhu hung up the phone and sent all the Weibo screenshots to Qu Zhi. Qu Zhi replied promptly, \"I don't mind. You can handle it however you like, and I'll cooperate.\"Zheng Baozhu chuckled and quickly edited the text in the chatbox: \"I'm afraid it's not good for the image of you researchers dating a celebrity.\"Qu Zhi: What era are we living in? Don't hold on to such professional discrimination.Zheng Baozhu: Hahaha, then should I just admit it?Zheng Baozhu: But I'll blur out your information!Qu Zhi: ...Just don't make me look like a wanted criminal.Zheng Baozhu: Nonsense! You're such a handsome wanted criminal, you won't be able to hide for more than two days before being recognized by the public!As soon as she sent this message, Zheng Baozhu's phone vibrated. It was Qu Zhi calling her. She peeled off the face mask on her face and answered the call, \"Qu Zhi?\"\"Yes,\" Qu Zhi's gentle voice came from the other end, \"Why are you still up so late? During dinner, you were about to fall asleep.\"\"I got distracted by the trending news again,\" Zheng Baozhu said, lying on her pillow while talking to him, \"Why are you still awake?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"I'm still working on my paper.\"\"Wow, as expected of you,\" Zheng Baozhu praised, \"You go ahead and continue writing. I won't disturb you. I'll handle the trending issue.\"\"Okay, you should get some sleep too,\" Qu Zhi's usually cold voice sounded warm in the night, \"Don't stay up too late. Goodnight.\"\"Goodnight.\" Zheng Baozhu hung up the phone, and her lips couldn't help but curl up. Feeling good, she opened WeChat to send a message to Zhou Xiaonan, \"Qu Zhi doesn't mind, so how about we just admit it? After all, I'm not trying to gain popularity and rely on hype.\"Although Zheng Baozhu had not been in the entertainment industry before, based on her everyday experiences as a netizen, she knew that the public was more accepting of female celebrities dating. Fortunately, she was a female celebrity.Zheng Baozhu: This way, Lin Ziqin's fans won't say that I'm intentionally hyping the CP anymore! Besides, I can see my and Qu Zhi's CP super-topic skyrocketing, everyone is celebrating.Zhou Xiaonan: ... You're right, but remember that celebrities also have careers. Unexpected, right? Not only do you have a career, but you've also started making it public on your super-topic.Zheng Baozhu: ...Quickly, she clicked into her super-topic, and at the top was a declaration from one of her fans:Bringing Happiness to the Entertainment Circle: Zheng Baozhu, you really disappoint me.\u00a0 I've been following you since you were just an extra. Seeing you go from being an extra to playing Ye Ling, I can't express how happy I am.\u00a0 Since you currently don't have any projects released, do you not realize how much you've been criticized?\u00a0 Because you have no projects, people mock you for accepting endorsements and doing magazine shoots.\u00a0 I was waiting for your project to be released so I could see those crtics eat their words, but guess what? Sorry, I got my face slapped first.\u00a0 Why do you have to handle men now? Instead of focusing on your career, you're focusing on men.\u00a0 Well, goodbye.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"It turns out that there are people who care about her career even more than she does.But there's no conflict between pursuing a career and dating a man! Besides, she never even handled any men!There were many comments like this, questioning Zheng Baozhu's focus on men rather than her career. In her Super Topic, others were advising her differently, saying that her performance in the trailer for [New Moon Wuxin Sword] showed great potential and that she would surely achieve a lot in the future.Then there was a reply that said: Indeed, she has great potential, but during the initial stages of her career, she's already busy with men. Does she even have any ambition for her career?Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"How come there are no replies now? Today, my back aches and I feel exhausted, not because of men, but because of my career!Zheng Baozhu replied to Zhou Xiaonan's message: With my current popularity, it shouldn't have caused me to trend, right?Zhou Xiaonan: ...Zheng Baozhu: Forget it, when should we respond?Zhou Xiaonan: The studio is currently working on the statement. Once it's ready, we'll send it to you.Zheng Baozhu: How about we do it tomorrow instead? Staying up late is tiring.Zhou Xiaonan: ...You seem to be very open-minded about this.Zheng Baozhu replied with an emoji and noticed she had been added to a group chat. The group was created by Wei Yu, consisting of twelve members.It happened to be the ten people who attended the wedding plus the bride and groom.Meng Yaxin privately messaged Zheng Baozhu: I added both you and Qu Zhi to the group. Wei Yu and the others want to find out who leaked the photos online.Zheng Baozhu: Ah, it's not necessary actually, as we won't have any further contact anyway.Meng Yaxin: No, I saw many people talking about it in your Super Topic! I checked the photos, and the person who took them must be among us!Meanwhile, the group chat became lively, with Wei Yu asking who leaked the photos to the marketing account, maintaining a relatively composed and rational tone. After he spoke, nobody in the group owned up to it. But then the bride, Yang Li, stepped in, and her tone was not as kind as Wei Yu's.Yang Li: The photos were clearly taken in a private room, and you are all Wei Yu's old classmates. We invited Zheng Baozhu to attend the wedding, yet someone backstabbed her behind her back. Isn't it inappropriate? How can we face her now? And you, who took the photos and sent them to the marketing account, are you deliberately trying to cause trouble? And you still claim to be old classmates? Huh? If you have the guts to do it, don't be timid now. This is already a violation of privacy!The group fell silent for a moment, and Zheng Baozhu was about to step in to mediate, but then Li Huixin suddenly spoke up: It's not me. Although I have some conflicts with Zheng Baozhu, I wouldn't do something so low-class.After the discussion, one after another, all eight people in the private room, excluding Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi, denied leaking the photos.Qu Zhi: The way you all are talking, it seems like we leaked it ourselves.Zheng Baozhu:Zheng Baozhu: Aren't you supposed to be writing your thesis? Continue writing it instead.Qu Zhi: Aren't you also not sleeping? You said goodnight but kept playing on your phone.Meng Yaxin: ??? You two can have your show here as well?Meng Yaxin: Be careful; it might screenshot your conversation and send it to the marketing account.Zheng Baozhu blinked; \"it\" was a fitting term.Her phone received a friend request, and to her surprise, it was from Li Huixin. After accepting it, Li Huixin began typing messages rapidly.Li Huixin: I know you probably suspect me the most, but it really wasn't me who leaked the photos.\u00a0 Whether you believe it or not, if I didn't do it, I won't admit it. I will definitely find out the truth and won't take the blame for that person.Zheng Baozhu: =.= I never said it was you.Li Huixin: You didn't say it, but I know you're thinking that.\u00a0 I'll contact you after I find out more.Li Huixin had always been someone who took things seriously, especially when it came to matters related to Zheng Baozhu. Back when they were studying, Zheng Baozhu noticed Li Huixin didn't like her and even considered her as a rival, so they didn't interact much.Zheng Baozhu told Qu Zhi about it, and he replied: If we want to investigate, it's actually quite easy. Based on the angle of the photo, we can deduce where the photographer was sitting. I remember that Zhang Lei was sitting in that direction.Zheng Baozhu: ??? You remember where each person was sitting?Qu Zhi: I glanced around when we entered.Zheng Baozhu: ...Ah, is it him? The one you mentioned.Qu Zhi lightly chuckled and replied: Versailles.Zheng Baozhu: Yes.\u00a0 But the person taking the photo might not necessarily have been sitting in that position.Qu Zhi: The angle of the photo should indicate that it was taken while sitting, but it's not impossible that he changed his seat. However, in my memory, most people didn't change their positions.Qu Zhi: Of course, I am just speculating, not saying it's definitely him. But if you want to investigate, you can start with him.Qu Zhi: Is Zhang Lei your secret admirer?\u00a0 Has he written a letter to you?Zheng Baozhu: ??? Why are you feeling so jealous? Why don't you say he's your secret admirer?Qu Zhi: Let's forget about it. We'll talk about this in person tomorrow. You should go to sleep now.Zheng Baozhu sent him a hundred yellow-faced smiling emojis: I've received countless smiles tonight, don't send me any more.\u00a0 Giving them back to you.Qu Zhi held his phone, chuckled, and lowered his head.Zheng Baozhu: They said I am busy handling men instead of focusing on my career , but in fact, I never had done it at least once in my life![Zheng Baozhu retracted the message]Qu Zhi: I saw it.Zheng Baozhu pretended to be dead.After a while, she heard the doorbell ring and hesitated for a moment. Then, she received a message from Qu Zhi on her phone.\"Open the door.\"\"...?\" Zheng Baozhu put on her slippers and got out of bed to open the door for Qu Zhi. He was also wearing slippers and his shirt was only buttoned at the center.Zheng Baozhu stood at the door and swallowed nervously, \"What are you doing so late at night?\"Qu Zhi said, \"Sleeping.\"\"...Ah?\"Zheng Baozhu couldn't believe how things had turned out. Qu Zhi, dressed in sleepwear, was sitting on her bed, looking as if he was ready to go to sleep, \"I've already taken a shower, so let's go to sleep.\"\"???\" Zheng Baozhu was incredulous, \"Why are you sleeping here?\"Qu Zhi leaned against the headboard and looked at her with a half-smile, \"Didn't you say you haven't...\"\"Ah ah ah ah ah!\" Zheng Baozhu cut him off sharply, \"Don't say it!\"\"Alright, I won't say it,\" Qu Zhi's corner of the mouth was still slightly curved as he calmly observed Zheng Baozhu standing by the bed, \"So, are you not planning to sleep?\"\"...\"Why are you sleeping here? Qu Zhi's audacity once again challenged Zheng Baozhu's understanding. How can he remain so composed and not blush or skip a heartbeat? \"Aren't you still working on your thesis?\"\"Well, I'll write it tomorrow. It's already late tonight.\"\"...Oh.\" Zheng Baozhu reflected on herself in her mind. Why was she afraid? Isn't it just handling men? What's there to be afraid of!She quickly lay down on the other side and instructed Qu Zhi, \"Turn off the light.\"As expected, the main character, Qu Zhi, became unnatural again. He agreed and turned off the light in the room before lying down next to Zheng Baozhu. Her heart was pounding rapidly, even in the darkness, Qu Zhi's presence was entwined with her, impossible to ignore.She felt stiff, not daring to move. Suddenly, she heard Qu Zhi's light laughter in her ear, followed by him embracing her, \"Don't be afraid, I don't plan to do anything. I just suddenly wanted to hold you and sleep.\"\"Uh...\" Zheng Baozhu responded slightly stiffly. Although she had known Qu Zhi for a long time, it was still the first time they shared a bed.Qu Zhi whispered in her ear, \"But if you want to do something to me, I won't resist.\"\"...\"Really, is that so? Zheng Baozhu was a bit startled. She turned over to face Qu Zhi and wrapped her arms around his waist.Qu Zhi murmured in her ear, \"Only this?\"\"What else do you want?\" Zheng Baozhu raised her head to look at him, her eyes sparkling in the darkness.Qu Zhi lowered his head and kissed her for a while, hugging her a bit tighter, \"You can hug me more.\"Zheng Baozhu moved closer to him again, resting her head on his chest. Qu Zhi's voice came from above, \"Baozhu, lift your head.\"\"What for?\" Zheng Baozhu raised her eyes to look at him. Qu Zhi kissed the tip of her nose and spoke hoarsely, \"What do you think? Some people only dare to talk but not to act.\"\"...\"Zheng Baozhu stubbornly said, \"How am I not daring enough?\"She raised her head and started kissing Qu Zhi's forehead to his temple and finally reached the thin lips that often said sweet words. Qu Zhi's fingers combed through her hair, holding the back of her head, and deepened the kiss.Suddenly, Zheng Baozhu felt that handling men was quite enjoyable.When Qu Zhi finally let go, she was already short of breath. Qu Zhi chuckled at her disheveled appearance and softly said, \"Alright, you're too tired today. Go to sleep.\"Zheng Baozhu glared at him, realizing that he had really come just to sleep with her.Sensing her gaze, Qu Zhi raised an eyebrow, \"Or do you want to continue?\"Zheng Baozhu quickly closed her eyes.Qu Zhi silently smirked and closed his eyes as well.When Zheng Baozhu woke up, she found herself alone on the bed. Sitting up, she ran her hand through her hair, pondering if last night was just a dream.\"Awake?\" Qu Zhi came out of the bathroom, still wearing the same sleepwear from last night, except this time it was even more revealing, with the only button unbuttoned.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Oh, knowing it wasn't a dream puts her mind at ease.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"What are you smiling\u00a0foolishly at me for?\" Qu Zhi came out after washing up and saw Zheng Baozhu sitting on the bed smiling at him, so he couldn't help but smile too.Zheng Baozhu grinned and said, \"Your figure looks really good.\"\"Oh,\" Qu Zhi responded calmly, \"No wonder you're drooling.\"\"...\" Almost subconsciously, Zheng Baozhu raised her hand to her mouth to make sure she wasn't drooling, then glared at Qu Zhi, \"You!\"Qu Zhi walked over, propped his hand on the bed, and leaned over to kiss her forehead, \"I woke up late today; I have to go to the company. You can sleep a bit more.\"Looking up, Zheng Baozhu casually wrapped her arms around his slim waist, \"I won't sleep anymore; I need to deal with yesterday's mess.\"Qu Zhi lifted her head and said, \"Then I'll make breakfast for you.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu replied and went to wash up in the bathroom. When she came out, Qu Zhi was no longer there, but there was breakfast from the restaurant on the table. She walked over and picked up a glass of milk, took a sip, and as she sat down on the sofa, she received a message from Zhou Xiaonan: Are you up? The PR team finished writing the draft. Take a look, and if there are no issues, I'll have them post it.Zheng Baozhu opened and looked at the drafted statement. The statement was concise and clear, acknowledging Zheng Baozhu's relationship with Qu Zhi and clarifying that the previous internet rumors about \"Qu Zhi being a member of Zheng Baozhu's studio\" were false. It also urged everyone not to excessively focus on artists' personal lives and finally condemned the person who leaked private photos, reserving the right to pursue legal action.The statement was well-written and comprehensive. Zheng Baozhu felt there were no problems and replied to Zhou Xiaonan with an \"OK\" emoji.With the approval, the studio's official Weibo quickly posted the statement, complete with the official stamp. Netizens seemed to be waiting for this response, as a flood of comments appeared as soon as the Weibo was published. Of course, there were supporters defending Zheng Baozhu, encouraging everyone to focus on her work. However, there were also some comments challenging her, questioning what work she had to be focused on.\"...Hmph!\" Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but laugh in exasperation. Even though her works hadn't been released yet, the photoshoots she had done were also part of her work. Taking beautiful photos for magazine spreads was also challenging and required a lot of acting skills. It's not like she could just stand there and call it a day!But she knew arguing with netizens about this was pointless. As long as her projects weren't released, they would use this to criticize her every day. After calming her mind while sitting on the sofa, she decided to repost the statement on her own Weibo and added some additional clarifications.Zheng Baozhu V: Mr. Qu and I have been childhood sweethearts since we were very young. After he graduated from high school, he studied abroad and only returned to the country at the end of last year. We only got together recently. He is not from the entertainment industry, so I don't want to share too much information about him. I can only say that he is even busier with work than I am, so please don't worry that my relationship will affect my work. \u00a0I believe a competent adult can balance work and personal life. Thank you all for your concern ^^.After posting her Weibo, the comments poured in even more intensely than the studio's post. While people knew that she was in a relationship with Qu Zhi, they didn't expect them to be childhood sweethearts! The popularity of their CP pairing skyrocketed, and under Zheng Baozhu's Weibo post, people enthusiastically explained the details of Qu Zhi's background.\u300cMr. Qu is involved in scientific research. He and Baozhu attended a charity gala together before, and it even trended. At that time, not many people paid attention to Baozhu, so some of you might not know about it. If you're interested, here's the [Link]!\u300d\u300cMr. Qu is truly handsome, kind-hearted, and intelligent! He's a perfect match for our Baozhu! He even gave a charity lecture at an elementary school before. Check it out! [Link]\u300d\u300cWuwuwu! childhood sweethearts are so adorable! Mom, I finally get to see this for real!\u00a0\u300d\u300cSisters, our brother-in-law is not only handsome but also highly intelligent. He's a rare find! And they've been childhood sweethearts! How can we not be excited about this? \u00a0And they are a perfect match!\u300d\u300cBaozhu has good taste in men! Mr. Qu is amazing! \u300dZheng Baozhu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Ah, she felt like Qu Zhi was even more popular than herself!Aside from these highly praised comments, there were also some negative remarks, but Zheng Baozhu knew she couldn't please everyone. Although some of the comments upset her, she believed that as more of her works release one by one, there would be more viewers who would appreciate her work.As she was thinking about this, her phone buzzed again; it was Meng Yaxin sending her a new message.Meng Yaxin: I saw your Weibo. Are you admitting now that you and Qu Zhi are childhood sweethearts? Weren't you always calling him your enemy before?Zheng Baozhu: Everything changes with time, people are no exception.Meng Yaxin: \u2026\u2026Huh, people.Zheng Baozhu: I'm not going to argue with you. I need to read the script now!Zheng Baozhu wasn't making up an excuse to avoid Meng Yaxin; she genuinely had to read the script. [The Pursuit of the Heart] had already released the official casting poster and was recruiting actors for some roles that had not been finalized yet. Gao Boyun had scheduled a time to hold a script-reading session with them.During the script reading session, apart from the director and screenwriter, the cinematographer, sound recorder, producer, and main actors were all present, even including Lin Ziqin. Zheng Baozhu thought that someone as busy and popular as him probably wouldn't attend a script reading, but now it seemed that Lin Ziqin valued the quality of the performance more than making money.It was Zheng Baozhu's first time attending a script reading session, and she was a bit nervous. It felt a bit like when she used to stand up and read texts in front of the teacher. Due to time constraints, they only selected a few scenes for the script reading and discussion. After a few hours, they gained a lot.After this period of settling down, the news about Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi gradually faded from the internet, and the situation stabilized. Fans of the CP and ordinary fans didn't interfere with each other.During the relatively quiet period in the entertainment industry, [The Pursuit of the Heart] officially announced its main cast.Lin Ziqin was currently the top male artist in the industry, and all aspects of his life were under scrutiny. When [The Pursuit of the Heart] first contacted him, rumors about him playing the male lead in the drama surfaced online. However, since the production team hadn't made an official announcement, they pretended not to know.Various versions of the casting for the male lead were circulating, including mentions of Zheng Baozhu. If the rumors about Lin Ziqin playing the male lead hadn't been leaked, there wouldn't have been so much attention on the male lead role. After all, this was an original script and not a drama based on a popular IP. However, because Lin Ziqin had a huge following, the male lead role had been closely watched.Unexpectedly, without any signs or preparation, the production team finally made an official announcement today![The Pursuit of the Heart]\u00a0official Weibo account had been active for some time, previously only posting casting calls. Today, alongside the announcement of the male lead, they also released two characters' official photos.TV drama - The Pursuit of the Heart: He is the legendary businessman Duan Lanying in the Republic of China, played by Lin Ziqin, who walks between the dark and light, and nobody can guess his heart. She is the wealthy daughter, Zhao Jinghong, played by Zheng Baozhu, who hides her true feelings behind innocence, but a single glimpse reveals her stunning beauty. In that era, how will their fates intertwine? What will happen to national grudges and family hatred? Welcome to watch the Republic of China's commercial war drama [The Pursuit of the Heart].Although this promotional message is full of clich\u00e9s, people don't care to criticize it because the four makeup photos below are all stunning.The production team released four makeup photos at once, two for each of the male lead and female lead. In one set, Lin Ziqin wore a Republic of China-style gown with delicate embroidery, showing an elegant scholarly temperament; in the other set, he wore a fitted suit with meticulous workmanship, exuding a powerful aura.As for Zheng Baozhu, one set featured a lively and cute sundress, perfectly combining the charm and grace of a wealthy young lady. The other set showcased an intricately embroidered dark red cheongsam, matched with a refined updo and stunning makeup, exuding a sense of dangerous allure.Both actors demonstrated strong rendition skills, and the two sets of photos showcased completely different auras, but the only common point was that they looked incredibly attractive!Lin Ziqin and Zheng Baozhu's fans went crazy in the comments; Lin Ziqin fans were too busy being ecstatic to even remember to complain about the casting choice.As for the Lin Ziqin and Zheng Baozhu CP, it was rejuvenated! After Zheng Baozhu publicly announced her relationship with Qu Zhi, their CP momentum declined, and many people stopped discussing it in their fan communities. But now, their CP fans were back in full force, celebrating as if it were New Year's.In celebration of this historic moment, they even applied for a new fan community, [ZhengQiLinRan] (Zheng Baozhu's energy and Lin Ziqin's charisma). It perfectly suited their current revitalized and radiant spirits!Zheng Baozhu, busy replying to comments, suddenly noticed that the CP [ZhengQiLinRan] had unexpectedly resurged. Compared to Qu Zhi, who was presented as her brother-in-law, Zheng Baozhu's solo fans definitely had a lower opinion of Lin Ziqin. Any association with Lin Ziqin would subject them to his fans' scrutiny and criticism. As for the CP fans of Qu Zhi-Zheng Baozhu, this surge in another CP was even more unbearable for them. How could Qu Zhi, their brother-in-law, lose face like that?So they also applied for a new fan community, [MingZhengQu] (Bright Zheng Qu). They were confidently proclaiming that they were the perfect match!Amidst the ongoing battle between CP fan communities, some people noticed that Zheng Baozhu's career had secretly made a comeback.Bringing Happiness to the Entertainment Circle: Ahhhh! Baozhu is awesome!!! Her acting skills are so strong!!! This drama will definitely be a big hit!!! Baozhu, fighting!\u300cOh, if I remember correctly, you were the one who wrote the short essay back then, right? [Picking nose]\u300d\u300cHaha, the shortest time in history! It seems no one can escape the 'true fragrance' law! \u300d\u300cWelcome to the sit-up live event, I am a reporter in the front. \u300dBecause there were too many comments, the person with the username [Bringing Happiness to the Entertainment Circle] posted another message.\u300cHello everyone, I am back. \u300dAfter this user's comment, many others also returned, all attracted back by Zheng Baozhu's two photos. Zheng Baozhu getting the lead role undoubtedly injected a booster shot for them. Zheng Baozhu Weibo also saw an increase in followers. Her followers were close to breaking eight million in just a blink of an eye, jokingly saying that at this rate, she would directly reach ten million followers soon.The drama team also had the male lead post a Weibo, and soon, Zheng Baozhu's Weibo was flooded with fans praising them as a perfect match.\"Sister Xiaonan, am I going to become popular?\" Zheng Baozhu excitedly jumped to Zhou Xiaonan, holding her phone. Although Zhou Xiaonan was also happy, she remained calm and reminded her, \"You'll only become popular if you act well. If you don't, you might just get burned.\"\"...\"Did Sister Xiaonan borrow this line from Qu Zhi?\"Also, fans of Lin Ziqin think your popularity is not enough...\"Before Zhou Xiaonan could finish, Zheng Baozhu interrupted, \"But there are others who think I look super attractive!\"\"Hmm,\" If Zheng Baozhu's makeup photo didn't have such a good effect, she would have already been criticized by Lin Ziqin's fans, \"Just remember to stay grounded and focus on your acting. Besides Lin Ziqin's fans, there are other celebrities' fans who are also nitpicking. If you mess up, they'll be the first to laugh at you.\"\"I know, I'll do my best in acting!\" The official filming was scheduled to start in October, and they would be going to another city since City A's film studio's Republican-era street wasn't as extensive as H City's.Before the official shooting, Gao Boyun arranged for another script reading session next month, and more actors would participate in this one.Feeling happy, Zheng Baozhu invited the staff from her studio to dinner, and she also invited Qu Zhi along. Qu Zhi didn't like these team-building activities, but he was afraid that Zheng Baozhu might drink too much alone outside, so he rushed over to join them.Zheng Baozhu booked two large private rooms at Tianxia Restaurant. The partition between the rooms could be removed to create a super-large private space. The studio's staff had grown in number, so two large tables were fully occupied.Qu Zhi arrived later as he was coming back from work. Zheng Baozhu originally thought of having everyone start eating without waiting for him, but it turned out that their attention was more focused on Qu Zhi.With everyone's eager anticipation, Qu Zhi was finally led into the private room. As the door opened, dozens of eyes immediately fell on him. Qu Zhi's steps paused for a moment, then he walked towards Zheng Baozhu and said, \"Sorry, I just got off work, that's why I'm late.\"\"Not at all, we're already happy that you could come,\" Zhou Xiaonan, as a representative, stood up to welcome Qu Zhi, \"Come, sit here next to Baozhu, we've reserved a seat for you.\"\"Thank you,\" Qu Zhi thanked them and took a seat next to Zheng Baozhu.Everyone's eyes were still fixed on him as he and Zheng Baozhu settled down.Zheng Baozhu thought that being stared at by her staff in the hotel was already awkward enough, but now she realized that it wasn't; this was even more awkward. :)\"Uh, well...\" Zheng Baozhu said to the waiter by the door, \"Since everyone's here, let's start serving the dishes.\"\"Sure,\" the waiter nodded and went out to arrange the dishes.Zheng Baozhu coughed lightly and said to Qu Zhi, \"Let me introduce you. These two are my assistants, you've met them before. Here are our colleagues from the business department, here are the public relations team, here is the finance department, administration, legal, and promotion...\"One by one, Zheng Baozhu introduced the departments of her studio to Qu Zhi. After listening, Qu Zhi smiled and commented, \"Although it's small, it's well-rounded.\"Seeing his smile, two of the colleagues cheered, and when Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi looked over, one of them, the lively administrative staff, boldly said, \"Brother-in-law looks so handsome, even more handsome than in the photos! And he's smiling at our boss!\"Now everyone started to smile ambiguously. Zheng Baozhu had to steady her emotions and not let her face turn red amid their laughter, \"What's so strange about him smiling at me? You guys haven't seen the world!\"\"Exactly, exactly!\" Another colleague chimed in, teasingly, \"It's nothing for him to smile, considering your relationship! Miss Baozhu is right. We just haven't seen the world!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"What kind of words were these?Fortunately, the waiter quickly brought the dishes, and everyone was occupied with eating.After drinking some wine, when they were leaving, Zheng Baozhu playfully clung to Qu Zhi, asking him to carry her, \"Carry me, if you don't carry me, I won't leave.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Her colleagues nearby were understanding and said, \"We'll leave now, we didn't see anything!\"Zheng Baozhu still held onto Qu Zhi's sleeve. With a sigh, Qu Zhi squatted down in front of her and said, \"Climb up.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her hands wrapped around Qu Zhi's neck and she was holding a bunch of flowers that she somehow got from inside the private room.Qu Zhi stood up with her on his back and looked at the flowers in his hand, asking, \"Where did these flowers come from?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"I just took them from the private room.\"\"...You just took them without asking?\"The nearby waiter overheard their conversation and smiled, \"It's okay. If Miss Zheng likes it, consider it a gift.\"\"Did you hear that? They said it's a gift for me,\" Zheng Baozhu proudly shook the flowers in front of Qu Zhi. He reached back to grab her hand and gently pulled it away, warning her, \"Be careful not to fall.\"Following his warning, Zheng Baozhu obediently held onto his shoulders, picked a flower from the bouquet, and gently tucked it into Qu Zhi's hair without him noticing. The waiter on the side couldn't help but stifle a laugh. Zheng Baozhu turned her head and made a \"shush\" gesture.The waiter nodded, not saying a word. Qu Zhi carried Zheng Baozhu on his back all the way out of Tianxia Restaurant to where their car was waiting. After the assistant brought Zheng Baozhu's car over, he poked his head out and asked Qu Zhi, \"Qu...\"Before he could say \"Mr. Qu\", his gaze was drawn to the little flower on Qu Zhi's head. Zheng Baozhu blinked playfully, and the assistant understood, pretending not to notice the flower on Qu Zhi's head, \"Mr. Qu, should I drive you back, or will you be driving Miss Baozhu home?\"Qu Zhi would probably choose the latter option because he didn't drink much that night, so he would want to drive Zheng Baozhu home.Qu Zhi indeed chose the latter option, \"You go back with everyone first, I'll drive Baozhu home.\"\"Alright,\" The assistant opened the car door and got out of the car. He glanced at the flower on Qu Zhi's head, smiling at him, \"Then I'll go back first. Take care of yourselves, Mr. Qu and Miss Baozhu.\"\"Okay,\" Qu Zhi nodded slightly, then turned to look at Zheng Baozhu, who was still clinging to him, \"Are you sober now? If you are, come down.\"\"Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu replied and jumped down from Qu Zhi's back. She consciously walked to the passenger seat, opened the door, and sat inside. Qu Zhi took the driver's seat, and as he did, he automatically closed the side door.Zheng Baozhu buckled her seatbelt, but she struggled to fasten it for a while and couldn't manage it. Qu Zhi frowned slightly, \"Let go, I'll do it.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu obediently released her grip. Qu Zhi leaned over and helped her buckle the seatbelt. Just as he was about to sit upright, he looked up and saw the flower on his head in the rearview mirror.\"... \" He remained silent for a while before looking at the mischievous person sitting beside him, \"Zheng Baozhu, did you do this?\"\"What's wrong?\" Zheng Baozhu innocently looked at him as if she just noticed the flower on his head, \"Oh, why do you have a flower on your head? It looks surprisingly good.\"\"Hmm,\" Qu Zhi gave a faint smile, looking at the flowers in Zheng Baozhu's hand, \"What happened to the bouquet you had earlier? How come it's just a twig now?\"Zheng Baozhu lowered her head to look at the twig in her hand, showing the same surprise, \"Yeah, where did my flowers go?\"\"...Childish,\" Qu Zhi said as he took the flower from his head and casually pinned it onto Zheng Baozhu's head, \"You look even better with it.\"\"Who says that? I think you look good with it,\" Zheng Baozhu replied confidently, \"Look at those men from ancient times; they all liked to wear flowers on their heads, right?\"\"They are who they are, and I am me,\" Qu Zhi fastened his own seatbelt, started the car, and said, \"Sit properly.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu sat properly in her seat, took out her phone, tilted her head, and took a few selfies, \"I look really pretty.\"Qu Zhi smiled and responded with a simple \"Hmm\".Zheng Baozhu then took a picture of Qu Zhi driving, put her phone away, leaned back on the seat, and closed her eyes, \"I'm a bit tired, I'll take a nap.\"\"Sure, wake up when we arrive.\"Qu Zhi set the navigation and the car moved steadily through the city's night scenery. As Qu Zhi drove smoothly, Zheng Baozhu unknowingly fell asleep. When she woke up again, the car was already parked in the garage.\"Are we here?\" Zheng Baozhu opened her eyes, sitting up.\"Yes,\" Qu Zhi unbuckled his seatbelt and replied, \"Sober now?\"Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow defiantly, \"I only had a little; I wasn't drunk to begin with!\"\"Oh, then pretending to be drunk and making me carry you on my back was intentional?\"\"What pretending? Clearly, you were the one who carried me!\"\"Is that so?\" Qu Zhi leaned closer; his dark eyes looked into hers. \"So, do I need to carry you to your hotel?\"Worried that he might really do it, Zheng Baozhu instinctively put her hand on his chest, \"I've told you; there are surveillance cameras here.\"Qu Zhi chuckled and distanced himself, \"Why are you so defensive? Are you thinking of something unhealthy?\"\"...\" You really know how to turn the tables!Zheng Baozhu opened the car door and got out along with Qu Zhi. Qu Zhi saw her walking steadily and reminded her, \"Go back and rest early.\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"I'll rest after Sister Xiaonan returns me some luck! Didn't you see how she kept watching me during dinner today?\"Hearing Zheng Baozhu's words, Qu Zhi burst into laughter. Indeed, during dinner, Zhou Xiaonan had been watching Zheng Baozhu closely, afraid that she would eat more than she should.\"I'll have to start filming soon, so I definitely can't gain weight,\" Zheng Baozhu patted her own stomach while realizing that as long as she had thick skin, even if her manager kept watching her, it wouldn't affect her eating, \"I'll go back and exercise for twenty minutes.\"Qu Zhi lightly laughed, \"It seems like I made the right choice with my gym. Your usage rate might end up higher than mine in the future.\"Qu Zhi's penthouse was almost finished with renovations, they should be able to move in officially by the next Chinese New Year.\"When you have time, we can go together to pick out the decorations,\" Qu Zhi suggested to Zheng Baozhu, \"Some furniture needs to be customized, so we need to select them in advance.\"\"Sure!\" Zheng Baozhu was very interested in decorating the house, especially since it was going to be her wedding house with Qu Zhi, \"Homeland City is a great place to shop; I could spend a whole day there.\"Qu Zhi raised an eyebrow teasingly, \"You are already a popular star with millions of fans. Won't people recognize you in Homeland City?\"\"I can do disguises!\" Zheng Baozhu replied confidently and then looked Qu Zhi up and down, \"But you also need to disguise yourself; many fans recognize you.\"As Zheng Baozhu spoke, she recalled the time when Qu Zhi's half-face went viral and topped the trending list as [How High Can an Average Person's Value Be?]They soon arrived at the door of Zheng Baozhu's room as they chatted. Since the last time Qu Zhi slept in her room, he hadn't been there again. Zheng Baozhu stopped at the door and looked at him, \"I'm here.\"Qu Zhi also stopped, glancing at Zheng Baozhu for a moment, and nodded lightly, \"Hmm, then I'll head back now?\"Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment and also nodded, \"Alright, goodnight.\"\"Goodnight,\" Qu Zhi bid her goodnight and walked towards his room. Once Zheng Baozhu was back in her room, she closed the door and stomped her foot in frustration!Ah, should she have invited Qu Zhi inside for a bit? They were both adults and had mutual feelings for each other. Why were they being so polite?Maybe Qu Zhi had some concerns and might even hold back until their wedding day....No, she needed to come up with a way to devour this man.Judging from Qu Zhi's behavior, if she took the initiative, he probably wouldn't be able to resist!Just as Zheng Baozhu was thinking this, Zhou Xiaonan sent her a message: Are you back? Remember to exercise before sleeping.\"...\"Zheng Baozhu replied cheekily: Does that kind of exercise count?Zhou Xiaonan: ???Zhou Xiaonan: Did I disturb something?Zheng Baozhu: Not really.Zhou Xiaonan: ? Is it that you're not interested, or is it Qu Zhi?Zheng Baozhu: \u00a0It's not that. If you don't have anything else, I'm going for a non-aerobic workout.Zhou Xiaonan: Weren't you featured in a magazine a while ago? The pre-sale for the issue will start the day after tomorrow, and they'll give you a solo link.Zheng Baozhu: ...The timing is perfect.Zhou Xiaonan: Tell me about it. Your popularity has soared in the past two days, and they want to sell more copies. Don't forget to repost on Weibo tomorrow.Zheng Baozhu: Okay.The magazine feature Zheng Baozhu shot was just a page with a short interview, but the main sales didn't rely solely on that. However, the photoshoot turned out beautifully, which made it quite appealing. Originally, the magazine had no plans to include Zheng Baozhu's poster, but her popularity skyrocketed too fast. To attract more buyers, the magazine decided to add her poster as a last-minute bonus.The pre-sale started at noon, and soon, the inventory set was sold out in less than half a minute. Those who missed out rushed to the magazine's blog to question whether there was a limited quantity and why they didn't announce it earlier.The magazine was also feeling unjustified. Their inventory was set based on the typical sales level of magazines featuring stars over the past few years, and they didn't expect it to sell out so quickly. After receiving the feedback, the magazine hurriedly adjusted the inventory, this time setting it at 990,000 copies. This should be enough to avoid running out.Seeing that the magazine was available for purchase again, those who were complaining shifted their focus. To make up for their earlier mistake, the magazine even specially made a sales poster for Zheng Baozhu and promoted it on Weibo.With the success of Zheng Baozhu's magazine sales, the haters couldn't sit still. They alternated between mocking her for relying on speculative investments and mocking her for being naive enough to be used as a tool for speculation.However, Zheng Baozhu didn't pay too much attention to this matter. She had always been clear about her goals and wanted to be an actress. The magazine's success was just a bonus and she didn't rely on it to make a living. She thanked everyone for their support on Weibo and then shifted her focus back to the script.Recently, she had been studying the script on her own, and whenever she had questions, she would consult with Teacher Ge during classes. She even added the screenwriter on WeChat and bothered him from time to time.Although the screenwriter had complained about Zheng Baozhu to Gao Boyun before, he admired her dedication as an actress.Soon, the second script reading session was scheduled, and many actors attended, including representatives from the production company. Lin Ziqin, the male lead, also dutifully attended the script reading. Seeing everyone's seriousness, Zheng Baozhu felt more assured because making a TV drama wasn't a solo effort; it required everyone's collective effort to do well.During the script reading, everyone had different interpretations of the script, but the overall atmosphere was good. Afterward, Gao Boyun invited several key actors and creators to have dinner. The representatives from the production company who attended the reading were also present at the dinner that was held at Tianxia Restaurant.\"Baobao, I noticed that Yu Wei has been watching you,\" Gao Boyun quietly told Zheng Baozhu at the dinner table, \"Be careful, I'm afraid he's taken an interest in you.\"Zheng Baozhu also noticed that Yu Wei had been glancing at her. He even deliberately toasted her earlier. She responded quietly to Gao Boyun, \"Who is this person?\"\"He's from the Yu family,\" Gao Boyun whispered, using his hand to block the conversation, \"But you don't need to worry. The Yu family's influence in the company is not absolute anymore. Their CEO, Song Nanchuan, is very capable.\"\"Oh... I think I've heard of him. Isn't he a celebrity's husband?\"\"Yes.\"Gao Boyun nodded, and Yu Wei, who was nearby, interrupted them, \"Director Gao, what secret conversation are you having with our lead actress? Is there something we can't hear?\"\"Of course not,\" Gao Boyun smiled, \"I was just feeling a bit unwell and asked Baozhu if she could have a few drinks for me.\"\"But that's not acceptable. As a man, how can you let someone else drink on your behalf?\" Yu Wei raised his wine glass again, \"Let's all have another toast together.\"Everyone at the table raised their glasses for another toast. Meanwhile, Gao Boyun discreetly sent a message to Zheng Baozhu: Yu Wei doesn't have a good reputation in the industry. He often mingles with internet celebrities. Be cautious around him.After Zheng Baozhu replied with a \"Got it\", she received a message from Qu Zhi: Are you still at dinner?Zheng Baozhu: Yes.Qu Zhi: Are you drinking?Zheng Baozhu: Yes.Qu Zhi: I'll come pick you up. Wait for me.Zheng Baozhu smiled and put her phone aside. Since Lin Ziqin had another engagement the next day, he suggested leaving early. Zheng Baozhu followed his lead and stood up, saying she also needed to leave.Yu Wei tried to persuade them to stay for a while, but seeing their firm attitude, he also decided to leave.Ignoring him, Zheng Baozhu walked out of the private room, called her assistant to bring the car out, and prepared to wait for Qu Zhi in the car. However, Yu Wei caught up with her and said, \"Miss Zheng, where are you going? How about I give you a ride?\"\"No need, I have my assistant.\" Zheng Baozhu smiled at him and continued walking forward.Yu Wei still followed her, \"Don't be so distant. How about we have a few more drinks? I have some friends coming out, and we can go to KTV.\"\"Really, Mr. Yu, I have work tomorrow,\" Zheng Baozhu replied as they walked outside Tianxia Restaurant, but couldn't shake off Yu Wei. Her assistant had already brought the car out, and seeing Zheng Baozhu being pestered by a man, the assistant opened the car door and walked over, \"Miss Baozhu, you can get in the car first.\"\"Okay.\"Zheng Baozhu nodded and was about to get into the car when her arm was pulled by Yu Wei, \"Miss Zheng, don't be so disrespectful. You're not famous yet, and you're already ignoring the investors?\"Frowning, Zheng Baozhu pulled her hand back, looked at him, and said, \"Mr. Yu, the investors put money into the drama, not me. If you have any requests, you can talk to Director Gao.\"Yu Wei sneered, thinking that she didn't know what was good for her, \"Are you suggesting that I invest in you? Well, I can do that, can't I?\"Zheng Baozhu also sneered, about to tell him to use that money to fix his own brain when Qu Zhi's voice came from the side, \"Baozhu.\"Before Yu Wei could react, Qu Zhi had already approached them. Zheng Baozhu was surprised at how quickly he arrived. Qu Zhi pulled her towards him and looked at Yu Wei, \"Who is this?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"Oh, he's Yu Wei from Huanyu Pictures, one of the investors in our drama.\"\"Mr. Yu, right?\" Qu Zhi's tone was cold, \"I am Baozhu's boyfriend. Thanks for sending her out.\"After saying that, without waiting for Yu Wei's response, he directly pulled Zheng Baozhu away. The assistant followed them and quickly got into the car, not daring to delay for even a second before driving away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu sat in the back, both of their expressions not looking good.\"What did that person want just now?\" Qu Zhi looked at Zheng Baozhu and spoke first.Zheng Baozhu said, \"He wanted me to go to KTV to sing, but I told him I didn't want to go, and he kept pulling me. Thankfully, you came, or else I might have ended up fighting with him.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi fell silent for a moment and then said slowly, \"What about the others? Why was it just the two of you there?\"\"They haven't finished eating yet. Lin Ziqin said he wanted to catch his flight, so I said I'd leave with him. I didn't expect that this Yu Wei guy would follow me out,\" Zheng Baozhu explained.The assistant hadn't joined them for the meal and didn't know what happened before, but hearing Zheng Baozhu's account, the assistant frowned and said, \"Miss Baozhu, Yu Wei has a bad reputation. He's always ambiguous with internet celebrities and involved in countless rumors with young stars. He has also insulted reporters on Weibo. He's not a good person to deal with. Will he seek revenge for what happened today?\"It seems that Yu Wei has taken a liking to Miss Baozhu and thought he could handle the situation the same way he had dealt with others before. But now that Miss Baozhu didn't give him any face, he must be very angry.As soon as the assistant finished speaking, Zheng Baozhu's phone rang. It was Zhou Xiaonan calling.\"Hello, Sister Xiaonan, what's up?\" Zheng Baozhu answered the call. Zhou Xiaonan asked from the other end, \"Was Yu Wei present at the dinner tonight?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu replied and subconsciously sat up straight, \"No way, did he go to complain to you?\"Zhou Xiaonan said, \"What happened between you two? He just angrily scolded you on Weibo; our colleagues from the PR department saw it and told me immediately.\"\"What?\" Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but laugh out of anger, \"He has the audacity to scold me? Does he think I'm an easy target?\"\"Don't worry. He didn't mention names directly, but anyone with a discerning eye can tell he's referring to you,\" Zhou Xiaonan said, concerned that Zheng Baozhu might get upset, and added, \"Tell me what happened between you two tonight, and we'll figure out a plan here.\"\"He just wanted me to go to KTV with him after dinner to drink, but I refused. Now we're on the way back to the hotel,\" Zheng Baozhu explained.Zhou Xiaonan knew what kind of person Yu Wei was, and after hearing Zheng Baozhu's account, she understood the situation, \"Okay, I got it. Don't worry about him for now. We'll come up with a response after discussing it here.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu responded and hung up the phone. She then opened Weibo and asked, \"Xiao Yuan, do you know Yu Wei's Weibo account?\"\"Just use his name and add a 'V' to it.\"Zheng Baozhu nodded and typed Yu Wei's name in the search bar. Indeed, his Weibo account popped up.He had just posted a Weibo five minutes ago and there were already hundreds of comments.Yu Wei V: A certain star is too full of herself. She hasn't even become famous yet and already giving the investors a hard time?? Haha, you were just an extra in the entertainment industry. If it weren't for your unclear relationship with the director, could you have become the lead? Acting all high and mighty in front of me?After reading it, Zheng Baozhu's brows furrowed. Although the statement didn't directly name her, it was close to exposing her identity. [The Pursuit of the Heart] was invested by Huanyu, and Yu Wei flaunted the surname \"Yu\" everywhere. Who wouldn't know he was associated with Huanyu?Yu Wei usually generated gossip news related to the entertainment industry; his Weibo following was considerable. As soon as he posted, many of Zheng Baozhu's critics detected the situation.\u300cZheng Baozhu? \u300d\u300cI know who it is now. \u00a0I said she rose to fame for no reason, and sure enough, she's a dud. \u300d\u300cHahaha, I'm not surprised at all. Those who suddenly become popular for no reason always have issues. \u300d\u300cShowing off in front of the investors, well done. \u00a0The key is, you're not even famous. \u300d\u300cKnowledge bomb! ZBZ is currently headlining two TV dramas directed by the same person. \u300d\u300cDidn't she announce having a boyfriend before? Ah, this...is awkward, hahaha.\u300dLooking at the netizens' comments, Yu Wei's anger subsided a little. Heh, a small star still wanted to compete with him; she really didn't know what was good for her.He instructed the driver to take him to a KTV nearby. He got off the car and walked directly to a private room. After feeling upset because of Zheng Baozhu, he asked his buddies' locations and rushed over to join them for singing and drinking. As he pushed open the private room door, he found everyone huddled together, looking at their phones.\"What's so interesting? Are you all hiding something from me?\" Yu Wei curiously walked over. When they looked up and saw him, their expressions turned somewhat strange, \"Ah Wei, was the Weibo post you made just now about Zheng Baozhu?\"\"Yes, I asked her to come and sing and drink, but she disrespected me. Heh, no one has dared to show me such disrespect before,\" Yu Wei knew that not everyone around him liked him, but they were wary of offending him due to his family background. He didn't care, anyway, he wasn't genuinely fond of them. They were together to have fun and benefit from each other. What's wrong with that?Zheng Baozhu was just too arrogant.One of the guys handed his phone to Yu Wei with a meaningful look, \"You better see it yourself.\"\"What's this all about?\" Yu Wei took the phone and immediately saw Zheng Baozhu had just reposted his Weibo post.Zheng Baozhu V: You can go to hell, you despicable dog thief! So I'm disrespectful because I don't want to go to KTV with you? Do you think your face is so important? Even my dad wouldn't dare ask me to accompany someone for drinks. Who do you think you are? And about my relationship with the director, do you have any evidence? Show it in court if you dare, don't just whine on Weibo. Have some guts, shall we meet in court???Yu Wei's face turned pale in anger; the others in the private room instinctively stepped back.Zheng Baozhu felt satisfied after sending that message. Meanwhile, Zhou Xiaonan was still discussing countermeasures with her PR colleagues. When she saw the Weibo Zheng Baozhu posted, her face turned green.\"Zheng Baozhu, what are you doing! Didn't I tell you not to respond yet?\" Zhou Xiaonan immediately called her, \"By doing this, aren't you admitting that the post is about you?\"Zheng Baozhu held her phone and said, \"Does it make any difference whether I admit it or not? The comments clearly mention my name, and he implied that I have an unclear relationship with Gao Boyun, suggesting that I'm making Qu Zhi wear a green hat! I can tolerate a lot, but I can't tolerate this about Qu Zhi!\"Zhou Xiaonan: \"...\"Taking a deep breath, she asked Zheng Baozhu, \"Is Qu Zhi with you?\"\"Yes.\"\"Then didn't he see you posting on Weibo? Couldn't he have stopped you?\"\"Why should he stop me? He supported me in posting!\" Zheng Baozhu confirmed with Qu Zhi beside her, \"Isn't that right?\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Perhaps she should have asked him before she posted it.But he did indeed indulge her behavior and there was nothing more to argue about: \"Yes, I agree with any decision Baozhu makes.\"\"...\"Zhou Xiaonan felt like she was going crazy and shouted on the phone, \"Then do you also agree to break up with her?\"\"I can agree to anything except that,\" Qu Zhi replied without changing his expression.\"... Fine, I don't want to argue with both of you anymore... Help! Yu Wei posted another Weibo!\" Zhou Xiaonan felt like she needed to keep antacids on standby to handle her job as Zheng Baozhu's agent.After ending the call, Zheng Baozhu noticed that Yu Wei had reposted her previous Weibo.Yu Wei V: Huh, I gave you face, yet you jumped out yourself. Do you really think nobody knows about your little scheme? Fine, let's meet in court as you wish. Also, I officially announce that I'm withdrawing my investment from [The Pursuit of the Heart]!Ha!!!! You thought you could threaten me with money?? Zheng Baozhu angrily reposted his Weibo post.Zheng Baozhu V: If you want to withdraw your investment, go ahead, I'll invest by myself!! I'll immediately contact my lawyer. Anyone who dares not to show up in court is a coward!Tonight's performance was truly amazing, and the pace was so fast that before the spectators could even react, the plot had already taken a new turn. Netizens were jumping between both their Weibo accounts, just like monkeys hopping around in a melon field.Now, Zheng Baozhu had posted a Weibo, so netizens flocked to her side.\u300cZheng Baozhu is the most straightforward celebrity I've ever seen, hahaha!\u300d\u300cEveryone knows about Yu Wei's reputation. \u00a0I'm on Baozhu's side for this one.\u300d\u300cI'm laughing so hard, I thought it was just a childish fight, but then I realized they're quarreling with millions of yuan at stake. Now I'm shedding sour tears.\u00a0\u300d\u300cAh, ah, ah, Baozhu, well done! I've wanted to curse that despicable dog thief Yu Wei for so long!!!\u300d\u300cThe meme is here [dogthief.jpg].\u300dIn just a few minutes, Yu Wei's \"dog thief\" meme spread all over the internet.Zhou Xiaonan watched the entire spectacle with a smile and thought: I'm exhausted. Let it be. Whatever. :)Meanwhile, Gao Boyun was still having dinner with the producers and creative team. No one in the private room had any idea of the chaos happening outside. By the end of the meal, Gao Boyun was already slightly drunk. He took out his phone to check the time, only to find dozens of missed calls. He was taken aback.Muttering curses, he couldn't believe it, \"What's going on? Did aliens invade Earth??\"While he was still wondering, his father, Gao Tianming, called him again. This time, Gao Boyun finally answered the call, \"Dad...\"\"What dad! You're my dad!\"\"...\"Gao Boyun hesitated for a moment before speaking, \"What happened?\"\"Yu Wei and Zheng Baozhu are tearing each other apart on Weibo. If you don't answer the phone earlier, you might as well go listen to their court case as an audience!\"\"Ah??\" When he heard it might go to court, Gao Boyun panicked, \"Did Yu Wei do something to Baozhu? I knew that scoundrel had bad intentions!\"\"Heh!\" Gao Tianming chuckled, \"Go check Weibo yourself. After all, you've also landed a hot search.\"\"...\"How was this related to him? Gao Boyun rubbed his forehead, ended the call with his dad, and hurriedly checked Weibo. After reading through the night's drama, Gao Boyun sobered up from the alcohol. He clenched his phone for three seconds but couldn't hold back from cursing, \"Yu Wei, you despicable dog thief!\"At this time, Zheng Baozhu had already returned to her hotel. On her way back, she immediately contacted her lawyer, saying she wanted to sue Yu Wei for spreading rumors and defamation. Then, she remembered there might be surveillance cameras at the venue, which could prove that Yu Wei was the one pestering her. The lawyer told her that only the police could access the surveillance footage, so she decided to report the incident to the police.The assistant who drove her back was left completely speechless.Previously, the assistant already knew that Zheng Baozhu was strong-willed after witnessing two incidents where she clarified plastic surgery rumors and defended Sun Jing against reporters. But today, the assistant was truly speechless. In the country's film and television industry, Huanyu Entertainment was an absolute leader, so despite knowing what kind of person Yu Wei was, she still angered him to the point of spurting blood.Although Huanyu Entertainment's position was changing through these years, the Yu family's foundation remained strong. As the saying goes, a dead camel is still bigger than a horse, right?So, the assistant really didn't expect Zheng Baozhu to be this domineering!!While driving back, the assistant was still in a state of awe.After taking a shower, Zheng Baozhu calmed down a lot. The alcohol from the night and the encounter with Yu Wei had caused her to be somewhat impulsive. Upon careful reflection, her approach might not have been appropriate, but... it still felt satisfying!As she blew dry her hair, she saw Qu Zhi standing in her bedroom wearing pajamas. While she was taking a shower, Qu Zhi had also gone back to his room to freshen up. He came back because he was worried about Zheng Baozhu.He visited Zheng Baozhu's bedroom twice, including this time. The last time he hadn't noticed, but this time, he saw a piece of writing from the third grade on her wall.Zheng Baozhu saw him standing by the wall, looking up at the essay framed there, and suddenly felt embarrassed, \"What are you looking at?\"Hearing her voice, Qu Zhi turned back and glanced at her with a gentle smile, \"I'm admiring your masterpiece.\"\"Stop looking, stop looking. Your \"A\" essay looks way better!\" Zheng Baozhu walked up to him, intending to cover his eyes. Qu Zhi evaded her hand, teasingly saying, \"Wow, it's Zheng Baozhu! So pretty!\"\"............\" Zheng Baozhu was so embarrassed; Qu Zhi actually recited the content of her essay! \"Ah, don't you dare say it!\"Now she not only had to cover Qu Zhi's eyes but also had to cover her ears. Qu Zhi held her hands and pulled her into his arms, asking, \"What's the matter? Still feeling shy?\"Zheng Baozhu turned her head away, avoiding his gaze, \"I'm not!\"\"Oh, then why are your ears turning red?\" Qu Zhi said softly, planting a kiss on Zheng Baozhu's ear, then chuckled lightly, \"They've become even redder now.\"\"You're doing it on purpose!\" Zheng Baozhu glared at him with displeasure. Qu Zhi smiled and hugged her tighter, looking into her eyes warmly, \"Teacher Zhang encouraged you not to give up when facing setbacks. Indeed, from tonight's incident, our Zheng Baozhu will only bring setbacks to others.\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu gave a slight shrug, not replying.Qu Zhi kissed her again and whispered softly, \"But you're really courageous. Aren't you afraid of offending the Yu family?\"\"What am I afraid of?\" Zheng Baozhu looked up at him, \"Now we live in a society under the rule of law. Does he still want to control everything? You're right, he's only become so arrogant because he hasn't faced a setback like me. He's just been allowed to inflate himself like this day by day!\"\"Alright, don't be angry anymore. He must be more furious than you right now,\" Qu Zhi comforted Zheng Baozhu as he continued to kiss her gently.Zheng Baozhu's anger dissipated instantly and she just gazed at him. Qu Zhi smiled and touched the tip of his nose against hers, asking, \"What are you looking at?\"Zheng Baozhu leaned in and pecked him on the lips, saying, \"I'm looking at your handsome face.\"Then she pulled him to sit on the bed and declared dominantly, \"Tonight, you're going to sleep here with me.\"Qu Zhi chuckled and raised an eyebrow, \"I can see that you're still under the influence of alcohol.\"Zheng Baozhu puffed her cheeks but didn't say anything. It was rare for her to have such a cute expression, which made Qu Zhi couldn't help but touch her cheek, \"I understand. I'll stay here with you. Rest early; we don't know how things will develop tomorrow.\"\"Mhm...\" Zheng Baozhu nodded and, when Qu Zhi was about to leave, she pulled him back, \"Where are you going?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"I'll sleep on the other side.\"Zheng Baozhu pursed her lips and watched him for a while, then suddenly, she sat on his lap, cupped his face, and kissed him deeply. Qu Zhi was briefly stunned, but then he quickly took the lead and deepened the kiss, holding the back of her head to keep her close.Zheng Baozhu's hands were restless; Qu Zhi grabbed her hands, bringing them close and continuing the passionate exchange of tongues.Zheng Baozhu knew that as long as she took the lead a bit, Qu Zhi couldn't resist. She could clearly sense that Qu Zhi was more passionate than ever before and the places he touched seemed to carry a fiery intensity.Closing her eyes, she savored every moment with Qu Zhi, allowing herself to be immersed in this whirlpool of emotions with him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPossibly because she had a fulfilling\u00a0night, Zheng Baozhu slept very well. If it weren't for Zhou Xiaonan calling early in the morning, she could have slept until noon.Hearing the ringing of the phone, Zheng Baozhu, still half-asleep, reached out for her own phone but instead touched something warm and sturdy. Confused, she furrowed her brows and opened her eyes to take a look.Her hand was resting on Qu Zhi's chest, going up and down.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"A soft chuckle came from above, and when Zheng Baozhu raised her head, she met Qu Zhi's smiling eyes.\"Is your waist okay?\" he asked.A blush spread across Zheng Baozhu's face, but she stubbornly pulled her hand away from Qu Zhi's chest and replied, \"It's fine.\"The phone ringing stopped and then started again. Zheng Baozhu sat up with the blanket wrapped around her, finally reaching for the phone and answering the call, \"Hello, Sister Xiaonan, what's up?\"\"Awake now?\" Zhou Xiaonan snorted coldly on the other end of the line, \"While you were sleeping, Yu Wei was busy doing something.\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu remained silent for a moment, then put the phone on speaker and opened her Weibo app, \"What did he do again?\"\"He somehow got hold of the photos of you taken during the filming of 'New Moon Wuxin Sword'. There are pictures of you getting out of Gao Boyun's car and going in and out of the hotel together. Now Yu Wei is using these photos to make a big fuss,\" Zhou Xiaonan explained.\"....I see.\" Zheng Baozhu had already clicked on Yu Wei's Weibo and saw the repost he made at five in the morning.The original post was from an entertainment marketing account that often speculated on gossip in the industry. This time, in the middle of the night, the account posted an article with photos of Zheng Baozhu and Gao Boyun, trying to confirm their \"inappropriate\" relationship.Zheng Baozhu could tell that it was orchestrated by Yu Wei. The moment the article was posted, he quickly reposted it.Yu Wei V: @Zheng Baozhu, didn't you say there was nothing going on between you and the director?\"Heh.\" Zheng Baozhu curled her lips and quickly took a screenshot of his Weibo post. After last night's confrontation, she discovered a blind spot \u2013 her popularity was higher than Yu Wei's! Why should she give him more attention by reposting his Weibo? Not a single repost for him!Uploading the screenshot to her own Weibo, Zheng Baozhu edited a post swiftly.Zheng Baozhu V: Hey, Dog Yu, getting up at five in the morning to post on Weibo, were you so angry last night that you couldn't sleep the whole night? Unlike you, I have the life of a normal person, and I slept really well last night. Also, what can these few crappy photos prove? Firstly, there were more than just the two of us in the car. Secondly, just because someone gets out of a man's car, does it automatically mean there's something inappropriate between them? If that's the case, then no one can ever take another person's car. Wake up, we are not living in the Qing Dynasty anymore.Before filming [New Moon Wuxin Sword], I was just an ordinary supporting actor in the Film and Television City. I had no assistant, no company, and every day, I carried my own actor's chair to the set. Director Gao saw me carrying so much stuff by myself, so he proposed to give me a ride back to the hotel after work. Yes, it's the same hotel you captured in the photos. Many actors from our crew stayed there too. This photo you have doesn't even show any intimate actions, yet you dare to use it to create a story. Have the standards of paparazzi fallen so low? If I were the boss, I would definitely fire you.Also, about last night, I wanted to say this \u2013 it's true that I used to be an extra. So what? I never felt ashamed, but who are you to look down on extras? Every film and television drama is the result of the efforts of the entire crew, not just a few main actors. If you look down on extras so much, then in your future film investments, don't use extras, alright???Speaking of investments, the viewers waiting for [The Pursuit of the Heart] need not worry. I said I would invest, and I will. I won't let this drama stall.This will be my last public response to @YuWei. Last night, I already contacted a lawyer and reported to the police. From now on, we will handle everything through legal procedures. I have already saved all the evidence. Again, whoever dares not to show up in court is the dog (no offense to dogs).After Zheng Baozhu posted on Weibo, she held her phone and kept refreshing the page. Qu Zhi sat beside her, still not properly dressed. He had on a coat over his sleepwear, the buttons were undone, and there were still some red marks on his chest and neck from where Zheng Baozhu scratched him last night.\"Your essay writing skills have improved a lot since primary school. Teacher Zhang should be very proud when he sees this,\" Qu Zhi half-jokingly commented while looking at the phone, \"You might be able to get some votes from the extras.\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him and said, \"I didn't mean it that way. I was speaking from the heart! I've been scolded enough already. Now, even sitting in another person's car can be used to insult me, as if it's some kind of winning strategy. It's really ridiculous. And as for extras, it's true that it's tiring work with poor treatment, but someone like Yu Wei, a big shot, wouldn't understand.\"\"I didn't mean it that way either; I was just stating my assumption,\" Qu Zhi raised his hand and smoothed his hair, \"I need to get ready to go to work. Do you want to sleep a bit longer?\"Zheng Baozhu shook her head, \"I can't sleep anymore. Who knows what Yu Wei might try to do while I'm asleep?\"Qu Zhi thought for a moment and said, \"Then, how about I take a day off and stay here to keep you company?\"\"No need,\" Zheng Baozhu leaned over and kissed Qu Zhi on the lips, \"I can handle it myself. Also, I'm not alone; I have a team behind me.\"Hearing this, Qu Zhi couldn't help but chuckle, \"Your team might have been exasperated by you.\"\"Erm...\" Judging from the tone of the phone call from Zhou Xiaonan, it seemed that they were indeed quite angry, \"But they have no choice. After all, I'm their boss!\"Qu Zhi smiled again, \"Alright then, I'll go to work?\"\"Sure!\"Qu Zhi looked at her and said, \"Kiss me again.\"\"...Seriously, you're too clingy,\" Zheng Baozhu teased, but she leaned over and kissed Qu Zhi again. Qu Zhi finally seemed satisfied and got up to get dressed and ready.Zheng Baozhu remained seated and continued browsing through Weibo. Unexpectedly, so many netizens were already discussing the drama this early in the morning. The entertainment industry's insiders had all written articles about the incident, and there were supporters for both Zheng Baozhu and Yu Wei, but visibly, there were more people standing by Zheng Baozhu's side. In the morning, after the confrontation, Gao Boyun finally remembered to post on Weibo to clarify his relationship with Zheng Baozhu, saying that he was just a single young man whose reputation had been wrongly tarnished, and he reserved the right to pursue legal action.Zheng Baozhu could understand Gao Boyun posting on Weibo, but what surprised her was that Sun Jing suddenly also posted on Weibo, criticizing Yu Wei and even releasing screenshots of a short conversation between them, in which Yu Wei's words were quite despicable.Sun Jing's number of followers on Weibo was even more than the combined total of Zheng Baozhu and Yu Wei's followers. As soon as that post went up, the internet exploded, accusing Yu Wei of sexual harassment.Zheng Baozhu didn't know why Sun Jing suddenly decided to target Yu Wei, but at this time, her action undoubtedly helped as it supported the notion that Yu Wei had sexually harassed more than one person.After thinking for a while, Zheng Baozhu sent a WeChat message to Sun Jing: Thanks, sister.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't expect everyone to wake up this early.Sun Jing replied almost instantly: What are you talking about? I didn't post that Weibo to help you. I've just had enough of Yu Wei's arrogance. Since you've come out as a thorn in his side, I pushed the wave along.Zheng Baozhu: Oh.Sun Jing: And who said we are sisters?Zheng Baozhu: So you're the tsundere type, huh? Got it, sister.Sun Jing: ...Although Sun Jing didn't admit it directly, her Weibo post indeed swayed public opinion against Yu Wei. After her post, several internet influencers also came forward to claim that they had been sexually harassed by Yu Wei. Some were genuinely harassed, while others were just riding the wave for popularity. Nevertheless, Yu Wei had indeed become the drowning dog, and everyone was against him.Yu Wei was so angry that he was about to throw his phone. But before he could do it, his father called him. Yu Wei held his breath and reluctantly picked up the phone, \"Dad...\"\"Don't 'Dad' me! You're driving me crazy!\" Yu Wei's father shouted angrily on the other end of the line, \"What was that mess you created last night? Haven't you disgraced the Yu family enough?\"\"It wasn't me, it was Zheng Baozhu...\"\"Don't mention her to me! Do you think I don't know what you're up to?\" Yu Wei's father interrupted him before he could finish, \"You're caused trouble outside, now you're talking about withdrawing the investment? Do you think you're the only one who can make that decision? I had to get up early this morning to convene a board meeting to discuss this mess you've created!\"Yu Wei, feeling indignant, argued, \"Dad, Huanyu is originally owned by our Yu family. Why should we listen to those outsiders?\"\"Outsiders with company shares and status! You really have a knack for failing in whatever you do!\"The phone was abruptly hung up, and Yu Wei felt the urge to throw his phone again. He picked it up and tossed it aside, causing the phone to scatter into pieces.The conflict between Zheng Baozhu and Yu Wei continued to ferment online with people on both sides closely monitoring the situation. Yu Wei had thought that things were already bad enough, but little did he know that this was just an appetizer.Around noon, a prominent online figure posted a lengthy Weibo post. He was known for sharing information related to the internet and computers, but this was the first time he dabbled in entertainment industry news.Have you all heard about the Zheng Baozhu incident? I have to say it's quite shocking, and I'm sure her haters are dumbfounded. However, being curious, I did some research, and what I found might surprise the haters even more.According to my investigation, Zheng Baozhu opened a teahouse near her university during her first year, and it was a huge success. Later, she opened a Chinese restaurant and a hotel, and they've been running well. She probably recouped her investments in no time and is now making money effortlessly. She has also invested in several companies, and they seem to be doing quite well in recent years, probably bringing her substantial returns.One could say she's a born winner.While I was looking into this, I came across an interview featuring an ABA interviewee, and it mentioned her entrepreneurial experience. If you're interested, you can watch it. I've attached the link at the end (because the title and introduction didn't mention Zheng Baozhu, no one has discovered this video yet ). The interview also mentioned Zheng Baozhu's father, and I looked him up as well... turns out, he's from a wealthy family.In conclusion, there's no problem with President Zheng investing in [The Pursuit of the Heart]. You can rest assured.The only thing that puzzles me is, with all the money President Zheng has, why did she go to the Film and Television City to play an extra role? Is she trying to experience a different life?PS: The tea industry isn't as easy to make it big these years, the teahouse at the school's entrance has undergone renovations, changes in branding and business models. Some classmates might think it's under new management, but in reality, the boss behind it has always been Zheng Baozhu.The Weibo post also included many images, which were data he found from a business information platform that showed the companies related to Zheng Baozhu.When the netizens started eating popcorn, they never expected the situation to take this turn. :)\u300cI can't believe it, I'm stunned!\u300d\u300cNow I get it, it's not Zheng Baozhu who's with the director, it's the director who's with the rich lady. \u300d\u300cYu Wei, you've got yourself into something. \u300d\u300cThis shocked my whole family. \u00a0While Zheng Baozhu was already making money during her first year, I'm still adjusting to university life. \u300d\u300cI looked it up, Zheng Baozhu was only 16 when she entered university... and it was a prestigious one...\u300d\u300cAhhh, this person is something else!! Talented and rich!\u300d\u300cI just want to learn about investment from Miss Baozhu. \u300d\u300cI mentioned on the internet a long time ago that Zheng Baozhu is the owner of the hotel where I stayed! But no one paid attention to me!!\u300dNow people are paying attention to him, and not just a few. They not only know about Zheng Baozhu's hotel but have even released the address and phone number, and the hotel is getting swamped with calls.Wei Zhen hurriedly contacted Zheng Baozhu and the first thing he said was, \"Miss Baozhu, it's a mess out there. You need to evacuate from the hotel!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Is Manager Wei under the influence of a spy movie?After calming down, she asked, \"What happened?\"\"Our hotel has been exposed. The front desk phone is ringing non-stop and all the rooms are fully booked. Many people will probably come here to see you. You must evacuate immediately!\"\"...I know. I'll leave the hotel right away. You also need to make emergency preparations. Get the security staff who are on leave to come back and work overtime. Also, inform the management at the Starlight Farm in advance.\"\"Alright, I'll handle it.\"\"That's it then.\" As soon as Zheng Baozhu hung up the phone, Qu Zhi called. As she answered the phone, Qu Zhi's slightly anxious voice came through the receiver, \"Are you still at the hotel?\"\"You also know about what's happening online? I'm just getting ready to pack up and leave the hotel.\"\"Then wait for me. I already asked for leave from Professor Luo, I'm coming back to pick you up.\"\"Ah, okay,\" Zheng Baozhu sighed, \"In the end, I'm still causing trouble for you to take leave.\"\"What trouble could there be between us?\" Qu Zhi playfully asked with an affectionate tone, \"I'm already on my way and will be there soon.\"\"Alright,\" Zheng Baozhu responded, and a smile appeared on her face.\"Do you have any idea where to go? To your parents' house?\"Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and said to him, \"Let's forget about that. I don't want to disturb my parents. Actually, I have another villa in Huadu. Let's go there.\"On the other end of the phone, Qu Zhi couldn't help raising his eyebrows, \"You've got another property hidden away?\"\"Hahaha, my parents bought it for me, and I never got around to living there,\" Zheng Baozhu explained, \"Originally, I wanted them to move in, but my mom's friends are all in the old neighborhood, and she didn't want to leave. They said that living in the villa area, there's no one to chat with.\"Qu Zhi nodded, \"Makes sense. They've been living there for over thirty years, after all.\"\"Yeah, the security in Huadu is also better than in my parents' area. It's more suitable for a big star like me to hide.\"Qu Zhi couldn't help but smile as he listened. He couldn't figure out how Zheng Baozhu managed to stir up the entire entertainment industry when she hadn't even appeared in a single drama.While they were chatting, Huanyu held their board meeting, and they released a statement promptly.Huanyu Entertainment V: A solemn statement - Mr. Yu Wei's personal remarks on Weibo do not represent the company's decisions. We will not withdraw our investment from [The Pursuit of the Heart]. We deeply apologize to all the crew members and netizens who have been affected by this incident.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQu Zhi drove the car as they made their way to Huadu. Zheng Baozhu sat in the passenger seat, looking at the statement released by Huanyu. There\u00a0were comments from curious netizens and various sources, all criticizing Yu Wei.Zheng Baozhu was engrossed in reading the comments when Gao Boyun called via video. She tapped the screen with her fingertips, and Gao Boyun's face appeared, \"What's up, Director Gao?\"\"Have you seen the statement from Huanyu?\" Gao Boyun asked from the other end.Zheng Baozhu nodded, telling him, \"I'm just enjoying it.\"\"Oh... Huanyu specially contacted me just now and explained a lot. In short, they definitely won't withdraw, so you don't need to worry.\"\"I never worried in the first place,\" Zheng Baozhu said, \"But even if they don't withdraw, I still plan to invest.\"\"Sigh, our drama doesn't lack money now. After Yu Wei said he wanted to withdraw, many investors contacted us, saying they want to invest,\" Gao Boyun complained with a troubled expression, \"Oh, by the way, some of them mentioned that they are your friends.\"\"My friends?\"\"Yes.\"Gao Boyun mentioned a few CEOs of companies; Zheng Baozhu listened and nodded slowly, \"Oh, I do know them. We meet at the business conferences every year.\"\"Besides these CEOs, there's also President Tan from the Rongtai Group. Their group has investments in many fields but has never had any dealings with the entertainment industry. Yet, they suddenly want to invest in our drama,\" Gao Boyun thought to himself that it was because their drama crew was indeed outstanding, \"Let me tell you, our drama crew is now facing the problem of having too many potential investors. We have to select the best ones from them.\"\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu listened to him and then said slowly, \"I think I'm quite good, so pick me!\"Gao Boyun: \"...\"\"My mom gave me all the properties left by my aunt, and I've been thinking about how to use this money. Now I know. Investing in my first leading drama is the best choice,\" Zheng Baozhu explained reasonably, \"It feels like witnessing the birth of a protagonist, and from there, I'll continue the journey from the starting point.\"\"...\"Gao Boyun was silent for a moment after hearing her words, \"If you put it that way, I have no choice but to accept this money.\"\"That's right. Let's find a time to sign the contract later.\"\"Okay...\"\"By the way, there's still one role left to cast, right? Can I recommend Wang Jingyi from my studio?\"Gao Boyun raised an eyebrow and asked, \"What's this? You just invested, and now you want to push someone from your studio into the production?\"\"Come on, don't say it like that. I just want to give Director Gao a chance to audition. Whether she's qualified or not depends on her abilities.\"Gao Boyun pondered for a moment and replied, \"I do remember the person you mentioned. She was on the 'New Moon Wuxin Sword' set as a supporting character, right? She's a good friend of yours.\"\"Yes, and her conditions are pretty good. She should be able to handle a minor role.\"\"Okay, then let her audition when the time comes. However, I can't guarantee if she'll be selected or not,\" Gao Boyun said, then glanced at Zheng Baozhu, \"But this matter can easily be misconstrued. Even if she gets selected based on her talent, outsiders might think that you pushed her in.\"Zheng Baozhu didn't seem to mind, \"If others want to say whatever they like, I can't control that. I believe an actor's work will speak for itself. If she's genuinely talented, the audience will see it. Besides, if we don't give her an opportunity to audition just because she's from my studio, wouldn't that be unfair?\"\"As long as you see it that way. By the way, Hanyu's President Song mentioned that he wants to treat us to dinner to apologize, and he specially invited you.\"Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and said, \"Sure, why not? After all, my conflict is only with Yu Wei, not with Hanyu.\"\"Then I'll respond to them and I'll let you know when the time is confirmed.\"\"Okay,\" After finishing her call with Gao Boyun, Zheng Baozhu hung up the phone. Just as she exhaled a breath, Lin Ziqin called her.Staring at the name on the screen, Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment.Qu Zhi glanced at her phone and smiled teasingly, \"Why don't you answer? Why hesitate?\"\"...\"Wasn't it just because he might get jealous again? :)Clearing her throat, Zheng Baozhu answered the call and put it on speaker, \"Hello, Lin Ziqin?\"\"Um, sorry, I was busy catching a flight yesterday, and my schedule has been tight after landing. I just saw the news about you and Yu Wei.\"Qu Zhi glanced at Zheng Baozhu and made a soft hum from his nose. Zheng Baozhu smiled and said, \"It's okay; it's not your fault.\"Lin Ziqin said, \"I should have waited for you yesterday; that way, Yu Wei wouldn't have kept bothering you.\"\"Don't think like that. Even if you had waited, it wouldn't change anything. If Yu Wei really wanted to bother me, he would find another opportunity. The end result would have been the same.\"Sighing softly on the other end, Lin Ziqin said, \"As long as you're okay, that's what matters.\"\"I'm fine, of course. Right now, the one with a problem is Yu Wei.\"Lin Ziqin chuckled as Zheng Baozhu continued, \"And you don't need to worry about the production either. Director Gao just called me, complaining that there are too many people interested in investing, and he's having a hard time choosing.\"Lin Ziqin laughed even louder this time, \"I believe that. With your current popularity, everyone would want a share of the cake.\"\"No, no, your popularity is even greater, Teacher Lin.\"Lin Ziqin said, \"Alright, let's not flatter each other. Since you're okay, I won't disturb you anymore.\"\"Okay, I won't disturb you either, Teacher Lin. Goodbye,\" After hanging up the phone, Zheng Baozhu turned to look at Qu Zhi. Qu Zhi pretended to focus on driving but was actually listening intently to her conversation with Lin Ziqin.\"All done,\" Zheng Baozhu waved her phone next to Qu Zhi. Qu Zhi pretended to be serious and furrowed his brows, \"Don't distract me while I'm driving.\"\"Oh, sorry. You're driving so seriously.\"\"I've always been serious about what I do.\"\"Oh, I see. Well, good job, and congratulations!\"\"...\"After arriving in Huadu, Zheng Baozhu asked the security guard at the entrance how to get to the building where she was staying, \"Thank you, young man. I haven't been here in a long time, and I couldn't remember.\"After getting the directions, she got back in the car and directed Qu Zhi to go inside. Once they drove away, the duty butler at the entrance approached gossiping, \"Was that Zheng Baozhu just now?\"The security guard got excited, \"Yes, she looks even better in person than in photos! I can't believe she's staying here!\"\"Stay calm, our residents here are all celebrities. Let's not make a fuss about it!\"Qu Zhi parked the car at Zheng Baozhu's residence and she got out to get her luggage. Then she remembered that Qu Zhi couldn't go back to the hotel either, \"Qu Zhi, there are also photos of you online. If you go back to the hotel, you'll definitely be recognized.\"After watching the video sent by Wei Zhen, they saw that many people had come to the hotel, including several live streamers who had come to increase their popularity.Qu Zhi brought his luggage over and walked with her inside, \"I should be okay, right?\"\"It's not certain, it's better if you avoid it temporarily. Wait until the heat dies down, and then we'll see.\"Qu Zhi looked at her speechlessly, \"So, in the end, I'm still a wanted criminal?\"\"Hahaha!\" Zheng Baozhu laughed while opening the door, \"Today was too rushed, and you didn't pack anything. How about you go back home for a few days?\"\"But it's too far from the Starlight Farm and I'll have to transfer on the subway.\"\"The subway here goes directly to the Science and Technology Park! How about you stay here then?\"\"Sure.\"\"...\"Wait a minute, Zheng Baozhu frowned.Did she fall into some kind of trap?\"Qu Zhi, did you plan this from the beginning?\" Zheng Baozhu stared at Qu Zhi with wide eyes, as if trying to read his every expression.Qu Zhi innocently looked at her, \"You were the one who suggested it.\"\"...\" Fine, she admitted, \"But no one has been living here, and there's not much stuff. Why don't I ask Wei Zhen and the others to pack your things and send them over?\"Qu Zhi thought for a moment and placed his suitcase beside the sofa in the living room, \"I'll have Qi Sheng do it for me.\"\"That works too. You guys are more convenient since you're both guys,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"Let's invite him for dinner tonight as well.\"\"Okay,\" Qu Zhi looked around the living room, \"Does someone regularly clean up here?\"\"Yes, and it's kept quite neat.\"\"Okay,\" Qu Zhi turned around again, \"But judging from the decoration, it doesn't seem to be your style.\"\"You hit the nail on the head,\" Zheng Baozhu laughed, \"My dad decorated this house. It's already good enough like this, both he and Mom like this place. That's why I said it's more suitable for them to live here.\"Qu Zhi also laughed, \"It's evident that Uncle Zheng is carefully considering what young people like.\"\"Indeed,\" Zheng Baozhu picked up her luggage again, \"Let's go upstairs. There are plenty of rooms upstairs, so you can choose any one you like.\"Qu Zhi followed Zheng Baozhu upstairs but hesitated, \"Would Uncle Zheng and Aunt Su have any opinions if they knew we were living here together?\"\"Um... If it were someone else, they might rush over immediately. But since it's you, they probably won't have any objections.\"Qu Zhi chuckled and followed her into the elevator, \"I'm honored.\"At lunchtime, Qi Sheng helped Qu Zhi bring his luggage over. Since the two of them had just moved into the villa and hadn't had a chance to buy groceries yet, they ordered takeout from Tianxia Restaurant.\"Sorry, Qi Sheng, I said I would treat you to a meal, but we can only have takeout due to limited conditions.\"Qi Sheng thought Zheng Baozhu was being too polite, \"Even though it's takeout, it's from Tianxia Restaurant!\"The average cost per person at Tianxia Restaurant was nearly four digits, and unless there was a significant occasion, he wouldn't be able to afford to dine there. Living in a villa was indeed different; they ordered takeout from such a high-end restaurant, \"This meal is really great; I'm enjoying it.\"\"...\" Qu Zhi whispered to Zheng Baozhu, \"Not all researchers are like him.\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and waved her hand, inviting them to continue eating.After finishing their meal, Qu Zhi originally planned to return to Science and Technology Park with Qi Sheng and continue working for the rest of the day. However, unexpectedly, the police contacted Zheng Baozhu and asked her to come over. Qu Zhi definitely couldn't let Zheng Baozhu go alone, so he accompanied her.Zheng Baozhu also invited Lawyer Han to join them. When they arrived, they found that Yu Wei was also there, with his lawyer.The reason the police called them was mainly to inquire if they had any intention of settling the matter privately since Zheng Baozhu had reported the incident.\"Mr. Yu has already agreed to compensate you. As long as your compensation request is not unreasonable, he can agree to it,\" the police officer in the middle mediated. Zheng Baozhu firmly refused, \"I don't want money. I'm open to a private settlement, but I demand that Yu Wei publicly apologize to me on Weibo and pin the apology post for half a year.\"\"Don't give face when you're not given face...\" Upon hearing this, Yu Wei became furious once again. Qu Zhi immediately pulled Zheng Baozhu back and coldly stared at Yu Wei. Yu Wei's lawyer also held him back and frowned, saying, \"Mr. Yu, we came here to apologize. Please watch your attitude.\"He used a lot of force in holding Yu Wei's arm; Yu Wei shook off his hand with a frown and stopped speaking.Zheng Baozhu stood behind Qu Zhi, looking at Yu Wei on the opposite side, \"Mr. Yu, if this is your attitude, then I think there's nothing to talk about. Let's settle this in court.\"The police also reminded Yu Wei, \"Mr. Yu, this is the police station. Control your emotions. We have already obtained surveillance footage from Tianxia Restaurant and questioned the staff on duty that night. The evidence and testimonies are not in your favor. In addition to the defamation, once this goes to court, it won't be as simple as a Weibo apology.\"Yu Wei pursed his lips without saying anything. His lawyer spoke on his behalf, \"We accept Miss Zheng's request.\"Yu Wei was extremely unwilling, but in the end, he managed to hold back.Zheng Baozhu demanded that Yu Wei post the apology on Weibo publicly and pin it.Yu Wei's face turned purple with anger. He edited a very simple apology statement, but Zheng Baozhu wasn't satisfied after reading it, \"This lacks sincerity. If you really can't write it, then I'll do it, and you can just type it out.\"With a cold expression, Yu Wei typed out the words exactly as Zheng Baozhu said.Yu Wei V: Regarding my unfounded accusations against Miss Zheng Baozhu last night, I sincerely apologize here. I should not have falsely accused her of being arrogant just because she refused to go to KTV with me, nor should I have defamed her by insinuating an inappropriate relationship with Director Gao Boyun. My irresponsible remarks have caused harm to Miss Zheng Baozhu's reputation, and I want to sincerely say sorry once again!After the Weibo post was published, netizens immediately flocked to it.\u300c??? He knelt so quickly. \u300d\u300c[Villain.jpg]\u300d\u300cHahaha, Yu Wei didn't expect to hit a wall this time, right? \u300d\u300cServes him right, serves him right, serves him right, serves him right, serves him right!!\u300d\u300cGood for her! Miss Baozhu did it beautifully!\u300d\u300cThat marketing account, shouldn't they come out to apologize together???\u300d\u300cHahaha, I just checked the marketing account's Weibo post, and it's already deleted. Probably saw Yu Wei kneeling, realizing they couldn't handle it themselves. \u300d\u300cMiss Baozhu is so magnanimous! She should've had him arrested!!!\u300d\u300cPresident Zheng is awesome. \u00a0This is like a novel in the entertainment industry. \u300dZheng Baozhu logged on to Weibo and reposted Yu Wei's apology post.Zheng Baozhu V: This Weibo post will be pinned for half a year. Please help supervise, my dear netizens.When Yu Wei saw the reposted Weibo, he was so angry that he turned off his phone. What difference does half a year make? He could just stay off Weibo for half a year!After leaving the police station, Zheng Baozhu felt extremely refreshed. She sent a message in a small group, inviting everyone to the villa for a hot pot dinner in the evening.Zheng Baozhu: Since I can't go out right now, you two can come over and buy some groceries on your way.Meng Yaxin: What about Qu Zhi?Zheng Baozhu: Qu Zhi is at the villa keeping me company.Meng Yaxin: ...Cen Tongtong: Suddenly not so eager to go anymore.Zheng Baozhu: You can buy whatever you want, I'll reimburse you.Cen Tongtong: Yay!Meng Yaxin: \u2192_\u2192After sending the message in the small group, Zheng Baozhu returned to the WeChat contacts and suddenly saw Tan Yao's chat icon. They hadn't contacted each other since Tan Yao asked if she wanted to enter the entertainment industry. However, when Gao Boyun mentioned President Tan from the Rongtai Group today, she immediately thought of Tan Yao.If she remembered correctly, Tan Yao was related to the Rongtai Group.The President Tan mentioned by Gao Boyun probably wasn't Tan Yao; could it be his father or an uncle?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZheng Baozhu, on a rare occasion, sent a message to Tan Yao.Zheng Baozhu: Are you investing in [The Pursuit of the Heart]?When Tan Yao heard his phone beep, he glanced at the screen. Zheng Baozhu's name made him pause for a moment. It had been a long time since he last contacted Zheng Baozhu. When he first learned that she wanted to enter the entertainment industry, he was considering how to convince his father. However, before he could come up with a plan, Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi made their relationship official.After that, Tan Yao completely gave up on the idea. He didn't expect Zheng Baozhu to reach out to him today.After reading Zheng Baozhu's message, he frowned slightly and replied: I haven't heard about this news. Where did you hear it from?Zheng Baozhu: Director Gao mentioned that President Tan from the Rongtai Group; is that your father?Tan Yao's frown deepened. According to what the director said, it should be his father. However, his father detested the entertainment industry, didn't he?But his father had been acting a bit strange lately. One time when he went to his father's study, he saw him browsing through information about Zheng Baozhu. As soon as he noticed Tan Yao entering the room, he quickly closed the computer screen.Now, his father was planning to invest in Zheng Baozhu's drama? Could it be that his father liked Zheng Baozhu?\"...\" Tan Yao was rendered speechless by his own thoughts.Tan Yao: I'll ask my father when I get back. No one mentioned this during the meeting today.Zheng Baozhu: Oh... It's alright, I was just casually asking.After work in the afternoon, Tan Yao deliberately waited for his father before leaving. Tan Liwen glanced at Tan Yao, who got into the same car as him, and raised an eyebrow lightly, \"Where's your car?\"\"Oh, I sent it for maintenance,\" Tan Yao smiled and brushed it off, casually closing the car door. Tan Liwen chuckled, not believing him at all, \"Did you get into some trouble again and need my help?\"\"Hey, it really isn't this time,\" Tan Yao turned his head to appraise his old father, \"Dad, I have something to ask you. Are you planning to invest in 'The Pursuit of the Heart'?\"Tan Liwen's expression changed instantly. Seeing his father's reaction, Tan Yao's heart also tensed up.Could it be that he guessed right; his father actually likes Zheng Baozhu??\"Where did you hear this news?\" Tan Liwen asked calmly. Tan Yao thought for a moment and decided to give Zheng Baozhu some cover, \"It was just something a friend mentioned. You know I have a lot of friends, and they come from all sorts of backgrounds.\"\"Is that so?\" Tan Liwen asked in return without confirming or denying anything, nor did he intend to explain anything to Tan Yao, \"This has nothing to do with you.\"\"How can this have nothing to do with me? After all, I am the company's general manager.\"\"Ha, you only remember you're the general manager at a time like this.\"Tan Yao choked for a moment, but then he felt that he had been performing well recently, and his confidence rose, \"If I weren't the general manager, why do you always have me stay at the company?\"\"Aren't you recuperating from your injuries there?\" Tan Liwen said, \"I know you too well.\"\"...\" Tan Yao had nothing to say.\"Even if I'm really planning to invest, it's my personal action, not related to the company. I don't need to explain it to you as the general manager,\" Tan Liwen said.Tan Yao's brows furrowed. By his father saying this, he was, in a way, admitting it. But this made it even stranger. Did he really want to invest his own money? Did this TV drama really have that much appeal?Or perhaps there was someone else with charm involved. :)Thinking about it, Tan Yao couldn't help but sneer, \"Dad, you're not young anymore, why are you getting tangled up in all these things? You know Mom isn't well; it's better not to get worked up and make yourself ill.\"Tan Liwen frowned upon hearing this, \"What are you talking about? Ha, now you're lecturing me? What tangled up things am I involved in? Explain yourself clearly.\"Tan Yao maintained his cold expression, \"Isn't it the 'mistakes that all men in the world make'? Ha, even if you want to make those mistakes, others won't give you the opportunity.\"\"...Tan Yao! I think you want to rebel!\" Tan Liwen exploded in anger. If the car wasn't still on the road, he would have kicked Tan Yao out.After returning home, Tan Liwen continued to mutter complaints, but Tan Yao didn't want to deal with him. He closed the door and locked himself in his room.Loosening his tie, Tan Yao sat on the couch and messaged Zheng Baozhu: I just asked my dad. It seems like his intention is to invest personally, not as a company action.Zheng Baozhu: Personal investment?Tan Yao: Yeah. Do you and my dad know each other from before?Zheng Baozhu: No, I don't know him.Tan Yao: Oh...Looking at Tan Yao's message, Zheng Baozhu also felt something was off. The Rongtai Group had always avoided getting involved with the entertainment industry. It should be because of Tan Yao's father's personal preference. So, now he suddenly wanted to invest in a personal capacity, which seemed unusual.After thinking for a while, she called her mom. As soon as her mom picked up, Su Mingxi excitedly asked, \"Baozhu, I saw the pictures online, your hotel is practically surrounded. Have you left the hotel? What about Qu Zhi? He's not staying at the hotel, is he?\"\"No, we came over to the villa area in the morning...\" Zheng Baozhu replied.\"That's good, it's safer there. I feel more at ease with you staying there,\" Su Mingxi said and then asked with a meaningful tone, \"You and Qu Zhi, staying in the same room?\"\"No, there are so many rooms in the villa, don't think too much about it, okay?\"\"I'm thinking too much?\" Su Mingxi laughed, \"Both of you are living under the same roof, yet you're afraid of what others might think?\"\"...\"\"You two should consider getting married. Qu Zhi said his parents will be back next month, so we can have a meal together then and discuss the wedding arrangements...\"\"Let's wait until they come back...\" Zheng Baozhu said but then realized they were getting off-topic, \"No, I called you not to talk about this.\"\"Then what do you want to say?\"\"I just wanted to ask...\" Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment, then continued, \"You should calm down a bit...\"\"Are you pregnant?\" Su Mingxi suddenly raised her voice, \"Then I need to contact Qu Zhi's parents even sooner; we should arrange the wedding as soon as possible!\"\"...You're thinking too much. I just wanted to ask about that scumbag my aunt mentioned in the book.\"There was a brief silence from Su Mingxi's end before she continued, \"Back then, your grandmother and I also wanted to know who that person was, but after taking care of the aftermath, we were too busy to investigate further. Later on, we felt it was meaningless to pursue these things; Mingmei wouldn't come back either way.\"Zheng Baozhu remained silent for a while, then asked, \"I don't believe you didn't inquire about this at all. Did you find any clues?\"Su Mingxi asked in return, \"What do you want to do by inquiring about this?\"\"I don't have any plans. Are you worried I'll beat him up or something?\"\"You know what, I think you might actually do that.\"\"...\" Calculating the age, that man should be around fifty now. If she really did something like that, it might lead to a disaster, \"Mom, just tell me, so I have an idea in my mind and won't fail to recognize him if he stands in front of me.\"Su Mingxi considered for a moment before speaking, \"At that time, Mingmei's bodyguard did give us a clue. We asked many staff members, but they couldn't explain it clearly. Later, Mingmei's driver said that during that period, Mingmei often went out to meet a man, and he heard that person was President Tan.\"Zheng Baozhu was stunned for a moment. Although she made this call because of some suspicions in her mind, there was no substantial evidence for her speculations. It was more like a \"gut feeling\". But now the information her mom provided seemed to match with her thoughts, and her heart was slightly stirred.Could it really be Tan Yao's father?\"When we were sorting Mingmei's belongings, we didn't find anything related to that man. Mingmei probably sorted things out in advance,\" Su Mingxi sighed, \"She probably didn't want us to know who that person was, maybe not to affect our family.\"Zheng Baozhu pursed her lips and didn't say anything. That scumbag had a wife and child, so she understood her aunt's concerns. If she revealed this matter, more than one person would be hurt, and it would also involve the scumbag's wife and child.But if she didn't say anything, the scumbag would get away with it, and his wife would remain unaware of the truth.No matter how she looked at it, being a scumbag seemed most advantageous. :)\"Alright, I understand. Let's leave it at that. I'll hang up now,\" Zheng Baozhu ended the call and sat on the sofa, thinking for a moment. Then, she messaged Gao Boyun.Zheng Baozhu: Can you help me get in touch with President Tan from Rongtai Group? I want to meet him.Gao Boyun: ? Why do you want to meet him? He's over fifty years old and not handsome.Zheng Baozhu: ...Can you please try to get in touch for me?Gao Boyun: ...You're so demanding when asking for help.Zheng Baozhu:After a while, Gao Boyun sent President Tan's contact information: This is President Tan's phone number.\"Thank you!\" Zheng Baozhu thanked Gao Boyun and stared at the string of numbers for a while.\"President Tan, this is Zheng Baozhu. Contacting you like this may seem presumptuous, but I have something urgent to discuss with you. Can we meet in person?\" Zheng Baozhu sent a text message to him.She didn't want to find out if he was the man from back then for revenge. She just felt disgusted at the thought that he was investing in[The Pursuit of the Heart].Soon, her phone vibrated, and Zheng Baozhu looked at the screen. It was a reply from Tan Liwen: Sure, I have time tomorrow morning. Where would you like to meet?Now with her status, of course, she had to choose an upscale place, so she arranged to meet at a private club. When Qu Zhi learned that she was going to meet the alleged scumbag from the past, he furrowed his brows, \"It's not safe for you to go alone. I'll accompany you tomorrow.\"\"No need,\" Zheng Baozhu hooked her arm with his and said, \"You already took a day off today because of me, I can't let you take another day off. I can't delay the country's technological development because of my own matters.\"Qu Zhi smiled lightly and patted her head, \"It won't be that serious. I can make up for the day off by working overtime later.\"\"But if you work overtime, won't your colleagues have to work overtime too? It's a team effort, and your independent actions might not be a good idea.\"Qu Zhi frowned but didn't say anything. Zheng Baozhu gently touched his brow and said, \"How about this? Let's have Cen Tongtong accompany me tomorrow. She doesn't have to work, so she'll have more flexibility with time.\"Qu Zhi wasn't very convinced about Cen Tongtong, \"What's the point of having an agoraphobic like Cen Tongtong accompany you? If something happens, who will protect whom?\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and said, \"I arranged the meeting at a private club. If President Tan really dares to do anything, the club's security will throw him out first. Besides, shouldn't you be more worried that I'll put a bag over his head and beat him up tomorrow?\"\"...\" After she said that, he indeed felt a bit worried.In the end, Qu Zhi still compromised but insisted on bringing a few more people. Zheng Baozhu agreed since she didn't mind and brought her assistant with her. They waited outside the club, and Cen Tongtong, who had a club membership card, accompanied Zheng Baozhu inside and sat at a nearby table. Today's main task of the assistant was to observe Zheng Baozhu's table closely, and if anything seemed wrong, they would send a message to the people outside so they could come in.With this series of arrangements, Zheng Baozhu and Cen Tongtong arrived earlier than the agreed time. President Tan also arrived ten minutes early, coming alone without anyone else. It was unclear if he was being cautious or suspicious.President Tan looked as ordinary as described in Su Mingmei's book. Compared to her previous boyfriends, he didn't stand out in looks, but his charm and eloquence had attracted her at the time. However, today when Zheng Baozhu saw him, she just felt that he was a dull middle-aged man and didn't seem interesting at all.\"President Tan, hello,\" Zheng Baozhu stood up when he approached and said, \"I'm Zheng Baozhu. Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.\"Tan Liwen seemed visibly stunned when he saw her. After a moment, he forced a smile and replied, \"Hello.\"Zheng Baozhu smiled back and invited him to sit on the sofa opposite her, \"Let's sit down and talk.\"\"Sure,\" Tan Liwen sat across from Zheng Baozhu, there was some uneasiness between his brows. After observing him for a while, Zheng Baozhu spoke, \"President Tan, your time is precious, so I won't beat around the bush. I wanted to ask you something during this meeting.\"Tan Liwen responded, \"Miss Zheng, feel free to ask directly.\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him and asked, \"Do you know Su Mingmei?\"Tan Liwen's hand, which was reaching for a coffee cup, suddenly froze in mid-air. He stiffened for a moment. Zheng Baozhu glanced at his hand, which stopped midway, and felt that this matter was almost confirmed, \"In fact, Su Mingmei was my aunt. Before her suicide, she wrote a letter mentioning you.\"Tan Liwen looked up in shock, gazing at Zheng Baozhu. She looked back at him, her gaze calm without revealing much.Beside them, the assistant observed silently and admired Zheng Baozhu. She truly deserved to be called the \"Ceiling of Society\"! The middle-aged man in front of her had the aura of a superior, naturally intimidating to younger people, but Zheng Baozhu showed no fear in front of him! Truly, she was their boss!Tan Liwen withdrew his hand completely and placed it on the table, clenching his fist. \"Su Mingmei left a farewell letter?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"The letter was not made public; only our family knew about it. At that time, my aunt already suffered from severe depression, but she met a man who was witty and humorous, always able to make her smile. She thought this man was her lifesaver, but he turned out to be the last straw that broke the camel's back.\"Tan Liwen's eyes suddenly reddened, and his emotions became obvious, \"I'm sorry. When I heard about her death, I was completely stunned. I knew that I must have had something to do with her...\"He became more agitated, and his nails dug deeply into his palms. \"It's all my fault, it's my fault! At that time, I even thought about going with her! But, but I...\"\"But you still have a wife and children, right?\" Zheng Baozhu sneered, \"Now you remember that you have a family and responsibility? When you pursued my aunt, why didn't you think about them?\"\"I... I really didn't mean to,\" Tan Liwen looked up, desperately trying to explain to Zheng Baozhu, \"Mingmei was truly a charming person. I believe no man in the world could resist her...\"\"Oh, so, in the end, it's still her fault, isn't it?\"\"That's not what I meant,\" Tan Liwen took a deep breath and continued, \"I was tempted for a moment. When we met, I deliberately took off my wedding ring... If I had known it would end up like this, I would never have...\"Zheng Baozhu sneered, cutting him off, \"Enough, your repentance means nothing to me. I just wanted to ask President Tan, what do you mean by intentionally investing in 'The\u00a0Pursuit of the Heart'? Is it to disgust me?\"\"Of course not,\" Tan Liwen looked up, seeming surprised by the thought, \"Actually, when you were gaining popularity online, I noticed you. You look so much like Mingmei that I knew you must be related to her. Later, when Yu Wei used the withdrawal threat against you, I wanted to help you...\"\"Thank you for your kind intentions, but we don't need it. Our production team is not lacking investors.\"Looking at Tan Liwen, Zheng Baozhu continued with a hint of coldness, \"I know you won't be forgiven, but I just want to say...\"Tan Liwen looked at her and pursed his somewhat dry lips, \"I know you won't forgive me, but I just thought...\"\"Thought what? Thought of redeeming yourself?\" Zheng Baozhu chuckled, \"My aunt doesn't need it, and neither do we. If you truly want to redeem yourself, go and make amends with your wife and children.\"After saying that, Zheng Baozhu picked up her bag and was about to leave. As she stood up, she glanced back at Tan Liwen and said with a faint smile, \"Oh, by the way, I lied to you earlier. There's nothing about you in my aunt's letter. It was all my guesswork.\" She then turned toward him and smiled slightly, \"You were never worthy of being mentioned in my aunt's letter.\"Today, Tan Yao seemed to be in an uneasy mood, sitting in his office, unable to concentrate on work. He decided to open Weibo and check today's news.On the trending list, there was the ever-present Zheng Baozhu, and now there was a new hot topic about her.\"Zheng Baozhu and Su Mingmei?\" Tan Yao was momentarily taken aback. The name Su Mingmei was not unfamiliar to him. Although not a star of this era, Su Mingmei's works and songs were widely known, with her song [First Love] being a perennial favorite on their KTV's classic nostalgia chart.However, how could Zheng Baozhu and Su Mingmei be related?Tan Yao clicked on the trending topic; suddenly his heart skipped a beat. He had never noticed it before, but Zheng Baozhu did bear some resemblance to Su Mingmei!When he connected the two, he was suddenly overwhelmed with emotions, realizing that he had missed something obvious. Zheng Baozhu does look somewhat like Su Mingmei!!As he scrolled through the trending topic, his fingertips were trembling slightly.\u300cDidn't expect this, right? There's more to Zheng Baozhu's gossip! After the release of her entrepreneurial history, another classmate has come forward with a submission, claiming that they were classmates in elementary school. Back then, all the classmates knew that Zheng Baozhu's aunt was Su Mingmei! \u300dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe person who\u00a0submitted the post had their name and profile picture censored, but their message was still published.\u300cQuan Quan! I\u00a0want to share some information!\u300d\u300cDidn't you mention Zheng Baozhu before? I was her elementary school classmate, and back then, she talked about her aunt being Su Mingmei!\u300d\u300cShe even wrote an essay boasting about it and the whole class knew! But at that time, many people didn't believe it...\u300d\u300cLater, she became the spokesperson for JS, and when my mom and I were shopping in the mall, we saw posters of her for JS. My mom pointed and said, 'Isn't this your elementary school classmate?'\u300d\u300cZheng Baozhu was already very beautiful in elementary school and she definitely didn't have plastic surgery! Her name was unique, so I remember it even now! I never thought my mom would remember too. She told me that many parents knew her aunt was Su Mingmei. They even discussed it during the parent-teacher meetings. \u300d\u300cThere's not much evidence, but I feel like it must be true. \u300dAfter reading the submission, Tan Yao sat in front of the computer for a long time, feeling a bit overwhelmed. Although the submission lacked solid evidence and relied on mere text, Tan Yao couldn't help but believe it was mostly true.So, is it possible that his father didn't actually like Zheng Baozhu but had a crush on Su Mingmei? Could it be that his father was a fan of Su Ming during his younger days? And perhaps her suicide deeply affected him, causing him to avoid the entertainment industry ever since?...Everything seems to make sense now.Online discussions and speculations about the relationship between Zheng Baozhu and Su Mingmei were rampant, some even made comparison charts to find scientific evidence.\u300cOh my gosh, I don't know much about Su Mingmei, just heard her name, but now that I see this comparison chart, Baozhu really looks like her!\u300d\u300cIf it's not plastic surgery, the only explanation is a blood relation, right?\u300d\u300cWell, not necessarily. In reality, there are people who look very similar without any blood relation.\u300d\u300cHaha, I wonder if the person who said Zheng Baozhu had plastic surgery to look like Su Ming is regretting it now. \u300d\u300cAm I the only one curious to read Baozhu's essay? Hahaha!\u300d\u300cPeople often bear resemblances. The more we look at it, the more alike they seem.\u300d\u300cAh, but this doesn't really matter, Baozhu herself hasn't brought it up.\u300d\u300cI agree with the previous comments. Maybe she avoids talking about it because Su Ming's death was a sensitive issue. Let's not delve too much into it.\u300dAfter finishing her conversation with Tan Liwen, Zheng Baozhu returned to the villa with Cen Tongtong. She hadn't paid attention to what was trending online. It was only when Zhou Xiaonan called her that she found out she was on the hot search again.\"Baozhu, you're Su Mingmei's niece? How come you didn't tell me such important information!\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback and sat up straight, asking, \"How did you find out?\"\"There's a post online from your elementary school classmate, but there's no solid evidence, so now everyone is speculating,\" Zhou Xiaonan browsed the web page while speaking on the phone with Zheng Baozhu, \"So, is it true?\"\"...Yes, I didn't intentionally keep it from you. It's just that there have been too many things happening recently, and I hadn't even considered this.\"\"It's alright, this matter... doesn't really matter. After all, it's your private affairs and you're not obligated to explain it to netizens. Once the hype dies down, people won't discuss it anymore.\"\"Okay... But I'm worried that someone might use this as a topic to create controversies.\"\"I'll have people keep an eye on the internet. If someone deliberately causes trouble, we'll figure out a countermeasure.\"\"Alright,\" Zheng Baozhu hung up the phone and furrowed her brows slightly. It didn't bother her much, but she was worried that her family might feel upset again seeing Su Mingmei's name resurfacing in public.\"What's wrong?\" Cen Tongtong noticed her frowning and couldn't help but ask, \"Is there another problem?\"Zheng Baozhu sighed and propped her head with one hand, \"Not really, someone online revealed that my aunt was Su Ming, and I'm worried that my mom and others might feel uncomfortable seeing it again.\"\"Ah? Who's so bored to do that?\" Cen Tongtong said while opening Weibo, \"Being a celebrity these days means having your entire family history checked? How about you call your mom first to prepare her mentally?\"After some consideration, Zheng Baozhu nodded and called her mom. At this time, her mom should be preparing lunch. The phone rang for a while before someone answered, \"Baozhu, what's up?\"Zheng Baozhu carefully said, \"Mom, I want to tell you about something, but please don't get angry.\"\"...What is it again?\"\"There's this person online claiming to be my elementary school classmate, saying that my aunt was Su Mingmei.\"\"...\" Su Mingxi stayed silent for a moment and then raised her voice, \"What kind of people are on the internet? They bring up any trivial matter to talk about, don't they?\"\"Ah, well, my aunt was quite famous back then.\"\"Isn't it because you boasted about it? What did you tell your classmates?\"\"...I was just a primary school student, how would I know so much! Look at Yao Yao, she also told her classmates that she's related to me! She even asked me for ten signed photos of Lin Ziqin!\"\"...\" Su Mingxi had no words to say.\"And I actually read the post that classmate made. It's because her parents didn't do a good job of keeping things under wraps. Don't blame me for it,\" Zheng Baozhu retorted, \"I called you today just to let you know in advance so that you won't be caught off guard if you see Aunt's name mentioned online.\"\"It won't come to that, alright, I get it. I'll look into it myself,\" Su Mingxi said before hanging up the phone.As Zheng Baozhu put her phone away, it rang again. Cen Tongtong was sitting beside her, scrolling through Weibo, and couldn't help but sigh, \"President Zheng, you really are busy.\"\"Tell me about it,\" Zheng Baozhu picked up the phone and glanced at it. It was Zhou Xiaonan calling again, \"What's up? Is it another trending topic about me?\"\"Forget about trending topics; it's about becoming a spokesperson!\" Zhou Xiaonan's voice was full of excitement, \"Remember the Zhenyi Jewelry?\"\"Zhenyi Jewelry?\" Zheng Baozhu was momentarily confused.\"I told you before that Sun Jing's contract with them was about to expire, right? After the expiration, they extended it for a month but didn't give a clear answer until yesterday.\"Zhou Xiaonan had previously informed Zheng Baozhu that Zhenyi Jewelry's crown prince had been sidelined for a long time but recently regained control of the company. The choice of spokesperson was an external representation of the power struggle between the two factions. However, they couldn't reach a conclusion, so the spokesperson contract had been dragged on.\"Now it seems that the situation in their company has finally settled down and the ambitious crown prince has won!\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu remained silent for a moment and asked Zhou Xiaonan, \"Hold on, why are you so excited? What's your connection with Zhenyi's crown prince?\"\"...I have no connection with him, but I have a connection with you!\" Zhou Xiaonan explained, \"Zhenyi used to hire established actresses like Su Ming as their spokesperson. But in recent years, the faction that gained power had a different management philosophy and believed they should follow the trend of using popular celebrities. So, they chose Sun Jing. Now that the crown prince faction has regained control, they must be going back to their original path.\"Zheng Baozhu blinked, \"Ah, I see. So, they've actually recognized me as a serious actress? I feel a bit embarrassed.\"\"...\" This time, Zhou Xiaonan fell silent for a moment, \"I think they really like Su Mingmei.\"After all, after Su Mingmei's incident years ago, they hadn't employed any new spokesperson for a long time.Zheng Baozhu scoffed, \"Oh, I get it now. I'm just a substitute? What a scumbag!\"Zhou Xiaonan: \"...\"How did the conversation suddenly shift from palace intrigue to someone's backup plan?Coughing lightly, Zhou Xiaonan redirected the conversation back on track, \"Anyway, that's the situation. They've extended an olive branch to you. It's up to you whether to accept it or not. I respect your decision.\"Having known Zheng Baozhu for this period of time, Zhou Xiaonan felt that Zheng Baozhu was hesitant about using Su Mingmei's name to advance her career. It seemed that she cared about this matter or didn't want to rely on her aunt's fame to gain recognition.After considering for a while, Zheng Baozhu asked, \"Why do you think Zhenyi wants to hire me as their spokesperson?\"Zhou Xiaonan explained, \"Firstly, as I mentioned before, the crown prince has regained control, so they must be looking for someone different from Sun Jing. Secondly, remember the spring photo shoot you did where you wore Zhenyi's jewelry? That attracted some attention and laid the foundation. Thirdly, they genuinely admire Su Ming. I overheard the person in charge mention that Zhenyi's patriarch specifically wanted you as their spokesperson.\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu was taken aback.The patriarch is truly Su Mingmei's real uncle; he's even more influential than the current top star.\"Yeah, I think...,\" Zheng Baozhu found herself unsure, \"They may like my aunt, not necessarily me, and that bothers me a bit. But on the other hand, I like this brand, and I'd be happy to be their spokesperson.\"\"Well, actually, I think you're overthinking it. They chose you, so you must have your own value, and they're not charity; they won't give you an endorsement fee for nothing,\" Zhou Xiaonan said logically.\"You're right... But I'm worried that if I accept, netizens will start criticizing me again, saying I'm getting endorsements through my aunt's connections!\"\"Hah, you're too naive. Do you think if you don't accept, they won't say anything?\" Zhou Xiaonan chuckled, \"Back then, Su Mingmei had acted in 'New Moon Wuxin Sword', so now some people are already saying that took on the new iteration of 'New Moon Wuxin Sword' using your aunt's connection.\"\"??!\" Zheng Baozhu's temper flared up again, \"Why are they so meddlesome? It's like they're targeting me every day! Am I not using my aunt's name for nothing if could only land to play Ye Ling?\"\"That's why I'm saying you're getting tangled up in unnecessary things. No matter how well you do, they'll always find a way to criticize you,\" Zhou Xiaonan advised, \"So, instead of worrying about that, why not accept the offer, make them angry, and earn money? As for why the brand chose you, you don't have to worry about that. They must have made that decision after evaluating various factors. If the patriarch's words were that influential, the crown prince wouldn't have been sidelined for so many years.\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu was completely convinced. She felt that Zhou Xiaonan's talent for negotiating was a wasted opportunity in not going to the mall! She had the other party's intentions firmly in her grasp.\"Alright, let's do something big!\" Zheng Baozhu declared, not allowing the haters to get to her!After agreeing, the legal team immediately began the contract signing process. During this time, Zheng Baozhu took the opportunity to check the trend on Weibo. Netizens were still actively discussing the matter. If they had put in that much effort during their university entrance exams, Weibo would have been filled with top university students.She also noticed comments suggesting that she got to play Ye Ling through Su Mingmei's connections. She was tempted to create a fake account and argue with them a few times, but considering her announcement as Zhenyi's spokesperson, she resisted the urge.So, she let them enjoy their last moments of revelry.\"Haven't slept yet?\" Qu Zhi walked out of the bathroom after taking a shower and looked at Zheng Baozhu, who was sitting on the bed, propping herself up with one hand, and kicking her slippers with her feet.\"I can't sleep. It's been a turbulent day,\" Zheng Baozhu said, grinning as she watched Qu Zhi blow-dry his hair.Qu Zhi smiled and took out the hairdryer, filling the room with its buzzing sound, \"They should give you an award on Weibo. You single-handedly boosted their KPI!\"Zheng Baozhu also laughed and watched the man dry his hair after coming out of the shower. Suddenly, an idea came to her, \"Qu Zhi, let me blow-dry your hair!\"Qu Zhi turned back to look at her and handed her the hairdryer. Zheng Baozhu walked over in her slippers and started blow-drying Qu Zhi's hair, doing it in a somewhat professional manner, \"Do you want me to style it for you?\"\"No, thank you. Just dry it.\"\"Alright then,\" Zheng Baozhu imitated the tone of a hairstylist in a salon and asked Qu Zhi, \"Your hair quality is quite good. What shampoo do you usually use?\"Qu Zhi looked at the mirror, \"I use the one you have in the bathroom.\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu gave him a sharp look, annoyed that he wasn't cooperating. Seeing her reaction, he couldn't help but laugh, \"You're such a grown-up, and you still like to play house?\"\"I have a young heart, so what?\" Zheng Baozhu shrugged at him, \"But you, why did you come to my room to take a shower when I already arranged a room for you?\"Qu Zhi calmly replied, \"I don't know why, but I just feel that the shower in your room is better.\"\"Oh, then why don't we switch rooms?\"\"No need, moving around is too much trouble,\" Qu Zhi said resolutely, \"I'll just come over to take a shower every night.\"\"...\" How can a scientist behave so naturally while being flirty?\"Okay, it's done,\" Qu Zhi's short hair was easy to blow dry quickly. He turned his head to check his hair's dryness and told Zheng Baozhu, \"It's dry now.\"\"Oh, good,\" Zheng Baozhu turned off the hairdryer and sighed somewhat enviously, \"Short hair is so convenient. It takes me forever to blow-dry my hair! Maybe I should get a short haircut too!\"\"If you like it, then go for it. I don't mind,\" Qu Zhi replied.Zheng Baozhu looked at him, \"Really? Meng Yaxin's ex-boyfriend broke up with her just because she changed her hairstyle!\"Qu Zhi said, \"That was that particular man's problem. It doesn't mean that all men have the same issue.\"\"Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu sat closer to him, wrapping her arms around his neck and smiling playfully, \"But you must have a preference for a certain hairstyle, right?\"Qu Zhi held her waist, and with his other hand gently caressed her hair, \"I personally like long hair, but when I thought about it just now, I realized that you would look good in short hair too.\"As he spoke, he lightly kissed Zheng Baozhu on the top of her head, \"Maybe it's mainly because it's you. Any hairstyle suits you.\"\"So sweet?\" Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow teasingly, moving closer to Qu Zhi, \"It seems like you have a motive.\"Qu Zhi slowly curved his lips, his beautiful eyes filled with Zheng Baozhu's reflection, \"What motive? Don't you know?\"Before Zheng Baozhu could reply, Qu Zhi's kiss silenced her. She knew that tonight, Qu Zhi didn't plan on returning to his own room again.The next day was the weekend, and Qu Zhi didn't have to work. He woke up early and found Zheng Baozhu still asleep. He went to his room, spent some time writing his paper, and then calculated the time to prepare breakfast in the kitchen.Smelling the faint aroma of breakfast, Zheng Baozhu woke up on her own. Qu Zhi wasn't in bed; he must have been up for quite some time. She sent him a message and lay in bed, playing with her phone lazily.Qu Zhi: I'm making breakfast, come over when you're ready. Brush your teeth first.Zheng Baozhu: Sure.She replied and stayed in bed, skillfully scrolling through content on Weibo.It seemed that the online discussions had an impact. The official Weibo account of the drama [New Moon Wuxin Sword] posted a Weibo to clarify the casting issue.New Moon Wuxin Sword V: Regarding whether Zheng Baozhu is Su Mingmei's niece or not, the crew doesn't know and cannot provide an answer. When we found Zheng Baozhu, she was just a contracted actor in the Film and Television City. We selected her for the role of Ye Ling through a formal audition process. Zheng Baozhu's acting skills are evident to the crew members. We made a short video specifically for everyone to enjoy. [Link] Also, thank you for your attention to [New Moon Wuxin Sword]. The post-production is almost complete, and we will meet you in the second half of the year. [Link]Zheng Baozhu was overjoyed and clicked on the video attached to the Weibo post, watching it with great interest. The video was only about thirty seconds long, indeed a short one, but it compiled all of her action scenes, mostly fight scenes. Zheng Baozhu's movements were sharp and beautiful, showing strength and agility at the same time.The previous official trailer released by the crew was only a little over a minute long, but this time they managed to cut a thirty-second compilation of her solo scenes!This move was a win, and there was no need to say more. Thank you, haters.As Zheng Baozhu's popularity surged recently, the comments on this Weibo post were similar to the ones on the previous official trailer.\u300cAh, it looks so good! This is what a Wuxia should be like!!\u300d\u300cFinally, no more slow-motion shots! Please use this standard for all the fight scenes in the future!\u300d\u300cZheng Baozhu is too amazing! What kind of immortal is she?!\u00a0\u300d\u300cThe fight scenes are indeed beautiful, but you can still tell that dance skills are being used instead of actual martial arts. Nowadays, it seems there are no actors with real martial arts skills left. Although it's a bit regrettable, this is much better than what I've seen before. \u300d\u300cNow! Immediately! Give us the release date! Don't underestimate our support!!!\u300d\u300cI really want to see the full movie. Don't tell me the second half of the year means December?\u300d\u300cI love liking posts that counter the haters of Zheng Baozhu. \u300dZheng Baozhu happily reposted the Weibo and then surprised them even more unexpectedly.Due to the delay in the announcement of Zheng Baozhu becoming the new spokesperson for Zhenyi Jewelry, after officially signing the contract with her, they didn't even have time to shoot the endorsement poster. They decided to announce the news first.Zhenyi Jewelry V: Welcome @Zheng Baozhu to be the new spokesperson for Zhenyi Jewelry! In the future, we will work together with Zheng Baozhu to progress and move forward side by side! Additionally, Zhenyi Jewelry will sponsor all the jewelry needed for the filming of [The Pursuit of the Heart] drama! [Link]This was undoubtedly a heavyweight announcement, causing various parties to come out in excitement. Amidst the fierce competition, Zheng Baozhu, who had been silent for so many days, finally responded to the matter regarding Su Mingmei.Zheng Baozhu V: Hello, everyone, I am Zheng Baozhu. Su Mingmei was indeed my aunt, and I do not deny that. When I first wanted to become an actor, it was because of her influence. I have never publicly claimed my relationship with Su Mingmei (except during elementary school) because it's my family matter, and I didn't want to bring it up deliberately. Moreover, I don't want people to know me primarily through Su Mingmei. When you think of me, I hope the first thing that comes to your mind is Zheng Baozhu, not 'Su Mingmei's neice'.Being an actor has always been my dream, and it was my aunt who inspired me. However, because of my aunt's situation, my family was against me pursuing an acting career (which has now been resolved). So when I took the university entrance exam, I couldn't apply for a film academy. Initially, I could only work as an extra in the Film and Television City. Over the years, no matter what setbacks I faced, I never gave up my dream of becoming an actor. In the future, I will continue to pursue it.Let me introduce myself again. I am Zheng Baozhu, and my dream is to become an actress loved by a wide audience.At the end of the Weibo post, there was a photo. The photo showed a torn and reassembled essay from third grade.Those weathered traces witnessed the journey thus far and would continue to witness the journey ahead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You can sleep a bit more.\"Looking up, Zheng Baozhu casually wrapped her arms around his slim waist, \"I won't sleep anymore; I need to deal with yesterday's mess.\"Qu Zhi lifted her head and said, \"Then I'll make breakfast for you.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu replied and went to wash up in the bathroom. When she came out, Qu Zhi was no longer there, but there was breakfast from the restaurant on the table. She walked over and picked up a glass of milk, took a sip, and as she sat down on the sofa, she received a message from Zhou Xiaonan: Are you up? The PR team finished writing the draft. Take a look, and if there are no issues, I'll have them post it.Zheng Baozhu opened and looked at the drafted statement. The statement was concise and clear, acknowledging Zheng Baozhu's relationship with Qu Zhi and clarifying that the previous internet rumors about \"Qu Zhi being a member of Zheng Baozhu's studio\" were false. It also urged everyone not to excessively focus on artists' personal lives and finally condemned the person who leaked private photos, reserving the right to pursue legal action.The statement was well-written and comprehensive. Zheng Baozhu felt there were no problems and replied to Zhou Xiaonan with an \"OK\" emoji.With the approval, the studio's official Weibo quickly posted the statement, complete with the official stamp. Netizens seemed to be waiting for this response, as a flood of comments appeared as soon as the Weibo was published. Of course, there were supporters defending Zheng Baozhu, encouraging everyone to focus on her work. However, there were also some comments challenging her, questioning what work she had to be focused on.\"...Hmph!\" Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but laugh in exasperation. Even though her works hadn't been released yet, the photoshoots she had done were also part of her work. Taking beautiful photos for magazine spreads was also challenging and required a lot of acting skills. It's not like she could just stand there and call it a day!But she knew arguing with netizens about this was pointless. As long as her projects weren't released, they would use this to criticize her every day. After calming her mind while sitting on the sofa, she decided to repost the statement on her own Weibo and added some additional clarifications.Zheng Baozhu V: Mr. Qu and I have been childhood sweethearts since we were very young. After he graduated from high school, he studied abroad and only returned to the country at the end of last year. We only got together recently. He is not from the entertainment industry, so I don't want to share too much information about him. I can only say that he is even busier with work than I am, so please don't worry that my relationship will affect my work. \u00a0I believe a competent adult can balance work and personal life. Thank you all for your concern ^^.After posting her Weibo, the comments poured in even more intensely than the studio's post. While people knew that she was in a relationship with Qu Zhi, they didn't expect them to be childhood sweethearts! The popularity of their CP pairing skyrocketed, and under Zheng Baozhu's Weibo post, people enthusiastically explained the details of Qu Zhi's background.\u300cMr. Qu is involved in scientific research. He and Baozhu attended a charity gala together before, and it even trended. At that time, not many people paid attention to Baozhu, so some of you might not know about it. If you're interested, here's the [Link]!\u300d\u300cMr. Qu is truly handsome, kind-hearted, and intelligent! He's a perfect match for our Baozhu! He even gave a charity lecture at an elementary school before. Check it out! [Link]\u300d\u300cWuwuwu! childhood sweethearts are so adorable! Mom, I finally get to see this for real!\u00a0\u300d\u300cSisters, our brother-in-law is not only handsome but also highly intelligent. He's a rare find! And they've been childhood sweethearts! How can we not be excited about this? \u00a0And they are a perfect match!\u300d\u300cBaozhu has good taste in men! Mr. Qu is amazing! \u300dZheng Baozhu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Ah, she felt like Qu Zhi was even more popular than herself!Aside from these highly praised comments, there were also some negative remarks, but Zheng Baozhu knew she couldn't please everyone. Although some of the comments upset her, she believed that as more of her works release one by one, there would be more viewers who would appreciate her work.As she was thinking about this, her phone buzzed again; it was Meng Yaxin sending her a new message.Meng Yaxin: I saw your Weibo. Are you admitting now that you and Qu Zhi are childhood sweethearts? Weren't you always calling him your enemy before?Zheng Baozhu: Everything changes with time, people are no exception.Meng Yaxin: \u2026\u2026Huh, people.Zheng Baozhu: I'm not going to argue with you. I need to read the script now!Zheng Baozhu wasn't making up an excuse to avoid Meng Yaxin; she genuinely had to read the script. [The Pursuit of the Heart] had already released the official casting poster and was recruiting actors for some roles that had not been finalized yet. Gao Boyun had scheduled a time to hold a script-reading session with them.During the script reading session, apart from the director and screenwriter, the cinematographer, sound recorder, producer, and main actors were all present, even including Lin Ziqin. Zheng Baozhu thought that someone as busy and popular as him probably wouldn't attend a script reading, but now it seemed that Lin Ziqin valued the quality of the performance more than making money.It was Zheng Baozhu's first time attending a script reading session, and she was a bit nervous. It felt a bit like when she used to stand up and read texts in front of the teacher. Due to time constraints, they only selected a few scenes for the script reading and discussion. After a few hours, they gained a lot.After this period of settling down, the news about Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi gradually faded from the internet, and the situation stabilized. Fans of the CP and ordinary fans didn't interfere with each other.During the relatively quiet period in the entertainment industry, [The Pursuit of the Heart] officially announced its main cast.Lin Ziqin was currently the top male artist in the industry, and all aspects of his life were under scrutiny. When [The Pursuit of the Heart] first contacted him, rumors about him playing the male lead in the drama surfaced online. However, since the production team hadn't made an official announcement, they pretended not to know.Various versions of the casting for the male lead were circulating, including mentions of Zheng Baozhu. If the rumors about Lin Ziqin playing the male lead hadn't been leaked, there wouldn't have been so much attention on the male lead role. After all, this was an original script and not a drama based on a popular IP. However, because Lin Ziqin had a huge following, the male lead role had been closely watched.Unexpectedly, without any signs or preparation, the production team finally made an official announcement today![The Pursuit of the Heart]\u00a0official Weibo account had been active for some time, previously only posting casting calls. Today, alongside the announcement of the male lead, they also released two characters' official photos.TV drama - The Pursuit of the Heart: He is the legendary businessman Duan Lanying in the Republic of China, played by Lin Ziqin, who walks between the dark and light, and nobody can guess his heart. She is the wealthy daughter, Zhao Jinghong, played by Zheng Baozhu, who hides her true feelings behind innocence, but a single glimpse reveals her stunning beauty. In that era, how will their fates intertwine? What will happen to national grudges and family hatred? Welcome to watch the Republic of China's commercial war drama [The Pursuit of the Heart].Although this promotional message is full of clich\u00e9s, people don't care to criticize it because the four makeup photos below are all stunning.The production team released four makeup photos at once, two for each of the male lead and female lead. In one set, Lin Ziqin wore a Republic of China-style gown with delicate embroidery, showing an elegant scholarly temperament; in the other set, he wore a fitted suit with meticulous workmanship, exuding a powerful aura.As for Zheng Baozhu, one set featured a lively and cute sundress, perfectly combining the charm and grace of a wealthy young lady. The other set showcased an intricately embroidered dark red cheongsam, matched with a refined updo and stunning makeup, exuding a sense of dangerous allure.Both actors demonstrated strong rendition skills, and the two sets of photos showcased completely different auras, but the only common point was that they looked incredibly attractive!Lin Ziqin and Zheng Baozhu's fans went crazy in the comments; Lin Ziqin fans were too busy being ecstatic to even remember to complain about the casting choice.As for the Lin Ziqin and Zheng Baozhu CP, it was rejuvenated! After Zheng Baozhu publicly announced her relationship with Qu Zhi, their CP momentum declined, and many people stopped discussing it in their fan communities. But now, their CP fans were back in full force, celebrating as if it were New Year's.In celebration of this historic moment, they even applied for a new fan community, [ZhengQiLinRan] (Zheng Baozhu's energy and Lin Ziqin's charisma). It perfectly suited their current revitalized and radiant spirits!Zheng Baozhu, busy replying to comments, suddenly noticed that the CP [ZhengQiLinRan] had unexpectedly resurged. Compared to Qu Zhi, who was presented as her brother-in-law, Zheng Baozhu's solo fans definitely had a lower opinion of Lin Ziqin. Any association with Lin Ziqin would subject them to his fans' scrutiny and criticism. As for the CP fans of Qu Zhi-Zheng Baozhu, this surge in another CP was even more unbearable for them. How could Qu Zhi, their brother-in-law, lose face like that?So they also applied for a new fan community, [MingZhengQu] (Bright Zheng Qu). They were confidently proclaiming that they were the perfect match!Amidst the ongoing battle between CP fan communities, some people noticed that Zheng Baozhu's career had secretly made a comeback.Bringing Happiness to the Entertainment Circle: Ahhhh! Baozhu is awesome!!! Her acting skills are so strong!!! This drama will definitely be a big hit!!! Baozhu, fighting!\u300cOh, if I remember correctly, you were the one who wrote the short essay back then, right? [Picking nose]\u300d\u300cHaha, the shortest time in history! It seems no one can escape the 'true fragrance' law! \u300d\u300cWelcome to the sit-up live event, I am a reporter in the front. \u300dBecause there were too many comments, the person with the username [Bringing Happiness to the Entertainment Circle] posted another message.\u300cHello everyone, I am back. \u300dAfter this user's comment, many others also returned, all attracted back by Zheng Baozhu's two photos. Zheng Baozhu getting the lead role undoubtedly injected a booster shot for them. Zheng Baozhu Weibo also saw an increase in followers. Her followers were close to breaking eight million in just a blink of an eye, jokingly saying that at this rate, she would directly reach ten million followers soon.The drama team also had the male lead post a Weibo, and soon, Zheng Baozhu's Weibo was flooded with fans praising them as a perfect match.\"Sister Xiaonan, am I going to become popular?\" Zheng Baozhu excitedly jumped to Zhou Xiaonan, holding her phone. Although Zhou Xiaonan was also happy, she remained calm and reminded her, \"You'll only become popular if you act well. If you don't, you might just get burned.\"\"...\"Did Sister Xiaonan borrow this line from Qu Zhi?\"Also, fans of Lin Ziqin think your popularity is not enough...\"Before Zhou Xiaonan could finish, Zheng Baozhu interrupted, \"But there are others who think I look super attractive!\"\"Hmm,\" If Zheng Baozhu's makeup photo didn't have such a good effect, she would have already been criticized by Lin Ziqin's fans, \"Just remember to stay grounded and focus on your acting. Besides Lin Ziqin's fans, there are other celebrities' fans who are also nitpicking. If you mess up, they'll be the first to laugh at you.\"\"I know, I'll do my best in acting!\" The official filming was scheduled to start in October, and they would be going to another city since City A's film studio's Republican-era street wasn't as extensive as H City's.Before the official shooting, Gao Boyun arranged for another script reading session next month, and more actors would participate in this one.Feeling happy, Zheng Baozhu invited the staff from her studio to dinner, and she also invited Qu Zhi along. Qu Zhi didn't like these team-building activities, but he was afraid that Zheng Baozhu might drink too much alone outside, so he rushed over to join them.Zheng Baozhu booked two large private rooms at Tianxia Restaurant. The partition between the rooms could be removed to create a super-large private space. The studio's staff had grown in number, so two large tables were fully occupied.Qu Zhi arrived later as he was coming back from work. Zheng Baozhu originally thought of having everyone start eating without waiting for him, but it turned out that their attention was more focused on Qu Zhi.With everyone's eager anticipation, Qu Zhi was finally led into the private room. As the door opened, dozens of eyes immediately fell on him. Qu Zhi's steps paused for a moment, then he walked towards Zheng Baozhu and said, \"Sorry, I just got off work, that's why I'm late.\"\"Not at all, we're already happy that you could come,\" Zhou Xiaonan, as a representative, stood up to welcome Qu Zhi, \"Come, sit here next to Baozhu, we've reserved a seat for you.\"\"Thank you,\" Qu Zhi thanked them and took a seat next to Zheng Baozhu.Everyone's eyes were still fixed on him as he and Zheng Baozhu settled down.Zheng Baozhu thought that being stared at by her staff in the hotel was already awkward enough, but now she realized that it wasn't; this was even more awkward. :)\"Uh, well...\" Zheng Baozhu said to the waiter by the door, \"Since everyone's here, let's start serving the dishes.\"\"Sure,\" the waiter nodded and went out to arrange the dishes.Zheng Baozhu coughed lightly and said to Qu Zhi, \"Let me introduce you. These two are my assistants, you've met them before. Here are our colleagues from the business department, here are the public relations team, here is the finance department, administration, legal, and promotion...\"One by one, Zheng Baozhu introduced the departments of her studio to Qu Zhi. After listening, Qu Zhi smiled and commented, \"Although it's small, it's well-rounded.\"Seeing his smile, two of the colleagues cheered, and when Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi looked over, one of them, the lively administrative staff, boldly said, \"Brother-in-law looks so handsome, even more handsome than in the photos! And he's smiling at our boss!\"Now everyone started to smile ambiguously. Zheng Baozhu had to steady her emotions and not let her face turn red amid their laughter, \"What's so strange about him smiling at me? You guys haven't seen the world!\"\"Exactly, exactly!\" Another colleague chimed in, teasingly, \"It's nothing for him to smile, considering your relationship! Miss Baozhu is right. We just haven't seen the world!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"What kind of words were these?Fortunately, the waiter quickly brought the dishes, and everyone was occupied with eating.After drinking some wine, when they were leaving, Zheng Baozhu playfully clung to Qu Zhi, asking him to carry her, \"Carry me, if you don't carry me, I won't leave.\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Her colleagues nearby were understanding and said, \"We'll leave now, we didn't see anything!\"Zheng Baozhu still held onto Qu Zhi's sleeve. With a sigh, Qu Zhi squatted down in front of her and said, \"Climb up.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her hands wrapped around Qu Zhi's neck and she was holding a bunch of flowers that she somehow got from inside the private room.Qu Zhi stood up with her on his back and looked at the flowers in his hand, asking, \"Where did these flowers come from?\"Zheng Baozhu replied, \"I just took them from the private room.\"\"...You just took them without asking?\"The nearby waiter overheard their conversation and smiled, \"It's okay. If Miss Zheng likes it, consider it a gift.\"\"Did you hear that? They said it's a gift for me,\" Zheng Baozhu proudly shook the flowers in front of Qu Zhi. He reached back to grab her hand and gently pulled it away, warning her, \"Be careful not to fall.\"Following his warning, Zheng Baozhu obediently held onto his shoulders, picked a flower from the bouquet, and gently tucked it into Qu Zhi's hair without him noticing. The waiter on the side couldn't help but stifle a laugh. Zheng Baozhu turned her head and made a \"shush\" gesture.The waiter nodded, not saying a word. Qu Zhi carried Zheng Baozhu on his back all the way out of Tianxia Restaurant to where their car was waiting. After the assistant brought Zheng Baozhu's car over, he poked his head out and asked Qu Zhi, \"Qu...\"Before he could say \"Mr. Qu\", his gaze was drawn to the little flower on Qu Zhi's head. Zheng Baozhu blinked playfully, and the assistant understood, pretending not to notice the flower on Qu Zhi's head, \"Mr. Qu, should I drive you back, or will you be driving Miss Baozhu home?\"Qu Zhi would probably choose the latter option because he didn't drink much that night, so he would want to drive Zheng Baozhu home.Qu Zhi indeed chose the latter option, \"You go back with everyone first, I'll drive Baozhu home.\"\"Alright,\" The assistant opened the car door and got out of the car. He glanced at the flower on Qu Zhi's head, smiling at him, \"Then I'll go back first. Take care of yourselves, Mr. Qu and Miss Baozhu.\"\"Okay,\" Qu Zhi nodded slightly, then turned to look at Zheng Baozhu, who was still clinging to him, \"Are you sober now? If you are, come down.\"\"Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu replied and jumped down from Qu Zhi's back. She consciously walked to the passenger seat, opened the door, and sat inside. Qu Zhi took the driver's seat, and as he did, he automatically closed the side door.Zheng Baozhu buckled her seatbelt, but she struggled to fasten it for a while and couldn't manage it. Qu Zhi frowned slightly, \"Let go, I'll do it.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu obediently released her grip. Qu Zhi leaned over and helped her buckle the seatbelt. Just as he was about to sit upright, he looked up and saw the flower on his head in the rearview mirror.\"... \" He remained silent for a while before looking at the mischievous person sitting beside him, \"Zheng Baozhu, did you do this?\"\"What's wrong?\" Zheng Baozhu innocently looked at him as if she just noticed the flower on his head, \"Oh, why do you have a flower on your head? It looks surprisingly good.\"\"Hmm,\" Qu Zhi gave a faint smile, looking at the flowers in Zheng Baozhu's hand, \"What happened to the bouquet you had earlier? How come it's just a twig now?\"Zheng Baozhu lowered her head to look at the twig in her hand, showing the same surprise, \"Yeah, where did my flowers go?\"\"...Childish,\" Qu Zhi said as he took the flower from his head and casually pinned it onto Zheng Baozhu's head, \"You look even better with it.\"\"Who says that? I think you look good with it,\" Zheng Baozhu replied confidently, \"Look at those men from ancient times; they all liked to wear flowers on their heads, right?\"\"They are who they are, and I am me,\" Qu Zhi fastened his own seatbelt, started the car, and said, \"Sit properly.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu sat properly in her seat, took out her phone, tilted her head, and took a few selfies, \"I look really pretty.\"Qu Zhi smiled and responded with a simple \"Hmm\".Zheng Baozhu then took a picture of Qu Zhi driving, put her phone away, leaned back on the seat, and closed her eyes, \"I'm a bit tired, I'll take a nap.\"\"Sure, wake up when we arrive.\"Qu Zhi set the navigation and the car moved steadily through the city's night scenery. As Qu Zhi drove smoothly, Zheng Baozhu unknowingly fell asleep. When she woke up again, the car was already parked in the garage.\"Are we here?\" Zheng Baozhu opened her eyes, sitting up.\"Yes,\" Qu Zhi unbuckled his seatbelt and replied, \"Sober now?\"Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow defiantly, \"I only had a little; I wasn't drunk to begin with!\"\"Oh, then pretending to be drunk and making me carry you on my back was intentional?\"\"What pretending? Clearly, you were the one who carried me!\"\"Is that so?\" Qu Zhi leaned closer; his dark eyes looked into hers. \"So, do I need to carry you to your hotel?\"Worried that he might really do it, Zheng Baozhu instinctively put her hand on his chest, \"I've told you; there are surveillance cameras here.\"Qu Zhi chuckled and distanced himself, \"Why are you so defensive? Are you thinking of something unhealthy?\"\"...\" You really know how to turn the tables!Zheng Baozhu opened the car door and got out along with Qu Zhi. Qu Zhi saw her walking steadily and reminded her, \"Go back and rest early.\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"I'll rest after Sister Xiaonan returns me some luck! Didn't you see how she kept watching me during dinner today?\"Hearing Zheng Baozhu's words, Qu Zhi burst into laughter. Indeed, during dinner, Zhou Xiaonan had been watching Zheng Baozhu closely, afraid that she would eat more than she should.\"I'll have to start filming soon, so I definitely can't gain weight,\" Zheng Baozhu patted her own stomach while realizing that as long as she had thick skin, even if her manager kept watching her, it wouldn't affect her eating, \"I'll go back and exercise for twenty minutes.\"Qu Zhi lightly laughed, \"It seems like I made the right choice with my gym. Your usage rate might end up higher than mine in the future.\"Qu Zhi's penthouse was almost finished with renovations, they should be able to move in officially by the next Chinese New Year.\"When you have time, we can go together to pick out the decorations,\" Qu Zhi suggested to Zheng Baozhu, \"Some furniture needs to be customized, so we need to select them in advance.\"\"Sure!\" Zheng Baozhu was very interested in decorating the house, especially since it was going to be her wedding house with Qu Zhi, \"Homeland City is a great place to shop; I could spend a whole day there.\"Qu Zhi raised an eyebrow teasingly, \"You are already a popular star with millions of fans. Won't people recognize you in Homeland City?\"\"I can do disguises!\" Zheng Baozhu replied confidently and then looked Qu Zhi up and down, \"But you also need to disguise yourself; many fans recognize you.\"As Zheng Baozhu spoke, she recalled the time when Qu Zhi's half-face went viral and topped the trending list as [How High Can an Average Person's Value Be?]They soon arrived at the door of Zheng Baozhu's room as they chatted. Since the last time Qu Zhi slept in her room, he hadn't been there again. Zheng Baozhu stopped at the door and looked at him, \"I'm here.\"Qu Zhi also stopped, glancing at Zheng Baozhu for a moment, and nodded lightly, \"Hmm, then I'll head back now?\"Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment and also nodded, \"Alright, goodnight.\"\"Goodnight,\" Qu Zhi bid her goodnight and walked towards his room. Once Zheng Baozhu was back in her room, she closed the door and stomped her foot in frustration!Ah, should she have invited Qu Zhi inside for a bit? They were both adults and had mutual feelings for each other. Why were they being so polite?Maybe Qu Zhi had some concerns and might even hold back until their wedding day....No, she needed to come up with a way to devour this man.Judging from Qu Zhi's behavior, if she took the initiative, he probably wouldn't be able to resist!Just as Zheng Baozhu was thinking this, Zhou Xiaonan sent her a message: Are you back? Remember to exercise before sleeping.\"...\"Zheng Baozhu replied cheekily: Does that kind of exercise count?Zhou Xiaonan: ???Zhou Xiaonan: Did I disturb something?Zheng Baozhu: Not really.Zhou Xiaonan: ? Is it that you're not interested, or is it Qu Zhi?Zheng Baozhu: \u00a0It's not that. If you don't have anything else, I'm going for a non-aerobic workout.Zhou Xiaonan: Weren't you featured in a magazine a while ago? The pre-sale for the issue will start the day after tomorrow, and they'll give you a solo link.Zheng Baozhu: ...The timing is perfect.Zhou Xiaonan: Tell me about it. Your popularity has soared in the past two days, and they want to sell more copies. Don't forget to repost on Weibo tomorrow.Zheng Baozhu: Okay.The magazine feature Zheng Baozhu shot was just a page with a short interview, but the main sales didn't rely solely on that. However, the photoshoot turned out beautifully, which made it quite appealing. Originally, the magazine had no plans to include Zheng Baozhu's poster, but her popularity skyrocketed too fast. To attract more buyers, the magazine decided to add her poster as a last-minute bonus.The pre-sale started at noon, and soon, the inventory set was sold out in less than half a minute. Those who missed out rushed to the magazine's blog to question whether there was a limited quantity and why they didn't announce it earlier.The magazine was also feeling unjustified. Their inventory was set based on the typical sales level of magazines featuring stars over the past few years, and they didn't expect it to sell out so quickly. After receiving the feedback, the magazine hurriedly adjusted the inventory, this time setting it at 990,000 copies. This should be enough to avoid running out.Seeing that the magazine was available for purchase again, those who were complaining shifted their focus. To make up for their earlier mistake, the magazine even specially made a sales poster for Zheng Baozhu and promoted it on Weibo.With the success of Zheng Baozhu's magazine sales, the haters couldn't sit still. They alternated between mocking her for relying on speculative investments and mocking her for being naive enough to be used as a tool for speculation.However, Zheng Baozhu didn't pay too much attention to this matter. She had always been clear about her goals and wanted to be an actress. The magazine's success was just a bonus and she didn't rely on it to make a living. She thanked everyone for their support on Weibo and then shifted her focus back to the script.Recently, she had been studying the script on her own, and whenever she had questions, she would consult with Teacher Ge during classes. She even added the screenwriter on WeChat and bothered him from time to time.Although the screenwriter had complained about Zheng Baozhu to Gao Boyun before, he admired her dedication as an actress.Soon, the second script reading session was scheduled, and many actors attended, including representatives from the production company. Lin Ziqin, the male lead, also dutifully attended the script reading. Seeing everyone's seriousness, Zheng Baozhu felt more assured because making a TV drama wasn't a solo effort; it required everyone's collective effort to do well.During the script reading, everyone had different interpretations of the script, but the overall atmosphere was good. Afterward, Gao Boyun invited several key actors and creators to have dinner. The representatives from the production company who attended the reading were also present at the dinner that was held at Tianxia Restaurant.\"Baobao, I noticed that Yu Wei has been watching you,\" Gao Boyun quietly told Zheng Baozhu at the dinner table, \"Be careful, I'm afraid he's taken an interest in you.\"Zheng Baozhu also noticed that Yu Wei had been glancing at her. He even deliberately toasted her earlier. She responded quietly to Gao Boyun, \"Who is this person?\"\"He's from the Yu family,\" Gao Boyun whispered, using his hand to block the conversation, \"But you don't need to worry. The Yu family's influence in the company is not absolute anymore. Their CEO, Song Nanchuan, is very capable.\"\"Oh... I think I've heard of him. Isn't he a celebrity's husband?\"\"Yes.\"Gao Boyun nodded, and Yu Wei, who was nearby, interrupted them, \"Director Gao, what secret conversation are you having with our lead actress? Is there something we can't hear?\"\"Of course not,\" Gao Boyun smiled, \"I was just feeling a bit unwell and asked Baozhu if she could have a few drinks for me.\"\"But that's not acceptable. As a man, how can you let someone else drink on your behalf?\" Yu Wei raised his wine glass again, \"Let's all have another toast together.\"Everyone at the table raised their glasses for another toast. Meanwhile, Gao Boyun discreetly sent a message to Zheng Baozhu: Yu Wei doesn't have a good reputation in the industry. He often mingles with internet celebrities. Be cautious around him.After Zheng Baozhu replied with a \"Got it\", she received a message from Qu Zhi: Are you still at dinner?Zheng Baozhu: Yes.Qu Zhi: Are you drinking?Zheng Baozhu: Yes.Qu Zhi: I'll come pick you up. Wait for me.Zheng Baozhu smiled and put her phone aside. Since Lin Ziqin had another engagement the next day, he suggested leaving early. Zheng Baozhu followed his lead and stood up, saying she also needed to leave.Yu Wei tried to persuade them to stay for a while, but seeing their firm attitude, he also decided to leave.Ignoring him, Zheng Baozhu walked out of the private room, called her assistant to bring the car out, and prepared to wait for Qu Zhi in the car. However, Yu Wei caught up with her and said, \"Miss Zheng, where are you going? How about I give you a ride?\"\"No need, I have my assistant.\" Zheng Baozhu smiled at him and continued walking forward.Yu Wei still followed her, \"Don't be so distant. How about we have a few more drinks? I have some friends coming out, and we can go to KTV.\"\"Really, Mr. Yu, I have work tomorrow,\" Zheng Baozhu replied as they walked outside Tianxia Restaurant, but couldn't shake off Yu Wei. Her assistant had already brought the car out, and seeing Zheng Baozhu being pestered by a man, the assistant opened the car door and walked over, \"Miss Baozhu, you can get in the car first.\"\"Okay.\"Zheng Baozhu nodded and was about to get into the car when her arm was pulled by Yu Wei, \"Miss Zheng, don't be so disrespectful. You're not famous yet, and you're already ignoring the investors?\"Frowning, Zheng Baozhu pulled her hand back, looked at him, and said, \"Mr. Yu, the investors put money into the drama, not me. If you have any requests, you can talk to Director Gao.\"Yu Wei sneered, thinking that she didn't know what was good for her, \"Are you suggesting that I invest in you? Well, I can do that, can't I?\"Zheng Baozhu also sneered, about to tell him to use that money to fix his own brain when Qu Zhi's voice came from the side, \"Baozhu.\"Before Yu Wei could react, Qu Zhi had already approached them. Zheng Baozhu was surprised at how quickly he arrived. Qu Zhi pulled her towards him and looked at Yu Wei, \"Who is this?\"Zheng Baozhu said, \"Oh, he's Yu Wei from Huanyu Pictures, one of the investors in our drama.\"\"Mr. Yu, right?\" Qu Zhi's tone was cold, \"I am Baozhu's boyfriend. Thanks for sending her out.\"After saying that, without waiting for Yu Wei's response, he directly pulled Zheng Baozhu away. The assistant followed them and quickly got into the car, not daring to delay for even a second before driving away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu sat in the back, both of their expressions not looking good.\"What did that person want just now?\" Qu Zhi looked at Zheng Baozhu and spoke first.Zheng Baozhu said, \"He wanted me to go to KTV to sing, but I told him I didn't want to go, and he kept pulling me. Thankfully, you came, or else I might have ended up fighting with him.\"\"...\"Qu Zhi fell silent for a moment and then said slowly, \"What about the others? Why was it just the two of you there?\"\"They haven't finished eating yet. Lin Ziqin said he wanted to catch his flight, so I said I'd leave with him. I didn't expect that this Yu Wei guy would follow me out,\" Zheng Baozhu explained.The assistant hadn't joined them for the meal and didn't know what happened before, but hearing Zheng Baozhu's account, the assistant frowned and said, \"Miss Baozhu, Yu Wei has a bad reputation. He's always ambiguous with internet celebrities and involved in countless rumors with young stars. He has also insulted reporters on Weibo. He's not a good person to deal with. Will he seek revenge for what happened today?\"It seems that Yu Wei has taken a liking to Miss Baozhu and thought he could handle the situation the same way he had dealt with others before. But now that Miss Baozhu didn't give him any face, he must be very angry.As soon as the assistant finished speaking, Zheng Baozhu's phone rang. It was Zhou Xiaonan calling.\"Hello, Sister Xiaonan, what's up?\" Zheng Baozhu answered the call. Zhou Xiaonan asked from the other end, \"Was Yu Wei present at the dinner tonight?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu replied and subconsciously sat up straight, \"No way, did he go to complain to you?\"Zhou Xiaonan said, \"What happened between you two? He just angrily scolded you on Weibo; our colleagues from the PR department saw it and told me immediately.\"\"What?\" Zheng Baozhu couldn't help but laugh out of anger, \"He has the audacity to scold me? Does he think I'm an easy target?\"\"Don't worry. He didn't mention names directly, but anyone with a discerning eye can tell he's referring to you,\" Zhou Xiaonan said, concerned that Zheng Baozhu might get upset, and added, \"Tell me what happened between you two tonight, and we'll figure out a plan here.\"\"He just wanted me to go to KTV with him after dinner to drink, but I refused. Now we're on the way back to the hotel,\" Zheng Baozhu explained.Zhou Xiaonan knew what kind of person Yu Wei was, and after hearing Zheng Baozhu's account, she understood the situation, \"Okay, I got it. Don't worry about him for now. We'll come up with a response after discussing it here.\"\"Okay,\" Zheng Baozhu responded and hung up the phone. She then opened Weibo and asked, \"Xiao Yuan, do you know Yu Wei's Weibo account?\"\"Just use his name and add a 'V' to it.\"Zheng Baozhu nodded and typed Yu Wei's name in the search bar. Indeed, his Weibo account popped up.He had just posted a Weibo five minutes ago and there were already hundreds of comments.Yu Wei V: A certain star is too full of herself. She hasn't even become famous yet and already giving the investors a hard time?? Haha, you were just an extra in the entertainment industry. If it weren't for your unclear relationship with the director, could you have become the lead? Acting all high and mighty in front of me?After reading it, Zheng Baozhu's brows furrowed. Although the statement didn't directly name her, it was close to exposing her identity. [The Pursuit of the Heart] was invested by Huanyu, and Yu Wei flaunted the surname \"Yu\" everywhere. Who wouldn't know he was associated with Huanyu?Yu Wei usually generated gossip news related to the entertainment industry; his Weibo following was considerable. As soon as he posted, many of Zheng Baozhu's critics detected the situation.\u300cZheng Baozhu? \u300d\u300cI know who it is now. \u00a0I said she rose to fame for no reason, and sure enough, she's a dud. \u300d\u300cHahaha, I'm not surprised at all. Those who suddenly become popular for no reason always have issues. \u300d\u300cShowing off in front of the investors, well done. \u00a0The key is, you're not even famous. \u300d\u300cKnowledge bomb! ZBZ is currently headlining two TV dramas directed by the same person. \u300d\u300cDidn't she announce having a boyfriend before? Ah, this...is awkward, hahaha.\u300dLooking at the netizens' comments, Yu Wei's anger subsided a little. Heh, a small star still wanted to compete with him; she really didn't know what was good for her.He instructed the driver to take him to a KTV nearby. He got off the car and walked directly to a private room. After feeling upset because of Zheng Baozhu, he asked his buddies' locations and rushed over to join them for singing and drinking. As he pushed open the private room door, he found everyone huddled together, looking at their phones.\"What's so interesting? Are you all hiding something from me?\" Yu Wei curiously walked over. When they looked up and saw him, their expressions turned somewhat strange, \"Ah Wei, was the Weibo post you made just now about Zheng Baozhu?\"\"Yes, I asked her to come and sing and drink, but she disrespected me. Heh, no one has dared to show me such disrespect before,\" Yu Wei knew that not everyone around him liked him, but they were wary of offending him due to his family background. He didn't care, anyway, he wasn't genuinely fond of them. They were together to have fun and benefit from each other. What's wrong with that?Zheng Baozhu was just too arrogant.One of the guys handed his phone to Yu Wei with a meaningful look, \"You better see it yourself.\"\"What's this all about?\" Yu Wei took the phone and immediately saw Zheng Baozhu had just reposted his Weibo post.Zheng Baozhu V: You can go to hell, you despicable dog thief! So I'm disrespectful because I don't want to go to KTV with you? Do you think your face is so important? Even my dad wouldn't dare ask me to accompany someone for drinks. Who do you think you are? And about my relationship with the director, do you have any evidence? Show it in court if you dare, don't just whine on Weibo. Have some guts, shall we meet in court???Yu Wei's face turned pale in anger; the others in the private room instinctively stepped back.Zheng Baozhu felt satisfied after sending that message. Meanwhile, Zhou Xiaonan was still discussing countermeasures with her PR colleagues. When she saw the Weibo Zheng Baozhu posted, her face turned green.\"Zheng Baozhu, what are you doing! Didn't I tell you not to respond yet?\" Zhou Xiaonan immediately called her, \"By doing this, aren't you admitting that the post is about you?\"Zheng Baozhu held her phone and said, \"Does it make any difference whether I admit it or not? The comments clearly mention my name, and he implied that I have an unclear relationship with Gao Boyun, suggesting that I'm making Qu Zhi wear a green hat! I can tolerate a lot, but I can't tolerate this about Qu Zhi!\"Zhou Xiaonan: \"...\"Taking a deep breath, she asked Zheng Baozhu, \"Is Qu Zhi with you?\"\"Yes.\"\"Then didn't he see you posting on Weibo? Couldn't he have stopped you?\"\"Why should he stop me? He supported me in posting!\" Zheng Baozhu confirmed with Qu Zhi beside her, \"Isn't that right?\"Qu Zhi: \"...\"Perhaps she should have asked him before she posted it.But he did indeed indulge her behavior and there was nothing more to argue about: \"Yes, I agree with any decision Baozhu makes.\"\"...\"Zhou Xiaonan felt like she was going crazy and shouted on the phone, \"Then do you also agree to break up with her?\"\"I can agree to anything except that,\" Qu Zhi replied without changing his expression.\"... Fine, I don't want to argue with both of you anymore... Help! Yu Wei posted another Weibo!\" Zhou Xiaonan felt like she needed to keep antacids on standby to handle her job as Zheng Baozhu's agent.After ending the call, Zheng Baozhu noticed that Yu Wei had reposted her previous Weibo.Yu Wei V: Huh, I gave you face, yet you jumped out yourself. Do you really think nobody knows about your little scheme? Fine, let's meet in court as you wish. Also, I officially announce that I'm withdrawing my investment from [The Pursuit of the Heart]!Ha!!!! You thought you could threaten me with money?? Zheng Baozhu angrily reposted his Weibo post.Zheng Baozhu V: If you want to withdraw your investment, go ahead, I'll invest by myself!! I'll immediately contact my lawyer. Anyone who dares not to show up in court is a coward!Tonight's performance was truly amazing, and the pace was so fast that before the spectators could even react, the plot had already taken a new turn. Netizens were jumping between both their Weibo accounts, just like monkeys hopping around in a melon field.Now, Zheng Baozhu had posted a Weibo, so netizens flocked to her side.\u300cZheng Baozhu is the most straightforward celebrity I've ever seen, hahaha!\u300d\u300cEveryone knows about Yu Wei's reputation. \u00a0I'm on Baozhu's side for this one.\u300d\u300cI'm laughing so hard, I thought it was just a childish fight, but then I realized they're quarreling with millions of yuan at stake. Now I'm shedding sour tears.\u00a0\u300d\u300cAh, ah, ah, Baozhu, well done! I've wanted to curse that despicable dog thief Yu Wei for so long!!!\u300d\u300cThe meme is here [dogthief.jpg].\u300dIn just a few minutes, Yu Wei's \"dog thief\" meme spread all over the internet.Zhou Xiaonan watched the entire spectacle with a smile and thought: I'm exhausted. Let it be. Whatever. :)Meanwhile, Gao Boyun was still having dinner with the producers and creative team. No one in the private room had any idea of the chaos happening outside. By the end of the meal, Gao Boyun was already slightly drunk. He took out his phone to check the time, only to find dozens of missed calls. He was taken aback.Muttering curses, he couldn't believe it, \"What's going on? Did aliens invade Earth??\"While he was still wondering, his father, Gao Tianming, called him again. This time, Gao Boyun finally answered the call, \"Dad...\"\"What dad! You're my dad!\"\"...\"Gao Boyun hesitated for a moment before speaking, \"What happened?\"\"Yu Wei and Zheng Baozhu are tearing each other apart on Weibo. If you don't answer the phone earlier, you might as well go listen to their court case as an audience!\"\"Ah??\" When he heard it might go to court, Gao Boyun panicked, \"Did Yu Wei do something to Baozhu? I knew that scoundrel had bad intentions!\"\"Heh!\" Gao Tianming chuckled, \"Go check Weibo yourself. After all, you've also landed a hot search.\"\"...\"How was this related to him? Gao Boyun rubbed his forehead, ended the call with his dad, and hurriedly checked Weibo. After reading through the night's drama, Gao Boyun sobered up from the alcohol. He clenched his phone for three seconds but couldn't hold back from cursing, \"Yu Wei, you despicable dog thief!\"At this time, Zheng Baozhu had already returned to her hotel. On her way back, she immediately contacted her lawyer, saying she wanted to sue Yu Wei for spreading rumors and defamation. Then, she remembered there might be surveillance cameras at the venue, which could prove that Yu Wei was the one pestering her. The lawyer told her that only the police could access the surveillance footage, so she decided to report the incident to the police.The assistant who drove her back was left completely speechless.Previously, the assistant already knew that Zheng Baozhu was strong-willed after witnessing two incidents where she clarified plastic surgery rumors and defended Sun Jing against reporters. But today, the assistant was truly speechless. In the country's film and television industry, Huanyu Entertainment was an absolute leader, so despite knowing what kind of person Yu Wei was, she still angered him to the point of spurting blood.Although Huanyu Entertainment's position was changing through these years, the Yu family's foundation remained strong. As the saying goes, a dead camel is still bigger than a horse, right?So, the assistant really didn't expect Zheng Baozhu to be this domineering!!While driving back, the assistant was still in a state of awe.After taking a shower, Zheng Baozhu calmed down a lot. The alcohol from the night and the encounter with Yu Wei had caused her to be somewhat impulsive. Upon careful reflection, her approach might not have been appropriate, but... it still felt satisfying!As she blew dry her hair, she saw Qu Zhi standing in her bedroom wearing pajamas. While she was taking a shower, Qu Zhi had also gone back to his room to freshen up. He came back because he was worried about Zheng Baozhu.He visited Zheng Baozhu's bedroom twice, including this time. The last time he hadn't noticed, but this time, he saw a piece of writing from the third grade on her wall.Zheng Baozhu saw him standing by the wall, looking up at the essay framed there, and suddenly felt embarrassed, \"What are you looking at?\"Hearing her voice, Qu Zhi turned back and glanced at her with a gentle smile, \"I'm admiring your masterpiece.\"\"Stop looking, stop looking. Your \"A\" essay looks way better!\" Zheng Baozhu walked up to him, intending to cover his eyes. Qu Zhi evaded her hand, teasingly saying, \"Wow, it's Zheng Baozhu! So pretty!\"\"............\" Zheng Baozhu was so embarrassed; Qu Zhi actually recited the content of her essay! \"Ah, don't you dare say it!\"Now she not only had to cover Qu Zhi's eyes but also had to cover her ears. Qu Zhi held her hands and pulled her into his arms, asking, \"What's the matter? Still feeling shy?\"Zheng Baozhu turned her head away, avoiding his gaze, \"I'm not!\"\"Oh, then why are your ears turning red?\" Qu Zhi said softly, planting a kiss on Zheng Baozhu's ear, then chuckled lightly, \"They've become even redder now.\"\"You're doing it on purpose!\" Zheng Baozhu glared at him with displeasure. Qu Zhi smiled and hugged her tighter, looking into her eyes warmly, \"Teacher Zhang encouraged you not to give up when facing setbacks. Indeed, from tonight's incident, our Zheng Baozhu will only bring setbacks to others.\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu gave a slight shrug, not replying.Qu Zhi kissed her again and whispered softly, \"But you're really courageous. Aren't you afraid of offending the Yu family?\"\"What am I afraid of?\" Zheng Baozhu looked up at him, \"Now we live in a society under the rule of law. Does he still want to control everything? You're right, he's only become so arrogant because he hasn't faced a setback like me. He's just been allowed to inflate himself like this day by day!\"\"Alright, don't be angry anymore. He must be more furious than you right now,\" Qu Zhi comforted Zheng Baozhu as he continued to kiss her gently.Zheng Baozhu's anger dissipated instantly and she just gazed at him. Qu Zhi smiled and touched the tip of his nose against hers, asking, \"What are you looking at?\"Zheng Baozhu leaned in and pecked him on the lips, saying, \"I'm looking at your handsome face.\"Then she pulled him to sit on the bed and declared dominantly, \"Tonight, you're going to sleep here with me.\"Qu Zhi chuckled and raised an eyebrow, \"I can see that you're still under the influence of alcohol.\"Zheng Baozhu puffed her cheeks but didn't say anything. It was rare for her to have such a cute expression, which made Qu Zhi couldn't help but touch her cheek, \"I understand. I'll stay here with you. Rest early; we don't know how things will develop tomorrow.\"\"Mhm...\" Zheng Baozhu nodded and, when Qu Zhi was about to leave, she pulled him back, \"Where are you going?\"Qu Zhi replied, \"I'll sleep on the other side.\"Zheng Baozhu pursed her lips and watched him for a while, then suddenly, she sat on his lap, cupped his face, and kissed him deeply. Qu Zhi was briefly stunned, but then he quickly took the lead and deepened the kiss, holding the back of her head to keep her close.Zheng Baozhu's hands were restless; Qu Zhi grabbed her hands, bringing them close and continuing the passionate exchange of tongues.Zheng Baozhu knew that as long as she took the lead a bit, Qu Zhi couldn't resist. She could clearly sense that Qu Zhi was more passionate than ever before and the places he touched seemed to carry a fiery intensity.Closing her eyes, she savored every moment with Qu Zhi, allowing herself to be immersed in this whirlpool of emotions with him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If it weren't for Zhou Xiaonan calling early in the morning, she could have slept until noon.Hearing the ringing of the phone, Zheng Baozhu, still half-asleep, reached out for her own phone but instead touched something warm and sturdy. Confused, she furrowed her brows and opened her eyes to take a look.Her hand was resting on Qu Zhi's chest, going up and down.Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"A soft chuckle came from above, and when Zheng Baozhu raised her head, she met Qu Zhi's smiling eyes.\"Is your waist okay?\" he asked.A blush spread across Zheng Baozhu's face, but she stubbornly pulled her hand away from Qu Zhi's chest and replied, \"It's fine.\"The phone ringing stopped and then started again. Zheng Baozhu sat up with the blanket wrapped around her, finally reaching for the phone and answering the call, \"Hello, Sister Xiaonan, what's up?\"\"Awake now?\" Zhou Xiaonan snorted coldly on the other end of the line, \"While you were sleeping, Yu Wei was busy doing something.\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu remained silent for a moment, then put the phone on speaker and opened her Weibo app, \"What did he do again?\"\"He somehow got hold of the photos of you taken during the filming of 'New Moon Wuxin Sword'. There are pictures of you getting out of Gao Boyun's car and going in and out of the hotel together. Now Yu Wei is using these photos to make a big fuss,\" Zhou Xiaonan explained.\"....I see.\" Zheng Baozhu had already clicked on Yu Wei's Weibo and saw the repost he made at five in the morning.The original post was from an entertainment marketing account that often speculated on gossip in the industry. This time, in the middle of the night, the account posted an article with photos of Zheng Baozhu and Gao Boyun, trying to confirm their \"inappropriate\" relationship.Zheng Baozhu could tell that it was orchestrated by Yu Wei. The moment the article was posted, he quickly reposted it.Yu Wei V: @Zheng Baozhu, didn't you say there was nothing going on between you and the director?\"Heh.\" Zheng Baozhu curled her lips and quickly took a screenshot of his Weibo post. After last night's confrontation, she discovered a blind spot \u2013 her popularity was higher than Yu Wei's! Why should she give him more attention by reposting his Weibo? Not a single repost for him!Uploading the screenshot to her own Weibo, Zheng Baozhu edited a post swiftly.Zheng Baozhu V: Hey, Dog Yu, getting up at five in the morning to post on Weibo, were you so angry last night that you couldn't sleep the whole night? Unlike you, I have the life of a normal person, and I slept really well last night. Also, what can these few crappy photos prove? Firstly, there were more than just the two of us in the car. Secondly, just because someone gets out of a man's car, does it automatically mean there's something inappropriate between them? If that's the case, then no one can ever take another person's car. Wake up, we are not living in the Qing Dynasty anymore.Before filming [New Moon Wuxin Sword], I was just an ordinary supporting actor in the Film and Television City. I had no assistant, no company, and every day, I carried my own actor's chair to the set. Director Gao saw me carrying so much stuff by myself, so he proposed to give me a ride back to the hotel after work. Yes, it's the same hotel you captured in the photos. Many actors from our crew stayed there too. This photo you have doesn't even show any intimate actions, yet you dare to use it to create a story. Have the standards of paparazzi fallen so low? If I were the boss, I would definitely fire you.Also, about last night, I wanted to say this \u2013 it's true that I used to be an extra. So what? I never felt ashamed, but who are you to look down on extras? Every film and television drama is the result of the efforts of the entire crew, not just a few main actors. If you look down on extras so much, then in your future film investments, don't use extras, alright???Speaking of investments, the viewers waiting for [The Pursuit of the Heart] need not worry. I said I would invest, and I will. I won't let this drama stall.This will be my last public response to @YuWei. Last night, I already contacted a lawyer and reported to the police. From now on, we will handle everything through legal procedures. I have already saved all the evidence. Again, whoever dares not to show up in court is the dog (no offense to dogs).After Zheng Baozhu posted on Weibo, she held her phone and kept refreshing the page. Qu Zhi sat beside her, still not properly dressed. He had on a coat over his sleepwear, the buttons were undone, and there were still some red marks on his chest and neck from where Zheng Baozhu scratched him last night.\"Your essay writing skills have improved a lot since primary school. Teacher Zhang should be very proud when he sees this,\" Qu Zhi half-jokingly commented while looking at the phone, \"You might be able to get some votes from the extras.\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him and said, \"I didn't mean it that way. I was speaking from the heart! I've been scolded enough already. Now, even sitting in another person's car can be used to insult me, as if it's some kind of winning strategy. It's really ridiculous. And as for extras, it's true that it's tiring work with poor treatment, but someone like Yu Wei, a big shot, wouldn't understand.\"\"I didn't mean it that way either; I was just stating my assumption,\" Qu Zhi raised his hand and smoothed his hair, \"I need to get ready to go to work. Do you want to sleep a bit longer?\"Zheng Baozhu shook her head, \"I can't sleep anymore. Who knows what Yu Wei might try to do while I'm asleep?\"Qu Zhi thought for a moment and said, \"Then, how about I take a day off and stay here to keep you company?\"\"No need,\" Zheng Baozhu leaned over and kissed Qu Zhi on the lips, \"I can handle it myself. Also, I'm not alone; I have a team behind me.\"Hearing this, Qu Zhi couldn't help but chuckle, \"Your team might have been exasperated by you.\"\"Erm...\" Judging from the tone of the phone call from Zhou Xiaonan, it seemed that they were indeed quite angry, \"But they have no choice. After all, I'm their boss!\"Qu Zhi smiled again, \"Alright then, I'll go to work?\"\"Sure!\"Qu Zhi looked at her and said, \"Kiss me again.\"\"...Seriously, you're too clingy,\" Zheng Baozhu teased, but she leaned over and kissed Qu Zhi again. Qu Zhi finally seemed satisfied and got up to get dressed and ready.Zheng Baozhu remained seated and continued browsing through Weibo. Unexpectedly, so many netizens were already discussing the drama this early in the morning. The entertainment industry's insiders had all written articles about the incident, and there were supporters for both Zheng Baozhu and Yu Wei, but visibly, there were more people standing by Zheng Baozhu's side. In the morning, after the confrontation, Gao Boyun finally remembered to post on Weibo to clarify his relationship with Zheng Baozhu, saying that he was just a single young man whose reputation had been wrongly tarnished, and he reserved the right to pursue legal action.Zheng Baozhu could understand Gao Boyun posting on Weibo, but what surprised her was that Sun Jing suddenly also posted on Weibo, criticizing Yu Wei and even releasing screenshots of a short conversation between them, in which Yu Wei's words were quite despicable.Sun Jing's number of followers on Weibo was even more than the combined total of Zheng Baozhu and Yu Wei's followers. As soon as that post went up, the internet exploded, accusing Yu Wei of sexual harassment.Zheng Baozhu didn't know why Sun Jing suddenly decided to target Yu Wei, but at this time, her action undoubtedly helped as it supported the notion that Yu Wei had sexually harassed more than one person.After thinking for a while, Zheng Baozhu sent a WeChat message to Sun Jing: Thanks, sister.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't expect everyone to wake up this early.Sun Jing replied almost instantly: What are you talking about? I didn't post that Weibo to help you. I've just had enough of Yu Wei's arrogance. Since you've come out as a thorn in his side, I pushed the wave along.Zheng Baozhu: Oh.Sun Jing: And who said we are sisters?Zheng Baozhu: So you're the tsundere type, huh? Got it, sister.Sun Jing: ...Although Sun Jing didn't admit it directly, her Weibo post indeed swayed public opinion against Yu Wei. After her post, several internet influencers also came forward to claim that they had been sexually harassed by Yu Wei. Some were genuinely harassed, while others were just riding the wave for popularity. Nevertheless, Yu Wei had indeed become the drowning dog, and everyone was against him.Yu Wei was so angry that he was about to throw his phone. But before he could do it, his father called him. Yu Wei held his breath and reluctantly picked up the phone, \"Dad...\"\"Don't 'Dad' me! You're driving me crazy!\" Yu Wei's father shouted angrily on the other end of the line, \"What was that mess you created last night? Haven't you disgraced the Yu family enough?\"\"It wasn't me, it was Zheng Baozhu...\"\"Don't mention her to me! Do you think I don't know what you're up to?\" Yu Wei's father interrupted him before he could finish, \"You're caused trouble outside, now you're talking about withdrawing the investment? Do you think you're the only one who can make that decision? I had to get up early this morning to convene a board meeting to discuss this mess you've created!\"Yu Wei, feeling indignant, argued, \"Dad, Huanyu is originally owned by our Yu family. Why should we listen to those outsiders?\"\"Outsiders with company shares and status! You really have a knack for failing in whatever you do!\"The phone was abruptly hung up, and Yu Wei felt the urge to throw his phone again. He picked it up and tossed it aside, causing the phone to scatter into pieces.The conflict between Zheng Baozhu and Yu Wei continued to ferment online with people on both sides closely monitoring the situation. Yu Wei had thought that things were already bad enough, but little did he know that this was just an appetizer.Around noon, a prominent online figure posted a lengthy Weibo post. He was known for sharing information related to the internet and computers, but this was the first time he dabbled in entertainment industry news.Have you all heard about the Zheng Baozhu incident? I have to say it's quite shocking, and I'm sure her haters are dumbfounded. However, being curious, I did some research, and what I found might surprise the haters even more.According to my investigation, Zheng Baozhu opened a teahouse near her university during her first year, and it was a huge success. Later, she opened a Chinese restaurant and a hotel, and they've been running well. She probably recouped her investments in no time and is now making money effortlessly. She has also invested in several companies, and they seem to be doing quite well in recent years, probably bringing her substantial returns.One could say she's a born winner.While I was looking into this, I came across an interview featuring an ABA interviewee, and it mentioned her entrepreneurial experience. If you're interested, you can watch it. I've attached the link at the end (because the title and introduction didn't mention Zheng Baozhu, no one has discovered this video yet ). The interview also mentioned Zheng Baozhu's father, and I looked him up as well... turns out, he's from a wealthy family.In conclusion, there's no problem with President Zheng investing in [The Pursuit of the Heart]. You can rest assured.The only thing that puzzles me is, with all the money President Zheng has, why did she go to the Film and Television City to play an extra role? Is she trying to experience a different life?PS: The tea industry isn't as easy to make it big these years, the teahouse at the school's entrance has undergone renovations, changes in branding and business models. Some classmates might think it's under new management, but in reality, the boss behind it has always been Zheng Baozhu.The Weibo post also included many images, which were data he found from a business information platform that showed the companies related to Zheng Baozhu.When the netizens started eating popcorn, they never expected the situation to take this turn. :)\u300cI can't believe it, I'm stunned!\u300d\u300cNow I get it, it's not Zheng Baozhu who's with the director, it's the director who's with the rich lady. \u300d\u300cYu Wei, you've got yourself into something. \u300d\u300cThis shocked my whole family. \u00a0While Zheng Baozhu was already making money during her first year, I'm still adjusting to university life. \u300d\u300cI looked it up, Zheng Baozhu was only 16 when she entered university... and it was a prestigious one...\u300d\u300cAhhh, this person is something else!! Talented and rich!\u300d\u300cI just want to learn about investment from Miss Baozhu. \u300d\u300cI mentioned on the internet a long time ago that Zheng Baozhu is the owner of the hotel where I stayed! But no one paid attention to me!!\u300dNow people are paying attention to him, and not just a few. They not only know about Zheng Baozhu's hotel but have even released the address and phone number, and the hotel is getting swamped with calls.Wei Zhen hurriedly contacted Zheng Baozhu and the first thing he said was, \"Miss Baozhu, it's a mess out there. You need to evacuate from the hotel!\"Zheng Baozhu: \"...\"Is Manager Wei under the influence of a spy movie?After calming down, she asked, \"What happened?\"\"Our hotel has been exposed. The front desk phone is ringing non-stop and all the rooms are fully booked. Many people will probably come here to see you. You must evacuate immediately!\"\"...I know. I'll leave the hotel right away. You also need to make emergency preparations. Get the security staff who are on leave to come back and work overtime. Also, inform the management at the Starlight Farm in advance.\"\"Alright, I'll handle it.\"\"That's it then.\" As soon as Zheng Baozhu hung up the phone, Qu Zhi called. As she answered the phone, Qu Zhi's slightly anxious voice came through the receiver, \"Are you still at the hotel?\"\"You also know about what's happening online? I'm just getting ready to pack up and leave the hotel.\"\"Then wait for me. I already asked for leave from Professor Luo, I'm coming back to pick you up.\"\"Ah, okay,\" Zheng Baozhu sighed, \"In the end, I'm still causing trouble for you to take leave.\"\"What trouble could there be between us?\" Qu Zhi playfully asked with an affectionate tone, \"I'm already on my way and will be there soon.\"\"Alright,\" Zheng Baozhu responded, and a smile appeared on her face.\"Do you have any idea where to go? To your parents' house?\"Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and said to him, \"Let's forget about that. I don't want to disturb my parents. Actually, I have another villa in Huadu. Let's go there.\"On the other end of the phone, Qu Zhi couldn't help raising his eyebrows, \"You've got another property hidden away?\"\"Hahaha, my parents bought it for me, and I never got around to living there,\" Zheng Baozhu explained, \"Originally, I wanted them to move in, but my mom's friends are all in the old neighborhood, and she didn't want to leave. They said that living in the villa area, there's no one to chat with.\"Qu Zhi nodded, \"Makes sense. They've been living there for over thirty years, after all.\"\"Yeah, the security in Huadu is also better than in my parents' area. It's more suitable for a big star like me to hide.\"Qu Zhi couldn't help but smile as he listened. He couldn't figure out how Zheng Baozhu managed to stir up the entire entertainment industry when she hadn't even appeared in a single drama.While they were chatting, Huanyu held their board meeting, and they released a statement promptly.Huanyu Entertainment V: A solemn statement - Mr. Yu Wei's personal remarks on Weibo do not represent the company's decisions. We will not withdraw our investment from [The Pursuit of the Heart]. We deeply apologize to all the crew members and netizens who have been affected by this incident.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zheng Baozhu sat in the passenger seat, looking at the statement released by Huanyu. There\u00a0were comments from curious netizens and various sources, all criticizing Yu Wei.Zheng Baozhu was engrossed in reading the comments when Gao Boyun called via video. She tapped the screen with her fingertips, and Gao Boyun's face appeared, \"What's up, Director Gao?\"\"Have you seen the statement from Huanyu?\" Gao Boyun asked from the other end.Zheng Baozhu nodded, telling him, \"I'm just enjoying it.\"\"Oh... Huanyu specially contacted me just now and explained a lot. In short, they definitely won't withdraw, so you don't need to worry.\"\"I never worried in the first place,\" Zheng Baozhu said, \"But even if they don't withdraw, I still plan to invest.\"\"Sigh, our drama doesn't lack money now. After Yu Wei said he wanted to withdraw, many investors contacted us, saying they want to invest,\" Gao Boyun complained with a troubled expression, \"Oh, by the way, some of them mentioned that they are your friends.\"\"My friends?\"\"Yes.\"Gao Boyun mentioned a few CEOs of companies; Zheng Baozhu listened and nodded slowly, \"Oh, I do know them. We meet at the business conferences every year.\"\"Besides these CEOs, there's also President Tan from the Rongtai Group. Their group has investments in many fields but has never had any dealings with the entertainment industry. Yet, they suddenly want to invest in our drama,\" Gao Boyun thought to himself that it was because their drama crew was indeed outstanding, \"Let me tell you, our drama crew is now facing the problem of having too many potential investors. We have to select the best ones from them.\"\"Oh...\" Zheng Baozhu listened to him and then said slowly, \"I think I'm quite good, so pick me!\"Gao Boyun: \"...\"\"My mom gave me all the properties left by my aunt, and I've been thinking about how to use this money. Now I know. Investing in my first leading drama is the best choice,\" Zheng Baozhu explained reasonably, \"It feels like witnessing the birth of a protagonist, and from there, I'll continue the journey from the starting point.\"\"...\"Gao Boyun was silent for a moment after hearing her words, \"If you put it that way, I have no choice but to accept this money.\"\"That's right. Let's find a time to sign the contract later.\"\"Okay...\"\"By the way, there's still one role left to cast, right? Can I recommend Wang Jingyi from my studio?\"Gao Boyun raised an eyebrow and asked, \"What's this? You just invested, and now you want to push someone from your studio into the production?\"\"Come on, don't say it like that. I just want to give Director Gao a chance to audition. Whether she's qualified or not depends on her abilities.\"Gao Boyun pondered for a moment and replied, \"I do remember the person you mentioned. She was on the 'New Moon Wuxin Sword' set as a supporting character, right? She's a good friend of yours.\"\"Yes, and her conditions are pretty good. She should be able to handle a minor role.\"\"Okay, then let her audition when the time comes. However, I can't guarantee if she'll be selected or not,\" Gao Boyun said, then glanced at Zheng Baozhu, \"But this matter can easily be misconstrued. Even if she gets selected based on her talent, outsiders might think that you pushed her in.\"Zheng Baozhu didn't seem to mind, \"If others want to say whatever they like, I can't control that. I believe an actor's work will speak for itself. If she's genuinely talented, the audience will see it. Besides, if we don't give her an opportunity to audition just because she's from my studio, wouldn't that be unfair?\"\"As long as you see it that way. By the way, Hanyu's President Song mentioned that he wants to treat us to dinner to apologize, and he specially invited you.\"Zheng Baozhu thought for a moment and said, \"Sure, why not? After all, my conflict is only with Yu Wei, not with Hanyu.\"\"Then I'll respond to them and I'll let you know when the time is confirmed.\"\"Okay,\" After finishing her call with Gao Boyun, Zheng Baozhu hung up the phone. Just as she exhaled a breath, Lin Ziqin called her.Staring at the name on the screen, Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment.Qu Zhi glanced at her phone and smiled teasingly, \"Why don't you answer? Why hesitate?\"\"...\"Wasn't it just because he might get jealous again? :)Clearing her throat, Zheng Baozhu answered the call and put it on speaker, \"Hello, Lin Ziqin?\"\"Um, sorry, I was busy catching a flight yesterday, and my schedule has been tight after landing. I just saw the news about you and Yu Wei.\"Qu Zhi glanced at Zheng Baozhu and made a soft hum from his nose. Zheng Baozhu smiled and said, \"It's okay; it's not your fault.\"Lin Ziqin said, \"I should have waited for you yesterday; that way, Yu Wei wouldn't have kept bothering you.\"\"Don't think like that. Even if you had waited, it wouldn't change anything. If Yu Wei really wanted to bother me, he would find another opportunity. The end result would have been the same.\"Sighing softly on the other end, Lin Ziqin said, \"As long as you're okay, that's what matters.\"\"I'm fine, of course. Right now, the one with a problem is Yu Wei.\"Lin Ziqin chuckled as Zheng Baozhu continued, \"And you don't need to worry about the production either. Director Gao just called me, complaining that there are too many people interested in investing, and he's having a hard time choosing.\"Lin Ziqin laughed even louder this time, \"I believe that. With your current popularity, everyone would want a share of the cake.\"\"No, no, your popularity is even greater, Teacher Lin.\"Lin Ziqin said, \"Alright, let's not flatter each other. Since you're okay, I won't disturb you anymore.\"\"Okay, I won't disturb you either, Teacher Lin. Goodbye,\" After hanging up the phone, Zheng Baozhu turned to look at Qu Zhi. Qu Zhi pretended to focus on driving but was actually listening intently to her conversation with Lin Ziqin.\"All done,\" Zheng Baozhu waved her phone next to Qu Zhi. Qu Zhi pretended to be serious and furrowed his brows, \"Don't distract me while I'm driving.\"\"Oh, sorry. You're driving so seriously.\"\"I've always been serious about what I do.\"\"Oh, I see. Well, good job, and congratulations!\"\"...\"After arriving in Huadu, Zheng Baozhu asked the security guard at the entrance how to get to the building where she was staying, \"Thank you, young man. I haven't been here in a long time, and I couldn't remember.\"After getting the directions, she got back in the car and directed Qu Zhi to go inside. Once they drove away, the duty butler at the entrance approached gossiping, \"Was that Zheng Baozhu just now?\"The security guard got excited, \"Yes, she looks even better in person than in photos! I can't believe she's staying here!\"\"Stay calm, our residents here are all celebrities. Let's not make a fuss about it!\"Qu Zhi parked the car at Zheng Baozhu's residence and she got out to get her luggage. Then she remembered that Qu Zhi couldn't go back to the hotel either, \"Qu Zhi, there are also photos of you online. If you go back to the hotel, you'll definitely be recognized.\"After watching the video sent by Wei Zhen, they saw that many people had come to the hotel, including several live streamers who had come to increase their popularity.Qu Zhi brought his luggage over and walked with her inside, \"I should be okay, right?\"\"It's not certain, it's better if you avoid it temporarily. Wait until the heat dies down, and then we'll see.\"Qu Zhi looked at her speechlessly, \"So, in the end, I'm still a wanted criminal?\"\"Hahaha!\" Zheng Baozhu laughed while opening the door, \"Today was too rushed, and you didn't pack anything. How about you go back home for a few days?\"\"But it's too far from the Starlight Farm and I'll have to transfer on the subway.\"\"The subway here goes directly to the Science and Technology Park! How about you stay here then?\"\"Sure.\"\"...\"Wait a minute, Zheng Baozhu frowned.Did she fall into some kind of trap?\"Qu Zhi, did you plan this from the beginning?\" Zheng Baozhu stared at Qu Zhi with wide eyes, as if trying to read his every expression.Qu Zhi innocently looked at her, \"You were the one who suggested it.\"\"...\" Fine, she admitted, \"But no one has been living here, and there's not much stuff. Why don't I ask Wei Zhen and the others to pack your things and send them over?\"Qu Zhi thought for a moment and placed his suitcase beside the sofa in the living room, \"I'll have Qi Sheng do it for me.\"\"That works too. You guys are more convenient since you're both guys,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"Let's invite him for dinner tonight as well.\"\"Okay,\" Qu Zhi looked around the living room, \"Does someone regularly clean up here?\"\"Yes, and it's kept quite neat.\"\"Okay,\" Qu Zhi turned around again, \"But judging from the decoration, it doesn't seem to be your style.\"\"You hit the nail on the head,\" Zheng Baozhu laughed, \"My dad decorated this house. It's already good enough like this, both he and Mom like this place. That's why I said it's more suitable for them to live here.\"Qu Zhi also laughed, \"It's evident that Uncle Zheng is carefully considering what young people like.\"\"Indeed,\" Zheng Baozhu picked up her luggage again, \"Let's go upstairs. There are plenty of rooms upstairs, so you can choose any one you like.\"Qu Zhi followed Zheng Baozhu upstairs but hesitated, \"Would Uncle Zheng and Aunt Su have any opinions if they knew we were living here together?\"\"Um... If it were someone else, they might rush over immediately. But since it's you, they probably won't have any objections.\"Qu Zhi chuckled and followed her into the elevator, \"I'm honored.\"At lunchtime, Qi Sheng helped Qu Zhi bring his luggage over. Since the two of them had just moved into the villa and hadn't had a chance to buy groceries yet, they ordered takeout from Tianxia Restaurant.\"Sorry, Qi Sheng, I said I would treat you to a meal, but we can only have takeout due to limited conditions.\"Qi Sheng thought Zheng Baozhu was being too polite, \"Even though it's takeout, it's from Tianxia Restaurant!\"The average cost per person at Tianxia Restaurant was nearly four digits, and unless there was a significant occasion, he wouldn't be able to afford to dine there. Living in a villa was indeed different; they ordered takeout from such a high-end restaurant, \"This meal is really great; I'm enjoying it.\"\"...\" Qu Zhi whispered to Zheng Baozhu, \"Not all researchers are like him.\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and waved her hand, inviting them to continue eating.After finishing their meal, Qu Zhi originally planned to return to Science and Technology Park with Qi Sheng and continue working for the rest of the day. However, unexpectedly, the police contacted Zheng Baozhu and asked her to come over. Qu Zhi definitely couldn't let Zheng Baozhu go alone, so he accompanied her.Zheng Baozhu also invited Lawyer Han to join them. When they arrived, they found that Yu Wei was also there, with his lawyer.The reason the police called them was mainly to inquire if they had any intention of settling the matter privately since Zheng Baozhu had reported the incident.\"Mr. Yu has already agreed to compensate you. As long as your compensation request is not unreasonable, he can agree to it,\" the police officer in the middle mediated. Zheng Baozhu firmly refused, \"I don't want money. I'm open to a private settlement, but I demand that Yu Wei publicly apologize to me on Weibo and pin the apology post for half a year.\"\"Don't give face when you're not given face...\" Upon hearing this, Yu Wei became furious once again. Qu Zhi immediately pulled Zheng Baozhu back and coldly stared at Yu Wei. Yu Wei's lawyer also held him back and frowned, saying, \"Mr. Yu, we came here to apologize. Please watch your attitude.\"He used a lot of force in holding Yu Wei's arm; Yu Wei shook off his hand with a frown and stopped speaking.Zheng Baozhu stood behind Qu Zhi, looking at Yu Wei on the opposite side, \"Mr. Yu, if this is your attitude, then I think there's nothing to talk about. Let's settle this in court.\"The police also reminded Yu Wei, \"Mr. Yu, this is the police station. Control your emotions. We have already obtained surveillance footage from Tianxia Restaurant and questioned the staff on duty that night. The evidence and testimonies are not in your favor. In addition to the defamation, once this goes to court, it won't be as simple as a Weibo apology.\"Yu Wei pursed his lips without saying anything. His lawyer spoke on his behalf, \"We accept Miss Zheng's request.\"Yu Wei was extremely unwilling, but in the end, he managed to hold back.Zheng Baozhu demanded that Yu Wei post the apology on Weibo publicly and pin it.Yu Wei's face turned purple with anger. He edited a very simple apology statement, but Zheng Baozhu wasn't satisfied after reading it, \"This lacks sincerity. If you really can't write it, then I'll do it, and you can just type it out.\"With a cold expression, Yu Wei typed out the words exactly as Zheng Baozhu said.Yu Wei V: Regarding my unfounded accusations against Miss Zheng Baozhu last night, I sincerely apologize here. I should not have falsely accused her of being arrogant just because she refused to go to KTV with me, nor should I have defamed her by insinuating an inappropriate relationship with Director Gao Boyun. My irresponsible remarks have caused harm to Miss Zheng Baozhu's reputation, and I want to sincerely say sorry once again!After the Weibo post was published, netizens immediately flocked to it.\u300c??? He knelt so quickly. \u300d\u300c[Villain.jpg]\u300d\u300cHahaha, Yu Wei didn't expect to hit a wall this time, right? \u300d\u300cServes him right, serves him right, serves him right, serves him right, serves him right!!\u300d\u300cGood for her! Miss Baozhu did it beautifully!\u300d\u300cThat marketing account, shouldn't they come out to apologize together???\u300d\u300cHahaha, I just checked the marketing account's Weibo post, and it's already deleted. Probably saw Yu Wei kneeling, realizing they couldn't handle it themselves. \u300d\u300cMiss Baozhu is so magnanimous! She should've had him arrested!!!\u300d\u300cPresident Zheng is awesome. \u00a0This is like a novel in the entertainment industry. \u300dZheng Baozhu logged on to Weibo and reposted Yu Wei's apology post.Zheng Baozhu V: This Weibo post will be pinned for half a year. Please help supervise, my dear netizens.When Yu Wei saw the reposted Weibo, he was so angry that he turned off his phone. What difference does half a year make? He could just stay off Weibo for half a year!After leaving the police station, Zheng Baozhu felt extremely refreshed. She sent a message in a small group, inviting everyone to the villa for a hot pot dinner in the evening.Zheng Baozhu: Since I can't go out right now, you two can come over and buy some groceries on your way.Meng Yaxin: What about Qu Zhi?Zheng Baozhu: Qu Zhi is at the villa keeping me company.Meng Yaxin: ...Cen Tongtong: Suddenly not so eager to go anymore.Zheng Baozhu: You can buy whatever you want, I'll reimburse you.Cen Tongtong: Yay!Meng Yaxin: \u2192_\u2192After sending the message in the small group, Zheng Baozhu returned to the WeChat contacts and suddenly saw Tan Yao's chat icon. They hadn't contacted each other since Tan Yao asked if she wanted to enter the entertainment industry. However, when Gao Boyun mentioned President Tan from the Rongtai Group today, she immediately thought of Tan Yao.If she remembered correctly, Tan Yao was related to the Rongtai Group.The President Tan mentioned by Gao Boyun probably wasn't Tan Yao; could it be his father or an uncle?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zheng Baozhu's name made him pause for a moment. It had been a long time since he last contacted Zheng Baozhu. When he first learned that she wanted to enter the entertainment industry, he was considering how to convince his father. However, before he could come up with a plan, Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi made their relationship official.After that, Tan Yao completely gave up on the idea. He didn't expect Zheng Baozhu to reach out to him today.After reading Zheng Baozhu's message, he frowned slightly and replied: I haven't heard about this news. Where did you hear it from?Zheng Baozhu: Director Gao mentioned that President Tan from the Rongtai Group; is that your father?Tan Yao's frown deepened. According to what the director said, it should be his father. However, his father detested the entertainment industry, didn't he?But his father had been acting a bit strange lately. One time when he went to his father's study, he saw him browsing through information about Zheng Baozhu. As soon as he noticed Tan Yao entering the room, he quickly closed the computer screen.Now, his father was planning to invest in Zheng Baozhu's drama? Could it be that his father liked Zheng Baozhu?\"...\" Tan Yao was rendered speechless by his own thoughts.Tan Yao: I'll ask my father when I get back. No one mentioned this during the meeting today.Zheng Baozhu: Oh... It's alright, I was just casually asking.After work in the afternoon, Tan Yao deliberately waited for his father before leaving. Tan Liwen glanced at Tan Yao, who got into the same car as him, and raised an eyebrow lightly, \"Where's your car?\"\"Oh, I sent it for maintenance,\" Tan Yao smiled and brushed it off, casually closing the car door. Tan Liwen chuckled, not believing him at all, \"Did you get into some trouble again and need my help?\"\"Hey, it really isn't this time,\" Tan Yao turned his head to appraise his old father, \"Dad, I have something to ask you. Are you planning to invest in 'The Pursuit of the Heart'?\"Tan Liwen's expression changed instantly. Seeing his father's reaction, Tan Yao's heart also tensed up.Could it be that he guessed right; his father actually likes Zheng Baozhu??\"Where did you hear this news?\" Tan Liwen asked calmly. Tan Yao thought for a moment and decided to give Zheng Baozhu some cover, \"It was just something a friend mentioned. You know I have a lot of friends, and they come from all sorts of backgrounds.\"\"Is that so?\" Tan Liwen asked in return without confirming or denying anything, nor did he intend to explain anything to Tan Yao, \"This has nothing to do with you.\"\"How can this have nothing to do with me? After all, I am the company's general manager.\"\"Ha, you only remember you're the general manager at a time like this.\"Tan Yao choked for a moment, but then he felt that he had been performing well recently, and his confidence rose, \"If I weren't the general manager, why do you always have me stay at the company?\"\"Aren't you recuperating from your injuries there?\" Tan Liwen said, \"I know you too well.\"\"...\" Tan Yao had nothing to say.\"Even if I'm really planning to invest, it's my personal action, not related to the company. I don't need to explain it to you as the general manager,\" Tan Liwen said.Tan Yao's brows furrowed. By his father saying this, he was, in a way, admitting it. But this made it even stranger. Did he really want to invest his own money? Did this TV drama really have that much appeal?Or perhaps there was someone else with charm involved. :)Thinking about it, Tan Yao couldn't help but sneer, \"Dad, you're not young anymore, why are you getting tangled up in all these things? You know Mom isn't well; it's better not to get worked up and make yourself ill.\"Tan Liwen frowned upon hearing this, \"What are you talking about? Ha, now you're lecturing me? What tangled up things am I involved in? Explain yourself clearly.\"Tan Yao maintained his cold expression, \"Isn't it the 'mistakes that all men in the world make'? Ha, even if you want to make those mistakes, others won't give you the opportunity.\"\"...Tan Yao! I think you want to rebel!\" Tan Liwen exploded in anger. If the car wasn't still on the road, he would have kicked Tan Yao out.After returning home, Tan Liwen continued to mutter complaints, but Tan Yao didn't want to deal with him. He closed the door and locked himself in his room.Loosening his tie, Tan Yao sat on the couch and messaged Zheng Baozhu: I just asked my dad. It seems like his intention is to invest personally, not as a company action.Zheng Baozhu: Personal investment?Tan Yao: Yeah. Do you and my dad know each other from before?Zheng Baozhu: No, I don't know him.Tan Yao: Oh...Looking at Tan Yao's message, Zheng Baozhu also felt something was off. The Rongtai Group had always avoided getting involved with the entertainment industry. It should be because of Tan Yao's father's personal preference. So, now he suddenly wanted to invest in a personal capacity, which seemed unusual.After thinking for a while, she called her mom. As soon as her mom picked up, Su Mingxi excitedly asked, \"Baozhu, I saw the pictures online, your hotel is practically surrounded. Have you left the hotel? What about Qu Zhi? He's not staying at the hotel, is he?\"\"No, we came over to the villa area in the morning...\" Zheng Baozhu replied.\"That's good, it's safer there. I feel more at ease with you staying there,\" Su Mingxi said and then asked with a meaningful tone, \"You and Qu Zhi, staying in the same room?\"\"No, there are so many rooms in the villa, don't think too much about it, okay?\"\"I'm thinking too much?\" Su Mingxi laughed, \"Both of you are living under the same roof, yet you're afraid of what others might think?\"\"...\"\"You two should consider getting married. Qu Zhi said his parents will be back next month, so we can have a meal together then and discuss the wedding arrangements...\"\"Let's wait until they come back...\" Zheng Baozhu said but then realized they were getting off-topic, \"No, I called you not to talk about this.\"\"Then what do you want to say?\"\"I just wanted to ask...\" Zheng Baozhu hesitated for a moment, then continued, \"You should calm down a bit...\"\"Are you pregnant?\" Su Mingxi suddenly raised her voice, \"Then I need to contact Qu Zhi's parents even sooner; we should arrange the wedding as soon as possible!\"\"...You're thinking too much. I just wanted to ask about that scumbag my aunt mentioned in the book.\"There was a brief silence from Su Mingxi's end before she continued, \"Back then, your grandmother and I also wanted to know who that person was, but after taking care of the aftermath, we were too busy to investigate further. Later on, we felt it was meaningless to pursue these things; Mingmei wouldn't come back either way.\"Zheng Baozhu remained silent for a while, then asked, \"I don't believe you didn't inquire about this at all. Did you find any clues?\"Su Mingxi asked in return, \"What do you want to do by inquiring about this?\"\"I don't have any plans. Are you worried I'll beat him up or something?\"\"You know what, I think you might actually do that.\"\"...\" Calculating the age, that man should be around fifty now. If she really did something like that, it might lead to a disaster, \"Mom, just tell me, so I have an idea in my mind and won't fail to recognize him if he stands in front of me.\"Su Mingxi considered for a moment before speaking, \"At that time, Mingmei's bodyguard did give us a clue. We asked many staff members, but they couldn't explain it clearly. Later, Mingmei's driver said that during that period, Mingmei often went out to meet a man, and he heard that person was President Tan.\"Zheng Baozhu was stunned for a moment. Although she made this call because of some suspicions in her mind, there was no substantial evidence for her speculations. It was more like a \"gut feeling\". But now the information her mom provided seemed to match with her thoughts, and her heart was slightly stirred.Could it really be Tan Yao's father?\"When we were sorting Mingmei's belongings, we didn't find anything related to that man. Mingmei probably sorted things out in advance,\" Su Mingxi sighed, \"She probably didn't want us to know who that person was, maybe not to affect our family.\"Zheng Baozhu pursed her lips and didn't say anything. That scumbag had a wife and child, so she understood her aunt's concerns. If she revealed this matter, more than one person would be hurt, and it would also involve the scumbag's wife and child.But if she didn't say anything, the scumbag would get away with it, and his wife would remain unaware of the truth.No matter how she looked at it, being a scumbag seemed most advantageous. :)\"Alright, I understand. Let's leave it at that. I'll hang up now,\" Zheng Baozhu ended the call and sat on the sofa, thinking for a moment. Then, she messaged Gao Boyun.Zheng Baozhu: Can you help me get in touch with President Tan from Rongtai Group? I want to meet him.Gao Boyun: ? Why do you want to meet him? He's over fifty years old and not handsome.Zheng Baozhu: ...Can you please try to get in touch for me?Gao Boyun: ...You're so demanding when asking for help.Zheng Baozhu:After a while, Gao Boyun sent President Tan's contact information: This is President Tan's phone number.\"Thank you!\" Zheng Baozhu thanked Gao Boyun and stared at the string of numbers for a while.\"President Tan, this is Zheng Baozhu. Contacting you like this may seem presumptuous, but I have something urgent to discuss with you. Can we meet in person?\" Zheng Baozhu sent a text message to him.She didn't want to find out if he was the man from back then for revenge. She just felt disgusted at the thought that he was investing in[The Pursuit of the Heart].Soon, her phone vibrated, and Zheng Baozhu looked at the screen. It was a reply from Tan Liwen: Sure, I have time tomorrow morning. Where would you like to meet?Now with her status, of course, she had to choose an upscale place, so she arranged to meet at a private club. When Qu Zhi learned that she was going to meet the alleged scumbag from the past, he furrowed his brows, \"It's not safe for you to go alone. I'll accompany you tomorrow.\"\"No need,\" Zheng Baozhu hooked her arm with his and said, \"You already took a day off today because of me, I can't let you take another day off. I can't delay the country's technological development because of my own matters.\"Qu Zhi smiled lightly and patted her head, \"It won't be that serious. I can make up for the day off by working overtime later.\"\"But if you work overtime, won't your colleagues have to work overtime too? It's a team effort, and your independent actions might not be a good idea.\"Qu Zhi frowned but didn't say anything. Zheng Baozhu gently touched his brow and said, \"How about this? Let's have Cen Tongtong accompany me tomorrow. She doesn't have to work, so she'll have more flexibility with time.\"Qu Zhi wasn't very convinced about Cen Tongtong, \"What's the point of having an agoraphobic like Cen Tongtong accompany you? If something happens, who will protect whom?\"Zheng Baozhu smiled and said, \"I arranged the meeting at a private club. If President Tan really dares to do anything, the club's security will throw him out first. Besides, shouldn't you be more worried that I'll put a bag over his head and beat him up tomorrow?\"\"...\" After she said that, he indeed felt a bit worried.In the end, Qu Zhi still compromised but insisted on bringing a few more people. Zheng Baozhu agreed since she didn't mind and brought her assistant with her. They waited outside the club, and Cen Tongtong, who had a club membership card, accompanied Zheng Baozhu inside and sat at a nearby table. Today's main task of the assistant was to observe Zheng Baozhu's table closely, and if anything seemed wrong, they would send a message to the people outside so they could come in.With this series of arrangements, Zheng Baozhu and Cen Tongtong arrived earlier than the agreed time. President Tan also arrived ten minutes early, coming alone without anyone else. It was unclear if he was being cautious or suspicious.President Tan looked as ordinary as described in Su Mingmei's book. Compared to her previous boyfriends, he didn't stand out in looks, but his charm and eloquence had attracted her at the time. However, today when Zheng Baozhu saw him, she just felt that he was a dull middle-aged man and didn't seem interesting at all.\"President Tan, hello,\" Zheng Baozhu stood up when he approached and said, \"I'm Zheng Baozhu. Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.\"Tan Liwen seemed visibly stunned when he saw her. After a moment, he forced a smile and replied, \"Hello.\"Zheng Baozhu smiled back and invited him to sit on the sofa opposite her, \"Let's sit down and talk.\"\"Sure,\" Tan Liwen sat across from Zheng Baozhu, there was some uneasiness between his brows. After observing him for a while, Zheng Baozhu spoke, \"President Tan, your time is precious, so I won't beat around the bush. I wanted to ask you something during this meeting.\"Tan Liwen responded, \"Miss Zheng, feel free to ask directly.\"Zheng Baozhu looked at him and asked, \"Do you know Su Mingmei?\"Tan Liwen's hand, which was reaching for a coffee cup, suddenly froze in mid-air. He stiffened for a moment. Zheng Baozhu glanced at his hand, which stopped midway, and felt that this matter was almost confirmed, \"In fact, Su Mingmei was my aunt. Before her suicide, she wrote a letter mentioning you.\"Tan Liwen looked up in shock, gazing at Zheng Baozhu. She looked back at him, her gaze calm without revealing much.Beside them, the assistant observed silently and admired Zheng Baozhu. She truly deserved to be called the \"Ceiling of Society\"! The middle-aged man in front of her had the aura of a superior, naturally intimidating to younger people, but Zheng Baozhu showed no fear in front of him! Truly, she was their boss!Tan Liwen withdrew his hand completely and placed it on the table, clenching his fist. \"Su Mingmei left a farewell letter?\"\"Yes,\" Zheng Baozhu nodded, \"The letter was not made public; only our family knew about it. At that time, my aunt already suffered from severe depression, but she met a man who was witty and humorous, always able to make her smile. She thought this man was her lifesaver, but he turned out to be the last straw that broke the camel's back.\"Tan Liwen's eyes suddenly reddened, and his emotions became obvious, \"I'm sorry. When I heard about her death, I was completely stunned. I knew that I must have had something to do with her...\"He became more agitated, and his nails dug deeply into his palms. \"It's all my fault, it's my fault! At that time, I even thought about going with her! But, but I...\"\"But you still have a wife and children, right?\" Zheng Baozhu sneered, \"Now you remember that you have a family and responsibility? When you pursued my aunt, why didn't you think about them?\"\"I... I really didn't mean to,\" Tan Liwen looked up, desperately trying to explain to Zheng Baozhu, \"Mingmei was truly a charming person. I believe no man in the world could resist her...\"\"Oh, so, in the end, it's still her fault, isn't it?\"\"That's not what I meant,\" Tan Liwen took a deep breath and continued, \"I was tempted for a moment. When we met, I deliberately took off my wedding ring... If I had known it would end up like this, I would never have...\"Zheng Baozhu sneered, cutting him off, \"Enough, your repentance means nothing to me. I just wanted to ask President Tan, what do you mean by intentionally investing in 'The\u00a0Pursuit of the Heart'? Is it to disgust me?\"\"Of course not,\" Tan Liwen looked up, seeming surprised by the thought, \"Actually, when you were gaining popularity online, I noticed you. You look so much like Mingmei that I knew you must be related to her. Later, when Yu Wei used the withdrawal threat against you, I wanted to help you...\"\"Thank you for your kind intentions, but we don't need it. Our production team is not lacking investors.\"Looking at Tan Liwen, Zheng Baozhu continued with a hint of coldness, \"I know you won't be forgiven, but I just want to say...\"Tan Liwen looked at her and pursed his somewhat dry lips, \"I know you won't forgive me, but I just thought...\"\"Thought what? Thought of redeeming yourself?\" Zheng Baozhu chuckled, \"My aunt doesn't need it, and neither do we. If you truly want to redeem yourself, go and make amends with your wife and children.\"After saying that, Zheng Baozhu picked up her bag and was about to leave. As she stood up, she glanced back at Tan Liwen and said with a faint smile, \"Oh, by the way, I lied to you earlier. There's nothing about you in my aunt's letter. It was all my guesswork.\" She then turned toward him and smiled slightly, \"You were never worthy of being mentioned in my aunt's letter.\"Today, Tan Yao seemed to be in an uneasy mood, sitting in his office, unable to concentrate on work. He decided to open Weibo and check today's news.On the trending list, there was the ever-present Zheng Baozhu, and now there was a new hot topic about her.\"Zheng Baozhu and Su Mingmei?\" Tan Yao was momentarily taken aback. The name Su Mingmei was not unfamiliar to him. Although not a star of this era, Su Mingmei's works and songs were widely known, with her song [First Love] being a perennial favorite on their KTV's classic nostalgia chart.However, how could Zheng Baozhu and Su Mingmei be related?Tan Yao clicked on the trending topic; suddenly his heart skipped a beat. He had never noticed it before, but Zheng Baozhu did bear some resemblance to Su Mingmei!When he connected the two, he was suddenly overwhelmed with emotions, realizing that he had missed something obvious. Zheng Baozhu does look somewhat like Su Mingmei!!As he scrolled through the trending topic, his fingertips were trembling slightly.\u300cDidn't expect this, right? There's more to Zheng Baozhu's gossip! After the release of her entrepreneurial history, another classmate has come forward with a submission, claiming that they were classmates in elementary school. Back then, all the classmates knew that Zheng Baozhu's aunt was Su Mingmei! \u300dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Impossible LoversCH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel InfoA+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe person who\u00a0submitted the post had their name and profile picture censored, but their message was still published.\u300cQuan Quan! I\u00a0want to share some information!\u300d\u300cDidn't you mention Zheng Baozhu before? I was her elementary school classmate, and back then, she talked about her aunt being Su Mingmei!\u300d\u300cShe even wrote an essay boasting about it and the whole class knew! But at that time, many people didn't believe it...\u300d\u300cLater, she became the spokesperson for JS, and when my mom and I were shopping in the mall, we saw posters of her for JS. My mom pointed and said, 'Isn't this your elementary school classmate?'\u300d\u300cZheng Baozhu was already very beautiful in elementary school and she definitely didn't have plastic surgery! Her name was unique, so I remember it even now! I never thought my mom would remember too. She told me that many parents knew her aunt was Su Mingmei. They even discussed it during the parent-teacher meetings. \u300d\u300cThere's not much evidence, but I feel like it must be true. \u300dAfter reading the submission, Tan Yao sat in front of the computer for a long time, feeling a bit overwhelmed. Although the submission lacked solid evidence and relied on mere text, Tan Yao couldn't help but believe it was mostly true.So, is it possible that his father didn't actually like Zheng Baozhu but had a crush on Su Mingmei? Could it be that his father was a fan of Su Ming during his younger days? And perhaps her suicide deeply affected him, causing him to avoid the entertainment industry ever since?...Everything seems to make sense now.Online discussions and speculations about the relationship between Zheng Baozhu and Su Mingmei were rampant, some even made comparison charts to find scientific evidence.\u300cOh my gosh, I don't know much about Su Mingmei, just heard her name, but now that I see this comparison chart, Baozhu really looks like her!\u300d\u300cIf it's not plastic surgery, the only explanation is a blood relation, right?\u300d\u300cWell, not necessarily. In reality, there are people who look very similar without any blood relation.\u300d\u300cHaha, I wonder if the person who said Zheng Baozhu had plastic surgery to look like Su Ming is regretting it now. \u300d\u300cAm I the only one curious to read Baozhu's essay? Hahaha!\u300d\u300cPeople often bear resemblances. The more we look at it, the more alike they seem.\u300d\u300cAh, but this doesn't really matter, Baozhu herself hasn't brought it up.\u300d\u300cI agree with the previous comments. Maybe she avoids talking about it because Su Ming's death was a sensitive issue. Let's not delve too much into it.\u300dAfter finishing her conversation with Tan Liwen, Zheng Baozhu returned to the villa with Cen Tongtong. She hadn't paid attention to what was trending online. It was only when Zhou Xiaonan called her that she found out she was on the hot search again.\"Baozhu, you're Su Mingmei's niece? How come you didn't tell me such important information!\"Zheng Baozhu was taken aback and sat up straight, asking, \"How did you find out?\"\"There's a post online from your elementary school classmate, but there's no solid evidence, so now everyone is speculating,\" Zhou Xiaonan browsed the web page while speaking on the phone with Zheng Baozhu, \"So, is it true?\"\"...Yes, I didn't intentionally keep it from you. It's just that there have been too many things happening recently, and I hadn't even considered this.\"\"It's alright, this matter... doesn't really matter. After all, it's your private affairs and you're not obligated to explain it to netizens. Once the hype dies down, people won't discuss it anymore.\"\"Okay... But I'm worried that someone might use this as a topic to create controversies.\"\"I'll have people keep an eye on the internet. If someone deliberately causes trouble, we'll figure out a countermeasure.\"\"Alright,\" Zheng Baozhu hung up the phone and furrowed her brows slightly. It didn't bother her much, but she was worried that her family might feel upset again seeing Su Mingmei's name resurfacing in public.\"What's wrong?\" Cen Tongtong noticed her frowning and couldn't help but ask, \"Is there another problem?\"Zheng Baozhu sighed and propped her head with one hand, \"Not really, someone online revealed that my aunt was Su Ming, and I'm worried that my mom and others might feel uncomfortable seeing it again.\"\"Ah? Who's so bored to do that?\" Cen Tongtong said while opening Weibo, \"Being a celebrity these days means having your entire family history checked? How about you call your mom first to prepare her mentally?\"After some consideration, Zheng Baozhu nodded and called her mom. At this time, her mom should be preparing lunch. The phone rang for a while before someone answered, \"Baozhu, what's up?\"Zheng Baozhu carefully said, \"Mom, I want to tell you about something, but please don't get angry.\"\"...What is it again?\"\"There's this person online claiming to be my elementary school classmate, saying that my aunt was Su Mingmei.\"\"...\" Su Mingxi stayed silent for a moment and then raised her voice, \"What kind of people are on the internet? They bring up any trivial matter to talk about, don't they?\"\"Ah, well, my aunt was quite famous back then.\"\"Isn't it because you boasted about it? What did you tell your classmates?\"\"...I was just a primary school student, how would I know so much! Look at Yao Yao, she also told her classmates that she's related to me! She even asked me for ten signed photos of Lin Ziqin!\"\"...\" Su Mingxi had no words to say.\"And I actually read the post that classmate made. It's because her parents didn't do a good job of keeping things under wraps. Don't blame me for it,\" Zheng Baozhu retorted, \"I called you today just to let you know in advance so that you won't be caught off guard if you see Aunt's name mentioned online.\"\"It won't come to that, alright, I get it. I'll look into it myself,\" Su Mingxi said before hanging up the phone.As Zheng Baozhu put her phone away, it rang again. Cen Tongtong was sitting beside her, scrolling through Weibo, and couldn't help but sigh, \"President Zheng, you really are busy.\"\"Tell me about it,\" Zheng Baozhu picked up the phone and glanced at it. It was Zhou Xiaonan calling again, \"What's up? Is it another trending topic about me?\"\"Forget about trending topics; it's about becoming a spokesperson!\" Zhou Xiaonan's voice was full of excitement, \"Remember the Zhenyi Jewelry?\"\"Zhenyi Jewelry?\" Zheng Baozhu was momentarily confused.\"I told you before that Sun Jing's contract with them was about to expire, right? After the expiration, they extended it for a month but didn't give a clear answer until yesterday.\"Zhou Xiaonan had previously informed Zheng Baozhu that Zhenyi Jewelry's crown prince had been sidelined for a long time but recently regained control of the company. The choice of spokesperson was an external representation of the power struggle between the two factions. However, they couldn't reach a conclusion, so the spokesperson contract had been dragged on.\"Now it seems that the situation in their company has finally settled down and the ambitious crown prince has won!\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu remained silent for a moment and asked Zhou Xiaonan, \"Hold on, why are you so excited? What's your connection with Zhenyi's crown prince?\"\"...I have no connection with him, but I have a connection with you!\" Zhou Xiaonan explained, \"Zhenyi used to hire established actresses like Su Ming as their spokesperson. But in recent years, the faction that gained power had a different management philosophy and believed they should follow the trend of using popular celebrities. So, they chose Sun Jing. Now that the crown prince faction has regained control, they must be going back to their original path.\"Zheng Baozhu blinked, \"Ah, I see. So, they've actually recognized me as a serious actress? I feel a bit embarrassed.\"\"...\" This time, Zhou Xiaonan fell silent for a moment, \"I think they really like Su Mingmei.\"After all, after Su Mingmei's incident years ago, they hadn't employed any new spokesperson for a long time.Zheng Baozhu scoffed, \"Oh, I get it now. I'm just a substitute? What a scumbag!\"Zhou Xiaonan: \"...\"How did the conversation suddenly shift from palace intrigue to someone's backup plan?Coughing lightly, Zhou Xiaonan redirected the conversation back on track, \"Anyway, that's the situation. They've extended an olive branch to you. It's up to you whether to accept it or not. I respect your decision.\"Having known Zheng Baozhu for this period of time, Zhou Xiaonan felt that Zheng Baozhu was hesitant about using Su Mingmei's name to advance her career. It seemed that she cared about this matter or didn't want to rely on her aunt's fame to gain recognition.After considering for a while, Zheng Baozhu asked, \"Why do you think Zhenyi wants to hire me as their spokesperson?\"Zhou Xiaonan explained, \"Firstly, as I mentioned before, the crown prince has regained control, so they must be looking for someone different from Sun Jing. Secondly, remember the spring photo shoot you did where you wore Zhenyi's jewelry? That attracted some attention and laid the foundation. Thirdly, they genuinely admire Su Ming. I overheard the person in charge mention that Zhenyi's patriarch specifically wanted you as their spokesperson.\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu was taken aback.The patriarch is truly Su Mingmei's real uncle; he's even more influential than the current top star.\"Yeah, I think...,\" Zheng Baozhu found herself unsure, \"They may like my aunt, not necessarily me, and that bothers me a bit. But on the other hand, I like this brand, and I'd be happy to be their spokesperson.\"\"Well, actually, I think you're overthinking it. They chose you, so you must have your own value, and they're not charity; they won't give you an endorsement fee for nothing,\" Zhou Xiaonan said logically.\"You're right... But I'm worried that if I accept, netizens will start criticizing me again, saying I'm getting endorsements through my aunt's connections!\"\"Hah, you're too naive. Do you think if you don't accept, they won't say anything?\" Zhou Xiaonan chuckled, \"Back then, Su Mingmei had acted in 'New Moon Wuxin Sword', so now some people are already saying that took on the new iteration of 'New Moon Wuxin Sword' using your aunt's connection.\"\"??!\" Zheng Baozhu's temper flared up again, \"Why are they so meddlesome? It's like they're targeting me every day! Am I not using my aunt's name for nothing if could only land to play Ye Ling?\"\"That's why I'm saying you're getting tangled up in unnecessary things. No matter how well you do, they'll always find a way to criticize you,\" Zhou Xiaonan advised, \"So, instead of worrying about that, why not accept the offer, make them angry, and earn money? As for why the brand chose you, you don't have to worry about that. They must have made that decision after evaluating various factors. If the patriarch's words were that influential, the crown prince wouldn't have been sidelined for so many years.\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu was completely convinced. She felt that Zhou Xiaonan's talent for negotiating was a wasted opportunity in not going to the mall! She had the other party's intentions firmly in her grasp.\"Alright, let's do something big!\" Zheng Baozhu declared, not allowing the haters to get to her!After agreeing, the legal team immediately began the contract signing process. During this time, Zheng Baozhu took the opportunity to check the trend on Weibo. Netizens were still actively discussing the matter. If they had put in that much effort during their university entrance exams, Weibo would have been filled with top university students.She also noticed comments suggesting that she got to play Ye Ling through Su Mingmei's connections. She was tempted to create a fake account and argue with them a few times, but considering her announcement as Zhenyi's spokesperson, she resisted the urge.So, she let them enjoy their last moments of revelry.\"Haven't slept yet?\" Qu Zhi walked out of the bathroom after taking a shower and looked at Zheng Baozhu, who was sitting on the bed, propping herself up with one hand, and kicking her slippers with her feet.\"I can't sleep. It's been a turbulent day,\" Zheng Baozhu said, grinning as she watched Qu Zhi blow-dry his hair.Qu Zhi smiled and took out the hairdryer, filling the room with its buzzing sound, \"They should give you an award on Weibo. You single-handedly boosted their KPI!\"Zheng Baozhu also laughed and watched the man dry his hair after coming out of the shower. Suddenly, an idea came to her, \"Qu Zhi, let me blow-dry your hair!\"Qu Zhi turned back to look at her and handed her the hairdryer. Zheng Baozhu walked over in her slippers and started blow-drying Qu Zhi's hair, doing it in a somewhat professional manner, \"Do you want me to style it for you?\"\"No, thank you. Just dry it.\"\"Alright then,\" Zheng Baozhu imitated the tone of a hairstylist in a salon and asked Qu Zhi, \"Your hair quality is quite good. What shampoo do you usually use?\"Qu Zhi looked at the mirror, \"I use the one you have in the bathroom.\"\"...\" Zheng Baozhu gave him a sharp look, annoyed that he wasn't cooperating. Seeing her reaction, he couldn't help but laugh, \"You're such a grown-up, and you still like to play house?\"\"I have a young heart, so what?\" Zheng Baozhu shrugged at him, \"But you, why did you come to my room to take a shower when I already arranged a room for you?\"Qu Zhi calmly replied, \"I don't know why, but I just feel that the shower in your room is better.\"\"Oh, then why don't we switch rooms?\"\"No need, moving around is too much trouble,\" Qu Zhi said resolutely, \"I'll just come over to take a shower every night.\"\"...\" How can a scientist behave so naturally while being flirty?\"Okay, it's done,\" Qu Zhi's short hair was easy to blow dry quickly. He turned his head to check his hair's dryness and told Zheng Baozhu, \"It's dry now.\"\"Oh, good,\" Zheng Baozhu turned off the hairdryer and sighed somewhat enviously, \"Short hair is so convenient. It takes me forever to blow-dry my hair! Maybe I should get a short haircut too!\"\"If you like it, then go for it. I don't mind,\" Qu Zhi replied.Zheng Baozhu looked at him, \"Really? Meng Yaxin's ex-boyfriend broke up with her just because she changed her hairstyle!\"Qu Zhi said, \"That was that particular man's problem. It doesn't mean that all men have the same issue.\"\"Oh,\" Zheng Baozhu sat closer to him, wrapping her arms around his neck and smiling playfully, \"But you must have a preference for a certain hairstyle, right?\"Qu Zhi held her waist, and with his other hand gently caressed her hair, \"I personally like long hair, but when I thought about it just now, I realized that you would look good in short hair too.\"As he spoke, he lightly kissed Zheng Baozhu on the top of her head, \"Maybe it's mainly because it's you. Any hairstyle suits you.\"\"So sweet?\" Zheng Baozhu raised an eyebrow teasingly, moving closer to Qu Zhi, \"It seems like you have a motive.\"Qu Zhi slowly curved his lips, his beautiful eyes filled with Zheng Baozhu's reflection, \"What motive? Don't you know?\"Before Zheng Baozhu could reply, Qu Zhi's kiss silenced her. She knew that tonight, Qu Zhi didn't plan on returning to his own room again.The next day was the weekend, and Qu Zhi didn't have to work. He woke up early and found Zheng Baozhu still asleep. He went to his room, spent some time writing his paper, and then calculated the time to prepare breakfast in the kitchen.Smelling the faint aroma of breakfast, Zheng Baozhu woke up on her own. Qu Zhi wasn't in bed; he must have been up for quite some time. She sent him a message and lay in bed, playing with her phone lazily.Qu Zhi: I'm making breakfast, come over when you're ready. Brush your teeth first.Zheng Baozhu: Sure.She replied and stayed in bed, skillfully scrolling through content on Weibo.It seemed that the online discussions had an impact. The official Weibo account of the drama [New Moon Wuxin Sword] posted a Weibo to clarify the casting issue.New Moon Wuxin Sword V: Regarding whether Zheng Baozhu is Su Mingmei's niece or not, the crew doesn't know and cannot provide an answer. When we found Zheng Baozhu, she was just a contracted actor in the Film and Television City. We selected her for the role of Ye Ling through a formal audition process. Zheng Baozhu's acting skills are evident to the crew members. We made a short video specifically for everyone to enjoy. [Link] Also, thank you for your attention to [New Moon Wuxin Sword]. The post-production is almost complete, and we will meet you in the second half of the year. [Link]Zheng Baozhu was overjoyed and clicked on the video attached to the Weibo post, watching it with great interest. The video was only about thirty seconds long, indeed a short one, but it compiled all of her action scenes, mostly fight scenes. Zheng Baozhu's movements were sharp and beautiful, showing strength and agility at the same time.The previous official trailer released by the crew was only a little over a minute long, but this time they managed to cut a thirty-second compilation of her solo scenes!This move was a win, and there was no need to say more. Thank you, haters.As Zheng Baozhu's popularity surged recently, the comments on this Weibo post were similar to the ones on the previous official trailer.\u300cAh, it looks so good! This is what a Wuxia should be like!!\u300d\u300cFinally, no more slow-motion shots! Please use this standard for all the fight scenes in the future!\u300d\u300cZheng Baozhu is too amazing! What kind of immortal is she?!\u00a0\u300d\u300cThe fight scenes are indeed beautiful, but you can still tell that dance skills are being used instead of actual martial arts. Nowadays, it seems there are no actors with real martial arts skills left. Although it's a bit regrettable, this is much better than what I've seen before. \u300d\u300cNow! Immediately! Give us the release date! Don't underestimate our support!!!\u300d\u300cI really want to see the full movie. Don't tell me the second half of the year means December?\u300d\u300cI love liking posts that counter the haters of Zheng Baozhu. \u300dZheng Baozhu happily reposted the Weibo and then surprised them even more unexpectedly.Due to the delay in the announcement of Zheng Baozhu becoming the new spokesperson for Zhenyi Jewelry, after officially signing the contract with her, they didn't even have time to shoot the endorsement poster. They decided to announce the news first.Zhenyi Jewelry V: Welcome @Zheng Baozhu to be the new spokesperson for Zhenyi Jewelry! In the future, we will work together with Zheng Baozhu to progress and move forward side by side! Additionally, Zhenyi Jewelry will sponsor all the jewelry needed for the filming of [The Pursuit of the Heart] drama! [Link]This was undoubtedly a heavyweight announcement, causing various parties to come out in excitement. Amidst the fierce competition, Zheng Baozhu, who had been silent for so many days, finally responded to the matter regarding Su Mingmei.Zheng Baozhu V: Hello, everyone, I am Zheng Baozhu. Su Mingmei was indeed my aunt, and I do not deny that. When I first wanted to become an actor, it was because of her influence. I have never publicly claimed my relationship with Su Mingmei (except during elementary school) because it's my family matter, and I didn't want to bring it up deliberately. Moreover, I don't want people to know me primarily through Su Mingmei. When you think of me, I hope the first thing that comes to your mind is Zheng Baozhu, not 'Su Mingmei's neice'.Being an actor has always been my dream, and it was my aunt who inspired me. However, because of my aunt's situation, my family was against me pursuing an acting career (which has now been resolved). So when I took the university entrance exam, I couldn't apply for a film academy. Initially, I could only work as an extra in the Film and Television City. Over the years, no matter what setbacks I faced, I never gave up my dream of becoming an actor. In the future, I will continue to pursue it.Let me introduce myself again. I am Zheng Baozhu, and my dream is to become an actress loved by a wide audience.At the end of the Weibo post, there was a photo.
