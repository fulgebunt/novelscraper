Now, I have forgotten a few, but one thing is certain. The fact that you who are reading this now will survive.-Three ways to survive in a ruined world]A web novel platform filled the screen of my old smartphone. I scrolled down and then up again. How many times have I been doing this?\u201cReally? This is the end?\u201dI looked again, and the \u2018complete\u2019 was unmistakable.The story was over.+[Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World]Author: tls1233,149 chapters.+\u2018Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World\u2019 was a feature-length fantasy novel with 3,149 chapters.Its shortened name was \u2018Ways of Survival.\u2019I have been steadily reading this novel since the third year of middle school.During the time when I was bullied by\u00a0iljins,\u00a0when I ruined my entrance examinations and had to enter a local university, when the damned random draw went wrong and I was placed in the military unit at the forefront, when I repeatedly switched jobs and am now working as a contractor for an affiliate of a large company\u2026 Damn, let\u2019s stop talking about this.Anyway\u2026\u300cAuthor\u2019s words: Thank you so much for reading \u2018Ways of Survival\u2019 up to here. I will come back to you with an epilogue!]\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0The epilogue still remains. Then the next chapter is really the last one.\u201dFrom the end of childhood to adulthood, it had been done over a huge period of 10 years. There was a mixture of despondency that a world was coming to an end along with a sense of satisfaction.I opened the comment box of the last message and rewrote the sentence several times.-Kim Dokja: Writer, thank you for everything in the meantime. I am looking forward to the epilogue.They were sincere sentences. Ways of Survival was my life\u2019s novel. It wasn\u2019t the most popular, but it was the best novel for me.There were many words I wanted to say but I couldn\u2019t write them. I was afraid that my careless words would hurt the writer.-An average of 1.9 hits per chapter.-An average of 1.08 comments.This was the average popularity index of \u2018Ways of Survival.\u2019The number of views for the first chapter was 1,2000, but it fell to 120 for the 10th chapter, and then 12 for the 50th chapter. By the time it was the 100th chapter, it was only 1.Hits= 1.I was overwhelmed by the feeling I got when I saw the numerous \u20181\u2019 that appeared next to the list of chapters. In some cases, there was a \u20182\u2019, but it was likely someone pressing the wrong button.\u2018Thank you.\u2019The author published a novel with more than 3,000 chapters with just 1 hit per chapter over a period of 10 years. It was truly a story just for me.I pressed on the \u2018Recommendation Board\u2019 and immediately started tapping on the keyboard, -I am recommending a honey jam novel.The author wrote me a free completed novel, so I should give him a recommendation.\u00a0I clicked on the completed button, and comments quickly appeared.\u2013It looks like a new anti.\u00a0I searched for this person\u2019s ID, and they recommended the same novel several times.\u2013Isn\u2019t his recommendation banned?\u00a0The author shouldn\u2019t do this here.It occurred to me that I had written a recommendation several months ago.\u00a0In an instant, there were dozens of comments for investigation by \u2018spectators\u2019. My face flushed with embarrassment.I was sure that the author would read this.\u00a0\u00a0So, I hurriedly tried to delete the message, but it was already reported that the message couldn\u2019t be removed.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dIt was upsetting to think that the recommendation written with all my sincerity turned out like this.If they even looked a little bit, why didn\u2019t anyone try reading the interesting novel?\u00a0I wanted to give a donation to the writer, but I couldn\u2019t afford it because I was a salary worker barely able to make a living.Then I received a notification that a \u2018message has arrived.\u2019-tls123: Thank you.A message flew in from out of nowhere. It took me a while to grasp the situation.-Kim Dokja: The author?tls123\u2014it was the author of \u2018Ways of Survival.\u2019-tls123: I was able to complete it to the end thanks to you. I also won the competition.I couldn\u2019t believe it.Ways of Survival won a competition?-Kim Dokja: Congratulations! What is the competition?-tls123: You won\u2019t know it because it is an unknown competition.I wondered if he lied because he was ashamed, but I wanted it to be true.\u00a0Perhaps I really didn\u2019t know. It might be a bit hit on other platforms.\u00a0I was a little sad, but it was good to have an excellent story spreading.-tls123: I would like to send a special gift to you as a thank you.-Kim Dokja: Gift?-tls123: It is thanks to my dear reader that this story has come into the world.I gave the writer my email address as he asked.-tls123:\u00a0Ah,\u00a0right. I got the monetization schedule.-Kim Dokja: Wow, really? When will it start? This masterpiece should\u2019ve been paid from the beginning\u2026It was a lie. The Ways of Survival was a daily series, so I would\u2019ve had to spend 3,000 won a month. 3,000 won was one convenience-store lunch for me.-tls123: The monetization starts tomorrow.-Kim Dokja: Then the epilogue coming tomorrow will be paid?-tls123: Yes, I\u2019m afraid you need to pay for it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu-Kim Dokja: Of course, I have to pay! I will buy the last one!There was no reply from the author afterward.\u00a0I logged out of the site. Then I felt the pessimism sink in later.The author left without a reply after he succeeded\u2026?\u00a0My admiration turned into petty jealousy.\u00a0What was I so excited for? In any case, it wasn\u2019t my novel.\u201cWill he give a gift certificate? It would be good if it\u2019s for 50,000 won.\u201dAt that time, I was thinking naively.\u00a0I didn\u2019t know anything about what would happen to the world the next day.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kim Dokja.\u201dKim Dokja (Kim Highly Respected Only Son)\u2014my father gave me that name to be a strong man by myself.\u00a0However, thanks to the name my father gave me, I turned out to be just a normal single and lonely man.In short, it was like this.\u00a0I was Kim Dokja, 28 years old, and single. My hobby was reading web novels on the subway.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go on my smartphone.\u201dIn a noisy subway, I raised my head reflexively.\u00a0\u00a0A pair of curious eyes were staring straight at me. They belonged to an employee from the human resources team, Yoo Sangah.\u201cAh,\u00a0hello.\u201d\u201cAre you going home from work?\u201d\u201cYes. What about Yoo Sangah-ssi?\u201d\u201cI was lucky. The manager went on a business trip today.\u201d Yoo Sangah sat down soon as the seat next to me became vacant. A subtle scent came from her shoulders, making me nervous.\u201cDo you normally take the subway?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u00a0Yoo Sangah made a dark expression.Come to think of it, this was the first time I\u2019d met Yoo Sangah on a subway train.Starting with Personnel Manager Kang to Finance Manager Han\u2026 There were rumors that Yoo Sangah had men from the company driving her home every workday.Yet unexpected words came from Yoo Sangah\u2019s mouth, \u201cSomeone stole my bicycle.\u201dBicycle.\u201cYou commute by bike?\u201d\u201cYes! I have a lot of overtime these days and seem to be lacking exercise. It is a bit annoying, but it is worth doing.\u201d\u201cAha,\u00a0I see.\u201dYoo Sangah smiled. Looking closer at her, I could understand the feelings men held toward her. However, it was none of my business.Every person had a genre of life, and Yoo Sangah was someone who lived a genre different from myself.After the awkward conversation, we looked at our phones. I opened up the novel app I was reading on before while Yoo Sangah\u2026 What was this?\u201cPor favor dinero.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cSpanish.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see. What does it mean?\u201d\u201cPlease give me some money,\u201d Yoo Sangah replied proudly.Studying on the subway while going home\u2026 She truly had a genre different from me.\u00a0However, what was the use of memorizing words?\u201cYou\u2019re working hard.\u201d\u201cBy the way, what is Dokja-ssi looking at?\u201d\u201cAh,\u00a0I\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s gaze was fixed on the LCD screen of my smartphone.\u00a0\u201cIs it a novel?\u201d\u201cYes, well\u2026 I am studying Korean.\u201d\u201cWow, I also like novels. I haven\u2019t been able to read lately because I don\u2019t have time\u2026\u201dIt was surprising.\u00a0Yoo Sangah liked reading novels\u2026?\u201cMurakami Haruki, Raymond Carver, Han Kang\u2026\u201dI thought so.\u201cDokja-ssi, what writers do you like?\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t know even if I say their names.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve read a lot of novels. Who are the authors?\u201dAt this time, it was really hard to say that I read web novels as a hobby.\u00a0I glanced at the title of the novel in the app.[The World after the Fall]Author: Sing Shangshong (TL: The author uses the name of his previous novel and his author name, but with slight changes. I decided to go with the actual novel translation name)I couldn\u2019t say that I was reading \u2018The World after the Fall by Sing Shangshong.\u2019\u201cIt is just a fantasy novel. That\u2026 Well, like the Lord of the Rings\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAha.\u00a0Lord of the Rings. I\u2019ve seen the movie.\u201d\u201cThe movie is good.\u201dThe silence continued for a moment. Yoo Sangah was looking at me like she was waiting for me to say something.Our conversation was becoming strained.\u00a0So, I decided to change the topic.\u00a0\u201cIt has been a year since I joined the company. This is my last year. Time moves really fast.\u201d\u201cYes. At that time, we both knew nothing, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It seems like just yesterday, but the contract period is already over.\u201d\u00a0I realized that I\u2019d said something wrong when I saw Yoo Sangah\u2019s expression.\u201cAh,\u00a0I\u2026\u201d I had forgotten.Yoo Sangah received credit for a foreign buyer last month and was already promoted to a full-time employee.\u201cAh,\u00a0right. My congratulations are late. I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0Haha,\u00a0I should\u2019ve worked hard to study a foreign language.\u201d\u201cAh,\u00a0no Dokja-ssi! There is still the performance review and\u2026\u201dI hated to admit it, but the sight of Yoo Sangah talking was wonderful. It was like the world\u2019s spotlight was shining down on only one person. If this world was a novel, the protagonist would be such a person.In fact, it was the inevitable result.\u00a0I hadn\u2019t tried, but Yoo Sangah made an effort.\u00a0I just read novels on the Internet, while Yoo Sangah studied hard.\u00a0It was natural that Yoo Sangah would become a full-time employee, and that my contract would be terminated.\u201cThat\u2026 Dokja-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind\u2026 Would you like to know the app I use?\u201d\u00a0Yoo Sangah\u2019s voice momentarily became distant.It felt like the world was far away.\u00a0I braced my mind and stared straight ahead.A boy was sitting in the seat opposite me on the train.\u00a0He was 10 years old or so.\u00a0The boy held an insect collecting net as he sat next to his mother, laughing happily.\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi?\u201dWhat if I had a different life from now?\u00a0I mean, what if my life genre was different?\u201cKim Dok\u2026\u201dIf the genre of my life wasn\u2019t \u2018realism\u2019 but \u2018fantasy\u2019\u2026 Could I be the protagonist?\u00a0I didn\u2019t know. It would probably be unknown forever.\u00a0\u00a0However, there was one thing I knew.\u201cIt is okay, Yoo Sangah-ssi.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t work even if you tell me the app.\u201dThe genre of my life was obviously \u2018realism.\u2019\u201cDokja has a solo life.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u00a0What\u2026\u201d\u201cI am just someone like that.\u201dIn this genre, I wasn\u2019t a protagonist but a \u2018solo\u2019 person.\u201cThe life of a solo\u2026\u201d Yoo Sangah had a serious expression on her faceHowever, I waved my hands to show it was really okay.I didn\u2019t know why, but this person was really worried about me. Maybe because she was part of the personnel department\u2026 I was already aware of my performance though.\u201cDokja-ssi is really good.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThen I will live an ivory life.\u201d (Sangah=ivory)Yoo Sangah seemed to have decided something as she turned back to studying Spanish. I gazed at her for a while before returning to the novel.Everything had returned to normal, but strangely, my scrolling of the novel didn\u2019t go well.\u00a0Maybe it was because I realized the weight of reality that I couldn\u2019t scroll down.At that time, a notification appeared at the top of my smartphone. [You have one new mail.]It was from the author of \u2018Ways of Survival.\u2019\u00a0I opened the mail.-Reader-nim, my novel will become paid from 7 p.m. This will be helpful. Good luck.[1 attachment.]The author said he would give me a gift.\u00a0What was the gift?\u2026Like my name, I was also a reader by nature. So, I was excited to receive the mail.Yes, it wasn\u2019t bad living as a reader.I checked the time. It was 6:55 p.m. I had exactly five minutes before the novel became monetized at 7 p.m.Then I opened up my list of preferred novels in the app. Since I was the only reader, I should leave a congratulatory comment and give strength to the author.However\u2026-The work doesn\u2019t exist.I tried typing \u2018ruined\u2019 several times in the search box, but the result was the same.The bulletin board for \u2018Ways of Survival\u2019 had disappeared without a trace.\u00a0It was strange. Had there ever been a case of a novel being deleted without notification when it was going to be monetized?At that moment, the subway lights turned off, and the inside of the train became dark.Kiiiiiiiik-!\u00a0The subway train shook loudly and let out a metallic sound.It caused Yoo Sangah to scream and grab my arm. Then I heard the sound of other people getting stirred up.\u00a0Yoo Sangah gripped my arm so tightly that I paid more attention to the pain in my left arm than the sudden stop.\u00a0It took a dozen seconds for the train to stop fully.Then I heard confused voices coming from everywhere.\u201cUh,\u00a0what?\u201d\u201cW-What is this?\u201dIn the dark, one or two smartphone lights turned on.\u00a0\u00a0Yoo Sangah still held my left arm tightly as she asked, \u201cW-What is going on?\u201dI pretended to be unconcerned. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes, it is probably a disturbance from a suicide. The engineer will soon make an announcement.\u201dAs I finished speaking, I heard the engineer\u2019s announcement, \u2013Telling all passengers on the train.Telling all passengers on the train.The loud surroundings became calm.I sighed and opened my mouth, \u201cSee, it isn\u2019t a big deal. Now an apology will air, and the power will come back on\u2026\u201d\u2013E-Everyone run away\u2026\u00a0Run\u2026!\u2018What?\u2019There was a beeping sound, and the broadcast turned off. The inside of the train became a mess.\u201cD-Dokja-ssi? What is this\u2026?\u201dA bright light flashed from the front of the subway train. There was a loud drumming sound followed by a\u00a0pop.Something was heading this way in the darkness.\u00a0It was just a coincidence that I saw the clock at this moment\u20147:00 p.m.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTick,\u00a0it felt like the world was stopping.Then I heard a voice:[The free service of planetary system 8612 has been terminated.][The main scenario has started.]This was the moment the genre of my life changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The first time he appeared, someone said so. \u300d[1]I didn\u2019t know why but that sentence suddenly popped up in my head. The stopped subway train, the dark room\u2026 These details gave me a sense of deja vu. The subway had stopped before, but it was rare. Even so, why? I remembered the familiar words from a novel\u2026 but it was ridiculous. Wasn\u2019t it impossible?At this moment, the door of car 3807 opened wide, and the electricity returned. Yoo Sangah muttered by my side, \u201c\u2026Dokkaebi?\u201dMy head was ringing. I trembled uneasily as the novel I knew and the reality before me overlapped.\u300cWith two small horns and wearing a small straw mat, the strange and fluffy creature was floating in the air. \u300d\u300c It was too strange to call it a fairy, too evil to call it an angel, and too tranquil to call it a demon. \u300d\u300cThus, it was called a \u2018dokkkaebi. \u300dAnd I already knew the first thing the dokkaebi would say.\u300c&\uc544#@!&\uc544#@! \u2026\u300d[&\uc544#@!&\uc544#@!\u2026.]Fiction and reality overlapped precisely.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cAugmented reality?\u201dAmidst the chattering people, I was thrown into another world alone. This was unmistakably a dokkaebi\u2014the very dokkaebi that opened the door to tragedy for thousands of lives in Ways of Survival. It was Yoo Sangah\u2019s voice that broke me out of my thoughts. \u201cIt sounds vaguely like Spanish. Should I talk to it?\u201dI was a bit taken aback and asked, \u201c\u2026Do you know what that is? Will you ask it for money?\u201d\u201cNo but\u2026\u201dIt was at this time that I heard the correct pronunciation of Korean. [Ah. Ah. Does this sound good? Ah, I had a hard time because the Korean patch didn\u2019t work. Everyone, can you hear my words?]As a familiar language was being spoken, I could see people\u2019s expressions relax. The first one to step up was a big man in a suit. \u201cHey, what are you doing right now?\u201d[\u2026Huh?]\u201cAre you filming? I have to go because I have to quickly get to an audition.\u201d He seemed to be an obscure actor since his face was unfamiliar. If I were a casting director, I would\u2019ve picked him out for his brimming ambition. Unfortunately, the presence before him right now wasn\u2019t a director.[Ah, auditions. That\u2019s right. This is also an audition. Haha, there was a shortage of data. I just entered when it was monetized at 7 p.m.]\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d[Now, now. All of you, relax in your seats and listen to me. From now on, I will tell you something very important!]My chest was becoming stuffy.\u201cWhat? Quickly get off the train!\u201d\u201cSomebody call the captain!\u201d\u201cWhat are they doing without the cooperation of the citizens?\u201d\u201cMother, what is that? A cartoon?\u201dThere was no doubt about it. This was the development I knew. I didn\u2019t want to be mixed up in this\u2026 but there was no way. The people present wouldn\u2019t listen to the small and cute-looking CG creature. The only thing I could do was stop Yoo Sangah who was trying to get up from her seat.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, it is dangerous, so stay here.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Yoo Sangah\u2019s eyes widened. I spoke during a moment of bewilderment, but there was no way to explain what I understood. To be exact, I didn\u2019t have to explain.[Haha, you are really loud.]There was a presence with a stronger persuasive power than anyone else right now.[I told you to be quiet.]I closed my eyes slowly as the dokkaebi\u2019s eyes turned red. Something burst, and the subway became silent.\u201cUh, uh. Uh\u2026\u201d There was a big hole in the forehead of the unknown actor who had to go to the audition. The man who had spoken several times collapsed on the spot.[This isn\u2019t a movie shoot.]There was a cracking sound once again. This time, it was the person talking about the captain.[It isn\u2019t a dream. It isn\u2019t a novel either.]One, two\u2026 Blood sprayed into the air as the heads of some people started to burst. They were all the people who had protested against the dokkaebi, as well as the ones who screamed or went wild. Those who caused the slightest fuss had a hole in their heads. Suddenly, the subway became a bloodbath.[This isn\u2019t the \u2018reality\u2019 that you know. Do you understand? So everyone shut up and listen to me.]More than half the people present here died. Blood and body pieces filled the subway. Now, the people didn\u2019t scream. Like primitive apes in front of a powerful predator, everyone just watched the dokkaebi with terror. I was surprised and held tightly onto the shoulder of Yoo Sangah who was hiccuping.This was real. The strange message which entered my ears, the dokkaebi had appeared in front of me, and the train car that had become a bloodbath\u2026[Everyone, your lives have been nice so far. Isn\u2019t that right?]In the special needs seating area, an elderly grandmother met the eyes of the dokkaebi.[You have been living too long for free. Isn\u2019t life too generous? You were born and paid no price for breathing, eating, pooping and breeding! Ha! You really live in a good world!]Free? No one in the subway lived for free. The people strived to make money in order to survive, and they rode the subway on the way home from work. Yet at this moment, no one disputed the dokkaebi\u2019s words.[But now the good days are over. How long can you continue living for free? If you want to enjoy happiness, it is common sense to pay a price. Isn\u2019t that right?]The gasping people couldn\u2019t answer. Then at that time, someone carefully raised their hand. \u201cD-Do you want money?\u201dI wondered what type of person could speak in the middle of this situation, but surprisingly, I knew his face.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi. Isn\u2019t that Department Head Han of the finance team?\u201d\u201c\u2026Right.\u201dThere was no doubt. He was a typical parachute [2] in the company and the number one person newcomers avoided. It was Han Myungoh, department head of the finance team. Why was this man riding the subway?\u201cI will give you money. Take it. Please note that I am a person like this.\u201d Department Head Han pulled out his business card as people cheered him on. It was the atmosphere of a savior fighting against terrorists. \u201cHow much do you want? A big one? Or two?\u201dHe was offering a sum that was overly large for a department head of a subsidiary company. There was a rumor that Han Myungoh was the youngest son of the leader of the affiliate company and now I thought it might be true. I couldn\u2019t carry that many cheques in my wallet.[Hrmm, you are giving me money?]\u201cT-That\u2019s right! The cash I have right now isn\u2019t much but\u2026 I can give you anything if you let me out of here.\u201d[Money, good. A plant fibre that many humans mutually agree on.]The department head\u2019s expression brightened. It was an \u2018Indeed, money is everything\u2019 expression. How pitiful.\u201cNow, this is all I have\u2015\u201d[It only applies in your time and space.]\u201cHuh?\u201dAt the next moment, flames appeared in the air, and the cheques in the department head\u2019s hands burned up. Department Head Han let out a scream.[That paper has no value in the macrocosm world. If you do this one more time, I will blow away your head.]\u201cU-Uhhh\u2026\u201d Fear once again spread on the faces of the people present.

In fact, I was surprised because of something else.Army lieutenant Lee Hyunsung\u2026 That \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 was this man.I knew who he was. It was the first time actually seeing his face, but his name was clear in my head.

It is really a level one disaster!\u201dEveryone turned on their smartphones at someone\u2019s cry.\u00a0\u00a0Yoo Sangah turned her screen toward me. \u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi, look at this.\u201dThere was no need to enter a search term.

Thus, everyone should confidently continue with their lives\u2026I hadn\u2019t thought much of it when I read the novel, but now I was a bit shocked when hearing those words.\u00a0Terrorism\u2026 Yes, that would be more comfortable.\u201cBut where is the president? Why is the prime minister making the speech?\u201d\u201cThe president has already been hit.\u201d\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure.

It originated from their smartphones.Chiiiik,\u00a0there was a loud sound, and blood filled the screen.

Okay, this is a special service. I will show you what will happen if nothing occurs in the next five minutes.]A giant screen appeared in the subway.

No one could get out.Peong, peeong.\u00a0The heads of the high school girls continued to burst.\u00a0Then a high school girl strangled her friend, who died with a groan.\u00a0After a while, the only thing that remained on the screen was the last schoolgirl looking around.[#Bay23515 channel.

It was already too late. It was inevitable. Anyway, only two people survived in that carriage. \u300dOnly two survived.\u00a0It meant that everyone died except for two people.\u00a0And I already knew who those two people were.I raised my head and looked blankly at Yoo Sangah.\u00a0Maybe this woman would die.\u00a0Me as well.\u201cDokja-ssi, shouldn\u2019t we stop this?\u201dSomething was starting in the place where Yoo Sangah pointed.\u00a0It was groaning.

Won\u2019t you shut up?\u201dThe young man was a male student who had been leaning against the entrance.He was thin and had dyed white hair. His name was written on the badge attached to his uniform.Kim Namwoon.\u00a0It was a name that I knew.\u300c Only Lee Hyunsung and Kim Namwoon survived in that carriage. It doesn\u2019t matter. They are the only two I need anyway. \u300d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to shut up?\u201dThe agitated Kim Namwoon grabbed the grandmother\u2019s collar.

You have to kill your fellow countrymen to live. It is something only sons of bitches will do. But you know, it is a force beyond our control. Beyond our control. We will die if we don\u2019t kill.

It was a scene where the vague morality was collapsing. Kim Namwoon put a wedge in that crack.\u201cA new world requires new laws.\u201dKim Namwoon. A young man who adapted to the world of Ways of Survival the fastest.Kim Namwoon turned around and resumed punching the grandmother.\u00a0This time, nobody stopped him.

Are you doing to just watch? Do you want to fall behind?\u201dPeople trembled at Kim Namwoon\u2019s words.\u00a0Their facial expressions were as easy to read as the sentences in a cheap novel.\u300cIf there is no killing in five minutes, everyone in this carriage will die. \u300dPeople\u2019s eyes were changing.\u300cIf the grandmother doesn\u2019t die, we will die in five minutes\u2026 \u300dThe most primitive eyes that a living creature could have.\u201cYes\u2026 This bastard is right.

So we can live!\u201d\u201cAh fuck\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201dThe second and third.The people standing aloof from the grandmother.\u00a0The cowardly men who had been lingering.\u00a0The university student filming this with their phone.\u00a0The mother of the child and Han Myungoh.They all lynched the grandmother, aiming for her death.\u201cDie! Die quickly!\u201dThey were like guards cooperating for the death penalty. Like the guards pulling the lever at the same time so they couldn\u2019t tell who killed the prisoner, these people passively kicked and punched the grandmother.And I was watching all of this.\u00a0I was standing by, like someone watching what happened in another world.The grandmother whose name I didn\u2019t know was someone who wasn\u2019t meant to live.\u00a0In the original scenario, the grandmother died.\u00a0So\u2026 It wasn\u2019t a sin to observe that death.At that moment, Yoo Sangah got up.\u201cYou will be killed.\u201d\u00a0I reflexively grabbed her.\u00a0\u201cI told you not to move.\u201dThe arm I was holding was shaking. Yoo Sangah made tight fists in an attempt to hide her trembling.\u201cI know, I know\u2026!\u201d\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi will die if you go now.\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s eyes were shaking with fear.\u00a0Even so\u2026I realized it. Despite the genre of the story changing, some people still shone brightly.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi. Sit down.\u201dHowever, the person who could change this story wasn\u2019t Yoo Sangah.\u00a0Yoo Sangah wasn\u2019t the protagonist of this world.\u201cHuh? But\u2015\u201d\u201cDo as I say, just this once. I won\u2019t interfere after that.\u201dAfter forcibly putting Yoo Sangah back in her seat, I took a deep breath and turned around. I straightened my back and shook as I breathed out. I slowly loosened my ankles and wrist.In fact, it was a little early to come forward. This wasn\u2019t my plan originally.\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi?\u201dI didn\u2019t answer her call as I looked at the people. The people intent on assaulting the grandmother.I wasn\u2019t still because I was afraid or Kim Namwoon and the people, nor did I consent to their inhumanity.I was just waiting.\u00a0It was for the moment I had to move.\u00a0Thus\u2026Kwaang!Right now.\u201cAck! What?\u201dAn explosion filled my ears and the train shook.\u00a0People cried out. Smoke rose from the front right corner of this carriage.\u00a0It had started.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019 had moved.I kicked off from the ground as hard as I could with my right foot. I passed by the people screaming and sitting down towards the grandmother.\u201cWhat? Eeeeok!\u201dKim Namwoon collided with me and fell to the ground with a scream. At first glance, it seemed like I was saving the grandmother, but that wasn\u2019t what I was aiming for.Where was it?\u00a0I looked around quickly.Somebody had fallen towards the grandmother due to the explosion. It was a kid crying in the middle of this hell.\u00a0The kid who was holding the insect collecting net before.\u201cExcuse me a moment.\u201dI took the net from the child.Once I put my hand into the net, the chitin of a grasshopper reached my fingertips. I took one out and placed it in the kid\u2019s hands. Then I turned towards the people.\u201cEverybody stop. You can\u2019t live if you kill the grandmother.\u201dMy voice was surprisingly clear due to the temporary silence after the explosion. One by one, people started looking at me.\u201cLet\u2019s say you kill the grandmother. What next?\u201dTheir surprised faces looked good. Let me tell you a bit more.\u201cThe grandmother\u2019s death will be recognized for what the dokkaebi calls the \u2018first murder\u2019 and some time will be bought. Then what next?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cIf what the dokkaebi says is true, you each have to kill one thing. So who will you kill after the grandmother? Will you kill the person next to you?\u201dThe people who thought about something retreated from each other.\u00a0Horror was in their eyes.\u00a0In fact, everyone knew.\u00a0The grandmother was just the beginning.Kim Namwoon noticed the shaky atmosphere.\u201cHaha, what are you all worried about? Then kill him next! Cowards. Don\u2019t worry about your turn in advance! The odds are equal!\u201dI figured that Kim Namwoon would say something like this. I cut him off with a slight wave of my hand.\u201cThere is no need to gamble like that. There is a way for you to survive, even if you don\u2019t become a killer.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cW-What is it?\u201dThe people became greatly agitated. Kim Namwoon\u2019s expression distorted.\u201cHave you forgotten? The scenario clear condition wasn\u2019t to \u2018kill a person.\u2019\u201dMost people were still puzzled but a few people noticed something.[Kill one or more living things.]That\u2019s right. From the beginning, the word \u2018person\u2019 was never specified in the contents of the scenario.Kill one or more living things.\u00a0In other words, any life was possible.\u00a0A quick-witted person shouted at the collection net in my hand.\u201cInsect! Insects!\u201dThe grasshoppers were jumping in the collection net. People\u2019s eyes were shining. I nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s right, the insects.\u201dI put my hand into the net and took out a grasshopper. It was a chubby one that I saw earlier.\u201cG-Give that to me! Quickly!\u201d\u201cOne only! I just need one!\u201dI stepped back slowly as I looked at the approaching people.\u00a0I was now facing the explosive madness that tried to kill the grandmother.\u00a0Yet a smile emerged.\u00a0Why? Even in this breathtaking tension, why was my heart beating with joy?\u201cWould you like it?\u201dI waved the net like a trainer provoking an animal. Several impatient people leapt towards me.\u201cThen catch them!\u201dI smashed the grasshopper in my hand.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[You have achieved the \u2018First Kill\u2019 achievement!][100 coins have been earned as additional compensation.]At the same time, I threw the net in my other hand as hard as possible.

Couldn\u2019t you have just given them the insects?\u201dLooking back, I saw Kim Namwoon raising his body.\u00a0\u00a0I responded cautiously to Kim Namwoon, who was stretching his neck, \u201cThere are 12 people remaining.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cThere were three insects left in the collecting net.\u201dKim Namwoon frowned for a moment before smiling broadly. \u201c12 to 3?\u00a0Hahahahat!\u00a0Yes.

You just wanted to see this scene, didn\u2019t you?\u201dI recalled the Kim Namwoon that I knew from Ways of Survival.At this moment, I heard a message in my ears,\u00a0[Exclusive skill, \u2018Character List\u2019 is activated.]Next, a window opened in front of my eyes.\u00a0I still didn\u2019t know exactly what my attribute was, but I looked at the window in front of me.[Character Information][Name: Kim Namwoon.Age: 19.Constellation Support: None (Two constellations are currently showing interest in this person).Private Attribute: Chuunibyou (General)Exclusive Skills: Unusual Adaptability Lv. 3, Knife Fighting Lv. 1, Blackening Lv. 1Overall Stats: Stamina Lv. 3, Strength Lv. 4, Agility Lv. 6, Magic Power Lv. 4Overall Rating: A chuunibyou who was blackened by a special occasion.

It wasn\u2019t an ordinary punch.[Blackening Lv.1]A dark aura rose from Kim Namwoon\u2019s whole body. This was the exclusive skill of the \u2018chuunibyou\u2019 attribute.It was rare to release a skill before the end of the first scenario, but Kim Namwoon was already showing a skill.\u00a0There was a reason why the main character had recruited him, despite his psychopath nature.Peeok!After he hit it, my right shoulder spasmed.

No matter what, I absolutely couldn\u2019t send this guy onto the next scenario.\u201cHaha,\u00a0I knew you would move like that.\u201d\u00a0As Kim Namwoon took something out of his bag, I had an ominous feeling.A blade shone in the fluorescent light.

It really hurt.\u00a0There was a searing pain in my skin. My vision shook, and it felt like death was approaching.\u201cHaha,\u00a0now die!\u201dThe time remaining to the end of the scenario was 1 minute and 30 seconds. I glanced toward the grandmother.

The wound was a little deeper than before, but it still didn\u2019t hurt much.\u201cKim Namwoon.\u201dBehind Kim Namwoon, there were people who were still crawling and looking for insects, as well as those who were willing to hurt each other for their own survival.\u201cYou are right.

It made the familiar train noise.Soon, light flooded in, and darkness was lifted from the windows. We had arrived at the surface ground section of Line 3 between Apgujeong and Oksu.Outside the window, the Han River and Seoul were revealed.Ahh.\u00a0Someone let out a moan. It was a moan which contained deep relief that they survived.However, it didn\u2019t take long for the meaning of that moan to change.\u00a0Ah, ah\u2026The landscape outside the window was no longer the Seoul that they knew.\u00a0Smoke and dust rose from the ruined city.The Han River bridges had collapsed.\u00a0The Han River itself was red with the bodies of soldiers, while among the fallen buildings, a monster was trampling on a K1 tank like it was a toy.[Main Scenario #1 \u2013 Proof of Value has ended.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[300 coins have been acquired as a basic clearance reward.][100 coins have been reduced for the channel usage fee.][Additional compensation settlement will begin.]One world was destroyed, and a new world was born.\u2026And I was the only reader who knew the ending of this world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The ruined Seoul and collapsed buildings.\u00a0Monsters reminiscent of a giant snake were eating the wreckage of a fighter jet that had crashed into the Han River.\u201cW-What the hell\u2026!\u201dI recognized their identity at once.\u00a0An ichthyosaur.\u00a0A monster that was commonly called a sea serpent. It would later be classified as a Grade 7 monster in the world of Ways of Survival.One of the ichthyosaurs looked in this direction.\u201cU-Uwaaah! It is coming!\u201dPeople screamed with fright. But I just looked apathetically at the approaching ichthyosaur. These guys couldn\u2019t be a threat.Kurururung!The ichthyosaur circled around the bottom of Dongho Bridge and vanished into an air bubble.In the world of Ways of Survival, \u2018scenarios\u2019 took precedence over anything else.\u00a0As long as we were protected by the scenario, we wouldn\u2019t have to deal with such monsters straight away. At least for now.[Compensation settlement is delayed due to an unexpected scenario check. Please wait.]The compensation settlement should\u2019ve started right now but only an error message floated in the air.It was probably due to me.\u00a0I looked down at Kim Namwoon\u2019s body, which only had the torso remaining.According to the original Ways of Survival, Kim Namwoon killed most of the people in this carriage and moved onto the next scenario.\u00a0But I stopped it.If my thoughts were right, those who would be angry at Kim Namwoon\u2019s death would appear. Here? Not here. They were in the sky above.[Due to the death of character \u2018Kim Namwoon\u2019, two constellations show a faint hostility to you.Constellations.\u00a0They were mysterious beings in Ways of Survival. They sat watching from the distant nebulas and were the masterminds of this tragedy.Once the constellation\u2019s preferences sign appeared, I realized that it was now starting in earnest.It was funny.\u00a0A day ago, our positions were opposite. Now they were the ones watching me.[A handful of constellations admire your scenario.][The constellations have sponsored you 500 coins.]If there were some constellations who disliked me, there would also be some who liked me.\u00a0Either way, it was an uncomfortable situation. However, I couldn\u2019t do anything about them right now.\u00a0It was my turn to be a clown.I picked up Kim Namwoon\u2019s Swiss knife on the ground and thought.\u2018Feel free to watch. You will end up paying the admission fee with your lives.\u2019\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi? Are you okay?\u201dI looked up and saw Yoo Sangah\u2019s face. Her shoulders were sagging. Blood covered her white blouse and there was a run in her stockings. There was no more of the Yoo Sangah I knew. I held Yoo Sangah\u2019s hand and said.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t save the grandmother.\u201dI looked down at the body of the grandmother, missing its head. I didn\u2019t know the name of the grandmother. In the future, many people would die in this manner.Yoo Sangah looked at me with a complicated gaze.\u201cHow is Dokja-ssi so\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cAh, it is nothing. Rather\u2026 Thank you.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThat, I\u2026\u201dI belatedly thought back to the previous scene.\u00a0I had thrown the net in Yoo Sangah\u2019s direction. I knew what she was thinking.\u201cIt was just a coincidence. It won\u2019t happen twice.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah nodded silently.\u00a0She didn\u2019t know the truth but she was smart. She knew what I meant.\u00a0Someone lived because of my choice and someone else died.\u00a0No matter who survived, I didn\u2019t deserve a thank you.[Wow, amazing.]The dokkaebi appeared in the air.[What on earth happened here? I was just watching the other carriages\u2026]There was a mixture of delight and surprise on the dokkaebi\u2019s face.\u00a0Twinkling stars floated over the dokkaebi\u2019s head.I counted the number of stars. One, two, three\u2026 Twenty, twenty one. Twenty one in total. He would be happy.[For 21 people to be connected to my channel\u2026 Haha, isn\u2019t this quite good? Gosh, thank you for your sponsorship. Constellations. Haha, everyone! Did you properly show off your value?]The number of stars meant the number of constellations connected to the channel.21 wasn\u2019t a lot, but it was a strange number for a beginner dokkaebi.[The number of survivors is quite high? The fellow in the next carriage was a nutter as well\u2026 It seems that things are quite interesting today.]The dokkaebi manipulated something in the air. A moment later, a list of survivors came up.[Survivors from the 3434 Train to Bulgwang, Carriage 3807: Kim Dokja, Lee Hyunsung, Yoo Sangah, Han Myungoh and Lee Gilyoung. A total of five survivors.]Five people. More people than I thought survived.\u00a0I looked at the faces of the survivors one by one.Lee Hyunsung had a good physique and excellent motor skills, so it was expected that he would survive. I even expected Yoo Sangah to a certain extent.In addition, Lee Gilyoung.\u00a0If my guess was right, \u2018Lee Gilyoung\u2019 was the name of the boy standing next to me.\u00a0The fluids from the crushed grasshopper was still on the boy\u2019s hands.\u00a0It was the grasshopper I had squeezed.The boy was looking at his mother, who lost her head.\u00a0The boy\u2019s mother had abandoned him to join in on killing the grandmother. The boy had just watched the whole thing from beginning to end.I hesitated for a moment before touching the boy\u2019s shoulder. It wasn\u2019t foolish sympathy.\u00a0To put it simple, this was\u2026That\u2019s right. Hypocrisy.\u201cKid.\u201dThe boy slowly turned his head and in his eyes, I could see the fear of death that he encountered for the first time in his life.Unavoidable instincts.\u00a0This boy wasn\u2019t grieving his mother\u2019s death. He was just afraid of his own death. It was natural. He was human.\u201cDo you want to live?\u201dThe boy\u2019s eyes shook anxiously. His body trembled with a force that couldn\u2019t be resisted. Then little by little, the boy\u2019s head moved.\u201cThen let\u2019s go together.\u201dLee Gilyoung moved slowly and came close to my legs. Yoo Sangah was watching me with an impressed expression. I unintentionally caused another misunderstanding. In fact, it was meant to be seen. But the target wasn\u2019t Yoo Sangah.[A few constellations are impressed with your good deed.][The constellations have sponsored you 200 coins.]I couldn\u2019t help thinking that it was a low move. But I also wanted to live.Given the upcoming major events, it was essential to draw the attention of the constellations right now.\u201cW-Will you release us now? Didn\u2019t you get what you wanted?\u201dHan Myungoh in a torn shirt shouted from half a dozen steps away.\u00a0Department Head Han Myungoh.\u00a0He was a lucky human.But I couldn\u2019t help wondering. Why was Han Myungoh riding the subway when he had so much money?\u00a0This was the man who had shown off a new S class Mercedes-Benz not long ago.[Hrmm, released? Haven\u2019t you seen outside? Do you really want to go out there?]The dokkaebi chuckled.[It is somehow admirable. In fact, I didn\u2019t expect much from this carriage but you managed to pass the first scenario. This proves that bugs deserve to survive.]His words made us realize our position. Maybe we were like grasshoppers in his eyes.[Now now, shouldn\u2019t there be a reward for overcoming the hardships? As a reward for the first scenario, you are entitled to the sponsorship of the \u2018constellations.\u2019 Waahhh! How about it? Aren\u2019t you looking forward to it? Hmm, you are all unenthusiastic. This is really a big deal.]The reaction was natural.\u00a0I was the only one here who knew what \u2018constellation\u2019 or \u2018sponsorship\u2019 was.The sponsorship of the constellations. The meaning was obvious. One of the key events of Ways of Survival, \u2018Sponsor Selection\u2019 was about to begin.[Hmm, everybody has confused expressions. I can easily tell you. Right now, you are incredibly weak. If you are thrown into the scenarios that will take place, you will be killed when you meet a weak ground rat, let alone a \u2018kruk.\u2019 But kindly, there are some great people in the universe who pity you and would like to sponsor you. Do you understand what I am saying?]Lee Hyunsung finally couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and opened his mouth.\u201cWhat are you saying? Who is sponsoring whom\u2026\u201d[Hmm, my words are just entering dirty ears. Isn\u2019t there an old saying in South Korea? It is better to see it once than listen a hundred times. So experience it directly. Well, the less fortunate ones might not get the chance. Hahahat!]I was tense.\u00a0From now on.\u00a0A good choice here would make my survival in the future easier.\u201cDokja-ssi? Two strange choices suddenly appeared in front of me\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know even if you ask me.\u201dThis was naturally a lie to avoid suspicions.\u00a0By the way, there were two choices.\u00a0Yoo Sangah was quite lucky.\u201cDo it comfortably. Think of it as an aptitude test.\u201d\u201cAptitude test\u2026\u201d\u201cNobody knows what the situation is anyway. Why not do it comfortably?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I understand.\u201dYoo Sangah closed her mouth and started staring into space. It was a profound expression, as if she had encountered something curious.The others suddenly became silent. Everyone was reading the options in front of them.\u00a0I also had my own choices to look at.[Sponsor Selection]-Please select your sponsor-Your chosen sponsor will be your strong supporter.There were four choices like a riddle.\u00a0It meant there were four constellations that wanted to turn me into their incarnation.Four choices wasn\u2019t small considering that the protagonist of Ways of Survival received five options the first time.The constellations never revealed their true name.\u00a0Therefore, all contractors must infer the identity of the constellations by words such as \u2018abyssal\u2019, \u2018demonic\u2019 and \u2018garden\u2019.Of course, this puzzle was nothing to me, the sole reader of Ways of Survival.Let\u2019s see.First, the \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon.\u2019According to my memory, this constellation was a powerful entity that led the group of constellations called the Black Cloud.\u00a0I forgot his real name but I remember it was a very long name.The advantage of this constellation was that the contractor could receive a very strong attack power. In the early days when stamina and strength were in urgent need, there was no constellation as strong as the Abyssal Dark Flame Dragon.Of course, that was limited to the beginning.\u00a0As the power of this constellation was more frequently used, the mind became corrupted and the contractor would become a mad murderer.This constellation usually sponsored the people with the \u2018chuuni\u2019 attribute\u2026 I didn\u2019t know why the constellation picked me.\u00a0I felt uncomfortable and excluded this guy.The second one, the Demon-like Judge of Fire.I can\u2019t believe I was actually seeing this option. Somehow, the strong emotions I felt were enormous.At first glance, the name was overflowing with evil. But this was actually a trap for the wicked. The \u2018Demon-like\u2019 actually meant \u2018not a demon.\u2019\u00a0Then the words \u2018fire\u2019 and \u2018judge\u2019 were added.A being who wasn\u2019t a demon and who made judgments through fire.\u00a0Paradoxically, the master of this constellation was an angel.If I recalled corrected, it was Archangel Uriel\u2026 In fact, I remembered this because someone in the novel picked this constellation as a sponsor.It was a pretty decent choice. This was pending.\u00a0The constellations of \u2018absolute good\u2019 imposed ridiculous constraints if you wanted to use their enormous power.The third, Secretive Plotter.\u00a0It was the first time that I, the sole reader of Ways of Survival, had seen this choice.This name might\u2019ve been mentioned in passing but\u2026 I didn\u2019t know it right now. If I could read Ways of Survival more thoroughly then I might get a feel of the constellation.But I was certain that the owner of this constellation wasn\u2019t a very strong entity.\u00a0Apart from the obvious modifier, there wasn\u2019t one \u2018proper noun.\u2019Secretive Plotter, it was too simple for a constellation. This one was also pending.Finally, there was Prisoner of the Golden Headband.My heart jumped the moment I saw the fourth option.\u00a0I didn\u2019t expect this constellation so early.\u00a0I doubted my eyes several times.\u00a0But it was unmistakably \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband.\u2019At first glance, this name gave off a negative image due to the word \u2018prisoner\u2019. But you had to pay attention to \u2018Golden Headband.\u2019Golden Headband.\u00a0The smallest prison in the world.It was a hint that anyone would recognize if they enjoyed reading Journey to the West as a child.\u00a0There was only one prisoner who was held captive by the golden headband in the journey from east to west.The master of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, who lived in suffering due to the shackle on his head. The Handsome Monkey King with the \u2018golden-gaze, fiery-eyes.\u2019The Great Sage the Equal of Heaven, Sun Wukong.Among the characters that appeared in the novel, there was one supported by Sun Wukong.A wondrous power that could sweep through hundreds of incarnations and to kill thoughts with one lightning strike.The author had described this part with a lot of energy so my memory of it was clear.I didn\u2019t know why such a powerful constellation was showing me interest but if I became the incarnation of the Great Sage the Equal of Heaven, I would be able to survive in this new world more easily than anyone else.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBut\u2026I quickly looked at the door connected to the carriage in front.\u00a0Beyond that door, \u2018he\u2019 was looking at the selection screen like me.If I chose The Great Sage the Equal of Heaven\u2026 Could I win against him?[There is one minute left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]Time was running out.\u00a0I breathed lightly and looked through my options.\u00a0My worries didn\u2019t last long.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You won\u2019t be sponsored by any of the Black Cloud constellations for a while.]I wasn\u2019t surprised because it was an expected message.To make every member of his group turn away because he was rejected\u2026it seemed that this guy was Kim Namwoon\u2019s sponsor in the original work. As expected of the incarnation of this constellation.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is disappointed in you.][She will persistently monitor your justice in the future.]In the case of Archangel Uriel, it was just disappointment. In the first place, the constellations of absolute good would rarely hate someone unless they committed a great injustice.[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 is interested in your choice.][200 coins have been sponsored.]The Secretive Plotter\u2019s case was unexpected. Given the characteristics of the name, maybe he valued my caution.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is interested in your choice.]And the Great Sage the Equal of Heaven\u2026I was concerned.\u00a0Did I make the right choice?\u00a0I didn\u2019t know.\u00a0Maybe I had lost the tremendous opportunity right in front of me.[You haven\u2019t selected a sponsor.]But choosing a certain constellation meant being limited by that possibility.\u00a0The sponsor contract was never a fair deal.I would survive.\u00a0But I wouldn\u2019t survive by being their toys.\u00a0And if my expectations were right, there was a way to become strong without a constellation.\u00a0Maybe it was a way to become stronger than the incarnation of the strongest sponsor.[Haha, is this true\u2026isn\u2019t there one interesting choice? Well, yes. There will be another chance.]The dokkaebi\u2019s crescent moon eyes stayed on me for a moment.[Now now, everyone has finished the selection. Rest here for a while. I have to go prepare the next scenario. I\u2019ll see you in 10 minutes!]After the Sponsor Selection finished, the dokkaebi disappeared.\u00a0He told us to rest, but these 10 minutes were really crucial.In 10 minutes, I needed to sort out this situation and prepare for the following scenarios.\u00a0I tried to recall my abilities in my head.[Character List] and [Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint].I didn\u2019t know the precise use yet but I had a general sense of these skills. This will work somehow.\u201cLet\u2019s all gather together.\u201dThe survivors gathered at my words. The first one to reach out a hand was Lee Hyunsung.\u201cHello, I am Lee Hyunsung.\u201d\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you\u2026although I don\u2019t know if these words suit the situation. As I said earlier, I am a soldier\u2026well, I should say that I was a soldier.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t contact your unit?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dThe grip around my hand was considerable. As expected from the tanker that appeared in the early stages of Ways of Survival.I must take Lee Hyunsung with me.\u00a0He might not look like much now but Lee Hyunsung was an increasingly important figure in the latter parts of Ways of Survival.\u201cAh, Dokja-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI wanted to thank you. If it wasn\u2019t for Dokja-ssi, we would all be dead.\u201d\u201cNo, that isn\u2019t the case.\u201d\u201cEven if I had lived, I would\u2019ve have been able to live as a person. Thank you very much. And\u2026I am ashamed.\u201dLee Hyunsung bowed deeply.\u00a0My mind was a bit complicated.\u00a0In fact, Lee Hyunsung would\u2019ve survived even if I didn\u2019t do anything.Then somebody grabbed my shoulder.\u201cHaha, our contractor did one big thing. Dokja-ssi, do you know my name?\u201dI could tell who it was without looking back. I took the hand off my shoulder and said.\u201cI know, Han Myungoh-ssi.\u201d\u201cHuh, Han Myungoh-ssi? Shouldn\u2019t you call me Department Head?\u201dHan Myungoh was still trying to use his position in this situation.\u00a0He really was the king of authoritarianism in Minosoft.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the company.\u201d\u201cHah, look at this. Are you planning to not go work now? Where did you learn your basic etiquette?\u201dOnce I saw Han Myungoh\u2019s angry face, I once again realized that the world I knew was over.The man in front of me was a \u2018predator\u2019 of the world before the scenario began.\u00a0And I was merely a prey to the predator. It was certainly like that.\u201cNo matter how I think about it, your actions were too much. Yes? If you had the insects then you should\u2019ve tipped me off. Why would you throw them like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi, you have to be good to me. How much time do you have left on your contract?\u201dAll of a sudden, it became ridiculous.\u00a0In the world I had lived in, I was too weak.\u201cHan Myungoh-ssi.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d\u201cW-What?\u201d\u201cYou still don\u2019t understand the situation? Weren\u2019t you hit by that bastard earlier? Minosoft? Do you think the company still exists when the end has come?\u201dHan Myungoh\u2019s face was white and stricken.I turned my eyes towards the other people. Since I was already saying it, I should make it stick.\u201cHan Myungoh-ssi isn\u2019t the only problem. Everyone, you need to wake up. As the dokkaebi said, this isn\u2019t a joke.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI think you should\u2019ve all roughly noticed the situation. Exclusive skills in the attributes window. A game-like interface. Is there anyone who still hasn\u2019t caught onto facts?\u201dIndeed, no one raised their hand. South Korea was easy. Due to the high penetration rate of smartphones, there wasn\u2019t one person who hadn\u2019t played a RPG game.Even if they didn\u2019t play a game, they would\u2019ve read a fantasy novel at least once.Lee Hyunsung sighed.This is like a novel I was reading while standing on duty, but I still can\u2019t feel it. This really isn\u2019t a dream?\u201d\u201cThis is reality.\u201dMy stern answer caused Lee Hyunsung\u2019s eyes to slightly change.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 feels a faint trust in you.[Your understanding of the character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has increased.]Lee Hyunsung nodded.\u201cIt is good that you are certain. Then what do we do now? Dokja-ssi, do you have an opinion?\u201d\u201cWe have to go.\u201dI answered without hesitation.\u201cG-Go? Are you insane?\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi, I don\u2019t think\u2026\u201dThis time, Yoo Sangah joined it.\u00a0It seemed everyone still hadn\u2019t woken up.\u201cThen how long we will stay here?\u201dIn fact, my argument didn\u2019t make much sense. Outside was a heaven of monsters.\u00a0But I knew. Right now, we have to get out of here.\u201cHave you thought about your parents? Do you think your parents are safe in this mess?\u201d\u201cT-The line has been dead for some time. No Kakaotalk\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah cried out desperately.Indeed, Confucianism was still strong in South Korea. Even Lee Hyunsung and Han Myungoh\u2019s expressions darkened at the word \u2018parents.\u2019I grasped Lee Gilyoung\u2019s shoulder, whose head was bowed. The first person to get up was Yoo Sangah.\u201cGo. I will go out.\u201d\u201cN-No! Didn\u2019t you hear what that thing said? Take a break here! If we move then our heads might explode!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s take a majority vote.\u201dYoo Sangah raised her hand first, followed by me and Lee Gilyoung. But it was up to there.\u201c\u2026I have to go to my base but it seems dangerous to move in this situation. There was also the warning.\u201d\u201cShit, you all go by yourselves! I\u2019m not going! I\u2019m not going outside!\u201dI didn\u2019t care about Han Myungoh but the problem was Lee Hyunsung. I had to take Lee Hyunsung with me no matter what\u2026Kuuong!The thick iron plate made a loud sound. The iron door to carriage 3707 was slightly distorted.\u201cW-What?\u201dHan Myungoh\u2019s cry was ignored as the iron door made a deafening sound again.Kuuong!Someone was trying to break the door from beyond it. This was an unexpected situation so I had to think.Was it the next scenario?\u00a0No. The dokkaebi hadn\u2019t come back yet.\u00a0Then\u2026My brain moved quickly.\u00a0Small hairs stood up and a short shiver struck my body.\u00a0That guy.\u201cW-What? Everybody stop it!\u201dHan Myungoh shouted and moved towards the door. Lee Hyunsung moved towards it as well but I stopped him.\u201cYou can\u2019t stop it.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWe have to go.\u201dI looked at the iron door with heavy eyes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHuh?

Which one will you choose?\u201d\u201cU-Uh\u2026\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi, is there any guarantee that the person beyond the iron door is an enemy?\u201dThe Steel Sword appeared at the crucial moment. There was a reason why Lee Hyunsung couldn\u2019t be leader of a party.\u201cSince they are coming from another carriage, it is likely to be a survivor. If we meet\u2026\u201dI looked at the bloody room instead of continuing. Lee Hyunsung followed my gaze and quietly spoke.\u201c\u2026I was too careless. Let\u2019s find a way out.\u201d\u201cG-Go! Go quickly!\u201dAt this moment, both people were aware. The other survivors of the carriages would\u2019ve gone through the same thing as them. They wouldn\u2019t have the good luck of finding \u2018insects.\u2019\u201cThis is broken!\u201d\u201cDamn, we can\u2019t go this way!\u201dWhile listening to Lee Hyunsung and Han Myungoh\u2019s cries, I also checked the doors. There were no more barriers so the doors could now be touched.Apart from the doors connecting the passageways, there were a total of eight access doors on the subway. There were three exits that hadn\u2019t been confirmed yet.Kung!The iron door seemed like it could barely hold on for one minute.Despite being the main character, I didn\u2019t think he would have such high strength in the beginning. I was honestly surprised that he could break such a thick iron door.\u201cDokja-ssi! Here\u2015\u201dI found a working manual switchgear.\u201cNo!\u201dThe opening and closing device worked smoothly but the door didn\u2019t open at once. They door opened around one fifth before stopping like it was jammed.\u201c\u2026It seems to be broken here as well.\u201d\u201cHow about other places?\u201d\u201cThis seems to be the only place where we can escape.\u201dIt was unknown for a child. But the gap was too narrow for men and women to escape. Han Myungoh and Lee Hyunsung tried to pull the doors open but they didn\u2019t move a bit.[Coins Possessed: 4700 C]One of the uses of the coins was to raise overall stats. I had already used 2,700 coins to make my stamina level 10.This problem could be resolved if I used the remaining coins to enhance my strength. But it wasn\u2019t wise to use the coins when the situation was unknown.In the end, there was only one way.\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi. Use a skill.\u201d\u201cHuh? \u201cSkill\u2026\u201dI quietly activated Character List.[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.][Character Information]Name: Lee HyunsungAge: 28 years old.Constellation Sponsor: Master of Steel.Private Attribute: Soldier who Turned a Blind Eye to Injustice (General)Exclusive Skills: Bayonet Skills Lv. 2, Camouflage Lv. 2, Patience Lv. 2.Stigma: Great Mountain Push Lv. 1Overall Stats: Stamina Lv. 8, Strength Lv. 8, Agility Lv. 7, Magic Power Lv. 5.Overall Evaluation: The overall stats are very good. Despite turning away from injustice, he received the choice of a constellation. This is another opportunity for him.Lee Hyunsung\u2019s information came to my mind without any restrictions. Fortunately, the sponsor was the same as what I read in Ways of Survival.\u201cYou should\u2019ve checked it when you opened the attributes window. Lee Hyunsung is a soldier so there must be a skill you can use in this situation.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026I have one but how do I use it\u2015\u201d\u201cJust think about using the skill.\u201d\u201c\u2026Will that work?\u201d\u201cIt will. I did it earlier.\u201dLee Hyunsung didn\u2019t say anything else as he took a deep breath of determination.\u201cHaaap!\u201dLee Hyunsung\u2019s biceps swelled as he grabbed the door. It was the appearance of Great Mountain Push.In fact, Great Mountain Push wasn\u2019t a skill but a \u2018stigma.\u2019 And a stigma was a power from the constellation. I used the word \u2018skill\u2019 in order to avoid suspicions.Dudududu.There was a sound like a huge spring turning and the door started to move.\u201cWhat? This guy has real strength!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it! It is really great!\u201d[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has started to trust you.][Your understanding of the character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has increased.]Rather than doubts, my reliability had risen. Lee Hyunsung was a simpler person than I thought.\u201cCome on, get off!\u201dBut I felt relieved. I handed Lee Gilyoung to Lee Hyunsung.\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi. Carry the child on your back.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dNow the iron door was almost broken. But if my prediction was right, the problem right now wasn\u2019t that iron door.[\u2026Ah, this is really. I knew this would happen. Didn\u2019t I saw it earlier? I told you not to go anywhere, Damn! The scenario isn\u2019t ready yet-]The dokkaebi seemed to be angry as it floated over Dongho Bridge.\u201cWahh! I knew this would happen! I told you not to come out!\u201dHan Myungoh wrapped a hand around his head, like he thought it would explode. But there was no need to worry.[Sigh\u2026it can\u2019t be helped. You are really lucky humans.]It was because the second scenario started the moment the train door was opened.[The second scenario has arrived!]+[Second Scenario \u2013 Escape]Category: SubDifficulty: EClear Conditions: Cross the broken bridge and enter Oksu Station.Time Limit: 20 minutes.Compensation: 200 coins.Failure: ???+\u201cDokja-ssi, something is strange.

The bridge hadn\u2019t been broken yet. In other words, the \u2018bridge was going to be broken.\u2019\u201cDokja-ssi, come quickly!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201dIt hadn\u2019t been broken yet because we got off the train \u2018too soon.\u2019 The dokkaebi said the preparation time was 10 minutes. But we escaped three minutes earlier.Some people might call it cowardly but this scenario couldn\u2019t be cleared without such a shortcut. Especially if I was stuck with burdens such as Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung.\u201cPant, pant. Indeed, Lee Hyunsung-ssi is a soldier and has high stamina.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t open your mouth. You will lose strength.\u201dLee Hyunsung was running first with the kid. He was a natural monster who didn\u2019t invest any coins in his stats, yet the sum of his strength, stamina and agility exceeded 23.The next one was Han Myungoh and then Yoo Sangah with me in the rear. It would be close but I thought we could make it in time.\u201cAh, what is that?\u201dAt this time, Han Myungoh\u2019s scream was heard. There was a huge whirlpool in the centre of Han River, letting out splashes of water.And a giant monster was at the centre of the splashes. An ichthyosaur. The problem was that the ichthyosaur seemed to be twice the size of the one I saw through the window.This wasn\u2019t a sea serpent\u2026it was a sea commander.A general sea serpent was only a grade 7 monster. Given that a grade 9 monstrous land rate was difficult for normal humans to cope with, an average human would be torn apart by a grade 7 monster.In other words, the guy coming now wasn\u2019t a monster that could be caught in the early stages. Of course, there was no need to catch it. It wasn\u2019t created to be caught.Ku ku ku ku!The Han River surged like there was a tsunami and the ichthyosaur moved. It was chewing on the legs of the bridge.\u201cThe bridge is breaking!\u201d\u201cRun! If we run then we can cross it!\u201dThe remaining distance was around 200 metres. If my calculations were correct, we could cross before the bridge collapsed at our current speed.[There is no fun if the game is too easy.]Of course, this was a story for when there were no variables.[The scenario difficulty has been adjusted.][Scenario difficulty: E -> D]The sound of the dokkaebi\u2019s laughter was heard.[Is there any fun if you just run away? Let\u2019s create a bit of atmosphere!][The evil thoughts of the dead have returned.][The surrounding earth is filled with black ether.][The demonic people have woken up!]There was the sound of something chasing us from behind. Yoo Sangah muttered to herself.\u201cZ-Zombies?\u201dZombie-like bodies were coming in huge waves. Some of them were people from the same carriage as us.\u201cWe just need to go a little further! Quickly!\u201dThe distance to the ichthyosaur was now less than a hundred metres. Fortunately, Lee Hyunsung carried Lee Gilyoung and had crossed the safety line. The problem was the rest of us, including me. Han Myungoh shrieked.\u201cY-You bastards!\u201dThere were too many demonic people. If there were only corpses from the subway, we might\u2019ve gotten away. The problem was\u2026\u201cKuweeeoooh!\u201dThe drivers who died on the bridge became demonic people. The path that Lee Hyunsung broke through was covered with demonic people. I looked between the demonic people on the road and the approaching ichthyosaur.\u201c\u2026Everybody get down.\u201dIt was too late.Kwaaaaang!The legs of the bridge shook tremendously as the ichthyosaur\u2019s huge mouth bit it.The scales of the ichthyosaur shone through the dust that poured down onto Han River like rain. A fishy smell of blood and water filled the area.I staggered and raised my body.Once the dust went away, the scenery around me was clear. Piles of shattered concrete and cut steel. The carcasses of the demonic people which the ichthyosaur had cleanly bitten through.The broken leg of the bridge.\u201c\u2026Dok\u2026sii\u2026kay?\u201dYoo Sangah and Han Myungoh raised their bodies from a little further away.One of Han Myungoh\u2019s legs seemed injured and uncomfortable from the previous quake.Lee Hyunsung and Lee Gilyoung cried out from across the bridge but their voices seemed blocked by the safety zone.What should I do? I made plans on the basis of the bridge breaking. But I hadn\u2019t expected Han Myungoh and Yoo Sangah to be with me.At that moment, a voice was heard in the air.[Someone has received the favour of a constellation.][The constellation\u2019s scenario \u2018Deus Ex Machina\u2019 has been activated.]Along with the voice, a brilliant bridge made of light was created among the remnants of the broken Dongho Bridge. Then a message floated in front of me.+[Deus Ex Machina \u2013 Even Bridge]Description: A bridge of light made by a constellation. Only an \u2018even\u2019 number of people can cross the bridge.

This, in my head, suddenly\u2015\u201dI met the eyes of Yoo Sangah, who was talking nonsense. I could roughly guess the situation.Deus Ex Machina. Constellations risked a huge loss by intervening in scenarios.\u201c\u2026It is Yoo Sangah-ssi\u2019s sponsor.\u201dI didn\u2019t know what constellation it was but somebody had chosen Yoo Sangah as their incarnation and wanted her to live.Deus Ex Machine was a rare phenomenon in Ways of Survival. And Yoo Sangah was a person who should\u2019ve already died.I had a moment of doubt. What type of constellation was behind Yoo Sangah?[The information of this person can\u2019t be read in \u2018Character List.\u2019][This person isn\u2019t registered in \u2018Character List.\u2019]I was a bit surprised.I couldn\u2019t see her with my skill? Why? Did she have a special background? Or did she have a mental barrier? But if she had something like that from the beginning\u2026no, wait a minute. Perhaps this was\u2026\u201cDokja-ssi, what do we do now?\u201dI heard Yoo Sangah\u2019s bewildered voice. I didn\u2019t have much time to think.Ku ku ku ku!The Han River was swirling. The ichthyosaur had eaten one bridge leg and was turning its huge body around on the other side of Han River. I bit my lips and once again read the explanation of the bridge.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOnly an \u2018even\u2019 number of people could cross the bridge.In the end, \u2018Deus Ex Machina\u2019 was a toy made by the damn constellations who loved tragedies.There was no way for everyone to survive.Han Myungoh\u2019s body was shaking as his eyes met mine.In the end, somebody must die.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Behind you!\u201dI reflexively leaned forward as a bloody fist came flying through the air. It was a familiar fist covered with energy.I felt something falling towards me and instinctively kicked out. I didn\u2019t need to look back to know what was behind me.A grade 9 human type, demonic person. Human mutants infected with black ether.That\u2019s why demonic people were classified as a high-risk species, despite being grade 9. Demonic people made from a normal human base were no different from zombies, but it was particularly dangerous if their hosts were different.I saw the badge of the school student with a damaged head.\u201c\u2026Kim Namwoon.\u201dThe guy whose head burst a few minutes ago was now aiming for me as a demonic person.Kim Namwoon\u2019s vocal cords that burst out were in a bizarre shape.\u201cKuweeeoooh.\u201d[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint Lv. 1 has been activated!][This person doesn\u2019t have any consciousness. The skill Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint will be cancelled.]Damn, it was as expected.Chwaack!My thigh was scratched by Kim Namwoon\u2019s overgrown black fingernails.A pain that felt like a burn spread through my leg. The skin which hadn\u2019t been cut by a knife was now torn by fingernails.This was the main reason why demonic people were dangerous. The demonic people became several times stronger than when they were human.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, immediately\u2015\u201dI felt something as I spoke. Without looking back, I could see what was going on.\u201cLet me go! Let go! Dokja-ssi! Dokja-ssi!\u201dHan Myungoh, who had just been limping, was carrying Yoo Sangah over one shoulder and moving across the bridge at an astonishing rate.[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 admires how easy you are to fool.][The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is impressed with your sacrifice.][100 coins have been sponsored.]\u2026Indeed. Planning to leave me?By the way, the way he was running was a little strange. Despite being on one leg, he was running as fast as an Olympic athlete.This couldn\u2019t be the exclusive skill of Han Myungoh, who had a big belly. Therefore, it must be the stigma of his sponsor.[The One-legged Swift Horse]And I already knew the constellation who provided that stigma. I used Character List on the distant Han Myungoh.[The information of this person can\u2019t be read in \u2018Character List.\u2019]Once again, Character List didn\u2019t work properly.If I remembered correctly, the stigma of \u2018One-legged Swift Horse\u2019 came from the constellation Lame Trickster.Lame Trickster didn\u2019t give any stigmas in the mental barrier system. In addition, Han Myungoh couldn\u2019t possess such a skill from the beginning. In other words, my skill failed not because of Han Myungoh\u2019s ability.\u2026I was stupid.I looked at the message window floating in front of me and laughed.[This person isn\u2019t registered in \u2018Character List.\u2019]I was thinking too hard when it meant literally that. Character List literally read the information of characters.Yoo Sangah and Han Myungoh were characters who didn\u2019t originally appear in Ways of Destruction. They were people who would\u2019ve died if I hadn\u2019t saved them. It was natural that I couldn\u2019t confirm their information with Character List.\u201cGruk! Gruk! Gruk!\u201dOn one side, the incoming Kim Namwoon and demonic people were jabbering nonsense at me. On the other side, Han Myungoh had already halfway crossed the bridge. Lee Hyunsung and Lee Gilyoung had already entered the safety zone across the bridge so I couldn\u2019t ask for help from them.This was truly a predicament. I couldn\u2019t cross the bridge alone.My brain moved quickly.Should I capture one of the demonic people and cross the bridge? It was worth trying, but the success rate was too low. Unlike the name, the demonic people were categorized as non-human, meaning they didn\u2019t count as a person.\u201cKuaaaack!\u201dSeveral demonic people lost their balance and fell down the bridge.Kwajijijik!The fallen demonic people became the food of the ichthyosaurs. Like piranhas, the ichthyosaurs broke the demonic people into dozens of pieces in an instant.Distant fear came flooding back in. If the number of people on the bridge became \u2018odd\u2019 for even a moment, I would be like them. It was impossible to cross alone.Then?\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s take it slow.\u201dI muttered as I attempted to control myself. Right now, I needed to remain calm. There were still a few usable methods, but the important thing was to handle matters in front of me. I controlled my breathing and walked to the demonic people.\u201cKuweeok?\u201dFortunately, it wasn\u2019t difficult to make the fall down the bridge using inertia.Kyaaaack \u2013 kwajijik!I reduced the numbers by making them fall steadily. The dokkaebi\u2019s stopwatch floating in the air was blinking.The time remaining before the scenario ended was 15 minutes.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dNails flew from a blind spot and pierced my shoulder bone. No matter how calm my mind, no matter how much information I knew, I couldn\u2019t help my untrained body.\u201cKuwoooook!\u201dThe wild Kim Namwoon\u2019s attacks were becoming increasingly faster.Left shoulder.The right thigh.The top of the head.I had to break the flow. I barely avoided the flying fingernails and kicked his legs.\u201cKyah?\u201dBut this person lost all senses and wasn\u2019t hurt at all. I stepped back, hitting a broken steel frame. I could hear the raging sound of the ichthyosaurs at the bottom of the pillars.[A few constellations are rejoicing in your adversity.][The constellations have sponsored you 200 coins.]It was a steady accumulation of coins. Now I held 5,000 coins. It was a significant number of coins for the beginning.[Wow, you are quite good at surviving. Now now! Will any constellations help this poor friend?]It was the dokkaebi\u2019s merchant-like voice. I wanted to tear it apart.[Geez, there is really nobody?]Of course.It would be strange for a constellation to support me after what happened during the Sponsor Selection.[What did I say? You should\u2019ve chosen well when you had the change. How pitiful.]Kim Namwoon attacked me again and again, resulting in damage to my waist.Of course, I also injured Kim Namwoon\u2019s left side with the knife. Thanks to that, his stomach was hanging out like a skipping rope.In order to kill a demonic person, I had to completely destroy the heart. But the skin of a demonic person was hardest near the heart. The Swiss knife wasn\u2019t able to pierce it with sharpness alone.Dammit, it wouldn\u2019t be so hard if I had just one combat skill.[The exclusive skill \u2018Bookmark\u2019 is activated.]\u2026Bookmark?[\u2018Character Bookmarks\u2019 is activated.][Available Bookmark Slots: 3][Bringing up the list of available bookmarks.][People Listed in the Bookmark Slots]Bookmark.

But from the beginning, I had no intention of taking care of them alone.It was a little late. He should appear around now.Kwajik!\u00a0Kwajijijik!There was a crackling sound like he had been waiting. I knew it. I thought he would do reckless things in order to gain achievements and donations.Kwajijik!\u00a0Crunch.It was obviously the sound of a person\u2019s flesh colliding with another body, but it sounded more like a mace crushing flesh.In fact, I had collected this much coins and thought it would be worth challenging the protagonist.But now I realized how mistaken I was.From the stationary train, the demonic people were thrown away in a straight line, as if a tank had rushed through. Was this really a scene caused by a \u2018human\u2019?\u201cKyaack?\u201dThe headless demonic people realized that something was strange and started turning around. However, it was too late.Kwajijik!The man destroyed all the demonic people threatening me and appeared in front of me. An overwhelming force without any weapons. He beat the demonic people with only two fists.I had prepared my mind in advance but sweat still flowed down my back.Dealing with this guy? It was absolutely impossible. I couldn\u2019t win even if my overall stats rose by more than double what they were now.\u201cYou, who are you?\u201dThe man\u2019s cool gaze turned to me.

A large adult man was being grabbed by the neck and hanging like a monkey.I could see Lee Hyunsung looking this way from across the bridge. His expression was anxious but he couldn\u2019t actually see what was going on here. It was due to the safety ward. I could see over there but they couldn\u2019t see here.\u201cName.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat is your name?\u201dLook at this indifferent way of talking, just like a main character.

Indeed, natural born monsters were different.\u201cStop the unnecessary answer. Only answer what I ask from now on. Understood?\u201dI didn\u2019t answer. I thought maybe this might happen. However, this was the worst situation that I desperately hoped would never happen.In the beginning, Yoo Jonghyuk was more intimidating than any other figure.His personality had worn out after going through regression three times.

I told the story using as much concise, short and accurate vocabulary as possible.It was from the first moment the \u2018dokkaebi\u2019 appeared in the subway to the end of the first scenario. Of course, I excluded the skills I got and any important issues.\u201c\u2026You cleared the scenario by killing insects?\u201d\u201cWe were lucky.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk was so surprised he seemed to have forgotten that his mouth was open.\u300c The future has completely changed. \u300dHe was shocked. Originally, the people in carriage 3807 would kill each other in a battle royale, with only Lee Hyunsung and Kim Namwoon surviving.\u201cYou have keen eyes. How did you know there were insects in the carriage?\u201dKilling Intent filled Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes as thoughts brushed through my head.\u300c Is this guy also a regressor? \u300d\u300cIf so, I have to kill him right now. \u300dA person who commits a fault thinks that everyone speaks of it.I wasn\u2019t surprised that he misunderstood me. I quickly opened my mouth.\u201cAn explosion.\u201d\u201cExplosion?\u201d\u201cI was able to find an insect due to an explosion from the carriage in front.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk\u2019s body stopped at these words.\u201cExplain it in a simpler manner.\u201d\u201cWhen the explosion occurred, a kid fell and dropped his insect collecting net. I picked it up by chance.\u201d\u201c\u2026It is a suspicious coincidence.\u201d\u201cCoincidences are always suspicious. If you don\u2019t believe me, ask the people beyond the ward. The boy standing there dropped the net.\u201dBeyond the safety barrier on the way to Oksu Station, people were looking over at this side. The scenario wasn\u2019t over yet so they couldn\u2019t approach or talk to us.Yoo Jonghyuk looked over but showed no signs of moving. His eyes changed and memories that seemed to belong to Yoo Jonghyuk crossed my mind.\u300c I see. \u300d\u300c Explosion. \u300d\u300cThis guy isn\u2019t a regressor. \u300d\u300cHe isn\u2019t the one who changed the future. Rather, the future changed\u2026\u300d\u300c Because of me. \u300dI saw people dying painfully in a powerful explosion and Yoo Jonghyuk blankly watching it.\u300c It is because I started killing them, unlike the other turns. \u300dDue to the impact of Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint, I could feel Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s mental pain and suffering.\u201cAre your questions over?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cThen can you let me go? And let\u2019s go to Oksu together. There isn\u2019t much time remaining to clear the scenario.\u201d\u2018It is difficult.\u201dHowever, a protagonist was a protagonist for a reason.\u201cEverything you said makes perfect sense.\u201dI have never seen a protagonist as careful as Yoo Jonghyuk.\u300c A beginner can\u2019t be so calm. \u300d\u300cHe is abnormally well-adjusted to this changed world. \u300d\u300cHe probably killed Kim Namwoon. \u300d\u300c He has gone beyond being useful to being dangerous. \u300dYoo Jonghyuk\u2019s right eye started shining with a gold colour.

In Ways of Survival, it was the only attribute that could see the future and had the passive of \u2018nullifying all detection skills.\u2019 In fact, only one person had the attribute of \u2018prophet\u2019 in the world of Ways of Survival.\u300c Only a prophet can defend against my Sage\u2019s Eyes. \u300dI didn\u2019t answer and Yoo Jonghyuk bit his lips.\u201cCan you perhaps use \u2018Future Sight\u2019?\u201d\u201cIt is something similar.\u201d\u201cYou knew I would come here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u300c I see. If this man is a prophet, all his actions are convincing. \u300dThe flow was changing. Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s fluctuation was conveyed straight away.

Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut that knowledge is never perfect.\u201dThe only weakness of a regressor.It meant that the future changed when they used their information of the future.

I can fill in the parts you are missing.\u201dThere was no companion as good as a \u2018prophet\u2019 to the present Yoo Jonghyuk. In fact, my present self could play a role similar to a prophet. It was because I was the only reader of this story.[There is one minute to the end of the scenario.]Yoo Jonghyuk bowed his head and started to think.\u300c A prophet will certainly be helpful. \u300d[There are 50 seconds left to complete the scenario.]\u300cNot just the 46th scenario, but later when fighting the \u2018chalatustra.\u2019 But\u2026 can I really believe him? \u300d[There are 40 seconds left to the end of the scenario.]\u300c Companion. \u300dFinally, Yoo Jonghyuk raised his head as I stared at the clock with an irritated heart.\u201cI have decided. I will make you my companion.\u201d[Excessive immersion has severely worn out your mental strength.][Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint has been turned off.]I wasn\u2019t sure if it was due to fatigue or relief but the exclusive skill was released. Now Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s face was as difficult as a philosophy book with no commentary written.Yoo Jonghyuk started to take me across the \u2018Even Bridge.\u2019 Of course, I was still held by the collar but\u2026I thought things would be all right now. I persuaded this damn regressor and was in a good position.We had almost crossed the Even Bridge and were right in front of the safe area when Yoo Jonghyuk suddenly stopped.\u201cI will ask you one last thing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you are really a prophet, you should know your future. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dThe moment I saw Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s serene eyes, goosebumps broke out. His test wasn\u2019t over yet. The grip holding my collar tightened.\u201cKeok.\u201dHis hand raised me up a little bit and a gentle wind passed by my feet. Underneath me was completely empty.The smell of blood mixed in with the smell of Han River as the ichthyosaurs jumped towards their prey with open mouths.\u201cWill I let go of this hand or won\u2019t I?\u201dFor the first time, I started sweating. Let me think. Even without his thoughts, I knew this guy more than anyone else. I closed my eyes and thought about Yoo Jonghyuk.[There are 20 seconds left to the end of the scenario.]Then I came to a conclusion.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk.\u201dI was certain about what he would do. No matter how I thought about it, there was no other ending when it came to Yoo Jonghyuk.I talked as I watched a sea commander approaching in the water.\u201cI will tell you two things first.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cOne, I\u2019m not your subordinate. So I hope you will treat me fairly from now on.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cTwo, I will cooperate with you but you also have to promise to cooperate with me.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk looked at me with interest and nodded.\u201cWell, what is your answer?\u201dI replied with a smile.\u201cGet your hand off me and get lost, you damn jerk.\u201dThen the power holding me disappeared. I was grabbed by the force of gravity. I saw Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s face as I was falling. Yoo Jonghyuk was smiling brightly like something made him happy.Son of a bitch.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI believe you. You are definitely a prophet.\u201dWaiting for me at my crash point was the mouth of the giant sea commander.I closed my eyes from the shock of the impact along with the cold water of Han River. As I sucked in a breath, a warm and enormous darkness swallowed me up.[You have failed to clear the scenario.]\u2026Damn, I have to use that method after all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then I was sucked in somewhere. I wasn\u2019t torn apart because I fell with perfect timing. However, I couldn\u2019t lose consciousness here.I had to stay awake. I needed to wait for a while.I somehow managed to curl up and hold my breath. 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds\u2026I was barely breathing when my hands hit a tangible wall in the darkness.\u201cU-Uwek.\u201dI could barely breathe after coughing up the river water several times. My level 10 stamina saved me from being killed by hitting the water surface, but the large and small bruises all over my body were very painful.I controlled my breathing in order to not fall into a panic and turned on my smartphone.I was worried it might\u2019ve broken in the fall but the power was fortunately okay. It was good that I spent big and bought a smartphone with a waterproof function.Pahat.The flashlight turned on and the surrounding scenery entered my eyes. There were huge walls with concrete by-products floating by. The stomach of an ichthyosaur was more disgusting than I thought.\u201cDammit.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk\u2019s expression as he let go of his hand without hesitation and got off the bridge was vivid. I expected it but it was more shocking than I thought.\u2026If I wanted to be his companion, I had to survive.It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t understand.Companion. The weight of this word was too great for Yoo Jonghyuk. Since his failure in the first round of regression, Yoo Jonghyuk had never made a real \u2018companion.\u2019It was rare for humans to easily follow the growth of a regressor. As a result, he solved everything alone, was revered as a savior and was naturally lonely.To Yoo Jonghyuk, \u2018humans\u2019 were only subordinates or enemies.Thus, this was a test. If I wanted to be in a equal position with him, I had to solve this much alone.\u2026Well, this was when looking at it from Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s viewpoint.\u201cA companion like you\u2026crazy psychopath.\u201dI barely doggy paddled to a floating styrofoam panel and raised my body onto it. Thanks to the warmth of the stomach, I wasn\u2019t cold. However, the problem was from now on.I closed my eyes and played the message log that I heard.[You have failed to clear the scenario.][Paid settlement will begin.][100 coins have been reduced for the channel usage fee.][The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 has nodded at your exciting remarks.][100 coins have been sponsored.][The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 nods are your coice.][100 coins have been sponsored.][The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 is disappointed in your rash remarks.]There were quite a few messages. In addition, a few exposed constellations sponsored me. Maybe it was due to the final conversation between Yoo Jonghyuk and I.I felt a little down as I read through the messages of the constellations one by one and collected the coins. If I had picked one of these constellations in the first Sponsor Selection, this might not have happened.But there was no regret in my choice.After encountering Yoo Jonghyuk directly, I was certain.The Great Sage the Equal of Heaven might be a sponsor of the highest quality but he wasn\u2019t enough. I needed more than just \u2018sponsorship\u2019 if I wanted to confront Yoo Jonghyuk.And I would gain it from here.The walls of the stomach growled and small waves rose inside. The sea commander seemed to be moving somewhere. I turned on my smartphone and calculated the time.According to Ways of Survival, the ichthyosaur started to secret stomach acid around three hours after ingesting food.In other words, I didn\u2019t have much time left.[Haha, it is sad that things turned out like this. It was very interesting.]There was a sound effect before the dokkaebi\u2019s voice was heard.\u201c\u2026Dokkaebi?\u201d[Yes, that\u2019s right. You don\u2019t seem panicked at all?]\u201cI knew you would come.\u201d[Hrmm. It sounds like you were waiting for me?]\u201cOf course I have been waiting.\u201dLight turned on and the dokkaebi appeared. I couldn\u2019t tell for sure from his expression alone, but this guy was clearly interested.I deliberately spoke calmly. If I was pushed here, I wouldn\u2019t be able to eat my meal.\u201cAre you doing to take coins from me?\u201d[\u2026Coins?]\u201cYou have to take coins in exchange for me failing the scenario.\u201d[Hmm, not your life?]\u201cIf it was my life, you would have written \u2018death\u2019 in the failure results column, not three question marks. Doesn\u2019t this mean there is room to negotiation?\u201d[\u2026Hahaha. How interesting.]In fact, there was a loophole in my words. The scenario message was \u2018Failure: ???\u2019. This literally meant that the penalty of failure was unknown. It was just my assumption that it was in exchange for coins. Nevertheless, there was a reason why I was so certain.\u201cAm I wrong?\u201dIt was because I already knew about this scenario. The dokkaebi hesitated for a moment before nodding.[You are right. Amazing. That you could determine this point with such a clue\u2026 as expected from someone who is attraction the constellations\u2019 attention.]The dokkaebi\u2019s tone was filled with sincere admiration.[As you said, you can survive this sub scenario if you pay coins, even if you fail.]\u201cHow much?\u201d[Pay 5,100 coins. Then I will let you live.]I looked at how many coins I currently posessed.[Coins Possessed: 5,100 C]I couldn\u2019t help smiling. This jerk was messing around right now.\u201cThat is too much.\u201d[Haha, then won\u2019t you die? It is up to me to accept the coins or not. If you do something wrong then I can just end it here.]\u201cThen kill me.\u201d[\u2026Huh?]\u201cKill me.\u201d[\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.]\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me?\u201dThe dokkaebi didn\u2019t move. It was natural. He was having a lot of fun with me right now. Furthermore, he wouldn\u2019t have come down here to see me if he had been planning to kill me. For this guy, I had to survive here or I at least had to die miserably.[Haha. You are really making me angry. Look, now\u2026]The dokkaebi\u2019s flat-shaped eyebrows wriggled furiously. It was time to stop the taunts and get to the main point.\u201cLow-grade dokkaebi, Bihyung. How are the activities of a streamer?\u201dIf there was a crack in the face, it would look exactly like this. Dokkaebi Bihyung showed confusion for the first time.[H-How do you know my name?]\u201cYou haven\u2019t been enjoying broadcasting lately, right? The constellations are too stingy.\u201d[W-Who the hell are you? How does a human\u2026]Bihyung\u2019s horns shook. It was natural. An ordinary human couldn\u2019t know about the Star Stream system. But I wasn\u2019t an ordinary human.[A few constellations have doubts about your existence.][The constellation Secretive Plotter\u2019s eyes are shining at your plan.]From now on, it wasn\u2019t a story for the constellations.I mouthed to Bihyung, \u201cHow about we talk after you close the channel?\u201dBihyung was worried and closed the channel.[#BI-7623 channel is closed.]Once the constellations left the channel, Bihyung showed his true colours.[Feel free to speak. You, how can an ordinary human know about the Star Stream broadcasting?]\u201cThat isn\u2019t important.\u201d[Huh?]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBihyung, do you want to be \u2018king of the dokkaebis\u2019?\u201d[What now\u2015]\u201cDon\u2019t you wish to be the best streamer in the network, surpassing Dokgak and Gildal?\u201dBihyung\u2019s complexion was changing.\u201cDokkaebi Bihyung, sign a contract with me.

The actors were humans like me. And the storyteller that connected the two sides was the dokkaebi in front of me.[Ha, hahahahat! You are crazy! A crazy human! I should\u2019ve known it when you refused to sponsoring of the other constellations!]Bihyung laughed for a long time before opening his mouth again.[I don\u2019t know how you know about Star Stream Broadcasting but I can\u2019t accept the offer. I\u2019m a dokkaebi, not a constellation. I can\u2019t be your sponsor.]\u201cYou seem to have misunderstood. I never told you to sponsor me.\u201d[Huh?]\u201cI am well aware that you are a weak dokkaebi. I don\u2019t need your strength. I need your channel.\u201d[My channel?]\u201cSince you can\u2019t seem to understand me, is there a problem with your Korean language patch?\u201d[No, what is this?]\u201cI will explain it simply. I want to sign an exclusive contract with your channel.\u201dBihyung made a blank expression before belatedly regained his spirit.[Wait a minute. Do you want to make a \u2018stream contract\u2019 with me now?]\u201cYes.\u201dA stream contract was originally a contract between dokkaebi and constellations.The constellation\u2019s incarnation would appear on a particular channel and the dokkaebi would receive a portion of the coins earned by the incarnation of the constellation as a commission.Originally, the person who was the incarnation couldn\u2019t intervene in this contract. It was called sponsorship but the contracted incarnation was nothing but a slave.[Hahat, this is a hit.]Bihyung laughed behind small fingers. The surrounding atmosphere was changing.[I don\u2019t know how you know about such things but some human dares to mention the stream contract? It is also a trivial buy with no sponsor?]The tone changed and the surrounding air was filled with killing intent. Indeed, even a low level dokkaebi was strong compared to humans. But it wasn\u2019t enough to make me back off.\u201cIt is worth signing a contract because I have no sponsor.\u201d[\u2026What?]\u201cWhat do you think the purpose of a constellation is to enter a channel?\u201dBihyung looked like a bad student at the sudden question. From now on, it was a special lecture time for the low level dokkaebi.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so nervous. You already know this information. But let\u2019s review it again to see what it means.\u201dBihyung was caught in my pace and nodded despite himself.\u201cThe Star Stream subscribers can be largely divided into two groups. One group are the \u2018fun seekers\u2019 who seek to relieve their boredom with the channel. The other group are the \u2018incarnation searchers\u2019 who want to find an incarnation to contract with them. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d[Yes. That\u2019s right.]\u201cFor this reason, you must be able to satisfy one of the two groups in order to become a famous channel in Star Stream. In other words, either stick to the fun seekers or the incarnation seekers. You have to attract one of them properly.\u201d[You are moderately well informed. But so what? What does this contract have to do with why constellations subscribe?]\u201cI don\u2019t know how many more hints I have to give you. This is why your subscribers number still isn\u2019t over three digits.\u201d[\u2026Shut up. Say it quickly.]Seeing Bihyung thrust his small horns at me cutely, it was hard to believe the dokkaebi had blown up people\u2019s head a while ago. Now let\u2019s stop making fun of him and take a chance.\u201cWhat if there is a channel that can satisfy both the fun seekers and the incarnation searchers?\u201d[What are you saying? Such a thing is impossible. Even if it is possible, it is only for a while.]Bihyung\u2019s words were correct.The reason why it was impossible to satisfy all the constellations was due to the characteristics of the \u2018incarnation searchers\u2019 group.The purpose of these constellations was to \u2018discover an incarnation.\u2019 They changed channels as soon as the Sponsor Selection was over. Due to this, the incarnation searchers group were just temporary customers. But.\u201cThat is a story for when the Sponsor Selection proceeds normally.\u201d[What?]\u201cWhat if there is an incarnation who doesn\u2019t sign a contract with any constellation? And what if that incarnation shows an ability that transcends all over incarnations with sponsors?\u201dThe existence of a strong incarnation would attract the eyes of the constellations. If this incarnation continued to not select a sponsor, the \u2018incarnation searchers\u2019 group would continue to subscribe without leaving the channel.[W-Wait a minute! You, is this why you didn\u2019t select a sponsor\u2026.?]\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d[Ha\u2026this is interesting.]Bihyung grinned at me.[Becoming the strongest incarnation without a sponsor\u2026 if there is such a thing, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be a dream to become the best Star Stream channel. But such an incarnation can\u2019t exist.]\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d[\u2026I admit that you aren\u2019t normal. You have attracted the attention of constellations from the beginning and thanks to it, I have also been having fun. However, there is a limit to your delusions. Haven\u2019t you noticed it after going through that? An ordinary human can never beat an incarnation. That is the law of the world.]\u201cI don\u2019t know that.\u201d[You have already missed the opportunity. Look around you. This isn\u2019t a main scenario. You failed a sub scenario and now your life is at risk. There are no constellations watching you\u2015]\u201cReally?\u201d[\u2026\u2026?]\u201cBy now, the constellations must be in an uproar. Aren\u2019t they? Isn\u2019t everybody clamoring for the channel to quickly be opened?\u201dBihyung was silent.\u201cAren\u2019t they all going crazy with curiosity right now? Who is that crazy person who went against the regressor? Is he really a prophet? Can he really see the future? If he can see the future, what did he get eaten by the ichthyosaur?\u201d[S-Stop! You are\u2026]\u201cFrom now on, I\u2019m going to show it. So shut up and do what I tell you. Do you want to become the king of dokkaebis?\u201dBihyung\u2019s gaze towards me was changing. I could hear the sound of him gulping.Bihyung was worrying. In any case, there was nothing to lose if he believed me here. Then? Bihyung\u2019s pupils moved quickly.[Then let\u2019s settle the scenario failure first. Give me 5,100 coins\u2026]\u201cWhat are you saying? I didn\u2019t fail.\u201d[\u2026Eh?]\u201cMaybe by now I would\u2019ve met the conditions\u2026\u201dI loosened my body and got up from my seat. My cold body was stiff. Bihyung still had a stupid expression on his face.\u201cOpen the channel. It will start soon.\u201d[Start, what will\u2015]Then a message was heard in the air.[The hidden scenario has arrived!]+[Hidden Scenario \u2013 Commander Slayer]Category: HiddenDifficulty: A+Clear Conditions: Kill the ichthyosaur \u2018sea commander\u2019 and escape from its stomach.Time Limit: 10 daysCompensation: 9,000 coinsFailure: Death+\u201cLook, didn\u2019t I tell you to be prepared?\u201dThere were three types of scenarios in Ways of Survival. The main scenario was in charge of progressing the main story. The sub scenarios were responsible for minor events. And the hidden scenarios were only opened through special conditions.[How on earth\u2026?]Bihyung\u2019s lips were shaking with shock.Unlike the main scenarios and sub scenarios that a dokkaebi was in charge of, the hidden scenarios were characterized by their automatic appearance when certain conditions were met.\u201cYou didn\u2019t even know. You low grade dokkaebi.\u201d[You\u2026what on earth?]\u201cAnyway, if I can clear this, I will prove that I have the ability for the contract, right?\u201dBihyung watched the scenario screen with gloomy eyes. He looked at me with a careful gaze and asked.[This scenario, the difficulty is A+. Do you really believe you can clear it?]\u201cYes.\u201dThere was a small wave as the Han River water crashed against the wall of the ichthyosaur\u2019s stomach. Bihyung was silent for a moment before opening his mouth.[\u2026Okay. If you succeed in clearing this scenario then I will accept the contract.]\u201cThe terms of the contract will be negotiated after the scenario is cleared.\u201d[So arrogant\u2026then I will open the channel again. Please try hard.]\u201cAh, wait a minute.\u201dIt would be difficult if he left already. I had something to check.\u201cYou have something left to do.\u201d[\u2026What is it now?]Bihyung\u2019s mocking tone was somewhat annoying.\u201cFix a system error for me.\u201d[System error?]\u201cMy attributes window isn\u2019t opening.\u201d[No way. The system can\u2019t have an error. The scenario system is perfect.]\u201cTake a look yourself.\u201dBihyung looked at me with suspicious eyes and started to mutter something.[The dokkaebi \u2018Bihyung\u2019 has used \u2018System Interference\u2019 on you.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSystem interference.It was an absolute interference skill that could only be used by dokkaebis with the right to interfere in the scenario.In fact, it was unclear if the reason why I couldn\u2019t see the attributes window was an error or not. But at least the dokkaebi would be able to find out something. And if he couldn\u2019t figure it out, that was also a profit for me.[The exclusive skill, \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 is activated!]In the next moment, sparks flew in the air and struck Bihyung.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What if I do this?]\u201cYou can\u2019t do it.\u201d[Kuaaack!]Bihyung screamed like he had received an electric shock. The white fluffy hair on his skin was burnt black.[T-This! This!]\u201cIt\u2019s okay. If you can\u2019t do it then stop. I will ask for another favour.\u201d[This can\u2019t be! I am Dokkaebi Bihyung.

There was no time to delay like this.\u201cThe dokkaebi bag.\u201dBihyung stopped his useless action of digging at the air.[What?]\u201cOpen the dokkaebi bag.\u201d[\u2026How do you know about that?]\u201cAre you going to open it?\u201d[Only an incarnation with a sponsor can use the dokkaebi bag\u2026]\u201cIt is true that all incarnations that use the dokkaebi bag have a sponsor.

All of the advertisements in the Dokkaebi Bag were aimed at the constellations raising incarnations. It was natural. The original customers of the Dokkaebi Bag were constellations.I got rid of the pop-up advertising windows one by one.It was nothing compared to the \u2018disasters\u2019 that emerged after the fifth main scenario, but a sea commander ichthyosaur was no different from a disaster for the early stage incarnations.I needed some items sold in the Dokkaebi Bag to defeat the ichthyosaur.

I didn\u2019t turn it off on purpose.]There was a total of 20 stars above Bihyung\u2019s head. Since not too many of them had left the channel, it seems that quite a few constellations wanted to see what happened to me. Of course, not all the constellations were friendly.[A few constellations are questioning the fairness of the broadcast!][A few constellations are suspicious of the privileges you have received!]It wasn\u2019t unexpected. While the broadcast was off, a hidden scenario started and the Dokkaebi Bag was opened. It was no wonder that the constellations were surprised.[No, preferences? Look at this, Constellations.

Don\u2019t you know that the storyteller vow is never light?]\u201cWill you help me?\u201d[\u2026There is a product search button in the lower right corner.\u201cThank you.\u201dI ignored Bihyung and pressed the magnifying glass icon at the bottom of the package window.[The product search function is activated.][The produce search is limited to 5 times a day. Any additional searches will cost 100 coins per search.]In any case, humans and dokkaebi were the same. The total number of free searches given was five. Two searches were enough to buy the materials I needed so I had three searches left.[The constellation Secretive Plotter is wondering about your plan.]Yes, be curious. If you are curious, keep watching.[The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 is looking angrily at your actions.]Don\u2019t watch if you are going to get all twisted up.I opened my mouth to use the search function.\u201cSearch for the \u2018Ancient Dragon\u2019 item.\u201d[There are three search results.]A small pop-up window soon emerged.* Ancient Dragon\u2019s Heart \u2013 Stock* Ancient Dragon\u2019s Bone \u2013 Stock: 1* Ancient Dragon\u2019s Horn \u2013 Stock: 1I chose the Ancient Dragon\u2019s Heart.[Item Information]Name: Ancient Dragon\u2019s HeartRating: SSDescription: A heart containing the magic power of the ancient dragon \u2018Ignitus.\u2019 It possesses near-infinite magic power and the attribute \u2018Hellfire\u2019 will be acquired if a heart transplant is successful.Price: 1,500,000 CStock: Just sold out.As expected, it was out of stock. From beyond the catalog, Bihyung, who was dealing with the constellations, looked at me with his jaw dropped.[Crazy. How do you know the information about the ancient dragon?]\u201cI just called out a nice name.\u201d[\u2026It seems like a lie.]I shrugged.In the original Ways of Survival, the owner of the Ancient Dragon\u2019s Heart was already determined. If I remember correctly, the owner of the heart was currently in Italy.A person with good luck. They got such a diamond sponsor. I called out several more product names.[The related product search is completed.]* Great Demon\u2019s Eyes \u2013 Stock: 0* White Pure Star Energy \u2013 Stock: 1The Great Demon\u2019s Eyes was sold out\u2026 the hands of the constellations were really quick. Well, I couldn\u2019t buy it since the selling price was 1 million coins.At any rate, it was good to have a sponsor. Now the incarnation with the Great Demon\u2019s Eyes would grow and destroy the beginner scenarios.[What are you really? What type of cheat are you using? How do you know about items that can only be found in the search?]\u201cI just said plausible names.\u201dAmong the three items that I searched for, only the White Pure Star Energy was in stock. Furthermore, the price was 10,000 coins so I couldn\u2019t buy it now. I put it in the shopping cart for now.[What, are you buying it?]\u201cNot right now. I am just window shopping.\u201d[Sheesh, what a waste of time.]\u201cI am going to buy something else so bring up the items I call out from now on.\u201dI called out several item names. After a moment, a list of items emerged in front of me.* Mucus of the Hammer Sea Horse \u2013 Stock: 124* Stone Hog\u2019s Pointed Thorn \u2013 Stock: 17I compared it to the list in my memories. The food of the ichthyosaur, the hammer sea horse and the stone hog, the nemesis of sea species\u2026 There was no doubt. This combination was the best when it came to attacking an ichthyosaur.\u201cFour mucus, four thorns. It is 800 coins?\u201d[Yes but\u2026where are you going to use these miscellaneous items?]\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201d[\u2026I don\u2019t want to be nosy but why don\u2019t you buy something else? For example, this Woryeong Sword Technique. It is originally 8,000 coins but I will now sell it for 4,000 coins. Wouldn\u2019t buying this be more helpful to clear the scenario?]\u201cThank you but I will just buy this.\u201dBihyung wasn\u2019t satisfied but received the payment.[800 coins have been consumed.]In the darkness, a sparkling powder gathered and four elongated thorns and four pockets of black mucus appeared.[I can\u2019t give a refund if you regret it now. Do you understand?]\u201cI know.\u201dI briefly nodded and started working. I took off my top, tied it around my waist and stuck the thorns in the gap, while the pockets were hung from my waist.The stone hog\u2019s thorn was stumpy but became sharp at the end. It was approximately one metre in length. It was a reasonable size to pierce something.[Hrmm\u2026then I\u2019ll be going. I can\u2019t stay with you. There is something fun going on in another place.]\u201cDo it.\u201d[Huhu, then hang in there. I hope the story will bless you.]Bihyung disappeared in a flash of light and the surroundings became dark again. I could use the light on my smartphone but I wanted to save the battery as much as possible.In the darkness, the stone hog thorn was emitting a bluish light. It was a feeble light but for the moment, it would be sufficient.I pulled out a thorn and swung it. Maybe it was because I didn\u2019t have a skill such as Weapons Training or Incarnation of All Soldiers. I couldn\u2019t get used to holding the thorn.[A few constellations are bored.]The impatient constellations left the channel. I couldn\u2019t see it but Bihyung was probably fretting right now.Then an hour passed.Right, left, up and down.I didn\u2019t like it but I no longer had a problem handling the thorn. The surface finish was rough and didn\u2019t seem like it would slip easily from the hand.It was time to begin. I used the proper force and stabbed at the ichthyosaur wall above me.Tiing!It was like poking a rubber elastic wall as the thorn bounced off. My current strength wasn\u2019t high enough to tear at the stomach of the ichthyosaur. It would probably be the same if I used a skill.Ku ku ku ku!At that moment, the small holes at the top of the stomach wall opened simultaneously. Then an absolutely disgusting liquid poured out.\u201cKuweek!\u201dOne of the demonic people floating on something in the stomach started shrieking.Chuchuchu.\u00a0The skin of the demonic person started burning. The digestion of the ichthyosaur had begun. The ichthyosaur\u2019s digestive juices quickly mixed in the river water and started to melt away at the concrete and other floating products.Chu chu chu chu!There was no time. It was going as planned.I jumped from the floating object and gripped a bump on the wall of the stomach. Then I started climbing up the wall like I was rock climbing.Gurgle gurgle gurgle.The outlet of the digestive juices was right above. I put the thorn in my mouth and grabbed a pocket of mucus.The mucus of the hammer sea horse. I poured the mysterious dark blue liquid onto my hand and applied the mucus carefully from the tip to the end of the thorn.It was with precision and care, as if applying shaving cream to an area to be shaved. If the shaving cream protected the skin from the razor, the mucus protected the thorn from the digestive juices.Go. I swung the thorn towards where the digestive juices were coming from. The angle was correct and I used my maximum strength.Kwaang!The digestive juices flowed down the thorn and dissolved the skin on my forearm. I experienced a terrible pain but didn\u2019t stop. If I made a mistake here then everything was over.[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 has relieved some of the pain.]Gurgle, gurgle.\u00a0Chururuk\u2026Before long, the thorn jammed up the emission point.\u201cJust one.\u201dAfter a deep sigh, I pulled out another thorn from my waist. I applied the mucus of the hammer sea horse, found another opening and blocked it.[A few constellations admire your calmness.][The constellations have sponsored you 200 coins.]I used this method to block three opening points. There were some left, but the small openings didn\u2019t release large amounts of digestive fluids.There was one thorn left in the top tightly tied around me. All that was left was one thorn and two pockets of mucus.I used the remaining mucus on my skin and clothes, then poured what was remaining down my throat.\u201cKup.\u201dThe fishy taste on my tongue was sickening but it was better than dying. The bitterness was nothing compared to the disaster that would occur from now on.It was around five minutes afterwards that the entire stomach started trembling.\u2026It had started.Kieeeeeeek-!The ichthyosaur let out a painful scream. The blood vessels on the wall of the stomach were squirming. The thorns were visibly expanding into the blood vessels.The thorns in the openings had started their aggressive growth activity. The stone hog\u2019s thorn grew in response to the body fluids of seawater species.Gududuk, gududuk.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe thorn that became immune to the digestive juices due to the applied mucus absorbed the surrounding fluids and started to take root in the body of the ichthyosaur.The stone hog\u2019s thorns wouldn\u2019t stop expanding until the ichthyosaur was completely dead.Keeeeeeh!As I watched the liquid swirling under my feet, I grabbed the thorn tightly. I did everything I could. From now on, it was a mental fight.Either I died or this guy would die. Only one of us would survive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My breathing was often interrupted and all my muscles were so stiff that I could barely move them.[A few constellations admire your will to survive!][The constellations have sponsored you 100 coins.]But I persisted. I persisted because I believed I could hold on. The light emitted from the thorn in the darkness confirmed that I was alive. After confirming the falling temperature of the stomach wall, I was convinced that he was dying.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 admires your spirit.][The constellation has sponsored you 100 coins.]When I was hungry, I placed my tongue to the end of the thorn.The condensed fluid that flowed out contained the life force absorbed from the ichthyosaur. The reason I drank the mucus in advance was to absorb this concentrate.[Your stamina has slightly increased due to absorbing the power of the ichthyosaur.]There wasn\u2019t an immediate effect of my stats level increasing, but by the time I escaped from the ichthyosaur, I would gain at least two levels in stamina.It wouldn\u2019t work at a higher level, but this was one of the few tricks I could use to raise my stamina without using coins.\u2026Indeed, this wasn\u2019t a dream.This was all I could do. I was just an ordinary reader. I wasn\u2019t a protagonist. It felt like I would wake up screaming in bed at any moment, but no such miracle happened no matter how much I blinked.\u2026Mother would be fine. She was okay. This wasn\u2019t anybody else, it was \u2018Mother.\u2019I fell asleep whenever the liquid on the floor drained away and woke up every time the cold river water entered my mouth.Finally, the ichthyosaur\u2019s digestion stopped. The warmth of the viscera suddenly cooled down and the elastic stomach lining gradually solidified. Thus, I could be sure.He died.[\u2026You are really great.]A bright light in the darkness. Bihyung\u2019s dim figure was floating in the air.[Using the stone hog\u2019s thorn like this. I never even thought about it. Constellations, isn\u2019t it the same for you?]Bihyung looked at the stone hog\u2019s thorn emitting a faint light.[The stone hog is a guy who mainly lives on the coast and feeds on small sea species. They insert the thorn into the skin of the prey but I didn\u2019t think it would be used to plug up the openings for the digestive juices\u2026]Bihyung\u2019s shining eyes weren\u2019t looking at me. The words weren\u2019t an explanation for me either.[A few constellations are smiling as if they already know.][The constellations have sponsored you 100 coins.][A few constellations belatedly understand your judgment.][The constellations complain that you should tell them by talking to yourself from now on.]I ignored the messages from the constellations and drank the last of the condensed fluid.[Your stamina has slightly increased due to absorbing the power of the ichthyosaur.][Your stamina level has risen!][Stamina Lv. 11 -> Stamina Lv. 12]I accomplished my intended purpose. Bihyung came down to me and looked at my burnt arm.[Furthermore, the mucus\u2026I didn\u2019t know the mucus of the hammer sea horse was so potent.]Originally, my skin should\u2019ve melted from the ichthyosaur\u2019s digestive juices. I opened my mouth to stop Bihyung\u2019s nonsense.\u201cThe mucus of the hammer sea horse is immune to digestive fluids. They evolved in this way after often being eaten by the ichthyosaurs.\u201d[A few constellations admire your knowledge.]Then Bihyung looked at me with a betrayed expression.[Excuse me, I should be the one explaining\u2026]\u201cI did it because you don\u2019t know. Now is the explanation over?\u201d[\u2026Yes.]\u201cThen give me the reward.\u201d[Cheeky bastard.]Bihyung grumbled while at the same time, a reward message appeared in front of my eyes.[The hidden scenario has ended.][You have obtained 9,000 coins in compensation.][You are the first to have successfully hunted a grade 7 species.][You have earned 1,000 coins as an achievement reward.9,000 coins plus an additional 1,000 coins. It was a very huge income.[Coins Possessed: 14,800 C]If I added the 500 donated coins from filming my survival, the total income was 10,500 coins.\u00a0 It was over my target.[Haha, Constellations. Did you see it well? Let\u2019s quickly watch an advertisement before going straight to the next scenario!]I could hear the faint sounds of an ad somewhere.New scenario opening featured package, 8,800 coins\u2026Once the eyes of the constellations disappeared, Bihyung started speaking to me in a friendly manner.[Sigh\u2026it was a great survival. The response from the constellations was amazing.]\u201cHow much time passed?\u201d[Four days. I was in suspense the whole time I was watching. Were you unaware of the time?]\u201cMy smartphone died.\u201dIt took more time than I thought. The original goal was two days\u2026 Well, Yoo Jonghyuk took four days in the fourth round to catch this so the speed wasn\u2019t slow.Anyway, I did it.A pleasant feeling of fulfilment covered my whole body and made me confident. I was an ordinary person with ordinary skills. But even so, this didn\u2019t mean I could only do ordinary things.\u201c\u2026How funny.\u201dIt was strange. A novel that hadn\u2019t been helpful for 28 years was now making me extraordinary.[Oh, you are already talking to yourself?]\u201c\u2026\u201d[Isn\u2019t it good? For an incarnation, talking to yourself is essential. Of course, there are constellations who dislike it but usually\u2026]\u201cShut up and open the Dokkaebi Bag.\u201d[Why? Are you going to buy something?]\u201cI\u2019m not buying but selling.\u201d[Damn, I\u2019ll have to cut the ad short. Constellations, hold on a second. I\u2019ll adjust the volume.]As Bihyung opened the Dokkaebi Bag, I looked at the thorns embedded in the wall.The upper barrier was hardened and deep cracks formed around the thorns. I could now smash through the upper barrier with my strength.I broke the wall little by little with the one remaining thorn. Shortly afterwards, I encountered the core of the ichthyosaur that was glowing blue.[Ichthyosaur\u2019s Core]It was an ether core found in monster species grade 7 or higher. I could raise my magic power level without coins if I ingested them. It was good quality because it was a sea commander grade ichthyosaur.I carefully cut at the flesh around the core while Bihyung looked at me with a dumbfounded expression.\u201cI\u2019ll sell this.\u201d[You really\u2026]\u201cOf course, I don\u2019t mean to sell it to you. I\u2019ll put it on the dokkaebi auction.\u201dBihyung accepted it like he was tired of asking me anything.[Sigh\u2026do what you want. How much are you going to charge?]\u201cI won\u2019t sell it for coins. I\u2019ll sell it by barter.\u201d[Damn, you know all sorts of things.]Bihyung grumbled while uploaded the item to the dokkaebi auction. His desires were simple. This guy might listen better than I thought.\u201cSomeone will show up to buy it. And the item exchanged must be \u2018Broken Faith.\u2019\u201d[Broken Faith? There is a person with it\u2026in any case, it is registered.]\u201cYes. And I will buy this\u2026\u201dI saw White Pure Star Energy in the shopping cart. Indeed, nobody bought it yet. Most constellations weren\u2019t well aware of the value of coin items. The expensive items in the Dokkaebi Bag weren\u2019t unconditionally good.[Wait a minute, can I talk to you for a moment?]At Bihyung\u2019s words, the advertising volume increased again.[The constellations are complaining about the long advertisement.]Once I saw that one more advertisement had appeared, I had a hunch about what Bihyung wanted to say.\u201cIs it the contract?\u201dAdvertising was the only way to hide the eyes and ears of the constellations without turning off the broadcast. From now on, it wasn\u2019t a story for the constellations.[Yes. I wasn\u2019t certain but I became convinced after this scenario. Well\u2026let\u2019s try it once. I can help you a little bit.]\u201cWon\u2019t this violate the streamer\u2019s pledge?\u201d[Ah, of course, I can\u2019t really help you. I\u2019m just saying that. Will you sign the contract?]\u201cWhat are the conditions?\u201d[Take a look.]The dokkaebi pulled out an extravagant contract that had been prepared.I read the contract that emerged as a transparent window in the air.\u2014\u2013[Stream Contract Agreement]\u2014\u2013\u201c\u2026 I am the gap?\u201d[Haha, don\u2019t humans like this? It doesn\u2019t mean anything. Keep reading.]\u2014\u2013\u2014\u2013This was also as expected.\u2014\u2013\u2014\u2013I read the contract carefully to the last item. I thought he might play an unknown joke but I didn\u2019t see that part.Except for one thing.\u201cThere is the most important part.\u201d[What do you mean? You can just say that you agree. The stream contract is a soul pledge\u2015]\u201cI\u2019m talking about the pay ratio.\u201d[A-Ahh. Haha. Right.]As if this bastard didn\u2019t know.This was the most important part.\u201cHow about 5:5? Instead, I\u2019ll get rid of my channel fee. Ah, do you know how to calculate it? I will accurately divide your future donations in this ratio. For example, if you get 100 coins, you will receive 50 coins and I will receive 50 coins.]All stream contracts were like this. The constellations had incarnations appear on the dokkaebi\u2019s channel and the contributions received from other constellations would be divided by a percentage. This was normal.\u201cAre you taking me for a pushover? I won\u2019t accept.\u201d[What? B-But this is the industry\u2019s default settlement ratio\u2026]\u201cI\u2019m an incarnation without a sponsor. When donating to an incarnation without a sponsor, the constellations must pay a huge fee to the dokkaebi. Haven\u2019t you already enjoyed a lot thanks to me?\u201dBihyung\u2019s jaw slowly dropped open. But there was no point making that expression.\u201c10:0. You will only get the commission. I won\u2019t pay you a single penny.\u201d[What?! That is ridiculous\u2026h-how about 7:3?]The ratio changed greatly. But I wasn\u2019t going to concede.\u201c10:0.\u201d[What is this fucking bullshit? It is a ridiculous rate\u2015]\u201cThen don\u2019t accept. I will just go to another channel. \u2018Gildal\u2019 is doing well these days. I should ask him.\u201d[\u20268:2. I can\u2019t concede anymore.]\u201c10:0.\u201d[\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.]Bihyung\u2019s expression changed to a threatening one. He looked at my head like it would explode at any minute. But I knew. He would never give up the contract. My existence was his last chance.\u201cThe advertisement is coming to an end. Don\u2019t you see the constellations complaining?\u201dIn the end, Bihyung gave up.[Shit, I understand. Then will you sign the contract?]He surrendered easier than I thought. In fact, I was going to give up at 9:1.\u2026Maybe he earned more money than I expected. It was a bit disgusting.\u201cYes. And one more thing.\u201d[What? What now?]\u201cYou have to give a separate down payment. Give me 5,000 coins.\u201dBihyung\u2019s expression tightened.[Y-You really\u2026]I laughed. Why was a \u2018gap\u2019 a \u2018gap and why did humans dwell on it\u2026I would let that damn dokkaebi know.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[The stream contract is concluded.][You have received 5,000 coins as a down payment.]The advertisement finished and the constellations came back.

It was a sight that anyone would admire, but not Yoo Jonghyuk.\u300c It is starting. \u300dThe meteor shower was the precursor to the third main scenario starting. Now Seoul would be destroyed one by one according to the scenario.Yoo Jonghyuk looked up at the sky before bowing his head and looking at the Han River.The landscape around Dongho Bridge was quite desolate since the large group of ichthyosaurs had recently moved downstream.\u300c It was too much. \u300dIt had already been three days since Kim Dokja entered Han River. It might\u2019ve been too much to demand that he catch the ichthyosaur at the first level.\u300cIndeed, it would be hard for me to catch an ichthyosaur in three days. \u300dBut it would be impossible to take him if he couldn\u2019t do this much. If he couldn\u2019t even do this much, it would only hinder Yoo Jonghyuk.\u300c A prophet isn\u2019t a big deal. \u300dYoo Jonghyuk closed his eyes with disappointment. He would go on his own again. Without any companions.It wasn\u2019t a big deal.

I was still inside the ichthyosaur. I turned my head and saw the surprised Bihyung.\u201c\u2026I had a dream.\u201d[Ohu, are you trying to raise curiosity? It isn\u2019t bad?]I didn\u2019t mean to do such a thing but I didn\u2019t mind the misunderstanding.[A few constellations want you to move to a new place quickly.]I used 500 coins to buy the Ellain Forest\u2019s Vital Force to help me sleep. I thought it was too dangerous to move while exhausted.The Ellain Forest\u2019s Vital Force quickly recovered fatigue and wounds in exchange for two hours of sleep. In other words, it was an expensive item.\u201c\u2026I really want to go out.\u201dI talked to myself while stretching my body. The dream I just had was still clear. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a dream.Kwajijijik!I heard the sound of an electric current scattering and Bihyung disappeared without a word. Maybe he went to do his job.I sighed with relief.The stream contract with the dokkaebi. It was a gamble that I never would\u2019ve attempted if I hadn\u2019t known about Bihyung from Ways of Survival. But I did it with surprising calm. I never succeeded in any contracts in \u2018real life.\u2019[The exclusive skill, \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 is in use.]\u2026This was real. I inserted strength to my right hand holding the thorn. I really thought this world was reality.[A few constellations want you to act.]Well, there was no time to worry about it. I swung the thorn as hard as I could at the stomach wall that lost its elasticity. At the same time, there was the sound of something collapsed and water pouring out. I plunged into Han River.\u201cPuah!\u201dFortunately, I didn\u2019t see any other ichthyosaurs. Small seawater species approached with curiosity but no hostility was felt. Not all creatures would attack humans.Dongho Bridge was over there.I used a piece of the ichthyosaur corpse as a floatation device and made my way towards dry land.My skin was cold from the cold water but I couldn\u2019t worry about it. After 30 minutes of swimming, my hand reached land.[A few constellations are nervous looking at you.]Normally, danger would immediately come after this message popped up.[The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 is making an insidious smile.]It was a pity for the constellations but something bad wouldn\u2019t happen to me. It was because I already knew the dangers.[You have entered the region of the second main scenario.][The land in the scenario area is deeply polluted.][Be careful about your breathing and move underground as quickly as possible.]The message said this but in fact, I shouldn\u2019t be on the ground from the moment this scenario started.Why? Look at my skin now.[You have been exposed to poisonous fog.]The skin touched by the violet fog turned black.Kyahh!Once I followed the source of the fog with my eyes, I saw a monster making terrible cries.It was a massive monster over 30 metres big. This fog was the fart of the grade 7 monster, \u2018great poisonous rhinoceros.\u2019 The rhino snorted and confronted a monster in the fog, which seemed to be an insect king species based on the shadow.Kuaaaah\u2026The struggle in this new world wasn\u2019t just for humans. The monsters were also fighting for their homes.I moved while holding my breath as much as possible.They were grade 7 monsters like the ichthyosaur but I couldn\u2019t do with them right now. In the first place, I could kill the sea commander because I was prepared.[You have used the Ellain Monkey\u2019s Lungs.]The monkey\u2019s lungs was an item I bought in advance that could be used as a substitute for an air purifier for 20 minutes.[A few constellations admire your readiness!]The aboveground station, Oksu Station had already bee destroyed. The nearest underground station from here was \u2018Gumho Station.\u2019 Maybe the others had moved there.I moved quickly while avoided the small species that were eating the corpses. I only had 20 minutes, so I needed to move as quickly as possible while securing supplies.The first thing I needed was clothes. My outerwear was melted by the ichthyosaur\u2019s fluids so it was necessary. Of course, there were many of them all around but\u2026 I felt uncomfortable.\u2026It couldn\u2019t be helped. I searched some bodies and grabbed clothes that roughly fit. Then I headed to a nearby convenience store.I grabbed a few plastic bags and swept in food randomly. Food would be a valuable trading item after going underground.I filled three or four bags like this. It seemed that the colour of the monkey\u2019s lungs was becoming increasingly darker. There wasn\u2019t much time left.Then I heard someone\u2019s voice.\u201cHelp\u2026help me.\u201dThere was someone still alive? A young woman was lying down in a corner. The poisoning was progressing on the surface of the skin, but the toxic condition wasn\u2019t severe due to the mask she was wearing. Her jacket was half removed and a bit of her skirt was torn.\u201cAre you okay? Can you stand?\u201d\u201cUhhhh\u2026\u201dWas there such an extra in Ways of Survival? I wanted to take a closer look but I didn\u2019t have enough time. I picked up the woman and ran to Gumho Station.I turned and a side street appeared. Now the distance to Gumho Station was 100 metres in a straight line. I breathed in and started to run with all my strength. I could see the Exit 3 sign in the distance.\u2026.Closed. Then on the other side?There was a fire shutter down at every exit due to the disaster situation. I could break the shutter with his thorn but if I did it wrong, the people inside might be damaged.\u201cE-Exit 4\u2026\u201dUnexpectedly, the woman I was carrying was helpful. I ran towards Exit 4. Then I found a fire shutter that was rolling down. I placed the thorn in the gap of the shutter that was trying to close. Somebody yelled out.\u201cShit, what is this?\u201d\u201cOpen the door.\u201d\u201cN-No! You can\u2019t come in! Go away!\u201d\u201cThere is a wounded person.\u201d\u201cWe are already in a full state! We don\u2019t need any more people!\u201dIt was full of people? Strange. Was there such a development?\u201cI don\u2019t care about that.\u201dI used the thorn as a lever and lifted the shutter as hard as possible. Since I used the coins to increase my strength to level 10, I now had the strength of half a dozen adult males.\u201cUwaaaaack!\u201dThere was a loud sound and the people on the other side of the shutter became nervous.\u201cR-Run away!\u201dThe scared men escaped into the darkness of the underground passage. I entered the station safely, lowered the shutter and put the girl down on the floor.[You have entered the safety zone.]The poisonous fog didn\u2019t come down to the underground area. There was no possible scientific explanation. It was just because of the \u2018scenario.\u2019\u201cPut this in your mouth.\u201dI took off the woman\u2019s mask and handed over the monkey\u2019s lungs. It wouldn\u2019t completely cure her but it would have a neutralizing effect.\u201cUmm\u2026\u201dA faint groan emerged from the mouth of the woman. The woman who was abandoned.I suddenly wondered about her information. This woman, it was likely that she had died in the original development.A voice was heard as I was about to use Character List.\u201cThere he is!\u201dLight from a flashlight approached in the darkness. My eyes narrowed as I saw men holding metal pipes.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 frowns at the appearance of the uninvited people.]A big man in the middle opened his mouth. His body was well balanced so he must be a strong person.\u201cWho are you?\u201dAt this moment, I was strangely struck dumb. What should I say when this happened? I thought for a moment before speaking like Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d\u201c\u2026Kim Dokja? That is your name?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWho asked that? What is this bastard?\u201dIt was a more difficult question.\u201cU-Uh! That woman\u2026\u201dOne of the men found the woman beside me and shone the flashlight on her.\u2019\u201cWhat, isn\u2019t that woman from the marginalized group? Didn\u2019t you come back with her?\u201d\u201cT-That is\u2026\u201dThe man\u2019s flashlight moved in a harassing manner near the woman\u2019s waist.\u201c\u2026Ha, so it was like that. Cute guys. Why did you do that without Hyung-nim\u2019s permission?\u201d\u201cHehe. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, of course Cheolsoo hyung-nim should be first\u2026hehe, I was going to do that.\u201dCheolsoo? Cheolsoo. Was there a character by that name? I couldn\u2019t remember. He must be nothing, as opposed to how he looked.\u201cHey, hand that woman over to us\u2026huh? What is that?\u201dThe flashlight shone on the convenience store bags on the floor. It was okay to escape the crisis but the flow was turning out bad.\u201cLeave that as well. Then you can live.\u201dTo be exact, it wasn\u2019t good for these guys, not me.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is annoyed at these people.][The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is angry with the injustice occurring.][A bounty scenario has occurred at the request of the constellations!]+[Bounty Scenario \u2013 Remove the Interference]Category: SubDifficulty: FClear Conditions: The constellations feel great anger at the disruptors who are obstructing your rapid movements.

It must be the laziness of the authors to think that crimes such as rape or theft would occur indiscriminately in such a situation. If the real \u2018destruction\u2019 came, wouldn\u2019t humans act more rationally than they thought?\u201cIt looks like he won\u2019t give it. Hey, go ahead and kill him!\u201dThe answer was now right in front of me. I observed the men coming towards me, as well as the man watching from the rear.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 expects a fair judgment.]I once again realized it. The human imagination was clich\u00e9, yet real humans were more clich\u00e9 than the imagination.Hwiiik!The trajectory of the iron pipe moved in a funny manner through the air. It wasn\u2019t a strike with the intent to kill. In fact, it didn\u2019t hurt that much.\u201cI-If you don\u2019t run away then you really will die. Get lost!\u201dThe four men surrounded me. One was trembling but the others looked more relaxed than before. It was probably due to the advantage in numbers.\u201cWhat are these brats doing?\u201dWaaaah!\u00a0Along with the shout, one man rushed forward. It was clearly a defenseless posture. I moved the thorn.Puok!\u201cAaaaack! My leg! My leg!\u201d\u201cYou bastard!\u201d\u201cHit him together!\u201dThe agitated men rushed simultaneously but I wasn\u2019t afraid. Their strength level was just above 5. I endured the incoming attacks and silently stabbed the thorn.Tang!\u00a0Kaaang!Puok!\u00a0Puok!The men had their thighs successively pierced and fell to their knees with a scream. But I didn\u2019t kill them. It was because the scenario clear condition was to \u2018neutralize\u2019 them.[The constellations of the absolute good system nod at your judgment.][A few constellations laugh at your humanity.][The constellations have sponsored you 100 coins.]If I became a murderer, I might be able to attract the attention of the constellations for a while. However, it was only a while. Instantly raising the threshold of stimulation wasn\u2019t good in the long run.[There are three minutes to the end of the scenario.]Two minutes had passed. Time calculation was important in time attack scenarios.\u201cW-What the hell is this bastard? Why won\u2019t you die?\u201dAt this time, their leader who was watching the situation from the back came forward.\u201cYou are a fairly tough guy. Everyone back off. I will deal with him.\u201d\u201cCheolsoo hyung-nim! This guy seems to have a pretty strong sponsor!\u201d\u201cGood. It looks like he has a lot of coins.\u201dKnuckles shining with a black gloss. They weren\u2019t ordinary iron knuckles. Did he receive it from his sponsor?Crunch.There was the relaxed sound of bones cracking from the knuckled hands.[The character \u2018Cheolsoo\u2019 has used Threaten.][Threaten doesn\u2019t work because the overall capabilities gap is too big.]\u201cHoh, aren\u2019t you quite good? You aren\u2019t getting scared at all.\u201dThe man\u2019s fist moved before he finished talking. The attack was aimed exactly at my jaw. I quickly stepped back. That guy smiled.\u201cAren\u2019t you quite good? Do you exercise?\u201dEven if I didn\u2019t have a footwork skill, anyone could do this if their agility exceeded level 10. Since I previously invested most of my remaining coins after buying items, the total sum of my body stats now reached 33.Should I look at this guy?[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.][Character Information]Name: Bang Cheolsoo.Age: 34 years old.Constellation Sponsor: Monarch of the Small Fries.Private Attribute: Assault Force Captain (General)Exclusive skills: Dogfight Lv. 2, Bluff Lv. 2.Stigmata: [Threaten Lv.1]Overall Stats: Stamina Lv. 6, Strength Lv. 7, Agility Lv. 6, Magic Power Lv. 2.Overall Evaluation: A common small fry who was lucky to obtain a sponsor. He has a tendency to overstate his abilities compared to his actual combat strength.Ah\u2026right. Now I remembered.\u201cBang Cheolsoo of the Cheoldoo Group.\u201d\u201cWhat, you know me?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see?\u201dMy memory was dim because he disappeared like the wind at the beginning of the work, but I fuzzily recalled there was a character called Bang Cheolsoo.He was the stupidest guy in the group at Gumho Station.As far as I knew, these guys should\u2019ve been killed by Yoo Jonghyuk. Why were they still alive?\u201cOhu, perhaps you are of \u2018that\u2019 category? You must\u2019ve killed people. Isn\u2019t that right? Yes, I feel that we are somewhat alike.\u201d[The character \u2018Bang Cheolsoo\u2019 has used Bluff.]Bluff. It was a skill that anyone who was a thug possessed. It was a good debuff that could weaken the opponent\u2019s attack power, but this case was different.[Fourth Wall has blocked the bluff of the character Bang Cheolsoo.][The confidence of the character Bang Cheolsoo is rapidly falling.]\u201cAre you ignoring me? You really want to die.\u201dBang Cheolsoo took a threatening Greco-Roman wrestling posture and rushed towards me. But that was only a bluff. It was because he didn\u2019t have the \u2018wrestling\u2019 skill.\u201cStop beating around the bush and come on.\u201d\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201dThe key skill that Bang Cheolsoo had was Dogfight Lv. 2. His combat power was insignificant unless he got into a melee.\u201cDie!\u201dThe agility difference was so high that his attacks rarely hit me. I looked at him with a bit of sympathy.Not all constellations had a desire to raise their incarnations as the \u2018protagonist\u2019 of the scenario.For example, his constellation \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries\u2019 was famous for being thrifty with his incarnations. A masochist who enjoyed using idiots as his incarnation, enjoying watching them be crushed by other incarnations.That was the \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries.\u2019[The constellation \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries\u2019 is delighted.][The constellation \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries\u2019 has sponsored you 100 coins.]Despite his incarnation being smashed, he was supporting the enemy. Originally, I was thinking about ending the time attack in one blow but now the story was a bit different.[There are two minutes to the end of the sub scenario.]Then I should make the most of the remaining time.\u201cYou rat bastard!\u201dAll of his lines were in the style of the Monarch of the Small Fries. How pitiful.Peeok!\u201cHaha! I hit you!\u201dHis attack luckily hit but there was little damage. The spot where I was hit just stung a bit.\u201cHow?\u201dHow? My stamina was Lv. 12. His strength was only Lv. 7. The difference in the overall stats gap created a huge combat power gap.\u201cIs it my turn now?\u201dI touched the cheek of the stupefied Bang Cheolsoo before hitting it as hard as I could. A few teeth flew out as Bang Cheolsoo screamed. I didn\u2019t hesitate and pierced his arm precisely with the thorn.\u201cAaaagh!\u201dI fixed one of his arms to the wall with the thorn and started the indiscriminate assault. I chose the areas that were the most painful without knocking him out, such as the back, thigh, femur and side.[The constellation \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries\u2019 is delighted.][The constellation \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries\u2019 has requested an extension of the sub scenario time.][The sub scenario is extended by one minute.]I also paid attention to the parts where the woman had been injured.\u201cCough! Kuheok! Kuheeok!\u201dBlood and flesh were scattered. Broken teeth fell to the ground and the broken bones twisted abnormally. However, I didn\u2019t stop kicking.\u201cS-Stop! Please! Let Hyung-nim go!\u201dThe men standing to the side exclaimed with panic. I looked over at them once in a while. Then he looked at the half naked woman lying on the ground.Humans were weak. How could such weak humans do such cruel things? They used the excuse of the world being destroyed. They killed, raped women and stole from others.Was it because of instincts?I was suddenly curious as I saw Bang Cheolsoo\u2019s eyes stained with fear in front of a stronger violence?\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201dIt was a question out of nowhere. In fact, I didn\u2019t expect an answer to this question. But the moment I was about to kick him again, Bang Cheolsoo opened his eyes.\u201cFuck\u2026just kill me you son of a bitch.\u201dThe moment I saw his eyes, I knew he had answered my question in his own way. A look that didn\u2019t show any lingering attachment to life. Yes. It wasn\u2019t because of instincts.Bang Cheolsoo talked in a voice that was subsiding.\u201cDog, this dog-like world\u2026\u201dThis guy was a human who had been despairing long before this world was destroyed. Just like me.[There are 10 seconds left to the end of the sub scenario.]I didn\u2019t delay any further and gave a strong kick to his neck.The breath was knocked out of him and Bang Cheolsoo finally fainted.[You have met the conditions to clear the sub scenario.][You have earned 300 coins.]I hope all of you are happy.[The constellation \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries\u2019 is satisfied and has sponsored you 100 coins.]The other men crawled and approached me one by one.\u201cH-How cruel\u2026\u201dThey looked at Bang Cheolsoo, who had been turned into a rag, and then up at me with fear. It was like they were dogs waiting to be disposed of at a slaughterhouse.I picked up the collapsed woman and the convenience store bags. In any case, the world had been destroyed and I had to live a new life.\u201cTake me to where the group is.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Gumho Station was originally a place that would grow into the region\u2019s base after it was organized by Yoo Jonghyuk.In his first regression, Yoo Jonghyuk broke through the second main scenario with the Gumho Station group, allowing the people of the group to occupy a place in the new era.But that was the first story. By the third round of regression, Yoo Jonghyuk was different.The 3rd turn Yoo Jonghyuk was a monster who monopolized everything.\u201c\u2026Even so, he was someone who would do the basic clean up.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThe man guiding me was surprised.\u201cI\u2019m just talking to myself. It is a habit.\u201d[The constellation Secretive Plotter likes your monologues.]\u201cYes\u2026anyway, this way.\u201dThe men of the Cheoldoo Group, who were supporting each other, stopped moving. We descended to the bottom of the dark platform and found a place where there was still light.I heard the buzzing sound of people as we went down the stairs.\u201cThe Cheoldoo Group! People are hurt!\u201dSome people rushed over to support Bang Cheolsoo\u2019s group. There was more of a system then I thought since people were moving in an orderly fashion.In the meantime, I saw familiar faces run over.\u201cOh my god. Dokja-ssi! Dokja-ssi!\u201dFortunately, it looks like nothing happened.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad. Really, I\u2019m really glad!\u201dYoo Sangah stood in front of me with a happy expression. I was startled and asked for an awkward handshake. There were a lot of scrapes on the back of Yoo Sangah\u2019s hand, showing she had suffered quite a hard time in the past four days.I heard a sound and something became attached to my leg.\u201cYou\u2019re alive.\u201dIt was Lee Gilyoung. I stroked the boy\u2019s head.\u201cHave you been well?\u201dLee Gilyoung nodded. He must be hungry since his cheeks were really thin. I pulled out a chocolate bar from the bag and placed it in Lee Gilyoung\u2019s hand.\u201cI knew you were alive, Dokja-ssi. Hah\u2026\u201dFinally, I looked at Lee Hyunsung. The muscles of his upper half seemed to have become more solid. Maybe Lee Hyunsung had protected these two.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. At that time, I left Dojka-ssi\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was an unavoidable situation.\u201d\u201cPhew, I\u2019m glad that Yoo Jonghyuk-ssi was right.\u201d\u2026Yoo Jonghyuk? Why was that name heard here?Lee Hyunsung noticed after a moment and said.\u201cThat, Yoo Jonghyuk said that Dokja-ssi was probably alive\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Where is Yoo Jonghyuk now?\u201d\u201cHe isn\u2019t here now.\u201dNot here?\u201cYoo Jonghyuk-ssi left the station yesterday. So\u2026\u201dI could determine many things before Lee Hyunsung finished speaking. I see. It was truly like that. He was a person in a rush.\u201cThat reminds me, there is one more person.\u201d\u201cAh, the department head.\u201dYoo Sangah didn\u2019t finish speaking because a group of men suddenly intruded. But it was a good thing.\u201cEverybody, out of the way!\u201dI didn\u2019t have to hear the explanation to see what happened straight away. Three or four men armed with a hammer or pipe started to surround me. There was a familiar face among them.\u201cY-You\u2026!\u201dHan Myungoh abandoned me on the Even Bridge and now he looked like he had seen a ghost. Han Myungoh must\u2019ve joined this group.\u201cG-Get rid of that guy! He is a very bad person! He shouldn\u2019t be here!\u201dA thief was always the one who felt pins and needles. Han Myungoh started exclaiming wildly.However, I noticed that the other men looked at each other and didn\u2019t easily move. There was something weird. Han Myungoh was placed in the centre yet they didn\u2019t listen to him?\u201cHaha, Han hyung. Everyone should get along so why don\u2019t you stop?\u201d\u201cAh, t-that\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are a new person.\u201dThe men split apart to the sides and a path was formed. A slim man appeared among them. I could tell just by looking in his eyes. This guy had a sponsor.\u201cNice to meet you. Can I ask what your name is?\u201d\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi. I see. I am Cheon Inho.\u201dCheon Inho? It felt like a name I should remember. I inserted strength to the hand holding the thorn. It looked like this guy was the leader of the Cheoldoo Group. He lost half of his men to me so he came here to make trouble.\u201cI heard the story from those you came with. You fought a monster and saved my group members.\u201d\u2026What?\u201cEveryone, please gather! We have a brave new group member!\u201dAfter Cheon Inho\u2019s words, people started to turn this way one by one.It was at this time that I knew. It was impossible for the charisma of Han Myungoh to gather this much power. Cheon Inho was the real leader of this bunch.\u201cWah! It is food!\u201dHungry eyes fell on the convenience store bags. Then Cheon Inho spoke as if he had been waiting.\u201cHe delivered it exactly to us. He is a rare good person.\u201dThe words made all the eyes look at me like I was a savior. The mother holding the child and the elderly man who hurt his leg were looking at me earnestly.Cheon Inho\u2026I seemed to remember. Yes, there was this guy in the Gumho station group.[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 is excited.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn this ruined world, the real danger wasn\u2019t people like Bang Cheolsoo. Humans moving while feeling despair weren\u2019t the least bit dangerous to me.The really dangerous people were those who used the despair of others as a fertilizer for power. Just like this guy.\u201cWelcome to Gumho Station, Kim Dokja-ssi.\u201dCheon Inho were laughing deeply while gazing at me. He inwardly laughed while shaking my hand.Cheon Inho would never know.

In other words, it wasn\u2019t the best time to deal with him.For around half a day, I focused on grasping the situation of Gumho Station. It was Lee Hyunsung who mainly gave information.\u201cCurrently, there are 86 people in Gumho Station. Ah, I guess it is 87 people now with Dokja-ssi.\u201d\u201cIt is less than I thought.\u201d\u201cYes. When the scenario broke out, only those near the station and those on the train survived. Everyone didn\u2019t say it but perhaps in the first scenario\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t need to be told the next words. I could see it from the expressions of the people. Those who survived had trampled on someone\u2019s life. All the humans here were murderers.\u201cCurrently, Gumho Station is divided into two groups. Strictly speaking, it is one group and the rest.\u201dLee Hyunsung looked at the people with a dark expression. There were men armed with iron pipes or other instruments. It was clear which was the faction in power.\u201cBelieve in me! The group president is working hard and everyone will soon be rescued.\u201dThe youngest son of Hankyung Group, Han Myungoh.\u201cHyung-nim is right, everyone. Don\u2019t lose hope. We will be able to led.\u201dThe one who embraced Han Myungoh and practically led the group was Cheon Inho. They were the \u2018mainstream group.\u2019\u201cMother, I\u2019m bored\u2026can\u2019t I play a game on the phone?\u201d\u201cHold on for a moment. The rescue team will come soon.\u201d\u201cThe government will act. It isn\u2019t that easy to collapse a country.\u201dAnd the people who were protected by the mainstream group and wanted to get on with their lives were the \u2018marginalized group.\u2019Their will was too weak to be killers. Even if 100 murderers were gathered together, they would be divided between the weak and the strong. Maybe they were thinking that they weren\u2019t murderers. They all believed it was unavoidable.Lee Hyunsung watched the mainstream group inciting the people and said.\u201cFood distribution is determined by the mainstream group. Convenience stores and restaurants in the region have already been robbed\u2026the foods that can be eaten right now are almost gone.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cIt is the reason why some people from the mainstream group were sent above ground for food exploration. Heewon-ssi, who you brought in, went with them\u201d\u201cHeewon-ssi\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh, it is the name of the woman who Dokja-ssi saved.\u201dI looked at the woman who lay on the subway bench. Under the bright light, her beauty could be seen. Her raised cheeks and gentle features meant she must\u2019ve often heard she was attractive. Thanks to the monkey\u2019s lungs, her colour was much brighter than it was this morning.\u201cIs Heewon-ssi the only one who didn\u2019t come back?\u201d\u201cNo. In fact, a few more people went out this morning but only those from the marginalized group didn\u2019t return.\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t come back?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLee Hyunsung\u2019s expression became sad again. He thought he roughly knew what happened.I grabbed Lee Hyunsung\u2019s shoulder. I knew for sure after actually touching him. He truly was the steel sword. His strength would soon exceed level 10.\u201cW-Why are you\u2026?\u201d\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi should\u2019ve received a love call but you didn\u2019t accept.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201dObjectively, Lee Hyunsung\u2019s combat power was higher than Bang Cheolsoo. There was no way Cheon Inho wouldn\u2019t aim for him.\u201cI can\u2019t explain it but I thought I shouldn\u2019t accept. I don\u2019t know much about morals or ethics but\u2026\u201dLee Hyunsung scratched his head like he was embarrassed.\u201cI felt that something wasn\u2019t right.\u201dNot right\u2026 It wasn\u2019t an answer but I felt it was true. Indeed, Lee Hyunsung was Lee Hyunsung.\u201cDon\u2019t forget this heart.\u201dThat way, I could continue to believe in him.I heard a cute sound from somewhere and looked back, seeing Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung looking up at me. Their faces were like baby birds waiting for the mother bird, making me laugh.\u201cThat reminds me, it is already evening. Aren\u2019t you hungry? Take this one by one.\u201dI handed over the food from the convenience store one by one.\u201cAh. Really? Can I?\u201d\u201cThis time is free. But next time, you should pay for it.\u201d\u201cHuh? H-How much\u2026?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you all have coins? It is 10 coins for one.\u201d\u201cT-That\u2026\u201dConfusion filled the faces of Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung. They looked like they hadn\u2019t expected my words.\u201cOf course. I will pay right now. I don\u2019t need freebies.\u201dSurprisingly, the one who spoke was the woman who had been lying on the bench. She had regained consciousness.\u201cI am Jung Heewon. Thank you for your help this morning.\u201d\u201cIt is nothing.\u201dI thought it was just a cute mask but I could see that it was a prejudice.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, Lee Hyunsung-ssi. Everyone, please wake up. It isn\u2019t the time to be making this look. This food, he obtained it by risking his life. Do you expect to get it for free?\u201dThere was almost no expression on the face that spoke without hesitation.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Yoo Sangah turned red like she had woken up. \u201cI was too short-sighted, I\u2019m sorry. Of course we should pay\u2026it is right. I don\u2019t like freebies either. I hate depending on other people.\u201d\u201cI also agree with Yoo Sangah-ssi. I will pay coins from now on.\u201dI was a little surprised by the unexpected reaction. Indeed, just because it was an apocalypse didn\u2019t mean there was only one type of person.\u201cIf you insist\u2026I understand. Does everyone know how to exchange coins?\u201d\u201cYes. I learned a few days ago. Touch each other\u2019s index finger, um, and\u2026\u201d\u201cJust state how many coins you want to exchange.\u201dStarting from Jung Heewon, Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung paid 10 coins in exchange for food. It was fortunate that their resistance wasn\u2019t bigger than what I thought.I didn\u2019t do this in order to get a few coins. At first, this judgment might seem harsh but people would soon realize this choice was right.[\u2019Lee Gilyoung\u2019 has paid you 20 coins.]\u201cHuh? You gave me more than 10 coins?\u201d\u201cIt is the price for the chocolate bar during the day.\u201dLee Gilyoung\u2019s expression while speaking was quite good. Maybe the fastest to adapt to a new world wasn\u2019t an adult but a child. It was easier for children to break common sense.\u201cWill Dokja-ssi keep staying with us?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t Lee Hyunsung who called out to me. I looked back and saw Cheon Inho from the mainstream group. Yes, I thought he would be back soon.\u201cCan I talk with you for a while?\u201dBang Cheolsoo was missing some teeth and glaring at me from behind Cheon Inho. He stared at me before turning his head away. A foolish fellow.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s talk.\u201dI nodded and Cheon Inho spoke with a satisfied expression.\u201cThen can the rest of you vacate this place for a moment? I want to talk to Dokja-ssi alone.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to go. You can listen.\u201dCheon Inho\u2019s eyes twitched at my words. Lee Hyunsung stopped as he was about to retreat.\u201cHmmm, is that so? Well\u2026I don\u2019t care.\u201dHe acted like they were free to listen. Cheon Inho wiped the bench and sat down. Men from the Cheoldoo Group appeared on both sides of him and handed him a cigarette and lighter. He had seen too many movies.\u201cYou seem to have a nature that dislikes cumbersome things, so I will get to the point.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cJoin our group.\u201dIt was an expected offer.\u201cI can offer Dokja-ssi a high position in our group. I want to lead the group together with you.\u201d\u201cWhy me?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t you know why?\u201dCheon Inho glanced towards the injured Cheoldoo Group members.\u201cDokja-ssi is a hero who saved people from monsters. A hero needs such a place.\u201dIt was an interesting way of thinking. He would take advantage of my presence.\u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d\u201cRefuse? How interesting. I never thought about that.\u201d Cheon Inho blew out cigarette smoke towards me. \u201cDokja-ssi, this isn\u2019t a favour. You have a duty to do this. Can\u2019t you see the poor people here?\u201dPeople were looking this way with scruffy faces. There were crying children and tired elderly people.\u201cIt isn\u2019t a big story. I am asking you to work together for survival. Dokja-ssi, don\u2019t you have the strength?\u201d\u201cWhat exactly do you want?\u201d\u201cI need someone to be a hitman.\u201dHitman?\u201cUntil a few days ago, there was someone else doing the job. He procured food alone and hunted in the tunnels. To be exact, we took it one-sidedly.\u201dI didn\u2019t need to ask.This was the story of Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201cBut he suddenly left last night.\u201d\u201cSo you need someone to replace him?\u201d\u201cI think your strength is proven with Cheolsoo-ssi.\u201dLee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes widened. Now they noticed what was going on.\u201cIt isn\u2019t bad for Dokja-ssi. You are the hero of the people and will be the leader of the group with us. Everyone will like you and also\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t be responsible for anyone. I don\u2019t want to join your group.\u201d\u201cHrmm. Is that so?\u201d\u201cAbove all, the way you run the group doesn\u2019t fit me.\u201dI looked at the health members of the Cheoldoo Group and the sickly-looking members of the marginalized group. In particular, Jung Heewon was looking at the Cheon Inho as if he was her mortal enemy.\u201cIs that so? It is fine. But if you change your mind, come back anytime.\u201d\u201cThat will not happen.\u201d\u201cHaha, it remains to be seen.\u201dIt didn\u2019t take long to find out what Cheon Inho\u2019s words meant.As the members of the Cheoldoo Group retreated, the other group members approached as if they had been waiting. It was the people of the marginalized group. They grabbed me and raised their voices.\u201cHey, is the rumour true?\u201d\u201cAre you really monopolizing the food?\u201d\u201cAre you going to eat it all when there is enough to share with everyone?\u201d\u201cWe are all staying here! Why are you the only one to have it?\u201d\u201cLeave the food to Inho-ssi! He will distribute it fairly!\u201dI knew what was going on. I could see the smiling face of Cheon Inho in the rear of the people. His lips were moving.\u2018Choose.\u2019Would I give food and become the hero? Or would I be the villain and monopolize it alone?If I chose to be the hero, I would fall into Cheon Inho\u2019s game. After the food was distributed, I would have to hunt for food with the group members and would someday get stabbed in the back.On the other hand, I would be isolated in a group in a moment if I monopolized the food alone.[The eyes of a few constellations are shining.][The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 has snorted.]As the people became heated up, Cheon Inho came forward.\u201cAhh, everyone. Calm down. There seems to be a misunderstanding. Kim Dokja-ssi isn\u2019t such a person.\u201dWhat was this? A decoy?\u201cKim Dokja-ssi decided to work with us. The food he brought today will be left to the mainstream group and will be shared fairly. He also promised to continue to work with us\u2015\u201dOf course, he believed I would choose him. It was hard to listen anymore.\u201cStop.\u201dI worried about it for a short moment. What would Yoo Jonghyuk do? Ah, that\u2019s it. The answer was that he wasn\u2019t here right now.But I wasn\u2019t Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201cOf course I will give out food.\u201d I saw Cheon Inho\u2019s lips curve upwards. But people should listen to the end. \u201cHowever, it isn\u2019t for free.\u201dUnlike Yoo Jonghyuk, I wouldn\u2019t throw everything away to move forward. But I wouldn\u2019t be responsible for everyone. Food was given but it wouldn\u2019t be for free.People were puzzled as if they didn\u2019t understand the words.\u201cW-Wait a minute! It isn\u2019t free?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you. I don\u2019t intend to monopolize the food. But I won\u2019t give food to Cheon Inho\u2019s group. I\u2019m not UNICEF and I don\u2019t trust them.\u201dI smiled at Cheon Inho.\u201cI will make a deal with you. I will sell you the food for a fair price.\u201d\u201cS-Sell?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\u201cUh, how much\u2026money?\u201dIn the distance, I could see Cheon Inho\u2019s face stiffening. I laugh as I faced him.\u201cNo, I only accept coins.\u201d*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *After a while, only the people in the marginalized group with a relationship with me returned.\u201cThat\u2026D-Dokja-ssi. Is this a good choice?\u201d\u201cSheesh, is there anything free in life? Dokja-ssi, you said it well. I feel refreshed.\u201dJung Heewon dismissed Lee Hyunsung\u2019s concern. After I made the \u2018trade\u2019 declaration, many citizens turned away from me. Maybe they were disappointed.\u201cI agree with Heewon-ssi. The people here are too tame to the mainstream group.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The sons of bitches\u2026Gumho Station is currently in their palms. People are treated as cattle and are sometimes taken to a slaughterhouse. Just like myself this morning.\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s body trembled.In fact, it wasn\u2019t me but the mainstream group monopolizing the food. They monopolized the food on the pretext of \u2018fair distribution\u2019 and feed it to the tamed people.Humans were the weakest when they believed someone protected them. Once authority was established in a one-sided relationship, people started to depend on them.\u201cI agree. That\u2019s why I believe that Dokja-ssi\u2019s declaration today was very meaningful. People need to have the will to do something on their own. However\u2026\u201dLee Hyunsung looked towards the food.\u201cNot even one was sold. 50 coins for one, isn\u2019t this price too expensive? Why don\u2019t you make it 10 coins like you did with us\u2026?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t unreasonable to think so. People only paid attention to the mainstream group and showed no signs of looking this way. People still needed time.I responded calmly.\u201cLet\u2019s wait a little longer.\u201dThen night came.The sound of huge monsters was heard intermittently from the ground and people often had nightmares. Lee Gilyoung and Yoo Sangah fell asleep first while Jung Heewon was dozing off.\u201cDokja-ssi should sleep as well. I will stand vigil.\u201d\u201cNope. It is okay. Lee Hyunsung-ssi can sleep first.\u201d\u201cBut you will be tired.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI have work to do.\u201d\u201cWork to do?\u201dI pointed behind Lee Hyunsung. Surprisingly, there were the shadows of people. It wasn\u2019t just one.\u201cThat\u2026are you still trading the food?\u201dFinally, the people started to move.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jung Heewon stared at the convenience store bags as if she couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cOh my god, it is sold out?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHa, really funny. Everyone was just watching and now\u2026\u201d\u201cNope, it isn\u2019t just the marginalized group.\u201dThe guests who came in the middle of the night weren\u2019t just members of the marginalized group.\u201cKim Dokja-ssi, you are making the worst choice.\u201dAmong them was Cheon Inho.\u201cYou will regret it.\u201dMore than half the food I had was taken by the mainstream group. Of course, they paid the exact amount.Jung Heewon was in a rage after hearing the story.\u201cWait a minute. Then the mainstream group will just monopolize the food again?\u201d\u201cSomething like that.\u201d\u201cNo, what is this? Weren\u2019t you going to weaken the power of the mainstream group by promoting transactions among the people?\u201dIt was unexpected insight. I responded with a bit of admiration.\u201cThat\u2019s correct. That was the intent. I wanted people to move voluntarily.\u201d\u201cThen why did you sell food to the mainstream group? The situation won\u2019t change!\u201d\u201cIt has changed. I have obtained coins.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dIt was 1,450 coins. It was a huge income for one night.\u201cNo\u2026what is Dokja-ssi thinking? Sangah-ssi, can we really trust this man?\u201dYoo Sangah flinched as attention suddenly turned to her but then she smiled brightly.\u201cI believe in him.\u201dIt was burdensome.\u201cDokja-ssi, did you leave enough food for yourself?\u201d\u201cNope, I sold it.\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s mouth fell open as if she was dumbfounded. At that time, someone poked my cheek. I turned my head and found a biscuit.\u201cHuh? You want me to eat it?\u201dNod nod.\u00a0The head moved cutely. I smiled, took the biscuit and put it in Lee Gilyoung\u2019s mouth.\u201cI\u2019m okay. You eat it. Ah, I should tell you something\u2026 everyone, do you still have the food you ate yesterday?\u201d\u201cYes, I have it.\u201d\u201cI have a bit left.\u201d\u201cWhy? Do you want to buy it back? I will sell it.\u201d Jung Heewon waved the biscuit in a playful manner.\u201cNo, you should eat it now.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cEat it all before today. You should do it.\u201d I repeatedly stressed. \u201cOr you will regret it.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026no, wait a minute. Sangah-ssi, what are you doing now? Why are you listening to him?\u201d\u201cThere is a reason why Dokja-ssi would say this.\u201dYoo Sangah smiled sweetly and opened a bag of biscuits. Lee Hyunsung was confused but ate the food. Meanwhile, Lee Gilyoung had eaten it the moment I spoke. He was a good listener.\u201cAh well\u2026I will leave one back.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t stop you.\u201dI shrugged at Jung Heewon\u2019s words. It was up to her to regret it.At lunch time, there was a major announcement from the mainstream group. Cheon Inho stood on a platform surrounded by people and said.\u201cWe will limit the food ration from today. The allocation is three biscuits per person. And\u2015\u201dPeople became irritated before the speech was over.\u201cWhat? Three biscuits? How can we live on that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Don\u2019t the scouts get more food? Do you think we don\u2019t know?\u201dDespite being cursed at, Cheon Inho just laughed calmly.\u201cYour words are good. Yes. The scouts receive more rations. If you want food, please apply to be a scout.\u201d\u201cVery few people have come back after applying to be a scout! The Cheoldoo Group members are the ones who always come back!\u201d\u201cDo you want us to die now?\u201dCheon Inho was nonchalant despite the violence reactions of the citizens.\u201cThose people were just unlucky. You know that it is terribly dangerous outside. Why don\u2019t you obtain food yourself if you are dissatisfied?\u201d\u201cT-That\u2026\u201dThe people closed their mouths dumbly. If they went out now, they would die. Everyone knew this.Cheon Inho wasn\u2019t finished.\u201cAh, there is a way to get food without being a scout.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cA deal. We will be happy to exchange food for anything we determine to be of value. Every person can give something different. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dCheon Inho\u2019s cold gaze caused the people to tremble. It was mostly the people who came to me yesterday and bought food.[The character \u2018Cheon Inho\u2019 has activated the \u2018Incite Lv. 2\u2019 skill.\u201cOriginally, I wasn\u2019t going to do this. But yesterday, Kim Dokja-ssi told me something nice. That\u2019s right everyone. Is there anything free in the world? If you want food, you have to prove your worth. This is the way it is. Haha, thank you for telling me something good. Kim Dokja-ssi.\u201d\u2026Look at this?At this moment, everyone\u2019s attention was focused on me. Their eyes were mostly filled with resentment.\u201cBecause of that bastard\u2026\u201dPeople wanted to be stupid and Cheon Inho had the \u2018Incite\u2019 skill. It was a skill that most good group leaders would have. But this way, the hostility would turn towards me again\u2026I looked at the back of Cheon Inho. It was a cute level. At least compared to the people at Chungmuro and Seoul Station.The people gathered in front of the podium were already trying to bargain.\u201cI-I will buy it with coins. How much do you want?\u201d\u201c200 coins.\u201d\u201cHuh? But I don\u2019t have that many coins.\u201d\u201cThen go away.\u201d200 coins for one piece of food. Even the dokkaebi was likely to pass out.One of the Cheoldoo Group selling food saw my look and trembled. He had a bandage around his thigh and seemed to be one of the guys I beat up yesterday.\u201cDid I ever say thank you for yesterday?\u201dI suddenly turned my head and saw Jung Heewon standing nearby.\u201cI think I heard it.\u201d\u201cStill, I want to thank you again.\u201dI wanted to say something but Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes were fixed on the injured Cheoldoo member.\u201cThe one with the injured leg, he was the one who tried to rape me yesterday.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t touch him because I will kill him myself. Understood?\u201dHer killing intent was impressive. Was she chosen by a sponsor or was it a late blooming attribute?[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]I was a little worried about using this skill. This woman would\u2019ve died if I hadn\u2019t saved her. Would she be registered as a character?[Character Information]Name: Jung HeewonAge: 27 years old.Constellation Sponsor: None (Three constellations are currently showing interest in this person).Private Attribute: Crouching Figure (General)Exclusive skills: Demon Slayer Lv. 1, Kendo Lv. 1.Stigmata: NoneOverall Stats: Stamina Lv. 4, Strength Lv. 4, Agility Lv. 7, Magic Power Lv. 4.Overall Evaluation: She was a \u2018crouching figure\u2019 with enormous potential. The attribute information wasn\u2019t verified yet because the attribute hadn\u2019t blossomed.Fortunately, her information appeared. It was different from Yoo Sangah, Lee Gilyoung and Han Myungoh. Was she originally not abandoned? By the way, it was a very interesting exclusive attribute.\u2018Crouching figure.\u2019It didn\u2019t seem big based on the name, but it was one of the few \u2018super evolutionary\u2019 attributes in Ways of Destruction. \u2018Crouching Figure\u2019 was a general rated attribute, but it could reach a rare or legendary rating depending on the occasion.One of the 100 strongest people in Ways of Survival, the Crazy Butcher evolved from \u2018Crouching Figure.\u2019Jung Heewon I thought she was just a passing person but I might have to consider taking her as a colleague.It would take a while to grow her \u2018Demon Slaying\u2019 skill but this woman could become a powerful hitman if she was raised well.\u201cBy the way, Dokja-ssi is very calm.\u201dCalm\u2026 It might seem like that.\u201cI am familiar with situations like this in the novel.\u201d\u201cHuh? Does that make sense\u2026 Wait a minute. Where are you going?\u201dI didn\u2019t answer and descended from the platform. Jung Heewon wanted to come with me and I reached out a hand to stop her.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dJung Heewon landed lightly below the platform.I walked along the railway tracks and watched the tunnel road to Yaksu Station. It was filled with thick darkness and the inside wasn\u2019t visible, but it smelt terrible. It was a bloody smell.\u201cYou aren\u2019t going inside are you?\u201dJung Heewon asked.\u201cEveryone who went that way has died. The thugs or anyone else. Everyone who goes inside will unconditionally die.\u201dHer words were wrong. Not everyone died. At least one person had already gone down this road and moved onto the next station.We climbed onto the platform again. We had been gone for quite a time but the line of people to trade food was still long.Some people who protested against the mainstream group were beaten up and other paid unusual prices for the food.Shortly afterwards, Jung Heewon saw a few young women from the marginalized group sneak into the back of a tarp and she became furious.\u201cAh, really annoying. Did you see that?\u201d\u201cI saw it.\u201dCheon Inho had said it. \u2018Anything\u2019 could be exchanged for food. But the girls who just entered weren\u2019t carrying anything.Jung Heewon sprang to her feet.\u201cI can\u2019t just watch this.\u201d\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d\u201cStop it. I have to tell them not to do it, no matter the circumstances!\u201d\u201cThen those women will starve.\u201d\u201cAre you just going to watch?\u201d\u201cYes, I think you should just watch this time.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dI silently received Jung Heewon\u2019s contemptuous gaze.\u201cJung Heewon-ssi, stopping those women won\u2019t solve the current problem. Even if you stop them now, something similar will occur late at night.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then I will stop them again. I will stop it and stop it.\u201d\u201cThen what about their food? Among those who just entered the tarp, there is a mother with a child. If that child starves to death, will Jung Heewon-ssi be responsible for the child\u2019s death?\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s eyes shook. She bowed her head as if to hide her expression.\u201c\u2026Then what can I do? The alternative\u2026\u201dI looked up at Jung Heewon.With this, Jung Heewon wouldn\u2019t do anything unexpected. She was a \u2018Crouching Figure\u2019 with \u2018Demon Slaying.\u2019 Depending on how she acted, Jung Heewon might evolve into an indiscriminate murderer.\u201cJung Heewon-ssi, the key to this problem is food. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThen we need to remove the cause of the problem.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dI looked at my watch instead of answering. It was time.Kwajijijik!Yes, he showed up. The air split apart and a familiar figure was revealed. Screams came from everywhere. The nightmare of humanity that opened up this tragedy.[H-How are you all doing? Haven\u2019t you been free for a while?]The dokkaebi.\u201cA-Aaaagh!\u201dThe people panicked at the appearance of the dokkaebi. It was never a good thing when this guy showed up. Even Jung Heewon, who was full of energy, flinched momentarily.By the way, it wasn\u2019t Bihyung. Originally, Bihyung was the dokkaebi responsible for all nearby channels. But this guy was different. Unlike the pure white fur of Bihyung, this dokkaebi had black fur.[M-My friend who was originally in charge of this channel is undergoing disciplinary action\u2026 S-So, I am responsible for this scenario.]The dokkaebi\u2019s timid tone was very memorable.[T-Then everyone. D-Don\u2019t you look very peaceful? T-That Bihyung, he pretended to be pretentious only to set this level of scenario difficulty\u2026]\u201cW-What are you saying?

Aha\u2026if you want food\u2026]After his words ended, the dokkaebi moved his hand.[A scenario penalty has been added.][From now on, food stockpiling is limited.][All existing stockpiled food has disappeared.]\u201cU-Uhh! What?\u201dThe people with emergency food screamed. Whether it was from the mainstream group or marginalized group, everything that was called \u2018food\u2019 floated in the air.[He, hehe. Then everyone. You can\u2019t. Y-You have to think about how to break the scenario.]Susuk.The canned food, biscuits, calorie bars, etc. The emergency food gathered by the people were destroyed with one gesture from the dokkaebi. The people\u2019s expressions became grim when they saw the food disappearing.[Y-You want to eat? In any case, Earth trash\u2026]His tone suddenly changed. I seemed to remember his name. According to the original setting, there was one dokkaebi like this. His tone was timid but he was crueler than any dokkaebi.In the distance, Cheon Inho was watching me with confused eyes.[Everyone, let\u2019s have fun from now on. Hehe\u2026]It was followed by system messages.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[A scenario penalty has been added.][The \u2018survival cost\u2019 clause has been added.][From now on, 100 coins will be deducted every night for the \u2018survival cost\u2019.

Yihihihit!]The dokkaebi said these words and disappeared.A food penalty and survival penalty. I already knew about the former penalty. However, the latter wasn\u2019t in the original Ways of Survival. Maybe my contract with Bihyung caused this development.Jung Heewon confirmed that the biscuit in her pocket had disappeared and asked in a soft voice.\u201cDokja-ssi, did you perhaps know something like this would hap\u2015\u201d\u201cI did expect it. I thought about what the dokkaebis would do first to harass humans.\u201d\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you really good at making predictions?\u201dI called Lee Hyunsung and the others over. The situation was created and now it was time to move.\u201cGive back our food!\u201d\u201cHow, how did this happen?\u201dThe people of the marginalized group were crying. Cheon Inho and the mainstream group were also devastated by the sudden food shortage. My eyes met Cheon Inho\u2019s, who bit his lip.[Perhaps\u2026were you aware of it? No, that is impossible.]If I could read his thoughts then that\u2019s what he would be thinking.[You have accurately read the thoughts of character \u2018Cheon Inho.\u2019][Your understanding of the character \u2018Cheon Inho\u2019 has increased.]\u2026My understanding rose from this sort of thing?I looked at other people\u2019s expressions and tried to guess what they were thinking. But the previous messages didn\u2019t pop up.Meanwhile, Cheon Inho quickly gathered the people together in order to organize the chaos.\u201cEveryone, gather together. I will give you an emergency notice.\u201dThe contents of the notice were simple:The situation had become worse so more \u2018scouts\u2019 from the marginalized group was needed.\u00a0They had to hurry.\u00a0Now there was no food underground.\u201cWe won\u2019t distribute food to people who don\u2019t participate as scouts.\u201dDespite the hardline declaration, there was no backlash from the citizens. No, they couldn\u2019t. It was an inevitable result in this situation. The people noticed it and volunteered to be scouts one by one.Despite the disappearance of the food, hope remained on Cheon Inho\u2019s face. As the situation became worse, more control was passed onto the mainstream group.Lee Hyunsung became anxious when he saw this and opened his mouth.\u201cDokja-ssi, what now?\u201d\u201cOf course, we have to go and get food.\u201dThe expressions of the party members became tense at these words. Obtain food. This meant only one thing.\u201cThen we have to be scouts? There is still food remaining aboveground.\u201d\u201cNope, we won\u2019t go aboveground. If we go there, we will unconditionally die.\u201dI looked at a gas mask on the floor. This tattered gas mask couldn\u2019t stop the poisonous fog.\u201cBut we need to obtain food aboveground\u2026\u201d\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi. The world has changed. Then the food needs to change.\u201dI looked at the tunnel to Yaksu Station.\u201cWait a minute. Dokja-ssi\u2026don\u2019t tell me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dIn this world, humans were no longer the top predators. Even if we weren\u2019t predators, we didn\u2019t necessarily have to be prey.\u201cWe will hunt monsters.\u201d*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *After a while, several people from the marginalized group, including myself, were standing in front of the tunnel towards Yaksu Station.\u201cI see. You are going to enter the railway track?\u201dI thought Cheon Inho would challenge us when we refused to join the scouting group, but he seemed relieved that I was out of the group. He might think I was a threat to his own power.\u201cWell, looking at it in the long run, a team dedicated to attacking the scenario is required. Come back safely.\u201dHe was a funny guy. He spoke like he was the captain. But the time for him to be finished wasn\u2019t far off.[Your understanding of the character \u2018Cheon Inho\u2019 has increased.][Your understanding of the character \u2018Cheon Inho\u2019 has reached a certain level.]I see\u2026I got it now. There were two major cases of character \u2018understanding\u2019 rising.One was when I got the liking or trust of the character. The second was when I accurately guessed what the character was thinking. Maybe now was the latter case.[The character \u2018Cheon Inho\u2019 is suspicious of you.]According to the accumulated understanding value, a vague idea of the person\u2019s emotions could be obtained.\u201cOh, can one of my group members join? I\u2019d like to get some information on the attack.\u201dIndeed, Cheon Inho wouldn\u2019t let us go so easily. I stared at the man behind him. It was the person who would go with us and an unlucky fellow.\u201cI-I have to go with them?\u201d\u201cEh, why else are you here, Han hyung? Didn\u2019t you want to reconcile with Dokja-ssi last night?\u201d\u201cT-That\u2026\u201dCheon Inho\u2019s party member who joined us was Department Head Han Myungoh.\u201cD-Dokja-ssi.\u201d If you don\u2019t mind, I will go\u2026\u201d\u201cI understand. Let\u2019s go together.\u201dHan Myungoh was surprised when I responded readily. He thought I would refuse. Lee Hyunsung had a worried face but I had an idea.In any case, the survivors party of five people from Carriage 3807, consisting of me, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung, Yoo Sangah and Han Myungoh was reformed.\u201cCan I come as well?\u201d\u201c\u2026Is it okay even if your body isn\u2019t fully healed?\u201d\u201cThis much is fine.\u201dThere was one more. Including Jung Heewon, there was a total of six people in the party. It was a lot for a small number.Grrr\u2026Of course, the number of people wasn\u2019t much in front of the upcoming crisis.[A new sub scenario has arrived!]+[Second Scenario \u2013 Food Acquisition]Category: SubDifficulty: EClear Conditions: Directly hunt the monsters that can be used as food and cook them.Time Limit: NoneCompensation: 500 coinsFailure: ???+As soon as they stepped foot in the tunnel, a sub scenario flew in.Food acquisition. It was a sub scenario we had to go through before entering the second main scenario.[A few constellations are anticipating your performance.]The darkness of the tunnel became apparent before we even moved 10 steps. I lit up the tunnel with a flashlight but the outline of the surrounding area wasn\u2019t visible at all.It was proof of a curtain that was blocking the light. The real thing would be beyond this curtain.\u201cDokja-ssi, wait a minute. It is really dangerous from here on.\u201dJung Heewon, who walked beside me, stopped first.\u201cAre we really going this way? No matter how I look, it seems like suicide. There is also Gilyoung.\u201d\u201cIn fact, I was concerned from the beginning. It isn\u2019t too late so how about we leave Gilyoung behind? And if possible, the women\u2026\u201d\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi, I\u2019m not as good as you but I know how to fight. I took some kendo lessons.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dAn unnecessary controversy was about to heat up the atmosphere so I interrupted.\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi. I told you before. The world has changed. It is biased that a woman is physically weak. Right now, everyone can become stronger by raising their stats. But Jung Heewon-ssi, there is also a problem with your words.\u201d\u201c\u2026What is it?\u201d\u201cJust as a woman isn\u2019t weak, a child also isn\u2019t weak. Gilyoung, show them.\u201dLee Gilyoung came forward. He looked around for a while before sitting on the tunnel floor and reaching out his hand. Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cOh my god, what is that?\u201d\u201cS-Shit! Cockroaches!\u201dHan Myungoh cried out with fear.The cockroach that appeared in the distance was connected to Lee Gilyoung\u2019s fingertips with a faint solid line. The cockroach listened to Lee Gilyoung\u2019s words like a well-behaved dog and disappeared into the darkness.\u201cMy attribute is Insect Collector.\u201dInsect Collector. Lee Gilyoung possessed the rare ability to communicate simply with insects through his \u2018Diverse Communication\u2019 skill.\u201cThis is nothing in front of us. It is safe for 100 steps forward.\u201dLee Gilyoung showed an overwhelming scouting power and the other people made a stunned expression. Lee Gilyoung spoke to them with a bold expression.\u201cThank you for your concern. But I didn\u2019t follow all of you for you to take care of me.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dJung Heewon nodded with a sour expression. Lee Gilyoung came to my side and I stroked his hair.Lee Gilyoung\u2019s attribute hadn\u2019t been seen in the original Ways of Survival. It wasn\u2019t a wrong choice to save Lee Gilyoung in the beginning. We passed a clear barrier and entered the full-fledged darkness.[You have entered a dangerous area.]\u201cY-Yoo Sangah-ssi. It is dangerous to hold my hand while walking.\u201d\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you more afraid than I am?\u201d\u201cN-No!\u201dThe air inside the curtain was sticky from the humidity.\u201cReduce the light.\u201dYoo Sangah immediate covered the flashlight. Since this model didn\u2019t have a light control function, she had to adjust the light with her hand.\u201cOuch. Don\u2019t shine it downwards.\u201dJung Heewon felt nauseous when she checked the ground. There were torn bodies. The bodies of those who tried to move through here were arranged at their feet.Yoo Sangah closed her eyes tightly, Han Myungoh shook and even the bold Lee Hyunsung started sweating.Lee Gilyoung was surprisingly calm, with not the slightest bit of fear on his face. I felt a bit worried. This guy, did he think it was all a game?\u201cThere is something that isn\u2019t human.\u201dAs Lee Gilyoung said, it wasn\u2019t only the bodies of humans on the ground. There was something the size of a fully-grown wolf. The bodies of the mole-like creatures were scattered all over the place.The 9th grade underground species, the ground rat. It was a name reminiscent of bug on Earth, but a name was just a name.\u00a0 They were underground piranhas. The ground rats were persistent hunters who burrowed through the ground in groups and aimed at their prey.However, the ground rats collapsed like they had received a bombardment. Jung Heewon sighed.\u201c\u2026Who the hell did this?\u201dObviously, there was only one human who could turn the ground rats into this. Yoo Jonghyuk. He proceeded to the next station through this path alone.But I couldn\u2019t help wondering. Originally, it was supposed to be tonight or tomorrow when the third turn Yoo Jonghyuk moved to the next station.Why was he so hasty? Did he become impatient? What was the reason?\u201cDokja-ssi, can we use this for food?\u201d\u201cThe scenario said that we have to \u2018hunt\u2019 it ourselves so maybe it isn\u2019t possible.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, it is kind of uncomfortable. What about cooking? Do you want to bake it on a fire?\u201dIt could be baked. The problem was that it must be a special fire.\u201cHeewon-ssi, you said you were good at kendo?\u201d\u201cUh, it is a bit much to say I am good\u2026but what are you doing now?\u201dI stabbed the body of the ground rat and started to cut it with a knife. I didn\u2019t know when I read it in the novel but it didn\u2019t go as well as I thought.After somehow getting rid of the tough skin, I managed to remove the spine bones. This was the first time so I left many scratches, but it was useable.\u201cWhy are you taking that?\u201d\u201cYou need a weapon for kendo.\u201dThe stone hog\u2019s thorn wasn\u2019t enough but the spine of the ground rat consisted of a single bone, making it a pretty good weapon at the beginning of the scenario.After cutting the cartilage leading to the leg and shaping it, the bone actually took the shape of a knife. I gave it to Jung Heewon.\u201cThank you. Suddenly I feel like I\u2019m back to the Paleolithic age.\u201d\u201cYou need to grind it a bit more for it to be useful. There are rocks around so skillfully grind the blade.\u201cHuhu, understood. Captain.\u201dJung Heewon started to grind the blade with a slightly excited voice. I looked up and saw Lee Hyunsung watching the scene with a bit of envy.\u201cDo you want one?\u201d\u201cEh, you will make me one?\u201d\u201cAll of you come closer. It is better if you learn how to do it. Let\u2019s make it together.\u201dIn fact, this was also my first time trying it. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it if the details hadn\u2019t been included in Ways of Survival.Why wasn\u2019t Ways of Survival popular? It was simple. The author wrote too much of the setting.\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi, you are a beginner but you are good at it.\u201dWe sat down and made weapons together. This time it was a spear, not a sword. They didn\u2019t have the Kendo skill so I decided it was more stable to make a long spear.Lee Hyunsung\u2019s spear was made with the spine of the largest ground rat while Yoo Sangah and Han Myungoh\u2019s weapons were made with the spine of average sized ground rats. Finally, Lee Gilyoung\u2019s weapon was made with the head bone of a young ground rat.[You have succeeded in acquiring weapons by yourself.][A very small number of constellations are interested in the primitive nature of humanity.][The constellations have sponsored you 100 coins.]Everyone received these messages.\u201cWe receive coins even for this type of thing.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want you to die. You have your own coins?\u201d\u201cYes, we do.\u201d\u201cWhenever possible, leave enough coins for the survival cost and invest the rest in your strength, stamina and agility. Otherwise, you won\u2019t survive.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dWe finished the preparations and started to move forward again. The 100 steps that Lee Gilyoung mentioned was right in front of us now.[The sub scenario \u2013 Food Acquisition has begun!]The ground rats crawled out from the ground. I quickly counted the numbers. One, two, three\u2026there were exactly 13. It was more than I thought.Grrr\u2026The group of land rats drew a line and started threatening us. The moment we crossed the line, the fight would begin.\u201cThere is no plan. We are beginners. It might sound cruel but honestly, I don\u2019t expect you to survive.\u201d\u201cT-That\u2026\u201d\u201cStill, all of you survive. Please.\u201dHan Myungoh was the only upset one in the party. Everyone else was nervous but looked determined. In particular, Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes were very impressive.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s try it. Everybody, please live!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJust as Yoo Jonghyuk tested me, I also had expectations for them. No matter how good a mentor, a person who wasn\u2019t determined couldn\u2019t survive in this world.In the end, it was up to a person to save themselves. Everyone should use this opportunity to realize it clearly.\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201dI also knew who I must take among these people.As we took one more step, the ground rats moved. The battle began.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was actually a little bit surprising. In particular, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon who stepped forward with me were very influential.The battle composition naturally became the three of us in front with the other three in the rear. Less than a minute after the battle began, a few ground rats were stuck on the ground with their necks pierced.Lee Hyunsung overpowered another ground rat, wiped the sweat on his forehead and said.\u201c\u2026I think I can live.\u201dOnce they raised their overall stats, the human race wasn\u2019t that weak.Even so, Lee Hyunsung\u2019s mentality was very special in this world. A normal human couldn\u2019t be so nonchalant when encountering monsters.There was a reason why he got the name of Steel Sword in the future. However, the more amazing person was Jung Heewon.\u201cThe pattern is simpler than I thought?\u201dMaybe it was due to the Kendo skill but every time her sword stretched out, the ground rat was cut somewhere on their legs or tail.\u201cHap!\u201dIt was a case where Jung Heewon invested most of her coins into strength. Her endurance declined due to it but the power of one blow was better than I thought.Hwiik!Her sword moved in a terrifying manner through the air.\u201cDamn, I lost one! Please!\u201dHer voice trembled as she spoke. Her only weakness was that her stamina was low so her endurance fell.Grrr!The ground rats who moved between the party members were moderately smart. After succeeding in scattering the ranks, they ran towards the opponent who seemed the weakest using a hunter\u2019s instincts.\u201cLeave it to me.\u201dHowever, the ground rats didn\u2019t know that they had picked the wrong opponent.Peeok!A blunt instrument thrown by Lee Gilyoung\u2019s hands struck the head of a ground rat. The impact was lacking because he was a child but it was enough. The others could help him finish it.Puok!Yoo Sangah\u2019s spear pierced the body of the ground rat. The ground rat twisted several times. Yoo Sangah made a confused expression but she didn\u2019t remove her hand from the spear.The ground rat lost its energy and fell down.I honestly thought it would be difficult for Yoo Sangah to adapt but I was really surprised. Usually, it was normal to panic like Han Myungoh standing over here.\u201cU-Uhhhh\u2026\u201dAs the people were struggling, one person was hiding in the rear. He couldn\u2019t even hide properly and was bleeding near the shins.I pierced the last ground rat with the thorn and the surroundings became quiet.I shook the blood off the thorn and looked at everyone. Everyone suffered from minor abrasions except for Han Myungoh, but there were no major injuries.It was a great first victory.Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung relaxed and sat down, while Lee Hyunsung stabbed his spear into the ground and wiped at the sweat on his forehead. Jung Heewon lamented as she countered the number of ground rats in the vicinity.\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi, how many did you take care of?\u201d\u201cFour of them.\u201d\u201cChe, I killed two.\u201d\u201cI got three.\u201dMy pride was somehow hurt when I heard Lee Hyunsung\u2019s proud declaration. There was only one difference despite my stats. I used a skill and looked at Lee Hyunsung\u2019s attributes window.+[Character Information]Name: Lee HyunsungAge: 28 years old.Constellation Sponsor: Master of Steel.Private Attribute: Soldier who Turned a Blind Eye to Injustice (General)Exclusive Skills: Bayonet Skills Lv. 2, Camouflage Lv. 1, Patience Lv. 1, Sense of Justice Lv. 1, Weapons Training Lv. 2.Stigma: Great Mountain Push Lv. 1Overall Stats: Stamina Lv. 12, Strength Lv. 9, Agility Lv. 9, Magic Power Lv. 6.Overall Evaluation: The moment of the attribute evolution is gradually approaching.

The Master of Steel seemed to quite like Lee Hyunsung.The Starter Pack was a coin package that could be used when the average overall stats of the incarnation was less than level 10.It was a good item that allowed you to learn Weapons Training, a useful skill in the beginning, while raising the level of the overall stats by one.Considering the fact that most incarnations were being exploited for nothing, Lee Hyunsung was lucky to receive the Starter Pack.\u201cDokja-ssi, your complexion doesn\u2019t look good\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, no. I was just thinking for a moment.\u201dNow I was a little bit envious\u2026well, I had the money to buy it. I didn\u2019t buy it. My average stats exceeded level 10 so buying it would only damage me.Damn, I opened the Dokkaebi Bag a bit early.\u201cLet\u2019s gather up the ground rats. We need to prepare today\u2019s food.\u201d\u201cUmmm\u2026by the way, how will we cook it? We can\u2019t eat it like this.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t eat it now but there will be a way.\u201dI guessed I answered too calmly. There was silence among my party members. Lee Hyunsung was the first one to open his mouth.\u201cExcuse me, I would like to ask you one thing.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi, perhaps\u2026do you know something about this situation?\u201dWhoops, I made a mistake.\u201cThat\u2026\u201dSuddenly, I remembered the regressors in the novel I read, followed by Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s words.It was like this. The feeling of a regressor. Usually, these types of things happened to a regressor.Some replies came to mind. I could shamelessly say that it was a hunch or I could lie like Yoo Jonghyuk.[The constellation Secretive Plotter is anticipating your choice.][A few constellations are anticipating your answer.]But from a reader\u2019s point of view, the best answer was\u2026\u201cA-Aaaack!\u201dIt was to create a situation where I didn\u2019t need to say anything.[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 nods at your choice.]\u201cThere is still one left!\u201dJung Heewon shouted and Lee Hyunsung ran. However, the action of the hidden ground rats was faster than anyone else. It was much bigger than the other creatures.\u201cS-Save me\u2026!\u201dIt dragged Han Myungoh into a tunnel by one of his legs. The nearest Yoo Sangah swung her spear but the situation got worse because Han Myungoh held onto her.\u201cGrab this!\u201dLee Hyunsung stretched out the handle of his spear but it only hit the ground. The ground rat and the two people had already disappeared into the ground.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 resents this frustrating person.]Jung Heewon burst out.\u201cAh\u2026I knew I was going to get cancer because of that uncle.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I was too late.\u201dLee Hyunsung spoke in a sad voice. I tapped his shoulder to show it was okay.\u201cNo one could\u2019ve done anything.\u201d\u201cShould we chase after them?\u201dI looked at the hole where they had disappeared. It wasn\u2019t an ordinary hole. There was a touch of energy around it. The darkness gave off a gloomy feeling.I retreated to the back and turned on my smartphone. There was only 5% battery remaining. At dawn, I exchanged one battery charge for food with a person from the marginalized group.[Your reading speed has increased due to the effect of the exclusive attribute.]Shortly afterwards, I was able to find the desired passage.\u300c \u2026The \u2018Edge of Darkness\u2019 is the habitat of the ground rats and is a type of subspace emitted from the \u2018Dark Root.\u2019 The ground rats that breath in black ether instead of oxygen don\u2019t grow naturally unless they are near the \u2018Edge of Darkness\u2019\u2026 \u300dIt was a fact that I knew roughly but it was meaningful to review it. That\u2019s right. This was the entrance to the Edge of Darkness. I read about it and put the smartphone in my pocket.\u201cDokja-ssi?\u201dLee Hyunsung was looking at me with a frustrated expression. I nodded.\u201cWe will enter.\u201d\u201cAh, then\u2026\u201d\u201cBut it very dangerous to enter with a lot of people. Lee Hyunsung-ssi and Jung Heewon-ssi will wait here at the boundary. If something happens, I will give you a signal.\u201dThe startled Jung Heewon asked.\u201cSurely\u2026you don\u2019t intend to go with only Gilyoung?\u201d\u201cGilyoung\u2019s ability will be helpful in pursuing them.\u201dThe moment she tried to strongly resist, I raised a hand and called to Lee Hyunsung.\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi. Jung Heewon-ssi isn\u2019t in a good condition so please take care of her.\u201dLee Hyunsung seemed to realize something.\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cWait a minute. I am fine!\u201d\u201cJung Heewon, confidence is good but don\u2019t be reckless.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s breathing was uneven. She wasn\u2019t completely healed from the poisonous fog.I left the two people and entered the hole with Lee Gilyoung. It was obviously a hole that was dug down in a vertical slope. But as soon as we entered, we could stand as if gravity was in effect.It was due to the magic power emitted by the Edge of Darkness.\u201cThis way.\u201dThe darkness was so deep that I couldn\u2019t see anything, so I could only move forward with Lee Gilyoung. Black ether had the property of absorbing light, making a flashlight meaningless. If Lee Gilyoung\u2019s ability Diverse Communication wasn\u2019t available, I might have to use coins again.\u201cExcuse me Hyung.\u201dLee Gilyoung called out to me.\u201cDid you do it on purpose?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cWhen that uncle grabbed Noona and Ahjussi, you let it go.\u201dI had a moment of hesitation. In the darkness, Lee Gilyoung\u2019s fingertips were strange. Before I could ask how he knew, Lee Gilyoung spoke.\u201cAt that time, I was looking at Hyung\u2019s face.\u201dHe was watching me even in those short moments. A very scary kid. It was no good hiding from a person who was so quick.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dThe answer was terrible and a message bomb was set off in my head. Indeed, this was a spectacle for the constellations.[The constellations of absolute good frown at your cruelty.][The constellation Secretive Plotter is pressing you with shining eyes.]\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d\u201cBecause of the habit of the ground rats.\u201dI decided to answer honestly.\u201cThe ground rats have a habit of keeping their catches in the same place as their treasure. It isn\u2019t just food. Many things that seem rare are gathered. For example, an item. However, the paths are so complicated that it can\u2019t be found unless I follow their path directly.\u201dLee Gilyoung was silent for a moment. I continued speaking.\u201cI expected them to take Han Myungoh. I didn\u2019t expect him to grab onto Yoo Sangah.\u201d\u201cThen your purpose isn\u2019t to save Noona or Ahjussi, it is the items?\u201d\u201cYes. Are you disappointed?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201dLee Gilyoung\u2019s small hand gripped my finger tightly.\u201cHyung shouldn\u2019t lie.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf Hyung was such a person, you wouldn\u2019t have saved me on the subway. I believe in you.\u201dLee Gilyoung didn\u2019t act like a child but he was still a child. Lee Gilyoung didn\u2019t know. To be mature and to be an adult were completely different things.[Some constellations are touched to tears.][200 coins have been sponsored.]In this world, there were mean adults who would take advantage of such maturity. The hole was longer than I thought and we had to go downwards for quite a long time.\u201cHyung.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHyung, are you a god?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cOr the main character?\u201dChildren sometimes asked sharp questions. It was because they lived in a world where stories and reality weren\u2019t clearly distinguished. Lee Gilyoung didn\u2019t know exactly what his question meant.\u201cI\u2019m not a main character. Rather, I always envy the main character.\u201d\u201cBut you still know something about this world?\u201dI thought for a moment before replying.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll ask you one thing.\u201d\u201cI will answer it if I can.\u201d\u201cOnce we clear all these scenarios\u2026can we make a wish?\u201d\u201cWish?\u201dI was a bit confused.\u201cUsually there is a reward at the end of these stories. At the end of this story, is there something like that?\u201dIn the darkness, Lee Gilyoung\u2019s breathing was trembling. Lee Gilyoung\u2019s expression when he saw his dead mother suddenly came to mind.Those who adapted to this world suffered from it in different ways. Some were crazy, some were fanatics and some had irrational optimism.\u201cYes, there is.\u201dI was grateful that this place was dark. It was because Lee Gilyoung couldn\u2019t see my face right now.\u201cWe are almost there Hyung.\u201dThe surrounding black ether was shrinking rapidly. It was evidence that Dark Root was nearby. I tensed up and gripped the thorn.[A few constellations are holding their breaths.]I heard the sound of the ground rats somewhere in the ground. As the sound got closer, the sense of space expanded rapidly. I saw a light in the darkness, as if someone had lit a fire.Then I saw a tattered box beyond that light. The moment I was convinced that I had come to the right place, messages rang in my ears.[The sub scenario has been updated.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[You have entered the \u2018Ground Rat\u2019s Treasure Trove.\u2019]TL Note: Some of Lee Hyunsung\u2019s skill levels are less than the first time his attribute window was checked.

This\u2026\u201dRight after Lee Gilyoung discovered the treasure box, I blocked his little mouth.\u201cShh, wait.\u201dThe world of Ways of Survival was relentless. The constellations enjoyed the adversity of the characters and added obstacles in the scenarios just to fuck with humans.Things saying \u2018Catch me!\u2019 usually contained traps and even system messages couldn\u2019t be trusted.\u201cThe treasure trove doesn\u2019t just contain treasures.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 is disappointed.]Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2026 He had wanted me to die for a while.Anyway, I waited. Shortly afterwards, shadows started to emerge around the treasure chest.Grrr\u2026It was the ground rats. They brought something through the tunnel, threw it and exchanged information.Hwaruruk.Once a certain number of ground rats gathered, the number of lights illuminating the surroundings increased. It was black fire, flames made with black ether.It was said that this place was the core of Dark Root, which was why it had so much black ether to burn. At that time, someone\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cIt is all because of Yoo Sangah-ssi!\u201dThere was no need to say who he was. It was a voice I would know at once. I gripped the shoulder of the surprised Lee Gilyoung tightly. It wasn\u2019t time yet.\u201cBecause of me, what do you mean by that?\u201dIn the dim light, there were two people captured by the ground rats. They were tied up tightly by branches that came up from the ground.\u201cI-If Yoo Sangah hadn\u2019t taken the subway, the situation wouldn\u2019t be like this!\u201d\u201cWhy does the subway matter now?\u201dHow could she accept all this nonsense? Maybe Yoo Sangah was a saintly person. Or maybe the sponsor behind her was a saintly person.\u201cT-That\u2026That, Yoo Sangah-ssi, you ride a bicycle all the time\u2026\u201dHan Myungoh\u2019s voice shook as he wrote gibberish.Yoo Sangah\u2019s tone was cold. \u201cWait a minute. Were you the one who stole my bike?\u201d\u201cW-What is this person? I clearly told you that I would drive you in my car! You should know how to accept favours!\u201d\u201cAnswer me. Did you steal my bike?\u201dAll of a sudden, the situation made sense. This was it. It was why a person who drove a Mercedes-Benz S class took the subway line 3.Well, it wasn\u2019t strange. There were quite a few men who had their eyes on Yoo Sangah, not just at the company but at Gumho Station as well.In fact, Yoo Sangah was a worthy person. Her atmosphere was warm and she knew how to flatter people.[The constellation Demon-like Judge of Fire hates the character \u2018Han Myungoh.\u2019]Han Myungoh\u2019s face was so red that it could clearly be seen in the dim lighting. It looked dangerous.\u201cYes, shit! I did it! So what?\u201d\u201cWhy are you talking like it isn\u2019t a big deal? You took someone else\u2019s things, it is theft.\u201d\u201cTheft?

I quietly gripped the thorn.\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you just one thing. I continuously asked to take you home but you kept fucking rejecting me\u2026\u201dI threw the thorn as hard as I could. The thorn scratched the corner of Han Myungoh\u2019s mouth and continued into the darkness.\u201cUwaaaaack!

There was no way it wouldn\u2019t be in Dark Root.[\u2018Dark Keeper\u2019 could appear!][The sub scenario has been updated!][Sub scenario \u2018Kill the Guard\u2019 has begun!]Like slaves surrendering to a king, the terrified ground rats fell to the ground. A dark figure appeared in the dim light. A tentacled monster reminiscent of a god of death.Lee Gilyoung\u2019s complexion deteriorated sharply.\u201cOof, Hyung, that\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is okay.\u201dEventually, Lee Gilyoung fell to the ground and started retching. It wasn\u2019t strange.A lot of pressure was felt just looking at it from afar. The cockroaches crawling around long had their stomachs exploded. Lee Gilyoung, who was connected to the cockroaches, would\u2019ve suffered considerable mental damage.\u201cGilyoung. How many more times can you use Diverse Communication?\u201d\u201c\u2026I think I can do it one or two more times.\u201d\u201cI understand. Then rest here for a while.\u201dI left Gilyoung leaning against the side and approached Yoo Sangah and Han Myungoh. The panicked Han Myungoh was struggling.\u201cO-Ohuk! What is this\u2026?\u201dI took the Swiss knife and cut the branches binding the two of them. I only moved the knife a few times. Then the part of the branch that it touched abruptly corroded and the blade melted away. Yes, this was the power of a demonic species.\u201cStay back.\u201dI said while raising a weapon made of the spine of a ground rat.The grade 7 demon type species, Dark Keeper. Among the many monsters that appeared since the start of the destruction, the demon species were toxic.In fact, the treasures of the ground rats were close to \u2018tributes\u2019 to the demon. Even if it was the same grade, the demon species were different from other monster species.[The dark keeper has received the favour of the demon king it follows.]\u201cKamyun. Der. Yitur.\u201dThe demon species had their own language, worshipped different demon kings and inherited some of the power of the demon king through Dark Root.[The Dark Keeper has emitted \u2018Fear.\u2019][The exclusive skill Fourth Wall has neutralized most of the \u2018Fear\u2019 effect.]Therefore, killing one demon meant becoming the adversary of their demon king.\u201cYitur!\u201dI didn\u2019t know what it was saying but the situation didn\u2019t look good. I didn\u2019t want to fight if possible.\u201cM-Mother?\u201dYoo Sangah. She still hadn\u2019t left?\u201cI told you to stay back.\u201d\u201cThat monster just said \u2018Mother\u2019\u2026\u201dI thought for a moment about what this meant. No, wait a minute.\u201cUhh, I think\u2026K-Karud, yemiren? Ah, this is the pronunciation? Aketu?\u201dFor a moment, I thought I was mistaken. But I didn\u2019t hear wrong.\u201cKallitu!\u201dSurprisingly, the dark keeper nodded at the end.[The character \u2018Yoo Sangah\u2019 has activated the \u2018Interpreter Lv. 3 skill.]\u2026Oh my god, she wasn\u2019t only good at Spanish. Let\u2019s see what would happen.\u201cWhat is he saying?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026it keeps saying \u2018become Mother\u2019\u2026\u201d\u2026Become mother? The dark keeper cried out again and pointed to Yoo Sangah.\u201cKallitu!\u201dYoo Sangah had a tearful face.\u201cUh, Mother? I\u2019m not married yet!\u201dThe dark keeper pointed at Han Myungoh this time.\u201cKallitu!\u201dHan Myungoh turned pale as he wiped his mouth.\u201cW-Why am I the mother? Father!\u201dThe dark keeper\u2019s tentacles rose.Pushu!\u201cOoooof!\u201dOne of the tentacles entered his mouth and Han Myungoh turned black. There was the sound of something moving down Han Myungoh\u2019s throat.That\u2019s right. This was what it meant to become the mother. I belatedly recalled that the demon species conceived their young in the body of other species.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, you don\u2019t plan to have a child yet, right?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dYoo Sangah immediately understood the words and stepped back quickly. I swung the ground rat spear and tore at the tentacles attached to Han Myungoh.The dark keeper roared angrily.\u201cKallituo!\u201dFushu!\u00a0Teong!The tentacles of the demon species were gradually breaking the ground rat spear. Even the stone hog thorn, which broke through the stomach of an ichthyosaur, would\u2019ve been destroyed the moment it was stuck in a demon\u2019s body.Before I knew it, Han Myungoh was far away while Yoo Sangah looked at me.\u300c Is there a chance? \u300dHer eyes seemed to be asking me. To tell the truth, I didn\u2019t have a chance.Pushu!\u00a0Pushuu!\u00a0Teong!After a few strikes, the ground rat spear was almost destroyed. The hand holding the spear was in pain.The monster guarding the treasure chest couldn\u2019t be caught, just like the ichthyosaur of Dongho Bridge. That\u2019s why the original plan wasn\u2019t to deal with this monster but to obtain the treasure chest after it disappeared.But as always, plans existed for things to go wrong.\u201cDokkaebi. Are you watching?\u201d[U-Uh. You knew?]The dokkaebi showed up in the darkness. I didn\u2019t know his name but he seemed to be a cousin of Bihyung.\u201cThere should be some mail for me by now. I want you to hand it over quickly.\u201d[Hihit. It isn\u2019t my responsibility. I-It is Bihyung\u2019s thing.]\u201cRight now, you are taking Bihyung\u2019s place.

I think it will be interesting!]The dokkaebi muttered something and the summoning began.[The item has arrived from the exchange.][The item \u2018Broken Faith\u2019 has been acquired.][The brokerage fee was exempted due to the effect of the contract.]Broken Faith. The item bartered for the \u2018ichthyosaur core\u2019, which was registered on the Dokkaebi Bag\u2019 exchange, had finally arrived.\u201cKik.\u201dThe dark keeper saw the item coming out of thin air and laughed. No wonder it was laughing. All I received was a D grade item. It was a knife broken in half.[The item is too old to use. The durability will be poor and it will be difficult to achieve any performance.]Even the dokkaebi who gave him the item was giggling.[H-How can you fight with that old thing? And it can\u2019t be used if you don\u2019t have a special skill\u2026]I knew that much. I wouldn\u2019t have bought it if I didn\u2019t know.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dI sucked in a breath and concentrated my mind.Kiiing!The hilt started trembling greatly. Biryu shouted with shock.[Uh? How?]It was natural to be surprised. It was because this was a skill I bought from his friend for a huge 10,000 coins. Blue ether started to settle slowly on the surface of the broken blade.[White Pure Star Energy]After killing the ichthyosaur, I bought this skill from Bihyung. There were a few flaws compared to other superior energy techniques, but they weren\u2019t something that could be obtained for the time being.[Broken Faith has responded to your star energy!][Blade of Faith is activated!]Shortly afterwards, a brilliant white virtual blade sprang up from the edge of the broken blade.Broken Faith. Its real performance was revealed when star energy was injected into it.Pushuuk!The number of tentacles increased by dozens and covered my field of view. I wouldn\u2019t be safe from these attacks with my current stamina level. It was scary. But now there was a chance.Kiiing!It was because the Blade of Faith was the best quality weapon when it came to demon species.Pachuchuchuchut!The tentacles touched by the blade were oxidized and cut off. The dark keeper let out a terrible scream as its tentacles were destroyed. I felt magic power draining out but I wasn\u2019t in a hurry.Sukakak!I calmly moved the blade.I missed the tentacles many times because he didn\u2019t have the \u2018Fighting Senses\u2019 skill and I didn\u2019t have the Swordsmanship Training skill, so the way I wielded the blade was terrible. It was natural. I was a reader, not a swordsman.And a reader fought in the manner of a reader.[The attribute effect has improved your memories of the pages already read.]The pages of Ways of Destruction flashed in my head.\u300c\u2026The dark keeper\u2019s attack pattern is simple.

The young boy looked at me with awed eyes. Unfortunately, unlike his wishes, I wasn\u2019t the main character in this world. But I was confident of at least one thing.\u201cKar. Mien. Der.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe dark keeper muttered as it barely managed to pull itself together from its shock. I didn\u2019t ask but Yoo Sangah muttered from behind me in a quivering voice.\u201cHow do you know all my weaknesses\u2026?\u201dThis was what it meant.

Now he knew what he had done.[The grade 7 demon \u2018dark keeper\u2019 has been killed and the demon king \u2018Asmodeus\u2019 has noticed the murderer\u2019s presence.[The demon king Asmodeus will chase the one who dealt the finishing blow until they are dead.][The demon king Asmodeus has put a terrible curse on the person who dealt the final blow!][Final Blow:\u00a0 Han Myungoh]\u201cW-What? What is this message?\u201dHan Myungoh cried out fearfully.[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 admires your wickedness.]\u201cAh\u2026didn\u2019t I tell you? I intentionally didn\u2019t kill it.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 has recommended your scenario to Star Stream.]Han Myungoh stared into the air like he had lost his soul.The curse of the demon king \u2018Asmodeus\u2019 was the most terrible thing for a killer. I didn\u2019t know what it was but it was surely terrible.I looked back and saw Lee Gilyoung and Yoo Sangah looking this way with bemused expressions. I smiled as if nothing had happened.\u201cWe\u2019ll open the rewards together.\u201d*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *After a while, we searched through the treasures and pulled out one each.\u201cI got this.\u201d\u201cI have this\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung found a small bracelet and old shield respectively.[Magic Power Recovery Bracelet][Old Iron Shield]They were both D grade items but it was better than nothing. The Magic Power Recovery Bracelet was a useful item for everyone and the Old Iron Shield would be good for Lee Hyunsung.It was difficult to ignore the \u2018iron\u2019 in the name. This iron was much harder than Earth\u2019s iron.Yoo Sangah spoke with slight disappointment.\u201cIt is less than I thought.\u201dLess. Her words weren\u2019t wrong. It was too shameful to call this a \u2018treasure trove.\u2019Yoo Jonghyuk.The guy who left yesterday had probably gone through this place. He knew he would be tired fighting the demon so he took a chance and stole the treasure.In the end, we were robbing a place that was already robbed.\u201cit is okay because the main thing is still left.\u201dI looked at a black box in the centre of the warehouse. We didn\u2019t waste any more time and opened the box.The thing in the box was a stove. It was small enough to fit into a pocket and it was shameful to call it a stove.[Magic Power Stove].As expected, it was still here. This item was in fact the key item in this sub scenario.[Magic Power Stove can only be used once per person.]Obviously, Yoo Jonghyuk had taken one so there were two Magic Power Stoves in total.\u201c\u2026What is that thing?\u201d\u201cWell, I think I know a bit about its purpose.\u201dI purposely trembled, activated the stove with magic power and raised a dead ground rat\u2019s leg.It was funny since it didn\u2019t fit the size of a plate of food, but in five seconds, a remarkable change happened to the leg of the ground rat.\u201cWow! A delicious smell!\u201dThere was a sweet smell and the leg of the ground rat changed to a golden colour.\u201cMeat!\u201dLee Gilyoung cried out excitedly. Yoo Sangah asked urgently.\u201cC-Can we eat this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try it first.\u201dI grabbed the greasy hind leg and dug into the flesh. The juices ran from the flesh\u2026I forgot to chew and closed my eyes. Tasting it was different from reading it in the book.[A few constellations are drooling.][The constellations have sponsored you 100 coins.][The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 has swallowed his saliva.][The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is biting his nails.]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.The messages continuously popped up. Indeed, eating broadcasts were the best. Everyone was united in front of food.\u201cEat it. I think it is okay.\u201dThe two people rushed towards the meat as soon as I spoke. They hadn\u2019t had a proper meal for three days so they would be quite hungry. Han Myungoh recovered and came over hesitantly.\u201cD-Dokja-ssi\u2026I-I went crazy for a second\u2026\u201d\u201cEat. Don\u2019t worry about the other thing.\u201d\u201cT-Thank you!\u201d\u201cYou will become a ghost after eating.\u201d\u201cW-What\u2026?\u201dHan Myungoh\u2019s complexion turned as white as death. I said it like a joke but Han Myungoh really would die. Asmodeus\u2019 pursuit was hard for even Yoo Jonghyuk to overcome.We each took one leg and started to eat. We were eating meat together because we were hungry after everything that started. Humans couldn\u2019t help it.Everyone ate the meal in silence. Was it due to the light spreading gently from the Magic Power Stove? I was feeling a bit sentimental.Killing something and eating it in order to live. This was the life of a human. It had been like this so far but I wondered why it felt so fresh.Suddenly, I looked up and met Yoo Sangah\u2019s eyes. Ha, Yoo Sangah came to her senses and suddenly cried out.\u201cI\u2019m pathetic.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi worked so hard and I am just eating like a pig\u2026 I was no help at all\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, Yoo Sangah-ssi. That\u2026\u201d\u201cBut how does Dokja-ssi know all this? You know how to cook a beast and\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201d\u201cIndeed! It must be because you read fantasy novels, right? Really, I didn\u2019t know the world was going to be like this. My silly self was just memorizing Spanish.\u201dI felt somewhat strange when I heard Yoo Sangah say this. I opened my mouth to comfort her.\u201cIt is because Yoo Sangah-ssi studied foreign languages that you learned the language of the demon species.\u201dOf course, it wasn\u2019t very helpful.\u201cI see\u2026 Thank you, Dokja-ssi\u2026\u201dI smiled at Yoo Sangah and got up from where I was sitting. The party was immersed in eating again. I took a break and headed for the back of the party.In fact, the Magic Power Stove was important but my real purpose was a separate item. I looked closely at the \u2018black box\u2019 that contained the Magic Power Stove. It was this. There was no doubt about it.Yoo Jonghyuk, who took the Magic Power Stove, probably didn\u2019t know about it. The real treasure of the warehouse was this \u2018black box.\u2019In the original story, Yoo Jonghyuk only knew about this after the 6th round of regression.Who was the first to discover this. Was it \u2018Heavenly Maid Hori?\u2019 Well, it was hard to remember. It wasn\u2019t accurate but it was probably something like this:\u300c \u201cOver there. There are strange boxes in the early areas. If you put something in there\u2026\u201d \u300dAt this time, I met Yoo Sangah\u2019s eyes.\u201cWhat is the box for?\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah, this\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah said as she looked at the box. There were unknown characters written on the box.\u2026Could she read them?\u201cRandom\u2026item box?\u201dDamn. This was why foreign language proficiency was important.\u201cUh\u2026that\u2026um. So that is what it means.\u201dI was a bit embarrassed. Yoo Sangah cried out.\u201cQuickly use it, Dojka-ssi!\u201d\u201c\u2026Is it okay?\u201dNod nod.\u00a0Lee Gilyoung nodded vigorously.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about us. All the items obtained here are yours. That is obvious.\u201dYes, I was caught so let\u2019s do it quickly.\u201cThen I will use it well.\u201d[A few constellations are nodding at your decision.]I took the nucleus of the grade 7 demon from my pocket. I had cut it from the dead body of the dark keeper. In addition, I took out Broken Faith which had run out of durability. According to the original plot, the use of this box was simple.\u300c \u201cWho knew? There would be a limited edition coin item.\u201d \u300dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euI placed the demon core and Broken Faith into the box.\u300c \u201cHa, you can\u2019t believe me words? Is it real? Put sub items in there and close the box!\u201d \u300dIn fact, I didn\u2019t know what would happen when I put in these two items. But I was certain that something huge would come out.\u300c \u201cA top item will unconditionally come out!\u201d \u300dA moment later, a dazzling light burst out from the closed box.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a product that was forced to be banned by the Star Stream Administration Bureau.If sub items were put it, it would \u2018unconditionally\u2019 spit out a top item. This would have a tremendous impact on the balance of the scenarios. In addition, the price of one item box was a huge one million coins.The constellations were angry at this ridiculous billing policy and the stupid dokkaebi who invented this item was fired from the Administration Bureau.[C-Constellations. It is like this\u2026 I don\u2019t know why it is here\u2026H-Hihihit! Broadcast end!][#BI-7623 channel has temporarily closed.]The delirious sounding Biryu closed the channel and the voices of the constellations disappeared. I regretted not being able to see the reactions of the constellations but it couldn\u2019t be helped.Dudududu.I looked down at the vibrating box. The random draw was about to start in earnest.[A sword type item will be awarded for putting in the same type of items!][The random draw has started!]The limited edition random item box randomly spat out items of a higher rank related to the item you put in. There was a chance for anything from a C grade to a SSS grade item to come out. In the end, it was all up to chance.[The offered items are related to a certain constellation!][The probability that an item associated with this constellation will appear is greatly increased.]\u2026Eh?It was an unexpected message. But it didn\u2019t seem to be a disadvantage for me. Both my hands were sweating. I hadn\u2019t been so nervous when I bought a random chance item in an online game. Please let it be an A rating.[A top rated item has appeared!][The number of available random item boxes is 0.]The box soon stopped trembling and the faint light subsided. I looked around at Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung, whose eyes were shining.\u201cShall we open it?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWe opened the box.\u201cW-Wow!\u201dLee Gilyoung was so surprised that he screamed. By the way, it really was amazing. A luxurious silver guard and a white blade\u2026the shape was somewhat similar to Broken Faith?I immediately checked the item information.+[Item Information]Name: Unbroken FaithRating: Star RelicDescription: In the past, it was the sword of the hero \u2018Kaizenix\u2019, who led the Grusiad during the Great Demon Age. The great ether dominance of Kaizenix allowed him to create a \u2018Blade of Faith\u2019 that contained fire, darkness and divine power respectively.As an additional option, it increases strength and stamina level by 2.+I was speechless. No\u2026was this real? It wasn\u2019t a simple alphabet rating but a star relic item?\u201cD-Dokja-ssi! Doesn\u2019t it look like a huge item?\u201dIt really was a huge item.In the world of Ways of Survival, the \u2018star relics\u2019 were the only items excluded from the ratings table. It wasn\u2019t just because they had a strong performance but because these items were special.Every star relic contained the power of a living constellation.The difference in performance varied depending on whether the constellation was the hero of a certain world and how much awareness they had. However, they contained the power of a constellation so the relics had tremendous value.In addition, it raised the level of his strength and stamina by 2. When taking into account that A grade items increased the total stats value by 1, it must be at least a S grade item.Yoo Jonghyuk hadn\u2019t obtained an item like this yet.I looked around at Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung.\u201c\u2026I can really have it?\u201d\u201cOf course. It naturally belongs to Dokja-ssi.\u201dYoo Sangah responded in advance to his repeat question. Lee Gilyoung also nodded eagerly.I looked at Han Myungoh but he was just eating the leg of a ground rat with a stupid expression. He was muttering unknown things to himself. I thought he would insist on having the item\u2026it was strange.[You have acquired a star relic.][The owner of the star relic is curious about you.]The message showed that the constellation existed somewhere. Later, I would open up Ways of Destruction and look for it.\u201cThen we should go back. There are plenty of ground rats out there so we can go back with just the Magic Power Stove.\u201d\u201cBut how do we get back?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be a problem to leave with Gilyoung\u2019s power. Use Diverse Communication and\u2026\u201dHowever, Lee Gilyoung\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t bright.\u201cHyung, I\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t any insects nearby.\u201dCome to think of it, the insects around here had burst from the pressure when I was fighting the dark keeper. It was a problem I hadn\u2019t thought about.\u201cThere really isn\u2019t one? Some of them should still be alive. If we move for a bit and use the ability\u2026\u201dThere were so many insects in the world that I didn\u2019t have any sympathy for the few who died. But Lee Gilyoung still had a dark expression.\u201cWell, there is one I can actually call\u2026\u201d Lee Gilyoung closed his eyes and started concentrating.\u201cDokja-ssi, isn\u2019t this a big strange?\u201dLee Gilyoung\u2019s eyes were gradually losing focus. Then blood flowed down from his nose.\u201cGilyoung?\u201dAll of a sudden, there was a loud vibration from above them. Dust started falling down. The vibration was coming from above ground\u2026At this moment, goosebumps appeared on my skin.Kuuong!\u201cGilyoung! Lee Gilyoung! Wake up!\u201d\u201cYe\u2026Hyung?\u201dLee Gilyoung\u2019s eyes returned to normal.\u201cGilyoung, stop the skill! Quickly!\u201dThe surprised Lee Gilyoung stopped the skill and the vibration subsided. I sighed with relief.There were incredibly dangerous monsters running around above ground. There were numerous high rated monsters, including the grade 7 rhinoceros. Among these monsters was the insect king. It was obvious a type of insect just based on the name.\u201cYou really\u2026\u201dI placed my hand on Lee Gilyoung\u2019s head and didn\u2019t say anything. He was about to call an insect king from aboveground\u2026 was he Fabre? We almost got buried here.\u201cFor the time being, seal this skill. Don\u2019t use it unless I tell you to. Understood?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dLee Gilyoung replied in a sad manner. Now there was no choice but to wait.\u201cWe will get lost in the darkness. Let\u2019s wait a bit longer and move when small insects appear in the vicinity.\u201dIt was easy to enter but the Edge of Darkness was a very dangerous place. It was a place where someone could disappear for a day or two if a little mistake was made.Then Yoo Sangah raised her hand.\u201cIf it is just going back, I think I can fill in for Gilyoung.\u201d\u201c\u2026How?\u201dI was going to ask if she would converse with the Edge of Darkness but stopped because it seemed sarcastic. Yoo Sangah replied in a slightly uncertain tone.\u201cI have a similar skill.\u201dWhen I thought about it, I still didn\u2019t know Yoo Sangah\u2019s attribute and sponsor.\u201cWhat is the skill?\u201d\u201cThat, it is a complicated skill to untangle\u2026\u201dUntangle?\u201c\u2026Excuse me, can I ask what Yoo Sangah-ssi\u2019s attribute is?\u201dYoo Sangah wasn\u2019t a character in the novel so I didn\u2019t know her attribute. It was like Lee Gilyoung and Han Myungoh.\u201cUh, that\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah made a difficult expression. It wouldn\u2019t have been so frustrating if I could use Character List on Yoo Sangah. I tried to use Character List once again as a test.[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.][This person isn\u2019t registered in \u2018Character List.\u2019]Indeed\u2026 But there was one more message.[Currently collecting information about the corresponding figure.]\u2026Eh?It was a message that never existed before. Come to think of it, I heard a system message when Yoo Sangah used the \u2018Interpreter\u2019 skill. It wasn\u2019t something that was originally heard.Was it possible for the Character List to be updated after some time? Perhaps\u2026I organized my thoughts and decided to let Yoo Sangah go.\u201cForget that I asked. By the way, nice work. In the future, don\u2019t let other people know about your personal attribute.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it! I trust Dojka-ssi\u2026!\u201dWell, Yoo Sangah\u2019s appearance said otherwise. At the moment, I got an idea.\u201cCan Yoo Sangah tell me about the nature of your sponsor?\u201dYoo Sangah bowed her head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe words barely escaped from her trembling lips. Based on this level, it was possible that she made some type of promise in the contract with her sponsor. Perhaps there was a life constraint in respect with the spilling of information.I didn\u2019t know what sponsor they were but it seemed they had decided to raise Yoo Sangah in earnest.\u201cIt is okay. I understand.\u201d\u201cThank you, really\u2026\u201dThere was no need to thank me. She couldn\u2019t tell me her sponsor\u2026it made my heart tense. It was the desire of a reader who wanted to fill the space between empty lines.\u201cThen try using your skill.\u201dSoon, a faintly shining thread emerged from Yoo Sangah\u2019s fingertips and started to stretch out.\u201cIn fact, I tied up a \u2018thread\u2019 when I got kidnapped.\u201dOne branch of the thread was connected to me and the other one was connected outside. Maybe it was bound to Lee Hyunsung or Jung Heewon.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThere was no reason for Yoo Sangah to have such a skill from the beginning. This was definitely the stigma provided by her sponsor.By the way, it was a \u2018thread\u2019 to escape the labyrinth. This\u2026somehow, I thought it was a constellation I knew.[#BI-7623 channel is open.]I started hearing messages from the constellations again.[A number of constellations have put a claim on the channel\u2019s transmission system!][The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 is curious about what came out of the random item box.]Ah, they haven\u2019t seen it? What a pity.[Damn! That bastard messed with my channel\u2026hahahat! Did you stay well while I was away?]And the nice\u2026no, a familiar voice was heard. Bihyung.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *[\u2026You did such great things while I was gone?]\u2018Was it because of me that you couldn\u2019t come back?\u2019[It\u2026yes, it isn\u2019t unrelated. I got a warning from the Administration Bureau because the advertisement went on for too long.]Now Bihyung\u2019s voice was only audible to me. It was the \u2018dokkaebi communication\u2019 that only the dokkaebi could use. Of course, it was an obvious violation of the rules to allow me to use it.[I have decided not to care about small things now. And I can go back and forth to the Administration Bureau. Rather\u2026 how do you know about the \u2018Random Box\u2019?]\u2018Just, I found it by chance.\u2019[Dammit. There are still remnants of the black history left.

Surely that absurd coin item wasn\u2019t planned by you?\u2019As a reader of Ways of Survival, I didn\u2019t know this.[Damn! If I wasn\u2019t greedy at that time\u2026]\u201cWow, it really is delicious. What a surprise.\u201dBihyung\u2019s grumbling was cut off by Jung Heewon\u2019s cry of admiration.10 minutes ago, we safely encountered the rest of the party thanks to Yoo Sangah\u2019s guidance. Fortunately, Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung kept the boundary until we came back.\u201cYou will recover a bit after eating.\u201d\u201cWell, I really think that my better is getting better.\u201dJung Heewon seemed much better as she swung her shoulders in a test. The meat of the underground species actually contained detoxification components.\u201cDid you get a lot of things in there? In addition to the Magic Power Stove\u2026\u201d\u201cI got a few things.\u201dI looked at Lee Hyunsung and said.Lee Hyunsung put on and removed the Old Steel Shield that he received from me several times. Now he was polishing the surface again and again. It was like someone with a new car.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 feels a faint loyalty to you.]Jung Heewon seemed envious of the scene and asked.\u201cIs there anything I can use?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhat is that blade?\u201d\u201cIt is mine.\u201d\u201c\u2026Will you distribute the meat to the people?\u201d\u201cIf they have coins.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026you are really stingy. Kim Dokja.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s say that I have a strong sense of survival.\u201dAs we were passing around a piece of cooked ground rat, the tunnel ended. The surroundings suddenly brightened and people started to be seen. But the atmosphere was weird. What was this urgent and bustling mood?[There are 20 minutes left until the paid settlement.][Prepare the survival fee.]I belatedly noticed the time. That\u2019s right. It was already that time.

Please, a few coins\u2026\u201d100 coins wouldn\u2019t be a problem if they faithfully participated in the scenario, but such humans were rare.\u201cI\u2019ll give you one million won, no, ten million won! Who will sell 100 coins?\u201dThe price of the coins was soaring. It was funny. There was a ridiculous premium on money that had no value until the beginning of the destruction.And there were people smiling as they watched from afar. These guys already had enough coins. It was Cheon Inho and the Cheoldoo Group.A few women flocked towards the gang members and cried out.\u201cY-You said you would give me 100 coins before!\u201d\u201cHrmm, is that so? I don\u2019t remember.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\u201cI will think again if you will let me put it in one more time. How about it?\u201dJung Heewon pulled out her blade and stared at them.\u201cThose sons of a bitches\u2026\u201d[The attribute of character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 is about to blossom.]The time had come for Jung Heewon. It wasn\u2019t bad if her attribute blossomed now\u2026yet.

Save me!\u201dThe expressions of the party changed. Lee Hyunsung bowed his head sadly while Jung Heewon bit her lip while holding her blade.Everyone knew what the price of the \u2018paid settlement\u2019 was. There was no one here who hadn\u2019t experienced it.\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi.\u201dThen Yoo Sangah looked at me.\u201cYes.\u201dIn this world, coins were power.

You are probably the richest one among us, right?\u201d[The character \u2018Cheon Inho\u2019 has activated the \u2018Incite Lv. 2\u2019 skill.The crowd looked my way.\u201cC-Coins?\u201d\u201cWho has a lot of coins?\u201dIt didn\u2019t take long for all eyes to turn to me. Cheon Inho, he was a really great guy.\u201cY-You are Dokja-ssi?\u201d\u201cPlease save me!\u201dPeople panted as they approached. The number of people flocking was estimated to be at least 20. If I gave all these people coins, I would lose 2,000 coins. But if I didn\u2019t give them coins, I would become a big villain of Gumho Station.[Your understanding of the character \u2018Cheon Inho\u2019 has increased.]\u201cHaha, Dokja-ssi. I don\u2019t have the coins to help all these poor people but\u2026isn\u2019t Dokja-ssi different? Will you just wait and watch?\u201dI sighed quietly. I had seen this trick one or twice.[The constellations of the Absolute Good system have defined Cheon Inho as \u2018wicked\u2019.]I had enough of putting up with him.\u201cS-Save me!\u201d\u201cPlease save me!\u201dPeople burst into tears with the most pitiful expression in the world.[Hahahat! This story is becoming fun. For reference, there are 10 minutes left!]Bihyung spoke in a voice that was full of joy and the party looked at me with strange expressions. I let out a short sigh and slowly closed my eyes before opening them again.\u201cI see. You want coins?\u201dThen I laughed.\u201cWhy should I?\u201dI looked around at the people. The first scenario was original sin. Thus, none of the people here were innocent.That made it more disgusting. Those who trampled on someone else to survive, who couldn\u2019t even bear responsibility for their own life.\u201cW-Why?\u201d\u201cYou have a lot of coins! Can\u2019t you give us a few?\u201dIn the midst of the confusion, Cheon Inho burst out laughing.\u201cI expected this from Dokja-ssi.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom the very first moment Dokja-ssi showed up here. Didn\u2019t you sell food for coins? If you didn\u2019t make them buy food at that time, do you know how many people can survive now?\u201d\u201cYes! He is right!\u201d\u201cShit! Give me back my coins!\u201dSuddenly the atmosphere was flowing against me. Maybe this was what Cheon Inho wanted.\u201cJust a minute everyone! Your actions right now\u2026!\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi isn\u2019t such a person!\u201dYoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung tried to diffuse the crowd but they had already lost their sense of reason. Then Cheon Inho drove in the last wedge.\u201cDokja-ssi. I will give you one last chance. Give the coins back to the people.\u201d\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d\u201cThen the worst will happen.\u201dThe crowd of 20 people started to approach step by step.\u201cT-This\u2026come! Give me your coins!\u201dNevertheless, no one attacked first. Eventually, a member of the Cheoldoo Group came forward.\u201cYou scum! What are you doing? Kill him! Why are you hesitating when you can snatch the coins after killing him?\u201dThe man who shouted had a very sturdy physique. I triggered Character List and confirmed his information.+[Character Summary]Name: Han MinsungPrivate Attribute: Bully (General)Overall Stats: Stamina Lv. 8, Strength Lv. 8, Agility Lv. 8, Magic Power Lv. 2.+He was the owner of abilities that fit a \u2018bully.\u2019 He wasn\u2019t originally at this level\u2026this guy did \u2018it.\u2019 Yes, he acted rashly because he believed in his stats.\u201cKill that bastard!\u201dThe metal pipe in his hand moved. A steel pipe containing a Lv. 8 strength. The former \u2018Kim Dokja\u2019 might be scared by this threat but\u2026 For the current me, it was just ridiculous.Sukak!The man\u2019s arm was cut off and rolled across the ground with the iron pipe.\u201cKuaaack!\u201dThe blood covered Unbroken Faith was emitting a white light. I swept a glance over the quiet people.\u201cU-Uh\u2026\u201dEveryone turned pale when they saw a Cheoldoo Group member being overwhelmed with one blow. Now that I had shown off a bit, it was time to start.\u201cPathetic\u2026 do you really believe this situation is because of me?\u201dI looked left and right at each face in the crowd. On the other side, Cheon Inho was looking confused.\u201cIn fact, you know very well that it isn\u2019t me.\u201dLike a sick goldfish, the mouths of the crowd dropped open. I spoke like I was disseminating food to them.\u201cYou guys are doing this because you are scared. In fact, even though you knew what was wrong and are in a crisis, you are trembling in fear because of them.\u201d\u201cHaha, look at this, Dokja-ssi! What are you saying\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt is because they are stronger than you! Their overall stats are higher than you and they have a lot of coins! But everyone, you know what?\u201dI took a step towards the crowd and asked. The entire crowd retreated like surprised goldfish. However, they were already in my fish tank.\u201cWhy are they stronger than you?\u201dI took one more step.\u201cMore than anything, why do they have more coins than you? Is it because they are gangsters? Perhaps.\u201d[The characters around you are shaken.]Even in fear, there were some emotions that could be conveyed with certainty. Questions passed over their faces.\u201cC-Cheon Inho-ssi, how many coins do you have\u2026?\u201d\u201cHaha, don\u2019t you know? Well, I have sold a few and\u2015\u201d\u201cDo you think it is possible to get that many stats with just that? Really?\u201dCheon Inho closed his mouth. I turned from left to right, looking at the crowd\u2019s faces one by one.\u201cWhen I came to Gumho Station a few days ago, there were 87 people here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut how many people are left now? I don\u2019t think there is more than 50 people. Do you know why?\u201d\u201cT-They went out as scouts and the monsters\u2015\u201d\u201cMonsters? Do you still believe that?\u201d\u201cT-Then\u2026\u201d\u201cYou fools. Think about it with your brains. Did those people really die because of the monsters? Then why haven\u2019t any of the Cheoldoo Group bastards died?\u201dThe area became quiet in an instant.\u201cWhy is it that they come back stronger?\u201d[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 nods at your reasoning.]\u201cD-Don\u2019t tell me\u2015\u201dThe people turned to look at Cheon Inho. The Cheoldoo Group members hesitated. Now it was my turn to drive in the wedge.\u201cThey said it before. If you kill me, you will get coins.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 pulls his hair in excitement.]\u201cBut how do they know that killing a person will give coins?\u201d\u201cY-You\u2026Inho-ssi! Don\u2019t tell me?\u201d\u201cShut up! I\u2019m being framed!\u201dAs Cheon Inho moved back, the men of the Cheoldoo Group pulled out their weapons. The frightened people were weeping.[Hahahat! There are 7 minutes left!]I stepped forward towards the people.\u201cIf you have any last self-respect left, fight with your own hands.\u201dThe Blade of Faith cried out violently. Anger filled the eyes of the people.\u201cAt least get back what was taken from you.\u201dAs I waited, the people of the Cheoldoo Group rushed towards me simultaneously. I also ran towards them.\u201cNow this world is such a place.\u201dThe white light moved and people screamed. Then someone shouted.\u201cYes, shit!\u201d\u201cSons of a bitches!\u201dThe people started to move. All in all, they were people who had already killed.\u201cM-Mother!\u201d\u201cDayoung, come here! Do this! Just like what you did on the subway with Mother!\u201dChildren and mothers.\u201cThis fuckin\u2019 bastards!\u201dThere was a middle-aged Indian man.\u201cThese scum!\u201dBut they weren\u2019t a match.The number of people left in the Cheoldoo Group was high and their fighting power was overwhelming due to all the coins they obtained through human hunting.Or this would be the case if it wasn\u2019t for me.Sukakak!The arms and legs of the Cheoldoo Group members who rushed for me flew off. The eerie sensation of cutting off a person\u2019s limbs filled my hands. The incapacitated Cheoldoo Group members looked up at me.\u201cS-Spare me\u2026\u201dAt that moment. Someone moved ahead of me and stuck their blade in the fallen Cheoldoo Group members.\u201cI said I would kill him.\u201d[All evolution conditions of the attribute \u2018Crouching Figure\u2019 have been met.]The attribute of character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 is blossoming.]A dazzling brilliance was rising from her body. I nodded. It was now time.[The attribute of \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 has blossomed to \u2018Judge of Destruction (Hero).]A judge to wipe out evil. The best of the three \u2018judge\u2019 attributes woke up from a crouching figure.[You have contributed greatly to the attribute of \u2018Crouching Figure!\u2019][The character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 won\u2019t hesitate to be your sword in the future.]\u201cRest from now on.\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s eyes were pale blue as she declared.\u201cThese guys are my share.\u201d[The character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 has activated the exclusive skill \u2018Judgment Time.\u2019][The Absolute Good constellations have agreed to the use of this skill.][\u2019Judgment Time\u2019 has been activated.]Jung Heewon had a bloody aura around her body as her blade painted an eerie trail. It was a light and precise kendo that moved between the Cheoldoo Group members. Blood spurted everywhere.\u201cKuaaaak!\u201dIt was a scene of a complete massacre. Of course, Jung Heewon wasn\u2019t the only one fighting. Yoo Sangah, Lee Hyunsung and even Lee Gilyoung were protecting their respective positions. But no one was as active as Jung Heewon.Like a person who was born for murder, Jung Heewon killed and killed. If I cut off a man\u2019s arm, Jung Heewon stabbed his heart. If I cut off his leg, Jung Heewon cut his throat.Jung Heewon took care of all those I left behind. She moved without hesitation, like a person who had been longing for this moment.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe area was filled with blood.The only person left from the Cheoldoo Group was Cheon Inho. However, many parts of his body were injured by the citizens. Jung Heewon looked at me and I nodded. Cheon Inho laughed as he looked at me.\u201cHu, huhu\u2026y-you\u2026\u201dHe never stopped speaking. Jung Heewon appeared behind Cheon Inho and cut him from top to bottom.[All constellations in the channel feel intense joy.]Finally, everyone stopped moving. The fight was over. However, they couldn\u2019t feel it.The times when they ate grilled meat, felt the meaning of life, joked while walking and enjoyed moments of peace all seemed like a lie.This damn scenario.Yoo Sangah was crying. Lee Gilyoung closed his eyes. Lee Hyunsung bit his lips so hard he was bleeding. Jung Heewon exhausted her physical strength and was sitting in a pool of blood.Yes, this was the truth of the world.[The survival value will be settled.]There was the sound of popping all around us. Those who had coins survived. Those who failed to get coins were now dead. And no one was able to save each other.I said to the people.\u201cWake up, everybody.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEven if I raised my head, the sky couldn\u2019t be seen. I stared at the unseen sky for a while, resisting some great fate.The noisy constellations had no answer this time.\u201cThis scenario has just begun.\u201dWhile everyone was in deep thought, I was thinking about the next scenario alone. My mind was calm as pages flipped one after another.I have obtained everything I needed from Gumho Station. The next stage was Chungmuro.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Omniscient Reader\u2019s ViewpointChapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 6 \u2013 Judgment Time (3)The following morning, there were a few changes to Gumho Station.First of all, Han Myungoh had disappeared.He had hidden once the fighting started and disappeared after it ended. I didn\u2019t know if he was hiding somewhere in the station or was moving to the next station.\u201cLet\u2019s not worry about him now. I didn\u2019t like him from the beginning. In addition, he isn\u2019t the only one who disappeared.\u201dIt was as Jung Heewon said. After the fight yesterday, the number of people remaining in Gumho Station was almost nonexistent.It wasn\u2019t that there were few survivors. Rather, more people survived compared to the original plot. However, most of those who survived left the station last night. Perhaps they had their own reasons.\u201c\u2026Will the remaining people be okay?\u201dYoo Sangah asked as she looked at the survivors.Me, Yoo Sangah, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung and Jung Heewon. Apart from us five, there were only five people left in this station.Jung Heewon spoke first.\u201cHey everyone. Are you coming with us?\u201dThe casual words caused a stir among the people. The representative was a young woman holding a child\u2019s hand.\u201c\u2026We will go separately. We have some coins left.\u201dI honestly admired that the mother and child survived the bloody fight. If she had that much strength, they might be able to survive without going with us.Jung Heewon nodded.\u201cYes. I wish you luck.\u201dOnce Jung Heewon turned around, relief appeared on the people\u2019s faces.In fact, this response wasn\u2019t strange. Certainly, yesterday\u2019s situation was a bit shocking.It was understandable. One refused to give out charity while another one brutally killed people, even if there was a reason. To them, Jung Heewon might not be much different from the Cheoldoo Group.I touched Lee Hyunsung, who was making a stupid expression next to me.\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi?\u201d\u201cAh, yes!\u201dLee Hyunsung, who was staring at Jung Heewon with a blank expression, looked at me with surprise. I think I knew what he was thinking.He wondered if she was the woman struck by madness yesterday and killed all the Cheoldoo Group.\u201cAre the preparations finished?\u201d\u201cYep! It is a big rough but it is finished. There are plastic bottles to be used as water containers, goods to protect from the cold and emergency supplies\u2026\u201dIndeed, a soldier was useful in situations like this.\u201c\u2026It is up to here. If you need anything else\u2026\u201dThere was nothing else I needed\u2026I wanted to say but I suddenly thought about something.\u201cOh, can you find me any portable secondary batteries?\u201d\u201cYou are talking about a battery? Why\u2026?\u201dIt was natural to wonder. A smartphone was useless because no signal was available. I replied roughly.\u201cI have a place to use it.\u201dLee Hyunsung said he would look for it and started to search through the things left behind by the Cheoldoo Group. Lee Gilyoung and Yoo Sangah also said they would help. Jung Heewon looked at me and asked.\u201cAre we going now?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going.\u201dShe asked naturally, as if there was no question that we would go together. This was Jung Heewon. It was welcome from my viewpoint. The \u2018Judge of Destruction\u2019 was a talented person who even Yoo Jonghyuk would pay attention to.\u201cI have many questions.\u201d\u201cNot now.\u201d\u201cAh really, you are an iron wall.\u201dJung Heewon lightly punched me and laughed.[You have received 1,500 coins from the character \u2018Jung Heewon.\u2019]\u201cThis\u2026?\u201d\u201cI am dividing it. I feel too sorry to eat it all alone. I will give it to other people.\u201dI understood what she was saying. Yesterday, Jung Heewon alone killed most of the Cheoldoo Group members. In other words, she obtained most of their coins. By the way\u2026 I was a bit nervous about this.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do this.\u201dJung Heewon didn\u2019t know. In fact, I had a lot more coins.\u201cI\u2019m not Dokja-ssi, you know?\u201dShe punched my arms a few more times before walking towards the tunnel with her backpack.\u201cFinish this off. I\u2019ll go ahead and make some arrangements.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go too far ahead. There are dangerous sections to go alone.\u201dJung Heewon waved her hands as if not to worry while wandering away.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 likes your comradeship.][The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 smiles slyly.]I watched the messages in the air blankly and said.\u2018Did you make a lot yesterday? It must be good.\u2019There was no answer. I spoke once again.\u2018Don\u2019t keep pretending and tell me. I know you are watching.\u2019[Ah, hahaha\u2026 you caught me?]It was Bihyung\u2019s voice.\u2018How much did you earn?\u2019[\u2026T-That. Um.]I stared silently.[Sigh, right. How did you know again\u2026? I just can\u2019t get over it. Take this.][Dokkaebi \u2018Bihyung\u2019 has given you 4,500 coins.]I thought so. This damn dokkaebi.[\u2026The constellations don\u2019t use the sponsorship system and send it directly to me. I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019ll give it to you later. Ah, there are these messages as well.]Messages suddenly popped up.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is satisfied with your scenario][The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is convinced of your judgment.][The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 is satisfied with your plan.]This was why I didn\u2019t get the support messages yesterday.I had been curious because such a great thing happened and I received less income than I thought.[Coins Possessed: 23,050 C]I invested a lot of the coins I obtained last time into stats and now I had a lot of coins again.It was once again time to improve my stats. Then let\u2019s do it moderately. I couldn\u2019t open the attributes window so I had to remember the exact level of my stats.First\u2026stamina was important.[1,200 coins have been invested in stamina.][Stamina Lv. 12 -> Stamina Lv. 15][The durability of your body has greatly increased!]I had no separate passive attack skill so I also raised my strength.[1,600 coins have been invested in strength.][Strength Lv. 11 -> Strength Lv. 15][A stronger force will come from your muscles!]For agility, it was enough to be able to evade.[400 coins have been invested in agility.][Agility Lv. 10 -> Agility Lv. 11][Now you can more a bit faster.]I needed to maintain White Pure Star Energy so magic power must be over level 10.[1,200 coins have been invested in magic power.][Magic Power Lv. 6 -> Magic Power Lv. 10][A mysterious energy lives in your soul.]I could invest more than this but I purposefully didn\u2019t. Once I arrived in Chungmuro, there was another place where I would have to use a lot of coins.Besides, I had spent 4,400 coins just now. It was both easy and difficult to use. If I had been born with decent stats, I wouldn\u2019t have to spend so many coins.Someone born with level 1 stamina\u2026 in Ways of Destruction, even Lee Gilyoung\u2019s stamina would be higher than that.[By the way, I forgot\u2026two more scenarios are recommended. You are really great. It seems that I will soon be able to upgrade my channel level.]\u2018I see.\u2019I couldn\u2019t get the support of a sponsor like other incarnations, so I needed to collect more coins. But the reason why I didn\u2019t see the effect of contracting with Bihyung was because his channel was small.The \u2018minor\u2019 constellations weren\u2019t enough. In order to gather more coins, it would take more constellations to configure the channel. Once I went to Chungmuro, the environment would be ready soon.\u201cIf everybody is ready, we will leave. You aren\u2019t missing anything?\u201dMy companions gathered together and nodded. Looking at their nervous faces, all of them seemed to have been enlightened by yesterday.Finally, the journey to Chungmuro began.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *They had crossed half the railroad lines when the system message popped up.[The second main scenario is enabled.]+[Main Scenario #1 \u2013 Meeting]Category: MainDifficulty: EClear Conditions: Cross the tunnel and meet the survivors in the first main base.Time Limit: NoneCompensation: 500 coinsFailure: ???+The message made me realize that it was really starting. Unlike the first main scenario, the second scenario had a \u2018main base.\u2019 Jung Heewon asked.\u201cThe main base? Where is that?\u201dAn answer wasn\u2019t required. Another message immediately appeared.[The next main base is \u2018Chungmuro.\u2019\u201cIs it Chungmuro? It is only three more stops\u2026\u201dIt was originally like that.Ku ku ku ku!The ground rats appeared. There were around 30 ground rats. Jung Heewon stiffened.\u201c\u2026Go three stops through this.\u201dIt was Lee Hyunsung who came forward.\u201cI\u2019ll take the vanguard.\u201dThanks to the support of his sponsor, Lee Hyunsung\u2019s total stats were now 37. He had earned less coins than me but he was chasing me\u2026this was the advantage of being born with high stats.If I knew this, I would\u2019ve done regular push-ups.\u201cI\u2019ll take the rear, Hyung.\u201dLee Gilyoung\u2019s total stats were still low but he was able to use Diverse Communication more flexibly through steady skill training.\u201cPlease leave it to me.\u201dYoo Sangah made a thread with magic power to block the movements of the ground rats. Her attack ability was low but her overall stats were similar to Jung Heewon.Kwajik!\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t it just a lot of numbers?\u201dFinally, there was no need to talk about Jung Heewon. Compared to Lee Hyunsung, her total stats were low but her skills were sufficient.There was the exclusive skill \u2018Judgment Time\u2019 that belonged to the \u2018Judge of Destruction.\u2019 As long as the opponent in front of her was \u2018wicked\u2019 according to the Absolute Good constellations, Jung Heewon wouldn\u2019t lose.The last ground rat fell down. Lee Hyunsung held the shield by his side and started sweating.\u201cSigh\u2026this seems to be enough.\u201dIn fact, this shouldn\u2019t have been cleared so easily. No matter how simple the pattern of the ground rats was, fighting 30 of them was tough. I wouldn\u2019t be able to annihilate them myself without activating Bookmark. The party had become stronger.They advanced further through the tunnel. Finally, a new platform appeared in front of me.\u201cYaksu Station. By the way\u2026there is nobody? No, that\u2019s not it.\u201dYaksu Station was filled with dead bodies and ground rat corpses. Based on the injuries, some of the people were killed by Yoo Jonghyuk, not the ground rats.\u201cKeep going. There are two stops left.\u201dWe continued to advance. Anyway, the distance from Yaksu to Dongdae was less than 1km in a straight line.Once we arrived at the entrance of Dongdae Station, we encountered another group of ground rats and repelled them. We only moved a total of 2km along a simple path, but the fighting was so tough that the party\u2019s fitness dropped quickly.\u201cWe will take a break here.\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026there is one stop left. We should just go there and relax\u2026\u201d\u201cNobody knows if we can rest or not once we arrive there.\u201dEveryone was silent at my words. Certainly, monsters weren\u2019t the only dangers things in this world.I looked around for a moment and said.\u201cIt seems that the people in this station moved quickly. Some basic necessities might remain.\u201d\u201cAh right. Then\u2026\u201dAfter hearing \u2018basic necessities\u2019, Yoo Sangah gently raised her hand. Yoo Sangah and Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes met. No words were exchanged but both of them nodded at the same time. Jung Heewon saw my look and asked me.\u201cWhat is it? Does Dokja-ssi want to know?\u201dYoo Sangah paled.\u201c\u2026Heewon-ssi?\u201d\u201cAhaha, I\u2019m just joking. Of course, I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\u2026A secret only between women. It would be strange if I didn\u2019t know what they were talking about. Human physiology didn\u2019t stop even in a world like this.Lee Hyunsung also opened his mouth. \u201cAh, then I will go to the bathroom.\u201dI was surprised for a moment but there was no reason not to use well-built facilities.

It was in order to heal the skin contaminated by the poisonous fog.It took a little time but the contamination could be recovered by eating the meat of an underground species.[\u2026Hey! Are you crazy? What did you do just now?]I was eating when I heard Bihyung\u2019s voice furiously berating me.\u2018Shut up.\u2019[No, this isn\u2019t an issue you can dismiss. You destroyed a constellation\u2019s idol! Do you want to see my channel fail? Once the \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 begins to talk\u2026]The idol of a constellation. Every world had their own constellations, South Korea as well.By the way, Bihyung said it was the \u2018Bald General of Justice.\u2019 He was a great person in South Korea but\u2026Actually, I wasn\u2019t the type of person to say that.[A constellation wearing a straw mat is furious at your atrocious actions.][The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is laughing.]There was a difference in the degree of all idols, but they had the power of a constellation sealed in them.If I released the seal of the idol in the right way, I could gain a certain amount of power, such as an item or skill that the constellation used in their lifetime.However, \u2018unlocking the seal\u2019 took a long time and I wasn\u2019t sure if I could get the skill I wanted.I looked at Ways of Survival on my smartphone.\u300c \u201cBut if it is sealed in the bronze statue of Samyeongdang, how did you get the skill?\u201d\u201cThere is a saying that if you meet Buddha, kill Buddha.\u201d\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha, I was just trying it out\u2026 but it is true. All the statues aren\u2019t just for worship.\u201d\u201cHey! This jerk, you should watch your mouth. You might be cursed by the constellation.\u201d \u300dAt the last gateway to enter Chungmuro, the \u2018skill\u2019 of Samyeongdang was essential.And the most surefire way to get the skill was to destroy the idol. Of course, I could buy something similar from the Dokkaebi Bag but\u2026 the more coins I saved, the better.\u201cThen did you resolve the \u2018man\u2019s secret\u2019 well?\u201dI quickly turned off my smartphone screen. My companions, including Jung Heewon, had gathered.\u201cYes. And I have something for you.\u201dI pulled out the items I gained from the idol. As luck would have it, the Samyeongdang idol contained items and skills.[Samyeongdang\u2019s Beads][Samyeongdang\u2019s Straw Mat]Rags and old beads. There were questions in the eyes of everyone present. I knew what they were thinking.But I also knew this.

I know!\u201dFortunately, someone knew. Needless to say, it was Yoo Sangah.\u201cI remember seeing it when I was studying Korean history! Isn\u2019t he a monk from the Joseon Dynasty?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWhen the Korean military was struggling to defend against the Japanese invasion\u2026he fought in the Nowongpyeong battle and Wukwandong battel!\u201dAs expected from Yoo Sangah.

No way\u2026\u201dI thought it was ridiculous but there was a reason people said such ridiculous words.I put on a mock solemn expression as I watched the party.\u201cI think\u2026 it was sent by Samyeongdang for South Korea.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dTheir \u2018ah\u2019 were filled with many meanings. I ignored them and kept talking. It wasn\u2019t like I was asking for them to listen.\u201cHe might\u2019ve left his belongings to save the country, just like during the Japanese invasion of South Korea. Anyway, now South Korea is a country undergoing turmoil.\u201d[A constellation wearing a straw mat is moved by your words.]In times of turmoil, scammers always gained power.\u201c\u2026In this strange world, it isn\u2019t weird if something like this happens. Maybe Samyeongdang is one of the \u2018constellations.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dSurprisingly, Yoo Sangah seemed convinced first. Maybe she didn\u2019t want me to be embarrassed. The funny thing was that once Yoo Sangah agreed, Lee Hyunsung was immediately convinced.\u201cIndeed, Samyeongdang\u2026\u201dLee Hyunsung grew up with patriotism for a long time and looked like he was reminiscing on the principle of military service. Lee Gilyoung also seemed curious.It was only Jung Heewon who was watching me like it was nonsense.[A constellation wearing a straw mat likes your revealing words.][The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 forgives your sins.]Bihyung looked at the sky with a \u2018Is this okay?\u2019 expression before looking dumbfounded.The power of a constellation was directly linked to their fame. Thus, the constellations loved it when their stories were spread this way. Where was a constellation that hated being praised?\u201cI will give Samyeongdang\u2019s Beads to Yoo Sangah, since you know him well.\u201d\u201cReally? Can I accept it?\u201d\u201cI think Samyeongdang will be delighted if Samyeongdang uses it.\u201dIn fact, the performance of Samyeongdang\u2019s Beads wasn\u2019t good compared to what the sponsor used it for. It wasn\u2019t a sponsor\u2019s star relic so maybe the fact that the Samyeongdang wasn\u2019t a world-recognized figure had an effect.It was still a B class item so it had a secondary option of boosting magic power to increase magic power recovery.Jung Heewon watched Yoo Sangah like she was envious and said.\u201cYoo Sangah knows a lot of things. I didn\u2019t know about Samyeongdang because I didn\u2019t do very well at school.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026that\u2026that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m joking, joking. Don\u2019t make such an expression.\u201dI spoke to the sulky Jung Heewon.\u201cI also have something for Jung Heewon-ssi.\u201d\u201cFor me? Is it that straw mat?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. No matter how urgent, I don\u2019t want to wear such a thing.\u201d\u201c\u2026Just try it. You won\u2019t regret it.\u201dJung Heewon hesitated for a moment before throwing on the straw mat. She was trying to be fashionable but she just looked like a beggar.[A constellation who likes comradeship condemns your actions.][A constellation who praises friendship likes your actions.]It would be different if the star relic \u2018Samyeongdang\u2019s Bamboo Stick and Straw Sandals\u2019 came out, but the other two items weren\u2019t necessary for me right now.Jung Heewon saw her reflection on the screen door of the subway and made a slightly complicated expression.\u201cIt is hard to explain but\u2026I suddenly feel like I can harness the power of justice.\u201dSamyeongdang\u2019s Straw Mat was an item that enhanced the justice and willpower of the incarnation. I didn\u2019t need it but it was a pretty good item for Jung Heewon.\u201cYou said Samyeongdang? I feel sorry for some reason. I should study harder.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 is happy at this situation.][100 coins have been sponsored.]I jokingly said.\u201cThen let\u2019s put our hands together and pray.\u201d*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *It was a joke but Jung Heewon really went to pray.Jung Heewon was contaminated by the poisonous fog and spoke while eating a ground rat.\u201c\u2026But who broke it?

What is this?\u201dShe would know without asking.\u201cIt is coming. Everyone, please keep your mind straight.\u201dBefore my words were over, a haze overcame me. The fog that instantly occupied the tunnel blocked their field of view. The party members in the immediate vicinity couldn\u2019t be seen. When I looked around, I could only see a distorted scenery, as if I was on drugs.\u201cUwah\u2026I feel bad!\u201dJung Heewon screamed. Maybe Jung Heewon was seeing something different from what I saw now.\u300cDokja.\u300dThe voice I didn\u2019t want to hear. That forgotten voice was heard in a drug-like landscape. If I was this way, my other party members would be worse.\u201c\u2026Something feels strange. Dokja-ssi! Are you there?\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi!

Fortunately, it worked.I approached Yoo Sangah and said.\u201cCover the surroundings. From now on, I will destroy this space.\u201dYoo Sangah nodded with a nervous expression.[The exclusive skill \u2018Destroy Evil Lv. 1\u2019 is activated.]Destroy Evil. It was one level higher than the Repel Evil skill that could be bought with coins.

Please wake up!\u201dAt this moment, a blade flew from the rear. Fortunately, the blade wasn\u2019t fast and it wasn\u2019t difficult to avoid.\u201c\u2026I will kill all of you.\u201dJung Heewon was waving her sword through the air like a madman.My heart ached as I watched Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes became gradually redder.This was dangerous. It was a sign of \u2018Demon Slaying.\u2019Peok!I stunned Jung Heewon by strongly hitting her in the back of the neck. Luckily, Jung Heewon was intact.I thought it wouldn\u2019t be like this with Samyeongdang\u2019s Straw Mat but Jung Heewon\u2019s mental state was more fragile than I expected.\u201cYoo Sangah, please look after Jung Heewon-ssi.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, yes!\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d[You have met the conditions to clear the sub scenario!][You have earned 300 coins.]Monsters appeared as soon as the clear message showed up.

This needed to be picked up. Thanks to Yoo Sangah, the others were recovering quickly.\u201cA-Are you okay?\u201dThe one who recovered the fastest was Lee Hyunsung.

He pretended to be okay but perhaps the one with the most terrible trauma in this place was this child.I saw a pale light in the distance. Yoo Sangah said,\u201cDokja-ssi, I think it is over.I worried about it for a short moment. Jung Heewon was stunned and it was difficult for others to exercise their power. Would we be okay to enter Chungmuro at this rate?But my concerns were resolved by another person.A blade loomed in the darkness.

I guess Lee Jihye could be called that if the sponsor behind her wasn\u2019t known. Sooner or later, they would be punished. Lee Jihye frowned at the middle-aged people.\u201cAre you drunk again?\u201d\u201cHahahat! What is there to do other than drink when the world has become like this?\u201dThe middle-aged people seemed relaxed, unlike those who were experiencing a disaster.

It would be strange if they didn\u2019t follow him.But the boy didn\u2019t know. The boy survived not because Yoo Jonghyuk was a good guy, but because the boy was luckily with Lee Jihye.\u201cNow can I ask you a few things I am curious about?\u201dLee Hyunsung started asking politely while I was locked in my thoughts.\u201cYes. Just ask.\u201d\u201cHow is the food supply here?\u201d\u201cThat, it is a bit embarrassing to say\u2026 some people, including me, are dependent on Jihye. Jihye hunts and asks Yoo Jonghyuk-ssi to cook\u2026\u201dIt was unknown when he made a checklist but Lee Hyunsung took out his notes and started to write something. He really was a soldier.\u201cThen how is your drinking water?\u201d\u201cWe give food or coins to the \u2018Landlord Alliance\u2019 upstairs in exchange.\u201d\u201c\u2026Landlord Alliance?\u201dI sat straight up. Now the story was becoming interesting. The boy hesitantly opened his mouth.\u201cThey are the landlords in charge of the Chungmuro area. They occupy the upper floors and we call them the Landlord Alliance.\u201dChungmuro\u2019s Landlord Alliance. It was a name that appeared in Ways of Survival.\u201cWhat type of people are they?\u201d\u201cWell, what should I say\u2026\u201dIn fact, there was no need for me to ask. Perhaps, according to my expectations, one of the \u201810 Evils\u2019 was in Chungmuro right now.\u201cThey are just landlords.\u201dThis answer was the correct answer in a sense. They were landlords. Building owners who received fixed taxes. At this moment, the quiet Lee Gilyoung opened his mouth.\u201cExcuse me Hyung.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI want to go to the toilet.\u201d\u201cIs it urgent?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe timing was a bit unexpected. It was even more puzzling because Lee Gilyoung normally didn\u2019t say something like this. Then I noticed that Lee Gilyoung was standing next to a blushing Yoo Sangah.\u201c\u2026Excuse me, can I also go with you?\u201dAt the moment, the image of Yoo Sangah and Jung Heewon securing secret necessities at Yaksu Station came to mind. I thought I knew what was going on. That kid Lee Gilyoung, he quickly noticed it first.The boy overhead the conversation and said.\u201cYou need to go up to the second underground floor for the toilet, but it won\u2019t be easy to enter.\u201d\u201c\u2026Has something happened?\u201d\u201cYes. I think it is better to see directly\u2026I\u2019m going up to, would you like to go with me?\u2019\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dI was the one who said it. Of course, it wasn\u2019t to go to the bathroom. I had to go up and check a few things.Recently, Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s movements were different from the \u2018third regression\u2019 that I knew. If so, I needed to be clear about the gap.I went up to the third underground level with my friends, carrying Jung Heewon who was still unconscious.\u201cOh, I heard that there were new faces. Have you come to see the rooms?\u201dA middle-aged man standing near the escalator for line 4 whistled. The boy shook his head and replied.\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. We are going upstairs\u2026\u201d\u201cEh, too bad. Be careful.\u201dThe middle-aged man waved his hands without hesitation. Yoo Sangah watched the middle-aged man moving away and asked.\u201cThat, by the way\u2026 what exactly is the \u2018room\u2019? I don\u2019t think it is the rooms that I know.\u201d\u201cIt is easy.\u201dThe boy pointed to a square tile.The tiles were also present on the platform of line 3. Green tiles that were 1 pyeong in size. Looking at the details, I saw something written in the air above the tile.[Green Zone 0/1]\u201cThe scenario name is \u2018green zone\u2019 and these tiles are called rooms.\u201dNear the tile, two men were fighting each other. They were fighting over the tile. It was Lee Hyunsung who asked this time.\u201cWhat is that? Why are those people fighting over it?\u201dThe boy looked a bit reluctant. It was like talking to us would be a threat to his survival.\u201cYou will know once you arrive at the second underground floor.\u201dAs we climbed up to the higher floors, there were more fights over rooms. The room numbers were different. There were small rooms labelled (0/1) and large rooms labelled (0/7). The latter number was probably the capacity of the room.I looked around carefully and asked, \u201cThe third underground floor to the first underground floor is all the area of the Landlord Association?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. There are small forces but the Landlord Association has obtained most of it.\u201dAll the infrastructure of Chungmuro was located on the second and first underground floors, yet a single alliance occupied all of it.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk didn\u2019t take any action? Didn\u2019t he save you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dThe boy\u2019s face became noticeably darker at my question. The boy looked sullen for a while before barely being able to speak.\u201cHe told us to stand on our own\u2026\u201dI knew. Of course Yoo Jonghyuk would say something like this. Perhaps Yoo Jonghyuk never told them to follow him. They were fascinated by the overwhelming force that Yoo Jonghyuk showed and had hopeful dreams. How pitiful.Not long after, we arrived at the second underground floor. There was tension on the boy\u2019s face.\u201cWe have to be careful from here onwards.\u201dThere were much more rooms on B2 than the lower levels. The group\u00a0 of people fighting couldn\u2019t be seen. Instead, people were guarding the green zones with scary eyes.[Green Zone 7/7]We passed by the people and headed towards the bathrooms.\u201cUh\u2026why stop here?\u201dOur pace stopped as we approached the last passage to the bathroom. Like a bottleneck, dozens of people were gathered in the passage.\u201cLet\u2019s go forward.\u201dI spoke while pushing people out of the way.\u201cPildu-ssi! Please accept it! I won\u2019t do it again!\u201d\u201cPlease, please! Please let me stay one more day. I\u2019ll go into debt to get the coins!\u201dThe leader at the head of the line was facing the heated up people.\u201cNow now, back off. Back off.\u201dOn the opposite side, people who seemed to be from the Landlord Association were gathered. I could instinctively feel it.One of the 10 Evils was here. I tried to find the \u201810 Evils\u2019 member through the novel\u2019s description but it wasn\u2019t easy since all of them seemed to fit.Did their impressions became similar after becoming landlords?I was shaking my head when someone grabbed my leg. It was Lee Gilyoung. I sensed something danger and was about to grab his shoulder when someone pushed Lee Gilyoung.\u201cAh.\u201dLee Gilyoung lost his balance and fell down.[The character \u2018Lee Gilyoung\u2019 has invaded private property!]Suddenly, the atmosphere became cold and some of the \u2018Landlord Association\u2019 members in the front looked at Lee Gilyoung.\u201cWhat is this child?\u201dAt almost the same time, the crowd of people screamed and withdrew.\u201cCrazy!\u201d\u201cB-Back! Quickly!\u201dAs if they were never there, the crowd of people rushed back like the tide. The people disappeared and red lines shone where they used to be standing. One man looked between the boundary and Lee Gilyoung in turn.\u201cHrmm. You seem to be lost. Do you know where this is?\u201d\u201cThe way to the bathroom?\u201d\u201cThe bathroom? Haha, at one time. By the way, that kid\u2026where are your parents?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you learn that you shouldn\u2019t intrude on other people\u2019s land?\u201dOther people\u2019s land. Oh, it must be true.The man stroked Lee Gilyoung\u2019s head with an unknown look.\u201cYou don\u2019t know. From now on, I will teach you.\u201d[The character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 has activated \u2018Armed Zone Lv. 3!]There was a whirring sound and mini turrets resembling gatling guns rose from the ground.[The character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 demands 500 coins for invading his private land.][If you don\u2019t follow the recommendations, all nearby turrets will fire immediately.]The man spoke.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGive me money.\u201dThe loaded turrets were all aiming at the same point. The confused Lee Gilyoung stood up and moved to my side. The man saw me and laughed.\u201cAh, you are his guardian. Then shouldn\u2019t the guardian pay 500 coins instead?\u201dI smiled at the hand that the man brazenly stretched out.\u2026How funny, Yoo Jonghyuk.

Thus, a person wouldn\u2019t be aware of Gong Pildu unless they read to the end of Ways of Survival (like me).[Green Zone 56/70]Indeed, the size of his room was different. The size of the room couldn\u2019t be easily measured. This whole green zone was Gong Pildu\u2019s area.Let\u2019s do the standard procedure. I hid Lee Gilyoung behind me and opened my mouth.\u201cWhy should we pay you coins? Chungmuro Station is a public place.\u201d\u201cHaha, it was until eight days ago. But not anymore.\u201dFor ordinary humans, 500 coins wasn\u2019t a small sum. But giving 500 coins just for stepping on his land\u2026what a crook.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give it. But I\u2019ll give it to you directly.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou aren\u2019t Gong Pildu.\u201dGong Pildu might be a villain but right now, the person in front of me was just Extra \u20181\u2019 of the Landlord Alliance.Where are you, Gong Pildu? I quickly looked around. Not him, not him\u2026 I wondered where Gong Pildu was.\u201cHaha, you are a funny guy. Hey, playing with me now\u2026\u201d\u201cGong Pildu-ssi. Where are you? Take the fine.\u201dI ignored them and kept walking.[You have invaded private property!]The turrets aimed straight at me but I didn\u2019t stop.Honestly, there was no guarantee that I would be safe if the turrets started shooting. But there was a need to show off my combat power here. That way Gong Pildu wouldn\u2019t underestimate me.\u201cIt is up to here. I will give you if you come closer.\u201dFinally, Gong Pildu moved.A bench covered with various supplies. A middle-aged man sitting on top of it and reading a magazine was staring at me.Indeed, this was how he was described in the novel. His belly was half revealed and I could see the hair on it. This was Gong Pildu, the representative of the Landlord Alliance.\u201cThis is a face I\u2019ve never seen before but you are great.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it unfair that I need to pay to see you?\u201d[The character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 is interested in you.]In any case, I seemed to be the type that was popular with the bad guys. It was the same with Kim Namwoon.\u201cYou are fairly good at talking. But it isn\u2019t good to be too cocky.\u201dTadak.\u00a0I heard magic bullets being loaded in the turrets.

However, there were those who posted both characteristics and the \u2018armed fortress master\u2019 Gong Pildu in front of him was one of them.I realized it when I saw this explanation. His magic power was already at level 19. Indeed, this would be enough for him to be one of the 10 Evils in the future.\u201cBy the way, what did you come here for? I don\u2019t think your goal is paying the fine.\u201dHe was also very sensitive. I pondered over it for a while. Should I negotiate here or overpower Gong Pildu.It might be possible if I used all my power but it wasn\u2019t easy to break through Gong Pildu\u2019s Armed Zone. I needed to prepare for a big injury if I wanted to defeat the turrets.What should I do? There was a separate place where I had to use coins so it was impossible to increase my stats.\u201cI\u2019m warning you that you shouldn\u2019t think of anything.\u201dGong Pildu smiled at me. His troops were surrounding Lee Hyunsung. He really moved quickly.I laughed and raised both hands.\u201cPlease calm down. Isn\u2019t it obvious for a tenant to come to the landlord?\u201d\u201cIs it for a room?\u201d\u201cYes. Please let my companions and I sat in your green zone\u201dThis was a must. In order to clear the third scenario safely, we had to say in Gong Pildu\u2019s green zone. However, Gong Pildu\u2019s answer was as expected.\u201cNo. The alliance doesn\u2019t accept outsiders. I\u2019ll think about it if every person pays 500 coins a day.\u201d500 coins a day? It was like selling coins. It was more than the Dokkaebi Bag.\u201cIt is a bit tough so I will give you information instead.\u201d\u201cWhat information?\u201d\u201cInformation about Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk. The complexion of the landlords changed with one name.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk? Yoo Jonghyuk caused such an uproar not long ago\u2026\u201d\u201cYou bastard! What is your relationship with that guy?\u201d\u201cPildu-ssi! Isn\u2019t this bastard suspicious?\u201dThere was a reaction. I thought that Yoo Jonghyuk would\u2019ve already caused a problem with the Landlord Alliance.In fact, this point I was a bit unsure about. According to the original story, Yoo Jonghyuk of the third regression should be fighting against the Landlord Alliance by now. What was he doing?Gong Pildu stared at me with suspicious eyes.\u201cWhat is your relationship with Yoo Jonghyuk?\u201d\u201cWe are companions separated by life and death.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think it is like that?\u201d\u201cAnyway, we are friendly.\u201d\u201cHow can I believe that?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t believe me. Don\u2019t you have nothing to lose?\u201dI threw out the bait. Perhaps Gong Pildu would have to accept my suggestion. It was because right now, Yoo Jonghyuk was the only person who could threaten the power balance in Chungmuro.[The character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 has activated \u2018Profit Calculation Lv. 2!]\u201cWhy won\u2019t I receive any loss?\u201d\u2026?\u201cThere is no guarantee that you aren\u2019t a scammer. I can\u2019t ignore my years of experience.\u00a0 In my experience, people like you run away to avoid paying the rent at the end of the month.\u201dIt was so accurate that I felt wronged However, it was difficult to push it here.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, it can\u2019t be helped. Maybe there will be damages.\u201dGong Pildu\u2019s expression became complicated. I turned around without hesitation. It was important not to show any regret. That way, he would regret it even more.\u201cWait a minute.\u201dIndeed.\u201cYou have to pay the fine for intruding. Where are you trying to flee?\u201dIt was another regret. Dammit. I turned around and smiled awkwardly.\u201cHow much? 100 coins?\u201d\u201cNo, you and that kid are 1,000 coins.\u201dThe vein on my head bulged. Did this bastard think that 1,000 coins was 1,000 won\u2026?\u201cThat is too much.\u201dThe dokkaebi still hadn\u2019t given me the cut of the coins but I couldn\u2019t give 1,000 coins to a jerk like Gong Pildu.Gong Pildu grinned.\u201cThen you are disqualified as tenants. Die.\u201dI instinctively pushed through the men around me and ran to where my party members were.Kwang!There was the first firing sound and Lee Hyunsung held up a metal shield, blocking my back. He was really reliable.\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi.\u201dLee Hyunsung\u2019s strength and stamina were level 14 but he spoke very nervously. I could clearly see his trembling arm muscles.Lee Hyunsung hadn\u2019t obtained his second stigma yet, meaning he couldn\u2019t hold on against the turrets. Moreover, there was no Jung Heewon. If I started a head to head fight, someone in this party would surely die.\u201cGong Pildu-ssi, wait a moment. If we fight then you won\u2019t escape any damages.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt is better not to fight us now.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dThe damage had to be shown.\u201cIf we fight now, you will die here.\u201dGong Pildu\u2019s expression hardened. Even if I didn\u2019t add anything, Gong Pildu would\u2019ve noticed.The presence of the guy coming down the escalator from B1.

His eyes were questioning.\u201cWhy are you leaving Gong Pildu alone?\u201d\u201cIf you are a prophet, you should know.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know everything.\u201dTo be exact, I didn\u2019t remember everything.[The character \u2018Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019 has used the \u2018Lie Detection\u2019 skill.[The character Yoo Jonghyuk has confirmed that your words are true.]He was thorough.\u201c\u2026Indeed, I see. A prophet whose level of \u2018future sight\u2019 is low.\u201dThink what you want.Yoo Jonghyuk continued speaking.\u201cI need Gong Pildu alive.\u201d\u201cIs it because of a future scenario?\u201dYoo Jonghyuk didn\u2019t answer. It was like he was trying to gauge the information I knew.\u201cI know that you need Gong Pildu for future scenarios. But you only need Gong Pildu. You don\u2019t need the entire group that follows him.\u201d\u300c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u300d\u201cIsn\u2019t it your style to remove what you don\u2019t need? Why are you just leaving them?\u201d\u300c\u2026How annoying. \u300dWhat?\u201cI have a lot to do.\u201d Yoo Jonghyuk stared at me quietly and said, \u201cYou will never understand.\u201d\u201cWait! That isn\u2019t the problem. If you don\u2019t move now, most of the humans in Chungmuro will\u2026!\u201dYoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes were cold.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dI wasn\u2019t a humanist. I didn\u2019t believe that everyone in this world was worth living. The thing that was making me angry right now was Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk. Can I hit you?\u201d\u201cIf you have confidence.\u201dI angrily formed a fist as I heard a message.[The character Yoo Jonghyuk has used \u2018Strong Self-Defense Lv. 5\u2019.]I dropped my fist. Cowardly bastard.\u201cAre you finished?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dLee Jihye flinched at Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s call. Lee Jihye, who belated followed Yoo Jonghyuk, looked at me with confused eyes.[The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 is impressed by your chivalrous spirit.][100 coins have been sponsored.]Of course, it was completely misleading.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *[There are 1 hour and 30 minutes before the third scenario is activated.]There wasn\u2019t much time left and my mind was complicated.[The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 is angry that people\u2019s lives must be risked.][The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 wants an uprising.]Samyeongdang spoke loudly in my head but I couldn\u2019t think of a good way. The third scenario lasted exactly one week.Maybe Yoo Jonghyuk was planning to gain some other advantage during the duration of the third scenario.Of course, I couldn\u2019t let it go. I couldn\u2019t let it go\u2026[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is wondering what you are thinking.]\u201cThat jerk Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is satisfied.][100 coins have been sponsored.]In fact, the problem in front of me wasn\u2019t Yoo Jonghyuk but Gong Pildu. In order to break through the third scenario, Gong Pildu\u2019s help was absolutely necessary. But if I couldn\u2019t get his help\u2026Suddenly, Jung Heewon looked up and smiled.\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cYou know, that person. The one you were talking to Yoo Jonghyuk about.\u201dI immediately explained about Gong Pildu. Jung Heewon was unconscious so she hadn\u2019t been able to see Gong Pildu. I didn\u2019t mean to change the subject. Jung Heewon immediately reacted.\u201c\u2026What are these scum? Taking the public facilities and making people pay to use them?\u201d\u201cThe scum are upstairs.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go and throw them out.Jung Heewon picked up the ground rat blade. That reminded me, I should change their weapons. There was a lot to be done.\u201cIt is absurd.\u201d\u201cWe can win if we join forces. Don\u2019t you remember Gumho Station?\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s expression was confident.It was natural. Jung Heewon had the Judgment Time skill as a trump card. She had good senses and was quick to adapt, so she would\u2019ve already figured out her attribute and skills.\u201cDon\u2019t dawdle! Let\u2019s go and kill them!\u201dAs long as her opponents were \u2018wicket\u2019, her Judgment Time boasted the highest power.[The character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 has activated the exclusive skill \u2018Judgment Time.\u2019][The constellations of the Absolute Good system are silent at Jung Heewon\u2019s request.[The skill has been cancelled.]Jung Heewon\u2019s face filled with confusion.\u201cNo, this\u2026what? Is it broken?\u201dJung Heewon tried to activate the skill again. However, the skill wasn\u2019t triggered.\u201cNo\u2026why isn\u2019t it activated? Aren\u2019t they obviously wicked?\u201dI laughed at Jung Heewon\u2019s question.\u201cThat is what we humans think.\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThe constellations might be different. There is no guarantee that the good and evil they know is like what we know.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cJustice is always decided by the majority.\u201dRight now, the majority of constellations have decided that they are \u2018good.\u2019 Humans no longer had the right to decide on justice. Humans were just the puppets of their sponsors.\u201cThat\u2026\u201dI looked at the party members.Everyone didn\u2019t say anything but they thought in a similar way to Jung Heewon. Lee Hyunsung wiped the iron shield that was scratched by the magic bullets, while Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung sat next to each other on the ground, looking at cockroaches.This sense of despair, I could understand.They thought they understood after getting rid of the gang at Gumho Station. However, there was an incomparable monster just three stations away.It was time to start the torture of hope.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean there is no way.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIt might be difficult but there is a way to defeat them.\u201dThey simultaneously looked at me. Lee Hyunsung asked.\u201c\u2026Do you really have a way?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dI looked around and lowered my voice.\u201cGet Gong Pildu out of the Armed Zone.\u201d\u201cWhat is the Armed Zone?\u201d\u201cHis stigma. It is optimized to defend an area.\u201dArmed Zone. The reason why it was difficult to go against Gong Pildu was this stigma. It was a fraudulent ability that could build \u2018turrets\u2019 in an area.Right now, it was just Armed Zone. Once the stigma evolved in the future, it would become \u2018Armed Fortress\u2019 and a siege needed to be prepared to catch him.But Gong Pildu had an obvious weakness.\u201cHis Armed Zone will be released as soon as he leaves his designated area. His mini-turrets will also become useless. Usually, there are many restrictions on such a wide defense skill.\u201dAt the same time, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon looked at me with admiration.\u201cAh\u2026I see.\u201d\u201cYou figured this out after seeing it once? Is this Dokja-ssi\u2019s attribute?\u201dThe same thing was repeated but I saw that the people had adapted to me to some extent. Yoo Sangah asked.\u201cBut how will you make him move?\u201d\u201cWe have to think about that for now.\u201d\u201cAh, I hate thinking.\u201d Jung Heewon complained.Then everyone was silent for a while. It was Lee Hyunsung who gave his idea first.\u201cAttack when he goes to the bathroom\u2026\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you see the things next to the bench?\u201dGong Pildu never moved out of his Armed Zone. His bench had everything he needed. There was a sleeping bag, blanket, food, basic with water to eat and sleep and even a place to piss. Of course, the tenants provided him with them.\u201cCrazy. He is a complete shut in. No, is he not moving because he is hiding something good on the land?\u201d\u201cIt is the biggest \u2018room\u2019 in Chungmuro.\u201d\u201c\u2026Room?\u201dThat reminds me, Jung Heewon still didn\u2019t know about the rooms. But there was no need for me to explain.[There is 1 hour before the third scenario is activated.]She would son find out.\u201cWe also need to find a room.\u201dThe moment our party got up, the people around us flinched.\u201cD-D-Don\u2019t come closer!\u201dIn particularly, the man with a knife who was protecting a single person room on the No. 3 line platform showed high vigilance. However, other people rushed towards him before we could approach.\u201cGet out, your fucker!\u201dThey attacked indiscriminately. As soon as the man was pushed out, the mark of the green zone changed. The owner had changed.[Green Zone 1/1->\u00a0 Green Zone 0/1].The people were engaging in a bloody fight over the room. Someone was stabbed in the thigh while someone had their nose broken.Jung Heewon frowned.\u201cShouldn\u2019t we stop that?\u201d\u201cEven if we intervene, the result will be the same. In the end, somebody will die.\u201d\u201cWhy does someone have to die?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t possible to avoid in this scenario.\u201dI had just finished speaking while Bihyung emerged in the air.[Now no, shall we start the third day of the main scenario? New faces have arrived today so won\u2019t it be fun? Hahaha!]Bihyung glanced my way.There were three dokkaebis in charge of the Chungmuro scenario. It seemed that Bihyung was temporarily the representative. It was a natural consequence of being the smallest of the three channels.Then the third scenario arrived in front of us.+[Main Scenario #3 \u2013 Green Zone (Day 3)Category: MainDifficulty: CClear Conditions: Occupy the \u2018green zone\u2019 in the station and survive the monsters that emerge every night at midnight. This scenario will last 7 days.Duration: 8 hours.Compensation: 1,000 coinsFailure: \u2015+Lee Hyunsung\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cT-This\u2026!\u201d[It is simple. Occupy the green zone before other people. Of course, you can take away the green zone of others. By the way, you should hurry. If you don\u2019t have a green zone after the scenario starts, you will have a terrible experience. Haha, then everyone should try it!]People\u2019s expressions hardened as they heard Bihyung\u2019s words. In the meantime, the screams of the people continued.Peok!\u00a0Peok!\u00a0Peok!\u201cDie! Die!\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m not doing this because I have a grudge! I must survive\u2026\u201dMaybe this was what everyone realized. The struggle in front of us was no longer a story. Yoo Sangah asked in a trembling voice.\u201cSurely we don\u2019t have to fight like these people?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t need to fight. Just find a room that can accommodate a large number of people.\u201d\u201cThe size of the green zones vary by type. It ranged from fitting only one person to fitting 70 people like Gong Pildu\u2019s area.\u201cOf course, if there are any rooms left.\u201dJung Heewon opened her mouth at my words.\u201cDokja-ssi is really talented at making people uneasy\u2026 then let\u2019s move right away. Maybe there are some rooms left.\u201d\u201cIt might be faster to split up. Divide the team. Hyunsung-ssi will move with Sangah-ssi, while Heewon-ssi should take Gilyoung.\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine on my own.\u201dI didn\u2019t have to say anything else. Everyone trusted me. Lee Gilyoung spoke first.\u201cHyung, that\u2026what if we can\u2019t find one?\u201d\u201cIf we can\u2019t find a room 20 minutes before the scenario starts, we will gather here again.\u201d\u201cI understand. Then I\u2019m going.\u201dThe team scattered in an orderly fashion. Jung Heewon and Lee Gilyoung went to B2 while Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung went to B3. I watched my companions leave before turning on the smartphone. As soon as I opened Ways of Survival, a sentence immediately popped up.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u300c There were no rooms left in Chungmuro. \u300dThis fact was written clearly. It was likely that they wouldn\u2019t be able to find any rooms.Then they could only choose one way. In order to survive, kill someone else and take their room. But could Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon do it?Not everyone here was \u2018wicked.\u2019 There were some who exploited others, like Gong Pildu. But in fact, most of them bared their teeth in order to protect themselves.Could Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung bare their teeth to people like that? I would know the answer very soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Die!\u201d[There are 30 minutes before the third scenario is activated.]As pandemonium occurred around me, I was quietly reading Ways of Survival. Perhaps today\u2019s scenario would flow as I thought. In order to survive, I couldn\u2019t miss a single word.[What are you doing now?]Along with Bihyung\u2019s words, I could hear the messages of the constellations.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is wondering what you are doing.]I reflexively turned off my smartphone. There was something I hadn\u2019t thought of until now. Why didn\u2019t the constellations respond when I read Ways of Survival?In the original Ways of Survival, the constellations discovered that Yoo Jonghyuk was a regressor and raised questions about fairness. It was normal for them to say something about the text I was reading.[What are you doing right now with a blank notepad? All the constellations are going crazy with frustration because of you!]\u2026Blank notepad?I turned on the smartphone again. Ways of Destruction appeared on the screen.\u201cIs this what you are referring to?\u201d[Yes! What are you going to do with that notepad? You will die if you stay still! Ha, I believed in a guy like this and sighed a contract\u2026]I got goosebumps.The dokkaebi couldn\u2019t read this \u2018text.\u2019 If even the dokkaebis, which managed the system, couldn\u2019t read it then the constellations were the same.Then the writer who gave me the text\u2026what type of existence was he?\u201cKuaack!\u201dThe last scream rang out. Finally, the owner of the room on platform line 3 was determined.[Green Zone 1/1]\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t come any closer.\u201dA boy was pointing a knife at me. Surprisingly, the winner was the boy who guided us earlier. I still didn\u2019t know his name.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t take your room.\u201dI spoke in order to reassure the boy. The moment I had this thought.\u201cReally? You are quite relaxed Ahjussi. Do you want to die?\u201dI didn\u2019t need to look back to see who was talking.\u201cIt looks like you are quite free.\u201d\u201cNobody touches my room. I will send everyone who touches it to hell.\u201dLee Jihye twirled a deep blue blade round and round. In regards to specs, there was no one who could match Lee Jihye apart from Yoo Jonghyuk or people from the Landlord Alliance. Lee Jihye watched me carefully and opened her mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t want Ahjussi to die. You were quite impressive against Master earlier.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t die. It won\u2019t die even if I don\u2019t find a room.\u201dIt was true. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily die if I couldn\u2019t find a room. There was an impossible man in this station who proved this. It was only three days ago.Lee Jihye\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cAhjussi, do you know what you are saying right now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAhjussi, are you strong? As strong as Master?\u201dThen Yoo Jonghyuk appeared behind Lee Jihye.\u201cStop and go back to your room.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026yup. Master.\u201dLee Jihye obediently left and Yoo Jonghyuk turned towards me.\u201cAre you going to fight the monsters?\u201dI shrugged.\u201cYou will die. Your four companions as well.\u201d\u201cThat remains to be seen.\u201dThere was an unknown emotion in Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes as he glanced at me and left. I didn\u2019t use Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint. It wasn\u2019t always possible to expression emotions with words.[There are 20 minutes before the third scenario is activated.]There was the sound of people coming down the stairs. Lee Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung and Yoo Sangah\u2026 looking at their dark expressions, the result was as I expected. Yoo Sangah opened her mouth with a gloomy expression.\u201cRoom\u2026there were non.:\u201cIt is okay. Rather, where is Heewon-ssi?\u201d\u201cShe is trying to negotiate upstairs.\u201dAt these words, Jung Heewon jumped down with a terrible scream.\u201cOne night is 2,000 coins? Are they joking right now? I am really going to hit them.\u201dThe agitated Jung Heewon snorted and said.\u201cDokja-ssi. Do you know what is happening upstairs? No\u2015\u201d\u201cThey suddenly raised the taxes right?\u201d\u201cEh\u2026you already know?\u201dIt was predictable. The tenants would die if they couldn\u2019t get a room in 20 minutes. It was no wonder that the owners would take the initiative to raise the taxes.\u201cDid Dokja-ssi find anything?\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI examined their faces one by one. In the end, the time to choose had come.\u201cI have two ways.\u201dThe eyes of the party members shone at these words. But my methods would probably betray their expectations.\u201cThe first way is easy for all of us to live.\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cUsually it is the second method\u2026 what is the other one?\u201d\u201cThe second method is very difficult. It is likely that some of us will die.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026that can\u2019t happen. Then I will choose the first way.\u201d\u201cWhat do the others think?\u201dLee Hyunsung responded first.\u201cThe first method will be good if everyone can live.\u201dLee Gilyoung nodded. Only Yoo Sangah hesitated.\u201c\u2026Can I hear what it is?\u201dI nodded and lead them up the stairs to transit line 4.\u201cThis is the first method.\u201dThe party members looked at where I pointed. There was a group of five men and women shaking.[Green Zone 5/5]\u201cThey room they occupy has exactly five spaces. But their individual abilities isn\u2019t that high. Honestly, if the five of us\u2026\u201d\u201cWait, Dokja-ssi\u2015\u201d\u201cYes, kill them and take their room.\u201dTheir trembling increased at my calm voice. Jung Heewon made a deeply wounded expression.\u201c\u2026Who doesn\u2019t know about this method?\u201d\u201cIf Hyung says so, I can do it.\u201dLee Gilyoung spoke first.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid. I will do it.\u201d\u201cNo Gilyoung!\u201dYoo Sangah grabbed Lee Gilyoung\u2019s shoulder. I deliberately looked uncaring.\u201cThey would\u2019ve also killed someone to take that room. Honestly, we can\u2019t overcome future scenarios if we can\u2019t do this.\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi.\u201d Jung Heewon interrupted. \u201cI killed people at Gumho Station. I killed because I wanted to and I don\u2019t regret it. But.\u201dJung Heewon had a pained expression on her face.\u201cJust because I am a murderer doesn\u2019t mean I want to keep killing. I don\u2019t want to be a monster.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi, I would like to know about the second method.\u201dI closed my eyes for a moment at Lee Hyunsung\u2019s words.\u201cI understand your thoughts.\u201dYes, this was enough.\u201cLet\u2019s go the second way.\u201dThe expressions of the party members seemed to brighten. In fact, I was going to use the second method from the beginning.Killing was an easy way to survive, but I could never attract the attention of the constellations if I chose the easy method.However, the second method required considerable determination. It wasn\u2019t just me but everyone. Thus, I needed to check their determination. I had to know what these people were really thinking.Jung Heewon laughed.\u201c\u2026I thought so. Why are you talking when you were going to go with the second way?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to test you. Whatever choice you made, I would\u2019ve respected it.\u201dI stroked Lee Gilyoung\u2019s head, who was looking up at me with uneasy eyes. Yoo Sangah sighed and opened her mouth.\u201cDokja-ssi is really spiteful.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not a good person.\u201d\u201cWhat is the second method?\u201d\u201cThere is no need to kill anybody with this method. But it is very difficult.\u201dAt my heavy tone, the expressions of the party members became determined.\u201cIf you choose the second method, please unconditionally follow my instructions. Please trust me, even if it doesn\u2019t make sense. If one person doesn\u2019t trust me\u2015\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWe will all die.\u201dSomeone gulped. The party members nodded almost simultaneously. Lee Hyunsung said.\u201cI believe in Dokja-ssi. I have survived up to here because of Dokja-ssi.\u201d[There are 5 minutes before the third scenario is activated.]\u201cThen follow me.\u201dI moved with the party members along railway line 3. We passed through the broken screen door and stood at the entrance of the tunnel leading to Euljiro-3.Inside the dark tunnel, I saw a glowing \u2018red zone.\u2019 Perhaps the monsters would be created over there. They would sweep over line 3 and go up each floor towards the ground.Lee Hyunsung asked nervously.\u201c\u2026Then are we fighting the monsters here?\u201d\u201cNo, we aren\u2019t fighting. If we fight here then we will die.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t possible to fight against the terrifying monsters and survive until dawn without the green zone.This time, Jung Heewon asked.\u201c\u2026Then will we run towards the Dongdae area?\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t work. Once the scenario is activated, we will automatically die if we leave Chungmuro.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cThis operation needs to be shared. Lee Hyunsung-ssi, Yoo Sangah-ssi and Jung Heewon-ssi. Once the monsters appear, run straight in the direction they are coming from.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cUnderstood? Just run towards them. Just before you encounter them, be sure to look at the left wall. Then you will know that I mean.\u201dThe people didn\u2019t understand my words but there was no time to explain to them.\u201cJust trust me or you will die. Don\u2019t forget to look at the left wall.\u201d\u201cI understand Dokja-ssi.\u201d Yoo Sangah seemed to understand what I meant and answered first.\u201cI am telling you in person. You must run after the monster appears.\u201dI picked up a stone and threw it towards the tunnel. Then stone sparked as it hit something and fell. Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon nodded as if they understood.\u201cWhat about Dokja-ssi?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll find another way with Gilyoung.\u201dThis method couldn\u2019t be used unless my party members believed in me. Who would go against common sense and commit a suicide attack by rushing towards the monsters?The only thing left was their determination.[The third main scenario is enabled.]The barrier that was blocking the tunnel to Euljiro-3 disappeared.\u201cRun!\u201dThe three people started running the moment I called out.Grrr!The monsters started to be created in the red zone. It was mainly the grade 9 ground rats. Then the middle ranks were filled with the intermediate grade 9 underground species, the \u2018groll.\u2019Kuooooh!A monster with a black mane that was in the shape of a bear. The sharp horns on their foreheads was threatening.One was relatively easy to deal with. The problem was the number. The crowded columns was already not suitable to be called a \u2018group.\u2019 We would die if we hit that wave.The moment Lee Hyunsung encountered the first groll, I shouted.\u201cNow!\u201dYoo Sangah found it first. Green tiles shimmering on the wall.\u201cAh\u2015!\u201dThe enlightenment was instant The moment Yoo Sangah\u2019s hand touched the wall, it emitted a bright light.[Green Zone 1/3]The agile Jung Heewon immediately touched the wall behind her.[Green Zone 2/3]However, Lee Hyunsung missed the timing. It was because the ground rats clung to Lee Hyunsung\u2019s shield.\u201cHyunsung-ssi! Catch it!\u201dLee Hyunsung grabbed the \u2018thread\u2019 that Yoo Sangah threw him. Thanks to the strength of the two women, Lee Hyunsung flew through the air and reached the wall.[Green Zone 3/3]Good.Grrrrrrr!The monsters stared at them but once they entered the green zones, the monsters couldn\u2019t attack.\u201cDokja-ssi!\u201dYoo Sangah called out to me but there was no time to look back. I was already running with Lee Gilyoung on my back.\u300c \u2026In the third main scenario, there are several hidden green zones. This is activated on a specific wall and the green zones on the wall won\u2019t appear until after the scenario starts\u2026 if you think about it, humans were the ones who thought of it as the concept of a \u2018room\u2019. \u300dIn Ways of Survival, Yoo Jonghyuk went through numerous regressions and found some secret green zones in Chungmuro.On the platform of line 3, there were two such green zones.Kiiiiit!A few ground rats chasing after me bit me in the thigh. The blow wasn\u2019t big because of my high strength, but these small things could accumulate.Kwack!Lee Gilyoung hit a few ground rats with a blunt weapon from his position on my back. But there were too many of them. In addition, the groll were fast.A dozen metres away, the boy was looking at me with terrified eyes.[Green Zone 1/1]It was cowardly but I was tempted to take the easy road for a second.[Hahahaha! This situation is fun. Then like yesterday, should there be a penalty?]A dokkaebi spoke followed by the system messages.[A scenario penalty has been added!][Some existing green zones will be disabled.]\u201cN-No! Uack, aaaaack!\u201dScreams rang through Chungmuro Station. The closest scream came from the boy.Kwajijijik!\u201cAaaaack!\u201dAs soon as the green zone disappeared, the boy\u2019s small body was shredded by the ground rats.Thanks to the boy\u2019s body buying time, I was able to run into the passage. However, the monsters that came from beyond the broken screen door blocked the path.I hid Lee Gilyoung behind me and pulled out Unbroken Faith. The blade of White Pure Star Energy quickly pushed back the incoming monsters.But the numbers didn\u2019t go down at all. The person who fought with these monsters until sunrise, Yoo Jonghyuk was a monster. I wasn\u2019t sure it was possible for me, even if I changed all my coins to stats.At this moment, Lee Gilyoung spoke.\u201cHyung, you know.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk now. I\u2019m busy.\u201d\u201cYou can just leave me here.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t understand it. Why are you helping me, Hyunsung hyung and the noonas? If you are alone\u2026 you would be able to survive better.\u201dHe could calmly speak such words before his death. Maybe this kid\u2019s mind was already dead.\u201cYes, you are right.\u201d Another ground rat fell to the ground with its head cut off. \u201cIt is comfortable to live alone, eat alone and survive alone. But\u2026\u201dWhy was I acting this way? If anyone asked me, I couldn\u2019t exactly explain. But I could say one thing with certainty.\u201cI know one novel that developed in such a way and was ruined.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHuh?\u201dI thought it every time but I wasn\u2019t a protagonist. I wouldn\u2019t be a hero or a savior. But\u2026Lee Gilyoung\u2019s eyes were shaking. I lifted him onto my back again and said.\u201cHold on tight.\u201dI wouldn\u2019t let Lee Gilyoung die. At least, not today.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The level 15 strength condensed at once and my feet developed a strong propulsion force.The ground rats ran from all directions and the hard horns of the grolls flew from unexpected places.My skin, which was tempered by the level 15 stamina, became bruised and bloody from the grolls\u2019 horns.[The number one bookmark has been activated.]Bookmark was activated and Kim Namwoon\u2019s Blackening wrapped around my body. I pushed away all the monsters coming from the front.Fangs burrowed into my body and a few ground rats bit my thighs. However, I didn\u2019t stop. Run and run again.Over here. Finally, the original wall was visible. I jumped over the ground rats. There was a green zone for two people shining.By the way\u2026shit.[Green Zone 1/2]There was already someone inside.\u201c\u2026\u201dI forgot about the monsters coming from behind and stared at him. There was a guy who should never be there.\u201cHey.\u201dHe turned to me.\u201cCan\u2019t you get out? You don\u2019t even need to stay in here.\u201d\u201cIt is difficult. I am tired today.\u201dI pushed to punch this asshole\u2019s face. I didn\u2019t understand. This wasn\u2019t the \u2018third regression\u2019 Yoo Jonghyuk that I knew.In Ways of Survival, it was written that Yoo Jonghyuk only found the first hidden green zone in the fourth regression\u2026 damn, did he know about this place since the second regression and it just wasn\u2019t described? Then why didn\u2019t he originally use it in the third regression?Grrrr!There were the cries of the ground rats chasing me from behind. It was too late to blame the writer. I could feel Lee Gilyoung\u2019s breathing. I stared into Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes. We spoke at almost the same time.\u201cTake the kid.\u201d\u201cGive me the child.\u201dStill, it was lucky. The constellations would hear my words.[Green Zone 2/2]I moved Lee Gilyoung and the mark of the green zone changed. Now Lee Gilyoung was safe.\u201cHyung! Wait a minute! Hyung!\u201dLee Gilyoung urgently tried to rush towards me but Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s hand restrained him. I swung my sword towards the ground rats.[The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 has closed his eyes.][The constellation Demon-like Judge of Fire is watching you with uncomfortable eyes.]At the last minute, Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes seemed to move.\u300c I told you that you would die. \u300dThe waves of monsters headed towards me. Now there were no more green zones remaining.\u201cI won\u2019t die.\u201dI ignored the monsters and put a hand in my pocket. In fact, I really didn\u2019t want to use this. I couldn\u2019t be assured that there would be no aftereffects. Now I had to believe in the Fourth Wall.\u300c That\u2026? \u300dYoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes shook with surprise. This bastard, did he find out? Well, I wouldn\u2019t have known this method without him.I looked down at the white stone shining in the palm of my hand.[Specter\u2019s Stone.]It was an item I gained by hunting specters on the way to Chungmuro.Hundreds of ground rats started biting at my body.I was bleeding from minor wounds and the shoulders struck by the grolls\u2019 horns were red with blood. As the durability of my body rapidly diminished, I put the stone into my mouth.Then something like water vapor started to emerge from my mouth. The water vapor formed a fog that covered me.[The Welcome Prison is activated.]The ground rats and grolls stopped attacking me at once.Everything around me started to distort. The platform, Yoo Jonghyuk and Lee Gilyoung calling out to me.I became a \u2018ghost.\u2019*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u300c Dokja. \u300dI noticed as soon as I heard my mother\u2019s voice. This was a dream.I tried not to get caught up in it but it wasn\u2019t easy this time. The floor sank like a quagmire and swallowed me.[Due to excessive immersion, the influence of Fourth Wall has temporarily weakened.]Scenes started to weave in front of me, no matter what I wanted.A living room covered with blood. The cold body of a man. The back of a woman looking down at the body. No. This memory was difficult to remember. I couldn\u2019t remember it.I shook my head furiously and the scene in front of me scattered. This damn trauma\u2026It was a memory I didn\u2019t want to see.This was why I was reluctant to eat the Specter\u2019s Stone. The Specter\u2019s Stone temporarily made the user a \u2018ghost\u2019 and turned them invisible to monsters. But it has a side effect of causing the user\u2019s trauma to peak.That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t give it to the other party members. If it had been used by someone other than myself, they might\u2019ve turned into a madman.I had to endure, even if my head was hurting like crazy.Certainly, the Fourth Wall was a scam. The skill would even be able to eat away at this stone. I wouldn\u2019t see this effect even with the superior \u2018Mental Barrier.\u2019 Where was it? If my guess was correct, this skill\u2026\u300c Yoo Jonghyuk? Are you Yoo Jonghyuk? \u300dI thought a trauma had started again but it wasn\u2019t my voice. It wasn\u2019t a voice created by my memories. I looked back and saw a strange woman.\u300c \u2026You aren\u2019t Yoo Jonghyuk. I think you are Korean but who are you? \u300dA dazzling blonde foreigner. She was a little girl with a short height. The girl looked at me for a long time with an incomprehensible expression.\u300c That\u2026I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve seen the future a number of times but I\u2019ve never seen you before\u2026 \u300dIn the girl\u2019s left eye, an ominous red swirl could be seen. The pages flashed in my head. I knew this person. No, there was absolutely no way I couldn\u2019t know her. In this case\u2026[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.][The character \u2018Anna Croft\u2019 is using \u2018Mental Barrier Lv. 6\u2019.][Character List ignores Mental Barrier Lv. 6.][There is too much information about this person.

Who are you? \u300dHer small lips were tightly closed. It looked as though she was protesting.I anticipated how the situation would roughly occur. The woman noticed my presence, perhaps because the influence of Fourth Wall temporarily weakened. If Fourth Wall was really the skill I thought it was\u2026By the way\u2026 it was disappointing.\u201cDo you really not know who I am?\u201d\u300c \u2026Huh? \u300d\u201cDidn\u2019t I send you the ichthyosaur\u2019s core?\u201dAnna\u2019s lips slowly widened.\u201cYou must\u2019ve implanted the \u2018great demon\u2019s eyes\u2019 with the power of the core.

Wait across the continent.\u201d[The exclusive skill Fourth Wall has been completely restored.]Anna completely disappeared.I sighed with relief. In fact, my spirit had been fluctuating back and forth when talking to Anna Croft. It wasn\u2019t very good.[Due to the skill effect, immunity to Welcome Prison has occurred.]\u2026Dammit, the effect took place too late.I felt my consciousness clear up.The discomfort still remained but it was much better than before. I took a deep breath and slowly exhaled. I looked at the distinct facts one by one in order to regain my rationality.I am Kim Dokja. The world was destroyed. Ways of Survival had become reality. This was\u2026Welcome Prison. I ate the Specter\u2019s Stone and was a ghost for a while. If I was a ghost, I wouldn\u2019t be attacked by the underground species.Yes, that\u2019s right. So\u2026 the world looked like this.In the midst of the landscape that seemed like I had eaten drugs, the flow of time was hardly noticeable. I became a bit uneasy.What happened to Yoo Sangah, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon? That Jonghyuk bastard, did he kill Gilyoung? Was the third scenario still in progress? What if there were still ground rats around? Were the grolls circling in order to eat me?If so\u2026\u2026Hyung.\u2026Please.\u2026Dokja-ssi!Voices flashed through my head.[The exclusive skill \u2018Permanent Lv. 1\u2019 is activated.](TL: Temporary name.

We did it.I looked at the agitated party members and tried to move my body. I had remained stiff for a long time and my muscles barely listened to me.\u201cDon\u2019t be\u2026pleased.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cOnly one day has passed. Yesterday was the third day\u2026\u201dLee Hyunsung caught me as I tried to get up.\u201cDokja-ssi! It isn\u2019t possible.

By the way, there was a face missing.\u201cWhere is Gilyoung?\u201d\u201cAh, Gilyoung\u2026\u201dBefore Jung Heewon spoke, I already discovered where Jung Heewon was. Lee Jihye and Yoo Jonghyuk were looking down at Lee Gilyoung a few steps away.\u2026No, what was that bastard Yoo Jonghyuk doing?At this moment, I remembered how Yoo Jonghyuk was surprised when he saw my party. Don\u2019t tell me, when Yoo Jonghyuk used Sage\u2019s Eyes\u2026?\u201cWhen\u2026 you have chosen? Obvious never\u2026before.\u201dDue to the aftereffects of using the stone, Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t heard properly. Then Lee Gilyoung started talking.\u201cIt is okay.\u201d\u201c\u2026You really won\u2019t go with me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou can become much stronger with me than with him.

What was he talking about?I had to think\u2026 Damn, I\u2019m too tired.

It was a sweet sleep without any dreams.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0*I woke up two hours later.[Hey, how long are you going to sleep?]I opened my eyes at the loud and unpleasant voice. This time, the texture against my cheek was much thicker and harder than before.\u201c\u2026Ah, Dokja-ssi woke up.\u201dSmiling lips. Jung Heewon was looking down at me.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi took a break. We didn\u2019t sleep well last night.\u201dI turned my head and saw Yoo Sangah sleeping against a wall. Jung Heewon smiled.\u201cBy the way, is Lee Hyunsung\u2019s thigh comfortable?\u201dI turned and saw Lee Hyunsung drooling.\u201cToday in the morning\u2026 the on-call officer will conduct the duties\u2026\u201d\u2026I thought the height of the pillow wasn\u2019t right. It turned out to be Lee Hyunsung\u2019s thigh. It was an army pillow with a bloody smell.\u201cDokja hyung\u2026\u201dI felt a heavy feeling on my stomach and looked down to see Lee Gilyoung leaning against me and sleeping.The moment I carefully raised my body, I heard Bihyung\u2019s voice.[Haha, you are awake?

Unfortunately, there was no detailed description of the location of the green zones on day four in Ways of Survival.\u201cThen\u2026\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s expression became dark. But it was unnecessary worry.\u201cToday we will completely end the third scenario.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dI carefully laid Lee Gilyoung and got up.It wasn\u2019t originally planned but I couldn\u2019t wait after hearing Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s thoughts.

It is a skill that understands people well.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know if I want to ask, so I won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cBut have you ever used it on me?\u201dI almost showed emotions on my face. It was fortunate that Jung Heewon didn\u2019t have Lie Detection. I looked at Lee Gilyoung and said.\u201cI only use it on men.\u201d\u201cOh my.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a lie. I haven\u2019t read Jung Heewon\u2019s heart. So far.\u201cAnyway, I am asking everyone to do this. First is Jung Heewon-ssi, then Yoo Sangah and Gilyoung is last. Please take it in turns to speak to him.\u201d\u201c\u2019Oh my, I really believe in Hyunsung-ssi!\u2019 That type of feeling?\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t go so far.\u201d\u201cSigh, I am really going to die.\u201dStill, she needed to do it. In order for this plan to succeed, Lee Hyunsung\u2019s \u2018attribute evolution\u2019 was absolutely necessary. I would\u2019ve planned a bit sooner if I knew Yoo Jonghyuk would act like this\u2026 but if we tried hard, I should be able to see the result today.In fact, they seemed to be doing well.\u201cHyunsung-ssi is really dependable. You are like a pine tree.\u201d\u201cHaha, thank you Heewon-ssi. My favourite song is Green Pine.\u201d[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 feels proud.]\u201cI didn\u2019t ask.\u201d[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 feels a bit sullen.]\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a righteous person like Hyunsung-ssi.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 that isn\u2019t the case. Still, thank you. Yoo Sangah-ssi.\u201d[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has started to worry about justice.]\u201cHyunsung hyung has the best muscles.\u201d\u201cThank you, everyone.\u201d[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has increased his self-esteem.]It was fortunate that Lee Hyunsung was a simple person and such empty praises worked well. After repeating the same conversation several times like this, the system messages started to change.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 is waiting for a chance to evolve his attribute.]Okay. It went smoothly.Yoo Sangah asked in a slightly worried tone. \u201cBut I think Hyunsung-ssi is a bit burdened\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah was really nice. Even in this situation, she was concerned about someone else\u2019s heart. I didn\u2019t have that ability.\u201cMaybe a bit. But It is necessary. There are some people in the world who become stronger as they carry more burdens.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. And\u2026Gilyoung, did you do what I asked?\u201d\u201cYes Hyung.\u201dLee Gilyoung replied from next to Yoo Sangah. On his head, there was a pair of small cockroaches like they were antennae.\u201cThat noona, she is on B1.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dLee Hyunsung was good. Now it was time to steal the power of others.I walked up the stairs alone. The people of the Landlord Alliance welcomed me as I went up.\u201cHaha, who is this? If it isn\u2019t the illegal tenant.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are coming up here after doing well. Did you really survive yesterday without a room? Did Yoo Jonghyuk help you?\u201dI ignored them and kept walking. The Landlord Alliance members kept talking, as if they thought I was scared.\u201cIsn\u2019t it hard to live with Yoo Jonghyuk? Enter our alliance. Pildu-ssi said he would let you.\u201dI didn\u2019t care and counted the remaining green zones on every floor. One, two, three\u2026 in order for this plan to succeed, I couldn\u2019t miss a single one.\u201cOf course, under the condition that you bring both women.\u201dNow there were 11 green zones remaining. The number had reduced a lot after yesterday\u2019s scenario. It was a close number to carry out the plan.\u201cHey, are you ignoring me now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m listening. Tell him I\u2019m thinking about it.\u201dThe alliance members looked at each other and chuckled at my words. They could laugh like that now.I was walking up the escalator when a blade suddenly reached my neck. I felt very few signs it was coming\u2026 there was only one skill that boasted this type of concealed movements in the beginning.[Ghost Walk.]\u201cI\u2019m disappointed, Ahjussi.\u201dLee Jihye. A proud girl with outstanding fighting skills. She wasn\u2019t chosen by the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare for nothing.\u201cAhjussi, don\u2019t you know what will happen to those women if you make a deal with them?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cDo you really know? Yesterday, wouldn\u2019t you rather die?\u201dI shrugged.\u201cPut away the sword. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d\u201cTalk? You came to find me on purpose.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLee Jihye put away the sword. I followed behind Lee Jihye. Lee Jihye walked from B1 to the ticket barrier at the entrance. We seemed to walk for a while.\u201cWhat did you want to talk about?\u201d\u201cBut why are you standing there?\u201d\u201cMaster told me to defend this place.\u201d\u201c\u2026Defend?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t let you pass.\u201dLee Jihye touched the ticket gate and drew her hand across her neck. I looked at the passage beyond the ticket gate. There were exit numbers leading to the ground. But not all numbers led to the ground. At that moment, I had an ominous feeling.\u2026That Yoo Jonghyuk, surely he wasn\u2019t trying that route?If Yoo Jonghyuk wanted to protect this place, there was only one reason.As the scenario was in progress, he was secretly trying to attack the \u2018hidden dungeon\u2019 of Chungmuro. Hidden dungeon attack. It sounded good. In fact, it wasn\u2019t bad if the main character became stronger.The problem was that this dungeon was a place that Yoo Jonghyuk couldn\u2019t clear until the end of the third regression. It looked like I should finish this quickly.\u201cI need your help.\u201d\u201cMy help?\u201d\u201cToday, I will shatter Gong Pildu\u2019s party.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you serious?\u201dLee Jihye looked at me like she was trying to see my heart.[Your understanding of the character \u2018Lee Jihye\u2019 has increased.]\u201cAhjussi isn\u2019t strong enough. You won\u2019t be able to get rid of them.\u201d\u201cEven if you help me?\u2019Lee Jihye\u2019s head jerked like her pride was damaged.It was natural. Lee Jihye had already challenged Gong Pildu the first day she came to this station. Then she ran away. If Yoo Jonghyuk hadn\u2019t appeared to rescue her, she would be dead.\u201cI have a way. I can do it if you help me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Master told me to stay here.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t help, most of the people here will die.\u201d\u201cPeople will die anyway.\u201d\u201cDid Yoo Jonghyuk say that?\u201dLee Jihye\u2019s eyes shook.\u201cThe boy we talked to yesterday is dead. Do you understand?\u201d\u201c\u2026I know.\u201d\u201cMaybe he could\u2019ve lived. Then today, he would be rushing at us to tell us about Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cYoo Jonghyuk killed him. He could\u2019ve saved him.\u201dI felt complicated while talking. I noticed that I wasn\u2019t much different from Yoo Jonghyuk. The subway, Gumho Station\u2026 I ignored people I might\u2019ve been able to save because my safety was being threatened.But hypocrites could speak plausible words.\u201cI saw the video of your scenario when I was on the subway.\u201dLee Jihye\u2019s small shoulders shook.\u201cIt was a video where you killed your friend to survive.\u201d\u201c\u2026Stop.\u201d\u201cIn fact, you didn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d[The character \u2018Lee Jihye\u2019 is greatly disturbed.]\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d\u201cI know what I know. Of course I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just talking to myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut since I am talking, I wanted to say this. If you turn away today, you will regret it for the rest of your life. Definitely.\u201d[The character \u2018Lee Jihye\u2019 has fallen into deep agony.]I didn\u2019t know the \u2018human\u2019 Lee Jihye but I knew the \u2018character\u2019 Lee Jihye. This girl was a loyal subordinate of Yoo Jonghyuk. But that was a story for the future, not now. She admired Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s strength but she was essentially different from Yoo Jonghyuk.Lee Jihye opened her mouth a few minutes later.\u201cIf I help, people can live?\u201d\u201cNot everyone, but some will survive.\u201d\u201c\u2026What should I do?\u201d\u201cI will start at 7 o\u2019clock this evening.\u201dI told her the plan. In order to implement this plan, Lee Jihye needed to do the things I told her.Lee Jihye stared blankly and opened her mouth.\u201cAre you sane? You will really do this?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026Honestly, I don\u2019t think it will work. I\u2019ll tell you in advance. I don\u2019t think I can help.\u201d\u201cThe choice is yours.\u201dShe said this but Lee Jihye would surely move.

Every member was checking their weapons. Lee Hyunsung seemed to have handled it properly.\u201cI did as Dokja-ssi asked.\u201dSince the weapons they had used so far were very old, I asked Lee Hyunsung to produce new weapons. The materials were from the grade 8 underground species, the groll that were killed in the struggle last night. The blades and spears were made by cutting the horns of the groll. They weren\u2019t long enough but they were appropriate as a temporary measure.Jung Heewon smiled like she was satisfied.\u201cIsn\u2019t this much lighter and durable?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Dokja-ssi, Hyunsung-ssi. Thank you very much.\u201dYoo Sangah bowed. The groll\u2019s horn couldn\u2019t be used to make a blunt weapon so only Lee Gilyoung was still carrying a weapon from a ground rat. Lee Gilyoung was silently gazing at the ground. This sulking child\u2026 I stroked his head and said.\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy. This situation can be more dangerous than yesterday. Are you all ready?\u201dThe party members nodded.\u201cThen we will start.\u201dFrom now on, it was a fight against time. We had to work as quickly as possible before the Landlord Alliance noticed the situation. Jung Heewon, Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung disappeared to their respective floors for their missions, while I started climbing the stairs with Lee Hyunsung.Lee Hyunsung spoke in a voice without any confidence.\u201cDokja-ssi, I am unsure.\u201d\u2026He was the core of this operation. He shouldn\u2019t be talking like this. I deliberately answered in a strong voice.\u201cIt will be fine.\u201dHowever, Lee Hyunsung\u2019s face was still timid.\u201cI think that people are relying on me more than they should. I\u2019m not sure I can do well.\u201d\u201cHyunsung-ssi is a dependable person.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you for saying so. In fact, this is my first experience. When I was in the army, I never got someone\u2019s trust like this.\u201dIt was the first time I\u2019ve heard this story. That reminded me, I didn\u2019t really know about Lee Hyunsung\u2019s army life. Ways of Survival only mentioned it in passing.\u201cOnce this is over, I want to hear Hyunsung-ssi\u2019s story.\u201dI said it casually but Lee Hyunsung was more shaken than I thought.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has started to open his heart to you.][Your understanding of the character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has greatly increased.]\u201cSometimes I feel strange when talking to Dokja-ssi.\u201d\u201cHuh? Why\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt seems like you knew me from a long time ago\u2026 I can\u2019t explain it well\u2026\u201d Lee Hyunsung scratched his head and trailed off. \u201cAh, I don\u2019t mean anything strange. I just\u2026\u201d\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d\u201cThank you. I\u2019m also curious about Dokja-ssi\u2019s story.\u201d\u201cMy story?\u201d\u201cYes. I have never seen a person like Dokja-ssi before. I\u2019m curious about what you did before this happened.\u201dSomehow, I felt a bit strange. The \u2018supporting cast\u2019 of the novel I read was curious about me. I had a bit uncomfortable and had an itchy feeling.\u201cIt isn\u2019t very interesting.\u201d\u201cI still want to hear it.\u201dSuddenly, a question popped into my head.If Ways of Survival hadn\u2019t become reality, would Lee Hyunsung be living in the same world as me? Or did the novel suddenly emerge as a reality? I didn\u2019t know. One thing was for sure. Lee Hyunsung was now a \u2018living person\u2019 in front of me.\u201cOh, Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s friend. Did you come to negotiate?\u201dAt this time, a number of middle-aged men came forward. Chungmuro\u2019s Landlord Alliance.\u201cHmm\u2026but where are the women?\u201dThe middle-aged man who spoke was holding a woman by her hair. She was part of the group that had been in the five spaces green zone just yesterday. The man laughed at my gaze.\u201cAhh, this friend didn\u2019t see her land\u2026 This matter doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d\u201cS-Save me. Help me!\u201dThe woman was gazing at me pitifully. In my head, the constellations of the \u2018absolute good\u2019 started clamoring. But I waited. It was because I had someone who would act instead of me.\u201cLet her go.\u201dIt was Lee Hyunsung.\u201cWho are you?\u201dLee Hyunsung looked at me after the middle-aged man\u2019s question. It was like he was asking for permission. I nodded.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 wants to practice justice of his own will.][The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 is about to evolve.]The allied members pulled out their weapons and exerted a tremendous momentum.

A big and small uproar followed. It was the signal.\u201cHyunsung-ssi!\u201dLee Hyunsung nodded. We ran forward towards the men in the front row. The confused alliance members shouted.\u201cWhat, you bastards!\u201d[The exclusive skill \u2018White Pure Star Energy\u2019 has been activated.]Sukakak!\u201cKyaaak!\u201dThe arm of the middle-aged man holding the woman\u2019s head flew away. The middle-aged men froze at the blood that emerged. Lee Hyunsung and I ignored them and kept running. The middle-aged men belatedly chased after us.\u201cThese crazy guys! Stop them!\u201dA corridor on B2. It was the private land of Gong Pildu.[You have invaded private property!]\u201cSurround them!\u201dThe alliance members waiting in front discovered us. Some of the alliance members were missing, so there were less than expected. 20 in the back, 12 in the back. However, it was still a lot of people.Well, I had no intention of dealing with all of them.The moment I was about to clash with the alliance members, Lee Hyunsung moved ahead of me with a steel shield.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has used the stigma \u2018Great Mountain Push Lv. 1.\u2019]Kwakakakak!Lee Hyunsung used his tremendous muscle strength and they fell like dominoes.[The character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 has activated \u2018Armed Zone Lv. 4!]Turrets started to rise from all over the territory. The turrets were charged with red magic bullets and were prepared to fire. There were five mini-turrets. The level of Armed Zone had rised again.\u201cDokja-ssi!\u201dI overtook Lee Hyunsung and at the same time, I received his shield. As soon as the solid shield entered my hand, a stunning shock from a bullet pushed me away.Kwang!\u00a0Kwaang!\u00a0Kwaang!It was heavy, as if I was hit by a cannon.

He looked uneasy and irritated, but there was also a firm determination not to retreat.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has evolved.]There was a blinding light and silver aura started to appear around Lee Hyunsung\u2019s bdoy.I was a bit emotional at the sight.

Maybe the constellations in the channel with Gong Pildu would be in a frenzy right now.\u2018What channel is Gong Pildu in?\u2019[\u2026Biryu\u2019s channel.

That\u2019s why their broadcasts were radical. Great. Then the response within the channel would be much hotter than expected. Everyone would\u2019ve eaten the sweet potatoes properly.I headed down the stairs of the transfer corridor to line 4 and saw a welcome face. The blade was moving through the air.\u201cYou broke them?\u201d\u201cYes. It was easy.\u201dLee Jihye\u2019s role was to take out the green zones that contained five to eight people. It was a task that Jung Heewon would find hard to do alone. Indeed, she was Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s disciple and was the incarnation of the sage hero. Now there were no more green zones left in Chungmuro.\u201cNow what? Those jerks will come running wildly. Ah, there they are.\u201dLee Jihye\u2019s expression twisted as she looked behind me.\u201cI\u2019m not going to help you this time.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201dJung Heewon scowled as she watched Lee Jihye retreating.\u201cWhat is with her?\u201dCome to think of it, Jung Heewon didn\u2019t know about Lee Jihye. But there was no time to tell her.[Haha\u2026 you are fucked now.]A message was heard along with Bihyung\u2019s words.[A bounty scenario has occurred!]+[Bounty Scenario \u2013 Assassination Commission]Category: SubDifficulty: CClear Conditions: The constellations of Channel #BIR-3642 have requested to kill a certain person. Please kill \u2018Kim Dokja\u2019 of Chungmuro Station.Time Limit: 10 minutes.Compensation: 2,000 coins.Failure: None+I thought this situation would unfold. It was going to be a lot of fun. Now all the incarnations in the region would gather on the platform of line 3 to catch me. Jung Heewon asked by his side.\u201cI will receive 2,000 coins if I kill Dokja-ssi right now?\u201d\u201cWhy, are you going to kill me?\u201d\u201cAye, perhaps. If you give me 200,000 coins then I don\u2019t know.\u201dDoes this girl know how much 200,000 coins were worth?\u201cDokja-ssi. Go behind me.\u201dLee Hyunsung stepped out ahead of me. Jung Heewon stayed beside me while Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung moved to block any access. It was a defense formed around me. Jung Heewon smiled.\u201cNow I can pay back my debt.\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi, we\u2019ll try to block it somehow.\u201dThere were people showing hostility around us. The angry landowners and the tenants were blinded by the bounty quest. I watched Lee Gilyoung holding the weapon and opened my mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous.\u201dI lightly stroked Lee Gilyoung\u2019s shoulder and moved towards the railway tracks.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to fight them.\u201dIt was a few turns. I had read about such a scene. I didn\u2019t have time to check which regression it was but Yoo Jonghyuk had destroyed the green zones as soon as he arrived at Chungmuro.Even then, it was like the current situation.[All green zones in this region have been destroyed and the main scenario has collapsed.][The difficulty is automatically adjusted according to the remaining schedule of the scenario.][The scenario content is updated!]+[Main Scenario #3 \u2013 Emergency Defense]Category: MainDifficulty: B-Clear Conditions: All the green zones in the region are destroyed and the monsters that were going to be created in the remaining days have suddenly run wild.

In other words, it was simple.[The emergency defense has begun!]The defense game had started.\u201cW-What?\u201dThe people approaching me started screaming. The cries of monsters were heard from outside the screen door. The feast of monsters moved like an angry wave.\u201cCrazy! What the hell is this?\u201dThe platform of line 3 quickly became a mess. The faces of the people became speculative as they watched the monsters coming from all sides. The bounty scenario was completely forgotten about.Grrrr!A few grolls ran and bit some of the alliance members. The upset people were shouting.Now was the only chance. I shouted to my party.\u201cGo to the transfer route!\u201dI started jumping up the transit stairs with my friends. By the time we reached the upper level, people were blocking the path.\u201cWhat? Get out of the way!\u201d\u201cDo you want to fall?\u201dI kicked some of the followers and pulled out a blade. The people were surprised by the White Pure Star Energy blade and backed away.\u201cYou haven\u2019t grasped the situation yet.\u201d\u201cW-What?\u201d\u201cEven if you come up, you won\u2019t be able to survive.\u201dThere was a sense of despair in the expressions of the people. There were no more rooms. Now there were no more safe zones from the monsters in Chungmuro.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\u201cWhat else? Fight.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t speak crazy words! This is all because of you! If you hadn\u2019t broken our rooms\u2026!\u201dI triggered the Blade of Faith and used it on the transfer stairs.Kwarurung!\u201cUwaaaaack!\u201dThe centre of the staircase fell with a large sound, along with the people. It was cruel but necessary.\u201cCrazy! Quickly find another staircase! Quickly!\u201dWell, I don\u2019t think it would happen.Lee Hyunsung was already running. I smashed the transit stairs we came up on and there was only one staircase remaining. Subsequently, the sound of arguing and something breaking was heard on the other side.\u201cShit! Waaah!\u201dThe cries of the people trapped on the platform of line 3 were heard. Lee Jihye approached me and asked.\u201cAhjussi. This isn\u2019t what you told me. If you leave it like this\u2026\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dI looked at the lower floor that was becoming pandemonium. If I left it like this, they would all be killed. Whether it was from the monsters or using each other\u2019s bodies as a stepping stone to come upstairs.This wasn\u2019t what I wanted.[The exclusive skill \u2018Bookmark\u2019 can now be activated.][\u2018Character Bookmarks\u2019 is activated.][Available Bookmark Slots: 3][Bringing up the list of available bookmarks.][People Listed in the Bookmark Slots]I activated the third bookmark.[The number three bookmark has been activated.][The level of the Bookmark skill is low, shortening the activation time.][Activation Time:\u00a0 5 minutes.][Your understanding of the character is low, so only a part of the character\u2019s skill is activated.][Incite Lv.2 has been activated.]Suddenly, it felt like my tongue was coming alive on its own. This was how Cheon Inho felt. I looked downstairs. In the middle of the mess, I could see a middle-aged man.\u201cHey Gong Pildu. How long are you going to stand there?\u201dGong Pildu glared at me.\u201cThis dog\u2026!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you have to act in order to live? If you move, everyone else can live.\u201dThe power of Incite permeated the ears of all the frightened people.\u201cP-Pildu-ssi!\u201d\u201cP-Pildu-ssi, please save us!\u201dGong Pildu\u2019s expression distorted. I felt good. This was what Cheon Inho would\u2019ve felt at Gumho Station.\u201cThe third scenario isn\u2019t as hard as you think. Once everyone gives up on the rooms and participates in the defense, there are enough people to handle the monsters.\u201dMy words were half true. If Chungmuro had united before I arrived here, there would be far less victims. After all, the biggest pitfall of this scenario was the green zone.\u201cIf Gong Pildu fights with the people, you can survive.\u201dThose who fight together would survive, those who ran away would die.[The sponsor behind Lee Jihye agrees with your wisdom.][The constellation \u2018Maritime War God\u2019 nods his head.]\u201cNow there are no rooms for you to run away to. Forget about whether you are a landlord or tenant and fight. Or you will all die.\u201dThe more urgent the situation was, the more the effect of Incite would increase.\u201cDamn, this fucking guy\u2026!\u201d\u201cPildu-ssi! Please help us!\u201dThe alliance members gathered around Gong Pildu. If he ran away here alone, Gong Pildu\u2019s Landlord Alliance would collapse. In the end Gong Pildu made his decision.\u201cDammit\u2026 Everybody gather here!\u201dThe people downstairs started gathering around Gong Pildu.\u201cI need time to install a new Armed Zone. Everybody just hang on!\u201dThe key was Gong Pildu\u2019s Armed Zone. However, the weak point was that Armed Zone took time to install every time it moved.Blood splattered everywhere and people screamed as their limbs were torn off.\u201cAaaagh!\u201dAs expected, the first ones who abandoned the formation were the tenants, not the alliance members.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes. Please leave it to me.\u201dI didn\u2019t need to explain it. Yoo Sangah already understood what she needed to do.Her Binding Thread stretched out and started to rescue the people who couldn\u2019t fight anymore. In any case, their mission was to buy time for Gong Pildu to deploy Armed Zone.\u201cU-Uhh\u2026 t-thank you.\u201dThe tenants hung from the threat and were pulled upstairs.The rescued tenants were shaking as they wrapped up their injured area. In the meantime, some of the people with weapons carefully looked at me. I smiled at them and said.\u201cOh, do you want the bounty?\u201d[The time limit for the bounty scenario has expired.][The bounty hanging on Kim Dokja has been destroyed.]\u201cSorry, it is too late.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe tenants seemed ashamed as they put away their weapons.

The red magic bullets condensed in a short time and started firing.Dududududu!Kwang!\u00a0Kwaang!\u00a0Kwaang!The ground rats screamed as they were hit by the bombardment of magic bullets while the grolls came to a halt. The group of people cried out.\u201cAs expected of Pildu-ssi!\u201d\u201cWahhhh!\u201dIt was truly Gong Pildu. In a defense type scenario, there was no incarnation that surpassed a player\u2019s combat effectiveness.The 10 Evils weren\u2019t called that for nothing.\u201cAll of you damn scum disappear!\u201dThe agitated Gong Pildu randomly fired. Lee Hyunsung spoke with admiration.\u201cIt is a really tremendous stigma. Is it okay when the magic power consumption is so big?\u201d\u201cIt is a good stigma so it will be okay for a while.\u201d\u201cShould we help\u2026?\u201d\u201cGong Pildu alone is sufficient. If we do down then he will be distracted and stop shooting.\u201dThe Defense Master sponsor behind Gong Pildu was completely suited for this type of scenario. As long as he supported Gong Pildu, Gong Pildu wouldn\u2019t die here. As long as the sponsorship continued.I sat down and stretched out my legs.\u201cWe will be sucking honey for a while.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is it time for personal maintenance already?\u201dLee Hyunsung sat down with me and the party members started to relax one by one. Jung Heewon asked.\u201cThank you. I didn\u2019t get enough sleep\u2026 can I sleep now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d10 minutes later, Jung Heewon was lying on the ground and snoring. I said yes but I really didn\u2019t know how she could sleep so easily.\u201cA-Aren\u2019t we too easygoing?\u201dYoo Sangah sounded concerned. Indeed, it would be confusing. There wasn\u2019t a \u2018scenario\u2019 like this so far. In fact, all we did was survive the brink of a crisis.\u201cThink of it as standing on the right line.\u201d\u201cThen over there\u2026\u201d\u201cThey got the wrong line.\u201dThe confusion on the lower level had almost died down because of Gong Pildu.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDududududu!\u201cUwaaaaah!\u201dHe should\u2019ve lived a better life.\u201cFuck!

The number of monsters had barely decreased but it was still great. Gong Pildu was considered to have the strongest defense among the 10 Evils for a reason.\u201cYou scum!\u201d[The character Gong Pildu\u2019s Armed Zone has levelled up.[The character Gong Pildu\u2019s Private Land has levelled up!][The character Gong Pildu has acquired the Protective Wall skill.]The level up speed of Armed Zone was fast. The sponsor behind Gong Pildu was rushing to support his growth. If he could survive here, Gong Pildu\u2019s growth would be enormous.As long as he could survive here.\u201cUhweeeh\u2026!\u201dAccording to the scenario, Gong Pildu had to hold on for seven more hours. It would\u2019ve been nice if I had popcorn. Too bad.Lee Jihye was giggling next to me as she watched the bottom floor. She told me earlier that I should save them\u2026 it was truly a transformation in the disposition of Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s disciple.\u201cBy the way, why isn\u2019t Yoo Jonghyuk here?\u201cHow should I know? Master is always busy.\u201dBusy\u2026 yes, he might be busy. The person trying to be all alone was the busiest.I looked down at the dying Gong Pildu as I asked, \u201cWhat time did Yoo Jonghyuk enter the dungeon?\u201d\u201cIt is roughly 9 a.m. today\u2026\u201d Lee Jihye stopped speaking and stared at me. \u201c\u2026Wait a minute, how do you know that Master entered a dungeon?\u201dI ignored Lee Jihye and calculated the time. Now it was 8 p.m. Using simple calculations, it had already been over 11 hours since Yoo Jonghyuk entered. Yet he still hadn\u2019t come out\u2026Damn, I had to move. Yoo Jonghyuk was the main character and it would be difficult if something happened to him.I opened the dokkaebi communication.\u2018Bihyung.\u2019Bihyung floating in the air turned to look at me.[What is it? Calling me so suddenly.]\u2018Open the Dokkaebi Bag.\u2019[What? N-No! I am currently getting a lot of subscriptions!]I know. My stock price was rising due to my actions with Gong Pildu. My actions of laying a trap and then sitting back meant the constellations of the \u2018fun seekers\u2019 group wouldn\u2019t still be on the channel which Gong Pildu belonged to.Where would the constellations go after leaving the channel?[New constellations have entered the channel!]It was naturally Bihyung\u2019s channel.[#BI-7623 channel is ready for an expansion.][Huhu, huhuhut, look at this, look at this! Now my channel is also\u2026!]It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for Bihyung to be acting like this. But this wasn\u2019t the time for amusement.\u2018If you don\u2019t want your channel to be ruined, open it quickly. You can see that there will be an advertisement in preparation for the channel expansion.\u2019[Ah, shit\u2026 really\u2026]Bihyung grumbled but opened the Dokkaebi Bag after showing an advertisement. It was finally time to use the coins I had saved.\u2018I\u2019ll give you 5,000 coins. Upgrade me to a gold member.\u2019Bihyung stared at me quietly and sighed. It was followed by system messages.[5,000 coins have been consumed.][Congratulations! You have become a gold member of the Dokkaebi Bag!]My member rating changed and the background of the Dokkaebi Bag also changed. Coins were really good. New item listings were added. I put the necessary items into the shopping cart.* Behind the Scenes Contract \u2013 10,000 C.* Intermediate Magic Power Recovery Potion X 10 \u2013 5,000 C.One contract and 10 intermediate potions\u2026 this should be enough.The spending was a bit big but the channel was going to be expanded. It wouldn\u2019t be long before I recovered it. Bihyung was nervous when he saw the items I bought.[\u2026Why is there a contract? Have you already forgotten the terms? You can\u2019t have a sponsor!]\u2018What do you mean? Why would I get a sponsor now?\u2019\u2019Even if I was doing that, why would I buy the contract with my own coins? At any rate, this Bihyung still needed a lot of work.[15,000 coins have been consumed.][A \u2018Behind the Scenes Contract\u2019 has been acquired.][10 Intermediate Magic Power Recovery Potions have been acquired.]Yoo Sangah showed curiosity when the items appeared out of thin air.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cA contract to make a \u2018gap\u2019 an \u2018eul.\u2019\u201dI filled out the contract carefully, wrote my name in the \u2018gap\u2019 section and waited quietly. It was time for the \u2018eul\u2019 to come.[The sponsor for character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 is asking for help from nearby constellations.]Finally, the sponsor behind Gong Pildu reached his limits and started sending messages outside the channel. It was natural since the sponsor didn\u2019t have many coins in the first place. Not everybody was rich just because they were a constellation.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 scoffs.]The other constellations in Gong Pildu\u2019s channel would\u2019ve stopped sponsoring and the incarnation was dying\u2026 everything was going according to plan.Bihyung noticed something and muttered.[Wait a minute, surely you aren\u2019t\u2026]I talked towards Gong Pildu, who was in a half dead state.\u201cHey, you over there.\u201dDududududu!\u00a0Gong Pildu fired crazily and looked up at me while breathing heavily.\u201cWill you die like this or will you sign a contract with me?\u201d\u201cW-What\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a constellation so I can\u2019t be a sponsor. But if you want, I can be a person behind the scenes. How about it?\u201d\u201cWhat is this bastard talking about\u2026?\u201d\u201cGong Pildu, shut up. I\u2019m not talking to you.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dI waved the \u2018contract\u2019 in one hand and the \u2018Intermediate Magic Power Recovery Potion\u2019 in the other hand.\u201cAnswer quickly. I will give these items to you if you sign with me.\u201dA message window flashed in front of me.[The sponsor behind character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 has revealed himself.][The constellation \u2018Defense Master\u2019 is looking at you like you are crazy.]Indeed. He wasn\u2019t yet ready to be an \u2018eul.\u2019 Don\u2019t worry. He would be in a hurry as time passed.Bihyung was watching me.[You\u2026 are you crazy?]\u2018This one as well.\u2019[You are the first to try and support a constellation.]\u2018I can\u2019t do it?\u2019[This is a constellation! Will it sign with an insignificant human?]\u2018That is just your thoughts.\u2019The intermediate constellation, Defense Master. He was a low level constellation compared to his ability.His world had long become a \u2018scenario\u2019 and was completely destroyed. Therefore, the Defense Master\u2019s myth was no longer discussed. The myth had disappeared and the constellation couldn\u2019t get coins. One day, even his existence would disappear.That\u2019s why some constellations, including the Defense Master\u2019 were obsessed with looking for an \u2018incarnation\u2019. The constellations were remembered in the world through their chosen incarnation.\u2018That guy, he doesn\u2019t have any coins left.\u2019[What?]Gong Pildu\u2019s power had fallen sharply compared to before. Unlike the \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries\u2019, the Defense Master was someone who cared about his incarnation. The fact that Gong Pildu was going to die meant he had run out of coins.It was obvious but without coins, a new \u2018sponsor contract\u2019 was impossible. Then what happened to a constellation who couldn\u2019t create a new incarnation?\u2018Once Gong Pildu dies, that guy will be forgotten.\u2019For a constellation, being forgotten meant death.Faint fear filled Bihyung\u2019s eyes.[You are\u2026?]Gong Pildu was a great card if I could afford it. Even Yoo Jonghyuk had attempted to subjugate Gong Pildu several times in countless regressions. Of course, he had never been successful.Yoo Sangah spoke.\u201cDokja-ssi, that person will die.\u201dGong Pildu was biting his lips so hard that blood was flowing. Now there were only two mini-turrets left in Armed Zone. It was time to end this.[The constellation \u2018Defense Master\u2019 is wondering about the contents of the contract.]He was coming. Bihyung\u2019s eyes widened at the sight in front of him.[\u2026Really? No, is this real?]I showed the contract immediately.[The constellation \u2018Defense Master\u2019 has started reading the contract.]Gong Pildu, who was shedding blood on the lower floor, suddenly shouted. He had probably heard a message from his sponsor.\u201cW-What? What is this message?\u201dWhat? He was being sold.\u201cW-What is going on Pildu-ssi?\u201d[The constellation \u2018Defense Master\u2019 is asking for some time to think.]After a while, I heard some good news.[The constellation \u2018Defense Master\u2019 as added a condition to the contract.][If you agree with this condition, the constellation \u2018Defense Master\u2019 will agree to contract with you.]I immediately read the contract.\u2026\u2026.14. Incarnation Kim Dokja (Gap) recognizes the property rights of Constellation Defense Master (Eul)and should ensure the survival of \u2018Gong Pildu.\u201915. Incarnation Kim Dokja (Gap) should help Constellation Defense Master (Eul) so that his private property \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 grows well.\u2026\u2026.Guaranteeing Gong Pildu\u2019s life and his growth. In fact, this didn\u2019t need to be included. It was natural for Gong Pildu not to die if the contract was signed. The only thing that mattered for me was the third condition.3. Incarnation Kim Dokja (Gap) has a command authority over \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019, the private property of Constellation Defense Master (Up to 10 times a day).I checked the contract and nodded.\u201cI will sign the contract.\u201dBefore long, a faint thread connected me and Gong Pildu. Then system messages were heard.[The contract has been completed.][You have become the co-sponsor of \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 due to the contract.][Due to the contract, you have been given the right to command incarnation \u2018Gong Pildu.\u2019][The duration of the contract is five years and it won\u2019t be automatically renewed.]Yoo Jonghyuk would be stunned if he knew that Gong Pildu could be obtained so easily. If I hadn\u2019t read to the latter half of Ways of Survival, I wouldn\u2019t have known to use the Behind the Scenes Contract this way.I handed the recovery potions to Yoo Sangah.\u201cGive this to Gong Pildu. You should give him one every 40 minutes.\u201d\u201c\u2026It is okay to give to him?\u201dShe had to give it. If not, this main scenario wouldn\u2019t be cleared. Gong Pildu was confused after Yoo Sangah handed him a potion.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cDrink it and fight.\u201dGong Pildu was suspicious for a moment but soon opened the potion\u2019s lid. Blue smoke emerged around his body and the destroyed turrets returned to their original appearance.[The character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 has completely recovered his magic power.]Gong Pildu wiped the potion stained lips and looked up at me.\u201cStupid guy. Do you think I will forgive you because of this? Once I get out of here, it will be your end\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up, Gong Pildu.\u201d[Under the terms of the contract, \u2018Command Rights\u2019 is activated!]\u201cO-Oof? Oof oof oof?\u201dPoor guy, he didn\u2019t even know what situation he was in.\u201cFight hard. Don\u2019t touch my party members.\u201d\u201cHup\u2026! Oof oof\u2026!\u201dDududududu!Yoo Sangah\u2019s eyes widened when she saw Gong Pildu listened to my orders.\u201cD-Dokja-ssi? W-Why is that person\u2026?\u201d\u201cI made a \u2018gap\u2019 into an \u2018eul.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did you write something?\u201d\u201cNow you can rest assured about Gong Pildu.\u201dThen the bombardment of messages from the constellations poured out.[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 finds your idea interesting.][The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 has dropped his stick at your strategy.][The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 thinks that you are impudent.]\u2026\u2026I had secretly signed the contract but these guys already noticed. The Defense Master was only intermediate level but he was still a constellation.A mere human became a co-sponsor with a constellation, the impact on the constellations would be enormous. There would be a backlash among those like the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon. But.[Many constellations are paying attention to you.][A number of constellations want to become your sponsor.]The constellations who realized my value were overwhelmingly larger.

I\u2019m sorry but I have to leave for a while.\u2019\u201cHuh? Now?\u201d\u201cThere is a place I urgently need to go to. Hyunsung-ssi and Yoo Sangah-ssi, please stay here.

A bad person who disappeared to eat items alone, regardless if people die or not. From now on, I am going to hit him in the back of the head.\u201dIt was very hard. Jung Heewon thought for a moment before asking.\u201c\u2026Is he worse than Gong Pildu?\u201dI contemplated for a moment before replying.\u201cHe is much worse.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll explain the details later.\u201dI moved with Jung Heewon and Lee Gilyoung. Then somebody grabbed my shoulder. It was Lee Jihye\u201cWait, where are you going right now?\u201dIn any case, this was good.\u201cGreat. You can come along.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cYoo Jonghyuk is in danger.\u201dLee Jihye laughed like she thought I was joking.\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying?

Perhaps I was the world\u2019s foremost, no the second highest authority who knew her master.I checked the time.\u201cThat jerk, he went to the hidden dungeon at Exit 1?\u201d\u201cU-Uh?\u201d\u201cAnd it has been 11 hours since he entered?\u201d\u201cUhhh\u2026\u201d Lee Jihye spoke blankly.I remembered that Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019 had attacked Chungmuro\u2019s \u2018hidden dungeon\u2019 a total of eight years. He failed twice and succeeded six times. The problem was that the two failures were concentrated in his early regressions.

I walked behind Lee Jihye, Lee Gilyoung and Jung Heewon while looking at my smartphone.\u300c\u2026In the midst of the splitting headache, Yoo Jonghyuk came to his senses.\u2018Give up on this life.\u2019This was the end of Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eighth life. \u300dIt couldn\u2019t be. This hadn\u2019t happened yet.\u2026Shit, why was this guy doing this on only the third life? If he moved carefully like his second life, he would\u2019ve passed through the mid-to-late scenarios.I raised my eyes to see Jung Heewon looking at me.\u201cDokja-ssi, what are you looking at?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, the calendar\u2026 This situation has made me lose my sense of the date.\u201dI actually thought it might be more interesting to look at the calender. Sometimes I wondered how I finished reading this novel.Jung Heewon looked at me suspiciously before turning her head towards Lee Jihye.\u201cThen\u2026 did you say your name was Jihye? Do you also use a sword?\u201d\u201cYes. I like the sword.\u201d\u201cRight? The sword is the best. It has a good taste.\u201d\u201c\u2026Unni also knows the taste?\u201dJung Heewon smiled as she watched Lee Jihye\u2019s sword. It was a luxurious sword that obviously flowed smoothly. Maybe it was given by Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201cYour sword looks good.\u201d\u201cAh, Master gave it to me. Unni\u2026?\u201d\u201cMy one\u2026 I-I like mine as well.\u201dJung Heewon looked down at the groll horn blade and then sneaked a peek at the sword on the other person\u2019s waist.I didn\u2019t do anything wrong but I couldn\u2019t help feeling sorry. I had no choice but to hang something on Lee Jihye.\u201cHey, why are you talking to Heewon-ssi but ignoring me?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 that, I\u2019m a bit weak to older females.\u201dLee Jihye responded with a quivering voice and Jung Heewon gave her a headlock, as if Lee Jihye was cute. There seemed to be a connection between the \u2018demon slayers.\u2019 Lee Jihye barely escaped from the headlock and asked.\u201cBy the way, why are you rescuing Master?\u201d\u201cWe are companions.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d\u201cHe is a useful guy.\u201d\u201c\u2026You sound like Master.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 is wondering about your heart.]Come to think of it, it wasn\u2019t just Lee Jihye but the constellations as well who must be wondering about my actions. He was a guy who would kill me if he got a chance. It was strange that I would run to save him.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 likes your desire to rehabilitate a fallen friend.][100 coins have been sponsored.]This one misunderstood me. But the Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2026 unlike the expectations of the Archangel Uriel, I had a deeply personal reason for saving Yoo Jonghyuk.It was to prevent him from \u2018regressing\u2019 after his death.Regression after death. It sounded good. A \u2018regression stigma\u2019 that triggered every time you died. The protagonist had a fraudulent ability.The problem was that this ability invoked complicated thoughts in the surrounding cast.\u300cBy the way, what happens to the world after you return? \u300dA supporting actor had asked this of Yoo Jonghyuk when Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s number of lives had broken into the double digits. I forgot his name but Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s answer from that time was clear.\u300c \u2026I also don\u2019t know. I always choose a world where more people can live. \u300dIt was plausible but in fact, Yoo Jonghyuk didn\u2019t know about the world he abandoned. In face, there was no definite theory about what happened to the world in Ways of Survival.Science, magic, whatever.This was why I was anxious. What happened to the world after the regressor disappeared?Would it reset with the regression? Or would a parallel universe branch off? The latter would be fortunate, but if it was the former\u2026\u201cHyung?\u201d\u201cAh, yes?\u201dLee Gilyoung, who was holding the hem of my clothes, looked up at me with anxious eyes.\u201cI think we\u2019re here?\u201d[You are approaching the outside region. Be careful not to leave the scenario area.]This message popped up. It didn\u2019t matter. Chungmuro\u2019s hidden dungeon was treated as an \u2018inside\u2019 area.We turned the corner and Exit 1 appeared. A dungeon entrance with an ominous shade greeted us.[You have found a hidden dungeon!][This dungeon has already been discovered by someone. You can\u2019t get the first discovery achievement.][A new hidden scenario has arrived!]+[Hidden Scenario \u2013 Theatre Dungeon]Category: HiddenDifficulty: A-Clear Conditions: Defeat the master of Theatre Dungeon.Time Limit: NoneCompensation: 4,000 coinsFailure: \u2015+The surprised Lee Jihye hesitated and stepped back.\u201c\u2026What is this? Theater Dungeon?\u201dLee Gilyoung looked startled. Well, this must be the first time they encountered a hidden scenario. Jung Heewon also spoke.\u201cA movie theatre as a dungeon\u2026 it sounds romantic.\u201dRomantic. This was only because she didn\u2019t know how scary the movie theatre could be. We entered the theatre. The familiar lobby of the multiplex welcomed us.[You have entered Theatre Dungeon.]We were tense as we entered the bleak dungeon. It was a multiplex consisting of nine floors, from B1 to the 8th floor.\u201cHyung, the posters are torn. Who would do that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201dI said this but I actually knew the truth.The core of this \u2018Theatre Dungeon\u2019 were the \u2018posters\u2019 on the wall. Perhaps Yoo Jonghyuk defeated every poster as he went upstairs. His intentions were to sweep up all the rewards.Except for the torn posters, nothing strange was found on B1. There were no items and no monsters. The only exception was the smashed elevator in one corner with a distrted door.Lee Jihye asked.\u201cIsn\u2019t this a dungeon? Why isn\u2019t there anything?\u201d\u201cSomething will appear.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you know something?\u201d\u201cA little.\u201d\u201cHow? Something is fishy about Ahjussi. Is this your second life?\u201dThat was her master. But he had lived three times.Then Jung Heewon said, \u201cIt is due to the sponsor behind Dokja-ssi.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201dI ignored the two women and tried to move to the ground floor when I was caught by Lee Gilyoung. The cockroach on his head was moving wildly. Lee Jihye drew her sword at almost the same moment I covered her mouth with a hand.\u201cShhh, there is somebody else besides us.\u201dI breathed out while small sounds started to be heard. Just upstairs. Then\u2026 the lobby? I first thought it was Yoo Jonghyuk but it wasn\u2019t Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s voice.\u201c\u2026Are you sure? Here\u2026 there are a bunch of things.\u201d\u201cYes. I bought the information with 1,000 coins.\u201d\u201cThe prophets?\u201d\u201cYes. They are disgusting but the information is obvious.\u201dI heard the sound of people talking. We went up the escalator and approached them. It seemed that four people were gathered in the lobby on the 1st floor.Lee Jihye whispered, \u201cWho are they? I never once saw their faces in Chungmuro.\u201d\u201cMaybe they came from the ground side entrance.\u201d\u201cGround side? Isn\u2019t that filled with poisonous fog? Furthermore, the scenario\u2015\u201d\u201cDifferent stations have different scenarios at different speeds. There are those who have finished the scenario faster than our station. If there is a weak poisoning, they can eat the meat from the underground species.\u201dI said this but I was confused.\u2018Prophets?\u2019There was no information about such people in Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s life. At this point, Yoo Jonghyuk and I should be the only ones who knew about the hidden dungeon.What caused the variables? Needless to say, I needed to find out.\u201cThen let\u2019s go inside.\u201dA blue spotlight was floating above the men talking. A bright light surrounded them and then they disappeared.\u201c\u2026What happened to them?\u201dJung Heewon asked me but I didn\u2019t answer. Instead, I was searching the posters on the wall. This was torn, that as well\u2026 by the time I reached the end of the wall, only one wasn\u2019t torn. I read the words written on the poster.Steven Spielberg, Samuel L Jackson, Jeff Goldblum\u2026That bastard Yoo Jonghyuk\u2026 he left this one alone? As expected from the third regression.At that moment, the light came on again. This time, the spotlight was aimed on us. The surprised Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung stepped back, but there was no way to avoid it. The word \u2018ray\u2019 suited it.I asked Jung Heewon, \u201cHeewon-ssi likes movies?\u201d\u201cOf course. Do you usually like it?\u201d\u201cYou might hate it after this.\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2015\u201d[You have been hit by a projection light.][The screening will begin.]The surrounding landscape started to slowly change. It wasn\u2019t a simple illusion so Fourth Wall wasn\u2019t activated as before. The old linoleum floor became covered with green bushes, while the reception desk and popcorn stand turned into a lush rainforest. The ceiling turned into a blue sky with no clouds and no end in sight. Lee Ji-hye muttered in a small voice.\u201cWhere the hell is this place?\u201dLee Jihye shouted and hacked at the surrounding trees and bushes, but nothing changed. Lee Gilyoung started looking for insects with a calm expression.I tried to touch the nearby trees. It had a hard and moist texture. It was a real rainforest from the Mesozoic era. This was a different realism from the specter\u2019s Welcome Prison. This was the power of the theatre master on the dungeon\u2019s 8th floor.\u201cIt is a movie.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really ridiculous things are happening.\u201dA novel had become reality. There was no law that a movie couldn\u2019t become reality as well.Jung Heewon was a fast adaptor and quickly understood.\u201cAhjussi, what movie is this?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll know soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026Can\u2019t you just let me know? Wait a minute, what is this kid doing\u2026?\u201dAt this moment, the shrubbery moved and something jumped out in front of Lee Gilyoung. An insect that resembled a giant preying mantis. The size was approximately 40cm. Lee Jihye was terrified and cried out.\u201cHey Kid! Back away!\u201dHowever, Lee Gilyoung responded calmly to the fuss.\u201cIt isn\u2019t a preying mantis. It is a Titanoptera from the Triassic period.\u201cWhat?\u201dLee Gilyoung stretched out his hand to the titano. The insect didn\u2019t refuse the touch and after a moment, Lee Gilyoung and the insect\u2019s body was wrapped in a blue light.Lee Jihye watched with a stupid expression.\u201cThis\u2026 what?\u201d\u201cFabre.\u201dIt really was good that I brought Lee Gilyoung. This guy\u2019s ability might allow us to pass through the gateway more easily.The giant preying mantis moved its big mouth and Lee Gilyoung nodded. I didn\u2019t know what it involved but they were having a conversation. After a while, Lee Gilyoung paled as he talked to the preying mantis.\u2026What was it?Lee Gilyoung hurriedly turned to me.\u201cHyung!\u201dAs he spoke, the sound of the earth shaking was heard. It seemed that something was coming at a tremendous speed, smashing the huge palm trees.Kuoooooh!The muzzle of the giant reptile that appeared through the rainforest was covered with reddish blood. Some bloody men were running in front of it. It was the men who entered before us.\u201cKuaaack!\u201d\u201cS-Save me!\u201dLee Jihye stepped back and spoke to Jung Heewon.\u201cI know what movie this is.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, me too.\u201dA body that was over a dozen metres tall and hard skin. Fierce muscles dominated the entire body. The strongest predator of the Mesozoic Era was in front of us.At first glance, it was similar to a grade 7 monster. The difficulty level was atrocious considering this was the 1st floor of the dungeon. But my heart just thumped. The harder the hidden dungeon, the better the reward.I pulled out a blade and said, \u201cGet ready to fight.\u201dMaybe Yoo Jonghyuk skipped only this movie because of the contents. The main reward of Theater Dungeon was related to the movie contents. Yoo Jonghyuk probably thought there weren\u2019t any worthy rewards in a movie where dinosaurs appeared. But he didn\u2019t know.In this movie, a really important reward was hidden.\u201c\u2026Are you serious? We are going to fight that?\u201d\u201cWe need to beat it to make an exit.\u201d\u201cThe exit?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt is a long movie. Have you forgotten?\u201dA T-rex was approaching quickly. The island\u2019s central laboratory was seen behind it. And an escape helicopter was on the rooftop of the laboratory.This was a movie. A movie that the master of Theater Dungeon made into reality.Therefore, there was only one way to escape from here.\u201cLet\u2019s make a great ending.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Therefore, I was the only one who could take the risk here.\u201cWhile I draw its attention, attack its rear\u2015\u201dI hadn\u2019t finished talking when I saw Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon already at the T-Rex\u2019s rear. They noticed quickly.Kuoooooh!I barely avoided the incoming teeth and the stomping legs. Before I could wield Unbroken Faith, its tail passed over my head. An electrifying thrill swept over my body. I wouldn\u2019t die because my stamina was over level 20, but it was dizzying.Maybe I had been lucky until now. I might be the \u2018sunfish\u2019 rather than Yoo Jonghyuk.Sukak!\u00a0Supaak!Meanwhile, Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye was steadily dealing damage from the rear. It was a combination of \u2018Sword Training\u2019 and \u2018Kendo.\u2019 Noticeable sword wounds were being dealt to the T-Rex\u2019s big legs. If this continued, it might take some time but the T-Rex would be defeated.\u201cHyung! I\u2019ll draw its attention!\u201dThe boy didn\u2019t listen to me about staying in the rear.\u201cNo, Gilyoung you\u2015\u201d\u201cI can do it!\u201dAll of a sudden, Lee Gilyoung came forward and started to make an unknown signal. I wanted to say something. Then a huge praying mantis came from somewhere, stabbed the T-Rex\u2019s eyes and fled. It was the Titano that Lee Gilyoung had been talking to before.Kuooooh!The T-Rex\u2019s eyes moved confusedly as it followed the praying mantis that disturbed its vision. Lee Gilyoung used dazzling hand movements to control the praying mantis. I looked at Lee Gilyoung with a fresh mindset.Wasn\u2019t this guy actually a hugely fraudulent character? No wonder why Yoo Jonghyuk coveted him.Kuwoooh!Thanks to Lee Gilyoung\u2019s success, the battlefield quickly became advantageous. The T-Rex\u2019s movements became duller while a red light shone in Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye\u2019s eyes.[Demon Slayer].It made them vulnerable to mental attacks but it was a good skill that made them stronger when they were excited. The sight of the two women\u2019s eyes burning as they watched the rainforest was truly spectacular.It was a pity that I had lost Lee Jihye to Yoo Jonghyuk. However, Jung Heewon also had overwhelming growth potential. Judge of Destruction was a good attribute and she didn\u2019t have a sponsor yet.It felt like the T-Rex\u2019s stamina had decreased considerably. It was time to deal the final blow.[Blade of Faith is activated!]I started to focus my remaining magic power. I didn\u2019t have a sponsor, nor was I as fast as Jung Heewon or Lee Jihye. But that didn\u2019t mean my attack power was weak.

I almost fell over a few times because I didn\u2019t have the \u2018Sense of Balance\u2019 but I somehow held on by stabbing the blade into the epidermis.Kuoooooh!The T-Rex poured out blood and its body rolled across the ground. I rammed the blade in wherever I could. Flames poured into the wounds caused by the blade.The yellow eyes of the T-Rex stared at me as it gasped painfully, before finally dying.[You have succeeded in being the first to hunt the 7th grade species \u2018Tyrannosaurus Rex!\u2019][You have obtained 1,000 coins as compensation.]\u201cAh\u2026we really got it.\u201d\u201cI knew we could do it.\u201dJung Heewon breathed heavily as she spoke with a proud expression on her face. She could be proud because the T-Rex was top-ranked among the 7th grade monsters. Lee Jihye belatedly rushed towards me.\u201cI had it!\u201d\u201cWhat?

Jung Heewon and the others came up behind me.\u201cThat person\u2026?\u201dI shook my head and looked down at the fallen man.\u2018Revelation.\u2019 What funny bullshit.As far as I knew, only Anna Croft had the ability of \u2018Future Sight\u2019 in Ways of Survival.Then there was only one answer.\u2026There was someone else besides me. But they didn\u2019t know as much as I did. The proof was that they didn\u2019t dare come here in person to test out the information.\u201cDokja-ssi?\u201d\u201cTake a break.\u201dWe covered the man\u2019s body with a large lead and gathered near the dad T-Rex. W had to hurry to pursue Yoo Jonghyuk. But if we didn\u2019t get enough rest, the party would be wiped out before we met him.I searched the T-Rex\u2019s body.I looked at the head and heart but unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find any monster cores. That didn\u2019t mean there was no income. Jung Heewon drooled as she watched the T-Rex being cooked over the fire.\u201c\u2026Can we eat this?\u201d\u201cWe can eat it because it is cooked with magic flames. The unripe parts can be cooked with the Magic Power Stove.\u201dWe sat side by side around the T-Rex\u2019s leg. As we cut the cooked flesh of the T-Rex little by little, steam rose. Lee Gilyoung shouted.\u201cFresh meat!\u201dLee Jihye hurriedly rushed up and grabbed a pierce first. The rest of the group, including myself, also picked large pieces of flesh. Meat of this size? It was a luxury that couldn\u2019t be dreamt of back when I was an office worker. Lee Jihye closed her eyes while enjoying the taste. Then she murmured in an ecstatic voice.\u201cAh, the best taste in the world\u2026\u201dIt really was delicious.The fat was properly wrapped around the muscles, making it different from the ground rats. The feeling every time I took a bit\u2026 If Yoo Sangah was here, she would\u2019ve cried.After I consumed the meat, I felt my stamina recovering. The meat of an advanced species had these special effects. However, caution was required in some cases. Jung Heewon sighed.\u201cPhew\u2026 I ate well. It is really delicious but I will cry if I eat anymore.\u201dWe had a moderate rest and then headed straight to the laboratory in the centre of the island.We encountered several raptors on the way but they were easy after the T-Rex.There were many flasks and ampoules in the laboratory. There were small incubators containing dinosaur embryos and blood samples collected. There was only one thing missing.My eyes caught a few items as we entered the inner corridor.[Stamina Enhancing Ampoule][Magic Power Enhancing Ampoule][Agility Enhancing Ampoule][Strength Enhancing Ampoule]As expected, it was here. I started to pack the ampoules. Just like the Ichthyosaur\u2019s Core, these comprehensive stat growth items were available only in the early scenarios.It wasn\u2019t just one or two ampoules. There were close to 20 bottles. If this was the case, my stats would be able to level up explosively. It was in anticipation of this hidden scenario that I saved coins instead of investing them in my stats.These ampoules were only available when the corresponding stat was less than level 30.\u201cAhjussi, what did you find now?\u201d\u2026Ah, this ghost-like girl.\u201cWhat? Stamina Enhancement Ampoule?\u201dLee Jihye\u2019s eyes shone as she grabbed one ampoule.\u201cAre you trying to eat these alone?\u201d\u201cEat them all? Of course I will share it.\u201d\u201cUnni, look at this! Ahjussi\u2026!\u201dThe other people in the party came closer due to the turmoil. Jung Heewon was shocked when she checked the item information.\u201cOh my god\u2026 what are these items?\u201d\u201c\u2026This is a hidden scenario.\u201dI spoke with a bit of disgruntlement. Damn, this was a bit difficult. I didn\u2019t catch the T-Rex alone so taking all the items pricked my conscience\u2026[Some constellations are displeased with the situation.]Lee Jihye looked at the Strength Enhancement Ampoule and opened her mouth.\u201cCan you give me the Strength Enhancement Ampoule?

But is it okay? It could be a mistake.\u201d\u201cThen doesn\u2019t that mean he is unlucky?\u201dLee Jihye asked. She was excited at the thought of getting a share of the items.\u201cLet\u2019s start with a Strength Enhancement Ampoule.\u201dI put out the Strength Enhancement Ampoule and said to Lee Jihye.\u201cYou will face me.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI\u2019m good at rock paper scissors.

Lee Gilyoung\u2019s face was slightly flushed while Jung Heewon had a satisfied expression. Lee Jihye flopped to the ground with a devastated expression.\u201c\u2026This is ridiculous!\u201dUnfortunately, I couldn\u2019t read Lee Gilyoung\u2019s mind so two ampoules went to him.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give it to me\u2026\u201d\u201cTake it.\u201dHe was cute. I stroked Lee Gilyoung\u2019s head.In addition, Jung Heewon won two Stamina Enhancement Ampoules. Jung Heewon received them with a smile.\u201cThank you. It was tough so far with my stamina.\u201dIt was only Lee Jihye who didn\u2019t obtain any ampoules.\u201cHow can you beat me 18 out of 20 times?

Can\u2019t you give me just one\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201dI ignored Lee Jihye\u2019s whines and packed the ampoules.Jung Heewon patted the shoulder of the grouchy Lee Jihye while staring at Lee Jihye\u2019s shining sword.\u201cLittle sister, the world has to be fair.\u201d*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Dudududu.\u00a0There was the sound of the helicopter\u2019s propellers. Lee Gilyoung looked at the distant dinosaur island and asked, \u201cHyung, can\u2019t I take it to the next floor?\u201dThe big praying mantis was sitting in Lee Gilyoung\u2019s lap and talking to Lee Gilyoung. The praying mantis rubbed its antenna against Lee Gilyoung\u2019s jaw.\u201cUnfortunately, you can\u2019t take it.\u201dLee Gilyoung\u2019s hugged the praying mantis with a sad expression.\u201c\u2026Take care Titano.\u201dKwiiik.He had already given it a name. Unfortunately, monsters created in Theatre Dungeon couldn\u2019t move to another floor.However, items could be taken to other floors. For example, I had the ampoules that increased stats and the item I was now holding.[Tyrant T-Rex\u2019s DNA Ampoule]The golden ampoule was the most decisive reason for choosing this movie. It was an item that increased all stats by 10 for 30 minutes after ingestion. Although it had the disadvantage that it could only be used in Theatre Dungeon, it was impossible to break through the last floor of this dungeon without this item.Especially if Yoo Jonghyuk was in the worst situation as I thought.The praying mantis that Lee Gilyoung released flew in the air and the dark sky started to collapse.[The first \u2018Ending Credit\u2019 has been reached.][Performers: Kim Dokja, Jung Heewon, Lee Jihye, Lee Gilyoung.][You have obtained 500 coins as compensation.]I felt some dizziness and we appeared on the ground floor again. After we escaped, the movie posted on the wall was torn. It was evidence that we safely cleared it. Lee Jihye was complaining.\u201cDo you have to pass a few more floors like this?\u201d\u201cYoo Jonghyuk will have broken most of it so it will be faster than you think.\u201dWe headed straight to the second floor via the escalator. From the second floor, the remaining space was narrow because it was the full-fledged theatre. Jung Heewon asked.\u201cThere\u2019s no change?\u201dNo matter how long we waited, the environment on the second floor didn\u2019t change. The camera wasn\u2019t seen and the screening didn\u2019t start either. Looking closer, all the posters on the second floor were torn. Lee Jihye noticed something.\u201cIs it only the movies whose posters are intact?\u201dI checked the torn posters one by one.Pacific Rim directed by Guillermo del Toro\u2026 a giant robots righting movie? Too bad. If this had been intact then I could\u2019ve gotten the reward of Hardened Gloves.Inception directed by Christopher Nolan\u2026 it was good that this one was torn.\u201cWow, I wanted to watch this.\u201dI saw the poster that Lee Jihye was looking at.\u201cDo you like superheroes?\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt is fortunate. Otherwise you would hate it after this.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dOn the torn poster, a green monster was roaring at\u00a0us.We\u00a0went straight up to the third floor.\u201cIt is the same here.\u201dAll the posters on the third floor were torn as well. Yoo Jonghyuk had properly swept through it. It was fortunate since there were a lot of dangerous movies on the third floor.Final Destination directed by James Wan\u2026 that bastard Yoo Jonghyuk, how did he break this? This was an annihilation movie.\u201cWe are going up faster than I expected?\u201dUnlike Jung Heewon\u2019s bright voice, I was nervous every time we climbed a floor. Clearing the Theatre Dungeon required some luck. Some of the posters on each floor weren\u2019t covered in Ways of Survival. Yoo Jonghyuk didn\u2019t clear all movies.There was a system message when we entered the fourth floor.[You have entered the fourth floor.]The spotlight poured down without giving me time to look at the posters. Jung Heewon gathered both hands together and prayed.\u201cPlease don\u2019t be a ghost movie\u2026\u201dI glanced at Jung Heewon and she gave me an excuse.\u201cGhosts can\u2019t be killed with a sword.\u201d\u2026This was the reason.[The screening has started!]The background changed and when we opened our eyes, a sea breeze blew on the prow of a ship.\u201cThis\u2026?\u201dSalt was felt in my mouth and the open horizon spread out before me. I was enraptured by the scenery of the sea. I had been working every day and it had been a few years since I\u2019ve travelled anywhere.\u201cWhat is this movie?\u201dNext to me, Jung Heewon was wearing a full length dress.A violin sound was heard from the inside of the cruise ship and there was the sound of excited people. It was an incredibly romantic atmosphere from a movie\u2026Oh, I know what this movie is.Then Lee Jihye\u2019s voice was heard. \u201cOh, accelerating all of a sudden\u2026\u201dI looked back and saw that Lee Jihye was vomiting. Jung Heewon rushed over and patted her back. After vomiting for a long time, Lee Jihye said.\u201cUh, I get seasick.\u201d\u201cIt is okay, just vomit.\u201d\u2026I had wondered this since a while ago. Why did the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare choose Lee Jihye? No, I read the novel but I just didn\u2019t want to know.\u201cBut Unni\u2026 is this the movie? The boat that sinks.\u201d\u201cIt seems so.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 perhaps Unni is \u2018Kate Winslet?\u2019\u201dLee Jihye looked at Jung Heewon\u2019s dress like she was envious, then she looked at me.\u201cThen Ahjussi is\u2026 DiCaprio? Uweeeek!\u201dI felt somehow grumpy when I saw her vomiting after saying that. At this time, Lee Gilyoung emerged from behind me.\u201cHyung!\u201dLee Gilyoung was dressed in formal clothing. This clothing was somewhat familiar\u2026Anyway, everyone was gathered.\u201cThere is no time.\u201dThe ship was now sinking. Unfortunately, the solution to this movie didn\u2019t appear in Ways of Survival.How could we beat the Titanic? Was it a fight with the sea?Lee Jihye was the first to comment.\u201cThe ship is sinking anyway. Do we just have to sink with it?\u201d\u201cThat is a little\u2026\u201dIt was frustrating. It would\u2019ve been better if the movie had a clear enemy to crush.\u201cLet\u2019s look for the villain Hyung.\u201dThis was Lee Gilyoung\u2019s opinion. I didn\u2019t know if there was an obvious villain this movie., But since I couldn\u2019t think of anything else, I decided to follow it.\u201cThen let\u2019s handle the villain.\u201dWe started moving. By the way, who was this movie\u2019s villain? The last time I watched the Titanic\u2026But I didn\u2019t need to worry. The villain came to find us. A man in a clean suit was staring over here.\u201cJack Dawson!\u201dWait, Jack Dawson\u2026 the role that DiCaprio played? But the man wasn\u2019t looking at me.\u201c\u2026Me?\u201d\u2026He was DiCaprio? I sighed as I looked at Lee Gilyoung.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *After a while, we kidnapped a person we thought was the villain of the movie. But the theater master didn\u2019t respond. It wasn\u2019t enough to kidnap him\u2026I hesitated for a moment before opening my mouth.\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s kill him.\u201dLee Jihye pulled out her sword and pointed it. It was at a man struggling while his body was tied up.\u201cThe theater master is a psychopath? Then isn\u2019t the answer to kill him quickly?\u201dI thought so as well. No, I was sure of it.It was the answer to another movie like this in Ways of Survival. But Jung Heewon gazed at the man in horror and unexpected said,\u201cBut\u2026he looks like a real person.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cThis is a movie but he is just like a real person.\u201dIt was surprising that Jung Heewon said this when she had been neatly subjugating the weak a few days ago. Then again, Jung Heewon had said something like this: \u2018I might be a killer but I don\u2019t want to become a monster.\u2019Lee Ji-hye asked, \u201cUnni, what are you saying this type of sentimental thing now? You don\u2019t want to kill him?\u201d\u201cNo, that isn\u2019t it\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is good to save people. But if this person doesn\u2019t die, we will die. We are definitely alive but this guy is just a character!\u201dCharacters\u2026I felt bemused at Lee Jihye\u2019s words.Jung Heewon looked at me. \u201c\u2026Do you think so?\u201d\u201cEven if this guy is a \u2018real\u2019 person, he is still a bad guy! Why is killing him bad?\u201dLee Jihye\u2019s words might be right. This guy was definitely a villain of the scenario and would do bad things. So it was okay to kill him. Funnily enough, it was the logic that Yoo Jonghyuk often spoke about in Ways of Survival.The moment I opened my mouth, Lee Jihye hurriedly drew her sword.\u201cSigh, what is this? Master could be dying right now!\u201dThe blade descended and pierced the man\u2019s chest. Blood poured out. It was incredibly realistic. Then a system message was heard.[The theater owner is satisfied with the changed ending of the movie.][The stern of the ship will lead to the next floor.]\u201cLook, I did it properly. Right?\u201dLee Jihye shouted triumphantly.The answer obviously wasn\u2019t wrong. The theater master acknowledged this and the constellations would give coins for our actions. We would survive with these coins.It was a way of living that destroyed this world.[The second \u2018Ending Credit\u2019 has been reached.][Performers: Kim Dokja, Jung Heewon, Lee Jihye, Lee Gilyoung.][You have obtained 500 coins as compensation.]We weren\u2019t able to get a reward item from Titanic. Thus, we went straight to the next floor and followed the guidance of the system message.[You have entered the fifth floor, the rewards room.]Once we climbed the escalator, the rewards room finally showed up.\u201cRewards room? It isn\u2019t a scary movie?\u201d\u201cThis is an exhibition hall. It was a place they used to show original movie props.\u201dIn fact, I knew this but I once again acted ignorant.Various movie props appeared in glass tubes. Equipment and costumes used by the main characters of various movies, stage accessories\u2026The funny thing was that they were no longer props.Jung Heewon approached a glass tube and shouted.\u201cOh my god, look at this!\u201d[Mikazuki Munechika \u2013 Replica] A grade sword.Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes sparkled as she looked at the glass tube and I nodded.\u201cYou\u2019ve finally obtained a proper sword, Heewon-ssi.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201dIt was obviously a great sword at first glance. The originally groll horn knife wasn\u2019t comparable and it wasn\u2019t lacking when compared to Lee Jihye\u2019s blade.Jung Heewon started to swing the sword in his hand.\u201cIsn\u2019t this amazing? It is light and moves properly!\u201dI had never seen Jung Heewon like this.[The character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 is deeply grateful to you.]It was nothing.The main purpose of targeting the Theatre Dungeon was the \u2018compensation\u2019 of the fifth floor. The Theatre Dungeon was a good place to farm for items early on. In particular, Jung Heewon would become stronger with this weapon.[The reward items are limited to two per person.]It wasn\u2019t a genuine \u2018star relic\u2019 person it was a movie prop, but the replica version had characteristics of the original item. A-grade items were close to a scam in the early stages.By the way, Yoo Jonghyuk had already passed through here. Two items were already gone.\u201cPick your items. Each one can only obtain two so choose carefully.\u201dI told Jung Heewon to pick an item Yoo Sangah could use while I found one for Lee Hyunsung. This one seemed useable.[Hercules\u2019 Shield- Replica] A grade shield.Good\u2026 It was an item that couldn\u2019t be compared with the Old Iron Shield. I thought of how Lee Hyunsung\u2019s eyes would shine with loyalty towards me and already felt warm.Lee Jihye, who claimed to be a fan of superheroes, was trying to pull an item from the corner.\u201cAh, why can\u2019t I hold this?\u201dI came closer. This was it.[Mjolnir \u2013 Replica] A grade blunt weapon.The hammer of the god of lightning, Thor. It would\u2019ve been an enormous item if it was a genuine star relic\u2026 still, the quality of the original was so great that the performance of the replica was significant.I watched Lee Jihye groaning as she grabbed the hammer that couldn\u2019t be moved.\u201cIsn\u2019t this an item that only someone special can use?\u201d\u201cDamn, I\u2019m not special?\u201dAt this time, Lee Gilyoung came up behind her and reached out to Mjolnir.\u201cHey Kid! This is mine\u2026\u201dMjolnir was lightly lifted by Lee Gilyoung\u2019s hands. Lee Gilyoung swung the hammer around before looking at me.\u201cHyung, can I have it?\u201d\u201cYes, it looks good.\u201dLee Jihye once again looked stunned.\u201cOnly I am unhappy\u2026 just me\u2026\u201dI ignored her and searched the remaining items. Let\u2019s see what was left.[External Reinforced Suit \u2013 Replica] A grade protective clothing.I didn\u2019t know what would happen in the future but it would be nice to supplement my defense. Once I wore the suit, it wrapped around my arms and legs.[Damage from external attacks is reduced by 10%.][The ability to detect enemies is improved.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[You can move more agilely than before.]It was a bit frustrating but it was still better than not wearing it. In particular, I thought about the fight waiting at the end of this.Now the preparations were finished.Since there were no significant changes in the dungeon, it was clear that Yoo Jonghyuk was alive. If we moved quickly through the sixth floor, we might be able to meet on the seventh floor. In the worst case scenario, if he was fighting the boss on the eighth floor\u2026 at least he was still alive.Now, let\u2019s go and get our damn regressor back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There is actually someone here who hasn\u2019t seen it.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 hates spoilers.]In any case, an item was rewarded due to the movie\u2019s unique characteristics.[Skill Book: Calm Observation.]Calm Observation. It was quite a useful skill.This skill allowed the user to see the movements of the target and figure out their overall stats. It didn\u2019t mean much to me since I could use Character List, but it would be quite useful for people like Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung. This skill would be good against enemies excellent at acting.[The exclusive skill \u2018 Calm Observation\u2019 has been acquired.]Still, I felt a bit sad. It would be nice to experience a movie like Gladiator.I had yet to obtain a suitable combat passive skill. He might purchase the skill Weapons Training but it wasn\u2019t a good idea to spend coins on the skill right now.\u201c\u2026Now I am tired of movies.\u201dI agreed with Jung Heewon\u2019s words. I didn\u2019t want to look at a movie theatre for a while. I should just be satisfied with the high performance fee.We went directly up to the seventh floor. Maybe this time we could see Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s back\u2026Damn. Most of the posters on the seventh floor were torn. Yes, Yoo Jonghyuk was now in the boss room. Under these circumstances, there was really no time to delay.\u201cRun. It is almost the last floor.\u201dWe started to run. We had to catch up with that guy as fast as possible. Before he gave up everything.We passed through the auditoriums and ran down the aisles. The posters on the 7th floor were of Korean movies popular in the past.Shit, please let all of them be torn\u2026However, unlike what I hoped, the last poster was still intact.\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d[The screening will begin.]The blue spotlight covered the party and the scene changed. My head spun and a salty smell entered my nose.The stage was the sea. But\u2026 this time it wasn\u2019t a cruise ship. There was the smell of artillery. The rough texture of the Panokseon could be felt. (Panokseon wiki link)The moment I turned my head on the shaky boat, I heard someone\u2019s voice.\u201cEverybody, down\u2014!\u201dI reflexively fell down and there was a bombardment of gunfire around me.\u00a0Tang tang tang tang\u2015 A few soldiers collapsed while bleeding.\u201cProtect the ship\u2015!\u201dThe soldiers dressed in old military garb were rushing around. An uneasy wind blew as war took place. The turbulent Myeongnyang Strait was swirling and there was the distant sound of drums.Dammit.There was no Korean who didn\u2019t know this movie.

It was one of the strongest combat buffs that the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare was proud of.[Your sword is filled with the words left by the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare.]There was a large variation in the attack power depending on which verse was sung, but it was a perfect skill for me right now.\u300c Shooting arrows like rain and protecting the generalissimo from guns firing on all sides. \u300dFortunately, it was a verse from the Nanjung Ilgi.

I could only believe in my last card. I cried out with all my strength.\u201cGilyoung!\u201dKukukung!The moment I cried out, there was a huge crack in the ceiling of Sky Garden.The black dome surrounding the roof was breaking. The Yoo Jonghyuk running towards me was also the Yoo Jonghyuk manipulated by the theatre master. He looked up with surprise at the ceiling.It was generally impossible for the shielded area of a \u2018hidden scenario\u2019 to be broken. But it was possible for \u2018uncommon\u2019 existences.In the distance, Lee Gilyoung was crying while wiping his bleeding nose.\u201cU-Uwahh\u2026 uwahhhh\u2026!\u201dIn order to deal with a monster, you had to call a monster.Kuoooooh!A huge insect dug into the cracks of the broken dome.Rattle!Like thin glass, the dome broke and the roof was split apart.

It was like a gigantic praying mantis, the insect king of great size.[The 6th grade insect king, Titanoptera has appeared!]It was an appearance that caused goosebumps.

Yoo Jonghyuk even launched a counterattack.Kyaooooh!The Titanoptera screamed at the hard blow. Surprisingly, Yoo Jonghyuk was on par with the 6th grade insect king.Maybe it was something he saw when fighting with me. The colour of the theatre master was returning. Yoo Jonghyuk was strong. It was a sudden situation but the theatre master thought he could win.He was wrong. He should\u2019ve been looking at me.I ran towards the theater master again. There wasn\u2019t long left on Diverse Communicaton.

The fierce teeth and violence claws ripped and clawed at me, but I didn\u2019t stop. I wasn\u2019t afraid. It was all fake. They didn\u2019t exist. They were all fiction from a novel.The moment that the Blade of Faith reached his neck.[The \u2018Theatre Master\u2019s Simulacrum\u2019 has triggered \u2018Mental Erosion.]Mental Erosion. It was the advanced cognitive manipulation skill used on Yoo Jonghyuk. I wasn\u2019t afraid because I had the Fourth Wall. But something unexpected happened the moment he penetrated my head.[The \u2018Theatre Master\u2019s Simulacrum\u2019 is embarrassed.]Abyss of the ego.All types of thoughts gathered and the pages of Ways of Survival fluttered.\u2013T-This?\u00a0This, is\u2026!Numerous texts emanated a faint light and floated in the darkness. It was the chapters of Ways of Survival that I had read.[The exclusive skill, \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 is activated!]The complexion of the theatre master changed as he dug into my head. He looked at the strings around him and his face whitened.\u2013Don\u2019t, tell, me, you\u2026ahhh!This was the last thing he said. Strangely, he looked at me in awe.The moment Blade of Faith was about to cross his neck, a dazzling light came from his body. It was like a ghost touching a divine light or the penalty for breaking a taboo.He was destroyed without a trace.I looked down at my hands and felt dazed.\u2026What just happened?[The \u2018Theatre Master\u2019s Simulacra\u2019 has been killed for the first time.][You have obtained 9,000 coins as compensation.][You have met the conditions to clear the hidden scenario!][You have obtained 4,000 coins as compensation.]These messages rose. I looked back and saw Yoo Jonghyuk collapsing after being released from the theatre master\u2019s control. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t die. The same was true for Lee Gilyoung, who had forcibly used Diverse Communication.\u201cHyung\u2026\u201dI rushed over and embraced Lee Gilyoung. Lee Gilyoung lost strength and fainted in my arms.[The barrier surrounding the Theater Dungeon has disappeared.]The barrier covering the ceiling vanished and I looked at the insect king. Surprising, it turned around and fled. It was like all interest had vanished. I breathed out with a sense of relief.It was over.\u201c\u2026Are you okay?\u201dJung Heewon and Lee Jihye staggered over.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Heewon-ssi?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay. Fortunately, Jihye is safe.\u201dLee Jihye was hit a lot by Yoo Jonghyuk and she couldn\u2019t speak because her mouth was swollen.[The ending time for the third main scenario is approaching!]Perhaps it was time for the end.I looked around the rooftop and saw that dawn was coming, making the day brighter. If Lee Hyunsung was here, he would recite the \u2018homeland\u2019 prayer.Jung Heewon groaned.\u201cAh\u2026 Seoul.\u201dThe ruined city area was illuminated by the faint light of dawn. I heard intermittent explosions from far away. Now there was no more poisonous fog. The poisonous rhinos were crushed under the collapsed buildings. I could see people fighting among themselves. They were probably a group that ended the scenario before us. The entire landscape was trapped inside a huge dome.It was a large barrier that seemed to be breaking.Currently, Seoul was isolated in a transparent dome.Jung Heewon said, \u201cReally\u2026it is all ending.\u201dIt was a scene that had to be acknowledged once again.I looked at the collapsed buildings and thought that Mino Soft would be somewhere there. Yoo Sangah would be disappointed. It was because Yoo Sangah was a person who worked hard. Lee Gilyoung wriggled in my arms.\u201cHave you regained consciousness?\u201dLee Gilyoung nodded and pointed to the sky.From a distance, a meteor shower seemed to be falling. The meteor shower was originally the forerunner of the main scenario. However, the number of meteor showers was more than before.It meant the \u2018hall\u2019 would open soon.The meteor showers were probably falling all over the world.Jung Heewon admired it.\u201cPretty\u2026\u201dJung Heewon didn\u2019t know. The meteors that looked beautiful from a distance would make a nightmare for the people where it fell.Now a bigger disaster would come.Lee Gilyoung gathered his small hands together and muttered something. Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye were silent for a while. Maybe they were also praying.It was funny. Wishing to the beings who would become a source of nightmare, it was probably only human beings who did this in the entire universe.After a while, Lee Gilyoung opened his eyes and looked up at me.\u201cHyung isn\u2019t making a wish?\u201dI looked down at Lee Gilyoung and replied.\u201cI have made a wish.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGilyoung, you shouldn\u2019t ask that.\u201d Jung Heewon scolded him.I watched Jung Heewon, Yoo Jonghyuk and then the collapsed Seoul again.\u201cI wish to see the novel\u2019s epilogue.\u201dLee Gilyoung looked at me with confusion.I silently gazed at the sky. There were slight cracks in the sky above Seoul. Once the sun rose, the dokkaebis would open a new hell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I want to give him another hit in the back.\u201dI headed downstairs with Jung Heewon. I carried Lee Gilyoung, who had completely fallen asleep after the meteor shower.The dungeon disappeared and it turned into an ordinary theatre. The items in the rewards room on the 5th floor were turned into ordinary stage props. It was as if everything that happened yesterday was a dream.Then BIhyung\u2019s voice was heard.[\u2026Do you know what I am going to say?]\u2018Yes.\u2019[Sigh\u2026I nearly fell down.]I felt a little relieved as I listened to Bihyung\u2019s grumbles.The constellations were powerful but they weren\u2019t omniscient. It was because all the sounds and images of the scenario were transmitted through the \u2018channel.\u2019 What did this mean?\u2018Was it filtered properly? I was too excited that I said too much.\u2019[Of course it was. Is there something wrong with my channel? That level of information is automatically filtered.]If my thoughts were correct, the words I said to Yoo Jonghyuk would be conveyed to the constellations in the following way.\u2013Do you really think so?\u00a0You have already forgotten the determination of your \u25a0\u25a0 attempt.-Why are you alone?\u00a0When you \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 like a fool in the \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0, when you cried over your \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0!When your loved one gave \u25a0\u25a0 to a \u25a0\u25a0!-Helping people and fighting against the damn\u00a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0!\u00a0\u00a0When you finally \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 before the \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0!\u201dIn fact, I didn\u2019t know how much filtering there was.It might be more than this, but it wouldn\u2019t be weak. In the original work, Yoo Jonghyuk experienced information being blocked this way at the beginning, even when information about \u2018regressors\u2019 was spreading.[The constellations didn\u2019t hear anything. Don\u2019t worry. The problem is that even I didn\u2019t hear much.\u2018\u2026You didn\u2019t hear it?\u2019This was a bit odd. The dokkaebi also couldn\u2019t hear the information?[Yes, that\u2019s right. What were you talking about?]Information that even the dokkaebi didn\u2019t know. I had one guess. Perhaps\u2026 the constraints of \u2018probability\u2019 had begun? I naturally came up with something from Ways of Survival.\u300c \u2018Probability\u2019 is a great deterrent that controls the Star Stream. \u300d\u2026I was reminded of it but it didn\u2019t help me straight away. One of the reasons why Ways of Survival was ruined was that there were too many settings the writer didn\u2019t know well.\u2018What is the reaction among the constellations?\u2019[They are fed up. There is still an uproar about what you were talking about.]I guess so. The constellations experienced a filter and the movie suddenly changed into a silent movie.If they were smart, they should start paying attention to the possibilities I had. The fact that my words were filtered meant I knew information that shouldn\u2019t be revealed at the present time.[A few constellations are watching you to explore your secrets.][The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 is excited by your existence.][2,000 coins have been sponsored.]I thought Bihyung had forgotten.[I received so many indirect messages that I didn\u2019t send them to you.

Unfortunately, she heard something. Jung Heewon was closer than Lee Jihye and no human-to-human filtering is possible\u2026Lee Gilyoung let out a loud snoring noise. I decided to be half honest.\u201cI know part of the future.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dJung Heewon thought about something for a while. She seemed to be wondering if my words were true or not. Then Jung Heewon seemed to have decided as she bit her lips.\u201cDo Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung know?\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t know yet.\u201dI answered in earnest and Jung Heewon stepped away from me with Lee Gilyoung.\u201c\u2026Surely you aren\u2019t going to kill me?\u201d\u2018Why are you saying this all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cNormally, a development like \u2018You know too much about me\u2019 will occur\u2026\u201dWhere did this normal development come from? Somehow I seemed to be a bad person.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the normal development is but I would\u2019ve already killed Heewon-ssi if I wanted to.\u201d\u201cActually, that is a bit weird.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t have bad thoughts. It is actually the opposite.\u201d\u201cThe opposite?\u201dI looked into Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes and said.\u201cThe future scenarios will be more dangerous. You might almost die many times and might lose preciouse things.\u201c\u2026So?\u201d\u201cSo\u2026\u201dI looked into Jung Heewon\u2019s increasingly nervous eyes and said.\u201cPlease stay with me from now on.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt means to be my companion.\u201dIt was time to make my people. \u2018Trustworthy people\u2019 who wouldn\u2019t easily betray me.Jung Heewon, who I helped awaken and could read her mind, was the most suitable talent. Jung Heewon looked blank for a moment.\u201cDokja-ssi didn\u2019t consider me a companion before?\u201d\u201cIt is actually the opposite. I\u2019m not the one who doesn\u2019t think of you as a companion.\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s eyes shook.I deliberately took a step back.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be companions, think of it as a deal. I need Heewon\u2019s strength and my information will be helpful to Heewon-ssi. It is give and take. The important thing is that our relationship won\u2019t change in the future.\u201d\u201cIt is a bit abrupt\u2026 Do I have to answer now?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dFor a person like Jung Heewon, a leisurely approach was better than a hasty and emotional one.

Especially if I fought against people with \u2018other variables\u2019 that I didn\u2019t know.Then a loud noise was heard from downstairs.\u201cThink about it.

They were still like this.\u201cWhere did that bastard Kim Dokja go? Tell me quickly.\u201dLooking closer, I saw that the Landlord Alliance were harassing Lee Hyunsung. I deliberately walked towards them and spoke in a loud voice.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, Lee Hyunsung-ssi.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dAn alliance member cried out as soon as I came down to the platform of Line 4.I saw a familiar landlord uncle.

There was an electric current in the air.[The fourth main scenario will start in 5 minutes!]Along with the system message, Dokkaebi Bihyung appeared.[Hahaha, everyone!

Hercules\u2019 Shield flew out of my hands into Lee Hyunsung\u2019s hands.\u201cT-This?\u201d\u201cI picked it out for you. Throw away what you previously used.A big smile appeared on Lee Hyunsung\u2019s face.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has used the exclusive skill \u2018Wide-Area Defense!]A translucent shield centred on Hercules\u2019 Shield surrounded our party. Indeed, this was the secondary skill attached to an A-grade item.\u201cWah, what is this?\u201dPeople groaned as they ran into the air shield.\u00a0 They tried to break the protective shields with their old weapons but it couldn\u2019t be broken with E-grade or F-grade items. In the end, the alliance members had only one place to turn to.\u201cPildu-ssi!\u201d\u201cOut of the way!\u201dThe level of Armed Zone had risen considerably and there was already a small Armed Zone under Gong Pildu\u2019s feet. He reduced the area to shorten the cooldown time. He was using his brains.Well, I had to handle it properly.\u201cPildu, did I tell you to get up yet?\u201d\u201cHeok?\u201dGong Pildu\u2019s head once again slammed into the ground as he fell flat.[Under the terms of the contract, \u2018Command Rights\u2019 is activated!]\u201cKeep your head on the ground until I tell you to get up.\u201dThe perplexed alliance members shouted at Gong Pildu.\u201cP-Pildu-ssi?\u201d\u201cP-Pull me up! Quickly!\u201dThe terrified alliance members tried to raise Gong Pildu up but it wasn\u2019t easy because Gong Pildu was very heavy.\u201cAnd\u2026 it is annoying so turn off the turrets.\u201d[The character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 has released \u2018Armed Zone Lv. 6!]\u201cT-This bastard\u2026!\u201d\u201cShut your mouth as well. Stay silent for 30 minutes.\u201d[Under the terms of the contract, \u2018Command Rights\u2019 is activated!]\u201cOof oof oof!\u201dThe alliance members became completely panic stricken once Gong Pildu became powerless with just a few words. Of course, the same was true for Lee Hyunsung, Yoo Sangah and Jung Heewon.I said with a smile, \u201cNow everyone seems to have figured out the situation and I\u2019d like to talk to you\u2026\u201dI could see people wincing and withdrawing.There were roughly 29 people left. 20 members from the Landlord Alliance and nine extra people, including me and my party. The number wasn\u2019t high but it was better than I thought. It was because having too many people at the beginning was difficult to control. I watched them and said.\u201cNow you have two choices.\u201dIt was time to pick a side.\u201cThe first one is to leave Chungmuro and go to another station. Or stay here with me.\u201d\u201cW-What are you saying so suddenly\u2026?\u201d\u201cJust answer me. Will you remain here or will you go elsewhere? You better decide before the main scenario starts. Or else your life will be in danger.\u201dThe eyes of the people present started to quickly move. Someone looked at me, someone else looked at Gong Pildu and another person looked at the tunnel leading to another station. I could tell their thoughts just be looking at them.\u201cI won\u2019t stop anyone who wants to leave. But anyone who stays here will be under my control.\u201d\u201cControl\u2026?\u201d\u201cBehaviour like the Landlord Alliance\u2019 is no longer acceptable. I won\u2019t allow tyranny over a small group.\u201dA handful of people watching me furtively started to stand by my side. They had been treated harshly by the Landlord Association and thought it was better to stick with me. It was a good judgment. A few alliance members shouted.\u201cIn the end, you are going to reign!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t deny it. But I won\u2019t take taxes or survival money.\u201d\u201cIs our safety guaranteed if we enter your group?\u201dA man from the alliance asked. Well, they bothered the tenants so much that it was natural to worry.\u201cI\u2019ll guarantee some outside safety but I won\u2019t interfere with what is going on inside. You must deal with conflicts between individuals yourself.\u201d\u201cT-That\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you one minute. You have until then to decide.\u201dThere was no need to wait for one minute. People had already made up their minds. Some of the alliance members walked over to me with determined expressions and bowed their heads. They were relatively young.\u201cThank you in advance. I was wrong in the past. Thank you for your generous forgiveness.\u201d\u201cIt is a pleasure. You don\u2019t have to ask for forgiveness from me.\u201d[Some members within the group fell a sense of trust towards you.]However, several others decided to leave Chungmuro. They tried to raise the fallen Gong Pildu.I watched them and said, \u201cAh, leave Gong Pildu. That guy is mine.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you have decided then leave quickly.\u201dThe five alliance members frowned at this and withdrew.\u201cKang-ssi! Do you really not want to come with me? It is better than staying under him!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s all go! Are you really going to serve that guy? You\u2019ve seen him!\u201dBut there were no more defectors.The five men cursed a few times before heading for the tunnel towards Myeongdong. They wanted to gain land elsewhere and become new \u2018landlords\u2019. Unfortunately, their plan would fail. In the fourth scenario, the people \u2018wandering\u2019 were good prey to predators.Once five minutes passed, the system messages popped up.[The sub scenario has ended.][You have earned 1,000 coins as compensation.][The white flag will show its true effects to the Chungmuro representative.][Current Group: 24 people.][Your reputation is still too weak to gain the title of king.]The title of king\u2026Indeed, it was hard to get the title of king with just a white flag. In order to walk the proper king\u2019s road, I had to change the colour of the flag. Of course, the white colour had its own \u2018authority.\u2019[You have gained control of the Chungmuro Group through the effect of the white flag.][You can punish a group member who goes against you.][There are currently five people who have left.]I could give a \u2018punishment\u2019 to the five distant men but I left it alone. Terror was effective in controlling people but such tyranny wasn\u2019t suitable for me.\u201cWell, thank you.\u201dI said while looking everyone in the eyes.Lee Hyunsung was looking at me with respect while Yoo Sangah and Jung Heewon nodded. The rest of them were looking at me with similar expressions. They were still rabble but it wasn\u2019t a bad start.Shortly afterwards, Bihyung appeared in the air.[Ohu, you have voted for a representative. Then let\u2019s start the game!][The fourth main scenario is activated!]+[Main Scenario #4 \u2013 Struggle for the Flag]Category: MainDifficulty: CClear Conditions: (Hidden because there are many contents)Time Limit: 12 days.Compensation: 2,000 coins.Failure: ???+I press the clear conditions.Numerous messages appeared in front of me.+[Clear Conditions]1. Every station has a \u2018flag\u2019 and \u2018flagpole\u2019 that can be occupied.* The flag can only be carried by the \u2018representative\u2019 of the station.2. You need to protect the flag from other station groups. If a flag is taken away by another group, the losing group will be taken over by the group that occupied the flag.3. You can put a \u2018flag\u2019 in the \u2018flagpole\u2019 of another station. The authority of the flag is only for the \u2018representative\u2019 of each station. Once the representative dies in an armed conflict, the authority of the representative is transferred to the person who holds the flag first. If you take the \u2018flag\u2019 of another station group, the treatment of the group deprived of the flag is determined by the group that took the flag.4. You must occupy the \u2018flagpole\u2019 of the \u2018target station\u2019 within a certain time limit. Failure to do so will result in the death of all group members.5. The target station your group should occupy is Changsin Station.+Jung Heewon thought for a moment before opening her mouth.\u201c\u2026We have to keep our flag and flagpole while putting out flag in other stations. Am I understanding it right?\u201d\u201cThat is how I understood it. We must take the flag to Changsin Station.\u201d Lee Hyunsung also spoke.Then I said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Everyone has understood.\u201dJung Heewon narrowed her eyes at my words. She knew I was pretending not to know. Now that I knew the future, she kept looking at me. I grinned towards Jung Heewon.Yoo Sangah touched her shoulder and said.\u201cAgain\u2026 we once again have to fight against people?\u201dLee Hyunsung thought for a moment before replying.\u201cIt said that we can decide on the treatment of the group if we occupy their flagpole\u2026 hopefully there might not be any casualties.\u201d\u201cAh, I see. That death won\u2019t necessarily occur if we take over the station? If we can accept the members of that station group when deciding the treatment\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, it is possible to clear it without anyone dying.\u201dLee Hyunsung replied with a smile. However, my heart wasn\u2019t comfortable.It seemed like Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung were trying to understand the world with some saintly logic.There was no such thing as a scenario where no one died. The fourth scenario would have more casualties than any precious scenario.As if she knew my heart, Jung Heewon changed the topic.\u201cWhat line is Changsin Station? I think we should know that first.\u201dLee Hyunsung confirmed it on the route map.\u201cLine 6. If we go to the tunnel, we can use the transit route\u2026\u201d\u201cThen we should split the group. How about a few people guarding this place while others go to scout?\u201dI didn\u2019t have to say anything as they actively exchanged opinions. It was somewhat heartwarming.[The activation of the scenario will turn off Chungmuro Station\u2019s safety borders.][You can now freely move to other stations.]As people were exchanging their opinions, I approached Gong Pildu.\u201cGong Pildu, you can speak now.\u201dThe command was turned off but Gong Pildu couldn\u2019t easily open his mouth.\u201cI know that you feel badly towards me. But you have to adapt. The days when you are a landlord are over.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI know why you have been so obsessed with \u2018land.\u2019 But do it moderately. If you want to survive in the future. Don\u2019t you have something to do?\u201dGong Pildu\u2019s eyes were shaky. I continued speaking.\u201cYou will be in charge of protecting this place.\u201dJust like the third scenario, Gong Pildu was very useful for the fourth scenario. As longa s Gong Pildu protected this place, Chungmuro would be safe unless someone on Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s level came.\u201cWhy should I speak to you\u2026?\u201d\u201cThis time I won\u2019t enforce it with a command. If you follow my request, there will be a reward.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThink carefully. Think about your family.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGong Pildu\u2019s eyes became bigger at my words.\u201cYou, how\u2026!\u201dAt this moment, noise was heard from the tunnel.Baang~!There was a loud horn sound and headlights shone on the railway of line 4.

It meant variables had appeared.In the darkness, the headlights turned off and there was the sound of people talking.\u201cAh, we finally made it to Chungmuro.\u201d\u201cReally, it took them a long time to break the scenario.\u201d\u201cHey, be quiet. They are going to hear. And don\u2019t you know that the scenarios are different between stations?\u201dI watched as the people came closer with weapons. The most important thing in a battle was to take the lead first. I went forward, followed by Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon, then Yoo Sangah in the rear. Lee Gilyoung was still sleeping.How many seconds passed? The four men and women in the darkness walked towards this side. I opened my mouth.\u201cStop there.\u201d\u201cEh? Well well.\u201dThe people stopped in their traces when they saw the blade I was pointing. There were white bikes beside them. I heard weapons being pulled out but a man\u2019s voice was faster.\u201cWait a minute. Calm down. Oh, I can\u2019t even talk because I am too scared.\u201d\u201cPut down your weapons and slowly come this way.\u201dThe man put down his weapon and approached with both hands raised. Once he entered the light, the man\u2019s impression wasn\u2019t bad. He gave off a reasonably favourable impression. His thin eyes were in a gentle curve.\u201cDon\u2019t be too wary. We didn\u2019t come here to fight.\u201d\u201cThen why did you come?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s start with the introductions. I\u2019m Kang Ilhun and I help manage the Dongdaemun Group.\u201dKang Ilhun? Nobody popped up in my head straight away. Furthermore, the representative of Dongdaemun\u2026 things were becoming strange.[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]Since the skill worked, he was certainly a character in the novel.[Character Information]Name: Kang IlhunAge: 31 years oldConstellation Sponsor: Shameless Good GossiperPrivate Attribute: Rumours Expert (General)Exclusive Skills: Weapons Training Lv. 2, Art of Communication Lv. 3, Spread Rumours Lv. 1.Stigma: Making a Commotion Lv. 1.Overall Stats: Stamina Lv. 12, Strength Lv. 13, Agility Lv. 13, Magic Power Lv. 10.Overall Evaluation: Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t develop his character due to the wrong sponsor. But he is a person with good ability who can be used. He spreads rumours regardless of truth or lies, so be careful.Rumours Expert\u2026 It was time for these guys to start acting. Kang Ilhun looked at me with slight impatience.\u201cYour name is\u2026?\u201d\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d\u201cAh, Kim Dokja-ssi\u2026?\u201dA flash of wonder corssed Kang Ilhun\u2019s face as he heard my name. However, it was only for a short moment.\u201cNice to meet you, Dokja-ssi. Since you have a flag, you must be a station representative?\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dHe looked closely at the colour of my flag and then the people around me. It was to confirm the power on our side. He was keen eyes but unfortunately, he met the wrong opponent.\u201cIf you have seen enough, get to the main point.\u201d\u201cHahat. I beg your pardon. We also need to be concerned about safety.\u201d Kang Ilhun continued speaking without any panic. \u201cOnce again, we didn\u2019t come to fight. What if we came with a good offer?\u201dI watched Kang Ilhun\u2019s party. None of them had a flag.\u201cHow can I believe that?\u201d\u201cHmm, won\u2019t you know if you check the rules? If we came to fight, we would\u2019ve come with the representative. Only the representative can occupy the flagpole.\u201dIt was true. It was obviously true.\u201cWhat is the offer?\u201d\u201cWe came to ask for an alliance.\u201dAt these words, the members of Chungmuro started murmuring. Kang Ilhun shook.\u201cAh, you are uncertain because Chungmuro just opened. In fact, the fourth scenario has already been in progress for two days.\u201d\u201c\u2026Two days?\u201dYoo Sangah reflexively muttered. Kang Ilhun nodded.\u201cYes, the third scenario is slightly different in content and duration between stations\u2026 perhaps you didn\u2019t know this?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThe third scenario was just over but I already knew this. In the original story, Chungmuro was a latecomer in the scenario compared to other stations. In other words, we started with some losses in terms of information.In that sense, Kang Ilhun\u2019s alliance offer was a timely temptation. Information was required and this was beyond our strength. The problem was what did the other side gain?\u201cIt is a difficult offer to accept. I don\u2019t know if you have an ulterior motive.\u201d\u201cHrmm, Dokja-ssi\u2019s words are definitely right. You won\u2019t believe in the alliance so I will first state what we will get from the alliance. In short, Chungmuro isn\u2019t our \u2018target\u2019 station.\u201d\u201cHow can I believe that?\u201d\u201cYou can believe it or not. But please think about it. If Chungmuro was our target, we would\u2019ve dragged the main force of our station here. To be honest, the flagpoles are most vulnerable just after the station is open.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t very persuasive.\u201cWhat will you do if our target station is Dongdaemun?\u201d\u201cHaha, there is no need to worry about that. We already know the station that is targeting us. We didn\u2019t come to you for no reason.\u201d\u201cI see. Let\u2019s clear the scenario by helping each other, since our targets are different\u2026 is that what you mean?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Isn\u2019t it good to help each other at this time?\u201dKang Ilhun smiled and nodded. I was silent for a moment and Yoo Sangah opened her mouth.\u201cI have a question.\u201dKang Ilhun grinned at Yoo Sangah.\u201cYes, what is it pretty girl?\u201d\u201cWhy did you come to Chungmuro? If you came from Dongdaemun, you could\u2019ve made an alliance with other stations.\u201dIt was an unexpectedly sharp point. Kang Ilhun looked slightly confused.\u201cOh, that\u2026 as I told you, Chungmuro just opened. I mean\u2026 um, the other stations have already formed alliances. But I thought that Chungmuro wouldn\u2019t have\u2026 haha, I have to ask, has Chungmuro already made an alliance?\u201dHrmm\u2026\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t.\u201dKang Ilhun looked happy at my words.\u201cThen form an alliance with Dongdaemun. You won\u2019t regret it. Above all, we have a \u2018winning solution\u2019 for this scenario.\u201d\u201cA winning solution?\u201d\u201cYes, in fact, our group knows the hidden secrets of this scenario.\u201dKang Ilhun grinned and drove in the last nail.\u201cWe will tell you if you agree to an alliance with us.\u201d*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *After a while, I sat with Yoo Sangah, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon to exchange opinions. Yoo Sangah spoke.\u201cWhat do we do? Should we establish an alliance?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to disagree. I can\u2019t believe them. I feel uneasy.\u201dOnce Jung Heewon spoke, Lee Hyunsung gave his opinion.\u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t be bad if they have information about this scenario. Certainly, we can\u2019t fully trust them as Heewon-ssi said\u2026\u201dFinally, they looked at me. I shrugged.\u201cThen for now\u2026\u201dOnce we made a decision, we called over Kang Ilhun and the Dongdaemun Group, who were looking around Chungmuro Station.\u201cI will make a decision once I have met your representative.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d\u201cWhere is your representative?\u201d\u201cAt Dongdaemun. If you don\u2019t mind, I will guide you\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease do so.\u201dWe got on the back seats of the bikes they came on. The people I took with me were Lee Hyunsung, Yoo Sangah and Jung Heewon. Lee Gilyoung was left behind with Gong Pildu. It was because he overused Diverse Communication and hadn\u2019t woken up yet. Of course, I didn\u2019t forget to give an order to protect Lee Gilyoung.\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201dThere was the sound of the bikes turning on and we started moving. Once 20 seconds had passed. I opened my mouth.\u201cBy the way Kang Ilhun-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThose people, did they say anything else about Chungmuro?\u201d\u201cHuh? What does tha\u2026\u201d\u201cFor example, if you come here then there will be a very scary man called Yoo Jonghyuk\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha, what are you sayin\u2026\u201dI gave a signal and our party jumped from the back seats of the bikes at the same time.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi!\u201dYoo Sangah used Binding Thread and tied the four bikes together. There was a roar as the bikes collided with each other.Kwaaaang!\u201cAaaagh!\u201dThe Dongdaemun members screamed as they crashed down.Fortunately, our party was safely hanging in the air due to Yoo Sangah\u2019s thread tied to the ceiling. It was a type of seat belt. It was an incredible feat that made Yoo Sangah seem like Spiderman.Kang Ilhun was covered in dust as he lay on the ground and shouted.\u201cW-What are you doing?\u201d\u201cWhat am I doing? That is what I want to ask.\u201d I looked at the dark tunnel. \u201cIn order to ambush us, you should raise the level of the stealth a bit more.\u201dIt was enough for me to detect despite not having Absolute Senses. Kang Ilhun noticed something was wrong and screamed.\u201cAttack them!\u201dAt almost the same time, people hiding all over the tunnel emerged. I knew it. They were aiming for my flag.[The character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 has activated the exclusive skill \u2018Judgment Time.\u2019][The Absolute Good constellations have agreed to the use of this skill.][\u2019Judgment Time\u2019 has been activated.]\u201cEh? I thought it might not\u2026 isn\u2019t this a complete mess?\u201dJung Heewon laughed with a surprised expression.\u201cIt is hard to find bad people.\u201dJung Heewon spoke in a cold voice and her sword flashed through the dark tunnel. Her eyes were red from using Demon Slayer. The bloody light swept through the darkness as people were slaughtered.\u201cW-What?\u201d\u201cThis crazy girl\u2026! Aaaagh!\u201dSeokeok!\u00a0Seokekeok!There were 10 peope but Jung Heewon killed them without a hitch. It was a scene that showed how much Jung Heewon\u2019s stats had risen after the hidden dungeon was cleared.I also used White Pure Star Energy and easily suppressed Kang Ilhun. A few hours ago, I was dealing with Yoo Jonghyuk. This guy wasn\u2019t very difficult.\u201cDokja-ssi, Chungmuro\u2026!\u201dI looked back at Lee Hyunsung\u2019s cry and saw that there was a commotion in Chungmuro. They were ambushed as soon as we left Chungmuro. I left Kang Ilhun to be tied up by Yoo Sangah and rushed to Chungmuro.There was already a melee happening on the platform. But I decided to watch the situation for a while. There was something I needed to check first.\u201cWhat are these bastards!\u201dDozens of group members that ran from the Myeongdong direction waved weapons at the people of Chungmuro. By the way, the weapons they were carrying were familiar.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat is Kim-ssi\u2019s weapon!\u201dThe Landlord Alliance members who headed towards Myeongdong had already been hit by these guys.

Gong Pildu was truly a scam.\u201cKuuack! Huddle up!\u201dThe Myeongdong group gathered together in a tight defense formation but it wasn\u2019t enough to endure the shells from the level 6 Armed Zone. It was a rewarding site that made leaving him to clear the Emergency Defense scenario alone worth it.Kwang!\u00a0Kwaang!\u00a0Kwaaaang!How many shots were fired? The enhanced magic bullets caused the Myeongdong Group to be riddled with holed and collapse. Gong Pildu was scary as an enemy but strong as an ally.\u201cT-There wasn\u2019t information about this!\u201d\u201cRetreat!\u201dBut there was no place for them to run away.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d[The special option of Unbroken Faith is activated.][The ether property is converted to \u2018fire.\u2019]Chwaaaaak!The ether blade made of flames created a wall of fire that blocked their escape. The moment that the confused people hesitated, Gong Pildu shot at them.Dududududu!\u201cP-Pierce through! Quickl\u2026cough!\u201dThe Myeongdong representative was hit in the head by a magic bullet and the flag was released.Gong Pildu\u2019s eyes shone as he found the flag. Sheesh, this brat.\u201cDo you want me to step on your back again?\u201dThe running Gong Pildu stiffened.\u201cDamn\u2026\u201dI immediately picked up the Myeongdong flag that had fallen onto the tracks. Focus vanished from the eyes of the desperate Myeongdong Group members.[You have won the flag of the \u2018Myeongdong Group.\u2019][Your white flag has absorbed the cumulative achievements of the red flag.][Your white flag has evolved into a red flag.]I felt a stronger force swirling inside my body.[You are one step closer to the King\u2019s Road.]The flags after the red flag improved not just the abilities representative but also the surrounding group members.Apart from overall stats or S-grade and above items, the flag was one of the few ways to improve basic combat power. Due to this, groups aimed at stations other than the \u2018target\u2019 station.The other \u2018king candidates\u2019 would\u2019ve already entered a full-fledged war to change the colour of their flags.The stronger they became, the more they could enjoy this world.[The remaining members of the Myeongdong Group are waiting for your decision.]I grabbed one of the wounded Myeongdong members in the area and asked.\u201cWhy did you aim for Chungmuro?\u201dI had realized something when I first heard Kang Ilhun\u2019s words. It was true that Chungmuro had just opened but it didn\u2019t make sense for them to rush in like they had been waiting. The observations of the party and the strange look he made when he knew I was the representative..These guys knew about this station from the beginning. I brought my blade to the man\u2019s neck and asked.\u201cTell me, who gave you the information of Chungmuro?\u201dThe most likely people were the Prophets. The guys I met in Theatre Dungeon mentioned \u2018hidden information\u2019 that other people didn\u2019t know.I had been searching through Ways of Survival but I never saw the group name Prophets. If so, who were they?There were two hypotheses.One, due to an unknown variable, a new prophet had appeared apart from Anna Croft.The second\u2026 besides me, there was another \u2018reader\u2019.Honestly, I thought it was probably the latter. The \u2018prophet\u2019 attribute wasn\u2019t so easy to obtain. Furthermore, Prophets was a plural\u2026Well, I could check it from now on.I looked at Gong Pildu and said, \u201cBy the way\u2026 why didn\u2019t you act more moderately?\u201d\u201cWhy should I show mercy to those running wild?\u201dGong Pildu looked annoyed.Unfortunately, the people of Myeongdong Group weren\u2019t able to answer because they had been hit by too many bullets. As soon as I asked them a question, they coughed up blood and died.In the end, I could only ask one person. I looked down at Kang Ilhun who was behind guarded by Lee Hyunsung. His eyes rolled uneasily while he was tied up with Binding Thread.Yoo Sangah asked, \u201cWas everything planned from the beginning?\u201d\u201cI thought there was a high probability. As soon as the station opens, two groups will unite and attack. It was a prior promise.\u201d\u201cSaying things with such a good face\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s expression became dark.\u201cAre you sorry? There isn\u2019t going to be an alliance.\u201d\u201c\u2026A little bit.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t believe in people too much. Things won\u2019t be as easy as you think in the future.\u201cI know. Still\u2026 if possible, I wanted to believe. I was able to come here because I believed in someone.\u201dYoo Sangah looked at me.\u201cHey, how long are the two of you going to talk? Quickly pry the information out.\u201dJung Heewon interrupted us. Indeed, now wasn\u2019t the time to give life advice. I released the thread blocking Kang Ilhun\u2019s mouth.Kang Ilhun was trying to stay calm.\u201c\u2026What will you do with me now?\u201d\u201cIt depends on how much information you can give me.\u201d\u201cAre you basing the standards on usability?\u201dThis guy talked back even in this situation, there was more to him than I thought. If so, I had to use a hard-line method\u2026Jung Heewon said, \u201cIn any case, the constellations see him as \u2018wicked.\u2019 How about trying torture?\u201d\u201cWhy bother with torture? Just kill him if he doesn\u2019t speak.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dI pulled out my sword without hesitation. Kang Ilhun trembled as he looked up at me.\u201cFrom now on, I will count to three. If you don\u2019t open your mouth in that time, you will die. There is no reversal.\u201dI deliberately triggered White Pure Star Energy and inserted the sword into the ground.\u201cOne.Kudududuk!The ground was scratched with the power of White Pure Star Energy as the blade started to move towards him. Fragments of the floor flew towards his face.\u201cTwo.\u201dThe heat of the blade warmed his face as it approached his nose. In a short time, the ether blade would cut his eyeballs.\u201cThree\u2026\u201d\u201cDongmyo Station!\u201dI smiled. Torture? There was no need for that.Kang Ilhun gasped for breath and explained, \u201c\u2026The people from Dongmyo Station gave us information about Chungmuro.\u201dDongmyo, who was there?\u201cWho was it?\u201d\u201cHe called himself a Prophet\u2026\u201dBy the way, this guy\u2019s condition was strange. His eyes were rolling and his tongue hung out like a dead person. I had an ominous feeling.Surely it wasn\u2019t \u2018Suggestion.\u2019\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, hurry and block his mouth with a thread!\u201dFortunately, Yoo Sangah\u2019s threat blocked this guy\u2019s mouth before it could close. Using Suggestion to control information from leaking\u2026 they were more meticulous than I thought.On the other hand, it was easier for me to solve the problem. Suggestion was a skill that could only be used face-to-face.I looked down at Kang Ilhun and stated.\u201cYou are a lucky guy.\u201dIf he was present, I could definitely identity one of the Prophets.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Before I went on the full-fledged search, I headed to the roof of the theater.\u201cHe still hasn\u2019t woken up?\u201dMaybe it was because she didn\u2019t know I was coming but Lee Jihye shook. Yoo Jonghyuk was still unconscious and lying on her knees.Jerk, he was the main character yet he wasn\u2019t going through any hardship. Meanwhile, I was the tired one despite being the reader.\u201cHow is it downstairs?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry and rest.\u201d\u201cMaster\u2026 will he be okay?\u201d\u201cHe will be fine. Although there might be some trauma left.\u201d\u201c\u2026Trauma?\u201d\u201cHis mental state is more fragile than a child\u2019s. He will be a bit better after a good sleep.\u201d\u201cIt sounds like you know a lot.\u201d\u201cI know him the best in this world.\u201dI spoke in a dry tone and pulled out some paper, writing on it with a pen. I filled it with notes and handed it to Lee Jihye.\u201cDon\u2019t read it but give it to Yoo Jonghyuk when he wakes up. Do you understand?\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201dShe said so but Lee Jihye would definitely read it. However, Lee Jihye wouldn\u2019t be able to understand it since it was filled with things only Yoo Jonghyuk would know.By the way, did the information on the paper also look like \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 for the constellations?[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 hates \u25a0.]Indeed. I was turning around when Lee Jihye opened her mouth.\u201cBy the way, can I ask you something?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cEarlier, with Master. Master and Ahjussi\u2026\u201dSomehow I seemed to know what Lee Jihye would say. Damn, Lee Jihye heard as well as Jung Heewon?I\u2019ve been stupid. I only considered the constellations and never thought about the humans listening. Yoo Jonghyuk would laugh at my stupidity.What was a good excuse?\u201cWell, that. You two.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d I decided to feign ignorance.Lee Jihye\u2019s expression became more serious.\u201cI mean, Ahjussi\u2019s words.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cWake up you jerk! Don\u2019t fall into those sentiments!\u201dLee Jihye imitated my voice and shouted. I felt embarrassed suddenly hearing my words emerge from someone else\u2019s mouth.\u201cFor the first time, that.. that determination! Have you already forgotten?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dWasn\u2019t something strange? This child, she almost heard it at the filtered level?\u201cI came here because of you! Why are you alone? We are together!\u201d\u201cNo, wait a minute.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always been around you! Don\u2019t lose hope! Think of the child!\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t what I\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy did I come here if you are alone\u2026!\u201dI stared at Lee Jihye for a moment.\u2026No, how could she hear it this way?\u201cS-Something like that? Ahjussi, you and Master\u2026\u201dI sighed. \u201cThink what you want.\u201d\u201c\u2026Indeed. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll give him this love letter!\u201dI shrugged and turned around. Behind my back, Lee Jihye\u2019s bullshit continued.\u201cWait! How did you give birth to a child?\u201d\u201cAsk Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201dYes, Yoo Jonghyuk, I leave everything to you. The next moment, indirect messages exploded in my head.[Some constellations are greatly affected by the truth of the filtering.][The constellation Prisoner of the Golden Headband respects your taste.][The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 likes your comradeship.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 thinks it is ridiculous.][600 coins have been sponsored.]\u2026Damn, there were other idiots.

Dongmyo Station was important but there was something to be done first.I killed the Myeongdong Representative and taken the flag so I had to hurry and occupy the empty station.Lee Hyunsung spoke in a worried tone.\u201cIs it okay with just us?\u201d\u201cThere won\u2019t be a fight. I will decide what to do with them. If I leave it alone, they will die soon.\u201dThe \u2018wanderers\u2019 who lost their group would become prey to other groups if they weren\u2019t lucky. Just like the Landlord Alliance members who left Chungmuro Station.But the moment we arrived at Myeongdong Station, we saw an unexpected sight.\u00a0The people in Myeongdong Station had already been hit by someone.\u00a0It was also very gruesome.I saw a group of men standing near Myeongdong Station.\u00a0The men were flustered and quickly fled in the direction of Hoehyeong Station. It wasn\u2019t easy to chase them because they had bikes.It was as if they knew I was coming.\u00a0There was more than one or two odd things.Lee Hyunsung asked,\u00a0\u201cWho are these people? What happened?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cEven Dokja-ssi doesn\u2019t know\u2026\u201dLee Hyunsung gulped nervously.\u00a0Fortunately, the flag holder of Myeongdong Station was empty.[Currently there is no group occupying Myeongdong Station.][Are you sure you want to take over the station?]I plugged the flag into the flag holder and pulled it out again.\u00a0Then a flag that was the same as mine appeared in the flag holder.[You have occupied Myeongdong Station.][A station that has been occupied can\u2019t be taken from you unless the \u2018main base\u2019 or flag is taken away.][Currently Occupied: Chungmuro (Main Base), Myeongdong][The achievement points of the red flag are rising.]The red colour of the flag turned darker.[Your influence has expanded by taking over a new station.][The hidden scenario has arrived!][The King\u2019s Road has begun!]+[Hidden Scenario \u2013 King\u2019s Road]Category: HiddenDifficulty: AClear Conditions: Take over a minimum of 10 stations within the time limit.Time Limit: 10 daysReward: The attribute of a \u2018king\u2019.Failure: If you can\u2019t take over a minimum of one station per day, you and your group members will all die.+I finally arrived at the terrible hidden scenario.\u00a0Once I started this quest, I couldn\u2019t turn back.\u00a0There were only two fates for a king.Become a king or die.[The new king candidate has started to walk along his road!]From now on, it was the full-fledge flag struggle.*\u00a0 * *I returned to Chungmuro, gathered the party members and told them about the hidden scenario. Jung Heewon made an interested expression while Lee Hyunsung looked confused. Yoo Sangah was as anxious as always.\u201cIt sounds like a difficult scenario\u2026 Dokja-ssi, will it be okay?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dAn angel or a fool.. In this situation, they were worried rather than jealous about the hidden scenario.Lee Hyunsung said,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad that Dokja-ssi is the king candidate.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cThen should I call you Your Majesty?\u201dI was hit in the head by Jung Heewon after being touched by Lee Hyunsung\u2019s serious words.\u201cI don\u2019t want that.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, based on this hidden scenario, shouldn\u2019t we go occupy a new station right away? You should think about the lives of your subjects.\u201d\u00a0Jung Heewon said sarcastically.I nodded.\u201cI think we need to find out about the people who attacked us. I\u2019ll go straight to Dongmyo. Jung Heewon-ssi and Lee Hyunsung-ssi, will you go with me?\u201dYoo Sangah raised her hand at my words.\u201cThen I\u2026\u201d\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi will stay here.\u201d\u201cAh, really\u2026 on the other hand, more\u2026\u201dI listened to Yoo Sangah\u2019s voice and it sounded glum.\u00a0Perhaps Yoo Sangah was thinking that she was useless.Her damage wasn\u2019t as strong as Jung Heewon and she didn\u2019t have a strong physique like Lee Hyunsung. In addition, she didn\u2019t have a powerful trump card like Gilyoung.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dAll her previous \u2018specs\u2019 had become obsolete in this new world. But she was too good to be jealous of other people. Thus, her inferiority complex was quietly festering.\u201cYoo Sangah, not everyone can do the same things well.\u201d\u201cYes, I am aware of that.\u201d\u00a0Yoo Sangah smiled weakly.I spoke carefully so that she wouldn\u2019t feel it was an admonishment.\u00a0\u201cDo you remember the words that you said on the subway? Dokja has a solo life and I will\u2026\u201d\u201cI will have an ivory life. Yes, I remember. I wrote it on the notepad of my smartphone.\u201dWhy did she look so elated?\u00a0In any case, I couldn\u2019t hate it. I continued speaking.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi has things to do here. I can\u2019t leave the unconscious Gilyoung alone. I need someone to monitor Gong Pildu and to control the nervous group members.\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s eyes shook.\u201cBesides, the Hoehyeon forces must be kept in check. They might attack while we\u2019re away. Gong Pildu is here but Yoo Sangah\u2019s Binding Thread might be necessary.\u201d\u201cC-Can I do this role well\u2026?\u201dYoo Sangah spoke weakly because of her low self-esteem.\u201cHey everyone. In that way\u2026 I will give Yoo Sangah-ssi a job position. What do you think?\u201dLee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon thought for a moment before nodding.\u201cOkay, I can trust it if it is Yoo Sangah.\u201d\u201cKing\u2026 if you wish then do so\u2026\u201dI glared at Jung Heewon.\u00a0Did she think that was funny right now?[You are using the unique permissions of a representative.][Chungmuro Station\u2019s representative, Kim Dokja is transferring some of his authority to group member \u2018Yoo Sangah.\u2019][Group member \u2018Yoo Sangah\u2019 has become the deputy of Chungmuro Station.][In the future, group member \u2018Yoo Sangah\u2019 can deal out punishments on behalf of the representative.]Yoo Sangah looked at me with stunned eyes and stuttered. She looked terrified.\u201cG-Giving, giving this position to me\u2026\u201d\u201cI will leave it to Yoo Sangah-ssi.\u201dI meant it. Once again, not everyone could do the same things well. Based on what I remembered, Yoo Sangah would be appropriate for this.Yoo Sangah was the best person in the human resources department, not someone else.\u201cOh\u2026I\u2019ll do my best.\u201dYoo Sangah bowed before slowly raising her head.\u00a0Tears could be seen in her eyes.*\u00a0 * *We headed straight for the tunnel on the east side.We had to pass three stops before arriving at Dongmyo. We moved with the fainted Kang Ilhun. Honestly, taking this guy was a burden but I needed him to identify the faces. When I looked back at Chungmuro, I could hear Yoo Sangah\u2019s voice.\u201cEveryone, please gather!\u201dAs I expected, Yoo Sangah worked harder in the shadows. The people were already organized and were receiving their orders. Sentries were set up and people were put in charge of different areas. Some of the landlords said they wouldn\u2019t listen to Yoo Sangah but\u2026[Chungmuro Station\u2019s deputy, Yoo Sangah has used the punishment.]I vaguely heard someone moaning.\u2026Was this okay? Well, it should be fine.Jung Heewon looked at my face and said,\u00a0\u201cGood job. I felt that Yoo Sangah had been a bit depressed.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t select Yoo Sangah-ssi because I was thinking of her emotions. I thought Yoo Sangah-ssi would do really well.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, is that so? Then please me something later. It should fit me.\u201d\u201cHow about an executioner?\u201d\u201c\u2026Forget it.\u201dJung Heewon grumbled and turned her head away.\u00a0It was good after all the jokes she played.\u201cBut that gangster on the roof, is it okay to leave him?\u201d\u201cOh, you mean Yoo Jonghyuk?\u201d\u201cI guess his name is similar.\u201d\u201cIt will probably be fine.\u201d\u201cIt sounds like you know him very well. What is it?\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u00a0I thought for a moment before asking.\u00a0\u201cHeewon-ssi, do you have a younger sibling?\u201d\u201c\u2026? Yes. Why?\u201d\u201cA brother or a sister?\u201d\u201cA brother.\u201d\u201cHow old is he?\u201d\u201cHe is one year younger.\u201d\u201cHow is it having a brother?\u201d\u201cAnnoying. He easily defies me and I had to take him to school instead of my mother\u2026\u201dJung Heewon feel silent as she was complaining about her brother. She gazed somewhere in the air. Then I asked her.\u201cBut now you are worried about him right?\u201cWell\u2026 we are family.\u201d\u201cI am similar.\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi also has a younger brother?\u201d\u201cNope, I\u2019m talking about Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u00a0Jung Heewon looked at me and nodded.\u00a0\u201cThen do you like or hate him?\u201d\u201cI hate him. I fought with many people because of him.\u201dI wasn\u2019t the only reader of Ways of Survival in the early days. Quite a few people followed along out of curiosity up to the 10th chapter. There were also 12 readers at the 50th chapter.There was a guy who liked Kim Namwoon\u2026 while I argued with him.\u00a0I wonder if any of the people who fought with me back then were alive.\u00a0Maybe the people I was going to catch now was one of them.\u201cYou two, you seem to have become very close.\u201dLee Hyunsung interrupted and I suddenly realized I was walking too close to Jung Heewon.Jung Heewon smiled.\u201cWhy, soldier ahjussi. Are you jealous?\u201cHrmm. It isn\u2019t like that\u2026\u201dCome to think of it, \u00a0didn\u2019t Lee Hyunsung join the army right after going to a male high school? I felt sorry for Lee Hyunsung when I thought about the setting.\u201cIt seems we have arrived at Dongdaemun History and Culture Park Station.\u201dIn fact, the entrance of Dongdaemun History and Culture Park Station could be seen in the distance.We nervously stuck to the tunnel wall and looked around. It was in case troops were waiting. But this worry was pointless. Jung Heewon muttered.\u201cIt is strange. There are no sentries.\u201dThe fact that there was no guards while Struggle for the Flag was ongoing meant that the station had already been eaten by another group. Once we confirmed this, we immediately approached the flag holder.[The station has already been occupied by \u2018Dongmyo Station.\u2019][If you want to occupy the station, take the flag of Dongmyo Station or occupy its flag holder.]It was as expected.Then Kang Ilhun\u2019s body twitched. His body was shaking like he was having seizures and his condition was strange. I released the thread blocking his mouth and Kang Ilhun shouted.\u201cN-No\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026What is this all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cD-Dongdaemun\u2026 Dongdaemun Station\u2026!\u201dSaliva spilled from Kang Ilhun\u2019s mouth as he stuttered.\u00a0I felt something and unintentionally put a hand on his shoulder.Then.[The character Kang Ilhun is now a wanderer.]It was evident that Kang Ilhun\u2019s affiliation to \u2018Dongdaemun\u2019 had changed.\u00a0Jung Heewon asked,\u00a0\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d\u201cIt seems that Dongdaemun Station has been taken over.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dSuddenly everything made sense.\u00a0Yes.\u00a0The people who leaked the information had this in mind.\u201c\u2026A double trap.\u201dThey incited the Myeongdong Group and Dongdaemun Group to strike Chungmuro because they knew the two groups would die in Chungmuro. While the main force were gone, they wanted to take Myeongdong and Dongdaemun.

That reminded me, what was the description of Yoo Jonghyuk in Ways of Survival? There wasn\u2019t a detailed appearance but the word \u2018handsome\u2019 was attached. And my face\u2026Could this be considered a fictional allowance?\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cAh, nothing.\u201dHis tone became politer. I didn\u2019t know what was going on in there but his head was probably in a complicated state right now.At least one thing was certain.\u00a0The man in front of me had clearly read Ways of Survival.I became more certain because he wasn\u2019t registered in Character List and he was surprised to hear Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s name.His eyes urgently returned to Lee Hyunsung by my side.It was inspecting the attribute\u2026 I see. Was he digging up information? I deliberately gave him some time to observe Lee Hyunsung before opening my mouth.\u201cImpertinent person. You better move your eyes carefully.\u201d\u201c\u2026Heok?\u201dHe confirmed Lee Hyunsung\u2019s name and also noticed that he could view my character window with Detect Attributes. I didn\u2019t know how far he had read in Ways of Survival but there were a few characteristics that could be used to identify Yoo Jonghyuk.One of them was the SS skill, Sage\u2019s Eyes which allowed for universal detection and protection against detection skills. Now he would be convinced that I had Sage\u2019s Eyes.\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t know that you peeked at me with a B-grade skill?\u201dThe spasms started from the man\u2019s eyes and spread through his face.Then his eyes wandered to the red flag I carried on my back. It was as I guessed. There were limits to the evidence that he could find about Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201cYou son of a bitch\u2026!\u201dOne of the men in the group hadn\u2019t figured out the situation and pointed a spear at me. The moment that Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung was about to come forward.Peeok!The man\u2019s head burst and red blood splattered like a fountain. The group immediately screamed. From beyond the blood, I saw a serious looking man.\u2026Look at this bastard?\u00a0He slowly walked through the crowd towards me.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Such a distinguished person had to see a horrible sight.\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201dThe man tried to manage his expression at my cold tone. He was pretty good. If I was him, I would like like my heart was going to burst.\u201cI will formally introduce myself. My name is Lee Sungkook. I am the deputy in charge of Dongmyo Station.\u201dThis guy approached and bowed before me.\u00a0I liked it.\u00a0Then I started the full-fledged Yoo Jonghyuk cosplay.After I snapped at him, I opened my mouth and spoke in a cold voice.\u201cDongmyo Station? I see. Then get out.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cThis is my station from now on so get out.\u201dThis guy\u2019s mouth dropped open.\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to listen to me?\u201dI looked down at the flag holder that had the Dongmyo flag.\u00a0Lee Sungkook belatedly understood my point.\u201cT-That is impossible.

I continued speaking.\u201cDoes it sound like I am joking? Two.\u201dWas it hard to remember after reading the novel 10 years ago?\u00a0It looked like he forgot who Yoo Jonghyuk was.\u00a0Then I had to jog his memory.[The exclusive skill \u2018White Pure Star Energy Lv. 2\u2019 has been activated.][Blade of Faith is activated!]Chiiiiiing!I saw Lee Sungkook\u2019s pale face beyond the burning white blade.\u00a0This was a game of chicken.Remembering Yoo Jonghyuk meant he knew a bit about who Yoo Jonghyuk was.If he knew how ruthless the early Yoo Jonghyuk was then he would never be able to continue this game.If he didn\u2019t know Yoo Jonghyuk properly?\u00a0Then it didn\u2019t matter.\u00a0I would play the game and run away if we were going to lose.\u00a0Now I had enough strength.At this moment, Lee Sungkook hurriedly shouted.\u201cW-Wait a minute!

Our representative will be greatly looking forward to seeing Yoo Jonghyuk-nim. Please give our group a chance to talk with Yoo Jonghyuk-nim.\u201d\u201cYou know me?\u201d\u201cHow can I not know Yoo Jonghyuk-nim?\u201dLee Sungkook shut his mouth the moment he said this. He thought he said something strange. Yoo Jonghyuk couldn\u2019t be famous this early on.\u201cA-Anyway, it will be an honour if you accompany me.\u201dI stared at him and replied.\u00a0Yes, this level was acceptable.\u201cOkay, show me the way.\u201dLee Sungkook\u2019s expression brightened and he added useless words.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.

There was the sound of wind being blown from the lungs and Lee Hyunsung moaned.As expected from Jung Heewon.\u00a0She didn\u2019t know the exact situation but she knew how to match the mood.I muttered out of the side of my mouth.\u2018You know what to do without me telling you?\u2019\u2018Yes, roughly.\u2019I watched Jung Heewon and then Kang Ilhun being carried by Lee Hyunsung. The most important person right now was that guy.\u2018Make sure to restrain that guy. Understood?\u2019Jung Heewon nodded and made a strange gesture.\u00a0She kneeled in front of me and cried out in an exaggerated voice.\u201cYes Jonghyuk! I will do as you say!\u201dAnyone who saw it would think about medieval knights.\u00a0The funny thing was that the surprised Lee Hyunsung did the same thing.\u201cI-I will do as you say\u2026!\u201dLee Sungkook, at the head of the group, was surprised to hear these two voices. It was embarrassing but the result was good. I couldn\u2019t read Lee Sungkook\u2019s inner thoughts but it would be like this if I could read it.\u300c He must be Yoo Jonghyuk. \u300dLee Sungkook met my gaze and quickly turned his head back to the front.\u00a0This was how a main character felt.Not long afterwards, we arrived at Dongmyo Station.They were a pretty powerful group seeing as many people were on the platform. There were some people with weapons like Lee Sungkook\u2019s group, but most of them didn\u2019t have any.They were probably wanderers from other stations who lost their group.\u201cMove faster!\u201d\u201cI-I understand.\u201dThey were slaughtering the ground rats while being supervised by the Dongmyo members or disassembling the corpses of the monsters to make equipment.The so-called \u2018slave\u2019 class.\u00a0It was a common scenery in the age of kings.Jung Heewon frowned.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a real kingdom\u2026\u201dI spoke to Jung Heewon.\u201cDon\u2019t be disgusted. Wait here and look at the situation.\u201d\u201cYesss\u2026\u201dI\u2019m ignoring Jung Heewon and started to observe the surroundings.\u00a0It was to take into account additional variables.Dongmyo was quite important in the original novel.\u00a0If I remembered correctly\u2026 the representative of this place was the \u2018invalid.\u2019But the story was likely to have changed if the Prophets intervened.\u00a0I looked at the back of Lee Sungkook\u2019s head.At this point, I had two questions.\u00a0One, did Lee Sungkook have his own text version?\u00a0Two, how many prophets were there?And if I had to say a third question, did they have the same \u2018skills\u2019 as me\u2026It didn\u2019t seem like it. Otherwise he would\u2019ve used Character List instead of Detect Attributes at the beginning.Besides, he didn\u2019t seem to have the Fourth Wall when I used Character List.\u00a0In other words, he was a case like Lee Gilyoung.Well, I read over 3,000 chapters. It would be unfair if they received the same perks as me when they only read a few chapters.Speaking of which, I don\u2019t think they had a text version\u2026By the way, what was this person looking so hard at?\u00a0Lee Sungkook was looking at his smartphone.[5,000 coins have been invested in agility.][Agility Lv. 20 -> Agility Lv. 30][An amazing agility lies in your body.]I approached Lee Sungkook like a ghost.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat are you looking at so hard?\u201d\u201cH-Huh?

It was unbelievably luxurious for such a shabby tent.There was a red carpet and a bed that seemed to have been stolen from a luxury hotel. There was a round table for a meeting and a small desk with a computer.The most interesting thing was the boy concentrated on surfing the Internet.

You have fought against terrible enemies and struggled against the beings of this world to save people. Enduring alone, lonely memories\u2026 We respect your sublime spirit.\u201dThis jerk, such skillful flattery.\u00a0Yoo Jonghyuk would be moved to tears if he heard.\u00a0Later when he was depressed, I would have to tell him these words.\u201cBut Yoo Jonghyuk-nim should\u2019ve realized it from your past regressions. Even if you have an outstanding miracle, you alone can\u2019t fight against the disasters that will come.\u201dPlus, he was right.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk-nim, this time will be different. It is because we are here. We Prophets have received a special blessing and have been sent to help you.\u201dWow, look at this?Lee Sungkook smiled faintly.\u201cYou must be wondering. Why did these guys who didn\u2019t appear last time suddenly show up now? It is very confusion but I hope you can trust us. It is because we have already received a revelation for this day 10 years ago.\u201d\u201c\u2026Revelation?\u201d\u201cYes. In our world, there is a \u2018revelation\u2019 that is secretly shared among the Prophets. Yoo Jonghyuk exists in it and is a living myth. It is a single revelation that records all of the past and future.Wait.\u00a0Don\u2019t tell me \u2018that\u2019 was the revelation?\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me yet. We already knew that Yoo Jonghyuk-nim would gather Lee Hyunsung. They didn\u2019t come with you but you probably already have Delusion Demon Kim Namwoon and Maritime Admiral Lee Jihye. But that isn\u2019t enough. At the very least, according to the revelation\u2026\u201dI hid my nervousness and asked.\u201cWhere is the revelation?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, it has been damaged and we can\u2019t find the original. \u00a0Don\u2019t worry.

It was because Lie Detection couldn\u2019t distinguish such falsehoods.That\u2019s why I felt it even more.\u201c\u2026It is surprising.\u201dIt was true.\u00a0I was shocked beyond surprise.\u00a0This was a great \u2018setting.\u2019\u00a0A setting that was squeezed out in a short amount of time.\u00a0Human creativity was really great.\u201cYou are called Sungkook?\u201d\u201cYes, Yoo Jonghyuk-nim.\u201dI could write the book Ways of Survival.\u00a0In order to help the hero who kept dying, readers received a revelation and came from outside the novel?\u00a0This was more exciting than the real Ways of Survival.\u00a0But that was it.\u201cDon\u2019t go around in circles.\u201dThis was it.\u201cGet straight to the point.\u201dI heard the set up so it was time to speak.\u201cYou have received the revelation of the future. Then what exactly are you going to do?\u201dLee Sungkook quickly replied.\u201cWe would like to form an alliance with Yoo Jonghyuk-nim. I-It is an alliance in name but it actually means going under you\u2026\u201dHe was a funny guy.\u00a0In the end, this was his purpose?\u00a0Riding the bus that was the main character?\u201cI see. An alliance. You want this.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt is an interesting suggestion.\u201d\u201cThis means\u2026\u201dI tapped my fingers against the table.\u201cBut the order is wrong.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHow can I form an alliance with people whose identities I don\u2019t know? If you want to ally with me, isn\u2019t this the first thing you should start with?\u201d\u201cM-My identity\u2026 I already\u2026\u201dI got up from the chair and sat on the plush bed in the room. Then I crossed my legs and declared.\u201cKneel down.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cKneel.\u201dLee Sungkook was embarrassed for a moment before getting down from his chair while hiding his expression.\u00a0As his knees slowly reached the floor, I opened my mouth.\u201cTell me your attribute.\u201dOnce I saw the strong hypnosis on the king candidate, I guessed this guy\u2019s attribute. However, I needed to make sure.Lee Sungkook looked up at me with complicated eyes.\u00a0His mind was probably working hard.\u00a0He would think this.\u300c Yoo Jonghyuk can see my information with Sage\u2019s Eyes. \u300d\u300cHe already knows it so what is the reason for asking about my information? \u300dLee Sungkook struggled for a moment before speaking.\u201cMy attribute is\u2026 Hypnotist.\u201dAs expected, it was Hypnotist.\u201cI see.\u201dLee Sungkook looked a bit brighter at my nod.\u00a0He thought he had passed a test.\u201cIs that all?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dLee Sungkook\u2019s eyes shook.\u201c\u2026O-One more.\u201dI nodded.\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cT-The 9th\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe 9th?\u201dLee Sungkook slowly lowered his head like he was ashamed.\u201cThe 9th person\u2026 to get off.\u201dI see.\u00a0This brat, the 9th\u2026\u2026No, wait. Then how many people were there?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Omniscient Reader\u2019s ViewpointChapter 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 11 \u2013 Night of the Prophets (4)\u201cThe 9th person to get off.. it is the first time I\u2019ve heard of this attribute.\u201d\u201cOh, you probably wouldn\u2019t have. This is the first time us Prophets have seen it.\u201dThis brat was giving an excuse.\u00a0I wanted to tease him a bit.\u201cBut it is strange. If you really received the revelation, why aren\u2019t you a \u2018revelator\u2019 instead of \u2018someone who got off\u2019? What is with this name?\u201d\u201cT-That\u2026 the revelation\u2026 no, the book of revelation\u2026\u201dLee Sungkook stuttered. It was delightful watching him try to avoid Lie Detection. I wondered how honest he could be. Lee Sungkook finally closed his eyes.\u201cWhen I read the book of revelation\u2026 I stopped!\u201d\u201cYou stopped reading it? Why didn\u2019t you read it?\u201d\u201cThe contents of the Book of Revelations are very difficult, vast and profound\u2026\u201d\u201cThen you were the 9th person to get off?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that will be of much help to me.\u201d\u201cN-No! I can definitely help you!\u201dThe confused Lee Sungkook continued to speak gibberish while uneasily turning his smartphone off and on.\u201cWhy do you keep touching that smartphone?\u201d\u201cI-I-I\u2019m sorry. I am a smartphone addict\u2026\u201dHe was trying to get advice from the other ones who got off.\u00a0But that didn\u2019t last long.\u201cAre you going on the Internet?\u201d\u201cY-Yes, that\u2019s right. It is the ability of the hermit\u2026\u201dAt Lee Sungkook\u2019s words, I looked towards Han Donghoon.\u00a0The hypnotized boy was busy tearing at his fingernails with empty eyes.The Hermit King of Shadows who had the powerful information manipulation ability.\u00a0This boy couldn\u2019t be kept under the prophets.If the Prophets became involved in the story in this way, the original novel was ruined and the plans I set up would be wasted.\u00a0I had to stop these guys before everything went wrong.\u201cDo the other prophets also have the attribute of \u2018getting off\u2019?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cHow many are there in total?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u00a0Lee Sungkook hesitated for a moment before opening his mouth.\u00a0\u201cAs far as I know, there are 48 people.\u201d48 people?\u00a0It was smaller than I thought.Considering that chapter 1,200 had one hit and chapter 120 had 10 hits, I thought there would be at least 100 people.Lee Sungkook\u2019s words resolved my curiosity.\u201cI know there were more prophets originally but I expect most of them didn\u2019t pass the first scenario.\u201d\u201cThey are dead despite knowing the future?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 we have received the revelation but we only recently realized that it was a \u2018true\u2019 revelation.\u201dNow it made a little sense.Perhaps at the start of the scenario, few readers thought that a novel that started serialization 10 years ago would become a reality. They might not remember it straight away.I thought it was strange that Lee Sungkook survived.\u00a0Furthermore, this guy was the ninth person to stop reading so he was literally one of the earliest readers. Then how did he survive?\u201cI fortunately survived the carriage. If it hadn\u2019t been for another prophet nearby, I would\u2019ve died.\u201dAnother prophet in the same place as him?\u201cThat\u2015\u201dThe moment that Lee Sungkook was about to speak, the ground slightly shook.\u00a0The vibration was transmitted despite Sound Wave Blocking.Lee Sungkook and I ran out of the tent at the same time.Kung!I thought it was a sudden sub scenario but that wasn\u2019t it. Two people stood in the centre of the epicenter. The man and woman facing each other. I didn\u2019t know the man but the other person was\u2026\u201cYou aren\u2019t a supporting role\u2026 yet you dare to push me?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about, you dog-like jerk.\u201d\u2026Not surprisingly, it was Jung Heewon.\u201cWhat? Dog\u2026? You bitch!\u201dThe man grabbed a very large ring sword from his back. His overall level seemed in line with Jung Heewon\u2019s. But it wasn\u2019t enough.Jung Heewon movements were already above incarnations of the same class.\u00a0Jung Heewon\u2019s blade moved lightly as the man attacked.[The character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 has activated the special option of Mikazuki Munechika, \u201cDeath God\u2019s Footsteps\u2019\u2026]\u201cJung Heewon!\u201dJung Heewon stopped his black just before she cut off the man\u2019s head. The hairs were rising on the man\u2019s neck.It was a tremendous difference in speed. If I hadn\u2019t intervened, the man would be dead.The startled Lee Sungkook cried out,\u00a0\u201cJung Minseob! What are you doing now?\u201dI realized it when I saw Lee Sungkook\u2019s confusion.[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]Then the expected message popped up.[The information of this person can\u2019t be read in \u2018Character List.\u2019][This person isn\u2019t registered in \u2018Character List.\u2019]That\u2019s right.\u00a0He was also a Prophet.* * *After a while, another prophet was on his knees in front of me, with Lee Sungkook next to him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my friend didn\u2019t know anything\u2026 Hey, apologize quickly!\u201dThe man sitting beside him bowed towards me.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dUnlike Lee Sungkook. he was a very prideful person and couldn\u2019t completely remove the anger from his face. I looked at Jung Heewon and said,\u201cJung Heewon, I told you not to be reckless.\u201d\u201cT-This bastard\u2026!\u201d\u201cJung Heewon!\u201dJung Heewon made a surprised expression for the first time.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry, Yoo Jonghyuk-nim.\u201dJung Heewon bowed and turned to leave, Lee Hyunsung following her with a strange expression. I knew that Jung Heewon wasn\u2019t the type to raise a sword to someone for no reason.However, it was dangerous to move in this current situation.The other man looked at me and asked,\u00a0\u201cAre you really Yoo Jonghyuk-nim?\u201d\u201cYes, are you also a prophet?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dThere was a complicated expression on his face. He looked between me, Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung. Then he glanced at Lee Sungkook and said.\u201cExcuse me, Yoo Jonghyuk-nim. I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to leave you for a moment. Sungkook, talk with me for a minute.\u201dHe left the tent while Lee Sungkook bowed to me.\u201cI won\u2019t wait long.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t be like this if it was the original Yoo Jonghyuk.\u00a0But I had a reason for allowing them to talk.\u00a0As soon as Lee Sungkook left the tent, I immediately called to Bihyung.\u2018Hey Bihyung.\u2019[What is it? Having fun again\u2026]\u2018Hearing enhancement, 2,000 coins.\u2019[\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.]Now Bihyung had adapted. It took less than three seconds before an advertisement went up.[2,000 coins have been consumed.][The exclusive skill \u2018Hearing Enhancement\u2019 has been acquired.]Bihyung warned.[Hey, be careful from the fourth scenario onwards. For such a wide-scale scenario, the intermediate dokkaebis have jurisdiction\u2026.]I ignored Bihyung\u2019s words.[The exclusive skill \u2018Hearing Enhancement Lv. 1\u2019 is activated.]I moved my body outside the tent blocked by Sound Wave Blocking.\u00a0Then voices started to be heard.\u00a0They weren\u2019t too far from where I was hiding.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t it slightly strange?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDo you see that as a handsome face?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about suddenly\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe author said that Yoo Jonghyuk was handsome.\u201dThis bastard?\u00a0Fortunately, Lee Sungkook dismissed it.\u201cThe author might have different tastes\u2026 He is Yoo Jonghyuk for sure. He has the same dirty nature.\u201d\u201cYou only got off at the 9th chapter, what do you know\u2026?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026! You don\u2019t really remember it since you read it a long time ago!\u201d\u201cStill, aren\u2019t some scenes pretty clear with the \u2018Memory Benefits? Would you even remember the prologue without this privilege? You might not be alive if it wasn\u2019t for me\u2026\u201dTheir voices were coming closer.\u201cIt is weird no matter how I look at it. Setting aside Lee Hyunsung, who is that strange woman? If I remember correctly, there wasn\u2019t such a woman in the third regression.\u201d\u201cThen check it. See if he is really Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201d\u201c\u2026But what if he is real?\u201d\u201cWe will go according to plan. If we get Yoo Jonghyuk here, we can deal with those who read until the 50th chapter.\u201dSome really good information was coming in.\u00a0Despite wanting to hug onto the main character, these guys were unleashing all types of curse words because of their situation.\u00a0This was why they were humans.Lee Sungkook and the man was coming closer.\u201cI apologize for the long wait. Let\u2019s go inside.\u201dWe went back into the tent.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk-nim. I apologize for my previous disrespect. I will greet you again. I am Jung Minseob.\u201dThe man smiled and bowed.Once again, this guy had pretty good items for being beaten by Jung Heewon. In particular, there was the useful Fugitive\u2019s Mask which allowed the user to freely change their face and appearance.I cut to the chase.\u201cThen where did you get off?\u201dJung Minseob glared at Lee Sungkook.\u00a0He seemed to be saying something with his eyes.\u201c\u2026The 1,089th person to get off.\u201d1,089. Considering the number of views for chapter 1,200 was 1 and the number of views for chapter 120 was 10, this guy was a person who got off quite late.Maybe this was the guy who saved Lee Sungkook in the first scenario.\u201cAs a prophet who has read the Book of Revelation, I am glad and honoured to meet Yoo Jonghyuk-nim. However, Yoo Jonghyuk-nim\u2026 I\u2019m sorry but can I ask you some questions?\u201d\u201cQuestion? What is the question?\u201d\u201cThat, regarding Yoo Jonghyuk\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you doubt that I\u2019m the real Yoo Jonghyuk?\u201d\u201c\u2026T-That\u2019s not it.\u201dHis face was red from my intense gaze.\u201cTry it.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cAsk me.\u201dThe confused Jung Minseob nodded.\u201cUm\u2026 Then excuse me.\u201dIn order to properly trick these guys, I had to keep a few things in mind.\u201cAs far as I know, Yoo Jonghyuk took Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon as a companion in the third regression. Yet you have a strange woman with you instead of Kim Namwoon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought she was Lee Jihye but she doesn\u2019t seem to be in her teens. I also heard you calling her a different name.\u201dHis memory and observation skills were quite good.\u00a0Like Jung Minseob said, this world had already changed from the third turn that I knew.\u00a0Now I had to shift this changed world to \u2018suit my taste\u2019 as much as possible.\u201cIf you are asking me why I don\u2019t have the Delusional Demon with me, the answer is simple. In this turn, the Delusional Demon doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d D-Doesn\u2019t exist? Perhaps\u2026 did he die?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYes.\u201dTheir faces were filled with confusion for a moment. Jung Minseob asked,\u00a0\u201cNo, how\u2026 Who the hell killed Kim Namwoon?\u201d\u201cThe Delusion Demon Kim Namwoon\u2026\u201dThese prophets\u2019 mouths were slowly dropping. Now I would drive in the last wedge.\u201cHe died at the hands of a prophet like you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
