Now, I have forgotten a few, but one thing is certain. The fact that you who are reading this now will survive.-Three ways to survive in a ruined world]A web novel platform filled the screen of my old smartphone. I scrolled down and then up again. How many times have I been doing this?\u201cReally? This is the end?\u201dI looked again, and the \u2018complete\u2019 was unmistakable.The story was over.+[Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World]Author: tls1233,149 chapters.+\u2018Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World\u2019 was a feature-length fantasy novel with 3,149 chapters.Its shortened name was \u2018Ways of Survival.\u2019I have been steadily reading this novel since the third year of middle school.During the time when I was bullied by\u00a0iljins,\u00a0when I ruined my entrance examinations and had to enter a local university, when the damned random draw went wrong and I was placed in the military unit at the forefront, when I repeatedly switched jobs and am now working as a contractor for an affiliate of a large company\u2026 Damn, let\u2019s stop talking about this.Anyway\u2026\u300cAuthor\u2019s words: Thank you so much for reading \u2018Ways of Survival\u2019 up to here. I will come back to you with an epilogue!]\u201cAh\u2026\u00a0The epilogue still remains. Then the next chapter is really the last one.\u201dFrom the end of childhood to adulthood, it had been done over a huge period of 10 years. There was a mixture of despondency that a world was coming to an end along with a sense of satisfaction.I opened the comment box of the last message and rewrote the sentence several times.-Kim Dokja: Writer, thank you for everything in the meantime. I am looking forward to the epilogue.They were sincere sentences. Ways of Survival was my life\u2019s novel. It wasn\u2019t the most popular, but it was the best novel for me.There were many words I wanted to say but I couldn\u2019t write them. I was afraid that my careless words would hurt the writer.-An average of 1.9 hits per chapter.-An average of 1.08 comments.This was the average popularity index of \u2018Ways of Survival.\u2019The number of views for the first chapter was 1,2000, but it fell to 120 for the 10th chapter, and then 12 for the 50th chapter. By the time it was the 100th chapter, it was only 1.Hits= 1.I was overwhelmed by the feeling I got when I saw the numerous \u20181\u2019 that appeared next to the list of chapters. In some cases, there was a \u20182\u2019, but it was likely someone pressing the wrong button.\u2018Thank you.\u2019The author published a novel with more than 3,000 chapters with just 1 hit per chapter over a period of 10 years. It was truly a story just for me.I pressed on the \u2018Recommendation Board\u2019 and immediately started tapping on the keyboard, -I am recommending a honey jam novel.The author wrote me a free completed novel, so I should give him a recommendation.\u00a0I clicked on the completed button, and comments quickly appeared.\u2013It looks like a new anti.\u00a0I searched for this person\u2019s ID, and they recommended the same novel several times.\u2013Isn\u2019t his recommendation banned?\u00a0The author shouldn\u2019t do this here.It occurred to me that I had written a recommendation several months ago.\u00a0In an instant, there were dozens of comments for investigation by \u2018spectators\u2019. My face flushed with embarrassment.I was sure that the author would read this.\u00a0\u00a0So, I hurriedly tried to delete the message, but it was already reported that the message couldn\u2019t be removed.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dIt was upsetting to think that the recommendation written with all my sincerity turned out like this.If they even looked a little bit, why didn\u2019t anyone try reading the interesting novel?\u00a0I wanted to give a donation to the writer, but I couldn\u2019t afford it because I was a salary worker barely able to make a living.Then I received a notification that a \u2018message has arrived.\u2019-tls123: Thank you.A message flew in from out of nowhere. It took me a while to grasp the situation.-Kim Dokja: The author?tls123\u2014it was the author of \u2018Ways of Survival.\u2019-tls123: I was able to complete it to the end thanks to you. I also won the competition.I couldn\u2019t believe it.Ways of Survival won a competition?-Kim Dokja: Congratulations! What is the competition?-tls123: You won\u2019t know it because it is an unknown competition.I wondered if he lied because he was ashamed, but I wanted it to be true.\u00a0Perhaps I really didn\u2019t know. It might be a bit hit on other platforms.\u00a0I was a little sad, but it was good to have an excellent story spreading.-tls123: I would like to send a special gift to you as a thank you.-Kim Dokja: Gift?-tls123: It is thanks to my dear reader that this story has come into the world.I gave the writer my email address as he asked.-tls123:\u00a0Ah,\u00a0right. I got the monetization schedule.-Kim Dokja: Wow, really? When will it start? This masterpiece should\u2019ve been paid from the beginning\u2026It was a lie. The Ways of Survival was a daily series, so I would\u2019ve had to spend 3,000 won a month. 3,000 won was one convenience-store lunch for me.-tls123: The monetization starts tomorrow.-Kim Dokja: Then the epilogue coming tomorrow will be paid?-tls123: Yes, I\u2019m afraid you need to pay for it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu-Kim Dokja: Of course, I have to pay! I will buy the last one!There was no reply from the author afterward.\u00a0I logged out of the site. Then I felt the pessimism sink in later.The author left without a reply after he succeeded\u2026?\u00a0My admiration turned into petty jealousy.\u00a0What was I so excited for? In any case, it wasn\u2019t my novel.\u201cWill he give a gift certificate? It would be good if it\u2019s for 50,000 won.\u201dAt that time, I was thinking naively.\u00a0I didn\u2019t know anything about what would happen to the world the next day.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kim Dokja.\u201dKim Dokja (Kim Highly Respected Only Son)\u2014my father gave me that name to be a strong man by myself.\u00a0However, thanks to the name my father gave me, I turned out to be just a normal single and lonely man.In short, it was like this.\u00a0I was Kim Dokja, 28 years old, and single. My hobby was reading web novels on the subway.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go on my smartphone.\u201dIn a noisy subway, I raised my head reflexively.\u00a0\u00a0A pair of curious eyes were staring straight at me. They belonged to an employee from the human resources team, Yoo Sangah.\u201cAh,\u00a0hello.\u201d\u201cAre you going home from work?\u201d\u201cYes. What about Yoo Sangah-ssi?\u201d\u201cI was lucky. The manager went on a business trip today.\u201d Yoo Sangah sat down soon as the seat next to me became vacant. A subtle scent came from her shoulders, making me nervous.\u201cDo you normally take the subway?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u00a0Yoo Sangah made a dark expression.Come to think of it, this was the first time I\u2019d met Yoo Sangah on a subway train.Starting with Personnel Manager Kang to Finance Manager Han\u2026 There were rumors that Yoo Sangah had men from the company driving her home every workday.Yet unexpected words came from Yoo Sangah\u2019s mouth, \u201cSomeone stole my bicycle.\u201dBicycle.\u201cYou commute by bike?\u201d\u201cYes! I have a lot of overtime these days and seem to be lacking exercise. It is a bit annoying, but it is worth doing.\u201d\u201cAha,\u00a0I see.\u201dYoo Sangah smiled. Looking closer at her, I could understand the feelings men held toward her. However, it was none of my business.Every person had a genre of life, and Yoo Sangah was someone who lived a genre different from myself.After the awkward conversation, we looked at our phones. I opened up the novel app I was reading on before while Yoo Sangah\u2026 What was this?\u201cPor favor dinero.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cSpanish.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see. What does it mean?\u201d\u201cPlease give me some money,\u201d Yoo Sangah replied proudly.Studying on the subway while going home\u2026 She truly had a genre different from me.\u00a0However, what was the use of memorizing words?\u201cYou\u2019re working hard.\u201d\u201cBy the way, what is Dokja-ssi looking at?\u201d\u201cAh,\u00a0I\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s gaze was fixed on the LCD screen of my smartphone.\u00a0\u201cIs it a novel?\u201d\u201cYes, well\u2026 I am studying Korean.\u201d\u201cWow, I also like novels. I haven\u2019t been able to read lately because I don\u2019t have time\u2026\u201dIt was surprising.\u00a0Yoo Sangah liked reading novels\u2026?\u201cMurakami Haruki, Raymond Carver, Han Kang\u2026\u201dI thought so.\u201cDokja-ssi, what writers do you like?\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t know even if I say their names.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve read a lot of novels. Who are the authors?\u201dAt this time, it was really hard to say that I read web novels as a hobby.\u00a0I glanced at the title of the novel in the app.[The World after the Fall]Author: Sing Shangshong (TL: The author uses the name of his previous novel and his author name, but with slight changes. I decided to go with the actual novel translation name)I couldn\u2019t say that I was reading \u2018The World after the Fall by Sing Shangshong.\u2019\u201cIt is just a fantasy novel. That\u2026 Well, like the Lord of the Rings\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAha.\u00a0Lord of the Rings. I\u2019ve seen the movie.\u201d\u201cThe movie is good.\u201dThe silence continued for a moment. Yoo Sangah was looking at me like she was waiting for me to say something.Our conversation was becoming strained.\u00a0So, I decided to change the topic.\u00a0\u201cIt has been a year since I joined the company. This is my last year. Time moves really fast.\u201d\u201cYes. At that time, we both knew nothing, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It seems like just yesterday, but the contract period is already over.\u201d\u00a0I realized that I\u2019d said something wrong when I saw Yoo Sangah\u2019s expression.\u201cAh,\u00a0I\u2026\u201d I had forgotten.Yoo Sangah received credit for a foreign buyer last month and was already promoted to a full-time employee.\u201cAh,\u00a0right. My congratulations are late. I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0Haha,\u00a0I should\u2019ve worked hard to study a foreign language.\u201d\u201cAh,\u00a0no Dokja-ssi! There is still the performance review and\u2026\u201dI hated to admit it, but the sight of Yoo Sangah talking was wonderful. It was like the world\u2019s spotlight was shining down on only one person. If this world was a novel, the protagonist would be such a person.In fact, it was the inevitable result.\u00a0I hadn\u2019t tried, but Yoo Sangah made an effort.\u00a0I just read novels on the Internet, while Yoo Sangah studied hard.\u00a0It was natural that Yoo Sangah would become a full-time employee, and that my contract would be terminated.\u201cThat\u2026 Dokja-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind\u2026 Would you like to know the app I use?\u201d\u00a0Yoo Sangah\u2019s voice momentarily became distant.It felt like the world was far away.\u00a0I braced my mind and stared straight ahead.A boy was sitting in the seat opposite me on the train.\u00a0He was 10 years old or so.\u00a0The boy held an insect collecting net as he sat next to his mother, laughing happily.\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi?\u201dWhat if I had a different life from now?\u00a0I mean, what if my life genre was different?\u201cKim Dok\u2026\u201dIf the genre of my life wasn\u2019t \u2018realism\u2019 but \u2018fantasy\u2019\u2026 Could I be the protagonist?\u00a0I didn\u2019t know. It would probably be unknown forever.\u00a0\u00a0However, there was one thing I knew.\u201cIt is okay, Yoo Sangah-ssi.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t work even if you tell me the app.\u201dThe genre of my life was obviously \u2018realism.\u2019\u201cDokja has a solo life.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u00a0What\u2026\u201d\u201cI am just someone like that.\u201dIn this genre, I wasn\u2019t a protagonist but a \u2018solo\u2019 person.\u201cThe life of a solo\u2026\u201d Yoo Sangah had a serious expression on her faceHowever, I waved my hands to show it was really okay.I didn\u2019t know why, but this person was really worried about me. Maybe because she was part of the personnel department\u2026 I was already aware of my performance though.\u201cDokja-ssi is really good.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThen I will live an ivory life.\u201d (Sangah=ivory)Yoo Sangah seemed to have decided something as she turned back to studying Spanish. I gazed at her for a while before returning to the novel.Everything had returned to normal, but strangely, my scrolling of the novel didn\u2019t go well.\u00a0Maybe it was because I realized the weight of reality that I couldn\u2019t scroll down.At that time, a notification appeared at the top of my smartphone. [You have one new mail.]It was from the author of \u2018Ways of Survival.\u2019\u00a0I opened the mail.-Reader-nim, my novel will become paid from 7 p.m. This will be helpful. Good luck.[1 attachment.]The author said he would give me a gift.\u00a0What was the gift?\u2026Like my name, I was also a reader by nature. So, I was excited to receive the mail.Yes, it wasn\u2019t bad living as a reader.I checked the time. It was 6:55 p.m. I had exactly five minutes before the novel became monetized at 7 p.m.Then I opened up my list of preferred novels in the app. Since I was the only reader, I should leave a congratulatory comment and give strength to the author.However\u2026-The work doesn\u2019t exist.I tried typing \u2018ruined\u2019 several times in the search box, but the result was the same.The bulletin board for \u2018Ways of Survival\u2019 had disappeared without a trace.\u00a0It was strange. Had there ever been a case of a novel being deleted without notification when it was going to be monetized?At that moment, the subway lights turned off, and the inside of the train became dark.Kiiiiiiiik-!\u00a0The subway train shook loudly and let out a metallic sound.It caused Yoo Sangah to scream and grab my arm. Then I heard the sound of other people getting stirred up.\u00a0Yoo Sangah gripped my arm so tightly that I paid more attention to the pain in my left arm than the sudden stop.\u00a0It took a dozen seconds for the train to stop fully.Then I heard confused voices coming from everywhere.\u201cUh,\u00a0what?\u201d\u201cW-What is this?\u201dIn the dark, one or two smartphone lights turned on.\u00a0\u00a0Yoo Sangah still held my left arm tightly as she asked, \u201cW-What is going on?\u201dI pretended to be unconcerned. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes, it is probably a disturbance from a suicide. The engineer will soon make an announcement.\u201dAs I finished speaking, I heard the engineer\u2019s announcement, \u2013Telling all passengers on the train.Telling all passengers on the train.The loud surroundings became calm.I sighed and opened my mouth, \u201cSee, it isn\u2019t a big deal. Now an apology will air, and the power will come back on\u2026\u201d\u2013E-Everyone run away\u2026\u00a0Run\u2026!\u2018What?\u2019There was a beeping sound, and the broadcast turned off. The inside of the train became a mess.\u201cD-Dokja-ssi? What is this\u2026?\u201dA bright light flashed from the front of the subway train. There was a loud drumming sound followed by a\u00a0pop.Something was heading this way in the darkness.\u00a0It was just a coincidence that I saw the clock at this moment\u20147:00 p.m.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTick,\u00a0it felt like the world was stopping.Then I heard a voice:[The free service of planetary system 8612 has been terminated.][The main scenario has started.]This was the moment the genre of my life changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The first time he appeared, someone said so. \u300d[1]I didn\u2019t know why but that sentence suddenly popped up in my head. The stopped subway train, the dark room\u2026 These details gave me a sense of deja vu. The subway had stopped before, but it was rare. Even so, why? I remembered the familiar words from a novel\u2026 but it was ridiculous. Wasn\u2019t it impossible?At this moment, the door of car 3807 opened wide, and the electricity returned. Yoo Sangah muttered by my side, \u201c\u2026Dokkaebi?\u201dMy head was ringing. I trembled uneasily as the novel I knew and the reality before me overlapped.\u300cWith two small horns and wearing a small straw mat, the strange and fluffy creature was floating in the air. \u300d\u300c It was too strange to call it a fairy, too evil to call it an angel, and too tranquil to call it a demon. \u300d\u300cThus, it was called a \u2018dokkkaebi. \u300dAnd I already knew the first thing the dokkaebi would say.\u300c&\uc544#@!&\uc544#@! \u2026\u300d[&\uc544#@!&\uc544#@!\u2026.]Fiction and reality overlapped precisely.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cAugmented reality?\u201dAmidst the chattering people, I was thrown into another world alone. This was unmistakably a dokkaebi\u2014the very dokkaebi that opened the door to tragedy for thousands of lives in Ways of Survival. It was Yoo Sangah\u2019s voice that broke me out of my thoughts. \u201cIt sounds vaguely like Spanish. Should I talk to it?\u201dI was a bit taken aback and asked, \u201c\u2026Do you know what that is? Will you ask it for money?\u201d\u201cNo but\u2026\u201dIt was at this time that I heard the correct pronunciation of Korean. [Ah. Ah. Does this sound good? Ah, I had a hard time because the Korean patch didn\u2019t work. Everyone, can you hear my words?]As a familiar language was being spoken, I could see people\u2019s expressions relax. The first one to step up was a big man in a suit. \u201cHey, what are you doing right now?\u201d[\u2026Huh?]\u201cAre you filming? I have to go because I have to quickly get to an audition.\u201d He seemed to be an obscure actor since his face was unfamiliar. If I were a casting director, I would\u2019ve picked him out for his brimming ambition. Unfortunately, the presence before him right now wasn\u2019t a director.[Ah, auditions. That\u2019s right. This is also an audition. Haha, there was a shortage of data. I just entered when it was monetized at 7 p.m.]\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d[Now, now. All of you, relax in your seats and listen to me. From now on, I will tell you something very important!]My chest was becoming stuffy.\u201cWhat? Quickly get off the train!\u201d\u201cSomebody call the captain!\u201d\u201cWhat are they doing without the cooperation of the citizens?\u201d\u201cMother, what is that? A cartoon?\u201dThere was no doubt about it. This was the development I knew. I didn\u2019t want to be mixed up in this\u2026 but there was no way. The people present wouldn\u2019t listen to the small and cute-looking CG creature. The only thing I could do was stop Yoo Sangah who was trying to get up from her seat.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, it is dangerous, so stay here.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Yoo Sangah\u2019s eyes widened. I spoke during a moment of bewilderment, but there was no way to explain what I understood. To be exact, I didn\u2019t have to explain.[Haha, you are really loud.]There was a presence with a stronger persuasive power than anyone else right now.[I told you to be quiet.]I closed my eyes slowly as the dokkaebi\u2019s eyes turned red. Something burst, and the subway became silent.\u201cUh, uh. Uh\u2026\u201d There was a big hole in the forehead of the unknown actor who had to go to the audition. The man who had spoken several times collapsed on the spot.[This isn\u2019t a movie shoot.]There was a cracking sound once again. This time, it was the person talking about the captain.[It isn\u2019t a dream. It isn\u2019t a novel either.]One, two\u2026 Blood sprayed into the air as the heads of some people started to burst. They were all the people who had protested against the dokkaebi, as well as the ones who screamed or went wild. Those who caused the slightest fuss had a hole in their heads. Suddenly, the subway became a bloodbath.[This isn\u2019t the \u2018reality\u2019 that you know. Do you understand? So everyone shut up and listen to me.]More than half the people present here died. Blood and body pieces filled the subway. Now, the people didn\u2019t scream. Like primitive apes in front of a powerful predator, everyone just watched the dokkaebi with terror. I was surprised and held tightly onto the shoulder of Yoo Sangah who was hiccuping.This was real. The strange message which entered my ears, the dokkaebi had appeared in front of me, and the train car that had become a bloodbath\u2026[Everyone, your lives have been nice so far. Isn\u2019t that right?]In the special needs seating area, an elderly grandmother met the eyes of the dokkaebi.[You have been living too long for free. Isn\u2019t life too generous? You were born and paid no price for breathing, eating, pooping and breeding! Ha! You really live in a good world!]Free? No one in the subway lived for free. The people strived to make money in order to survive, and they rode the subway on the way home from work. Yet at this moment, no one disputed the dokkaebi\u2019s words.[But now the good days are over. How long can you continue living for free? If you want to enjoy happiness, it is common sense to pay a price. Isn\u2019t that right?]The gasping people couldn\u2019t answer. Then at that time, someone carefully raised their hand. \u201cD-Do you want money?\u201dI wondered what type of person could speak in the middle of this situation, but surprisingly, I knew his face.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi. Isn\u2019t that Department Head Han of the finance team?\u201d\u201c\u2026Right.\u201dThere was no doubt. He was a typical parachute [2] in the company and the number one person newcomers avoided. It was Han Myungoh, department head of the finance team. Why was this man riding the subway?\u201cI will give you money. Take it. Please note that I am a person like this.\u201d Department Head Han pulled out his business card as people cheered him on. It was the atmosphere of a savior fighting against terrorists. \u201cHow much do you want? A big one? Or two?\u201dHe was offering a sum that was overly large for a department head of a subsidiary company. There was a rumor that Han Myungoh was the youngest son of the leader of the affiliate company and now I thought it might be true. I couldn\u2019t carry that many cheques in my wallet.[Hrmm, you are giving me money?]\u201cT-That\u2019s right! The cash I have right now isn\u2019t much but\u2026 I can give you anything if you let me out of here.\u201d[Money, good. A plant fibre that many humans mutually agree on.]The department head\u2019s expression brightened. It was an \u2018Indeed, money is everything\u2019 expression. How pitiful.\u201cNow, this is all I have\u2015\u201d[It only applies in your time and space.]\u201cHuh?\u201dAt the next moment, flames appeared in the air, and the cheques in the department head\u2019s hands burned up. Department Head Han let out a scream.[That paper has no value in the macrocosm world. If you do this one more time, I will blow away your head.]\u201cU-Uhhh\u2026\u201d Fear once again spread on the faces of the people present.

In fact, I was surprised because of something else.Army lieutenant Lee Hyunsung\u2026 That \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 was this man.I knew who he was. It was the first time actually seeing his face, but his name was clear in my head.

It is really a level one disaster!\u201dEveryone turned on their smartphones at someone\u2019s cry.\u00a0\u00a0Yoo Sangah turned her screen toward me. \u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi, look at this.\u201dThere was no need to enter a search term.

Thus, everyone should confidently continue with their lives\u2026I hadn\u2019t thought much of it when I read the novel, but now I was a bit shocked when hearing those words.\u00a0Terrorism\u2026 Yes, that would be more comfortable.\u201cBut where is the president? Why is the prime minister making the speech?\u201d\u201cThe president has already been hit.\u201d\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure.

It originated from their smartphones.Chiiiik,\u00a0there was a loud sound, and blood filled the screen.

Okay, this is a special service. I will show you what will happen if nothing occurs in the next five minutes.]A giant screen appeared in the subway.

No one could get out.Peong, peeong.\u00a0The heads of the high school girls continued to burst.\u00a0Then a high school girl strangled her friend, who died with a groan.\u00a0After a while, the only thing that remained on the screen was the last schoolgirl looking around.[#Bay23515 channel.

It was already too late. It was inevitable. Anyway, only two people survived in that carriage. \u300dOnly two survived.\u00a0It meant that everyone died except for two people.\u00a0And I already knew who those two people were.I raised my head and looked blankly at Yoo Sangah.\u00a0Maybe this woman would die.\u00a0Me as well.\u201cDokja-ssi, shouldn\u2019t we stop this?\u201dSomething was starting in the place where Yoo Sangah pointed.\u00a0It was groaning.

Won\u2019t you shut up?\u201dThe young man was a male student who had been leaning against the entrance.He was thin and had dyed white hair. His name was written on the badge attached to his uniform.Kim Namwoon.\u00a0It was a name that I knew.\u300c Only Lee Hyunsung and Kim Namwoon survived in that carriage. It doesn\u2019t matter. They are the only two I need anyway. \u300d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to shut up?\u201dThe agitated Kim Namwoon grabbed the grandmother\u2019s collar.

You have to kill your fellow countrymen to live. It is something only sons of bitches will do. But you know, it is a force beyond our control. Beyond our control. We will die if we don\u2019t kill.

It was a scene where the vague morality was collapsing. Kim Namwoon put a wedge in that crack.\u201cA new world requires new laws.\u201dKim Namwoon. A young man who adapted to the world of Ways of Survival the fastest.Kim Namwoon turned around and resumed punching the grandmother.\u00a0This time, nobody stopped him.

Are you doing to just watch? Do you want to fall behind?\u201dPeople trembled at Kim Namwoon\u2019s words.\u00a0Their facial expressions were as easy to read as the sentences in a cheap novel.\u300cIf there is no killing in five minutes, everyone in this carriage will die. \u300dPeople\u2019s eyes were changing.\u300cIf the grandmother doesn\u2019t die, we will die in five minutes\u2026 \u300dThe most primitive eyes that a living creature could have.\u201cYes\u2026 This bastard is right.

So we can live!\u201d\u201cAh fuck\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201dThe second and third.The people standing aloof from the grandmother.\u00a0The cowardly men who had been lingering.\u00a0The university student filming this with their phone.\u00a0The mother of the child and Han Myungoh.They all lynched the grandmother, aiming for her death.\u201cDie! Die quickly!\u201dThey were like guards cooperating for the death penalty. Like the guards pulling the lever at the same time so they couldn\u2019t tell who killed the prisoner, these people passively kicked and punched the grandmother.And I was watching all of this.\u00a0I was standing by, like someone watching what happened in another world.The grandmother whose name I didn\u2019t know was someone who wasn\u2019t meant to live.\u00a0In the original scenario, the grandmother died.\u00a0So\u2026 It wasn\u2019t a sin to observe that death.At that moment, Yoo Sangah got up.\u201cYou will be killed.\u201d\u00a0I reflexively grabbed her.\u00a0\u201cI told you not to move.\u201dThe arm I was holding was shaking. Yoo Sangah made tight fists in an attempt to hide her trembling.\u201cI know, I know\u2026!\u201d\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi will die if you go now.\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s eyes were shaking with fear.\u00a0Even so\u2026I realized it. Despite the genre of the story changing, some people still shone brightly.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi. Sit down.\u201dHowever, the person who could change this story wasn\u2019t Yoo Sangah.\u00a0Yoo Sangah wasn\u2019t the protagonist of this world.\u201cHuh? But\u2015\u201d\u201cDo as I say, just this once. I won\u2019t interfere after that.\u201dAfter forcibly putting Yoo Sangah back in her seat, I took a deep breath and turned around. I straightened my back and shook as I breathed out. I slowly loosened my ankles and wrist.In fact, it was a little early to come forward. This wasn\u2019t my plan originally.\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi?\u201dI didn\u2019t answer her call as I looked at the people. The people intent on assaulting the grandmother.I wasn\u2019t still because I was afraid or Kim Namwoon and the people, nor did I consent to their inhumanity.I was just waiting.\u00a0It was for the moment I had to move.\u00a0Thus\u2026Kwaang!Right now.\u201cAck! What?\u201dAn explosion filled my ears and the train shook.\u00a0People cried out. Smoke rose from the front right corner of this carriage.\u00a0It had started.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019 had moved.I kicked off from the ground as hard as I could with my right foot. I passed by the people screaming and sitting down towards the grandmother.\u201cWhat? Eeeeok!\u201dKim Namwoon collided with me and fell to the ground with a scream. At first glance, it seemed like I was saving the grandmother, but that wasn\u2019t what I was aiming for.Where was it?\u00a0I looked around quickly.Somebody had fallen towards the grandmother due to the explosion. It was a kid crying in the middle of this hell.\u00a0The kid who was holding the insect collecting net before.\u201cExcuse me a moment.\u201dI took the net from the child.Once I put my hand into the net, the chitin of a grasshopper reached my fingertips. I took one out and placed it in the kid\u2019s hands. Then I turned towards the people.\u201cEverybody stop. You can\u2019t live if you kill the grandmother.\u201dMy voice was surprisingly clear due to the temporary silence after the explosion. One by one, people started looking at me.\u201cLet\u2019s say you kill the grandmother. What next?\u201dTheir surprised faces looked good. Let me tell you a bit more.\u201cThe grandmother\u2019s death will be recognized for what the dokkaebi calls the \u2018first murder\u2019 and some time will be bought. Then what next?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cIf what the dokkaebi says is true, you each have to kill one thing. So who will you kill after the grandmother? Will you kill the person next to you?\u201dThe people who thought about something retreated from each other.\u00a0Horror was in their eyes.\u00a0In fact, everyone knew.\u00a0The grandmother was just the beginning.Kim Namwoon noticed the shaky atmosphere.\u201cHaha, what are you all worried about? Then kill him next! Cowards. Don\u2019t worry about your turn in advance! The odds are equal!\u201dI figured that Kim Namwoon would say something like this. I cut him off with a slight wave of my hand.\u201cThere is no need to gamble like that. There is a way for you to survive, even if you don\u2019t become a killer.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cW-What is it?\u201dThe people became greatly agitated. Kim Namwoon\u2019s expression distorted.\u201cHave you forgotten? The scenario clear condition wasn\u2019t to \u2018kill a person.\u2019\u201dMost people were still puzzled but a few people noticed something.[Kill one or more living things.]That\u2019s right. From the beginning, the word \u2018person\u2019 was never specified in the contents of the scenario.Kill one or more living things.\u00a0In other words, any life was possible.\u00a0A quick-witted person shouted at the collection net in my hand.\u201cInsect! Insects!\u201dThe grasshoppers were jumping in the collection net. People\u2019s eyes were shining. I nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s right, the insects.\u201dI put my hand into the net and took out a grasshopper. It was a chubby one that I saw earlier.\u201cG-Give that to me! Quickly!\u201d\u201cOne only! I just need one!\u201dI stepped back slowly as I looked at the approaching people.\u00a0I was now facing the explosive madness that tried to kill the grandmother.\u00a0Yet a smile emerged.\u00a0Why? Even in this breathtaking tension, why was my heart beating with joy?\u201cWould you like it?\u201dI waved the net like a trainer provoking an animal. Several impatient people leapt towards me.\u201cThen catch them!\u201dI smashed the grasshopper in my hand.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[You have achieved the \u2018First Kill\u2019 achievement!][100 coins have been earned as additional compensation.]At the same time, I threw the net in my other hand as hard as possible.

Couldn\u2019t you have just given them the insects?\u201dLooking back, I saw Kim Namwoon raising his body.\u00a0\u00a0I responded cautiously to Kim Namwoon, who was stretching his neck, \u201cThere are 12 people remaining.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cThere were three insects left in the collecting net.\u201dKim Namwoon frowned for a moment before smiling broadly. \u201c12 to 3?\u00a0Hahahahat!\u00a0Yes.

You just wanted to see this scene, didn\u2019t you?\u201dI recalled the Kim Namwoon that I knew from Ways of Survival.At this moment, I heard a message in my ears,\u00a0[Exclusive skill, \u2018Character List\u2019 is activated.]Next, a window opened in front of my eyes.\u00a0I still didn\u2019t know exactly what my attribute was, but I looked at the window in front of me.[Character Information][Name: Kim Namwoon.Age: 19.Constellation Support: None (Two constellations are currently showing interest in this person).Private Attribute: Chuunibyou (General)Exclusive Skills: Unusual Adaptability Lv. 3, Knife Fighting Lv. 1, Blackening Lv. 1Overall Stats: Stamina Lv. 3, Strength Lv. 4, Agility Lv. 6, Magic Power Lv. 4Overall Rating: A chuunibyou who was blackened by a special occasion.

It wasn\u2019t an ordinary punch.[Blackening Lv.1]A dark aura rose from Kim Namwoon\u2019s whole body. This was the exclusive skill of the \u2018chuunibyou\u2019 attribute.It was rare to release a skill before the end of the first scenario, but Kim Namwoon was already showing a skill.\u00a0There was a reason why the main character had recruited him, despite his psychopath nature.Peeok!After he hit it, my right shoulder spasmed.

No matter what, I absolutely couldn\u2019t send this guy onto the next scenario.\u201cHaha,\u00a0I knew you would move like that.\u201d\u00a0As Kim Namwoon took something out of his bag, I had an ominous feeling.A blade shone in the fluorescent light.

It really hurt.\u00a0There was a searing pain in my skin. My vision shook, and it felt like death was approaching.\u201cHaha,\u00a0now die!\u201dThe time remaining to the end of the scenario was 1 minute and 30 seconds. I glanced toward the grandmother.

The wound was a little deeper than before, but it still didn\u2019t hurt much.\u201cKim Namwoon.\u201dBehind Kim Namwoon, there were people who were still crawling and looking for insects, as well as those who were willing to hurt each other for their own survival.\u201cYou are right.

It made the familiar train noise.Soon, light flooded in, and darkness was lifted from the windows. We had arrived at the surface ground section of Line 3 between Apgujeong and Oksu.Outside the window, the Han River and Seoul were revealed.Ahh.\u00a0Someone let out a moan. It was a moan which contained deep relief that they survived.However, it didn\u2019t take long for the meaning of that moan to change.\u00a0Ah, ah\u2026The landscape outside the window was no longer the Seoul that they knew.\u00a0Smoke and dust rose from the ruined city.The Han River bridges had collapsed.\u00a0The Han River itself was red with the bodies of soldiers, while among the fallen buildings, a monster was trampling on a K1 tank like it was a toy.[Main Scenario #1 \u2013 Proof of Value has ended.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[300 coins have been acquired as a basic clearance reward.][100 coins have been reduced for the channel usage fee.][Additional compensation settlement will begin.]One world was destroyed, and a new world was born.\u2026And I was the only reader who knew the ending of this world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The ruined Seoul and collapsed buildings.\u00a0Monsters reminiscent of a giant snake were eating the wreckage of a fighter jet that had crashed into the Han River.\u201cW-What the hell\u2026!\u201dI recognized their identity at once.\u00a0An ichthyosaur.\u00a0A monster that was commonly called a sea serpent. It would later be classified as a Grade 7 monster in the world of Ways of Survival.One of the ichthyosaurs looked in this direction.\u201cU-Uwaaah! It is coming!\u201dPeople screamed with fright. But I just looked apathetically at the approaching ichthyosaur. These guys couldn\u2019t be a threat.Kurururung!The ichthyosaur circled around the bottom of Dongho Bridge and vanished into an air bubble.In the world of Ways of Survival, \u2018scenarios\u2019 took precedence over anything else.\u00a0As long as we were protected by the scenario, we wouldn\u2019t have to deal with such monsters straight away. At least for now.[Compensation settlement is delayed due to an unexpected scenario check. Please wait.]The compensation settlement should\u2019ve started right now but only an error message floated in the air.It was probably due to me.\u00a0I looked down at Kim Namwoon\u2019s body, which only had the torso remaining.According to the original Ways of Survival, Kim Namwoon killed most of the people in this carriage and moved onto the next scenario.\u00a0But I stopped it.If my thoughts were right, those who would be angry at Kim Namwoon\u2019s death would appear. Here? Not here. They were in the sky above.[Due to the death of character \u2018Kim Namwoon\u2019, two constellations show a faint hostility to you.Constellations.\u00a0They were mysterious beings in Ways of Survival. They sat watching from the distant nebulas and were the masterminds of this tragedy.Once the constellation\u2019s preferences sign appeared, I realized that it was now starting in earnest.It was funny.\u00a0A day ago, our positions were opposite. Now they were the ones watching me.[A handful of constellations admire your scenario.][The constellations have sponsored you 500 coins.]If there were some constellations who disliked me, there would also be some who liked me.\u00a0Either way, it was an uncomfortable situation. However, I couldn\u2019t do anything about them right now.\u00a0It was my turn to be a clown.I picked up Kim Namwoon\u2019s Swiss knife on the ground and thought.\u2018Feel free to watch. You will end up paying the admission fee with your lives.\u2019\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi? Are you okay?\u201dI looked up and saw Yoo Sangah\u2019s face. Her shoulders were sagging. Blood covered her white blouse and there was a run in her stockings. There was no more of the Yoo Sangah I knew. I held Yoo Sangah\u2019s hand and said.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t save the grandmother.\u201dI looked down at the body of the grandmother, missing its head. I didn\u2019t know the name of the grandmother. In the future, many people would die in this manner.Yoo Sangah looked at me with a complicated gaze.\u201cHow is Dokja-ssi so\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cAh, it is nothing. Rather\u2026 Thank you.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThat, I\u2026\u201dI belatedly thought back to the previous scene.\u00a0I had thrown the net in Yoo Sangah\u2019s direction. I knew what she was thinking.\u201cIt was just a coincidence. It won\u2019t happen twice.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah nodded silently.\u00a0She didn\u2019t know the truth but she was smart. She knew what I meant.\u00a0Someone lived because of my choice and someone else died.\u00a0No matter who survived, I didn\u2019t deserve a thank you.[Wow, amazing.]The dokkaebi appeared in the air.[What on earth happened here? I was just watching the other carriages\u2026]There was a mixture of delight and surprise on the dokkaebi\u2019s face.\u00a0Twinkling stars floated over the dokkaebi\u2019s head.I counted the number of stars. One, two, three\u2026 Twenty, twenty one. Twenty one in total. He would be happy.[For 21 people to be connected to my channel\u2026 Haha, isn\u2019t this quite good? Gosh, thank you for your sponsorship. Constellations. Haha, everyone! Did you properly show off your value?]The number of stars meant the number of constellations connected to the channel.21 wasn\u2019t a lot, but it was a strange number for a beginner dokkaebi.[The number of survivors is quite high? The fellow in the next carriage was a nutter as well\u2026 It seems that things are quite interesting today.]The dokkaebi manipulated something in the air. A moment later, a list of survivors came up.[Survivors from the 3434 Train to Bulgwang, Carriage 3807: Kim Dokja, Lee Hyunsung, Yoo Sangah, Han Myungoh and Lee Gilyoung. A total of five survivors.]Five people. More people than I thought survived.\u00a0I looked at the faces of the survivors one by one.Lee Hyunsung had a good physique and excellent motor skills, so it was expected that he would survive. I even expected Yoo Sangah to a certain extent.In addition, Lee Gilyoung.\u00a0If my guess was right, \u2018Lee Gilyoung\u2019 was the name of the boy standing next to me.\u00a0The fluids from the crushed grasshopper was still on the boy\u2019s hands.\u00a0It was the grasshopper I had squeezed.The boy was looking at his mother, who lost her head.\u00a0The boy\u2019s mother had abandoned him to join in on killing the grandmother. The boy had just watched the whole thing from beginning to end.I hesitated for a moment before touching the boy\u2019s shoulder. It wasn\u2019t foolish sympathy.\u00a0To put it simple, this was\u2026That\u2019s right. Hypocrisy.\u201cKid.\u201dThe boy slowly turned his head and in his eyes, I could see the fear of death that he encountered for the first time in his life.Unavoidable instincts.\u00a0This boy wasn\u2019t grieving his mother\u2019s death. He was just afraid of his own death. It was natural. He was human.\u201cDo you want to live?\u201dThe boy\u2019s eyes shook anxiously. His body trembled with a force that couldn\u2019t be resisted. Then little by little, the boy\u2019s head moved.\u201cThen let\u2019s go together.\u201dLee Gilyoung moved slowly and came close to my legs. Yoo Sangah was watching me with an impressed expression. I unintentionally caused another misunderstanding. In fact, it was meant to be seen. But the target wasn\u2019t Yoo Sangah.[A few constellations are impressed with your good deed.][The constellations have sponsored you 200 coins.]I couldn\u2019t help thinking that it was a low move. But I also wanted to live.Given the upcoming major events, it was essential to draw the attention of the constellations right now.\u201cW-Will you release us now? Didn\u2019t you get what you wanted?\u201dHan Myungoh in a torn shirt shouted from half a dozen steps away.\u00a0Department Head Han Myungoh.\u00a0He was a lucky human.But I couldn\u2019t help wondering. Why was Han Myungoh riding the subway when he had so much money?\u00a0This was the man who had shown off a new S class Mercedes-Benz not long ago.[Hrmm, released? Haven\u2019t you seen outside? Do you really want to go out there?]The dokkaebi chuckled.[It is somehow admirable. In fact, I didn\u2019t expect much from this carriage but you managed to pass the first scenario. This proves that bugs deserve to survive.]His words made us realize our position. Maybe we were like grasshoppers in his eyes.[Now now, shouldn\u2019t there be a reward for overcoming the hardships? As a reward for the first scenario, you are entitled to the sponsorship of the \u2018constellations.\u2019 Waahhh! How about it? Aren\u2019t you looking forward to it? Hmm, you are all unenthusiastic. This is really a big deal.]The reaction was natural.\u00a0I was the only one here who knew what \u2018constellation\u2019 or \u2018sponsorship\u2019 was.The sponsorship of the constellations. The meaning was obvious. One of the key events of Ways of Survival, \u2018Sponsor Selection\u2019 was about to begin.[Hmm, everybody has confused expressions. I can easily tell you. Right now, you are incredibly weak. If you are thrown into the scenarios that will take place, you will be killed when you meet a weak ground rat, let alone a \u2018kruk.\u2019 But kindly, there are some great people in the universe who pity you and would like to sponsor you. Do you understand what I am saying?]Lee Hyunsung finally couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and opened his mouth.\u201cWhat are you saying? Who is sponsoring whom\u2026\u201d[Hmm, my words are just entering dirty ears. Isn\u2019t there an old saying in South Korea? It is better to see it once than listen a hundred times. So experience it directly. Well, the less fortunate ones might not get the chance. Hahahat!]I was tense.\u00a0From now on.\u00a0A good choice here would make my survival in the future easier.\u201cDokja-ssi? Two strange choices suddenly appeared in front of me\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know even if you ask me.\u201dThis was naturally a lie to avoid suspicions.\u00a0By the way, there were two choices.\u00a0Yoo Sangah was quite lucky.\u201cDo it comfortably. Think of it as an aptitude test.\u201d\u201cAptitude test\u2026\u201d\u201cNobody knows what the situation is anyway. Why not do it comfortably?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I understand.\u201dYoo Sangah closed her mouth and started staring into space. It was a profound expression, as if she had encountered something curious.The others suddenly became silent. Everyone was reading the options in front of them.\u00a0I also had my own choices to look at.[Sponsor Selection]-Please select your sponsor-Your chosen sponsor will be your strong supporter.There were four choices like a riddle.\u00a0It meant there were four constellations that wanted to turn me into their incarnation.Four choices wasn\u2019t small considering that the protagonist of Ways of Survival received five options the first time.The constellations never revealed their true name.\u00a0Therefore, all contractors must infer the identity of the constellations by words such as \u2018abyssal\u2019, \u2018demonic\u2019 and \u2018garden\u2019.Of course, this puzzle was nothing to me, the sole reader of Ways of Survival.Let\u2019s see.First, the \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon.\u2019According to my memory, this constellation was a powerful entity that led the group of constellations called the Black Cloud.\u00a0I forgot his real name but I remember it was a very long name.The advantage of this constellation was that the contractor could receive a very strong attack power. In the early days when stamina and strength were in urgent need, there was no constellation as strong as the Abyssal Dark Flame Dragon.Of course, that was limited to the beginning.\u00a0As the power of this constellation was more frequently used, the mind became corrupted and the contractor would become a mad murderer.This constellation usually sponsored the people with the \u2018chuuni\u2019 attribute\u2026 I didn\u2019t know why the constellation picked me.\u00a0I felt uncomfortable and excluded this guy.The second one, the Demon-like Judge of Fire.I can\u2019t believe I was actually seeing this option. Somehow, the strong emotions I felt were enormous.At first glance, the name was overflowing with evil. But this was actually a trap for the wicked. The \u2018Demon-like\u2019 actually meant \u2018not a demon.\u2019\u00a0Then the words \u2018fire\u2019 and \u2018judge\u2019 were added.A being who wasn\u2019t a demon and who made judgments through fire.\u00a0Paradoxically, the master of this constellation was an angel.If I recalled corrected, it was Archangel Uriel\u2026 In fact, I remembered this because someone in the novel picked this constellation as a sponsor.It was a pretty decent choice. This was pending.\u00a0The constellations of \u2018absolute good\u2019 imposed ridiculous constraints if you wanted to use their enormous power.The third, Secretive Plotter.\u00a0It was the first time that I, the sole reader of Ways of Survival, had seen this choice.This name might\u2019ve been mentioned in passing but\u2026 I didn\u2019t know it right now. If I could read Ways of Survival more thoroughly then I might get a feel of the constellation.But I was certain that the owner of this constellation wasn\u2019t a very strong entity.\u00a0Apart from the obvious modifier, there wasn\u2019t one \u2018proper noun.\u2019Secretive Plotter, it was too simple for a constellation. This one was also pending.Finally, there was Prisoner of the Golden Headband.My heart jumped the moment I saw the fourth option.\u00a0I didn\u2019t expect this constellation so early.\u00a0I doubted my eyes several times.\u00a0But it was unmistakably \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband.\u2019At first glance, this name gave off a negative image due to the word \u2018prisoner\u2019. But you had to pay attention to \u2018Golden Headband.\u2019Golden Headband.\u00a0The smallest prison in the world.It was a hint that anyone would recognize if they enjoyed reading Journey to the West as a child.\u00a0There was only one prisoner who was held captive by the golden headband in the journey from east to west.The master of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, who lived in suffering due to the shackle on his head. The Handsome Monkey King with the \u2018golden-gaze, fiery-eyes.\u2019The Great Sage the Equal of Heaven, Sun Wukong.Among the characters that appeared in the novel, there was one supported by Sun Wukong.A wondrous power that could sweep through hundreds of incarnations and to kill thoughts with one lightning strike.The author had described this part with a lot of energy so my memory of it was clear.I didn\u2019t know why such a powerful constellation was showing me interest but if I became the incarnation of the Great Sage the Equal of Heaven, I would be able to survive in this new world more easily than anyone else.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBut\u2026I quickly looked at the door connected to the carriage in front.\u00a0Beyond that door, \u2018he\u2019 was looking at the selection screen like me.If I chose The Great Sage the Equal of Heaven\u2026 Could I win against him?[There is one minute left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]Time was running out.\u00a0I breathed lightly and looked through my options.\u00a0My worries didn\u2019t last long.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You won\u2019t be sponsored by any of the Black Cloud constellations for a while.]I wasn\u2019t surprised because it was an expected message.To make every member of his group turn away because he was rejected\u2026it seemed that this guy was Kim Namwoon\u2019s sponsor in the original work. As expected of the incarnation of this constellation.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is disappointed in you.][She will persistently monitor your justice in the future.]In the case of Archangel Uriel, it was just disappointment. In the first place, the constellations of absolute good would rarely hate someone unless they committed a great injustice.[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 is interested in your choice.][200 coins have been sponsored.]The Secretive Plotter\u2019s case was unexpected. Given the characteristics of the name, maybe he valued my caution.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is interested in your choice.]And the Great Sage the Equal of Heaven\u2026I was concerned.\u00a0Did I make the right choice?\u00a0I didn\u2019t know.\u00a0Maybe I had lost the tremendous opportunity right in front of me.[You haven\u2019t selected a sponsor.]But choosing a certain constellation meant being limited by that possibility.\u00a0The sponsor contract was never a fair deal.I would survive.\u00a0But I wouldn\u2019t survive by being their toys.\u00a0And if my expectations were right, there was a way to become strong without a constellation.\u00a0Maybe it was a way to become stronger than the incarnation of the strongest sponsor.[Haha, is this true\u2026isn\u2019t there one interesting choice? Well, yes. There will be another chance.]The dokkaebi\u2019s crescent moon eyes stayed on me for a moment.[Now now, everyone has finished the selection. Rest here for a while. I have to go prepare the next scenario. I\u2019ll see you in 10 minutes!]After the Sponsor Selection finished, the dokkaebi disappeared.\u00a0He told us to rest, but these 10 minutes were really crucial.In 10 minutes, I needed to sort out this situation and prepare for the following scenarios.\u00a0I tried to recall my abilities in my head.[Character List] and [Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint].I didn\u2019t know the precise use yet but I had a general sense of these skills. This will work somehow.\u201cLet\u2019s all gather together.\u201dThe survivors gathered at my words. The first one to reach out a hand was Lee Hyunsung.\u201cHello, I am Lee Hyunsung.\u201d\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you\u2026although I don\u2019t know if these words suit the situation. As I said earlier, I am a soldier\u2026well, I should say that I was a soldier.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t contact your unit?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dThe grip around my hand was considerable. As expected from the tanker that appeared in the early stages of Ways of Survival.I must take Lee Hyunsung with me.\u00a0He might not look like much now but Lee Hyunsung was an increasingly important figure in the latter parts of Ways of Survival.\u201cAh, Dokja-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI wanted to thank you. If it wasn\u2019t for Dokja-ssi, we would all be dead.\u201d\u201cNo, that isn\u2019t the case.\u201d\u201cEven if I had lived, I would\u2019ve have been able to live as a person. Thank you very much. And\u2026I am ashamed.\u201dLee Hyunsung bowed deeply.\u00a0My mind was a bit complicated.\u00a0In fact, Lee Hyunsung would\u2019ve survived even if I didn\u2019t do anything.Then somebody grabbed my shoulder.\u201cHaha, our contractor did one big thing. Dokja-ssi, do you know my name?\u201dI could tell who it was without looking back. I took the hand off my shoulder and said.\u201cI know, Han Myungoh-ssi.\u201d\u201cHuh, Han Myungoh-ssi? Shouldn\u2019t you call me Department Head?\u201dHan Myungoh was still trying to use his position in this situation.\u00a0He really was the king of authoritarianism in Minosoft.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the company.\u201d\u201cHah, look at this. Are you planning to not go work now? Where did you learn your basic etiquette?\u201dOnce I saw Han Myungoh\u2019s angry face, I once again realized that the world I knew was over.The man in front of me was a \u2018predator\u2019 of the world before the scenario began.\u00a0And I was merely a prey to the predator. It was certainly like that.\u201cNo matter how I think about it, your actions were too much. Yes? If you had the insects then you should\u2019ve tipped me off. Why would you throw them like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi, you have to be good to me. How much time do you have left on your contract?\u201dAll of a sudden, it became ridiculous.\u00a0In the world I had lived in, I was too weak.\u201cHan Myungoh-ssi.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d\u201cW-What?\u201d\u201cYou still don\u2019t understand the situation? Weren\u2019t you hit by that bastard earlier? Minosoft? Do you think the company still exists when the end has come?\u201dHan Myungoh\u2019s face was white and stricken.I turned my eyes towards the other people. Since I was already saying it, I should make it stick.\u201cHan Myungoh-ssi isn\u2019t the only problem. Everyone, you need to wake up. As the dokkaebi said, this isn\u2019t a joke.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI think you should\u2019ve all roughly noticed the situation. Exclusive skills in the attributes window. A game-like interface. Is there anyone who still hasn\u2019t caught onto facts?\u201dIndeed, no one raised their hand. South Korea was easy. Due to the high penetration rate of smartphones, there wasn\u2019t one person who hadn\u2019t played a RPG game.Even if they didn\u2019t play a game, they would\u2019ve read a fantasy novel at least once.Lee Hyunsung sighed.This is like a novel I was reading while standing on duty, but I still can\u2019t feel it. This really isn\u2019t a dream?\u201d\u201cThis is reality.\u201dMy stern answer caused Lee Hyunsung\u2019s eyes to slightly change.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 feels a faint trust in you.[Your understanding of the character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has increased.]Lee Hyunsung nodded.\u201cIt is good that you are certain. Then what do we do now? Dokja-ssi, do you have an opinion?\u201d\u201cWe have to go.\u201dI answered without hesitation.\u201cG-Go? Are you insane?\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi, I don\u2019t think\u2026\u201dThis time, Yoo Sangah joined it.\u00a0It seemed everyone still hadn\u2019t woken up.\u201cThen how long we will stay here?\u201dIn fact, my argument didn\u2019t make much sense. Outside was a heaven of monsters.\u00a0But I knew. Right now, we have to get out of here.\u201cHave you thought about your parents? Do you think your parents are safe in this mess?\u201d\u201cT-The line has been dead for some time. No Kakaotalk\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah cried out desperately.Indeed, Confucianism was still strong in South Korea. Even Lee Hyunsung and Han Myungoh\u2019s expressions darkened at the word \u2018parents.\u2019I grasped Lee Gilyoung\u2019s shoulder, whose head was bowed. The first person to get up was Yoo Sangah.\u201cGo. I will go out.\u201d\u201cN-No! Didn\u2019t you hear what that thing said? Take a break here! If we move then our heads might explode!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s take a majority vote.\u201dYoo Sangah raised her hand first, followed by me and Lee Gilyoung. But it was up to there.\u201c\u2026I have to go to my base but it seems dangerous to move in this situation. There was also the warning.\u201d\u201cShit, you all go by yourselves! I\u2019m not going! I\u2019m not going outside!\u201dI didn\u2019t care about Han Myungoh but the problem was Lee Hyunsung. I had to take Lee Hyunsung with me no matter what\u2026Kuuong!The thick iron plate made a loud sound. The iron door to carriage 3707 was slightly distorted.\u201cW-What?\u201dHan Myungoh\u2019s cry was ignored as the iron door made a deafening sound again.Kuuong!Someone was trying to break the door from beyond it. This was an unexpected situation so I had to think.Was it the next scenario?\u00a0No. The dokkaebi hadn\u2019t come back yet.\u00a0Then\u2026My brain moved quickly.\u00a0Small hairs stood up and a short shiver struck my body.\u00a0That guy.\u201cW-What? Everybody stop it!\u201dHan Myungoh shouted and moved towards the door. Lee Hyunsung moved towards it as well but I stopped him.\u201cYou can\u2019t stop it.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWe have to go.\u201dI looked at the iron door with heavy eyes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHuh?

Which one will you choose?\u201d\u201cU-Uh\u2026\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi, is there any guarantee that the person beyond the iron door is an enemy?\u201dThe Steel Sword appeared at the crucial moment. There was a reason why Lee Hyunsung couldn\u2019t be leader of a party.\u201cSince they are coming from another carriage, it is likely to be a survivor. If we meet\u2026\u201dI looked at the bloody room instead of continuing. Lee Hyunsung followed my gaze and quietly spoke.\u201c\u2026I was too careless. Let\u2019s find a way out.\u201d\u201cG-Go! Go quickly!\u201dAt this moment, both people were aware. The other survivors of the carriages would\u2019ve gone through the same thing as them. They wouldn\u2019t have the good luck of finding \u2018insects.\u2019\u201cThis is broken!\u201d\u201cDamn, we can\u2019t go this way!\u201dWhile listening to Lee Hyunsung and Han Myungoh\u2019s cries, I also checked the doors. There were no more barriers so the doors could now be touched.Apart from the doors connecting the passageways, there were a total of eight access doors on the subway. There were three exits that hadn\u2019t been confirmed yet.Kung!The iron door seemed like it could barely hold on for one minute.Despite being the main character, I didn\u2019t think he would have such high strength in the beginning. I was honestly surprised that he could break such a thick iron door.\u201cDokja-ssi! Here\u2015\u201dI found a working manual switchgear.\u201cNo!\u201dThe opening and closing device worked smoothly but the door didn\u2019t open at once. They door opened around one fifth before stopping like it was jammed.\u201c\u2026It seems to be broken here as well.\u201d\u201cHow about other places?\u201d\u201cThis seems to be the only place where we can escape.\u201dIt was unknown for a child. But the gap was too narrow for men and women to escape. Han Myungoh and Lee Hyunsung tried to pull the doors open but they didn\u2019t move a bit.[Coins Possessed: 4700 C]One of the uses of the coins was to raise overall stats. I had already used 2,700 coins to make my stamina level 10.This problem could be resolved if I used the remaining coins to enhance my strength. But it wasn\u2019t wise to use the coins when the situation was unknown.In the end, there was only one way.\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi. Use a skill.\u201d\u201cHuh? \u201cSkill\u2026\u201dI quietly activated Character List.[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.][Character Information]Name: Lee HyunsungAge: 28 years old.Constellation Sponsor: Master of Steel.Private Attribute: Soldier who Turned a Blind Eye to Injustice (General)Exclusive Skills: Bayonet Skills Lv. 2, Camouflage Lv. 2, Patience Lv. 2.Stigma: Great Mountain Push Lv. 1Overall Stats: Stamina Lv. 8, Strength Lv. 8, Agility Lv. 7, Magic Power Lv. 5.Overall Evaluation: The overall stats are very good. Despite turning away from injustice, he received the choice of a constellation. This is another opportunity for him.Lee Hyunsung\u2019s information came to my mind without any restrictions. Fortunately, the sponsor was the same as what I read in Ways of Survival.\u201cYou should\u2019ve checked it when you opened the attributes window. Lee Hyunsung is a soldier so there must be a skill you can use in this situation.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026I have one but how do I use it\u2015\u201d\u201cJust think about using the skill.\u201d\u201c\u2026Will that work?\u201d\u201cIt will. I did it earlier.\u201dLee Hyunsung didn\u2019t say anything else as he took a deep breath of determination.\u201cHaaap!\u201dLee Hyunsung\u2019s biceps swelled as he grabbed the door. It was the appearance of Great Mountain Push.In fact, Great Mountain Push wasn\u2019t a skill but a \u2018stigma.\u2019 And a stigma was a power from the constellation. I used the word \u2018skill\u2019 in order to avoid suspicions.Dudududu.There was a sound like a huge spring turning and the door started to move.\u201cWhat? This guy has real strength!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it! It is really great!\u201d[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has started to trust you.][Your understanding of the character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has increased.]Rather than doubts, my reliability had risen. Lee Hyunsung was a simpler person than I thought.\u201cCome on, get off!\u201dBut I felt relieved. I handed Lee Gilyoung to Lee Hyunsung.\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi. Carry the child on your back.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dNow the iron door was almost broken. But if my prediction was right, the problem right now wasn\u2019t that iron door.[\u2026Ah, this is really. I knew this would happen. Didn\u2019t I saw it earlier? I told you not to go anywhere, Damn! The scenario isn\u2019t ready yet-]The dokkaebi seemed to be angry as it floated over Dongho Bridge.\u201cWahh! I knew this would happen! I told you not to come out!\u201dHan Myungoh wrapped a hand around his head, like he thought it would explode. But there was no need to worry.[Sigh\u2026it can\u2019t be helped. You are really lucky humans.]It was because the second scenario started the moment the train door was opened.[The second scenario has arrived!]+[Second Scenario \u2013 Escape]Category: SubDifficulty: EClear Conditions: Cross the broken bridge and enter Oksu Station.Time Limit: 20 minutes.Compensation: 200 coins.Failure: ???+\u201cDokja-ssi, something is strange.

The bridge hadn\u2019t been broken yet. In other words, the \u2018bridge was going to be broken.\u2019\u201cDokja-ssi, come quickly!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201dIt hadn\u2019t been broken yet because we got off the train \u2018too soon.\u2019 The dokkaebi said the preparation time was 10 minutes. But we escaped three minutes earlier.Some people might call it cowardly but this scenario couldn\u2019t be cleared without such a shortcut. Especially if I was stuck with burdens such as Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung.\u201cPant, pant. Indeed, Lee Hyunsung-ssi is a soldier and has high stamina.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t open your mouth. You will lose strength.\u201dLee Hyunsung was running first with the kid. He was a natural monster who didn\u2019t invest any coins in his stats, yet the sum of his strength, stamina and agility exceeded 23.The next one was Han Myungoh and then Yoo Sangah with me in the rear. It would be close but I thought we could make it in time.\u201cAh, what is that?\u201dAt this time, Han Myungoh\u2019s scream was heard. There was a huge whirlpool in the centre of Han River, letting out splashes of water.And a giant monster was at the centre of the splashes. An ichthyosaur. The problem was that the ichthyosaur seemed to be twice the size of the one I saw through the window.This wasn\u2019t a sea serpent\u2026it was a sea commander.A general sea serpent was only a grade 7 monster. Given that a grade 9 monstrous land rate was difficult for normal humans to cope with, an average human would be torn apart by a grade 7 monster.In other words, the guy coming now wasn\u2019t a monster that could be caught in the early stages. Of course, there was no need to catch it. It wasn\u2019t created to be caught.Ku ku ku ku!The Han River surged like there was a tsunami and the ichthyosaur moved. It was chewing on the legs of the bridge.\u201cThe bridge is breaking!\u201d\u201cRun! If we run then we can cross it!\u201dThe remaining distance was around 200 metres. If my calculations were correct, we could cross before the bridge collapsed at our current speed.[There is no fun if the game is too easy.]Of course, this was a story for when there were no variables.[The scenario difficulty has been adjusted.][Scenario difficulty: E -> D]The sound of the dokkaebi\u2019s laughter was heard.[Is there any fun if you just run away? Let\u2019s create a bit of atmosphere!][The evil thoughts of the dead have returned.][The surrounding earth is filled with black ether.][The demonic people have woken up!]There was the sound of something chasing us from behind. Yoo Sangah muttered to herself.\u201cZ-Zombies?\u201dZombie-like bodies were coming in huge waves. Some of them were people from the same carriage as us.\u201cWe just need to go a little further! Quickly!\u201dThe distance to the ichthyosaur was now less than a hundred metres. Fortunately, Lee Hyunsung carried Lee Gilyoung and had crossed the safety line. The problem was the rest of us, including me. Han Myungoh shrieked.\u201cY-You bastards!\u201dThere were too many demonic people. If there were only corpses from the subway, we might\u2019ve gotten away. The problem was\u2026\u201cKuweeeoooh!\u201dThe drivers who died on the bridge became demonic people. The path that Lee Hyunsung broke through was covered with demonic people. I looked between the demonic people on the road and the approaching ichthyosaur.\u201c\u2026Everybody get down.\u201dIt was too late.Kwaaaaang!The legs of the bridge shook tremendously as the ichthyosaur\u2019s huge mouth bit it.The scales of the ichthyosaur shone through the dust that poured down onto Han River like rain. A fishy smell of blood and water filled the area.I staggered and raised my body.Once the dust went away, the scenery around me was clear. Piles of shattered concrete and cut steel. The carcasses of the demonic people which the ichthyosaur had cleanly bitten through.The broken leg of the bridge.\u201c\u2026Dok\u2026sii\u2026kay?\u201dYoo Sangah and Han Myungoh raised their bodies from a little further away.One of Han Myungoh\u2019s legs seemed injured and uncomfortable from the previous quake.Lee Hyunsung and Lee Gilyoung cried out from across the bridge but their voices seemed blocked by the safety zone.What should I do? I made plans on the basis of the bridge breaking. But I hadn\u2019t expected Han Myungoh and Yoo Sangah to be with me.At that moment, a voice was heard in the air.[Someone has received the favour of a constellation.][The constellation\u2019s scenario \u2018Deus Ex Machina\u2019 has been activated.]Along with the voice, a brilliant bridge made of light was created among the remnants of the broken Dongho Bridge. Then a message floated in front of me.+[Deus Ex Machina \u2013 Even Bridge]Description: A bridge of light made by a constellation. Only an \u2018even\u2019 number of people can cross the bridge.

This, in my head, suddenly\u2015\u201dI met the eyes of Yoo Sangah, who was talking nonsense. I could roughly guess the situation.Deus Ex Machina. Constellations risked a huge loss by intervening in scenarios.\u201c\u2026It is Yoo Sangah-ssi\u2019s sponsor.\u201dI didn\u2019t know what constellation it was but somebody had chosen Yoo Sangah as their incarnation and wanted her to live.Deus Ex Machine was a rare phenomenon in Ways of Survival. And Yoo Sangah was a person who should\u2019ve already died.I had a moment of doubt. What type of constellation was behind Yoo Sangah?[The information of this person can\u2019t be read in \u2018Character List.\u2019][This person isn\u2019t registered in \u2018Character List.\u2019]I was a bit surprised.I couldn\u2019t see her with my skill? Why? Did she have a special background? Or did she have a mental barrier? But if she had something like that from the beginning\u2026no, wait a minute. Perhaps this was\u2026\u201cDokja-ssi, what do we do now?\u201dI heard Yoo Sangah\u2019s bewildered voice. I didn\u2019t have much time to think.Ku ku ku ku!The Han River was swirling. The ichthyosaur had eaten one bridge leg and was turning its huge body around on the other side of Han River. I bit my lips and once again read the explanation of the bridge.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOnly an \u2018even\u2019 number of people could cross the bridge.In the end, \u2018Deus Ex Machina\u2019 was a toy made by the damn constellations who loved tragedies.There was no way for everyone to survive.Han Myungoh\u2019s body was shaking as his eyes met mine.In the end, somebody must die.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Behind you!\u201dI reflexively leaned forward as a bloody fist came flying through the air. It was a familiar fist covered with energy.I felt something falling towards me and instinctively kicked out. I didn\u2019t need to look back to know what was behind me.A grade 9 human type, demonic person. Human mutants infected with black ether.That\u2019s why demonic people were classified as a high-risk species, despite being grade 9. Demonic people made from a normal human base were no different from zombies, but it was particularly dangerous if their hosts were different.I saw the badge of the school student with a damaged head.\u201c\u2026Kim Namwoon.\u201dThe guy whose head burst a few minutes ago was now aiming for me as a demonic person.Kim Namwoon\u2019s vocal cords that burst out were in a bizarre shape.\u201cKuweeeoooh.\u201d[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint Lv. 1 has been activated!][This person doesn\u2019t have any consciousness. The skill Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint will be cancelled.]Damn, it was as expected.Chwaack!My thigh was scratched by Kim Namwoon\u2019s overgrown black fingernails.A pain that felt like a burn spread through my leg. The skin which hadn\u2019t been cut by a knife was now torn by fingernails.This was the main reason why demonic people were dangerous. The demonic people became several times stronger than when they were human.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, immediately\u2015\u201dI felt something as I spoke. Without looking back, I could see what was going on.\u201cLet me go! Let go! Dokja-ssi! Dokja-ssi!\u201dHan Myungoh, who had just been limping, was carrying Yoo Sangah over one shoulder and moving across the bridge at an astonishing rate.[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 admires how easy you are to fool.][The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is impressed with your sacrifice.][100 coins have been sponsored.]\u2026Indeed. Planning to leave me?By the way, the way he was running was a little strange. Despite being on one leg, he was running as fast as an Olympic athlete.This couldn\u2019t be the exclusive skill of Han Myungoh, who had a big belly. Therefore, it must be the stigma of his sponsor.[The One-legged Swift Horse]And I already knew the constellation who provided that stigma. I used Character List on the distant Han Myungoh.[The information of this person can\u2019t be read in \u2018Character List.\u2019]Once again, Character List didn\u2019t work properly.If I remembered correctly, the stigma of \u2018One-legged Swift Horse\u2019 came from the constellation Lame Trickster.Lame Trickster didn\u2019t give any stigmas in the mental barrier system. In addition, Han Myungoh couldn\u2019t possess such a skill from the beginning. In other words, my skill failed not because of Han Myungoh\u2019s ability.\u2026I was stupid.I looked at the message window floating in front of me and laughed.[This person isn\u2019t registered in \u2018Character List.\u2019]I was thinking too hard when it meant literally that. Character List literally read the information of characters.Yoo Sangah and Han Myungoh were characters who didn\u2019t originally appear in Ways of Destruction. They were people who would\u2019ve died if I hadn\u2019t saved them. It was natural that I couldn\u2019t confirm their information with Character List.\u201cGruk! Gruk! Gruk!\u201dOn one side, the incoming Kim Namwoon and demonic people were jabbering nonsense at me. On the other side, Han Myungoh had already halfway crossed the bridge. Lee Hyunsung and Lee Gilyoung had already entered the safety zone across the bridge so I couldn\u2019t ask for help from them.This was truly a predicament. I couldn\u2019t cross the bridge alone.My brain moved quickly.Should I capture one of the demonic people and cross the bridge? It was worth trying, but the success rate was too low. Unlike the name, the demonic people were categorized as non-human, meaning they didn\u2019t count as a person.\u201cKuaaaack!\u201dSeveral demonic people lost their balance and fell down the bridge.Kwajijijik!The fallen demonic people became the food of the ichthyosaurs. Like piranhas, the ichthyosaurs broke the demonic people into dozens of pieces in an instant.Distant fear came flooding back in. If the number of people on the bridge became \u2018odd\u2019 for even a moment, I would be like them. It was impossible to cross alone.Then?\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s take it slow.\u201dI muttered as I attempted to control myself. Right now, I needed to remain calm. There were still a few usable methods, but the important thing was to handle matters in front of me. I controlled my breathing and walked to the demonic people.\u201cKuweeok?\u201dFortunately, it wasn\u2019t difficult to make the fall down the bridge using inertia.Kyaaaack \u2013 kwajijik!I reduced the numbers by making them fall steadily. The dokkaebi\u2019s stopwatch floating in the air was blinking.The time remaining before the scenario ended was 15 minutes.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dNails flew from a blind spot and pierced my shoulder bone. No matter how calm my mind, no matter how much information I knew, I couldn\u2019t help my untrained body.\u201cKuwoooook!\u201dThe wild Kim Namwoon\u2019s attacks were becoming increasingly faster.Left shoulder.The right thigh.The top of the head.I had to break the flow. I barely avoided the flying fingernails and kicked his legs.\u201cKyah?\u201dBut this person lost all senses and wasn\u2019t hurt at all. I stepped back, hitting a broken steel frame. I could hear the raging sound of the ichthyosaurs at the bottom of the pillars.[A few constellations are rejoicing in your adversity.][The constellations have sponsored you 200 coins.]It was a steady accumulation of coins. Now I held 5,000 coins. It was a significant number of coins for the beginning.[Wow, you are quite good at surviving. Now now! Will any constellations help this poor friend?]It was the dokkaebi\u2019s merchant-like voice. I wanted to tear it apart.[Geez, there is really nobody?]Of course.It would be strange for a constellation to support me after what happened during the Sponsor Selection.[What did I say? You should\u2019ve chosen well when you had the change. How pitiful.]Kim Namwoon attacked me again and again, resulting in damage to my waist.Of course, I also injured Kim Namwoon\u2019s left side with the knife. Thanks to that, his stomach was hanging out like a skipping rope.In order to kill a demonic person, I had to completely destroy the heart. But the skin of a demonic person was hardest near the heart. The Swiss knife wasn\u2019t able to pierce it with sharpness alone.Dammit, it wouldn\u2019t be so hard if I had just one combat skill.[The exclusive skill \u2018Bookmark\u2019 is activated.]\u2026Bookmark?[\u2018Character Bookmarks\u2019 is activated.][Available Bookmark Slots: 3][Bringing up the list of available bookmarks.][People Listed in the Bookmark Slots]Bookmark.

But from the beginning, I had no intention of taking care of them alone.It was a little late. He should appear around now.Kwajik!\u00a0Kwajijijik!There was a crackling sound like he had been waiting. I knew it. I thought he would do reckless things in order to gain achievements and donations.Kwajijik!\u00a0Crunch.It was obviously the sound of a person\u2019s flesh colliding with another body, but it sounded more like a mace crushing flesh.In fact, I had collected this much coins and thought it would be worth challenging the protagonist.But now I realized how mistaken I was.From the stationary train, the demonic people were thrown away in a straight line, as if a tank had rushed through. Was this really a scene caused by a \u2018human\u2019?\u201cKyaack?\u201dThe headless demonic people realized that something was strange and started turning around. However, it was too late.Kwajijik!The man destroyed all the demonic people threatening me and appeared in front of me. An overwhelming force without any weapons. He beat the demonic people with only two fists.I had prepared my mind in advance but sweat still flowed down my back.Dealing with this guy? It was absolutely impossible. I couldn\u2019t win even if my overall stats rose by more than double what they were now.\u201cYou, who are you?\u201dThe man\u2019s cool gaze turned to me.

A large adult man was being grabbed by the neck and hanging like a monkey.I could see Lee Hyunsung looking this way from across the bridge. His expression was anxious but he couldn\u2019t actually see what was going on here. It was due to the safety ward. I could see over there but they couldn\u2019t see here.\u201cName.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat is your name?\u201dLook at this indifferent way of talking, just like a main character.

Indeed, natural born monsters were different.\u201cStop the unnecessary answer. Only answer what I ask from now on. Understood?\u201dI didn\u2019t answer. I thought maybe this might happen. However, this was the worst situation that I desperately hoped would never happen.In the beginning, Yoo Jonghyuk was more intimidating than any other figure.His personality had worn out after going through regression three times.

I told the story using as much concise, short and accurate vocabulary as possible.It was from the first moment the \u2018dokkaebi\u2019 appeared in the subway to the end of the first scenario. Of course, I excluded the skills I got and any important issues.\u201c\u2026You cleared the scenario by killing insects?\u201d\u201cWe were lucky.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk was so surprised he seemed to have forgotten that his mouth was open.\u300c The future has completely changed. \u300dHe was shocked. Originally, the people in carriage 3807 would kill each other in a battle royale, with only Lee Hyunsung and Kim Namwoon surviving.\u201cYou have keen eyes. How did you know there were insects in the carriage?\u201dKilling Intent filled Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes as thoughts brushed through my head.\u300c Is this guy also a regressor? \u300d\u300cIf so, I have to kill him right now. \u300dA person who commits a fault thinks that everyone speaks of it.I wasn\u2019t surprised that he misunderstood me. I quickly opened my mouth.\u201cAn explosion.\u201d\u201cExplosion?\u201d\u201cI was able to find an insect due to an explosion from the carriage in front.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk\u2019s body stopped at these words.\u201cExplain it in a simpler manner.\u201d\u201cWhen the explosion occurred, a kid fell and dropped his insect collecting net. I picked it up by chance.\u201d\u201c\u2026It is a suspicious coincidence.\u201d\u201cCoincidences are always suspicious. If you don\u2019t believe me, ask the people beyond the ward. The boy standing there dropped the net.\u201dBeyond the safety barrier on the way to Oksu Station, people were looking over at this side. The scenario wasn\u2019t over yet so they couldn\u2019t approach or talk to us.Yoo Jonghyuk looked over but showed no signs of moving. His eyes changed and memories that seemed to belong to Yoo Jonghyuk crossed my mind.\u300c I see. \u300d\u300c Explosion. \u300d\u300cThis guy isn\u2019t a regressor. \u300d\u300cHe isn\u2019t the one who changed the future. Rather, the future changed\u2026\u300d\u300c Because of me. \u300dI saw people dying painfully in a powerful explosion and Yoo Jonghyuk blankly watching it.\u300c It is because I started killing them, unlike the other turns. \u300dDue to the impact of Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint, I could feel Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s mental pain and suffering.\u201cAre your questions over?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cThen can you let me go? And let\u2019s go to Oksu together. There isn\u2019t much time remaining to clear the scenario.\u201d\u2018It is difficult.\u201dHowever, a protagonist was a protagonist for a reason.\u201cEverything you said makes perfect sense.\u201dI have never seen a protagonist as careful as Yoo Jonghyuk.\u300c A beginner can\u2019t be so calm. \u300d\u300cHe is abnormally well-adjusted to this changed world. \u300d\u300cHe probably killed Kim Namwoon. \u300d\u300c He has gone beyond being useful to being dangerous. \u300dYoo Jonghyuk\u2019s right eye started shining with a gold colour.

In Ways of Survival, it was the only attribute that could see the future and had the passive of \u2018nullifying all detection skills.\u2019 In fact, only one person had the attribute of \u2018prophet\u2019 in the world of Ways of Survival.\u300c Only a prophet can defend against my Sage\u2019s Eyes. \u300dI didn\u2019t answer and Yoo Jonghyuk bit his lips.\u201cCan you perhaps use \u2018Future Sight\u2019?\u201d\u201cIt is something similar.\u201d\u201cYou knew I would come here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u300c I see. If this man is a prophet, all his actions are convincing. \u300dThe flow was changing. Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s fluctuation was conveyed straight away.

Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut that knowledge is never perfect.\u201dThe only weakness of a regressor.It meant that the future changed when they used their information of the future.

I can fill in the parts you are missing.\u201dThere was no companion as good as a \u2018prophet\u2019 to the present Yoo Jonghyuk. In fact, my present self could play a role similar to a prophet. It was because I was the only reader of this story.[There is one minute to the end of the scenario.]Yoo Jonghyuk bowed his head and started to think.\u300c A prophet will certainly be helpful. \u300d[There are 50 seconds left to complete the scenario.]\u300cNot just the 46th scenario, but later when fighting the \u2018chalatustra.\u2019 But\u2026 can I really believe him? \u300d[There are 40 seconds left to the end of the scenario.]\u300c Companion. \u300dFinally, Yoo Jonghyuk raised his head as I stared at the clock with an irritated heart.\u201cI have decided. I will make you my companion.\u201d[Excessive immersion has severely worn out your mental strength.][Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint has been turned off.]I wasn\u2019t sure if it was due to fatigue or relief but the exclusive skill was released. Now Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s face was as difficult as a philosophy book with no commentary written.Yoo Jonghyuk started to take me across the \u2018Even Bridge.\u2019 Of course, I was still held by the collar but\u2026I thought things would be all right now. I persuaded this damn regressor and was in a good position.We had almost crossed the Even Bridge and were right in front of the safe area when Yoo Jonghyuk suddenly stopped.\u201cI will ask you one last thing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you are really a prophet, you should know your future. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dThe moment I saw Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s serene eyes, goosebumps broke out. His test wasn\u2019t over yet. The grip holding my collar tightened.\u201cKeok.\u201dHis hand raised me up a little bit and a gentle wind passed by my feet. Underneath me was completely empty.The smell of blood mixed in with the smell of Han River as the ichthyosaurs jumped towards their prey with open mouths.\u201cWill I let go of this hand or won\u2019t I?\u201dFor the first time, I started sweating. Let me think. Even without his thoughts, I knew this guy more than anyone else. I closed my eyes and thought about Yoo Jonghyuk.[There are 20 seconds left to the end of the scenario.]Then I came to a conclusion.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk.\u201dI was certain about what he would do. No matter how I thought about it, there was no other ending when it came to Yoo Jonghyuk.I talked as I watched a sea commander approaching in the water.\u201cI will tell you two things first.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cOne, I\u2019m not your subordinate. So I hope you will treat me fairly from now on.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cTwo, I will cooperate with you but you also have to promise to cooperate with me.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk looked at me with interest and nodded.\u201cWell, what is your answer?\u201dI replied with a smile.\u201cGet your hand off me and get lost, you damn jerk.\u201dThen the power holding me disappeared. I was grabbed by the force of gravity. I saw Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s face as I was falling. Yoo Jonghyuk was smiling brightly like something made him happy.Son of a bitch.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI believe you. You are definitely a prophet.\u201dWaiting for me at my crash point was the mouth of the giant sea commander.I closed my eyes from the shock of the impact along with the cold water of Han River. As I sucked in a breath, a warm and enormous darkness swallowed me up.[You have failed to clear the scenario.]\u2026Damn, I have to use that method after all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then I was sucked in somewhere. I wasn\u2019t torn apart because I fell with perfect timing. However, I couldn\u2019t lose consciousness here.I had to stay awake. I needed to wait for a while.I somehow managed to curl up and hold my breath. 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds\u2026I was barely breathing when my hands hit a tangible wall in the darkness.\u201cU-Uwek.\u201dI could barely breathe after coughing up the river water several times. My level 10 stamina saved me from being killed by hitting the water surface, but the large and small bruises all over my body were very painful.I controlled my breathing in order to not fall into a panic and turned on my smartphone.I was worried it might\u2019ve broken in the fall but the power was fortunately okay. It was good that I spent big and bought a smartphone with a waterproof function.Pahat.The flashlight turned on and the surrounding scenery entered my eyes. There were huge walls with concrete by-products floating by. The stomach of an ichthyosaur was more disgusting than I thought.\u201cDammit.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk\u2019s expression as he let go of his hand without hesitation and got off the bridge was vivid. I expected it but it was more shocking than I thought.\u2026If I wanted to be his companion, I had to survive.It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t understand.Companion. The weight of this word was too great for Yoo Jonghyuk. Since his failure in the first round of regression, Yoo Jonghyuk had never made a real \u2018companion.\u2019It was rare for humans to easily follow the growth of a regressor. As a result, he solved everything alone, was revered as a savior and was naturally lonely.To Yoo Jonghyuk, \u2018humans\u2019 were only subordinates or enemies.Thus, this was a test. If I wanted to be in a equal position with him, I had to solve this much alone.\u2026Well, this was when looking at it from Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s viewpoint.\u201cA companion like you\u2026crazy psychopath.\u201dI barely doggy paddled to a floating styrofoam panel and raised my body onto it. Thanks to the warmth of the stomach, I wasn\u2019t cold. However, the problem was from now on.I closed my eyes and played the message log that I heard.[You have failed to clear the scenario.][Paid settlement will begin.][100 coins have been reduced for the channel usage fee.][The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 has nodded at your exciting remarks.][100 coins have been sponsored.][The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 nods are your coice.][100 coins have been sponsored.][The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 is disappointed in your rash remarks.]There were quite a few messages. In addition, a few exposed constellations sponsored me. Maybe it was due to the final conversation between Yoo Jonghyuk and I.I felt a little down as I read through the messages of the constellations one by one and collected the coins. If I had picked one of these constellations in the first Sponsor Selection, this might not have happened.But there was no regret in my choice.After encountering Yoo Jonghyuk directly, I was certain.The Great Sage the Equal of Heaven might be a sponsor of the highest quality but he wasn\u2019t enough. I needed more than just \u2018sponsorship\u2019 if I wanted to confront Yoo Jonghyuk.And I would gain it from here.The walls of the stomach growled and small waves rose inside. The sea commander seemed to be moving somewhere. I turned on my smartphone and calculated the time.According to Ways of Survival, the ichthyosaur started to secret stomach acid around three hours after ingesting food.In other words, I didn\u2019t have much time left.[Haha, it is sad that things turned out like this. It was very interesting.]There was a sound effect before the dokkaebi\u2019s voice was heard.\u201c\u2026Dokkaebi?\u201d[Yes, that\u2019s right. You don\u2019t seem panicked at all?]\u201cI knew you would come.\u201d[Hrmm. It sounds like you were waiting for me?]\u201cOf course I have been waiting.\u201dLight turned on and the dokkaebi appeared. I couldn\u2019t tell for sure from his expression alone, but this guy was clearly interested.I deliberately spoke calmly. If I was pushed here, I wouldn\u2019t be able to eat my meal.\u201cAre you doing to take coins from me?\u201d[\u2026Coins?]\u201cYou have to take coins in exchange for me failing the scenario.\u201d[Hmm, not your life?]\u201cIf it was my life, you would have written \u2018death\u2019 in the failure results column, not three question marks. Doesn\u2019t this mean there is room to negotiation?\u201d[\u2026Hahaha. How interesting.]In fact, there was a loophole in my words. The scenario message was \u2018Failure: ???\u2019. This literally meant that the penalty of failure was unknown. It was just my assumption that it was in exchange for coins. Nevertheless, there was a reason why I was so certain.\u201cAm I wrong?\u201dIt was because I already knew about this scenario. The dokkaebi hesitated for a moment before nodding.[You are right. Amazing. That you could determine this point with such a clue\u2026 as expected from someone who is attraction the constellations\u2019 attention.]The dokkaebi\u2019s tone was filled with sincere admiration.[As you said, you can survive this sub scenario if you pay coins, even if you fail.]\u201cHow much?\u201d[Pay 5,100 coins. Then I will let you live.]I looked at how many coins I currently posessed.[Coins Possessed: 5,100 C]I couldn\u2019t help smiling. This jerk was messing around right now.\u201cThat is too much.\u201d[Haha, then won\u2019t you die? It is up to me to accept the coins or not. If you do something wrong then I can just end it here.]\u201cThen kill me.\u201d[\u2026Huh?]\u201cKill me.\u201d[\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.]\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me?\u201dThe dokkaebi didn\u2019t move. It was natural. He was having a lot of fun with me right now. Furthermore, he wouldn\u2019t have come down here to see me if he had been planning to kill me. For this guy, I had to survive here or I at least had to die miserably.[Haha. You are really making me angry. Look, now\u2026]The dokkaebi\u2019s flat-shaped eyebrows wriggled furiously. It was time to stop the taunts and get to the main point.\u201cLow-grade dokkaebi, Bihyung. How are the activities of a streamer?\u201dIf there was a crack in the face, it would look exactly like this. Dokkaebi Bihyung showed confusion for the first time.[H-How do you know my name?]\u201cYou haven\u2019t been enjoying broadcasting lately, right? The constellations are too stingy.\u201d[W-Who the hell are you? How does a human\u2026]Bihyung\u2019s horns shook. It was natural. An ordinary human couldn\u2019t know about the Star Stream system. But I wasn\u2019t an ordinary human.[A few constellations have doubts about your existence.][The constellation Secretive Plotter\u2019s eyes are shining at your plan.]From now on, it wasn\u2019t a story for the constellations.I mouthed to Bihyung, \u201cHow about we talk after you close the channel?\u201dBihyung was worried and closed the channel.[#BI-7623 channel is closed.]Once the constellations left the channel, Bihyung showed his true colours.[Feel free to speak. You, how can an ordinary human know about the Star Stream broadcasting?]\u201cThat isn\u2019t important.\u201d[Huh?]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBihyung, do you want to be \u2018king of the dokkaebis\u2019?\u201d[What now\u2015]\u201cDon\u2019t you wish to be the best streamer in the network, surpassing Dokgak and Gildal?\u201dBihyung\u2019s complexion was changing.\u201cDokkaebi Bihyung, sign a contract with me.

The actors were humans like me. And the storyteller that connected the two sides was the dokkaebi in front of me.[Ha, hahahahat! You are crazy! A crazy human! I should\u2019ve known it when you refused to sponsoring of the other constellations!]Bihyung laughed for a long time before opening his mouth again.[I don\u2019t know how you know about Star Stream Broadcasting but I can\u2019t accept the offer. I\u2019m a dokkaebi, not a constellation. I can\u2019t be your sponsor.]\u201cYou seem to have misunderstood. I never told you to sponsor me.\u201d[Huh?]\u201cI am well aware that you are a weak dokkaebi. I don\u2019t need your strength. I need your channel.\u201d[My channel?]\u201cSince you can\u2019t seem to understand me, is there a problem with your Korean language patch?\u201d[No, what is this?]\u201cI will explain it simply. I want to sign an exclusive contract with your channel.\u201dBihyung made a blank expression before belatedly regained his spirit.[Wait a minute. Do you want to make a \u2018stream contract\u2019 with me now?]\u201cYes.\u201dA stream contract was originally a contract between dokkaebi and constellations.The constellation\u2019s incarnation would appear on a particular channel and the dokkaebi would receive a portion of the coins earned by the incarnation of the constellation as a commission.Originally, the person who was the incarnation couldn\u2019t intervene in this contract. It was called sponsorship but the contracted incarnation was nothing but a slave.[Hahat, this is a hit.]Bihyung laughed behind small fingers. The surrounding atmosphere was changing.[I don\u2019t know how you know about such things but some human dares to mention the stream contract? It is also a trivial buy with no sponsor?]The tone changed and the surrounding air was filled with killing intent. Indeed, even a low level dokkaebi was strong compared to humans. But it wasn\u2019t enough to make me back off.\u201cIt is worth signing a contract because I have no sponsor.\u201d[\u2026What?]\u201cWhat do you think the purpose of a constellation is to enter a channel?\u201dBihyung looked like a bad student at the sudden question. From now on, it was a special lecture time for the low level dokkaebi.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so nervous. You already know this information. But let\u2019s review it again to see what it means.\u201dBihyung was caught in my pace and nodded despite himself.\u201cThe Star Stream subscribers can be largely divided into two groups. One group are the \u2018fun seekers\u2019 who seek to relieve their boredom with the channel. The other group are the \u2018incarnation searchers\u2019 who want to find an incarnation to contract with them. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d[Yes. That\u2019s right.]\u201cFor this reason, you must be able to satisfy one of the two groups in order to become a famous channel in Star Stream. In other words, either stick to the fun seekers or the incarnation seekers. You have to attract one of them properly.\u201d[You are moderately well informed. But so what? What does this contract have to do with why constellations subscribe?]\u201cI don\u2019t know how many more hints I have to give you. This is why your subscribers number still isn\u2019t over three digits.\u201d[\u2026Shut up. Say it quickly.]Seeing Bihyung thrust his small horns at me cutely, it was hard to believe the dokkaebi had blown up people\u2019s head a while ago. Now let\u2019s stop making fun of him and take a chance.\u201cWhat if there is a channel that can satisfy both the fun seekers and the incarnation searchers?\u201d[What are you saying? Such a thing is impossible. Even if it is possible, it is only for a while.]Bihyung\u2019s words were correct.The reason why it was impossible to satisfy all the constellations was due to the characteristics of the \u2018incarnation searchers\u2019 group.The purpose of these constellations was to \u2018discover an incarnation.\u2019 They changed channels as soon as the Sponsor Selection was over. Due to this, the incarnation searchers group were just temporary customers. But.\u201cThat is a story for when the Sponsor Selection proceeds normally.\u201d[What?]\u201cWhat if there is an incarnation who doesn\u2019t sign a contract with any constellation? And what if that incarnation shows an ability that transcends all over incarnations with sponsors?\u201dThe existence of a strong incarnation would attract the eyes of the constellations. If this incarnation continued to not select a sponsor, the \u2018incarnation searchers\u2019 group would continue to subscribe without leaving the channel.[W-Wait a minute! You, is this why you didn\u2019t select a sponsor\u2026.?]\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d[Ha\u2026this is interesting.]Bihyung grinned at me.[Becoming the strongest incarnation without a sponsor\u2026 if there is such a thing, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be a dream to become the best Star Stream channel. But such an incarnation can\u2019t exist.]\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d[\u2026I admit that you aren\u2019t normal. You have attracted the attention of constellations from the beginning and thanks to it, I have also been having fun. However, there is a limit to your delusions. Haven\u2019t you noticed it after going through that? An ordinary human can never beat an incarnation. That is the law of the world.]\u201cI don\u2019t know that.\u201d[You have already missed the opportunity. Look around you. This isn\u2019t a main scenario. You failed a sub scenario and now your life is at risk. There are no constellations watching you\u2015]\u201cReally?\u201d[\u2026\u2026?]\u201cBy now, the constellations must be in an uproar. Aren\u2019t they? Isn\u2019t everybody clamoring for the channel to quickly be opened?\u201dBihyung was silent.\u201cAren\u2019t they all going crazy with curiosity right now? Who is that crazy person who went against the regressor? Is he really a prophet? Can he really see the future? If he can see the future, what did he get eaten by the ichthyosaur?\u201d[S-Stop! You are\u2026]\u201cFrom now on, I\u2019m going to show it. So shut up and do what I tell you. Do you want to become the king of dokkaebis?\u201dBihyung\u2019s gaze towards me was changing. I could hear the sound of him gulping.Bihyung was worrying. In any case, there was nothing to lose if he believed me here. Then? Bihyung\u2019s pupils moved quickly.[Then let\u2019s settle the scenario failure first. Give me 5,100 coins\u2026]\u201cWhat are you saying? I didn\u2019t fail.\u201d[\u2026Eh?]\u201cMaybe by now I would\u2019ve met the conditions\u2026\u201dI loosened my body and got up from my seat. My cold body was stiff. Bihyung still had a stupid expression on his face.\u201cOpen the channel. It will start soon.\u201d[Start, what will\u2015]Then a message was heard in the air.[The hidden scenario has arrived!]+[Hidden Scenario \u2013 Commander Slayer]Category: HiddenDifficulty: A+Clear Conditions: Kill the ichthyosaur \u2018sea commander\u2019 and escape from its stomach.Time Limit: 10 daysCompensation: 9,000 coinsFailure: Death+\u201cLook, didn\u2019t I tell you to be prepared?\u201dThere were three types of scenarios in Ways of Survival. The main scenario was in charge of progressing the main story. The sub scenarios were responsible for minor events. And the hidden scenarios were only opened through special conditions.[How on earth\u2026?]Bihyung\u2019s lips were shaking with shock.Unlike the main scenarios and sub scenarios that a dokkaebi was in charge of, the hidden scenarios were characterized by their automatic appearance when certain conditions were met.\u201cYou didn\u2019t even know. You low grade dokkaebi.\u201d[You\u2026what on earth?]\u201cAnyway, if I can clear this, I will prove that I have the ability for the contract, right?\u201dBihyung watched the scenario screen with gloomy eyes. He looked at me with a careful gaze and asked.[This scenario, the difficulty is A+. Do you really believe you can clear it?]\u201cYes.\u201dThere was a small wave as the Han River water crashed against the wall of the ichthyosaur\u2019s stomach. Bihyung was silent for a moment before opening his mouth.[\u2026Okay. If you succeed in clearing this scenario then I will accept the contract.]\u201cThe terms of the contract will be negotiated after the scenario is cleared.\u201d[So arrogant\u2026then I will open the channel again. Please try hard.]\u201cAh, wait a minute.\u201dIt would be difficult if he left already. I had something to check.\u201cYou have something left to do.\u201d[\u2026What is it now?]Bihyung\u2019s mocking tone was somewhat annoying.\u201cFix a system error for me.\u201d[System error?]\u201cMy attributes window isn\u2019t opening.\u201d[No way. The system can\u2019t have an error. The scenario system is perfect.]\u201cTake a look yourself.\u201dBihyung looked at me with suspicious eyes and started to mutter something.[The dokkaebi \u2018Bihyung\u2019 has used \u2018System Interference\u2019 on you.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSystem interference.It was an absolute interference skill that could only be used by dokkaebis with the right to interfere in the scenario.In fact, it was unclear if the reason why I couldn\u2019t see the attributes window was an error or not. But at least the dokkaebi would be able to find out something. And if he couldn\u2019t figure it out, that was also a profit for me.[The exclusive skill, \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 is activated!]In the next moment, sparks flew in the air and struck Bihyung.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What if I do this?]\u201cYou can\u2019t do it.\u201d[Kuaaack!]Bihyung screamed like he had received an electric shock. The white fluffy hair on his skin was burnt black.[T-This! This!]\u201cIt\u2019s okay. If you can\u2019t do it then stop. I will ask for another favour.\u201d[This can\u2019t be! I am Dokkaebi Bihyung.

There was no time to delay like this.\u201cThe dokkaebi bag.\u201dBihyung stopped his useless action of digging at the air.[What?]\u201cOpen the dokkaebi bag.\u201d[\u2026How do you know about that?]\u201cAre you going to open it?\u201d[Only an incarnation with a sponsor can use the dokkaebi bag\u2026]\u201cIt is true that all incarnations that use the dokkaebi bag have a sponsor.

All of the advertisements in the Dokkaebi Bag were aimed at the constellations raising incarnations. It was natural. The original customers of the Dokkaebi Bag were constellations.I got rid of the pop-up advertising windows one by one.It was nothing compared to the \u2018disasters\u2019 that emerged after the fifth main scenario, but a sea commander ichthyosaur was no different from a disaster for the early stage incarnations.I needed some items sold in the Dokkaebi Bag to defeat the ichthyosaur.

I didn\u2019t turn it off on purpose.]There was a total of 20 stars above Bihyung\u2019s head. Since not too many of them had left the channel, it seems that quite a few constellations wanted to see what happened to me. Of course, not all the constellations were friendly.[A few constellations are questioning the fairness of the broadcast!][A few constellations are suspicious of the privileges you have received!]It wasn\u2019t unexpected. While the broadcast was off, a hidden scenario started and the Dokkaebi Bag was opened. It was no wonder that the constellations were surprised.[No, preferences? Look at this, Constellations.

Don\u2019t you know that the storyteller vow is never light?]\u201cWill you help me?\u201d[\u2026There is a product search button in the lower right corner.\u201cThank you.\u201dI ignored Bihyung and pressed the magnifying glass icon at the bottom of the package window.[The product search function is activated.][The produce search is limited to 5 times a day. Any additional searches will cost 100 coins per search.]In any case, humans and dokkaebi were the same. The total number of free searches given was five. Two searches were enough to buy the materials I needed so I had three searches left.[The constellation Secretive Plotter is wondering about your plan.]Yes, be curious. If you are curious, keep watching.[The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 is looking angrily at your actions.]Don\u2019t watch if you are going to get all twisted up.I opened my mouth to use the search function.\u201cSearch for the \u2018Ancient Dragon\u2019 item.\u201d[There are three search results.]A small pop-up window soon emerged.* Ancient Dragon\u2019s Heart \u2013 Stock* Ancient Dragon\u2019s Bone \u2013 Stock: 1* Ancient Dragon\u2019s Horn \u2013 Stock: 1I chose the Ancient Dragon\u2019s Heart.[Item Information]Name: Ancient Dragon\u2019s HeartRating: SSDescription: A heart containing the magic power of the ancient dragon \u2018Ignitus.\u2019 It possesses near-infinite magic power and the attribute \u2018Hellfire\u2019 will be acquired if a heart transplant is successful.Price: 1,500,000 CStock: Just sold out.As expected, it was out of stock. From beyond the catalog, Bihyung, who was dealing with the constellations, looked at me with his jaw dropped.[Crazy. How do you know the information about the ancient dragon?]\u201cI just called out a nice name.\u201d[\u2026It seems like a lie.]I shrugged.In the original Ways of Survival, the owner of the Ancient Dragon\u2019s Heart was already determined. If I remember correctly, the owner of the heart was currently in Italy.A person with good luck. They got such a diamond sponsor. I called out several more product names.[The related product search is completed.]* Great Demon\u2019s Eyes \u2013 Stock: 0* White Pure Star Energy \u2013 Stock: 1The Great Demon\u2019s Eyes was sold out\u2026 the hands of the constellations were really quick. Well, I couldn\u2019t buy it since the selling price was 1 million coins.At any rate, it was good to have a sponsor. Now the incarnation with the Great Demon\u2019s Eyes would grow and destroy the beginner scenarios.[What are you really? What type of cheat are you using? How do you know about items that can only be found in the search?]\u201cI just said plausible names.\u201dAmong the three items that I searched for, only the White Pure Star Energy was in stock. Furthermore, the price was 10,000 coins so I couldn\u2019t buy it now. I put it in the shopping cart for now.[What, are you buying it?]\u201cNot right now. I am just window shopping.\u201d[Sheesh, what a waste of time.]\u201cI am going to buy something else so bring up the items I call out from now on.\u201dI called out several item names. After a moment, a list of items emerged in front of me.* Mucus of the Hammer Sea Horse \u2013 Stock: 124* Stone Hog\u2019s Pointed Thorn \u2013 Stock: 17I compared it to the list in my memories. The food of the ichthyosaur, the hammer sea horse and the stone hog, the nemesis of sea species\u2026 There was no doubt. This combination was the best when it came to attacking an ichthyosaur.\u201cFour mucus, four thorns. It is 800 coins?\u201d[Yes but\u2026where are you going to use these miscellaneous items?]\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201d[\u2026I don\u2019t want to be nosy but why don\u2019t you buy something else? For example, this Woryeong Sword Technique. It is originally 8,000 coins but I will now sell it for 4,000 coins. Wouldn\u2019t buying this be more helpful to clear the scenario?]\u201cThank you but I will just buy this.\u201dBihyung wasn\u2019t satisfied but received the payment.[800 coins have been consumed.]In the darkness, a sparkling powder gathered and four elongated thorns and four pockets of black mucus appeared.[I can\u2019t give a refund if you regret it now. Do you understand?]\u201cI know.\u201dI briefly nodded and started working. I took off my top, tied it around my waist and stuck the thorns in the gap, while the pockets were hung from my waist.The stone hog\u2019s thorn was stumpy but became sharp at the end. It was approximately one metre in length. It was a reasonable size to pierce something.[Hrmm\u2026then I\u2019ll be going. I can\u2019t stay with you. There is something fun going on in another place.]\u201cDo it.\u201d[Huhu, then hang in there. I hope the story will bless you.]Bihyung disappeared in a flash of light and the surroundings became dark again. I could use the light on my smartphone but I wanted to save the battery as much as possible.In the darkness, the stone hog thorn was emitting a bluish light. It was a feeble light but for the moment, it would be sufficient.I pulled out a thorn and swung it. Maybe it was because I didn\u2019t have a skill such as Weapons Training or Incarnation of All Soldiers. I couldn\u2019t get used to holding the thorn.[A few constellations are bored.]The impatient constellations left the channel. I couldn\u2019t see it but Bihyung was probably fretting right now.Then an hour passed.Right, left, up and down.I didn\u2019t like it but I no longer had a problem handling the thorn. The surface finish was rough and didn\u2019t seem like it would slip easily from the hand.It was time to begin. I used the proper force and stabbed at the ichthyosaur wall above me.Tiing!It was like poking a rubber elastic wall as the thorn bounced off. My current strength wasn\u2019t high enough to tear at the stomach of the ichthyosaur. It would probably be the same if I used a skill.Ku ku ku ku!At that moment, the small holes at the top of the stomach wall opened simultaneously. Then an absolutely disgusting liquid poured out.\u201cKuweek!\u201dOne of the demonic people floating on something in the stomach started shrieking.Chuchuchu.\u00a0The skin of the demonic person started burning. The digestion of the ichthyosaur had begun. The ichthyosaur\u2019s digestive juices quickly mixed in the river water and started to melt away at the concrete and other floating products.Chu chu chu chu!There was no time. It was going as planned.I jumped from the floating object and gripped a bump on the wall of the stomach. Then I started climbing up the wall like I was rock climbing.Gurgle gurgle gurgle.The outlet of the digestive juices was right above. I put the thorn in my mouth and grabbed a pocket of mucus.The mucus of the hammer sea horse. I poured the mysterious dark blue liquid onto my hand and applied the mucus carefully from the tip to the end of the thorn.It was with precision and care, as if applying shaving cream to an area to be shaved. If the shaving cream protected the skin from the razor, the mucus protected the thorn from the digestive juices.Go. I swung the thorn towards where the digestive juices were coming from. The angle was correct and I used my maximum strength.Kwaang!The digestive juices flowed down the thorn and dissolved the skin on my forearm. I experienced a terrible pain but didn\u2019t stop. If I made a mistake here then everything was over.[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 has relieved some of the pain.]Gurgle, gurgle.\u00a0Chururuk\u2026Before long, the thorn jammed up the emission point.\u201cJust one.\u201dAfter a deep sigh, I pulled out another thorn from my waist. I applied the mucus of the hammer sea horse, found another opening and blocked it.[A few constellations admire your calmness.][The constellations have sponsored you 200 coins.]I used this method to block three opening points. There were some left, but the small openings didn\u2019t release large amounts of digestive fluids.There was one thorn left in the top tightly tied around me. All that was left was one thorn and two pockets of mucus.I used the remaining mucus on my skin and clothes, then poured what was remaining down my throat.\u201cKup.\u201dThe fishy taste on my tongue was sickening but it was better than dying. The bitterness was nothing compared to the disaster that would occur from now on.It was around five minutes afterwards that the entire stomach started trembling.\u2026It had started.Kieeeeeeek-!The ichthyosaur let out a painful scream. The blood vessels on the wall of the stomach were squirming. The thorns were visibly expanding into the blood vessels.The thorns in the openings had started their aggressive growth activity. The stone hog\u2019s thorn grew in response to the body fluids of seawater species.Gududuk, gududuk.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe thorn that became immune to the digestive juices due to the applied mucus absorbed the surrounding fluids and started to take root in the body of the ichthyosaur.The stone hog\u2019s thorns wouldn\u2019t stop expanding until the ichthyosaur was completely dead.Keeeeeeh!As I watched the liquid swirling under my feet, I grabbed the thorn tightly. I did everything I could. From now on, it was a mental fight.Either I died or this guy would die. Only one of us would survive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My breathing was often interrupted and all my muscles were so stiff that I could barely move them.[A few constellations admire your will to survive!][The constellations have sponsored you 100 coins.]But I persisted. I persisted because I believed I could hold on. The light emitted from the thorn in the darkness confirmed that I was alive. After confirming the falling temperature of the stomach wall, I was convinced that he was dying.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 admires your spirit.][The constellation has sponsored you 100 coins.]When I was hungry, I placed my tongue to the end of the thorn.The condensed fluid that flowed out contained the life force absorbed from the ichthyosaur. The reason I drank the mucus in advance was to absorb this concentrate.[Your stamina has slightly increased due to absorbing the power of the ichthyosaur.]There wasn\u2019t an immediate effect of my stats level increasing, but by the time I escaped from the ichthyosaur, I would gain at least two levels in stamina.It wouldn\u2019t work at a higher level, but this was one of the few tricks I could use to raise my stamina without using coins.\u2026Indeed, this wasn\u2019t a dream.This was all I could do. I was just an ordinary reader. I wasn\u2019t a protagonist. It felt like I would wake up screaming in bed at any moment, but no such miracle happened no matter how much I blinked.\u2026Mother would be fine. She was okay. This wasn\u2019t anybody else, it was \u2018Mother.\u2019I fell asleep whenever the liquid on the floor drained away and woke up every time the cold river water entered my mouth.Finally, the ichthyosaur\u2019s digestion stopped. The warmth of the viscera suddenly cooled down and the elastic stomach lining gradually solidified. Thus, I could be sure.He died.[\u2026You are really great.]A bright light in the darkness. Bihyung\u2019s dim figure was floating in the air.[Using the stone hog\u2019s thorn like this. I never even thought about it. Constellations, isn\u2019t it the same for you?]Bihyung looked at the stone hog\u2019s thorn emitting a faint light.[The stone hog is a guy who mainly lives on the coast and feeds on small sea species. They insert the thorn into the skin of the prey but I didn\u2019t think it would be used to plug up the openings for the digestive juices\u2026]Bihyung\u2019s shining eyes weren\u2019t looking at me. The words weren\u2019t an explanation for me either.[A few constellations are smiling as if they already know.][The constellations have sponsored you 100 coins.][A few constellations belatedly understand your judgment.][The constellations complain that you should tell them by talking to yourself from now on.]I ignored the messages from the constellations and drank the last of the condensed fluid.[Your stamina has slightly increased due to absorbing the power of the ichthyosaur.][Your stamina level has risen!][Stamina Lv. 11 -> Stamina Lv. 12]I accomplished my intended purpose. Bihyung came down to me and looked at my burnt arm.[Furthermore, the mucus\u2026I didn\u2019t know the mucus of the hammer sea horse was so potent.]Originally, my skin should\u2019ve melted from the ichthyosaur\u2019s digestive juices. I opened my mouth to stop Bihyung\u2019s nonsense.\u201cThe mucus of the hammer sea horse is immune to digestive fluids. They evolved in this way after often being eaten by the ichthyosaurs.\u201d[A few constellations admire your knowledge.]Then Bihyung looked at me with a betrayed expression.[Excuse me, I should be the one explaining\u2026]\u201cI did it because you don\u2019t know. Now is the explanation over?\u201d[\u2026Yes.]\u201cThen give me the reward.\u201d[Cheeky bastard.]Bihyung grumbled while at the same time, a reward message appeared in front of my eyes.[The hidden scenario has ended.][You have obtained 9,000 coins in compensation.][You are the first to have successfully hunted a grade 7 species.][You have earned 1,000 coins as an achievement reward.9,000 coins plus an additional 1,000 coins. It was a very huge income.[Coins Possessed: 14,800 C]If I added the 500 donated coins from filming my survival, the total income was 10,500 coins.\u00a0 It was over my target.[Haha, Constellations. Did you see it well? Let\u2019s quickly watch an advertisement before going straight to the next scenario!]I could hear the faint sounds of an ad somewhere.New scenario opening featured package, 8,800 coins\u2026Once the eyes of the constellations disappeared, Bihyung started speaking to me in a friendly manner.[Sigh\u2026it was a great survival. The response from the constellations was amazing.]\u201cHow much time passed?\u201d[Four days. I was in suspense the whole time I was watching. Were you unaware of the time?]\u201cMy smartphone died.\u201dIt took more time than I thought. The original goal was two days\u2026 Well, Yoo Jonghyuk took four days in the fourth round to catch this so the speed wasn\u2019t slow.Anyway, I did it.A pleasant feeling of fulfilment covered my whole body and made me confident. I was an ordinary person with ordinary skills. But even so, this didn\u2019t mean I could only do ordinary things.\u201c\u2026How funny.\u201dIt was strange. A novel that hadn\u2019t been helpful for 28 years was now making me extraordinary.[Oh, you are already talking to yourself?]\u201c\u2026\u201d[Isn\u2019t it good? For an incarnation, talking to yourself is essential. Of course, there are constellations who dislike it but usually\u2026]\u201cShut up and open the Dokkaebi Bag.\u201d[Why? Are you going to buy something?]\u201cI\u2019m not buying but selling.\u201d[Damn, I\u2019ll have to cut the ad short. Constellations, hold on a second. I\u2019ll adjust the volume.]As Bihyung opened the Dokkaebi Bag, I looked at the thorns embedded in the wall.The upper barrier was hardened and deep cracks formed around the thorns. I could now smash through the upper barrier with my strength.I broke the wall little by little with the one remaining thorn. Shortly afterwards, I encountered the core of the ichthyosaur that was glowing blue.[Ichthyosaur\u2019s Core]It was an ether core found in monster species grade 7 or higher. I could raise my magic power level without coins if I ingested them. It was good quality because it was a sea commander grade ichthyosaur.I carefully cut at the flesh around the core while Bihyung looked at me with a dumbfounded expression.\u201cI\u2019ll sell this.\u201d[You really\u2026]\u201cOf course, I don\u2019t mean to sell it to you. I\u2019ll put it on the dokkaebi auction.\u201dBihyung accepted it like he was tired of asking me anything.[Sigh\u2026do what you want. How much are you going to charge?]\u201cI won\u2019t sell it for coins. I\u2019ll sell it by barter.\u201d[Damn, you know all sorts of things.]Bihyung grumbled while uploaded the item to the dokkaebi auction. His desires were simple. This guy might listen better than I thought.\u201cSomeone will show up to buy it. And the item exchanged must be \u2018Broken Faith.\u2019\u201d[Broken Faith? There is a person with it\u2026in any case, it is registered.]\u201cYes. And I will buy this\u2026\u201dI saw White Pure Star Energy in the shopping cart. Indeed, nobody bought it yet. Most constellations weren\u2019t well aware of the value of coin items. The expensive items in the Dokkaebi Bag weren\u2019t unconditionally good.[Wait a minute, can I talk to you for a moment?]At Bihyung\u2019s words, the advertising volume increased again.[The constellations are complaining about the long advertisement.]Once I saw that one more advertisement had appeared, I had a hunch about what Bihyung wanted to say.\u201cIs it the contract?\u201dAdvertising was the only way to hide the eyes and ears of the constellations without turning off the broadcast. From now on, it wasn\u2019t a story for the constellations.[Yes. I wasn\u2019t certain but I became convinced after this scenario. Well\u2026let\u2019s try it once. I can help you a little bit.]\u201cWon\u2019t this violate the streamer\u2019s pledge?\u201d[Ah, of course, I can\u2019t really help you. I\u2019m just saying that. Will you sign the contract?]\u201cWhat are the conditions?\u201d[Take a look.]The dokkaebi pulled out an extravagant contract that had been prepared.I read the contract that emerged as a transparent window in the air.\u2014\u2013[Stream Contract Agreement]\u2014\u2013\u201c\u2026 I am the gap?\u201d[Haha, don\u2019t humans like this? It doesn\u2019t mean anything. Keep reading.]\u2014\u2013\u2014\u2013This was also as expected.\u2014\u2013\u2014\u2013I read the contract carefully to the last item. I thought he might play an unknown joke but I didn\u2019t see that part.Except for one thing.\u201cThere is the most important part.\u201d[What do you mean? You can just say that you agree. The stream contract is a soul pledge\u2015]\u201cI\u2019m talking about the pay ratio.\u201d[A-Ahh. Haha. Right.]As if this bastard didn\u2019t know.This was the most important part.\u201cHow about 5:5? Instead, I\u2019ll get rid of my channel fee. Ah, do you know how to calculate it? I will accurately divide your future donations in this ratio. For example, if you get 100 coins, you will receive 50 coins and I will receive 50 coins.]All stream contracts were like this. The constellations had incarnations appear on the dokkaebi\u2019s channel and the contributions received from other constellations would be divided by a percentage. This was normal.\u201cAre you taking me for a pushover? I won\u2019t accept.\u201d[What? B-But this is the industry\u2019s default settlement ratio\u2026]\u201cI\u2019m an incarnation without a sponsor. When donating to an incarnation without a sponsor, the constellations must pay a huge fee to the dokkaebi. Haven\u2019t you already enjoyed a lot thanks to me?\u201dBihyung\u2019s jaw slowly dropped open. But there was no point making that expression.\u201c10:0. You will only get the commission. I won\u2019t pay you a single penny.\u201d[What?! That is ridiculous\u2026h-how about 7:3?]The ratio changed greatly. But I wasn\u2019t going to concede.\u201c10:0.\u201d[What is this fucking bullshit? It is a ridiculous rate\u2015]\u201cThen don\u2019t accept. I will just go to another channel. \u2018Gildal\u2019 is doing well these days. I should ask him.\u201d[\u20268:2. I can\u2019t concede anymore.]\u201c10:0.\u201d[\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.]Bihyung\u2019s expression changed to a threatening one. He looked at my head like it would explode at any minute. But I knew. He would never give up the contract. My existence was his last chance.\u201cThe advertisement is coming to an end. Don\u2019t you see the constellations complaining?\u201dIn the end, Bihyung gave up.[Shit, I understand. Then will you sign the contract?]He surrendered easier than I thought. In fact, I was going to give up at 9:1.\u2026Maybe he earned more money than I expected. It was a bit disgusting.\u201cYes. And one more thing.\u201d[What? What now?]\u201cYou have to give a separate down payment. Give me 5,000 coins.\u201dBihyung\u2019s expression tightened.[Y-You really\u2026]I laughed. Why was a \u2018gap\u2019 a \u2018gap and why did humans dwell on it\u2026I would let that damn dokkaebi know.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[The stream contract is concluded.][You have received 5,000 coins as a down payment.]The advertisement finished and the constellations came back.

It was a sight that anyone would admire, but not Yoo Jonghyuk.\u300c It is starting. \u300dThe meteor shower was the precursor to the third main scenario starting. Now Seoul would be destroyed one by one according to the scenario.Yoo Jonghyuk looked up at the sky before bowing his head and looking at the Han River.The landscape around Dongho Bridge was quite desolate since the large group of ichthyosaurs had recently moved downstream.\u300c It was too much. \u300dIt had already been three days since Kim Dokja entered Han River. It might\u2019ve been too much to demand that he catch the ichthyosaur at the first level.\u300cIndeed, it would be hard for me to catch an ichthyosaur in three days. \u300dBut it would be impossible to take him if he couldn\u2019t do this much. If he couldn\u2019t even do this much, it would only hinder Yoo Jonghyuk.\u300c A prophet isn\u2019t a big deal. \u300dYoo Jonghyuk closed his eyes with disappointment. He would go on his own again. Without any companions.It wasn\u2019t a big deal.

I was still inside the ichthyosaur. I turned my head and saw the surprised Bihyung.\u201c\u2026I had a dream.\u201d[Ohu, are you trying to raise curiosity? It isn\u2019t bad?]I didn\u2019t mean to do such a thing but I didn\u2019t mind the misunderstanding.[A few constellations want you to move to a new place quickly.]I used 500 coins to buy the Ellain Forest\u2019s Vital Force to help me sleep. I thought it was too dangerous to move while exhausted.The Ellain Forest\u2019s Vital Force quickly recovered fatigue and wounds in exchange for two hours of sleep. In other words, it was an expensive item.\u201c\u2026I really want to go out.\u201dI talked to myself while stretching my body. The dream I just had was still clear. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a dream.Kwajijijik!I heard the sound of an electric current scattering and Bihyung disappeared without a word. Maybe he went to do his job.I sighed with relief.The stream contract with the dokkaebi. It was a gamble that I never would\u2019ve attempted if I hadn\u2019t known about Bihyung from Ways of Survival. But I did it with surprising calm. I never succeeded in any contracts in \u2018real life.\u2019[The exclusive skill, \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 is in use.]\u2026This was real. I inserted strength to my right hand holding the thorn. I really thought this world was reality.[A few constellations want you to act.]Well, there was no time to worry about it. I swung the thorn as hard as I could at the stomach wall that lost its elasticity. At the same time, there was the sound of something collapsed and water pouring out. I plunged into Han River.\u201cPuah!\u201dFortunately, I didn\u2019t see any other ichthyosaurs. Small seawater species approached with curiosity but no hostility was felt. Not all creatures would attack humans.Dongho Bridge was over there.I used a piece of the ichthyosaur corpse as a floatation device and made my way towards dry land.My skin was cold from the cold water but I couldn\u2019t worry about it. After 30 minutes of swimming, my hand reached land.[A few constellations are nervous looking at you.]Normally, danger would immediately come after this message popped up.[The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 is making an insidious smile.]It was a pity for the constellations but something bad wouldn\u2019t happen to me. It was because I already knew the dangers.[You have entered the region of the second main scenario.][The land in the scenario area is deeply polluted.][Be careful about your breathing and move underground as quickly as possible.]The message said this but in fact, I shouldn\u2019t be on the ground from the moment this scenario started.Why? Look at my skin now.[You have been exposed to poisonous fog.]The skin touched by the violet fog turned black.Kyahh!Once I followed the source of the fog with my eyes, I saw a monster making terrible cries.It was a massive monster over 30 metres big. This fog was the fart of the grade 7 monster, \u2018great poisonous rhinoceros.\u2019 The rhino snorted and confronted a monster in the fog, which seemed to be an insect king species based on the shadow.Kuaaaah\u2026The struggle in this new world wasn\u2019t just for humans. The monsters were also fighting for their homes.I moved while holding my breath as much as possible.They were grade 7 monsters like the ichthyosaur but I couldn\u2019t do with them right now. In the first place, I could kill the sea commander because I was prepared.[You have used the Ellain Monkey\u2019s Lungs.]The monkey\u2019s lungs was an item I bought in advance that could be used as a substitute for an air purifier for 20 minutes.[A few constellations admire your readiness!]The aboveground station, Oksu Station had already bee destroyed. The nearest underground station from here was \u2018Gumho Station.\u2019 Maybe the others had moved there.I moved quickly while avoided the small species that were eating the corpses. I only had 20 minutes, so I needed to move as quickly as possible while securing supplies.The first thing I needed was clothes. My outerwear was melted by the ichthyosaur\u2019s fluids so it was necessary. Of course, there were many of them all around but\u2026 I felt uncomfortable.\u2026It couldn\u2019t be helped. I searched some bodies and grabbed clothes that roughly fit. Then I headed to a nearby convenience store.I grabbed a few plastic bags and swept in food randomly. Food would be a valuable trading item after going underground.I filled three or four bags like this. It seemed that the colour of the monkey\u2019s lungs was becoming increasingly darker. There wasn\u2019t much time left.Then I heard someone\u2019s voice.\u201cHelp\u2026help me.\u201dThere was someone still alive? A young woman was lying down in a corner. The poisoning was progressing on the surface of the skin, but the toxic condition wasn\u2019t severe due to the mask she was wearing. Her jacket was half removed and a bit of her skirt was torn.\u201cAre you okay? Can you stand?\u201d\u201cUhhhh\u2026\u201dWas there such an extra in Ways of Survival? I wanted to take a closer look but I didn\u2019t have enough time. I picked up the woman and ran to Gumho Station.I turned and a side street appeared. Now the distance to Gumho Station was 100 metres in a straight line. I breathed in and started to run with all my strength. I could see the Exit 3 sign in the distance.\u2026.Closed. Then on the other side?There was a fire shutter down at every exit due to the disaster situation. I could break the shutter with his thorn but if I did it wrong, the people inside might be damaged.\u201cE-Exit 4\u2026\u201dUnexpectedly, the woman I was carrying was helpful. I ran towards Exit 4. Then I found a fire shutter that was rolling down. I placed the thorn in the gap of the shutter that was trying to close. Somebody yelled out.\u201cShit, what is this?\u201d\u201cOpen the door.\u201d\u201cN-No! You can\u2019t come in! Go away!\u201d\u201cThere is a wounded person.\u201d\u201cWe are already in a full state! We don\u2019t need any more people!\u201dIt was full of people? Strange. Was there such a development?\u201cI don\u2019t care about that.\u201dI used the thorn as a lever and lifted the shutter as hard as possible. Since I used the coins to increase my strength to level 10, I now had the strength of half a dozen adult males.\u201cUwaaaaack!\u201dThere was a loud sound and the people on the other side of the shutter became nervous.\u201cR-Run away!\u201dThe scared men escaped into the darkness of the underground passage. I entered the station safely, lowered the shutter and put the girl down on the floor.[You have entered the safety zone.]The poisonous fog didn\u2019t come down to the underground area. There was no possible scientific explanation. It was just because of the \u2018scenario.\u2019\u201cPut this in your mouth.\u201dI took off the woman\u2019s mask and handed over the monkey\u2019s lungs. It wouldn\u2019t completely cure her but it would have a neutralizing effect.\u201cUmm\u2026\u201dA faint groan emerged from the mouth of the woman. The woman who was abandoned.I suddenly wondered about her information. This woman, it was likely that she had died in the original development.A voice was heard as I was about to use Character List.\u201cThere he is!\u201dLight from a flashlight approached in the darkness. My eyes narrowed as I saw men holding metal pipes.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 frowns at the appearance of the uninvited people.]A big man in the middle opened his mouth. His body was well balanced so he must be a strong person.\u201cWho are you?\u201dAt this moment, I was strangely struck dumb. What should I say when this happened? I thought for a moment before speaking like Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d\u201c\u2026Kim Dokja? That is your name?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWho asked that? What is this bastard?\u201dIt was a more difficult question.\u201cU-Uh! That woman\u2026\u201dOne of the men found the woman beside me and shone the flashlight on her.\u2019\u201cWhat, isn\u2019t that woman from the marginalized group? Didn\u2019t you come back with her?\u201d\u201cT-That is\u2026\u201dThe man\u2019s flashlight moved in a harassing manner near the woman\u2019s waist.\u201c\u2026Ha, so it was like that. Cute guys. Why did you do that without Hyung-nim\u2019s permission?\u201d\u201cHehe. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, of course Cheolsoo hyung-nim should be first\u2026hehe, I was going to do that.\u201dCheolsoo? Cheolsoo. Was there a character by that name? I couldn\u2019t remember. He must be nothing, as opposed to how he looked.\u201cHey, hand that woman over to us\u2026huh? What is that?\u201dThe flashlight shone on the convenience store bags on the floor. It was okay to escape the crisis but the flow was turning out bad.\u201cLeave that as well. Then you can live.\u201dTo be exact, it wasn\u2019t good for these guys, not me.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is annoyed at these people.][The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is angry with the injustice occurring.][A bounty scenario has occurred at the request of the constellations!]+[Bounty Scenario \u2013 Remove the Interference]Category: SubDifficulty: FClear Conditions: The constellations feel great anger at the disruptors who are obstructing your rapid movements.

It must be the laziness of the authors to think that crimes such as rape or theft would occur indiscriminately in such a situation. If the real \u2018destruction\u2019 came, wouldn\u2019t humans act more rationally than they thought?\u201cIt looks like he won\u2019t give it. Hey, go ahead and kill him!\u201dThe answer was now right in front of me. I observed the men coming towards me, as well as the man watching from the rear.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 expects a fair judgment.]I once again realized it. The human imagination was clich\u00e9, yet real humans were more clich\u00e9 than the imagination.Hwiiik!The trajectory of the iron pipe moved in a funny manner through the air. It wasn\u2019t a strike with the intent to kill. In fact, it didn\u2019t hurt that much.\u201cI-If you don\u2019t run away then you really will die. Get lost!\u201dThe four men surrounded me. One was trembling but the others looked more relaxed than before. It was probably due to the advantage in numbers.\u201cWhat are these brats doing?\u201dWaaaah!\u00a0Along with the shout, one man rushed forward. It was clearly a defenseless posture. I moved the thorn.Puok!\u201cAaaaack! My leg! My leg!\u201d\u201cYou bastard!\u201d\u201cHit him together!\u201dThe agitated men rushed simultaneously but I wasn\u2019t afraid. Their strength level was just above 5. I endured the incoming attacks and silently stabbed the thorn.Tang!\u00a0Kaaang!Puok!\u00a0Puok!The men had their thighs successively pierced and fell to their knees with a scream. But I didn\u2019t kill them. It was because the scenario clear condition was to \u2018neutralize\u2019 them.[The constellations of the absolute good system nod at your judgment.][A few constellations laugh at your humanity.][The constellations have sponsored you 100 coins.]If I became a murderer, I might be able to attract the attention of the constellations for a while. However, it was only a while. Instantly raising the threshold of stimulation wasn\u2019t good in the long run.[There are three minutes to the end of the scenario.]Two minutes had passed. Time calculation was important in time attack scenarios.\u201cW-What the hell is this bastard? Why won\u2019t you die?\u201dAt this time, their leader who was watching the situation from the back came forward.\u201cYou are a fairly tough guy. Everyone back off. I will deal with him.\u201d\u201cCheolsoo hyung-nim! This guy seems to have a pretty strong sponsor!\u201d\u201cGood. It looks like he has a lot of coins.\u201dKnuckles shining with a black gloss. They weren\u2019t ordinary iron knuckles. Did he receive it from his sponsor?Crunch.There was the relaxed sound of bones cracking from the knuckled hands.[The character \u2018Cheolsoo\u2019 has used Threaten.][Threaten doesn\u2019t work because the overall capabilities gap is too big.]\u201cHoh, aren\u2019t you quite good? You aren\u2019t getting scared at all.\u201dThe man\u2019s fist moved before he finished talking. The attack was aimed exactly at my jaw. I quickly stepped back. That guy smiled.\u201cAren\u2019t you quite good? Do you exercise?\u201dEven if I didn\u2019t have a footwork skill, anyone could do this if their agility exceeded level 10. Since I previously invested most of my remaining coins after buying items, the total sum of my body stats now reached 33.Should I look at this guy?[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.][Character Information]Name: Bang Cheolsoo.Age: 34 years old.Constellation Sponsor: Monarch of the Small Fries.Private Attribute: Assault Force Captain (General)Exclusive skills: Dogfight Lv. 2, Bluff Lv. 2.Stigmata: [Threaten Lv.1]Overall Stats: Stamina Lv. 6, Strength Lv. 7, Agility Lv. 6, Magic Power Lv. 2.Overall Evaluation: A common small fry who was lucky to obtain a sponsor. He has a tendency to overstate his abilities compared to his actual combat strength.Ah\u2026right. Now I remembered.\u201cBang Cheolsoo of the Cheoldoo Group.\u201d\u201cWhat, you know me?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see?\u201dMy memory was dim because he disappeared like the wind at the beginning of the work, but I fuzzily recalled there was a character called Bang Cheolsoo.He was the stupidest guy in the group at Gumho Station.As far as I knew, these guys should\u2019ve been killed by Yoo Jonghyuk. Why were they still alive?\u201cOhu, perhaps you are of \u2018that\u2019 category? You must\u2019ve killed people. Isn\u2019t that right? Yes, I feel that we are somewhat alike.\u201d[The character \u2018Bang Cheolsoo\u2019 has used Bluff.]Bluff. It was a skill that anyone who was a thug possessed. It was a good debuff that could weaken the opponent\u2019s attack power, but this case was different.[Fourth Wall has blocked the bluff of the character Bang Cheolsoo.][The confidence of the character Bang Cheolsoo is rapidly falling.]\u201cAre you ignoring me? You really want to die.\u201dBang Cheolsoo took a threatening Greco-Roman wrestling posture and rushed towards me. But that was only a bluff. It was because he didn\u2019t have the \u2018wrestling\u2019 skill.\u201cStop beating around the bush and come on.\u201d\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201dThe key skill that Bang Cheolsoo had was Dogfight Lv. 2. His combat power was insignificant unless he got into a melee.\u201cDie!\u201dThe agility difference was so high that his attacks rarely hit me. I looked at him with a bit of sympathy.Not all constellations had a desire to raise their incarnations as the \u2018protagonist\u2019 of the scenario.For example, his constellation \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries\u2019 was famous for being thrifty with his incarnations. A masochist who enjoyed using idiots as his incarnation, enjoying watching them be crushed by other incarnations.That was the \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries.\u2019[The constellation \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries\u2019 is delighted.][The constellation \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries\u2019 has sponsored you 100 coins.]Despite his incarnation being smashed, he was supporting the enemy. Originally, I was thinking about ending the time attack in one blow but now the story was a bit different.[There are two minutes to the end of the sub scenario.]Then I should make the most of the remaining time.\u201cYou rat bastard!\u201dAll of his lines were in the style of the Monarch of the Small Fries. How pitiful.Peeok!\u201cHaha! I hit you!\u201dHis attack luckily hit but there was little damage. The spot where I was hit just stung a bit.\u201cHow?\u201dHow? My stamina was Lv. 12. His strength was only Lv. 7. The difference in the overall stats gap created a huge combat power gap.\u201cIs it my turn now?\u201dI touched the cheek of the stupefied Bang Cheolsoo before hitting it as hard as I could. A few teeth flew out as Bang Cheolsoo screamed. I didn\u2019t hesitate and pierced his arm precisely with the thorn.\u201cAaaagh!\u201dI fixed one of his arms to the wall with the thorn and started the indiscriminate assault. I chose the areas that were the most painful without knocking him out, such as the back, thigh, femur and side.[The constellation \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries\u2019 is delighted.][The constellation \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries\u2019 has requested an extension of the sub scenario time.][The sub scenario is extended by one minute.]I also paid attention to the parts where the woman had been injured.\u201cCough! Kuheok! Kuheeok!\u201dBlood and flesh were scattered. Broken teeth fell to the ground and the broken bones twisted abnormally. However, I didn\u2019t stop kicking.\u201cS-Stop! Please! Let Hyung-nim go!\u201dThe men standing to the side exclaimed with panic. I looked over at them once in a while. Then he looked at the half naked woman lying on the ground.Humans were weak. How could such weak humans do such cruel things? They used the excuse of the world being destroyed. They killed, raped women and stole from others.Was it because of instincts?I was suddenly curious as I saw Bang Cheolsoo\u2019s eyes stained with fear in front of a stronger violence?\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201dIt was a question out of nowhere. In fact, I didn\u2019t expect an answer to this question. But the moment I was about to kick him again, Bang Cheolsoo opened his eyes.\u201cFuck\u2026just kill me you son of a bitch.\u201dThe moment I saw his eyes, I knew he had answered my question in his own way. A look that didn\u2019t show any lingering attachment to life. Yes. It wasn\u2019t because of instincts.Bang Cheolsoo talked in a voice that was subsiding.\u201cDog, this dog-like world\u2026\u201dThis guy was a human who had been despairing long before this world was destroyed. Just like me.[There are 10 seconds left to the end of the sub scenario.]I didn\u2019t delay any further and gave a strong kick to his neck.The breath was knocked out of him and Bang Cheolsoo finally fainted.[You have met the conditions to clear the sub scenario.][You have earned 300 coins.]I hope all of you are happy.[The constellation \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries\u2019 is satisfied and has sponsored you 100 coins.]The other men crawled and approached me one by one.\u201cH-How cruel\u2026\u201dThey looked at Bang Cheolsoo, who had been turned into a rag, and then up at me with fear. It was like they were dogs waiting to be disposed of at a slaughterhouse.I picked up the collapsed woman and the convenience store bags. In any case, the world had been destroyed and I had to live a new life.\u201cTake me to where the group is.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Gumho Station was originally a place that would grow into the region\u2019s base after it was organized by Yoo Jonghyuk.In his first regression, Yoo Jonghyuk broke through the second main scenario with the Gumho Station group, allowing the people of the group to occupy a place in the new era.But that was the first story. By the third round of regression, Yoo Jonghyuk was different.The 3rd turn Yoo Jonghyuk was a monster who monopolized everything.\u201c\u2026Even so, he was someone who would do the basic clean up.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThe man guiding me was surprised.\u201cI\u2019m just talking to myself. It is a habit.\u201d[The constellation Secretive Plotter likes your monologues.]\u201cYes\u2026anyway, this way.\u201dThe men of the Cheoldoo Group, who were supporting each other, stopped moving. We descended to the bottom of the dark platform and found a place where there was still light.I heard the buzzing sound of people as we went down the stairs.\u201cThe Cheoldoo Group! People are hurt!\u201dSome people rushed over to support Bang Cheolsoo\u2019s group. There was more of a system then I thought since people were moving in an orderly fashion.In the meantime, I saw familiar faces run over.\u201cOh my god. Dokja-ssi! Dokja-ssi!\u201dFortunately, it looks like nothing happened.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad. Really, I\u2019m really glad!\u201dYoo Sangah stood in front of me with a happy expression. I was startled and asked for an awkward handshake. There were a lot of scrapes on the back of Yoo Sangah\u2019s hand, showing she had suffered quite a hard time in the past four days.I heard a sound and something became attached to my leg.\u201cYou\u2019re alive.\u201dIt was Lee Gilyoung. I stroked the boy\u2019s head.\u201cHave you been well?\u201dLee Gilyoung nodded. He must be hungry since his cheeks were really thin. I pulled out a chocolate bar from the bag and placed it in Lee Gilyoung\u2019s hand.\u201cI knew you were alive, Dokja-ssi. Hah\u2026\u201dFinally, I looked at Lee Hyunsung. The muscles of his upper half seemed to have become more solid. Maybe Lee Hyunsung had protected these two.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. At that time, I left Dojka-ssi\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was an unavoidable situation.\u201d\u201cPhew, I\u2019m glad that Yoo Jonghyuk-ssi was right.\u201d\u2026Yoo Jonghyuk? Why was that name heard here?Lee Hyunsung noticed after a moment and said.\u201cThat, Yoo Jonghyuk said that Dokja-ssi was probably alive\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Where is Yoo Jonghyuk now?\u201d\u201cHe isn\u2019t here now.\u201dNot here?\u201cYoo Jonghyuk-ssi left the station yesterday. So\u2026\u201dI could determine many things before Lee Hyunsung finished speaking. I see. It was truly like that. He was a person in a rush.\u201cThat reminds me, there is one more person.\u201d\u201cAh, the department head.\u201dYoo Sangah didn\u2019t finish speaking because a group of men suddenly intruded. But it was a good thing.\u201cEverybody, out of the way!\u201dI didn\u2019t have to hear the explanation to see what happened straight away. Three or four men armed with a hammer or pipe started to surround me. There was a familiar face among them.\u201cY-You\u2026!\u201dHan Myungoh abandoned me on the Even Bridge and now he looked like he had seen a ghost. Han Myungoh must\u2019ve joined this group.\u201cG-Get rid of that guy! He is a very bad person! He shouldn\u2019t be here!\u201dA thief was always the one who felt pins and needles. Han Myungoh started exclaiming wildly.However, I noticed that the other men looked at each other and didn\u2019t easily move. There was something weird. Han Myungoh was placed in the centre yet they didn\u2019t listen to him?\u201cHaha, Han hyung. Everyone should get along so why don\u2019t you stop?\u201d\u201cAh, t-that\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are a new person.\u201dThe men split apart to the sides and a path was formed. A slim man appeared among them. I could tell just by looking in his eyes. This guy had a sponsor.\u201cNice to meet you. Can I ask what your name is?\u201d\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi. I see. I am Cheon Inho.\u201dCheon Inho? It felt like a name I should remember. I inserted strength to the hand holding the thorn. It looked like this guy was the leader of the Cheoldoo Group. He lost half of his men to me so he came here to make trouble.\u201cI heard the story from those you came with. You fought a monster and saved my group members.\u201d\u2026What?\u201cEveryone, please gather! We have a brave new group member!\u201dAfter Cheon Inho\u2019s words, people started to turn this way one by one.It was at this time that I knew. It was impossible for the charisma of Han Myungoh to gather this much power. Cheon Inho was the real leader of this bunch.\u201cWah! It is food!\u201dHungry eyes fell on the convenience store bags. Then Cheon Inho spoke as if he had been waiting.\u201cHe delivered it exactly to us. He is a rare good person.\u201dThe words made all the eyes look at me like I was a savior. The mother holding the child and the elderly man who hurt his leg were looking at me earnestly.Cheon Inho\u2026I seemed to remember. Yes, there was this guy in the Gumho station group.[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 is excited.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn this ruined world, the real danger wasn\u2019t people like Bang Cheolsoo. Humans moving while feeling despair weren\u2019t the least bit dangerous to me.The really dangerous people were those who used the despair of others as a fertilizer for power. Just like this guy.\u201cWelcome to Gumho Station, Kim Dokja-ssi.\u201dCheon Inho were laughing deeply while gazing at me. He inwardly laughed while shaking my hand.Cheon Inho would never know.

In other words, it wasn\u2019t the best time to deal with him.For around half a day, I focused on grasping the situation of Gumho Station. It was Lee Hyunsung who mainly gave information.\u201cCurrently, there are 86 people in Gumho Station. Ah, I guess it is 87 people now with Dokja-ssi.\u201d\u201cIt is less than I thought.\u201d\u201cYes. When the scenario broke out, only those near the station and those on the train survived. Everyone didn\u2019t say it but perhaps in the first scenario\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t need to be told the next words. I could see it from the expressions of the people. Those who survived had trampled on someone\u2019s life. All the humans here were murderers.\u201cCurrently, Gumho Station is divided into two groups. Strictly speaking, it is one group and the rest.\u201dLee Hyunsung looked at the people with a dark expression. There were men armed with iron pipes or other instruments. It was clear which was the faction in power.\u201cBelieve in me! The group president is working hard and everyone will soon be rescued.\u201dThe youngest son of Hankyung Group, Han Myungoh.\u201cHyung-nim is right, everyone. Don\u2019t lose hope. We will be able to led.\u201dThe one who embraced Han Myungoh and practically led the group was Cheon Inho. They were the \u2018mainstream group.\u2019\u201cMother, I\u2019m bored\u2026can\u2019t I play a game on the phone?\u201d\u201cHold on for a moment. The rescue team will come soon.\u201d\u201cThe government will act. It isn\u2019t that easy to collapse a country.\u201dAnd the people who were protected by the mainstream group and wanted to get on with their lives were the \u2018marginalized group.\u2019Their will was too weak to be killers. Even if 100 murderers were gathered together, they would be divided between the weak and the strong. Maybe they were thinking that they weren\u2019t murderers. They all believed it was unavoidable.Lee Hyunsung watched the mainstream group inciting the people and said.\u201cFood distribution is determined by the mainstream group. Convenience stores and restaurants in the region have already been robbed\u2026the foods that can be eaten right now are almost gone.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cIt is the reason why some people from the mainstream group were sent above ground for food exploration. Heewon-ssi, who you brought in, went with them\u201d\u201cHeewon-ssi\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh, it is the name of the woman who Dokja-ssi saved.\u201dI looked at the woman who lay on the subway bench. Under the bright light, her beauty could be seen. Her raised cheeks and gentle features meant she must\u2019ve often heard she was attractive. Thanks to the monkey\u2019s lungs, her colour was much brighter than it was this morning.\u201cIs Heewon-ssi the only one who didn\u2019t come back?\u201d\u201cNo. In fact, a few more people went out this morning but only those from the marginalized group didn\u2019t return.\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t come back?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLee Hyunsung\u2019s expression became sad again. He thought he roughly knew what happened.I grabbed Lee Hyunsung\u2019s shoulder. I knew for sure after actually touching him. He truly was the steel sword. His strength would soon exceed level 10.\u201cW-Why are you\u2026?\u201d\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi should\u2019ve received a love call but you didn\u2019t accept.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201dObjectively, Lee Hyunsung\u2019s combat power was higher than Bang Cheolsoo. There was no way Cheon Inho wouldn\u2019t aim for him.\u201cI can\u2019t explain it but I thought I shouldn\u2019t accept. I don\u2019t know much about morals or ethics but\u2026\u201dLee Hyunsung scratched his head like he was embarrassed.\u201cI felt that something wasn\u2019t right.\u201dNot right\u2026 It wasn\u2019t an answer but I felt it was true. Indeed, Lee Hyunsung was Lee Hyunsung.\u201cDon\u2019t forget this heart.\u201dThat way, I could continue to believe in him.I heard a cute sound from somewhere and looked back, seeing Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung looking up at me. Their faces were like baby birds waiting for the mother bird, making me laugh.\u201cThat reminds me, it is already evening. Aren\u2019t you hungry? Take this one by one.\u201dI handed over the food from the convenience store one by one.\u201cAh. Really? Can I?\u201d\u201cThis time is free. But next time, you should pay for it.\u201d\u201cHuh? H-How much\u2026?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you all have coins? It is 10 coins for one.\u201d\u201cT-That\u2026\u201dConfusion filled the faces of Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung. They looked like they hadn\u2019t expected my words.\u201cOf course. I will pay right now. I don\u2019t need freebies.\u201dSurprisingly, the one who spoke was the woman who had been lying on the bench. She had regained consciousness.\u201cI am Jung Heewon. Thank you for your help this morning.\u201d\u201cIt is nothing.\u201dI thought it was just a cute mask but I could see that it was a prejudice.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, Lee Hyunsung-ssi. Everyone, please wake up. It isn\u2019t the time to be making this look. This food, he obtained it by risking his life. Do you expect to get it for free?\u201dThere was almost no expression on the face that spoke without hesitation.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Yoo Sangah turned red like she had woken up. \u201cI was too short-sighted, I\u2019m sorry. Of course we should pay\u2026it is right. I don\u2019t like freebies either. I hate depending on other people.\u201d\u201cI also agree with Yoo Sangah-ssi. I will pay coins from now on.\u201dI was a little surprised by the unexpected reaction. Indeed, just because it was an apocalypse didn\u2019t mean there was only one type of person.\u201cIf you insist\u2026I understand. Does everyone know how to exchange coins?\u201d\u201cYes. I learned a few days ago. Touch each other\u2019s index finger, um, and\u2026\u201d\u201cJust state how many coins you want to exchange.\u201dStarting from Jung Heewon, Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung paid 10 coins in exchange for food. It was fortunate that their resistance wasn\u2019t bigger than what I thought.I didn\u2019t do this in order to get a few coins. At first, this judgment might seem harsh but people would soon realize this choice was right.[\u2019Lee Gilyoung\u2019 has paid you 20 coins.]\u201cHuh? You gave me more than 10 coins?\u201d\u201cIt is the price for the chocolate bar during the day.\u201dLee Gilyoung\u2019s expression while speaking was quite good. Maybe the fastest to adapt to a new world wasn\u2019t an adult but a child. It was easier for children to break common sense.\u201cWill Dokja-ssi keep staying with us?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t Lee Hyunsung who called out to me. I looked back and saw Cheon Inho from the mainstream group. Yes, I thought he would be back soon.\u201cCan I talk with you for a while?\u201dBang Cheolsoo was missing some teeth and glaring at me from behind Cheon Inho. He stared at me before turning his head away. A foolish fellow.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s talk.\u201dI nodded and Cheon Inho spoke with a satisfied expression.\u201cThen can the rest of you vacate this place for a moment? I want to talk to Dokja-ssi alone.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to go. You can listen.\u201dCheon Inho\u2019s eyes twitched at my words. Lee Hyunsung stopped as he was about to retreat.\u201cHmmm, is that so? Well\u2026I don\u2019t care.\u201dHe acted like they were free to listen. Cheon Inho wiped the bench and sat down. Men from the Cheoldoo Group appeared on both sides of him and handed him a cigarette and lighter. He had seen too many movies.\u201cYou seem to have a nature that dislikes cumbersome things, so I will get to the point.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cJoin our group.\u201dIt was an expected offer.\u201cI can offer Dokja-ssi a high position in our group. I want to lead the group together with you.\u201d\u201cWhy me?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t you know why?\u201dCheon Inho glanced towards the injured Cheoldoo Group members.\u201cDokja-ssi is a hero who saved people from monsters. A hero needs such a place.\u201dIt was an interesting way of thinking. He would take advantage of my presence.\u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d\u201cRefuse? How interesting. I never thought about that.\u201d Cheon Inho blew out cigarette smoke towards me. \u201cDokja-ssi, this isn\u2019t a favour. You have a duty to do this. Can\u2019t you see the poor people here?\u201dPeople were looking this way with scruffy faces. There were crying children and tired elderly people.\u201cIt isn\u2019t a big story. I am asking you to work together for survival. Dokja-ssi, don\u2019t you have the strength?\u201d\u201cWhat exactly do you want?\u201d\u201cI need someone to be a hitman.\u201dHitman?\u201cUntil a few days ago, there was someone else doing the job. He procured food alone and hunted in the tunnels. To be exact, we took it one-sidedly.\u201dI didn\u2019t need to ask.This was the story of Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201cBut he suddenly left last night.\u201d\u201cSo you need someone to replace him?\u201d\u201cI think your strength is proven with Cheolsoo-ssi.\u201dLee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes widened. Now they noticed what was going on.\u201cIt isn\u2019t bad for Dokja-ssi. You are the hero of the people and will be the leader of the group with us. Everyone will like you and also\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t be responsible for anyone. I don\u2019t want to join your group.\u201d\u201cHrmm. Is that so?\u201d\u201cAbove all, the way you run the group doesn\u2019t fit me.\u201dI looked at the health members of the Cheoldoo Group and the sickly-looking members of the marginalized group. In particular, Jung Heewon was looking at the Cheon Inho as if he was her mortal enemy.\u201cIs that so? It is fine. But if you change your mind, come back anytime.\u201d\u201cThat will not happen.\u201d\u201cHaha, it remains to be seen.\u201dIt didn\u2019t take long to find out what Cheon Inho\u2019s words meant.As the members of the Cheoldoo Group retreated, the other group members approached as if they had been waiting. It was the people of the marginalized group. They grabbed me and raised their voices.\u201cHey, is the rumour true?\u201d\u201cAre you really monopolizing the food?\u201d\u201cAre you going to eat it all when there is enough to share with everyone?\u201d\u201cWe are all staying here! Why are you the only one to have it?\u201d\u201cLeave the food to Inho-ssi! He will distribute it fairly!\u201dI knew what was going on. I could see the smiling face of Cheon Inho in the rear of the people. His lips were moving.\u2018Choose.\u2019Would I give food and become the hero? Or would I be the villain and monopolize it alone?If I chose to be the hero, I would fall into Cheon Inho\u2019s game. After the food was distributed, I would have to hunt for food with the group members and would someday get stabbed in the back.On the other hand, I would be isolated in a group in a moment if I monopolized the food alone.[The eyes of a few constellations are shining.][The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 has snorted.]As the people became heated up, Cheon Inho came forward.\u201cAhh, everyone. Calm down. There seems to be a misunderstanding. Kim Dokja-ssi isn\u2019t such a person.\u201dWhat was this? A decoy?\u201cKim Dokja-ssi decided to work with us. The food he brought today will be left to the mainstream group and will be shared fairly. He also promised to continue to work with us\u2015\u201dOf course, he believed I would choose him. It was hard to listen anymore.\u201cStop.\u201dI worried about it for a short moment. What would Yoo Jonghyuk do? Ah, that\u2019s it. The answer was that he wasn\u2019t here right now.But I wasn\u2019t Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201cOf course I will give out food.\u201d I saw Cheon Inho\u2019s lips curve upwards. But people should listen to the end. \u201cHowever, it isn\u2019t for free.\u201dUnlike Yoo Jonghyuk, I wouldn\u2019t throw everything away to move forward. But I wouldn\u2019t be responsible for everyone. Food was given but it wouldn\u2019t be for free.People were puzzled as if they didn\u2019t understand the words.\u201cW-Wait a minute! It isn\u2019t free?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you. I don\u2019t intend to monopolize the food. But I won\u2019t give food to Cheon Inho\u2019s group. I\u2019m not UNICEF and I don\u2019t trust them.\u201dI smiled at Cheon Inho.\u201cI will make a deal with you. I will sell you the food for a fair price.\u201d\u201cS-Sell?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\u201cUh, how much\u2026money?\u201dIn the distance, I could see Cheon Inho\u2019s face stiffening. I laugh as I faced him.\u201cNo, I only accept coins.\u201d*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *After a while, only the people in the marginalized group with a relationship with me returned.\u201cThat\u2026D-Dokja-ssi. Is this a good choice?\u201d\u201cSheesh, is there anything free in life? Dokja-ssi, you said it well. I feel refreshed.\u201dJung Heewon dismissed Lee Hyunsung\u2019s concern. After I made the \u2018trade\u2019 declaration, many citizens turned away from me. Maybe they were disappointed.\u201cI agree with Heewon-ssi. The people here are too tame to the mainstream group.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The sons of bitches\u2026Gumho Station is currently in their palms. People are treated as cattle and are sometimes taken to a slaughterhouse. Just like myself this morning.\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s body trembled.In fact, it wasn\u2019t me but the mainstream group monopolizing the food. They monopolized the food on the pretext of \u2018fair distribution\u2019 and feed it to the tamed people.Humans were the weakest when they believed someone protected them. Once authority was established in a one-sided relationship, people started to depend on them.\u201cI agree. That\u2019s why I believe that Dokja-ssi\u2019s declaration today was very meaningful. People need to have the will to do something on their own. However\u2026\u201dLee Hyunsung looked towards the food.\u201cNot even one was sold. 50 coins for one, isn\u2019t this price too expensive? Why don\u2019t you make it 10 coins like you did with us\u2026?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t unreasonable to think so. People only paid attention to the mainstream group and showed no signs of looking this way. People still needed time.I responded calmly.\u201cLet\u2019s wait a little longer.\u201dThen night came.The sound of huge monsters was heard intermittently from the ground and people often had nightmares. Lee Gilyoung and Yoo Sangah fell asleep first while Jung Heewon was dozing off.\u201cDokja-ssi should sleep as well. I will stand vigil.\u201d\u201cNope. It is okay. Lee Hyunsung-ssi can sleep first.\u201d\u201cBut you will be tired.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI have work to do.\u201d\u201cWork to do?\u201dI pointed behind Lee Hyunsung. Surprisingly, there were the shadows of people. It wasn\u2019t just one.\u201cThat\u2026are you still trading the food?\u201dFinally, the people started to move.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jung Heewon stared at the convenience store bags as if she couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cOh my god, it is sold out?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHa, really funny. Everyone was just watching and now\u2026\u201d\u201cNope, it isn\u2019t just the marginalized group.\u201dThe guests who came in the middle of the night weren\u2019t just members of the marginalized group.\u201cKim Dokja-ssi, you are making the worst choice.\u201dAmong them was Cheon Inho.\u201cYou will regret it.\u201dMore than half the food I had was taken by the mainstream group. Of course, they paid the exact amount.Jung Heewon was in a rage after hearing the story.\u201cWait a minute. Then the mainstream group will just monopolize the food again?\u201d\u201cSomething like that.\u201d\u201cNo, what is this? Weren\u2019t you going to weaken the power of the mainstream group by promoting transactions among the people?\u201dIt was unexpected insight. I responded with a bit of admiration.\u201cThat\u2019s correct. That was the intent. I wanted people to move voluntarily.\u201d\u201cThen why did you sell food to the mainstream group? The situation won\u2019t change!\u201d\u201cIt has changed. I have obtained coins.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dIt was 1,450 coins. It was a huge income for one night.\u201cNo\u2026what is Dokja-ssi thinking? Sangah-ssi, can we really trust this man?\u201dYoo Sangah flinched as attention suddenly turned to her but then she smiled brightly.\u201cI believe in him.\u201dIt was burdensome.\u201cDokja-ssi, did you leave enough food for yourself?\u201d\u201cNope, I sold it.\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s mouth fell open as if she was dumbfounded. At that time, someone poked my cheek. I turned my head and found a biscuit.\u201cHuh? You want me to eat it?\u201dNod nod.\u00a0The head moved cutely. I smiled, took the biscuit and put it in Lee Gilyoung\u2019s mouth.\u201cI\u2019m okay. You eat it. Ah, I should tell you something\u2026 everyone, do you still have the food you ate yesterday?\u201d\u201cYes, I have it.\u201d\u201cI have a bit left.\u201d\u201cWhy? Do you want to buy it back? I will sell it.\u201d Jung Heewon waved the biscuit in a playful manner.\u201cNo, you should eat it now.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cEat it all before today. You should do it.\u201d I repeatedly stressed. \u201cOr you will regret it.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026no, wait a minute. Sangah-ssi, what are you doing now? Why are you listening to him?\u201d\u201cThere is a reason why Dokja-ssi would say this.\u201dYoo Sangah smiled sweetly and opened a bag of biscuits. Lee Hyunsung was confused but ate the food. Meanwhile, Lee Gilyoung had eaten it the moment I spoke. He was a good listener.\u201cAh well\u2026I will leave one back.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t stop you.\u201dI shrugged at Jung Heewon\u2019s words. It was up to her to regret it.At lunch time, there was a major announcement from the mainstream group. Cheon Inho stood on a platform surrounded by people and said.\u201cWe will limit the food ration from today. The allocation is three biscuits per person. And\u2015\u201dPeople became irritated before the speech was over.\u201cWhat? Three biscuits? How can we live on that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Don\u2019t the scouts get more food? Do you think we don\u2019t know?\u201dDespite being cursed at, Cheon Inho just laughed calmly.\u201cYour words are good. Yes. The scouts receive more rations. If you want food, please apply to be a scout.\u201d\u201cVery few people have come back after applying to be a scout! The Cheoldoo Group members are the ones who always come back!\u201d\u201cDo you want us to die now?\u201dCheon Inho was nonchalant despite the violence reactions of the citizens.\u201cThose people were just unlucky. You know that it is terribly dangerous outside. Why don\u2019t you obtain food yourself if you are dissatisfied?\u201d\u201cT-That\u2026\u201dThe people closed their mouths dumbly. If they went out now, they would die. Everyone knew this.Cheon Inho wasn\u2019t finished.\u201cAh, there is a way to get food without being a scout.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cA deal. We will be happy to exchange food for anything we determine to be of value. Every person can give something different. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dCheon Inho\u2019s cold gaze caused the people to tremble. It was mostly the people who came to me yesterday and bought food.[The character \u2018Cheon Inho\u2019 has activated the \u2018Incite Lv. 2\u2019 skill.\u201cOriginally, I wasn\u2019t going to do this. But yesterday, Kim Dokja-ssi told me something nice. That\u2019s right everyone. Is there anything free in the world? If you want food, you have to prove your worth. This is the way it is. Haha, thank you for telling me something good. Kim Dokja-ssi.\u201d\u2026Look at this?At this moment, everyone\u2019s attention was focused on me. Their eyes were mostly filled with resentment.\u201cBecause of that bastard\u2026\u201dPeople wanted to be stupid and Cheon Inho had the \u2018Incite\u2019 skill. It was a skill that most good group leaders would have. But this way, the hostility would turn towards me again\u2026I looked at the back of Cheon Inho. It was a cute level. At least compared to the people at Chungmuro and Seoul Station.The people gathered in front of the podium were already trying to bargain.\u201cI-I will buy it with coins. How much do you want?\u201d\u201c200 coins.\u201d\u201cHuh? But I don\u2019t have that many coins.\u201d\u201cThen go away.\u201d200 coins for one piece of food. Even the dokkaebi was likely to pass out.One of the Cheoldoo Group selling food saw my look and trembled. He had a bandage around his thigh and seemed to be one of the guys I beat up yesterday.\u201cDid I ever say thank you for yesterday?\u201dI suddenly turned my head and saw Jung Heewon standing nearby.\u201cI think I heard it.\u201d\u201cStill, I want to thank you again.\u201dI wanted to say something but Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes were fixed on the injured Cheoldoo member.\u201cThe one with the injured leg, he was the one who tried to rape me yesterday.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t touch him because I will kill him myself. Understood?\u201dHer killing intent was impressive. Was she chosen by a sponsor or was it a late blooming attribute?[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]I was a little worried about using this skill. This woman would\u2019ve died if I hadn\u2019t saved her. Would she be registered as a character?[Character Information]Name: Jung HeewonAge: 27 years old.Constellation Sponsor: None (Three constellations are currently showing interest in this person).Private Attribute: Crouching Figure (General)Exclusive skills: Demon Slayer Lv. 1, Kendo Lv. 1.Stigmata: NoneOverall Stats: Stamina Lv. 4, Strength Lv. 4, Agility Lv. 7, Magic Power Lv. 4.Overall Evaluation: She was a \u2018crouching figure\u2019 with enormous potential. The attribute information wasn\u2019t verified yet because the attribute hadn\u2019t blossomed.Fortunately, her information appeared. It was different from Yoo Sangah, Lee Gilyoung and Han Myungoh. Was she originally not abandoned? By the way, it was a very interesting exclusive attribute.\u2018Crouching figure.\u2019It didn\u2019t seem big based on the name, but it was one of the few \u2018super evolutionary\u2019 attributes in Ways of Destruction. \u2018Crouching Figure\u2019 was a general rated attribute, but it could reach a rare or legendary rating depending on the occasion.One of the 100 strongest people in Ways of Survival, the Crazy Butcher evolved from \u2018Crouching Figure.\u2019Jung Heewon I thought she was just a passing person but I might have to consider taking her as a colleague.It would take a while to grow her \u2018Demon Slaying\u2019 skill but this woman could become a powerful hitman if she was raised well.\u201cBy the way, Dokja-ssi is very calm.\u201dCalm\u2026 It might seem like that.\u201cI am familiar with situations like this in the novel.\u201d\u201cHuh? Does that make sense\u2026 Wait a minute. Where are you going?\u201dI didn\u2019t answer and descended from the platform. Jung Heewon wanted to come with me and I reached out a hand to stop her.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dJung Heewon landed lightly below the platform.I walked along the railway tracks and watched the tunnel road to Yaksu Station. It was filled with thick darkness and the inside wasn\u2019t visible, but it smelt terrible. It was a bloody smell.\u201cYou aren\u2019t going inside are you?\u201dJung Heewon asked.\u201cEveryone who went that way has died. The thugs or anyone else. Everyone who goes inside will unconditionally die.\u201dHer words were wrong. Not everyone died. At least one person had already gone down this road and moved onto the next station.We climbed onto the platform again. We had been gone for quite a time but the line of people to trade food was still long.Some people who protested against the mainstream group were beaten up and other paid unusual prices for the food.Shortly afterwards, Jung Heewon saw a few young women from the marginalized group sneak into the back of a tarp and she became furious.\u201cAh, really annoying. Did you see that?\u201d\u201cI saw it.\u201dCheon Inho had said it. \u2018Anything\u2019 could be exchanged for food. But the girls who just entered weren\u2019t carrying anything.Jung Heewon sprang to her feet.\u201cI can\u2019t just watch this.\u201d\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d\u201cStop it. I have to tell them not to do it, no matter the circumstances!\u201d\u201cThen those women will starve.\u201d\u201cAre you just going to watch?\u201d\u201cYes, I think you should just watch this time.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dI silently received Jung Heewon\u2019s contemptuous gaze.\u201cJung Heewon-ssi, stopping those women won\u2019t solve the current problem. Even if you stop them now, something similar will occur late at night.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then I will stop them again. I will stop it and stop it.\u201d\u201cThen what about their food? Among those who just entered the tarp, there is a mother with a child. If that child starves to death, will Jung Heewon-ssi be responsible for the child\u2019s death?\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s eyes shook. She bowed her head as if to hide her expression.\u201c\u2026Then what can I do? The alternative\u2026\u201dI looked up at Jung Heewon.With this, Jung Heewon wouldn\u2019t do anything unexpected. She was a \u2018Crouching Figure\u2019 with \u2018Demon Slaying.\u2019 Depending on how she acted, Jung Heewon might evolve into an indiscriminate murderer.\u201cJung Heewon-ssi, the key to this problem is food. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThen we need to remove the cause of the problem.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dI looked at my watch instead of answering. It was time.Kwajijijik!Yes, he showed up. The air split apart and a familiar figure was revealed. Screams came from everywhere. The nightmare of humanity that opened up this tragedy.[H-How are you all doing? Haven\u2019t you been free for a while?]The dokkaebi.\u201cA-Aaaagh!\u201dThe people panicked at the appearance of the dokkaebi. It was never a good thing when this guy showed up. Even Jung Heewon, who was full of energy, flinched momentarily.By the way, it wasn\u2019t Bihyung. Originally, Bihyung was the dokkaebi responsible for all nearby channels. But this guy was different. Unlike the pure white fur of Bihyung, this dokkaebi had black fur.[M-My friend who was originally in charge of this channel is undergoing disciplinary action\u2026 S-So, I am responsible for this scenario.]The dokkaebi\u2019s timid tone was very memorable.[T-Then everyone. D-Don\u2019t you look very peaceful? T-That Bihyung, he pretended to be pretentious only to set this level of scenario difficulty\u2026]\u201cW-What are you saying?

Aha\u2026if you want food\u2026]After his words ended, the dokkaebi moved his hand.[A scenario penalty has been added.][From now on, food stockpiling is limited.][All existing stockpiled food has disappeared.]\u201cU-Uhh! What?\u201dThe people with emergency food screamed. Whether it was from the mainstream group or marginalized group, everything that was called \u2018food\u2019 floated in the air.[He, hehe. Then everyone. You can\u2019t. Y-You have to think about how to break the scenario.]Susuk.The canned food, biscuits, calorie bars, etc. The emergency food gathered by the people were destroyed with one gesture from the dokkaebi. The people\u2019s expressions became grim when they saw the food disappearing.[Y-You want to eat? In any case, Earth trash\u2026]His tone suddenly changed. I seemed to remember his name. According to the original setting, there was one dokkaebi like this. His tone was timid but he was crueler than any dokkaebi.In the distance, Cheon Inho was watching me with confused eyes.[Everyone, let\u2019s have fun from now on. Hehe\u2026]It was followed by system messages.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[A scenario penalty has been added.][The \u2018survival cost\u2019 clause has been added.][From now on, 100 coins will be deducted every night for the \u2018survival cost\u2019.

Yihihihit!]The dokkaebi said these words and disappeared.A food penalty and survival penalty. I already knew about the former penalty. However, the latter wasn\u2019t in the original Ways of Survival. Maybe my contract with Bihyung caused this development.Jung Heewon confirmed that the biscuit in her pocket had disappeared and asked in a soft voice.\u201cDokja-ssi, did you perhaps know something like this would hap\u2015\u201d\u201cI did expect it. I thought about what the dokkaebis would do first to harass humans.\u201d\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you really good at making predictions?\u201dI called Lee Hyunsung and the others over. The situation was created and now it was time to move.\u201cGive back our food!\u201d\u201cHow, how did this happen?\u201dThe people of the marginalized group were crying. Cheon Inho and the mainstream group were also devastated by the sudden food shortage. My eyes met Cheon Inho\u2019s, who bit his lip.[Perhaps\u2026were you aware of it? No, that is impossible.]If I could read his thoughts then that\u2019s what he would be thinking.[You have accurately read the thoughts of character \u2018Cheon Inho.\u2019][Your understanding of the character \u2018Cheon Inho\u2019 has increased.]\u2026My understanding rose from this sort of thing?I looked at other people\u2019s expressions and tried to guess what they were thinking. But the previous messages didn\u2019t pop up.Meanwhile, Cheon Inho quickly gathered the people together in order to organize the chaos.\u201cEveryone, gather together. I will give you an emergency notice.\u201dThe contents of the notice were simple:The situation had become worse so more \u2018scouts\u2019 from the marginalized group was needed.\u00a0They had to hurry.\u00a0Now there was no food underground.\u201cWe won\u2019t distribute food to people who don\u2019t participate as scouts.\u201dDespite the hardline declaration, there was no backlash from the citizens. No, they couldn\u2019t. It was an inevitable result in this situation. The people noticed it and volunteered to be scouts one by one.Despite the disappearance of the food, hope remained on Cheon Inho\u2019s face. As the situation became worse, more control was passed onto the mainstream group.Lee Hyunsung became anxious when he saw this and opened his mouth.\u201cDokja-ssi, what now?\u201d\u201cOf course, we have to go and get food.\u201dThe expressions of the party members became tense at these words. Obtain food. This meant only one thing.\u201cThen we have to be scouts? There is still food remaining aboveground.\u201d\u201cNope, we won\u2019t go aboveground. If we go there, we will unconditionally die.\u201dI looked at a gas mask on the floor. This tattered gas mask couldn\u2019t stop the poisonous fog.\u201cBut we need to obtain food aboveground\u2026\u201d\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi. The world has changed. Then the food needs to change.\u201dI looked at the tunnel to Yaksu Station.\u201cWait a minute. Dokja-ssi\u2026don\u2019t tell me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dIn this world, humans were no longer the top predators. Even if we weren\u2019t predators, we didn\u2019t necessarily have to be prey.\u201cWe will hunt monsters.\u201d*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *After a while, several people from the marginalized group, including myself, were standing in front of the tunnel towards Yaksu Station.\u201cI see. You are going to enter the railway track?\u201dI thought Cheon Inho would challenge us when we refused to join the scouting group, but he seemed relieved that I was out of the group. He might think I was a threat to his own power.\u201cWell, looking at it in the long run, a team dedicated to attacking the scenario is required. Come back safely.\u201dHe was a funny guy. He spoke like he was the captain. But the time for him to be finished wasn\u2019t far off.[Your understanding of the character \u2018Cheon Inho\u2019 has increased.][Your understanding of the character \u2018Cheon Inho\u2019 has reached a certain level.]I see\u2026I got it now. There were two major cases of character \u2018understanding\u2019 rising.One was when I got the liking or trust of the character. The second was when I accurately guessed what the character was thinking. Maybe now was the latter case.[The character \u2018Cheon Inho\u2019 is suspicious of you.]According to the accumulated understanding value, a vague idea of the person\u2019s emotions could be obtained.\u201cOh, can one of my group members join? I\u2019d like to get some information on the attack.\u201dIndeed, Cheon Inho wouldn\u2019t let us go so easily. I stared at the man behind him. It was the person who would go with us and an unlucky fellow.\u201cI-I have to go with them?\u201d\u201cEh, why else are you here, Han hyung? Didn\u2019t you want to reconcile with Dokja-ssi last night?\u201d\u201cT-That\u2026\u201dCheon Inho\u2019s party member who joined us was Department Head Han Myungoh.\u201cD-Dokja-ssi.\u201d If you don\u2019t mind, I will go\u2026\u201d\u201cI understand. Let\u2019s go together.\u201dHan Myungoh was surprised when I responded readily. He thought I would refuse. Lee Hyunsung had a worried face but I had an idea.In any case, the survivors party of five people from Carriage 3807, consisting of me, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung, Yoo Sangah and Han Myungoh was reformed.\u201cCan I come as well?\u201d\u201c\u2026Is it okay even if your body isn\u2019t fully healed?\u201d\u201cThis much is fine.\u201dThere was one more. Including Jung Heewon, there was a total of six people in the party. It was a lot for a small number.Grrr\u2026Of course, the number of people wasn\u2019t much in front of the upcoming crisis.[A new sub scenario has arrived!]+[Second Scenario \u2013 Food Acquisition]Category: SubDifficulty: EClear Conditions: Directly hunt the monsters that can be used as food and cook them.Time Limit: NoneCompensation: 500 coinsFailure: ???+As soon as they stepped foot in the tunnel, a sub scenario flew in.Food acquisition. It was a sub scenario we had to go through before entering the second main scenario.[A few constellations are anticipating your performance.]The darkness of the tunnel became apparent before we even moved 10 steps. I lit up the tunnel with a flashlight but the outline of the surrounding area wasn\u2019t visible at all.It was proof of a curtain that was blocking the light. The real thing would be beyond this curtain.\u201cDokja-ssi, wait a minute. It is really dangerous from here on.\u201dJung Heewon, who walked beside me, stopped first.\u201cAre we really going this way? No matter how I look, it seems like suicide. There is also Gilyoung.\u201d\u201cIn fact, I was concerned from the beginning. It isn\u2019t too late so how about we leave Gilyoung behind? And if possible, the women\u2026\u201d\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi, I\u2019m not as good as you but I know how to fight. I took some kendo lessons.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dAn unnecessary controversy was about to heat up the atmosphere so I interrupted.\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi. I told you before. The world has changed. It is biased that a woman is physically weak. Right now, everyone can become stronger by raising their stats. But Jung Heewon-ssi, there is also a problem with your words.\u201d\u201c\u2026What is it?\u201d\u201cJust as a woman isn\u2019t weak, a child also isn\u2019t weak. Gilyoung, show them.\u201dLee Gilyoung came forward. He looked around for a while before sitting on the tunnel floor and reaching out his hand. Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cOh my god, what is that?\u201d\u201cS-Shit! Cockroaches!\u201dHan Myungoh cried out with fear.The cockroach that appeared in the distance was connected to Lee Gilyoung\u2019s fingertips with a faint solid line. The cockroach listened to Lee Gilyoung\u2019s words like a well-behaved dog and disappeared into the darkness.\u201cMy attribute is Insect Collector.\u201dInsect Collector. Lee Gilyoung possessed the rare ability to communicate simply with insects through his \u2018Diverse Communication\u2019 skill.\u201cThis is nothing in front of us. It is safe for 100 steps forward.\u201dLee Gilyoung showed an overwhelming scouting power and the other people made a stunned expression. Lee Gilyoung spoke to them with a bold expression.\u201cThank you for your concern. But I didn\u2019t follow all of you for you to take care of me.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dJung Heewon nodded with a sour expression. Lee Gilyoung came to my side and I stroked his hair.Lee Gilyoung\u2019s attribute hadn\u2019t been seen in the original Ways of Survival. It wasn\u2019t a wrong choice to save Lee Gilyoung in the beginning. We passed a clear barrier and entered the full-fledged darkness.[You have entered a dangerous area.]\u201cY-Yoo Sangah-ssi. It is dangerous to hold my hand while walking.\u201d\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you more afraid than I am?\u201d\u201cN-No!\u201dThe air inside the curtain was sticky from the humidity.\u201cReduce the light.\u201dYoo Sangah immediate covered the flashlight. Since this model didn\u2019t have a light control function, she had to adjust the light with her hand.\u201cOuch. Don\u2019t shine it downwards.\u201dJung Heewon felt nauseous when she checked the ground. There were torn bodies. The bodies of those who tried to move through here were arranged at their feet.Yoo Sangah closed her eyes tightly, Han Myungoh shook and even the bold Lee Hyunsung started sweating.Lee Gilyoung was surprisingly calm, with not the slightest bit of fear on his face. I felt a bit worried. This guy, did he think it was all a game?\u201cThere is something that isn\u2019t human.\u201dAs Lee Gilyoung said, it wasn\u2019t only the bodies of humans on the ground. There was something the size of a fully-grown wolf. The bodies of the mole-like creatures were scattered all over the place.The 9th grade underground species, the ground rat. It was a name reminiscent of bug on Earth, but a name was just a name.\u00a0 They were underground piranhas. The ground rats were persistent hunters who burrowed through the ground in groups and aimed at their prey.However, the ground rats collapsed like they had received a bombardment. Jung Heewon sighed.\u201c\u2026Who the hell did this?\u201dObviously, there was only one human who could turn the ground rats into this. Yoo Jonghyuk. He proceeded to the next station through this path alone.But I couldn\u2019t help wondering. Originally, it was supposed to be tonight or tomorrow when the third turn Yoo Jonghyuk moved to the next station.Why was he so hasty? Did he become impatient? What was the reason?\u201cDokja-ssi, can we use this for food?\u201d\u201cThe scenario said that we have to \u2018hunt\u2019 it ourselves so maybe it isn\u2019t possible.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, it is kind of uncomfortable. What about cooking? Do you want to bake it on a fire?\u201dIt could be baked. The problem was that it must be a special fire.\u201cHeewon-ssi, you said you were good at kendo?\u201d\u201cUh, it is a bit much to say I am good\u2026but what are you doing now?\u201dI stabbed the body of the ground rat and started to cut it with a knife. I didn\u2019t know when I read it in the novel but it didn\u2019t go as well as I thought.After somehow getting rid of the tough skin, I managed to remove the spine bones. This was the first time so I left many scratches, but it was useable.\u201cWhy are you taking that?\u201d\u201cYou need a weapon for kendo.\u201dThe stone hog\u2019s thorn wasn\u2019t enough but the spine of the ground rat consisted of a single bone, making it a pretty good weapon at the beginning of the scenario.After cutting the cartilage leading to the leg and shaping it, the bone actually took the shape of a knife. I gave it to Jung Heewon.\u201cThank you. Suddenly I feel like I\u2019m back to the Paleolithic age.\u201d\u201cYou need to grind it a bit more for it to be useful. There are rocks around so skillfully grind the blade.\u201cHuhu, understood. Captain.\u201dJung Heewon started to grind the blade with a slightly excited voice. I looked up and saw Lee Hyunsung watching the scene with a bit of envy.\u201cDo you want one?\u201d\u201cEh, you will make me one?\u201d\u201cAll of you come closer. It is better if you learn how to do it. Let\u2019s make it together.\u201dIn fact, this was also my first time trying it. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it if the details hadn\u2019t been included in Ways of Survival.Why wasn\u2019t Ways of Survival popular? It was simple. The author wrote too much of the setting.\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi, you are a beginner but you are good at it.\u201dWe sat down and made weapons together. This time it was a spear, not a sword. They didn\u2019t have the Kendo skill so I decided it was more stable to make a long spear.Lee Hyunsung\u2019s spear was made with the spine of the largest ground rat while Yoo Sangah and Han Myungoh\u2019s weapons were made with the spine of average sized ground rats. Finally, Lee Gilyoung\u2019s weapon was made with the head bone of a young ground rat.[You have succeeded in acquiring weapons by yourself.][A very small number of constellations are interested in the primitive nature of humanity.][The constellations have sponsored you 100 coins.]Everyone received these messages.\u201cWe receive coins even for this type of thing.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want you to die. You have your own coins?\u201d\u201cYes, we do.\u201d\u201cWhenever possible, leave enough coins for the survival cost and invest the rest in your strength, stamina and agility. Otherwise, you won\u2019t survive.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dWe finished the preparations and started to move forward again. The 100 steps that Lee Gilyoung mentioned was right in front of us now.[The sub scenario \u2013 Food Acquisition has begun!]The ground rats crawled out from the ground. I quickly counted the numbers. One, two, three\u2026there were exactly 13. It was more than I thought.Grrr\u2026The group of land rats drew a line and started threatening us. The moment we crossed the line, the fight would begin.\u201cThere is no plan. We are beginners. It might sound cruel but honestly, I don\u2019t expect you to survive.\u201d\u201cT-That\u2026\u201d\u201cStill, all of you survive. Please.\u201dHan Myungoh was the only upset one in the party. Everyone else was nervous but looked determined. In particular, Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes were very impressive.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s try it. Everybody, please live!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJust as Yoo Jonghyuk tested me, I also had expectations for them. No matter how good a mentor, a person who wasn\u2019t determined couldn\u2019t survive in this world.In the end, it was up to a person to save themselves. Everyone should use this opportunity to realize it clearly.\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201dI also knew who I must take among these people.As we took one more step, the ground rats moved. The battle began.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was actually a little bit surprising. In particular, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon who stepped forward with me were very influential.The battle composition naturally became the three of us in front with the other three in the rear. Less than a minute after the battle began, a few ground rats were stuck on the ground with their necks pierced.Lee Hyunsung overpowered another ground rat, wiped the sweat on his forehead and said.\u201c\u2026I think I can live.\u201dOnce they raised their overall stats, the human race wasn\u2019t that weak.Even so, Lee Hyunsung\u2019s mentality was very special in this world. A normal human couldn\u2019t be so nonchalant when encountering monsters.There was a reason why he got the name of Steel Sword in the future. However, the more amazing person was Jung Heewon.\u201cThe pattern is simpler than I thought?\u201dMaybe it was due to the Kendo skill but every time her sword stretched out, the ground rat was cut somewhere on their legs or tail.\u201cHap!\u201dIt was a case where Jung Heewon invested most of her coins into strength. Her endurance declined due to it but the power of one blow was better than I thought.Hwiik!Her sword moved in a terrifying manner through the air.\u201cDamn, I lost one! Please!\u201dHer voice trembled as she spoke. Her only weakness was that her stamina was low so her endurance fell.Grrr!The ground rats who moved between the party members were moderately smart. After succeeding in scattering the ranks, they ran towards the opponent who seemed the weakest using a hunter\u2019s instincts.\u201cLeave it to me.\u201dHowever, the ground rats didn\u2019t know that they had picked the wrong opponent.Peeok!A blunt instrument thrown by Lee Gilyoung\u2019s hands struck the head of a ground rat. The impact was lacking because he was a child but it was enough. The others could help him finish it.Puok!Yoo Sangah\u2019s spear pierced the body of the ground rat. The ground rat twisted several times. Yoo Sangah made a confused expression but she didn\u2019t remove her hand from the spear.The ground rat lost its energy and fell down.I honestly thought it would be difficult for Yoo Sangah to adapt but I was really surprised. Usually, it was normal to panic like Han Myungoh standing over here.\u201cU-Uhhhh\u2026\u201dAs the people were struggling, one person was hiding in the rear. He couldn\u2019t even hide properly and was bleeding near the shins.I pierced the last ground rat with the thorn and the surroundings became quiet.I shook the blood off the thorn and looked at everyone. Everyone suffered from minor abrasions except for Han Myungoh, but there were no major injuries.It was a great first victory.Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung relaxed and sat down, while Lee Hyunsung stabbed his spear into the ground and wiped at the sweat on his forehead. Jung Heewon lamented as she countered the number of ground rats in the vicinity.\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi, how many did you take care of?\u201d\u201cFour of them.\u201d\u201cChe, I killed two.\u201d\u201cI got three.\u201dMy pride was somehow hurt when I heard Lee Hyunsung\u2019s proud declaration. There was only one difference despite my stats. I used a skill and looked at Lee Hyunsung\u2019s attributes window.+[Character Information]Name: Lee HyunsungAge: 28 years old.Constellation Sponsor: Master of Steel.Private Attribute: Soldier who Turned a Blind Eye to Injustice (General)Exclusive Skills: Bayonet Skills Lv. 2, Camouflage Lv. 1, Patience Lv. 1, Sense of Justice Lv. 1, Weapons Training Lv. 2.Stigma: Great Mountain Push Lv. 1Overall Stats: Stamina Lv. 12, Strength Lv. 9, Agility Lv. 9, Magic Power Lv. 6.Overall Evaluation: The moment of the attribute evolution is gradually approaching.

The Master of Steel seemed to quite like Lee Hyunsung.The Starter Pack was a coin package that could be used when the average overall stats of the incarnation was less than level 10.It was a good item that allowed you to learn Weapons Training, a useful skill in the beginning, while raising the level of the overall stats by one.Considering the fact that most incarnations were being exploited for nothing, Lee Hyunsung was lucky to receive the Starter Pack.\u201cDokja-ssi, your complexion doesn\u2019t look good\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, no. I was just thinking for a moment.\u201dNow I was a little bit envious\u2026well, I had the money to buy it. I didn\u2019t buy it. My average stats exceeded level 10 so buying it would only damage me.Damn, I opened the Dokkaebi Bag a bit early.\u201cLet\u2019s gather up the ground rats. We need to prepare today\u2019s food.\u201d\u201cUmmm\u2026by the way, how will we cook it? We can\u2019t eat it like this.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t eat it now but there will be a way.\u201dI guessed I answered too calmly. There was silence among my party members. Lee Hyunsung was the first one to open his mouth.\u201cExcuse me, I would like to ask you one thing.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi, perhaps\u2026do you know something about this situation?\u201dWhoops, I made a mistake.\u201cThat\u2026\u201dSuddenly, I remembered the regressors in the novel I read, followed by Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s words.It was like this. The feeling of a regressor. Usually, these types of things happened to a regressor.Some replies came to mind. I could shamelessly say that it was a hunch or I could lie like Yoo Jonghyuk.[The constellation Secretive Plotter is anticipating your choice.][A few constellations are anticipating your answer.]But from a reader\u2019s point of view, the best answer was\u2026\u201cA-Aaaack!\u201dIt was to create a situation where I didn\u2019t need to say anything.[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 nods at your choice.]\u201cThere is still one left!\u201dJung Heewon shouted and Lee Hyunsung ran. However, the action of the hidden ground rats was faster than anyone else. It was much bigger than the other creatures.\u201cS-Save me\u2026!\u201dIt dragged Han Myungoh into a tunnel by one of his legs. The nearest Yoo Sangah swung her spear but the situation got worse because Han Myungoh held onto her.\u201cGrab this!\u201dLee Hyunsung stretched out the handle of his spear but it only hit the ground. The ground rat and the two people had already disappeared into the ground.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 resents this frustrating person.]Jung Heewon burst out.\u201cAh\u2026I knew I was going to get cancer because of that uncle.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I was too late.\u201dLee Hyunsung spoke in a sad voice. I tapped his shoulder to show it was okay.\u201cNo one could\u2019ve done anything.\u201d\u201cShould we chase after them?\u201dI looked at the hole where they had disappeared. It wasn\u2019t an ordinary hole. There was a touch of energy around it. The darkness gave off a gloomy feeling.I retreated to the back and turned on my smartphone. There was only 5% battery remaining. At dawn, I exchanged one battery charge for food with a person from the marginalized group.[Your reading speed has increased due to the effect of the exclusive attribute.]Shortly afterwards, I was able to find the desired passage.\u300c \u2026The \u2018Edge of Darkness\u2019 is the habitat of the ground rats and is a type of subspace emitted from the \u2018Dark Root.\u2019 The ground rats that breath in black ether instead of oxygen don\u2019t grow naturally unless they are near the \u2018Edge of Darkness\u2019\u2026 \u300dIt was a fact that I knew roughly but it was meaningful to review it. That\u2019s right. This was the entrance to the Edge of Darkness. I read about it and put the smartphone in my pocket.\u201cDokja-ssi?\u201dLee Hyunsung was looking at me with a frustrated expression. I nodded.\u201cWe will enter.\u201d\u201cAh, then\u2026\u201d\u201cBut it very dangerous to enter with a lot of people. Lee Hyunsung-ssi and Jung Heewon-ssi will wait here at the boundary. If something happens, I will give you a signal.\u201dThe startled Jung Heewon asked.\u201cSurely\u2026you don\u2019t intend to go with only Gilyoung?\u201d\u201cGilyoung\u2019s ability will be helpful in pursuing them.\u201dThe moment she tried to strongly resist, I raised a hand and called to Lee Hyunsung.\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi. Jung Heewon-ssi isn\u2019t in a good condition so please take care of her.\u201dLee Hyunsung seemed to realize something.\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cWait a minute. I am fine!\u201d\u201cJung Heewon, confidence is good but don\u2019t be reckless.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s breathing was uneven. She wasn\u2019t completely healed from the poisonous fog.I left the two people and entered the hole with Lee Gilyoung. It was obviously a hole that was dug down in a vertical slope. But as soon as we entered, we could stand as if gravity was in effect.It was due to the magic power emitted by the Edge of Darkness.\u201cThis way.\u201dThe darkness was so deep that I couldn\u2019t see anything, so I could only move forward with Lee Gilyoung. Black ether had the property of absorbing light, making a flashlight meaningless. If Lee Gilyoung\u2019s ability Diverse Communication wasn\u2019t available, I might have to use coins again.\u201cExcuse me Hyung.\u201dLee Gilyoung called out to me.\u201cDid you do it on purpose?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cWhen that uncle grabbed Noona and Ahjussi, you let it go.\u201dI had a moment of hesitation. In the darkness, Lee Gilyoung\u2019s fingertips were strange. Before I could ask how he knew, Lee Gilyoung spoke.\u201cAt that time, I was looking at Hyung\u2019s face.\u201dHe was watching me even in those short moments. A very scary kid. It was no good hiding from a person who was so quick.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dThe answer was terrible and a message bomb was set off in my head. Indeed, this was a spectacle for the constellations.[The constellations of absolute good frown at your cruelty.][The constellation Secretive Plotter is pressing you with shining eyes.]\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d\u201cBecause of the habit of the ground rats.\u201dI decided to answer honestly.\u201cThe ground rats have a habit of keeping their catches in the same place as their treasure. It isn\u2019t just food. Many things that seem rare are gathered. For example, an item. However, the paths are so complicated that it can\u2019t be found unless I follow their path directly.\u201dLee Gilyoung was silent for a moment. I continued speaking.\u201cI expected them to take Han Myungoh. I didn\u2019t expect him to grab onto Yoo Sangah.\u201d\u201cThen your purpose isn\u2019t to save Noona or Ahjussi, it is the items?\u201d\u201cYes. Are you disappointed?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201dLee Gilyoung\u2019s small hand gripped my finger tightly.\u201cHyung shouldn\u2019t lie.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf Hyung was such a person, you wouldn\u2019t have saved me on the subway. I believe in you.\u201dLee Gilyoung didn\u2019t act like a child but he was still a child. Lee Gilyoung didn\u2019t know. To be mature and to be an adult were completely different things.[Some constellations are touched to tears.][200 coins have been sponsored.]In this world, there were mean adults who would take advantage of such maturity. The hole was longer than I thought and we had to go downwards for quite a long time.\u201cHyung.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHyung, are you a god?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cOr the main character?\u201dChildren sometimes asked sharp questions. It was because they lived in a world where stories and reality weren\u2019t clearly distinguished. Lee Gilyoung didn\u2019t know exactly what his question meant.\u201cI\u2019m not a main character. Rather, I always envy the main character.\u201d\u201cBut you still know something about this world?\u201dI thought for a moment before replying.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll ask you one thing.\u201d\u201cI will answer it if I can.\u201d\u201cOnce we clear all these scenarios\u2026can we make a wish?\u201d\u201cWish?\u201dI was a bit confused.\u201cUsually there is a reward at the end of these stories. At the end of this story, is there something like that?\u201dIn the darkness, Lee Gilyoung\u2019s breathing was trembling. Lee Gilyoung\u2019s expression when he saw his dead mother suddenly came to mind.Those who adapted to this world suffered from it in different ways. Some were crazy, some were fanatics and some had irrational optimism.\u201cYes, there is.\u201dI was grateful that this place was dark. It was because Lee Gilyoung couldn\u2019t see my face right now.\u201cWe are almost there Hyung.\u201dThe surrounding black ether was shrinking rapidly. It was evidence that Dark Root was nearby. I tensed up and gripped the thorn.[A few constellations are holding their breaths.]I heard the sound of the ground rats somewhere in the ground. As the sound got closer, the sense of space expanded rapidly. I saw a light in the darkness, as if someone had lit a fire.Then I saw a tattered box beyond that light. The moment I was convinced that I had come to the right place, messages rang in my ears.[The sub scenario has been updated.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[You have entered the \u2018Ground Rat\u2019s Treasure Trove.\u2019]TL Note: Some of Lee Hyunsung\u2019s skill levels are less than the first time his attribute window was checked.

This\u2026\u201dRight after Lee Gilyoung discovered the treasure box, I blocked his little mouth.\u201cShh, wait.\u201dThe world of Ways of Survival was relentless. The constellations enjoyed the adversity of the characters and added obstacles in the scenarios just to fuck with humans.Things saying \u2018Catch me!\u2019 usually contained traps and even system messages couldn\u2019t be trusted.\u201cThe treasure trove doesn\u2019t just contain treasures.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 is disappointed.]Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2026 He had wanted me to die for a while.Anyway, I waited. Shortly afterwards, shadows started to emerge around the treasure chest.Grrr\u2026It was the ground rats. They brought something through the tunnel, threw it and exchanged information.Hwaruruk.Once a certain number of ground rats gathered, the number of lights illuminating the surroundings increased. It was black fire, flames made with black ether.It was said that this place was the core of Dark Root, which was why it had so much black ether to burn. At that time, someone\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cIt is all because of Yoo Sangah-ssi!\u201dThere was no need to say who he was. It was a voice I would know at once. I gripped the shoulder of the surprised Lee Gilyoung tightly. It wasn\u2019t time yet.\u201cBecause of me, what do you mean by that?\u201dIn the dim light, there were two people captured by the ground rats. They were tied up tightly by branches that came up from the ground.\u201cI-If Yoo Sangah hadn\u2019t taken the subway, the situation wouldn\u2019t be like this!\u201d\u201cWhy does the subway matter now?\u201dHow could she accept all this nonsense? Maybe Yoo Sangah was a saintly person. Or maybe the sponsor behind her was a saintly person.\u201cT-That\u2026That, Yoo Sangah-ssi, you ride a bicycle all the time\u2026\u201dHan Myungoh\u2019s voice shook as he wrote gibberish.Yoo Sangah\u2019s tone was cold. \u201cWait a minute. Were you the one who stole my bike?\u201d\u201cW-What is this person? I clearly told you that I would drive you in my car! You should know how to accept favours!\u201d\u201cAnswer me. Did you steal my bike?\u201dAll of a sudden, the situation made sense. This was it. It was why a person who drove a Mercedes-Benz S class took the subway line 3.Well, it wasn\u2019t strange. There were quite a few men who had their eyes on Yoo Sangah, not just at the company but at Gumho Station as well.In fact, Yoo Sangah was a worthy person. Her atmosphere was warm and she knew how to flatter people.[The constellation Demon-like Judge of Fire hates the character \u2018Han Myungoh.\u2019]Han Myungoh\u2019s face was so red that it could clearly be seen in the dim lighting. It looked dangerous.\u201cYes, shit! I did it! So what?\u201d\u201cWhy are you talking like it isn\u2019t a big deal? You took someone else\u2019s things, it is theft.\u201d\u201cTheft?

I quietly gripped the thorn.\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you just one thing. I continuously asked to take you home but you kept fucking rejecting me\u2026\u201dI threw the thorn as hard as I could. The thorn scratched the corner of Han Myungoh\u2019s mouth and continued into the darkness.\u201cUwaaaaack!

There was no way it wouldn\u2019t be in Dark Root.[\u2018Dark Keeper\u2019 could appear!][The sub scenario has been updated!][Sub scenario \u2018Kill the Guard\u2019 has begun!]Like slaves surrendering to a king, the terrified ground rats fell to the ground. A dark figure appeared in the dim light. A tentacled monster reminiscent of a god of death.Lee Gilyoung\u2019s complexion deteriorated sharply.\u201cOof, Hyung, that\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is okay.\u201dEventually, Lee Gilyoung fell to the ground and started retching. It wasn\u2019t strange.A lot of pressure was felt just looking at it from afar. The cockroaches crawling around long had their stomachs exploded. Lee Gilyoung, who was connected to the cockroaches, would\u2019ve suffered considerable mental damage.\u201cGilyoung. How many more times can you use Diverse Communication?\u201d\u201c\u2026I think I can do it one or two more times.\u201d\u201cI understand. Then rest here for a while.\u201dI left Gilyoung leaning against the side and approached Yoo Sangah and Han Myungoh. The panicked Han Myungoh was struggling.\u201cO-Ohuk! What is this\u2026?\u201dI took the Swiss knife and cut the branches binding the two of them. I only moved the knife a few times. Then the part of the branch that it touched abruptly corroded and the blade melted away. Yes, this was the power of a demonic species.\u201cStay back.\u201dI said while raising a weapon made of the spine of a ground rat.The grade 7 demon type species, Dark Keeper. Among the many monsters that appeared since the start of the destruction, the demon species were toxic.In fact, the treasures of the ground rats were close to \u2018tributes\u2019 to the demon. Even if it was the same grade, the demon species were different from other monster species.[The dark keeper has received the favour of the demon king it follows.]\u201cKamyun. Der. Yitur.\u201dThe demon species had their own language, worshipped different demon kings and inherited some of the power of the demon king through Dark Root.[The Dark Keeper has emitted \u2018Fear.\u2019][The exclusive skill Fourth Wall has neutralized most of the \u2018Fear\u2019 effect.]Therefore, killing one demon meant becoming the adversary of their demon king.\u201cYitur!\u201dI didn\u2019t know what it was saying but the situation didn\u2019t look good. I didn\u2019t want to fight if possible.\u201cM-Mother?\u201dYoo Sangah. She still hadn\u2019t left?\u201cI told you to stay back.\u201d\u201cThat monster just said \u2018Mother\u2019\u2026\u201dI thought for a moment about what this meant. No, wait a minute.\u201cUhh, I think\u2026K-Karud, yemiren? Ah, this is the pronunciation? Aketu?\u201dFor a moment, I thought I was mistaken. But I didn\u2019t hear wrong.\u201cKallitu!\u201dSurprisingly, the dark keeper nodded at the end.[The character \u2018Yoo Sangah\u2019 has activated the \u2018Interpreter Lv. 3 skill.]\u2026Oh my god, she wasn\u2019t only good at Spanish. Let\u2019s see what would happen.\u201cWhat is he saying?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026it keeps saying \u2018become Mother\u2019\u2026\u201d\u2026Become mother? The dark keeper cried out again and pointed to Yoo Sangah.\u201cKallitu!\u201dYoo Sangah had a tearful face.\u201cUh, Mother? I\u2019m not married yet!\u201dThe dark keeper pointed at Han Myungoh this time.\u201cKallitu!\u201dHan Myungoh turned pale as he wiped his mouth.\u201cW-Why am I the mother? Father!\u201dThe dark keeper\u2019s tentacles rose.Pushu!\u201cOoooof!\u201dOne of the tentacles entered his mouth and Han Myungoh turned black. There was the sound of something moving down Han Myungoh\u2019s throat.That\u2019s right. This was what it meant to become the mother. I belatedly recalled that the demon species conceived their young in the body of other species.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, you don\u2019t plan to have a child yet, right?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dYoo Sangah immediately understood the words and stepped back quickly. I swung the ground rat spear and tore at the tentacles attached to Han Myungoh.The dark keeper roared angrily.\u201cKallituo!\u201dFushu!\u00a0Teong!The tentacles of the demon species were gradually breaking the ground rat spear. Even the stone hog thorn, which broke through the stomach of an ichthyosaur, would\u2019ve been destroyed the moment it was stuck in a demon\u2019s body.Before I knew it, Han Myungoh was far away while Yoo Sangah looked at me.\u300c Is there a chance? \u300dHer eyes seemed to be asking me. To tell the truth, I didn\u2019t have a chance.Pushu!\u00a0Pushuu!\u00a0Teong!After a few strikes, the ground rat spear was almost destroyed. The hand holding the spear was in pain.The monster guarding the treasure chest couldn\u2019t be caught, just like the ichthyosaur of Dongho Bridge. That\u2019s why the original plan wasn\u2019t to deal with this monster but to obtain the treasure chest after it disappeared.But as always, plans existed for things to go wrong.\u201cDokkaebi. Are you watching?\u201d[U-Uh. You knew?]The dokkaebi showed up in the darkness. I didn\u2019t know his name but he seemed to be a cousin of Bihyung.\u201cThere should be some mail for me by now. I want you to hand it over quickly.\u201d[Hihit. It isn\u2019t my responsibility. I-It is Bihyung\u2019s thing.]\u201cRight now, you are taking Bihyung\u2019s place.

I think it will be interesting!]The dokkaebi muttered something and the summoning began.[The item has arrived from the exchange.][The item \u2018Broken Faith\u2019 has been acquired.][The brokerage fee was exempted due to the effect of the contract.]Broken Faith. The item bartered for the \u2018ichthyosaur core\u2019, which was registered on the Dokkaebi Bag\u2019 exchange, had finally arrived.\u201cKik.\u201dThe dark keeper saw the item coming out of thin air and laughed. No wonder it was laughing. All I received was a D grade item. It was a knife broken in half.[The item is too old to use. The durability will be poor and it will be difficult to achieve any performance.]Even the dokkaebi who gave him the item was giggling.[H-How can you fight with that old thing? And it can\u2019t be used if you don\u2019t have a special skill\u2026]I knew that much. I wouldn\u2019t have bought it if I didn\u2019t know.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dI sucked in a breath and concentrated my mind.Kiiing!The hilt started trembling greatly. Biryu shouted with shock.[Uh? How?]It was natural to be surprised. It was because this was a skill I bought from his friend for a huge 10,000 coins. Blue ether started to settle slowly on the surface of the broken blade.[White Pure Star Energy]After killing the ichthyosaur, I bought this skill from Bihyung. There were a few flaws compared to other superior energy techniques, but they weren\u2019t something that could be obtained for the time being.[Broken Faith has responded to your star energy!][Blade of Faith is activated!]Shortly afterwards, a brilliant white virtual blade sprang up from the edge of the broken blade.Broken Faith. Its real performance was revealed when star energy was injected into it.Pushuuk!The number of tentacles increased by dozens and covered my field of view. I wouldn\u2019t be safe from these attacks with my current stamina level. It was scary. But now there was a chance.Kiiing!It was because the Blade of Faith was the best quality weapon when it came to demon species.Pachuchuchuchut!The tentacles touched by the blade were oxidized and cut off. The dark keeper let out a terrible scream as its tentacles were destroyed. I felt magic power draining out but I wasn\u2019t in a hurry.Sukakak!I calmly moved the blade.I missed the tentacles many times because he didn\u2019t have the \u2018Fighting Senses\u2019 skill and I didn\u2019t have the Swordsmanship Training skill, so the way I wielded the blade was terrible. It was natural. I was a reader, not a swordsman.And a reader fought in the manner of a reader.[The attribute effect has improved your memories of the pages already read.]The pages of Ways of Destruction flashed in my head.\u300c\u2026The dark keeper\u2019s attack pattern is simple.

The young boy looked at me with awed eyes. Unfortunately, unlike his wishes, I wasn\u2019t the main character in this world. But I was confident of at least one thing.\u201cKar. Mien. Der.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe dark keeper muttered as it barely managed to pull itself together from its shock. I didn\u2019t ask but Yoo Sangah muttered from behind me in a quivering voice.\u201cHow do you know all my weaknesses\u2026?\u201dThis was what it meant.

Now he knew what he had done.[The grade 7 demon \u2018dark keeper\u2019 has been killed and the demon king \u2018Asmodeus\u2019 has noticed the murderer\u2019s presence.[The demon king Asmodeus will chase the one who dealt the finishing blow until they are dead.][The demon king Asmodeus has put a terrible curse on the person who dealt the final blow!][Final Blow:\u00a0 Han Myungoh]\u201cW-What? What is this message?\u201dHan Myungoh cried out fearfully.[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 admires your wickedness.]\u201cAh\u2026didn\u2019t I tell you? I intentionally didn\u2019t kill it.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 has recommended your scenario to Star Stream.]Han Myungoh stared into the air like he had lost his soul.The curse of the demon king \u2018Asmodeus\u2019 was the most terrible thing for a killer. I didn\u2019t know what it was but it was surely terrible.I looked back and saw Lee Gilyoung and Yoo Sangah looking this way with bemused expressions. I smiled as if nothing had happened.\u201cWe\u2019ll open the rewards together.\u201d*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *After a while, we searched through the treasures and pulled out one each.\u201cI got this.\u201d\u201cI have this\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung found a small bracelet and old shield respectively.[Magic Power Recovery Bracelet][Old Iron Shield]They were both D grade items but it was better than nothing. The Magic Power Recovery Bracelet was a useful item for everyone and the Old Iron Shield would be good for Lee Hyunsung.It was difficult to ignore the \u2018iron\u2019 in the name. This iron was much harder than Earth\u2019s iron.Yoo Sangah spoke with slight disappointment.\u201cIt is less than I thought.\u201dLess. Her words weren\u2019t wrong. It was too shameful to call this a \u2018treasure trove.\u2019Yoo Jonghyuk.The guy who left yesterday had probably gone through this place. He knew he would be tired fighting the demon so he took a chance and stole the treasure.In the end, we were robbing a place that was already robbed.\u201cit is okay because the main thing is still left.\u201dI looked at a black box in the centre of the warehouse. We didn\u2019t waste any more time and opened the box.The thing in the box was a stove. It was small enough to fit into a pocket and it was shameful to call it a stove.[Magic Power Stove].As expected, it was still here. This item was in fact the key item in this sub scenario.[Magic Power Stove can only be used once per person.]Obviously, Yoo Jonghyuk had taken one so there were two Magic Power Stoves in total.\u201c\u2026What is that thing?\u201d\u201cWell, I think I know a bit about its purpose.\u201dI purposely trembled, activated the stove with magic power and raised a dead ground rat\u2019s leg.It was funny since it didn\u2019t fit the size of a plate of food, but in five seconds, a remarkable change happened to the leg of the ground rat.\u201cWow! A delicious smell!\u201dThere was a sweet smell and the leg of the ground rat changed to a golden colour.\u201cMeat!\u201dLee Gilyoung cried out excitedly. Yoo Sangah asked urgently.\u201cC-Can we eat this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try it first.\u201dI grabbed the greasy hind leg and dug into the flesh. The juices ran from the flesh\u2026I forgot to chew and closed my eyes. Tasting it was different from reading it in the book.[A few constellations are drooling.][The constellations have sponsored you 100 coins.][The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 has swallowed his saliva.][The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is biting his nails.]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.The messages continuously popped up. Indeed, eating broadcasts were the best. Everyone was united in front of food.\u201cEat it. I think it is okay.\u201dThe two people rushed towards the meat as soon as I spoke. They hadn\u2019t had a proper meal for three days so they would be quite hungry. Han Myungoh recovered and came over hesitantly.\u201cD-Dokja-ssi\u2026I-I went crazy for a second\u2026\u201d\u201cEat. Don\u2019t worry about the other thing.\u201d\u201cT-Thank you!\u201d\u201cYou will become a ghost after eating.\u201d\u201cW-What\u2026?\u201dHan Myungoh\u2019s complexion turned as white as death. I said it like a joke but Han Myungoh really would die. Asmodeus\u2019 pursuit was hard for even Yoo Jonghyuk to overcome.We each took one leg and started to eat. We were eating meat together because we were hungry after everything that started. Humans couldn\u2019t help it.Everyone ate the meal in silence. Was it due to the light spreading gently from the Magic Power Stove? I was feeling a bit sentimental.Killing something and eating it in order to live. This was the life of a human. It had been like this so far but I wondered why it felt so fresh.Suddenly, I looked up and met Yoo Sangah\u2019s eyes. Ha, Yoo Sangah came to her senses and suddenly cried out.\u201cI\u2019m pathetic.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi worked so hard and I am just eating like a pig\u2026 I was no help at all\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, Yoo Sangah-ssi. That\u2026\u201d\u201cBut how does Dokja-ssi know all this? You know how to cook a beast and\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201d\u201cIndeed! It must be because you read fantasy novels, right? Really, I didn\u2019t know the world was going to be like this. My silly self was just memorizing Spanish.\u201dI felt somewhat strange when I heard Yoo Sangah say this. I opened my mouth to comfort her.\u201cIt is because Yoo Sangah-ssi studied foreign languages that you learned the language of the demon species.\u201dOf course, it wasn\u2019t very helpful.\u201cI see\u2026 Thank you, Dokja-ssi\u2026\u201dI smiled at Yoo Sangah and got up from where I was sitting. The party was immersed in eating again. I took a break and headed for the back of the party.In fact, the Magic Power Stove was important but my real purpose was a separate item. I looked closely at the \u2018black box\u2019 that contained the Magic Power Stove. It was this. There was no doubt about it.Yoo Jonghyuk, who took the Magic Power Stove, probably didn\u2019t know about it. The real treasure of the warehouse was this \u2018black box.\u2019In the original story, Yoo Jonghyuk only knew about this after the 6th round of regression.Who was the first to discover this. Was it \u2018Heavenly Maid Hori?\u2019 Well, it was hard to remember. It wasn\u2019t accurate but it was probably something like this:\u300c \u201cOver there. There are strange boxes in the early areas. If you put something in there\u2026\u201d \u300dAt this time, I met Yoo Sangah\u2019s eyes.\u201cWhat is the box for?\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah, this\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah said as she looked at the box. There were unknown characters written on the box.\u2026Could she read them?\u201cRandom\u2026item box?\u201dDamn. This was why foreign language proficiency was important.\u201cUh\u2026that\u2026um. So that is what it means.\u201dI was a bit embarrassed. Yoo Sangah cried out.\u201cQuickly use it, Dojka-ssi!\u201d\u201c\u2026Is it okay?\u201dNod nod.\u00a0Lee Gilyoung nodded vigorously.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about us. All the items obtained here are yours. That is obvious.\u201dYes, I was caught so let\u2019s do it quickly.\u201cThen I will use it well.\u201d[A few constellations are nodding at your decision.]I took the nucleus of the grade 7 demon from my pocket. I had cut it from the dead body of the dark keeper. In addition, I took out Broken Faith which had run out of durability. According to the original plot, the use of this box was simple.\u300c \u201cWho knew? There would be a limited edition coin item.\u201d \u300dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euI placed the demon core and Broken Faith into the box.\u300c \u201cHa, you can\u2019t believe me words? Is it real? Put sub items in there and close the box!\u201d \u300dIn fact, I didn\u2019t know what would happen when I put in these two items. But I was certain that something huge would come out.\u300c \u201cA top item will unconditionally come out!\u201d \u300dA moment later, a dazzling light burst out from the closed box.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a product that was forced to be banned by the Star Stream Administration Bureau.If sub items were put it, it would \u2018unconditionally\u2019 spit out a top item. This would have a tremendous impact on the balance of the scenarios. In addition, the price of one item box was a huge one million coins.The constellations were angry at this ridiculous billing policy and the stupid dokkaebi who invented this item was fired from the Administration Bureau.[C-Constellations. It is like this\u2026 I don\u2019t know why it is here\u2026H-Hihihit! Broadcast end!][#BI-7623 channel has temporarily closed.]The delirious sounding Biryu closed the channel and the voices of the constellations disappeared. I regretted not being able to see the reactions of the constellations but it couldn\u2019t be helped.Dudududu.I looked down at the vibrating box. The random draw was about to start in earnest.[A sword type item will be awarded for putting in the same type of items!][The random draw has started!]The limited edition random item box randomly spat out items of a higher rank related to the item you put in. There was a chance for anything from a C grade to a SSS grade item to come out. In the end, it was all up to chance.[The offered items are related to a certain constellation!][The probability that an item associated with this constellation will appear is greatly increased.]\u2026Eh?It was an unexpected message. But it didn\u2019t seem to be a disadvantage for me. Both my hands were sweating. I hadn\u2019t been so nervous when I bought a random chance item in an online game. Please let it be an A rating.[A top rated item has appeared!][The number of available random item boxes is 0.]The box soon stopped trembling and the faint light subsided. I looked around at Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung, whose eyes were shining.\u201cShall we open it?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWe opened the box.\u201cW-Wow!\u201dLee Gilyoung was so surprised that he screamed. By the way, it really was amazing. A luxurious silver guard and a white blade\u2026the shape was somewhat similar to Broken Faith?I immediately checked the item information.+[Item Information]Name: Unbroken FaithRating: Star RelicDescription: In the past, it was the sword of the hero \u2018Kaizenix\u2019, who led the Grusiad during the Great Demon Age. The great ether dominance of Kaizenix allowed him to create a \u2018Blade of Faith\u2019 that contained fire, darkness and divine power respectively.As an additional option, it increases strength and stamina level by 2.+I was speechless. No\u2026was this real? It wasn\u2019t a simple alphabet rating but a star relic item?\u201cD-Dokja-ssi! Doesn\u2019t it look like a huge item?\u201dIt really was a huge item.In the world of Ways of Survival, the \u2018star relics\u2019 were the only items excluded from the ratings table. It wasn\u2019t just because they had a strong performance but because these items were special.Every star relic contained the power of a living constellation.The difference in performance varied depending on whether the constellation was the hero of a certain world and how much awareness they had. However, they contained the power of a constellation so the relics had tremendous value.In addition, it raised the level of his strength and stamina by 2. When taking into account that A grade items increased the total stats value by 1, it must be at least a S grade item.Yoo Jonghyuk hadn\u2019t obtained an item like this yet.I looked around at Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung.\u201c\u2026I can really have it?\u201d\u201cOf course. It naturally belongs to Dokja-ssi.\u201dYoo Sangah responded in advance to his repeat question. Lee Gilyoung also nodded eagerly.I looked at Han Myungoh but he was just eating the leg of a ground rat with a stupid expression. He was muttering unknown things to himself. I thought he would insist on having the item\u2026it was strange.[You have acquired a star relic.][The owner of the star relic is curious about you.]The message showed that the constellation existed somewhere. Later, I would open up Ways of Destruction and look for it.\u201cThen we should go back. There are plenty of ground rats out there so we can go back with just the Magic Power Stove.\u201d\u201cBut how do we get back?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be a problem to leave with Gilyoung\u2019s power. Use Diverse Communication and\u2026\u201dHowever, Lee Gilyoung\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t bright.\u201cHyung, I\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t any insects nearby.\u201dCome to think of it, the insects around here had burst from the pressure when I was fighting the dark keeper. It was a problem I hadn\u2019t thought about.\u201cThere really isn\u2019t one? Some of them should still be alive. If we move for a bit and use the ability\u2026\u201dThere were so many insects in the world that I didn\u2019t have any sympathy for the few who died. But Lee Gilyoung still had a dark expression.\u201cWell, there is one I can actually call\u2026\u201d Lee Gilyoung closed his eyes and started concentrating.\u201cDokja-ssi, isn\u2019t this a big strange?\u201dLee Gilyoung\u2019s eyes were gradually losing focus. Then blood flowed down from his nose.\u201cGilyoung?\u201dAll of a sudden, there was a loud vibration from above them. Dust started falling down. The vibration was coming from above ground\u2026At this moment, goosebumps appeared on my skin.Kuuong!\u201cGilyoung! Lee Gilyoung! Wake up!\u201d\u201cYe\u2026Hyung?\u201dLee Gilyoung\u2019s eyes returned to normal.\u201cGilyoung, stop the skill! Quickly!\u201dThe surprised Lee Gilyoung stopped the skill and the vibration subsided. I sighed with relief.There were incredibly dangerous monsters running around above ground. There were numerous high rated monsters, including the grade 7 rhinoceros. Among these monsters was the insect king. It was obvious a type of insect just based on the name.\u201cYou really\u2026\u201dI placed my hand on Lee Gilyoung\u2019s head and didn\u2019t say anything. He was about to call an insect king from aboveground\u2026 was he Fabre? We almost got buried here.\u201cFor the time being, seal this skill. Don\u2019t use it unless I tell you to. Understood?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dLee Gilyoung replied in a sad manner. Now there was no choice but to wait.\u201cWe will get lost in the darkness. Let\u2019s wait a bit longer and move when small insects appear in the vicinity.\u201dIt was easy to enter but the Edge of Darkness was a very dangerous place. It was a place where someone could disappear for a day or two if a little mistake was made.Then Yoo Sangah raised her hand.\u201cIf it is just going back, I think I can fill in for Gilyoung.\u201d\u201c\u2026How?\u201dI was going to ask if she would converse with the Edge of Darkness but stopped because it seemed sarcastic. Yoo Sangah replied in a slightly uncertain tone.\u201cI have a similar skill.\u201dWhen I thought about it, I still didn\u2019t know Yoo Sangah\u2019s attribute and sponsor.\u201cWhat is the skill?\u201d\u201cThat, it is a complicated skill to untangle\u2026\u201dUntangle?\u201c\u2026Excuse me, can I ask what Yoo Sangah-ssi\u2019s attribute is?\u201dYoo Sangah wasn\u2019t a character in the novel so I didn\u2019t know her attribute. It was like Lee Gilyoung and Han Myungoh.\u201cUh, that\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah made a difficult expression. It wouldn\u2019t have been so frustrating if I could use Character List on Yoo Sangah. I tried to use Character List once again as a test.[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.][This person isn\u2019t registered in \u2018Character List.\u2019]Indeed\u2026 But there was one more message.[Currently collecting information about the corresponding figure.]\u2026Eh?It was a message that never existed before. Come to think of it, I heard a system message when Yoo Sangah used the \u2018Interpreter\u2019 skill. It wasn\u2019t something that was originally heard.Was it possible for the Character List to be updated after some time? Perhaps\u2026I organized my thoughts and decided to let Yoo Sangah go.\u201cForget that I asked. By the way, nice work. In the future, don\u2019t let other people know about your personal attribute.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it! I trust Dojka-ssi\u2026!\u201dWell, Yoo Sangah\u2019s appearance said otherwise. At the moment, I got an idea.\u201cCan Yoo Sangah tell me about the nature of your sponsor?\u201dYoo Sangah bowed her head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe words barely escaped from her trembling lips. Based on this level, it was possible that she made some type of promise in the contract with her sponsor. Perhaps there was a life constraint in respect with the spilling of information.I didn\u2019t know what sponsor they were but it seemed they had decided to raise Yoo Sangah in earnest.\u201cIt is okay. I understand.\u201d\u201cThank you, really\u2026\u201dThere was no need to thank me. She couldn\u2019t tell me her sponsor\u2026it made my heart tense. It was the desire of a reader who wanted to fill the space between empty lines.\u201cThen try using your skill.\u201dSoon, a faintly shining thread emerged from Yoo Sangah\u2019s fingertips and started to stretch out.\u201cIn fact, I tied up a \u2018thread\u2019 when I got kidnapped.\u201dOne branch of the thread was connected to me and the other one was connected outside. Maybe it was bound to Lee Hyunsung or Jung Heewon.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThere was no reason for Yoo Sangah to have such a skill from the beginning. This was definitely the stigma provided by her sponsor.By the way, it was a \u2018thread\u2019 to escape the labyrinth. This\u2026somehow, I thought it was a constellation I knew.[#BI-7623 channel is open.]I started hearing messages from the constellations again.[A number of constellations have put a claim on the channel\u2019s transmission system!][The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 is curious about what came out of the random item box.]Ah, they haven\u2019t seen it? What a pity.[Damn! That bastard messed with my channel\u2026hahahat! Did you stay well while I was away?]And the nice\u2026no, a familiar voice was heard. Bihyung.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *[\u2026You did such great things while I was gone?]\u2018Was it because of me that you couldn\u2019t come back?\u2019[It\u2026yes, it isn\u2019t unrelated. I got a warning from the Administration Bureau because the advertisement went on for too long.]Now Bihyung\u2019s voice was only audible to me. It was the \u2018dokkaebi communication\u2019 that only the dokkaebi could use. Of course, it was an obvious violation of the rules to allow me to use it.[I have decided not to care about small things now. And I can go back and forth to the Administration Bureau. Rather\u2026 how do you know about the \u2018Random Box\u2019?]\u2018Just, I found it by chance.\u2019[Dammit. There are still remnants of the black history left.

Surely that absurd coin item wasn\u2019t planned by you?\u2019As a reader of Ways of Survival, I didn\u2019t know this.[Damn! If I wasn\u2019t greedy at that time\u2026]\u201cWow, it really is delicious. What a surprise.\u201dBihyung\u2019s grumbling was cut off by Jung Heewon\u2019s cry of admiration.10 minutes ago, we safely encountered the rest of the party thanks to Yoo Sangah\u2019s guidance. Fortunately, Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung kept the boundary until we came back.\u201cYou will recover a bit after eating.\u201d\u201cWell, I really think that my better is getting better.\u201dJung Heewon seemed much better as she swung her shoulders in a test. The meat of the underground species actually contained detoxification components.\u201cDid you get a lot of things in there? In addition to the Magic Power Stove\u2026\u201d\u201cI got a few things.\u201dI looked at Lee Hyunsung and said.Lee Hyunsung put on and removed the Old Steel Shield that he received from me several times. Now he was polishing the surface again and again. It was like someone with a new car.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 feels a faint loyalty to you.]Jung Heewon seemed envious of the scene and asked.\u201cIs there anything I can use?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhat is that blade?\u201d\u201cIt is mine.\u201d\u201c\u2026Will you distribute the meat to the people?\u201d\u201cIf they have coins.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026you are really stingy. Kim Dokja.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s say that I have a strong sense of survival.\u201dAs we were passing around a piece of cooked ground rat, the tunnel ended. The surroundings suddenly brightened and people started to be seen. But the atmosphere was weird. What was this urgent and bustling mood?[There are 20 minutes left until the paid settlement.][Prepare the survival fee.]I belatedly noticed the time. That\u2019s right. It was already that time.

Please, a few coins\u2026\u201d100 coins wouldn\u2019t be a problem if they faithfully participated in the scenario, but such humans were rare.\u201cI\u2019ll give you one million won, no, ten million won! Who will sell 100 coins?\u201dThe price of the coins was soaring. It was funny. There was a ridiculous premium on money that had no value until the beginning of the destruction.And there were people smiling as they watched from afar. These guys already had enough coins. It was Cheon Inho and the Cheoldoo Group.A few women flocked towards the gang members and cried out.\u201cY-You said you would give me 100 coins before!\u201d\u201cHrmm, is that so? I don\u2019t remember.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\u201cI will think again if you will let me put it in one more time. How about it?\u201dJung Heewon pulled out her blade and stared at them.\u201cThose sons of a bitches\u2026\u201d[The attribute of character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 is about to blossom.]The time had come for Jung Heewon. It wasn\u2019t bad if her attribute blossomed now\u2026yet.

Save me!\u201dThe expressions of the party changed. Lee Hyunsung bowed his head sadly while Jung Heewon bit her lip while holding her blade.Everyone knew what the price of the \u2018paid settlement\u2019 was. There was no one here who hadn\u2019t experienced it.\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi.\u201dThen Yoo Sangah looked at me.\u201cYes.\u201dIn this world, coins were power.

You are probably the richest one among us, right?\u201d[The character \u2018Cheon Inho\u2019 has activated the \u2018Incite Lv. 2\u2019 skill.The crowd looked my way.\u201cC-Coins?\u201d\u201cWho has a lot of coins?\u201dIt didn\u2019t take long for all eyes to turn to me. Cheon Inho, he was a really great guy.\u201cY-You are Dokja-ssi?\u201d\u201cPlease save me!\u201dPeople panted as they approached. The number of people flocking was estimated to be at least 20. If I gave all these people coins, I would lose 2,000 coins. But if I didn\u2019t give them coins, I would become a big villain of Gumho Station.[Your understanding of the character \u2018Cheon Inho\u2019 has increased.]\u201cHaha, Dokja-ssi. I don\u2019t have the coins to help all these poor people but\u2026isn\u2019t Dokja-ssi different? Will you just wait and watch?\u201dI sighed quietly. I had seen this trick one or twice.[The constellations of the Absolute Good system have defined Cheon Inho as \u2018wicked\u2019.]I had enough of putting up with him.\u201cS-Save me!\u201d\u201cPlease save me!\u201dPeople burst into tears with the most pitiful expression in the world.[Hahahat! This story is becoming fun. For reference, there are 10 minutes left!]Bihyung spoke in a voice that was full of joy and the party looked at me with strange expressions. I let out a short sigh and slowly closed my eyes before opening them again.\u201cI see. You want coins?\u201dThen I laughed.\u201cWhy should I?\u201dI looked around at the people. The first scenario was original sin. Thus, none of the people here were innocent.That made it more disgusting. Those who trampled on someone else to survive, who couldn\u2019t even bear responsibility for their own life.\u201cW-Why?\u201d\u201cYou have a lot of coins! Can\u2019t you give us a few?\u201dIn the midst of the confusion, Cheon Inho burst out laughing.\u201cI expected this from Dokja-ssi.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom the very first moment Dokja-ssi showed up here. Didn\u2019t you sell food for coins? If you didn\u2019t make them buy food at that time, do you know how many people can survive now?\u201d\u201cYes! He is right!\u201d\u201cShit! Give me back my coins!\u201dSuddenly the atmosphere was flowing against me. Maybe this was what Cheon Inho wanted.\u201cJust a minute everyone! Your actions right now\u2026!\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi isn\u2019t such a person!\u201dYoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung tried to diffuse the crowd but they had already lost their sense of reason. Then Cheon Inho drove in the last wedge.\u201cDokja-ssi. I will give you one last chance. Give the coins back to the people.\u201d\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d\u201cThen the worst will happen.\u201dThe crowd of 20 people started to approach step by step.\u201cT-This\u2026come! Give me your coins!\u201dNevertheless, no one attacked first. Eventually, a member of the Cheoldoo Group came forward.\u201cYou scum! What are you doing? Kill him! Why are you hesitating when you can snatch the coins after killing him?\u201dThe man who shouted had a very sturdy physique. I triggered Character List and confirmed his information.+[Character Summary]Name: Han MinsungPrivate Attribute: Bully (General)Overall Stats: Stamina Lv. 8, Strength Lv. 8, Agility Lv. 8, Magic Power Lv. 2.+He was the owner of abilities that fit a \u2018bully.\u2019 He wasn\u2019t originally at this level\u2026this guy did \u2018it.\u2019 Yes, he acted rashly because he believed in his stats.\u201cKill that bastard!\u201dThe metal pipe in his hand moved. A steel pipe containing a Lv. 8 strength. The former \u2018Kim Dokja\u2019 might be scared by this threat but\u2026 For the current me, it was just ridiculous.Sukak!The man\u2019s arm was cut off and rolled across the ground with the iron pipe.\u201cKuaaack!\u201dThe blood covered Unbroken Faith was emitting a white light. I swept a glance over the quiet people.\u201cU-Uh\u2026\u201dEveryone turned pale when they saw a Cheoldoo Group member being overwhelmed with one blow. Now that I had shown off a bit, it was time to start.\u201cPathetic\u2026 do you really believe this situation is because of me?\u201dI looked left and right at each face in the crowd. On the other side, Cheon Inho was looking confused.\u201cIn fact, you know very well that it isn\u2019t me.\u201dLike a sick goldfish, the mouths of the crowd dropped open. I spoke like I was disseminating food to them.\u201cYou guys are doing this because you are scared. In fact, even though you knew what was wrong and are in a crisis, you are trembling in fear because of them.\u201d\u201cHaha, look at this, Dokja-ssi! What are you saying\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt is because they are stronger than you! Their overall stats are higher than you and they have a lot of coins! But everyone, you know what?\u201dI took a step towards the crowd and asked. The entire crowd retreated like surprised goldfish. However, they were already in my fish tank.\u201cWhy are they stronger than you?\u201dI took one more step.\u201cMore than anything, why do they have more coins than you? Is it because they are gangsters? Perhaps.\u201d[The characters around you are shaken.]Even in fear, there were some emotions that could be conveyed with certainty. Questions passed over their faces.\u201cC-Cheon Inho-ssi, how many coins do you have\u2026?\u201d\u201cHaha, don\u2019t you know? Well, I have sold a few and\u2015\u201d\u201cDo you think it is possible to get that many stats with just that? Really?\u201dCheon Inho closed his mouth. I turned from left to right, looking at the crowd\u2019s faces one by one.\u201cWhen I came to Gumho Station a few days ago, there were 87 people here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut how many people are left now? I don\u2019t think there is more than 50 people. Do you know why?\u201d\u201cT-They went out as scouts and the monsters\u2015\u201d\u201cMonsters? Do you still believe that?\u201d\u201cT-Then\u2026\u201d\u201cYou fools. Think about it with your brains. Did those people really die because of the monsters? Then why haven\u2019t any of the Cheoldoo Group bastards died?\u201dThe area became quiet in an instant.\u201cWhy is it that they come back stronger?\u201d[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 nods at your reasoning.]\u201cD-Don\u2019t tell me\u2015\u201dThe people turned to look at Cheon Inho. The Cheoldoo Group members hesitated. Now it was my turn to drive in the wedge.\u201cThey said it before. If you kill me, you will get coins.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 pulls his hair in excitement.]\u201cBut how do they know that killing a person will give coins?\u201d\u201cY-You\u2026Inho-ssi! Don\u2019t tell me?\u201d\u201cShut up! I\u2019m being framed!\u201dAs Cheon Inho moved back, the men of the Cheoldoo Group pulled out their weapons. The frightened people were weeping.[Hahahat! There are 7 minutes left!]I stepped forward towards the people.\u201cIf you have any last self-respect left, fight with your own hands.\u201dThe Blade of Faith cried out violently. Anger filled the eyes of the people.\u201cAt least get back what was taken from you.\u201dAs I waited, the people of the Cheoldoo Group rushed towards me simultaneously. I also ran towards them.\u201cNow this world is such a place.\u201dThe white light moved and people screamed. Then someone shouted.\u201cYes, shit!\u201d\u201cSons of a bitches!\u201dThe people started to move. All in all, they were people who had already killed.\u201cM-Mother!\u201d\u201cDayoung, come here! Do this! Just like what you did on the subway with Mother!\u201dChildren and mothers.\u201cThis fuckin\u2019 bastards!\u201dThere was a middle-aged Indian man.\u201cThese scum!\u201dBut they weren\u2019t a match.The number of people left in the Cheoldoo Group was high and their fighting power was overwhelming due to all the coins they obtained through human hunting.Or this would be the case if it wasn\u2019t for me.Sukakak!The arms and legs of the Cheoldoo Group members who rushed for me flew off. The eerie sensation of cutting off a person\u2019s limbs filled my hands. The incapacitated Cheoldoo Group members looked up at me.\u201cS-Spare me\u2026\u201dAt that moment. Someone moved ahead of me and stuck their blade in the fallen Cheoldoo Group members.\u201cI said I would kill him.\u201d[All evolution conditions of the attribute \u2018Crouching Figure\u2019 have been met.]The attribute of character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 is blossoming.]A dazzling brilliance was rising from her body. I nodded. It was now time.[The attribute of \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 has blossomed to \u2018Judge of Destruction (Hero).]A judge to wipe out evil. The best of the three \u2018judge\u2019 attributes woke up from a crouching figure.[You have contributed greatly to the attribute of \u2018Crouching Figure!\u2019][The character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 won\u2019t hesitate to be your sword in the future.]\u201cRest from now on.\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s eyes were pale blue as she declared.\u201cThese guys are my share.\u201d[The character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 has activated the exclusive skill \u2018Judgment Time.\u2019][The Absolute Good constellations have agreed to the use of this skill.][\u2019Judgment Time\u2019 has been activated.]Jung Heewon had a bloody aura around her body as her blade painted an eerie trail. It was a light and precise kendo that moved between the Cheoldoo Group members. Blood spurted everywhere.\u201cKuaaaak!\u201dIt was a scene of a complete massacre. Of course, Jung Heewon wasn\u2019t the only one fighting. Yoo Sangah, Lee Hyunsung and even Lee Gilyoung were protecting their respective positions. But no one was as active as Jung Heewon.Like a person who was born for murder, Jung Heewon killed and killed. If I cut off a man\u2019s arm, Jung Heewon stabbed his heart. If I cut off his leg, Jung Heewon cut his throat.Jung Heewon took care of all those I left behind. She moved without hesitation, like a person who had been longing for this moment.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe area was filled with blood.The only person left from the Cheoldoo Group was Cheon Inho. However, many parts of his body were injured by the citizens. Jung Heewon looked at me and I nodded. Cheon Inho laughed as he looked at me.\u201cHu, huhu\u2026y-you\u2026\u201dHe never stopped speaking. Jung Heewon appeared behind Cheon Inho and cut him from top to bottom.[All constellations in the channel feel intense joy.]Finally, everyone stopped moving. The fight was over. However, they couldn\u2019t feel it.The times when they ate grilled meat, felt the meaning of life, joked while walking and enjoyed moments of peace all seemed like a lie.This damn scenario.Yoo Sangah was crying. Lee Gilyoung closed his eyes. Lee Hyunsung bit his lips so hard he was bleeding. Jung Heewon exhausted her physical strength and was sitting in a pool of blood.Yes, this was the truth of the world.[The survival value will be settled.]There was the sound of popping all around us. Those who had coins survived. Those who failed to get coins were now dead. And no one was able to save each other.I said to the people.\u201cWake up, everybody.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEven if I raised my head, the sky couldn\u2019t be seen. I stared at the unseen sky for a while, resisting some great fate.The noisy constellations had no answer this time.\u201cThis scenario has just begun.\u201dWhile everyone was in deep thought, I was thinking about the next scenario alone. My mind was calm as pages flipped one after another.I have obtained everything I needed from Gumho Station. The next stage was Chungmuro.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Omniscient Reader\u2019s ViewpointChapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 6 \u2013 Judgment Time (3)The following morning, there were a few changes to Gumho Station.First of all, Han Myungoh had disappeared.He had hidden once the fighting started and disappeared after it ended. I didn\u2019t know if he was hiding somewhere in the station or was moving to the next station.\u201cLet\u2019s not worry about him now. I didn\u2019t like him from the beginning. In addition, he isn\u2019t the only one who disappeared.\u201dIt was as Jung Heewon said. After the fight yesterday, the number of people remaining in Gumho Station was almost nonexistent.It wasn\u2019t that there were few survivors. Rather, more people survived compared to the original plot. However, most of those who survived left the station last night. Perhaps they had their own reasons.\u201c\u2026Will the remaining people be okay?\u201dYoo Sangah asked as she looked at the survivors.Me, Yoo Sangah, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung and Jung Heewon. Apart from us five, there were only five people left in this station.Jung Heewon spoke first.\u201cHey everyone. Are you coming with us?\u201dThe casual words caused a stir among the people. The representative was a young woman holding a child\u2019s hand.\u201c\u2026We will go separately. We have some coins left.\u201dI honestly admired that the mother and child survived the bloody fight. If she had that much strength, they might be able to survive without going with us.Jung Heewon nodded.\u201cYes. I wish you luck.\u201dOnce Jung Heewon turned around, relief appeared on the people\u2019s faces.In fact, this response wasn\u2019t strange. Certainly, yesterday\u2019s situation was a bit shocking.It was understandable. One refused to give out charity while another one brutally killed people, even if there was a reason. To them, Jung Heewon might not be much different from the Cheoldoo Group.I touched Lee Hyunsung, who was making a stupid expression next to me.\u201cLee Hyunsung-ssi?\u201d\u201cAh, yes!\u201dLee Hyunsung, who was staring at Jung Heewon with a blank expression, looked at me with surprise. I think I knew what he was thinking.He wondered if she was the woman struck by madness yesterday and killed all the Cheoldoo Group.\u201cAre the preparations finished?\u201d\u201cYep! It is a big rough but it is finished. There are plastic bottles to be used as water containers, goods to protect from the cold and emergency supplies\u2026\u201dIndeed, a soldier was useful in situations like this.\u201c\u2026It is up to here. If you need anything else\u2026\u201dThere was nothing else I needed\u2026I wanted to say but I suddenly thought about something.\u201cOh, can you find me any portable secondary batteries?\u201d\u201cYou are talking about a battery? Why\u2026?\u201dIt was natural to wonder. A smartphone was useless because no signal was available. I replied roughly.\u201cI have a place to use it.\u201dLee Hyunsung said he would look for it and started to search through the things left behind by the Cheoldoo Group. Lee Gilyoung and Yoo Sangah also said they would help. Jung Heewon looked at me and asked.\u201cAre we going now?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going.\u201dShe asked naturally, as if there was no question that we would go together. This was Jung Heewon. It was welcome from my viewpoint. The \u2018Judge of Destruction\u2019 was a talented person who even Yoo Jonghyuk would pay attention to.\u201cI have many questions.\u201d\u201cNot now.\u201d\u201cAh really, you are an iron wall.\u201dJung Heewon lightly punched me and laughed.[You have received 1,500 coins from the character \u2018Jung Heewon.\u2019]\u201cThis\u2026?\u201d\u201cI am dividing it. I feel too sorry to eat it all alone. I will give it to other people.\u201dI understood what she was saying. Yesterday, Jung Heewon alone killed most of the Cheoldoo Group members. In other words, she obtained most of their coins. By the way\u2026 I was a bit nervous about this.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do this.\u201dJung Heewon didn\u2019t know. In fact, I had a lot more coins.\u201cI\u2019m not Dokja-ssi, you know?\u201dShe punched my arms a few more times before walking towards the tunnel with her backpack.\u201cFinish this off. I\u2019ll go ahead and make some arrangements.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go too far ahead. There are dangerous sections to go alone.\u201dJung Heewon waved her hands as if not to worry while wandering away.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 likes your comradeship.][The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 smiles slyly.]I watched the messages in the air blankly and said.\u2018Did you make a lot yesterday? It must be good.\u2019There was no answer. I spoke once again.\u2018Don\u2019t keep pretending and tell me. I know you are watching.\u2019[Ah, hahaha\u2026 you caught me?]It was Bihyung\u2019s voice.\u2018How much did you earn?\u2019[\u2026T-That. Um.]I stared silently.[Sigh, right. How did you know again\u2026? I just can\u2019t get over it. Take this.][Dokkaebi \u2018Bihyung\u2019 has given you 4,500 coins.]I thought so. This damn dokkaebi.[\u2026The constellations don\u2019t use the sponsorship system and send it directly to me. I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019ll give it to you later. Ah, there are these messages as well.]Messages suddenly popped up.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is satisfied with your scenario][The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is convinced of your judgment.][The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 is satisfied with your plan.]This was why I didn\u2019t get the support messages yesterday.I had been curious because such a great thing happened and I received less income than I thought.[Coins Possessed: 23,050 C]I invested a lot of the coins I obtained last time into stats and now I had a lot of coins again.It was once again time to improve my stats. Then let\u2019s do it moderately. I couldn\u2019t open the attributes window so I had to remember the exact level of my stats.First\u2026stamina was important.[1,200 coins have been invested in stamina.][Stamina Lv. 12 -> Stamina Lv. 15][The durability of your body has greatly increased!]I had no separate passive attack skill so I also raised my strength.[1,600 coins have been invested in strength.][Strength Lv. 11 -> Strength Lv. 15][A stronger force will come from your muscles!]For agility, it was enough to be able to evade.[400 coins have been invested in agility.][Agility Lv. 10 -> Agility Lv. 11][Now you can more a bit faster.]I needed to maintain White Pure Star Energy so magic power must be over level 10.[1,200 coins have been invested in magic power.][Magic Power Lv. 6 -> Magic Power Lv. 10][A mysterious energy lives in your soul.]I could invest more than this but I purposefully didn\u2019t. Once I arrived in Chungmuro, there was another place where I would have to use a lot of coins.Besides, I had spent 4,400 coins just now. It was both easy and difficult to use. If I had been born with decent stats, I wouldn\u2019t have to spend so many coins.Someone born with level 1 stamina\u2026 in Ways of Destruction, even Lee Gilyoung\u2019s stamina would be higher than that.[By the way, I forgot\u2026two more scenarios are recommended. You are really great. It seems that I will soon be able to upgrade my channel level.]\u2018I see.\u2019I couldn\u2019t get the support of a sponsor like other incarnations, so I needed to collect more coins. But the reason why I didn\u2019t see the effect of contracting with Bihyung was because his channel was small.The \u2018minor\u2019 constellations weren\u2019t enough. In order to gather more coins, it would take more constellations to configure the channel. Once I went to Chungmuro, the environment would be ready soon.\u201cIf everybody is ready, we will leave. You aren\u2019t missing anything?\u201dMy companions gathered together and nodded. Looking at their nervous faces, all of them seemed to have been enlightened by yesterday.Finally, the journey to Chungmuro began.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *They had crossed half the railroad lines when the system message popped up.[The second main scenario is enabled.]+[Main Scenario #1 \u2013 Meeting]Category: MainDifficulty: EClear Conditions: Cross the tunnel and meet the survivors in the first main base.Time Limit: NoneCompensation: 500 coinsFailure: ???+The message made me realize that it was really starting. Unlike the first main scenario, the second scenario had a \u2018main base.\u2019 Jung Heewon asked.\u201cThe main base? Where is that?\u201dAn answer wasn\u2019t required. Another message immediately appeared.[The next main base is \u2018Chungmuro.\u2019\u201cIs it Chungmuro? It is only three more stops\u2026\u201dIt was originally like that.Ku ku ku ku!The ground rats appeared. There were around 30 ground rats. Jung Heewon stiffened.\u201c\u2026Go three stops through this.\u201dIt was Lee Hyunsung who came forward.\u201cI\u2019ll take the vanguard.\u201dThanks to the support of his sponsor, Lee Hyunsung\u2019s total stats were now 37. He had earned less coins than me but he was chasing me\u2026this was the advantage of being born with high stats.If I knew this, I would\u2019ve done regular push-ups.\u201cI\u2019ll take the rear, Hyung.\u201dLee Gilyoung\u2019s total stats were still low but he was able to use Diverse Communication more flexibly through steady skill training.\u201cPlease leave it to me.\u201dYoo Sangah made a thread with magic power to block the movements of the ground rats. Her attack ability was low but her overall stats were similar to Jung Heewon.Kwajik!\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t it just a lot of numbers?\u201dFinally, there was no need to talk about Jung Heewon. Compared to Lee Hyunsung, her total stats were low but her skills were sufficient.There was the exclusive skill \u2018Judgment Time\u2019 that belonged to the \u2018Judge of Destruction.\u2019 As long as the opponent in front of her was \u2018wicked\u2019 according to the Absolute Good constellations, Jung Heewon wouldn\u2019t lose.The last ground rat fell down. Lee Hyunsung held the shield by his side and started sweating.\u201cSigh\u2026this seems to be enough.\u201dIn fact, this shouldn\u2019t have been cleared so easily. No matter how simple the pattern of the ground rats was, fighting 30 of them was tough. I wouldn\u2019t be able to annihilate them myself without activating Bookmark. The party had become stronger.They advanced further through the tunnel. Finally, a new platform appeared in front of me.\u201cYaksu Station. By the way\u2026there is nobody? No, that\u2019s not it.\u201dYaksu Station was filled with dead bodies and ground rat corpses. Based on the injuries, some of the people were killed by Yoo Jonghyuk, not the ground rats.\u201cKeep going. There are two stops left.\u201dWe continued to advance. Anyway, the distance from Yaksu to Dongdae was less than 1km in a straight line.Once we arrived at the entrance of Dongdae Station, we encountered another group of ground rats and repelled them. We only moved a total of 2km along a simple path, but the fighting was so tough that the party\u2019s fitness dropped quickly.\u201cWe will take a break here.\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026there is one stop left. We should just go there and relax\u2026\u201d\u201cNobody knows if we can rest or not once we arrive there.\u201dEveryone was silent at my words. Certainly, monsters weren\u2019t the only dangers things in this world.I looked around for a moment and said.\u201cIt seems that the people in this station moved quickly. Some basic necessities might remain.\u201d\u201cAh right. Then\u2026\u201dAfter hearing \u2018basic necessities\u2019, Yoo Sangah gently raised her hand. Yoo Sangah and Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes met. No words were exchanged but both of them nodded at the same time. Jung Heewon saw my look and asked me.\u201cWhat is it? Does Dokja-ssi want to know?\u201dYoo Sangah paled.\u201c\u2026Heewon-ssi?\u201d\u201cAhaha, I\u2019m just joking. Of course, I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\u2026A secret only between women. It would be strange if I didn\u2019t know what they were talking about. Human physiology didn\u2019t stop even in a world like this.Lee Hyunsung also opened his mouth. \u201cAh, then I will go to the bathroom.\u201dI was surprised for a moment but there was no reason not to use well-built facilities.

It was in order to heal the skin contaminated by the poisonous fog.It took a little time but the contamination could be recovered by eating the meat of an underground species.[\u2026Hey! Are you crazy? What did you do just now?]I was eating when I heard Bihyung\u2019s voice furiously berating me.\u2018Shut up.\u2019[No, this isn\u2019t an issue you can dismiss. You destroyed a constellation\u2019s idol! Do you want to see my channel fail? Once the \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 begins to talk\u2026]The idol of a constellation. Every world had their own constellations, South Korea as well.By the way, Bihyung said it was the \u2018Bald General of Justice.\u2019 He was a great person in South Korea but\u2026Actually, I wasn\u2019t the type of person to say that.[A constellation wearing a straw mat is furious at your atrocious actions.][The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is laughing.]There was a difference in the degree of all idols, but they had the power of a constellation sealed in them.If I released the seal of the idol in the right way, I could gain a certain amount of power, such as an item or skill that the constellation used in their lifetime.However, \u2018unlocking the seal\u2019 took a long time and I wasn\u2019t sure if I could get the skill I wanted.I looked at Ways of Survival on my smartphone.\u300c \u201cBut if it is sealed in the bronze statue of Samyeongdang, how did you get the skill?\u201d\u201cThere is a saying that if you meet Buddha, kill Buddha.\u201d\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha, I was just trying it out\u2026 but it is true. All the statues aren\u2019t just for worship.\u201d\u201cHey! This jerk, you should watch your mouth. You might be cursed by the constellation.\u201d \u300dAt the last gateway to enter Chungmuro, the \u2018skill\u2019 of Samyeongdang was essential.And the most surefire way to get the skill was to destroy the idol. Of course, I could buy something similar from the Dokkaebi Bag but\u2026 the more coins I saved, the better.\u201cThen did you resolve the \u2018man\u2019s secret\u2019 well?\u201dI quickly turned off my smartphone screen. My companions, including Jung Heewon, had gathered.\u201cYes. And I have something for you.\u201dI pulled out the items I gained from the idol. As luck would have it, the Samyeongdang idol contained items and skills.[Samyeongdang\u2019s Beads][Samyeongdang\u2019s Straw Mat]Rags and old beads. There were questions in the eyes of everyone present. I knew what they were thinking.But I also knew this.

I know!\u201dFortunately, someone knew. Needless to say, it was Yoo Sangah.\u201cI remember seeing it when I was studying Korean history! Isn\u2019t he a monk from the Joseon Dynasty?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWhen the Korean military was struggling to defend against the Japanese invasion\u2026he fought in the Nowongpyeong battle and Wukwandong battel!\u201dAs expected from Yoo Sangah.

No way\u2026\u201dI thought it was ridiculous but there was a reason people said such ridiculous words.I put on a mock solemn expression as I watched the party.\u201cI think\u2026 it was sent by Samyeongdang for South Korea.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dTheir \u2018ah\u2019 were filled with many meanings. I ignored them and kept talking. It wasn\u2019t like I was asking for them to listen.\u201cHe might\u2019ve left his belongings to save the country, just like during the Japanese invasion of South Korea. Anyway, now South Korea is a country undergoing turmoil.\u201d[A constellation wearing a straw mat is moved by your words.]In times of turmoil, scammers always gained power.\u201c\u2026In this strange world, it isn\u2019t weird if something like this happens. Maybe Samyeongdang is one of the \u2018constellations.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dSurprisingly, Yoo Sangah seemed convinced first. Maybe she didn\u2019t want me to be embarrassed. The funny thing was that once Yoo Sangah agreed, Lee Hyunsung was immediately convinced.\u201cIndeed, Samyeongdang\u2026\u201dLee Hyunsung grew up with patriotism for a long time and looked like he was reminiscing on the principle of military service. Lee Gilyoung also seemed curious.It was only Jung Heewon who was watching me like it was nonsense.[A constellation wearing a straw mat likes your revealing words.][The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 forgives your sins.]Bihyung looked at the sky with a \u2018Is this okay?\u2019 expression before looking dumbfounded.The power of a constellation was directly linked to their fame. Thus, the constellations loved it when their stories were spread this way. Where was a constellation that hated being praised?\u201cI will give Samyeongdang\u2019s Beads to Yoo Sangah, since you know him well.\u201d\u201cReally? Can I accept it?\u201d\u201cI think Samyeongdang will be delighted if Samyeongdang uses it.\u201dIn fact, the performance of Samyeongdang\u2019s Beads wasn\u2019t good compared to what the sponsor used it for. It wasn\u2019t a sponsor\u2019s star relic so maybe the fact that the Samyeongdang wasn\u2019t a world-recognized figure had an effect.It was still a B class item so it had a secondary option of boosting magic power to increase magic power recovery.Jung Heewon watched Yoo Sangah like she was envious and said.\u201cYoo Sangah knows a lot of things. I didn\u2019t know about Samyeongdang because I didn\u2019t do very well at school.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026that\u2026that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m joking, joking. Don\u2019t make such an expression.\u201dI spoke to the sulky Jung Heewon.\u201cI also have something for Jung Heewon-ssi.\u201d\u201cFor me? Is it that straw mat?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. No matter how urgent, I don\u2019t want to wear such a thing.\u201d\u201c\u2026Just try it. You won\u2019t regret it.\u201dJung Heewon hesitated for a moment before throwing on the straw mat. She was trying to be fashionable but she just looked like a beggar.[A constellation who likes comradeship condemns your actions.][A constellation who praises friendship likes your actions.]It would be different if the star relic \u2018Samyeongdang\u2019s Bamboo Stick and Straw Sandals\u2019 came out, but the other two items weren\u2019t necessary for me right now.Jung Heewon saw her reflection on the screen door of the subway and made a slightly complicated expression.\u201cIt is hard to explain but\u2026I suddenly feel like I can harness the power of justice.\u201dSamyeongdang\u2019s Straw Mat was an item that enhanced the justice and willpower of the incarnation. I didn\u2019t need it but it was a pretty good item for Jung Heewon.\u201cYou said Samyeongdang? I feel sorry for some reason. I should study harder.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 is happy at this situation.][100 coins have been sponsored.]I jokingly said.\u201cThen let\u2019s put our hands together and pray.\u201d*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *It was a joke but Jung Heewon really went to pray.Jung Heewon was contaminated by the poisonous fog and spoke while eating a ground rat.\u201c\u2026But who broke it?

What is this?\u201dShe would know without asking.\u201cIt is coming. Everyone, please keep your mind straight.\u201dBefore my words were over, a haze overcame me. The fog that instantly occupied the tunnel blocked their field of view. The party members in the immediate vicinity couldn\u2019t be seen. When I looked around, I could only see a distorted scenery, as if I was on drugs.\u201cUwah\u2026I feel bad!\u201dJung Heewon screamed. Maybe Jung Heewon was seeing something different from what I saw now.\u300cDokja.\u300dThe voice I didn\u2019t want to hear. That forgotten voice was heard in a drug-like landscape. If I was this way, my other party members would be worse.\u201c\u2026Something feels strange. Dokja-ssi! Are you there?\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi!

Fortunately, it worked.I approached Yoo Sangah and said.\u201cCover the surroundings. From now on, I will destroy this space.\u201dYoo Sangah nodded with a nervous expression.[The exclusive skill \u2018Destroy Evil Lv. 1\u2019 is activated.]Destroy Evil. It was one level higher than the Repel Evil skill that could be bought with coins.

Please wake up!\u201dAt this moment, a blade flew from the rear. Fortunately, the blade wasn\u2019t fast and it wasn\u2019t difficult to avoid.\u201c\u2026I will kill all of you.\u201dJung Heewon was waving her sword through the air like a madman.My heart ached as I watched Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes became gradually redder.This was dangerous. It was a sign of \u2018Demon Slaying.\u2019Peok!I stunned Jung Heewon by strongly hitting her in the back of the neck. Luckily, Jung Heewon was intact.I thought it wouldn\u2019t be like this with Samyeongdang\u2019s Straw Mat but Jung Heewon\u2019s mental state was more fragile than I expected.\u201cYoo Sangah, please look after Jung Heewon-ssi.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, yes!\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d[You have met the conditions to clear the sub scenario!][You have earned 300 coins.]Monsters appeared as soon as the clear message showed up.

This needed to be picked up. Thanks to Yoo Sangah, the others were recovering quickly.\u201cA-Are you okay?\u201dThe one who recovered the fastest was Lee Hyunsung.

He pretended to be okay but perhaps the one with the most terrible trauma in this place was this child.I saw a pale light in the distance. Yoo Sangah said,\u201cDokja-ssi, I think it is over.I worried about it for a short moment. Jung Heewon was stunned and it was difficult for others to exercise their power. Would we be okay to enter Chungmuro at this rate?But my concerns were resolved by another person.A blade loomed in the darkness.

I guess Lee Jihye could be called that if the sponsor behind her wasn\u2019t known. Sooner or later, they would be punished. Lee Jihye frowned at the middle-aged people.\u201cAre you drunk again?\u201d\u201cHahahat! What is there to do other than drink when the world has become like this?\u201dThe middle-aged people seemed relaxed, unlike those who were experiencing a disaster.

It would be strange if they didn\u2019t follow him.But the boy didn\u2019t know. The boy survived not because Yoo Jonghyuk was a good guy, but because the boy was luckily with Lee Jihye.\u201cNow can I ask you a few things I am curious about?\u201dLee Hyunsung started asking politely while I was locked in my thoughts.\u201cYes. Just ask.\u201d\u201cHow is the food supply here?\u201d\u201cThat, it is a bit embarrassing to say\u2026 some people, including me, are dependent on Jihye. Jihye hunts and asks Yoo Jonghyuk-ssi to cook\u2026\u201dIt was unknown when he made a checklist but Lee Hyunsung took out his notes and started to write something. He really was a soldier.\u201cThen how is your drinking water?\u201d\u201cWe give food or coins to the \u2018Landlord Alliance\u2019 upstairs in exchange.\u201d\u201c\u2026Landlord Alliance?\u201dI sat straight up. Now the story was becoming interesting. The boy hesitantly opened his mouth.\u201cThey are the landlords in charge of the Chungmuro area. They occupy the upper floors and we call them the Landlord Alliance.\u201dChungmuro\u2019s Landlord Alliance. It was a name that appeared in Ways of Survival.\u201cWhat type of people are they?\u201d\u201cWell, what should I say\u2026\u201dIn fact, there was no need for me to ask. Perhaps, according to my expectations, one of the \u201810 Evils\u2019 was in Chungmuro right now.\u201cThey are just landlords.\u201dThis answer was the correct answer in a sense. They were landlords. Building owners who received fixed taxes. At this moment, the quiet Lee Gilyoung opened his mouth.\u201cExcuse me Hyung.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI want to go to the toilet.\u201d\u201cIs it urgent?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe timing was a bit unexpected. It was even more puzzling because Lee Gilyoung normally didn\u2019t say something like this. Then I noticed that Lee Gilyoung was standing next to a blushing Yoo Sangah.\u201c\u2026Excuse me, can I also go with you?\u201dAt the moment, the image of Yoo Sangah and Jung Heewon securing secret necessities at Yaksu Station came to mind. I thought I knew what was going on. That kid Lee Gilyoung, he quickly noticed it first.The boy overhead the conversation and said.\u201cYou need to go up to the second underground floor for the toilet, but it won\u2019t be easy to enter.\u201d\u201c\u2026Has something happened?\u201d\u201cYes. I think it is better to see directly\u2026I\u2019m going up to, would you like to go with me?\u2019\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dI was the one who said it. Of course, it wasn\u2019t to go to the bathroom. I had to go up and check a few things.Recently, Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s movements were different from the \u2018third regression\u2019 that I knew. If so, I needed to be clear about the gap.I went up to the third underground level with my friends, carrying Jung Heewon who was still unconscious.\u201cOh, I heard that there were new faces. Have you come to see the rooms?\u201dA middle-aged man standing near the escalator for line 4 whistled. The boy shook his head and replied.\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. We are going upstairs\u2026\u201d\u201cEh, too bad. Be careful.\u201dThe middle-aged man waved his hands without hesitation. Yoo Sangah watched the middle-aged man moving away and asked.\u201cThat, by the way\u2026 what exactly is the \u2018room\u2019? I don\u2019t think it is the rooms that I know.\u201d\u201cIt is easy.\u201dThe boy pointed to a square tile.The tiles were also present on the platform of line 3. Green tiles that were 1 pyeong in size. Looking at the details, I saw something written in the air above the tile.[Green Zone 0/1]\u201cThe scenario name is \u2018green zone\u2019 and these tiles are called rooms.\u201dNear the tile, two men were fighting each other. They were fighting over the tile. It was Lee Hyunsung who asked this time.\u201cWhat is that? Why are those people fighting over it?\u201dThe boy looked a bit reluctant. It was like talking to us would be a threat to his survival.\u201cYou will know once you arrive at the second underground floor.\u201dAs we climbed up to the higher floors, there were more fights over rooms. The room numbers were different. There were small rooms labelled (0/1) and large rooms labelled (0/7). The latter number was probably the capacity of the room.I looked around carefully and asked, \u201cThe third underground floor to the first underground floor is all the area of the Landlord Association?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. There are small forces but the Landlord Association has obtained most of it.\u201dAll the infrastructure of Chungmuro was located on the second and first underground floors, yet a single alliance occupied all of it.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk didn\u2019t take any action? Didn\u2019t he save you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dThe boy\u2019s face became noticeably darker at my question. The boy looked sullen for a while before barely being able to speak.\u201cHe told us to stand on our own\u2026\u201dI knew. Of course Yoo Jonghyuk would say something like this. Perhaps Yoo Jonghyuk never told them to follow him. They were fascinated by the overwhelming force that Yoo Jonghyuk showed and had hopeful dreams. How pitiful.Not long after, we arrived at the second underground floor. There was tension on the boy\u2019s face.\u201cWe have to be careful from here onwards.\u201dThere were much more rooms on B2 than the lower levels. The group\u00a0 of people fighting couldn\u2019t be seen. Instead, people were guarding the green zones with scary eyes.[Green Zone 7/7]We passed by the people and headed towards the bathrooms.\u201cUh\u2026why stop here?\u201dOur pace stopped as we approached the last passage to the bathroom. Like a bottleneck, dozens of people were gathered in the passage.\u201cLet\u2019s go forward.\u201dI spoke while pushing people out of the way.\u201cPildu-ssi! Please accept it! I won\u2019t do it again!\u201d\u201cPlease, please! Please let me stay one more day. I\u2019ll go into debt to get the coins!\u201dThe leader at the head of the line was facing the heated up people.\u201cNow now, back off. Back off.\u201dOn the opposite side, people who seemed to be from the Landlord Association were gathered. I could instinctively feel it.One of the 10 Evils was here. I tried to find the \u201810 Evils\u2019 member through the novel\u2019s description but it wasn\u2019t easy since all of them seemed to fit.Did their impressions became similar after becoming landlords?I was shaking my head when someone grabbed my leg. It was Lee Gilyoung. I sensed something danger and was about to grab his shoulder when someone pushed Lee Gilyoung.\u201cAh.\u201dLee Gilyoung lost his balance and fell down.[The character \u2018Lee Gilyoung\u2019 has invaded private property!]Suddenly, the atmosphere became cold and some of the \u2018Landlord Association\u2019 members in the front looked at Lee Gilyoung.\u201cWhat is this child?\u201dAt almost the same time, the crowd of people screamed and withdrew.\u201cCrazy!\u201d\u201cB-Back! Quickly!\u201dAs if they were never there, the crowd of people rushed back like the tide. The people disappeared and red lines shone where they used to be standing. One man looked between the boundary and Lee Gilyoung in turn.\u201cHrmm. You seem to be lost. Do you know where this is?\u201d\u201cThe way to the bathroom?\u201d\u201cThe bathroom? Haha, at one time. By the way, that kid\u2026where are your parents?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you learn that you shouldn\u2019t intrude on other people\u2019s land?\u201dOther people\u2019s land. Oh, it must be true.The man stroked Lee Gilyoung\u2019s head with an unknown look.\u201cYou don\u2019t know. From now on, I will teach you.\u201d[The character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 has activated \u2018Armed Zone Lv. 3!]There was a whirring sound and mini turrets resembling gatling guns rose from the ground.[The character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 demands 500 coins for invading his private land.][If you don\u2019t follow the recommendations, all nearby turrets will fire immediately.]The man spoke.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGive me money.\u201dThe loaded turrets were all aiming at the same point. The confused Lee Gilyoung stood up and moved to my side. The man saw me and laughed.\u201cAh, you are his guardian. Then shouldn\u2019t the guardian pay 500 coins instead?\u201dI smiled at the hand that the man brazenly stretched out.\u2026How funny, Yoo Jonghyuk.

Thus, a person wouldn\u2019t be aware of Gong Pildu unless they read to the end of Ways of Survival (like me).[Green Zone 56/70]Indeed, the size of his room was different. The size of the room couldn\u2019t be easily measured. This whole green zone was Gong Pildu\u2019s area.Let\u2019s do the standard procedure. I hid Lee Gilyoung behind me and opened my mouth.\u201cWhy should we pay you coins? Chungmuro Station is a public place.\u201d\u201cHaha, it was until eight days ago. But not anymore.\u201dFor ordinary humans, 500 coins wasn\u2019t a small sum. But giving 500 coins just for stepping on his land\u2026what a crook.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give it. But I\u2019ll give it to you directly.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou aren\u2019t Gong Pildu.\u201dGong Pildu might be a villain but right now, the person in front of me was just Extra \u20181\u2019 of the Landlord Alliance.Where are you, Gong Pildu? I quickly looked around. Not him, not him\u2026 I wondered where Gong Pildu was.\u201cHaha, you are a funny guy. Hey, playing with me now\u2026\u201d\u201cGong Pildu-ssi. Where are you? Take the fine.\u201dI ignored them and kept walking.[You have invaded private property!]The turrets aimed straight at me but I didn\u2019t stop.Honestly, there was no guarantee that I would be safe if the turrets started shooting. But there was a need to show off my combat power here. That way Gong Pildu wouldn\u2019t underestimate me.\u201cIt is up to here. I will give you if you come closer.\u201dFinally, Gong Pildu moved.A bench covered with various supplies. A middle-aged man sitting on top of it and reading a magazine was staring at me.Indeed, this was how he was described in the novel. His belly was half revealed and I could see the hair on it. This was Gong Pildu, the representative of the Landlord Alliance.\u201cThis is a face I\u2019ve never seen before but you are great.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it unfair that I need to pay to see you?\u201d[The character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 is interested in you.]In any case, I seemed to be the type that was popular with the bad guys. It was the same with Kim Namwoon.\u201cYou are fairly good at talking. But it isn\u2019t good to be too cocky.\u201dTadak.\u00a0I heard magic bullets being loaded in the turrets.

However, there were those who posted both characteristics and the \u2018armed fortress master\u2019 Gong Pildu in front of him was one of them.I realized it when I saw this explanation. His magic power was already at level 19. Indeed, this would be enough for him to be one of the 10 Evils in the future.\u201cBy the way, what did you come here for? I don\u2019t think your goal is paying the fine.\u201dHe was also very sensitive. I pondered over it for a while. Should I negotiate here or overpower Gong Pildu.It might be possible if I used all my power but it wasn\u2019t easy to break through Gong Pildu\u2019s Armed Zone. I needed to prepare for a big injury if I wanted to defeat the turrets.What should I do? There was a separate place where I had to use coins so it was impossible to increase my stats.\u201cI\u2019m warning you that you shouldn\u2019t think of anything.\u201dGong Pildu smiled at me. His troops were surrounding Lee Hyunsung. He really moved quickly.I laughed and raised both hands.\u201cPlease calm down. Isn\u2019t it obvious for a tenant to come to the landlord?\u201d\u201cIs it for a room?\u201d\u201cYes. Please let my companions and I sat in your green zone\u201dThis was a must. In order to clear the third scenario safely, we had to say in Gong Pildu\u2019s green zone. However, Gong Pildu\u2019s answer was as expected.\u201cNo. The alliance doesn\u2019t accept outsiders. I\u2019ll think about it if every person pays 500 coins a day.\u201d500 coins a day? It was like selling coins. It was more than the Dokkaebi Bag.\u201cIt is a bit tough so I will give you information instead.\u201d\u201cWhat information?\u201d\u201cInformation about Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk. The complexion of the landlords changed with one name.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk? Yoo Jonghyuk caused such an uproar not long ago\u2026\u201d\u201cYou bastard! What is your relationship with that guy?\u201d\u201cPildu-ssi! Isn\u2019t this bastard suspicious?\u201dThere was a reaction. I thought that Yoo Jonghyuk would\u2019ve already caused a problem with the Landlord Alliance.In fact, this point I was a bit unsure about. According to the original story, Yoo Jonghyuk of the third regression should be fighting against the Landlord Alliance by now. What was he doing?Gong Pildu stared at me with suspicious eyes.\u201cWhat is your relationship with Yoo Jonghyuk?\u201d\u201cWe are companions separated by life and death.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think it is like that?\u201d\u201cAnyway, we are friendly.\u201d\u201cHow can I believe that?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t believe me. Don\u2019t you have nothing to lose?\u201dI threw out the bait. Perhaps Gong Pildu would have to accept my suggestion. It was because right now, Yoo Jonghyuk was the only person who could threaten the power balance in Chungmuro.[The character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 has activated \u2018Profit Calculation Lv. 2!]\u201cWhy won\u2019t I receive any loss?\u201d\u2026?\u201cThere is no guarantee that you aren\u2019t a scammer. I can\u2019t ignore my years of experience.\u00a0 In my experience, people like you run away to avoid paying the rent at the end of the month.\u201dIt was so accurate that I felt wronged However, it was difficult to push it here.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, it can\u2019t be helped. Maybe there will be damages.\u201dGong Pildu\u2019s expression became complicated. I turned around without hesitation. It was important not to show any regret. That way, he would regret it even more.\u201cWait a minute.\u201dIndeed.\u201cYou have to pay the fine for intruding. Where are you trying to flee?\u201dIt was another regret. Dammit. I turned around and smiled awkwardly.\u201cHow much? 100 coins?\u201d\u201cNo, you and that kid are 1,000 coins.\u201dThe vein on my head bulged. Did this bastard think that 1,000 coins was 1,000 won\u2026?\u201cThat is too much.\u201dThe dokkaebi still hadn\u2019t given me the cut of the coins but I couldn\u2019t give 1,000 coins to a jerk like Gong Pildu.Gong Pildu grinned.\u201cThen you are disqualified as tenants. Die.\u201dI instinctively pushed through the men around me and ran to where my party members were.Kwang!There was the first firing sound and Lee Hyunsung held up a metal shield, blocking my back. He was really reliable.\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi.\u201dLee Hyunsung\u2019s strength and stamina were level 14 but he spoke very nervously. I could clearly see his trembling arm muscles.Lee Hyunsung hadn\u2019t obtained his second stigma yet, meaning he couldn\u2019t hold on against the turrets. Moreover, there was no Jung Heewon. If I started a head to head fight, someone in this party would surely die.\u201cGong Pildu-ssi, wait a moment. If we fight then you won\u2019t escape any damages.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt is better not to fight us now.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dThe damage had to be shown.\u201cIf we fight now, you will die here.\u201dGong Pildu\u2019s expression hardened. Even if I didn\u2019t add anything, Gong Pildu would\u2019ve noticed.The presence of the guy coming down the escalator from B1.

His eyes were questioning.\u201cWhy are you leaving Gong Pildu alone?\u201d\u201cIf you are a prophet, you should know.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know everything.\u201dTo be exact, I didn\u2019t remember everything.[The character \u2018Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019 has used the \u2018Lie Detection\u2019 skill.[The character Yoo Jonghyuk has confirmed that your words are true.]He was thorough.\u201c\u2026Indeed, I see. A prophet whose level of \u2018future sight\u2019 is low.\u201dThink what you want.Yoo Jonghyuk continued speaking.\u201cI need Gong Pildu alive.\u201d\u201cIs it because of a future scenario?\u201dYoo Jonghyuk didn\u2019t answer. It was like he was trying to gauge the information I knew.\u201cI know that you need Gong Pildu for future scenarios. But you only need Gong Pildu. You don\u2019t need the entire group that follows him.\u201d\u300c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u300d\u201cIsn\u2019t it your style to remove what you don\u2019t need? Why are you just leaving them?\u201d\u300c\u2026How annoying. \u300dWhat?\u201cI have a lot to do.\u201d Yoo Jonghyuk stared at me quietly and said, \u201cYou will never understand.\u201d\u201cWait! That isn\u2019t the problem. If you don\u2019t move now, most of the humans in Chungmuro will\u2026!\u201dYoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes were cold.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dI wasn\u2019t a humanist. I didn\u2019t believe that everyone in this world was worth living. The thing that was making me angry right now was Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk. Can I hit you?\u201d\u201cIf you have confidence.\u201dI angrily formed a fist as I heard a message.[The character Yoo Jonghyuk has used \u2018Strong Self-Defense Lv. 5\u2019.]I dropped my fist. Cowardly bastard.\u201cAre you finished?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dLee Jihye flinched at Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s call. Lee Jihye, who belated followed Yoo Jonghyuk, looked at me with confused eyes.[The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 is impressed by your chivalrous spirit.][100 coins have been sponsored.]Of course, it was completely misleading.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *[There are 1 hour and 30 minutes before the third scenario is activated.]There wasn\u2019t much time left and my mind was complicated.[The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 is angry that people\u2019s lives must be risked.][The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 wants an uprising.]Samyeongdang spoke loudly in my head but I couldn\u2019t think of a good way. The third scenario lasted exactly one week.Maybe Yoo Jonghyuk was planning to gain some other advantage during the duration of the third scenario.Of course, I couldn\u2019t let it go. I couldn\u2019t let it go\u2026[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is wondering what you are thinking.]\u201cThat jerk Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is satisfied.][100 coins have been sponsored.]In fact, the problem in front of me wasn\u2019t Yoo Jonghyuk but Gong Pildu. In order to break through the third scenario, Gong Pildu\u2019s help was absolutely necessary. But if I couldn\u2019t get his help\u2026Suddenly, Jung Heewon looked up and smiled.\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cYou know, that person. The one you were talking to Yoo Jonghyuk about.\u201dI immediately explained about Gong Pildu. Jung Heewon was unconscious so she hadn\u2019t been able to see Gong Pildu. I didn\u2019t mean to change the subject. Jung Heewon immediately reacted.\u201c\u2026What are these scum? Taking the public facilities and making people pay to use them?\u201d\u201cThe scum are upstairs.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go and throw them out.Jung Heewon picked up the ground rat blade. That reminded me, I should change their weapons. There was a lot to be done.\u201cIt is absurd.\u201d\u201cWe can win if we join forces. Don\u2019t you remember Gumho Station?\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s expression was confident.It was natural. Jung Heewon had the Judgment Time skill as a trump card. She had good senses and was quick to adapt, so she would\u2019ve already figured out her attribute and skills.\u201cDon\u2019t dawdle! Let\u2019s go and kill them!\u201dAs long as her opponents were \u2018wicket\u2019, her Judgment Time boasted the highest power.[The character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 has activated the exclusive skill \u2018Judgment Time.\u2019][The constellations of the Absolute Good system are silent at Jung Heewon\u2019s request.[The skill has been cancelled.]Jung Heewon\u2019s face filled with confusion.\u201cNo, this\u2026what? Is it broken?\u201dJung Heewon tried to activate the skill again. However, the skill wasn\u2019t triggered.\u201cNo\u2026why isn\u2019t it activated? Aren\u2019t they obviously wicked?\u201dI laughed at Jung Heewon\u2019s question.\u201cThat is what we humans think.\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThe constellations might be different. There is no guarantee that the good and evil they know is like what we know.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cJustice is always decided by the majority.\u201dRight now, the majority of constellations have decided that they are \u2018good.\u2019 Humans no longer had the right to decide on justice. Humans were just the puppets of their sponsors.\u201cThat\u2026\u201dI looked at the party members.Everyone didn\u2019t say anything but they thought in a similar way to Jung Heewon. Lee Hyunsung wiped the iron shield that was scratched by the magic bullets, while Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung sat next to each other on the ground, looking at cockroaches.This sense of despair, I could understand.They thought they understood after getting rid of the gang at Gumho Station. However, there was an incomparable monster just three stations away.It was time to start the torture of hope.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean there is no way.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIt might be difficult but there is a way to defeat them.\u201dThey simultaneously looked at me. Lee Hyunsung asked.\u201c\u2026Do you really have a way?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dI looked around and lowered my voice.\u201cGet Gong Pildu out of the Armed Zone.\u201d\u201cWhat is the Armed Zone?\u201d\u201cHis stigma. It is optimized to defend an area.\u201dArmed Zone. The reason why it was difficult to go against Gong Pildu was this stigma. It was a fraudulent ability that could build \u2018turrets\u2019 in an area.Right now, it was just Armed Zone. Once the stigma evolved in the future, it would become \u2018Armed Fortress\u2019 and a siege needed to be prepared to catch him.But Gong Pildu had an obvious weakness.\u201cHis Armed Zone will be released as soon as he leaves his designated area. His mini-turrets will also become useless. Usually, there are many restrictions on such a wide defense skill.\u201dAt the same time, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon looked at me with admiration.\u201cAh\u2026I see.\u201d\u201cYou figured this out after seeing it once? Is this Dokja-ssi\u2019s attribute?\u201dThe same thing was repeated but I saw that the people had adapted to me to some extent. Yoo Sangah asked.\u201cBut how will you make him move?\u201d\u201cWe have to think about that for now.\u201d\u201cAh, I hate thinking.\u201d Jung Heewon complained.Then everyone was silent for a while. It was Lee Hyunsung who gave his idea first.\u201cAttack when he goes to the bathroom\u2026\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you see the things next to the bench?\u201dGong Pildu never moved out of his Armed Zone. His bench had everything he needed. There was a sleeping bag, blanket, food, basic with water to eat and sleep and even a place to piss. Of course, the tenants provided him with them.\u201cCrazy. He is a complete shut in. No, is he not moving because he is hiding something good on the land?\u201d\u201cIt is the biggest \u2018room\u2019 in Chungmuro.\u201d\u201c\u2026Room?\u201dThat reminds me, Jung Heewon still didn\u2019t know about the rooms. But there was no need for me to explain.[There is 1 hour before the third scenario is activated.]She would son find out.\u201cWe also need to find a room.\u201dThe moment our party got up, the people around us flinched.\u201cD-D-Don\u2019t come closer!\u201dIn particularly, the man with a knife who was protecting a single person room on the No. 3 line platform showed high vigilance. However, other people rushed towards him before we could approach.\u201cGet out, your fucker!\u201dThey attacked indiscriminately. As soon as the man was pushed out, the mark of the green zone changed. The owner had changed.[Green Zone 1/1->\u00a0 Green Zone 0/1].The people were engaging in a bloody fight over the room. Someone was stabbed in the thigh while someone had their nose broken.Jung Heewon frowned.\u201cShouldn\u2019t we stop that?\u201d\u201cEven if we intervene, the result will be the same. In the end, somebody will die.\u201d\u201cWhy does someone have to die?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t possible to avoid in this scenario.\u201dI had just finished speaking while Bihyung emerged in the air.[Now no, shall we start the third day of the main scenario? New faces have arrived today so won\u2019t it be fun? Hahaha!]Bihyung glanced my way.There were three dokkaebis in charge of the Chungmuro scenario. It seemed that Bihyung was temporarily the representative. It was a natural consequence of being the smallest of the three channels.Then the third scenario arrived in front of us.+[Main Scenario #3 \u2013 Green Zone (Day 3)Category: MainDifficulty: CClear Conditions: Occupy the \u2018green zone\u2019 in the station and survive the monsters that emerge every night at midnight. This scenario will last 7 days.Duration: 8 hours.Compensation: 1,000 coinsFailure: \u2015+Lee Hyunsung\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cT-This\u2026!\u201d[It is simple. Occupy the green zone before other people. Of course, you can take away the green zone of others. By the way, you should hurry. If you don\u2019t have a green zone after the scenario starts, you will have a terrible experience. Haha, then everyone should try it!]People\u2019s expressions hardened as they heard Bihyung\u2019s words. In the meantime, the screams of the people continued.Peok!\u00a0Peok!\u00a0Peok!\u201cDie! Die!\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m not doing this because I have a grudge! I must survive\u2026\u201dMaybe this was what everyone realized. The struggle in front of us was no longer a story. Yoo Sangah asked in a trembling voice.\u201cSurely we don\u2019t have to fight like these people?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t need to fight. Just find a room that can accommodate a large number of people.\u201d\u201cThe size of the green zones vary by type. It ranged from fitting only one person to fitting 70 people like Gong Pildu\u2019s area.\u201cOf course, if there are any rooms left.\u201dJung Heewon opened her mouth at my words.\u201cDokja-ssi is really talented at making people uneasy\u2026 then let\u2019s move right away. Maybe there are some rooms left.\u201d\u201cIt might be faster to split up. Divide the team. Hyunsung-ssi will move with Sangah-ssi, while Heewon-ssi should take Gilyoung.\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine on my own.\u201dI didn\u2019t have to say anything else. Everyone trusted me. Lee Gilyoung spoke first.\u201cHyung, that\u2026what if we can\u2019t find one?\u201d\u201cIf we can\u2019t find a room 20 minutes before the scenario starts, we will gather here again.\u201d\u201cI understand. Then I\u2019m going.\u201dThe team scattered in an orderly fashion. Jung Heewon and Lee Gilyoung went to B2 while Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung went to B3. I watched my companions leave before turning on the smartphone. As soon as I opened Ways of Survival, a sentence immediately popped up.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u300c There were no rooms left in Chungmuro. \u300dThis fact was written clearly. It was likely that they wouldn\u2019t be able to find any rooms.Then they could only choose one way. In order to survive, kill someone else and take their room. But could Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon do it?Not everyone here was \u2018wicked.\u2019 There were some who exploited others, like Gong Pildu. But in fact, most of them bared their teeth in order to protect themselves.Could Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung bare their teeth to people like that? I would know the answer very soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Die!\u201d[There are 30 minutes before the third scenario is activated.]As pandemonium occurred around me, I was quietly reading Ways of Survival. Perhaps today\u2019s scenario would flow as I thought. In order to survive, I couldn\u2019t miss a single word.[What are you doing now?]Along with Bihyung\u2019s words, I could hear the messages of the constellations.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is wondering what you are doing.]I reflexively turned off my smartphone. There was something I hadn\u2019t thought of until now. Why didn\u2019t the constellations respond when I read Ways of Survival?In the original Ways of Survival, the constellations discovered that Yoo Jonghyuk was a regressor and raised questions about fairness. It was normal for them to say something about the text I was reading.[What are you doing right now with a blank notepad? All the constellations are going crazy with frustration because of you!]\u2026Blank notepad?I turned on the smartphone again. Ways of Destruction appeared on the screen.\u201cIs this what you are referring to?\u201d[Yes! What are you going to do with that notepad? You will die if you stay still! Ha, I believed in a guy like this and sighed a contract\u2026]I got goosebumps.The dokkaebi couldn\u2019t read this \u2018text.\u2019 If even the dokkaebis, which managed the system, couldn\u2019t read it then the constellations were the same.Then the writer who gave me the text\u2026what type of existence was he?\u201cKuaack!\u201dThe last scream rang out. Finally, the owner of the room on platform line 3 was determined.[Green Zone 1/1]\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t come any closer.\u201dA boy was pointing a knife at me. Surprisingly, the winner was the boy who guided us earlier. I still didn\u2019t know his name.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t take your room.\u201dI spoke in order to reassure the boy. The moment I had this thought.\u201cReally? You are quite relaxed Ahjussi. Do you want to die?\u201dI didn\u2019t need to look back to see who was talking.\u201cIt looks like you are quite free.\u201d\u201cNobody touches my room. I will send everyone who touches it to hell.\u201dLee Jihye twirled a deep blue blade round and round. In regards to specs, there was no one who could match Lee Jihye apart from Yoo Jonghyuk or people from the Landlord Alliance. Lee Jihye watched me carefully and opened her mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t want Ahjussi to die. You were quite impressive against Master earlier.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t die. It won\u2019t die even if I don\u2019t find a room.\u201dIt was true. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily die if I couldn\u2019t find a room. There was an impossible man in this station who proved this. It was only three days ago.Lee Jihye\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cAhjussi, do you know what you are saying right now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAhjussi, are you strong? As strong as Master?\u201dThen Yoo Jonghyuk appeared behind Lee Jihye.\u201cStop and go back to your room.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026yup. Master.\u201dLee Jihye obediently left and Yoo Jonghyuk turned towards me.\u201cAre you going to fight the monsters?\u201dI shrugged.\u201cYou will die. Your four companions as well.\u201d\u201cThat remains to be seen.\u201dThere was an unknown emotion in Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes as he glanced at me and left. I didn\u2019t use Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint. It wasn\u2019t always possible to expression emotions with words.[There are 20 minutes before the third scenario is activated.]There was the sound of people coming down the stairs. Lee Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung and Yoo Sangah\u2026 looking at their dark expressions, the result was as I expected. Yoo Sangah opened her mouth with a gloomy expression.\u201cRoom\u2026there were non.:\u201cIt is okay. Rather, where is Heewon-ssi?\u201d\u201cShe is trying to negotiate upstairs.\u201dAt these words, Jung Heewon jumped down with a terrible scream.\u201cOne night is 2,000 coins? Are they joking right now? I am really going to hit them.\u201dThe agitated Jung Heewon snorted and said.\u201cDokja-ssi. Do you know what is happening upstairs? No\u2015\u201d\u201cThey suddenly raised the taxes right?\u201d\u201cEh\u2026you already know?\u201dIt was predictable. The tenants would die if they couldn\u2019t get a room in 20 minutes. It was no wonder that the owners would take the initiative to raise the taxes.\u201cDid Dokja-ssi find anything?\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI examined their faces one by one. In the end, the time to choose had come.\u201cI have two ways.\u201dThe eyes of the party members shone at these words. But my methods would probably betray their expectations.\u201cThe first way is easy for all of us to live.\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cUsually it is the second method\u2026 what is the other one?\u201d\u201cThe second method is very difficult. It is likely that some of us will die.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026that can\u2019t happen. Then I will choose the first way.\u201d\u201cWhat do the others think?\u201dLee Hyunsung responded first.\u201cThe first method will be good if everyone can live.\u201dLee Gilyoung nodded. Only Yoo Sangah hesitated.\u201c\u2026Can I hear what it is?\u201dI nodded and lead them up the stairs to transit line 4.\u201cThis is the first method.\u201dThe party members looked at where I pointed. There was a group of five men and women shaking.[Green Zone 5/5]\u201cThey room they occupy has exactly five spaces. But their individual abilities isn\u2019t that high. Honestly, if the five of us\u2026\u201d\u201cWait, Dokja-ssi\u2015\u201d\u201cYes, kill them and take their room.\u201dTheir trembling increased at my calm voice. Jung Heewon made a deeply wounded expression.\u201c\u2026Who doesn\u2019t know about this method?\u201d\u201cIf Hyung says so, I can do it.\u201dLee Gilyoung spoke first.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid. I will do it.\u201d\u201cNo Gilyoung!\u201dYoo Sangah grabbed Lee Gilyoung\u2019s shoulder. I deliberately looked uncaring.\u201cThey would\u2019ve also killed someone to take that room. Honestly, we can\u2019t overcome future scenarios if we can\u2019t do this.\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi.\u201d Jung Heewon interrupted. \u201cI killed people at Gumho Station. I killed because I wanted to and I don\u2019t regret it. But.\u201dJung Heewon had a pained expression on her face.\u201cJust because I am a murderer doesn\u2019t mean I want to keep killing. I don\u2019t want to be a monster.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi, I would like to know about the second method.\u201dI closed my eyes for a moment at Lee Hyunsung\u2019s words.\u201cI understand your thoughts.\u201dYes, this was enough.\u201cLet\u2019s go the second way.\u201dThe expressions of the party members seemed to brighten. In fact, I was going to use the second method from the beginning.Killing was an easy way to survive, but I could never attract the attention of the constellations if I chose the easy method.However, the second method required considerable determination. It wasn\u2019t just me but everyone. Thus, I needed to check their determination. I had to know what these people were really thinking.Jung Heewon laughed.\u201c\u2026I thought so. Why are you talking when you were going to go with the second way?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to test you. Whatever choice you made, I would\u2019ve respected it.\u201dI stroked Lee Gilyoung\u2019s head, who was looking up at me with uneasy eyes. Yoo Sangah sighed and opened her mouth.\u201cDokja-ssi is really spiteful.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not a good person.\u201d\u201cWhat is the second method?\u201d\u201cThere is no need to kill anybody with this method. But it is very difficult.\u201dAt my heavy tone, the expressions of the party members became determined.\u201cIf you choose the second method, please unconditionally follow my instructions. Please trust me, even if it doesn\u2019t make sense. If one person doesn\u2019t trust me\u2015\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWe will all die.\u201dSomeone gulped. The party members nodded almost simultaneously. Lee Hyunsung said.\u201cI believe in Dokja-ssi. I have survived up to here because of Dokja-ssi.\u201d[There are 5 minutes before the third scenario is activated.]\u201cThen follow me.\u201dI moved with the party members along railway line 3. We passed through the broken screen door and stood at the entrance of the tunnel leading to Euljiro-3.Inside the dark tunnel, I saw a glowing \u2018red zone.\u2019 Perhaps the monsters would be created over there. They would sweep over line 3 and go up each floor towards the ground.Lee Hyunsung asked nervously.\u201c\u2026Then are we fighting the monsters here?\u201d\u201cNo, we aren\u2019t fighting. If we fight here then we will die.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t possible to fight against the terrifying monsters and survive until dawn without the green zone.This time, Jung Heewon asked.\u201c\u2026Then will we run towards the Dongdae area?\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t work. Once the scenario is activated, we will automatically die if we leave Chungmuro.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cThis operation needs to be shared. Lee Hyunsung-ssi, Yoo Sangah-ssi and Jung Heewon-ssi. Once the monsters appear, run straight in the direction they are coming from.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cUnderstood? Just run towards them. Just before you encounter them, be sure to look at the left wall. Then you will know that I mean.\u201dThe people didn\u2019t understand my words but there was no time to explain to them.\u201cJust trust me or you will die. Don\u2019t forget to look at the left wall.\u201d\u201cI understand Dokja-ssi.\u201d Yoo Sangah seemed to understand what I meant and answered first.\u201cI am telling you in person. You must run after the monster appears.\u201dI picked up a stone and threw it towards the tunnel. Then stone sparked as it hit something and fell. Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon nodded as if they understood.\u201cWhat about Dokja-ssi?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll find another way with Gilyoung.\u201dThis method couldn\u2019t be used unless my party members believed in me. Who would go against common sense and commit a suicide attack by rushing towards the monsters?The only thing left was their determination.[The third main scenario is enabled.]The barrier that was blocking the tunnel to Euljiro-3 disappeared.\u201cRun!\u201dThe three people started running the moment I called out.Grrr!The monsters started to be created in the red zone. It was mainly the grade 9 ground rats. Then the middle ranks were filled with the intermediate grade 9 underground species, the \u2018groll.\u2019Kuooooh!A monster with a black mane that was in the shape of a bear. The sharp horns on their foreheads was threatening.One was relatively easy to deal with. The problem was the number. The crowded columns was already not suitable to be called a \u2018group.\u2019 We would die if we hit that wave.The moment Lee Hyunsung encountered the first groll, I shouted.\u201cNow!\u201dYoo Sangah found it first. Green tiles shimmering on the wall.\u201cAh\u2015!\u201dThe enlightenment was instant The moment Yoo Sangah\u2019s hand touched the wall, it emitted a bright light.[Green Zone 1/3]The agile Jung Heewon immediately touched the wall behind her.[Green Zone 2/3]However, Lee Hyunsung missed the timing. It was because the ground rats clung to Lee Hyunsung\u2019s shield.\u201cHyunsung-ssi! Catch it!\u201dLee Hyunsung grabbed the \u2018thread\u2019 that Yoo Sangah threw him. Thanks to the strength of the two women, Lee Hyunsung flew through the air and reached the wall.[Green Zone 3/3]Good.Grrrrrrr!The monsters stared at them but once they entered the green zones, the monsters couldn\u2019t attack.\u201cDokja-ssi!\u201dYoo Sangah called out to me but there was no time to look back. I was already running with Lee Gilyoung on my back.\u300c \u2026In the third main scenario, there are several hidden green zones. This is activated on a specific wall and the green zones on the wall won\u2019t appear until after the scenario starts\u2026 if you think about it, humans were the ones who thought of it as the concept of a \u2018room\u2019. \u300dIn Ways of Survival, Yoo Jonghyuk went through numerous regressions and found some secret green zones in Chungmuro.On the platform of line 3, there were two such green zones.Kiiiiit!A few ground rats chasing after me bit me in the thigh. The blow wasn\u2019t big because of my high strength, but these small things could accumulate.Kwack!Lee Gilyoung hit a few ground rats with a blunt weapon from his position on my back. But there were too many of them. In addition, the groll were fast.A dozen metres away, the boy was looking at me with terrified eyes.[Green Zone 1/1]It was cowardly but I was tempted to take the easy road for a second.[Hahahaha! This situation is fun. Then like yesterday, should there be a penalty?]A dokkaebi spoke followed by the system messages.[A scenario penalty has been added!][Some existing green zones will be disabled.]\u201cN-No! Uack, aaaaack!\u201dScreams rang through Chungmuro Station. The closest scream came from the boy.Kwajijijik!\u201cAaaaack!\u201dAs soon as the green zone disappeared, the boy\u2019s small body was shredded by the ground rats.Thanks to the boy\u2019s body buying time, I was able to run into the passage. However, the monsters that came from beyond the broken screen door blocked the path.I hid Lee Gilyoung behind me and pulled out Unbroken Faith. The blade of White Pure Star Energy quickly pushed back the incoming monsters.But the numbers didn\u2019t go down at all. The person who fought with these monsters until sunrise, Yoo Jonghyuk was a monster. I wasn\u2019t sure it was possible for me, even if I changed all my coins to stats.At this moment, Lee Gilyoung spoke.\u201cHyung, you know.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk now. I\u2019m busy.\u201d\u201cYou can just leave me here.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t understand it. Why are you helping me, Hyunsung hyung and the noonas? If you are alone\u2026 you would be able to survive better.\u201dHe could calmly speak such words before his death. Maybe this kid\u2019s mind was already dead.\u201cYes, you are right.\u201d Another ground rat fell to the ground with its head cut off. \u201cIt is comfortable to live alone, eat alone and survive alone. But\u2026\u201dWhy was I acting this way? If anyone asked me, I couldn\u2019t exactly explain. But I could say one thing with certainty.\u201cI know one novel that developed in such a way and was ruined.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHuh?\u201dI thought it every time but I wasn\u2019t a protagonist. I wouldn\u2019t be a hero or a savior. But\u2026Lee Gilyoung\u2019s eyes were shaking. I lifted him onto my back again and said.\u201cHold on tight.\u201dI wouldn\u2019t let Lee Gilyoung die. At least, not today.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The level 15 strength condensed at once and my feet developed a strong propulsion force.The ground rats ran from all directions and the hard horns of the grolls flew from unexpected places.My skin, which was tempered by the level 15 stamina, became bruised and bloody from the grolls\u2019 horns.[The number one bookmark has been activated.]Bookmark was activated and Kim Namwoon\u2019s Blackening wrapped around my body. I pushed away all the monsters coming from the front.Fangs burrowed into my body and a few ground rats bit my thighs. However, I didn\u2019t stop. Run and run again.Over here. Finally, the original wall was visible. I jumped over the ground rats. There was a green zone for two people shining.By the way\u2026shit.[Green Zone 1/2]There was already someone inside.\u201c\u2026\u201dI forgot about the monsters coming from behind and stared at him. There was a guy who should never be there.\u201cHey.\u201dHe turned to me.\u201cCan\u2019t you get out? You don\u2019t even need to stay in here.\u201d\u201cIt is difficult. I am tired today.\u201dI pushed to punch this asshole\u2019s face. I didn\u2019t understand. This wasn\u2019t the \u2018third regression\u2019 Yoo Jonghyuk that I knew.In Ways of Survival, it was written that Yoo Jonghyuk only found the first hidden green zone in the fourth regression\u2026 damn, did he know about this place since the second regression and it just wasn\u2019t described? Then why didn\u2019t he originally use it in the third regression?Grrrr!There were the cries of the ground rats chasing me from behind. It was too late to blame the writer. I could feel Lee Gilyoung\u2019s breathing. I stared into Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes. We spoke at almost the same time.\u201cTake the kid.\u201d\u201cGive me the child.\u201dStill, it was lucky. The constellations would hear my words.[Green Zone 2/2]I moved Lee Gilyoung and the mark of the green zone changed. Now Lee Gilyoung was safe.\u201cHyung! Wait a minute! Hyung!\u201dLee Gilyoung urgently tried to rush towards me but Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s hand restrained him. I swung my sword towards the ground rats.[The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 has closed his eyes.][The constellation Demon-like Judge of Fire is watching you with uncomfortable eyes.]At the last minute, Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes seemed to move.\u300c I told you that you would die. \u300dThe waves of monsters headed towards me. Now there were no more green zones remaining.\u201cI won\u2019t die.\u201dI ignored the monsters and put a hand in my pocket. In fact, I really didn\u2019t want to use this. I couldn\u2019t be assured that there would be no aftereffects. Now I had to believe in the Fourth Wall.\u300c That\u2026? \u300dYoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes shook with surprise. This bastard, did he find out? Well, I wouldn\u2019t have known this method without him.I looked down at the white stone shining in the palm of my hand.[Specter\u2019s Stone.]It was an item I gained by hunting specters on the way to Chungmuro.Hundreds of ground rats started biting at my body.I was bleeding from minor wounds and the shoulders struck by the grolls\u2019 horns were red with blood. As the durability of my body rapidly diminished, I put the stone into my mouth.Then something like water vapor started to emerge from my mouth. The water vapor formed a fog that covered me.[The Welcome Prison is activated.]The ground rats and grolls stopped attacking me at once.Everything around me started to distort. The platform, Yoo Jonghyuk and Lee Gilyoung calling out to me.I became a \u2018ghost.\u2019*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u300c Dokja. \u300dI noticed as soon as I heard my mother\u2019s voice. This was a dream.I tried not to get caught up in it but it wasn\u2019t easy this time. The floor sank like a quagmire and swallowed me.[Due to excessive immersion, the influence of Fourth Wall has temporarily weakened.]Scenes started to weave in front of me, no matter what I wanted.A living room covered with blood. The cold body of a man. The back of a woman looking down at the body. No. This memory was difficult to remember. I couldn\u2019t remember it.I shook my head furiously and the scene in front of me scattered. This damn trauma\u2026It was a memory I didn\u2019t want to see.This was why I was reluctant to eat the Specter\u2019s Stone. The Specter\u2019s Stone temporarily made the user a \u2018ghost\u2019 and turned them invisible to monsters. But it has a side effect of causing the user\u2019s trauma to peak.That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t give it to the other party members. If it had been used by someone other than myself, they might\u2019ve turned into a madman.I had to endure, even if my head was hurting like crazy.Certainly, the Fourth Wall was a scam. The skill would even be able to eat away at this stone. I wouldn\u2019t see this effect even with the superior \u2018Mental Barrier.\u2019 Where was it? If my guess was correct, this skill\u2026\u300c Yoo Jonghyuk? Are you Yoo Jonghyuk? \u300dI thought a trauma had started again but it wasn\u2019t my voice. It wasn\u2019t a voice created by my memories. I looked back and saw a strange woman.\u300c \u2026You aren\u2019t Yoo Jonghyuk. I think you are Korean but who are you? \u300dA dazzling blonde foreigner. She was a little girl with a short height. The girl looked at me for a long time with an incomprehensible expression.\u300c That\u2026I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve seen the future a number of times but I\u2019ve never seen you before\u2026 \u300dIn the girl\u2019s left eye, an ominous red swirl could be seen. The pages flashed in my head. I knew this person. No, there was absolutely no way I couldn\u2019t know her. In this case\u2026[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.][The character \u2018Anna Croft\u2019 is using \u2018Mental Barrier Lv. 6\u2019.][Character List ignores Mental Barrier Lv. 6.][There is too much information about this person.

Who are you? \u300dHer small lips were tightly closed. It looked as though she was protesting.I anticipated how the situation would roughly occur. The woman noticed my presence, perhaps because the influence of Fourth Wall temporarily weakened. If Fourth Wall was really the skill I thought it was\u2026By the way\u2026 it was disappointing.\u201cDo you really not know who I am?\u201d\u300c \u2026Huh? \u300d\u201cDidn\u2019t I send you the ichthyosaur\u2019s core?\u201dAnna\u2019s lips slowly widened.\u201cYou must\u2019ve implanted the \u2018great demon\u2019s eyes\u2019 with the power of the core.

Wait across the continent.\u201d[The exclusive skill Fourth Wall has been completely restored.]Anna completely disappeared.I sighed with relief. In fact, my spirit had been fluctuating back and forth when talking to Anna Croft. It wasn\u2019t very good.[Due to the skill effect, immunity to Welcome Prison has occurred.]\u2026Dammit, the effect took place too late.I felt my consciousness clear up.The discomfort still remained but it was much better than before. I took a deep breath and slowly exhaled. I looked at the distinct facts one by one in order to regain my rationality.I am Kim Dokja. The world was destroyed. Ways of Survival had become reality. This was\u2026Welcome Prison. I ate the Specter\u2019s Stone and was a ghost for a while. If I was a ghost, I wouldn\u2019t be attacked by the underground species.Yes, that\u2019s right. So\u2026 the world looked like this.In the midst of the landscape that seemed like I had eaten drugs, the flow of time was hardly noticeable. I became a bit uneasy.What happened to Yoo Sangah, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon? That Jonghyuk bastard, did he kill Gilyoung? Was the third scenario still in progress? What if there were still ground rats around? Were the grolls circling in order to eat me?If so\u2026\u2026Hyung.\u2026Please.\u2026Dokja-ssi!Voices flashed through my head.[The exclusive skill \u2018Permanent Lv. 1\u2019 is activated.](TL: Temporary name.

We did it.I looked at the agitated party members and tried to move my body. I had remained stiff for a long time and my muscles barely listened to me.\u201cDon\u2019t be\u2026pleased.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cOnly one day has passed. Yesterday was the third day\u2026\u201dLee Hyunsung caught me as I tried to get up.\u201cDokja-ssi! It isn\u2019t possible.

By the way, there was a face missing.\u201cWhere is Gilyoung?\u201d\u201cAh, Gilyoung\u2026\u201dBefore Jung Heewon spoke, I already discovered where Jung Heewon was. Lee Jihye and Yoo Jonghyuk were looking down at Lee Gilyoung a few steps away.\u2026No, what was that bastard Yoo Jonghyuk doing?At this moment, I remembered how Yoo Jonghyuk was surprised when he saw my party. Don\u2019t tell me, when Yoo Jonghyuk used Sage\u2019s Eyes\u2026?\u201cWhen\u2026 you have chosen? Obvious never\u2026before.\u201dDue to the aftereffects of using the stone, Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t heard properly. Then Lee Gilyoung started talking.\u201cIt is okay.\u201d\u201c\u2026You really won\u2019t go with me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou can become much stronger with me than with him.

What was he talking about?I had to think\u2026 Damn, I\u2019m too tired.

It was a sweet sleep without any dreams.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0*I woke up two hours later.[Hey, how long are you going to sleep?]I opened my eyes at the loud and unpleasant voice. This time, the texture against my cheek was much thicker and harder than before.\u201c\u2026Ah, Dokja-ssi woke up.\u201dSmiling lips. Jung Heewon was looking down at me.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi took a break. We didn\u2019t sleep well last night.\u201dI turned my head and saw Yoo Sangah sleeping against a wall. Jung Heewon smiled.\u201cBy the way, is Lee Hyunsung\u2019s thigh comfortable?\u201dI turned and saw Lee Hyunsung drooling.\u201cToday in the morning\u2026 the on-call officer will conduct the duties\u2026\u201d\u2026I thought the height of the pillow wasn\u2019t right. It turned out to be Lee Hyunsung\u2019s thigh. It was an army pillow with a bloody smell.\u201cDokja hyung\u2026\u201dI felt a heavy feeling on my stomach and looked down to see Lee Gilyoung leaning against me and sleeping.The moment I carefully raised my body, I heard Bihyung\u2019s voice.[Haha, you are awake?

Unfortunately, there was no detailed description of the location of the green zones on day four in Ways of Survival.\u201cThen\u2026\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s expression became dark. But it was unnecessary worry.\u201cToday we will completely end the third scenario.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dI carefully laid Lee Gilyoung and got up.It wasn\u2019t originally planned but I couldn\u2019t wait after hearing Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s thoughts.

It is a skill that understands people well.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know if I want to ask, so I won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cBut have you ever used it on me?\u201dI almost showed emotions on my face. It was fortunate that Jung Heewon didn\u2019t have Lie Detection. I looked at Lee Gilyoung and said.\u201cI only use it on men.\u201d\u201cOh my.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a lie. I haven\u2019t read Jung Heewon\u2019s heart. So far.\u201cAnyway, I am asking everyone to do this. First is Jung Heewon-ssi, then Yoo Sangah and Gilyoung is last. Please take it in turns to speak to him.\u201d\u201c\u2019Oh my, I really believe in Hyunsung-ssi!\u2019 That type of feeling?\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t go so far.\u201d\u201cSigh, I am really going to die.\u201dStill, she needed to do it. In order for this plan to succeed, Lee Hyunsung\u2019s \u2018attribute evolution\u2019 was absolutely necessary. I would\u2019ve planned a bit sooner if I knew Yoo Jonghyuk would act like this\u2026 but if we tried hard, I should be able to see the result today.In fact, they seemed to be doing well.\u201cHyunsung-ssi is really dependable. You are like a pine tree.\u201d\u201cHaha, thank you Heewon-ssi. My favourite song is Green Pine.\u201d[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 feels proud.]\u201cI didn\u2019t ask.\u201d[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 feels a bit sullen.]\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a righteous person like Hyunsung-ssi.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 that isn\u2019t the case. Still, thank you. Yoo Sangah-ssi.\u201d[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has started to worry about justice.]\u201cHyunsung hyung has the best muscles.\u201d\u201cThank you, everyone.\u201d[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has increased his self-esteem.]It was fortunate that Lee Hyunsung was a simple person and such empty praises worked well. After repeating the same conversation several times like this, the system messages started to change.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 is waiting for a chance to evolve his attribute.]Okay. It went smoothly.Yoo Sangah asked in a slightly worried tone. \u201cBut I think Hyunsung-ssi is a bit burdened\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah was really nice. Even in this situation, she was concerned about someone else\u2019s heart. I didn\u2019t have that ability.\u201cMaybe a bit. But It is necessary. There are some people in the world who become stronger as they carry more burdens.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. And\u2026Gilyoung, did you do what I asked?\u201d\u201cYes Hyung.\u201dLee Gilyoung replied from next to Yoo Sangah. On his head, there was a pair of small cockroaches like they were antennae.\u201cThat noona, she is on B1.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dLee Hyunsung was good. Now it was time to steal the power of others.I walked up the stairs alone. The people of the Landlord Alliance welcomed me as I went up.\u201cHaha, who is this? If it isn\u2019t the illegal tenant.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are coming up here after doing well. Did you really survive yesterday without a room? Did Yoo Jonghyuk help you?\u201dI ignored them and kept walking. The Landlord Alliance members kept talking, as if they thought I was scared.\u201cIsn\u2019t it hard to live with Yoo Jonghyuk? Enter our alliance. Pildu-ssi said he would let you.\u201dI didn\u2019t care and counted the remaining green zones on every floor. One, two, three\u2026 in order for this plan to succeed, I couldn\u2019t miss a single one.\u201cOf course, under the condition that you bring both women.\u201dNow there were 11 green zones remaining. The number had reduced a lot after yesterday\u2019s scenario. It was a close number to carry out the plan.\u201cHey, are you ignoring me now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m listening. Tell him I\u2019m thinking about it.\u201dThe alliance members looked at each other and chuckled at my words. They could laugh like that now.I was walking up the escalator when a blade suddenly reached my neck. I felt very few signs it was coming\u2026 there was only one skill that boasted this type of concealed movements in the beginning.[Ghost Walk.]\u201cI\u2019m disappointed, Ahjussi.\u201dLee Jihye. A proud girl with outstanding fighting skills. She wasn\u2019t chosen by the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare for nothing.\u201cAhjussi, don\u2019t you know what will happen to those women if you make a deal with them?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cDo you really know? Yesterday, wouldn\u2019t you rather die?\u201dI shrugged.\u201cPut away the sword. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d\u201cTalk? You came to find me on purpose.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLee Jihye put away the sword. I followed behind Lee Jihye. Lee Jihye walked from B1 to the ticket barrier at the entrance. We seemed to walk for a while.\u201cWhat did you want to talk about?\u201d\u201cBut why are you standing there?\u201d\u201cMaster told me to defend this place.\u201d\u201c\u2026Defend?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t let you pass.\u201dLee Jihye touched the ticket gate and drew her hand across her neck. I looked at the passage beyond the ticket gate. There were exit numbers leading to the ground. But not all numbers led to the ground. At that moment, I had an ominous feeling.\u2026That Yoo Jonghyuk, surely he wasn\u2019t trying that route?If Yoo Jonghyuk wanted to protect this place, there was only one reason.As the scenario was in progress, he was secretly trying to attack the \u2018hidden dungeon\u2019 of Chungmuro. Hidden dungeon attack. It sounded good. In fact, it wasn\u2019t bad if the main character became stronger.The problem was that this dungeon was a place that Yoo Jonghyuk couldn\u2019t clear until the end of the third regression. It looked like I should finish this quickly.\u201cI need your help.\u201d\u201cMy help?\u201d\u201cToday, I will shatter Gong Pildu\u2019s party.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you serious?\u201dLee Jihye looked at me like she was trying to see my heart.[Your understanding of the character \u2018Lee Jihye\u2019 has increased.]\u201cAhjussi isn\u2019t strong enough. You won\u2019t be able to get rid of them.\u201d\u201cEven if you help me?\u2019Lee Jihye\u2019s head jerked like her pride was damaged.It was natural. Lee Jihye had already challenged Gong Pildu the first day she came to this station. Then she ran away. If Yoo Jonghyuk hadn\u2019t appeared to rescue her, she would be dead.\u201cI have a way. I can do it if you help me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Master told me to stay here.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t help, most of the people here will die.\u201d\u201cPeople will die anyway.\u201d\u201cDid Yoo Jonghyuk say that?\u201dLee Jihye\u2019s eyes shook.\u201cThe boy we talked to yesterday is dead. Do you understand?\u201d\u201c\u2026I know.\u201d\u201cMaybe he could\u2019ve lived. Then today, he would be rushing at us to tell us about Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cYoo Jonghyuk killed him. He could\u2019ve saved him.\u201dI felt complicated while talking. I noticed that I wasn\u2019t much different from Yoo Jonghyuk. The subway, Gumho Station\u2026 I ignored people I might\u2019ve been able to save because my safety was being threatened.But hypocrites could speak plausible words.\u201cI saw the video of your scenario when I was on the subway.\u201dLee Jihye\u2019s small shoulders shook.\u201cIt was a video where you killed your friend to survive.\u201d\u201c\u2026Stop.\u201d\u201cIn fact, you didn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d[The character \u2018Lee Jihye\u2019 is greatly disturbed.]\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d\u201cI know what I know. Of course I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just talking to myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut since I am talking, I wanted to say this. If you turn away today, you will regret it for the rest of your life. Definitely.\u201d[The character \u2018Lee Jihye\u2019 has fallen into deep agony.]I didn\u2019t know the \u2018human\u2019 Lee Jihye but I knew the \u2018character\u2019 Lee Jihye. This girl was a loyal subordinate of Yoo Jonghyuk. But that was a story for the future, not now. She admired Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s strength but she was essentially different from Yoo Jonghyuk.Lee Jihye opened her mouth a few minutes later.\u201cIf I help, people can live?\u201d\u201cNot everyone, but some will survive.\u201d\u201c\u2026What should I do?\u201d\u201cI will start at 7 o\u2019clock this evening.\u201dI told her the plan. In order to implement this plan, Lee Jihye needed to do the things I told her.Lee Jihye stared blankly and opened her mouth.\u201cAre you sane? You will really do this?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026Honestly, I don\u2019t think it will work. I\u2019ll tell you in advance. I don\u2019t think I can help.\u201d\u201cThe choice is yours.\u201dShe said this but Lee Jihye would surely move.

Every member was checking their weapons. Lee Hyunsung seemed to have handled it properly.\u201cI did as Dokja-ssi asked.\u201dSince the weapons they had used so far were very old, I asked Lee Hyunsung to produce new weapons. The materials were from the grade 8 underground species, the groll that were killed in the struggle last night. The blades and spears were made by cutting the horns of the groll. They weren\u2019t long enough but they were appropriate as a temporary measure.Jung Heewon smiled like she was satisfied.\u201cIsn\u2019t this much lighter and durable?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Dokja-ssi, Hyunsung-ssi. Thank you very much.\u201dYoo Sangah bowed. The groll\u2019s horn couldn\u2019t be used to make a blunt weapon so only Lee Gilyoung was still carrying a weapon from a ground rat. Lee Gilyoung was silently gazing at the ground. This sulking child\u2026 I stroked his head and said.\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy. This situation can be more dangerous than yesterday. Are you all ready?\u201dThe party members nodded.\u201cThen we will start.\u201dFrom now on, it was a fight against time. We had to work as quickly as possible before the Landlord Alliance noticed the situation. Jung Heewon, Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung disappeared to their respective floors for their missions, while I started climbing the stairs with Lee Hyunsung.Lee Hyunsung spoke in a voice without any confidence.\u201cDokja-ssi, I am unsure.\u201d\u2026He was the core of this operation. He shouldn\u2019t be talking like this. I deliberately answered in a strong voice.\u201cIt will be fine.\u201dHowever, Lee Hyunsung\u2019s face was still timid.\u201cI think that people are relying on me more than they should. I\u2019m not sure I can do well.\u201d\u201cHyunsung-ssi is a dependable person.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you for saying so. In fact, this is my first experience. When I was in the army, I never got someone\u2019s trust like this.\u201dIt was the first time I\u2019ve heard this story. That reminded me, I didn\u2019t really know about Lee Hyunsung\u2019s army life. Ways of Survival only mentioned it in passing.\u201cOnce this is over, I want to hear Hyunsung-ssi\u2019s story.\u201dI said it casually but Lee Hyunsung was more shaken than I thought.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has started to open his heart to you.][Your understanding of the character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has greatly increased.]\u201cSometimes I feel strange when talking to Dokja-ssi.\u201d\u201cHuh? Why\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt seems like you knew me from a long time ago\u2026 I can\u2019t explain it well\u2026\u201d Lee Hyunsung scratched his head and trailed off. \u201cAh, I don\u2019t mean anything strange. I just\u2026\u201d\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d\u201cThank you. I\u2019m also curious about Dokja-ssi\u2019s story.\u201d\u201cMy story?\u201d\u201cYes. I have never seen a person like Dokja-ssi before. I\u2019m curious about what you did before this happened.\u201dSomehow, I felt a bit strange. The \u2018supporting cast\u2019 of the novel I read was curious about me. I had a bit uncomfortable and had an itchy feeling.\u201cIt isn\u2019t very interesting.\u201d\u201cI still want to hear it.\u201dSuddenly, a question popped into my head.If Ways of Survival hadn\u2019t become reality, would Lee Hyunsung be living in the same world as me? Or did the novel suddenly emerge as a reality? I didn\u2019t know. One thing was for sure. Lee Hyunsung was now a \u2018living person\u2019 in front of me.\u201cOh, Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s friend. Did you come to negotiate?\u201dAt this time, a number of middle-aged men came forward. Chungmuro\u2019s Landlord Alliance.\u201cHmm\u2026but where are the women?\u201dThe middle-aged man who spoke was holding a woman by her hair. She was part of the group that had been in the five spaces green zone just yesterday. The man laughed at my gaze.\u201cAhh, this friend didn\u2019t see her land\u2026 This matter doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d\u201cS-Save me. Help me!\u201dThe woman was gazing at me pitifully. In my head, the constellations of the \u2018absolute good\u2019 started clamoring. But I waited. It was because I had someone who would act instead of me.\u201cLet her go.\u201dIt was Lee Hyunsung.\u201cWho are you?\u201dLee Hyunsung looked at me after the middle-aged man\u2019s question. It was like he was asking for permission. I nodded.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 wants to practice justice of his own will.][The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 is about to evolve.]The allied members pulled out their weapons and exerted a tremendous momentum.

A big and small uproar followed. It was the signal.\u201cHyunsung-ssi!\u201dLee Hyunsung nodded. We ran forward towards the men in the front row. The confused alliance members shouted.\u201cWhat, you bastards!\u201d[The exclusive skill \u2018White Pure Star Energy\u2019 has been activated.]Sukakak!\u201cKyaaak!\u201dThe arm of the middle-aged man holding the woman\u2019s head flew away. The middle-aged men froze at the blood that emerged. Lee Hyunsung and I ignored them and kept running. The middle-aged men belatedly chased after us.\u201cThese crazy guys! Stop them!\u201dA corridor on B2. It was the private land of Gong Pildu.[You have invaded private property!]\u201cSurround them!\u201dThe alliance members waiting in front discovered us. Some of the alliance members were missing, so there were less than expected. 20 in the back, 12 in the back. However, it was still a lot of people.Well, I had no intention of dealing with all of them.The moment I was about to clash with the alliance members, Lee Hyunsung moved ahead of me with a steel shield.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has used the stigma \u2018Great Mountain Push Lv. 1.\u2019]Kwakakakak!Lee Hyunsung used his tremendous muscle strength and they fell like dominoes.[The character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 has activated \u2018Armed Zone Lv. 4!]Turrets started to rise from all over the territory. The turrets were charged with red magic bullets and were prepared to fire. There were five mini-turrets. The level of Armed Zone had rised again.\u201cDokja-ssi!\u201dI overtook Lee Hyunsung and at the same time, I received his shield. As soon as the solid shield entered my hand, a stunning shock from a bullet pushed me away.Kwang!\u00a0Kwaang!\u00a0Kwaang!It was heavy, as if I was hit by a cannon.

He looked uneasy and irritated, but there was also a firm determination not to retreat.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has evolved.]There was a blinding light and silver aura started to appear around Lee Hyunsung\u2019s bdoy.I was a bit emotional at the sight.

Maybe the constellations in the channel with Gong Pildu would be in a frenzy right now.\u2018What channel is Gong Pildu in?\u2019[\u2026Biryu\u2019s channel.

That\u2019s why their broadcasts were radical. Great. Then the response within the channel would be much hotter than expected. Everyone would\u2019ve eaten the sweet potatoes properly.I headed down the stairs of the transfer corridor to line 4 and saw a welcome face. The blade was moving through the air.\u201cYou broke them?\u201d\u201cYes. It was easy.\u201dLee Jihye\u2019s role was to take out the green zones that contained five to eight people. It was a task that Jung Heewon would find hard to do alone. Indeed, she was Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s disciple and was the incarnation of the sage hero. Now there were no more green zones left in Chungmuro.\u201cNow what? Those jerks will come running wildly. Ah, there they are.\u201dLee Jihye\u2019s expression twisted as she looked behind me.\u201cI\u2019m not going to help you this time.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201dJung Heewon scowled as she watched Lee Jihye retreating.\u201cWhat is with her?\u201dCome to think of it, Jung Heewon didn\u2019t know about Lee Jihye. But there was no time to tell her.[Haha\u2026 you are fucked now.]A message was heard along with Bihyung\u2019s words.[A bounty scenario has occurred!]+[Bounty Scenario \u2013 Assassination Commission]Category: SubDifficulty: CClear Conditions: The constellations of Channel #BIR-3642 have requested to kill a certain person. Please kill \u2018Kim Dokja\u2019 of Chungmuro Station.Time Limit: 10 minutes.Compensation: 2,000 coins.Failure: None+I thought this situation would unfold. It was going to be a lot of fun. Now all the incarnations in the region would gather on the platform of line 3 to catch me. Jung Heewon asked by his side.\u201cI will receive 2,000 coins if I kill Dokja-ssi right now?\u201d\u201cWhy, are you going to kill me?\u201d\u201cAye, perhaps. If you give me 200,000 coins then I don\u2019t know.\u201dDoes this girl know how much 200,000 coins were worth?\u201cDokja-ssi. Go behind me.\u201dLee Hyunsung stepped out ahead of me. Jung Heewon stayed beside me while Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung moved to block any access. It was a defense formed around me. Jung Heewon smiled.\u201cNow I can pay back my debt.\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi, we\u2019ll try to block it somehow.\u201dThere were people showing hostility around us. The angry landowners and the tenants were blinded by the bounty quest. I watched Lee Gilyoung holding the weapon and opened my mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous.\u201dI lightly stroked Lee Gilyoung\u2019s shoulder and moved towards the railway tracks.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to fight them.\u201dIt was a few turns. I had read about such a scene. I didn\u2019t have time to check which regression it was but Yoo Jonghyuk had destroyed the green zones as soon as he arrived at Chungmuro.Even then, it was like the current situation.[All green zones in this region have been destroyed and the main scenario has collapsed.][The difficulty is automatically adjusted according to the remaining schedule of the scenario.][The scenario content is updated!]+[Main Scenario #3 \u2013 Emergency Defense]Category: MainDifficulty: B-Clear Conditions: All the green zones in the region are destroyed and the monsters that were going to be created in the remaining days have suddenly run wild.

In other words, it was simple.[The emergency defense has begun!]The defense game had started.\u201cW-What?\u201dThe people approaching me started screaming. The cries of monsters were heard from outside the screen door. The feast of monsters moved like an angry wave.\u201cCrazy! What the hell is this?\u201dThe platform of line 3 quickly became a mess. The faces of the people became speculative as they watched the monsters coming from all sides. The bounty scenario was completely forgotten about.Grrrr!A few grolls ran and bit some of the alliance members. The upset people were shouting.Now was the only chance. I shouted to my party.\u201cGo to the transfer route!\u201dI started jumping up the transit stairs with my friends. By the time we reached the upper level, people were blocking the path.\u201cWhat? Get out of the way!\u201d\u201cDo you want to fall?\u201dI kicked some of the followers and pulled out a blade. The people were surprised by the White Pure Star Energy blade and backed away.\u201cYou haven\u2019t grasped the situation yet.\u201d\u201cW-What?\u201d\u201cEven if you come up, you won\u2019t be able to survive.\u201dThere was a sense of despair in the expressions of the people. There were no more rooms. Now there were no more safe zones from the monsters in Chungmuro.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\u201cWhat else? Fight.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t speak crazy words! This is all because of you! If you hadn\u2019t broken our rooms\u2026!\u201dI triggered the Blade of Faith and used it on the transfer stairs.Kwarurung!\u201cUwaaaaack!\u201dThe centre of the staircase fell with a large sound, along with the people. It was cruel but necessary.\u201cCrazy! Quickly find another staircase! Quickly!\u201dWell, I don\u2019t think it would happen.Lee Hyunsung was already running. I smashed the transit stairs we came up on and there was only one staircase remaining. Subsequently, the sound of arguing and something breaking was heard on the other side.\u201cShit! Waaah!\u201dThe cries of the people trapped on the platform of line 3 were heard. Lee Jihye approached me and asked.\u201cAhjussi. This isn\u2019t what you told me. If you leave it like this\u2026\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dI looked at the lower floor that was becoming pandemonium. If I left it like this, they would all be killed. Whether it was from the monsters or using each other\u2019s bodies as a stepping stone to come upstairs.This wasn\u2019t what I wanted.[The exclusive skill \u2018Bookmark\u2019 can now be activated.][\u2018Character Bookmarks\u2019 is activated.][Available Bookmark Slots: 3][Bringing up the list of available bookmarks.][People Listed in the Bookmark Slots]I activated the third bookmark.[The number three bookmark has been activated.][The level of the Bookmark skill is low, shortening the activation time.][Activation Time:\u00a0 5 minutes.][Your understanding of the character is low, so only a part of the character\u2019s skill is activated.][Incite Lv.2 has been activated.]Suddenly, it felt like my tongue was coming alive on its own. This was how Cheon Inho felt. I looked downstairs. In the middle of the mess, I could see a middle-aged man.\u201cHey Gong Pildu. How long are you going to stand there?\u201dGong Pildu glared at me.\u201cThis dog\u2026!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you have to act in order to live? If you move, everyone else can live.\u201dThe power of Incite permeated the ears of all the frightened people.\u201cP-Pildu-ssi!\u201d\u201cP-Pildu-ssi, please save us!\u201dGong Pildu\u2019s expression distorted. I felt good. This was what Cheon Inho would\u2019ve felt at Gumho Station.\u201cThe third scenario isn\u2019t as hard as you think. Once everyone gives up on the rooms and participates in the defense, there are enough people to handle the monsters.\u201dMy words were half true. If Chungmuro had united before I arrived here, there would be far less victims. After all, the biggest pitfall of this scenario was the green zone.\u201cIf Gong Pildu fights with the people, you can survive.\u201dThose who fight together would survive, those who ran away would die.[The sponsor behind Lee Jihye agrees with your wisdom.][The constellation \u2018Maritime War God\u2019 nods his head.]\u201cNow there are no rooms for you to run away to. Forget about whether you are a landlord or tenant and fight. Or you will all die.\u201dThe more urgent the situation was, the more the effect of Incite would increase.\u201cDamn, this fucking guy\u2026!\u201d\u201cPildu-ssi! Please help us!\u201dThe alliance members gathered around Gong Pildu. If he ran away here alone, Gong Pildu\u2019s Landlord Alliance would collapse. In the end Gong Pildu made his decision.\u201cDammit\u2026 Everybody gather here!\u201dThe people downstairs started gathering around Gong Pildu.\u201cI need time to install a new Armed Zone. Everybody just hang on!\u201dThe key was Gong Pildu\u2019s Armed Zone. However, the weak point was that Armed Zone took time to install every time it moved.Blood splattered everywhere and people screamed as their limbs were torn off.\u201cAaaagh!\u201dAs expected, the first ones who abandoned the formation were the tenants, not the alliance members.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes. Please leave it to me.\u201dI didn\u2019t need to explain it. Yoo Sangah already understood what she needed to do.Her Binding Thread stretched out and started to rescue the people who couldn\u2019t fight anymore. In any case, their mission was to buy time for Gong Pildu to deploy Armed Zone.\u201cU-Uhh\u2026 t-thank you.\u201dThe tenants hung from the threat and were pulled upstairs.The rescued tenants were shaking as they wrapped up their injured area. In the meantime, some of the people with weapons carefully looked at me. I smiled at them and said.\u201cOh, do you want the bounty?\u201d[The time limit for the bounty scenario has expired.][The bounty hanging on Kim Dokja has been destroyed.]\u201cSorry, it is too late.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe tenants seemed ashamed as they put away their weapons.

The red magic bullets condensed in a short time and started firing.Dududududu!Kwang!\u00a0Kwaang!\u00a0Kwaang!The ground rats screamed as they were hit by the bombardment of magic bullets while the grolls came to a halt. The group of people cried out.\u201cAs expected of Pildu-ssi!\u201d\u201cWahhhh!\u201dIt was truly Gong Pildu. In a defense type scenario, there was no incarnation that surpassed a player\u2019s combat effectiveness.The 10 Evils weren\u2019t called that for nothing.\u201cAll of you damn scum disappear!\u201dThe agitated Gong Pildu randomly fired. Lee Hyunsung spoke with admiration.\u201cIt is a really tremendous stigma. Is it okay when the magic power consumption is so big?\u201d\u201cIt is a good stigma so it will be okay for a while.\u201d\u201cShould we help\u2026?\u201d\u201cGong Pildu alone is sufficient. If we do down then he will be distracted and stop shooting.\u201dThe Defense Master sponsor behind Gong Pildu was completely suited for this type of scenario. As long as he supported Gong Pildu, Gong Pildu wouldn\u2019t die here. As long as the sponsorship continued.I sat down and stretched out my legs.\u201cWe will be sucking honey for a while.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is it time for personal maintenance already?\u201dLee Hyunsung sat down with me and the party members started to relax one by one. Jung Heewon asked.\u201cThank you. I didn\u2019t get enough sleep\u2026 can I sleep now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d10 minutes later, Jung Heewon was lying on the ground and snoring. I said yes but I really didn\u2019t know how she could sleep so easily.\u201cA-Aren\u2019t we too easygoing?\u201dYoo Sangah sounded concerned. Indeed, it would be confusing. There wasn\u2019t a \u2018scenario\u2019 like this so far. In fact, all we did was survive the brink of a crisis.\u201cThink of it as standing on the right line.\u201d\u201cThen over there\u2026\u201d\u201cThey got the wrong line.\u201dThe confusion on the lower level had almost died down because of Gong Pildu.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDududududu!\u201cUwaaaaah!\u201dHe should\u2019ve lived a better life.\u201cFuck!

The number of monsters had barely decreased but it was still great. Gong Pildu was considered to have the strongest defense among the 10 Evils for a reason.\u201cYou scum!\u201d[The character Gong Pildu\u2019s Armed Zone has levelled up.[The character Gong Pildu\u2019s Private Land has levelled up!][The character Gong Pildu has acquired the Protective Wall skill.]The level up speed of Armed Zone was fast. The sponsor behind Gong Pildu was rushing to support his growth. If he could survive here, Gong Pildu\u2019s growth would be enormous.As long as he could survive here.\u201cUhweeeh\u2026!\u201dAccording to the scenario, Gong Pildu had to hold on for seven more hours. It would\u2019ve been nice if I had popcorn. Too bad.Lee Jihye was giggling next to me as she watched the bottom floor. She told me earlier that I should save them\u2026 it was truly a transformation in the disposition of Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s disciple.\u201cBy the way, why isn\u2019t Yoo Jonghyuk here?\u201cHow should I know? Master is always busy.\u201dBusy\u2026 yes, he might be busy. The person trying to be all alone was the busiest.I looked down at the dying Gong Pildu as I asked, \u201cWhat time did Yoo Jonghyuk enter the dungeon?\u201d\u201cIt is roughly 9 a.m. today\u2026\u201d Lee Jihye stopped speaking and stared at me. \u201c\u2026Wait a minute, how do you know that Master entered a dungeon?\u201dI ignored Lee Jihye and calculated the time. Now it was 8 p.m. Using simple calculations, it had already been over 11 hours since Yoo Jonghyuk entered. Yet he still hadn\u2019t come out\u2026Damn, I had to move. Yoo Jonghyuk was the main character and it would be difficult if something happened to him.I opened the dokkaebi communication.\u2018Bihyung.\u2019Bihyung floating in the air turned to look at me.[What is it? Calling me so suddenly.]\u2018Open the Dokkaebi Bag.\u2019[What? N-No! I am currently getting a lot of subscriptions!]I know. My stock price was rising due to my actions with Gong Pildu. My actions of laying a trap and then sitting back meant the constellations of the \u2018fun seekers\u2019 group wouldn\u2019t still be on the channel which Gong Pildu belonged to.Where would the constellations go after leaving the channel?[New constellations have entered the channel!]It was naturally Bihyung\u2019s channel.[#BI-7623 channel is ready for an expansion.][Huhu, huhuhut, look at this, look at this! Now my channel is also\u2026!]It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for Bihyung to be acting like this. But this wasn\u2019t the time for amusement.\u2018If you don\u2019t want your channel to be ruined, open it quickly. You can see that there will be an advertisement in preparation for the channel expansion.\u2019[Ah, shit\u2026 really\u2026]Bihyung grumbled but opened the Dokkaebi Bag after showing an advertisement. It was finally time to use the coins I had saved.\u2018I\u2019ll give you 5,000 coins. Upgrade me to a gold member.\u2019Bihyung stared at me quietly and sighed. It was followed by system messages.[5,000 coins have been consumed.][Congratulations! You have become a gold member of the Dokkaebi Bag!]My member rating changed and the background of the Dokkaebi Bag also changed. Coins were really good. New item listings were added. I put the necessary items into the shopping cart.* Behind the Scenes Contract \u2013 10,000 C.* Intermediate Magic Power Recovery Potion X 10 \u2013 5,000 C.One contract and 10 intermediate potions\u2026 this should be enough.The spending was a bit big but the channel was going to be expanded. It wouldn\u2019t be long before I recovered it. Bihyung was nervous when he saw the items I bought.[\u2026Why is there a contract? Have you already forgotten the terms? You can\u2019t have a sponsor!]\u2018What do you mean? Why would I get a sponsor now?\u2019\u2019Even if I was doing that, why would I buy the contract with my own coins? At any rate, this Bihyung still needed a lot of work.[15,000 coins have been consumed.][A \u2018Behind the Scenes Contract\u2019 has been acquired.][10 Intermediate Magic Power Recovery Potions have been acquired.]Yoo Sangah showed curiosity when the items appeared out of thin air.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cA contract to make a \u2018gap\u2019 an \u2018eul.\u2019\u201dI filled out the contract carefully, wrote my name in the \u2018gap\u2019 section and waited quietly. It was time for the \u2018eul\u2019 to come.[The sponsor for character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 is asking for help from nearby constellations.]Finally, the sponsor behind Gong Pildu reached his limits and started sending messages outside the channel. It was natural since the sponsor didn\u2019t have many coins in the first place. Not everybody was rich just because they were a constellation.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 scoffs.]The other constellations in Gong Pildu\u2019s channel would\u2019ve stopped sponsoring and the incarnation was dying\u2026 everything was going according to plan.Bihyung noticed something and muttered.[Wait a minute, surely you aren\u2019t\u2026]I talked towards Gong Pildu, who was in a half dead state.\u201cHey, you over there.\u201dDududududu!\u00a0Gong Pildu fired crazily and looked up at me while breathing heavily.\u201cWill you die like this or will you sign a contract with me?\u201d\u201cW-What\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a constellation so I can\u2019t be a sponsor. But if you want, I can be a person behind the scenes. How about it?\u201d\u201cWhat is this bastard talking about\u2026?\u201d\u201cGong Pildu, shut up. I\u2019m not talking to you.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dI waved the \u2018contract\u2019 in one hand and the \u2018Intermediate Magic Power Recovery Potion\u2019 in the other hand.\u201cAnswer quickly. I will give these items to you if you sign with me.\u201dA message window flashed in front of me.[The sponsor behind character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 has revealed himself.][The constellation \u2018Defense Master\u2019 is looking at you like you are crazy.]Indeed. He wasn\u2019t yet ready to be an \u2018eul.\u2019 Don\u2019t worry. He would be in a hurry as time passed.Bihyung was watching me.[You\u2026 are you crazy?]\u2018This one as well.\u2019[You are the first to try and support a constellation.]\u2018I can\u2019t do it?\u2019[This is a constellation! Will it sign with an insignificant human?]\u2018That is just your thoughts.\u2019The intermediate constellation, Defense Master. He was a low level constellation compared to his ability.His world had long become a \u2018scenario\u2019 and was completely destroyed. Therefore, the Defense Master\u2019s myth was no longer discussed. The myth had disappeared and the constellation couldn\u2019t get coins. One day, even his existence would disappear.That\u2019s why some constellations, including the Defense Master\u2019 were obsessed with looking for an \u2018incarnation\u2019. The constellations were remembered in the world through their chosen incarnation.\u2018That guy, he doesn\u2019t have any coins left.\u2019[What?]Gong Pildu\u2019s power had fallen sharply compared to before. Unlike the \u2018Monarch of the Small Fries\u2019, the Defense Master was someone who cared about his incarnation. The fact that Gong Pildu was going to die meant he had run out of coins.It was obvious but without coins, a new \u2018sponsor contract\u2019 was impossible. Then what happened to a constellation who couldn\u2019t create a new incarnation?\u2018Once Gong Pildu dies, that guy will be forgotten.\u2019For a constellation, being forgotten meant death.Faint fear filled Bihyung\u2019s eyes.[You are\u2026?]Gong Pildu was a great card if I could afford it. Even Yoo Jonghyuk had attempted to subjugate Gong Pildu several times in countless regressions. Of course, he had never been successful.Yoo Sangah spoke.\u201cDokja-ssi, that person will die.\u201dGong Pildu was biting his lips so hard that blood was flowing. Now there were only two mini-turrets left in Armed Zone. It was time to end this.[The constellation \u2018Defense Master\u2019 is wondering about the contents of the contract.]He was coming. Bihyung\u2019s eyes widened at the sight in front of him.[\u2026Really? No, is this real?]I showed the contract immediately.[The constellation \u2018Defense Master\u2019 has started reading the contract.]Gong Pildu, who was shedding blood on the lower floor, suddenly shouted. He had probably heard a message from his sponsor.\u201cW-What? What is this message?\u201dWhat? He was being sold.\u201cW-What is going on Pildu-ssi?\u201d[The constellation \u2018Defense Master\u2019 is asking for some time to think.]After a while, I heard some good news.[The constellation \u2018Defense Master\u2019 as added a condition to the contract.][If you agree with this condition, the constellation \u2018Defense Master\u2019 will agree to contract with you.]I immediately read the contract.\u2026\u2026.14. Incarnation Kim Dokja (Gap) recognizes the property rights of Constellation Defense Master (Eul)and should ensure the survival of \u2018Gong Pildu.\u201915. Incarnation Kim Dokja (Gap) should help Constellation Defense Master (Eul) so that his private property \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 grows well.\u2026\u2026.Guaranteeing Gong Pildu\u2019s life and his growth. In fact, this didn\u2019t need to be included. It was natural for Gong Pildu not to die if the contract was signed. The only thing that mattered for me was the third condition.3. Incarnation Kim Dokja (Gap) has a command authority over \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019, the private property of Constellation Defense Master (Up to 10 times a day).I checked the contract and nodded.\u201cI will sign the contract.\u201dBefore long, a faint thread connected me and Gong Pildu. Then system messages were heard.[The contract has been completed.][You have become the co-sponsor of \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 due to the contract.][Due to the contract, you have been given the right to command incarnation \u2018Gong Pildu.\u2019][The duration of the contract is five years and it won\u2019t be automatically renewed.]Yoo Jonghyuk would be stunned if he knew that Gong Pildu could be obtained so easily. If I hadn\u2019t read to the latter half of Ways of Survival, I wouldn\u2019t have known to use the Behind the Scenes Contract this way.I handed the recovery potions to Yoo Sangah.\u201cGive this to Gong Pildu. You should give him one every 40 minutes.\u201d\u201c\u2026It is okay to give to him?\u201dShe had to give it. If not, this main scenario wouldn\u2019t be cleared. Gong Pildu was confused after Yoo Sangah handed him a potion.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cDrink it and fight.\u201dGong Pildu was suspicious for a moment but soon opened the potion\u2019s lid. Blue smoke emerged around his body and the destroyed turrets returned to their original appearance.[The character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 has completely recovered his magic power.]Gong Pildu wiped the potion stained lips and looked up at me.\u201cStupid guy. Do you think I will forgive you because of this? Once I get out of here, it will be your end\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up, Gong Pildu.\u201d[Under the terms of the contract, \u2018Command Rights\u2019 is activated!]\u201cO-Oof? Oof oof oof?\u201dPoor guy, he didn\u2019t even know what situation he was in.\u201cFight hard. Don\u2019t touch my party members.\u201d\u201cHup\u2026! Oof oof\u2026!\u201dDududududu!Yoo Sangah\u2019s eyes widened when she saw Gong Pildu listened to my orders.\u201cD-Dokja-ssi? W-Why is that person\u2026?\u201d\u201cI made a \u2018gap\u2019 into an \u2018eul.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did you write something?\u201d\u201cNow you can rest assured about Gong Pildu.\u201dThen the bombardment of messages from the constellations poured out.[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 finds your idea interesting.][The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 has dropped his stick at your strategy.][The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 thinks that you are impudent.]\u2026\u2026I had secretly signed the contract but these guys already noticed. The Defense Master was only intermediate level but he was still a constellation.A mere human became a co-sponsor with a constellation, the impact on the constellations would be enormous. There would be a backlash among those like the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon. But.[Many constellations are paying attention to you.][A number of constellations want to become your sponsor.]The constellations who realized my value were overwhelmingly larger.

I\u2019m sorry but I have to leave for a while.\u2019\u201cHuh? Now?\u201d\u201cThere is a place I urgently need to go to. Hyunsung-ssi and Yoo Sangah-ssi, please stay here.

A bad person who disappeared to eat items alone, regardless if people die or not. From now on, I am going to hit him in the back of the head.\u201dIt was very hard. Jung Heewon thought for a moment before asking.\u201c\u2026Is he worse than Gong Pildu?\u201dI contemplated for a moment before replying.\u201cHe is much worse.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll explain the details later.\u201dI moved with Jung Heewon and Lee Gilyoung. Then somebody grabbed my shoulder. It was Lee Jihye\u201cWait, where are you going right now?\u201dIn any case, this was good.\u201cGreat. You can come along.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cYoo Jonghyuk is in danger.\u201dLee Jihye laughed like she thought I was joking.\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying?

Perhaps I was the world\u2019s foremost, no the second highest authority who knew her master.I checked the time.\u201cThat jerk, he went to the hidden dungeon at Exit 1?\u201d\u201cU-Uh?\u201d\u201cAnd it has been 11 hours since he entered?\u201d\u201cUhhh\u2026\u201d Lee Jihye spoke blankly.I remembered that Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019 had attacked Chungmuro\u2019s \u2018hidden dungeon\u2019 a total of eight years. He failed twice and succeeded six times. The problem was that the two failures were concentrated in his early regressions.

I walked behind Lee Jihye, Lee Gilyoung and Jung Heewon while looking at my smartphone.\u300c\u2026In the midst of the splitting headache, Yoo Jonghyuk came to his senses.\u2018Give up on this life.\u2019This was the end of Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eighth life. \u300dIt couldn\u2019t be. This hadn\u2019t happened yet.\u2026Shit, why was this guy doing this on only the third life? If he moved carefully like his second life, he would\u2019ve passed through the mid-to-late scenarios.I raised my eyes to see Jung Heewon looking at me.\u201cDokja-ssi, what are you looking at?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, the calendar\u2026 This situation has made me lose my sense of the date.\u201dI actually thought it might be more interesting to look at the calender. Sometimes I wondered how I finished reading this novel.Jung Heewon looked at me suspiciously before turning her head towards Lee Jihye.\u201cThen\u2026 did you say your name was Jihye? Do you also use a sword?\u201d\u201cYes. I like the sword.\u201d\u201cRight? The sword is the best. It has a good taste.\u201d\u201c\u2026Unni also knows the taste?\u201dJung Heewon smiled as she watched Lee Jihye\u2019s sword. It was a luxurious sword that obviously flowed smoothly. Maybe it was given by Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201cYour sword looks good.\u201d\u201cAh, Master gave it to me. Unni\u2026?\u201d\u201cMy one\u2026 I-I like mine as well.\u201dJung Heewon looked down at the groll horn blade and then sneaked a peek at the sword on the other person\u2019s waist.I didn\u2019t do anything wrong but I couldn\u2019t help feeling sorry. I had no choice but to hang something on Lee Jihye.\u201cHey, why are you talking to Heewon-ssi but ignoring me?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 that, I\u2019m a bit weak to older females.\u201dLee Jihye responded with a quivering voice and Jung Heewon gave her a headlock, as if Lee Jihye was cute. There seemed to be a connection between the \u2018demon slayers.\u2019 Lee Jihye barely escaped from the headlock and asked.\u201cBy the way, why are you rescuing Master?\u201d\u201cWe are companions.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d\u201cHe is a useful guy.\u201d\u201c\u2026You sound like Master.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 is wondering about your heart.]Come to think of it, it wasn\u2019t just Lee Jihye but the constellations as well who must be wondering about my actions. He was a guy who would kill me if he got a chance. It was strange that I would run to save him.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 likes your desire to rehabilitate a fallen friend.][100 coins have been sponsored.]This one misunderstood me. But the Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2026 unlike the expectations of the Archangel Uriel, I had a deeply personal reason for saving Yoo Jonghyuk.It was to prevent him from \u2018regressing\u2019 after his death.Regression after death. It sounded good. A \u2018regression stigma\u2019 that triggered every time you died. The protagonist had a fraudulent ability.The problem was that this ability invoked complicated thoughts in the surrounding cast.\u300cBy the way, what happens to the world after you return? \u300dA supporting actor had asked this of Yoo Jonghyuk when Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s number of lives had broken into the double digits. I forgot his name but Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s answer from that time was clear.\u300c \u2026I also don\u2019t know. I always choose a world where more people can live. \u300dIt was plausible but in fact, Yoo Jonghyuk didn\u2019t know about the world he abandoned. In face, there was no definite theory about what happened to the world in Ways of Survival.Science, magic, whatever.This was why I was anxious. What happened to the world after the regressor disappeared?Would it reset with the regression? Or would a parallel universe branch off? The latter would be fortunate, but if it was the former\u2026\u201cHyung?\u201d\u201cAh, yes?\u201dLee Gilyoung, who was holding the hem of my clothes, looked up at me with anxious eyes.\u201cI think we\u2019re here?\u201d[You are approaching the outside region. Be careful not to leave the scenario area.]This message popped up. It didn\u2019t matter. Chungmuro\u2019s hidden dungeon was treated as an \u2018inside\u2019 area.We turned the corner and Exit 1 appeared. A dungeon entrance with an ominous shade greeted us.[You have found a hidden dungeon!][This dungeon has already been discovered by someone. You can\u2019t get the first discovery achievement.][A new hidden scenario has arrived!]+[Hidden Scenario \u2013 Theatre Dungeon]Category: HiddenDifficulty: A-Clear Conditions: Defeat the master of Theatre Dungeon.Time Limit: NoneCompensation: 4,000 coinsFailure: \u2015+The surprised Lee Jihye hesitated and stepped back.\u201c\u2026What is this? Theater Dungeon?\u201dLee Gilyoung looked startled. Well, this must be the first time they encountered a hidden scenario. Jung Heewon also spoke.\u201cA movie theatre as a dungeon\u2026 it sounds romantic.\u201dRomantic. This was only because she didn\u2019t know how scary the movie theatre could be. We entered the theatre. The familiar lobby of the multiplex welcomed us.[You have entered Theatre Dungeon.]We were tense as we entered the bleak dungeon. It was a multiplex consisting of nine floors, from B1 to the 8th floor.\u201cHyung, the posters are torn. Who would do that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201dI said this but I actually knew the truth.The core of this \u2018Theatre Dungeon\u2019 were the \u2018posters\u2019 on the wall. Perhaps Yoo Jonghyuk defeated every poster as he went upstairs. His intentions were to sweep up all the rewards.Except for the torn posters, nothing strange was found on B1. There were no items and no monsters. The only exception was the smashed elevator in one corner with a distrted door.Lee Jihye asked.\u201cIsn\u2019t this a dungeon? Why isn\u2019t there anything?\u201d\u201cSomething will appear.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you know something?\u201d\u201cA little.\u201d\u201cHow? Something is fishy about Ahjussi. Is this your second life?\u201dThat was her master. But he had lived three times.Then Jung Heewon said, \u201cIt is due to the sponsor behind Dokja-ssi.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201dI ignored the two women and tried to move to the ground floor when I was caught by Lee Gilyoung. The cockroach on his head was moving wildly. Lee Jihye drew her sword at almost the same moment I covered her mouth with a hand.\u201cShhh, there is somebody else besides us.\u201dI breathed out while small sounds started to be heard. Just upstairs. Then\u2026 the lobby? I first thought it was Yoo Jonghyuk but it wasn\u2019t Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s voice.\u201c\u2026Are you sure? Here\u2026 there are a bunch of things.\u201d\u201cYes. I bought the information with 1,000 coins.\u201d\u201cThe prophets?\u201d\u201cYes. They are disgusting but the information is obvious.\u201dI heard the sound of people talking. We went up the escalator and approached them. It seemed that four people were gathered in the lobby on the 1st floor.Lee Jihye whispered, \u201cWho are they? I never once saw their faces in Chungmuro.\u201d\u201cMaybe they came from the ground side entrance.\u201d\u201cGround side? Isn\u2019t that filled with poisonous fog? Furthermore, the scenario\u2015\u201d\u201cDifferent stations have different scenarios at different speeds. There are those who have finished the scenario faster than our station. If there is a weak poisoning, they can eat the meat from the underground species.\u201dI said this but I was confused.\u2018Prophets?\u2019There was no information about such people in Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s life. At this point, Yoo Jonghyuk and I should be the only ones who knew about the hidden dungeon.What caused the variables? Needless to say, I needed to find out.\u201cThen let\u2019s go inside.\u201dA blue spotlight was floating above the men talking. A bright light surrounded them and then they disappeared.\u201c\u2026What happened to them?\u201dJung Heewon asked me but I didn\u2019t answer. Instead, I was searching the posters on the wall. This was torn, that as well\u2026 by the time I reached the end of the wall, only one wasn\u2019t torn. I read the words written on the poster.Steven Spielberg, Samuel L Jackson, Jeff Goldblum\u2026That bastard Yoo Jonghyuk\u2026 he left this one alone? As expected from the third regression.At that moment, the light came on again. This time, the spotlight was aimed on us. The surprised Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung stepped back, but there was no way to avoid it. The word \u2018ray\u2019 suited it.I asked Jung Heewon, \u201cHeewon-ssi likes movies?\u201d\u201cOf course. Do you usually like it?\u201d\u201cYou might hate it after this.\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2015\u201d[You have been hit by a projection light.][The screening will begin.]The surrounding landscape started to slowly change. It wasn\u2019t a simple illusion so Fourth Wall wasn\u2019t activated as before. The old linoleum floor became covered with green bushes, while the reception desk and popcorn stand turned into a lush rainforest. The ceiling turned into a blue sky with no clouds and no end in sight. Lee Ji-hye muttered in a small voice.\u201cWhere the hell is this place?\u201dLee Jihye shouted and hacked at the surrounding trees and bushes, but nothing changed. Lee Gilyoung started looking for insects with a calm expression.I tried to touch the nearby trees. It had a hard and moist texture. It was a real rainforest from the Mesozoic era. This was a different realism from the specter\u2019s Welcome Prison. This was the power of the theatre master on the dungeon\u2019s 8th floor.\u201cIt is a movie.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really ridiculous things are happening.\u201dA novel had become reality. There was no law that a movie couldn\u2019t become reality as well.Jung Heewon was a fast adaptor and quickly understood.\u201cAhjussi, what movie is this?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll know soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026Can\u2019t you just let me know? Wait a minute, what is this kid doing\u2026?\u201dAt this moment, the shrubbery moved and something jumped out in front of Lee Gilyoung. An insect that resembled a giant preying mantis. The size was approximately 40cm. Lee Jihye was terrified and cried out.\u201cHey Kid! Back away!\u201dHowever, Lee Gilyoung responded calmly to the fuss.\u201cIt isn\u2019t a preying mantis. It is a Titanoptera from the Triassic period.\u201cWhat?\u201dLee Gilyoung stretched out his hand to the titano. The insect didn\u2019t refuse the touch and after a moment, Lee Gilyoung and the insect\u2019s body was wrapped in a blue light.Lee Jihye watched with a stupid expression.\u201cThis\u2026 what?\u201d\u201cFabre.\u201dIt really was good that I brought Lee Gilyoung. This guy\u2019s ability might allow us to pass through the gateway more easily.The giant preying mantis moved its big mouth and Lee Gilyoung nodded. I didn\u2019t know what it involved but they were having a conversation. After a while, Lee Gilyoung paled as he talked to the preying mantis.\u2026What was it?Lee Gilyoung hurriedly turned to me.\u201cHyung!\u201dAs he spoke, the sound of the earth shaking was heard. It seemed that something was coming at a tremendous speed, smashing the huge palm trees.Kuoooooh!The muzzle of the giant reptile that appeared through the rainforest was covered with reddish blood. Some bloody men were running in front of it. It was the men who entered before us.\u201cKuaaack!\u201d\u201cS-Save me!\u201dLee Jihye stepped back and spoke to Jung Heewon.\u201cI know what movie this is.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, me too.\u201dA body that was over a dozen metres tall and hard skin. Fierce muscles dominated the entire body. The strongest predator of the Mesozoic Era was in front of us.At first glance, it was similar to a grade 7 monster. The difficulty level was atrocious considering this was the 1st floor of the dungeon. But my heart just thumped. The harder the hidden dungeon, the better the reward.I pulled out a blade and said, \u201cGet ready to fight.\u201dMaybe Yoo Jonghyuk skipped only this movie because of the contents. The main reward of Theater Dungeon was related to the movie contents. Yoo Jonghyuk probably thought there weren\u2019t any worthy rewards in a movie where dinosaurs appeared. But he didn\u2019t know.In this movie, a really important reward was hidden.\u201c\u2026Are you serious? We are going to fight that?\u201d\u201cWe need to beat it to make an exit.\u201d\u201cThe exit?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt is a long movie. Have you forgotten?\u201dA T-rex was approaching quickly. The island\u2019s central laboratory was seen behind it. And an escape helicopter was on the rooftop of the laboratory.This was a movie. A movie that the master of Theater Dungeon made into reality.Therefore, there was only one way to escape from here.\u201cLet\u2019s make a great ending.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Therefore, I was the only one who could take the risk here.\u201cWhile I draw its attention, attack its rear\u2015\u201dI hadn\u2019t finished talking when I saw Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon already at the T-Rex\u2019s rear. They noticed quickly.Kuoooooh!I barely avoided the incoming teeth and the stomping legs. Before I could wield Unbroken Faith, its tail passed over my head. An electrifying thrill swept over my body. I wouldn\u2019t die because my stamina was over level 20, but it was dizzying.Maybe I had been lucky until now. I might be the \u2018sunfish\u2019 rather than Yoo Jonghyuk.Sukak!\u00a0Supaak!Meanwhile, Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye was steadily dealing damage from the rear. It was a combination of \u2018Sword Training\u2019 and \u2018Kendo.\u2019 Noticeable sword wounds were being dealt to the T-Rex\u2019s big legs. If this continued, it might take some time but the T-Rex would be defeated.\u201cHyung! I\u2019ll draw its attention!\u201dThe boy didn\u2019t listen to me about staying in the rear.\u201cNo, Gilyoung you\u2015\u201d\u201cI can do it!\u201dAll of a sudden, Lee Gilyoung came forward and started to make an unknown signal. I wanted to say something. Then a huge praying mantis came from somewhere, stabbed the T-Rex\u2019s eyes and fled. It was the Titano that Lee Gilyoung had been talking to before.Kuooooh!The T-Rex\u2019s eyes moved confusedly as it followed the praying mantis that disturbed its vision. Lee Gilyoung used dazzling hand movements to control the praying mantis. I looked at Lee Gilyoung with a fresh mindset.Wasn\u2019t this guy actually a hugely fraudulent character? No wonder why Yoo Jonghyuk coveted him.Kuwoooh!Thanks to Lee Gilyoung\u2019s success, the battlefield quickly became advantageous. The T-Rex\u2019s movements became duller while a red light shone in Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye\u2019s eyes.[Demon Slayer].It made them vulnerable to mental attacks but it was a good skill that made them stronger when they were excited. The sight of the two women\u2019s eyes burning as they watched the rainforest was truly spectacular.It was a pity that I had lost Lee Jihye to Yoo Jonghyuk. However, Jung Heewon also had overwhelming growth potential. Judge of Destruction was a good attribute and she didn\u2019t have a sponsor yet.It felt like the T-Rex\u2019s stamina had decreased considerably. It was time to deal the final blow.[Blade of Faith is activated!]I started to focus my remaining magic power. I didn\u2019t have a sponsor, nor was I as fast as Jung Heewon or Lee Jihye. But that didn\u2019t mean my attack power was weak.

I almost fell over a few times because I didn\u2019t have the \u2018Sense of Balance\u2019 but I somehow held on by stabbing the blade into the epidermis.Kuoooooh!The T-Rex poured out blood and its body rolled across the ground. I rammed the blade in wherever I could. Flames poured into the wounds caused by the blade.The yellow eyes of the T-Rex stared at me as it gasped painfully, before finally dying.[You have succeeded in being the first to hunt the 7th grade species \u2018Tyrannosaurus Rex!\u2019][You have obtained 1,000 coins as compensation.]\u201cAh\u2026we really got it.\u201d\u201cI knew we could do it.\u201dJung Heewon breathed heavily as she spoke with a proud expression on her face. She could be proud because the T-Rex was top-ranked among the 7th grade monsters. Lee Jihye belatedly rushed towards me.\u201cI had it!\u201d\u201cWhat?

Jung Heewon and the others came up behind me.\u201cThat person\u2026?\u201dI shook my head and looked down at the fallen man.\u2018Revelation.\u2019 What funny bullshit.As far as I knew, only Anna Croft had the ability of \u2018Future Sight\u2019 in Ways of Survival.Then there was only one answer.\u2026There was someone else besides me. But they didn\u2019t know as much as I did. The proof was that they didn\u2019t dare come here in person to test out the information.\u201cDokja-ssi?\u201d\u201cTake a break.\u201dWe covered the man\u2019s body with a large lead and gathered near the dad T-Rex. W had to hurry to pursue Yoo Jonghyuk. But if we didn\u2019t get enough rest, the party would be wiped out before we met him.I searched the T-Rex\u2019s body.I looked at the head and heart but unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find any monster cores. That didn\u2019t mean there was no income. Jung Heewon drooled as she watched the T-Rex being cooked over the fire.\u201c\u2026Can we eat this?\u201d\u201cWe can eat it because it is cooked with magic flames. The unripe parts can be cooked with the Magic Power Stove.\u201dWe sat side by side around the T-Rex\u2019s leg. As we cut the cooked flesh of the T-Rex little by little, steam rose. Lee Gilyoung shouted.\u201cFresh meat!\u201dLee Jihye hurriedly rushed up and grabbed a pierce first. The rest of the group, including myself, also picked large pieces of flesh. Meat of this size? It was a luxury that couldn\u2019t be dreamt of back when I was an office worker. Lee Jihye closed her eyes while enjoying the taste. Then she murmured in an ecstatic voice.\u201cAh, the best taste in the world\u2026\u201dIt really was delicious.The fat was properly wrapped around the muscles, making it different from the ground rats. The feeling every time I took a bit\u2026 If Yoo Sangah was here, she would\u2019ve cried.After I consumed the meat, I felt my stamina recovering. The meat of an advanced species had these special effects. However, caution was required in some cases. Jung Heewon sighed.\u201cPhew\u2026 I ate well. It is really delicious but I will cry if I eat anymore.\u201dWe had a moderate rest and then headed straight to the laboratory in the centre of the island.We encountered several raptors on the way but they were easy after the T-Rex.There were many flasks and ampoules in the laboratory. There were small incubators containing dinosaur embryos and blood samples collected. There was only one thing missing.My eyes caught a few items as we entered the inner corridor.[Stamina Enhancing Ampoule][Magic Power Enhancing Ampoule][Agility Enhancing Ampoule][Strength Enhancing Ampoule]As expected, it was here. I started to pack the ampoules. Just like the Ichthyosaur\u2019s Core, these comprehensive stat growth items were available only in the early scenarios.It wasn\u2019t just one or two ampoules. There were close to 20 bottles. If this was the case, my stats would be able to level up explosively. It was in anticipation of this hidden scenario that I saved coins instead of investing them in my stats.These ampoules were only available when the corresponding stat was less than level 30.\u201cAhjussi, what did you find now?\u201d\u2026Ah, this ghost-like girl.\u201cWhat? Stamina Enhancement Ampoule?\u201dLee Jihye\u2019s eyes shone as she grabbed one ampoule.\u201cAre you trying to eat these alone?\u201d\u201cEat them all? Of course I will share it.\u201d\u201cUnni, look at this! Ahjussi\u2026!\u201dThe other people in the party came closer due to the turmoil. Jung Heewon was shocked when she checked the item information.\u201cOh my god\u2026 what are these items?\u201d\u201c\u2026This is a hidden scenario.\u201dI spoke with a bit of disgruntlement. Damn, this was a bit difficult. I didn\u2019t catch the T-Rex alone so taking all the items pricked my conscience\u2026[Some constellations are displeased with the situation.]Lee Jihye looked at the Strength Enhancement Ampoule and opened her mouth.\u201cCan you give me the Strength Enhancement Ampoule?

But is it okay? It could be a mistake.\u201d\u201cThen doesn\u2019t that mean he is unlucky?\u201dLee Jihye asked. She was excited at the thought of getting a share of the items.\u201cLet\u2019s start with a Strength Enhancement Ampoule.\u201dI put out the Strength Enhancement Ampoule and said to Lee Jihye.\u201cYou will face me.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI\u2019m good at rock paper scissors.

Lee Gilyoung\u2019s face was slightly flushed while Jung Heewon had a satisfied expression. Lee Jihye flopped to the ground with a devastated expression.\u201c\u2026This is ridiculous!\u201dUnfortunately, I couldn\u2019t read Lee Gilyoung\u2019s mind so two ampoules went to him.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give it to me\u2026\u201d\u201cTake it.\u201dHe was cute. I stroked Lee Gilyoung\u2019s head.In addition, Jung Heewon won two Stamina Enhancement Ampoules. Jung Heewon received them with a smile.\u201cThank you. It was tough so far with my stamina.\u201dIt was only Lee Jihye who didn\u2019t obtain any ampoules.\u201cHow can you beat me 18 out of 20 times?

Can\u2019t you give me just one\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201dI ignored Lee Jihye\u2019s whines and packed the ampoules.Jung Heewon patted the shoulder of the grouchy Lee Jihye while staring at Lee Jihye\u2019s shining sword.\u201cLittle sister, the world has to be fair.\u201d*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Dudududu.\u00a0There was the sound of the helicopter\u2019s propellers. Lee Gilyoung looked at the distant dinosaur island and asked, \u201cHyung, can\u2019t I take it to the next floor?\u201dThe big praying mantis was sitting in Lee Gilyoung\u2019s lap and talking to Lee Gilyoung. The praying mantis rubbed its antenna against Lee Gilyoung\u2019s jaw.\u201cUnfortunately, you can\u2019t take it.\u201dLee Gilyoung\u2019s hugged the praying mantis with a sad expression.\u201c\u2026Take care Titano.\u201dKwiiik.He had already given it a name. Unfortunately, monsters created in Theatre Dungeon couldn\u2019t move to another floor.However, items could be taken to other floors. For example, I had the ampoules that increased stats and the item I was now holding.[Tyrant T-Rex\u2019s DNA Ampoule]The golden ampoule was the most decisive reason for choosing this movie. It was an item that increased all stats by 10 for 30 minutes after ingestion. Although it had the disadvantage that it could only be used in Theatre Dungeon, it was impossible to break through the last floor of this dungeon without this item.Especially if Yoo Jonghyuk was in the worst situation as I thought.The praying mantis that Lee Gilyoung released flew in the air and the dark sky started to collapse.[The first \u2018Ending Credit\u2019 has been reached.][Performers: Kim Dokja, Jung Heewon, Lee Jihye, Lee Gilyoung.][You have obtained 500 coins as compensation.]I felt some dizziness and we appeared on the ground floor again. After we escaped, the movie posted on the wall was torn. It was evidence that we safely cleared it. Lee Jihye was complaining.\u201cDo you have to pass a few more floors like this?\u201d\u201cYoo Jonghyuk will have broken most of it so it will be faster than you think.\u201dWe headed straight to the second floor via the escalator. From the second floor, the remaining space was narrow because it was the full-fledged theatre. Jung Heewon asked.\u201cThere\u2019s no change?\u201dNo matter how long we waited, the environment on the second floor didn\u2019t change. The camera wasn\u2019t seen and the screening didn\u2019t start either. Looking closer, all the posters on the second floor were torn. Lee Jihye noticed something.\u201cIs it only the movies whose posters are intact?\u201dI checked the torn posters one by one.Pacific Rim directed by Guillermo del Toro\u2026 a giant robots righting movie? Too bad. If this had been intact then I could\u2019ve gotten the reward of Hardened Gloves.Inception directed by Christopher Nolan\u2026 it was good that this one was torn.\u201cWow, I wanted to watch this.\u201dI saw the poster that Lee Jihye was looking at.\u201cDo you like superheroes?\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt is fortunate. Otherwise you would hate it after this.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dOn the torn poster, a green monster was roaring at\u00a0us.We\u00a0went straight up to the third floor.\u201cIt is the same here.\u201dAll the posters on the third floor were torn as well. Yoo Jonghyuk had properly swept through it. It was fortunate since there were a lot of dangerous movies on the third floor.Final Destination directed by James Wan\u2026 that bastard Yoo Jonghyuk, how did he break this? This was an annihilation movie.\u201cWe are going up faster than I expected?\u201dUnlike Jung Heewon\u2019s bright voice, I was nervous every time we climbed a floor. Clearing the Theatre Dungeon required some luck. Some of the posters on each floor weren\u2019t covered in Ways of Survival. Yoo Jonghyuk didn\u2019t clear all movies.There was a system message when we entered the fourth floor.[You have entered the fourth floor.]The spotlight poured down without giving me time to look at the posters. Jung Heewon gathered both hands together and prayed.\u201cPlease don\u2019t be a ghost movie\u2026\u201dI glanced at Jung Heewon and she gave me an excuse.\u201cGhosts can\u2019t be killed with a sword.\u201d\u2026This was the reason.[The screening has started!]The background changed and when we opened our eyes, a sea breeze blew on the prow of a ship.\u201cThis\u2026?\u201dSalt was felt in my mouth and the open horizon spread out before me. I was enraptured by the scenery of the sea. I had been working every day and it had been a few years since I\u2019ve travelled anywhere.\u201cWhat is this movie?\u201dNext to me, Jung Heewon was wearing a full length dress.A violin sound was heard from the inside of the cruise ship and there was the sound of excited people. It was an incredibly romantic atmosphere from a movie\u2026Oh, I know what this movie is.Then Lee Jihye\u2019s voice was heard. \u201cOh, accelerating all of a sudden\u2026\u201dI looked back and saw that Lee Jihye was vomiting. Jung Heewon rushed over and patted her back. After vomiting for a long time, Lee Jihye said.\u201cUh, I get seasick.\u201d\u201cIt is okay, just vomit.\u201d\u2026I had wondered this since a while ago. Why did the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare choose Lee Jihye? No, I read the novel but I just didn\u2019t want to know.\u201cBut Unni\u2026 is this the movie? The boat that sinks.\u201d\u201cIt seems so.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 perhaps Unni is \u2018Kate Winslet?\u2019\u201dLee Jihye looked at Jung Heewon\u2019s dress like she was envious, then she looked at me.\u201cThen Ahjussi is\u2026 DiCaprio? Uweeeek!\u201dI felt somehow grumpy when I saw her vomiting after saying that. At this time, Lee Gilyoung emerged from behind me.\u201cHyung!\u201dLee Gilyoung was dressed in formal clothing. This clothing was somewhat familiar\u2026Anyway, everyone was gathered.\u201cThere is no time.\u201dThe ship was now sinking. Unfortunately, the solution to this movie didn\u2019t appear in Ways of Survival.How could we beat the Titanic? Was it a fight with the sea?Lee Jihye was the first to comment.\u201cThe ship is sinking anyway. Do we just have to sink with it?\u201d\u201cThat is a little\u2026\u201dIt was frustrating. It would\u2019ve been better if the movie had a clear enemy to crush.\u201cLet\u2019s look for the villain Hyung.\u201dThis was Lee Gilyoung\u2019s opinion. I didn\u2019t know if there was an obvious villain this movie., But since I couldn\u2019t think of anything else, I decided to follow it.\u201cThen let\u2019s handle the villain.\u201dWe started moving. By the way, who was this movie\u2019s villain? The last time I watched the Titanic\u2026But I didn\u2019t need to worry. The villain came to find us. A man in a clean suit was staring over here.\u201cJack Dawson!\u201dWait, Jack Dawson\u2026 the role that DiCaprio played? But the man wasn\u2019t looking at me.\u201c\u2026Me?\u201d\u2026He was DiCaprio? I sighed as I looked at Lee Gilyoung.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *After a while, we kidnapped a person we thought was the villain of the movie. But the theater master didn\u2019t respond. It wasn\u2019t enough to kidnap him\u2026I hesitated for a moment before opening my mouth.\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s kill him.\u201dLee Jihye pulled out her sword and pointed it. It was at a man struggling while his body was tied up.\u201cThe theater master is a psychopath? Then isn\u2019t the answer to kill him quickly?\u201dI thought so as well. No, I was sure of it.It was the answer to another movie like this in Ways of Survival. But Jung Heewon gazed at the man in horror and unexpected said,\u201cBut\u2026he looks like a real person.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cThis is a movie but he is just like a real person.\u201dIt was surprising that Jung Heewon said this when she had been neatly subjugating the weak a few days ago. Then again, Jung Heewon had said something like this: \u2018I might be a killer but I don\u2019t want to become a monster.\u2019Lee Ji-hye asked, \u201cUnni, what are you saying this type of sentimental thing now? You don\u2019t want to kill him?\u201d\u201cNo, that isn\u2019t it\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is good to save people. But if this person doesn\u2019t die, we will die. We are definitely alive but this guy is just a character!\u201dCharacters\u2026I felt bemused at Lee Jihye\u2019s words.Jung Heewon looked at me. \u201c\u2026Do you think so?\u201d\u201cEven if this guy is a \u2018real\u2019 person, he is still a bad guy! Why is killing him bad?\u201dLee Jihye\u2019s words might be right. This guy was definitely a villain of the scenario and would do bad things. So it was okay to kill him. Funnily enough, it was the logic that Yoo Jonghyuk often spoke about in Ways of Survival.The moment I opened my mouth, Lee Jihye hurriedly drew her sword.\u201cSigh, what is this? Master could be dying right now!\u201dThe blade descended and pierced the man\u2019s chest. Blood poured out. It was incredibly realistic. Then a system message was heard.[The theater owner is satisfied with the changed ending of the movie.][The stern of the ship will lead to the next floor.]\u201cLook, I did it properly. Right?\u201dLee Jihye shouted triumphantly.The answer obviously wasn\u2019t wrong. The theater master acknowledged this and the constellations would give coins for our actions. We would survive with these coins.It was a way of living that destroyed this world.[The second \u2018Ending Credit\u2019 has been reached.][Performers: Kim Dokja, Jung Heewon, Lee Jihye, Lee Gilyoung.][You have obtained 500 coins as compensation.]We weren\u2019t able to get a reward item from Titanic. Thus, we went straight to the next floor and followed the guidance of the system message.[You have entered the fifth floor, the rewards room.]Once we climbed the escalator, the rewards room finally showed up.\u201cRewards room? It isn\u2019t a scary movie?\u201d\u201cThis is an exhibition hall. It was a place they used to show original movie props.\u201dIn fact, I knew this but I once again acted ignorant.Various movie props appeared in glass tubes. Equipment and costumes used by the main characters of various movies, stage accessories\u2026The funny thing was that they were no longer props.Jung Heewon approached a glass tube and shouted.\u201cOh my god, look at this!\u201d[Mikazuki Munechika \u2013 Replica] A grade sword.Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes sparkled as she looked at the glass tube and I nodded.\u201cYou\u2019ve finally obtained a proper sword, Heewon-ssi.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201dIt was obviously a great sword at first glance. The originally groll horn knife wasn\u2019t comparable and it wasn\u2019t lacking when compared to Lee Jihye\u2019s blade.Jung Heewon started to swing the sword in his hand.\u201cIsn\u2019t this amazing? It is light and moves properly!\u201dI had never seen Jung Heewon like this.[The character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 is deeply grateful to you.]It was nothing.The main purpose of targeting the Theatre Dungeon was the \u2018compensation\u2019 of the fifth floor. The Theatre Dungeon was a good place to farm for items early on. In particular, Jung Heewon would become stronger with this weapon.[The reward items are limited to two per person.]It wasn\u2019t a genuine \u2018star relic\u2019 person it was a movie prop, but the replica version had characteristics of the original item. A-grade items were close to a scam in the early stages.By the way, Yoo Jonghyuk had already passed through here. Two items were already gone.\u201cPick your items. Each one can only obtain two so choose carefully.\u201dI told Jung Heewon to pick an item Yoo Sangah could use while I found one for Lee Hyunsung. This one seemed useable.[Hercules\u2019 Shield- Replica] A grade shield.Good\u2026 It was an item that couldn\u2019t be compared with the Old Iron Shield. I thought of how Lee Hyunsung\u2019s eyes would shine with loyalty towards me and already felt warm.Lee Jihye, who claimed to be a fan of superheroes, was trying to pull an item from the corner.\u201cAh, why can\u2019t I hold this?\u201dI came closer. This was it.[Mjolnir \u2013 Replica] A grade blunt weapon.The hammer of the god of lightning, Thor. It would\u2019ve been an enormous item if it was a genuine star relic\u2026 still, the quality of the original was so great that the performance of the replica was significant.I watched Lee Jihye groaning as she grabbed the hammer that couldn\u2019t be moved.\u201cIsn\u2019t this an item that only someone special can use?\u201d\u201cDamn, I\u2019m not special?\u201dAt this time, Lee Gilyoung came up behind her and reached out to Mjolnir.\u201cHey Kid! This is mine\u2026\u201dMjolnir was lightly lifted by Lee Gilyoung\u2019s hands. Lee Gilyoung swung the hammer around before looking at me.\u201cHyung, can I have it?\u201d\u201cYes, it looks good.\u201dLee Jihye once again looked stunned.\u201cOnly I am unhappy\u2026 just me\u2026\u201dI ignored her and searched the remaining items. Let\u2019s see what was left.[External Reinforced Suit \u2013 Replica] A grade protective clothing.I didn\u2019t know what would happen in the future but it would be nice to supplement my defense. Once I wore the suit, it wrapped around my arms and legs.[Damage from external attacks is reduced by 10%.][The ability to detect enemies is improved.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[You can move more agilely than before.]It was a bit frustrating but it was still better than not wearing it. In particular, I thought about the fight waiting at the end of this.Now the preparations were finished.Since there were no significant changes in the dungeon, it was clear that Yoo Jonghyuk was alive. If we moved quickly through the sixth floor, we might be able to meet on the seventh floor. In the worst case scenario, if he was fighting the boss on the eighth floor\u2026 at least he was still alive.Now, let\u2019s go and get our damn regressor back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There is actually someone here who hasn\u2019t seen it.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 hates spoilers.]In any case, an item was rewarded due to the movie\u2019s unique characteristics.[Skill Book: Calm Observation.]Calm Observation. It was quite a useful skill.This skill allowed the user to see the movements of the target and figure out their overall stats. It didn\u2019t mean much to me since I could use Character List, but it would be quite useful for people like Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung. This skill would be good against enemies excellent at acting.[The exclusive skill \u2018 Calm Observation\u2019 has been acquired.]Still, I felt a bit sad. It would be nice to experience a movie like Gladiator.I had yet to obtain a suitable combat passive skill. He might purchase the skill Weapons Training but it wasn\u2019t a good idea to spend coins on the skill right now.\u201c\u2026Now I am tired of movies.\u201dI agreed with Jung Heewon\u2019s words. I didn\u2019t want to look at a movie theatre for a while. I should just be satisfied with the high performance fee.We went directly up to the seventh floor. Maybe this time we could see Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s back\u2026Damn. Most of the posters on the seventh floor were torn. Yes, Yoo Jonghyuk was now in the boss room. Under these circumstances, there was really no time to delay.\u201cRun. It is almost the last floor.\u201dWe started to run. We had to catch up with that guy as fast as possible. Before he gave up everything.We passed through the auditoriums and ran down the aisles. The posters on the 7th floor were of Korean movies popular in the past.Shit, please let all of them be torn\u2026However, unlike what I hoped, the last poster was still intact.\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d[The screening will begin.]The blue spotlight covered the party and the scene changed. My head spun and a salty smell entered my nose.The stage was the sea. But\u2026 this time it wasn\u2019t a cruise ship. There was the smell of artillery. The rough texture of the Panokseon could be felt. (Panokseon wiki link)The moment I turned my head on the shaky boat, I heard someone\u2019s voice.\u201cEverybody, down\u2014!\u201dI reflexively fell down and there was a bombardment of gunfire around me.\u00a0Tang tang tang tang\u2015 A few soldiers collapsed while bleeding.\u201cProtect the ship\u2015!\u201dThe soldiers dressed in old military garb were rushing around. An uneasy wind blew as war took place. The turbulent Myeongnyang Strait was swirling and there was the distant sound of drums.Dammit.There was no Korean who didn\u2019t know this movie.

It was one of the strongest combat buffs that the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare was proud of.[Your sword is filled with the words left by the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare.]There was a large variation in the attack power depending on which verse was sung, but it was a perfect skill for me right now.\u300c Shooting arrows like rain and protecting the generalissimo from guns firing on all sides. \u300dFortunately, it was a verse from the Nanjung Ilgi.

I could only believe in my last card. I cried out with all my strength.\u201cGilyoung!\u201dKukukung!The moment I cried out, there was a huge crack in the ceiling of Sky Garden.The black dome surrounding the roof was breaking. The Yoo Jonghyuk running towards me was also the Yoo Jonghyuk manipulated by the theatre master. He looked up with surprise at the ceiling.It was generally impossible for the shielded area of a \u2018hidden scenario\u2019 to be broken. But it was possible for \u2018uncommon\u2019 existences.In the distance, Lee Gilyoung was crying while wiping his bleeding nose.\u201cU-Uwahh\u2026 uwahhhh\u2026!\u201dIn order to deal with a monster, you had to call a monster.Kuoooooh!A huge insect dug into the cracks of the broken dome.Rattle!Like thin glass, the dome broke and the roof was split apart.

It was like a gigantic praying mantis, the insect king of great size.[The 6th grade insect king, Titanoptera has appeared!]It was an appearance that caused goosebumps.

Yoo Jonghyuk even launched a counterattack.Kyaooooh!The Titanoptera screamed at the hard blow. Surprisingly, Yoo Jonghyuk was on par with the 6th grade insect king.Maybe it was something he saw when fighting with me. The colour of the theatre master was returning. Yoo Jonghyuk was strong. It was a sudden situation but the theatre master thought he could win.He was wrong. He should\u2019ve been looking at me.I ran towards the theater master again. There wasn\u2019t long left on Diverse Communicaton.

The fierce teeth and violence claws ripped and clawed at me, but I didn\u2019t stop. I wasn\u2019t afraid. It was all fake. They didn\u2019t exist. They were all fiction from a novel.The moment that the Blade of Faith reached his neck.[The \u2018Theatre Master\u2019s Simulacrum\u2019 has triggered \u2018Mental Erosion.]Mental Erosion. It was the advanced cognitive manipulation skill used on Yoo Jonghyuk. I wasn\u2019t afraid because I had the Fourth Wall. But something unexpected happened the moment he penetrated my head.[The \u2018Theatre Master\u2019s Simulacrum\u2019 is embarrassed.]Abyss of the ego.All types of thoughts gathered and the pages of Ways of Survival fluttered.\u2013T-This?\u00a0This, is\u2026!Numerous texts emanated a faint light and floated in the darkness. It was the chapters of Ways of Survival that I had read.[The exclusive skill, \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 is activated!]The complexion of the theatre master changed as he dug into my head. He looked at the strings around him and his face whitened.\u2013Don\u2019t, tell, me, you\u2026ahhh!This was the last thing he said. Strangely, he looked at me in awe.The moment Blade of Faith was about to cross his neck, a dazzling light came from his body. It was like a ghost touching a divine light or the penalty for breaking a taboo.He was destroyed without a trace.I looked down at my hands and felt dazed.\u2026What just happened?[The \u2018Theatre Master\u2019s Simulacra\u2019 has been killed for the first time.][You have obtained 9,000 coins as compensation.][You have met the conditions to clear the hidden scenario!][You have obtained 4,000 coins as compensation.]These messages rose. I looked back and saw Yoo Jonghyuk collapsing after being released from the theatre master\u2019s control. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t die. The same was true for Lee Gilyoung, who had forcibly used Diverse Communication.\u201cHyung\u2026\u201dI rushed over and embraced Lee Gilyoung. Lee Gilyoung lost strength and fainted in my arms.[The barrier surrounding the Theater Dungeon has disappeared.]The barrier covering the ceiling vanished and I looked at the insect king. Surprising, it turned around and fled. It was like all interest had vanished. I breathed out with a sense of relief.It was over.\u201c\u2026Are you okay?\u201dJung Heewon and Lee Jihye staggered over.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Heewon-ssi?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay. Fortunately, Jihye is safe.\u201dLee Jihye was hit a lot by Yoo Jonghyuk and she couldn\u2019t speak because her mouth was swollen.[The ending time for the third main scenario is approaching!]Perhaps it was time for the end.I looked around the rooftop and saw that dawn was coming, making the day brighter. If Lee Hyunsung was here, he would recite the \u2018homeland\u2019 prayer.Jung Heewon groaned.\u201cAh\u2026 Seoul.\u201dThe ruined city area was illuminated by the faint light of dawn. I heard intermittent explosions from far away. Now there was no more poisonous fog. The poisonous rhinos were crushed under the collapsed buildings. I could see people fighting among themselves. They were probably a group that ended the scenario before us. The entire landscape was trapped inside a huge dome.It was a large barrier that seemed to be breaking.Currently, Seoul was isolated in a transparent dome.Jung Heewon said, \u201cReally\u2026it is all ending.\u201dIt was a scene that had to be acknowledged once again.I looked at the collapsed buildings and thought that Mino Soft would be somewhere there. Yoo Sangah would be disappointed. It was because Yoo Sangah was a person who worked hard. Lee Gilyoung wriggled in my arms.\u201cHave you regained consciousness?\u201dLee Gilyoung nodded and pointed to the sky.From a distance, a meteor shower seemed to be falling. The meteor shower was originally the forerunner of the main scenario. However, the number of meteor showers was more than before.It meant the \u2018hall\u2019 would open soon.The meteor showers were probably falling all over the world.Jung Heewon admired it.\u201cPretty\u2026\u201dJung Heewon didn\u2019t know. The meteors that looked beautiful from a distance would make a nightmare for the people where it fell.Now a bigger disaster would come.Lee Gilyoung gathered his small hands together and muttered something. Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye were silent for a while. Maybe they were also praying.It was funny. Wishing to the beings who would become a source of nightmare, it was probably only human beings who did this in the entire universe.After a while, Lee Gilyoung opened his eyes and looked up at me.\u201cHyung isn\u2019t making a wish?\u201dI looked down at Lee Gilyoung and replied.\u201cI have made a wish.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGilyoung, you shouldn\u2019t ask that.\u201d Jung Heewon scolded him.I watched Jung Heewon, Yoo Jonghyuk and then the collapsed Seoul again.\u201cI wish to see the novel\u2019s epilogue.\u201dLee Gilyoung looked at me with confusion.I silently gazed at the sky. There were slight cracks in the sky above Seoul. Once the sun rose, the dokkaebis would open a new hell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I want to give him another hit in the back.\u201dI headed downstairs with Jung Heewon. I carried Lee Gilyoung, who had completely fallen asleep after the meteor shower.The dungeon disappeared and it turned into an ordinary theatre. The items in the rewards room on the 5th floor were turned into ordinary stage props. It was as if everything that happened yesterday was a dream.Then BIhyung\u2019s voice was heard.[\u2026Do you know what I am going to say?]\u2018Yes.\u2019[Sigh\u2026I nearly fell down.]I felt a little relieved as I listened to Bihyung\u2019s grumbles.The constellations were powerful but they weren\u2019t omniscient. It was because all the sounds and images of the scenario were transmitted through the \u2018channel.\u2019 What did this mean?\u2018Was it filtered properly? I was too excited that I said too much.\u2019[Of course it was. Is there something wrong with my channel? That level of information is automatically filtered.]If my thoughts were correct, the words I said to Yoo Jonghyuk would be conveyed to the constellations in the following way.\u2013Do you really think so?\u00a0You have already forgotten the determination of your \u25a0\u25a0 attempt.-Why are you alone?\u00a0When you \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 like a fool in the \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0, when you cried over your \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0!When your loved one gave \u25a0\u25a0 to a \u25a0\u25a0!-Helping people and fighting against the damn\u00a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0!\u00a0\u00a0When you finally \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 before the \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0!\u201dIn fact, I didn\u2019t know how much filtering there was.It might be more than this, but it wouldn\u2019t be weak. In the original work, Yoo Jonghyuk experienced information being blocked this way at the beginning, even when information about \u2018regressors\u2019 was spreading.[The constellations didn\u2019t hear anything. Don\u2019t worry. The problem is that even I didn\u2019t hear much.\u2018\u2026You didn\u2019t hear it?\u2019This was a bit odd. The dokkaebi also couldn\u2019t hear the information?[Yes, that\u2019s right. What were you talking about?]Information that even the dokkaebi didn\u2019t know. I had one guess. Perhaps\u2026 the constraints of \u2018probability\u2019 had begun? I naturally came up with something from Ways of Survival.\u300c \u2018Probability\u2019 is a great deterrent that controls the Star Stream. \u300d\u2026I was reminded of it but it didn\u2019t help me straight away. One of the reasons why Ways of Survival was ruined was that there were too many settings the writer didn\u2019t know well.\u2018What is the reaction among the constellations?\u2019[They are fed up. There is still an uproar about what you were talking about.]I guess so. The constellations experienced a filter and the movie suddenly changed into a silent movie.If they were smart, they should start paying attention to the possibilities I had. The fact that my words were filtered meant I knew information that shouldn\u2019t be revealed at the present time.[A few constellations are watching you to explore your secrets.][The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 is excited by your existence.][2,000 coins have been sponsored.]I thought Bihyung had forgotten.[I received so many indirect messages that I didn\u2019t send them to you.

Unfortunately, she heard something. Jung Heewon was closer than Lee Jihye and no human-to-human filtering is possible\u2026Lee Gilyoung let out a loud snoring noise. I decided to be half honest.\u201cI know part of the future.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dJung Heewon thought about something for a while. She seemed to be wondering if my words were true or not. Then Jung Heewon seemed to have decided as she bit her lips.\u201cDo Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung know?\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t know yet.\u201dI answered in earnest and Jung Heewon stepped away from me with Lee Gilyoung.\u201c\u2026Surely you aren\u2019t going to kill me?\u201d\u2018Why are you saying this all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cNormally, a development like \u2018You know too much about me\u2019 will occur\u2026\u201dWhere did this normal development come from? Somehow I seemed to be a bad person.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the normal development is but I would\u2019ve already killed Heewon-ssi if I wanted to.\u201d\u201cActually, that is a bit weird.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t have bad thoughts. It is actually the opposite.\u201d\u201cThe opposite?\u201dI looked into Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes and said.\u201cThe future scenarios will be more dangerous. You might almost die many times and might lose preciouse things.\u201c\u2026So?\u201d\u201cSo\u2026\u201dI looked into Jung Heewon\u2019s increasingly nervous eyes and said.\u201cPlease stay with me from now on.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt means to be my companion.\u201dIt was time to make my people. \u2018Trustworthy people\u2019 who wouldn\u2019t easily betray me.Jung Heewon, who I helped awaken and could read her mind, was the most suitable talent. Jung Heewon looked blank for a moment.\u201cDokja-ssi didn\u2019t consider me a companion before?\u201d\u201cIt is actually the opposite. I\u2019m not the one who doesn\u2019t think of you as a companion.\u201dJung Heewon\u2019s eyes shook.I deliberately took a step back.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be companions, think of it as a deal. I need Heewon\u2019s strength and my information will be helpful to Heewon-ssi. It is give and take. The important thing is that our relationship won\u2019t change in the future.\u201d\u201cIt is a bit abrupt\u2026 Do I have to answer now?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dFor a person like Jung Heewon, a leisurely approach was better than a hasty and emotional one.

Especially if I fought against people with \u2018other variables\u2019 that I didn\u2019t know.Then a loud noise was heard from downstairs.\u201cThink about it.

They were still like this.\u201cWhere did that bastard Kim Dokja go? Tell me quickly.\u201dLooking closer, I saw that the Landlord Alliance were harassing Lee Hyunsung. I deliberately walked towards them and spoke in a loud voice.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, Lee Hyunsung-ssi.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dAn alliance member cried out as soon as I came down to the platform of Line 4.I saw a familiar landlord uncle.

There was an electric current in the air.[The fourth main scenario will start in 5 minutes!]Along with the system message, Dokkaebi Bihyung appeared.[Hahaha, everyone!

Hercules\u2019 Shield flew out of my hands into Lee Hyunsung\u2019s hands.\u201cT-This?\u201d\u201cI picked it out for you. Throw away what you previously used.A big smile appeared on Lee Hyunsung\u2019s face.[The character \u2018Lee Hyunsung\u2019 has used the exclusive skill \u2018Wide-Area Defense!]A translucent shield centred on Hercules\u2019 Shield surrounded our party. Indeed, this was the secondary skill attached to an A-grade item.\u201cWah, what is this?\u201dPeople groaned as they ran into the air shield.\u00a0 They tried to break the protective shields with their old weapons but it couldn\u2019t be broken with E-grade or F-grade items. In the end, the alliance members had only one place to turn to.\u201cPildu-ssi!\u201d\u201cOut of the way!\u201dThe level of Armed Zone had risen considerably and there was already a small Armed Zone under Gong Pildu\u2019s feet. He reduced the area to shorten the cooldown time. He was using his brains.Well, I had to handle it properly.\u201cPildu, did I tell you to get up yet?\u201d\u201cHeok?\u201dGong Pildu\u2019s head once again slammed into the ground as he fell flat.[Under the terms of the contract, \u2018Command Rights\u2019 is activated!]\u201cKeep your head on the ground until I tell you to get up.\u201dThe perplexed alliance members shouted at Gong Pildu.\u201cP-Pildu-ssi?\u201d\u201cP-Pull me up! Quickly!\u201dThe terrified alliance members tried to raise Gong Pildu up but it wasn\u2019t easy because Gong Pildu was very heavy.\u201cAnd\u2026 it is annoying so turn off the turrets.\u201d[The character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 has released \u2018Armed Zone Lv. 6!]\u201cT-This bastard\u2026!\u201d\u201cShut your mouth as well. Stay silent for 30 minutes.\u201d[Under the terms of the contract, \u2018Command Rights\u2019 is activated!]\u201cOof oof oof!\u201dThe alliance members became completely panic stricken once Gong Pildu became powerless with just a few words. Of course, the same was true for Lee Hyunsung, Yoo Sangah and Jung Heewon.I said with a smile, \u201cNow everyone seems to have figured out the situation and I\u2019d like to talk to you\u2026\u201dI could see people wincing and withdrawing.There were roughly 29 people left. 20 members from the Landlord Alliance and nine extra people, including me and my party. The number wasn\u2019t high but it was better than I thought. It was because having too many people at the beginning was difficult to control. I watched them and said.\u201cNow you have two choices.\u201dIt was time to pick a side.\u201cThe first one is to leave Chungmuro and go to another station. Or stay here with me.\u201d\u201cW-What are you saying so suddenly\u2026?\u201d\u201cJust answer me. Will you remain here or will you go elsewhere? You better decide before the main scenario starts. Or else your life will be in danger.\u201dThe eyes of the people present started to quickly move. Someone looked at me, someone else looked at Gong Pildu and another person looked at the tunnel leading to another station. I could tell their thoughts just be looking at them.\u201cI won\u2019t stop anyone who wants to leave. But anyone who stays here will be under my control.\u201d\u201cControl\u2026?\u201d\u201cBehaviour like the Landlord Alliance\u2019 is no longer acceptable. I won\u2019t allow tyranny over a small group.\u201dA handful of people watching me furtively started to stand by my side. They had been treated harshly by the Landlord Association and thought it was better to stick with me. It was a good judgment. A few alliance members shouted.\u201cIn the end, you are going to reign!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t deny it. But I won\u2019t take taxes or survival money.\u201d\u201cIs our safety guaranteed if we enter your group?\u201dA man from the alliance asked. Well, they bothered the tenants so much that it was natural to worry.\u201cI\u2019ll guarantee some outside safety but I won\u2019t interfere with what is going on inside. You must deal with conflicts between individuals yourself.\u201d\u201cT-That\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you one minute. You have until then to decide.\u201dThere was no need to wait for one minute. People had already made up their minds. Some of the alliance members walked over to me with determined expressions and bowed their heads. They were relatively young.\u201cThank you in advance. I was wrong in the past. Thank you for your generous forgiveness.\u201d\u201cIt is a pleasure. You don\u2019t have to ask for forgiveness from me.\u201d[Some members within the group fell a sense of trust towards you.]However, several others decided to leave Chungmuro. They tried to raise the fallen Gong Pildu.I watched them and said, \u201cAh, leave Gong Pildu. That guy is mine.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you have decided then leave quickly.\u201dThe five alliance members frowned at this and withdrew.\u201cKang-ssi! Do you really not want to come with me? It is better than staying under him!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s all go! Are you really going to serve that guy? You\u2019ve seen him!\u201dBut there were no more defectors.The five men cursed a few times before heading for the tunnel towards Myeongdong. They wanted to gain land elsewhere and become new \u2018landlords\u2019. Unfortunately, their plan would fail. In the fourth scenario, the people \u2018wandering\u2019 were good prey to predators.Once five minutes passed, the system messages popped up.[The sub scenario has ended.][You have earned 1,000 coins as compensation.][The white flag will show its true effects to the Chungmuro representative.][Current Group: 24 people.][Your reputation is still too weak to gain the title of king.]The title of king\u2026Indeed, it was hard to get the title of king with just a white flag. In order to walk the proper king\u2019s road, I had to change the colour of the flag. Of course, the white colour had its own \u2018authority.\u2019[You have gained control of the Chungmuro Group through the effect of the white flag.][You can punish a group member who goes against you.][There are currently five people who have left.]I could give a \u2018punishment\u2019 to the five distant men but I left it alone. Terror was effective in controlling people but such tyranny wasn\u2019t suitable for me.\u201cWell, thank you.\u201dI said while looking everyone in the eyes.Lee Hyunsung was looking at me with respect while Yoo Sangah and Jung Heewon nodded. The rest of them were looking at me with similar expressions. They were still rabble but it wasn\u2019t a bad start.Shortly afterwards, Bihyung appeared in the air.[Ohu, you have voted for a representative. Then let\u2019s start the game!][The fourth main scenario is activated!]+[Main Scenario #4 \u2013 Struggle for the Flag]Category: MainDifficulty: CClear Conditions: (Hidden because there are many contents)Time Limit: 12 days.Compensation: 2,000 coins.Failure: ???+I press the clear conditions.Numerous messages appeared in front of me.+[Clear Conditions]1. Every station has a \u2018flag\u2019 and \u2018flagpole\u2019 that can be occupied.* The flag can only be carried by the \u2018representative\u2019 of the station.2. You need to protect the flag from other station groups. If a flag is taken away by another group, the losing group will be taken over by the group that occupied the flag.3. You can put a \u2018flag\u2019 in the \u2018flagpole\u2019 of another station. The authority of the flag is only for the \u2018representative\u2019 of each station. Once the representative dies in an armed conflict, the authority of the representative is transferred to the person who holds the flag first. If you take the \u2018flag\u2019 of another station group, the treatment of the group deprived of the flag is determined by the group that took the flag.4. You must occupy the \u2018flagpole\u2019 of the \u2018target station\u2019 within a certain time limit. Failure to do so will result in the death of all group members.5. The target station your group should occupy is Changsin Station.+Jung Heewon thought for a moment before opening her mouth.\u201c\u2026We have to keep our flag and flagpole while putting out flag in other stations. Am I understanding it right?\u201d\u201cThat is how I understood it. We must take the flag to Changsin Station.\u201d Lee Hyunsung also spoke.Then I said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Everyone has understood.\u201dJung Heewon narrowed her eyes at my words. She knew I was pretending not to know. Now that I knew the future, she kept looking at me. I grinned towards Jung Heewon.Yoo Sangah touched her shoulder and said.\u201cAgain\u2026 we once again have to fight against people?\u201dLee Hyunsung thought for a moment before replying.\u201cIt said that we can decide on the treatment of the group if we occupy their flagpole\u2026 hopefully there might not be any casualties.\u201d\u201cAh, I see. That death won\u2019t necessarily occur if we take over the station? If we can accept the members of that station group when deciding the treatment\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, it is possible to clear it without anyone dying.\u201dLee Hyunsung replied with a smile. However, my heart wasn\u2019t comfortable.It seemed like Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung were trying to understand the world with some saintly logic.There was no such thing as a scenario where no one died. The fourth scenario would have more casualties than any precious scenario.As if she knew my heart, Jung Heewon changed the topic.\u201cWhat line is Changsin Station? I think we should know that first.\u201dLee Hyunsung confirmed it on the route map.\u201cLine 6. If we go to the tunnel, we can use the transit route\u2026\u201d\u201cThen we should split the group. How about a few people guarding this place while others go to scout?\u201dI didn\u2019t have to say anything as they actively exchanged opinions. It was somewhat heartwarming.[The activation of the scenario will turn off Chungmuro Station\u2019s safety borders.][You can now freely move to other stations.]As people were exchanging their opinions, I approached Gong Pildu.\u201cGong Pildu, you can speak now.\u201dThe command was turned off but Gong Pildu couldn\u2019t easily open his mouth.\u201cI know that you feel badly towards me. But you have to adapt. The days when you are a landlord are over.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI know why you have been so obsessed with \u2018land.\u2019 But do it moderately. If you want to survive in the future. Don\u2019t you have something to do?\u201dGong Pildu\u2019s eyes were shaky. I continued speaking.\u201cYou will be in charge of protecting this place.\u201dJust like the third scenario, Gong Pildu was very useful for the fourth scenario. As longa s Gong Pildu protected this place, Chungmuro would be safe unless someone on Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s level came.\u201cWhy should I speak to you\u2026?\u201d\u201cThis time I won\u2019t enforce it with a command. If you follow my request, there will be a reward.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThink carefully. Think about your family.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGong Pildu\u2019s eyes became bigger at my words.\u201cYou, how\u2026!\u201dAt this moment, noise was heard from the tunnel.Baang~!There was a loud horn sound and headlights shone on the railway of line 4.

It meant variables had appeared.In the darkness, the headlights turned off and there was the sound of people talking.\u201cAh, we finally made it to Chungmuro.\u201d\u201cReally, it took them a long time to break the scenario.\u201d\u201cHey, be quiet. They are going to hear. And don\u2019t you know that the scenarios are different between stations?\u201dI watched as the people came closer with weapons. The most important thing in a battle was to take the lead first. I went forward, followed by Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon, then Yoo Sangah in the rear. Lee Gilyoung was still sleeping.How many seconds passed? The four men and women in the darkness walked towards this side. I opened my mouth.\u201cStop there.\u201d\u201cEh? Well well.\u201dThe people stopped in their traces when they saw the blade I was pointing. There were white bikes beside them. I heard weapons being pulled out but a man\u2019s voice was faster.\u201cWait a minute. Calm down. Oh, I can\u2019t even talk because I am too scared.\u201d\u201cPut down your weapons and slowly come this way.\u201dThe man put down his weapon and approached with both hands raised. Once he entered the light, the man\u2019s impression wasn\u2019t bad. He gave off a reasonably favourable impression. His thin eyes were in a gentle curve.\u201cDon\u2019t be too wary. We didn\u2019t come here to fight.\u201d\u201cThen why did you come?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s start with the introductions. I\u2019m Kang Ilhun and I help manage the Dongdaemun Group.\u201dKang Ilhun? Nobody popped up in my head straight away. Furthermore, the representative of Dongdaemun\u2026 things were becoming strange.[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]Since the skill worked, he was certainly a character in the novel.[Character Information]Name: Kang IlhunAge: 31 years oldConstellation Sponsor: Shameless Good GossiperPrivate Attribute: Rumours Expert (General)Exclusive Skills: Weapons Training Lv. 2, Art of Communication Lv. 3, Spread Rumours Lv. 1.Stigma: Making a Commotion Lv. 1.Overall Stats: Stamina Lv. 12, Strength Lv. 13, Agility Lv. 13, Magic Power Lv. 10.Overall Evaluation: Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t develop his character due to the wrong sponsor. But he is a person with good ability who can be used. He spreads rumours regardless of truth or lies, so be careful.Rumours Expert\u2026 It was time for these guys to start acting. Kang Ilhun looked at me with slight impatience.\u201cYour name is\u2026?\u201d\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d\u201cAh, Kim Dokja-ssi\u2026?\u201dA flash of wonder corssed Kang Ilhun\u2019s face as he heard my name. However, it was only for a short moment.\u201cNice to meet you, Dokja-ssi. Since you have a flag, you must be a station representative?\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dHe looked closely at the colour of my flag and then the people around me. It was to confirm the power on our side. He was keen eyes but unfortunately, he met the wrong opponent.\u201cIf you have seen enough, get to the main point.\u201d\u201cHahat. I beg your pardon. We also need to be concerned about safety.\u201d Kang Ilhun continued speaking without any panic. \u201cOnce again, we didn\u2019t come to fight. What if we came with a good offer?\u201dI watched Kang Ilhun\u2019s party. None of them had a flag.\u201cHow can I believe that?\u201d\u201cHmm, won\u2019t you know if you check the rules? If we came to fight, we would\u2019ve come with the representative. Only the representative can occupy the flagpole.\u201dIt was true. It was obviously true.\u201cWhat is the offer?\u201d\u201cWe came to ask for an alliance.\u201dAt these words, the members of Chungmuro started murmuring. Kang Ilhun shook.\u201cAh, you are uncertain because Chungmuro just opened. In fact, the fourth scenario has already been in progress for two days.\u201d\u201c\u2026Two days?\u201dYoo Sangah reflexively muttered. Kang Ilhun nodded.\u201cYes, the third scenario is slightly different in content and duration between stations\u2026 perhaps you didn\u2019t know this?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThe third scenario was just over but I already knew this. In the original story, Chungmuro was a latecomer in the scenario compared to other stations. In other words, we started with some losses in terms of information.In that sense, Kang Ilhun\u2019s alliance offer was a timely temptation. Information was required and this was beyond our strength. The problem was what did the other side gain?\u201cIt is a difficult offer to accept. I don\u2019t know if you have an ulterior motive.\u201d\u201cHrmm, Dokja-ssi\u2019s words are definitely right. You won\u2019t believe in the alliance so I will first state what we will get from the alliance. In short, Chungmuro isn\u2019t our \u2018target\u2019 station.\u201d\u201cHow can I believe that?\u201d\u201cYou can believe it or not. But please think about it. If Chungmuro was our target, we would\u2019ve dragged the main force of our station here. To be honest, the flagpoles are most vulnerable just after the station is open.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t very persuasive.\u201cWhat will you do if our target station is Dongdaemun?\u201d\u201cHaha, there is no need to worry about that. We already know the station that is targeting us. We didn\u2019t come to you for no reason.\u201d\u201cI see. Let\u2019s clear the scenario by helping each other, since our targets are different\u2026 is that what you mean?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Isn\u2019t it good to help each other at this time?\u201dKang Ilhun smiled and nodded. I was silent for a moment and Yoo Sangah opened her mouth.\u201cI have a question.\u201dKang Ilhun grinned at Yoo Sangah.\u201cYes, what is it pretty girl?\u201d\u201cWhy did you come to Chungmuro? If you came from Dongdaemun, you could\u2019ve made an alliance with other stations.\u201dIt was an unexpectedly sharp point. Kang Ilhun looked slightly confused.\u201cOh, that\u2026 as I told you, Chungmuro just opened. I mean\u2026 um, the other stations have already formed alliances. But I thought that Chungmuro wouldn\u2019t have\u2026 haha, I have to ask, has Chungmuro already made an alliance?\u201dHrmm\u2026\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t.\u201dKang Ilhun looked happy at my words.\u201cThen form an alliance with Dongdaemun. You won\u2019t regret it. Above all, we have a \u2018winning solution\u2019 for this scenario.\u201d\u201cA winning solution?\u201d\u201cYes, in fact, our group knows the hidden secrets of this scenario.\u201dKang Ilhun grinned and drove in the last nail.\u201cWe will tell you if you agree to an alliance with us.\u201d*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *After a while, I sat with Yoo Sangah, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon to exchange opinions. Yoo Sangah spoke.\u201cWhat do we do? Should we establish an alliance?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to disagree. I can\u2019t believe them. I feel uneasy.\u201dOnce Jung Heewon spoke, Lee Hyunsung gave his opinion.\u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t be bad if they have information about this scenario. Certainly, we can\u2019t fully trust them as Heewon-ssi said\u2026\u201dFinally, they looked at me. I shrugged.\u201cThen for now\u2026\u201dOnce we made a decision, we called over Kang Ilhun and the Dongdaemun Group, who were looking around Chungmuro Station.\u201cI will make a decision once I have met your representative.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d\u201cWhere is your representative?\u201d\u201cAt Dongdaemun. If you don\u2019t mind, I will guide you\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease do so.\u201dWe got on the back seats of the bikes they came on. The people I took with me were Lee Hyunsung, Yoo Sangah and Jung Heewon. Lee Gilyoung was left behind with Gong Pildu. It was because he overused Diverse Communication and hadn\u2019t woken up yet. Of course, I didn\u2019t forget to give an order to protect Lee Gilyoung.\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201dThere was the sound of the bikes turning on and we started moving. Once 20 seconds had passed. I opened my mouth.\u201cBy the way Kang Ilhun-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThose people, did they say anything else about Chungmuro?\u201d\u201cHuh? What does tha\u2026\u201d\u201cFor example, if you come here then there will be a very scary man called Yoo Jonghyuk\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha, what are you sayin\u2026\u201dI gave a signal and our party jumped from the back seats of the bikes at the same time.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi!\u201dYoo Sangah used Binding Thread and tied the four bikes together. There was a roar as the bikes collided with each other.Kwaaaang!\u201cAaaagh!\u201dThe Dongdaemun members screamed as they crashed down.Fortunately, our party was safely hanging in the air due to Yoo Sangah\u2019s thread tied to the ceiling. It was a type of seat belt. It was an incredible feat that made Yoo Sangah seem like Spiderman.Kang Ilhun was covered in dust as he lay on the ground and shouted.\u201cW-What are you doing?\u201d\u201cWhat am I doing? That is what I want to ask.\u201d I looked at the dark tunnel. \u201cIn order to ambush us, you should raise the level of the stealth a bit more.\u201dIt was enough for me to detect despite not having Absolute Senses. Kang Ilhun noticed something was wrong and screamed.\u201cAttack them!\u201dAt almost the same time, people hiding all over the tunnel emerged. I knew it. They were aiming for my flag.[The character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 has activated the exclusive skill \u2018Judgment Time.\u2019][The Absolute Good constellations have agreed to the use of this skill.][\u2019Judgment Time\u2019 has been activated.]\u201cEh? I thought it might not\u2026 isn\u2019t this a complete mess?\u201dJung Heewon laughed with a surprised expression.\u201cIt is hard to find bad people.\u201dJung Heewon spoke in a cold voice and her sword flashed through the dark tunnel. Her eyes were red from using Demon Slayer. The bloody light swept through the darkness as people were slaughtered.\u201cW-What?\u201d\u201cThis crazy girl\u2026! Aaaagh!\u201dSeokeok!\u00a0Seokekeok!There were 10 peope but Jung Heewon killed them without a hitch. It was a scene that showed how much Jung Heewon\u2019s stats had risen after the hidden dungeon was cleared.I also used White Pure Star Energy and easily suppressed Kang Ilhun. A few hours ago, I was dealing with Yoo Jonghyuk. This guy wasn\u2019t very difficult.\u201cDokja-ssi, Chungmuro\u2026!\u201dI looked back at Lee Hyunsung\u2019s cry and saw that there was a commotion in Chungmuro. They were ambushed as soon as we left Chungmuro. I left Kang Ilhun to be tied up by Yoo Sangah and rushed to Chungmuro.There was already a melee happening on the platform. But I decided to watch the situation for a while. There was something I needed to check first.\u201cWhat are these bastards!\u201dDozens of group members that ran from the Myeongdong direction waved weapons at the people of Chungmuro. By the way, the weapons they were carrying were familiar.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat is Kim-ssi\u2019s weapon!\u201dThe Landlord Alliance members who headed towards Myeongdong had already been hit by these guys.

Gong Pildu was truly a scam.\u201cKuuack! Huddle up!\u201dThe Myeongdong group gathered together in a tight defense formation but it wasn\u2019t enough to endure the shells from the level 6 Armed Zone. It was a rewarding site that made leaving him to clear the Emergency Defense scenario alone worth it.Kwang!\u00a0Kwaang!\u00a0Kwaaaang!How many shots were fired? The enhanced magic bullets caused the Myeongdong Group to be riddled with holed and collapse. Gong Pildu was scary as an enemy but strong as an ally.\u201cT-There wasn\u2019t information about this!\u201d\u201cRetreat!\u201dBut there was no place for them to run away.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d[The special option of Unbroken Faith is activated.][The ether property is converted to \u2018fire.\u2019]Chwaaaaak!The ether blade made of flames created a wall of fire that blocked their escape. The moment that the confused people hesitated, Gong Pildu shot at them.Dududududu!\u201cP-Pierce through! Quickl\u2026cough!\u201dThe Myeongdong representative was hit in the head by a magic bullet and the flag was released.Gong Pildu\u2019s eyes shone as he found the flag. Sheesh, this brat.\u201cDo you want me to step on your back again?\u201dThe running Gong Pildu stiffened.\u201cDamn\u2026\u201dI immediately picked up the Myeongdong flag that had fallen onto the tracks. Focus vanished from the eyes of the desperate Myeongdong Group members.[You have won the flag of the \u2018Myeongdong Group.\u2019][Your white flag has absorbed the cumulative achievements of the red flag.][Your white flag has evolved into a red flag.]I felt a stronger force swirling inside my body.[You are one step closer to the King\u2019s Road.]The flags after the red flag improved not just the abilities representative but also the surrounding group members.Apart from overall stats or S-grade and above items, the flag was one of the few ways to improve basic combat power. Due to this, groups aimed at stations other than the \u2018target\u2019 station.The other \u2018king candidates\u2019 would\u2019ve already entered a full-fledged war to change the colour of their flags.The stronger they became, the more they could enjoy this world.[The remaining members of the Myeongdong Group are waiting for your decision.]I grabbed one of the wounded Myeongdong members in the area and asked.\u201cWhy did you aim for Chungmuro?\u201dI had realized something when I first heard Kang Ilhun\u2019s words. It was true that Chungmuro had just opened but it didn\u2019t make sense for them to rush in like they had been waiting. The observations of the party and the strange look he made when he knew I was the representative..These guys knew about this station from the beginning. I brought my blade to the man\u2019s neck and asked.\u201cTell me, who gave you the information of Chungmuro?\u201dThe most likely people were the Prophets. The guys I met in Theatre Dungeon mentioned \u2018hidden information\u2019 that other people didn\u2019t know.I had been searching through Ways of Survival but I never saw the group name Prophets. If so, who were they?There were two hypotheses.One, due to an unknown variable, a new prophet had appeared apart from Anna Croft.The second\u2026 besides me, there was another \u2018reader\u2019.Honestly, I thought it was probably the latter. The \u2018prophet\u2019 attribute wasn\u2019t so easy to obtain. Furthermore, Prophets was a plural\u2026Well, I could check it from now on.I looked at Gong Pildu and said, \u201cBy the way\u2026 why didn\u2019t you act more moderately?\u201d\u201cWhy should I show mercy to those running wild?\u201dGong Pildu looked annoyed.Unfortunately, the people of Myeongdong Group weren\u2019t able to answer because they had been hit by too many bullets. As soon as I asked them a question, they coughed up blood and died.In the end, I could only ask one person. I looked down at Kang Ilhun who was behind guarded by Lee Hyunsung. His eyes rolled uneasily while he was tied up with Binding Thread.Yoo Sangah asked, \u201cWas everything planned from the beginning?\u201d\u201cI thought there was a high probability. As soon as the station opens, two groups will unite and attack. It was a prior promise.\u201d\u201cSaying things with such a good face\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s expression became dark.\u201cAre you sorry? There isn\u2019t going to be an alliance.\u201d\u201c\u2026A little bit.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t believe in people too much. Things won\u2019t be as easy as you think in the future.\u201cI know. Still\u2026 if possible, I wanted to believe. I was able to come here because I believed in someone.\u201dYoo Sangah looked at me.\u201cHey, how long are the two of you going to talk? Quickly pry the information out.\u201dJung Heewon interrupted us. Indeed, now wasn\u2019t the time to give life advice. I released the thread blocking Kang Ilhun\u2019s mouth.Kang Ilhun was trying to stay calm.\u201c\u2026What will you do with me now?\u201d\u201cIt depends on how much information you can give me.\u201d\u201cAre you basing the standards on usability?\u201dThis guy talked back even in this situation, there was more to him than I thought. If so, I had to use a hard-line method\u2026Jung Heewon said, \u201cIn any case, the constellations see him as \u2018wicked.\u2019 How about trying torture?\u201d\u201cWhy bother with torture? Just kill him if he doesn\u2019t speak.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dI pulled out my sword without hesitation. Kang Ilhun trembled as he looked up at me.\u201cFrom now on, I will count to three. If you don\u2019t open your mouth in that time, you will die. There is no reversal.\u201dI deliberately triggered White Pure Star Energy and inserted the sword into the ground.\u201cOne.Kudududuk!The ground was scratched with the power of White Pure Star Energy as the blade started to move towards him. Fragments of the floor flew towards his face.\u201cTwo.\u201dThe heat of the blade warmed his face as it approached his nose. In a short time, the ether blade would cut his eyeballs.\u201cThree\u2026\u201d\u201cDongmyo Station!\u201dI smiled. Torture? There was no need for that.Kang Ilhun gasped for breath and explained, \u201c\u2026The people from Dongmyo Station gave us information about Chungmuro.\u201dDongmyo, who was there?\u201cWho was it?\u201d\u201cHe called himself a Prophet\u2026\u201dBy the way, this guy\u2019s condition was strange. His eyes were rolling and his tongue hung out like a dead person. I had an ominous feeling.Surely it wasn\u2019t \u2018Suggestion.\u2019\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, hurry and block his mouth with a thread!\u201dFortunately, Yoo Sangah\u2019s threat blocked this guy\u2019s mouth before it could close. Using Suggestion to control information from leaking\u2026 they were more meticulous than I thought.On the other hand, it was easier for me to solve the problem. Suggestion was a skill that could only be used face-to-face.I looked down at Kang Ilhun and stated.\u201cYou are a lucky guy.\u201dIf he was present, I could definitely identity one of the Prophets.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Before I went on the full-fledged search, I headed to the roof of the theater.\u201cHe still hasn\u2019t woken up?\u201dMaybe it was because she didn\u2019t know I was coming but Lee Jihye shook. Yoo Jonghyuk was still unconscious and lying on her knees.Jerk, he was the main character yet he wasn\u2019t going through any hardship. Meanwhile, I was the tired one despite being the reader.\u201cHow is it downstairs?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry and rest.\u201d\u201cMaster\u2026 will he be okay?\u201d\u201cHe will be fine. Although there might be some trauma left.\u201d\u201c\u2026Trauma?\u201d\u201cHis mental state is more fragile than a child\u2019s. He will be a bit better after a good sleep.\u201d\u201cIt sounds like you know a lot.\u201d\u201cI know him the best in this world.\u201dI spoke in a dry tone and pulled out some paper, writing on it with a pen. I filled it with notes and handed it to Lee Jihye.\u201cDon\u2019t read it but give it to Yoo Jonghyuk when he wakes up. Do you understand?\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201dShe said so but Lee Jihye would definitely read it. However, Lee Jihye wouldn\u2019t be able to understand it since it was filled with things only Yoo Jonghyuk would know.By the way, did the information on the paper also look like \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 for the constellations?[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 hates \u25a0.]Indeed. I was turning around when Lee Jihye opened her mouth.\u201cBy the way, can I ask you something?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cEarlier, with Master. Master and Ahjussi\u2026\u201dSomehow I seemed to know what Lee Jihye would say. Damn, Lee Jihye heard as well as Jung Heewon?I\u2019ve been stupid. I only considered the constellations and never thought about the humans listening. Yoo Jonghyuk would laugh at my stupidity.What was a good excuse?\u201cWell, that. You two.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d I decided to feign ignorance.Lee Jihye\u2019s expression became more serious.\u201cI mean, Ahjussi\u2019s words.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cWake up you jerk! Don\u2019t fall into those sentiments!\u201dLee Jihye imitated my voice and shouted. I felt embarrassed suddenly hearing my words emerge from someone else\u2019s mouth.\u201cFor the first time, that.. that determination! Have you already forgotten?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dWasn\u2019t something strange? This child, she almost heard it at the filtered level?\u201cI came here because of you! Why are you alone? We are together!\u201d\u201cNo, wait a minute.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always been around you! Don\u2019t lose hope! Think of the child!\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t what I\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy did I come here if you are alone\u2026!\u201dI stared at Lee Jihye for a moment.\u2026No, how could she hear it this way?\u201cS-Something like that? Ahjussi, you and Master\u2026\u201dI sighed. \u201cThink what you want.\u201d\u201c\u2026Indeed. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll give him this love letter!\u201dI shrugged and turned around. Behind my back, Lee Jihye\u2019s bullshit continued.\u201cWait! How did you give birth to a child?\u201d\u201cAsk Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201dYes, Yoo Jonghyuk, I leave everything to you. The next moment, indirect messages exploded in my head.[Some constellations are greatly affected by the truth of the filtering.][The constellation Prisoner of the Golden Headband respects your taste.][The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 likes your comradeship.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 thinks it is ridiculous.][600 coins have been sponsored.]\u2026Damn, there were other idiots.

Dongmyo Station was important but there was something to be done first.I killed the Myeongdong Representative and taken the flag so I had to hurry and occupy the empty station.Lee Hyunsung spoke in a worried tone.\u201cIs it okay with just us?\u201d\u201cThere won\u2019t be a fight. I will decide what to do with them. If I leave it alone, they will die soon.\u201dThe \u2018wanderers\u2019 who lost their group would become prey to other groups if they weren\u2019t lucky. Just like the Landlord Alliance members who left Chungmuro Station.But the moment we arrived at Myeongdong Station, we saw an unexpected sight.\u00a0The people in Myeongdong Station had already been hit by someone.\u00a0It was also very gruesome.I saw a group of men standing near Myeongdong Station.\u00a0The men were flustered and quickly fled in the direction of Hoehyeong Station. It wasn\u2019t easy to chase them because they had bikes.It was as if they knew I was coming.\u00a0There was more than one or two odd things.Lee Hyunsung asked,\u00a0\u201cWho are these people? What happened?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cEven Dokja-ssi doesn\u2019t know\u2026\u201dLee Hyunsung gulped nervously.\u00a0Fortunately, the flag holder of Myeongdong Station was empty.[Currently there is no group occupying Myeongdong Station.][Are you sure you want to take over the station?]I plugged the flag into the flag holder and pulled it out again.\u00a0Then a flag that was the same as mine appeared in the flag holder.[You have occupied Myeongdong Station.][A station that has been occupied can\u2019t be taken from you unless the \u2018main base\u2019 or flag is taken away.][Currently Occupied: Chungmuro (Main Base), Myeongdong][The achievement points of the red flag are rising.]The red colour of the flag turned darker.[Your influence has expanded by taking over a new station.][The hidden scenario has arrived!][The King\u2019s Road has begun!]+[Hidden Scenario \u2013 King\u2019s Road]Category: HiddenDifficulty: AClear Conditions: Take over a minimum of 10 stations within the time limit.Time Limit: 10 daysReward: The attribute of a \u2018king\u2019.Failure: If you can\u2019t take over a minimum of one station per day, you and your group members will all die.+I finally arrived at the terrible hidden scenario.\u00a0Once I started this quest, I couldn\u2019t turn back.\u00a0There were only two fates for a king.Become a king or die.[The new king candidate has started to walk along his road!]From now on, it was the full-fledge flag struggle.*\u00a0 * *I returned to Chungmuro, gathered the party members and told them about the hidden scenario. Jung Heewon made an interested expression while Lee Hyunsung looked confused. Yoo Sangah was as anxious as always.\u201cIt sounds like a difficult scenario\u2026 Dokja-ssi, will it be okay?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dAn angel or a fool.. In this situation, they were worried rather than jealous about the hidden scenario.Lee Hyunsung said,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad that Dokja-ssi is the king candidate.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cThen should I call you Your Majesty?\u201dI was hit in the head by Jung Heewon after being touched by Lee Hyunsung\u2019s serious words.\u201cI don\u2019t want that.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, based on this hidden scenario, shouldn\u2019t we go occupy a new station right away? You should think about the lives of your subjects.\u201d\u00a0Jung Heewon said sarcastically.I nodded.\u201cI think we need to find out about the people who attacked us. I\u2019ll go straight to Dongmyo. Jung Heewon-ssi and Lee Hyunsung-ssi, will you go with me?\u201dYoo Sangah raised her hand at my words.\u201cThen I\u2026\u201d\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi will stay here.\u201d\u201cAh, really\u2026 on the other hand, more\u2026\u201dI listened to Yoo Sangah\u2019s voice and it sounded glum.\u00a0Perhaps Yoo Sangah was thinking that she was useless.Her damage wasn\u2019t as strong as Jung Heewon and she didn\u2019t have a strong physique like Lee Hyunsung. In addition, she didn\u2019t have a powerful trump card like Gilyoung.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dAll her previous \u2018specs\u2019 had become obsolete in this new world. But she was too good to be jealous of other people. Thus, her inferiority complex was quietly festering.\u201cYoo Sangah, not everyone can do the same things well.\u201d\u201cYes, I am aware of that.\u201d\u00a0Yoo Sangah smiled weakly.I spoke carefully so that she wouldn\u2019t feel it was an admonishment.\u00a0\u201cDo you remember the words that you said on the subway? Dokja has a solo life and I will\u2026\u201d\u201cI will have an ivory life. Yes, I remember. I wrote it on the notepad of my smartphone.\u201dWhy did she look so elated?\u00a0In any case, I couldn\u2019t hate it. I continued speaking.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi has things to do here. I can\u2019t leave the unconscious Gilyoung alone. I need someone to monitor Gong Pildu and to control the nervous group members.\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s eyes shook.\u201cBesides, the Hoehyeon forces must be kept in check. They might attack while we\u2019re away. Gong Pildu is here but Yoo Sangah\u2019s Binding Thread might be necessary.\u201d\u201cC-Can I do this role well\u2026?\u201dYoo Sangah spoke weakly because of her low self-esteem.\u201cHey everyone. In that way\u2026 I will give Yoo Sangah-ssi a job position. What do you think?\u201dLee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon thought for a moment before nodding.\u201cOkay, I can trust it if it is Yoo Sangah.\u201d\u201cKing\u2026 if you wish then do so\u2026\u201dI glared at Jung Heewon.\u00a0Did she think that was funny right now?[You are using the unique permissions of a representative.][Chungmuro Station\u2019s representative, Kim Dokja is transferring some of his authority to group member \u2018Yoo Sangah.\u2019][Group member \u2018Yoo Sangah\u2019 has become the deputy of Chungmuro Station.][In the future, group member \u2018Yoo Sangah\u2019 can deal out punishments on behalf of the representative.]Yoo Sangah looked at me with stunned eyes and stuttered. She looked terrified.\u201cG-Giving, giving this position to me\u2026\u201d\u201cI will leave it to Yoo Sangah-ssi.\u201dI meant it. Once again, not everyone could do the same things well. Based on what I remembered, Yoo Sangah would be appropriate for this.Yoo Sangah was the best person in the human resources department, not someone else.\u201cOh\u2026I\u2019ll do my best.\u201dYoo Sangah bowed before slowly raising her head.\u00a0Tears could be seen in her eyes.*\u00a0 * *We headed straight for the tunnel on the east side.We had to pass three stops before arriving at Dongmyo. We moved with the fainted Kang Ilhun. Honestly, taking this guy was a burden but I needed him to identify the faces. When I looked back at Chungmuro, I could hear Yoo Sangah\u2019s voice.\u201cEveryone, please gather!\u201dAs I expected, Yoo Sangah worked harder in the shadows. The people were already organized and were receiving their orders. Sentries were set up and people were put in charge of different areas. Some of the landlords said they wouldn\u2019t listen to Yoo Sangah but\u2026[Chungmuro Station\u2019s deputy, Yoo Sangah has used the punishment.]I vaguely heard someone moaning.\u2026Was this okay? Well, it should be fine.Jung Heewon looked at my face and said,\u00a0\u201cGood job. I felt that Yoo Sangah had been a bit depressed.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t select Yoo Sangah-ssi because I was thinking of her emotions. I thought Yoo Sangah-ssi would do really well.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, is that so? Then please me something later. It should fit me.\u201d\u201cHow about an executioner?\u201d\u201c\u2026Forget it.\u201dJung Heewon grumbled and turned her head away.\u00a0It was good after all the jokes she played.\u201cBut that gangster on the roof, is it okay to leave him?\u201d\u201cOh, you mean Yoo Jonghyuk?\u201d\u201cI guess his name is similar.\u201d\u201cIt will probably be fine.\u201d\u201cIt sounds like you know him very well. What is it?\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u00a0I thought for a moment before asking.\u00a0\u201cHeewon-ssi, do you have a younger sibling?\u201d\u201c\u2026? Yes. Why?\u201d\u201cA brother or a sister?\u201d\u201cA brother.\u201d\u201cHow old is he?\u201d\u201cHe is one year younger.\u201d\u201cHow is it having a brother?\u201d\u201cAnnoying. He easily defies me and I had to take him to school instead of my mother\u2026\u201dJung Heewon feel silent as she was complaining about her brother. She gazed somewhere in the air. Then I asked her.\u201cBut now you are worried about him right?\u201cWell\u2026 we are family.\u201d\u201cI am similar.\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi also has a younger brother?\u201d\u201cNope, I\u2019m talking about Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u00a0Jung Heewon looked at me and nodded.\u00a0\u201cThen do you like or hate him?\u201d\u201cI hate him. I fought with many people because of him.\u201dI wasn\u2019t the only reader of Ways of Survival in the early days. Quite a few people followed along out of curiosity up to the 10th chapter. There were also 12 readers at the 50th chapter.There was a guy who liked Kim Namwoon\u2026 while I argued with him.\u00a0I wonder if any of the people who fought with me back then were alive.\u00a0Maybe the people I was going to catch now was one of them.\u201cYou two, you seem to have become very close.\u201dLee Hyunsung interrupted and I suddenly realized I was walking too close to Jung Heewon.Jung Heewon smiled.\u201cWhy, soldier ahjussi. Are you jealous?\u201cHrmm. It isn\u2019t like that\u2026\u201dCome to think of it, \u00a0didn\u2019t Lee Hyunsung join the army right after going to a male high school? I felt sorry for Lee Hyunsung when I thought about the setting.\u201cIt seems we have arrived at Dongdaemun History and Culture Park Station.\u201dIn fact, the entrance of Dongdaemun History and Culture Park Station could be seen in the distance.We nervously stuck to the tunnel wall and looked around. It was in case troops were waiting. But this worry was pointless. Jung Heewon muttered.\u201cIt is strange. There are no sentries.\u201dThe fact that there was no guards while Struggle for the Flag was ongoing meant that the station had already been eaten by another group. Once we confirmed this, we immediately approached the flag holder.[The station has already been occupied by \u2018Dongmyo Station.\u2019][If you want to occupy the station, take the flag of Dongmyo Station or occupy its flag holder.]It was as expected.Then Kang Ilhun\u2019s body twitched. His body was shaking like he was having seizures and his condition was strange. I released the thread blocking his mouth and Kang Ilhun shouted.\u201cN-No\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026What is this all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cD-Dongdaemun\u2026 Dongdaemun Station\u2026!\u201dSaliva spilled from Kang Ilhun\u2019s mouth as he stuttered.\u00a0I felt something and unintentionally put a hand on his shoulder.Then.[The character Kang Ilhun is now a wanderer.]It was evident that Kang Ilhun\u2019s affiliation to \u2018Dongdaemun\u2019 had changed.\u00a0Jung Heewon asked,\u00a0\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d\u201cIt seems that Dongdaemun Station has been taken over.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dSuddenly everything made sense.\u00a0Yes.\u00a0The people who leaked the information had this in mind.\u201c\u2026A double trap.\u201dThey incited the Myeongdong Group and Dongdaemun Group to strike Chungmuro because they knew the two groups would die in Chungmuro. While the main force were gone, they wanted to take Myeongdong and Dongdaemun.

That reminded me, what was the description of Yoo Jonghyuk in Ways of Survival? There wasn\u2019t a detailed appearance but the word \u2018handsome\u2019 was attached. And my face\u2026Could this be considered a fictional allowance?\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cAh, nothing.\u201dHis tone became politer. I didn\u2019t know what was going on in there but his head was probably in a complicated state right now.At least one thing was certain.\u00a0The man in front of me had clearly read Ways of Survival.I became more certain because he wasn\u2019t registered in Character List and he was surprised to hear Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s name.His eyes urgently returned to Lee Hyunsung by my side.It was inspecting the attribute\u2026 I see. Was he digging up information? I deliberately gave him some time to observe Lee Hyunsung before opening my mouth.\u201cImpertinent person. You better move your eyes carefully.\u201d\u201c\u2026Heok?\u201dHe confirmed Lee Hyunsung\u2019s name and also noticed that he could view my character window with Detect Attributes. I didn\u2019t know how far he had read in Ways of Survival but there were a few characteristics that could be used to identify Yoo Jonghyuk.One of them was the SS skill, Sage\u2019s Eyes which allowed for universal detection and protection against detection skills. Now he would be convinced that I had Sage\u2019s Eyes.\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t know that you peeked at me with a B-grade skill?\u201dThe spasms started from the man\u2019s eyes and spread through his face.Then his eyes wandered to the red flag I carried on my back. It was as I guessed. There were limits to the evidence that he could find about Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201cYou son of a bitch\u2026!\u201dOne of the men in the group hadn\u2019t figured out the situation and pointed a spear at me. The moment that Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung was about to come forward.Peeok!The man\u2019s head burst and red blood splattered like a fountain. The group immediately screamed. From beyond the blood, I saw a serious looking man.\u2026Look at this bastard?\u00a0He slowly walked through the crowd towards me.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Such a distinguished person had to see a horrible sight.\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201dThe man tried to manage his expression at my cold tone. He was pretty good. If I was him, I would like like my heart was going to burst.\u201cI will formally introduce myself. My name is Lee Sungkook. I am the deputy in charge of Dongmyo Station.\u201dThis guy approached and bowed before me.\u00a0I liked it.\u00a0Then I started the full-fledged Yoo Jonghyuk cosplay.After I snapped at him, I opened my mouth and spoke in a cold voice.\u201cDongmyo Station? I see. Then get out.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cThis is my station from now on so get out.\u201dThis guy\u2019s mouth dropped open.\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to listen to me?\u201dI looked down at the flag holder that had the Dongmyo flag.\u00a0Lee Sungkook belatedly understood my point.\u201cT-That is impossible.

I continued speaking.\u201cDoes it sound like I am joking? Two.\u201dWas it hard to remember after reading the novel 10 years ago?\u00a0It looked like he forgot who Yoo Jonghyuk was.\u00a0Then I had to jog his memory.[The exclusive skill \u2018White Pure Star Energy Lv. 2\u2019 has been activated.][Blade of Faith is activated!]Chiiiiiing!I saw Lee Sungkook\u2019s pale face beyond the burning white blade.\u00a0This was a game of chicken.Remembering Yoo Jonghyuk meant he knew a bit about who Yoo Jonghyuk was.If he knew how ruthless the early Yoo Jonghyuk was then he would never be able to continue this game.If he didn\u2019t know Yoo Jonghyuk properly?\u00a0Then it didn\u2019t matter.\u00a0I would play the game and run away if we were going to lose.\u00a0Now I had enough strength.At this moment, Lee Sungkook hurriedly shouted.\u201cW-Wait a minute!

Our representative will be greatly looking forward to seeing Yoo Jonghyuk-nim. Please give our group a chance to talk with Yoo Jonghyuk-nim.\u201d\u201cYou know me?\u201d\u201cHow can I not know Yoo Jonghyuk-nim?\u201dLee Sungkook shut his mouth the moment he said this. He thought he said something strange. Yoo Jonghyuk couldn\u2019t be famous this early on.\u201cA-Anyway, it will be an honour if you accompany me.\u201dI stared at him and replied.\u00a0Yes, this level was acceptable.\u201cOkay, show me the way.\u201dLee Sungkook\u2019s expression brightened and he added useless words.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.

There was the sound of wind being blown from the lungs and Lee Hyunsung moaned.As expected from Jung Heewon.\u00a0She didn\u2019t know the exact situation but she knew how to match the mood.I muttered out of the side of my mouth.\u2018You know what to do without me telling you?\u2019\u2018Yes, roughly.\u2019I watched Jung Heewon and then Kang Ilhun being carried by Lee Hyunsung. The most important person right now was that guy.\u2018Make sure to restrain that guy. Understood?\u2019Jung Heewon nodded and made a strange gesture.\u00a0She kneeled in front of me and cried out in an exaggerated voice.\u201cYes Jonghyuk! I will do as you say!\u201dAnyone who saw it would think about medieval knights.\u00a0The funny thing was that the surprised Lee Hyunsung did the same thing.\u201cI-I will do as you say\u2026!\u201dLee Sungkook, at the head of the group, was surprised to hear these two voices. It was embarrassing but the result was good. I couldn\u2019t read Lee Sungkook\u2019s inner thoughts but it would be like this if I could read it.\u300c He must be Yoo Jonghyuk. \u300dLee Sungkook met my gaze and quickly turned his head back to the front.\u00a0This was how a main character felt.Not long afterwards, we arrived at Dongmyo Station.They were a pretty powerful group seeing as many people were on the platform. There were some people with weapons like Lee Sungkook\u2019s group, but most of them didn\u2019t have any.They were probably wanderers from other stations who lost their group.\u201cMove faster!\u201d\u201cI-I understand.\u201dThey were slaughtering the ground rats while being supervised by the Dongmyo members or disassembling the corpses of the monsters to make equipment.The so-called \u2018slave\u2019 class.\u00a0It was a common scenery in the age of kings.Jung Heewon frowned.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a real kingdom\u2026\u201dI spoke to Jung Heewon.\u201cDon\u2019t be disgusted. Wait here and look at the situation.\u201d\u201cYesss\u2026\u201dI\u2019m ignoring Jung Heewon and started to observe the surroundings.\u00a0It was to take into account additional variables.Dongmyo was quite important in the original novel.\u00a0If I remembered correctly\u2026 the representative of this place was the \u2018invalid.\u2019But the story was likely to have changed if the Prophets intervened.\u00a0I looked at the back of Lee Sungkook\u2019s head.At this point, I had two questions.\u00a0One, did Lee Sungkook have his own text version?\u00a0Two, how many prophets were there?And if I had to say a third question, did they have the same \u2018skills\u2019 as me\u2026It didn\u2019t seem like it. Otherwise he would\u2019ve used Character List instead of Detect Attributes at the beginning.Besides, he didn\u2019t seem to have the Fourth Wall when I used Character List.\u00a0In other words, he was a case like Lee Gilyoung.Well, I read over 3,000 chapters. It would be unfair if they received the same perks as me when they only read a few chapters.Speaking of which, I don\u2019t think they had a text version\u2026By the way, what was this person looking so hard at?\u00a0Lee Sungkook was looking at his smartphone.[5,000 coins have been invested in agility.][Agility Lv. 20 -> Agility Lv. 30][An amazing agility lies in your body.]I approached Lee Sungkook like a ghost.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat are you looking at so hard?\u201d\u201cH-Huh?

It was unbelievably luxurious for such a shabby tent.There was a red carpet and a bed that seemed to have been stolen from a luxury hotel. There was a round table for a meeting and a small desk with a computer.The most interesting thing was the boy concentrated on surfing the Internet.

You have fought against terrible enemies and struggled against the beings of this world to save people. Enduring alone, lonely memories\u2026 We respect your sublime spirit.\u201dThis jerk, such skillful flattery.\u00a0Yoo Jonghyuk would be moved to tears if he heard.\u00a0Later when he was depressed, I would have to tell him these words.\u201cBut Yoo Jonghyuk-nim should\u2019ve realized it from your past regressions. Even if you have an outstanding miracle, you alone can\u2019t fight against the disasters that will come.\u201dPlus, he was right.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk-nim, this time will be different. It is because we are here. We Prophets have received a special blessing and have been sent to help you.\u201dWow, look at this?Lee Sungkook smiled faintly.\u201cYou must be wondering. Why did these guys who didn\u2019t appear last time suddenly show up now? It is very confusion but I hope you can trust us. It is because we have already received a revelation for this day 10 years ago.\u201d\u201c\u2026Revelation?\u201d\u201cYes. In our world, there is a \u2018revelation\u2019 that is secretly shared among the Prophets. Yoo Jonghyuk exists in it and is a living myth. It is a single revelation that records all of the past and future.Wait.\u00a0Don\u2019t tell me \u2018that\u2019 was the revelation?\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me yet. We already knew that Yoo Jonghyuk-nim would gather Lee Hyunsung. They didn\u2019t come with you but you probably already have Delusion Demon Kim Namwoon and Maritime Admiral Lee Jihye. But that isn\u2019t enough. At the very least, according to the revelation\u2026\u201dI hid my nervousness and asked.\u201cWhere is the revelation?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, it has been damaged and we can\u2019t find the original. \u00a0Don\u2019t worry.

It was because Lie Detection couldn\u2019t distinguish such falsehoods.That\u2019s why I felt it even more.\u201c\u2026It is surprising.\u201dIt was true.\u00a0I was shocked beyond surprise.\u00a0This was a great \u2018setting.\u2019\u00a0A setting that was squeezed out in a short amount of time.\u00a0Human creativity was really great.\u201cYou are called Sungkook?\u201d\u201cYes, Yoo Jonghyuk-nim.\u201dI could write the book Ways of Survival.\u00a0In order to help the hero who kept dying, readers received a revelation and came from outside the novel?\u00a0This was more exciting than the real Ways of Survival.\u00a0But that was it.\u201cDon\u2019t go around in circles.\u201dThis was it.\u201cGet straight to the point.\u201dI heard the set up so it was time to speak.\u201cYou have received the revelation of the future. Then what exactly are you going to do?\u201dLee Sungkook quickly replied.\u201cWe would like to form an alliance with Yoo Jonghyuk-nim. I-It is an alliance in name but it actually means going under you\u2026\u201dHe was a funny guy.\u00a0In the end, this was his purpose?\u00a0Riding the bus that was the main character?\u201cI see. An alliance. You want this.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt is an interesting suggestion.\u201d\u201cThis means\u2026\u201dI tapped my fingers against the table.\u201cBut the order is wrong.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHow can I form an alliance with people whose identities I don\u2019t know? If you want to ally with me, isn\u2019t this the first thing you should start with?\u201d\u201cM-My identity\u2026 I already\u2026\u201dI got up from the chair and sat on the plush bed in the room. Then I crossed my legs and declared.\u201cKneel down.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cKneel.\u201dLee Sungkook was embarrassed for a moment before getting down from his chair while hiding his expression.\u00a0As his knees slowly reached the floor, I opened my mouth.\u201cTell me your attribute.\u201dOnce I saw the strong hypnosis on the king candidate, I guessed this guy\u2019s attribute. However, I needed to make sure.Lee Sungkook looked up at me with complicated eyes.\u00a0His mind was probably working hard.\u00a0He would think this.\u300c Yoo Jonghyuk can see my information with Sage\u2019s Eyes. \u300d\u300cHe already knows it so what is the reason for asking about my information? \u300dLee Sungkook struggled for a moment before speaking.\u201cMy attribute is\u2026 Hypnotist.\u201dAs expected, it was Hypnotist.\u201cI see.\u201dLee Sungkook looked a bit brighter at my nod.\u00a0He thought he had passed a test.\u201cIs that all?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dLee Sungkook\u2019s eyes shook.\u201c\u2026O-One more.\u201dI nodded.\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cT-The 9th\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe 9th?\u201dLee Sungkook slowly lowered his head like he was ashamed.\u201cThe 9th person\u2026 to get off.\u201dI see.\u00a0This brat, the 9th\u2026\u2026No, wait.

This is the first time us Prophets have seen it.\u201dThis brat was giving an excuse.\u00a0I wanted to tease him a bit.\u201cBut it is strange. If you really received the revelation, why aren\u2019t you a \u2018revelator\u2019 instead of \u2018someone who got off\u2019? What is with this name?\u201d\u201cT-That\u2026 the revelation\u2026 no, the book of revelation\u2026\u201dLee Sungkook stuttered. It was delightful watching him try to avoid Lie Detection. I wondered how honest he could be. Lee Sungkook finally closed his eyes.\u201cWhen I read the book of revelation\u2026 I stopped!\u201d\u201cYou stopped reading it? Why didn\u2019t you read it?\u201d\u201cThe contents of the Book of Revelations are very difficult, vast and profound\u2026\u201d\u201cThen you were the 9th person to get off?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that will be of much help to me.\u201d\u201cN-No! I can definitely help you!\u201dThe confused Lee Sungkook continued to speak gibberish while uneasily turning his smartphone off and on.\u201cWhy do you keep touching that smartphone?\u201d\u201cI-I-I\u2019m sorry. I am a smartphone addict\u2026\u201dHe was trying to get advice from the other ones who got off.\u00a0But that didn\u2019t last long.\u201cAre you going on the Internet?\u201d\u201cY-Yes, that\u2019s right. It is the ability of the hermit\u2026\u201dAt Lee Sungkook\u2019s words, I looked towards Han Donghoon.\u00a0The hypnotized boy was busy tearing at his fingernails with empty eyes.The Hermit King of Shadows who had the powerful information manipulation ability.\u00a0This boy couldn\u2019t be kept under the prophets.If the Prophets became involved in the story in this way, the original novel was ruined and the plans I set up would be wasted.\u00a0I had to stop these guys before everything went wrong.\u201cDo the other prophets also have the attribute of \u2018getting off\u2019?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cHow many are there in total?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u00a0Lee Sungkook hesitated for a moment before opening his mouth.\u00a0\u201cAs far as I know, there are 48 people.\u201d48 people?\u00a0It was smaller than I thought.Considering that chapter 1,200 had one hit and chapter 120 had 10 hits, I thought there would be at least 100 people.Lee Sungkook\u2019s words resolved my curiosity.\u201cI know there were more prophets originally but I expect most of them didn\u2019t pass the first scenario.\u201d\u201cThey are dead despite knowing the future?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 we have received the revelation but we only recently realized that it was a \u2018true\u2019 revelation.\u201dNow it made a little sense.Perhaps at the start of the scenario, few readers thought that a novel that started serialization 10 years ago would become a reality. They might not remember it straight away.I thought it was strange that Lee Sungkook survived.\u00a0Furthermore, this guy was the ninth person to stop reading so he was literally one of the earliest readers. Then how did he survive?\u201cI fortunately survived the carriage. If it hadn\u2019t been for another prophet nearby, I would\u2019ve died.\u201dAnother prophet in the same place as him?\u201cThat\u2015\u201dThe moment that Lee Sungkook was about to speak, the ground slightly shook.\u00a0The vibration was transmitted despite Sound Wave Blocking.Lee Sungkook and I ran out of the tent at the same time.Kung!I thought it was a sudden sub scenario but that wasn\u2019t it. Two people stood in the centre of the epicenter. The man and woman facing each other. I didn\u2019t know the man but the other person was\u2026\u201cYou aren\u2019t a supporting role\u2026 yet you dare to push me?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about, you dog-like jerk.\u201d\u2026Not surprisingly, it was Jung Heewon.\u201cWhat? Dog\u2026? You bitch!\u201dThe man grabbed a very large ring sword from his back. His overall level seemed in line with Jung Heewon\u2019s. But it wasn\u2019t enough.Jung Heewon movements were already above incarnations of the same class.\u00a0Jung Heewon\u2019s blade moved lightly as the man attacked.[The character \u2018Jung Heewon\u2019 has activated the special option of Mikazuki Munechika, \u201cDeath God\u2019s Footsteps\u2019\u2026]\u201cJung Heewon!\u201dJung Heewon stopped his black just before she cut off the man\u2019s head. The hairs were rising on the man\u2019s neck.It was a tremendous difference in speed. If I hadn\u2019t intervened, the man would be dead.The startled Lee Sungkook cried out,\u00a0\u201cJung Minseob! What are you doing now?\u201dI realized it when I saw Lee Sungkook\u2019s confusion.[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]Then the expected message popped up.[The information of this person can\u2019t be read in \u2018Character List.\u2019][This person isn\u2019t registered in \u2018Character List.\u2019]That\u2019s right.\u00a0He was also a Prophet.* * *After a while, another prophet was on his knees in front of me, with Lee Sungkook next to him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my friend didn\u2019t know anything\u2026 Hey, apologize quickly!\u201dThe man sitting beside him bowed towards me.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dUnlike Lee Sungkook. he was a very prideful person and couldn\u2019t completely remove the anger from his face. I looked at Jung Heewon and said,\u201cJung Heewon, I told you not to be reckless.\u201d\u201cT-This bastard\u2026!\u201d\u201cJung Heewon!\u201dJung Heewon made a surprised expression for the first time.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry, Yoo Jonghyuk-nim.\u201dJung Heewon bowed and turned to leave, Lee Hyunsung following her with a strange expression. I knew that Jung Heewon wasn\u2019t the type to raise a sword to someone for no reason.However, it was dangerous to move in this current situation.The other man looked at me and asked,\u00a0\u201cAre you really Yoo Jonghyuk-nim?\u201d\u201cYes, are you also a prophet?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dThere was a complicated expression on his face. He looked between me, Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung. Then he glanced at Lee Sungkook and said.\u201cExcuse me, Yoo Jonghyuk-nim. I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to leave you for a moment. Sungkook, talk with me for a minute.\u201dHe left the tent while Lee Sungkook bowed to me.\u201cI won\u2019t wait long.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t be like this if it was the original Yoo Jonghyuk.\u00a0But I had a reason for allowing them to talk.\u00a0As soon as Lee Sungkook left the tent, I immediately called to Bihyung.\u2018Hey Bihyung.\u2019[What is it? Having fun again\u2026]\u2018Hearing enhancement, 2,000 coins.\u2019[\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.]Now Bihyung had adapted. It took less than three seconds before an advertisement went up.[2,000 coins have been consumed.][The exclusive skill \u2018Hearing Enhancement\u2019 has been acquired.]Bihyung warned.[Hey, be careful from the fourth scenario onwards. For such a wide-scale scenario, the intermediate dokkaebis have jurisdiction\u2026.]I ignored Bihyung\u2019s words.[The exclusive skill \u2018Hearing Enhancement Lv. 1\u2019 is activated.]I moved my body outside the tent blocked by Sound Wave Blocking.\u00a0Then voices started to be heard.\u00a0They weren\u2019t too far from where I was hiding.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t it slightly strange?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDo you see that as a handsome face?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about suddenly\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe author said that Yoo Jonghyuk was handsome.\u201dThis bastard?\u00a0Fortunately, Lee Sungkook dismissed it.\u201cThe author might have different tastes\u2026 He is Yoo Jonghyuk for sure. He has the same dirty nature.\u201d\u201cYou only got off at the 9th chapter, what do you know\u2026?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026! You don\u2019t really remember it since you read it a long time ago!\u201d\u201cStill, aren\u2019t some scenes pretty clear with the \u2018Memory Benefits? Would you even remember the prologue without this privilege? You might not be alive if it wasn\u2019t for me\u2026\u201dTheir voices were coming closer.\u201cIt is weird no matter how I look at it. Setting aside Lee Hyunsung, who is that strange woman? If I remember correctly, there wasn\u2019t such a woman in the third regression.\u201d\u201cThen check it. See if he is really Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201d\u201c\u2026But what if he is real?\u201d\u201cWe will go according to plan. If we get Yoo Jonghyuk here, we can deal with those who read until the 50th chapter.\u201dSome really good information was coming in.\u00a0Despite wanting to hug onto the main character, these guys were unleashing all types of curse words because of their situation.\u00a0This was why they were humans.Lee Sungkook and the man was coming closer.\u201cI apologize for the long wait. Let\u2019s go inside.\u201dWe went back into the tent.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk-nim. I apologize for my previous disrespect. I will greet you again. I am Jung Minseob.\u201dThe man smiled and bowed.Once again, this guy had pretty good items for being beaten by Jung Heewon. In particular, there was the useful Fugitive\u2019s Mask which allowed the user to freely change their face and appearance.I cut to the chase.\u201cThen where did you get off?\u201dJung Minseob glared at Lee Sungkook.\u00a0He seemed to be saying something with his eyes.\u201c\u2026The 1,089th person to get off.\u201d1,089. Considering the number of views for chapter 1,200 was 1 and the number of views for chapter 120 was 10, this guy was a person who got off quite late.Maybe this was the guy who saved Lee Sungkook in the first scenario.\u201cAs a prophet who has read the Book of Revelation, I am glad and honoured to meet Yoo Jonghyuk-nim. However, Yoo Jonghyuk-nim\u2026 I\u2019m sorry but can I ask you some questions?\u201d\u201cQuestion? What is the question?\u201d\u201cThat, regarding Yoo Jonghyuk\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you doubt that I\u2019m the real Yoo Jonghyuk?\u201d\u201c\u2026T-That\u2019s not it.\u201dHis face was red from my intense gaze.\u201cTry it.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cAsk me.\u201dThe confused Jung Minseob nodded.\u201cUm\u2026 Then excuse me.\u201dIn order to properly trick these guys, I had to keep a few things in mind.\u201cAs far as I know, Yoo Jonghyuk took Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon as a companion in the third regression. Yet you have a strange woman with you instead of Kim Namwoon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought she was Lee Jihye but she doesn\u2019t seem to be in her teens. I also heard you calling her a different name.\u201dHis memory and observation skills were quite good.\u00a0Like Jung Minseob said, this world had already changed from the third turn that I knew.\u00a0Now I had to shift this changed world to \u2018suit my taste\u2019 as much as possible.\u201cIf you are asking me why I don\u2019t have the Delusional Demon with me, the answer is simple. In this turn, the Delusional Demon doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d D-Doesn\u2019t exist? Perhaps\u2026 did he die?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYes.\u201dTheir faces were filled with confusion for a moment. Jung Minseob asked,\u00a0\u201cNo, how\u2026 Who the hell killed Kim Namwoon?\u201d\u201cThe Delusion Demon Kim Namwoon\u2026\u201dThese prophets\u2019 mouths were slowly dropping. Now I would drive in the last wedge.\u201cHe died at the hands of a prophet like you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He killed the Delusional Demon and gobbled up the hidden scenarios in the beginning. Thanks to that, my plan became twisted.\u201d\u201cT-There is a guy like that\u2026?\u201dOf course there was. The person was right in front of you.\u201cHe even seems to be impersonating me. When I encountered him last time, he was on the verge of death but he is still likely to be active near Chungmuro.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 admires your impudence.]\u201c\u2026Chungmuro? Don\u2019t tell me?\u201dJung Minseob was surprised and opened his smartphone, tapping the keyboard like Lee Sungkook. Maybe he was informing the other prophets.Jung Minseob asked me a few more questions and I answered them briefly.\u201cIt is like this! Ah\u2026 then the third regression changed\u2026 You really are Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201dJung Minseob was deeply impressed.\u201cThat\u2019s why you got that girl instead of the Delusional Demon. She seems enough to replace Kim Namwoon. She overpowered me in one blow\u2026\u201dThe most important thing was their misunderstanding.Jung Minseob thought for a while before saying,\u00a0\u201cBut when listening to Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s story, I seem to know who killed the Delusional Demon.\u201d\u201c\u2026You know?\u201d\u201cYes. I said this before\u2026 let me tell you this in advance, not all prophets are on the same side.\u201dI expected to hear this conversation. If there were 48 who knew the future, there would be some people who thought wrongly.\u201cThere are those who call themselves the Twelve Apostles. They believe they are the only ones who have read the real revelation and that they can change this world.\u201d12 people.\u00a0It was an exact match to the number of people who read up to chapter 50 of Ways of Survival.\u201cWhy are they different from you?\u201d\u201cThey\u2026 they have read more of the revelation than us.\u201dI was right.\u201cRight now, there are 11 known apostles. I\u2019m guessing that the prophet that Yoo Jonghyuk-nim met is the last unknown apostle.\u201dAs they were creative people, they adapted when thrown into the scenario.\u00a0This was a convenient misunderstanding.\u00a0No, wait a minute\u2026 a misunderstanding?If I thought about it, one of the 12 people who read up to chapter 50 would be me.\u201cYou don\u2019t have any good feelings towards the apostles?\u201d\u201cTo tell the truth\u2026 that\u2019s right. Unlike us, they are planning to use the Book of Revelation to conquer this world.\u201d\u2026Why was my conscience pricked?\u201cThey are the ones who pursue their own interests and sincerity rather than stop the destruction of the world by helping Yoo Jonghyuk. They are like the 10 Evils.\u201d\u201c10 Evils\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I would like to ask Yoo Jonghyuk-nim. Please lead us. Stop them.\u201dI see. This was their real purpose.\u00a0To be honest, it was a bit surprising.\u00a0I never thought they would need me because of infighting between the prophets.\u00a0I thought for a moment before opening my mouth.\u201cOkay. I accept. I will form an alliance.\u201d\u201cR-Really?\u201d\u201cHowever, I have one condition.\u201dLee Sungkook and Jung Minseob\u2019s faces were tense as they waited for the conditions.\u201cFirst, give me Changsin Station.\u201d\u201cHuh? Changsin Station\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is the station right above Dongmyo. Haven\u2019t you eaten it already?\u201d\u201cAh, then Chungmuro\u2019s target station\u2026\u201dJung Minseob seemed to know something.\u00a0In fact, this was the most major part of this alliance.In Struggle for the Flag, the target that I must occupy was Changsin Station.\u00a0If I couldn\u2019t take it, I wouldn\u2019t be able to finish the fourth scenario even if I walked the King\u2019s Road to the end.\u00a0If I didn\u2019t complete the fourth scenario, both me and my group would automatically die.By the way, Lee Sungkook\u2019s expression was strange.\u201cExcuse me, Yoo Jonghyuk-nim. I\u2019m really sorry\u2026 this is a bit difficult.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThe owner of Changsin Station isn\u2019t a member of our group.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t yours?\u201dIt was strange.\u00a0It was because Dongmyo Station was right before it.Lee Sungkook said with a sigh,\u00a0\u201cThe \u2018Tyrant King\u2019 has occupied it.\u201dThe Tyrant King.\u00a0My blood ran cold.\u201c\u2026He has already become a king?\u201dOne of Seoul\u2019s Seven Kings, the Tyrant King.\u00a0He was one of the few people who could be compared to Yoo Jonghyuk at this point.Shouldn\u2019t it take a few days until he blossomed as a king?\u00a0The guy who started at Dobong Station had already come down this far?\u00a0It didn\u2019t make sense no matter how I thought about it.Lee Sungkook received my gaze and looked down.\u201cActually\u2026 some of the prophets made a few mistakes and his power suddenly rose. In the midst of taking some prophets, he took the station\u2026 at the time, Prophets had 53 members.\u201dSuddenly, their credibility declined sharply.\u00a0When I thought about it, I didn\u2019t know the beginning of the novel well without help. Why did I think these people would do well?\u201cD-Don\u2019t worry too much about it. We are preparing a powerful weapon to eliminate the Tyrant King. It isn\u2019t just the Tyrant King. It is a weapon to deal with the Twelve Apostles.\u201dJung Minseob agreed.\u201cMaybe Yoo Jonghyuk-nim doesn\u2019t know it well. We worked very hard to figure out the revelations\u2026\u201dNo, I knew.\u00a0These guys shouldn\u2019t be alone.\u00a0I had to end it before these people could ruin the story.\u201cAh, this is good. Sooner or later, you will have a chance to see the weapon.\u201d\u201cA chance to see the weapon?\u201d\u201cTomorrow, with the exception of the Twelve Apostles, the Night of the Prophets will be held. I-If you don\u2019t mind\u2026\u201dJung Minseob\u2019s eager eyes turned to me.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk-nim, I want you to come with us.\u201d* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* *After the talk, Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung and I gathered in the accommodations provided by Lee Sungkook. I looked at the flag of Chungmuro Station.Throughout the afternoon, my flag was changed to \u2018navy\u2019 due to the transfer of Dongdaemun Station and Cheonggu Station.[You have used the benefits of the navy flag.][From now on, you can use the \u2018group chat\u2019 with the group members.]From now on, we didn\u2019t have to worry about conversations.\u00a0The group chat couldn\u2019t be intercepted unless another group member was in the same area.I briefly explained to them about what happened today. Jung Heewon vaguely noticed but Lee Hyunsung was surprised.\u2013Oh my god, it is unbelievable.\u00a0They know part of the future\u2026 that\u2019s why Dokja-ssi is acting as Yoo Jonghyuk?\u2013Yes.\u2013Sigh\u2026 Then we should stay here for the moment.\u00a0We need to find out more information about them\u2026\u2013Nope.\u2013Huh?\u2013Today I will take care of them.I looked at Jung Heewon and said.\u2013I\u2019m sorry Jung Heewon-ssi.\u2013Its okay\u2026 I am just a bit hurt.-\u2026\u2026\u2013I\u2019m just joking.\u00a0Isn\u2019t Dokja-ssi playing a gangster right now?\u00a0If you are sorry, let me deal with that jerk from before.Jung Heewon smiled and continued.\u2013Then tonight will be a hot night?\u2013H-Hot\u2026?Lee Hyunsung was freaked out by Jung Heewon\u2019s joke. I shook my head.\u2013I have something to do first.\u2013Something to do?\u2013Now all of them are moving.\u00a0It will be difficult.I took out a small cloak as I finished speaking.\u00a0My figure suddenly disappeared and Lee Hyunsung spoke with confusion.\u2013Eh?\u00a0Dokja-ssi?\u2013I will give you a signal.\u00a0Then you will move.It was a gold member\u2019s privilege item, \u2018Recluse\u2019s Cloak\u2019 which was purchased for 3,000 coins.It was a five time consumable item but it could maintain \u2018absolute stealth\u2019 for 20 minutes once the ability was activated.I melted into the darkness.\u00a0It was useless against opponents with Absolute Senses Lv. 6 or higher but no one had such skills here.I passed by the drowsy guards and arrived at Han Donghoon\u2019s tent.\u00a0There was Sound Wave Blocking around the tent so I wasn\u2019t worried about anyone overhearing once I entered.He carefully opened the tent and saw a boy sitting at the keyboard alone. The dark circles were thicker than they were in the daytime.A solitary boy commenting alone.\u00a0The Prophets had turned this boy into a worn-out machine.\u00a0A propaganda machine that manipulated the future by scattering information that mixed fiction with truth.\u00a0It didn\u2019t have much effect right now but the value of this boy would grow over time.I quietly approached from behind and blocked his mouth.\u00a0Han Donghoon gasped and struggled, but it was impossible to resist me with a level 10 strength.I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out the Mental Awakening medicine that I bought along with the Recluse\u2019s Cloak. It was a huge 3,000 coins.It would be a lie if I said it wasn\u2019t regrettable, but if I could get the Hermit King of Shadows with 3,000 coins, it would be a profitable transaction.Some time after being fed the stimulant, Han Donghoon\u2019s eyes changed.\u00a0The Hypnosis effect was loosened and the boy\u2019s sense of reason started to return.\u201cU-Uhh, you\u2026\u201dHypnosis didn\u2019t mean that he forgot everything. In this little boy\u2019s head, all types of trauma would be running through them. Once the Hypnosis slipped, his sponsor would start to intervene to some extent.[The sponsor behind character \u2018Han Donghoon\u2019 has revealed himself.][The constellation \u2018Shadow behind the Curtain\u2019 has thanked you.][500 coins have been sponsored.]Han Donghoon stepped back while holding the flag in his hand.\u00a0I watched the flag closely and deliberately stepped away.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not here to snatch the flag.\u201d\u201cUh-Uwah, ah\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re smart so you should understand right away. If I wanted to harm you, I wouldn\u2019t have released Hypnosis.\u201d\u201cT-T-Then.\u201d\u201cI want to be friends.\u201dHan Donghoon\u2019s eyes shook.\u00a0I waited for a moment.\u00a0It was until the turbulence in his head calmed down.\u00a0But Han Donghoon wasn\u2019t able to speak easily.\u00a0That reminded me, this guy had a problem.\u201cIs it hard to speak directly? If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to talk through this.\u201dHan Donghoon looked at the smartphone held in his hands and started muttering something.[The character \u2018Han Donghoon\u2019 used \u2018Wide-area Internet Lv. 5\u2019 on your smartphone.][You can use the Internet anywhere in \u2018Seoul Dome\u2019 unless the consciousness of \u2018Han Donghoon\u2019 is interrupted.]After a while, Han Donghoon\u2019s name appeared in the smartphone messenger.\u2013Who are you?\u2013I\u2019ve been looking for you.\u2013Lee Sungkook also said that.\u2013I suppose so.\u2013I\u2026The boy\u2019s trembling fingers couldn\u2019t produce any more sentences.\u00a0I instinctively realized. It was impossible to persuade this boy right now.For more than 10 days, the boy\u2019s wounds had festered to the point where it couldn\u2019t be easily restored.\u2013I understand you.\u00a0It is scary and confusing.[The character \u2018Han Donghoon\u2019 is greatly disturbed.]\u2013Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u2013I am different from those people.\u2013I can\u2019t believe you.\u2013Don\u2019t you hate the Prophets?Han Donghoon\u2019s eyes shook. Deep rooted resentment filled the boy\u2019s eyes due to the hypnosis.\u2013If you allow me to, I can get rid of them.-\u2026Why? You are a prophet\u2026\u2013They shouldn\u2019t exist. They are interfering with the \u2018epilogue.\u2019Han Donghoon stared at me with eyes that couldn\u2019t understand and tapped on his keyboard.\u2013To me\u2026\u00a0What do you want?\u00a0You will just use my abilities anyway.I looked up and slowly opened my mouth.\u2013No, it is just the opposite.I stared into Han Donghoon\u2019s eyes as I spoke aloud.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* *\u201cNow those jerks time is over. It will all end tomorrow.\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026 when this is over, I will have a bottle of soju.\u201d\u201cYes. Did you see that bastard\u2019s eyes before? The Sage\u2019s Eyes glared at me and I almost had a heart attack.\u201d\u201cHahat, how did a guy who got off at the prologue know about the Sage\u2019s Eyes?\u201dCheerful voices.\u00a0It was so exciting that I wanted to keep listening.\u201cHey, the other prophets are still suspicious\u2026 how do I convince them? They\u2019ve been nagging me to go to Chungmuro\u2026\u201d\u201cGive me your phone and I will speak to them. At any rate\u2026 huh?\u201d\u00a0Jung Minseob\u2019s face stiffened as he fiddled with the keyboard.\u00a0\u201cWhy is the Internet not working all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cIs that brat sleeping again? Go check it out.\u201dJung Minseob was about to leave the tent when his body hit something.\u00a0The moment he stretched out a hand.\u201cW-What is this\u2026?\u201dChiiiiiing!\u201cAaaagh!\u201dJung Minseob fell onto the ground with a scream.\u00a0I took off the Recluse\u2019s Cloak and held the Blade of Faith.\u201cY-Yoo Jonghyuk? How come?\u201dThe confused Lee Sungkook stumbled while Jung Heewon poked her head in from outside the tent.\u201cI took care of some of them. But there are too many people\u2026 I won\u2019t last long.\u201dJung Heewon disappeared and the sound of fighting was heard from outside.\u00a0Now the guards will flock.\u201cD-Don\u2019t you know what will happen if you do this? Yoo Jonghyuk, you won\u2019t be able to deal with all of us!\u201d\u201cAll? I don\u2019t have to deal with everyone. I just need to handle you.\u201dThis remark made Lee Sungkook\u2019s lips twitch.\u201cI\u2019m sorry Yoo Jonghyuk but I can\u2019t let\u2015\u201dKudududuk!I lightly swept the ether blade towards the fallen Jung Minseob and cut the armour he was wearing. Jung Minseob screamed.\u201cAack!\u201dHis flesh was torn and a piece of cloth fell out. I picked up the piece of cloth that had fallen out.[You have won the flag of the \u2018Dongmyo Group.\u2019][Your navy flag has absorbed the cumulative achievements of the navy flag.][Your navy flag has evolved into a brown flag.][A strong flag protects you.]\u201cYou are the real representative of Dongmyo.\u201d\u201cH-How\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo matter how stupid you guys are, you wouldn\u2019t show the flag so proudly.\u201dIn the first place, it was strange for them to give the representative position to Han Donghoon.\u00a0They knew the future and wouldn\u2019t give the representative position to a character in the novel.However, Lee Sungkook wasn\u2019t the representative.\u00a0There was only one answer.[The remaining members of the Dongmyo Group are waiting for your decision.]Now the guards were meaningless.\u00a0The hopeless Jung Minseob stuttered.\u00a0\u201cY-Yoo Jonghyuk! The other prophets will know this\u2026\u201d\u201cHow will you let them know when the Internet doesn\u2019t work?\u201dLee Sungkook cried out as he realized that all their plans were broken.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhy\u2026 why are you doing this to us?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see.?

When will we go?\u201d\u201cPlease wait a moment.\u201dI looked towards the men who were heading towards me.\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201dLast night, I decided to have all members of Dongmyo join my group.\u00a0The two men in front of me was the result of that decision.Jung Minseob bowed to me and opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026Please keep me alive.\u201d\u201cMe too, me too. Sob!\u201dOriginally I planned to kill Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob, but I changed my mind. These two were useful until I completely wiped out the prophets.I put them in the Chungmuro Group and evolved the colour of the flag to \u2018brown.\u2019From the brown flag, it became possible to restrict the actions of the group members.[You have exercised the right of the representative.][Group members Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob have restrictions on their behaviour.]Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob\u2019s expression changed at the emerging system messages.\u201cOne, from now on, you can\u2019t tell others about my identity.\u201d\u201cYes, yep!\u201d\u201cTwo, you must unconditionally submit to my commands and you aren\u2019t allowed to act individually without my permission.\u201d\u201c\u2026Of course.\u201d[Group members Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob are willing to accept their limitations.][This restriction is a \u2018life\u2019 restriction.][If they break the restrictions, group members Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob will die.]I nodded and said.\u201cWell\u2026 okay. I don\u2019t know when my heart will change, but everyone work hard. I will decide while watching you.\u201dThe two of them gulped and made hilarious faces.\u00a0I didn\u2019t know what they were thinking.\u00a0In any case, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to stick to Yoo Jonghyuk so it was better to stick to me.\u201cBy the way, Representative-nim. What should we call you in the future\u2026?\u201d\u201cCall me like you are now. But call me Yoo Jonghyuk in front of the other prophets. Ah, Jung Minseob.\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d\u201cGive me the Fugitive\u2019s Mask.\u201dJung Minseob was upset but eventually gave it to me.\u00a0Anyway, I had to pretend to be Yoo Jonghyuk if I wanted to go to the Night of the Prophets. This \u2018mask\u2019 would be a preventive measure for a situation I didn\u2019t know.After a moment, the muscles on my face moved in a bizarre manner as my appearance started changing.\u00a0It felt a bit weird but I soon got used to it.\u201cHuh, this is the real appearance of Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201d\u201cVery handsome\u2026 The revelation wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201dThese bastards\u2026I wanted to snap out but I closed my mouth.\u00a0I didn\u2019t need to be angry over something like this.That reminded me, it would be better to know the details of these guys just in case.\u201cJung Minseob, what is your attribute\u2026\u201dAt this moment, a system message flashed in my head.[The history of this person has been updated.]\u2026What?I tried to use Character List once again as a test.[Character Information]Name: Jung MinseobAge: 25 years old.Constellation Support: Cursed GladiatorPrivate Attribute: Light Projection (Rare), 1089th Person to Get Off (General)Exclusive Skills: Sword Training Lv. 2, Powerful Blow Lv. 2, Berserk Lv. 3, Memory Enhancement Lv. 5]\u2026Stigma: Repay Grudges Lv. 1Overall Stats: Physique Lv. 18, Strength Lv. 16, Agility Lv. 12, Magic Power Lv. 10.Overall Evaluation: An incarnation that possesses good comprehensive skills and attributes. His sponsor is a bit lacking but his ability as a warrior is considerable. He would\u2019ve been one of the 12 apostles if he had been a bit more patient. He is very regretful.\u2026What did it mean that the Character List was updated?A person I wasn\u2019t able to see the attributes window of yesterday suddenly became a character.He was a prophet. In other words, a character outside the novel.\u00a0Why did he suddenly change into a character?\u201cOh, my attribute is\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI also confirmed the attributes of Lee Sungkook.Fortunately, his attributes were the same. Hypnotist and 9th Person to Get Off\u2026 The latter was garbage but the former was a pretty good attribute.\u201cGive me your smartphone.\u201d\u201cYep! Here it is.\u201dI received a smartphone from one of them and connected to the chat room.Ah\u2026 the Internet didn\u2019t work. Yesterday it was disconnected\u2026[The character \u2018Han Donghoon\u2019 used \u2018Wide-area Internet Lv. 5\u2019 on your smartphone.][The device\u2019s Internet is now available.]As soon as I thought it, the Internet was connected.\u00a0I glanced towards the tent where Han Donghoon was located.\u00a0There was a vibration from the smartphone, indicating that a message had arrived.\u2013I\u2019m going to believe in you just once.Maybe something changed with Han Donghoon after what happened last night.\u00a0I had been really worried about it so I was glad.I sent a reply to Han Donghoon.\u2013Thank you.Sooner or later, I would have a chance to talk to him.\u00a0I once again opened Lee Sungkook\u2019s smartphone to the Prophets chat room.[Chat Room][List of participants: No. 9, 15 I feel like Dying, 124 Let\u2019s Drop Off, No. 763, 887 Get Off, No. 645\u2026 a total of 36 people.]I looked at the numbers in their names and got a sense of who they were.\u00a0But something was strange.\u201c\u202636 people?\u201dJung Minseob answered my question.\u201cAll the prophets in the room stopped reading early. There are no apostles.\u201dI see.\u201cBy the way, Representative-nim. Didn\u2019t you say it yesterday? \u2018You should\u2019ve read to the end\u2019\u2026 then do you know all of the Book of Revelation?\u201dI looked at the expectant Jung Minseob and laughed.I knew. Do you know?\u201cYou won\u2019t regret taking my line instead of Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s.\u201d***After a while, we headed to Anguk Station while avoiding the surrounding conflict areas.It was because the Night of the Prophets was scheduled to be held.I spied on these guys through Lee Sungkook\u2019s smartphone.\u2014\u2013No. 519: \u00a0Really?\u00a0Yoo Jonghyuk is coming this evening?No. 67: \u00a0There is no doubt.\u00a0No. 9 and No. 1089 said it yesterday.887 Get Off:\u00a0The 9th is a newcomer but I can believe it if it is the 1089th\u2026124 Let\u2019s Drop Off: \u00a0This time they will all be behind us.887 Get Off:\u00a0No. 124, you are in Seoul \u314b\u314b How can those jerks fall behind you?124 Let\u2019s Drop Off: \u00a0Ah, except for me of course.\u00a0Local residents, victory\u00a0^ ^ v887 Get Off:\u00a0I would like to be a regressor\u2026\u00a0If I had read the novel at that time\u2026\u00a0No, if I had only read up to 50\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m jealous of those apostles scum\u202615 I feel like Dying:\u00a0But don\u2019t you think the people who read over 50 chapters are abnormal??\u00a0I don\u2019t know how they read to over 50. \u314b\u314b\u314b124 Let\u2019s Drop Off: \u00a0Real psychos \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u2014\u2013As expected, humans who hid behind anonymity would reveal the truth.\u00a0Perhaps the number before the nickname was where they stopped reading.\u2014\u2013No. 888:\u00a0But are you sure there is no txt version of this novel?No. 124:\u00a0A few days ago, I searched the Internet and there was really nothing left\u2026\u00a0Ahh\u2026\u00a0A novel without a txt\u2026 (tears)No. 763:\u00a0Even if you had a copy, you wouldn\u2019t share such a fraudulent thing.\u00a0If I could really sell my soul, I would buy it.\u2014\u2013The idea of trying to read Ways of Survival popped up.\u00a0These guys, they should\u2019ve read it with me at that time.Now they didn\u2019t know the days ahead.We\u2019ve arrived.\u201dI was about to say, \u201cWhat, already?\u201d when I saw the platform of Anguk Station in front of me. The prophets who arrived in advance could also be seen.But something was strange.\u201cNobody has occupied this place?\u201d\u201cYes, it is a promise between the prophets. It could be dangerous to meet at an occupied station. It is sort of like the DMZ.\u201dThen a prophet approached and waved.\u201cHey, No. 1089!\u201d\u201cOh, it is No. 763 hyung.\u201dJung Minseob waved and welcomed the person.\u201cHow have you been? You face doesn\u2019t look good?\u201d\u201cWell spotted. The Tyrant Kill is giving me hell.\u201d\u201cI told you not to advance towards the Dobong side. Why didn\u2019t you listen\u2026\u201dNo. 763 glanced towards me and his face suddenly stiffened.\u201cP-Perhaps\u2026 he is\u2026?\u201dJung Minseob nodded.No. 763\u2019s eyes showed astonishment.\u201cI-It is really an honour. Yoo Jonghyuk-nim!\u201dThe uproar caused the scattered prophets to gather one by one.\u201cIs that\u2026?\u201dThe prophets ran together and pushed in front of me.\u00a0There were also a few female prophets.\u201cHe looks better than I imagined! I am No. 998!\u201d\u201cIt is great to meet you, Yoo Jonghyuk-nim! I\u2019m No. 1055!\u201dThis\u2026 I felt like a real king.\u00a0Their shining eyes wanted to win my favour somehow.\u00a0I wondered what they would all look like when they realized I wasn\u2019t really Yoo Jonghyuk.Most of them weren\u2019t worth paying attention to.\u00a0Their knowledge of the future was dim and their abilities were poor.Yet there were some prominent people.\u201cIt was very impressive when you fought against Demon King Asmodeus in the second regression.\u201dHoh?\u201cIt was mentioned briefly in the Book of Revelations\u2026 now that I\u2019ve met Yoo Jonghyuk-nim, I feel like hearing about it from you.\u201dWays of Survival started with Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s \u2018third\u2019 regression and all the stories from the second regression were treated as recollections.Yet this guy knew about Asmodeus?\u00a0Why was he so impressed when he didn\u2019t read until the end?\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cI am No. 1168.\u201dThen he almost read to the 50th chapter.\u00a0Perhaps he was the one who read the most out of those present.No. 1168 asked me,\u00a0\u201cExcuse me, is it Yoo Jonghyuk-nim\u2019s third turn right now?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAh, as expected\u2026\u201dSome prophets had dark expressions.Yes, I knew.Ways of Survival was an infinite loop so those who discovered that it was early on in Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s regressions would be quite disappointed.These jerks, they only got the cute side of Yoo Jonghyuk in the beginning\u2026 in any case, those who didn\u2019t read until the end weren\u2019t satisfied.Then there was a disturbance behind me.\u201cLee Hyunsung-nim!\u201d\u201cSteel Sword Lee Hyunsung?\u201dLee Hyunsung blushed as he was surrounded by people.\u201cW-What are you doing? I\u2019m not the Steel\u2026 I\u2019m not that!\u201d\u201cWow, just like a real revelation. Look at those biceps!\u201d\u201cOhhh! So taut!\u201dLee Hyunsung had a good-looking face and was quite popular among the female prophets. At that time, one passing prophet showed interest in Jung Heewon.\u201cExcuse, perhaps\u2026 are you Maritime Admiral Lee Jihye?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen are you\u2026\u201d\u201cI am Jung Heewon. Why?\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201dThe disappointed prophet moved past Jung Heewon towards Lee Hyunsung.\u00a0Jung Heewon looked at the situation and spoke to me in Group Chat.\u2013Why\u2026 isn\u2019t anyone interested in me?\u2013Heewon-ssi isn\u2019t famous in the future.\u2013Che.\u2013So do well from now on.I turned away from the miserable Jung Heewon.\u00a0I came to the Night of the Prophets for a reason.\u00a0I couldn\u2019t waste time talking like this.\u201cWhere is the weapon?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThe weapon you have hidden. I will check it first.\u201d\u201cAh, here it is.\u201dThe 763th prophet excitedly moved to the centre of the platform and removed the cloth covering something.

At this point, Yoo Jonghyuk-nim might not know\u2026 according to the Book of Revelation, it contained a powerful weapon.\u201d\u201cA weapon?\u201d\u201cYes! That\u2019s correct. Maybe it is a weapon like a top ranking star relic.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t the meteorite need hatching time and can\u2019t be used now?\u201d\u201cHaha, we have a rotation that will provide magic power. It will hatch tonight at the latest. We have been working on it for a few days\u2026\u201dI became colder as I looked at this proud bastard.A red pattern.\u00a0It was nonsense.\u00a0This thing shouldn\u2019t be known until at least the fourth regression?\u201cWhich bastard gave you the information?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThat person who brought the meteorite to you.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2026 No. 1124, he was the first one\u2026\u201dNo. 1124?\u00a0A person who stopped reading early on knew this information?\u201cWhere is he?\u201dJung Minseob looked around the place and muttered.\u201cUh\u2026 I guess he hasn\u2019t come yet.\u201dThe informant didn\u2019t come.\u00a0I thought for a moment before opening my mouth.\u201cWe have to get out of here.\u201dIt was a trap.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cRight now.\u201dThis was the first time I got a cold sweat since Ways of Survival became a reality and since meeting Yoo Jonghyuk the first time.This was a weapon?\u00a0Who was stupid enough to think like this\u2026I glanced around at the prophets staring at me with naive eyes.\u00a0Then the platform started vibrating.Kukukung\u2026!I looked at the trembling \u2018meteorite\u2019 and stepped back.\u00a0I had come here to sweep away the prophets, only to be the one swept away.\u201cW-What is this?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJung Minseob made a stupid noise.Dammit.

What\u2026\u201dIt was too late.\u00a0The red aura spread across the platform and a faint veil surrounded the station.\u00a0Now none of the prophets would be able to leave Anguk Station.[The constellations protest against the excessive filtering.][Many constellations\u2019 eyes are shining at the \u2018omen.\u2019][The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is watching the situation with curious eyes.][The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 is expecting your brilliant strategy.]The constellations were excited and sent me indirect messages.The most dangerous situation in the world of Ways of Survival was one where the constellations were partying.I asked the nervous Jung Minseob,\u00a0\u201cWas No. 1124 the one who suggested that you gather here today?\u201d\u201cHuh? I don\u2019t know. We all agreed together\u2026\u201dI felt clogged up, like someone had fed me ten sweet potatoes.\u00a0I couldn\u2019t believe things had gone this far.\u2013Everybody move behind me.I paid attention the meteorite while protecting them.\u2013Aren\u2019t we running away?\u2013We can\u2019t go.\u00a0If you look behind, you can see a ward.\u2013Huh?\u00a0What ward?I didn\u2019t answer as I stared at the meteorite in the centre of the platform.[Meteorite] was the main event in the fifth scenario.\u00a0The danger sleeping inside the meteorite would differ depending on the colour, brightness, size and type.\u00a0However, the meteorite I was looking at now was one that should never hatch.They seemed confused because the meteorite that gave the star relic in the third regression was \u2018bright red\u2019\u2026\u201cI wonder what star relic will appear?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dSome prophets hadn\u2019t noticed yet and touched the meteorite.[An omen of the fifth main scenario has appeared.]Then the message popped up.\u201cEh? What is this?\u201d\u201cWhy suddenly the main scenario\u2026\u201dThe surface of the meteorite cracked and a red light poured out.\u00a0The first thing the light touched was the prophet staring at the meteorite with wonder.The body of the prophet who lost his head slowly fell to the ground like a broken doll.\u201cWhat is going on?!\u201dThe prophets screamed and retreated, but they were already unable to escape the crisis.I took the party with me as I retreated to the edge and observed the situation.\u00a0I remembered seeing this type of meteorite in Ways of Survival but it was tricky to know what would come out.Please, don\u2019t let it be that \u2018disaster.\u2019\u00a0The meteorite cracked and red lava poured out.The surrounding platform burned and released a bad smell. Then the temperature of the air rose rapidly and breathing became painful.The surrounding environment was changing.\u00a0This\u2026 a lava zone?\u00a0It meant\u2026[The 5th grade fire dragon species, \u2018Lesser Dragon Igneel\u2019 has appeared!]\u201cFuck!

However, the meteorite stretched out a long tail and caught a few escaping prophets.\u201cKuaaack!\u201dThe body of the prophet that caught by the tail suddenly burned up. Some prophets used skills to attack the tail but their weapons started to melt.\u201cT-This monster\u2026\u201dThe meteorite was at most two metres in length, but the monster crawling out from the gap was over five metres long.Jung Heewon asked.\u2013What the hell is this?\u2013It is a disaster.\u2013Disaster?The remainder of the meteorite split apart and a dragon species entered this dimension.Kuoooooh!A violent dragon that was just born.\u00a0Despite being a deteriorated version of a hatchling, a dragon still reigned at the apex of all monsters.A 6th grade monster could wipe out all the prophets here and this was a 5th grade fire dragon.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk-nim!\u201dSome of the prophets called out to me and all attention was still focused this way.I frowned.\u00a0The incident was caused by them yet they wanted me to solve it?\u201cGet back to the edges.\u201dLike an obedient puppy, everyone moved to a corner of the platform. The guys who were quick were already running upstairs from the platform. But.\u201cShit, there\u2019s a ward!\u201dThe lesser dragon was a \u2018disaster.\u2019\u00a0In a situation where a disaster appeared, the size of the despair was different.\u00a0At least, this was the pattern I knew.Among Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s numerous regressions, he had definitely faced this guy.I looked at the party members.\u2013A hidden scenario will soon start.\u2013Hidden scenario?\u2013This is a guy who shouldn\u2019t have come out in the fourth scenario.\u00a0It has an unusual difficulty so there will soon be an intervention.In order to respond to this disaster, various benefits were needed in the fifth scenario.\u00a0For example, if the blue meteorite came out\u2026But now we had nothing.\u00a0Yes, something had to be given to balance us.[Some constellations are complaining about the unusual scenario difficulty.]Indeed.\u00a0The next moment, sparks flew in the air and a small child-like presence appearance.It wasn\u2019t a low grade dokkaebi like Bihyung.\u00a0He wore a tidy suit with two little horns on his head.\u00a0He was an impressive guy with a small lump protruding from his side pocket.I didn\u2019t know his name but I knew what he was.\u00a0He was an intermediate dokkaebi.[Hrmm. This is difficult. How did you guys get this \u2018root\u2019? It was only installed recently\u2026]Once his voice rang out, the movements of the lesser dragon stopped.\u00a0Indeed, it was possible for an intermediate dokkaebi to intervene in the scenario to this level.[A disaster woke up in the fourth scenario?]The emergence of an intermediate dokkaebi meant that the \u2018early scenarios\u2019 had almost come to an end.As long as he took notice of this place, I would barely be able to see the contract benefits with Bihyung.[Some constellations are poisonous so I can\u2019t spare you\u2026 it is also hard to downgrade the difficulty\u2026]His gaze focused on me.\u201cBut this isn\u2019t right! We haven\u2019t cleared the fourth scenario!\u201d\u00a0One prophet shouted.I could see the prophets around him quickly covering his mouth.\u00a0There was nothing good about yelling at a dokkaebi right now.[I have decided. I won\u2019t downgrade the difficulty.]The prophets glared at the dokkaebi.\u00a0There was only the sound of breathing.\u00a0They had read Ways of Survival so they would know.The dokkaebi couldn\u2019t overturn the laws.\u00a0But they also knew this.[Still\u2026 it won\u2019t be interesting if you all die this way. I will use my discretion to change the scenario content.]The dokkaebi was more talkative than I thought.[The hidden scenario has arrived!]The lesser dragon started moving again.\u00a0The red leather-covered paws hit the floor of the platform.\u00a0I avoided the scattered debris and looked at the scenario that arrived.+[Hidden Scenario \u2013 United You Die, Scattered You Die]Category: HiddenDifficulty: AClear Conditions: Within the time limit, hunt down the \u2018lesser dragon Igneel\u2019 or survive his attacks.Time Limit: 20 minutes.Compensation: 3,000 coinsFailure: DeathHidden pieces are hidden in this mission.+A 20 minute survival mission.\u00a0From the title to the contents, it was ridiculous.Lee Hyunsung asked.\u2013Do we have to hunt him?\u2013No, don\u2019t even dream about it.This disaster is a disaster for a reason.\u00a0Even the real Yoo Jonghyuk couldn\u2019t catch a 5th grade fire dragon.\u00a0I looked at the situation on the platform.\u00a0Flowing flames started pouring out.Kwa kwa kwa kwa!\u201cKuaaack!\u201dThe prophets caught in the flames turned to ashes.\u00a0The walls burned by the flames melted and distorted terribly.\u00a0He was slowly moving to this side.\u201cEveryone run counterclockwise!\u201dI opened my mouth and ran ahead of the rotation direction.Fortunately, Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung followed me well. Jung Minseob and Lee Sungkook were a bit behind but they still seemed okay.This time, we avoided it because I knew the pattern.\u00a0The problem was that this type of attack wouldn\u2019t always occur.[The 5th grade fire dragon species, \u2018Lesser Dragon Igneel\u2019 is preparing the \u2018Flames of Destruction\u2019.]\u2026It had started.\u00a0We somehow avoided the general attack but the crisis came now.\u201cLook for a foothold.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cNumber 5\u2026 or 2 and 3!

Ah, right!\u201d\u201cThere is a hidden piece!\u201dI looked at the moving prophets and bit my lips.\u00a0The giggling constellations reflected in my eyes.\u00a0Why did many constellations protest against the difficulty of the scenario?It was simple.\u00a0There was no fun in a story with \u2018only death.\u2019\u00a0They didn\u2019t want ants being trampled by a giant.\u00a0These guys wanted the ants to fight back to survive.\u00a0In order to live, the ants would even bit at their kin.[Many constellations are watching the situation with excited eyes.]Damn constellation scum.\u201cShit, go!\u201d\u201cKuheeok!\u201dThe prophets, who had called each other\u2019s numbers in a friendly manner, now wielded their weapons against each other to fight over the footholds with the number \u20181.\u2019 Some prophets collapsed bleeding as they approached a foothold.The swift prophets were already stepping on the footholds, strengthening their alertness.I kept an eye on them.\u00a0Someone had clearly planned this trap.\u00a0Maybe they were the apostles.They knew the prophets would gather her and decided to use this opportunity to wipe out those who stopped reading early.It was a good idea.\u00a0No matter how trivial the information, the fewer who knew the future, the better.Usually, the apostles would be laughing at the prophets from far away.\u00a0If they were \u2018ordinary\u2019 people.Those who read more than 50 chapters of a boring novel weren\u2019t normal.\u00a0They called themselves apostles and were greedy enough to control information.\u2018If they were intelligent enough to use the red meteor as a trap, wouldn\u2019t they know how to overcome the disaster?If I was like this\u2026\u2013Representative-nim!\u00a0There is no foothold.\u2013There is nothing here!Jung Heewon and Jung Minseob cried out urgently.\u00a0There were no footholds in the place where out party was located.\u2013Oh, there is one here!\u00a0But\u2026The foothold that was barely found had an ominous number.\u00a0Four.\u00a0In other words, only four people could survive on that foothold.\u00a0But our party had five people.[The 5th grade fire dragon species, \u2018Lesser Dragon Igneel\u2019 is using the \u2018Flames of Destruction\u2019.]A huge spark started from the centre of the platform and started to spread throughout the station.It was a lesser dragon\u2019s full attack skill.\u00a0The heat was enough to burn my skin despite being so far away.\u00a0If the shield wasn\u2019t activated now, my party would be destroyed.\u201cR-Representative-nim?\u201dLee Sungkook and Jung Minseob trembled as they met my gaze.\u00a0I grasped the handle of Unbroken Faith.At that moment.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk-nim!\u201dI looked back and saw one prophet.\u00a0The number \u20182\u2019 was written on his foothold.\u00a0Despite the urgent situation, this man still looked relaxed.\u201cCome this way!\u201dThis guy\u2026?\u00a0A few memories passed by quickly.\u00a0I ran towards him while shouting at the people behind him.\u201cActivate the shield!\u201d[Absolute Shield is activated!]Kuoooooh!Then the flames burned everything on the platform.\u00a0If it had touched me just a little bit then I would\u2019ve melted.\u201cSigh\u2026 I\u2019m glad.\u201dThe man who triggered the shield at breathtaking timing sighed with relief.\u00a0I asked him,\u00a0\u201cWho are you?\u201dThe man laughed lightly.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m disappointed.

This is a promise on the king\u2019s honour.\u201dMy heart was pounding from the precise threat.\u00a0They were actually this bold against Yoo Jonghyuk.\u00a0It was rare to find this in someone who read Ways of Survival.\u201cWho is your king? Where did they get off?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 the king dislikes being called someone who \u2018got off.\u2019\u201d\u201cSo what do you call them?\u201d\u201cEven if you are Yoo Jonghyuk-nim, please refrain from speaking about him like that. He is the only one among the prophets who has read all the revelations. He knows both Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s past and future.\u201d\u2026What?\u00a0I was surprised for a moment but didn\u2019t greatly panic.\u00a0This was interesting.\u00a0There was another reader who read all of the novel?Laughter emerged.\u00a0It was a ridiculing laugh.\u00a0It was because there absolutely couldn\u2019t be such a thing.Kuooooh!Finally, the third attack of the fire dragon was about to begin.\u00a0I looked at the apostle and quietly stepped out of the foothold.The bewildered apostle asked as I walked forward.\u00a0\u201cYoo Jonghyuk-nim? What are you doing?\u201dThe party members far away were also surprised.\u00a0I waved my hands.\u2013Don\u2019t worry.\u00a0No matter what happens, you absolutely can\u2019t move from there.\u00a0Understood?I walked in the direction of the lesser dragon.\u00a0It was with slow but sure steps.\u00a0The fire dragon stared ferociously at me as it prepared the Flames of Destruction.\u201cWhat are you doing?! Come back!\u201dThe apostle behind me hastily exclaimed.\u00a0I turned around and smiled at him.\u201cDid the king tell you about this future?\u201dAs I listened to him, I kept thinking.\u00a0These guys shouldn\u2019t be alive.\u00a0But they had a \u2018strategy\u2019 and I couldn\u2019t kill them all by myself.\u00a0If so\u2026 I laughed and continued talking.\u201cYou guys, have you forgotten what my stigma is?\u201dIf I was them.\u00a0What would they \u2018fear\u2019 the most right now?\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of death. I can just start over again.\u201dThe answer was simple.\u00a0They believed I was Yoo Jonghyuk.\u00a0If that was the case\u2026\u201cI wonder. What will the effect be on you? You are unusual presences in this turn.\u201d\u00a0The most \u2018fearful\u2019 thing to them was what I feared most.\u00a0\u201cIf I die here, will you exist in the next turn? Or will you end with this world?\u201dThey didn\u2019t want Yoo Jonghyuk to die.\u201cIf you really read the revelations, you should know the answer right?\u201dThe apostles\u2019 faces paled.\u00a0There were times when it was easier to handle those who used their heads.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk!\u201dThe five apostles moved from the footholds and started to run towards me.\u00a0I knew it.\u00a0No matter how unconcerned they pretended to be, they were people who \u2018got off\u2019 and were caught up in this scenario.What would happen to them in a world where the protagonist was dead?\u00a0They didn\u2019t know.\u201cCatch him quickly!\u201dJust like me.[The 5th grade fire dragon species, \u2018Lesser Dragon Igneel\u2019 is using the \u2018Flames of Destruction\u2019.]The moment that flames burst out from the centre of the platform, I exploded all the strength in my muscles and ran towards the legs of the dragon.

It was a boy around 10 years or so. There was a boy sleeping on his thigh.\u201cWhy am I like this\u2026?\u201dGong Pildu wondered as he looked down at the sleepy Lee Gilyoung.\u00a0His old memories surfaced.\u00a0A young child.\u00a0Lee Gilyoung was his daughter\u2019s age.He shook his head and sighed.\u2013Pildu-ssi, we should stop now\u2026\u2013Daddy.\u00a0How long are you going to keep talking about land?There was a time when he was the breadwinner of the family.He earned money to feed his family and buy land.

She was smiling on the outside but he couldn\u2019t help feeling uncomfortable.Duduk.\u00a0Duk.\u00a0Duk.Then a sound was heard in the distance.\u00a0Yoo Sangah\u2019s expression hardened while Lee Gilyoung woke up in a flash from where he was sleeping on Gong Pildu\u2019s knees.\u00a0The antennae of the cockroach on his back shook.Ku ku ku ku!Line 4, the tunnel from Hoehyeong.\u00a0Something was coming this way.\u00a0Yoo Sangah stood up while Gong Pildu used a skill.[The character \u2018Gong Pildu\u2019 has activated \u2018Armed Zone Lv. 8!]Gong Pildu bit his lips.\u00a0This might be an intuition only rich land owners got.

It was much easier than when Emergency Defense was taking place.As the dozens of ground rats collapsed on the ground, the same thought entered the minds of the Chungmuro members.\u00a0It was easy. It truly was worth everyone cooperating.Then they heard a voice from the tunnel.\u201cAs expected, Hamelin\u2019s Flute isn\u2019t enough?\u201d\u201cHow can the 9th grade species compare to a place eaten by Yoo Jonghyuk?\u201dA group of people appeared from the darkness.\u00a0Four men and one woman.Gong Pildu\u2019s expression hardened.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know the reason.

Lee Jihye was a great power.\u00a0Yet Gong Pildu still felt uneasy.\u00a0He was anxious and growled like a frightened beast.\u201cWho are you? Where did you come from?\u201d\u201cIt is real. The Maritime Admiral and Armed Fortress Master has become a team.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t an answer that came back but words that were close to mocking.Gong Pildu asked,\u00a0\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying? Quickly go back. Otherwise I will shoot to kill!\u201dHowever, the five men and women didn\u2019t look at Gong Pildu. They just continued talking to each other.\u201cWho is on the dragon side?\u201d\u201cNumbers 5, 6, 8 and 9.

Quickly sweep them away.\u201dThe first one who came forward was a man in his 30s with a bulging belly.He was a man with the number \u20187\u2019 on his shoulders. He had thick eyebrows and looked at Lee Jihye\u2019s white legs like they were to his taste.\u201cI will take the Maritime Admiral. She isn\u2019t a big deal without the sea.\u201d\u201cWhat are you bastards saying?\u201dLee Jihye cried out sharply and rushed forward. Gong Pildu realized it couldn\u2019t be helped and infused magic power into the turrets.\u201cDamn, just go to hell!\u201dDududududu!The man with a \u20184\u2019 on his cloak laughed.\u201cAs expected from one of the Ten Evils. If we came a bit later, we would\u2019ve been swept away.\u201d\u201cNumbers 3 and 4. You two take Gong Pildu. Be vigilant and attack the turrets one by one.\u201dThe man with a \u20183\u2019 on his forehead nodded.\u201cYes\u2026 I understand. One of the 10 Evils can be handled by both of us.\u201d\u201cNumber 2, you handle the rest.\u201dThe woman with a \u20182\u2019 on her cheek frowned.\u00a0She was holding a small flute in her hand.\u201cWhy do I have to handle such petty reason?\u201d\u201cIt is the most appropriate for you.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dThen the man with a \u20181\u2019 on the dark cloak opened his mouth.\u201cI will be taking the flag holder.\u201d \u300dThe moment of immersion was broken and consciousness returned.\u00a0Now it all made sense.Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint.\u00a0I had a similar experience the last time I was in the ichthyosaur\u2019s stomach.\u00a0At that time, I saw Yoo Jonghyuk.By the way, it was amazing.\u00a0I thought I had prepared for the apostles but it wasn\u2019t enough.\u00a0I was able to guess their thoroughness just from the items they brought.There was Hamelin\u2019s Flute that could control the ground rats and the Magic Power Bullet Shield that could defend against Gong Pildu\u2019s attack.They really wanted to capture Chungmuro, obtain Yoo Jonghyuk and devour this world.But it wouldn\u2019t be so easy.\u300c \u201cW-What? Was the Maritime Admiral this strong in the beginning? Hey, isn\u2019t something wrong?\u201dIt was the 7th Apostle who cried out first.Lee Jihye\u2019s sharp sword pushed the 7th Apostle back little by little. It was natural. The current Lee Jihye was much stronger than the Lee Jihye in the original \u2018third turn.\u2019\u201cDamn, why are these two turrets so hard?\u201dNumber 3 and 4 were in trouble.The 2nd Apostle playing Hamelin\u2019s Flute was also struggling due to Yoo Sangah\u2019s Binding Thread and Lee Gilyoung\u2019s Mjolnir\u2019s Thunder.In the end, it was the 1st Apostle who came forward.\u00a0He frowned before pulling something out and lighting it.\u00a0Then he threw it at the Chungmuro party.Kwaaaaang\u2015!\u00a0\u300dThere was a loud roar and Chungmuro\u2019s platform was covered with explosions.\u00a0I was startled.\u2026This son of a bitch?[Mass Destruction Magic Bullet]It was hard to deal huge damage to top monsters but against humans, it was the most powerful weapon of mass destruction.It was a weapon that could be made with some items that appeared in the Gangseo and Gangnam areas, as well as some items bought from the Dokkaebi Bag.Then he was the \u2018king\u2019 of the apostles.\u00a0The purple flag on his back proved it.The dust settled down, revealing the Chungmuro platform.\u00a0My chest was becoming stuffy.\u00a0If the apostles had this then the situation was unfavourable.The dust cleared and the fallen Chungmuro group members were seen.\u00a0People were coughing up blood.Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung were lying on their floor. Even Gong Pildu couldn\u2019t completely avoid getting injured despite using Protective Wall.\u300c \u201cPhew, now it looks good. Right?\u201dThe 7th Apostle grabbed Lee Jihye\u2019s head while her uniform was torn. She was in the front and received the biggest blow from the explosion.\u201cAren\u2019t you just a supporting actor, huh?\u201d\u201cBastards\u2026cough!\u201d\u00a0Lee Jihye screamed as she was punched in the stomach.\u201cCan I have this gurl?\u201d\u201cWhat will you do with her?

Things have turned completely upside down. What skills do you have? Why can\u2019t I access the information even when I ask the Supervisory Bureau?]I was curious as well.\u00a0I also wanted to see my attributes window.\u2018So what happened? Am I going to be penalized?\u2019[Where did you hear that? Hey, do you know how hard I defended you? Administrator, please listen to me. Kim Dokja isn\u2019t a scammer or a strange person! He is just a very hard worker!]He speak in a convincing manner.[Fortunately, my earnest appeal was taken into consideration. I\u2019ve analyzed the entire scenario and found that you only used a few skills. It isn\u2019t enough to destroy the ecology of the scenarios.]It was as I expected.\u00a0I didn\u2019t learn passive skills for no reason.\u00a0The more good skills I used, the easier it was to attract the attention of the Bureau.[Besides, there are some loud guys in other areas\u2026 the Bureau is busy right now.]\u2018Then it worked out well?\u2019[In fact, there are a few jerks\u2026 but instructions came down from the upper management and the \u2018great dokkaebi\u2019 said to dismiss it.]I was amazed by the unexpected words.\u00a0The great dokkaebi interfered?[Sigh\u2026 listen to the intermediate dokkaebi. I shouldn\u2019t be here. There are suddenly more eyes on me. You should be careful. This is the jurisdiction of the intermediate dokkaebi and he has a firm grudge against you.]\u2018Grudge?\u2019[Don\u2019t you know. The plausibility meeting is like a tax investigation. In any case\u2026 you will have a hard time for a while.]Bihyung disappeared. Then there was a huge spark in the air and the intermediate dokkaebi showed up in a formal suit. He looked around for a while before speaking in a gruff voice.[\u2026I\u2019m sorry everyone. There was a bit of friction and the compensation was late. It is late but I will now reward you.][3,000 coins have been acquired for clearing the hidden scenario.][You have earned 15,000 coins as compensation for killing the 5th grade fire dragon.][You have obtained the \u2018Protection Symbol of the Imyuntar\u2019 for being the first to prevent a disaster.][In the future, you will get the favour of the Imyuntar people.]Fortunately, the compensation was paid normally.\u00a0In addition, the Protection Symbol of the Imyuntar.\u00a0Now that I got this, the upcoming fifth scenario wouldn\u2019t be so bad.It wasn\u2019t as much as what I got but the faces of the other party members were hilarious once they received a clear reward.By the way\u2026 stingy bastards.\u00a0I caught a disaster and these were the only rewards?Then the intermediate dokkaebi started talking.[By the way, you worked so hard that there was a bit of a problem with the scenario.]There was something sarcastic and ominous about his tone.[As a result of discussions with the Bureau, it was reported that the average skill of the local incarnations doesn\u2019t match the difficulty of the scenario. Therefore, I have arbitrarily adjusted the difficulty level in my area using my own judgment.]\u2026What?\u00a0A random adjustment?[The time limit of the fourth scenario has been significantly reduced.]The mouth of the intermediate dokkaebi curved up strangely as he looked at me.\u2026No, this bastard?[There are 48 hours left until the end of the fourth scenario.][All group representatives and members who haven\u2019t taken over the target within the next 48 hours will die.]Yes\u2026 this was what he was planning?\u00a0Jung Minseob stared at me from where he was picking up the fallen items.\u00a0Everyone had probably heard the message.\u201cWho has Changsin Station now?\u201d\u201cT-The Tyrant King.\u201dOne of the seven kings of Seoul, the Tyrant King\u2026I said with a sigh,\u00a0\u201cThen let\u2019s return to Chungmuro.\u201dBy the way, I didn\u2019t know if Yoo Jonghyuk was doing well or not.\u00a0Let\u2019s wrap up the fourth scenario.***The distance from Anguk Station to Chungmuro was further than I thought. During the journey, we exchanged a few stories.Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung walked ahead, while I walked in the rear with Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob.I couldn\u2019t take the entire body of the fire dragon so I put half of it on the exchange. The other half was also placed on the exchange, but I deliberately put it at a ridiculously high price. It wasn\u2019t for sale but a trick to use the exchange as a warehouse substitute. Bihyung grumbled but I ignored it. Jung Minseob opened his mouth.\u201cBy the way, Representative-nim.\u201dIt felt strange because I really felt like a big company\u2019s president when I kept being called \u2018Representative-nim.\u2019\u201cIs your name Kim Dokja?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 it really is your name\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it unusual?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. Honestly, you are more like a prophet than we are.\u201dHis voice was rather subdued.\u201cSigh\u2026 if only I hadn\u2019t stopped reading\u2026\u201dIt was a belated regret.\u00a0At this moment, I had a moment of doubt. There was something I wanted to ask but I had forgotten.\u201cJung Minseob-ssi, I want to ask you something.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow did the prophets gather so quickly?\u201dThis was a point that I always found strange.\u00a0It hadn\u2019t been more than a month since the initial scenario started.\u00a0However, these guys had already been working as a group.Furthermore, the apostles were even worse.\u00a0Based on the first person protagonist\u2019s point of view, they had a fairly high armed force that couldn\u2019t be obtained without occupying a large number of stations.It was a growth that couldn\u2019t be understood with my common sense.\u201cThere was someone who called us together.\u201d\u201cCalled you together?\u201d\u201cYes. Soon after the first scenario ended, he came to the station where I was.\u201dInteresting.\u00a0How was this possible?\u00a0At that point, there would still be a barrier between stations.\u201cHe introduced himself as an apostle and said that he had read the great Book of Revelations. He recruited prophets to follow him. The odd thing was that it happened simultaneously in different stations. It is hard to believe it was done by one person\u2026\u201d\u201cIn any case, we gathered because of that apostle. He pulled us into the group.\u201d\u201cYes, we call that apostle the 1st Apostle.\u201d\u201cIs he the king of the prophets? The person who hates being called someone who \u2018got off\u2019?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 you already know. Yes. He likes to be called another name.\u201dAnother name?\u201cHe claims to be a \u2018true reader.\u2019\u201d\u2026What?\u201cThere was a lot of talk about why he would call himself such a name. We couldn\u2019t come to a conclusion. He claimed to have read all of the Book of Revelations but\u2026\u201dAs the story continued, this person\u2019s identity became more and more doubtful.\u00a0When I thought about the information he took advantage of, he didn\u2019t seem like a \u2018reader\u2019\u2026I was busy thinking when Chungmuro approached.\u00a0It hadn\u2019t been long since I left but I felt like I had returned to my hometown as I took in the air of Chungmuro Station.I restrained my companions from entering the station.\u201cWait a minute.\u201dThinking about it, I was still naked.\u00a0Why hadn\u2019t anyone said anything?I spoke to Lee Sungkook.\u00a0\u201cLee Sungkook-ssi, please take off your pants.\u201dI took the lead to enter Chungmuro Station, while Lee Sungkook was forced to walk behind me in his underwear.I could see Yoo Sangah welcoming me in the distance. I looked into her moist eyes and could see how hard it had been.Something ran into me and I saw Lee Gilyoung attached to my right leg.\u201cHave you been well?\u201dThe dusty Lee Gilyoung nodded.Lee Jihye had a serious injury and hadn\u2019t woken up yet. Gong Pildu scoffed and turned his head as soon as he saw me.[The constellation \u2018Defense Master\u2019 reproaches you on your late return.]It was a reaction I could understand since his incarnation nearly died.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi!\u201dLee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon didn\u2019t know what happened in Chungmuro and ran towards the people with an aghast expression. People around the platform were bleeding. In fact, Yoo Sangah had a cloth bound tightly to her shoulder.Some of the railroad tracks were covered with blood. They were traces of a fierce fight. Jung Minseob stuttered,\u00a0\u201cT-The apostles?\u201dThe heads of number 2, 3, 4 and 7 were lined up side by side on the railroad tracks. Their expressions seemed like they didn\u2019t realize their own death. I knew who was this skillful.I asked Lee Gilyoung.\u201cWhere is Yoo Jonghyuk?\u201dAs I spoke, I felt an ominous presence from the Hoehyeong tunnel side.\u00a0I knew despite the distance.\u00a0Our arrogant and dignified hero\u00a0 practiced the Alone Under Heaven and Earth scripture.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk?\u201dHe looked at me with no change in his expression.\u00a0I thought he would say something about what happened in the Theatre Dungeon\u2026 but what was this?The cut off head of a person was still being held in his hands.\u00a0Someone screamed while Yoo Jonghyuk threw the head this way.The head rolling like a toy was covered with a cloak with \u20181\u2019 on it.\u00a0It was the 1st Apostle.Yoo Jonghyuk was really great.\u00a0He chased this guy to the end and killed him.I was half relieved and half anxious.\u00a0I still had questions but if the apostle died like this\u2026At this moment, something ridiculous happened.\u201cIt is you! You screwed up my plan! Right?\u201dThe severed head suddenly started talking to me.\u201cWaaack! What?\u201d\u00a0Jung Minseob screamed and fell over.The eyes looked up at me while he smiled smugly.\u00a0It was impossible.The skills that could be used even when the head was cut off was extremely rare even in Ways of Survival.\u00a0It was possible if he used the skill Immortal Delay but even with that skill, he couldn\u2019t stay in a state with his head cut off.Besides, there was no blood from the cut neck\u2026Wait. Perhaps?The information that I received from Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob started to run through my head.A man who revealed himself to all prophets and claimed to be a \u2018true reader.\u2019\u00a0He appeared all over Seoul as soon as the scenario began and gathered people.\u00a0In addition, it was possible to pass through the barriers, he didn\u2019t die when his head was cut and there was no blood\u2026\u201cThe Avatar ability\u2026\u201dI was certain. The guy in front of me was a fake.The severed head continued to speak.\u201cWow, I am really impressed.

Then shouldn\u2019t you know?\u201d\u201cIt is fun to be an omniscient creator?\u201dHe giggled like a leisurely villain while I regained my composure.\u00a0No matter how I looked, he wasn\u2019t the author of Ways of Survival.If he was really the writer of Ways of Survival, there was no way he wouldn\u2019t know that he gave me a text version.\u201cBy the way, it is interesting. I thought the woman in Seodaemun Prison would be the last apostle but a man like you was hiding\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Seodaemun prison?\u201d\u201cHmm, you don\u2019t know yet? Let\u2019s trade.

I know more than you\u2026\u201dAt this moment, something flashed in his eyes.\u201cWait a minute, perhaps?\u201dThe moment he realized something, I also noticed something.\u00a0This guy, was it \u2018him\u2019?\u00a0Right now, there were five truths that I knew.One, he had read Ways of Survival.\u00a0Two, his occupation was a \u2018writer.\u2019\u00a0Three, he wasn\u2019t the writer who wrote Ways of Survival.\u00a0Four, he wrote a \u2018text\u2019 that told the future.\u00a0Five, his knowledge was only \u2018somewhat\u2019 accurate.I read through 3,149 chapters of Ways of Survival.As far as I knew, Ways of Survival wasn\u2019t popular and there was no illegal text version. But if he was the guy that I thought\u2026 it would be understandable if this guy had a \u2018text\u2019 version and knew a lot about Ways of Survival.I opened my mouth.\u201cDo you like to live while copying others?\u201d\u201cW-What?\u201dHis eyes were shaken.\u00a0There was no doubt.

Joining hands\u2026\u201dLife started to creep into Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes as he looked at me. I couldn\u2019t inside his mind so I was going crazy. Yoo Jonghyuk slowly moved his sword towards me. The 1st Apostle\u2019s momentum rose as he shouted.\u201cGo ahead and kill him! Kill him!\u201d\u201cOne is a prophet and one is a revelator\u2026\u201d\u201cKill him!Peok!\u00a0Yoo Jonghyuk trampled on the head of the 1st Apostle.\u201cKuk\u2026 what?\u201d\u201cIf you really know the future then let me ask you one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe blade moved to my neck.\u00a0The \u2018One Sword\u2019 that I experienced through Yoo Jonghyuk was now heading towards me.\u00a0I felt a sting and something warm flowed down my neck.\u201cHey! What are you doing?\u201dThe surprised Jung Heewon ran towards this side.\u00a0I raised my hand and restrained the party.\u00a0I was nervous but it wasn\u2019t good to stimulate Yoo Jonghyuk here.Yoo Jonghyuk asked the 1st Apostle.\u201cI will ask you. Will I kill this guy now or not?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you have really received a revelation of the future, you will know my choice.\u201d\u2026This bastard had a bad habit.\u00a0He was doing this again?The face of the 1st Apostle looked agonized. Maybe I was the same on the \u2018Even Bridge.\u2019 Surprisingly, the answer came quickly.\u201cOf course you will kill him! You must do it!\u201dIt was a face full of strong convictions.\u00a0His face was arrogantly assured that Yoo Jonghyuk would act like this.\u201cCome on, kill him! And\u2026!\u201dThe sword moved.\u00a0But what followed wasn\u2019t the sound of flesh being cut.Kwajik!The head of the 1st Apostle burst as it was stepped on.The person wouldn\u2019t die because it was an avatar, but he would suffer considerable psychological damage.Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s sword was soon removed.\u201cHe was a mouthy bastard.\u201dI was a bit stunned.\u00a0Yoo Jonghyuk chose to spare me?\u00a0I felt a bit shaken.\u00a0I wasn\u2019t sure\u2026Yoo Jonghyuk stared at me for a moment before walking away.\u201cHey! Where are you going?\u201dThis jerk, he must think he was so cool.\u2026Honestly, he was a bit cool.\u201cJust wait! Are you going to leave with Lee Jihye?\u201d\u201cSince the future has changed, the plan has also changed.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you act together with me? I can help you.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk turned towards me.\u00a0I reflexively shrank back at his eyes.\u201cThe debt is paid off. My last favour is not taking away your flag.\u201dThis bastard? But I couldn\u2019t retreat like this.\u201cIn any case, you can\u2019t leave the station unless I remove you from the group. Do you want to receive the punishment?\u201dYoo Jonghyuk slowly moved his hand towards the hilt of his sword. I quickly added.\u201cI know what your plan is. Aren\u2019t you going towards Jung-gu? It is your goal to complete the black flag by walking the King\u2019s Road. I will help you.\u201d\u201cI would rather take your flag right now.\u201d\u201cThen try it. Is your sword faster or my tongue faster?\u201dIt was a gamble. Yoo Jonghyuk could stab my neck before the effect of the punishment appeared.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go towards Jung-gu. Go to the north. The territory of the Tyrant King will be yours and it will help you make your grand flag. Getting a flag and removing the enemy, isn\u2019t it killing two birds with one stone?\u201d\u201cI can do it myself.\u201d\u201cThere are 48 hours left until the end of the fourth scenario. Can you occupy 20 stations and complete the black flag in that time?\u201dYoo Jonghyuk\u2019s hands hesitated.\u00a0He was caught.\u201cBesides\u2026don\u2019t you have a reason for going north? Surely you aren\u2019t going to throw away your family member at this time?\u201d\u201c\u2026You.\u201d\u201cRemain calm. I am speaking in good faith. I really will help.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk\u2019s angry eyes stared at me for a moment.\u00a0The atmosphere was strained. The killing intent soon disappeared.\u201cThere is no such thing as anything free in the world. What are your conditions?\u201dAs expected, the regressor was quick to notice.\u00a0I said with a smile,\u00a0\u201cIt is simple. Let me know just one thing. My condition is that simple.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThat guy you just stepped on, what is his attribute? One would be the \u2018last to get off.\u2019 What is the other one?\u201dAfter a while, Yoo Jonghyuk opened his mouth.***10 minutes afterwards, I called Jung Minseob and Lee Sungkook.\u00a0It was a separate matter for the two of them.\u00a0Before I could open my mouth, Jung Minseob asked me first.\u201cIn the end, what was that guy?\u201dI hesitated for a moment before asking.\u201cDo you know the novel \u2018SSSSS grade Infinite Regressor\u2019?\u201d\u201cAh, I read it!\u201dLee Sungkook raised his hand.\u201cWasn\u2019t it the number one platinum novel on Textpia? It was really fun\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s right. I had forgotten but now it rings a bell. How did it finish?\u201dThe two of them started speaking loudly as memories popped up.\u00a0As expected, these guys must be interested in web novels if they read Ways of Survival.\u201cThere were all types of elements but\u2026 it was still fun.\u201dIn fact, I read that novel. I was reading Ways of Survival and accidently clicked on it since it was on the \u2018Today\u2019s Best\u2019 list. Then I was surprised to see the development and setting of the novel.\u2013An infinite regressor psychopath.\u2013Sponsorship from transcendent beings.\u2013Streaming system.\u2013A survival game with absurd missions.In fact, these were common settings. The problem was the details of the common settings and the way they were combined. I had left a comment as soon as I read it.\u2013Isn\u2019t this plagiarizing Ways of Survival?I remembered.\u00a0Rather than a plagiarism controversy, I was criticized for comparing it to a bad novel.I received terrible messages from the readers of SSSSS grade Infinite Regressor.\u2013Isn\u2019t your business over there?\u00a0Stop causing inconveniences\u00a0\u3149 \u3149I was furious and even sent a note to the writer of Ways of Survival.\u00a0Then the author said something.\u00a0He was in a better mood because the number of views had increased.\u00a0I teared up because I thought the author was pitiful.Lee Sungkook asked,\u00a0\u201cBut why are you talking about this novel?\u201d\u201cThe 1st Apostle is the author of SSSSS grade Infinite Regressor.\u201d\u201cHuh? It can\u2019t be.\u201dThat author would know Ways of Survival.Now that the world had turned into the novel, a writer who plagiarized the novel could claim copyrights on this world.\u00a0In addition, he added the absurd setting of the \u2018revelation.\u2019After some explanations, Jung Minseob understood and made an absurd expression.\u201cIt was a plagiarized novel?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, the novel was similar\u2026 I can\u2019t remember well because it is old\u2026 why didn\u2019t that novel pop up first in my mind? I was much more famous.\u201d\u201cIs it due to the attribute? Only the portion we read popped up. The \u2018SS\u2019 part is also confusing because there are too many novels with them.\u201d\u201cIs that so? In any case, the 1st Apostle is a plagiarist? Then he will have a text version\u2026\u201dI nodded and said.\u201cMaybe he has a copy of his own plagiarized work. He copied the plot of the original so he can see the future of this world to a certain extent.\u201dIt was painful when thinking that a plagiarist was successful even in this changed world. It was time to implement justice.\u201cThen isn\u2019t it impossible to win against him? If he copied the original to the end\u2026\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t to the end. He only copied the early parts. He would stop early to prevent a plagiarism controversy later on. After a bit more time, the information he knows will decrease.\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d\u201cI just know.\u201dIt was natural.\u00a0In the chapters in the 100s, I was the only reader of Ways of Survival.\u201cExcuse me, how far did Representative-nim read in the original work\u2026?\u201d\u201cBefore that, there is something you have to do. To be exact, it is something we have to do together.\u201dTheir shoulders stiffened.\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me before? The prophets were hit by the Tyrant King.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 maybe there are still a few people being used by him.\u201cReally? Then it is better.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dThe time remaining until the scenario ended was 48 hours.\u00a0It was hard to do it alone if I wanted to hunt the Tyrant King.\u201cI will disturb the information of these guys.\u201dIf the Tyrant King was using the prophets, I could take advantage of it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cReveal part of the revelations.\u201d\u201cHuh? How\u2026?\u201dThey still didn\u2019t understand what I was talking about so I kindly explained.\u201cFrom now on, we will make a text of SSSSS grade Infinite Regressor and spread it.\u201dIf there were several enemies, the answer was to make them fight against each other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Omniscient Reader\u2019s ViewpointChapter 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 13 \u2013 War of Kings (1)My plan was clear.The 1st Apostle, the plagiarist, had information about the \u2018third and fourth regressions\u2019 that were the beginning of Ways of Survival. As was always the case with informed people, he monopolized information and hid it from the prophets.On the other hand, the Tyrant King was one of Seoul\u2019s Seven Kings who used the \u2018revelations\u2019 after knowing about the existence of the prophets.The guy who wanted to monopolize information and the guy who tried to dig it out.\u00a0It was obvious what would happen if the two of them faced each other.Lee Sungkook asked,\u00a0\u201c\u2026Then you are going to make a novel text?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe plan itself was simple.\u00a0We would make a text of the plagiarized writer\u2019s novel.\u00a0Then spread it among the people of each station.Well, it was roughly this type of feeling.\u2013Some of the prophets\u2019 revelations have been leaked!The finish was laid out well.Thanks to Han Donghoon\u2019s Internet comments manipulation, information on the prophets had already spread on the Internet. If the leaking of a txt version was known, there would be a big ripple.A few early readers would try to get a hidden piece while the Tyrant King would naturally move to obtain them.\u201cBut\u2026I have forgotten most of the contents of SSSSS grade Infinite Regressor. How will we make the text?\u201d\u201cWhy do we need the contents of the plagiarized novel?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWe remember the original.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026!\u201dThere was a short cry of admiration. However, Jung Minseob\u2019s face was still dark.\u201cEh\u2026 there is still a problem. The hidden pieces that we know about in Ways of Survival have been mostly used\u2026\u201d\u201cI will give you information in hidden pieces. I know a few that are present in the beginning. I will release information on items of the right level.\u201dAbove all, it had to catch the eye of the plagiarist writer and the Tyrant King.Lee Sungkook laughed awkwardly.\u00a0\u201cThis is funny. I will make a text version. I am usually just a reader.\u201dThis jerk\u2026 was he an illegal downloader?Jung Minseob also spoke.\u201cBut if we do this, won\u2019t we be the same as him? In the end, we are plagiarizing the original story to make a story\u2026\u201dIt made sense.\u00a0I thought for a moment before saying.\u201cThere is such a thing. Plagiarism is about not wanting you to know the original, a parody is more fun if you know the original while a homage wants you to know the original.\u201d\u201cOh, this is interesting.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, we will be making a homage.\u201dIt was true. I hoped that many people would come to know SSSSS grade Infinite Regressor.\u00a0That way he would be quickly ruined.We borrowed a laptop from Gong Pildu and started typing. We didn\u2019t have a lot of experience in writing novels so we had to put our heads together. Jung Minseob pulled his hair and said,\u201cWriting is so difficult\u2026 writers are great\u2026\u201d\u201cJust write roughly. We just need information that will attract them. Rather, an imperfect revelation might be easier to deceive the prophets. Mix the truth and lies.\u201dI watched what Jung Minseob typed and added some information.\u201cLet\u2019s change the names of the people in the novel. I am a bit anxious.\u201dLee Hyunsung and Lee Jihye would be shocked about being characters in the story. Whether I liked it or not, someday they would find out that this world was a \u2018novel\u2019. But it didn\u2019t have to be right now.Then Jung Minseob unexpectedly said,\u00a0\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think you need to worry about that part.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIn fact, I tried to test some people by saying that this was a novel. But they didn\u2019t understand it at all. It is like a NPC\u2026 No matter how serious I am, they just take it as a joke.\u201dIt was an unexpected piece of information.Jung Minseob and the other apostles had spoken to characters several times about them being \u2018supporting actors.\u2019 Thinking about the reactions of the characters at the time\u2026there was definitely something strange.Jung Minseob continued to speak.\u201cThis was how the 1st Apostle was able to easily find the prophets. The \u2018characters\u2019 were very displeased by the words \u2018this is a novel\u2019 or they didn\u2019t listen. Perhaps this was why the apostles used the term \u2018revelation.\u2019\u201dI suddenly felt uneasy when I heard this.\u00a0I opened my mouth.\u00a0\u201c\u2026What is the difference between the characters and us?\u201d\u201cHuh? Um\u2026 we are people in reality and characters are people in novels? Isn\u2019t that the difference?\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 when was this world divided into reality and a novel?\u201d\u201cHrmmm, well\u2026 When the first scenario started?\u201dMy question wasn\u2019t resolved with Jung Minseob\u2019s answer.Jung Minseob and Lee Sungkook were obviously outsiders of the novel like me.\u00a0It was because I couldn\u2019t see their information at first.But not long after, it was updated and I was able to look at their information in Character List.Then were they now \u2018real people\u2019 or were they \u2018characters?\u2019\u00a0If everyone became a character over time\u2026I looked at Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung for a moment.[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.][This person isn\u2019t registered in \u2018Character List.\u2019][Currently collecting information about the corresponding figure.]Fortunately, I still couldn\u2019t see the information for both of them.Yoo Sangah suddenly looked back at me and smiled.\u00a0Lee Gilyoung also looked at me.\u201cWhat is it Hyung?\u201d\u201cIt is nothing.\u201dI didn\u2019t know why but I felt strangely relieved.***Soon after, we approximately completed the novel.The quality was so bad that if it was serialized in Textpia, it would\u2019ve bombed. But that didn\u2019t matter right ow.\u201cLet\u2019s first sprinkle the information that the Book of Revelations has been leaked.\u201dLee Sungkook asked.\u201cIs there enough time to spread the information?\u201d\u201cDonghun will take care of it. If we take advantage of the Hermit Invalid, it can be spread in a short amount of time.\u201d\u201cOh, Donghu\u2026 I see. But what if not all stations are capable of the Internet?\u201d\u201cThen we will send someone.\u201dI looked behind me.\u00a0Kang Ilhun nodded as if he had been waiting.Lee Sungkook agreed.\u00a0\u201cAh, that\u2019s right. If it is Ilhun-ssi\u2026 I had forgotten.\u201d\u201cKang Ilhun-ssi, are you ready?\u201dKang Ilhun, the deputy of Dongdaemun.\u00a0It was worth intentionally saving this guy.Kang Ilhun nervously opened his mouth.\u00a0\u201cLeave it to me. I am confident that I can catch them. I just need to spread rumours?\u201d[The character \u2018Kang Ilhun\u2019 will follow your will.][Your understanding of this person has increased.]Kang Ilhun.\u00a0It was finally time to use the attribute of Rumours Expert.\u00a0The time remaining until the scenario ended was 44 hours.The next day, the game would begin.***\u2013Donghun, thank you.\u2013I am just paying you back so don\u2019t worry.[The character \u2018Han Donghoon\u2019 trusts you a little bit.]Since last time, \u2018Hermit King of Shadows\u2019 Han Donghoon had moderately opened up his heart to me. The fact that I saved him from the prophets seemed to have played a bigger role than expected.\u2013I feel a strange sense of familiarity with you.\u2013Familiarity?\u2013Since a long time ago\u2026 are you also a hermit?\u2013Um, no I wasn\u2019t.\u00a0Although I was a bit timid.\u2013I see.\u00a0I feel an unknown wall with Hyung.\u00a0I can\u2019t explain it well but I like the feeling.\u2013Isn\u2019t it usually bad to feel a wall?\u2013I only believe in people with walls.\u00a0In order to understand someone, I think I should face that wall first.A person who was barely 17 years old was speaking like a wise man.In any case, the wall. I was sure that he was right.\u00a0Some walls couldn\u2019t be crossed no matter how desperate the person.\u2013In any case, the rumour has spread.\u00a0But how will you sow the revelations?\u00a0On the Internet again?\u2013No, the wrong people will read it if I place it on the Internet.\u00a0I will sell it.\u2013Sell it?\u00a0How?I started to explain to Han Donghoon.***There were 40 hours remaining until the end of the scenario.I finally summoned the Chungmuro group members.\u201cThis journey won\u2019t be easy. If we can\u2019t take Changsin Station in the next 40 hours, our group will be wiped out. However, our current forces isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\u201cWell, since when has it been easy? Who is the opponent?\u201dI replied to Jung Heewon\u2019s question.\u00a0\u201cHe is called the Tyrant King. He is one of the top seven kings of Seoul and the king with the largest territory.\u201dLee Hyunsung asked this time.\u00a0\u201cWhat type of person is he?\u201d\u201cHe is someone who started from Dobong-gu and built his own kingdom. He says that any beautiful or handsome man and woman will become concubines, while any ugly people will be killed or become slaves.\u201dJung Heewon frowned.\u00a0\u201cIf Dokja-ssi is caught, you will become a slave.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, I think it will be dangerous for Heewon-ssi.\u201d\u201cBeing a concubine is difficult\u2026 Why don\u2019t we just go ahead and kill him?\u201d\u201cIt will be hard because his sponsor is quite strong. Now there are two paths. Take his flag or take over his headquarters, Dobong Station.\u201dNeither was easy, causing everyone to feel tense. I decided to get to the point.\u201cWe will go to Gwanghwamun.\u201d\u201cHuh? Didn\u2019t you say not to fight them?\u201d\u201cThey will come to us.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI leaked a bit of information. We have to consider the time he moves so we will leave soon. Everyone should be prepared\u2026 eh?\u201d\u201c\u2026What is it?\u201dI subtly smiled at Yoo Sangah\u2019s question.\u201cNothing. It is just happening faster than I expected.\u201dHan Donghoon\u2019s message appeared on my smartphone.\u2013I was able to put it on the exchange. But is it okay?\u2013Yes, its fine.\u00a0Well done.Then system messages entered my ears one after another.[The items on the exchange have been sold.][The items on the exchange have been sold.]At that moment, a trembling voice was heard from the air.[\u2026Are you a scammer?]\u2018What is the reaction among the constellations?\u2019[They are really excited. The filtering limit has started to unravel\u2026 there are those who gave it as gifts to their incarnations. But if you do this, you will receive attention again. Will you be okay? And if you release all the information you know, won\u2019t it go against you?]\u2018It isn\u2019t disadvantageous.\u2019I still had information remaining.\u00a0The information I released wasn\u2019t information I needed.\u00a0Rather, it was information that would be damaging to someone.\u2018Give me the coins.\u2019[Here.][16 volumes of SSSSS grade Infinite Regressors have been sold on the exchange.][You have earned 16,000 coins.]Of course, I didn\u2019t release the information for free.Anyone who needed to information would have a sponsor, so it was better to sell it on the \u2018exchange\u2019 than to release it for free on the Internet.If I released the Book of Revelations for free, it would be more suspicious.\u00a0But what if I sold it?Of course they would buy it.\u00a0It was because they would mistakenly think the information had \u2018value.\u2019\u00a0The quality of the information was sometimes determined by value rather than content.By the way, it was 16,000 coins. This was a profit.I spoke to the people.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I will sleep for a while.\u201d\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you taking it too easy?\u201d\u201cI also need to sleep.\u201dI lay down. Yoo Sangah covered me with a thin blanket. Jung Heewon still found it absurd.Then I fell asleep.\u00a0After a while, a system message was heard in my blurred consciousness.[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint stage 3 has been activated!]So far, I figured out that Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint was divided into three stages.Stage 1 allowed me to read the simple actions or emotions of characters.Stage 2 allowed me to see deep inside the character.Stage 3 allowed me to see the surrounding scenery where the characters were located or directly immerse myself in the character.So far, I had entered stage 3 twice.\u00a0Once was in my dream and the second time was when I died.\u00a0In my dream, I saw Yoo Jonghyuk leaving Gumho Station.\u00a0When I was dead, I witnessed the scenery of Chungmuro.These two incidents had similarities.\u00a0My consciousness was muddled and unstable.\u00a0But this wasn\u2019t the only condition to trigger stage 3.There was one important fact.\u00a0It was\u2026\u300c \u2018Representative-nim, are you watching? Damn\u2026 is this right?\u2019Kang Ilhun muttered to himself as he gazed into the air.\u2018I have spread it to the King of Tyrants. Those guys will move soon. By the way, you are listening to me right?\u2019 \u300dThe character and I needed to be thinking about each other at the same time.After a while, my point of view shifted to Kang Ilhun.\u300cThe man smiled, revealing his white teeth. A man wearing a magnificent crown and a coat of gold slowly rose from the throne, women surrounding him.\u201cA new revelation?\u201d\u201cIt is certain. I bought the information using coins.\u201d\u201cWho released the information?\u201d\u201cIt is probably one of the prophets.\u201d\u201cIs it reliable?\u201d\u201cI checked some of the hidden pieces in the revelations and they were all true.\u201dThe man laughed, revealing his teeth.\u201cLet\u2019s go to Gwanghwamun. Before the others get there first.\u201d \u300dGood. The Tyrant King was finally moving.\u00a0Now the problem was on the other side.I thought about Jung Minseob.\u300c \u2018Representative-nim!\u00a0I have arrived.\u2019 \u300dThe timing was good.Jung Minseob was at Sejong University and heading to Gwanghwamun in advance.\u00a0He then looked at the surrounding scenery.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u300c I am certain since he is wearing the same hood like a chunni. It is him.\u2019 \u300dPeople were in the lower part of the building. As I thought, the plagiarist was the fastest. Gwanghwamun contained one of the hidden pieces most useful for the third regression. The plagiarist wouldn\u2019t be able to run away from this place.\u300c The problem is that more people are coming. Yeongdeungpo, Yongsan, Seongdong-gu, the kings on those sides are moving\u2026 isn\u2019t this becoming too big?\u2019 \u300dNo, it was what I was hoping for.\u00a0The people who were hiding started to emerge one by one.\u00a0It was better since I didn\u2019t need to visit each one individually.Finally, the fourth scenario was ending.\u00a0The real War of Kings would begin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seemed to be a reward that could be obtained by entering the 1st person protagonist\u2019s point of view. Unfortunate, I didn\u2019t know the entry requirements.It would be great if I could get Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s skills every time I fell asleep and used 1st person protagonist\u2019s point of view.I opened my eyes and saw Jung Heewon watching me.\u201cYou were talking in your sleep again.\u201dTalking? No way.\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d\u201cIt sounded like\u2026 Mother.\u201d\u201c\u2026Mother?\u201dWhy was I saying that to myself?\u00a0It was hard to know if this was the truth or not.Jung Heewon just looked at me with a mysterious smile.I gave a cursory reply.\u201cWell, I\u2019m not really worried about my mother. Rather, I have a request for Jung Heewon-ssi.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cHeewon-ssi, please don\u2019t participate in the Gwanghwamun battle this time.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why?\u201d\u201cThere is something else you need to do. I can only entrust Heewon-ssi with it.\u201dJung Heewon licked her lips like she couldn\u2019t believe me.\u201cI will try. What is it?\u201d***The first thing I did after conversing with Jung Heewon was to decide who would stay in Chungmuro and who would go to Gwanghwamun.\u201cJung Heewon-ssi has a mission and I will decide the rest of the people remaining in Chungmuro.\u201dThe other members gulped.\u00a0They looked like vassals about to be chosen by the king.\u201cFirst of all, Gong Pildu and Lee Hyunsung will stay behind.\u201d\u201cBah, I am just your slave.\u201dGong Pildu scoffed like he already expected it. The problem was Lee Hyunsung. The slightly pale face was troubled, as if he had somehow missed out on a promotion.\u201cHyunsung-ssi must remain. I need someone to protect this place with Gong Pildu-ssi. Hyunsung-ssi can protect Chungmuro and lead the people as well as Yoo Sangah-ssi.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. I understand.\u201dHis expression was somewhat sad but he had no choice. There was a reason for leaving the Steel Sword behind.\u201cHyunsung-sso already has great skills. The problem is that the skill levels are too low. While we are gone, Hyunsung-ssi should increase the proficiency of Great Mountain Smash. Hyunsun-ssi\u2019s help will be needed after the end of this scenario.\u201dLee Hyunsung\u2019s face brightened slightly.\u201cYep! Please leave it to me.\u201dSoldiers were the most efficient when following commands and when they had a routine.Thus, we embarked on the journey to Gwanghwamun.\u00a0Apart from Lee Jihye and Yoo Jonghyuk who were impossible to control, the core members were Yoo Sangah, Lee Gilyoung and Lee Sungkook.The Chungmuro group members waved as they watched us leave.\u201cDeputy-nim! Come back safely!\u201d\u201cYou must be safe!\u201dFor a few days now, Yoo Sangah\u2019s popularity had pierced the sky.\u00a0Yoo Sangah only led the people for a short amount of time but everyone was concerned about her. However, Yoo Sangah looked uneasy.\u201cDokja-ssi, will I be a help to you?\u201dHer self-deprecation had returned.\u00a0I had to say it this time, even if she would be hurt.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi. You will be disruptive if you keep acting like this.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi is good enough. Would I take someone with me for no reason?\u201d\u201cI believe in Dokja-ssi. But I can\u2019t be as helpful to you as Heewon-ssi or Hyunsung-ssi\u2026\u201d\u201cThe two of them can\u2019t do what Yoo Sangah-ssi can do. Yoo Sangah-ssi is necessary for this plan.\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s expression slightly relaxed as it was emphasized once again. Yoo Sangah was an exceptionally talented person. She just needed confidence.\u201cDidn\u2019t you study Korean history before?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s expression became brighter once mentions of the past emerged. But it was only for a moment as she quickly became grouchy again.\u201c\u2026It is useless now.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t useless. This is why I brought Yoo Sangah-ssi along.\u201dOriginally, I hadn\u2019t intended to give this role to Yoo Sangah.\u00a0There was a suitable person if I went down to Gwangjin-gu.\u00a0However, I didn\u2019t have time to look for him so Yoo Sangah would have to be enough.The Yoo Sangah that I knew was smart enough to memorize the entire history of South Korea just to get a first grade degree in Korean history.\u201cDo you remember the statue of Samyeongdang last time?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThere will be many similar things on the way to Gwanghwamun. There is the National Museum and several statues.Yoo Sangah shouted once she realized what I was saying.\u201cAh! I see. That reminds me, the power of the constellations can remain in relics or remnants of themselves.\u201d\u201cYes, Yoo Sangah-ssi\u2019s mission is to find such keepsakes or relics.\u201d\u201cI understand! I will use my head.\u201d\u201cThere are some famous people but the more unknown they are, the better.\u201dDespite being on the same level, a constellation\u2019s strength varied according to their popularity.It could be seen in the difference between Samyeongdang and Duke of Loyalty and Warfare.The items left behind by Samyeongdang were B grade, while the sword left by the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare had the quality to be S-grade.\u201cWe need to gather as much items on the way to Gwanghwamun as possible. Our side has a relatively small number of people.\u201dPerhaps the Tyrant King had come with hundreds of incarnations.\u00a0The plagiarist would have his own forces.\u00a0I also needed to be careful of the kings who came from Yeongdeungpo, Yongsan and Seongdong-gu.The latter part of the fourth scenario was just like a proxy war for the constellations.\u00a0At the end of this scenario, an event greatly coveted by the constellations was hiding.Unlike before, the incarnations would have a high coordination with their constellations and the risks would increase accordingly. Since many constellations were determined by the history of their lives, Yoo Sangah who knew history would be useful in many ways in this scenario.Yoo Sangah suddenly clapped.\u201cAh, that reminds me of a place.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m remembering correctly but\u2026 there will probably be Gwangsengmyo Shrine near here.\u201d (Link:)\u201cGwangsengmyo?\u201d\u201cYes, it is on the way and the power of a great person might be there.

An idol couldn\u2019t be seen.\u201cLet\u2019s pray.\u201dThis was different from Samyeongdang. I wouldn\u2019t always be able to get a good reward for destroying the idol.We collected water from the shrine and prayed quietly. Some time passed.

Even if there was an idol, it didn\u2019t mean a good item would appear in South Korea.\u00a0It was more likely that an incarnation of China had obtained it\u2026He couldn\u2019t be compared to the Great Sage the Equal of Heaven or Uriel, but he wouldn\u2019t lose when it came to the Chinese constellations.Lee Gilyoung grabbed my collar.\u201cHyung.\u201dThe cockroach\u2019s antennae was moving wildly.\u00a0I had a bad hunch and saw a group walking in the distance.\u00a0There were approximately 50 people.I used Calm Observation and saw that their average physical body stats were around level 40.

Please don\u2019t worry too much. This scenario will proceed slowly.]Gwanghwamun was still despite everyone being in a state of agitation.\u00a0It was natural. The surviving kings knew how important it was to listen to the dokkaebi.[As you have guessed, the fourth main scenario is to be the only king to sit on the throne. Of course, being a king doesn\u2019t mean that everyone can sit on that throne. Only a person who has proved his/her qualifications can sit there.]The intermediate dokkaebi said with a bad laugh.[Then I will reveal the first qualification.]+[King\u2019s Qualification]1.\u00a0 \u300c The owner of the throne should be braver than anyone else. \u300d-The Absolute Throne never wants a \u2018weak king.\u2019 To challenge the throne, you must own at least a black flag.(Additional qualifications will be released after a while.)+A black flag.\u00a0It was disgusting from the very beginning.[Huhu, the motive wa given. Now make a fun story!]The intermediate dokkaebi disappeared and Yoo Sangah made an anxious expression.\u201cIf it is a black flag\u2026 you need to occupy 20 stations?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dOur group had a brown flag.\u00a0It was a flag that could be obtained after occupying 10 stations.\u201cWhat do we do? In order to create a black flag, we need 10 more stations. If there are vacant stations nearby\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is a condition that appeared because there are no empty stations.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dAs far as I knew, no king had achieved the black flag at this point.\u201cDid you forget? There isn\u2019t only one method to change the colour of a flag.The achievement value of the flag went up when taking over a station. However, there was a way to get achievement values much faster.\u201cAh\u2026!\u201dIt was to take the flag of another representative.\u00a0Right now, there were a bunch of kings with flags in Gwanghwamun.I calmed down the party members.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This wasn\u2019t unexpected. We will proceed as planned.\u201dAs planned. I said this but it wouldn\u2019t be easy.There were clouds of war hanging over Gwanghwamun. It was a breathless tension just before the storm blew. The sound of weapons being pulled out and the organization of \u00a0battle lines could be heard.People would soon start moving.Those competing for a promotion would now kill each other with real swords. Those who wanted a wider territory would take each other\u2019s flags to occupy more stations.Kill each other and get better items.\u00a0It was in order to survive.Lee Sungkook watched the buildings around them and muttered in a surreal tone.\u00a0\u201cIt is scary. Is this really South Korea?\u201d\u201cIt is South Korea. It is still South Korea.\u201d\u201cRepresentative-nim, aren\u2019t you scared?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a lie.\u00a0I was obviously scared.\u00a0To be honest, I often felt that way.\u00a0Even if I read Ways of Survival, I was still a regular office worker.\u00a0I didn\u2019t express it but I often wondered if I could survive.Of course, my worries didn\u2019t last long.\u00a0It was because it was useless to think about it.\u00a0It was the same in any world.Kim Dokja who worked at Mino Soft was now Kim Dokja who lived in the world of Ways of Survival.\u00a0Death would come whether I wanted it to or not.\u00a0The most important thing was\u2026\u201cAt least I feel like I am living right now.\u201d[The exclusive skill, \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 is activated!]I suddenly turned around and saw Lee Sungkook looking at me with reverent eyes.\u201cWhen I look at Representative-nim\u2026\u201d\u201cAttack!\u201dSomeone\u2019s shout was heard before Lee Sungkook\u2019s words were over.\u00a0300 metres away, there was a king who started marching north.He was a king with a brown flag like me. I couldn\u2019t see his face because he was too far away but he was probably the king of a small district.At almost the same time, the warlords hiding in Gwanghwamun started to appear. They were each armed with excellent self-defense equipment.The most prominent one was a man wearing a kilt in splendid colours.\u00a0I could tell who he was without looking.Our target, the Tyrant King and the rule of Dobong-gu and Seongbuk-gu.The vibe he gave off was new. The Tyrant King who had the largest forces among Seoul\u2019s Seven Kings. Now that he moved, the 1st apostle and the kings of the three kingdoms would act.\u201cMaybe most of them will go after the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword.\u201dIn fact, the direction of the kings\u2019 march was the northern Palace Museum where the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword was located. I didn\u2019t see him but the plagiarist would also be moving to that side.Some forces ignored any damage and were running towards the museum.\u00a0It was understandable.Since the qualifications of the absolute king wasn\u2019t clear yet, they thought it would be more advantageous to obtain a good item.If the item was the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword, they could fill in the lacking achievement points of their flag at once.Lee Sungkook asked anxiously,\u00a0\u201cShouldn\u2019t we go? The Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword is a pretty good item.\u201d\u201cWe will just be defeated if we go.\u201dWe didn\u2019t have a lot of people.\u00a0Moreover, there were many high level sponsors among them.\u201cGo to the west.\u201dI moved while leading the party. All the kings were heading for the northern Palace Museum so the west was relatively lacking.It was the historic Gwanghwamun so there were museums all over the place. Presseum, Korean Financial History Museum, Korean National Police Heritage Museum\u2026Yoo Sangah asked,\u00a0\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to these places?\u201d\u201cWe should avoid the modern and contemporary exhibits.\u201dAn old relic was better.Of course, the relic simply being \u2018old\u2019 wasn\u2019t enough. The hoe used by farmers in the Iron Age was also such an item but it was only F grade. The important thing was that it have a relationship with a famous person or a narrative.\u201cLet\u2019s go here.\u201dThe place we stopped at was the Seoul History Museum facing Gyeonghui Palace.A light flashed in Yoo Sangah\u2019s eyes.\u201cWhat are we looking for here?\u201d\u201cWe must find the Ganpyeongui. It is a relic of the Joseon Dynasty that resembles a disc, but I don\u2019t know what floor it is on.\u201d (Ganpyeongui is an astronomical observation device. Image will be provided below)\u201cOkay, I will try and find it!\u201d\u201cWe have to find it quickly so let\u2019s scatter. Gilyoung, you move with Sangah noona. And Lee Sungkook-ssi\u2015\u201dAs I was speaking, something sharp flew from behind me.\u00a0I reflexively crouched down, pulling the party members with me.The exterior wall of the building was pierced by an arrow. There was a trace of magic power on the shaft.I got goosebumps.[Strong Magic Arrow].This person had learnt the archery skill properly.\u00a0Who was it?\u00a0The unexpected ambush complicated my thoughts.\u00a0Was there someone who read the movements of my party?\u201cEverybody go inside! Quickly!\u201dSeveral more arrows flew.[Blade of Faith is activated!]I swung my sword and struck the flying arrows. Fortunately, the amount of magic power wasn\u2019t high so they weren\u2019t difficult to block.The problem was the number.\u00a0One arrow flew out and pierced my thigh.\u00a0I quickly retreated and hid behind cover.\u201cHahaha! Where is the novice king wandering to?\u201dA voice echoed through the area.\u00a0A group of men armed with bows and swords appeared 500 metres away.Their flag couldn\u2019t be seen.\u00a0In other words, they sent out a detached force.\u00a0Some kings were smarter than I thought.\u00a0Was he going to eat up items while taking away the flags of the smaller kings?[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]I used a skill on a person in the lead.+[Character Information]Name: Chu WanginAge: 33 years old.Constellation Support: The Last Hero of HwangsanbeolPrivate Attribute: Minor Actor (General)Exclusive Skills: Weapons Training Lv. 4, Acting Lv. 1, Weak Investigation Lv. 1.Stigma: Baekje Kendo Lv. 4, Prepared to Fight to the Death for the Country Lv. 2, Detached Force Management Lv. 3.Overall Stats: Physique Lv. 19, Strength Lv. 19, Agility Lv. 21, Magic Power Lv. 15.Overall Evaluation: It is a case where even a nobody can grow if he meets an excellent sponsor. Due to the high degree of sympathy with the sponsor, the strength of his stigmas is significant.+Damn, a tiger had come.\u00a0I didn\u2019t expect to meet Hwangsanbeol\u2019s master here.\u00a0Those with actor attributes tended to cling to these types of constellations.\u201cIf you know honour as a king, surrender your flag. Then your group members won\u2019t lose their lives.\u201dThe poor dramatic tone told me why he was only a minor actor.\u00a0The Last Hero of Hwangsanbeol was attached to such a person.\u00a0It seemed that bad luck with partners applied even to constellations.But this was difficult.\u00a0The level of the stigmas Baekje Kendo and Detached Force Management was too high.Considering the number of people, it would be hard to handle all of them without raising my overall stats.[Coins Possessed: 68,150C]\u2026Should I use my coins here?\u00a0However, the difficulty of the last phase of the fourth scenario would increase sharply if I used coins to raise my overall stats here.It would disturb my whole plan.If I closed my eyes and used around 20,000 coins\u2026\u201cIsn\u2019t it embarrassing for you to persecute the king of a weak nation using the name of the Three Kingdoms?\u201dI looked around as I heard a voice and saw a familiar person approaching. The incarnation of Gyebaek, Chu Wangin made a fierce expression.\u201cWhat is the queen doing here?\u201d\u201cYour crude tone is just as expected for the master of a ruined kingdom.\u201dThe woman shot back with a smug expression.\u00a0King of Beauty Min Jiwon.\u00a0Why did this woman appear here?\u2026Surely she hadn\u2019t followed me?No. There was no way.Min Jiwon\u2019s eyes glanced at me.[The character \u2018Min Jiwon\u2019 shows a weak liking towards you.]\u2026Really?\u201cShut up! The cowardly Silla blood now claims to be rule of the Three Kingdoms? I won\u2019t recognize a girl like you as a king!\u201dChu Wangin\u2019s roar of anger burst from his body. He might be a minor actor without much skills but his voice was very loud.By the way, it was interesting. Gyebaek and Queen Jinseong were born in different eras but they could face each other like this after becoming constellations.I asked Min Jiwon,\u00a0\u201cWhy are you helping me?\u201d\u201cSilla doesn\u2019t ignore weak countries.\u201d\u201cIt is Silla who destroyed Gaya.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did you also have a 1st-grade degree in Korean history?\u201d\u201cAny high school graduate would know this much.\u201dMin Jiwon\u2019s expression became slightly gloomy.\u201cI don\u2019t know because I didn\u2019t go to high school.\u201dIt was natural.\u00a0Min Jiwon had been an actor since her teens.\u00a0She became an actress at an early age and learned things other than history.\u201cYour words are correct. I can\u2019t obtain people with money. I\u2019m repaying the debt caused by my rudeness. That\u2019s it.\u201dI knew Min Jiwon\u2019s history as an actress and could feel the sincerity in her words. It was still surprising. She was an incarnation with a high pride so I didn\u2019t think she would bow before me like this.Gyebaek\u2019s incarnation laughed at our conversation.\u201cA king is swayed by personal matters? That\u2019s why a chick like you\u2026\u201dMin Jiwon\u2019s captain came forward on behalf of the Hwarang.\u201cRude! How can a man like you be the king of a country?\u201dGyebaek\u2019s eyes were drawn to the Hwarang.\u201cHwarang\u2026? Very interesting. Did you sign with that constellation?\u201dThe Hwarang captain turned red at the words.\u00a0It reminded me that the Hwarang captain\u2019s sponsor was Gwanchang.\u201cDo you want your neck to be cut like your sponsor?\u201dIn the battle of Hwangsanbeol, Gwanchang died from Gyebaek cutting his throat.\u201cShut up!\u201dThank you for coming to help but the relationship between constellations was the worst.\u00a0This was particularly bad due to their high level of sympathy.There was a hierarchy among the constellations due to the history of their lives.A person couldn\u2019t go against their king and the enemy was determined according to historical records.For example Kurushima Michifusa of Japan could never beat the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare.It was just like how Gwanchang couldn\u2019t win against Gyebaek.Min Jiwon also knew this and didn\u2019t look happy.I spoke first.\u00a0\u201cJust defeat the army. Or we can\u2019t win.\u201dBaekje\u2019s army had slightly more military force.Gyebaek was a military commander. The more people he led, the stronger his power. Gwanchang was no match for him.Then Yoo Sangah\u2019s voice was heard.\u00a0\u201cDokja-ssi! I\u2019ve found it!\u201dI looked back and found Yoo Sangah running with a small disc.\u00a0She found it already?The Ganpyeongui.\u00a0The relic resembling a wall clock glowed in Yoo Sangah\u2019s hands.At this moment, I had an idea.\u00a0I looked at Ganpyeongui, then Min Jiwon and the incarnation of Gwanchang.\u00a0Then I made a decision.\u00a0Perhaps I could win this without using coins?\u201cAttack!\u201d[The character \u2018Chu Wangin\u2019 has used the stigma Detached Force Lv. 3!]The Hwarang kept falling under the hands of the Baekje forces.\u00a0Min Jiwon looked towards me with a desperate expression and I said,\u00a0\u201cI think we can win.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWe will recreate the battle of Hwangsanbeol.\u201dMany people knew this but Hwangsanbeol was a battle that Silla won.TL: I gave you a wiki link in the last chapter but I will give a short summary, since this information is important to understand what is going on.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBattle of Hwangsanbeol was a major battle that took place between Baekje and Silla. The commander of Baekje was Gyebaek and the commander of Shilla was Kim Yushin.The Silla army was 50,000 strong while Baekje could only rally up 5,000 people but Gyebaek rallied his forces with a heroic speech. The Baekje forces won several skirmishes and the Silla forces lost morale.Then a general sent out his son, Kim Gwanchang to single-handedly fight the enemy. Gwanchang was captured before being released by Gyebaek. After returning to the Silla camp, Gwanchang once again charged to the enemy. Gyebaek captured him again and executed him this time.Thanks to Gwanchang\u2019s martyrdom, the Silla forces regained morale and Kim Yushin was victorious. Gyebaek died in battle.Image of the\u00a0Ganpyeongui:Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This is according to history.\u201dChu Wangin\u2019s sword ran through a Hwarang member.Obviously, Shilla would win if it was like history. If it was like history.\u00a0But before I could speak, the captain of Hwarang came forward and shouted,\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t retreat! There is no stepping back in a battle!\u201dAt the same time, the Hwarang pulled out their weapons.\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cVictory!

In the first place, they were loyal to the beauty of Queen Jinseong, not her charisma.I heard a sound. Then Lee Gilyoung landed next to me from where he broke through the window of the museum\u2019s second floor.\u201cHyung, should I call Titano?\u201dLee Gilyoung\u2019s eyes shone as he prepared to use Diverse Communication.\u201cNo, it is okay.\u201dIt would be helpful if Lee Gilyoung could call the 6th grade insect king like last time but then he would be unconscious for two days. High grade monsters were difficult to control and could also sweep away allies.In any case, Lee Gilyoung was my hidden card.\u00a0I had to save him until the beginning of the war with the kings.\u201cKuaaak!\u201dThe Hwarang in front of us were knocked out.\u00a0On the other hand, there wasn\u2019t a single dead Baekje person.I reached out to Yoo Sangah who ran to me.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, the relic\u2026!\u201dYoo Sangah handed me the Ganpyeongui.The Ganpyeongui. Everyone was distracted by the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword but in fact, the Ganpyeongui was an essential item for the fourth scenario.The Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword had no meaning if this item didn\u2019t exist.\u201cKuheeok!\u201dThe captain of Hwarang was a wreck as he was hit by Chu Wangin again.\u00a0It wouldn\u2019t be strange if he died in one more blow.[The constellation Hwarang Knows No Retreat is in a hurry.][The constellation \u2018Last Hero of Hwangsanbeol\u2019 is happy.][The constellation \u2018Lady of the Brocade Sleep\u2019 is irritated.]The momentum of the Baekje army grew while Silla\u2019s morale broke down.\u00a0It felt like the spirit of Gyebaek was flowing from Chu Wangin\u2019s body.\u201cDestroy the damn Silla!\u201dThe more that the constellations were in a situation similar to the history that they lived, the greater the coordination with their incarnation and the stronger the power of the stigma.In addition, the encounter with \u2018related\u2019 constellations\u2026It was time for the \u2018stage\u2019 to be created.\u201cUhh?What?\u201dPeople screamed with surprise.\u00a0Sparks filled the surrounding space and the scene changed. Seoul\u2019s Gwanghwamun was transformed into a rugged mountain wilderness.\u300cStage Transformation. \u300dIt was a phenomenon that occurred when the coordination was high between incarnations with historical correlations.Space Transformation summoned the space-time that the constellations had fought in.\u00a0Of course, the space wasn\u2019t really changed. It was close to an augmented reality.The problem was that this wasn\u2019t the case for the people who summoned the stage.\u201cHahahaha\u2026 I missed you Hwangsanbeol!\u201dChu Wangin achieved a considerable level of coordination with his sponsor and shouted.\u00a0Now he seemed to completely believe he was Gyebaek.Gyebaek was in a hurry.\u00a0If a constellation did something like this in the early scenarios, it was likely they would receive a sanction from the Bureau. However, Gyebaek was less likely to be affected than the low level constellations.\u201cU-Uwaaah!\u201dThe frightened Hwarang started to step back.Lee Sungkook muttered,\u00a0\u201cHe isn\u2019t one of the Seven Kings but he has such power\u2026 does this make sense?\u201d\u201cIt is possible because Gyebaek is the protagonist of this stage.\u201dChu Wangin was like a mad monster as he ran around.\u00a0Once Stage Transformation occurred and coordination with the sponsor increased, the incarnation\u2019s strength would multiply.I looked at the trembling Min Jiwon and opened my mouth.\u201cI have two ways. One is to let the incarnation of Gwanchang die.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026what do you mean?\u201dOriginally, the Battle of Hwangsanbeol was a battlefield that Shilla won thanks to \u00a0Gwanchang\u2019s sacrifice.\u00a0One half of the battle was complete if he died.\u201cAs soon as Stage Transformation began, this has become the battlefield of history. If the incarnation of Gwanchang dies, the morale of the Silla troops will rise due to their anger. This is recorded in history.\u201dI didn\u2019t listen to Min Jiwon\u2019s answer.\u201cThe second way is to change history.\u201dI looked down at the Ganpyeongui in my hands.\u00a0Ganpyeongui, an astronomical observation device produced by Joseon in the 17th century.Min Jiwon felt uneasy and asked,\u00a0\u201cWhat will happen if it fails?\u201d\u201cYour country will perish.\u201d\u201cThen of course it will be the first option\u2026!\u201dThis was truly Queen Jinseong.\u00a0She was considered an incompetent ruler for a reason.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to give you a choice. I will do the second method.\u201d\u201cThen why did you mention it?\u201d\u201cI gave you a chance. You are not what Silla needs right now.\u201dI manipulated the two discs that made up the Ganpyeongui.The two discs were called the sky disc and the earth disc respectively. The top was the earth disc and the bottom was the sky disc.There was a simple definition for Ganpyeongui in Ways of Survival.\u300c The Ganpyeongui is an item that can find the constellations in heaven.\u300dAs I slowly turned the earth disc, the constellations engraved on the sky disc started to burn brightly.[Ganpyeongui\u2019s special option \u2018Echo of the Stars\u2019 has been activated.][\u2018Echo of the Stars\u2019 allows you to ask for the help of a constellation.][The constellation can refuse your request and the number of times Ganpyeongui can be used is reduced when the constellation responds to the request.]There were seven constellations left on the sky disc.\u00a0In other words, I can use it seven more times in the future.It would\u2019ve been good if there were more constellations left on the relic. Well, it couldn\u2019t be helped.Lee Sungkook seemed to have noticed something and asked,\u00a0\u201cAre you going to get help from a constellation with that?\u201d\u201cNot all the constellations are available but there are some great people.\u201dLee Sungkook was filled with admiration at my answer. He belatedly found out the true value of this item.\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d\u00a0Lee Sungkook cried out excitedly,\u00a0\u201cHow about calling Xiang Yu or Lu Bu? If you call them, you can easily deal with Gyebaek.\u201d\u201cI have to know the modifier of the constellation.\u201dIn the world of Ways of Survival, the modifier was like the constellations\u2019 space-time coordinates. The modifiers were like the the X and Y axis coordinate system in the Star Stream.\u201cAh\u2026 then\u2026\u201dLee Sungkook made a sad expression.\u00a0He thought that I didn\u2019t know the modifiers of Lu Bu and Xiang Yu.\u00a0But that was an illusion.\u00a0There was no one in the world who knew as many constellation modifiers as me.\u201cI\u2019ll call a constellation.\u201d[The great constellations hear your voice flowing through the stars.]Of course, the constellation I was calling wasn\u2019t Lu Bu or Xiang Yu.\u00a0There was no guarantee they would respond to this request and there was someone more fitting for this battlefield.I stared at the stars in the sky.\u00a0I faced the numerous stars and opened my mouth.\u201cI want to call Hwarang Leader King Heungmu the Great.\u201d[The star navigation has begun.]A part of the sky darkened and a shadow fell to the ground.\u00a0The battle between Silla and Baekje stopped.\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying?\u201dChu Wangin sensed something suspicious and started running towards me.\u201cRepresentative-nim, we will stop them.\u201dLee Sungkook pulled out a sword. I didn\u2019t know how long the hypnotist would be able to endure but I should have some time.After a while, one of the stars in the sky shone brightly.\u00a0He finally appeared.[The constellation \u2018King Heungmu the Great\u2019 is looking at you.]\u201cGeneral.\u201d[The constellation \u2018King Heungmu the Great\u2019 is listening to you.]\u201cThere are people here who need your help. I am calling you because your people are dying.\u201d[The constellation \u2018King Heungmu the Great\u2019 is silent at your words.]King Heungmu the Great. He wasn\u2019t royalty but he was the only person who was given a posthumous name of a king of Silla.He probably wouldn\u2019t reject my request.\u00a0It was because Hwangsanbeol was his battlefield.But something unexpected happened.[The constellation \u2018King Heungmu the Great\u2019 doesn\u2019t want to be involved in the history of modern life.][The constellation \u2018King Heungmu the Great\u2019 will reject your offer.]\u2026What?\u00a0The constellation was about to fade away when Yoo Sangah interrupted.\u201cGeneral, please listen to my words!\u201dThe smart Yoo Sangah noticed who King Heungmu the Great was.[The constellation \u2018King Heungmu the Great\u2019 is looking back.]\u201cI\u2019m well aware of General\u2019s story! The Battle of Hwangsanbeol, the Siege of Pyongyang\u2026! I\u2019ve read all about it in the records!\u201dYoo Sangah took a deep breath before starting to talk.\u201cI understand that you want to respect the past and history. But General! Some histories don\u2019t end after they are recorded.\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s voice was clear and straightforward.\u201cDon\u2019t you regret it? The battlefield where the young Hwarang are sacrificed and countless people are buried\u2026! Have you already forgotten?\u201d[The constellation \u2018King Heungmu the Great\u2019 is listening to incarnation Yoo Sangah\u2019s story.]\u201cHistory won\u2019t change. The soldiers on the field won\u2019t be comforted and the lives of the young Hwarang won\u2019t return. But General! The history here hasn\u2019t ended yet! If you come here, at least you can change the history in this place!\u201dI had forgotten how good a talker Yoo Sangah was.\u00a0\u00a0During her early days, she was the queen of PT at Mino Soft.\u201cGeneral! Your Battle of Hwangsanbeol is over\u2026 but we are still at Hwangsanbeol.\u201d[The constellation \u2018King Heungmu the Great\u2019 has silently closed his eyes.]There were such moments in life.\u00a0I knew what would happen from now on, even if no one said anything.[The constellation \u2018King Heungmu the Great\u2019 has responded to your request.]One of the constellations on Ganpyeongui disappeared and a light from the star in the sky shone on me.I smiled at the nervous Yoo Sangah.\u00a0\u201cWell done Yoo Sangah-ssi.\u201d[You have temporarily received the protection of constellation \u2018King Heungmu the Great.\u2019]The muscles in my body twitched like they were surprised. My heart pumped and light and darkness crossed several times in my head. Something was being constructed inside me.[This is just on old man\u2019s reminiscence of the past.]This was the mantra of the constellation.\u00a0Just listening made my existence at stake.[Please, lend me your voice for a while.]I nodded while opening my eyes.\u00a0Everyone on the field of Hwangsanbeol was looking at me.The incarnation of Gyebaek, Chu Wangin was astonished.\u00a0\u201cThat person\u2026?\u201dThe spirit of a constellation was felt despite him not descending directly.\u00a0This was the size of the existences called constellations.\u201cIt has been a while, Gyebaek.\u201dThere was a strange depth in my voice.\u00a0In the distance, the incarnation of Gwanchang staggered.\u201cHwarang Gwanchang, there is no need to pay respect to me.\u201d\u201cG-General\u2026!\u201dKing Heungmu the Great was watching the world through me.\u00a0He looked at Gwanchang, Gyebaek and the broken Seoul.\u00a0I was also watching the world through King Heungmu the Great.\u00a0The sunlight covered the plains of Hwangsan.\u201cIt is funny. Why is it that all of you have gathered here again?\u201dChu Wangin laughed madly at these words.\u00a0It was a laugh filled with deep-seated resentment.\u00a0At this moment, he really was Gyebaek.\u201cDon\u2019t you know? It was to meet you again on this field!\u201d[The character \u2018Chu Wangin\u2019 has used the stigma Baekje Kendo Lv. 4!]Chu Wangin\u2019s sword filled with power and moved.\u00a0Originally, it was an attack that I wouldn\u2019t have been able to avoid or block.\u00a0But I avoided the attack without much difficulty.\u201cGyebaek, why are you doing this to your incarnation? Have you forgotten the constraints of plausibility? You will destroy your incarnation.\u201dIt was as he said. Gyebaek was acting unreasonably.\u00a0I also wondered this as a reader of Ways of Survival.\u201cKim Yushin\u2026 You must\u2019ve heard nothing about this world.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. My wish was achieved the moment I met you. I\u2019ll have no regrets even if I die now!\u201d\u00a0The incarnation of Gyebaek cried out.\u00a0\u201cI carry on Baekje\u2019s legacy of Buyeo, Gyebaek of Hwangsanbeol! I will settle my lifelong regret here!\u201dKing Heungmu the Great watched Gyebaek\u2019s incarnation with sad eyes and opened his mouth through me.\u201cI am the 15th captain of Hwarang, Kim Yushin.\u201dKing Heungmu the Great, Hwarang Leader Kim Yushin.\u201cI will comfort the soul of the unfortunate constellation and correct the history of modern humans.\u201dThe man who led the Battle of Hwangsanbeol to victory sent me his will. I moved my right hand. A bluish glow grew from the hilt.\u300c The sword of the Hwarang leader is now on the battlefield. \u300d[The power of the star relic \u2018Blue Dragon Sword\u2019 is temporarily stored in Unbroken Faith.]The blade of the Blue Dragon Sword soared high into the sky of Hwangsan.All of Hwangsan seemed to scream.\u00a0Enormous magic power escaped and a large crack appeared in the earth, centred around me.\u300c Dragon Flower Tree unit, come to this place right now. \u300dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[The stigma \u2018Gather the Hwarang\u2019 is activated!]Something was happening in the crack.The forgotten ghosts buried in the eternal history.\u00a0There were no names left but they were Hwarang who once lived on this land and who fought only for honour.Kuoooooh!The Dragon Flower Tree, Kim Yushin\u2019s elite unit showed up from the pages of history.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Some Hwarang had no eyes while others had no arms or legs.It was cruel.\u00a0They would raise their blades as long as Kim Yushin was here. This was despite their souls being worn down, their anger erased and even their hearts gone.They were soldiers who fought to prevent the fall of their kingdom.\u00a0Now they were fighting for a fallen kingdom.\u201cYou are still a coward Kim Yushin! Now you are even pushing your dead men!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCome on! Let\u2019s have a one-on-one fight!\u201dI was still at Gyebaek\u2019s provocation. It was because Kim Yushin didn\u2019t want to move. He would crush Gyebaek with the overwhelming force of the Dragon Flower Tree. The magic power that emerged from his sword mercilessly filled the air.\u201cKim Yushin\u2015!\u201dThe shout filled the air and even the emotionlessly Dragon Flower Tree hesitated for a moment.This was Gyebaek.\u00a0The last master of Baekje, Gyebaek.Gyebaek was a constellation that overwhelmed Kim Yushin just in terms of physical buff abilities. In fact, Gyebaek never fought one-on-one against Kim Yushin in the Battle of Hwangsanbeol.To be exact, it right to say that Kim Yushin avoided the confrontation.[The character \u2018Chu Wangin\u2019 has used the stigma Prepared to Fight to the Death for the Country Lv. 2!]In history, Gyebaek\u2019s army fought against Kim Yushin\u2019s army that outnumbered them by several times and won a few impossible battles.The last winner might be Kim Yushin but Gyebaek wasn\u2019t defeated until the final battle of Hwangsanbeol was held.He united his soldiers with patriotism and his shouts were close to insane.I carried Kim Yushin behind me right now but if things were different, I might\u2019ve called Gyebaek.Gwanchang\u2019s incarnation shouted,\u00a0\u201cGeneral!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201dKim Yushin spoke through my mouth. My expression was unchanged despite looking at the dying Dragon Flower Tree members.Kim Yushin\u2019s serene image was conveyed.Gyebaek shouted,\u00a0\u201cYour cowardice hasn\u2019t changed despite you becoming a constellation!\u201dThat\u2019s right. Kim Yushin was a coward.\u00a0He was afraid of death and afraid of defeat.\u00a0That\u2019s why he was strong.\u00a0His emotions were unshakable and he didn\u2019t commit rash acts.Defeat the enemies in a way that achieved victory.\u00a0That\u2019s how he won the final battle of Hwangsanbeol, despite being defeated four previous times.\u201cKuaaaaak!\u201dThe hundreds of Dragon Flower Tree members clashed fiercely with Gyebaek. His incarnation was so severely hurt that he could no longer survive. His whole body was bloody while there were fatal wounds on his arms, thighs and sides.However, Gyebaek kept moving through the crowd of Dragon Flower Tree members towards me.\u201cKim\u2026Yu\u2026shin\u2026!\u201d[The stigma \u2018Request for Reinforcements\u2019 has been activated!]Ghost soldiers appeared like shadows from behind Kim Yushin and sprang towards Gyebaek. Based on the different articles of clothing on the soldiers, they might not be Silla troops.Perhaps they were the Tang Dynasty troops called to destroy Goguryeo.As expected from Kim Yushin. The only thing important to him was winning. Using foreign forces wasn\u2019t an important issue for him.Numerous spears pierced his chest.\u00a0Gyebaek\u2019s incarnation couldn\u2019t overcome the pain and fell to his knees.\u201cKuheok\u2026!\u201dThe incarnation of the strong Gyebaek was now at his limit.Gyebaek laughed.\u201c\u2026I am resentful. I can\u2019t touch you even on this fake stage. I wanted to exchange swords with you just once.\u201dGyebaek\u2019s red eyes made me feel confused.\u00a0Gwanchang was alive, history had changed.\u00a0But this was one part that didn\u2019t change.Kim Yushin asked,\u00a0\u201cGyebaek. Why did you do this?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you die in this state, you can\u2019t choose another incarnation for a while. Why did you suddenly abandon the scenario?\u201dGyebaek had a distant look on his face and then he gave a meaningful smile.\u00a0Kim Yushin waited before pulling out a blade.I hurriedly took back control of my voice.\u201cHe can\u2019t be killed with my hands.\u201d[Why?]\u201c\u2026There are restrictions.\u201dThe King of No Killing meant I couldn\u2019t carry out direct slaughter.\u00a0As soon as I killed one person, I would lose my throne.Kim Yushin nodded like he understood.[\u2026I see. I roughly understand. Don\u2019t worry. The stars will honour your commitment. But it is I, Kim Yushin, who will deal with Gyebaek, not you.]\u201cBut\u2026\u201d[\u2026There is a lingering attachment, please understand.]Kim Yushin gestured and one of the Dragon Flower Tree members nodded.\u00a0I handed over my voice to Kim Yushin.\u201cGyebaek, let\u2019s meet in the next world.\u201dGyebaek\u2019s incarnation looked up at us silently. He wanted to say something but he couldn\u2019t open his mouth. At the last moment, his face looked like a minor actor who completed his scenes rather than Gyebaek.Then the incarnation\u2019s head quietly flew through the air.[Stage Transformation has ended.][You have experienced the Battle of Hwangsanbeol.][1,000 coins have been earned as experience compensation.]I looked around and saw that all of Baekje\u2019s army was wiped out.[The authority of King of No Killing is retained due to the indirect nature of the killing.]It was fortunate.\u00a0King of No Killing was only lost when I killed someone directly with my own hands.\u00a0The life that the Dragon Flower Tree member took wasn\u2019t recognized as me killing someone.\u201cRepresentative-nim! Are you okay?\u201d\u00a0Lee Sungkook\u2019s voice was heard from behind me.Yoo Sangah sighed with relief while Lee Gilyoung was disgruntled that he couldn\u2019t do much. Then Min Jiwon asked,\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell was that\u2026?\u201dShe looked like she had completely lost her soul.I shrugged and said,\u00a0\u201cYou should study history if you want to be a king.\u201dI might\u2019ve called Kim Yushin but I didn\u2019t belong to Silla or Baekje.\u00a0I called Kim Yushin because he was the most appropriate one to deal with Gyebaek.Anyway, I was glad that the result was better than expected.\u00a0I was able to thoroughly check the performance of the Ganpyeongui and I could get some coins and items from the Baekje members.[You have earned 5,400 coins.][Coins Possessed: 74,950 C]Now I wasn\u2019t afraid of the final phase of the fourth scenario.\u201cIt is time to go to the north.\u201d[The remaining duration of the call is three minutes.]Kim Yushin\u2019s divine blessing still remained.\u00a0I should take advantage of the remaining time left on the Ganpyeongui.\u00a0It could only be used seven times so I couldn\u2019t waste it.\u201cRise up Dragon Flower Tree!\u201dThe broken fragments of the Dragon Flower Tree unit rose again and I pointed north with my sword.\u201cAdvance!\u201dThe consumption of magic power was huge so the operation time of the Dragon Flower Tree unit was short. The Dragon Flower Tree unit started to march north, randomly sweeping away the small and medium groups.It might be possible to wipe out all the forces of the other kings gathered at the National Palace Museum.There were screams as forces fought all over the street.\u201cWhat are these skeletons? Aacck!\u201dThe incarnations that ran towards me were crushed by the Dragon Flower Tree unit.Since I wasn\u2019t the one attacking, I didn\u2019t get a penalty for killing.\u00a0Yes, this was an invigorating taste.Kim Yushin\u2019s holy voice was heard in my head.[There is something strange about you. Your mind is intact despite hearing my true voice\u2026]\u201cI have a strong mentality.\u201dI was a bit surprised by the words.\u00a0The constellations used the \u2018indirect messages\u2019 to communicate for a reason.Kim Yushin was just a low-ranking constellation but most people would pee their pants or faint hearing his holy voice.In fact, I was a bit worried about that too\u2026[Remember, you owe me a big debt. In order to help you, I had to embrace more possibilities than necessary.]There was something sinister about his tone.\u00a0I quickly expressed my appreciation.\u201cI am thankful. I won\u2019t forget General\u2019s help.\u201d[You are a hasty friend. You don\u2019t have anyone to pass it onto yet\u2026]\u201c\u2026Won\u2019t it happen one day?

If you don\u2019t mind, I would like to become your sponsor in this world.]His words were nice but it merely meant to be his slave.\u201cThat will be a problem.\u201d[Why? Isn\u2019t my strength enough? You can become the strongest of this age with just my stigma.]The Gather the Hwarang stigma was good.\u00a0But that was when applied to Kim Yushin\u2019s saga.The strongest in this era?\u00a0He was trying to scam me.The words were ridiculous for someone who wasn\u2019t a fable level. If the Great Sage the Equal of Heaven heard it, he would\u2019ve squeezed Kim Yushin\u2019s head tightly.\u201cNow isn\u2019t the age of the Three Kingdoms. You are old and should take a break.\u201dWe had fun together but let\u2019s not see each other again.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is laughing at \u2018King Heungmu the Great\u2019.][300 coins have been sponsored.]Kim Yunshin was silent for a moment, perhaps because his pride was pricked.\u00a0I thought he would back off but a sharp pain suddenly shot through my head.[Have you forgotten that my divine blessing still remains?]Currently, Kim Yushin and I were connected through the Ganpyeongui.\u00a0The muscles of my body spasmed in an unusual manner.\u00a0No matter what, wasn\u2019t he a great person of Korea\u2026?\u00a0No, maybe he could do this because he was a great person of Korea.Dammit.[It would be better to think again.]Yoo Sangah looked at me with worry.\u201cDokja-ssi?\u201d\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi. Get away from me. Quickly!\u201dMy trembling right hand didn\u2019t listen as it raised Unbroken Faith and started pointing it at Yoo Sangah.Kim Yushin started to exert control over my body.[Did you say there was a restriction on your actions? I wonder what the restriction is. What if I kill that woman right now?]\u201cKim Yushin, this is your will. It isn\u2019t my karma.\u201d[Huhu, I don\u2019t know. What if I disengage the moment I stab the blade? Won\u2019t it be recognized as your actions? And this woman seems to be quite precious to you?]\u201c\u2026Stop.\u201d[Make a promise. In the next Sponsor Selection, you will choose Kim Yushin.]The intent of this old fox was obvious.\u00a0The second Sponsor Selection would begin the moment the fourth scenario was over.\u00a0Kim Yushin wanted to use this pledge as an opportunity to acquire me.If I hadn\u2019t read Ways of Survival, it might not be a bad choice.\u00a0Kim Yushin was a fairly decent constellation and there were a few scenario in the middle that could be cleared with Gather the Hwarang alone.However, if I was going to pick a sponsor, I would\u2019ve picked the Great Sage the Equal of Heaven in the beginning. Why should I choose Kim Yushin now?\u201cI said no.\u201dIn addition, I had the contract with Bihyung that didn\u2019t allow me to choose a sponsor.Kim Yushin\u2019s voice hardened.[You are a stubborn young man.

The Fourth Wall had destroyed the theatre master the moment he tried to look inside my head.I was hoping the same thing would happen to the constellation but Kim Yushin noticed quickly and ran away.[The constellation \u2018King Heungmu the Great\u2019 has doubts about your existence.][The constellation \u2018King Heungmu the Great\u2019 will be watching you closely in the future.]In any case, I was still being followed by the old geezer.\u201c\u2026Are you okay?\u201d\u201cYes.

There was the previous theatre and now this museum\u2026\u201d\u201cHyung, are we going to get the legendary sword?\u201d\u201cNo, not right now.\u201dOf course, I could find the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword in this dungeon.\u00a0That\u2019s why I sowed the information.[Please select the type of dungeon you want to enter.]* Single player dungeon \u2013 Nagak (Large seashell played as a horn in Korean traditional music)* Three person dungeon \u2013 Acupuncture Copper Man* Five person dungeon \u2013 Dongui Bogam (Korean book compiled by a royal physician, considered as one of the classics of Oriental medicine)* Seven person dungeon \u2013 Dragon JarHowever, the dungeon with the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword couldn\u2019t be entered in a normal manner. It was because the dungeon was only accessible using the Sang Pyong Tong Bo coin which was given as a reward when clearing a dungeon.I will choose the three person dungeon, the Acupuncture Copper Man.\u201d[You have entered the three person dungeon.]Lee Gilyoung looked a bit disappointed.\u00a0He had been expecting to get a great artifact.\u201cGilyoung. An artifact isn\u2019t about the outward appearance.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cThere are many impressive looking things that have no substance.\u201dThe Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword was one such item.\u00a0Rather, the good things in this dungeon could be obtained from the commonplace dungeons.An example was the skill that could be obtained the Acupuncture Copper Man dungeon.Yoo Sangah was amazed and surprised as soon as we entered the dungeon.\u201c\u2026There are other people besides us.\u201dIntermittent screams could be heard from the dungeon.\u201cUwaaaaack! Go away!\u201dIt was a monster in human form with a matte colour.\u00a0The three person dungeon was filled with these copper people.It was the 7th grade species, the Acupuncture Copper Man.After a certain amount of time, these guys would self-proliferate unless the method to attack them was known. The Acupuncture Copper Man didn\u2019t suffer because they had a strong body, no internal organs and no neural networks.\u201cAaaah! Save me!\u201dSome of the incarnations\u2019 swords cut at copper men but they didn\u2019t receive much damage. Rather, they pulled the incarnations\u2019 bodies down.The body of a man in his 50s was torn to pieces in the hands of the copper men.\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi, how do we deal with these guys? They don\u2019t receive damage at all.\u201dYoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung aimed their weapons or skills at the incoming copper men but there was hardly any effect.Sometimes Lee Gilyoung\u2019s blunt attack would damage them but he didn\u2019t have any idea of what he did.\u201cLook at their bodies.\u201dThe monsters that appeared in the \u2018artifacts trials\u2019 were based on relics kept in Seoul Palace Museum.For example, the monsters in the one player dungeon was literally a musical instrument made of a seashell and as for the Dongui Bogam five person dungeon\u2026 there was no need to explain anything. It was the same for the Acupuncture Copper Man in the three person dungeon.Yoo Sangah stared closely at a copper man and opened her mouth.\u201cIs there something etched on the body?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dIn fact, the Acupuncture Copper Man was a relic that displayed 354 acupuncture points on the human body, including the front, back, arms, legs and head.It was an artifact used to study acupuncture in the Joseon Dynasty.[Blade of Faith is activated!]I stabbed one of the acupuncture points on the copper man.\u00a0Then I twisted it and the body scattered into powder.\u00a0It was a meaningless end for a 7th grade reproduction species.[You have hunted the first Acupuncture Copper Man!]\u201cIf you look closely, the colour for each acupuncture point was subtly different. Some are devoid of blood and some are deadly. Some of the points\u2026 there is a different effect every time an acupuncture point is hit.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026!\u201dThe important thing was to find the acupuncture point that didn\u2019t break the flow.I demonstrated a few times and Lee Gilyoung and Yoo Sangah got the knack for it very quickly.Lee Gilyoung used Diverse Communication to shock the points with small insects, while Yoo Sangah applied Binding Thread. I honestly admired what I saw.These two people, they really had excellent growth.[Your party is the first to hunt 100 Acupuncture Copper Men!][You have cleared the three person dungeon.][Four Sang Pyong Tong Bo coins are obtained as a basic reward.][The exclusive skill \u2018Hit a Pressure Point\u2019 has been acquired.]I got the skill I aimed for.Hit a Pressure Point.\u00a0It was a unique technique to use the pressure points to subdue the enemy.\u00a0It was an essential skill for me to maintain the \u2018King of No Killing.\u2019Yoo Sangah looked at the Sang Pyong Tong Bo coins curiously and muttered,\u00a0\u201cCan we buy something with this?\u201d\u201cIt can be exchanged for coins or a dungeon ticket.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, we will use it for the dungeon admission ticket.

The interesting thing was that Lee Gilyoung looked up at Yoo Sangah with disappointment.\u201cHyung, leave the finishing touches to me.\u201dThis boy\u2026 he already noticed that I couldn\u2019t directly kill a person.[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.][This person isn\u2019t registered in \u2018Character List.\u2019][Currently collecting information about the corresponding figure.]Lee Gilyoung\u2019s information still wasn\u2019t available.I turned my head and encountered Yoo Sangah\u2019s worried eyes. She looked between Lee Gilyoung and I before bowing her head. I spoke to Lee Gilyoung,\u00a0\u201cDo as you please.\u201dI could see what Yoo Sangah was worried about. Lee Gilyoung wasn\u2019t even in middle school yet. But she should be aware of it.\u00a0The morals that we used to have were now useless in this world.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game. Be careful.\u201d\u201cYes, don\u2019t worry.\u201dI listened to Lee Gilyoung\u2019s voice and hid the flag on my back.Until now, the flag was a good bait to attract the small kings. However, from now on, it would just be bait for predators.\u00a0There was nothing good about advertising that I was a king on this battlefield.The intermediate dokkaebi\u2019s voice was heard.[Huhu, everyone is doing well! So many people are doing hidden scenario then what is the meaning of \u2018hidden\u2019?]It had no nerves. I would find it embarrassing now and again.[Someone has already fulfilled the requirements for the first qualification. Once again, this is interesting.]A king had already achieved the black flag.\u00a0It was probably one of the Seven Kings.[After a while, the requirements of the second qualifications will be revealed.]I turned to look at the party members and said,\u00a0\u201cQuickly. The dokkaebi\u2019s \u2018after a while\u2019 might not be long.\u201dI put together the Sang Pyong Tong Bo coins in the lobby one by one.[You have entered a hidden field using 10 Sang Pyong Tong Bo coins.][Do you want to enter the hidden chapter, the Big Dipper?]Right now, I had the purple flag.\u00a0The kings with the same purple flags would flock to the Big Dipper.\u00a0In other words, my prey were all gathered in one place.[You have entered the Big Dipper chapter.]My vision waved and the lobby soon changed. The white marble lobby was transformed into a spacious waiting room.There were seven doors at the end of the waiting room.\u201cUh\u2026!\u201dYoo Sangah let out a brief groan and took a step back. There were bodies at Yoo Sangah\u2019s feet. They were the bodies of group members who had fought each other. Lee Gilyoung looked down at the corpses with an expressionless face.There were so many bodies that it was hard to walk straight. Hundreds of bodies were scattered all over the place like graves.\u00a0There was a wave of blood already.I felt a bit strange.\u00a0If I hadn\u2019t spread the plagiarist writer\u2019s textbook, they might not have died.\u00a0Then didn\u2019t they die because of me?\u201cHey, there are people.\u201dThe centre of the waiting room contained a huge body using the bodies of people as fuel.I could see the faces of some survivors. I didn\u2019t know if they were allies or held a truce, but they weren\u2019t fighting.I looked at the group of people and spoke to my party members.\u00a0\u201cBe careful.\u201dA group stood up.\u00a0Greed could be seen in their eyes.\u201cYou are a newcomer. Who is your king?\u201dSome people secretly moved behind out party while others drew our attention. The encirclement was gradually becoming narrower.\u201cIs it you? Or maybe the woman next to you? It can\u2019t be the kid.\u201d[Many of the constellations are annoyed by the pests.][A few constellations want you to take serious action.]I was already planning on that.\u201cHey, why aren\u2019t you answering\u2026 aack!\u201dThe white light of Unbroken Faith filled the air.\u00a0The unstoppable trajectory cut off the limbs of a person.\u00a0A confused person shouted,\u00a0\u201cDamn! Just kill him!\u201dThe people took out their weapons like they had been waiting.\u00a0But it was too late.\u201cW-Why are you so fast?\u201dThere were few people were agility higher than me right now.They didn\u2019t have high level skills so no one other than the Seven Kings could follow my movements right now.The Blade of Faith swung in a semicircle and cut five or six people at the same time.The attack that followed cut off a hand holding a weapon.\u00a0I pierced another wrist.\u201cKuaaaak!\u201dThe severed limbs flew unrealistically through the air. I walked behind a man screaming painfully and used a skill.[The exclusive skill \u2018Hit a Pressure Point Lv. 1\u2019 is activated.]I had cut off the man\u2019s limbs but there was no need to be cruel.There was a dark blue dagger hidden in the man\u2019s arms.\u00a0This was the poisonous dagger that could be obtained at the end of the 5 person dungeon, the \u2018Dongui Bogam\u2019. If my response had been even a bit late, this would\u2019ve been us.As soon as the people collapsed, I called to Lee Gilyoung.\u201cPlease.\u201dLee Gilyoung nodded.\u00a0Lee Gilyoung\u2019s hand stopped the people\u2019s breathing one by one.\u00a0He moved his hand like he was killing insignificant insects.\u00a0I was also a little surprised.Then Yoo Sangah came forward.\u201cI\u2019ll do it Gilyoung\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Can you do it?\u201d\u201cI will still do it.\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s tone was unusually stubborn. She looked grimly at Lee Gilyoung. She held a knife and turned her back to me. Maybe Yoo Sangah despised me.Perhaps it was fortunate that I couldn\u2019t read Yoo Sangah\u2019s mind.Yoo Sangah moved even more efficiently than Lee Gilyoung and took the lives of the remaining people.\u00a0\u00a0Her fingertips trembled as the work finished.\u201c\u2026Will we continue in this fashion?\u201d\u201cYes, probably.\u201d\u201cI will do it in the future instead of Gilyoung.\u201d\u201cCan you do it?\u201d\u201c\u2026There is no problem. It is just like breaking an egg.\u201dYoo Sangah used an analogy as she pretended to be calm.\u201cI can do it better.\u201d Lee Gilyoung grumbled, making Yoo Sangah place a hand on his head.There would be many twists and turns in the future. Sometimes we might feel like collapsing or want to give up.\u00a0But we had to overcome it.Most of the Seven Kings we would soon meet would have higher stats than us and they would also possess unique skills. There would certainly be situations where we couldn\u2019t win without being hit by the enemies.We silently picked up the items that the group dropped.[You have earned 2,300 coins.][The item \u2018Dongui Bogam \u2013 Various Diseases (Upper Half of the Body)\u2019 has been acquired.]As expected, they were people who cleared the five person dungeon. A total of eight books were available from the five person dungeon, each with different usages. I was sure there were a few people who cleared the five person dungeon so the others should be moderately easy to find.Unfortunately, there was no \u2018king\u2019 in the group I just killed.Clap clap clap.Then the sound of clapping was heard.One of the men watching from the big bonfire approached me with a smile on his face. He showed no signs of panic despite the other group being wiped out.I raised my item and warned them casually.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201dThe man took one step back and raised both hands as if he had no intention of fighting.\u201cUhh, calm down. I don\u2019t want to fight.\u201dI took a closer look at the man.\u00a0There was a large spear on his back. The firm chest muscles were revealed by the clothes and his long hair was tied back.\u201cYou have great skills. You don\u2019t seem to have any passive skills but you wiped out the Chungjeong group\u2026 those bastards, they are one of the groups that lost their king.\u201dOf course, that\u2019s why they came forward so recklessly.\u201cBut you\u2019re a little late. The major kings have all entered the dungeon. They will be busy fighting now. Well, the winner is almost decided but\u2026 the last king who passed through here was incredibly fierce.\u201d\u201cWho is that?\u201d\u201cDo you know the Tyrant King?\u201d\u00a0The man continued to speak.\u00a0\u201cHe is currently the most powerful king in northern Seoul. This is a story between those who already know. The owner of the Absolute Throne will surely be the Tyrant King.\u201dA person might think so if they saw the Tyrant King in person.\u00a0The Tyrant King\u2019s armed force was certainly the top among the Seven Kings.But it was laughable for him to be the owner of the Absolute Throne.\u00a0The Tyrant King was strong but he wasn\u2019t the strongest among the Seven Kings.As if reading my mind, the man opened his mouth.\u201cBut I don\u2019t think so. I think that the Tyrant King will never become the owner of the Absolute Throne.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why do you think that?\u201d\u201cI saw it myself. He has a strong power but he doesn\u2019t know how to handle people. A king must know the hearts of the people.\u201dThe hearts of the people?\u201cMy king is able to do that. It is why many incarnations follow him. I am sure that my king will become the master of the Absolute Throne.\u201dI followed the man\u2019s glance. The Big Dipper chapter consisted of seven entrances.\u00a0Perhaps his king was moving in one of the passages.\u201cWhat is your point? Do you want us to join you?\u201d\u201cHaha, that would be nice but you won\u2019t follow me just like that, right? I just want to make an offer. If you don\u2019t mind, why don\u2019t you ally with us?\u201dI realized why this man was still in the waiting room.\u00a0This guy was a bait.\u201cWhy should I?\u201d\u201cThe Tyrant King is very strong. I believe in my king but I don\u2019t think he can defeat the Tyrant King alone.\u201dIn contrast to his loyalty, he was a very realistic guy.\u00a0But he was a \u2018real\u2019 loyalist.\u201cThink about it. What will happen if we can\u2019t stop him from holding the legendary sword? What if he gets the Absolute Throne and controls all the kings in Seoul? Don\u2019t you think that you should stop this no matter what?\u201dI dimly remembered.It didn\u2019t happen in the third regression but the \u2018Anti-Tyrant King Alliance\u2019 had formed many times in Ways of Survival.Once again, the future had changed.\u201cYou have a point.\u201d\u201cThat is why I\u2019m making this suggestion. Our group will soon be acting against the Tyrant King. We have already talked with several other kings. I don\u2019t know what group you belong to but you won\u2019t lose anything by joining us. You just need to give us a spoonful.\u201dIt was exactly as he said.\u00a0The problem was that the price of the spoonful was bigger than he thought\u2026The man took my silence as my acceptance.\u201cIf you are serious, you can meet our king and think about it. It is almost time for him to return to the waiting room\u2026 Oh, there he is.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn fact, one of the seven doors opened and the group that entered the Big Dipper returned.\u201cKing\u2026\u201dThe people standing at the door knelt down at once.\u00a0Then the man in the centre of the crowd approached this side.He was a clean shaven man.\u00a0There was a brown club in his hands.Wait.

They were just like their nicknames.\u00a0They had decent skills and stats but they were one step lacking compared to the Seven Kings.The only one I needed to pay attention to was the Earth Dragon King Gu Daesung.Gu Daesung discovered Cha Sangkyung and asked, \u201cYou have already come out?Fast.\u201d\u201cYou are a rude earthworm.\u201d\u201c\u2026Earthworm? Is that what you are calling my sponsor?\u201dYoo Sangah was startled when she heard their words and whispered to me,\u00a0\u201cThat person, I think he has a good sponsor behind him.\u201d\u201c\u2026How do you know?\u201d\u201cI heard the story that the king of Baekje was born from an earth dragon.\u201d\u201cEarth dragon?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what they meant by \u2018earthworm.\u2019 The other kings are calling him the son of an earth dragon in a mocking manner.\u201dShe was really amazing. She figured out the identity of Gu Daesung with this much information.Yoo Sangah was right.Earth Dragon King Gu Daesung.\u00a0In my memories, he was one of Seoul\u2019s Seven Kings with the late King Gyeon Hwon as his sponsor.\u201cThere are quite a few people with kings as a sponsor. Then the king we saw before\u2026\u201dI nodded.\u00a0In fact, it wasn\u2019t a coincidence that there were so many incarnations with a \u2018king\u2019 as their sponsor.The situation would be similar in other areas, not just the Seoul Dome.In Japan, there would be a competition between the three heroes including Oda Nobunaga. In the UK, there would be a competition between Richard the Lionheart or Henry VIII.The world\u2019s greatest constellations would be preparing for a war over the Absolute Throne, raising their coordination with their incarnation to a breathtaking level.[The constellation \u2018Maritime War God\u2019 is expecting the appearance of a new fable class constellation.][The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 is watching the situation with sweaty hands.The other high-ranking constellations were also interested.\u00a0It was natural.\u00a0As I said before, the fourth scenario was an event for the greatest constellations of each country.\u201cIs everyone gathered?\u201dThe kings soon gathered in the middle and gave a speech.\u201cOur enemy is the Tyrant King who entered the third door! The Tyrant King has already received two jewels from this dungeon and cowardly raided innocent kings. Some of the people present would\u2019ve lost a king to him.\u201dThat\u2019s why this waiting room was a field of corpses.Perhaps the Tyrant King killed two kings and took away their star jewels.\u00a0It meant he would soon gather all seven star jewels\u2026\u201cThe new Seoul shouldn\u2019t be handed over to such a person. If he gets the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword and then takes the Absolute Throne, there will be endless grief and tragedy in Seoul!\u201d\u201cThus, the people have to fight! Get up right now! The kings here are all wise. The future will be fine no matter which of us becomes the absolute king. We have to at least stop the worst king!\u201d\u201cThis will be a struggle for a righteous way of living! Take care! You will be great fighters taking your first step into a new history!\u201dThe speech didn\u2019t have much substance but people became excited.\u00a0Some people cheered, some sympathized while others were touched to tears.\u00a0It was like they were real revolutionaries fighting for justice.I looked at the scene alone.Just one month ago, the people here had voted for a president.\u00a0They did their duty and agreed to have private property through legitimate economic activities. All of a sudden, it felt like a dream.In just one month, Seoul had returned to the kingdom days.\u201cDepart!\u201dHundreds of people entered through the third door.\u00a0Cha Sangkyung\u2019s group was at the back and we moved in line with them.Our vision wavered before a giant tunnel appeared. It was a huge tunnel where the size couldn\u2019t be easily measured.Han Sooyoung walked beside me and opened his mouth.\u00a0\u201cThis is so exciting. I feel like I\u2019m in a martial arts novel.\u201d\u201cA martial arts novel?\u201dHan Sooyoung nodded with a meaningful smile.\u00a0\u201cWhy, don\u2019t you think it is like a martial arts novel? It is like a treasure map. The legendary sword is sleeping in the stone chamber and whoever obtains the sword shall be the best person in the world!\u201dHan Sooyoung spoke accompanied by gestures seemed quite plausible. It wouldn\u2019t be unbelievable if he was an actor.\u201cIt is a common cliche in a martial arts novel, the treasure sword.\u201d\u201cOh, Dokja-ssi, do you read martial arts novels as well?\u201dIt couldn\u2019t be missed when talking about genre fiction.\u201cI read quite a bit. By the way, there is a common development in these cliche novels.\u201d\u201cCommon development? What is it?\u201d\u201cIt turns out that the treasure map is a fake! This type of development.\u201dHan Sooyoung\u2019s eyes shook.\u00a0\u201cThis is interesting. What happens next?\u201d\u201cIt is an obvious story. The \u2018shadow\u2019 laughs quietly and kills the people gathered because of the fake treasure.\u201d\u201cHoh\u2026 is that the current situation? Could someone be a shadow?\u201dI nodded and stated,\u00a0\u201cIt is a possibility although I don\u2019t like such obvious cliches.\u201d\u201cUm? What does that mean?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, there are too many cliches like the treasure sword.\u201cHmm\u2026 there are too many stories, making it bad?\u201d\u201cFor writers, I think it is a story that lacks distress.\u201dHan Sooyoung\u2019s expression slightly hardened.\u00a0\u201cThen what would Dokja-ssi do if you were the writer? What if you had to write about the treasure sword?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I am a \u2018reader\u2019 as my name suggests.\u201d\u201cI think that a reader would do the same. Writing familiar cliches will give satisfaction to the readers.\u201dYes, I thought he would say something like this.\u00a0I smiled and asked, \u201cWho said this?\u00a0You are speaking as a writer. I\u2019m not saying that cliches are bad. At the very least, a plagiarist shouldn\u2019t use it.\u201d\u201cPla\u2026giarist?\u201d\u201cYes, a plagiarist.\u201dIt was funny to see Han Sooyoung\u2019s face change colours.\u201cWell, every story is similar. It is the details that are a bit different\u2026 Can it really be called plagiarism? Perhaps if Dokja-ssi is the writer\u2015\u201d\u201cNope, I would do it differently.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHan Sooyoung\u2019s eyebrows twitched.\u00a0\u201c\u2026You would write it differently? How?\u201d\u201cFor example, like this.\u201dI raised Unbroken Faith and cut his neck.\u00a0No blood was visible as his head fell down.I added, \u201cWhy are you hiding when it will be revealed anyway?\u201dThen Han Sooyoung\u2019s head spoke from where it was lying on the ground.\u00a0\u201cHow interesting.

I stepped to one side with Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung.\u00a0Of course, Han Sooyoung\u2019s talking head was still held in one hand.\u201cI was right. It is you who spread out the \u2018text novel.\u2019 Right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I scattered the text version of your plagiarized novel.\u201d\u201c\u2026The revelation isn\u2019t plagiarized.\u201d\u201cIt is plagiarism.

In addition, they would soon have no room to worry about us. I smiled at Han Sooyoung.\u201cThe cliche that you said will start soon.\u201dI waited and there was a burst of light.\u00a0The rings of light moved, drawing lines of blood on the bodies of some people.\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dA person screamed as blood spurted from a body cut to pieces.\u00a0The people in the back screamed and moved.\u201cDamn these guys!\u201dIt was black magic power that came from a strong presence approaching in front of me.\u201cRaise the palanquin.\u201dThe neutral voice came from the large palanquin.

Die!\u201dA dazzling magic power poured out of the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword and swept through the battlefield. However, people didn\u2019t die easily. People thought they were going to explode but they managed to neutralize her magic power.Her magic power was weakened because she used a lot of avatars and above all, the three main kings were still alive.The confused Han Sooyoung shouted,\u00a0\u201cW-What is this?

If Yoo Jonghyuk, who was much stronger than the original third regression, ignored everything and engaged in the war of kings, this scenario would\u2019ve ended at his pace.Then I would never get the ending that I wanted.\u201c\u2026Okay. Let\u2019s put the sword down and talk. What if I was a real jerk?\u201d\u201cAre you taking my family hostage?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s going overboard.

Why are you still fighting? Let\u2019s see, you\u2019ve met the qualifications.]The intermediate dokkaebi appeared at this moment.Yoo Jonghyuk also confirmed the number board floating in the air.[Number of kings remaining: 5.][The \u2018Last King\u2019s Qualification\u2019 has begun.]The bodies of the remaining kings, including me and Yoo Jonghyuk, started to be forcibly moved through space.\u201cKim Dok\u2026!\u201dYoo Jonghyuk reached out for me but it was too late.I finally reached the last phase of this scenario.[The qualified kings will move to the final testing place.]The landscape started changing.

A moment later, I became conscious again.[You aren\u2019t qualified to take past in the \u2018Last King\u2019s Qualifications.]\u2026What?I looked around and saw that I was standing in the centre of Gwanghwamun. I had bumped into a barrier the size of a schoolyard. The centre contained the Absolute Throne, the last reward of this scenario.Why couldn\u2019t I enter?[Hahahat! This, this! You were only looking at the big picture and missed something important!]I looked up at the sound of laughter and saw the ridiculing face of the intermediate dokkaebi. I thought he was playing tricks on me but then an unexpected message flashed.[You have failed to occupy the \u2018target station\u2019 of the fourth scenario.][You must first take the target station to be qualified for the \u2018Last King\u2019s Qualifications\u2019.][Your group\u2019s target station is Changsin Station.]Ah\u2026 I was only thinking about the kings and forgot.\u00a0I hadn\u2019t occupied it yet.[The last phase can\u2019t be performed unless the previous phase is cleared properly. Did you think you could get away with it?]There was already fighting going on inside the barrier.\u00a0If this continued, everything I had done would be in vain.\u00a0I thought I should run to Changsin Station before it was too late.By the way\u2026 damn.\u00a0Wouldn\u2019t all the scenarios end if I ran there?\u201cDokja-ssi!\u201dYoo Sangah was rushing over here while carrying the collapsed Lee Gilyoung. But there were more people with them.

How many times do I have to say it?\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m hungry.\u201dJung Heewon wasn\u2019t supposed to be here right now.\u00a0After saving a girl from the Gangbuk area of Seoul, she should wait at Changshin Station.\u00a0That was Jung Heewon\u2019s job in this scenario.\u201cHeewon-ssi, why are you here? I told you to wait at Changsin Station\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, how long was I waiting? \u00a0Besides, she has been hungry since morning. Aren\u2019t you worried about your sister?\u201dAt Jung Heewon\u2019s words, the girl pointed to me and said, \u201cThat person isn\u2019t my brother.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cHe is uglier than my brother.\u201dDamn kid.\u00a0Jung Heewon was surprised as she looked between me and the girl.\u00a0\u201cEh? This isn\u2019t Dokja-ssi\u2019s sister? I thought that was why you asked me to save her.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen who is it?\u201dIt was natural for Jung Heewon not to know.\u00a0Who would think this girl would be the psychopath\u2019s sister?I heard a growling sound from the girl\u2019s stomach. I listened to the sound and laughter emerged.\u2026Would my perfect plan collapse here?\u201cDokja-ssi, where are you going?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to occupy Changsin Station.\u201dI had to challenge it, even if I was late.\u00a0I wish there was a long-distance teleport scroll but the intermediate dokkaebi wouldn\u2019t let me open the Dokkaebi Bag.Then Jung Heewon looked at me and opened her mouth.\u00a0\u201cWhy would you go there?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cKid, bring that thing out. Didn\u2019t I give it to you before?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dYoo Jonghyuk\u2019s sister, Yoo Mia put her hand in her mouth. After a moment, her mouth became abnormally large and an unusual sized stone emerged. It was Yoo Mia\u2019s exclusive skill, Inventory. I moved towards the chunk of stone.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201dI examined the rough surface of the stone.\u00a0Then I saw a small groove that could hold something.\u2026I never thought of this. Was this method possible?\u00a0No one had tried this in Ways of Survival.Jung Heewon shamelessly said, \u201cDon\u2019t you need the flagpole to occupy the station?\u201dWhat type of ignorant human would think up an idea like this?\u00a0Jung Heewon had cut up the floor that contained the flag holder of Changshin Station.[The constellation \u2018Adventurer who Stands Up an Egg\u2019 admires Jung Heewon\u2019s idea.]I tried to say something but fell silent.\u201cWhy, is something wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\u201cThen what are you doing?

At least, if it was the original story.\u201cDie!\u201dMaitreya King Cha Sangkyung\u2019s leg split apart the air while Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s kick struck Cha Sangkyung\u2019s abdomen.\u201cKuk!\u201dHowever, Cha Sangkyung wasn\u2019t as damaged as expected.\u00a0It was because all stats were changed to level 10. The skills were sealed so Yoo Jonghyuk had to win the battle with just his flesh memories.Min Jiwon looked behind them and saw me.\u00a0I nodded slightly at her.\u201cWe meet again.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. I didn\u2019t want to fight you if possible.\u201dMin Jiwon must\u2019ve filled the other king\u2019s qualifications if she came to this place. It was great.

It is a natural right to be able to use coins. The \u2018coins\u2019 are the hard-earned work of the incarnations.

So be careful! It is like throwing away coins into the air! Hahahat!]Min Jiwon and Cha Sangkyung\u2019s complexions darkened once they heard the words of the intermediate dokkaebi. Perhaps they didn\u2019t have much coins remaining. It was natural. They wouldn\u2019t be able to save coins in the battlefield between kings.But Yoo Jonghyuk was different.\u00a0Yoo Jonghyuk grew by breaking through all types of hidden scenarios from the beginning and always carried an appropriate amount of coins in reserve.The original third round Yoo Jonghyuk had around 30,000 coins at this point. Now he had more coins than the original story so\u2026 it should be around 40,000?There was the loud sound of somebody being hit and Cha Sangkyung\u2019s body flew through the air.[The Maitreya King Cha Sangkyung is out of combat.]Yoo Jonghyuk looked at the nearby Min Jiwon.

The flying Yoo Jonghyuk hit a barrier, bounced in the opposite direction and hit another barrier and landed on the ground after repeating this ping-pong action five or six times.\u2026Surely he wasn\u2019t dead?\u00a0I ran towards Yoo Jonghyuk with a bit of confusion in my heart.Damn, why did I do this?

How can you say to kill me every time you see me?\u201dI slapped his swollen face.

It is the same for you. I know that not all constellations are the same. Some constellations are low and some are high.\u201dThere was an invisible rank among constellations.Just as some constellations watched the incarnations, other constellations watched the constellations.\u00a0To be precise, the low constellations were the ones being watched.\u201cBut is it enough now?

I have to destroy this throne.\u201dThe length of the new scenario was contained in this throne.\u00a0I pulled out a sword causing someone to cry out.\u201cThe Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword!\u201dThe S+ grade Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword.However, it was an item that could be changed into a star relic if certain conditions were satisfied. It was because the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword was an item made with the soul of a constellation.[Ganpyeongui\u2019s special option \u2018Echo of the Stars\u2019 has been activated.][\u2018Echo of the Stars\u2019 allows you to ask for the help of a constellation.]\u201cI\u2019ll call a constellation.\u201d[The great constellations hear your voice flowing through the stars.]I called out to the constellations like I had memorized a spell.\u201cI want the first star of the Big Dipper.\u201dThe Greedy Wolf star (Dubhe).\u201cI want the second star of the Big Dipper.\u201dThe Great Gate star (Merak).\u201cI want the third star of the Big Dipper.\u201dThe Blessing star (Phecda).\u201cI want the fourth star of the Big Dipper.\u201dThe Literate Turn star (Megrez).\u201cI want the fifth star of the Big Dipper.\u201dThe Clean and Pure star (Alioth).\u201cI want the sixth star of the Big Dipper.\u201dThe Military Turn star (Mizar).[The star navigation has begun.][The six constellations are looking at you.]The thousands of constellations disappeared and my mind became heavy like a crowded subway.

The Great Bear stars started talking.[What are you thinking?][You called all of us.][Your mind will be completely destroyed.][Why call us?][Why don\u2019t you go the easy path\u2026][Instead of the thorny path?]However, I didn\u2019t stop. Yes, one more constellation needed to be called if I wanted to use the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword. But there were no constellations left on the Sky Disc.[You have exhausted the number of times that Ganpyeongui can be used.]I pulled out the Dragon Jar that I got from the Tyrant King and dissolved something in it.The 7 person dungeon, the dissolving jar.\u00a0I put two items in the jar.\u201cI will sacrifice the S-grade Three Ring Loop and the S-grade Ganpyeongui to call one more constellation.\u201d[The \u2018Dissolve\u2019 power of the Dragon Jar has shown its strength.][The S-grade Three Ring Loop has disappeared as a sacrifice.][The S-grade Ganpyeongui has one more use.]I once again used Ganpyeongui and called one last constellation.\u201cI want the seventh star of the Big Dipper.\u201dThe Broken Army star (Alkaid).Seven stars filled the air.\u00a0The seven stars that made up the Big Dipper were all gathered.\u00a0At the same time, the seven stars spoke to me.[What do you want from us?]\u201cI want to cut off the signs of the constellations. Lend me your sword.\u201d[\u2026Do you know what this means?]\u201cI know.\u201dI did this despite being well aware of the risk.The final reward of the fourth scenario was the Absolute Throne.The throne was an item that borrowed the power of a \u2018god of the world.\u2019It would be very convenient if I got the throne. I would be able to put restrictions on Yoo Jonghyuk and the enemies threatening me would disappear.But Seoul would surely be eliminated.\u00a0It would be a complete destruction without any salvation or miracles.It was the price to be paid for borrowing the power of the throne.\u00a0In order to obtain the ending I wanted, no one could take this throne.[Even the heavenly constellations are afraid of the founder of the throne.][But you, a human, wants to challenge the owner of this thing?]\u201cI can do it with your help. And I\u2019m not fighting against the owner.

Then I will start now.\u201dThe seven stars were silent. Some time passed. The Big Dipper shone brightly and their signs were engraved onto the sword.[I shall respect your will.][Even if you die here.][We will remember you.]A dazzling light wrapped around the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword and it started to burn with bright flames.[The S+ grade Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword has evolved into the star relic \u2018Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword.\u2019]The star relic Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword was originally a ceremonial sword.\u00a0It was a sword to cut off evil energy and prevent disasters.I swung the sword towards the Absolute Throne.\u00a0There was a loud sound and fire flared.The Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword was one of the few items that could break the link that a constellation had to a star relic.There was a tearing sound in the air.As if it started to notice something, an ominous black light floated above the Absolute Throne. I swung it a few more times and the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword started to collapse. Now I had to believe in the Big Dipper stars. Yoo Sangah cried out, \u201cDokja-ssi!\u00a0Quickly!\u201dI wielded the sword like a madman.\u00a0I ignored the breaking blade and continued to hit the throne.\u00a0Sparks flashed and the blade broke.Then finally.[The constellation linked to the star relic \u2018Absolute Throne\u2019 has disappeared.][The \u2018Unknown God\u2019 has noticed a change in this world.]The Absolute Throne became an ordinary chair and lost its light.\u00a0The intermediate dokkaebi\u2019s angry voice was heard.[You lowlifes can\u2019t grasp who you are dealing with\u2026!][The sub scenario has ended.]People stopped moving. The scenario was over so they didn\u2019t have to continue. The Big Dipper stars told me.[Incarnation, prepare for the flooding of possibilities.]As soon as I heard the voice, blood poured from my mouth.It felt like something was pulling at my presence. An enormous power that seemed to tear at my flesh surrounded me. I struggled to regain my mind. It was going to be okay.The \u2018possibility\u2019 would become \u2018plausibility\u2019. I tried my best to make everything plausible. Thus, I could overcome this.I barely held onto consciousness.\u00a0Then a star in the distant night sky shone quietly.[The constellation \u2018Maritime War God\u2019 is looking at you.]It was a calm, lonely but gentle gaze.[The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 is looking at you.]Then two.[The constellation \u2018Last Hero of Hwangsanbeol\u2019 is looking at you.]Three.[The constellation \u2018Lady of the Brocade Sleep\u2019 is looking at you.]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.The intermediate dokkaebi called out when he saw the messages from the constellations.[Why\u2026?]Every time a star was added, my pain diminished a little bit. I realized that the constellations were sharing the \u2018probabilities\u2019 that I had to bear. The \u2018story that isn\u2019t plausible\u2019 became a \u2018plausible story\u2019 with the consent of many stars. Numerous stars were wrapping me in their light. The Big Dippers also lent me their strength.[Is this the story that you wanted to show?]I wanted to answer but I didn\u2019t have the power.[We will watch you, king of the world without kings.]The chaotic Seoul night sky.\u00a0I looked at the stars that sent me light.[The constellation \u2018King Heungmu the Great\u2019 is looking at you.][The constellation \u2018One-eyed Maitreya\u2019 is looking at you.]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.All the upper-grade constellations of Seoul were shining towards me.\u00a0There were many stars.\u00a0Still, it wasn\u2019t enough to overturn the dark night sky.I looked up at the turbulent clouds that filled the Great Hall.[The fourth scenario is forcibly ended.][There was an unscheduled incident so it will take time to settle the scenario.]I wiped the blood pouring from my nose and the intermediate dokkaebi approached.[You have made the worst choice.

Anything that happens to you from now on is the fault of that human.]The intermediate dokkaebi\u2019s answer was cold.The dokkaebi pointed towards me while the wet shoulders of the gathered people shook.[A world with no kings? Okay. Let\u2019s try it once. I will see how well you can survive without a focal point.]The intermediate dokkaebi flicked his finger. Then the people in Gwanghwamun started to disappear like smoke. People screamed and ran away.\u201cWhat? What is this all of a sudden?!\u201d\u2026This was an unscheduled development.I looked back and saw Jung Heewon, Yoo Sangah, Lee Gilyoung and the others calling out to me.\u201cDokja-ssi!\u201dThe next moment, Yoo Sangah disappeared. Then Lee Gilyoung and Jung Heewon. Next was Jung Minseob and Lee Sungkook. One minute after the dokkaebi flicked his finger, I was the only one remaining in Gwanghwamun. The intermediate dokkaebi looked at me with a creepy smile.[Please keep this in mind. If this world is destroyed, it is all because of you.]The moment I wanted to speak, there was a ringing sound.My body shook and I was moved elsewhere. It was accompanied by severe nausea and a headache. I lost consciousness because I had consumed a great deal of energy.[10,000 coins have been earned as settlement for the fourth scenario.]***I slept for quite a long time because I was tired from excessive contact with the constellations.I even dreamt.\u00a0It was a dream from before the end began.\u2013Hey, aren\u2019t you awake?The moment I heard the voice, I realized it was my high school days.\u00a0They were the days when I was beaten up by the school gangsters.\u2026Yes. There were times like this.\u00a0It was a childish dream but I became furious when I thought about it again.\u2013What?\u00a0Why are you looking at me like that?\u00a0Do you want to kill someone?My head fell back from his slap.Blood flowed from my cracked lips and my tingling cheeks caused a feeling of shame.Arms, legs, and shoulders. Pain came from all these places.\u00a0It might be a dream but it was more painful than reality.\u00a0Maybe it was because there was no Fourth Wall here.\u2013Why?\u00a0If it is too much, stab me.\u00a0Do you want to appear in the same newspapers as your mother?My clenched fists trembled but I couldn\u2019t hit him.\u00a0At that time, what had I been thinking?\u2018\u2026If only I was Yoo Jonghyuk.\u2019Yes, that\u2019s right. This was what I thought in my misery. It was the time when I was reading Ways of Survival.I say the name on the uniform\u2019s name badge.Song Minwoo.What was he doing now?\u00a0I remember that he had gone to university and was working well.

That\u2019s why Lee Jihye was at a school while Lee Hyunsung was sent to a military base. Lee Hyunsung was the most pathetic one.Maybe it was the damn intermediate dokkaebi\u2019s doing.He created a situation where the incarnations were scattered all over the place. No matter how irrelevant it was to the main scenario, the intermediate dokkaebi would surely be reprimanded.I looked at the confused people and muttered.\u2018I\u2019m fine so take care of yourself. I will see you soon.\u2019They couldn\u2019t hear me but I hoped the words would reach them.[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint stage 3 has ended.]I slowly returned to consciousness as my eyelids opened.\u00a0Black clouds were still swirling over Seoul like a black hole.I got up and looked around.\u00a0It was a panoramic view of Seoul. It was a place where skyscrapers and high-rise buildings could be seen.That reminded me, I should be moved to a place related to me.\u00a0At first glance, it looked like the rooftop of a high-rise building in Seoul\u2026\u201cThis place\u2026?\u201dDamn, I thought it was possible but I really didn\u2019t want to come here.[A few constellations are looking forward to the words you will say to yourself.]\u201c\u2026Mino Soft?This was the rooftop of the company I worked for, Mino Soft.[A few constellations are disappointed.][The constellations who don\u2019t like to be rushed are pleased.]When I saw the indirect messages that came to my mind, I felt that the constellations focusing on me had expanded after I broke the Absolute Throne.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 threatens the newly appeared constellations.][The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 is coughing at the pretentious people.]Why did I come here?\u00a0A street in Seoul without any cars. The offices with the lights turned off.I felt nostalgia as I saw these familiar buildings.\u00a0It was the first time I went to work in a month.I felt really weird when I remembered coming up to the rooftop with Deputy Yoon after being scolded by Team Leader Han. When previously I had been testing new games, now I was cutting people with a blade.Was Deputy Yoon still alive?I turned my head and saw messages flashing in the air.[There are 10 days before the start of the fifth scenario.]The scenarios were flowing as I expected.\u00a0If the Absolute Throne was destroyed, Seoul Dome would get a respite for 10 days.The fifth scenario, the Great Hall.During this grace period, I had to find a way to clear the fifth scenario without the Absolute Throne.[A sub scenario is in progress to supplement the interlude.]+[Sub Scenario \u2013 Survival Activities]Category: SubDifficulty: C+Clear Conditions: Survive for 10 days in the ruined city.

The existing scenario was completely destroyed so they hastily put together a sub scenario.Furthermore, it overlapped with a coin payment event.\u00a0I thought they were going to do it soon but I hadn\u2019t expected it to start already.A survival fee of 500 coins a day\u2026 it was a scenario that couldn\u2019t be cleared without a coin event.Anyway, now I had to move.\u00a0I couldn\u2019t miss out on the chance to replenish my coins.Then people\u2019s voices were heard from below the roof.\u201cDrag it! Quickly!\u201dI looked down and saw armed people entering the building, with others behind them.Mino Soft was located near Seocho-gu.\u00a0But in my memories, there were no \u2018king\u2019 forces in the Seocho area.\u2026Then who were they?\u00a0I carefully observed the armed people and realized something.Yes, they were the \u2018wanderers\u2019.\u00a0Each person had a different way of living in this destroyed world.Someone would become \u2018king\u2019 and others would become \u2018the people.\u2019\u00a0Someone else would become a \u2018wanderer\u2019 without any affiliation.And Seocho was the land of wanderers.I turned on my smartphone to look up the information on this area. Unfortunately, I was out of battery. I needed to find a place to recharge the battery or find a spare battery\u2026I opened the roof door and went downstairs. I passed through the president\u2019s office, the planning department and the finance department. I walked through the office of the QA team that I had worked in for a while when I stopped.It was fair to say that my memory was quite good.\u00a0I went into the office and opened the drawers one by one.It was because I thought a spare battery might be left behind. At that time, someone entered with a flashlight.I reflexively pulled out my sword but there was a strange noise.\u201cEh?\u201d\u2026?\u201cD-Dokja-ssi? It is Dokja-ssi!\u201dThen I saw the man\u2019s face.\u201cDeputy Yoon?\u201d\u201cAhh, you\u2019re alive! You are alive!\u201dIt was Deputy Yoon of the QA team.***\u201cIt was really terrible.\u201dI heard from Deputy Yoon about what happened at Mino Soft. To be exact, it was what happened after I got off from work.\u201cThe first scenario started for all the people on the night shift.\u201dDeputy Yoon spoke while holding his nose.The corridor of the company was filled with rotting body odor and maggots. Some of the bodies had faces of people I knew but I didn\u2019t see any mourning or sadness on Deputy Yoon\u2019s expression.\u201cDo you know? That guy over there, Team Manager Kim, I killed him. \u00a0Why, that bastard\u2026 I stabbed his neck with a ballpoint pen and blood\u2026 it really was like a game.\u201d\u201c\u2026Deputy Yoon.\u201d\u201cS-Sorry. Is it uncomfortable talking about this? Haha.\u201dIt was a natural change but I felt bitter seeing Deputy Yoon\u2019s changed appearance. No\u2026 maybe this was what Director Yoon was like now.\u201cAre you alone here?\u201d\u201cHuh? Ahh, I\u2019m not alone. By the way, where was Dokja-ssi?\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t see you in the company. What group are you affiliated with? Where you somewhere else?\u201d\u201cYes, well\u2026 Something similar. I was originally on the Gwanghwamun side of the bridge when\u2026\u201dDeputy Yoon didn\u2019t listen to the end as he interrupted.\u201cAha, I see. Dokja-ssi, you luck is really bad.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cThere is no need to pass through all the scenarios. Don\u2019t you know? If you hide well and use moderate tricks, most scenarios will be broken by other people. There is no need to risk your life. Haha, it is very comfortable despite the world being like this.\u201dIt was true. If you became a \u2018wanderer\u2019 who didn\u2019t belong to anyone, you could get rid of some scenario that must be cleared and have the main scenarios cleared by someone else. There were many such people in Seoul Dome.They problem was that if you lived in hiding and were caught by surrounding groups, you would die.\u00a0There was no prey as good as the \u2018wanderers\u2019 moving alone.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. Wanderers also have a lot of power. Is there a need to be a king to build power?\u201dWe exited Mino Soft. People were crowded around the company and there were a bunch of wanderers gathered. Some of them were seen moving kidnapped people. At this time, one armed man asked, \u201cYoon Sangho-ssi, who is this?\u201d\u201cAh, he is one of my coworkers. We met by chance.\u201d\u201cHrmm\u2026 a wanderer? No one from a group is accepted. Do you know?\u201dDeputy Yoon nodded lightly and the man passed by us.\u00a0I looked at the man and asked,\u00a0\u201cWho is this person?\u201d\u201cThe manager of a \u2018coin farm\u2019.\u201d\u201cCoin farm?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Dokja-ssi doesn\u2019t know.\u201dFor a moment, a dismal expression appeared on Deputy Yoon\u2019s face.Coin farm\u2026 that reminded me of something.\u00a0But these guys already started it?\u201cLook here.\u201dThere were two people trapped in cages placed at regular intervals, like it was a zoo or police station. The wanderers around them screamed with excitement.\u201cHey! Are you kidding me? Fight harder! Who will give you coins if you look like this?\u201dInside the cage, two people were fighting each other. Blood splashed, eyes were pulled out and a man with guts hanging out cried out like an animal.[The constellation who likes the Colosseum is delighted.]I looked closely and there were several such cages.\u00a0Not all of the cages contained fighting.There was one cage with a naked woman and several men inside, while another cage contained a lone woman, like the men had already finished with her. I could hear pained moans and cries from all corners.Outside the cages, the wanderers holding their penises were laughing.\u201cHey, how are you? Good? Come out quickly!\u201d\u201cNext is my turn you bastard!\u201d[The constellation who likes excitement is delighted.]Deputy Yoon opened his mouth.\u201cIn the game industry, consumers were the king. In Mino Soft, the president was the king. Dokja-ssi, who is the king in this new world?\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you depending on the sponsorship of the constellations?\u201d\u201cYes. Sometimes there are crazy constellations like this. The most stimulating the sight, the more coins that the constellations will give. It is like the star balloons. We get coins from these people and in return, we provide them with food to survive.\u201d (TL: Star balloons are the way of donating on Korean video streaming sites)Deputy Yoon threw a chocolate bar into one cage.\u00a0The woman behind bars cried out and grabbed for it.There were those in the world who first identified the system and figured out how to exploit it. The \u2018coin farm\u2019 was the structure that those who first understood the world devised in order to take advantage of the system.\u201cI see people from our company\u2026\u201d\u201cThey were from our company.\u201dI realized for certain after hearing his cold tone.\u00a0The \u2018Deputy Yoon\u2019 that I knew from Mino Soft, he didn\u2019t exist in this world anymore.\u201cHey! There are new slaves!

She was a writer so she might have a management or publishing company nearby.\u201cAren\u2019t you quite good looking? Hey, you haven\u2019t touched her already have you?\u201d\u201cNo. I know that the constellations are all gathered here.\u201d[A constellation who likes obscenity is excited.][A few constellations have eyes that are shining in a lascivious manner.]White underwear was revealed by Han Sooyoung\u2019s torn jeans. There were men already playing rock paper scissors.I stared at Han Sooyoung beyond the bars.\u00a0No matter how I looked, there were no signs that anything happened.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.This woman would be a hindrance if she was left alive.\u00a0She was the one who knew the most about this world, apart from me.The story had completely changed from the third or fourth regression from the first quarter of the story and the knowledge she had might be obsolete, but\u2026The moment I thought this, I shuddered with disgust at myself.\u2026Why was I worrying about this?Killing someone because they would be dangerous in the future.\u00a0Who should I save because they would be useful in the future?I wasn\u2019t Yoo Jonghyuk to be thinking about these things.\u201cDo you want to do it Dokja-ssi?\u201dDeputy Yoon laughed as he saw me staring intently.\u00a0It was a expression that said \u2018I can help you\u2019.\u201cIf you promise me one thing, I will let Dokja-ssi do her first. How about it?\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you want me to promise?\u201d\u201cYou have a group, right? Please introduce me to Dokja-ssi\u2019s group. We will soon start expanding our forces. Looking at Dokja-ssi\u2019s items\u2026 it is a pretty big group?\u201dI stared at Deputy Yoon and said,\u00a0\u201cI can introduce you if you like. But I want you to stop this.\u201d\u201cHuh? Haha, Dokja-ssi. What does that mean?\u201d\u201cLet that woman go.\u201dDeputy Yoon\u2019s eyebrows twitched because he knew it wasn\u2019t a joke.\u201cHmm\u2026Dokja-ssi. What is wrong with treating people like this? If you have survived to this point, don\u2019t you already know?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI have been watching Dokja-ssi for a long time. I knew that if it was Dokja-ssi, you could survive anywhere.\u201dThere was a strange ridicule in Deputy Yoon\u2019s expression.\u201cAren\u2019t you always reading web novels alone? You always commute to work in a gloomy fashion. Sometimes you would talk to me and a few other colleagues. They were good people like Yoo Sangah-ssi.\u201d\u201cWhat does that have to do with this?\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi is enjoying the situation right now. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dEnjoying it?\u00a0It was like aiming a dagger at my heart from a completely different angle.Deputy Yoon grabbed my shoulders.\u201cI am also like Dokja-ssi. We are on the same QA team. I heard the same nagging every time and lived with their contempt. Do you remember what the other departments called us? The training dummy team. We are cheap people who don\u2019t have any specs. We just test games.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi. Those people who are trapped right now, don\u2019t you know who they really are? Look carefully. They are the scum who ignored us.\u201dMy vision broadened and the screams of people could be heard.\u00a0Looking closer, I did recognize them.Many of the people trapped behind bars were those I knew from Mino Soft.\u00a0There were people I didn\u2019t know very well, people who didn\u2019t know me or who didn\u2019t care.\u201cIt is over now. The finance team, the planning team, none of that matters. The best ones in the world right now are our QA team. Haha. Dokja-ssi, shouldn\u2019t you know from testing bugs? This world is a game. A game with bugs. There are too many loopholes that I can take advantage of.\u201dNumerous messages from constellations were heard in my head.The messages that wanted a more stimulating, more lascivious, more decadent story quietly overlapped with Deputy Yoon\u2019s face.Sometimes inferiority turned people into monsters.\u201cThere is nothing to be afraid of. This world is a game that exists for us! Do you know how many coins my group earns a day with this?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cIt is 5,000 coins a day. 5,000 coins\u2026 can you imagine? We don\u2019t do the scenarios and we get 5,000 coins. It is 5,000 coins just from making people fight and mate. It is the same as the planning team taking cash items. Don\u2019t you know what this means?\u201dI saw men approaching Han Sooyoung one by one.\u00a0I slowly breathed out.\u00a0So far, I showed courtesy to the colleague who once shared a rooftop with me by listening to his story.I removed Deputy Yoon\u2019s hand from my shoulder and opened my mouth.\u00a0\u201cIf you want to make coins, there is a better way.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0Deputy Yoon turned red.\u00a0\u201cDid Dokja-ssi also find a bug? What is it?\u201d\u201cThe principle is the same as a coin farm. Stimulate the constellations.\u201d\u201cOho, there is something more stimulating than this? Is that possible?\u201d\u201cYes, it is. Would you like me to let you know?\u201d\u201cIt would be good if you share the know-how!\u201d\u201cThe constellations really like\u2026\u2019[Blade of Faith is activated!]\u201c\u2026This.\u201dThere was the sound of the bars being cut apart. I swung my blade indiscriminately towards the wanderers surrounding the cage. I cut the Achilles tendon of those running away.The knees of those who weren\u2019t prepared for resistance became twisted.\u201cAaaaack! What is with this bastard?\u201d\u201cMy leg! My leg!\u201dI kept swinging my sword amidst the rising blood.\u201cSomething like this.\u201dI cut off the hands harassing a member of the human resources department then the arms of a man trying to take off Han Sooyoung\u2019s shirt.\u201cThis is also good.\u201dBlood splattered onto my cheek. I quietly wiped the blood and continued cutting at arms and legs. Then Deputy Yoon\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cW-What are you doing? What is this?\u201d\u201cThank you for the story.\u201dI turned to look at Deputy Yoon.\u201cI created a situation that the constellations really like because of you.\u201dWith just two knives, none of the men who entered Han Sooyoung\u2019s cage could do anything against me.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is pleased with your judgment.][The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is snorting from the relentless punishment.][Many of the constellations who dislike the atrocities of some constellations are greatly satisfied with your judgment.][8,000 coins have been sponsored.]Deputy Yoon turned white and flopped to the ground.I laughed at him.\u201cWhy bother creating something like the coin farm? It is easy to earn money.\u201d\u201c\u2026Y-You son of a bitch!\u201dThere was a large number of wanderers. In an instant, approximately 20 wanderers surrounded me.It was an ambiguous number that might make me violate the principle of \u2018no killing\u2019 but I wasn\u2019t overly concerned. I just had to get out of here.I retreated a bit while hugging Han Sooyoung\u2019s light body.\u00a0Suddenly, her eyes flashed open and she asked,\u00a0\u201c\u2026Why did you save me?\u201d\u201cWere you awake? Then get up.\u201dHan Sooyoung\u2019s voice was weak.\u201cIf you save me, won\u2019t the constellations in your channel run away? Don\u2019t you know what the constellation\u2019s hate most?\u201d\u201cThere are some who like it.\u201d[The constellation who has been waiting for a harem carefully puts both hands together.][The constellation who likes \u2018enemies turning into allies\u2019 is delighted.]Han Sooyoung frowned.\u201cNow this is a cliche. Right? The moment that the woman is about to be raped, the hero will rescue her. Why are you acting like this despite saying that you dislike cliches?\u201d\u201cYou are mistaken about two things.\u201dI started while lightly cutting a wanderer\u2019s legs.\u201cOne, I\u2019m not a hero. And two\u2026\u201d[You have saved a life.][Your karma points have increased by one.][Current karma points: 14/100]Karma points were gained when the system determined that a person had been \u2018saved.\u2019\u00a0In other words, if I left it alone, it was likely Han Sooyoung would\u2019ve died.\u201cYou\u2019re not a woman.\u201d\u201c\u2026Put me down!\u201dI threw her to the ground without hesitation.Han Sooyoung shouted,\u00a0\u201cYou really put me down?\u201d\u201cYou fight as well.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWe will fight together. Don\u2019t you like cliches?\u201d\u201cNo matter how much I like cliches, isn\u2019t it really cliche to fight on the same side as an enemy?\u201dShe grumbled but we were quite well matched. I cut the legs of the approaching wanderers while Han Sooyoung followed me and stopped their breathing. We took their lives slowly and carefully until only a few survivors were left.The terrified wanderers started to flee the coin farm.\u201cThis is a complete profit.\u201dI looked at the coins that I got from the wanderers while Han Sooyoung staggered with a smile.[You have acquired 18,400 coins.]Her contribution wasn\u2019t as high as mine but she would\u2019ve got a decent amount of coins. I didn\u2019t get as much coins as I would\u2019ve without Han Sooyoung present but I decided to think of it as a tip.I looked in front to where Deputy \u00a0Yoon was still sitting on the ground.\u201cHaha\u2026 psychopath. I thought you would be like this. I should\u2019ve known when I heard the rumour\u2026\u2019\u201cSick jerk. You are too talkative.\u201dHan Sooyoung stabbed Deputy Yoon in the neck. Blood spurted from Deputy Yoon\u2019s neck and the light in his eyes died.Another person who remembered Kim Dokja in reality disappeared.Han Sooyoung saw me watching and grumbled.\u00a0\u201c\u2026What is with your expression? Are you sorry that this jerk is dead?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen why did you keep listening to him?\u201dI was a bit surprised because I didn\u2019t expect these words to emerge from Han Sooyoung\u2019s mouth.\u201cYou were just listening to this guy\u2019s bullshit. Why? The constellations don\u2019t like frustrating things.\u201dI listened blankly to her words before smiling.What was this?\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to know but it is better to listen to this bullshit moderately in order to get more coins when they are killed. There is no refreshing feeling without being frustrated first.\u201d\u201cNo? Dokja\u2026 no, don\u2019t the constellations prefer to kill right away? What do you know when you aren\u2019t a writer?\u201d\u201cI know very well. I am a reader.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026!\u201dI ignored Han Sooyoung and rummaged through the items that had dropped. Most of it was garbage but there was a suit that I could wear.[Old Gentleman\u2019s Close Combat Suit]It was a B-grade item and only slightly improved defense but it was better than not wearing it.

If it fell here then I had to obtain it.Once I got a secondary battery\u2026[You have saved a life.][Your karma points have increased by one.][Current karma points: 25/100]One or two people approached. They were all those who had been stuck behind bars.Colour returned to the faces of some people who remembered my face.I raised my hand before they could speak.\u201cI can\u2019t help you now. Take care of your own lives.\u201dFaint despair filled their eyes but it wasn\u2019t a situation where I could help. It seemed cold but in the end, I had saved their lives.\u201cPick up the items in moderation and then go to Chungmuro if you can afford it. There might be some people who can help you there.\u201dBefore I finished speaking, people started picking up the items that had fallen. Their eyes were blazing again as they hoped for survival.Watching them, I understood why the dokkaebi brought me here.\u201cThat is mine!

Perhaps the dokkaebis of the Seoul Dome were in a meeting right now.They might be saying something like, \u201cThis edition is ruined anyway so sell a lot of coin products\u2026\u201dThe next moment, the \u2018Exchange\u2019 window and \u2018Dokkaebi Bag\u2019 window opened at the same time.This brat, he didn\u2019t have time to send a message?[Many constellations are dissatisfied with the sudden advertisements.]Furthermore, he didn\u2019t forget to play the advertisements.\u00a0I opened up the sales history on the Exchange first.[The item \u2018Fire Dragon\u2019s Scales\u2019 has been sold for 8,000 coins.][The item \u2018Fire Dragon\u2019s Bones\u2019 has been sold for 5,000 coins.]Unexpectedly, there was someone who bought these expensive items.The items that weren\u2019t meant for sale were also sold.[The item \u2018Fire Dragon\u2019s Bones\u2019 has been sold for 22,222 coins.]\u2026The items that I had stored on the Exchange were sold.\u00a0Someone must be desperate for the fire dragon\u2019s bones.\u00a0If I knew this, I would\u2019ve set the price as 99,999.The incarnations that possessed such power at present were Anna Croft, Ranveer Khan of India and China\u2019s Feihu\u2026 in any case, that person was ignorant.I opened the Dokkaebi Bag and bought some items that I needed.

If it wasn\u2019t for you\u2026 do you know how hard I prepared those apostles only for them to be eliminated? If I was sitting on the throne, I would\u2019ve been prepared for the next scenario by now\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you sat on the throne, Seoul would\u2019ve perished.\u201d[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that your words are true.]Han Sooyoung frowned.\u00a0\u201cWhy does the skill keep breaking?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t broken.

Where did you get off? Why do you know this when I don\u2019t?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not someone who got off.\u201d[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that your words are true.]Han Sooyoung was extremely shocked and managed to squeeze out a question after a moment.\u201cYou\u2026how far did you read in Ways of Survival?\u201d\u201cYour three questions are over.\u201d\u201cThis is the most important question!\u201d\u00a0Han Sooyoung\u2019s chin trembled.\u00a0\u201cNo way\u2026 right? You\u2026 there can\u2019t be such a crazy guy\u2026 yes, it is unlikely\u2026\u201dDa da da da!Then something that sounded like horse hooves were hard in the distance.I told the muttering Han Sooyoung to be silent and we quickly fled to the rear of a nearby building.\u00a0Something was approaching.It was in the form of a human\u2026?\u00a0I used Character List on the people rushing towards me in the cloud of dust.[The information of this person can\u2019t be read in \u2018Character List.\u2019][This person isn\u2019t registered in \u2018Character List.\u2019]Looking closely, I could see that all the people running had fur sprouting from their whole body.Their faces were human but their bodies were monster-like and twice as big as a human. They seemed like bipedal wolves.Looking closely, one monster in the lead was holding a man by the neck.\u00a0It was the biggest of the monsters.Grrr\u2026.\u00a0\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\u201cT-This area! The coin farm\u2026\u201dThere was a sound and the man\u2019s head was blown away. He was one of the wanderers who had been in front of Mino Soft. The monsters rushed eagerly and started eating the man\u2019s body.I think I knew what these monsters were.Han Sooyoung realized something and muttered,\u00a0\u201c\u2026The outside species?\u201dWanderers had their own ways of survival. There were those who still existed as humans and made coin farms, while others gave up on being human and walked the path of a new species.The outside species had limits but because they gave up on their humanity, they could grow faster than others in the beginning to mid part of the story.Maybe these guys were the werewolves\u2026\u201c\u2026They gained the power of the meteorite.\u201dRight now, it was only the fifth scenario. At the current time, the only way people could evolve into werewolves was by using the power of the meteorite. The wanderers had already got their hands on the meteorite that fell in Seochu-gu.Han Sooyoung opened her mouth.\u00a0\u201cI know him. That bastard, he is someone who stopped reading.\u201d\u201c\u2026How do you know?\u201d\u201cI can see it. It is the privilege as the last person who got off the novel.\u201d\u201cPrivilege?\u201d\u201cI can read the information and attributes of those who stopped reading.\u201d\u00a0She spoke in a slightly boasting tone.Speaking of which, I remembered a story that I heard from Jung Minseob.Shortly after the scenarios began, the First Apostle came to them. This would be explained if Han Sooyoung had the ability to find those who stopped reading. Then she used her Avatar ability to appear before them.Han Sooyoung kept speaking.\u201cThat\u2019s why I doubted your identity. A guy who can\u2019t be read by my skill\u2026\u201dHan Sooyoung stared at me before looking back at the outside species.\u201cAt that time, there were a few people who refused my offer. That wanderer was one of them. I thought it wasn\u2019t a big deal since most of them would die early\u2026\u201d\u201cWho is that guy?\u201d\u201cHe is Song Minwoo.\u201dSong Minwoo?\u00a0It definitely wasn\u2019t the name of a character.\u00a0Yet I had heard the name somewhere\u2026[The 6th grade outside species \u2018Werewolf Song Minwoo\u2019 is searching the surroundings.]I could see the face of the person in the distance.\u00a0Ah\u2026perhaps.A recent memory came to mind. It was the dream I had a few hours ago. I remembered my days in high school and the gangsters who bullied me. Many years had passed but his facial expression seemed to fit. No matter how much time passed, I couldn\u2019t forget that name on the name badge.Song Minwoo\u2026 it must be him.\u00a0But that bastard was someone \u2018who got off?\u2019\u00a0That gangster read a novel?\u201cWhere did he get off?\u201d\u201cThat guy\u2026 he was a bit strange.

What are you doing?\u201dAn angry voice was heard.\u00a0As I cleared away the pile of stones, the angry Han Sooyoung blocked my way.Her dozens of avatars were dealing with Song Minwoo and the werewolves in the corridors of the building. Blood was flowing from Han Sooyoung\u2019s nose and her blood vessels popped out as she struggled.It was because Han Sooyoung was squeezing out every drop of her already low magic power to exert this strength.\u201cI believed in you but what are you doing now?\u201dI slowly raised myself while feeling a sharp pain in my bones.

What is this?\u201dHan Sooyoung gave a terrible scream and shook.\u00a0I could tell the messages that were appearing in her head.\u00a0Perhaps they would be messages like this:[The 6th grade outside species \u2018Song Minwoo\u2019 has been killed and the demon king \u2018Andras\u2019 has noticed the murderer\u2019s presence.[The demon king Andras will remember the one who dealt the final blow.][The demon king Andras will search for the one who dealt the final blow.][Final Blow: \u00a0Han Sooyoung]Han Sooyoung looked at me with a pale face and I laughed.\u201cI told you that you would regret it.\u201dSong Minwoo was a member of the 72nd demon king, Andras\u2019 household.***The 72nd demon king.The constellations weren\u2019t the only strong ones among the Star Stream.There were some strong people who refused to be subscribes to the heavens and travelled around planets. One of these superpowers was the \u2018demon kings.\u2019\u201cYou are a really bad jerk.\u201dThe demon kings sought their own \u2018households\u2019, just like the constellations chose incarnations. Corrupted incarnations could choose to join the household of a demon king.The werewolf was one of his symbols and was located at the bottom of the 72nd demon king Andras\u2019 caste.It was due to Andras\u2019 blessing that Song Minwoo had the Physical Regeneration ability.Han Sooyoung stuttered out,\u00a0\u201cH-How can I\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Some people I know were cursed by a demon king like you but they didn\u2019t die right away.\u201d\u201cWhy are you saying it now?\u201dCome to think of it, Han Myungoh who was cursed by the demon king, Asmodeus\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what happened to him. Was he still alive?\u201cI think it is good. Andras isn\u2019t a very high ranking demon king. If you are enemies with a demon king, you will get the favour of the absolute good constellations and get more donations. It is a good thing.\u201d\u201cWill the archangels care? Besides, I don\u2019t get along with sponsors and angels!\u201dWhy? Was it also a demon king?\u00a0I couldn\u2019t help thinking so when I suddenly closed my mouth.\u2026What did she just say?\u201cYou don\u2019t get along with sponsors and angels?\u201dHan Sooyoung noticed my gaze and cursed.\u201cDamn, my damn mouth\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you not have a sponsor?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t impossible. I also had no sponsor.\u00a0In fact, in the first scenario, many of the survivors wouldn\u2019t get sponsors. To be precise, they didn\u2019t have any choices.However, it was unexpected that a strong person like Han Sooyoung had no sponsor.\u201cI didn\u2019t choose one. Isn\u2019t it strange to choose from the beginning? I can only pick once.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s right.\u201dIf the Sponsor Selection could be postponed, it was better to postpone it.There were many good constellations and depended on how the person acted in a scenario, they could literally go from a \u2018turd to a Mercedes.\u2019The Sponsor Selection occurred once after the first scenario and were regularly implemented before the \u2018disaster scenarios\u2019 occurred.The fifth scenario was a \u2018disaster scenario\u2019 so Han Sooyoung would be able to participate in the upcoming second round of the Sponsor Selection.I raised my hand and asked,\u00a0\u201cWho will you choose? Is there a constellation you are thinking about?\u201dHan Sooyoung made a confident expression at my words.\u00a0\u201cWon\u2019t you be surprised when you find out? They are already interested in me.\u201d\u201cWho is it?\u201dWas it perhaps the Great Sage the Equal of Heaven?\u201cHave you heard of the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon?\u201d\u2026The black flame dragon?[The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 is looking at your reaction.]I hesitated for a moment before replying,\u00a0\u201cAh, yes. He is a good sponsor.\u201dThe Abyssal Black Flame Dragon was the sponsor of the Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon in the original novel. The Delusional Demon was one of the best fights along with the Steel Sword, so it wasn\u2019t a bad choice.[The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 is looking at you with a complicated gaze.]This guy wasn\u2019t interested in me anymore.Han Sooyoung\u2019s eyebrows twitched at my nonchalant tone.\u00a0\u201cWhat is with this sour expression? Who is your sponsor?\u201d\u201cNo, it is nothing. I was just feeling envious.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cReally.\u201d[The character \u2018Han Sooyoung\u2019 has used \u2018Lie Detection Lv. 1\u2019.][The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that the statement is false]\u201cIs this real?\u201dI didn\u2019t care about the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon.\u00a0I just wanted her to get a sponsor.\u00a0Han Sooyoung and this thug matched very well.[The constellation who likes harems is cheering on you and Han Sooyoung.][500 coins have been sponsored.]Han Sooyoung\u2019s expression distorted like she heard the same message as me.\u201cWhat is this again\u2026?\u201dUnfortunately, the wish of the harem constellation wouldn\u2019t come true.\u00a0Han Sooyoung and I would only be together for the next 10 days.There was a moment of cooperation but it didn\u2019t change that she was a threatening enemy.\u201cIt looks like we\u2019ve arrived.\u201dAfter a while, we reached the place that was probably the base of the werewolves.It was near a broadcasting station. There was a bloody smell coming from the narrow forest of buildings. I heard the cries of the werewolves and people in the distance, like a battle was going on. Han Sooyoung said,\u00a0\u201cIt seems that we are a bit late. Is there a preceding visitor?\u201dI didn\u2019t seen any werewolves moving around as guards.\u00a0Once we entered a bit further, a coin farmer that was bigger than Director Yoon\u2019s one was installed.The coin farms were the exclusive property of the destroyed world.\u00a0I was tired of facing these sights all the time.It seemed like the coin harvest was over because there were no surviving people behind bars.Han Sooyoung was moving ahead when she suddenly grabbed her nose.\u201cYuck, what is this?\u201dAs we headed through the imprisonment area to the residence of the werewolves, a more horrifying sight awaited us. Severed human thighs were hanging from rubber bands. It was like pork in a butcher\u2019s shop, making the purpose obvious.[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 has offset your emotional trauma.]I read these scenes in the text but this was my first time actually seeing them.\u00a0There was a fixed way for humans to evolve into an outside species.Cannibalism\u00a0In other words, to eat their own people.Han Sooyoung cursed,\u00a0\u201cYou fucking scum\u2026\u201dMost outside species evolved accidentally. Those who couldn\u2019t clear the \u2018find food\u2019 sub scenario usually walked this path. Once they ate a person, they couldn\u2019t stop. Those who changed species would no longer feel guilty about killing humans.I stated, \u201cYou look upset when you see this.\u201d\u201cOf course. Who wouldn\u2019t be upset?\u201d\u201cThe other prophets said you want to use your information to control the world.\u201d\u201cWho said that?\u201d\u00a0Han Sooyoung sneered and added,\u00a0\u201cIt is just as absurd as you calling me a plagiarist.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWorld domination? It would be good. But my first goal is to prevent the destruction. Why else did I collect the apostles?\u201d\u201cThe apostles were all trash.\u201d\u201cThey were originally trash? Is that my fault?\u201dTang! Tang! Tang! Tang!We reflexively held our breaths.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0There was a loud sound from in front of us. I would hear the sound of flesh exploding.Tatang!No matter how I thought about it, this was the sound of gunshots.\u00a0Wasn\u2019t the army already wiped out?We ran towards the building towards the gunshots.\u00a0Even if the army was still intact, it was ridiculous to deal with a werewolf with guns. But the sight in front of me changed the story.Bodies of werewolves were piled up in front of me like a mountain.\u00a0All of the bodies had bullet wounds. Han Sooyoung and I talked almost simultaneously.\u201cAttribute bullets.\u201d\u201cA bullet with the divine attribute?\u201dI saw some people pointing guns in the distance.\u00a0They were armed with modern rifles and unusually, they were all wearing prison uniforms.Han Sooyoung nervously grabbed my collar.\u00a0\u201cHey, do you remember me telling you that there was someone like you in Sondaemun Prison?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThey are her forces.\u201dHan Sooyoung was pointing to a woman wearing a mask.\u00a0It would be hard to know the sex if it wasn\u2019t for the long hair hanging down, covering most of the body including the face.\u201cShe is the leader. It is obvious that she is a reader but I don\u2019t have any information on her.\u201dI see. They were from Seodaemun Prison\u2026\u00a0Then why wasn\u2019t this force visible during the struggle for the throne?Han Sooyoung opened her mouth while looking at the mountain of werewolf corpses.\u201cThey are also wanderers. They are quite powerful wanderers\u2026 the most powerful wanderers I know.\u201dA woman with a gun headed straight to this side.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t the leader that Han Sooyoung pointed out.I pulled out Unbroken Faith while Han Sooyoung prepared Avatar. The gun of the woman approaching us moved.She leaned back and her muzzled headed to one of the mountain of werewolf corpses.Dududududu!The dead bullets collapsed from the bullets.\u00a0Then something hidden under the bodies were revealed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThis is?\u201dThere was a glowing stone that was 2m in length and height.\u00a0It was one of the meteorites I needed to prevent the \u2018disaster.\u2019The yellow meteorite was here.\u00a0This meteorite was also the source of the werewolves\u2019 strength.The woman gazed at the meteorite before slowly turning to me.\u201cAre you Kim Dokja?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How?I was a bit embarrassed but I maintained my composure as I looked at the woman.\u201cYou must be mistaken. My name is Yoo Jonghyuk. Kim Dokja is the name of the guy I hate the most.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yoo Jonghyuk?\u201d\u201cYes. So tell your leader not to talk nonsense. \u00a0Just tell her, even if you\u2019re not sure what I mean.\u201dI looked to the side and saw Han Sooyoung watching me with an absurd expression. I winked at her. If it was Han Sooyoung, she would know what to do from now on. The woman opened her mouth.\u201cI already know that you are Kim Dokja. Stop the unnecessary lies.\u201d[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that the statement is true.]Han Sooyoung nodded towards me.\u00a0This woman came because she knew for certain who I was.\u201cThe king said that she will entrust this meteorite to you.\u201dIt was unexpected.\u00a0She knew me and now she was giving me the meteorite\u2026\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cWe are the people of the Wanderer King.\u201d\u201cThat woman over there is your king?\u201dThe woman nodded.\u00a0I looked at the tall masked woman in the distance. Looking closely, I felt a sense of deja vu. But there was something strange.\u201cKing\u2026 You don\u2019t seem to have a flag?\u201d\u201cThe king doesn\u2019t dwell on such things.\u201d\u2026What was with this answer?\u00a0The woman continued speaking.\u00a0\u201cThe king said that we will take care of the disaster in the north. But she will leave the other four disasters to you.\u201dBefore I could ask anything, the woman turned and left like her words were over.Han Sooyoung shouted,\u00a0\u201cHey! What are you suddenly saying? Shouldn\u2019t you explain it before you go?\u201dDespite the shouts, the woman kept walking away with turning back.\u00a0Han Sooyoung looked at me and asked,\u00a0\u201cWhat is this\u2026 do you know that woman?\u201d\u201cHow can that be?\u201dI quietly activated Character List.[This person isn\u2019t registered in \u2018Character List.\u2019][You can check the information of the person by updating Character List.

(Jeon Woochi was a taoist sorceror during the Joseon Dynasty.\u00a0Wiki Link:)In addition, she had the fairly good attribute of Officer of Justice, although it was less than the \u2018judge.\u2019If the subordinate was this good, what was the king like?\u00a0I immediately looked at the tall woman.[The information of this person can\u2019t be read in \u2018Character List.\u2019][This person isn\u2019t registered in \u2018Character List.\u2019]The moment I met the gaze of the woman in the mask, a stinging pain flashed through my head.I reflexively looked away from the woman.\u00a0My heart beat quickly.The Fourth Wall instinctively shook.The woman caused an even greater shaking than Song Minwoo. Despite having Self-rationalization, I didn\u2019t want to take the risk because I wasn\u2019t sure of the stigma\u2019s performance.Han Sooyoung asked me anxiously,\u00a0\u201cHey, what is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Never mind.\u201dThe Fourth Wall responded to people who had an important influence on me in real life.In other words, that woman was someone I knew.\u00a0But there was only one person in this world who gave me a bigger trauma than Song Minwoo.I see\u2026 As expected, she survived.\u00a0However, I didn\u2019t expect her to be in Seoul.It was why she was able to make a large force and why they were wearing prison uniforms.\u00a0It was convincing if it was that person.The wanderers soon began to move.They aligned themselves and headed back the way they came. It was a march with no hesitation. A loyalty could be felt from the group.The leader moved at the forefront of the group.A crown like the Tyrant King, a woman who was different from the King of Beauty.I looked at the ruins that they moved through. There were the broken coin farms and the survivors they spared. They had placed blankets and necessities beside the survivors. The survivors watched the leaving wanderers with awe-filled eyes.I had forgotten.A person didn\u2019t need a flag or to sit on the throne to become king.\u00a0In this kingless world, there was still a king.***After a while, I examined the yellow meteorite they left behind.A yellow meteorite.The meteorite, also called the moon stone, was usually a star pierce that hovered in other dimensions.It was truly the same as I read in the novel.It was from the exhilarating magic power felt when I touched it, the faint light from the opaque interior and the white stripes all over the meteorite. The yellow meteorite clearly had the power to counter the disaster.Then a system message was heard.[The \u2018moon stone\u2019 wants to provide you with a high level strength.]I refused the meteorite\u2019s offer and\u00a0the power returned to the meteorite.The moon stone basically had the power of the night and the outside species would receive this power. Perhaps the cannibals who received the power of the night were able to evolve into the outside species, the werewolves.[The moon stone\u2019 gives off a feeling of familiarity.]However, the real use of this meteorite wasn\u2019t simply to evolve the outside species. Even a few hundred werewolves couldn\u2019t prevent the future disasters.Of course, a few thousand would help but then another disaster would come from the high number of outside species and the power of the demon kings.\u201cI feel like a volunteer\u2026 Hey, did you find something?\u201dAs I was examining the meteorite, Han Sooyoung was taking care of the survivors lying nearby. It was a little unexpected but she was probably targeting coins.[The constellations of the Absolute Good system are touched by Han Sooyoung\u2019s good works.]In a place filled with the demon king\u2019s household, the dominations would be bigger than usual.Indeed, a human\u2019s double-sidedness was profound.Among the constellations of the Absolute Good system, there might be the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon. The second Sponsor Selection was coming up so Han Sooyoung would be looking at him. I looked around and said,\u201cThe avatars are useful.\u201dDozens of avatars were quickly organizing the surroundings. The corpses of the outside species were burned, while the terrible cages and human butcher stores were also demolished. She earned coins while getting a nosebleed\u2026Han Sooyoung wiped the blood and asked,\u00a0\u201cWhen are you going to tell me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about that.\u201dI realized her question wasn\u2019t about the meteorite.\u00a0\u201cAre you still worrying about that?\u201d\u201cHow can I not care?\u201dThere were two types of \u2018readers\u2019 that she didn\u2019t know about.\u00a0In addition, there seemed to be a connection between the two.\u00a0It was natural for Han Sooyoung who was the \u2018last to get off\u2019 to pay attention.\u201cWho knows?\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t you know?\u201d\u201cI only know the woman, the leader of the group.\u201d\u201cThe Wanderer King?\u201dI nodded and said,\u00a0\u201cThat person isn\u2019t someone who got off. To be precise, she never read the original.\u201d\u201cWhat? Then how does she know the contents of the plot?\u201d\u201cBy talking directly to me.\u201dHan Sooyoung looked like she had been hit in the back of the head with a hammer.\u00a0\u201cYou told others about the story? Why?\u201d\u201cI needed something to tell her when I met her.\u201d\u00a0I gave her a moment before continuing.\u00a0\u201cBecause I had nothing else to say to her.\u201dMaybe she sensed my dark mood, making Han Sooyoung hesitate as she was about to question me. She probably had a lot that she wanted to ask me. Who was the woman and what was her relationship with me?Han Sooyoung was silent for a while before speaking again.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know what your relationship with that woman is but is it okay to leave her alone? If there are more people besides us who knows the future\u2026\u201dI understood her concerns but it should be fine.\u00a0At the very least, that woman was a person with principles and she couldn\u2019t carelessly use the future information.I knocked on the moon stone and opened my mouth.\u201cRather, there is something more important. From now on, we will wake this up.\u201d\u201cWhat? This thing?\u201d\u00a0Han Sooyoung watched me like I was insane.\u00a0\u201cYou want to wake up the disaster?\u201d\u201cWhy are you so startled?

Do you really not know what will appear here when the scenario starts?\u201dHan Sooyoung stared at me before turning on her phone and reading her own novel.\u201cAh\u2026 This, perhaps\u2026\u201d\u201cHave you realized? You copied it well.\u201d\u201cShut up. But the main scenario hasn\u2019t opened yet. Is it okay to do this?

Of course, I didn\u2019t back down.[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]+[Character Information]Name: Lycaon IsparangAge: 371 years old.Constellation Support: Shadow of a Destroyed WorldPrivate Attribute: Noble Imyuntar (Hero), Humiliated Survivor (Rare)Exclusive Skills: Way of the Wind Lv. 9, Advanced Weapons Training Lv. 9, Roar of the Battlefield Lv. 8, Sage\u2019s Insight Lv. 4, Steel Skin Lv. 8, Acting Lv. 4\u2026Stigma: Destruction Delivery Lv. 1Overall Stats: Physique Lv. 75, Strength Lv. 75, Agility Lv. 75, Magic Power Lv. 75.Overall Evaluation: One of the five dominant species of the destroyed Chronos. After losing his world, he invested in the Star Stream and became a guide in the scenario. He is characterized by always looking at the world with eyes filled with remorse.+As expected, the hero of another world had great skills and stats.\u00a0The average stats was level 75.\u00a0He exceeded the current limit of the scenario.\u00a0He was the goal of many representatives.Lycaon\u2019s blue eyes looked down at me like I was interesting.\u201cYou are the ones who woke me up?\u201dI nodded.\u201cI see\u2026 Is it finally time? Congratulations on clearing the tutorial scenarios, warriors of this world.\u201dIt sounded like a tutorial.\u00a0It was funny how he imitated the dokkaebi for dramatic effect.There was no tutorial in this world.\u00a0Every scenario was an actual event and the dead couldn\u2019t come back again.\u00a0Then what type of tutorial existed?\u201cThose who are facing extinction. First, I deeply regret that \u2018disaster\u2019 has come to your world.\u201dLycaon spoke while looking up at the sky.He was looking at the Great Hall over Seoul, Korea.A huge vortex reminiscent of a black hole was gradually increasing its volume every moment. Lycaon would\u2019ve also seen the Great Hall on the day his world was destroyed.All guides in the scenarios were those who lost their homes to the scenarios.\u201cSince I am here, you can rest assured. I am a \u2018guide\u2019 to stop the destruction of this world. I will train you to prepare for the disaster and give you the necessary instructions. And\u2026\u201dIt came out quite hastily but he was good at reciting the words.\u00a0He probably got a manual grom a dokkaebi.Lycaon suddenly stopped talking.\u201c\u2026By the way, you are the only ones who woke me up?\u201d\u201cIt is just us.\u201d\u201cStrange. The fourth scenario isn\u2019t cleared? If it had been cleared properly, the five guides, including myself, would be hatched in the same place\u2026 Where is the owner of the Absolute Throne?\u201dHe was right. Originally, the five guides, including Lycaon, would gather as soon as the master of the Absolute Throne was born.I spoke to Lycaon.\u00a0\u201cWe have no king.\u201d\u201cThere is no king\u2026 did the master of the Absolute Throne die? No way. At present, there is no way to kill the master of the Absolute Throne.\u201dLycaon expressed his disbelief in a threatening manner.\u201cThere was no owner of the Absolute Throne from the beginning.\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cWe cleared the fourth scenario without getting the Absolute Throne.\u201dFlames appeared in Lycaon\u2019s eyes.\u201cAre you lying to me right now? Such a thing is impossible! The fourth scenario doesn\u2019t end until someone takes the throne.\u201d\u201cThere is also the method of destroying the Absolute Throne.\u201dLycaon\u2019s expression stiffened. He seemed to grasp my words and his eyes widened.\u201c\u2026Perhaps?\u201dThe embarrassment of such a noble hero was really worth seeing. His silver mane quivered as he looked closely at me.\u201cThe numerous constellations\u2026surely you didn\u2019t destroy the throne\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cHow could you do such a terrible thing?\u201dLycaon let out many curses that I couldn\u2019t hear properly. Han Sooyoung looked at the bellowing Lycaon and whispered to me,\u00a0\u201cHey, was it that serious? For you\u2026?\u201dHan Sooyoung also received Other World Interpreter and heard the conversation. Lycaon screamed before I could answer.\u201cWhy did you do that? Now there is no one in the world under the banner of that great god?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cAhh! The Star Stream constellations didn\u2019t care about Chronos! Now this world is ruined! Living things with less intelligence than a kobold should do their jobs!\u201dI felt scorn as I watched the despairing Lycaon.Yes, this was the essence of these guys.\u00a0On the surface, they were dispatched to help this world. However, they had a separate purpose that I would never let happen.\u201cPrince of the Imyuntar, Lycaon Isparang. It is too early to be frustrated.\u201dThe prideful prince of the Imyuntar immediately responded to the change in my attitude.He growled out angrily.\u00a0\u201cCheeky human. Show respect in front of a great species! You don\u2019t know the weight of your sin!\u201d\u201cLycaon, didn\u2019t you see anything when your world perished? The Imyuntar were the ruling species of Chronos, not Earth.\u201dLycaon\u2019s expression stiffened.\u00a0I didn\u2019t miss this gap and continued,\u00a0\u201cThere were five disasters that destroyed your world.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cThe southern continent of Chronos where you lived was destroyed by the dragon. Right?\u201dLycaon\u2019s eyes filled with disbelief.\u00a0\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d\u201cFire Dragon Igneel. The Disaster of Burning Hell. It is the name of the disaster that destroyed your world.\u201dThe small disaster that I killed, Lesser Igneel was originally a \u2018disaster.\u2019A single flame could turn a small city into a sea of fire and a single flap of its wings could destroy a lower species.The southern continent of Chronos was destroyed by him.\u00a0The fire dragon that woke up from a meteorite.Lycaon gritted his teeth.\u00a0\u201cYou are speaking like it is someone else\u2019s story. You will regret it. Pretty soon, your world will also struggle in that hot hellfire.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Igneel won\u2019t come down to this world.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI have already killed him. There will be no \u2018Burning Hell\u2019 disaster in this world.\u201dLycaon had a bemused expression, like he heard his home had been brought back.\u201cThat is the best joke I\u2019ve ever heard. Is there such a joke in this world? Is it fun to joke about the world that will soon cease to exist?\u201dWell\u2026 of course not.\u00a0I pulled out a blue coloured medallion.\u00a0Then like magic, Lycaon\u2019s laughter subsided.The Protection Symbol of the Imyuntar.\u00a0Lycaon\u2019s shaking hands reached out to take the medallion.\u201cW-Why\u2026 how do you have this\u2026?\u201dThe Protection Symbol of the Imyuntar was proof that a person had hunted a disaster dragon.\u201cLycaon of the Imyuntar. Pay respects to the protector.\u201dLycaon\u2019s body slowly fell. First his knees touched the ground, slowly followed by his head. There was a severe shaking of his eyes like he couldn\u2019t admit it.\u201cDo it properly.\u201dBefore long, his head touched the ground. He was over three metres tall so it wasn\u2019t until he fell down that his eyes were lower than mine. I looked down at Lycaon.This was the useful part of catching the fire dragon.Han Sooyoung wasn\u2019t able to grasp the situation yet and looked at Lycaon with confused eyes. I was almost killed by Han Sooyoung\u2019s brutality but she ended up making things easier.Lycaon spoke in a quivering voice.\u00a0\u201cGreat dragon hunter\u2026 With the benefit of hindsight, I would like to ask you to forgive my rudeness.\u201d\u201cMy name is Kim Dokja.\u201dOnce again, I thought that my name wasn\u2019t that great.\u00a0This would be a great scene if my name was Yoo Jonghyuk. I added a quick remark to diffuse the awkward atmosphere.\u201cLycaon. There is something I need you to do.\u201dLycaon carefully looked up.\u201d\u201cTeach me the Way of the Wind, which is the secret technique of your people.\u201dLycaon\u2019s eyes slowly became bigger.\u00a0\u00a0This was my purpose behind hatching Lycaon.The southern disaster of the fire dragon had disappeared so the first disaster in the fifth scenario would surely be the \u2018east disaster.\u2019In order to prevent the catastrophe in the east, I needed to gain the secret technique of the Imyuntar.Way of the Wind\u00a0It was the only answer to the disaster of the east, the \u2018Disaster of Questions.\u2019***An hour later, I explained the situation to Han Sooyoung who hadn\u2019t been able to follow the conversation.\u201cThen the medallion you got from killing the fire dragon is an important thing for them?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI still don\u2019t understand\u2026 the fire dragon you killed at that time was one of the disasters?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then in the fifth scenario, we have to prevent four instead of five disasters?\u201d\u201cYou seem to understand yet not understand?\u201dHan Sooyoung frowned.\u201cI still don\u2019t understand. Didn\u2019t you kill the \u2018Lesser Igneel?\u2019 Isn\u2019t he a deteriorated dragon so why is he the disaster? Is this also a development of Ways of Survival?\u201d\u201c\u2026Everything that hatches from a disaster meteor is a disaster. That guy came out instead of Igneel so Igneel won\u2019t appear in this disaster. In addition, Igneel didn\u2019t appear in the original. Igneel\u2019s hatchling came out. It is only the fifth scenario so how can something like that wake up already?\u201d\u201c\u2026You speak well. Are you a spokesman for Ways of Survival? Are you actually the writer?\u201dThe scenario difficulty was ridiculous but it was adjusted so that it could be cleared if people risked their lives.\u2026Of course, the adjustment was carefully controlled.The Lesser Igneel, the deteriorated version of the hatchling had annihilated the prophets, which could be called the elite troops at the time. Was that all? I was once killed by that dragon. If it wasn\u2019t for the King of No Killing, I wouldn\u2019t be standing here.If Lesser Igneel had been released into Seoul and continued to level up, Seoul would\u2019ve ended up the same as Lycaon\u2019s hometown.Of course, Han Sooyoung had no knowledge of such matters and was busy complaining.\u201cAnyway, aren\u2019t the disasters a bigger deal than I thought? I have a lot of trouble grasping the scale because of the way it was expressed in Ways of Survival\u2026\u201d\u201cWe were lucky with the fire dragon. The disasters that will come will be in their original state. Terrible beings will appear.\u201dIt was pleasant to see the expression of the plagiarist writer at the word \u2018original.\u2019\u201cThen what should we do?\u201d\u201cWe have to use that guy.\u201dI looked at Lycaon, who was preparing for the training in a distant place.Han Sooyoung asked,\u00a0\u201cHe looks strong. Do you want him to fight?\u201d\u201cThat guy is a coward. In addition, the guides are prohibited from fighting against disasters of another world. We have to take care of our work on our own.\u201dI heard Lycaon calling out to me.\u201cProtector, I am ready.\u201dProtector was the title for the owner of the medallion. I told him to call my name a few times but Lycaon didn\u2019t yield.\u201cFrom now on, I will teach you the secret technique of my clan, the Way of the Wind.\u201dWay of the Wind.\u00a0It was a hidden skill that allowed the user to use the wind like their own limbs.Among the other species, only those with the Protection Symbol of the Imyuntar could learn this skill.Yoo Jonghyuk was originally scheduled to obtain this but not this time. I couldn\u2019t give the strong person all the good skills.\u201cThen I will start.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFor the next three hours, I sweated hard to learn the skill.It would be nice if the system had a message like \u2018Would you like to learn the skill?\u2019 but this wasn\u2019t possible. It was only possible to gain the skill by learning it directly.I had read the novel so I was able to follow Lycaon\u2019s movements a little bit.\u00a0To be exact, I thought I was following it.Approximately one more hour passed. Lycaon hesitated before opening his mouth.\u00a0\u201cProtector. I\u2019m sorry to say this but\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I breathed roughly and looked up at the sky. All of a sudden, the Great Hall floating in the sky seemed bigger. It seemed to be mocking me.Lycaon looked at me and prepared for the kill.\u201cProtector\u2026 you don\u2019t have any qualities suited for Way of the Wind. No, to be honest, you don\u2019t have the qualities for almost every skill.\u201dIf this went wrong, the world might perish because of me.***A few more hours passed like this and then days went by.\u00a0There were eight days left until the start of the fifth scenario.I didn\u2019t give up and continued to learn Way of the Wind.\u00a0Of course, it wasn\u2019t possible.Grrr.\u00a0\u201cProtector, it is better to give up\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Why can\u2019t I learn it?\u201dHan Sooyoung giggled beside me and said,\u00a0\u201cWhy? It is because you have no talent.\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t possible.\u201d\u201cWhy not? You aren\u2019t the protagonist. Do you think that you became Yoo Jonghyuk because you have been doing a good job lately?\u201dMy chest was sore like I had been stabbed.\u00a0I spoke with a frown,\u00a0\u201cBut I understand everything in my head.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. Everyone thinks they can go to Seoul National University.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth.\u201dI remembered most of the enlightenment associated with Way of the Wind. I felt so frustrated one hour ago that I got a second battery from the survivors and read the text again.\u201cThere is a gale in the right hand and a storm in the left hand. The Way of the Wind will be opened when the straight lines and the curves meet.\u201d\u201cH-How\u2026 You really understand it!\u201dLycaon felt admiration from where he was listening to me.In fact, the words I just muttered was Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s enlightenment in Ways of Survival.\u00a0In Ways of Survival, Yoo Jonghyuk gained insight in a single \u2018phrase\u2019 followed by a Chinese character. He learned Way of the Wind in just 5 minutes.But it wasn\u2019t that simple and I had wasted two days already.\u201cHow can I do this?\u201d I grumbled.\u201cHuh? You just said it\u2026 there is no representation more accurate than that.\u201d\u201cNo, it was a metaphor.\u201d\u201cYour words weren\u2019t a metaphor.\u201dIt was enough to make me go crazy. This time the problem wasn\u2019t solved by the writer\u2019s description in Ways of Survival. It was because the explanation was just complete noise to me and the Fourth Wall was also useless at this moment. Fourth Wall gave me judgment and calmness but it didn\u2019t give me talent.I felt a little feverish as I spoke to Lycaon.\u00a0\u201cThen you should try this. One wind will meet another wind to form ying and yang. Once again, one wind will meet another wind to form the principles of negative and positive.\u201dYin and Yang was a concept from Earth but Lycaon understood it instantly.\u201cHow could you have gained such profound insight?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t just speak it, spread it directly through your body.\u201d\u201cSo it is like this.\u201dLycaon concentrated and winds from different directions started to form around him. The two winds swirled, adding a hot and cold energy to the wind.\u2026To be honest, I thought it was ridiculous.\u00a0He just heard it and could carry out the technique instantly?\u00a0Then why couldn\u2019t I do the same?My pride was provoked.\u201cThen how about this? \u2018Four winds meet and form a defense. Then another four winds are added, making it the Eight Trigrams. Therefore, wind is everywhere yet exists nowhere.\u2019 Can you do this as well?\u201dThis sentence was the enlightenment that Yoo Jonghyuk gained in the 9th round of regression. This time Lycaon made a puzzled expression. I spoke in a triumphant voice.\u201cYou can\u2019t? This is how I am feeling.\u201d\u201cPushov\u2026 no, Protector. I really appreciate it.\u201d\u2026What?[The 5th grade other world species \u2018Prince Lycaon of the Imyuntar\u2019 has received great enlightenment.]Lycaon suddenly turned and started practicing.[You have a great impact on the evolution of Prince Lycaon of the Imyuntar.][Lycaon of the Imyuntar feels a great appreciation towards you.][Some constellations from the ruined world \u2018Chronos\u2019 thanks you.][2,000 coins have been sponsored.]I finally figured out what was going on. That damn wolf gained enlightenment by hearing what I said.Han Sooyoung was laughing so hard that she was holding her belly.I felt belated frustration.\u00a0Maybe I knew Ways of Survival but I didn\u2019t know anything about myself.[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 admires your patience.][The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 is disappointed in your weakness.]Looking at the system messages appearing in the air, I thought about signing a contract with a sponsor.\u00a0Of course, it was impossible due to the contract with Bihyung.[So why did you break the throne? Fool.]I looked up and saw a transparent figure floating in the air.\u00a0I opened the dokkaebi communication.\u2018Is it okay to talk now? What about the intermediate dokkaebi?\u2019[He won\u2019t come for a while. He is being properly disciplined. He won\u2019t come before the fifth scenario opens. Ah, my channel also upgraded again. Hopefully I can reach the intermediate level next month. It is all thanks to you.]\u2018That\u2019s good.\u2019[Why don\u2019t you look happy? It is also good for you if I do well.]\u2018You will be busy when you reach intermediate level.\u2019Bihyung laughed at my words.[Brat, don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t know about other incarnations but won\u2019t I look after you? These days there are many intermediate dokkaebi at the Bureau but\u2026 it is noisy because some bastards are twisting their probabilities extensively.]I didn\u2019t need him to tell me who it was.[Oh, of course it isn\u2019t you.]It was completely Yoo Jonghyuk.In fact, Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s growth rate was impossible through any possibilities. He was growing at a rate that was close to a cheat.[There is one abnormally fasting growing guy and the Bureau can\u2019t touch him\u2026 I think his sponsor is probably a formidable guy.]Perhaps Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s \u2018possibilities\u2019 wouldn\u2019t be a problem in the future.In the end, the \u2018possibility\u2019 wasn\u2019t a problem if there was a constellation capable of that \u2018possibility.\u2019 And it was possible for Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s sponsor.[By the way, why don\u2019t you buy a growth package? I\u2019ll sell it for a cheap price if you buy it now. Aren\u2019t you suffering right now because you can\u2019t learn that skill? This package\u2026]\u2018I won\u2019t buy it. In any case, isn\u2019t the growth package only applicable to skills already learnt? Did you show up just to eat money?\u2019The growth package had a penalty when abused. It was why even the powerful Yoo Jonghyuk didn\u2019t use the growth package.[Sheesh, you knew\u2026?]Bihyung muttered with a dissatisfied expression.\u2018But it is time to buy something.\u2019[Coins Possessed: 62,372 C]I still had a lot of coins despite raising my stats due to selling the fire dragon parts.If I had 40,000 more coins, I would\u2019ve bought Sky Dragon Steps but I couldn\u2019t this time.Bihyung\u2019s face became rosy.[Oh, really? What do you want to buy?]\u2018Aren\u2019t you going to receive new coin items soon?\u2019[\u2026How do you know? Did you plant a mole?]\u2018It is natural since a new scenario will open soon. At that time, tell me. I\u2019ll buy it.\u2019[Hoh, you will\u2026]I turned off the dokkaebi communication. I didn\u2019t want to talk to him when there was nothing to say. I looked back and Lycaon was still gaining enlightenment. Han Sooyoung approached me and raised her chin.\u201cHey, what are you going to do now?\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still thinking.\u201d\u201cThen let me learn it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cOr let the other survivors learn it.\u201dI looked at the people around us.It was two days after the coin farms collapsed.\u00a0The rescued survivors were working together and caring for the other wounded.The atmosphere was quite different from the survivors of Deputy Yoon\u2019s coin farm. Perhaps Han Sooyoung\u2019s hypocrisy-filled good deeds had changed them.\u00a0It turned out that hypocrisy was a good thing.Han Sooyoung opened her mouth again.\u00a0\u201cIsn\u2019t it just learning Way of the Wind? Does it matter who learns it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Right, anyone can learn it.\u201d\u201cWhy do you insist on being the one to learn it? Are you trying to get the attention of the constellations alone?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t wrong, but it wasn\u2019t exactly right.\u201cOnly people with the protection medallion can learn Way of the Wind.\u201d\u201cThen give it to me.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t transferable.\u201d[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that the statement is true.]This woman really\u2026\u201cYou are the first person who is more suspicious than Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201d\u201cYou brought it up. This skill, Yoo Jonghyuk should\u2019ve originally learnt it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThen why do you have to go through this trouble? You can leave it to Yoo Jonghyuk. It isn\u2019t too late now so let\u2019s go find Yoo Jonghyuk. He is growing well. That guy would manage it somehow.\u201d\u201cYoo Jonghyuk doesn\u2019t listen to what other people will say.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tempt him.\u201dI stared at Han Sooyoung before looking away.\u00a0\u201cYoo Jonghyuk doesn\u2019t like the body of a child.\u201d\u201cAre you ignoring me now?\u201d\u201cBesides, there is also a problem in finding Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201dEven Yoo Jonghyuk couldn\u2019t learn Way of the Wind without the protection medallion.It meant the medallion needed to be taken from me, but ownership wouldn\u2019t be released until I died.In other words, Yoo Jonghyuk must kill me.\u00a0Besides, even if he had the medallion\u2026\u201cYou know that I beat him up pretty badly in the end. Once we meet, he will definitely try to kill me.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk flew from my punch filled with 100 strength. In the meantime, the eyes that wanted to tear me to pieces was still vivid.\u201c\u2026Well, he was really bold when he cut off my head.\u201d\u00a0Han Sooyoung stroked her neck as memories of Chungmuro Station surfaced.\u201cBesides, finding out where he is now\u2026\u201dAt this time, an uproar was heard in the distance.\u201cThere is someone injured. Please help!

It was clear that Bihyung had made a sub scenario to bring Yoo Jonghyuk over here.[Are you suspecting me? Is there evidence?]There was no evidence but I felt it in my heart.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is concerned with your judgment.][500 coins have been sponsored.]I felt a strong belief.Han Sooyoung whispered to me as I looked down at Yoo Jonghyuk with a dumb expression.\u00a0\u201c\u2026We found him. What are you going to do?\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t you save him? This jerk, he is the protagonist.\u201dOf course I had to save him.\u00a0However, if I saved this bastard, I would surely die.\u00a0Han Sooyoung looked scared that Yoo Jonghyuk would wake up straight away.\u201cDo you have anything that will restrain him?\u201d\u201cYoo Jonghyuk won\u2019t tolerate them.\u201d\u201cLock him up\u2026\u201d\u201cThen he will commit suicide.\u201d\u201cBut if he goes back\u2026 Damn, what will happen if he regresses?\u201dHan Sooyoung belatedly came to this realization.What would happen to this world if Yoo Jonghyuk went back?\u00a0It was one of my biggest challenges living in this world.\u201cWe have to stop it. Nobody knows what will happen.\u201dIt was right to assume the worst when things were unknown.\u00a0If I made a mistake and the world was reset, my existence would disappear.By the way\u2026 how did this jerk end up like this?I looked closely at him. There was a wound around the belly. All internal organs and ribs were broken. It felt like someone incredibly powerful had hit Yoo Jonghyuk in one blow\u2026At this moment, I stared blankly at my fist.\u00a0Perhaps?\u201cWhat is with that expression? Why is your face suddenly dark?\u201d\u201c\u2026It is nothing.\u201dAll of a sudden, I was convinced.\u00a0He was hit with a fist filled with 100 strength\u2026Then he had been like this for two days.\u00a0I felt sorry with the benefit of hindsight.\u00a0With this, it might not be possible to restore my relationship with Yoo Jonghyuk.As I slowly looked from his belly to his face, I took a few steps back because I got goosebumps.\u201c\u2026Shit.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk was staring at me with bloody and teary eyes.\u00a0His lips were moving and he was obviously saying something like \u2018Dead, Kim Dokja.\u2019I thought Han Sooyoung was beside me but she had run away as quickly as possible. I shouted towards Yoo Jonghyuk from a distance.\u201cHey! Can\u2019t you release your anger?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t it a fair fight? Didn\u2019t you try to kill me as well?\u201dYoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t change.\u00a0Dammit\u2026I had no choice. Yoo Jonghyuk had to survive here, even if he killed me. I might be able to stop the Disaster of Questions without Yoo Jonghyuk but I wouldn\u2019t be able to prevent the other disasters and the world would be destroyed.Why was the protagonist of Ways of Survival such a person?\u00a0The story would\u2019ve been easier of it was Lee Hyunsung or Jung Heewon.\u2026This wasn\u2019t the time for complaints.I decided to use a skill. It was obvious what he was thinking but I needed to check.[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint stage 2 has been activated!]At this moment, something amazing happened.\u300c Kim Dokja. \u300dMy eyes widened as I watched Yoo Jonghyuk.\u2026Did he just call out to me?\u300c You can hear my words.

I hesitated for a moment before approaching Yoo Jonghyuk. Yoo Jonghyuk didn\u2019t seem to have the power to fight me at all in this state. Besides\u2026 I didn\u2019t see any animosity towards me.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk. \u00a0Can you hear me?\u201dYoo Jonghyuk struggled to raise his eyelids, only to close them again.\u00a0It was strange.No matter how badly wounded he was, he would\u2019ve automatically triggered Recovery when he was hit. Then why was he still in this state?[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.][There is too much information about this person.

Yoo Jonghyuk was still one of the strongest incarnations in Seoul and his skills had grown compared to the last time I saw him.The problem was his abnormal status.Yoo Jonghyuk didn\u2019t have the skills Thousand Poisons Resistance or Immunity to Ten Thousand Poisons yet. Therefore, poison was currently one of Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s few weaknesses.He was like this because he was poisoned.I looked closer and saw that there were blue blood vessels all over his body.\u00a0It hadn\u2019t been long since he was poisoned.\u00a0Fortunately, he was still alive.But it was strange.\u00a0I knew of only one person who could infect Yoo Jonghyuk with Thousand Spirits Poison at this time\u2026A woman watching me in the distance asked,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2026 are you Kim Dokja-ssi?\u201dI nodded.\u00a0I looked at the woman who brought Yoo Jonghyuk here.\u201cHe was like this the whole time. He kept asking me to take him to Kim Dokja\u2026\u201dYoo Jonghyuk?I looked down at Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s face, which was more blue-tinged than before, and instantly had many thoughts. The terrified Han Sooyoung who had been fleeing came back.\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0Han Sooyoung poked my shoulder but I didn\u2019t answer.I struggled for a moment before speaking to Bihyung.\u2018Bihyung, open the Dokkaebi Bag.\u2019[Now do you understand? This wasn\u2019t my doing.]\u2018Open the bag.\u2019After confirming my remaining coins, I found a coin item that could cure Yoo Jonghyuk.He was affected by the THousand Spirits Poison so it couldn\u2019t be removed simply by eating the Ellain Forest Essence. I quickly turned on the text and checked some of the ingredients before purchasing items from the Dokkaebi Bag.[You have purchased one Midday Tryst.][You have purchased one Old Barbara Branch.][You have purchased two Putna Daltun Horns.][You have purchased one Detox Potato.][You have purchased two Aintern Temple\u2019s Purification Water.][You have purchased one Ellain Forest Essence.][A total of 7,370 coins are consumed.]It was an unexpected bleeding service.\u00a0I asked the survivors around me for a small bucket, lit the Magic Power Stove and poured the ingredients into it. Han Sooyoung asked,\u201cWhat are you going to make?\u201d\u201cAn antidote.\u201d\u201cDid you decide to save him?\u201dI nodded and replied,\u00a0\u201cThis bastard, he came to me deliberately.\u201d\u201cDeliberately? Why?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cDid he come to ask you for help? I don\u2019t think Yoo Jonghyuk would come all this way to kill you.\u201d\u201cThat is impossible for Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201d\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cI know. He is that type of bastard.\u201dI adjusted the flames of the stove.Fire blazed and the contents in the bucket started to boil. Based on the colour and form, it looked like food from the Death Valley goblins. It might seem terrible but this soup was an excellent antidote.Han Sooyoung placed her hands on her knees and stared at the terrible food.\u00a0\u201cBy the way, was Yoo Jonghyuk such a bad person in Ways of Survival?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cIt was a thought that I had. Didn\u2019t Yoo Jonghyuk save a lot of people and do good deeds? Of course, he is like a psychopath but isn\u2019t he moving for the people? He is fighting to save the world. I don\u2019t want to admit it because I am a bad person.\u201dWhen I thought about it, Han Sooyoung\u2019s words weren\u2019t completely wrong.\u00a0I laughed and said,\u00a0\u201cYour defense of Yoo Jonghyuk is energetic because you haven\u2019t read as far as me.\u201d\u201cBut that is that and this is this. You can\u2019t judge people by only looking at one side.\u201dIt was an unexpected conversation so I looked up at Han Sooyoung for a while.Han Sooyoung was smiling coldly.\u201cNo matter how much you claim that my work is plagiarism, it has actually never been affected by Ways of Survival.\u201d\u201c\u2026You almost convinced me without saying that. It is a real pity.\u201dI said this but my mind was a bit complicated.What type of person was Yoo Jonghyuk?\u00a0Could I really say that I was familiar with the existence of Yoo Jonghyuk?I was able to confidently answer until a while ago.\u00a0I was the only reader who read all of Ways of Survival.But I felt that some of my answers were being diluted in the soup.\u00a0Did I know Yoo Jonghyuk at all?Not long after that, the soup started boiling.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is impressed with your good deed.][The constellations of the absolute good system support your good deed.][3,000 coins have been sponsored.]It was rare for a person to be damaged by sponsorship. Shit.I approached Yoo Jonghyuk with the soup. Han Sooyoung brought me a spoon from a nearby store. I scooped up the soup with the spoon and put it in Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s mouth. Han Sooyoung watched me blowing on the soup.\u201cYou are acting like a wife.\u201d\u201cDo you want to do this?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dIn fact, I wouldn\u2019t have given the job to her anyway.\u00a0It was due to the system message that I heard every time I scooped up a spoonful of soup.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is impressed with your good deed.][500 coins have been sponsored.]It was tremendous to receive coins every time I fed him.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is impressed with your good deed.][300 coins have been sponsored.]I thought it was a loss to me but it turned out to be a huge honey event.\u00a0Indeed, people should live a good life.However, I started to feel a bit strange after 10 spoonfuls.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is impressed with your good deed.][400 coins have been sponsored.]\u2026Was this constellation really impressed with the good deed?\u00a0Would it last until the bowl was empty?Yoo Jonghyuk started to open his eyes with a slight groan.\u00a0He was still in bad shape but he was gradually healing from the poison. I didn\u2019t miss his opportunity and took out one item.[You have used the Midday Tryst.][You are seeking consent from the target.]Midday Tryst was an item that allowed for a one on one conversation with the selected target for a specified time period. If I had a bit more coins, I would\u2019ve learnt the Sound Transmission skill but I didn\u2019t have that much to spare. Therefore, I chose the next best thing.[The target has agreed to communicate with you.][The Midday Tryst has started.]Once I sent a message to Yoo Jonghyuk, a small messenger window emerged in front of me.\u2013Hey, can you hear me?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe connection was formed.I purchased this item for three reasons.One was because Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s tongue was paralyzed by the effect of Thousand Spirits Poison and the second reason was to avoid leaking information to Han Sooyoung. The third and most important reason was that I didn\u2019t want to confirm to Yoo Jonghyuk that I could read his thoughts.The next moment, Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s message came up.\u2013Kim Dokja, move to the east right now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He will come find us when he wakes up. Rather\u2026\u201d\u00a0I looked at Han Sooyoung running beside me and said,\u00a0\u201cCan\u2019t you carry him? You can use your avatar.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u00a0The disgusted Han Sooyoung quickly moved away from me.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say earlier that Yoo Jonghyuk might not be a bad guy?\u201d\u201cThat is that and this is this. Isn\u2019t he the one who cut my head off?\u201dI couldn\u2019t say anything to refute her words.\u00a0Yoo Jonghyuk spoke through Midday Tryst.\u2013You can leave me.\u00a0I don\u2019t need help.\u2013Don\u2019t be so prideful.\u00a0I really will abandon you.I couldn\u2019t see Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s face because he was being carried on my back.\u2013When will you be able to move by yourself?\u2013In two days.\u2013Will you kill me when you recover?I asked half-jokingly but this bastard didn\u2019t give an answer.\u00a0I deliberately reduced the pace at which I was moving.\u2013Then I can\u2019t help you.\u00a0How can I believe a guy who is trying to kill me? I will help you if you swear an Oath of Existence.\u00a0Swear not to kill me until the end of this regression.\u2013I can\u2019t do that.Lousy bastard.\u2013Then swear you won\u2019t hurt me until the fifth scenario is over.\u00a0If you can\u2019t do that, I really won\u2019t help you.Yoo Jonghyuk thought for a moment before replying.\u2013I swear.Surprisingly, Yoo Jonghyuk agreed to the oath.\u00a0The Oath of Existence. It was a constraint on the person who swore it.A cold flame emerged from Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s body and dug into his heart. If he broke the oath, this blue flames will burn his heart. I felt a bit relieved but then Yoo Jonghyuk continued.\u2013I won\u2019t kill you.\u00a0But\u2026\u2013But?\u2013I will hit you once.\u2013What?I was dazed for a moment. He was going to hit me?\u2013Is this because of two days ago?Yoo Jonghyuk didn\u2019t answer again.\u00a0I thought it was strange that Yoo Jonghyuk agreed to the oath so easily.-\u2026It is one hit.\u00a0I\u2019ll do it gently.\u00a0Understood?Yes, it might not be bad if one hit could restore my relationship with Yoo Jonghyuk.\u00a0In my current state, I wouldn\u2019t die from one of Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s blows.Shortly after that, we crossed Cheongdam Bridge and entered Gwangjin-gu.I felt the surrounding ecology change little by little.\u00a0Grass was growing on the streets and instead of rotting bodies, the smell of monster feces filled the area.The trunk of a huge plant emerged from the ground and wrapped around the surrounding high-rise buildings.[The 7th grade plant species \u2018Yanaspleta\u2019 is on the lookout.]I spoke to Han Sooyoung who was pulling out a weapon.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t act so rashly. It is fine as long as we don\u2019t attack first.\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t these type of monsters suddenly attack with tentacles?\u201d\u201cThat is just in the manhwas. They are gentle. Just be careful not to step on the roots.\u201dAt the top of the building, the head of the plant that resembled a sunflower followed after us with its eyes. It seemed scary but it was actually a good monster. This didn\u2019t mean that the situation was optimistic.The plant species originally came after the Great Hall was fully opened.\u201cThe terraforming has started.\u201dTerraforming.The fifth scenario was world versus world.\u00a0Humanity fought against the worlds that were coming.Just like Seoul was suffering from the erosion of Chronos, China would be facing the \u20183rd Murim World\u2019 while Japan would be facing the \u2018White Demon World.\u2019Han Sooyoung scouted around with avatars and said.\u201cIt is a monster colony. Damn.\u201d\u201cThe terraforming will be even faster if the disasters awaken.\u201d\u201cWhat type of person is waking up the disaster?\u201d\u201cA person like you. You woke up the fire dragon.\u201dHan Sooyoung bit her lips.\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t you tidy it up?\u201d\u201cAt that time, the intermediate dokkaebi placed a penalty on the fire dragon. And what if I didn\u2019t kill it? Don\u2019t tell me that you would catch it?\u201d\u201cThere was a penalty? Then didn\u2019t it benefit us to catch a weakened disaster?\u201d\u201cThe Disaster of Questions has no penalty. It is questionable if the dokkaebi would even place a penalty on it.\u201dWe moved quickly to avoid the monster\u2019s colony. In the streets, the ground rats and grolls were eating corpses.Looking at the traces of the destroyed monsters, Yoo Jonghyuk seemed to have come through this path.\u00a0Yoo Jonghyuk was great to walk so far in this physical condition.I spoke to Yoo Jonghyuk.\u2013I have a question.\u2013\u2026\u2026-Why come to me?\u00a0I honestly thought you would commit suicide.\u2013Suicide?\u00a0How ridiculous.If he had seen his future in the 8th turn, he wouldn\u2019t be able to say this.\u00a0I was a bit confused by his next words.\u2013If I was going to give up so easily, I wouldn\u2019t have started this journey.It really felt like the first time I read Ways of Survival. I thought that maybe Han Sooyoung was right. The Yoo Jonghyuk I believed I knew was the Yoo Jonghyuk who easily gave up, easily killed people and repeatedly caused numerous tragedies.However, the Yoo Jonghyuk of the third round wasn\u2019t yet like that.\u00a0Maybe I didn\u2019t know the Yoo Jonghyuk of the third round.[Your understanding of the character \u2018Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019 is increasing.]In the meantime, Yoo Jonghyuk said.\u2013I thought of you right away. I thought you would be a bit of help since you are the one who smashed the Absolute Throne.\u2013You aren\u2019t going to say anything about me breaking the throne?\u2013I don\u2019t want to talk about what already happened.\u00a0In addition, I thought about it.\u00a0You must\u2019ve done it to rule out the \u2018god of the other world.\u2019-\u2026You know?I was honestly frightened because I had never really spoken to Yoo Jonghyuk before.Putting aside his coolness, this bastard had such a great mind?Yoo Jonghyuk kept speaking.\u2013Honestly, I think it isn\u2019t a bad way.\u00a0The problem is what happens next.\u00a0After you crushed the throne, the guides were scattered and there was a setback in collecting the meteorite.\u00a0This is why the terraforming of Gwangjin-gu and Gangdong-gu is so fast.\u00a0The wanderers are using the power of the meteorites.\u2013What do you mean?\u00a0Terraforming won\u2019t accelerate simply by using the meteorites.\u2013One of the 10 Evils has taken possession of a \u2018disaster meteorite.\u2019The 10 Evils. My heart instantly sank.\u00a0I had expected it but actually hearing it was a different matter.\u2013Is it the Poisoner?-\u2026You know.\u2013She is the only one who uses Thousand Spirits Poison.But there was still a part that I didn\u2019t understand.\u2013Then why are you poisoned?\u00a0If you knew that the opponent was the Poisoner, shouldn\u2019t you have avoided facing her from the front?\u2013I was trying to convince her.\u2013Convince?\u00a0You?Then a scene belatedly popped up. Yoo Jonghyuk said.\u2013I wanted to make her a companion.Companion\u2026 I see.\u00a0I remembered now.\u00a0Poisoner Lee Seolhwa was Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s companion in the second round.The 10 Evils weren\u2019t always opponents.Just like Armed Fortress Master Gong Pildu changed in this round, Lee Seolhwa was transformed into a companion in several rounds, including the first regression. In all other regressions so far, Poisoner Lee Seolhwa was one of the few companions that Yoo Jonghyuk could rely on.\u2013You did something that isn\u2019t like you.\u2013I admit it.\u00a0I was pathetic.\u2013\u2026\u2026\u2013She isn\u2019t the person I remember.\u00a0I knew it.\u00a0Still, I wanted to believe for a moment that the woman in my memories was still alive.\u00a0\u00a0I wanted to be with her again.I couldn\u2019t help opening my mouth at the loneliness that he had buried deeply.In his second life, Lee Seolhwa didn\u2019t last long but she was Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s lover.\u2013I understand.Yoo Jonghyuk was silent for a moment.\u2013You are talking as if you have regressed before.\u2013I don\u2019t need to regress to understand.I knew that I shouldn\u2019t speak about understanding.\u00a0Still, I wanted to say it.\u00a0Since he wouldn\u2019t receive understanding from anyone in the future, I thought I could say this.[The character \u2018Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019 is deeply shaken.][The character \u2018Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019 has received a faint consolation.]\u2013Strange.\u00a0You obviously aren\u2019t a regressor\u2026\u00a0But I feel like you really understand these emotions.\u00a0Is this also the power of a prophet?I didn\u2019t answer, making Yoo Jonghyuk continue speaking.\u2013Of course, you aren\u2019t a good person.\u00a0You are the unscrupulous person who kidnapped my sister.\u2013When did I kidnap her?\u00a0I just protected her.\u00a0You must\u2019ve understood with Lie Detection\u2026\u201cKim Dokja.\u201dWe stopped talking at Han Sooyoung\u2019s tense voice. The road from Cheonho Bridge to Gangdong was visible. The Great Hall emitted a bright light and something fell towards Gangdong-gu.Dammit, it was already happening.We fully entered Gangdong-gu and the density of the strange grasses covering the ground increased. Dirty trees grew between buildings and there were small beasts running on the trees.Gangdong-gu was already half of another world.Han Sooyoung bit her lips and asked,\u00a0\u201cAre we too late? What if the disaster has already awakened?\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened yet. Then we would\u2019ve received the scenario.\u201dWe took a few more steps and saw several markings on the ground.\u00a0It looked like graffiti but it was actually a territorial display.It was a warning that no one should enter.From here on, it was the area of the Poisoner. Like the other wanderers, she settled in Gangdong-gu and started to expand her base.The progress was faster than I expected.Han Sooyoung said,\u00a0\u201cIf this group is well guarded, it won\u2019t be easy to attack\u2026 Have you thought of something?\u201dNo.\u00a0I didn\u2019t intend to wage an all-out war in the first place.\u201cWe only need the meteorite. We can just steal it. I will buy time while you take the meteorite.\u201dHowever, it wouldn\u2019t be so easy.\u00a0The story might be different if I had an assistant like the Wanderer King.Yoo Jonghyuk interrupted.\u2013There is no need to rush.\u00a0Even if the disaster begins, the Disaster of Questions is a disaster that can be suppressed at an early stage.An early suppression.\u00a0Indeed, it was possible for Yoo Jonghyuk.\u2013Early suppression?\u00a0Who will do that?\u00a0Are you a half god?\u2013Of course it should be you.\u00a0Weren\u2019t you thinking about it anyway?\u2013Why do you think that?\u2013You have already woken up the guide and received the Way of the Wind.Based on his tone, he was slightly anger that I had taken the Way of the Wind that he was supposed to learn. I said with a smile.-I didn\u2019t learn it.-\u2026Why?\u00a0There wasn\u2019t enough time?I\u2019m actually glad.\u2013No, I don\u2019t have talent.I could feel Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s deep contempt in his silence.\u2013You, from the beginning\u2026\u201cThere are people.\u201dThe moment I heard Han Sooyoung\u2019s words, I raised Unbroken Faith. It was the territory of one of the 10 Evils so the peple would naturally belong to their group.I entrusted Yoo Jonghyuk to Han Sooyoung\u2019s avatar.\u201c\u2026I will be gone for a while so take him. Do you understand?\u201dThe people were getting closer. But something felt strange. Usually it wasn\u2019t so loud when a single group moved. Then the clear voice of a woman was heard in front of us.\u201cEverybody run towards Cheonho Bridge!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t the Poisoner\u2019s group.They weren\u2019t as powerful was the Wanderer King\u2019s group but some people who survived the Poisoner\u2019s Group were escaping from Gangdong-gu. The unarmed survivors gasped for air when they found us.\u201cO-Out of the way! Hurry!\u201dTerrible arrows came flying towards them. The man who spoke to me fell down after being hit by an arrow. The man\u2019s back quickly became discoloured and blackened. It was poison.\u201cGet those scum!\u201dThe Poisoner\u2019s group. Dozens of men and women simultaneously fired arrows.The moment we tried to avoid it by moving behind a building, threads of silk spread out in the air.Dozens of webs were arranged at once, causing the arrows to become tangled in the thread and not go any further. Han Sooyoung\u2019s eyes widened.\u201c\u2026What the hell is that technique?\u201dIn fact, it was fired from behind the Poisoner\u2019s group. The thread was like steel wire. The sharpness of the thread caused the legs of people to fly through the air.\u201cKuaaak!\u201dAll the threads were connected to one woman. The woman wearing a tight black battle suit flew through the air. Two knives stretched out from the fingers of the woman brilliantly riding the thread of magic.The woman freely manipulated the length of the thread and she swept away the Poisoner\u2019s group in an instant.There wasn\u2019t any hesitation in her hand.\u00a0The movements were beyond beautiful.\u00a0The combination of stats and skills showed that she didn\u2019t have an ordinary sponsor.[The information of this person can\u2019t be read in \u2018Character List.\u2019][This person isn\u2019t registered in \u2018Character List.\u2019]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe wasn\u2019t even on the Character List.Han Sooyoung muttered.\u00a0\u201cHey, that woman\u2026\u201dI knew without her saying anything.\u00a0It was because this woman was someone I knew.\u201c\u2026Yoo Sangah-ssi?\u201dI hadn\u2019t met her in two days yet she was completely different from the girl I knew.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the present time, it was probably just Armed Fortress Master Gong Pildu\u2019s Armed Zone and Han Sooyoung\u2019s Avatar. Yet Yoo Sangah was showing such power without such a great skill.How did she become so strong?\u00a0What was this talent?Yoo Jonghyuk spoke as if he had read my thoughts.\u2013She grew faster because you aren\u2019t around.\u00a0You seem to have no aptitude for raising your fellow companions.\u00a0It is the same with Lee Hyunsung.-\u2026They grew to this extent because I pushed them in the beginning.Actually, I didn\u2019t really believe it but I wanted to say it.\u00a0Damn, why did she get stronger when I wasn\u2019t around?\u00a0Why didn\u2019t I seem to be much help?\u201cHey.\u201d A voice was heard.\u00a0I nodded at Han Sooyoung\u2019s words.\u00a0I couldn\u2019t be overwhelmed by Yoo Sangah forever.\u00a0In any case, there were many enemies and Yoo Sangah was alone.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, this way!\u201dYoo Sangah stopped when she heard my words.\u00a0She clearly hadn\u2019t expected to meet me in this place.\u201cHan Sooyoung, please.\u201dHan Sooyoung triggered Avatar like she was waiting.\u00a0Dozens of avatars disturbed the vision of the Poisoner\u2019s group and I safely made contact with Yoo Sangah.\u201cDokja-ssi? How are you\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk after moving.\u201dThe group members were chasing from afar. Fortunately, the survivors seemed to have escaped safely through Gangdong Bridge. The problem was on our side.\u2013Go back to the high-rise buildings.\u00a0The most important step is to go up and secure visibility.As expected, Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s judgment was valid.\u00a0I might\u2019ve read all of Ways of Survival but I couldn\u2019t make battlefield judgments like Yoo Jonghyuk. Then Yoo Jonghyuk followed with meaningful words.\u2013And that woman, you should be careful of her.Be careful? Who?\u00a0Yoo Jonghyuk didn\u2019t say anything else.We quickly hid inside a nearby high-rise building.\u00a0The monsters suddenly flooded the area, probably due to the turmoil, and just narrowly missed our tail. They soon gave up and returned to inner Gangdong.I looked back at Yoo Sangah.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, are you okay?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine. Dokja-ssi?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m also fine.\u201dIt had only been a few days but the conversation was awkward.\u00a0It felt like I was meeting an alumni from high school 10 years after graduation.\u00a0I looked away from her in her tight battle suit and opened her mouth.\u201cThat, um\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t figure out what to ask.In the meantime, I looked at Han Sooyoung. Yoo Sangah saw Yoo Jonghyuk being carried on the back of Han Sooyoung\u2019s avatar and gave me an unknown smile.\u201cDokja-ssi must\u2019ve done a lot in the meantime.\u201dIt was time to listen to a short story.***After the Absolute Throne was smashed, Yoo Sangah fell to Gangdong-gu. Fortunately, there was someone who fell with her.\u201cGong Pildu was with you?\u201d\u201cYes. Ahjussi helped me a lot.\u201dSeeing that she was calling him ahjussi, they seemed to have become quite familiar with each other.\u201cWhere is Gong Pildu?\u201d\u201cTwo days ago, he was injured while we were fighting the Gangdong-gu group. It was while trying to save me\u2026\u201dMany surprising things kept happening today. \u201810 Evils\u2019 Gong Pildu risked himself in order to save someone else. Yoo Sangah bowed her head and spoke with difficulty.\u201cIn the end, Ahjussi lured them to Han River\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah bit her lips and a poisonous expression filled her face.\u00a0I suddenly realized why Yoo Sangah killed the Poisoner\u2019s group without hesitation.I spoke to comfort her.\u00a0\u201cGong Pildu is probably okay. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dI had a contract with Defense Master so I would know immediately when Gong Pildu died. I would be penalized according to the terms of the contract. The fact that there was no reaction meant that Gong Pildu was alive somewhere.Like the Poisoner, Gong Pildu was also part of the 10 Evils.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t that easy for him to die.\u201cWhere did you get those clothes and the dagger?\u201d\u201cAh, this\u2026\u201dAfter separating from Gong Pildu, Yoo Sangah found the green meteorite. The green meteorite was a meteorite containing rare items. I checked the items she had. I remembered that there was a meteorite containing these items in the vicinity of Cheonho-dong.[Ancient Assassin\u2019s Dagger][Rich Cat\u2019s Leather Suit]Both were excellent S-grade items.The Ancient Assassin\u2019s Dagger had the option of increasing damage to distant enemies while the Rich Cat\u2019s Leather Suit increased movement speed the longer the duration of the attack.\u201cThey are great items.\u201d\u201cYes, I am able to fight well thanks to these items.\u201dYoo Sangah smiled and then the quietly listening Han Sooyoung spoke up.\u201cHrmm, are you sure that\u2019s all?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s say that you \u2018accidentally\u2019 got the items. But it doesn\u2019t make such to have such combat skills with barely any items. Who the hell is your sponsor? How did you raise \u2018Quick Movements\u2019 or \u2018Dagger Mastery\u2019 so quickly? It is impossible for the growth to be so fast even with a growth package.\u201d\u201c\u2026Who are you?\u201d\u201cMe? It am the 1st Apostle.\u201dYoo Sangah raised her weapon without speaking.\u00a0\u201cCalm down Yoo Sangah-ssi. This person isn\u2019t an enemy.\u201dYoo Sangah looked at me with disbelief.\u00a0\u201cAre you friends now?\u201d\u201cWe aren\u2019t friends\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Chungmuro group members died because of that person. Surely you haven\u2019t forgotten?\u201dYoo Sangah was the deputy of Chungmuro while I was absent.Therefore, her affection towards the Chungmuro members would be much deeper than mine. Han Sooyoung said,\u00a0\u201cChungmuro? Ah, I see. You are that woman?\u201dYoo Sangah narrowed her eyes at the words.Han Sooyoung smiled and added,\u00a0\u201cHey, Kim Dokja. I am a bad person but I am also a good judge. She has a big sponsor behind her.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen I saw her at Chungmuro, she wasn\u2019t that strong. Isn\u2019t it strange? She can\u2019t grow so explosively in such a short period of time, even if she has a narrative grade sponsor. Maybe if she has a SSS grade accelerated growth skill\u2026 How can many constellations can provide such support to South Korea?\u201dMy heart wanted to deny it but rationally, I knew that Han Sooyoung was right. There was also Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s words from a short while ago.\u00a0In addition, Yoo Sangah had been hiding her sponsor from me.Yoo Sangah\u2019s troubled eyes met mine.I used to think that Yoo Sangah\u2019s sponsor was \u2018Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth\u2019.The only person who could find the path through the magic room was the person who handed the thread to Theseus in Daedalus\u2019 Labyrinth, \u2018Ariadne.\u2019But as Han Sooyoung said, it was impossible for her to grow to such a degree with Ariadne\u2019s sponsorship.In addition, the movements that she showed while moving through the air in the previous battle was closer to the Hermes Walking Method than Air Steps. Ariadne\u2019s incarnation couldn\u2019t use Hermes\u2019 stigma.I was about to open my mouth when something unexpected happened.[Haha, everyone! How have you been?]Dammit\u2026 this timing.\u00a0I immediately looked out the window.\u00a0A new dokkaebi was floating in the sky.[The participants in this scenario are quite hasty. There is still a week before the start of the scenario and people are already waking up a disaster. Are you curious about the next scenario?]It wasn\u2019t the level of Bihyung\u2019s nonsense but it was still talking nonsense.\u00a0Perhaps there was no one in charge so this low-grade dokkaebi took their place.[The dokkaebi have left their positions so I will be here for this period\u2026 haha. Now have you all eaten your fill? You do know that this event can\u2019t be skipped, right?]This wasn\u2019t good.\u00a0It was a really bad development.[I want to do that but I won\u2019t be a dokkaebi if I don\u2019t give scenarios.]The fact that a scenario was appearing now told me one thing.[The sub scenario \u2013 Disaster Prevention has arrived.]It meant that the outbreak of a disaster was just around the corner.+[Sub Scenario \u2013 Disaster Prevention]Category: SubDifficulty: S-Clear Conditions: Unknown powers in Gangdong-gu are trying to hatch one of the disasters. Defeat them and stop the incoming \u2018disaster.\u2019Time Limit: 2 hoursCompensation: 22,000 coinsFailure: Early emergence of the Disaster of Questions.+Since we received the \u2018Disaster Prevention\u2019 scenario, the Poisoner\u2019s group would\u2019ve received the \u2018Defend the Disaster\u2019 scenario.The damn dokkaebis were still trying to be part of this unforeseen situation.\u00a0I looked at the party members and said,\u00a0\u201cIt isn\u2019t the time for us to fight. Now we have to handle this situation.\u201dHan Sooyoung and Yoo Sangah nodded at the same time.***The Poisoner\u2019s group was based in Cheonho-gong of Gangdong-gu.\u00a0To be exact, it was an area filled with churches and a cathedral.If their purpose was to awaken the disaster early, it was a good choice to choose a religious area.\u00a0The prayers of those who lost their places would create an environment suitable for hatching the \u2018disaster.\u2019Han Sooyoung finished scouting and opened her mouth.\u201cThe road with the lowest level of terraforming is in the northeast, centred on the base. It is 16 Cheonjung-ro. If we go this way, we can reach the base in the shortest time. But the defenses are formidable.\u201dI nodded.\u00a0We didn\u2019t have time so we had to go through the fastest way.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We have to reach that building as quickly as possible. Han Sooyoung and Yoo Sangah-ssi will take the front. Don\u2019t fight each other.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk couldn\u2019t help right now so I decided to leave him on the roof of the high-rise building with Han Sooyoung\u2019s avatar. His role was to watch the battlefield. Yoo Jonghyuk didn\u2019t express much dissatisfaction. He just gave this piece of advice.\u2013If possible, get rid of them before the disaster hatches. Without Way of the Wind, the initial suppression of the Disaster of Questions is almost impossible.Of course, I wanted to do that if possible.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe moment I gave the signal, we jumped down the building.Han Sooyoung used Avatar and took the lead. Dozens of avatars jumped onto the road and attracted the attention of the Poisoner\u2019s group.\u201cWhat? Kill them!\u201dAs the confused group members chased after the avatars, thin and transparent thread filled the air.\u201cKuaaak!\u201dThe people chasing after the avatars were caught by sharp threads and their legs were cut off. This wasn\u2019t the end. There was another strong thread in the location where the people fell.Their heads were cut off and flew through the air.It was a terrifying double trap designed by calculating the angle of the fall. Han Sooyoung clicked her tongue.\u201cShe is brutal.\u201d\u201cYou aren\u2019t someone who should be saying that.\u201dApart from their feelings towards each other, the combination of the two was worth looking at. No, it was very useful.Thanks to their help, I was able to dig into the centre of the base while avoiding their surveillance.It wasn\u2019t difficult to find the disaster meteorite.\u00a0It was a huge meteorite over 8 metres high.\u00a0It emitted an ominous aura and seemed to say \u2018I am the disaster.\u2019Certainly, it felt like the fire dragon was no comparison.\u00a0If I couldn\u2019t stop this disaster, Seoul would surely be destroyed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThen a woman appeared next to the meteorite.\u00a0She had hair as white as snow.\u00a0As I saw the lips that were like red flowers on a snowy mountain, I could see Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s taste.The cold and glassy eyes stared at me and I felt a terrible spirit emerge from her body.It made my skin crawl.\u00a0It was an overwhelming feeling compared to Gong Pildu.I see.\u00a0Did she also receive the power of the disaster meteorite?\u201c\u2026Who are you?\u201d\u00a0One of the 10 Evils, the Poisoner Lee Seolhwa asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The second method was to draw out the power of the disaster meteorite in advance. The third and fastest way was to supply magic power to the disaster meteorite.Dozens of Lee Seolhwa\u2019s group members were praying.A faint magic power was flowing out of their bodies into the disaster meteorite.The hatching ceremony.\u00a0They had chosen the third method.\u00a0Based on the meteorite\u2019s heavy shaking, the disaster would hatch in 30 minutes.I looked at Lee Seolhwa and opened my mouth.\u00a0\u201cWon\u2019t you stop? Unless you want to die together.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201dIt was strange.In the third round of regression in the original, there was no one foolish enough to wake up the disaster, even if they did borrow the power of the disaster.Yoo Jonghyuk must\u2019ve visited Lee Seolhwa in advance because he knew about it.\u201cStop hatching the disaster meteorite.

I cut off the legs and wings of the lower humans.\u201cKiiit!\u201dMagic power gushed out and burned the lower humans in a flash. It was the same in the case of the werewolves. They walked a path other than human and I didn\u2019t receive a penalty from killing them. I broke through the flames and ran towards Lee Seolhwa.For the first time, Unbroken Faith was blocked.\u00a0Lee Seolhwa\u2019s fingernails and forearms were tinged with a dark light.The power of the disaster increase the level of the stigmas.\u00a0By borrowing the power of the disaster, her Poisonous Nails could block the Blade of Faith. However, that didn\u2019t mean she could prevent all damage.\u201cKuuack!\u201dSparks flew and Lee Seolhwa\u2019s body was pushed back a few steps.\u00a0It would be strange if this didn\u2019t happen.My current overall stats were the highest among all incarnations apart from Yoo Jonghyuk.\u00a0I might have no talent but I wasn\u2019t weak among the incarnations.\u201cGive up.

Doesn\u2019t this sub scenario have no penalty for failure?\u201dLee Seolhwa looked towards the disaster meteorite nervously.\u00a0There was a change in the atmosphere.It felt like she was aiming at the \u2018disaster\u2019 rather than power from the disaster meteorite.It was strange.\u00a0Even a person who didn\u2019t read the original novel would expect Seoul to be destroyed when a disaster hatched.\u00a0Then why did she want to wake up the disaster?[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]+[Character Information]Name: Lee SeolhwaAge: 26 years oldConstellation Support: Guam Divine Doctor \u00a0(Guam =pen name of Heo Jun, court physician who wrote Dongui Bogam, a medical text that showed up in a previous chapter)Private Attribute: Competent Physician (Rare) Master of Poison (Rare)Exclusive Skills: Weapons Training Lv. 7, Love Affair Demon Lv. 4, Emit Deadly Poison Lv. 5, New Poison Preparation Lv. 4, Counteract Poison Lv. 5\u2026Stigma: Deadly Poison Lv. 4, Thousand Spirits Poison Lv. 4, Crossroad of Life and Death Lv. 3Overall Stats: Physique Lv. 44 (+10), Strength Lv. 42 (+10), Agility Lv. 44 (+10), Magic Power Lv. 35 (+10).Overall Evaluation: The current comprehensive evaluation is currently in progress.* This character is currently infected with a \u2018parasite.\u2019* The parasite is controlling the body of the character.* Some of parasite Antinus\u2019 stats will be transferred to the character.+\u2026Damn.\u00a0I didn\u2019t think her condition would be like this.[Due to the effect of your exclusive attribute, the memory effect of some scenes have increased.]In my head, pages flipped and the sentences of some pages flowed over my retinas.\u300c There are five dominant species in the world of Chronos.

Yoo Jonghyuk asked.\u2013Do you have a countermeasure to the Thousand Spirits Poison?\u2013I do.I also wasn\u2019t an ordinary person.\u00a0Strictly speaking, I wasn\u2019t an incarnation.\u00a0Lee Seolhwa\u2019s poison spread through the air towards me.It felt like it had its own will as the poison freely moved through the air and found my weakness.\u00a0A few drops splashed on my thighs and then my forearms.\u00a0A part of the suit hit by Thousand Spirits Poison started to melt.A satisfied smile appeared on Lee Seolhwa\u2019s face.\u00a0However, this was an early judgment.I ran through the poison and punched her hard in the belly, throwing her back.\u201cKiiiiiet!\u201dShe flew through the air with a terrible cry.My skin touched by the Thousand Spirits Poison showed some discolouration but it soon returned to its original colour. Lee Seolhwa was upset.\u201c\u2026Kik,\u00a0the Thousand Poisons Resistance?\u201dHorror was in her eyes.\u00a0Thousand Poisons Resistance was the terror of all beings who used poison.\u00a0However, I didn\u2019t have Thousand Poisons Resistance or Immunity to Ten Thousand Poisons.\u201cAntinus, you don\u2019t know the sponsor behind your host?\u201d\u00a0I put my hand in my pocket.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t know.

And the Poisoner\u2026 No, Immortal Doctor Lee Seolhwa could be one of the greatest set points of this approximation.\u201cKim Dokja, this side is done!\u201dI turned around and saw Han Sooyoung and Yoo Sangah approaching this way.\u00a0Amazing.\u00a0The two of them swept up that many people?It might be a situation where the Poisoner was missing but they were still the \u2018Poisoner\u2019s Group\u2019\u2026The original plan became meaningless.\u00a0The two of them might be comparable to Lee Jihye\u2019s Ghost Fleet and Gong Pildu\u2019s Armed Zone.\u201cWait, don\u2019t come over here.\u201dI had to restrain their movements.\u00a0It was difficult if they didn\u2019t have immunity to being infected.\u00a0This fight hadn\u2019t ended yet.Kiiiit\u2026 human\u2026!The mucus that escaped from Lee Seolhwa\u2019s body gathered in a ball at one point in the air.Parasite Queen Antinus.\u00a0She was scary in parasitic mode but even scarier when she didn\u2019t have a host.The mucus moved like a small bug and formed a shape.\u00a0It was a body made of nutrients that had been absorbed for many years.\u00a0It was a body with beautiful curves and solid muscles.She had dragonfly-like wings and a tail that resembled a scorpion.\u00a0She was covered in an insect\u2019s shell apart from the face, but she looked more like a bipedal creature than an insect.The real battle started now.\u201cGet away before you are infected!\u201dThe sharp tail aimed for my stomach.[The effect of the Dongui Bogam \u2013 Incomplete has been activated.][Your body is immune from a parasitic infection.]It was so fast I couldn\u2019t avoid it despite having over 50 agility.

I was knocked onto the ground and a strong pain filled my body.Strong.\u00a0She became even stronger when she wasn\u2019t in a host.\u00a0The power of her main body was comparable to a 5th grade insect king species.Once Antinus unleashed her fighting power, it was equivalent to the degraded fire dragon I once killed.It might be destroyed but she was still the hero of her world.\u00a0She was as strong as Lycaon who emerged from the yellow meteorite.This didn\u2019t mean I had no chance.It was a clear violation of the scenario rules for the \u2018guide\u2019 to cause such an uproar before the fifth scenario ended. It wasn\u2019t just killing a few people. She even tried to hatch a disaster, which meant she had given up on her probability.The sign of a probability storm was already descending on Antinus\u2019 body.As time passed, the collapse of her body would accelerate, even if I didn\u2019t attack.

Hey, are you okay?\u201d\u201cU-Uh\u2026 who\u2026\u201d\u201cExcuse me, can I ask you something?\u201dNo. She shouldn\u2019t answer that question.\u00a0I wanted to shout but my voice didn\u2019t come out.\u201cWhere is this place?

Which of these three races are the best?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 the best?\u201dOnce the woman asked, the boy laughed like he was dying with joy.\u00a0It was a creepy laugh.\u201cThen\u2026 who among the three has the most delicious meat?\u201dI listened to the Disaster of Questions and thought.\u00a0Yes, it might be natural that Antinus wanted to destroy Earth.\u00a0It was because a \u2018human\u2019 of Earth destroyed her world.The woman didn\u2019t answer the boy\u2019s question.\u201cP-Please, spare me\u2026\u201dThere was a sound and the woman\u2019s head flew away.

Unexpectedly, she had the advantage. Even the Disaster of Questions was perplexed by the overwhelming attacks.\u201c\u2026What? Why are you so strong? Is Noona also a returnee?

He carefully looked at my Blade of Faith and sighed with relief.\u201cPhew\u2026 that\u2019s right. It isn\u2019t a real energy blade. Ahjussi, why are you acting like it is real? You almost scared me?\u201d\u201cBrat, you talk too much.\u201dIt was a cold female voice. While I was stalling for time, Han Sooyoung made dozens of avatars and they ran towards him.\u201cDie!\u201dHan Sooyoung\u2019s attacks poured onto the boy whose movements were blocked.However, her attacks weren\u2019t strong enough to harm Myung Ilsang\u2019s body.

You are just feeding that jerk.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t answer!

It was because Yoo Sangah appeared behind him while emitting a fierce killing intent.[Hermes Walking Method].[Theseus\u2019 Resolution].[Arachne\u2019s Web].The system messages didn\u2019t pop up but I was able to recognize these skills.\u00a0In a future scenario called Ragnarok, these skills were clearly described.\u00a0They were the stigmas of the Olympus related constellations.The surprised Myung Ilsang unleashed a series of Small Black Fire Cannons to keep Yoo Sangah in check.However, Yoo Sangah rushed towards Myung Ilsang without caring about the black fire cannons.\u201cSomething like this\u2026?\u201dIt was impossible.As long as they didn\u2019t experience a special scenario event, there was no way for an incarnation to simultaneously possess the stigmas of various constellations.It was a situation where I only had two stigmas.\u00a0Then how could Yoo Sangah have such a large number of stigmas?\u201cLet\u2019s try it! Does it hurts?\u201dSweat covered Yoo Sangah\u2019s forehead.The thread of magic power kept expanding and shrinking. She stepped freely through the air. The dagger pierced without hesitation whenever there was a visible gap. The vitality inside her body was burning.It was an extraordinary change in just two days\u2026At this moment, I sensed something.\u00a0The stigmas of various constellations in one incarnation.There obviously wasn\u2019t a single case in Ways of Survival.\u00a0It didn\u2019t even apply to Prophet Anna Croft of the United States.\u00a0Then Yoo Sangah\u2026\u201cDokja-ssi! Now!\u201dYoo Sangah gave the signal and I supported her explosive attack with the Blade of Faith. Han Sooyoung also participated. Little by little, Myung Ilsang became dizzy from all the hands and feet.His movements were delayed for a moment and my Blade of Faith aimed at the gap, cutting his shoulder and belly.\u201cShit\u2026!\u201dBlood flowed out. Myung Ilsang pulled back and chanted something.[The character \u2018Myung Ilsang\u2019 has used Blink Lv. 1.]Myung Ilsang\u2019s figure became blurry.\u00a0My mind was in a hurry. He couldn\u2019t get away.I aimed the blade at his waist.\u00a0But his body faded away just as the blade hit.\u00a0The only thing left was scattered blood.[The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 lets out a sad sigh.][The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is going crazy from all the sweet potatoes.] (Sweet potato is slang for when something is so frustrating that there is a stuffy sensation)[The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 is pointing a finger at your heart.][The excitement of some constellations has reached a critical level.]Han Sooyoung shouted,\u00a0\u201cShit, we missed him!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. He is injured so we can catch him soon.\u201d[Some constellations have calmed down.]\u201cYoo Sangah. You did really well\u2026 Yoo Sangah-ssi?\u201dThere was no answer from Yoo Sangah. I headed over because I sensed something strange, where she was standing there stunned. Han Sooyoung asked,\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201dI belatedly realized. Theseus\u2019 Resolution was a skill that drew out all the power of the incarnation. The use of that skill allowed Yoo Sangah to deal with a monster for a while.I looked at her for a moment before handing her over to Han Sooyoung.\u201cGiving another person to me? Am I a daycare centre?\u201d\u201cWe need to find the disaster quickly. Shouldn\u2019t you scatter more avatars?\u201d\u201cI think I roughly know where he went.\u201d\u201cPlease guide me.\u201dI couldn\u2019t miss that guy here.\u00a0Han Sooyoung opened her mouth again,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t remember well\u2026 He becomes stronger every time he answers a question, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. He is weak at first but becomes stronger every time he hears an answer. The returnees are too strong so there is a penalty when they fall into this world. Didn\u2019t you see the seals being released?\u201d\u201cThat boy\u2026 how many seals does he have?\u201d\u201cPerhaps dozens. There will be no answer if he releases all of them.\u201dSo far, five seals were released.Fortunately, the additional scenarios of the dokkaebis hadn\u2019t come down yet.If an additional scenario was released, many people would try to hunt that bastard and his seals would be released in a flash due to the many idiots answering his questions.\u2026The moment I was feeling relieved.[Hrmm. Everyone, aren\u2019t you great? Despite the penalty, this is still a disaster.

I can see people who are already leaving Gangdong-gu. Haha, everyone. You should listen to the end. You will regret it later if you run away now. This disaster is definitely an opportunity for you.]The dokkaebi spoke in a loud voice.[Haven\u2019t you been having a hard time gathering coins? I know it all. Your life collapsed overnight and now strange existences are taking your coins. The people who were friends yesterday are suddenly stabbing you today. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not you. Right now, the stars in the sky are probably tell you, \u201cHey, shake your ass a little better. I\u2019ll give you 100 coins.\u201d][A handful of constellations are giggling and laughing.]The dokkaebi didn\u2019t laugh.[I understand that you feel like shit and hate these jerks. Since the world is destroyed, you just want to live the way you want. You are very courageous but you feel a sense of helplessness when you realize that this world is divided in two. You feel disappointed when you realize that your constellation, which was barely obtained after shaking your ass, is inferior to the constellation of a successful person. You feel angry about the unfair world. I\u2019m well aware.][Some constellations oppose the dokkaebi\u2019s speech.]Speaking of which, this dokkaebi wasn\u2019t ordinary.\u00a0A low-grade dokkaebi with weak courage wouldn\u2019t be able to say this. Their channel would be ruined if there was a backlash from the constellations.But this was only for minority channels. The bigger the channel, the more different the dokkaebi.They knew the laws of the story.\u00a0They couldn\u2019t tell a big story if they were only obsessed with subscriptions.\u00a0A true storyteller must deal with the \u2018person\u2019 rather than the \u2018audience.\u2019I closely observed the dokkaebi who was still talking.[I have prepared something for all of you.

This damn guy is the \u2018disaster\u2019 you have to catch today.]It was somewhat strange.I was wondering why a low-grade dokkaebi replaced the position of an intermediate dokkaebi. It was because he was the dokkaebi of a major channel.[I can already hear your resentment. How the hell can you kill a SSS-grade? Haha, there is no need to worry.

The disaster had only briefly passed but the ground was destroyed and the tall buildings collapsed.On the road lit by the glow of the sunset, people covered with black dust crawled out.\u00a0They were all people who ran here to obtain items.\u00a0People who wanted to be the protagonist but had to remain as \u2018characters.\u2019Some people held their injuries while others wiped their tears. I could also see people bowing down to me. However, most people were lying on the ground as cold bodies.I had read all of Ways of Survival.\u00a0I understood the settings, the meaning of the explanations and finally thought that I had figured out the author\u2019s intentions. But in Ways of Survival, there were no sentences describing these deaths.I turned and saw Yoo Jonghyuk watching the same scene as me.\u00a0Perhaps Yoo Jonghyuk had seen this scene alone many times.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk.\u201d\u00a0He turned to look at me.\u00a0I rolled the words around the tip of my tongue for a bit before shutting my mouth.\u00a0\u201c\u2026It is nothing.\u201dThe scenarios would continue in the future and I would see this moment many times. I would encounter scenes that weren\u2019t expressed in the text several times.Then a translucent window appeared in front of me and I heard an unexpected message.[The dokkaebi \u2018Dokgak\u2019 has invited you to his channel.]\u2026Who was inviting me to a channel?\u00a0I was confused for a moment but decided to ignore it.\u00a0Then the message flashed again.[The dokkaebi \u2018Dokgak\u2019 has invited you to his channel.]I looked up at the air and saw one dokkaebi looking down at this side.\u00a0It was a one-legged dokkaebi with an unpleasant smile. Bihyung was behind him with a terrible expression and looked between us.\u00a0There was a gap even among dokkaebis of the same rank.\u2026Yes, I had a rough idea of this situation.\u00a0I took a deep breath and deliberately spoke in a loud voice,\u00a0\u201cWhat? You won\u2019t give me the rewards?\u201dDokgak\u2019s eyebrows twitched at my words.\u00a0However, his mouth was still relaxed.[Oh, of course. I\u2019m sorry. I made a mistake.]Dokgak was a scary dokkaebi. He wasn\u2019t silly like Bihyung but had a different constitution from the intermediate dokkaebis.\u00a0Not just anyone could be a streamer of a major channel.[The sub-scenario \u2013 SSS-grade Hunt has ended.][The compensation settlement will begin.][You have obtained 50,000 coins as compensation.]I felt better when I received a huge number of coins.\u00a0This scenario gave me 50,000 coins in one go.\u00a0It was a great scenario.Given the fact that sub scenarios were formed at the discretion of the dokkaebi, most of these coins would come from Dokgak\u2019s pocket. I thought his stomach would hurt but Dokgak was smiling softly.[It is a great pleasure to see interesting stories. How can I not be amused?]He muttered like he read my mind.\u00a0Well, he had a big channel in Tokyo Dome so this level of coins being bled wouldn\u2019t matter.Why did he leave Japan now?\u00a0Chances were high that great players like Oda Nobunaga or Miyamoto Musashi would still be active.\u00a0Yes\u2026 was he full because the incarnations in his house were so busy?\u201cThen give me the extra compensation quickly. Is this all?\u201d[Ah, of course. I should naturally give it to you. You are the one who made this scenario interesting.]I somewhat became angry at his sarcastic tone.\u00a0If it wasn\u2019t for this bastard, the Disaster of Questions would\u2019ve been a lot easier. Bihyung glanced at me from behind and communicated with me.\u2013Hey\u2026 you know.However, Dokgak interrupted Bihyung before his words could be conveyed.[Bihyung, prepare the compensation.]Bihyung made a surprised and angry sound.[Huh?][Prepare for compensation. Do I have to tell you twice?]Look at this?\u00a0Bihyung hesitated before opening his mouth again.\u00a0[You are currently in charge of the sub scenario\u2026][How interesting Bihyung. You dare act like this in front of the incarnations?]A fierce aura started to crush Bihyung\u2019s body. The power of the dokkaebi depended on the size of the channel.[It seems to be true that the size of your channel has grown lately.]Bihyung shrank back as Dokgak kept talking.[N-No! It is a misunderstanding!][You do know that the sixth scenario involves Korea and Japan together? Have you already forgotten?][I-I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019ll prepare it right away!][Get started right away.][Yes!]I didn\u2019t feel good because Bihyung was the one managing my channel\u00a0To be honest, Bihyung and Dokgak\u2019s relationship seemed similar to how Song Minwoo bothered me during high school.[Additional compensation settlement will begin.][You have acquired Parasite Species\u2019 Benefactor as a basic reward.][An additional selection reward exists.][You are the largest contributor to this scenario.][You have the first choice of additional compensation.]I saw a translucent catalogue appear in front of me.\u00a0Once again, it was quite useful to catch a disaster.[Infinite Dimension Space Coat] \u2013 SSS-grade.[Dark Fire Half-Gloves] \u2013 SSS-grade.[Sylphid\u2019s Jump Boots] \u2013 SSS-grade.Triple S-grade compensation items.\u00a0I quickly looked at the options of the items.The Infinite Dimension Space Coat had a special option of a \u2018inside pocket space\u2019 that allowed him to carry many things.Dark Fire Half-Gloves greatly amplified skills with the dark and fire attributes.Finally, Sylphid\u2019s Jump Boots allowed me to use the \u2018jump\u2019 effect three times a day.They weren\u2019t star relics but it was enough to go to the 10th scenario.\u00a0People might say, \u2018It is SSS-grade but it is only to the 10th scenario?\u2019 But the world of Ways of Survival was originally like this.The item grade inflation was substantial in the world of Ways of Survival. The difference in performance of the items obtained in the early stages to the middle stages was huge, despite having the same grade.Of course, it wasn\u2019t necessary to throw away SSS-grade items now but special materials would be needed to transcend equipment.This was why it was good to have star relics.\u00a0Unlike other items, star relics didn\u2019t need transcendence. Once scenarios opened, the star relics would recover their inherent power that was beyond the constraints of probability.[\u2026Please choose a reward.]\u00a0Bihyung told me with a grouchy expression.\u00a0He was exhausted by the harassment.At this moment, I heard Bihyung through the dokkaebi communication.\u2013Personally, I recommend the Infinite Dimension Space Coat.\u00a0There is one more hidden option. It is easier to transcend later.He was working as my manager.\u00a0The quick-witted Dokgak was staring at Bihyung.[Bihyung?][\u2026Yes!][You must explain the items to the constellations. Have you forgotten?][I-I understand!]Bihyung quickly started to explain the items to the constellations of Seoul Dome.\u00a0I used this break to talk to Yoo Jonghyuk.\u00a0\u201cYoo Jonghyuk, what are you going to choose?\u201dI had first choice but I decided to give it to Yoo Jonghyuk since I received his help.\u2026Of course, this was if Yoo Jonghyuk didn\u2019t hit me into the ground.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk?\u201dHe didn\u2019t answer.\u00a0He was just staring at me.\u201cDid you pass out again?\u201dI waved my hand in front of his eyes several times but his pupils didn\u2019t change.[The character Yoo Jonghyuk is currently using Recovery Hibernation Lv. 3.]\u2026Indeed, it was abnormal for him to move with that body.\u00a0His body must be half broken to be able to use Recovery Hiberation.\u00a0I couldn\u2019t just pick so I left a message with Midday Tryst. Han Sooyoung watched by my side and interrupted,\u00a0\u201c\u2026Perhaps I should choose instead?\u201d\u201cOnly if you want to be hit by Yoo Jonghyuk later.\u201dHan Sooyoung became silent in an instant.\u00a0I spoke to Bihyung,\u00a0\u201cI will choose Infinite Dimension Space Coat.\u201dHowever, the answer didn\u2019t come from Bihyung.\u00a0Dokgak nodded and turned off the catalogue with a flick of his fingers.[You have picked a good item. Then let\u2019s go the payment area.]Payment area?[The additional compensation can\u2019t be paid here.]Look at this.\u201cWhere are you going to take me?\u201d[I\u2019ll take you to my \u2018Dokkaebi Official Post\u2019.]The Dokkaebi Official Post. (Official post in Korean also means a horsehair cap worn by officials)In folk tales, it was a type of clothing but here it was different. It was a \u2018room\u2019 that all dokkaebis had. It was a room that hid their true colours.\u201cThat is a problem. Just give it to me here.\u201dIt was their unique space. I didn\u2019t know what to expect.\u00a0As far as I knew, there was no procedure regarding moving to a Dokkaebi\u2019s Official Post in order to receive additional compensation.It was obviously this guy\u2019s suggestion to go to his official post.\u00a0Bihyung was watching me anxiously from next to him.\u00a0I watched Dokgak with narrowed eyes.[Hrmm\u2026 do you want me to cancel the additional compensation?\u201d\u201cTry it.\u201dThe scenario\u2019s compensation was a fixed rule of the Star Stream.\u00a0Even a sub-scenario made with a dokkaebi\u2019s discretion couldn\u2019t take back an item that was given after the scenario was over.A smile flashed on Dokgak\u2019s face.[How interesting.]\u2013This isn\u2019t a good idea.The dokkaebi communication.As Dokgak opened his mouth, two voices were heard.[Kim Dokja. I\u2019ve heard your story. You are so famous that the constellations of the lands beyond the peninsula know about you.]\u2013I know about your contract with Dokkaebi Bihyung.\u00a0But among the dokkaebis, it is possible to \u2018transfer incarnations.\u2019[I\u2019ve heard that you act proudly in front of dokkaebis and today I have discovered that the rumour isn\u2019t false.]\u2013I will speak bluntly.\u00a0Come to my channel.\u00a0I am going to expand my channel to the Korean Peninsula.I will be happy to meet your desired items and conditions.Interesting.\u00a0He made me a scouting proposal in this manner.\u00a0The suggestion from Dokgak could be seen as moving from a team in the Asian League to a top team from La Liga.It was an attractive offer.\u00a0The problem was\u2026 the transfer.\u00a0I knew this guy called \u2018Dokgak.\u2019\u201cI might look like this but I\u2019m actually really scared. I\u2019m trembling while talking to you like this. So give me the item quickly.\u201dDokgak\u2019s expression hardened at my words.[How interesting. You are humble.]\u2013You are too arrogant.\u00a0You will be humbled one day.\u201c\u2026What does that mean?\u201d\u2013Bihyung\u2019s channel will soon disappear.A laugh emerged from Dokgak\u2019s mouth.[Then it can\u2019t be helped. I originally wanted to announce this after paying the \u2018compensation\u2019 but I\u2019m sorry.]\u2026An announcement? What announcement?Dokgak looked up at the sky.\u00a0He looked at the constellations emitting light and slowly opened his mouth.\u00a0His voice seemed to echo in all of Seoul.[I have regrettable news for the constellations who have watched the scenario with interest so far.]The low-grade dokkaebis quickly withdrew from Bihyung\u2019s vicinity. Bihyung made a bewildered expression. It wasn\u2019t good whenever the dokkaebis acted like this.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[Unfortunately, among the channels operating in Seoul Dome, there is a channel that has been illegally manipulating the scenarios.][Many constellations are paying attention to \u2018Dokgak\u2019s words.\u2019][It is the #BI-7623 channel of Dokkaebi Bihyung.

What does this mean? Why did he suddenly mention the probability?\u201d\u201cHe is arguing needlessly.\u201d\u201cArguing? Why?\u201dWhy?\u00a0Was it because I rejected his offer?\u00a0Dokgak floated in the sky and reported to the Bureau.The probability judgement\u2026I didn\u2019t think it would be used in this way.\u00a0I expected the dokkaebis of other big channels to start a fight but I didn\u2019t expect it to be like this.Bihyung\u2019s face turned red and he was tearful as he looked between me and Dokgak. It looked like tears would burst out as soon as he was touched.\u2013W-What?\u00a0What do I do now?\u2013Tell me honestly.\u00a0Did he find out about our contract?Bihyung shook his head.\u2013Did he notice you opening the Dokkaebi Bag?\u2013T-That can\u2019t be.\u2013Really?\u2013P-Probably\u2026\u2013Well, don\u2019t panic yet.\u00a0Even if that is the case, it isn\u2019t something that is worth asking for a \u2018probability conformity request.\u2019\u00a0In the first place, it isn\u2019t a violation of regulations.It was true. There was no precedent in which an incarnation made a \u2018stream contract\u2019 or could use the \u2018dokkaebi bag\u2019, so it wasn\u2019t a direct violation of Star Stream\u2019s regulations.Bihyung belatedly nodded with relief.\u2013Y-Yes.\u00a0I understand.Seeing this childlike Bihyung, I didn\u2019t know if he was the dokkaebi or if I was.\u00a0I looked at Dokgak and the low-grade dokkaebis again.[The #BI-7623 channel manipulation has been reported.][The Bureau is currently discussing this issue.]If I was right, the probability request would eventually be cancelled.\u00a0Although the story would be different if Dokgak had \u2018evidence\u2019 for this\u2026He was hiding information and I had no way to figure out what it was.\u00a0Then there was only one way left.\u201cHey, can you stop stalling and quickly give me my reward?

Let me look. How is the channel I belong to illegally manipulating the scenario? Is there any evidence?\u201dI would find out what his evidence was if he had it. If he was bluffing, the situation would end immediately.Dokgak smiled like he had been waiting.[Do you really want to hear it? You will regret it.]\u201cTell me.\u201d[This issue involves you, Kim Dokja.]\u201c\u2026Me?\u201dAt this moment, I had a thought.Was it because I used future information from the text? But due to the filtering, this information shouldn\u2019t have spread to the constellations or the dokkaebis. Otherwise I would\u2019ve already been caught in a probability storm\u2026[Do you see the screen?]A huge screen appeared in the air.\u00a0The screen showed videos of my recent battles.\u00a0The first screen showed my conflict with Poisoner Lee Seolhwa.[This is proof.\u201c\u2026What is the proof?\u201dThe screen just showed that I didn\u2019t kill Lee Seolhwa.\u00a0Dokgak changed the screen.[This is also proof.]The second screen showed me watching the battle between Lycaon and Antinus.\u00a0What was this\u2026[This is the third proof.]On the third screen, I was attacking the Disaster of Questions, Myung Ilsang. \u00a0It was a scene where Myung Ilsang continuously released his seals. Suddenly, my stomach felt pained.[What do these screens have in common?]I realized it at this moment.\u00a0This guy wasn\u2019t talking to me right now.[The constellations looking at the screens, do you have any idea?]Everyone in the area became quiet.[The fight against the Poisoner, the fight against Antinus and the fight against the Disaster of Questions. There is one thing these three fights have in common.]Then the screen kept changing.[He actually had a chance to kill the Poisoner and stop the disaster.]His finger pointed to the Poisoner.[He could stop the disaster by killing Antinus.]Then he pointed to Antinus.[He could\u2019ve stopped the Disaster of Questions before the seals were released.]He pointed to Myung Ilsang then he pointed towards me.[But he \u2018deliberately\u2019 didn\u2019t do it.]\u201cWait!

The moment the fourth wall between the audience and the character collapsed, the audience would cool off straight away.This was what Dokgak aimed for.[The constellation Bald General of Justice\u2019s mouth is gaping open.][The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is chuckling.][The constellation \u2018Secretive Plotter\u2019 shrugs like it is fine.]Some constellations were astonished, some constellations had no idea and some constellations were silent.The problem was the other constellations.[Some constellations have left the channel.][The constellations questioning the fairness of the channel has left the channel.][Some constellations are requesting coin refunds from the channel.]The constellations left and Bihyung\u2019s channel started to shrink.[The size of the channel is reduced.]The messages continuously popped up. Bihyung\u2019s pale body was becoming smaller.\u00a0His horns were shrinking.I eventually sighed.\u00a0\u201cThe channel is dead.\u201dThere was only one way left.\u00a0I looked at the dwindling number of constellations and spoke to Dokgak.\u201cI understand so give me the compensation when you are done talking. I will accept your offer.\u201dDokgak\u2019s lips curved upwards.\u2013You are smart.Bihyung\u2019s eyes grew wider with disbelief.[Y-You\u2026!]\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that.

Then let\u2019s have a sweet rewards time.]Dokgak flicked his fingers and the surrounding landscape disappeared.\u00a0We reappeared in a room reminiscent of a luxury hotel suite.\u2026This was his \u2018official post\u2019?\u00a0I looked around a bit nervously. Low tables and chairs suitable for a dokkaebi were placed over luxurious rugs.\u00a0There was a wide variety of alcohol on one side. Later I realized that it was a suitable setting for a dokkaebi who liked to drink.I finished looking around and approached the window.\u00a0The landscape outside was\u2026Oh my god.\u00a0A darkness with no end filled my vision.Glittering stars flowed in the darkness of the grand universe. It was a superb vision of the grand universe like endless jewels. The constellations repeated their orbits and rotations, each one part of the huge galaxy.It was funny that at his moment, I was purely impressed.\u00a0This was the Star Stream.\u00a0It was the flow of the great stars that governed all scenarios.\u00a0Every story began here.\u201cIt is great.\u201d\u00a0I looked back and saw Dokgak standing there.\u00a0\u201cSometimes I just stare blankly at this landscape. I never get tired of this sight.\u201d\u201cYou are now\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, are you surprised? This is my \u2018real\u2019 voice.\u201dIt was the first time I heard the dokkaebi\u2019s voice.\u00a0Previously it was always heard through a broadcast.\u00a0In other words, the sight before me was Dokgak\u2019s real \u2018body.\u2019 Dokgak\u2019s eyes shone.\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d I asked.\u201cWhat do you think? Ah, do you think I\u2019ll kill you?\u201d\u00a0He burst out laughing.\u00a0\u201cYou know that is impossible.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not crazy enough to fight against a dokkaebi either.\u201d\u201cI like it. Then let\u2019s start the contract.\u201dDokgak flicked his fingers and a dokkaebi with a contract appeared before him. It was Bihyung. He was tied up by the system and stared at me with reproachful eyes.\u201cI brought Bihyung as a notary. In any case, you have to break the contract with him to form a contract with me. The cost of the destruction will be covered by Bihyung.\u201dI was a bit surprised.\u00a0This guy, he knew about my contract with Bihyung.\u00a0It meant he knew from the beginning that I was a good person to attract the \u2018find an incarnation\u2019 group.I pretended to be calm.\u00a0\u201cDo as you like. I don\u2019t care.\u201d\u201cIt is good that the story is fast. Would you like to check the contract? It is also my first time making such a contract.\u201dI read the contract.\u00a0Needless to say, the contract was completely full of adverse conditions for me.\u00a0Donations would be distributed 5:5.\u00a0There were also some conditions that bound my freedom.\u00a0Even now, I was the \u2018gap\u2019 instead of the \u2018eul.\u2019Dokgak laughed.\u00a0\u201cHow about it? This is the industry average but I can make some adjustments.\u201dIt sounded like the industry average.\u00a0Bihyung also tried a similar contract in the beginning.I nodded and said,\u00a0\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t bad. But before I sign the contract, I have a suggestion.\u201d\u201cSuggestion? What is it?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a shame if I\u2019m the only one moving channels?

You will be able to move channels through me without having to struggle with the constellations.\u201d\u201cHrmm. That\u2019s true. Very interesting.\u201d\u201cThere is also something I\u2019m curious about.\u201d\u201cCurious about?\u201d\u201cWhat types of constellations are in the channel I will contract with? I\u2019m just wondering what a big channel looks like since I\u2019ve only been in a small channel like this. I would like to see it in advance. Is it okay?\u201dI deliberately spoke towards Bihyung. Bihyung\u2019s expression became hurt in real time. A smile of satisfactory appeared on Dokgak\u2019s face.\u201cBihyung, you signed with a really good incarnation. I really think so.\u201dDokgak\u2019s hands moved through the air and he started to manipulate the system.\u201cGood. Then let\u2019s show you the air of a big city.\u201dThe next moment, it felt like a new cord was stuck in my body. There was a definite connection that seemed to lead somewhere.I slowly blinked and felt countless gazes on me.\u00a0One, two, three\u2026 all the hairs on my body rose.\u00a0It was quite different from Bihyung\u2019s channel.\u00a0I could feel their presences just from their eyes.Amazing.\u00a0This was the channel of a dokkaebi who dominated Tokyo Dome?\u201cHow is it? There is a new league for you to play in.\u201dIt seemed that there weren\u2019t just Japanese constellations.\u00a0Did this jerk had fixed subscriptions on other continents or worlds?\u00a0If I worked in such a place, how many coins could I get at once?\u00a0To be honest, I couldn\u2019t even guess.I murmured, \u201cGreat. Isn\u2019t this really big?\u201d\u201cThen the contract\u2026\u201d\u201cBefore that, I want to say hello for a moment. Is that okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026Please do so.\u201dDokgak made a disgruntled expression but he eventually allowed it.\u00a0I started talking with my eyes closed.\u00a0\u201cConstellations of Tokyo Dome. Can you hear me?\u201d[Some of the constellations who hate the Korean peninsula are looking at you.]\u201cI\u2019m sure that some of you have heard my story. I am Kim Dokja, the one who smashed the Absolute Throne and became the king of a kingless world. Please note that I have no sponsor\u2026 um, well. That\u2019s correct. I hope to get along with you in the future.\u201d[The constellations of Tokyo Dome are listening to you.]I only gave a brief introduction and some constellations were already starting to approach me indirectly.Good.\u00a0The start wasn\u2019t bad?\u201cBy the way. As a memorial to my channel, I will do a small event. I mean, a joint event between South Korea and Japan\u2026 If you are curious, please connect to #BI-7623 right now. I will draw tickets for the early constellations and give coins\u2015\u201dThen the channel link was disconnected.\u00a0I opened my eyes and saw Dokgak staring at me as he asked,\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell are you doing now?\u201d\u201cWhat? It is an event.\u201d\u201cWhat are you thinking? Do you want to die? The constellations in my channel don\u2019t play in such shallow waters\u2026\u201dI would gladly give him a surprise because he cut me off at the point where people were feeling curious.\u00a0Then Dokgak\u2019s body started to slowly change.\u201cWait, constellations. Where are you going?\u201dThe flow was changing.\u00a0Constellations started pouring into Bihyung\u2019s channel little by little.[A number of constellations have entered channel #BI-7623.][The channel level has risen.]I smiled widely.\u00a0\u201cA lot of you came.

I\u2019ll do it in a bit. Think about it. Is it so important to get a coin or two? What is the point if you don\u2019t have incarnations to spend the coins on? Go slowly, slowly.\u201d[Some constellations are looking at you with disgruntled eyes.]\u201cYou may have heard of this but I\u2019ll tell you again. I am Kim Dokja and I don\u2019t have a sponsor. I won the war between kings and prevented a disaster before it began. There are probably few incarnations stronger than me if you look around the world. There will be none with no sponsor. By the way\u2026 it will be hard to last until the end.\u201dDokgak started to turn pale as he noticed my intentions.\u201cWait! You\u2026!\u201dI laughed at Dokgak.\u00a0A production?\u00a0Yes, I would show him what a real \u2018production\u2019 was.\u201cSeoul Dome is now ahead of the fifth scenario. If you are smart, you will know what that means. Yes, that\u2019s right. There will soon be an event that you will like.\u201dNow there was less than a week until the start of the scenario.\u00a0Before the entire disaster scenario started, a special event would be hosted.\u00a0A banquet for all the constellations in the Star Stream.\u00a0Soon, the second Sponsor Selection would start.I continued speaking.\u00a0\u201cIn celebration, I would like to do a surprise event. If the number of subscriptions to this channel reaches 10,000 on the day of the Sponsor Selection\u2026\u201d[The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 is gulping.]\u201cI will make one of the constellations in this channel my partner.\u201d[The constellation Secretive Plotter is looking at you with interest.]\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what gender, race or world you originated from.

I hope you have the passion to send the end of this damn story with me.\u201d[The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 wipes his head.]\u201cWhoever is good. I will be waiting for you. 10,000 viewers. Do you remember? Please convey it to other people properly.\u201d\u201cW-Wait a minute! Wait! Just wait!\u201dDokgak cried out but it was already too late.\u00a0There was a wicked voice and unstoppable channel messages.\u00a0I was dizzy from the indirect messages that came from everywhere.Some time passed.Cold anger rose on Dokgak\u2019s face.\u00a0He made a decision and raised his hand towards me.\u00a0\u201cIncarnation Kim Dokja. You will die here.\u201dYes, I thought he would react like this.\u00a0I laughed while pretending to be calm.\u00a0\u201cThere are currently many constellations watching. Aren\u2019t you afraid of the storm?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the master of Tokyo Dome.\u201dThere was no patience left in Dokgak\u2019s furious face.\u00a0Damn.\u201cDo you think I can\u2019t deal with the probabilities caused by killing a bug like you?\u201dDokgak\u2019s fingers moved.\u00a0It was a gesture like he was flicking away a bug.\u00a0Powerful sparks appeared around me.\u00a0It was the \u2018balloon burst\u2019 that was Dokgak\u2019s specialty.\u00a0The currents would cause my body to burst like a balloon.\u00a0My swollen intestines would scatter as fragments and all the pieces that made up my body would become dust scattered into the universe.This was what originally should\u2019ve happened.\u201c\u2026What is this?\u201dHe tried again.\u00a0Dokgak flicked his fingers two more times.\u00a0However, there was no change.\u00a0Not long afterwards, even the sparks disappeared.\u201cT-This is\u2026\u201d\u00a0The confused Dokgak stared at his fingers.\u00a0However, he still didn\u2019t understand.\u00a0The problem wasn\u2019t his fingers.There was a chill and a enormous shadow appeared behind me, darkening my vision.\u201cHey. Dokkaebi.\u201dA voice was suddenly heard.\u00a0I instinctively knew. The owner of this voice was now protecting me. It was natural when thinking about it. One a dokkaebi who used the system could prevent the use of the system.\u201cIs it fun to show off your power?\u201d\u00a0It was the first time I heard Bihyung\u2019s real voice.The astonished Dokgak stuttered,\u00a0\u201cUh, how did you get Character Redemption\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh, this? Didn\u2019t you just give me a hard time because of your strength?\u201dDokgak\u2019s face turned red.\u00a0Belated rage filled his face.\u00a0\u201cYou are at best a low-grade dokkaebi\u2026 Bihyung! What do you mean by this rudeness?\u201d\u201cLow-grade? You are also low-grade despite your number of subscribers.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t get a promotion on purpose. Do you dare anger me, the master of Tokyo Dome?\u201d\u201cTokyo Dome? Good, Tokyo Dome. Are there many good constellations left there?\u201dBihyung moved from behind me towards Dokgak.\u00a0\u201cBy the way, were you this small?\u201dTheir appearance looked the same but now Bihyung was several times larger than Dokgak.Bihyung\u2019s giant shadow proved it.\u00a0Once again, a dokkaebi\u2019s power increased with their number of subscribers.The fear stricken Dokgak staggered back.\u00a0\u201cH-How\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou were talking very well earlier. What? I was illegally manipulating the scenario?\u201d\u00a0A black arm emerged from Bihyung\u2019s shadow and grabbed Dokgak\u2019s neck, raising him into the air.\u00a0\u201cThe jerk who steals the incarnations of others\u2026 who taught you business ethics?\u201d\u201cU-Uh. You absolutely won\u2019t be safe if you do this\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d\u00a0Bihyung\u2019s right arm swelled enormously.\u00a0\u201cGo to Andromeda and find your concept!\u201dThe shadow\u2019s fist burst through the shield on the ceiling and Dokgak flew to the far side of the universe.He wouldn\u2019t die because he was a dokkaebi but he would be hit hard for a while. Bihyung let out a breath like he was relieved.By the way, I nearly died.\u00a0I sighed with relief and approached Bihyung.\u00a0The channel had just grown but Bihyung seemed strange.\u00a0We looked at each other and I was met with Bihyung\u2019s confused eyes.I couldn\u2019t tell if he was laughing or crying.\u00a0Perhaps this was the expression that dokkaebis made when they were really happy.\u201cDo you know what I am seeing right now?\u201dI didn\u2019t know but I had an idea.\u00a0\u00a0It probably wasn\u2019t much different from what I\u2019m seeing.[The channel level has risen.][The channel level has risen.][The channel level has risen.]...Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[A constellation who likes the Korean peninsula wants to be your sponsor.][A constellation who wants historical reconciliation wants to be your sponsor.][A constellation who likes to change gender wonders about your heart.][A constellation that enjoys subculture is interested in you.]The endless messages started to fill the ears of me and Bihyung.\u00a0Now the stage would expand to the world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seemed to be a database system, not real documents.Bihyung looked this way.-\u2026What are you doing?\u2013Nothing.Bihyung saw the powder on the table and looked at me suspiciously.

What the hell are you going to do?\u00a0What if the subscriptions really reaches 10,000?\u00a0It is already at 5,000.I shrugged without speaking and Bihyung continued.\u2013Wasn\u2019t there a condition for you to not choose a sponsor when you signed the contract with me?How can you say something like this?\u2013It will work out somehow.\u00a0You can also break the contract.\u2013I can\u2019t do that.\u2013Jerk\u2026 I risked my life for you yet you can\u2019t do this?Bihyung\u2019s expression darkened.\u2013That\u2026Indeed, I was a fool to expect anything.

The clean design carefully paid attention to fashion as well as combat function. I took the coat and checked the pocket first.[The special \u2018space\u2019 feature of the Infinite Dimension Space Coat is activated.]The advantage of this coat was that I could store various items in it without the Inventory skill. It was a good item for me since there were many troublesome items to carry such as the Ganpyeongui, Dongui Bogam and Magic Power Stove.\u201c\u2026By the way, it is white unlike the catalogue photo.\u201d[The other colour is out of stock.]Out of stock.

Of course, the space isn\u2019t wide so use it cautiously.+I looked at it again.\u00a0Only the subspace could be used but it had a SSS rating?\u00a0When considering that the ancient dragon Ignitus\u2019s heart had a SS grade\u2026[\u2026Honestly, it is just due to the influence of the maker.

I blinked once and returned to ground. Han Sooyoung freaked out and retreated when I suddenly appeared in thin air.\u201cHey! Where the hell did you go?\u201d\u201cI had to do something for a moment.\u201d\u201c\u2026Was it resolved well?\u201d\u00a0Sometimes Han Sooyoung had a habit of speaking like this without knowing what happened. \u00a0Was it a writer\u2019s ego? I just nodded.\u201cNew clothes? Damn, I\u2019m envious.\u201d\u00a0She gazed at the coat I was staring with envious eyes and then Yoo Jonghyuk, who was still unconscious. She looked between Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s black coat and my white coat before opening her mouth.\u201cBy the way, are you a couple?\u201d\u201c\u2026It is just a coincidence.

Fortunately, his recovery seemed to be going smoothly. His breathing was stable and his wounds were healing.\u201cLet\u2019s go quickly. Before this jerk wakes up.\u201dYoo Jonghyuk had fainted with two clenched fists. It wasn\u2019t hard to imagine what would happen if this guy woke up first.***I left Gangdong-gu with Han Sooyoung. Yoo Sangah was being carried by Han Sooyoung\u2019s avatar. She was still unconscious from exhaustion.I had gone back to the battlefield where we fought Antinus but couldn\u2019t find Lycaon.\u00a0There was no body so he seemed to be alive. I just didn\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t come to me.\u00a0He must be severely injured after being struck by the hatching disaster.Han Sooyoung looked back at me and asked,\u00a0\u201cIs it really okay to leave him?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cBut that is the Poisoner. Can you trust her?\u201dThe unconscious Yoo Jonghyuk was left with Lee Seolhwa.\u201cThe Poisoner originally isn\u2019t a bad person. It is due to the Parasite.\u201dIn many episodes where she wasn\u2019t infected by the guide, Lee Seolhwa was called the \u2018Doctor\u2019 rather than the \u2018Poisoner.\u2019 Maybe she would be called that in this regression.\u2013Take him and go towards Gaebong-dong.\u00a0In the 5603th military division, a poor soldier will be waiting for you.I confirmed Lee Hyunsung\u2019s location using Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint and decided to accept Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s advice.\u00a0I was arrogant to think I could raise my colleagues with my strength.I had a limited time and information, even if I was a complete reader.\u00a0Therefore, the best trainer for Lee Hyunsung right now wasn\u2019t me, but Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201cI\u2019m hungry. Shall we eat that?\u201dI pointed to a plant growing around a high-rise building.[The 7th grade plant species \u2018Yanaspleta\u2019 is looking at you.]Han Sooyoung looked at the huge sunflower\u2019s eyes and cried out with fright,\u00a0\u201c\u2026Can we eat that?\u201d\u201cWe have to eat it because there is nothing else. According to Ways of Survival, it is quite delicious. It is also a child and easy to hunt.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dHan Sooyoung made a disgruntled expression and soon started to summon her avatars. We cut off the stems and tentacles of the plant species. The yanaspleta was shortly disconnected from its roots and closed its eyes.Once again, I felt like I had become stronger. Even if it was young, a seventh grade species was handled so easily.\u201cHan Sooyoung. Are you going to eat?\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll cook.\u201dI started cooking the yanaspleta like I had read in Ways of Survival.\u00a0I peeled off the hard skin of the stem and sprinkled a bit of herb salt that I got from a nearby grocery store.The inside contained pinkish flesh reminiscent of seasonal crab meat. Han Sooyoung\u2019s eyes shone.\u201cWhat the hell is this? It is a plant right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWe are eating a salad?\u201d\u201cOf course not. I\u2019ll burn it.\u201dI roughly cut off a branch of the surrounding tree, turned the yanaspleta stalk into skewers and put it on the Magic Power Stove. I set the stove to a medium fire but it took a long time to cook because it was a seventh grade species. I flipped it around a few times and then sprinkled more salt.\u00a0After some time, the smell of grilling meat filled the area.\u201cHey, can you smell it?\u201d\u201cWait, we can\u2019t eat it just yet.\u201d\u00a0I stopped her from reaching into the stove and handed her a teacup that had been warming up on the side.\u00a0\u201cDrink this before eating.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cJuice from the boiled stem. It needs to be consumed before eating the yanaspleta.\u201dHan Sooyoung took the cup with a doubtful expression. Then after a while, her expression became impressed. She drank all the juices and started to cut the stem.\u201cEat slowly.\u201d\u201c\u2026This isn\u2019t a joke. You can really cook.\u201d\u201cMaybe only in this ruined world.\u201dI laughed because she looked like a five year old child stuffing her face with good food.[Some constellations who love cooking are curious about your cooking.][Some constellations who like fast progress and violence are complaining.][The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 says to keep watching.]There was one week left until the start of the fifth scenario.\u00a0The Burning Hell disaster and Disaster of Questions had been overcome, making the development smooth.Yoo Jonghyuk would take the disaster in the west with Lee Hyunsung once he woke up while the Wanderer King would handle the north.\u00a0The only thing to be aware of now was the \u2018central disaster.\u2019I picked up the yanaspleta juice and looked at the still unconscious Yoo Sangah.\u00a0\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi.\u201dWas I mistaken?\u00a0The unconscious Yoo Sangah obviously flinched.\u201cI know your mental state right now. Come and eat this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t, I will just eat it.\u201dYoo Sangah didn\u2019t rise.\u00a0Then I heard a growling sound from her stomach.\u201cYou must be sleeping. Then we will eat this. Ah, too delicious.\u201d\u201c\u2026W-Wait a minute!\u201d\u00a0Yoo Sangah cried out and rose from her spot.\u00a0As expected, Yoo Sangah couldn\u2019t just lie down after smelling the food.\u00a0She consumed a lot of stamina so it was natural for her to be hungry.I glanced over at Han Sooyoung, who was still eating.\u00a0\u201cHey. You have eaten a lot so get up.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cDo you have to ask?\u201d\u201c\u2026Che. You make people feel uncomfortable. I understand.\u201dMaybe Han Sooyoung knew that Yoo Sangah was already awake.\u00a0She also knew that Yoo Sangah wouldn\u2019t move because of Han Sooyoung\u2019s presence. This girl was really bad.\u201cI will go around the area once. Don\u2019t eat it all and leave me some. Understood?\u201d\u00a0Han Sooyoung grabbed a skewer and disappeared into the darkness.Once she completely disappeared, Yoo Sangah slowly approached.\u00a0The skewer on top of the stove made a delicious cooking sound.\u00a0I gave the skewer to the hesitating Yoo Sangah. Yoo Sangah accepted it and started biting into it.Yoo Sangah ate one skewer and barely managed to open her mouth.\u201c\u2026Delicious.\u201dThere were tears in her eyes.\u00a0Anyone who saw her now wouldn\u2019t think she was that girl wielding the daggers.\u201cEat slowly.\u201dThe two daggers at her waist showed that her appearance during the daytime wasn\u2019t a dream.\u00a0It was one month since the destruction began.\u00a0I felt like there was a lot of work to do.Yoo Sangah ate the skewers silently while I also ate while watching her.\u00a0The skewers were really delicious.\u00a0It was as if the taste wasn\u2019t of this world\u2026Yoo Sangah watched the flames blazing from the stove and muttered,\u00a0\u201c\u2026This is real.\u201d\u201cProbably.\u201d\u201cNow we can\u2019t go back?\u201d\u201cYes, probably.\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s hands faintly trembled.\u00a0She killed humans with those hands.\u00a0In order to live, her hands had taken away the lives of others.The hand that had been covered in someone\u2019s blood now covered her eyes. Her shoulders intermittently shook. It was probably her last pride that no sobs leaked out.\u201cIt isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d\u00a0I didn\u2019t know if my words comforted her or not.\u00a0I couldn\u2019t see Yoo Sangah\u2019s heart.\u00a0Yoo Sangah started to cry. Tears flowed down her face and the skewer she was eating fell to the ground.How much more would she cry?\u00a0Little by little, her sobs died down.The 7th grade yanaspleta showed a strong sleeping effect when eaten without taking the juices.I looked at her for a while before opening my mouth.\u00a0\u201cIt really isn\u2019t your fault.\u201dThese words were for Yoo Sangah.\u201cSo\u2026\u201d\u00a0At the same time, I spoke words not directed towards Yoo Sangah.\u00a0\u201cI hope to find out who you are, how about it?\u201dIn the ruined city, the spooky cries of monsters were heard.\u00a0It seemed like I was talking to myself.\u00a0I watched Yoo Sangah while asking,\u00a0\u201cAre you going to pretend?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why you are watching me but haven\u2019t you been doing it for a while now?\u201dThe white blade of Unbroken Faith shone in the darkness.\u201cI won\u2019t hesitate to do anything to reach my purpose.\u201d\u00a0I pushed the white blade towards Yoo Sangah\u2019s throat.\u00a0\u201cYou better open your mouth quickly. Unless you want your precious incarnation to die.\u201dFrom now on, it was a game of chicken.\u00a0I waited while gradually pushing the blade towards her throat.\u00a0The blade was 1cm away from her throat and blood started flowing.\u00a0All of a sudden, Yoo Sangah\u2019s eyes shone.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 has offset your mental shock.]There was a guest of wind and I was thrown away from Yoo Sangah\u2019s body.There was a menacing presence that made my heart dull. A faint glow appeared around Yoo Sangah\u2019s body. I looked into Yoo Sangah\u2019s blurry eyes. Revolving in the pupils, the shadow of a distant nebula was seen. Then a voice like thunder burst inside my head.[Insignificant human.]I wiped the blood flowing from my mouth and grinned.\u00a0They finally appeared.\u00a0The damn constellations of Olympus.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then there was the equally famous Olympus in front of me.I told them, \u201c\u2026Pick a form. I\u2019m not a devotee.\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s expression changed.\u00a0The constellations that suddenly descended looked a bit embarrassed but I kept talking.\u201cThe probabilities in the beginning scenarios will never allow access to the gods of Olympus. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d[You\u2026!]If the probabilities didn\u2019t exist as a balance, the Seoul area would\u2019ve already been destroyed by the Olympus 12 descending. The ripple effects of the storm would be huge. Many of the gods of Olympus might look down on it but they weren\u2019t stupid.\u00a0I saw the threads of magic power wrapped around Yoo Sangah\u2019s body.\u201cIt seems that you are currently the only one who can come out, Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth.\u201dJust like Korea had great constellations, Olympus also had great constellations.\u00a0In fact, the majority of Olympus were great constellations.The Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth.\u00a0This was the modifier for Ariadne, the lover of Theseus.\u201cYou represent the lowest possible cost so Olympus must be quite stingy to send you.\u201d{Shut up! You dare!]The magic threads fluttering around her caused the ground to shake.\u00a0The ground was split apart by the momentum.Indeed, Ariadne couldn\u2019t be ignored.\u00a0No matter how weak the power of her story, she was still stronger than non-constellations.\u00a0But I knew that she couldn\u2019t attack me.Sparks flew in the air.\u00a0The shackles of probability had moved.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t a full descent but a large amount of probabilities was consumed when she deprived the will of the incarnation and partially descended.Besides, Ariadne was a constellation belonging to a big nebula.\u00a0Her movements were bound to be exposed to other powerful beings.The Great Hall in Seoul\u2019s sky was howling.\u00a0An unprecedented fear filled me and my whole body got chills.Yoo Sangah\u2019s complexion paled due to Ariadne inside her.\u201cI don\u2019t think you have much time. Shall I get straight to the point?\u201dThis was the reality of the constellations.\u00a0They were the strongest of the Star Stream but they couldn\u2019t throw off the heavy shackles of \u2018probability.\u2019\u201cThe gods of other worlds seem to have noticed you.\u201d[\u2026How can a human know this?]\u201cIs that important right now? Didn\u2019t you come to me for a reason? I don\u2019t think the constellations can endure the probability storm that will soon occur.\u201dThunder struck around the Great Hall.\u00a0As expected, it was too early for the great constellations to descend.I continued speaking,\u00a0\u201cI will ask three questions. If you answer my questions, I will answer your questions.\u201d[You want to do the three questions exchange?]\u201cYes.\u201dThe three questions exchange.\u00a0This was originally the trading style of the constellations to minimize the consumption of probability.Ariadne glared at me with disapproval.\u00a0[A human using the constellation\u2019s method of trading\u2026]\u201cAre you going to agree or not?\u201d[\u2026Wait.]Yoo Sangah\u2019s eyes closed. Perhaps Ariadne was now communicating with the other Olympus constellations through their network.[A constellation who doesn\u2019t like the excitement to be broken is interested in your proposal.]In any case, the Olympus spectators had appeared.\u00a0Ariadne finished the communication and opened her eyes.[I will allow the questions.]Then a message was heard.\u2013The Divine Three Questions and Answers has begun.\u2013Both sides will exchange three questions and answers.\u2013All questions should only be answered with the truth.\u2013Both sides can refuse to answer one question.\u2013The conversation won\u2019t end until the questions and answers are fully exchanged.\u201cI will ask first.\u201d[Okay.]\u2013The first question ticket has been used.\u201cOne, why are you in Yoo Sangah\u2019s body?\u201d[\u2026]\u201cYour home is on the other side of the continent and aren\u2019t you busy working on your scenarios? Why this place?\u201d[It is to monitor the singularities of this world.]\u2013The first answer has been received.\u201cSingularity?\u201d[Is that your second question?]Dammit, she was quite smart.\u00a0The \u2018question ticket\u2019 disappeared even when the person answered the question vaguely.\u201cNo. Now you ask.\u201d\u2013The constellation Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth has used the first question ticket.[What is your identity?]\u201cMe? I am one of the singularities you are watching.\u201d\u2013The constellation Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth has received the first answer.The embarrassed Ariadne muttered,\u00a0[\u2026How do you know this?]\u201cI just guessed I was a singularity.\u201dI was just talking but it ended up being right.\u00a0Ariadne\u2019s eyes narrowed.[You\u2026]\u201cDon\u2019t be angry. Don\u2019t you guys do it often?\u201d[A constellation who doesn\u2019t like the excitement to be broken is pleased with your wit.]Ariadne\u2019s atmosphere became filled with killing intent.\u00a0However, the \u2018Three Questions Exchange\u2019 should be done in this way. Those who answered the other person\u2019s questions straight away would only see a loss.\u00a0The questions ticket should be used in a useful way while wasting the opponent\u2019s question ticket.\u00a0This was the intense fight of the Three Questions Exchange.I continued speaking.-The second question ticket has been used.\u201cThen this is my second question. What the hell is a singularity?\u201d[It means beings like you.]Urgh, she was using her head.\u00a0However, this time I couldn\u2019t accept this much.\u201cAnswer it properly. Or do you want to keep spinning in circles?\u201d[\u2026In principle, they are the ones who appear in a \u2018divine message.\u2019]\u201cCan you tell me more? I still can\u2019t get the hang of it.\u201dAriadne thought for a moment before speaking.[We originally didn\u2019t mean to monitor you. It is just a coincidence that we found you.]\u2026A coincidence?[We were trying to monitor someone else. He carries the wheel of a giant destiny on his back and destroys the probability. A singularity is such a person.]As soon as I heard this, I understood what a \u2018singularity\u2019 was.\u2013The second answer has been received.Those from Olympus had already found Yoo Jonghyuk in this regression.\u00a0An Olympus level nebula would be able to search through the mass-produced filters and trace the information back.First of all, they had the excellent information tracker in Hermes.\u00a0In addition, the great constellations would already become aware of the deviation in the world\u2019s probabilities due to Yoo Jonghyuk\u2026However, there was something strange.\u00a0The information about the \u2018regressor\u2019 wasn\u2019t information that the current Ariadne could reach.[It is my turn for an answer.]\u2013The constellation Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth has used the second question ticket.[Who will you select in the next Sponsor Selection?]It was an unexpected question.\u00a0I didn\u2019t expect Olympus to be aiming for me.[A constellation who doesn\u2019t like the excitement to be broken is listening to you.][Some constellations that love the Korean peninsula are nervous.][The constellation Prisoner of the Golden Headband is chanting his own modifier.]It was difficult but I had no choice.\u201cI won\u2019t answer. Is it any fun if I tell you who I will pick?\u201d\u2013You have used a \u2018refusal ticket.\u2019\u2013You can\u2019t exercise the right to refuse to answer a question from now on.It seemed she had expected this as Ariadne immediately followed with a question.\u2013The constellation Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth has used the third question ticket.[Then I will ask the last question. How did you notice that we were watching?]Shit, this was her purpose from the beginning.\u00a0It was probably the result of Ariadne thinking hard.\u00a0Simply asking for my \u2018identity\u2019 didn\u2019t give an answer so she created a specific question.\u00a0I thought for a moment before opening my mouth.\u201cI read a book well.\u201d[What?]\u201cI found out after reading books.\u201dMy answer wasn\u2019t convincing but I couldn\u2019t reveal the story of Ways of Survival here. \u00a0It would all be filtered anyway, making it impossible for her to understand. In addition, I didn\u2019t want to explain.\u201cOriginally, us Koreans know the myths.\u201d[\u2026What does that mean?]\u201cYou are quite famous in my country. You are so popular that children\u2019s cartoons are produced. Don\u2019t you know that you are quite famous in my country? Is there anyone who doesn\u2019t know about Olympus?\u201dAriadne\u2019s confusion was conveyed through her shaky eyes.[It is impossible. A small country\u2026]\u201cThe Cretan labyrinth.\u201d[\u2026\u2026!]\u201cA half monster.\u201dHer eyes became bigger.\u201cThe lover who forgot you. Naxos Island. The love affair afterwards\u2026 shall I continue?\u201d[S-Stop! I understand so stop!]\u2013The constellation Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth has received the third answer.Ariadne made a completely wounded expression and closed her mouth.[How can humans in a trivial country\u2026]I inwardly sighed. I somehow succeeded in overcoming this.\u00a0Ariadne was a constellation with a low probability cost.\u00a0It was fortunate that she came out as the representative of Olympus.The movements of the Great Hall was becoming increasingly restless.I opened my mouth,\u00a0\u201cThen this is the last question. What is the content of the \u2018divine message\u2019 you received this time?\u201dAriadne worried about it for a long time while her eyes looked like she was measuring an invisible scale.[I can\u2019t tell you.]-The constellation Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth has used the refusal ticket.\u2013All questions and answers have been fully exchanged.\u2013The three questions and three answers have ended.I expected it but I felt sorry.\u00a0In fact, the last question was the most important.[A constellation who doesn\u2019t like the excitement to be broken has a taste of regret.]Ariadne looked at the lightning bolts falling from the sky and frowned.[My husband was curious about your story and I gave him a bit of entertainment, but it ends here.]Her voice started to accelerate like she realized she had no time.[I only came here for one reason. Olympus will give you a stern warning. Don\u2019t hinder our work. We are working to prevent the destruction of the world. This woman will grow into a breakwater of the great destruction.]\u201cWhy this woman?\u201d[Looking for the reason is pointless. Even the three sisters who spin the thread of fate don\u2019t know why.]Damn. Olympus used the excuse of the Fates.[Incarnation caught in the scenario. The direction of fate is turning. The stories of the stars are gathering in one place and the fate of the constellations will begin.]\u201cWhat are you talking about? Are you referring to Gigantomachia?\u201d[\u2026You even know this information. You are really amazing. But even if you know this information, you shouldn\u2019t arrogantly think that you understand everything.]The sparks around Yoo Sangah\u2019s body were reaching the limit.\u00a0It was the sign of a probability storm.[You, a puppet of the moment, will never understand. Remember. Once the time comes, if you aren\u2019t standing on the right side\u2015]At that moment, a lightning bolt struck Yoo Sangah\u2019s body and I felt Ariadne\u2019s power draining out of her.\u00a0The sound of tearing through space and time resonated and Yoo Sangah\u2019s body collapsed like a broken doll.I hurriedly grabbed Yoo Sangah\u2019s body. Then I felt someone\u2019s gaze from the sky.\u00a0I shouldn\u2019t raise my head right now.\u00a0Nobody told me this but I instinctively knew.\u00a0If I looked above me\u2026[The exclusive skill \u2018Fourth Wall\u2019 has offset your mental shock.]I looked up with confusion.\u00a0There was something in the distant Great Hall.\u00a0It was a presence that destroyed Ariadne\u2019s power.\u00a0It seemed to be a tongue or a tentacle but in the end, it didn\u2019t resemble anything.\u00a0It was a fear that was beyond language and it was unable to be comprehended.A god from another world.Time seemed to slow and sweat soaked my forehead and back. It was a flow of time filled with breathless pain.\u00a0I barely blinked and the Great Hall returned to normal. I trembled with fear. This thing was what I had to fight.I saw Han Sooyoung running towards me in the distance.\u00a0The roar of agitated monsters filled the moonlit night and the screams of humans came as they were intermittently hit by lightning.There were several scenarios related to \u2018the end.\u2019\u00a0Ragnarok. Gigantomachia. Armageddon\u2026\u00a0I didn\u2019t know what Ariadne was talking about but it was certain that something was different from what I knew.This was what I wanted.\u00a0I could never reach the end I wanted if it flowed like the original story.I carefully laid down the collapsed Yoo Sangah.\u00a0It felt like her flesh would break if I touched it.\u00a0Yoo Sangah\u2019s face was pale and she had a tight clenched fist, as if she didn\u2019t want to support her sponsor.Humans were weak.\u00a0However, there was one thing overlooked by the stars who were only afraid of a great probability.\u00a0It was that all the myths on Earth started from the weak humans they ignored.I gently touched my fist to Yoo Sangah\u2019s fist.[In the depths of your soul, the power of the \u2018story\u2019 is wriggling.][Your first stigma is ready to germinate.]I would build a \u2018story\u2019 that didn\u2019t fall to any myths.***At this time, a silver wolf was running through the darkness.\u2018Kiik\u2026\u00a0damn wolf.\u2019Parasite Queen Antinus frowned as she looked at her body. The newest body she required was an Imyuntar.Of course, it was a situation where she just survived.\u00a0Her body was torn by the probability storm and she would\u2019ve died if Lycaon hadn\u2019t been lying unconscious nearby. Her instinct of survival saved her. It was only possible because she was a parasitic species.Black blood poured from Lycaon, who was hit by a fragment of the disaster.\u00a0The guides had a body that couldn\u2019t resist the disasters. Now Antinus didn\u2019t have much time left.\u2018\u2026I need a new host.\u2019Antinus shook as she thought of the men who killed the Disaster of Questions.Those humans prevented the disaster that destroyed her planet. She was desperate in front of the unbelievable sight and decided again. She would get revenge through any means. She would exterminate the humans who destroyed her home, Chronos. At this moment, her antennae reacted.\u2018This aura?\u2019Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA familiar aura was felt. It was a power that she felt from the insect kings species found on Chronos in the past. Antinus\u2019 increased her pace.\u00a0If she infected a person with this potential, revenge wasn\u2019t impossible.Finally, Antinus reached the location and encountered an unexpected being.\u00a0She couldn\u2019t believe it.\u00a0How was this presence on Earth?\u201cK-Kieeek\u2015!\u201dShe instinctively made a sound and the boy\u2019s eyes gleamed in the moonlight.\u201cYou will be the first insect!\u201d\u00a0The boy, Lee Gilyoung laughed at Antinus.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I put out the fire and touched my forehead, which had a splitting headache.\u00a0The scene that I saw through Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint\u2026Gilyoung, I didn\u2019t know if he was okay.\u00a0\u201cWhere is Yoo Sangah-ssi?\u201d\u201cShe went to scout.\u201d\u00a0Han Sooyoung answered while touching her smartphone.I asked her, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201cA novel.\u201d\u201cYour novel?\u201d\u201cWhat other novel would I look at?\u201dIndeed, it would be strange to read other novels under these circumstances.\u201cI always wondered, is it fun for a writer to read what they wrote?\u201d\u201cIt is very fun.\u201d\u201cEven though you know all the details?\u201d\u00a0I actually asked without thinking but Han Sooyoung gave me an unexpected answer.\u201cI sometimes feel that the story is different despite reading the same thing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cA writer doesn\u2019t have complete mastery of the novel. There are many holes whenever I look back. In the end, reading is the process of keeping the irregular holes in place.\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201c\u2026It means that after some time, I can see it as someone else\u2019s writing. Ultimately, every human is their own writer.\u201dThe words were unexpected and I felt surprised.\u00a0Han Sooyoung was able to say such a difficult thing.I told her, \u201cCome to think of it, you are like that. You really wrote someone else\u2019s novel.\u201dHan Sooyoung yelled something back but I blocked my ears for a while.\u00a0Who told her to plagiarize in the first place?\u00a0Han Sooyoung turned off her smartphone and asked me,\u00a0\u201cBy the way, what are you going to do next?\u201d\u201cWhat will I do? I will wait for the start of the next scenario.\u201d\u201cWho would believe that? I\u2019m sure you have a plan.\u201dShe seemed to have something to say so I let her speak. In fact, she kept on talking anyway.\u201cYoo Jonghyuk is taking charge of the west and the Wanderer King is handling the north. What about the centre?\u201d\u201cWe will stop it all together.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there an easy method? Have you forgotten?\u201dI stopped for a moment and stared at Han Sooyoung.\u00a0\u201cDid you copy that as well?\u201d\u201c\u2026When did I do that? I just came up with it in my novel.\u201d\u00a0Han Sooyoung fumbled with her words while pouting.\u00a0\u201cIn any case, aren\u2019t I right? As far as I know, there is an easy way to prevent the disaster in the centre.\u201dCertainly, her words were right.\u00a0If we did that, we could clear the fifth scenario and prevent all disasters without difficulty. Han Sooyoung looked at me with piercing eyes.\u00a0\u201cAre you going to do it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 let\u2019s think about it on the way.\u201dI looked around and saw Yoo Sangah waving her hand in the distance. Han Sooyoung grumbled,\u00a0\u201cWhy do you look so happy after seeing her?\u201d\u201cIt is because she is a trustworthy person.\u201d\u201cChe. Untrustworthy people will survive.\u201dWe set out again.\u00a0There were five days remaining until the start of the scenario.\u00a0We moved west along the Han River.There were two purposes behind this.\u00a0One was to look for the missing Gong Pildu around Han River and the second was to collect coins from nearby monsters.\u00a0More than anything else, it was currently a coin event so I should gain as much as possible.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, to the left! Han Sooyoung, take the lead!\u201dWe hunted all the visible 7th grade monsters.\u00a0Once Yoo Sangah joined us, we were able to hunt 7th grade species and even 6th grade. I had a thought while watching Yoo Sangah.Maybe she didn\u2019t know about those from Olympus.\u00a0I called them out to figure out their intentions.\u00a0They had used up their assigned probability and couldn\u2019t interfere with Yoo Sangha for the time being. The battle ended and I approached Yoo Sangah.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi. You should only use one stigma at a time in the future.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. Was I a big problem last time?\u201d\u201cNo, that isn\u2019t the reason.\u201dThe people supported by a nebula were special.\u00a0Of course, being sponsored by a nebula didn\u2019t mean all constellations in the nebula would support her. However, the laws of the Star Stream applied to the constellations and incarnations.The price for going against the laws would eventually be returned to the constellations and incarnations. The constellations might have a way to escape but the problem was the incarnations.\u201cUsing multiple stigmas will place a burden on Yoo Sangah-ssi\u2019s body.\u201dThe damn Olympians wouldn\u2019t tell her this but there was a limit to the story that a single being could afford.\u00a0Every stigma contained the history of the constellation and the random blend of histories would impair the human spirit.If Yoo Sangah borrowed the stigmas of a large number of constellations, her remaining vitality would be reduced in an instant.\u00a0Then in probably one year\u2026Yoo Sangah smiled faintly.\u00a0\u201cThank you for your concern.\u201dI realized something and opened my mouth.\u00a0\u201cDid you already know?\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s eyes moved downwards and she spoke quietly,\u00a0\u201cDokja-ssi, do you still think that I\u2019m a competent office worker?\u201dYoo Sangah continued speaking.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m different from Dokja-ssi. I can\u2019t do anything in this changed world. This is a world where the TOEIC, degrees and service scores are useless.\u201dI wondered, \u201cDo you think everything can be resolved if you become stronger?\u201d\u201cA little bit.\u201dHer words were correct.\u00a0In fact, strength only made up for some of the world\u2019s problems.\u201cI have decided to build up useful specifications of this world. That is the only thing I can do.\u201dThere were numerous wounds on the back of Yoo Sangah\u2019s hand as she spoke.\u00a0The wounds felt like a big hole for me. Han Sooyoung had said, \u2018In the end, reading is the process of keeping the irregular holes in place.\u2019If there was something a reader had to do, I needed to read it properly.\u00a0I felt a vibration in my arms.\u00a0I opened my smartphone and saw that there was a notification window.\u2013Han Donghoon:\u00a0\u00a0Hyung, are you okay?The Hermit King of Shadows, Han Donghoon.\u00a0I was stunned when I read the message.\u2013Han Donghoon:\u00a0\u00a0I haven\u2019t been able to connect to the Internet recently so the messages are delayed.\u00a0I am struggling with my ability\u2026He had been sending messages for a long time and they stacked up.\u00a0It seemed the piled up messages arrived at the same time once the Internet connected.I showed the messages to Yoo Sangah in order to change her mood.\u00a0I looked at Yoo Sangah\u2019s smile and thought.I wasn\u2019t a completely incompetent reader.***I connected to Han Donghoon through the messenger but I could hear news about other people through it.\u2013Han Donghoon:\u00a0\u00a0I am on the Yongsan-gu side.\u00a0There is also Gilyoung.-Kim Dokja:\u00a0Gilyoung is there?\u2013Han Donghoon:\u00a0\u00a0Yes.The location of my main party were roughly grasped.\u00a0Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon\u2019s positions were also confirmed through Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint.I was a bit curious about what happened to Jung Minseob and Lee Sungkook but it was difficult to care about them. They had some prior knowledge so they should manage.\u00a0Lee Jihye\u2026 well, Yoo Jonghyuk would take care of it.-Kim Dokja:\u00a0For the time being, don\u2019t leave Yongsan.\u00a0I\u2019ll be there soon.\u00a0If possible, try contacting other people.A reply didn\u2019t come back.\u00a0Perhaps it had disconnected again.\u00a0I looked around at the party members and said,\u00a0\u201cI think we\u2019ll have to cross the river.\u201dCurrently, we were south of Han River. North of Han River was Yongsan-gu.\u201cWe have to cross that?\u201d\u00a0Han Sooyoung asked me with a dumbfounded expression.It wasn\u2019t strange. I looked at Han River with her.\u00a0Flickering shadows could be seen from the swirling water.\u00a0The ichthyosaurs that had travelled near Dongho Bridge had once again filled Han River.\u00a0We had been following the river but I never thought of crossing because of them.\u201cHave you seen Cheonho Bridge? It is broken.\u201dThe ichthyosaur was a 7th grade monster species. It wasn\u2019t a problem to hunt but there were too many.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t just one or two so it would take a few days to deal with all of them. We were going to cross Han River in such a situation? It was unthinkable.\u201cWe will move along the river. There might be a place that isn\u2019t broken.\u201dWe moved along the river for several hours but an intact bridge couldn\u2019t be found.\u00a0Instead, we found a group of wanderers.Han Sooyoung was going to raise her weapon but Yoo Sangah moved first. She took meat out of her backpack, making Han Sooyoung irritated.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cThe people are hungry.\u201d\u201cSo what? You want to share that? Are you crazy? Don\u2019t you know that people are the most dangerous existences in an apocalypse?\u201d\u201cI can kill all of them if I want.\u201d\u00a0Han Sooyoung saw killing intent for a moment on Yoo Sangah\u2019s face and shut her mouth.\u00a0\u201cTherefore, I can save all of them if I want.\u201dYoo Sangah took the meat from the monsters and distributed it to the people.\u00a0Some people felt sorry and bowed to her.\u201cAh, this\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is just leftovers. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dI left Han Sooyoung alone and pulled a yanaspleta stem out of my bag.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t possible for everyone to become a \u2018hunter\u2019 in this world.\u00a0By now, there would be a great deal of research about the monster species all over the world.\u00a0The man who received the plant from me bowed deeply.\u201cAh! Thank you\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Difficulties should be shared.\u201dOf course, I was essentially a different person from Yoo Sangah.

Yoo Sangah was like the heroine of a novel even before the fall of the world.\u00a0Now that reality had become a novel\u2026From among the crowd, a child approached me.\u00a0She was a young girl around the same age as Gilyoung.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dThe girl who bowed had a Western look. Her eyes were bright and her face was full of an exotic cuteness.\u00a0\u00a0The child bowed 90 degrees towards me.\u201cThank you.\u201dShe was a very polite child. I looked around but didn\u2019t see anyone who looked like this child\u2019s parents. The child noticed my gaze and said,\u00a0\u201cThey aren\u2019t here anymore.\u201d\u201cBoth of them?\u201d\u00a0The child nodded.I was a bit confused.\u00a0A child without a guardian survived alone until the fifth scenario.\u00a0It was almost impossible in Ways of Survival.\u2026Wait a minute?\u00a0The moment I used Character List, the child spoke again,\u00a0\u201cThen I\u2019ll be going.\u201dDid she come just to thank me?\u00a0I tried to grab the child and reflexively looked back at Han Sooyoung.\u00a0She happened to be looking elsewhere.\u201c\u2026Be careful.\u201dIt would soon be dark.\u00a0I worried for a moment before summoning the party members together.\u201cWe will rest here today.\u201dWe looked for a place to sleep. Han River was cold even when we lit a fire, so we decided to use a partially destroyed building. Han Sooyoung became firmly determined and warned Yoo Sangah.\u201cJust watch. Those people from earlier will be back. Didn\u2019t you see them covet our weapons? They will clearly bite the hand that fed them.\u201dHan Sooyoung declared that all humans were wicked and trash who would repay goodness with malice. I carefully looked at Yoo Sangah who said,\u00a0\u201cNot every person in the apocalypse is bad.\u201d\u201cNo, they are all bad. Almost everyone is bad.\u201dOne hour passed.\u201cThey\u2019ll come soon. Then you will be crying.\u201dTwo hours passed.\u201cUm, they are patient people.\u201dThree hours passed.\u201c\u2026Is this possible?\u201dFinally, four hours later, noises started to be heard outside.\u00a0Yoo Sangah\u2019s expression darkened and Han Sooyoung smiled with satisfaction.\u201cLook, what did I say?\u201dHan Sooyoung had just taken out her weapon when someone entered the building.\u201cH-Hello?\u201dHan Sooyoung stopped as she was about to get up.\u00a0The one who came was a young girl.\u00a0It was the child who politely thanked me during the day.\u00a0The little red-eyed child held something out.\u201cT-This\u2026\u201dIt was a blanket.\u00a0She must\u2019ve grabbed it from the area because she was afraid we were cold.\u00a0Han Sooyoung made a surprised expression while Yoo Sangah looked blank.\u00a0In the apocalypse, goodwill wasn\u2019t always repaid with malice.[The constellation \u2018Demon-like Judge of Fire\u2019 is making a loving smile.][2,000 coins have been sponsored.]Yoo Sangah acted as the representative of the party.\u00a0\u201cThank you, I\u2019ll use it well.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cBy the way, are you alone? It is dangerous to wander around at night.\u201d\u201cIt is the same everywhere.\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s expression darkened at the words.\u00a0\u201cWould you like to stay with us?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIt will be fine if you are with us.\u201dYoo Sangah looked at me like she was asking for permission.\u00a0However, the child\u2019s answer was faster.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a nuisance.\u201dIt happened when the child was trying to run away.\u00a0A flag flew from somewhere and fell in front of the child\u2019s feet. The frightened child feel down and Han Sooyoung\u2019s scathing voice followed.\u201cWait a minute. You can\u2019t leave.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing right now?\u201d\u00a0Yoo Sangah looked at Han Sooyoung and spoke in a cold voice. However, Han Sooyoung was looking at me.\u201cKim Dokja, don\u2019t you know what to do? Isn\u2019t that why you wanted to sleep here?\u201dI slowly closed my eyes.\u00a0Damn, she had noticed\u2026 It was a miscalculation. I didn\u2019t know this person could use Detect Attributes. Han Sooyoung asked,\u00a0\u201cAh, are you going to act as a hypocrite? Is it because the other person is a child?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe other person is a child? Then the villain must solve it.\u201dHan Sooyoung approached and Yoo Sangah blocked the way.\u201cStop.\u201d\u201cGet out of the way. Do you want me to kill you?\u201d\u201cWhy are you killing an ordinary kid all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cAn ordinary kid?\u201d\u00a0Han Sooyoung laughed and pointed towards the child.\u201cI told you to stop.\u201d\u00a0At the same time, Yoo Sangah\u2019s dagger pointed to Han Sooyoung\u2019s neck. Then Han Sooyoung summoned dozens of avatars. Han Sooyoung grumbled.\u201cKim Dokja, explain it quickly. Before I turn around and kill everyone.\u201dIt ended up like this.\u00a0I sighed and opened my mouth.\u00a0\u201cThis child\u2026\u201dThe child looked up at me with innocent eyes and I felt a sense of urgency.\u201c\u2026Five days later, she will destroy Seoul.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYoo Sangah\u2019s eyes shook.\u00a0If Han Sooyoung hadn\u2019t found out, I might\u2019ve let it pass by but now it couldn\u2019t be helped.\u00a0This damn scenario never gave us the happy endings we wanted.[The constellation \u2018Abyssal Black Flame Dragon\u2019 is smiling.][Many constellations are interested in the development of this scenario.]It had been a long time since the messages of the constellations seemed so hateful.\u201cThis child is the last disaster of the fifth scenario.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The child was temporarily frozen with Hit a Pressure Point. Yoo Sangah stroked the sleeping child\u2019s hair and spoke in a dark voice.\u201cShe is a disaster?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi, do you know this with your ability?\u201d\u201cIt is something similar.\u201dI recalled a sentence from Ways of Survival.\u300c The final disaster of the fifth scenario.

Yet this child didn\u2019t come from a meteorite\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct. This child didn\u2019t hatch from a meteorite. She was born and raised on Earth. She will still be a human of Earth in five days.\u201d\u201cThen why\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Disaster of Questions was originally from Earth.\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0\u201cThis child is like the Disaster of Questions\u2026\u201d\u201cYes and no.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dAll disasters from Earth were returnees. They were destroyers who wiped out another world and returned. This child could be called a returnee because she destroyed Chronos. However, that wasn\u2019t all.Among the five disasters of Chronos, this child was special.\u00a0She was also the most dangerous.\u201cThe one who will cause the disaster isn\u2019t this child, but her future self.\u201d\u201cHer future self?\u201d\u201cThis child came back from decades in the future to finish off Earth.\u201dThe sweet and innocent child would become one of the most terrible disasters of this world in the future.\u201cThat is why Han Sooyoung said to kill this child. If we kill this child now, we can eliminate her \u2018future\u2019.\u201dA disaster that even Yoo Jonghyuk couldn\u2019t stop.***\u300c Yoo Jonghyuk looked at the empty hole in his chest. It was a wound that couldn\u2019t be healed without using Recovery immediately. He angrily asked the woman who made the wound.\u201cShin Yoosung. Why\u2026 have you thoughts changed?\u201d\u201cChanged? I didn\u2019t change.\u201d\u00a0Shin Yoosung laughed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not a regressor like Captain. I\u2019m just a toy stuck in the cogs of the scenario. I have the same personality as the \u2018disasters\u2019 that Captain has met in the past.\u201d\u201cThen why\u2026\u201d\u201cIs this currently your third regression? I must\u2019ve given you a chance in the second regression. Yet Captain once again failed. I gave you so much information but you failed again.\u201dShin Yoosung smiled sadly at the blank-looking Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201cYou can\u2019t change the world. Many things are still intact and nothing has changed.\u201d\u00a0Shin Yoosung spoke while looking up at the Great Hall in the sky.\u00a0\u201cThus, I thought about it. Indeed, this world should end here.\u201d \u300dMy old emotional state came back as I read Ways of Survival again.\u00a0This was the taste of Ways of Survival.\u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201d\u00a0I heard a voice and turned off my smartphone. It was Han Sooyoung and she asked, \u201cWhat did you decide?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still thinking.\u201dHan Sooyoung frowned at the indecision in my voice.\u00a0She whispered while paying attention to Yoo Sangah and Shin Yoosung.\u00a0\u201cHave you forgotten? Yoo Jonghyuk almost died because of the last disaster in the third regression.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t die.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. The important thing is that we can\u2019t win in a frontal battle.\u201dHan Sooyoung\u2019s words were true.\u00a0The third round Yoo Jonghyuk actually ended up dying because of Shin Yoosung.\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t killed him then the Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon could\u2019ve\u2026\u201dUnfortunately, this time there wasn\u2019t the Delusional Demon to kill the young Shin Yoosung.\u201cI certainly said that I am opposed to it.

If we take good care of her now, perhaps the disaster won\u2019t happen? Like the butterfly effect\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t without reason.\u00a0The person who came to this world was the \u2018future Shin Yoosung.\u2019\u00a0This world was the \u2018first world\u2019 that created the future Shin Yoosung.In other words, if we changed the present Shin Yoosung then the disaster might not come. It was theoretically possible.\u00a0It was the same as killing Shin Yoosung to prevent the disaster. However, there was a problem.\u201cThe event that makes this child a disaster happens in the distant future. It won\u2019t be affected by anything we do now.\u201dThe butterfly effect didn\u2019t happen that easily.\u00a0A butterfly flapping its wings in the Pacific Ocean would cause a typhoon on the other side of the world?It was theoretically possible.\u00a0The important thing was the time it took for the wings to become the \u2018typhoon.\u2019Yoo Sangah\u2019s expression became grouchy.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t know that\u2026\u201d\u201cOnce again, it isn\u2019t possible at this time. Even if we change the kid, the disaster that will come in five days won\u2019t change.\u201dIn fact, Yoo Jonghyuk had attempted it several times in \u00a0the mid to late regressions. The first thing he did was find Shin Yoosung and try to prevent her from becoming a disaster. He failed every time. No matter what changes were made to the Shin Yoosung in the present, the future Shin Yoosung would return in five days.\u00a0Then she destroyed Seoul.Yoo Sangah voice gradually weakened.\u00a0\u201cWhy is this child a disaster? What happened in the future?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dI naturally knew the answer but I didn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0Instead, I walked towards the child who was eating meat and asked,\u00a0\u201cIs it delicious?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dI could feel Yoo Sangah and Han Sooyoung watching me from a distance.\u2018No.\u2019\u2018Kill her.\u2019\u2018I won\u2019t let it happen.\u2019\u2018Kill.\u2019In fact, killing Shin Yoosung wouldn\u2019t damage the important part of the ending point. If I didn\u2019t kill Shin Yoosung now, the slightest mistake meant Seoul would be destroyed.Looking in the short-term, saving Shin Yoosung would only bring damages.\u00a0Shin Yoosung ate the meat and looked at me with unknown eyes.\u00a0\u201cAhjussi, can you see the future?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 am I a bad person in the future?\u201dPerhaps she heard our conversation.\u00a0I replied quietly, \u201cPerhaps.\u201d\u201cHow bad am I?\u201d\u201cYou are probably the worst person in Seoul.\u201d\u201cAs bad as Joker or Thanos?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dShin Yoosung lowered her head.\u00a0\u201cIt isn\u2019t unusual.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI am already a bad person.\u201dShe didn\u2019t have to tell me why.\u00a0I already knew how Shin Yoosung was able to survive in this world.[Your understanding of the character \u2018Shin Yoosung\u2019 has increased.][Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint stage 2 has been activated!]\u300c I killed him. \u300dShe killed her dog in order to survive the first scenario.\u300c I\u2019m sorry. \u300dShe stole a coat from an old man who collapsed from an attack.\u00a0She killed a woman who always looked after her to protect her own green zone.\u00a0She handed over a person chased by someone in order to get food.In this world, everyone was forced to commit crimes.\u00a0Not everyone could rationalize such things.\u300c I will be punished.

A sponsor who couldn\u2019t give their incarnation a stigma was just a hindrance, although I had a lot more money than a decent sponsor.[Many constellations are curious about your choice.][Some constellations think that your actions are ridiculous.]The reaction of the constellations to my incarnation was split into two.\u00a0Those who liked me were the \u2018incarnation seekers\u2019 while those who disliked me were the \u2018amusement seekers.\u2019Of course, there was one constellation who was unclear.[The constellation Secretive Plotter is watching your strategy with interest.][1,000 coins have been sponsored.]I thought he was ordinary when I first saw the modifier but I recently changed my mind. The average size of his sponsorship was too large. This constellation was at least \u2018narrative\u2019 grade. However, no matter how much I searched through Ways of Survival, I couldn\u2019t see the name Secretive Plotter at all.This meant he wasn\u2019t a constellation of this world or he wasn\u2019t properly handled in Ways of Survival. Who was it?Wooong.\u00a0Since last night, Shin Yoosung had been practicing her skills in one corner of the abandoned building.\u00a0Shin Yoosung used the magic power recovery potions that I gave her and kept using a skill on the nearby young groll.A faint aura stretched out from Shin Yoosung and touched the skin of a groll.\u00a0This was the power of Diverse Communication that I saw from Lee Gilyoung.I looked down at Shin Yoosung who had dark circles under her eyes.\u00a0\u201cYoosung, have you slept?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know the penalty for not sleeping? Go to sleep.\u201d\u201cJust a bit more.\u201d[The character \u2018Shin Yoosung\u2019 has used \u2018Diverse Communication Lv. 8.\u2019][The character \u2018Shin Yoosung\u2019 has used \u2018Taming Lv. 7\u2019]Shin Yoosung\u2019s concentration soon disappeared.[Taming has failed!][The monster has started to run wild!]The groll broke away from the control and rushed towards Shin Yoosung. Before I could move, the drooling Han Sooyoung sleeping nearby acted.\u00a0The groll stopped breathing as it slammed into a wall of the abandoned building.\u00a0 \u00a0Han Sooyoung fell asleep again.I spoke to Shin Yoosung, who was controlling her breathing with a dejected face.\u00a0\u201cDo you understand now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0Shin Yoosung made a gloomy expression.[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]The abridged version.+[Character List]Name: Shin YoosungPrivate Attribute: Beast Tamer (Rare), Reflexive Killer (General)Exclusive Skills: Taming Lv. 7, Diverse Communication Lv. 8, Agile Feet Lv. 8, Hybridization Lv. 6.Stigma: NoneOverall Stats: Physique Lv. 19, Strength Lv. 14, Agility Lv. 44, Magic Power Lv. 45* Growth Package I is currently applied.* Growth Package II is currently applied.* The New Scenario Commemorative Package is currently applied.+Her skills growth rate was enormous thanks to the growth package I bought her.There was also the New Scenario Commemorative Package that promoted the evolution of stats. I didn\u2019t know if any incarnation on the Korean peninsula had received such package support.She was a talented person so Diverse Communication would soon break through the 10th level and become Advanced Diverse Communication.The problem was that she couldn\u2019t properly tame the 8th grade groll despite her stats. This should be impossible thanks to the help of the system. Shin Yoosung bowed her head like she was embarrassed.\u00a0\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t have any talent.\u201dIf she didn\u2019t have talent then I should just kill myself.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You have talent. \u201d\u00a0I couldn\u2019t let my precious incarnation become frustrated.\u00a0Perhaps Shin Yoosung couldn\u2019t use it properly because of her trauma.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you thinking of?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t hard to guess why she was scared. I told her,\u00a0\u201cThe monsters aren\u2019t pets.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cStill, it might be okay to make one a companion. They are durable and strong.\u201dShin Yoosung was someone who killed her dog with her own hands.\u00a0It was to survive.\u00a0This fact still remained deep in this child\u2019s heart.\u00a0I thought for a moment before saying, \u201cDid you know?\u00a0If all the scenarios are cleared, you can make a wish\u2026\u201d\u201cAhjussi\u2019s face changes when you lie. Your nostrils become larger.\u201dThis reminded me of Gilyoung.\u00a0Perhaps the children with Diverse Communication were more sensitive to body language.\u00a0I decide to go forward like a gangster.\u00a0\u201c\u2026What do you want to ask?\u201d\u201cCan I do it?\u201d\u201cYou can do it.\u201d\u201cYou are speaking without any sincerity.\u201d\u201cI chose you.\u201d\u00a0Shin Yoosung\u2019s eyes shook at my words.\u00a0\u201cI chose you instead of Seoul. I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can do better than anyone else.\u201dShin Yoosung looked up at me as she squeezed her fingers together. Then she started to tear up.\u00a0\u201cAhjusshi, if I really become strong\u2026\u201d\u201cStrong?\u201dShin Yoosung hesitated for a moment before laughing.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I will try hard.\u201dThen Shin Yoosung turned around and used the skill again.\u00a0I suddenly remembered something.\u00a0I recalled the type of person Shin Yoosung was like in the original novel.\u300c \u201cJonghyuk oppa is handsome.\u201d \u300d\u300c \u201cJonghyuk oppa is the best.\u201d \u300d\u300c \u201cI like Jonghyuk oppa the most.\u201d \u300d\u2026This girl, she was a fan of Yoo Jonghyuk in Ways of Survival.\u00a0Of course, she wasn\u2019t a heroine candidate. Due to her age, she was in the younger sister position.\u00a0I remember her having a big fight with Yoo Mia\u2026I suddenly became a bit worried.\u00a0Would I lose the person I worked so hard to raise to Yoo Jonghyuk?I suddenly turned my head to where Han Sooyoung was stretching as she woke up. Han Sooyoung noticed my gaze and turned away.\u00a0This girl, she had been sulking since yesterday.I called out to her. \u201cHey.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAre you going to keep sulking?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me.\u201d\u201cThere is something I want to ask you.\u201dHan Sooyoung raised an eyebrow at my words.\u00a0I lowered my voice so that Shin Yoosung couldn\u2019t hear and asked,\u00a0\u201cWhat do you think about my looks? Especially when compared to Yoo Jonghyuk.\u201dHan Sooyoung looked at me like bugs had entered her ears.\u00a0\u201cWhy the hell are you asking me this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just purely curious.\u201dI had never been interested in what I looked like since I graduated from high school.\u00a0Then I thought about the reactions of the prophets when I pretended to be Yoo Jonghyuk and it seemed that I was ugly.\u00a0I didn\u2019t think I was ugly when I took occasional selfies in the bathroom.[A windy constellation is looking at you like you are pathetic.]She replied, \u201cAccept your fate.\u201d\u201cNo, I really am just curious\u2026\u201d\u201cAll I can do now is cheer you up.\u201dShit.\u201c\u2026To that extent?\u201dI quietly looked at Shin Yoosung and made up my mind.\u00a0I could never let her meet Yoo Jonghyuk.\u2019***We hunted the monsters around us and collected the coins.\u00a0I invested the collected coins into Shin Yoosung, causing her stats to grow remarkably fast.The coins were primarily used for agility and magic power.\u00a0It was to maximize the advantages of Agile Feet, Taming and Diverse Communication.By the time night came again, Shin Yoosung finally learnt Advanced Diverse Communication. However, the Taming skill still didn\u2019t succeed. Shin Yoosung asked, \u201cThe future me will be much stronger?\u201dOf course. The current Shin Yoosung was no match for the future Shin Yoosung in a frontal battle.However, if she trained intensively then she could seal one of future Shin Yoosung\u2019s important abilities. The Disaster of Floods was dangerous because she could lead an army by herself.\u201cI believe in you more than the future that hasn\u2019t come yet.\u201dIf the future Shin Yoosung could do it then it was a possibility for the present Shin Yoosung.\u00a0Besides, there was a chance of winning if she confronted her future.\u00a0It was because the future Shin Yoosung could never kill the present Shin Yoosung.\u201cI ate well.\u201d\u00a0Yoo Sangah gave a short prayer after eating the groll meat and cleaning up its bones.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi is religious?\u201d\u201cNo I\u2019m not.\u201d\u201cThen why pray\u2026\u201d\u201cI did it for the gods of Olympus.\u201dIt was such a realistic prayer that I was dumbfounded.\u00a0That reminded me. The gods we knew had become reality and the objects of our prayers were no clear.\u201cToday Han Sooyoung and I will stand guard first. Yoo Sangah can sleep.\u201d\u201cIs it okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dYoo Sangah lay down and fell asleep first. \u00a0Han Sooyoung leaned against the wall opposite her and messed around with her smartphone.It was natural to be uncomfortable.\u00a0They were enemies by nature. Han Sooyoung\u2019s ideas were the opposite of Yoo Sangah\u2019s ideals.\u00a0No matter what happened in the future, the two of them would be more antagonistic than friendly.The tired Shin Yoosung had fallen asleep and only embers remained of the fire. Han Sooyoung spoke first.\u00a0\u201cYou sleep too.\u201dI lay on the floor but sleep didn\u2019t come easily.\u00a0There were four days left until the start of the fifth scenario.\u00a0Shin Yoosung hadn\u2019t made any new progress today but a message came from the Gangseo area this afternoon.[Someone has dealt with the Disaster of Ice that came from the west.]This was the message.\u00a0I didn\u2019t have to ask who killed the disaster.\u00a0Yoo Jonghyuk had prevented the disaster that would\u2019ve caused Seoul to become an Ice Age.\u00a0Perhaps he had met up with Lee Hyunsung.Han Sooyoung was watching the embers when she suddenly opened her mouth.\u00a0\u201cHey, I have a question.\u201d\u201cYou are ugly.\u201dHan Sooyoung frowned.\u00a0\u201cWho is wondering about that? You bastard.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then what is it?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d\u201cWhat do I want to do?\u201d\u201cWhat is your purpose? I think it is strange every time I see you. You shattered the throne and didn\u2019t kill me. What do you want?\u201d\u201cI have a desired ending.\u201d\u201cEnding?\u201dI nodded lightly. Unexpectedly, Han Sooyoung didn\u2019t ask anything else. Instead, she spoke about something else.\u00a0\u201cThere was an ending I wanted to write.\u201d\u201cFor your novel?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen let me ask you something.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWhy did you plagiarize? You write well.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t plagiarism. Do you think that Ways of Survival is like the Bible? Aren\u2019t the ideas everywhere? The sponsorship of transcendent beings. Survival missions. A protagonist who regressed. Isn\u2019t it harder to find a novel that doesn\u2019t have one of these ideas nowadays?\u201d\u201cIt is because yours is the closest.\u201d\u201cThere is a reason for that. Shall I tell you a story? In the past, there was a poor girl\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is a story of a literary girl living in poverty who became frustrated with her dream and eventually plagiarized a novel for food and living.\u201dHan Sooyoung\u2019s mouth gaped open.\u00a0\u201cCan you actually read someone\u2019s mind?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cAnyway, something like that is possible. Right?\u201d\u201cWhat type of god do you think I am? I wouldn\u2019t be suffering like this if I had that skill.\u201d[The character \u2018Han Sooyoung\u2019 has used \u2018Lie Detection Lv. 3\u2019.][The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that the statement is false.]Han Sooyoung laughed.\u00a0\u201cIs it possible for me?\u201dI didn\u2019t answer.\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to tell me. In any case, if possible please read my mind right now.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t read it.\u201d\u201cIn fact, I didn\u2019t plagiarize.\u201dI looked at Han Sooyoung suspiciously and she used Lie Detection on herself.[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that the statement is true.]\u2026What?\u201cIt is just a coincidence that the story I wrote was similar to Ways of Survival. I just wrote according to the dreams I had.\u201d[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that the statement is true.]\u2026This girl was using her subconscious as a shield.\u201cIn any case, you saw it. It was a dream to you.\u201d\u201cMaybe that is true. Then\u2026\u201d\u00a0Han Sooyoung hesitated before saying, \u201cSometimes I think about it.\u201d\u201cThink about what?\u201d\u201cIf this reality is the original and I only reproduced the original then I might\u2019ve plagiarized\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying? Then you did plagiarize?\u201d\u201cWho said that? I said it was just a thought.\u201dIn fact, I didn\u2019t mean it. It was a thought I had from the moment Ways of Survival became reality.Was this world overlaid on a novel?\u00a0Or was reality turning into a novel?I stood up and shook my head.\u00a0\u201cHey, let\u2019s change the shift. Go ahead and sleep. The constellations on my channel will be reduced if I keep listening to such a painful story.\u201d\u201cMy constellation support has reduced because I\u2019ve been with you lately.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat\u2019s because you keep doing cancerous things.\u201dWe shot a few more barbs at each other before shutting up. I leaned against the wall of the building and looked at the snoring Han Sooyoung.I suddenly had a thought.\u00a0Perhaps I was a bit lucky that she was here.\u00a0At least I wasn\u2019t alone in knowing that this world was a \u2018novel.\u2019At some point, I fell asleep.\u00a0It might be because I was too tired or perhaps I was distracted by the unexpected comfort. \u00a0It was a short but sweet sleep. However, perhaps I shouldn\u2019t have fallen asleep.When I opened my eyes the next day, Han Sooyoung was a cold corpse.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then was it a poison?\u00a0If there was a poison that could kill Han Sooyoung without leaving any traces then it was a terrible poison.However, such a poison couldn\u2019t be released now.\u00a0That wasn\u2019t the only problem.\u00a0Why was only Han Sooyoung poisoned while the rest were safe?\u00a0Even if there was a person with such a poison, there was no reason to only poison Han Sooyoung.It was strange that I suddenly feel asleep in the first place.\u2026Wait a minute, I fell asleep?\u201cUh, I\u2019m sorry. I slept too much.\u201d\u00a0Shin Yoosung finally opened her eyes.I suddenly looked back at Yoo Sangah.\u00a0\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi, did you sleep all night?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dYoo Sangah blushed like she was embarrassed. If Yoo Sangah hadn\u2019t woken up then no one was standing guard yesterday. I was the last lookout and once I fell asleep, everyone was sleeping.I was a fool.\u00a0My suspicions should\u2019ve started from \u2018Why did I sleep?\u2019 rather than \u2018Who killed Han Sooyoung?\u2019Was it a sleeping spell?\u00a0No, only returnee had such magic.\u00a0\u00a0Hit a Pressure Point?\u00a0They must be able to fool my senses to use it.In the end, there was only one answer remaining.\u00a0I approached the fire where the bones of the groll I ate yesterday was hanging.This was the only possibility for everyone falling asleep.\u00a0I cleared up the bones that were eaten cleanly of their flesh and some green powder fell to the ground.\u2018It is the stem of the yanaspleta.\u2019It was as expected. There was only one reason for this being here. Someone had mixed the plant stem powder into the groll meat. The stem of the yanaspleta had a powerful sleeping effect if not taken with the juices. It wasn\u2019t poisonous so it couldn\u2019t be resolved with Dongui Bogam. That\u2019s why I always boiled it with the juices.\u201cWho cooked the groll yesterday?\u201d\u201cIt was Sooyoung-ssi\u2026\u201dI inwardly sighed.\u00a0The meat I ate yesterday was the young groll that Shin Yoosung failed to tame. The one who killed the groll was none other than Han Sooyoung.\u201cIt was one blow.\u201dI approached the pale body of Han Sooyoung.\u00a0I was so confused that I had forgotten for a while.\u00a0An avatar didn\u2019t vanish unless the head was destroyed.However, why did she set up this play?\u00a0She was bound by the \u2018Temporary Pledge\u2019 and couldn\u2019t run away.\u00a0At that moment, a blue light emerged from Han Sooyoung\u2019s heart.\u00a0This was\u2026?\u201cWait a bit.\u201dI didn\u2019t care about the reaction of the others and trampled on Han Sooyoung\u2019s head. The blue light burst out and the avatar was destroyed.[The character Han Sooyoung\u2019s avatar has received the punishment for violating the contract.][The character Han Sooyoung has offered up her avatar as a sacrifice to offset most of the punishment of the Temporary Pledge.]\u201cAh\u2026\u201dYoo Sangah let out a groan as if she realized something.\u00a0I had no idea the avatar had such an effect.\u00a0I had seen it receive damage on behalf of the original but I didn\u2019t know it could take the contract\u2019s punishment.\u00a0It looked like only some of the punishment was offset but Han Sooyoung wouldn\u2019t die.Shin Yoosung asked,\u00a0\u201cThat unni went away?\u201d\u201cIt seems so.\u201dThe question of why was meaningless.\u00a0Once I thought about it, Han Sooyoung didn\u2019t have much to do with me.-My constellation support has reduced because I\u2019ve been with you lately.I would soon meet with the people of Chungmuro and they would be hostile to Han Sooyoung, just like Yoo Sangah.Che. A person who couldn\u2019t be trusted would live in misery.\u00a0Han Sooyoung would be alone, surrounded by enemies. For a moment, I mistook her for a companion.There were some coins and a piece of paper in the place where the avatar turned into white powder.\u2013The value of the meals.This was how she said goodbye.\u00a0As if to turn the time we spent together into nothing, her avatar was blown away by the strong winds of Han River.Still, I was curious about why Han Sooyoung stayed with me for so long despite being able to use \u2018Surrogate Death\u2019 through her avatars.I didn\u2019t know.\u00a0I couldn\u2019t read Yoo Sangah or Han Sooyoung\u2019s mind.\u00a0Ways of Survival, which explained everything, didn\u2019t tell me this.\u201cWe should get up.\u201dThen a strange sensation overcame me.\u00a0Was it Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint?\u00a0I instinctively looked in the direction that I felt it but couldn\u2019t see anything.\u2026Was I mistaken?***\u201cA fool.\u201dHan Sooyoung looked at the abandoned building from a distant high-rise building. The wind of Han River permeated through her ripped jeans and was cold. She bit her lip and muttered.\u201c\u2026Shouldn\u2019t you pretend to feel something?\u201dHowever, she knew he couldn\u2019t do that.\u00a0It was natural.\u00a0He was as much a \u2018reader\u2019 as she was.She turned on her notepad and started to type something.\u00a0It was the habit of an author to write it down when inspiration struck.\u300c Reading a book doesn\u2019t mean you will understand people. \u300d\u2018I will see you again.\u2019She didn\u2019t know the ending that Kim Dokja wanted.\u00a0However, they would surely meet again as long as they kept moving towards the end.\u300c She didn\u2019t know if they would be enemies or not the next time they met. \u300dHan Sooyoung covered her smartphone and started walking.***The morning hours passed quickly.That afternoon, Shin Yoosung\u2019s agility and magic power reached the scenario limit of level 60. I felt that it was time and bought the Sponsor Contract from Bihyung. Bihyung grumbled but still gave me the contract.[\u2026You do know that this won\u2019t change the disaster?]\u2018\u2026\u2019[The present her isn\u2019t directly related to the future disaster. The disaster comes from a world derived from the \u2018first world\u2019 line. Even if their existences are connected, the history\u2026]\u2018Don\u2019t speak useless words and give me the contract.\u2019I finished writing the contract and handed it to Shin Yoosung.\u00a0\u201cI have no stigma right now and can\u2019t lend you my strength like other constellations. I only have a lot of coins.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sign the contract if you don\u2019t want to. However, you won\u2019t regret it if you sign with me.\u201d\u201cMother told me not to mess around with this type of stuff\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t really mean to be a typical sponsor.\u201d\u201cIf I sign this, I can\u2019t contract with another constellation?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShin Yoosung nodded with determination.\u00a0\u201cOkay. I believe in Ahjussi.\u201d[The Sponsor Contract has been concluded.][You have become the sponsor of the incarnation \u2018Shin Yoosung.\u2019]A brilliant light rose and wrapped around me and Shin Yoosung. Unlike the brilliant light, a humble message popped up.[You aren\u2019t a constellation. You are unable to use most of the functions of a sponsor.][List of Available Functions][1.

There were more ichthyosaurs present than yesterday and they were intermittently roaring. They were all 7th grade. Shin Yoosung muttered, \u201cI can\u2019t swim\u2026\u201d\u201cHold onto this and cross.\u201dI pulled out a styrofoam box that I had obtained in advance. I asked Yoo Sangah to connect the box to me using Arachne\u2019s Spiderweb.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dI jumped into Han River without hesitation and Yoo Sangah immediately followed me. Shin Yoosung was frightened but she quickly grabbed the styrofoam box and dipped her feet into the water of Han River.The cold temperature of Han River wrapped around my body. There was the smell of strange beasts and the movements of the ichthyosaurs started to change. \u00a0Yoo Sangah asked,\u2013Is this really okay?Of course it wasn\u2019t okay.\u00a0However, it was the only way considering the time remaining.\u2013If it gets really dangerous then get out as soon as possible.-\u2026Yes.\u2013That\u2019s why you should pretend to be in danger before it is actually dangerous.\u2013Huh?\u2013It is for Yoosung to quickly awaken.\u00a0I am deliberately creating a crisis.\u00a0Understood?I pulled the styrofoam box as I started swimming in Han River.\u00a0This was the reason why I raised Shin Yoosung\u2019s skill level without worrying.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t shown in the attributes window but she had an innate ability to adapt.An ordinary girl could never survive until the fifth scenario.\u00a0Shin Yoosung seemed like a good child but her inner self wasn\u2019t that simple.A child who killed her dog, who tricked adults and who disguised herself to gain favour from the strong. Shin Yoosung was such a child. The first time we met, there were many calculations going on inside her head.I spoke to Shin Yoosung who was looking around.\u00a0\u201cYoosung.\u201d\u201cY-Yes!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t run away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you run away from here, you can\u2019t go back.\u201d\u00a0Shin Yoosung closed her slightly open mouth.\u00a0Shin Yoosung was a clever child rather than a brute.\u00a0\u201cDo what you can.\u201dTricks wouldn\u2019t work on her.\u00a0I couldn\u2019t protect her just because she was a child.\u201cI understand.\u201dFear was fear, fear was determination.[The character \u2018Shin Yoosung\u2019 has used \u2018Advanced Diverse Communication Lv. 3.\u2019]Killing intent was all around me.

The serpentine body hit the surface of the water.The ichthyosaur\u2019s writhing overturned Han River.\u00a0I flew in the air along with the river water. Looking back, Shin Yoosung had let go of the styrofoam box and was also rising in the air.Something quickly rose into the sky and Yoo Sangah\u2019s spiderweb wrapped around Shin Yoosung.\u00a0It was the linked Hermes Walking Method and Arachne\u2019s Spiderweb.Yoo Sangah retrieved Shin Yoosung safely while I stepped on the dead ichthyosaur and started swinging my sword at the approaching ichthyosaurs.\u201cThis way you bastards!\u201dMore than a dozen ichthyosaurs swam in my direction. Huge waves rocked the river and the body of the ichthyosaur I was standing on was in danger. I took a deep breath and adjusted my posture.Way of the Wind would allow me to easily handle this crisis but it wasn\u2019t time yet.\u201cAhjussi!\u201dShin Yoosung\u2019s face became desperate as she was held in Yoo Sangah\u2019s arms. Several fangs aimed at my skin as I wielded the blade. A few ichthyosaurs received mortal blows and fell down. The flowing blood cooled down and this area was becoming more and more crowded. However, I laughed.Become more urgent.Become more anxious.Become more desperate.It was the only way.A terrible injury was created where an ichthyosaur\u2019s fans grazed my skin.\u00a0Blood started to pour from the wound.\u300c No\u2015!\u300dThe scream entered my eardrums.[The character \u2018Shin Yoosung\u2019 is about to evolve.][Incarnation \u2018Shin Yoosung\u2019 has entered a trance state.]Shin Yoosung\u2019s eyes were turning white.

This meant that below the water, more than twice the number of ichthyosaurs were gathering.Then the ichthyosaurs started looking at me again.\u00a0The confused ichthyosaurs emitted a sharp killing intent and became more violent.Dammit, was it a failure?\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi!\u201dIt couldn\u2019t be helped. It was best to use her stigma to escape quickly. Yoo Sangah nodded, escaped the ichthyosaurs and released her threads. I called out to Shin Yoosung.\u201cYoosung. You can stop. Shin Yoosung!\u201dHowever, Shin Yoosung didn\u2019t answer.\u00a0The waves around Shin Yoosung grew stronger and now her body was covered with a bluish aura.At this moment, a whirlpool occurred in the centre of Han River.\u00a0I couldn\u2019t grab onto anything and was swept away by the water.\u00a0The surrounding ichthyosaurs screamed. I barely endured the centrifugal force while hanging onto the scales of an ichthyosaur.The next moment, there was a huge splash of water. Then an ichthyosaur five or six times bigger than the other ichthyosaurs slowly rose.It was so big that it didn\u2019t seem like an ichthyosaur. It was much bigger than the sea commander that I killed previously.\u00a0It had a majestic beard and arrogant eyes that dominated its species.All the ichthyosaurs around it bowed their heads to the surface of the water.[The fifth grade seawater species, the \u2018Queen Mirabad\u2019 has been discovered!]\u2026Shit, she called this monster?\u00a0I knew Shin Yoosung had great talent but I didn\u2019t know it was enough to call a \u2018queen.\u2019\u00a0This was a monster comparable to a disaster.I opened up Bookmark and was about to invoke Way of the Wind when Yoo Sangah\u2019s voice was heard.\u201c\u2026Dokja-ssi?\u201dI looked back and found that Shin Yoosung\u2019s body was floating in the air.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe followed the path of the aura that stretched out to Queen Mirabad and Shin Yoosung slowly approached the queen.

He had said this: \u00a0The propeller cutting through the water was like a highway on the sea.Now I knew what that feeling was like.\u00a0If Director Han\u2019s boat on the ocean was like the Gyeongbu Expressway then I was currently on the Autobahn.\u201cIt is really amazing.\u201dYoo Sangah and I rode on the back of the queen and watched the ripples of Han River with fascination. As if testing her control, Shin Yoosung led the queen straight through the group of ichthyosaurs. Now Han River had become a safe zone and it was preferably to disembark near Yongsan-gu.The ichthyosaurs swam after Queen Mirabad like ducklings following their mother.\u00a0I closed my eyes and felt the cool air against my face.\u00a0This was a real feeling.\u00a0It was a luxury I wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed if the world had remained the same.Shin Yoosung kept mumbling on the queen\u2019s head in order to sync their spirits.\u00a0Yoo Sangah watched Shin Yoosung and spoke with a complicated voice.\u00a0\u201cBy the way, Dokja-ssi. If Yoosung becomes stronger now then won\u2019t her future self be stronger as well?\u201dI thought she would ask something like this.\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dAccording to the original novel, the disaster that would come was the Shin Yoosung of the \u2018future of different regressions.\u2019\u00a0She was betrayed by Yoo Jonghyuk and abandoned outside the world.She lost her sense of time and wandered the universe. Then she became part of the scenarios due to the Star Stream\u2019s blessing and she became a \u2018disaster\u2019 of past scenarios.Yoo Sangah raised a question.\u00a0\u201cThen why will the future disaster be stopped if the current Yoosung dies? If the branch is completely different\u2026\u201d\u201cHave you heard of the Disconnected Film theory?\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\u00a0I watched the water and opened my mouth.\u00a0\u201cPut simply, it is like this. Let\u2019s assume that the history of Yoosung from the first world is a film.\u201d\u201cFilm\u2026 are you talking about the film for movies?\u201dI nodded and continued.\u00a0\u201cAssuming that this world is film one, there must be countless films of the other worlds right? There could be two films and there could also be 34 films.\u201d\u201cI see. Is that right?\u201d\u201cWhat happens when one of the films, with the front broken, sticks to the back of the first film? For example, what if the ripped 34th film sticks to the back of the first film? What do you think will happen if the film is played?\u201dYoo Sangah seemed troubled for a moment.\u00a0\u201cThen the movie would change along the way\u2026 ah, wait a minute. The two stories will never affect each other?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yoosung is currently in such a situation. The present Yoosung is from the first film while the disaster Yoosung is from the 34th film. The two stories are completely independent and any changes in our world can\u2019t affect the disaster.\u201d\u00a0Yoo Sangah was truly smart.\u00a0\u201cStill, the question remains. Shouldn\u2019t the disaster remain if the current Yoosung is killed?\u2019\u201cThe contents of the film don\u2019t affect each other but the two films are connected.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat if the front of the film is set on fire?\u201dYoo Sangah shouted after realizing.\u00a0\u201cThe rear film\u2026 will be on fire as well.\u201dThe two world lines were connected. If the present Yoosung dies, the future Yoosung would also die.\u00a0However, any changes to the present Yoosung wouldn\u2019t change the future Yoosung. That ambiguous paradox was at the heart of this disaster.\u201cDokja-ssi really knows a lot. I\u2019ve heard of parallel cosmology but I\u2019ve never heard such a theory before.\u201dI awkwardly nodded.\u00a0Of course she wouldn\u2019t know it.\u00a0It was a theory that the author of Ways of Survival created.\u00a0As far as I knew, the laws of Ways of Survival had never been ruined.After a while, the water of Han River calmed down.\u00a0We finally arrived at the other side of Han River. The queen dropped us off and then disappeared into Han River again.Shin Yoosung sighed like all the tension had been released.\u00a0\u201c\u2026How was I?\u201d\u201cAre you really asking? Well done.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShin Yoosung\u2019s expression changed.\u00a0She was pleased at receiving praise.\u00a0Now there was nobody left to praise the child.Then I felt a fierce hostility coming from the buildings of Yongsan-gu.\u00a0A huge shadow came out from the shadows of the building.\u2026A giant praying mantis?\u00a0The boy on top of the praying mantis looked down at me.\u201cDokja hyung?\u201dThere were Lee Gilyoung wearing a snapback and Han Donghoon with headphones.Lee Gilyoung slid down the praying mantis and rushed into my arms.\u00a0Lee Gilyoung\u2019s snapback fell off his head.It was a reunion after one week.\u00a0Then a message popped up on my smartphone. It was from Han Donghoon.\u2013It is good to see you, Hyung.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you say it is nice to meet me after a long time?\u201d\u2013I don\u2019t want to.***Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung had a war of nerves as soon as they met. Lee Gilyoung\u2019s hair was moving like it was really an antennae while Shin Yoosung kept touching her hair.\u201cAhjussi, that boy keeps glaring at me.\u201d\u201cHyung, who is she?\u201dIt seemed people of a similar type recognized each other.\u00a0One was a beast master and the other was an insect master.\u00a0I didn\u2019t know if they would fit together.I asked Lee Gilyoung, \u201cYou haven\u2019t met Heewon-ssi yet?\u201d\u201cYes. However, I know where she is. I sent an insect to look. Heewon noona is currently in the north.\u201dAs expected from Lee Gilyoung. He was already searching for the group members without needing to be told.By the way, the north was where the King of Wanderers was currently located.\u00a0Maybe Jung Heewon was in contact with her.\u201cI knew Hyung was coming. I sent a lot of diving beetles.\u201dSpeaking of which, the bugs on Lee Gilyoung\u2019s head had increased. There had definitely only been a cockroach before\u2026 Shin Yoosung frowned like it was disgusting. I checked the power of the party and concluded.\u201cIt is better to stay here for two days. Raise your skill levels as high as possible and collect coins in your spare time. Take care of your overall stats. Ah, Yoo Sangah-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDid you contact your family?\u201dYoo Sangah\u2019s face suddenly darkened.\u00a0It seemed that she hadn\u2019t contacted them yet.\u201cDonghoon.\u201dHan Donghoon kept his headphones on and nodded silently.\u00a0Han Donghoon had Wide-area Internet as a skill. In other words, it was possible to communicate with the outside world.Yoo Sangah\u2019s smartphone rang and there was a message that it was connected to the Internet.\u00a0Yoo Sangah looked down like she doubted her eyes before staring at me tearfully. I nodded and continued.\u201cPlease tell your family of this situation. Once this scenario is over, the outside of Seoul will no longer be a safe zone.\u201d\u201cWhat will happen?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen. Just tell them to be prepared. That is enough for now.\u201d\u201cDokja-ssi, don\u2019t you have to contact anyone?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cMy family is in Seoul.\u201d\u201cSeoul? Then\u2026\u201d\u201cThey are safe.\u201dI silently stared towards the north.\u00a0Then the system message arrived like it had been waiting.[Someone has dealt with the Disaster of Water in the north.]The King of Wanderers had finished her work safely.\u00a0There was only one disaster left.\u00a0It was the Disaster of Floods.***\u300c The bright energy sword made a faint sound as it was raised in the air. It struck dozens of energy blades at once. Blood flowed from Jung Heewon\u2019s eyes and scattered through the air. Soon Jung Heewon\u2019s sword stopped.\u201cI think that\u2019s it.\u201dJung Heewon carefully inspected the sword and smiled with satisfaction. The middle-aged woman across from her also smiled faintly.\u201cJeon Woochi\u2019s technique is amazing.\u201d\u201cHeewon-ssi\u2019s kendo is also excellent. You will soon have a sponsor and I might not be a match anymore.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201dJung Heewon stared at the woman\u2019s blue prison uniform. In the past week, Jung Heewon had been indebted to them. It was a debt that probably couldn\u2019t be repaid with the remaining time. A middle-aged woman asked.\u201cDo you really not want to join our New Wave group? The king will be delighted if Heewon-ssi joins.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry but my companions are waiting.\u201dJung Heewon raised her hands in an apologetic manner. The middle-aged woman just smiled like it couldn\u2019t be helped. The woman already knew who the members of Jung Heewon\u2019s party were.\u201cI hope he knows that Heewon-ssi is this desperate.\u201d\u201cHe knows.\u201d\u00a0Jung Heewon looked at the sky with a slightly disgruntled expression.\u00a0\u201cSomehow, I think he is watching me right now.\u201d \u300d\u2026This was why I didn\u2019t want her knowing about Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint.In any case, Jung Heewon seemed to be growing well.\u00a0I was worried since her character hadn\u2019t seen the light in the original book but I was glad my choice was correct.Then I watched someone else using Omniscient Reader\u2019s Viewpoint.\u00a0Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t many visible points to determine the person\u2019s identity.\u2026Um? What was this?\u00a0A familiar face soon appeared on the screen.\u2026It was me?\u00a0Wait. These people?\u300c \u201cHey, you.\u201d\u00a0Lee Gilyoung spoke in a ferocious voice.\u00a0\u201cStay away from Hyung.\u201dThen Shin Yoosung, who was lying next to me, replied,\u00a0\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d\u201cThis mongrel\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me, you worm bastard.\u201dLee Gilyoung was stunned. The cockroach and other bugs moved wildly on his head. Lee Gilyoung barely regained his composure.\u201cHyung hates kids like you.\u201d\u201cI know who Ahjussi likes.\u201d\u201c\u2026You know who Hyung likes? Who?\u201d\u201cAn unni.\u201dLee Gilyoung laughed.\u00a0\u201cUnni? I think you are misinformed. Hyung likes a man.\u201d\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been with Hyung for a long time.\u201d \u300dI barely managed to wake up as the terrible conversation began.\u00a0I hurriedly looked around and saw Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung sleeping with their heads leaning on something.\u2026Did I see wrongly? Was it just a dream?\u201cDokja-ssi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dI shook my head at Yoo Sangah\u2019s question.\u00a0It must be a dream.\u00a0I was just lying back down when I heard a whisper from somewhere.\u2018Hey, bug. Come to think of it, you hugged Ahjussi earlier?\u2019\u2018\u2026\u2019\u2018Are you a baby? Do you like old people?\u2019It wasn\u2019t a dream.\u201cExcuse me\u2026 aren\u2019t you sleeping?\u201dYoo Sangah warned.

It was a brilliance that seemed like it would light up all darkness near it.\u00a0Some incarnations stared this way with soulless expressions.\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is that person?\u201dShin Yoosung stared above my head in a blank manner and muttered,\u00a0\u201cAhjussi, you are like a Christmas tree.\u201d[The constellations who love the Korean Peninsula want you to keep your promise.][A number of constellations want to see your faith.]In the end, it came.\u00a0I take a deep breath and called to Bihyung.\u2018Bihyung.\u2019[What?]\u2018How many are there now?\u2019I had made a promise to the constellations when fighting off Dokgak.\u00a0If the number of subscribers to the channel reached 10,000 before the Sponsor Selection ended, I would choose a sponsor.[9,812. No, 14\u2026 16.]The number of constellations continued to rise. Bihyung\u2019s tone became tense.[There are three minutes left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]Now the result would be determined in three minutes.[The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 is looking nervously at you.]Unfortunately, there was no point looking at me desperately.[There are two minutes left to complete the Sponsor Selection.][The constellation \u2018Bald General of Justice\u2019 has sponsored you 200 coins.][The constellation \u2018Seo Ae Il Pil\u2019 has sponsored you 300 coins.][The constellation King Heungmu the Great\u2019 has sponsored you 300 coins.]The sponsorship competition was finally starting.\u00a0It was a natural choice for the constellations if they wanted to stand out.[Some great constellations above narrative grade constellations are clicking their tongues.][The constellation \u2018Prisoner of the Golden Headband\u2019 has sponsored you 5,000 coins.]This was the exact development I hoped for.\u00a0Good, good.\u00a0Give me more money.[The constellation \u2018Scribe of Heaven\u2019 has sponsored you 30,000 coins.]\u2026As expected of Metatron. It was an entirely different class.\u00a0It should be obvious since he was a chancellor of heaven.[The constellation Prisoner of the Golden Headband is looking at the Scribe of Heaven.][There is one minute left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]I asked Bihyung.\u00a0\u2018How many now?\u2019[9,973\u2026 76, 77.]It had finally reached a breathtaking level.[9,981\u2026 84.]30 seconds left.[9,993.]20 seconds.[9,998.][A few constellations are holding their breaths.]10 seconds.[9,999\u2026]5 seconds, 4 seconds, 3 seconds\u2026[The Sponsor Selection has ended.]Then I let out a light sigh.\u00a0I gazed at Bihyung who opened his mouth with a smile.[I\u2019m really sorry everyone.][Many constellations think it is ridiculous!]There was no use in yelling.[Current number of subscribers: 9,999]The screen that floated next to Bihyung showed reality.\u00a0Some incarnations saw it and their mouths dropped open.\u00a0Shin Yoosung asked,\u00a0\u201cAhjussi, are you a star on Youtube?\u201dMaybe it was similar.\u00a0I spoke in a shameless voice towards the sky.\u00a0\u201cIt is too bad. I would\u2019ve selected a sponsor if there were 10,000 constellations.\u201d[Many constellations wonder who you would\u2019ve chosen.]Then Bihyung intervened.[This information can\u2019t be revealed to protect the privacy of the incarnation.]Well done Bihyung.[A number of constellations are rioting!]The sky above Yongsan-gu distorted and lightning started to fall towards the innocent people.\u00a0Sparks filled the air. The dokkaebi\u2019s power to influence probability could also block the constellations\u2019 wrath.[Now now, all constellations. Please calm down. Unfortunately, the event had to be cancelled because we are lacking one person\u2026]Then Bihyung glanced at me and continued.[As an apology, I will create a compensation event.]The lightning temporarily stopped.[Perhaps you are thinking this? Shit, what should I do if it continues like this?][Many constellations are listening to the dokkaebi Bihyung\u2019s words.][I understand your thoughts. So! I will punish the incarnation who didn\u2019t choose anyone in the second Sponsor Selection! However, I will only do this if the constellations are in favour of it\u2026][Many constellations are in favour of the dokkaebi Bihyung\u2019s words.]Bihyung nodded with satisfaction.\u00a0Shin Yoosung stared at me with a dumbfounded expression.\u00a0\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be upset by the events unfolding.\u201d\u201cAhjusshi, why didn\u2019t you choose a sponsor?\u201d\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t time yet.\u201dHonestly, I was a bit shaken when I saw Metatron but if I chose someone here, everything I had done would be in vain. I couldn\u2019t enter under anyone else. This was the only way.\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi. Take the kids and hide.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you have an idea?\u201d\u201cOf course. Never come out unless I signal to you.\u201d[A new bounty scenario has arrived!][You have become the target of the bounty scenario.]As expected, the bounty scenario began.+[Bounty Scenario \u2013 Punishment]Category: BountyDifficulty: AClear Conditions: Brutally kill the incarnation \u2018Kim Dokja.\u2019 The more brutal his death, the more coins you can receive.Time Limit: 20 minutes.Compensation: 40,000 ~ ????? coins.Failure: \u2015+Anyone who saw it would think I was the fifth disaster.\u00a0It was 40,000 coins to kill one person.\u00a0Shin Yoosung paled when she received the scenario.\u00a0\u201c\u2026Ahjussi?\u201dYoo Sangah grabbed Shin Yoosung who was reaching for me and retreated. At almost the same time, the incarnations in the area discovered me and started to flock.\u00a0There was the \u2018target\u2019 mark floating above my head.\u201cCrazy! 40,000 coins?\u201d\u201cHey, get that fucker!\u201d[Many constellations are enjoying the development of the scenario.]The constellations angry at my choice loved the way I was being chased like a rodent.\u00a0Everybody had forgotten something about the \u201810,000 event.\u2019\u00a0Yes, this was the nature of constellations.Bihyung glanced at me and communicated with a nasty expression.\u2013I didn\u2019t realize it would turn out like this.\u2018I knew. I used to do this when working at the game company.\u2019The only way to appease angry users was to open a new event.\u00a0Bihyung shivered and murmured.\u2013Is this okay?\u00a0If it is noticed\u2026 I really will receive a Probability Conformity Request this time.In fact, it was an obvious channel manipulation that the number of subscribers didn\u2019t break through 9,999.It was because from the beginning, Bihyung\u2019s #BI-7623 channel only accommodated 9,999 viewers.I wouldn\u2019t be able to escape if someone like Dokgak provoked a fight. Fortunately, there was no one like that present. The low grade dokkaebis had been on guard since the last incident.\u2018I decided to take the chance.\u2019It was still a dangerous method.\u00a0There was no doubt that some smart constellations would doubt this. The number stopped exactly at 9,999. This defied coincidence. Thus, an event to shift the attention of the constellations was needed.The constellations hated annoying things and were vulnerable to fun.\u00a0I used the current Punishment event to take advantage of that.Bihyung opened his mouth and spoke to everyone.[Constellations, please note that the incarnation \u2018Kim Dokja\u2019 can receive a penalty if coins are sponsored.]The moment he spoke, my body suddenly became heavy.[A selfish constellations has given you a speed penalty.][500 coins have been sponsored.]The more coins I received, the more penalties that would be inflicted on me. The incarnations, who normally never would\u2019ve been able to follow me, were right on my tail.\u201cEveryone seems blinded by the coins. Right?\u201dI smiled and wielded Blade of Faith.\u201cUwaaah!\u201d[A constellation who wants your misfortune has given you an attack penalty.][500 coins have been sponsored.]My attack power was halved and the incarnations didn\u2019t die. I was actually glad about this. I didn\u2019t want to kill them,[A constellation who wants your death has given you an defense penalty.][500 coins have been sponsored.]The fucking sponsorship.\u00a0A dagger flew from somewhere and hit my arm, causing terrible pan.\u00a0\u00a0My arm would\u2019ve been cut off if it wasn\u2019t for the Infinite Dimension Space Coat.[A few constellations feel sorry for your adversity.]There were also constellations who supported me.\u00a0Thank you for your tears.\u00a0I grabbed my injured arm and ran to the southwest of Yongsan-gu.If I was right, the meteorite where the Disaster of Floods slept was in that direction.\u00a0The energy of the meteorite showed it was close to hatching.[Bihyung. What the hell is this?][What\u2019s the matter? It is simple entertainment before we enter the game.]Another dokkaebi\u2019s voice was suddenly heard.\u00a0Now Bihyung was speaking in a strong manner.It was a sharp contrast to my heavy body.\u00a0Just a bit more\u2026A river finally appeared.\u201cHold it!\u201dI barely managed to escape from the clutches of other people and plunged into Han River. The other incarnations knew what was in Han River and couldn\u2019t easily follow me.\u201cThis crazy guy!\u201dThe 7th grade ichthyosaurs swarmed like they had been waiting.\u00a0They wanted to make my feeble self their food.[Many constellations are filled with joy.]I had a thought as I watched the ichthyosaurs.\u00a0I didn\u2019t have any talent.\u00a0No matter how hard I trained, I wouldn\u2019t become as skilled as I wanted.\u00a0However, I didn\u2019t want to use that as an excuse to say I was weak.[The exclusive skill \u2018Bookmark\u2019 can now be activated.]The way that I could become stronger was different from other people.[\u2018Character Bookmarks\u2019 is activated.][Available Bookmark Slots: 4][Bringing up the list of available bookmarks.]\u201cI will release Demagogue Cheon Inho from the 3rd slot and add Beast Tamer Shin Yoosung.\u201d[The number three bookmark has been activated.]A bright light surrounded my body and the smell of the monsters changed. Some smells were friendly while some were filled with hostility. I realized that there was a world I didn\u2019t know.\u00a0After all, it was sensitivity to the world that determined how a person read it.[The level of the Bookmark skill is low, shortening the activation time.][Activation Time: \u00a030 minutes]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[Your understanding of the character is significant.
