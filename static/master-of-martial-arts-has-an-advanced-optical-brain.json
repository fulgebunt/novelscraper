You came to take revenge on ordinary people like us?\u201d Chu Nan cursed Luo Li in his mind. Then, he sighed and dragged his feet towards the logistics center in the southwest of the academy.\u201cStudent No. S278309451. Hello, Student Chu Nan. Welcome to the rehabilitation data center. Please choose the service you need.\u201d\u201cFull body checkup, muscle recovery, data analysis report. Right, it\u2019s boring to just lie down. Let\u2019s watch some real-time news.\u201d\u201cAlright, a full-body checkup, muscle recovery, data analysis report, and live news broadcast. Academy Student Chu Nan, you\u2019ve chosen these four services. Please answer after confirming.\u201d\u201cConfirm,\u201d Chu Nan weakly replied and went to the bed in the middle of the room to lie flat.He was much more familiar with this place than most students.As soon as he lay down, the ceiling of the room suddenly opened. A few devices stretched out from above and stopped above Chu Nan. A few lights of different colors shot out and swept past him from head to toe.At the same time, a virtual screen appeared out of thin air about a meter above Chu Nan\u2019s head and started to play some images.\u201cHello, everyone. It\u2019s currently 16:00 on the 19th of June, Year 2785, Earth Time. The Galaxy Standard Time is 38,914th Cycle, 472:61:193 Orbit. Welcome to the news channel. The main content of this news is\u2026\u201dAfter broadcasting a few news related to the federal government, a piece of news attracted Chu Nan\u2019s attention.\u201cAt 09:30 this morning, two Star-Grade Martial Artists came to West Cloud Planet in a group. One of these two Star-Grade Martial Artists is Norman from the Phezzan Autonomous Region, while the other is Mu Yutong from the Earth Federation.\u201d\u201cThis time, two Star-Grade Martial Artists came at the same time. It is said that they are invited by the West Cloud Planet\u2019s government to participate in the upcoming martial arts competition. According to the private information given by Martial Artist Mu Yutong, if a young martial artist is able to perform well in this competition, he will consider absorbing them as his disciples.\u201d\u201cAs soon as this news spread, it immediately caused a commotion on West Cloud Planet. Martial Artist Mu Yutong is one of the few Star-Grade Martial Artists in our Earth Federation. To be able to become his disciple\u2026\u201d\u201cStar-Grade Martial Artist? Mu Yutong?\u201d When he saw this news, Chu Nan\u2019s eyes immediately lit up.As a student of the West Cloud Academy\u2019s Martial Arts Branch, how could Chu Nan not know the meaning of a Star-Grade Martial Artist?Not to mention a small country like the Earth Federation, even in a superpower of the Milky Way like the Declan Empire, a Star-Grade Martial Artist would also be respected and admired by everyone.It was the dream of all martial artists to become a Star-Grade Martial Artist.Being able to become a disciple of a Star-Grade Martial Artist was the best way to fulfill this dream!After a moment of excitement, Chu Nan\u2019s gaze dimmed again.\u201cHeh, come on. I\u2019m only at the initial-stage Overlord Body, so how can Mu Yutong fancy me? I\u2019m afraid even that fellow Luo Li isn\u2019t qualified.\u201dHe and Luo Li were similarly 18 years old this year, but because of his family\u2019s inheritance, Luo Li had already cultivated to the fifth-stage Overlord Body at a young age and had become an outstanding figure among martial artists of this age, a genius that was highly regarded in the West Cloud Academy.On the other hand, he was only from an ordinary family. Not to mention a powerful family inheritance, even the cultivation method he cultivated was only trash that he had found in the public resources of the Milky Way Network. Up until now, he had barely cultivated to the initial-stage Overlord Body, so how could he be compared to Luo Li?When he thought of this, Chu Nan immediately felt dispirited. He sighed and thought that with his current cultivation speed, he would probably not be able to catch up to Luo Li in this lifetime and take revenge for what had happened earlier. In fact, the gap between the two sides would only grow larger.He could not be bothered to watch the news anymore. He turned off the virtual screen, closed his eyes, and simply slept here.In any case, even if he did not do anything, the A.I. of the rehabilitation data center would still settle everything for him. It was not a problem to sleep.Perhaps it was because he had just been injured by Luo Li that he felt a little weak, but not long after, his consciousness sank into his mind and he completely fell asleep.\u201cBrain wave intensity: 1.372, frequency: 0.783 Hertz.\u201d\u201cBrain wave intensity: 1.281, frequency: 0.517 Hertz.\u201d\u201cBrain wave intensity: 1.011, frequency: 0.508 Hertz.\u201d\u201cBrainwave intensity: 0.974, frequency: 0.498 Hertz. The recovery target\u2019s brainwave is below the standard. Temporary resuscitation procedures are activated to stimulate the target\u2019s brain.\u201dBoom!Chu Nan felt a bang in his head and woke him up from his sleep.However, when he opened his eyes, he realized that he was no longer in the recovery room, but in an endless wasteland.\u201cWhere is this?\u201d Chu Nan looked around in surprise but realized that he could not see anything.\u201cThis is a virtual space formed in your brain. Student Chu Nan, your mind is currently in an extremely dangerous state. If you can\u2019t get out of this state, your brain will die.\u201d A voice sounded out of thin air.\u201cVery dangerous?\u201d Chu Nan touched his head in confusion. Then, he strangely discovered that there was really a problem.Ordinary people would at least be a little frightened when they suddenly encountered his current situation. However, other than the initial surprise, he did not react at all, as if everything was natural.Apart from that, he could clearly sense that he was very depressed, even a little abnormally.\u201cThen\u2026 what do I do?\u201d\u201cAccording to my judgment, you need something that can make you happy to stimulate your mind. Student Chu Nan, please tell me what can make you happy?\u201d\u201cSomething that makes me happy?\u201d Chu Nan was stunned, \u201cThis dream is really realistic. I can actually choose whatever I want to be happy about. Something that makes me happy\u2026 something that makes me happy\u2026 A huge reward? A beauty throwing herself at me? Becoming the disciple of Mu Yutong? Becoming powerful from now on?\u201dWhen he thought of becoming powerful, Chu Nan suddenly recalled what had happened.In an instant, anger filled his chest.\u201cI\u2019ll be happy if you let me beat up that guy Luo Li!\u201d\u201cAccording to the statistics of you and Luo Li, you are not his match.\u201d\u201cDamn, could it be that I can\u2019t beat him in my dream?\u201d Chu Nan could not help but curse, \u201cAccording to you, I have no way to vent my anger? How can I be happy?\u201d\u201cStudent Chu Nan, are you sure \u2018beating up Luo Li\u2019 can make you happy?\u201d\u201cOf course! It\u2019s best to beat him up as hard as possible.\u201dThe mysterious voice was silent for a moment.\u201cAlright, Student Chu Nan. For this emergency rescue, I\u2019ll use the virtual image of Luo Li to fight you. In this battle, you will have the ability to collect data, analyze, and process it at the same level as myself. According to my calculations, this will greatly increase your combat ability.\u201d\u201cData collection, analysis, and processing ability equivalent to you? What does that mean?\u201d Chu Nan was stunned.\u201cPlease begin.\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why don\u2019t you take a look yourself? You\u2019re simply ignorant!\u201dAfter saying that, Luo Li raised his right leg and rushed to Chu Nan in a few steps and threw a punch at his face.All of this was exactly the same as what had happened in reality.However, in Chu Nan\u2019s eyes, everything was different from before.The moment Luo Li moved, Chu Nan was surprised to discover that he could actually determine the speed of every part of the opponent\u2019s body in an instant. The value of this speed could even be precise to a micrometer!For example, the moment Luo Li raised his right foot, Chu Nan already knew that the speed at which he raised his right foot was 38.7642278 meters per second.As his right foot stepped forward, this value continuously changed.At the same time, Chu Nan could clearly understand the angle of Luo Li\u2019s right foot movement. Similarly, he could also accurately determine the terrifyingly small value of 0.00001.In other words, every action of Luo Li would instantly turn into countless related values in Chu Nan\u2019s eyes.After these values entered Chu Nan\u2019s eyes, he could immediately know the trajectory of Luo Li\u2019s right leg based on them.Moreover, this trajectory was extremely clear and precise without any deviation!As for the other parts of Luo Li\u2019s body, they were the same.Therefore, as soon as Luo Li activated it, Chu Nan immediately obtained countless numbers related to Luo Li\u2019s actions. After obtaining this number, he immediately knew all of the opponent\u2019s actions. He could even deduce his next actions from the numbers!For example, the moment Luo Li threw his punch, Chu Nan had already deduced from the angle and speed of his punch that if he did not react in time, this fist would hit his left cheek and the tip of his thumb would be pressed against the second molar.With the impact of 174.6343473 kilograms on this punch, not only would his second molar be sent flying, but his entire gums would also be greatly damaged.When faced with this punch in reality, it was naturally not impossible for Chu Nan to react. However, he could only raise his left arm in front of his face and block it. Then, Luo Li\u2019s punch heavily smashed into his left cheek.Although he was not so miserable that even his teeth had fallen out, this punch still made Chu Nan spit out a mouthful of blood.In reality, because Chu Nan\u2019s martial technique was too inferior to Luo Li\u2019s, he was unable to block it. In this virtual environment, Chu Nan had already accurately determined the trajectory of this punch, so how could he be hit again?\u201cHmph, you want to hit me in\u00a0my\u00a0dream? Dream on!\u201dAs this thought flashed through his mind, Chu Nan tilted his head back slightly, just enough for Luo Li\u2019s fist to brush past his face. Then, his right knee sank, and then his waist twisted. His right leg shot out like a whip, ruthlessly kicking Luo Li\u2019s\u2026 crotch, who had just exerted strength in his body and was temporarily unable to react.\u201cAh\u2014\u201dThe virtual Luo Li let out a huge roar. He suddenly arched his body like a shrimp and bounced nearly two meters high from the ground before crashing to the ground.When he saw Luo Li twitching on the ground with a pained expression, even though he knew that it was fake, Chu Nan still felt extremely satisfied.Although Luo Li had already reached the fifth-stage Overlord Body and his physical toughness far exceeded that of ordinary people, no matter what, the special part under his crotch was still fragile.Moreover, according to the data Chu Nan had obtained, the strength of his kick when it landed on the target was as high as 106.345285 kilograms. Even if Luo Li was already a fifth-stage Overlord Body, he would only be crippled if he was struck by this kick.\u201cBrainwave intensity: 1.863, frequency: 19.475 Hertz. Judging from the results, the student, Chu Nan, has obtained joy from this virtual incident. His brainwave has returned to normal, and the emergency rescue program is about to be terminated\u2026\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d Chu Nan hurriedly shouted and stopped the mysterious voice.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, do you have any other requests?\u201d\u201cHey, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, but since you want me to have a good dream, why don\u2019t you let me finish it? I won\u2019t be happy for long if I give up halfway.\u201d\u201cStudent Chu Nan, please make your request.\u201dChu Nan was overjoyed and hurriedly pointed at Luo Li who was still rolling on the ground.\u201cThis guy is tyrannical in the academy. I\u2019ve been unhappy with him for a long time. Just beating him once is not satisfying. I want to beat him a few more times and vent my anger.\u201d\u201cVent?\u201d The mysterious voice paused for a moment before replying, \u201cAlright, student Chu Nan, your request has been accepted. Please continue your battle with Luo Li.\u201dWhen he saw Luo Li appear again, Chu Nan was overjoyed.\u201cHa, I can\u2019t beat you in reality. Watch how I torture you in my dreams!\u201dLuo Li flew over and Chu Nan kicked out, hitting Luo Li\u2019s crotch again.Luo Li flew over and Chu Nan gently spun around before punching his nose. The moment Luo Li squatted down, Chu Nan kicked his neck again, causing it to break.Luo Li flew\u2026\u2026In the next half an hour, Chu Nan tried countless methods to defeat Luo Li.With the help of his incomparably powerful data collection, analysis, and processing ability, every action of Luo Li had completely fallen into Chu Nan\u2019s calculations and could not pose any threat. Furthermore, Chu Nan\u2019s every action was extremely precise without any deviations.In comparison, Luo Li seemed to have become a baby and could not fight back in front of Chu Nan.After repeating this dozens of times, Chu Nan suddenly felt bored after kicking Luo Li away again.No matter how straightforward it was to torture Luo Li, after beating him dozens of times in one go, there was not much pleasure.\u201cHey, can we get someone else?\u201d Chu Nan shouted into the air.\u201cSomeone else?\u201d the mysterious voice replied.\u201cRight, beating up this guy can\u2019t make me happy anymore. Can you change it to that bastard Feng Xiao? This guy relied on his family\u2019s wealth to toy with many girls. I\u2019ve always been unhappy with him.\u201d\u201cI agree to your request.\u201d For some reason, the mysterious voice agreed readily this time.Soon, Feng Xiao, who was called the Twin Tyrants of West Cloud Academy along with Luo Li, appeared before Chu Nan.Chu Nan chuckled.After dozens of battles with Luo Li, he was already very skilled in collecting and analyzing data. Although Feng Xiao was also a high-stage Overlord Body like Luo Li, his true strength was inferior, so it was impossible for him to be Chu Nan\u2019s match.Therefore, for the next dozens of times\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

About a hundred meters away from the rehabilitation data center was an extremely huge underground space.In this underground space, countless machines of all kinds flickered non-stop. Hundreds of people in the uniform of the West Cloud Academy shuttled back and forth in the space, looking busy.In the middle of the space was a huge virtual screen dozens of meters in length and width. On the screen, countless data streams were continuously falling.Below the screen, there were more than ten people standing there and looking up. Their leisurely appearance was a little different from their surroundings.However, the surrounding researchers did not have any complaints. Instead, they looked at the group in the middle with reverence.This was because among these mere ten-odd people, there was actually the dean of the West Cloud Academy and the deputy dean in charge of managing affairs. There was even one person who was the executive officer of the West Cloud Federation\u2019s government!However, what truly filled everyone\u2019s eyes with reverence was the middle-aged man in the middle who did not look eye-catching at first glance.This man was Mu Yutong!Star-Grade Martial Artist!\u201cMr. Mu, our West Cloud Academy agrees with the theory that you proposed to combine technology and martial arts ten years ago. You see, not only can this rehabilitation data center provide treatment, health care, and other services to the students of the West Cloud Academy, but it can also collect information about all aspects of the students and help them improve their martial arts skills.\u201d The current dean of the West Cloud Academy introduced enthusiastically to Mu Yutong.Mu Yutong nodded lightly. After looking around expressionlessly, he asked the dean, \u201cMay I ask, Dean Feng, is there anyone especially outstanding among the students of your esteemed academy?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d The dean replied with certainty, \u201cAlthough our West Cloud Academy is nothing in the entire federation, there are still many genius students. For example, the two students of the second grade, Luo Li and Feng Xiao. Despite their age, one of them has already become a fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist, and the other is a fourth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist. It can be said that they are rare geniuses in our academy.\u201d\u201cFifth-stage Overlord Body?\u201d Mu Yutong raised his eyebrows, \u201cThat\u2019s not bad.\u201dSeeing that Mu Yutong did not seem interested, Dean Feng immediately became a little anxious.He had long known that Mu Yutong had stopped at every residential planet in the Earth Federation this time to take in more disciples.If the West Cloud Academy could have a student that he took a fancy to and take under his wing, then the reputation of the academy would definitely increase greatly, and it would be extremely beneficial to their future development.\u201cMr. Mu, this\u2026\u201dUnexpectedly, as soon as Dean Feng spoke, Mu Yutong looked up at the four virtual screens above.\u201cDean Feng, I heard that your A.I. is imported from the Noctem Chamber of Commerce. Its performance is extremely outstanding?\u201dDean Feng\u2019s words were stuck in his throat. He paused for a moment, and a proud expression appeared on his face.\u201cYes, we spent a huge sum of money to bring in this A.I., and its performance is indeed extremely outstanding. Now, all the various matters in our academy are basically handled through this A.I., and there has never been a problem until now.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Mu Yutong pointed at the virtual screen, \u201cWhy did I see some random codes in the data flow?\u201d\u201cRandom codes? This can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d Dean Feng wanted to refute, but when he looked up, he realized that a row of random codes had really appeared on the originally orderly data flow on the four virtual screens!\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Dean Feng was stunned. A drop of cold sweat immediately appeared on his forehead.It was one thing to be embarrassed in front of the Executive Officer of the Federation and Mu Yutong. Most importantly, this A.I. was responsible for handling the affairs of the entire academy. If anything happened to it, the entire academy might fall into chaos!When he thought of this terrifying outcome, Dean Feng could not care less and immediately delegated tasks to the deputy dean behind him.Soon, the underground space that was still busy and orderly became chaotic.\u2026Bang!Seeing Feng Xiao land on the ground, Chu Nan shook his head.Compared to Luo Li, this Feng Xiao was already a little boring after less than 20 times.After some thought, he looked up again.\u201cBeating up this guy can\u2019t make me happy anymore. Can you change to a stronger opponent?\u201d\u201cA stronger one?\u201d A mysterious voice sounded. \u201cYou mean someone with greater martial techniques?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll satisfy your request.\u201dFeng Xiao\u2019s figure disappeared and another figure began to condense in front of Chu Nan.After seeing this figure, Chu Nan could not help but stick out his tongue.This virtual figure was actually a famous Internal Breath Martial Artist in the entire West Cloud City!According to the ability of a martial artist, they were usually divided into five levels. They were respectively the Novice, Overlord Body, Internal Breath, Void Break, and Heaven Control. Every level was divided into five levels from the initial-stage to the fifth-stage.A fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist like Luo Li had already tempered his body to a certain extent. As long as his Internal Breath was successfully circulated, he could take another step forward and become an Internal Breath Martial Artist.However, there was only such a difference in ability.Luo Li could be called the strongest among the Overlord Body Martial Artists, but he had no chance of winning against any Internal Breath Martial Artist.Chu Nan had said that he wanted a stronger opponent earlier because he felt that Luo Li could not pose any threat to him, so he was bored.However, as soon as this Internal Breath Martial Artist moved, Chu Nan immediately discovered that the pressure he felt was completely different from Luo Li.When he was fighting with Luo Li and Feng Xiao just now, he could determine the other party\u2019s movements by collecting all the data of their movements and easily react.However, as soon as this Internal Breath Martial Artist made a move, even though Chu Nan could immediately obtain all the relevant data and instantly determine the trajectory of his opponent\u2019s movements through these data, and could even instantly think of his next reaction, just as Chu Nan\u2019s mind reacted, the other party had already thrown a punch at him.Chu Nan only had time to turn his body slightly before he was ruthlessly punched in the face.Pew!The powerful impact of 783.532673 kilograms on this punch instantly sent Chu Nan flying. When he was still in the air, he spat out a mouthful of blood mixed with several fallen teeth.Chu Nan\u2019s body was heavily smashed into the ground. The intense pain on his face almost made his entire body go numb.However, before he could do anything, he discovered a black shadow flash before his eyes. Immediately, a fist that carried a biting cold wind landed and heavily smashed into Chu Nan\u2019s head.The impact of 983.683295 kilograms directly smashed Chu Nan\u2019s head into pieces.He immediately lost consciousness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he opened his eyes, he discovered that he was still in the empty virtual space.He touched his face and discovered that it was already intact. There was also no pain in his body, as if nothing had happened.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Chu Nan looked around in confusion.At this moment, he was even more certain of his suspicion. This environment was indeed not his dream.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, in the battle with the Internal Breath Martial Artist, Dos Minsky, I judged you to have failed and died. Do you want to continue fighting him?\u201d A mysterious voice sounded.\u201cDied?\u201d Chu Nan was stunned. \u201cWhat a joke? If I\u2019m dead, why am I still here? Right, what are you? How did you create this space in my consciousness?\u201d\u201cStudent Chu Nan, do you still want to continue fighting with the Internal Breath Martial Artist, Dos Minsky?\u201d\u201cDamn, answer my question!\u201d\u201cStudent Chu Nan, do you still want to continue fighting with the Internal Breath Martial Artist, Dos Minsky?\u201dChu Nan was immediately speechless. It seemed that this guy would not answer this question.As for whether he should continue fighting with Dos Minsky\u2026 Chu Nan frowned.Although the battle earlier was extremely short, he had already understood the problem.Although he could easily defeat Luo Li and Feng Xiao, the two Overlord Body Martial Artists, through the powerful data collection, analysis, and processing ability he obtained in this space, when facing a much stronger Internal Breath Martial Artist, although he could rely on this ability to determine his opponent\u2019s movements, his mind could react, but his body could not.Chu Nan was helpless about this because according to the various statistics of his body, it was indeed impossible for him to move at the same time as his thoughts.In other words, even if he continued to fight that Internal Breath Martial Artist, he could only lose.Could he give up?Chu Nan instantly shook his head.It was not easy to encounter such a situation that was beneficial to him. It was a pity to give up like this.Even if he returned to reality and lost this powerful ability to collect, analyze, and process data, being able to have precious combat experience with Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists would still be extremely helpful to him.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, do you still want to continue fighting with the Internal Breath Martial Artist, Dos Minsky?\u201d The mysterious voice sounded again and urged.Chu Nan thought for a moment before he raised his head and replied, \u201cContinue, but can you pause for a moment? I need to make preparations.\u201d\u201cSure. Let me know when you\u2019re ready.\u201dAfter receiving a confirmed answer, Chu Nan started to think.His mind kept replaying the battle situation.Due to the accurate data collection, the battle situation in his mind was perfectly replayed. What Chu Nan needed to do now was to analyze the battle in less than two seconds.\u201cYes, my right leg should sink a little more at this time so that it\u2019s easier to exert strength.\u201d\u201cMy right arm was raised too high. I couldn\u2019t retract it in time.\u201d\u201cThe same goes for my left hand. If I stretch it too long and my chest is so empty, even if this Dos Minsky doesn\u2019t break my neck, I\u2019ll definitely die if his fist hits my chest.\u201d\u2026After careful analysis, Chu Nan was shocked to discover that he had already made so many mistakes in this short battle and exposed so many weaknesses. If Dos Minsky still could not win under such circumstances, then he would have been a powerful Internal Breath Martial Artist in vain.\u201cThis is the problem of having too little combat experience.\u201d Chu Nan frowned and instantly understood his greatest weakness.However, this was something that could not be helped. In the past, his strength was truly too weak, and he utterly did not have the ability to fight others. Naturally, he did not have any combat experience to speak of.After thinking for a moment, Chu Nan clenched his fists.This was a good opportunity!\u201cHey, I want to continue fighting Dos Minsky.\u201dAfter Chu Nan shouted at the sky, the mysterious voice sounded.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, you are about to start the battle with Dos Minsky. Please prepare, 3\u2026 2\u2026 1, begin!\u201dDos Minsky\u2019s figure instantly appeared not far away from him, and then he rushed over with the same action as before.Chu Nan stared at the other party\u2019s actions with rapt attention. At the same time, countless numbers were constantly circulating in his mind. When Dos Minsky arrived in front of him, he instantly lowered his body and dodged the first punch. At the same time, he stepped back with his right foot, lowered his waist, and aimed his right fist at Dos Minsky\u2019s abdomen in a perfect arc.Regardless of the angle, speed, or strength of this punch, it was all calculated by Chu Nan. It could be said that he had gathered all his strength and its power was extraordinary.At the same time, the timing of this punch was also perfect. It was the moment when the previous force had just dissipated and the new force had yet to be born. According to Chu Nan\u2019s calculations, this punch could be said to have hit the target.Compared to his performance in the previous two battles, it could be said that Chu Nan had improved greatly.However, he had still underestimated the power of an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist.The muscles on his body suddenly twitched strangely. His waist twisted at an unbelievable angle and he happened to dodge Chu Nan\u2019s punch. Then, he raised his left arm and smashed towards Chu Nan like a wooden stick.Chu Nan had originally thought that his punch would hit nothing, but he was already shocked. When he saw this change, he could only raise his head and dodge desperately.However, as soon as he raised his head, he felt a sharp pain in his lower body.Chu Nan was kicked by Dos Minsky and it struck his lower body.\u201cDamn, this is retribution.\u201dThe intense pain only lasted for less than a second before Chu Nan lost consciousness.\u2026After regaining his senses, Chu Nan directly indicated for the mysterious voice to stop and began to analyze the battle again.A moment later, he began his battle with Dos Minsky again.This time, he was defeated in less than ten seconds.However, Chu Nan did not have the intention to be discouraged. On the contrary, he was very excited. At this moment, he only had one thought in his mind, and that was to defeat his opponent!Challenge, failure, analysis of the battle process, summarizing, challenging again, failing again, analyzing again\u2026In the battle with Dos Minsky, Chu Nan had unknowingly improved bit by bit.Compared to before, regardless of whether it was his body\u2019s posture, his reaction to his own usage or battle had already increased countless times.At the same time, his battle with Dos Minsky changed bit by bit.From the initial ten seconds to one minute, two minutes, ten minutes\u2026From being completely suppressed at the beginning, to gradually counterattacking, to being evenly matched, and even suppressing Dos Minsky\u2026Bang!Chu Nan punched out, and it just so happened to pass through the gap between his arms and heavily struck Dos Minsky\u2019s chest.Pew!Dos Minsky involuntarily spat out a mouthful of blood and his body swayed back.Before he could react, Chu Nan had already ruthlessly pounced forward and smashed apart the last bit of defense on his chest with two punches. Then, he twisted his body and his left leg drew an arc in the air before he kicked sideways in the air and landed on Dos Minsky\u2019s neck.Crack!With a crisp sound, Dos Minsky\u2019s neck tilted to the side. In the blink of an eye, his figure turned into a phantom and disappeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His legs suddenly went soft and he sat on the ground.After being stunned for a moment, Chu Nan lowered his head and looked at his hands in disbelief.\u201cI won? I actually won!\u201dChu Nan was overjoyed. He had never expected that he would be able to defeat an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist!When he recalled the hundreds of \u2018deaths\u2019 he had sacrificed for this, Chu Nan could not help but sigh.If not for the fact that death in this virtual space would not really result in any losses, it would be impossible for him to have the powerful strength to defeat an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist.Although the most important thing was still his terrifying data collection, analysis, and processing ability, if he did not obtain improvement through countless battles, then even if he had this powerful ability, he would still be unable to defeat an Internal Breath Martial Artist who was far stronger than him.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, do you still want to continue fighting with the Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, Dos Minsky?\u201d The mysterious voice suddenly sounded again.\u201cThere\u2019s no need. Change my opponent.\u201d\u201cMay I ask if you need a stronger opponent?\u201d\u201cStronger?\u201d Chu Nan frowned and thought for a moment before shaking his head, \u201cForget it for the time being. Just give me an opponent who is similar to Dos Minsky in strength but has a completely different style.\u201dAlthough Chu Nan had already defeated Dos Minsky, it did not mean that his strength had already surpassed him. It could only be said that after hundreds of battles, he had completely grasped the characteristics of Dos Minsky, or rather, he had grasped sufficient experience in fighting him.If he wanted to obtain a true increase, it was naturally better to change to a different opponent.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, the battle is about to begin. Please prepare, 3\u2026 2\u2026\u201dChu Nan was stunned. \u201cWait, you haven\u2019t told me what kind of opponent he is?\u201d\u201c1\u2026 Begin!\u201dThe mysterious voice had no intention of answering. After the word \u201cbegin\u201d, a huge figure suddenly appeared not far away from Chu Nan.\u201cDamn, this\u2026 this\u2026 this is not human at all!\u201dWhen he saw the figure clearly, Chu Nan could not help but wail.At this moment, what appeared in front of him was a huge monster that was as tall as a story of the building. It had four hooves on the ground and two horns on its head. It was like a bull.Chu Nan recognized it at a glance. This monster was clearly the famous adult Giant Spiritual Bull in the \u2018Milky Way Ferocious Beast Encyclopedia\u2019.According to the rankings on the beast map, an adult Giant Spiritual Bull was a D-rank beast. Its destructive power could be compared to initial-stage or second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists.If it was an opponent with strength similar to Dos Minsky, this Giant Spiritual Bull was very suitable\u2026Chu Nan glanced at the huge beast that was like a mountain and swallowed his saliva with difficulty.\u201cCan I win against such a big guy?\u201dHowever, the Giant Spiritual Bull did not give any time to hesitate. It widened its eyes that were larger than Chu Nan\u2019s head and heavily stomped on the ground. Then, it charged towards him with an earth-shattering momentum.\u201cDamn, isn\u2019t it just a D-rank beast? I\u2019ll give it my all!\u201d Chu Nan gritted his teeth and rushed forward with a punch.Then, he was sent flying hundreds of feet by the Giant Spiritual Bull. When his body was still in the air, he had already lost consciousness.\u201cDamn it, who said that the destructive power of this bull is only equivalent to an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist!\u201d After Chu Nan recovered his senses, he could not help but curse.Recalling the moment of contact earlier and the nearly 10 tons of force that came from the Giant Spiritual Bull, Chu Nan still felt a chill down his spine.After cursing, Chu Nan lowered his head and pondered.\u201cFighting this bull head-on is definitely courting death. If I want to win, it seems I have to rely on my speed advantage. However, its speed doesn\u2019t seem to be slow. Then, I can only rely on flexibility? Flexibility\u2026 flexibility\u2026\u201dSimilar to his battle with Dos Minsky, Chu Nan summarized again.On the other hand, the battle with Dos Minsky was different. This time, Chu Nan had only \u2018died\u2019 more than twenty times before killing the Giant Spiritual Bull.When he saw the Giant Spiritual Bull\u2019s corpse collapse, Chu Nan still could not believe his eyes.He had originally thought that he would probably die hundreds of times after killing this D-rank beast. He did not expect it to be settled so quickly.It seemed that he had indeed improved greatly after hundreds of battles with Dos Minsky.At the thought of this, Chu Nan could not help but feel excited. He raised his head and shouted into the air, \u201cHey, give me another similar opponent!\u201d\u2026There was no sun or moon in the virtual space. Time flowed unknowingly.Chu Nan\u2019s opponents changed one after another. From Internal Breath Martial Artists to D-rank ferocious beasts, and from D-rank ferocious beasts to Internal Breath Martial Artists\u2026In the process of fighting these different opponents, Chu Nan\u2019s combat experience continuously increased.Although his Internal Breath and physical statistics did not change much, because of the increase in experience, his strength had already increased countless times compared to before.At first, when facing an initial-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist like Dos Minsky, he could only be instantly killed. Later on, he could completely not be at a disadvantage when facing any initial-stage or even second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist. Most of the time, he could even obtain victory.In the end, Chu Nan even tried to challenge stronger high-level Internal Breath Martial Artists and C-rank ferocious beasts.However, reality told him that with his current Internal Breath and physical strength, even if he had terrifying data collection, analysis, and powerful combat experience, he would still be unable to defeat an opponent of this level.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, according to the monitoring and analysis of your brain, I determine that you need to endure a period of continuous stimulation before your brain waves can return to normal. Next, you will enter a brand new virtual space. In this virtual space, you will continuously encounter powerful opponents. Are you prepared to enter?\u201d After killing another D-rank beast, the mysterious voice did not continue to arrange opponents for Chu Nan like before. Instead, it raised a question.\u201cNew virtual space? Meeting powerful opponents in a row?\u201d Chu Nan was slightly stunned. He clenched his fists without any fear in his heart.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, you are about to enter the death space. Please prepare, 3\u2026 2\u2026 1, enter!\u201dChu Nan\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up and the surrounding environment turned from a wasteland to a dense forest.The intense sunlight penetrated the gap between the leaves and landed on Chu Nan\u2019s face, causing him to involuntarily squint his eyes.However, before he could adapt, he heard an ear-piercing sound of a sharp weapon tearing through the air.\u201cTowards the left, eye level: 36.374361 degrees, angle: 9.36747 degrees, speed: 87.634670 meters per second\u2026\u201dJust by relying on his ears, Chu Nan had already obtained a pile of data in his mind. The moment he obtained this number, he immediately determined that the hidden weapon that was attacking him was aimed at his head. If he could not react, it would definitely pierce through his head and kill him on the spot.\u201cSo vicious, but I like this!\u201d Not only was Chu Nan not afraid, he even felt a trace of excitement. He tilted his head and happened to dodge the hidden weapon.Thump!The hidden weapon ruthlessly stabbed into the tree trunk behind Chu Nan.However, before Chu Nan could even turn around to see what hidden weapon it was, another gust of wind sounded from the left. A figure holding a longsword pounced out from the dense forest and stabbed towards Chu Nan.\u201cGood timing!\u201d Chu Nan roared and his figure moved to face it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Apart from giving him a short period of time to rest and adjust his breathing, there was almost no pause.In the beginning, Chu Nan was simply unable to adapt to such continuous high-intensity battles. Furthermore, these opponents were all powerful and were not inferior to Dos Minsky, causing him to lose his life even if he was careless.However, Chu Nan\u2019s improvement was also extremely fast. In the beginning, three consecutive battles could cause one death. Soon, the number gradually increased. Up until now, he had already obtained 27 consecutive victories, but the price was only a few more wounds on his body.One had to know that in these 27 battles, other than Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists who practiced different martial techniques and had completely different styles, there were also all kinds of D-rank ferocious beasts.If it was in the past, Chu Nan would only be killed if he faced any opponent. However, he could obtain victory in such an intense series of battles now.After regulating his breathing, Chu Nan clenched his fists and revealed a confident smile.Just as he was about to welcome his next opponent, the mysterious voice suddenly sounded.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, according to the analysis of your brain, your brain waves have returned to normal. This emergency treatment is about to end\u2026\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d Chu Nan was stunned for a moment before he immediately shouted. \u201cCan you agree to my last request?\u201dThe mysterious voice paused before asking, \u201cMay I know what your request is?\u201d\u201cLet me fight Luo Li again. However, this time, I hope you can take back your data analysis ability.\u201d\u201cAccording to the data analysis, you\u2019re not Luo Li\u2019s match. Doing this might cause your brain waves to go crazy again.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t affect me. Moreover, I might not lose.\u201d Chu Nan coldly snorted and clenched his fists.Tens of thousands of life and death battles in virtual space not only gave him extremely powerful combat experience, but most importantly, it also gave him strong confidence.Chu Nan believed that even without the help of data collection, analysis, and processing ability, he had sufficient confidence to defeat the other party.The mysterious voice was silent again, as if considering something. After a moment, it spoke again.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, you are about to begin the battle with Student Luo Li. Please prepare yourself. 3\u2026 2\u2026 1, begin!\u201dLooking at Luo Li\u2019s figure that was gradually becoming real, Chu Nan realized that he had indeed lost his ability to collect and analyze the magical data just now. However, he felt fearless. He took a deep breath, took two large steps forward, and threw a punch at Luo Li.\u2026Chu Nan opened his eyes and what entered his sight was still the white ceiling of the room in the rehabilitation data center.He turned around and looked left and right. When he saw the various exquisite equipment in the room, Chu Nan confirmed that he had left the virtual space.When he recalled the last battle before he left the virtual space, the corners of Chu Nan\u2019s mouth could not help but curl into a smile.In that battle, although it was a little difficult for Chu Nan without the help of his data collection, analysis, and processing ability, he defeated Luo Li without a doubt.When he knocked Luo Li down with a punch and could not get up for a long time, Chu Nan felt as if something had shattered in his heart. Although his mood was extremely good, his mind was still calm.It was as if from that moment on, he had been reborn.After recalling his mood, Chu Nan smiled and propped himself up with his hand, preparing to leave.As soon as he exerted strength, he noticed to his shock that his entire body was loose and soft at this moment, as if he utterly lacked strength. Even his head had become dizzy and his mind was weak.\u201cStrange, why did the situation become worse after coming to the rehabilitation data center for treatment?\u201d Chu Nan thought for a moment and guessed that it was due to what had happened in the virtual space.After stopping for a moment, Chu Nan gathered some strength and propped himself up before slowly walking back to the dormitory.When he saw his familiar bed in the dormitory, Chu Nan\u2019s body seemed to have lost all its support. He fell onto it and instantly fell asleep.\u2026\u201cHey, Chu Nan, wake up, wake up! Don\u2019t scare me! Wake up!\u201dIn his daze, Chu Nan felt his body being pushed violently. A familiar voice continuously called out to him.\u201cDon\u2019t disturb me, let me sleep.\u201d Chu Nan roared and swung his arm, but he heard a muffled bang.\u201cGasp! It hurts so much! Damn you, Chu Nan, I kindly woke you up but you actually treated me like this!\u201dHearing the complaints mixed in the voice, Chu Nan was shocked and suddenly woke up.When he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was a round and fat face.Due to the fact that he had his head lowered, the fat on his face was hanging indecently, like two pieces of fat that were suspended.\u201cAh, Dong Fang, what are you doing here?\u201d Chu Nan rubbed his head and discovered that after sleeping, other than his body still being a little weak, his head was no longer feeling heavy. Instead, he appeared much more energetic than before.\u201cOf course, I\u2019m waking you up. Otherwise, what else can I do?\u201d Dong Fang glared at Chu Nan before his face was filled with curiosity, \u201cI say, Chu Nan, what nightmare were you having just now? Why do you keep muttering and looking like you\u2019re in pain?\u201d\u201cNightmare?\u201d Chu Nan was stunned. He thought for a moment but could not recall anything, \u201cCould it be that I\u2019m still dreaming about yesterday afternoon?\u201d\u201cA dream from yesterday afternoon? You started sleeping yesterday afternoon?\u201d Dong Fang cried out in surprise, \u201cI say, Chu Nan, are you serious? When I returned last night, I discovered that you were sleeping and have been sleeping until now. Now, you say that you started sleeping yesterday afternoon. Could it be that you have been sleeping since yesterday afternoon? Oh my god! You\u2019ve already slept\u2026 You\u2019ve slept for nearly 20 hours!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Chu Nan turned to look out the window and discovered that the sun was rising into the sky. From the looks of it, it should be morning.He did not expect that he would sleep for so long after returning from the rehabilitation data center yesterday.When he recalled the event that occurred yesterday afternoon, Chu Nan could not help but frown.He was now certain that what had happened yesterday afternoon was not a dream, but a real virtual space.This was because even now, he could still clearly remember everything that happened inside. If he was dreaming, it was impossible for it to be so clear.However, if it was a virtual space, how did it come about?\u201cHey, don\u2019t be in a daze. Since you\u2019re awake, quickly get up. There\u2019s still class in the morning.\u201d Seeing that Chu Nan was still in a daze, Dong Fang urged him, \u201cI heard that from today onwards, the academy seems to be holding a full-scale competition. It\u2019s said to be related to the martial arts competition. I wonder who will be chosen in the end\u2026\u201dChu Nan shook his head and shook off his thoughts about the incident yesterday afternoon. He got up from the bed.However, as soon as he stood up, he saw Dong Fang preparing something opposite him and was immediately stunned.\u201cIs\u2026 is this still in the virtual space?\u201dChu Nan widened his eyes and looked at Dong Fang in disbelief.This was because in his vision, every action that Dong Fang made would immediately be reflected through a large amount of relevant and precise data in his mind.All of this was not unfamiliar, because he had the same ability in the virtual space yesterday afternoon.Dong Fang raised the small bag containing his belongings with his right hand, and the small bag drew an arc in the air.\u201cSpeed: 8.1342898 meters per second, angle: 0.3683496 meters, arc: 27.646583 degrees\u2026\u201dChu Nan instantly determined that if nothing unexpected happened, Dong Fang\u2019s small bag would hit a glass cup on the table 0.153456 seconds later.Moreover, according to the speed and quality of the small bag, as well as the quality and table situation of the glass cup, Chu Nan estimated that the glass cup would fly 0.8634659 meters away from the table and smash into the ground.Bang!Swoosh! Swoosh!As expected, the small bag collided with the glass cup extremely accurately, sending it flying. It fell not far away and shattered into pieces on the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

My beloved cup! You\u2019ve accompanied me for three years, but you\u2019re gone just like that!\u201dLooking at the tears flowing down Dong Fang\u2019s chubby face, even though he had seen it countless times, Chu Nan still felt his hair stand on end.This guy looked extremely \u2018bulky\u2019 on the outside, but in reality, he was like a young girl who was meticulous and extremely fragile.However, at this moment, something more important attracted Chu Nan\u2019s attention.He raised his head and waved his right hand in the air. As expected, he could still clearly obtain the extremely detailed statistics when he waved his right hand.Looking around, Chu Nan discovered that other than the physical data, when he focused his attention on something, he could also obtain the relevant data.For example, when he saw a book on the table, he could clearly tell that the length of the left and right sides of this book were 0.1634658 meters and 0.1637562 meters, the width of the top and bottom sides were 0.0835485 meters and 0.0835163 meters.When he felt that the room was a little hot, he could immediately sense that the temperature in the room was currently 28.34854 degrees.When he focused his attention on Dong Fang\u2019s cries, he discovered that this fellow\u2019s howls could actually maintain above 73 decibels, at most 86.34325 decibels!\u201cAm I still dreaming?\u201d Chu Nan pinched his cheeks. \u201cGasp! It hurts! Looks like I\u2019m not dreaming.\u201dHowever, if it was not a dream, did that not mean that Chu Nan could do the same in reality as yesterday afternoon?In that dream, Chu Nan relied on his powerful data collection, analysis, and processing ability to obtain 27 consecutive victories in a battle against Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists!If this could happen in reality\u2026Chu Nan gulped. This thought was too crazy!At this moment, Dong Fang finally put away his cries and tidied up the glass fragments. After carefully wrapping them up, he came to Chu Nan and discovered that he was still in a daze. He could not help but push him.\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong with you today? You don\u2019t look right.\u201d\u201cAh? Ah\u2026 Ah, nothing. I\u2019m just hungry.\u201d Chu Nan hurriedly suppressed his imagination and touched his stomach.\u201cNonsense, you didn\u2019t eat last night. It would be strange if you weren\u2019t hungry.\u201d Dong Fang rolled his eyes at him and waved his hand, \u201cLet\u2019s go eat a big meal. Your treat!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cRubbish, my glass cup shattered. Aren\u2019t you going to comfort me?\u201d\u201cYou screwed up, okay?\u201d\u201cSo be it. You have to comfort me anyway!\u201d\u201cDamn, I\u2019m not your mother\u2026\u201d\u2026After wolfing down a meal in the dining hall with Dong Fang, the two of them arrived at the academy\u2019s third combat arena.This was the exclusive combat arena for the second grade of the West Cloud Academy that they belonged to. Generally, when they needed to hold a public lecture, they would gather here.As soon as he stepped into the arena, Chu Nan saw that Luo Li, known as the \u201cIdol of the Academy\u201d, was standing beside Yu Wanqing and laughing.Although Yu Wanqing had an impatient expression, she seemed to be embarrassed to flare up in front of so many people, so she just kept a cold face and ignored Luo Li.\u201cThat guy, Luo Li, why can\u2019t he take a look at himself in the mirror? He actually wants to court Yu Wanqing?\u201d When he saw Chu Nan\u2019s gaze focused on Luo Li and Yu Wanqing, Dong Fang sneered in disdain. Then, he went to Chu Nan\u2019s ear and lowered his voice, \u201cChu Nan, I heard that Luo Li beat you yesterday?\u201dChu Nan glanced at him and did not answer.\u201cDamn, so it\u2019s true!\u201d Dong Fang immediately obtained the answer from Chu Nan\u2019s reaction and was instantly furious, \u201cThis guy is so arrogant! Chu Nan, do you want me to find a few people to teach him a lesson and avenge you?\u201dChu Nan glanced at him again but still did not answer.Dong Fang immediately raised his hands like a deflated ball.\u201cAlright, alright. I know that you have a strong self-esteem and are unwilling to let me help you. However, Chu Nan, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m belittling you, but\u2026 when will you be able to defeat him?\u201dChu Nan smiled, \u201cPerhaps I can later.\u201dNearly an hour had passed since he woke up. Chu Nan could already confirm that he indeed had an incomparably powerful ability to collect and analyze data like he did in the virtual space yesterday afternoon.Yesterday, in virtual space, even if he did not have the data collection, analysis, and processing ability, he could still defeat Luo Li. Now, with this terrifying ability, it was too easy to defeat him.Hearing Chu Nan\u2019s answer, Dong Fang was stunned before he shook his head.In his opinion, Chu Nan\u2019s words were undoubtedly comforting himself.Chu Nan was only an initial-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist while Luo Li was a fifth-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist. In his opinion, the difference between the two sides was worlds apart. It was impossible for Chu Nan to be Luo Li\u2019s match.Chu Nan could naturally see his thoughts from Dong Fang\u2019s expression, but he only smiled and did not explain.The two of them were just about to walk into the arena and find a seat to sit down separately when Yu Wanqing finally could not stand Luo Li\u2019s pestering. She stood up and prepared to change places.As Yu Wanqing stood up, Luo Li\u2019s gaze also rose and he happened to see Chu Nan and Dong Fang.At this moment, Luo Li was furious because of Yu Wanqing\u2019s indifference. When he saw Chu Nan, his eyes immediately lit up and he arrived in front of him with a smile.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t this our virgin classmate? I thought you were bedridden today.\u201dLuo Li clearly referred to Chu Nan as a\u00a0\u201cvirgin<sup>1</sup>\u201d provocatively. Coupled with the obvious mockery in his tone, it immediately caused many of the students who were similar to him to roar with laughter.Chu Nan looked at the strange smile on Luo Li\u2019s face and suddenly realized that he did not feel angry at all.If it was in the past, if Luo Li were to mock him like this, he would definitely be extremely furious. However, at the same time, he knew that he was not Luo Li\u2019s match, so he could only endure it. In this way, he would naturally feel extremely aggrieved in his heart.However, after just a day, Chu Nan discovered that Luo Li\u2019s actions were no different from a clown\u2019s. He only felt that it was laughable and could not anger him at all.A trace of understanding arose in Chu Nan\u2019s heart.Yesterday, in virtual space, he was so powerful that he could easily defeat Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists.Having experienced this, he naturally did not take a mere Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist like Luo Li seriously.Although Chu Nan knew that he was still a mere initial-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist in reality, he also had a powerful ability to gather data, analyze it, and deal with it. Moreover, with his long period of cultivation in the virtual space and tens of thousands of combat experiences, his horizons had already greatly expanded, and his confidence was incomparable to before.In the future, he believed that he would definitely be able to obtain achievements that were even stronger than in virtual space. It was not even impossible for him to become a Star-Grade Martial Artist!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, if Luo Li admitted to Yu Wanqing that he was not a virgin, he would definitely be despised by her.However, if he said that he was a virgin\u2026 not to mention Luo Li, who would believe such an obvious lie?Chu Nan\u2019s simple question immediately pushed Luo Li into a dilemma.Seeing the uncertainty on Luo Li\u2019s face, Chu Nan smiled and walked past him.\u201cKid, stop there!\u201d How could Luo Li let him go so easily? He raised his left hand and clawed at Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder.He had already used his Internal Breath in this grabbing action. As long as he grabbed firmly, although it would not be as exaggerated as breaking a few of Chu Nan\u2019s bones, according to Luo Li\u2019s estimation, it would definitely make him cry out in pain.Unexpectedly, Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder suddenly sank and his body swayed. His grab missed.Luo Li was stunned, but Chu Nan had already walked far away with Dong Fang.\u201cEh? How did he dodge?\u201d Looking at Chu Nan who had already sat down in the distance, Luo Li frowned.However, at this moment, the instructor-in-charge had already walked into the arena. Luo Li could only put down the doubts in his mind and find a place to sit down.\u201cStudents, I gathered everyone together to announce a piece of good news.\u201dThe instructor for the second grade was called Torriman. He was of Germanic descent in the Earth Federation. He was 43 years old this year and was a powerful third-stage Void Break Martial Artist. His personality was very straightforward.As soon as he walked into the arena, he spoke directly, \u201cThe good news is that our West Cloud Academy has obtained a total of fifteen spots in the upcoming martial arts competition. For these fifteen spots, our West Cloud Academy will hold a qualification competition internally. Every grade will obtain three spots. The students who obtain the top three positions in the qualification competition will obtain one of these spots.\u201d\u201cTeacher Torriman, what about the remaining three spots?\u201d a student suddenly asked loudly.The West Cloud Academy had a total of four grades. If each grade had three spots, there would naturally be three left.\u201cGood question. These three spots are specially recommended by the academy. They are prepared for those students who still show excellent martial arts talent even though they did not obtain the top three in the qualifiers. In other words, even if your strength is not the best, as long as you can show your outstanding martial arts talent, you will still be recommended to the martial arts competition.\u201dAs soon as Torriman finished speaking, the students in the field immediately became noisy.If they were only taking the top three positions in the qualifiers, because this group of students had interacted with each other for nearly two years, they had long known the other party\u2019s strength. Almost in an instant, they could determine if they were qualified to fight for the top three positions. Therefore, many students who were not qualified to govern themselves were completely indifferent to this news.However, when they heard Torriman\u2019s last sentence, all the students were tempted.In terms of talent, who would admit to being inferior to others?Unlike the noise of most students, a few students immediately exchanged a few sparks in their eyes.These few students were the most outstanding students in the second grade. If nothing unexpected happened, the top three would definitely be among them.Among them, Luo Li was the calmest.As a fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist, Luo Li could be said to be a crane in a flock of chickens among the second-year students of the West Cloud Academy. His strength was outstanding. Others might be worried about being able to obtain the top three, but he had long taken the first place to be his.\u201cIn addition, I have to reveal a piece of good news to everyone. Just yesterday, Martial Artist Mu Yutong came to our academy to take a look. He once revealed to the dean that if a student of the West Cloud Academy performed well in the martial arts competition, he would prioritize taking him in as his disciple.\u201dTorriman\u2019s words caused the noisy arena to fall silent for a moment, and then there was a much louder commotion than before.\u201cWhat! Martial Artist Mu Yutong came to our academy?\u201d\u201cOh my god! I actually missed my idol!\u201d\u201cI must pass the qualifiers! I must become a disciple of the Martial Artist Mu Yutong!\u201d\u201cTsk, you? It must be me!\u201d\u2026This time, even Luo Li could not help but tremble slightly in excitement.Even if everyone called him a martial arts genius, becoming the disciple of a Star-Grade Martial Artist was still his dream!In the entire venue, only two people did not react to these two pieces of news.One of them was Dong Fang.Dong Fang was not excited because he actually did not have a particularly strong interest in martial arts. His family had forcefully sent him to the West Cloud Academy\u2019s Martial Arts Branch just to force him to train and lose weight. Therefore, he did not care if he became a disciple of a Star-Grade Martial Artist.However, when he turned around, he discovered that Chu Nan was also very indifferent to these two messages.This made Dong Fang feel a little strange. According to Chu Nan\u2019s personality in the past, even if he did not have any confidence in passing the qualifiers, he should not be so calm.\u201cHey, Chu Nan, are you not interested in becoming a disciple of a Star-Grade Martial Artist?\u201d Dong Fang could not help but ask.\u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d Chu Nan thought for a moment and shook his head, \u201cOf course I\u2019m interested, but\u2026 I\u2019m not that interested.\u201dDong Fang widened his eyes and looked at Chu Nan in surprise.\u201cChu Nan, why do I feel that you\u2019re different from before?\u201d\u201cDifferent? What\u2019s different?\u201d\u201cLook, you were so afraid of Luo Li when you saw him in the past, but you actually dared to attack him in his face just now. This is very different. In addition, you\u2019re actually not interested in becoming a disciple of a Star-Grade Martial Artist. This is too\u2026 too terrifying! You definitely wouldn\u2019t have had such a reaction in the past!\u201d\u201cHow should I react?\u201d\u201cAt the very least\u2026 you should be very excited, right?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be excited about?\u201d Chu Nan spread out his hands, \u201cNot to mention that it\u2019s impossible for me to become the disciple of this martial artist, even if I really become his disciple, it might not be a good thing.\u201dDong Fang blinked his small eyes and looked at Chu Nan in disbelief. He shouted in shock, \u201cYou\u2026 you actually said that becoming the disciple of a Star-Grade Martial Artist might not be a good thing?!\u201dDong Fang\u2019s words were a little too loud, and it immediately attracted the attention of all the students.Everyone looked at Dong Fang in surprise, thinking to themselves that although this guy was a little chubby, he had never been stupid in the past. They did not expect that he would actually say that becoming the disciple of a Star-Grade Martial Artist might not be a good thing.Was he crazy?!Dong Fang shrunk his neck and lowered his head to ruthlessly glance at Chu Nan.Chu Nan was expressionless. He looked straight ahead with an innocent expression.In fact, these words were not nonsense. According to his understanding in that virtual space, if he wanted to become a martial arts expert, stepping on the path of his predecessors was the simplest method. However, this was equivalent to constantly following the path of his predecessors. It would be extremely difficult to surpass them in the future.If he wanted to become a genuine super martial arts expert, the only way was to walk his own path!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Torriman quickly announced that they would begin to draw lots to determine the order of the qualifiers.When the results of the draw were out, some people were happy while others were sad.The happy people were naturally because they had drawn a good draw and would not encounter any powerful enemies. The unlucky ones were naturally those who had drawn a powerful opponent that they could not match.The draw Dong Fang drew was neither good nor bad. His first round opponent was a classmate with the standard of a second-stage Overlord Body. With his third-stage Overlord Body cultivation, it would not be a surprise if he won.However, he would encounter a classmate who was also at the third-stage Overlord Body in the second round. It would be hard to say who would win.As for Chu Nan\u2026When the result of Chu Nan\u2019s drawing was out, Dong Fang\u2019s fat body immediately jumped up as if he had a spring.\u201cDamn! There must be a conspiracy!\u201dAccording to the result of the draw, Chu Nan\u2019s first opponent was actually Luo Li!Seeing this result, Luo Li, who was sitting in the front row, turned around. His gaze met Chu Nan and he revealed a cold smile.This time, he had to make this kid embarrass himself in front of all his classmates!When he sensed Luo Li\u2019s gaze, Chu Nan lowered his head and looked at him before staring at an important part of his body for a while and revealing a different smile.In the virtual space, during the dozens of battles where Chu Nan tortured Luo Li, he had crippled that important part of his body countless times.In reality, should he do the same?\u2026The qualifiers of the various grades of the West Cloud Academy were currently in full swing in their respective personal combat arenas. At the same time, in the wide room of the dean at the top of the Central Building of the West Cloud Academy, more than ten people sat down and stared at a huge virtual screen hanging in the middle.The two people in the middle were West Cloud Academy\u2019s Dean Feng Ansheng. The other was Mu Yutong, who had arrived at the academy yesterday.Beside the two of them were no longer some of the officials of the West Cloud Planet, including the Planetary Executive Officer. Instead, it was a firm-looking middle-aged man and some young people.At this moment, the screen was divided into four areas. What was playing was the qualifiers of the four grades that were currently underway.\u201cMr. Mu, how do you think the students of our Martial Arts Branch performed?\u201d Dean Feng pointed at the screen and asked Mu Yutong with a smile.Mu Yutong nodded lightly, \u201cThe students of your esteemed academy are indeed all talented and outstanding martial artists.\u201dHearing Mu Yutong\u2019s praise, Dean Feng laughed, \u201cThank you for your praise, Mr. Mu. However, no matter how outstanding these students are, they can\u2019t be compared to your students.\u201dDean Feng twisted his head back, his gaze landing on the few young men who did not look more than 20 years old sitting behind Mu Yutong, \u201cThose young talents are true geniuses.\u201dThe few young people revealed proud smiles at the same time. The oldest young man in front bowed slightly to Dean Feng and said, \u201cDean Feng, you\u2019re too polite. We only have our current achievements because we followed our teacher. In fact, our talent can\u2019t be considered outstanding.\u201d\u201cHaha, Mr. Mu, this student of yours is really good with words.\u201d Dean Feng smiled and turned around. He glanced at the large screen and suddenly moved his hand. The upper right corner of the screen suddenly enlarged and filled the entire screen, \u201cMr. Mu, look. This is the martial arts genius I mentioned to you yesterday, Luo Li. He\u2019s already a fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist.\u201dBefore Mu Yutong could say anything, a slight sneer suddenly sounded from the disciples behind him.\u201cTsk, a fifth-stage Overlord Body is already considered a genius?\u201dDean Feng\u2019s expression changed as he glanced at the disciples. He saw that their expressions were a little disapproving and was immediately furious.However, when he saw that Mu Yutong did not show any reaction, Dean Feng could only suppress his anger in his heart and pretend not to hear this. He continued to point at the large screen and introduce to Mu Yutong, \u201cLook, the person walking on stage is Luo Li.\u201dMu Yutong glanced at the large screen and nodded lightly, \u201cYes, not bad. To be able to walk so firmly at such a young age and achieve unity of body and mind, he can indeed be called a genius. It seems that your esteemed academy\u2026\u201d Mu Yutong\u2019s expression suddenly changed, and his expression was slightly surprised, \u201cEh? Who\u2019s his opponent?\u201dJust as Dean Feng was feeling proud of Mu Yutong\u2019s praise for Luo Li, he heard him suddenly ask about the opponent. He immediately looked up at the large screen and saw a student with an ordinary figure and no characteristics walking into the venue.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Dean Feng did not recognize this student. He could only turn around and cast his questioning gaze at the middle-aged man beside him.This middle-aged man was the dean of the West Cloud Academy\u2019s Martial Arts Branch, Luo Yuntong. When he heard Mu Yutong\u2019s question, he focused his gaze on the large screen for a moment and thought for a moment before nodding, \u201cThis is a student from the second grade\u2019s third class. His name is Chu Nan, and he\u2019s only an initial-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist.\u201d\u201cInitial-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist?\u201d Dean Feng was stunned. He sighed and said, \u201cWhat a pity. If it was a stronger opponent, he would be able to better showcase Luo Li\u2019s strength. Initial-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist\u2026 the gap between them is too great.\u201dMu Yutong smiled lightly, \u201cDean Feng, who can know the outcome of a battle between martial artists until the last moment?\u201dDean Feng looked at Mu Yutong in surprise, thinking to himself, \u2018You\u2019re a Star-Grade Martial Artist, so how can you not know the difference between an initial-stage Overlord Body and a fifth-stage Overlord Body? Will there be any suspense in this battle?\u2019How could Mu Yutong not know what Dean Feng was thinking? However, as a Star-Grade Martial Artist, he naturally did not need to worry about what Dean Feng thought. After saying this, he stared at the large screen.Be it Luo Li or Chu Nan, he did not understand them at all. However, with his powerful strength and outstanding vision as a Star-Grade Martial Artist, he could even determine a person\u2019s strength through the most ordinary movements.He was certain that this student called Chu Nan\u2019s strength was definitely not as simple as an initial-stage Overlord Body!\u2026In the arena, Chu Nan and Luo Li stood facing each other.Luo Li glanced at Chu Nan and suddenly smiled before spreading his hands.\u201cHeh, Chu Nan, there\u2019s really no meaning in bullying you. I\u2019ll be more generous and give you a chance to admit defeat. What do you think?\u201dThe dozen or so students who were on good terms with Luo Li roared with laughter.\u201cAdmit defeat, virgin. Otherwise, it won\u2019t look good if you get beaten up by Boss Luo Li.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. You can\u2019t even compare to a finger of Boss Luo Li. Why waste time?\u201d\u201cHurry up and admit defeat. We still have to watch the next round.\u201d\u2026When he heard the mockery of Luo Li and the surrounding people, Chu Nan did not feel any anger in his heart. Instead, he wore a relaxed smile and looked at them calmly.This was a group of clowns.When he recalled how Dong Fang had nervously grabbed him before entering the arena and instructed him to immediately surrender if he felt that he could not hold on, Chu Nan could not help but smile. He glanced at Luo Li and the others before turning to Torriman.\u201cInstructor, let\u2019s begin.\u201dHe actually ignored these people.Torriman originally wanted to use his authority as a teacher to berate those students, but when he saw that Chu Nan did not seem to be affected, he could not help but be stunned. Only then did he nod and announce the start of the competition.As soon as Torriman finished speaking, Luo Li immediately bounced up and shot towards Chu Nan.Chu Nan\u2019s earlier attitude had completely angered him. He had already made up his mind and would definitely not give him a chance to admit defeat. He had to defeat this guy in a single exchange.Before this competition, he had already obtained news from Dean Feng that Mu Yutong would watch this competition through a live broadcast. Therefore, he had to show his strongest aspect in this competition. Only then could he strive to leave a good impression on Mu Yutong and become his disciple.Therefore, from the beginning, Luo Li had already used his full strength. What he wanted to do was to use his unstoppable might to instantly defeat Chu Nan!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was because from the various statistics obtained from his actions, he was actually slightly stronger than the Luo Li in virtual space.Specifically, his speed had increased by about 3%, and his strength had increased by about 5%.After being stunned for a moment, Chu Nan immediately understood that this should be because the data regarding Luo Li in the virtual space was rather backward and Luo Li had improved during this period of time.To be able to obtain an increase of 3% to 5% in such a short period of time, it could be seen that Luo Li was indeed a martial arts genius.When they saw Luo Li\u2019s attack, no matter if it was the second grade students who were watching the battle from the side, Teacher Torriman, or even Mu Yutong who was in the dean\u2019s room, they could not help but nod.This was because Luo Li\u2019s strike could be said to be top-notch in terms of strength and speed. It had definitely reached the peak of the Overlord Body realm. He was only a step away from being comparable to an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist.In everyone\u2019s hearts, Chu Nan, a mere initial-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist, would probably not even be able to endure the first exchange.Even Mu Yutong, who felt that Chu Nan\u2019s strength was not only at the initial-stage Overlord Body realm, could not help but shake his head.In his opinion, Luo Li\u2019s strength was indeed at the peak of the Overlord Body Realm. Even if Chu Nan hid his strength, he should not be a match.The only person who remained calm was Chu Nan, who was facing Luo Li\u2019s attack on the stage.Facing Luo Li\u2019s attack that had already reached the peak of the Overlord Body realm, not only was Chu Nan not nervous at all, he even revealed a mocking smile.It was exactly the same as tens of thousands of battles in the virtual space. When any of Luo Li\u2019s actions entered Chu Nan\u2019s eyes, they turned into countless constantly changing data. According to these data, he instantly determined the trajectory of every inch of Luo Li\u2019s body.It had to be said that as a fifth-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist, Luo Li\u2019s martial technique was indeed very outstanding. He did not even need a second to close the distance of nearly ten meters between the two and threw a punch at Chu Nan.The martial technique Luo Li used was one of the top ten fist techniques of the Federation, the Overlord Tiger Subduing Fist. Coupled with the Nine Bull Two Tiger Heart Technique he cultivated, its power was extremely powerful.However, when this fist struck out, it was as if even the air had been shattered. It brought about an ear-piercing whistle, and it was extremely powerful.When the students at the side saw this punch, their faces turned pale.If they were in Chu Nan\u2019s shoes, other than temporarily avoiding him, there was no other way.With his ability as an initial-stage Overlord Body, it was a problem for him to dodge this punch.The miserable scene of Chu Nan being struck by this punch flashed through the minds of many students, and a trace of pity could not help but flash across their faces.Seeing that Luo Li was about to punch Chu Nan, his body suddenly swayed.Chu Nan used the heel of his left foot as an axis. With a wave of his foot, his waist sank and he spun left. His body immediately spun counterclockwise.Borrowing the force of the spinning, Chu Nan swung his right leg and kicked diagonally.This kick did not seem to have much strength or speed, but it directly broke through Luo Li\u2019s defense and directly went between his legs before heavily kicking his lower body.\u201cAh\u2014\u201dLuo Li let out an earth-shattering scream. His body suddenly arched like a shrimp, and he jumped nearly ten meters high. Then, he fell to the ground and rolled continuously.Hearing the painful cry from Luo Li as he rolled, the male students in the audience, as well as the referee, Teacher Torriman, could not help but clench his legs.As a man, how could he not know the pain of being hit in an important part?Chu Nan glanced at Luo Li who was on the ground. He turned to Torriman and asked, \u201cTeacher, can we start counting down now?\u201dToriman was stunned for a moment before realizing his identity as the referee.Although it was obvious that Luo Li had lost the ability to continue fighting, due to the rules, Torriman still counted down obediently.\u201c\u20264\u2026 3\u2026 2\u2026 1, time is up!\u201d After counting the last number, Torriman stood up and glanced at Chu Nan in an extremely strange manner. He then lowered his right hand and announced, \u201cThe winner is Chu Nan!\u201dThe entire venue was silent.Chu Nan had actually defeated Luo Li?This fact shocked everyone. They could not accept it at all.However, Luo Li, who was still in pain, proved this fact extremely clearly. They had no choice but to accept it.\u201cTeacher, it\u2019s best if you bring Luo Li to the rehabilitation data center for treatment. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t be able to last much longer.\u201d Before he left the stage, Chu Nan did not forget to remind Torriman.Torriman came to stand beside Luo Li. He squatted down and pulled open his pants without ceremony. He gasped.Luo Li\u2019s crotch had already turned into mush, its original appearance long gone.Chu Nan\u2019s kick was ruthless!Torriman hurriedly announced that the competition was paused. He carried Luo Li on his back and ran towards the rehabilitation data center.\u2026In the dean\u2019s room.Dean Feng\u2019s expression was a little ugly.When the large screen displayed that Torriman had carried Luo Li and left, the Martial Arts Branch Head, Luo Yuntong, had also hurriedly left. He had even forgotten to inform Mu Yutong.Dean Feng understood him very well, because no matter what, Luo Li was his nephew. Moreover, he was the nephew that Luo Yuntong had always given great expectations and favored the most.Now that such a huge matter had happened to Luo Li, it was no wonder that Luo Yuntong was a little flustered.If something happened to Feng Xiao, he, as the father, would probably be even more nervous than Luo Yuntong.Of course, this was not the time to consider this. Dean Feng was nervously thinking about the consequences of this matter.According to his and Luo Yuntong\u2019s plan, they originally wanted to focus on Luo Li and strive to make him be taken in by Mu Yutong as a disciple.This way, not only would Luo Li benefit, but most importantly, West Cloud Academy\u2019s reputation would also increase greatly.To Dean Feng, because of this plan, he had obtained the support of Luo Yuntong and the Luo family behind him, allowing him to sit firmly in the position of the dean.Now, Luo Li had actually been defeated in the first round of the qualifiers, and he had even been defeated by a mere initial-stage Overlord Body realm disciple that he had not even been able to name before.Most importantly, Mu Yutong had seen everything!If Luo Li was not taken in by Mu Yutong because of this, the consequences would be unpredictable.He turned around and looked at Mu Yutong who still had a calm expression, but there seemed to be a trace of doubt in his eyes. Dean Feng coughed lightly and laughed, \u201cMr. Mu, you\u2019re indeed right. The outcome of a battle between martial artists is unknown until the last moment. Look at how Luo Li underestimated his opponent and lost this round. Otherwise, with his fifth-stage Overlord Body realm strength, how could that Chu Nan be his match?\u201dMu Yutong turned to look at Dean Feng, a hint of mockery flashing across the corners of his mouth.\u201cDean Feng, do you think Luo Li underestimated the enemy? Or is that student called Chu Nan too lucky?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 I think there\u2019s both factors involved. Otherwise, Luo Li is a fifth-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist while Chu Nan is only at the initial-stage Overlord Body realm. With such a huge difference in strength, how could it end up like this?\u201d\u201cDean Feng, you\u2019re indeed not a martial artist.\u201d Mu Yutong smiled slightly. He put down the teacup in his hand, stood up, and cupped his fists in greeting to Dean Feng, \u201cThank you for your enthusiastic reception this time, Dean Feng and West Cloud Academy. It also allowed me to admire a very good battle. Dean Feng, I still have some things to do, so I\u2019ll take my leave first.\u201d\u201cMr. Mu, you\u2026\u201d Dean Feng wanted to ask Mu Yutong to stay, but he swallowed his words. He only smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re too polite. If there\u2019s a chance next time, please come to our West Cloud Academy with these disciples as guests. I\u2019ll sincerely welcome you.\u201dMu Yutong smiled, cupped his hands towards Dean Feng, and then waved his hand before directly leaving the office.His disciples naturally followed behind him one after another.The group left the dean\u2019s room and directly boarded an anti-gravity floating shuttle specially prepared for them by the West Cloud Planet\u2019s government.As soon as the shuttle left the ground, Mu Yutong looked at West Cloud Academy below and suddenly sighed, \u201cWhat a pity.\u201d\u201cPity?\u201d The few disciples beside him looked at each other, not understanding what was going on.\u201cThat student called Chu Nan has decent talent in martial arts. If I had met him ten years ago, I might be tempted to take him in as my disciple. As long as I nurture him with care and provide a cultivation method suitable for him, his future achievements will definitely be extraordinary.\u201dThe disciples looked at each other.Although they were also surprised by Chu Nan\u2019s performance just now, in the eyes of these disciples, a battle between Overlord Body Realm Martial Artists was no different from children fighting.Even if Chu Nan\u2019s performance was surprising, they would not really look at him.They did not expect their teacher to have such a high evaluation of him.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed a pity.\u201d Only the oldest disciple sitting beside Mu Yutong nodded and similarly revealed a regretful expression, \u201cThis Chu Nan is probably over 18 years old this year and his body has long matured. His Internal Breath cultivation method should already have a certain foundation, but it can\u2019t be easily reversed. Look at him, he has only cultivated to the initial-stage Overlord Body. His future achievements will probably be limited.\u201dAfter a pause, he continued, \u201cActually, there are many martial arts geniuses in the Federation, but only one in ten thousand can grow into a true expert from a young age. It\u2019s really fortunate that we were able to enter Master\u2019s tutelage and be nurtured by him.\u201dThe other disciples reacted and immediately thanked Mu Yutong in unison.Mu Yutong waved his hand and stared at the West Cloud Academy that was getting smaller and smaller below. After a moment of silence, he suddenly said with a serious expression, \u201cIf you want to become a true expert, talent is only one of them. My guidance can only be used as support. The most important thing is your own hard work. You can\u2019t forget it.\u201dThe disciples immediately shook and acknowledged in unison.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosLate at night.A long and condensed breath sounded in Chu Nan and Dong Fang\u2019s dormitory.Chu Nan sat cross-legged on the bed and closed his eyes to concentrate. As he breathed, wisps of Internal Breath in his dantian continuously flowed into his meridians. After circulating through all the meridians in his body, they flowed out again and entered his meridians.After repeating this for nine times, this trace of Internal Breath that was clearly much thicker was finally absorbed into his meridians again.This was the internal cultivation method that Chu Nan had started cultivating since he was four years old\u2014the Nine Revolutions Cultivation Technique.This Nine Revolutions Cultivation Technique was created by a martial arts genius from the Earth Federation more than 400 years ago. This cultivation method was divided into nine levels, and each successive level had far greater power than the previous.It was said that after cultivating to the ninth level, it might even be comparable to the Exterminating Heart Technique unique to the royal family of the Declan Empire that was famous in the galaxy.Unfortunately, even the martial arts genius who created this cultivation method had only reached the seventh level. However, relying on the seventh level of the Nine Revolutions Technique, this martial arts genius had already become a Star-Grade Martial Artist whose name shook the Milky Way.Before this martial arts prodigy died, he had completely publicized this cultivation method through the Earth\u2019s Federation network. According to his last wish, he hoped that there would be a martial arts prodigy who could surpass him in the future and cultivate this cultivation method to the eighth or even ninth level.Unfortunately, more than 400 years had passed. There were countless martial artists who cultivated this cultivation method in the Earth Federation, but the strongest person had only reached the sixth level. He had not even reached the seventh level, let alone the eighth and ninth levels.At first, there were many martial artists who continuously tried. After a long time, this internal cultivation method was gradually labeled by most martial artists as trash. Very few martial artists would cultivate it anymore.Why did Chu Nan cultivate the Nine Revolutions Technique?In fact, this was only because of a squabble when he was young.When he chose this cultivation method, many of his companions scoffed at it. At that time, Chu Nan was very unwilling to accept their mockery and decisively chose it.However, the truth was that it had been 13 years since he started cultivating this cultivation method, but he had only just cultivated to the second level.In fact, Chu Nan\u2019s martial arts talent was not bad. However, he had always insisted on cultivating this Nine Revolutions Technique, causing his progress to be extremely slow. This was why he was much worse than ordinary students.Chu Nan\u2019s personality was extremely stubborn. Although he was mocked by many people, he had always persisted and did not want to learn other cultivation methods.Moreover, this was not without benefits. Although he had only cultivated to the second level, causing his Internal Breath to grow extremely slowly, the thirteen years of persistence had made his foundation extremely solid, and the toughness of his Internal Breath far exceeded ordinary martial artists.Every night, when it was quiet, Chu Nan would cultivate the Nine Revolutions Technique.Other than special circumstances like last night, Chu Nan had never stopped.A trace of Internal Breath emerged from his lower abdomen and transformed into a thin warm current that flowed through all the meridians in his body. In the end, it entered his dantian and circled around before transforming into a trace of Internal Breath\u2026After a few cycles, Chu Nan suddenly stopped and frowned as he pondered.When his Internal Breath was circulating in his meridians just now, he was surprised to discover that he could obtain the corresponding accurate numbers for all aspects of his body.For example, after circulating his Internal Breath for a cycle, he could clearly tell that the strength of this Internal Breath was 0.036473% higher than when it came out of his dantian. This represented the effect of circulating it for a cycle.What was even more exaggerated was that he could even know every change in this trace of Internal Breath when it flowed through his meridians.In other words, he could clearly tell which meridian his Internal Breath had strengthened the most.This, in fact, was the core of a cultivation method!After figuring this out, Chu Nan felt excited.Since he could precisely grasp the situation when Internal Breath flowed in his body, did this mean that he could completely combine his meridians and physical condition to improve this cultivation method?At the thought of this, Chu Nan\u2019s heart started to beat faster.Improving the cultivation method? This was something that only those rare martial arts geniuses could do!Of course, this was also an extremely dangerous action. If one was not careful, it might cause their meridians to be messed up. In the best case, they would be crippled, and in the worst case, they would die!After hesitating for a moment, Chu Nan gritted his teeth and closed his eyes again.If he could not obtain a breakthrough in his Internal Breath, then no matter how outstanding his martial techniques were or how powerful his combat awareness was, he would still be stuck at the Overlord Body Realm.For the sake of breaking through, it was worth taking some risks!A trace of Internal Breath was born in his dantian again. However, this time, Chu Nan was not in a hurry to control it to flow along the meridians that had flowed through every cultivation session for the past 13 years. Instead, he changed to another meridian that was connected to his dantian.\u201cAn increase of 0.003691%? If I go through that meridian just now, the increase should be 0.008734%. It seems that this one won\u2019t do.\u201dThis trace of Internal Breath circulated through different meridians and returned to his dantian. In the end, the number Chu Nan obtained was 0.031474%. In other words, the effect was not as good as before.Chu Nan did not lose heart. His mind calmed down and he circulated his Internal Breath again.This time, it was a new meridian.\u201cIncrease by 0.002731%. It\u2019s even worse than the previous one\u2026\u201d\u201cIncrease by 0.005736%. It\u2019s still not enough\u2026\u201d\u201cIncrease\u2026\u201d\u2026Pew!Chu Nan\u2019s body swayed and he spat out a mouthful of blood. This time, when he was experimenting with the last meridian, the moment his Internal Breath entered it, it caused his blood qi to surge and his meridians were almost messed up.\u201cIt seems that the original meridian was the most effective.\u201d Chu Nan wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and confirmed the result of the first meridian\u2019s flow test.After calming down and adjusting his breathing, Chu Nan continued his experiment.This time, he started from the second meridian.This time, he was delighted to discover that after changing his Internal Breath to another meridian, the increase in his Internal Breath was slightly stronger than before.Although it had only increased slightly, Chu Nan knew very well that if he accumulated such an increment every cycle, the final effect would be extremely obvious!In his excitement, Chu Nan continued to test the third meridian.No.No.Pew!No.No\u2026\u2026He had failed countless times and vomited blood countless times. There was even one time when Chu Nan\u2019s meridians were messed up and his body nearly exploded.However, even so, every time Chu Nan adjusted his breathing, he would immediately start experimenting again.After an unknown period of time, Chu Nan finally finished testing the last meridian.Compared to the meridians that Chu Nan had flowed through when he cultivated the Nine Revolutions Technique in the past 13 years, the modifications he made this time were not much. He had only modified less than 10% of the meridians.From this point, the senior who created this Nine Revolutions Technique was indeed a martial arts genius. Even if Chu Nan could perfectly master all the relevant data, including his body and internal breath, he could only make such a small change.However, this change was extremely obvious to Chu Nan.When Chu Nan condensed another trace of Internal Breath and circulated it through his modified meridians for a cycle, he discovered that the increase in his Internal Breath had reached 0.136485%!Compared to the previous 0.036473%, it was actually more than three times higher!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The speed at which Chu Nan\u2019s Internal Breath increased was more than three times faster than before.Not long after, Chu Nan felt that the Internal Breath in his dantian had become extremely abundant. It even filled every meridian that flowed through it to an abnormally full state, causing him to feel a faint swelling pain.Chu Nan knew very well that the modified second level of the Nine Revolutions Technique had already reached the peak. As long as he could make a breakthrough, he would be able to start cultivating the third level.After thinking for a while, Chu Nan was not in a hurry to start cultivating the third level of the cultivation method. Instead, he calmed his mind and started to circulate the first level of the Nine Revolutions Technique that he had not used since he successfully cultivated the second level seven years ago.However, it was different from before. This time, when Chu Nan circulated the first level of the Nine Revolutions Technique, he no longer circulated it along the circulated Nine Revolutions Technique. Instead, he started to experiment with the meridians.With the experience of modifying the second level of the Nine Revolutions Technique, although Chu Nan still spat out a few mouthfuls of blood, he completed the entire modification process much faster than before.When Chu Nan circulated the modified first level of the Nine Revolutions Technique, he immediately discovered that many of the meridians in his body that he could not open in the past seemed to have automatically loosened as his Internal Breath flowed.Chu Nan immediately understood why his Nine Revolutions Technique was unable to break through. It turned out that there was a problem from the beginning.As the first level of the Nine Revolutions Technique continued to circulate, Chu Nan clearly felt that while the meridians in his entire body were expanded further, wisps of internal breath passed through the meridians to moisturize the cells near the meridians, causing every cell to become even tougher.The process of using Internal Breath to strengthen the body was the so-called Overlord Body.Overlord Body Realm Martial Artists all underwent this process.Before this, although Chu Nan\u2019s Internal Breath was not weak, he had always been unable to use it to strengthen his cells and body. Therefore, he could only barely reach the initial-stage Overlord Body realm.Now that he had improved the first level of the Nine Revolutions Technique, Chu Nan could truly use his Internal Breath to strengthen his body. In other words, he had finally become a true Overlord Body Martial Artist.Only then did Chu Nan truly understand the power of the Nine Revolutions Technique.When the Nine Revolutions Cultivation Technique was circulated, because every trace of Internal Breath would flow in the dantian and meridians for nine cycles before returning to the dantian, it would last longer than most Internal Breath cultivation methods, causing the Internal Breath to flow in the meridians. Naturally, it would also last longer to strengthen the body more.After just a single cycle, Chu Nan could clearly feel that his physical strength had increased substantially.According to the data obtained in Chu Nan\u2019s mind, every time he circulated the first level of the Nine Revolutions Technique, the strength of his muscles would increase by approximately 0.3%.Although this number looked very small and as the Nine Revolutions Technique circulated, the number became smaller and smaller, the flow of Internal Breath was extremely fast. It only took less than five seconds to circulate the nine revolutions once.When this number fell infinitely close to zero, Chu Nan stopped.After using his Internal Breath to investigate, Chu Nan discovered that circulating the first level of the Nine Revolutions Technique had practically zero effect on him.Logically speaking, it meant that he should start cultivating the second level of the Nine Revolutions Technique.Of course, since Chu Nan was cultivating from the start, there was naturally no obstruction when breaking through.With a punch, the fist broke through the air with a muffled sound.Chu Nan nodded in satisfaction. The strength of his muscles had increased by 37.3478% compared to before. The power contained in this punch had naturally increased greatly.If he added the terrifying experience he had obtained from countless battles in the virtual space based on the data, then his punch could definitely unleash nearly ten times the strength he had previously!This was only an advancement he had obtained by modifying the Nine Revolutions Cultivation Technique through data experiments to a cultivation method that was most suitable for him.After teasing him for a while, Chu Nan closed his eyes again and started to circulate the modified second level of the Nine Revolutions Technique.The characteristics of the Nine Revolutions Technique was that the next stage of the center of gravity was almost like a staircase. Therefore, when Chu Nan started to circulate the second stage of the Nine Revolutions Technique, he was surprised to discover that the strength of his body had increased even more exaggeratedly than before.In just over an hour, the strength of Chu Nan\u2019s body had increased by 73.3773% again! His internal breath had also increased by nearly 10%.Soon, Chu Nan reached the peak of the second level.Feeling the abundant strength in his body and the overflowing Internal Breath in his dantian, Chu Nan knew that he should begin to break through the third level of the Nine Revolutions Technique.After recalling the detailed description of the third level, Nine Revolutions Technique, Chu Nan took a deep breath and started the experiment again.Threads of Internal Breath flowed through his meridians. Sometimes, they were successfully opened, but sometimes, it caused the blood in his body to surge and he even spat out a mouthful of blood.After close to a thousand experiments, Chu Nan finally confirmed the third level route of the Nine Revolutions Technique that was most suitable for him. Then, he calmed his mind and released the Internal Breath into his dantian.Countless threads of Internal Breath instantly filled most of the meridians in his body. After circulating through these meridians, they returned to his dantian and flowed out again.As his Internal Breath circulated every cycle, the originally unblocked meridians in his body were overcome one by one.The Internal Breath in these meridians gradually thickened from thin threads to fully occupying the meridians in the dantian.When the last meridian was finally filled with Internal Breath, Chu Nan felt a bang in his head. The Internal Breath in his meridians suddenly seemed to have been connected to his dantian, and countless Internal Breath surged through his meridians like a torrent.Chu Nan was overjoyed. This situation meant that he had finally reached the stage where his meridians were completely opened and his Internal Breath could instantly reach his entire body!In other words, he had finally cultivated the third level of the Nine Revolutions Technique!Feeling the continuous flow of his meridians and dantian, Chu Nan sighed endlessly in his heart.He did not expect that the third level of the Nine Revolutions Technique that he had not been able to break through for seven years would actually be broken through so easily now.If not for the help of terrifying data collection, analysis, and processing ability that allowed him to analyze the data when his internal breath flowed through every vein in advance, it would probably be several times more difficult for him to succeed alone.Now, he had only spat out a few mouthfuls of blood and had successfully broken through. Moreover, because he had tested this third level of the Nine Revolutions Technique, he had confirmed that it was the most suitable for him and the effects were even more outstanding.Chu Nan even dared to say that other than the senior who invented the Nine Revolutions Technique 400 years ago, no one had obtained a higher cultivation level than him when cultivating it.In fact\u2026 even that senior was inferior to Chu Nan.This was because it was impossible for that senior to have incomparably precise data as a reference for every meridian and every trace of internal breath in his body.Looking down at the blood stains on his chest and bed, Chu Nan laughed and casually wiped away the blood at the corner of his mouth before jumping up from the bed.Although he was slightly weak after spitting out a few mouthfuls of blood, Chu Nan clearly felt that his physical body and internal breath were much stronger than before.Whoosh!Chu Nan punched out, bringing about the force of a chilly wind.He glanced at Dongfang who was still lying on the bed like a dead pig and a smile flashed across his face.From today onwards, he was no longer the Chu Nan who could be bullied by others!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lying on it was Luo Li, who was currently in a coma and his lower body was tightly wrapped.The three of them stood beside the bed and looked down at Luo Li, their expressions ugly.One of them was West Cloud Academy\u2019s Martial Arts Branch Head, Luo Yuntong.He glanced at Luo Li, raised his head, and turned to the other middle-aged man who was slightly older than him. He said in a low voice, \u201cBig Brother, you don\u2019t have to worry. Our academy\u2019s rehabilitation center is the best medical center on West Cloud Planet. Li\u2019er will be fine. He\u2019ll recover to his original state in a few days.\u201dThe middle-aged man called Big Brother by Luo Yuntong had a dignified appearance, and it was obvious that he was a person who had been in a high position for a long time.His name was Luo Guangfu, and he was the current Patriarch of the famous martial arts family on West Cloud Planet.When he heard Luo Yuntong\u2019s words, Luo Guangfu nodded lightly and glanced at Luo Yuntong, and a trace of anger flashed past his eyes.\u201cTell me, who did this to him?\u201dAn awkward expression flashed across Luo Yuntong\u2019s face as he respectfully replied, \u201cIt\u2019s a classmate of Li\u2019er\u2019s.\u201d\u201cClassmate? I remember that no one in Li\u2019er\u2019s classmate has the ability to hurt him, right?\u201d Luo Guangfu asked in surprise.\u201cThis\u2026 Actually, I\u2019m not too sure what\u2019s going on, because this student was only an initial-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist in the past.\u201d Luo Yuntong recalled the scene he saw on the large screen and could not help but reveal a trace of doubt.\u201cInitial-stage Overlord Body? How can he injure Li\u2019er like this?\u201d Luo Guangfu was even more stunned, \u201cThird Brother, is there a problem?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. This student has been in our academy for two years already. He doesn\u2019t have any background.\u201dLuo Guangfu pondered for a moment before suddenly frowning, \u201cIs this student called Chu Nan?\u201dLuo Yuntong was stunned, \u201cBig Brother, how did you know?\u201dLuo Guangfu narrowed his eyes, \u201cI heard that after Mu Yutong left this morning, he sent someone to inquire about a student called Chu Nan.\u201d\u201cCould it be that Mu Yutong\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Luo Guangfu waved his hand, \u201cAlthough our Luo family has some influence on West Cloud Planet, we\u2019re nothing in the eyes of a Star-Grade Martial Artist like Mu Yutong. He won\u2019t specially come to deal with us. This should be a coincidence.\u201d\u201cUncle, could it be that Mu Yutong has taken a fancy to that Chu Nan?\u201d The young man who had been silent behind the two of them suddenly interrupted.Luo Guangfu and Luo Yuntong looked at each other and nodded in unison.\u201cVery likely.\u201d Luo Guangfu frowned and thought for a moment before suddenly sneering, \u201cLuo Jie!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The young man immediately straightened his body.\u201cI don\u2019t care what method you use, cripple this student called Chu Nan before the sun sets tomorrow. I want everyone to know that it\u2019s best not to offend our Luo family on West Cloud Planet!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSeeing the young man turn around and leave, Luo Yuntong frowned and hesitantly said, \u201cBig Brother, since Mu Yutong has taken a fancy to this Chu Nan, if we attack him and anger him\u2026\u201dLuo Guangfu shook his head, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. If Mu Yutong has already taken Chu Nan as his disciple, I would have to be wary. However, he\u2019s only observing now. Even if we touch him, he won\u2019t say anything.\u201dAlthough Luo Yuntong was feeling a little uneasy, since Luo Guangfu had already made his decision, he would not voice any objections.Turning around to look at the still unconscious Luo Li, Luo Yuntong immediately felt that Luo Guangfu\u2019s decision was indeed very correct.When he thought of this, Luo Yuntong could not help but smile, \u201cBrother, isn\u2019t it a little too wasteful to send Jie\u2019er to deal with that Chu Nan? He\u2019s a second-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist.\u201dLuo Guangfu smiled slightly, \u201cEven a lion does its best to hunt a rabbit.\u201d\u2026The next day was a rare day of rest for West Cloud Academy. Chu Nan was pulled out of bed by Dong Fang early in the morning and left the school early to head towards the center of West Cloud City.\u201cDong Fang, I still don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so interested in shopping. Are you a woman?\u201dChu Nan helplessly looked at Dong Fang who was tidying up his appearance in the small mirror in his hand. If he had not stayed in the same dormitory as this guy for two years and seen his bare bottom countless times, he would really think that he was a woman.\u201cNo, no, no. I\u2019m not interested in shopping, but if there are beauties accompanying me, I\u2019m very interested.\u201d Dong Fang shook his thick fingers and looked at Chu Nan with a gaze filled with disdain.\u201cBeauty? Where is it? Why don\u2019t I see it?\u201d Chu Nan placed a hand on his forehead and looked into the distance.\u201cIdiot, I\u2019ve long made an appointment with a beauty. I\u2019ll meet you downtown in a while. Right, I\u2019ve arranged to meet two beauties today and specially prepared one for you. Don\u2019t say that I\u2019m not good enough.\u201dChu Nan glanced at Dong Fang from head to toe and sneered bluntly. \u201cCome on, with your personality, how beautiful can a beauty like you be?\u201d\u201cDamn, you dare to look down on me?\u201d Dong Fang was furious, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that I\u2019ll scare you to death? When I\u2019m at home, the beauties who ask me out to shop every day can line up from here all the way to the academy!\u201d\u201cIs that why you were so frightened that you fled to our lousy academy?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Dong Fang was stunned, and then he immediately softened like a deflated balloon. His thick back leaned on the back chair of the floating bus, and he sighed, \u201cSigh, I originally thought that if I ate until I became a fat pig, those girls would never look for me again. I didn\u2019t expect them to be the same as before.\u201d\u201cNonsense, those women are not interested in you as a person.\u201d Chu Nan hit the nail on the head.\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201d Dong Fang said dejectedly, but then he became excited, \u201cBut let me tell you, I finally hooked up these two beauties from the \u2018Martial Soul\u2019 game today. They don\u2019t know anything about my family\u2019s wealth, so they shouldn\u2019t be like those women.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then I find it strange. What do they fancy about you?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, right? This is because I\u2019m funny, humorous, and considerate\u2026\u201d Dong Fang spoke a bunch of beautiful adjectives non-stop. He suddenly paused and glanced at Chu Nan, \u201cAfter talking for so long, you\u2019re the weirdest today. In the past, you were unwilling to go shopping with me, so why did you agree today?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not here to shop with beauties. Today is the opening day of the Martial Artist Exchange. I want to go there and see if there are any suitable martial techniques.\u201d\u201cA suitable martial technique?\u201d Dong Fang was stunned, \u201cDoesn\u2019t our academy have many martial techniques for you to choose?\u201dHe suddenly reacted and suddenly jumped up, shouting, \u201cYou said you want to choose a martial technique? Did I hear wrongly?\u201dWith Dong Fang\u2019s weight, the sudden jump caused the floating shuttle to sway. Coupled with his loud shout, it immediately attracted the gazes of everyone in the carriage.\u201cWhy are you so agitated?\u201d Chu Nan hurriedly pulled him down.Dong Fang rubbed his chubby face and asked in a low voice, \u201cChu Nan, you said you want to choose a martial skill. Do you mean that\u2026 you\u2019ve finally broken through the second level of the Nine Revolutions Technique?\u201dSeeing Chu Nan nod, Dong Fang\u2019s eyes immediately lit up. He grabbed Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder and shook him.\u201cThat\u2019s great! I knew that you would definitely be able to do it! Now, you can finally start officially cultivating martial techniques!\u201dLooking at the joyous expression on Dong Fang\u2019s chubby face, a trace of warmth flashed through Chu Nan\u2019s heart. He smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen all the martial arts in the academy. They\u2019re not suitable for me, so I want to see if there are any other choices.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. The publicized martial techniques in the academy are all trash. The best are only D-rank, so what\u2019s the use? However, it\u2019s very difficult to have good things in the martial arts exchange. Martial techniques of C-rank or above are rarely used by martial artists to exchange.\u201d\u201cThe martial skill level is not important. What\u2019s important is that it suits me.\u201d Chu Nan shook his head.\u201cThat\u2019s true. Even if I throw you an A-rank or even S-rank martial technique now, you won\u2019t be able to learn it.\u201d Dong Fang thought for a moment, then slapped his thigh and said, \u201cAlright, after meeting those two beauties, we\u2019ll go to the martial arts exchange to take a look. In any case, they\u2019re all players in the Martial Soul game, so they\u2019re very interested in martial arts.\u201d\u201cMartial Soul?\u201d Chu Nan muttered to himself as the scene of him being pulled into this game when he first met Dong Fang flashed through his mind.It was an extremely painful memory for him.As soon as Chu Nan, who only had the strength of an initial-stage Overlord Body, entered this combat game produced by the Noctem Chamber of Commerce, he was tortured nearly a hundred times. In his anger, he directly left and never logged on again.He did not expect Dong Fang to be so skilled at this game. He could actually rely on the game to hook two beauties.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Chu Nan focused his gaze and could not help but praise.From their appearance, these two girls did not look older than 17 or 18 years old. They were similar to Chu Nan and Dong Fang. Although they could not be said to be extremely beautiful, they were still in their prime. With just a casual outfit, they were like two fresh flowers blooming in the center of the square. They were worthy of the word beauty.Seeing the happy expressions of the two girls when they saw Dong Fang, Chu Nan shook his head in bewilderment.\u201cHow strange. Could there be something wrong with their eyes?\u201d\u201cHey, Rose, Luo Lan, this is my good brother, Chu Nan.\u201d After exchanging a few pleasantries with the two girls, Dong Fang introduced them to each other, \u201cChu Nan, open your eyes and look carefully. These two beauties are the good friends I mentioned to you. This beauty is called Rose, and this beauty is called Luo Lan. Come, get to know them.\u201d\u201cRose? Luo Lan? They\u2019re both good names.\u201d Chu Nan smiled and stretched out his hand, causing the two girls to laugh.\u201cYou\u2019re Chu Nan?\u201d The girl called Rose appeared more lively and generous. Her curious gaze swept past Chu Nan and she suddenly asked, \u201cHey, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re really a virgin?\u201dChu Nan was stunned and immediately looked at Dong Fang with a murderous gaze.Needless to say, when Dong Fang and these two girls mentioned him in private, they must have laughed at his name.Dong Fang glanced at the sky and put on an innocent expression.Chu Nan glared at him before turning to look at Rose and seriously replied, \u201cI am. Why? Don\u2019t you like virgins?\u201dRose and Luo Lan looked at each other and chuckled at the same time. After a long time, Rose held back her laughter and said softly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, compared to those guys who only want to sleep with girls all day, I still prefer to be a virgin.\u201dLuo Lan was slightly quieter than Rose. She smiled and did not speak, but the gaze she used to look at Chu Nan became gentler than before.After all, the four of them were all young people and had the common topic of martial arts. Soon, they chatted together.When they heard Dong Fang say that Chu Nan was only an initial-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist, Rose and Luo Lan did not look at Chu Nan with disdain like the others. Instead, they became even closer to Chu Nan because they were only at the initial-stage Overlord Body realm too. Compared to Dong Fang, a third-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist, it was easier for him to have a common language with them.However, when they heard Dong Fang tell them that Chu Nan had actually defeated a fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist yesterday, their eyes were filled with shock.\u201cDon\u2019t listen to his nonsense. I was just lucky. If we fight again, I definitely won\u2019t be his match.\u201d Chu Nan hurriedly said modestly.Regarding his powerful data collection, analysis, and processing ability, Chu Nan had already decided to treat it as the most important secret that no one could reveal. In order to hide this secret, it was naturally best for him to expose less of his strength.\u201cIt\u2019s hypocritical to be too humble.\u201d Unexpectedly, Rose pouted when she heard that, \u201cChu Nan, Dong Fang doesn\u2019t dare to lie to us. Tell me, how did you defeat that fifth-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist?\u201d\u201cYeah, tell us. I\u2019m very curious.\u201d This time, even Luo Lan could not help but ask.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Chu Nan laughed at the sky and did not answer.Seeing him like this, how could Rose and Luo Lan be willing to give up? They immediately asked relentlessly.The square was not far from the Martial Artist Exchange, but after the group made a commotion, it still took nearly half an hour to reach.This Martial Artist Exchange was specially held by the West Cloud Planet\u2019s government to facilitate communication between the martial artists on West Cloud Planet. It was held once a month.With the push of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s government, this exchange had already become the grandest venue for martial artists to interact.At the martial artist exchange, not only would martial artists publicly or privately exchange their martial techniques, there would even be martial artists who directly sold their own unique martial techniques.Because there were often some martial artists who were forced to sell special martial techniques they had obtained through various methods because of life or various reasons, many martial artists would come to this exchange event to try their luck.Chu Nan was one of them.Due to the arrival of Mu Yutong and the two Star-Grade Martial Artists, as well as the imminent arrival of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s Martial Artist Competition, the martial arts atmosphere on the planet had suddenly become extremely dense recently. As a result, this originally very lively martial arts exchange was now even more bustling and bustling with people.When the four of them arrived at the venue, it was the peak period. It took a lot of effort to squeeze in.As soon as he entered the venue, Chu Nan went straight to the martial arts exchange area. Dong Fang, Rose, and Luo Lan wanted to go to the martial arts competition area to watch. After the four of them discussed, Chu Nan headed to the martial technique exchange area alone.This was actually the first time Chu Nan had come to this place. In the past, because he had only cultivated the second level of the Nine Revolutions Technique, his Internal Breath was not enough to support him in cultivating other martial techniques, causing him to be uninterested in martial techniques.Now that the Nine Revolutions Cultivation Technique had already broken through to the third level and his Internal Breath had greatly increased, he began to consider cultivating martial techniques.However, when he was in the academy, he had already logged into the academy\u2019s martial arts library through the academy\u2019s regional network. He discovered that the martial techniques inside were all extremely low-grade. Even the only D-rank martial technique was the worst among D-rank martial techniques.This was something that could not be helped. Although martial arts were flourishing in this era and various martial techniques were endless, it was precisely because of this that powerful martial techniques would be more protected and would not be easily circulated.For example, the Nine Revolutions Cultivation Technique was already an exception.Chu Nan was not born in a martial arts family and did not have a good master in the past, so he naturally did not know any powerful martial arts techniques.Even if he came to this martial artist exchange, he was only trying his luck.Ever since he entered the martial arts exchange area, Chu Nan had focused on looking at every martial arts technique displayed in every stall.It had to be said that these martial techniques were still very tempting just from their names.For example, the \u201cHeaven Extinguishing Divine Palm\u201d, \u201cMeru Divine Art\u201d, \u201cLunar Shooting Spear Art\u201d, \u201cQi Devouring Eight Desolates Art\u201d\u2026However, when Chu Nan flipped open the introduction, he immediately laughed.These so-called divine techniques looked decent, but in fact, they were probably not even considered E-grade martial techniques.No wonder these martial techniques were not labeled with rankings. It turned out that they still knew their own limits.Chu Nan was not discouraged. Before he came, he knew very well that it was almost impossible to find a powerful martial technique here.His goal was only to find a martial technique that was suitable for him.After walking for a while, Chu Nan stopped in front of a stall.\u201c\u2018Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u2019?\u201d Chu Nan picked up the simple and ancient martial arts introduction on the cover. This was the first martial arts technique he had seen that did not have such an earth-shattering name.\u201cThe \u2018Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u2019 was created by the Ancestral Patriarch of the Hong Clan. There are a total of three stances and twelve moves. Those who are proficient in them will be able to break the flow of a river with one punch.\u201d\u201cIt sounds quite arrogant.\u201d Chu Nan smiled and flipped the page. After taking a glance, his smile immediately disappeared.This introduction only described the first stance and first move of \u201cHong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u201d\u2014Sitting Horse Rush Fist.There was no detailed description on it, only two diagrams. One was punching, and the other was retracting.However, these two simple positions firmly attracted Chu Nan\u2019s gaze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was actually able to unleash the highest strength in this position.\u201cIt seems that this thing is not to fool people.\u201d Chu Nan flipped through the introduction and realized that there was only the first move on it. He could only raise his head and ask the stall owner, \u201cIs there a complete version of this?\u201dThe stall owner was a middle-aged man who was more than 40 years old. He had a shrewd expression and looked more like a businessman than a martial artist. When he saw that Chu Nan seemed to be interested in this \u201cHong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u201d, he immediately revealed a brilliant smile.\u201cOf course there is. How can there be an incomplete sale item in my, Hong Changzhi\u2019s, stall? Little brother, are you interested?\u201dChu Nan nodded and asked, \u201cCan you show me the full version?\u201dHong Changzhi revealed a trace of surprise, \u201cLittle brother, this is your first time here, right? You don\u2019t know that this martial technique is different from other things. You won\u2019t show the complete version when trading.\u201dChu Nan was slightly stunned, but he immediately understood. The focus of martial techniques was the content. If the complete version was seen, then it was very likely that he would directly learn it secretly.He lowered his head and flipped through the first move of the \u201cHong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u201d. Chu Nan hesitated for a moment before asking, \u201cHow much is this?\u201d\u201cThere are two methods to transact. One is for you to exchange another martial technique as long as I think it\u2019s suitable. The other method is simple. You can pay directly.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any martial techniques. How much is this?\u201d Chu Nan asked directly.Hong Changzhi glanced at Chu Nan and estimated in his mind before extending five fingers.\u201c50,000 federation coins.\u201d\u201cWhat? 50,000?\u201d Chu Nan was immediately shocked. He had never expected that this mere \u2018Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u2019 would be sold for such a high price.Although Chu Nan did not see the complete version, from just the first move, if this skill was evaluated, it would at most be rated as a D-rank.Currently, Chu Nan only had a mere 30,000 federation coins that he had saved up from spending frugally. He was still far from being able to afford this.\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive. Can it be cheaper?\u201d Chu Nan tried to bargain.\u201cLittle brother, this is a fist technique passed down by our Hong Clan\u2019s ancestors. If I didn\u2019t really have trouble waiting for the money to be used, I wouldn\u2019t have taken it out at all.\u201d Hong Changzhi did not give in.Chu Nan glanced at the obviously expensive clothes on Hong Changzhi and the golden ring on his finger. He thought to himself, \u2018You\u2019re just using your nonsense to fool children.\u2019Rolling his eyes, Chu Nan sighed and put down the introduction. He put on a regretful expression and shook his head, \u201cThen it\u2019s a pity. Forget it, I\u2019ll go take a look elsewhere.\u201dHong Changzhi did not expect that Chu Nan would give up after just putting on a show. This was beyond his expectations. When he saw that Chu Nan was about to leave, he hurriedly raised his voice, \u201cLittle brother, little brother, don\u2019t leave quickly. We can still discuss, we can discuss\u2026\u201dChu Nan continued to shake his head, \u201cNo, I only have 10,000 federation coins on me. The difference is too great.\u201d After saying that, he turned around and left.This time, Hong Changzhi became even more anxious. He actually walked out from behind the stall and reached out to stop Chu Nan.\u201cLittle brother, don\u2019t be anxious. It\u2019s rare to see a martial technique you like, so you can\u2019t just give up. You also know how difficult it is for us martial artists to choose a martial technique that\u2019s suitable for us. If you miss it this time, who knows when the next opportunity will be?\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t have that much money.\u201dHong Changzhi frowned and suddenly sighed. He put on a pained expression and waved his hand, \u201cForget it, forget it. Since Little Brother likes it, I can only give it up. Alright, 10,000 it is. I\u2019ll make a small loss and treat it as making a friend.\u201dUnexpectedly, Chu Nan also frowned and said with a troubled expression, \u201cBut I\u2019m meeting a girl today and I have to save some money to accompany her for shopping\u2026\u201dHong Changzhi\u2019s face twitched, \u201cThis\u2026 Alright, 8,000, no less! Little brother, this is a ridiculously low price.\u201dChu Nan turned around and looked at the stall. He lowered his head and pondered for a moment before sighing and shaking his head, \u201cForget it. It\u2019s her birthday today, and I have to give her a birthday gift.\u201d After saying that, he pushed Hong Changzhi away and left.Seeing that Chu Nan was about to enter the crowd, Hong Changzhi darted forward and stopped him again. He stretched out five fingers.\u201cAlright, 5,000! 5,000 then! This can\u2019t be any lower!\u201dA smile appeared on Chu Nan\u2019s face before he suppressed it and pretended to hesitate. In the end, he nodded firmly as if he had made up his mind.\u201cAlright, at most, I\u2019ll eat porridge every day next month!\u201dHow could Hong Changzhi not see the smile on Chu Nan\u2019s face? When he heard his words, he could not help but roll his eyes. He thought to himself: Since you\u2019re so cunning, why would you have to eat porridge?However, since the price had already been sold, he could not go back on his words.Immediately, Chu Nan used his personal terminal to transfer 5,000 federation coins to Hong Changzhi\u2019s account.When he saw that there was an additional 5,000 in his personal account, Hong Changzhi took out a tattered book from his bosom with a smile and handed it to Chu Nan.\u201cLittle brother, this is the true product passed down by our ancestors. Not to mention the martial technique inside, just this book can be considered a cultural relic of ancient text. It\u2019s worth a lot of money.\u201dChu Nan nodded. With such advanced technology, paper records had basically been eliminated.However, to call this \u201cHong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u201d an ancient artifact was simply an exaggeration.After taking the book and flipping through it, Chu Nan immediately confirmed that the remaining eleven moves were indeed similar to the first one. They were the best posture to unleash one\u2019s strength.\u201cLittle brother, aren\u2019t you going to take a look at the other martial arts techniques? I still have two types of sword techniques, three types of saber techniques, one spear technique, and a decent leg technique. What do you think?\u201d Seeing that Chu Nan had put away the \u2018Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u2019, Hong Changzhi tried his best to promote his goods.Chu Nan did not stand on ceremony and started to read them one by one.However, other than the \u201cHong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u201d, Chu Nan could tell at a glance that the other martial arts techniques were all trash with the data in his mind.The most laughable thing was one of the leg techniques. There were several positions that were problematic. According to the data in Chu Nan\u2019s mind, if he practiced these positions, the muscles in his legs would collapse due to excessive burden. In the end, his legs would be crippled.After sweeping through these martial arts techniques, Chu Nan shook his head and bade farewell to Hong Changzhi without any hesitation.As he watched Chu Nan disappear into the crowd, Hong Changzhi finally could not hold back the ecstasy in his heart and laughed.\u201cHa, this fool. I casually took out a lousy book from my house\u2019s attic, and he\u2019s actually willing to spend 5,000 coins to buy it. Haha\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Other than true powerful martial techniques, there were also many other advantages.However, just relying on this point, Chu Nan\u2019s 5,000 federation coins were already worth it.Moreover, Chu Nan also had the terrifying ability to collect, analyze, and process data. He could use any martial skill to its limit with the support of huge amounts of data.To other martial artists, this Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist might be too simple and crude, but to Chu Nan who was only at the Overlord Body realm and did not have a powerful Internal Breath, it was very suitable.When he arrived at the entrance of the venue, he did not see the figures of Dong Fang and the other two.Chu Nan turned around and looked at the still crowded venue, giving up on the thought of squeezing in to find the three of them.Looking around, Chu Nan walked towards the underground area of the building.After finding a quiet place in the underground parking lot, Chu Nan could not wait to take out the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist and read it again.After confirming that he did not remember any of the statistics regarding the positions of the three stances and twelve moves, Chu Nan took a deep breath and his knees sank. His left hand formed a fist and he held it at his waist. His right palm retracted and brushed past his waist. His five fingers gathered into a fist and he struck out forcefully.It was the first move of the first stance, Sitting Horse Rush Fist.As soon as his fist reached out from his waist, it brought about a gust of wind. When Chu Nan\u2019s right arm straightened and the fist arrived at the end, the air at the tip of his fist suddenly exploded as if something had been broken.\u201cGood!\u201d Chu Nan could not help but shout in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s indeed a good fist technique! Just the first move alone can cause an air explosion!\u201dWith Chu Nan\u2019s current physical strength that was equivalent to a third-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist, it was very difficult for the power of his punch to produce an air explosion under normal circumstances. This was a phenomenon that only happened when one\u2019s speed and strength were extremely strong.Now, he was only using the first move of this Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist Technique to produce such power. It could be seen that this martial technique was indeed extraordinary.However, Chu Nan was actually not very satisfied with this result. When he threw this punch, he clearly felt that his body was a little awkward. Moreover, some of his muscles did not exert any strength, so it could be seen that his posture was not perfect and could not completely unleash the power of this punch.After using the data in his mind to replicate it a few times, Chu Nan sank his knees and punched again.Bang!This time, the strength in his fist was slightly higher than the previous round.However, Chu Nan was still unsatisfied because he could still sense that a portion of his muscles had not been mobilized.\u201cI strictly followed the posture on this map. There\u2019s no deviation at all\u2026\u201d Chu Nan flipped open the secret manual of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist in wonder.After looking at the two diagrams for a few times, Chu Nan finally noticed that there were a few lines of small words beside them.The first part was only the introduction of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist, but the last line attracted Chu Nan\u2019s attention.Water is unpredictable, and fists have no fixed momentum. If the intent is there, the fist will be there. If the intent moves, the fist will move.When he saw this line of words, Chu Nan felt as if something had knocked on his head and was about to jump out.\u201cWater is unpredictable, and fists have no fixed momentum?\u201d Chu Nan recalled the tens of thousands of battles in the virtual space and could not help but nod.In those tens of thousands of battles, had he ever used the same method to defeat his enemies?\u201cWhat does \u2018If the intent is there, the fist will be there. If the intent moves, the fist will move\u2019 mean?\u201d Chu Nan frowned as he pondered for a moment and could not understand. \u201cForget it, I\u2019ll settle the first half first.\u201dChu Nan calmed himself down and sized up the two diagrams again. After thinking for a moment, he suddenly laughed.No wonder he always felt that something was wrong. After all this time, he had gotten the most basic thing wrong. The figure of the small person on the pattern was much shorter than him.It would be strange if it was not awkward for a 1.8-meter-tall guy like Chu Nan to assume this posture.After figuring this out, Chu Nan immediately understood the solution.He made a comparative analysis of the notes and posture related to this small person in his mind, Chu Nan quickly came up with the exact posture he should take.After confirming that there was no mistake, Chu Nan sank his knees again. However, he sank slightly deeper than before and threw a punch.His right fist whistled out from his waist. When it reached the end, he suddenly stopped, and an intense explosion sounded in the air.Even though he had punched out, Chu Nan could not help but be shocked.The speed of this punch was actually 82.663846 meters per second. The force even exceeded 500 kilograms!In terms of this punch, although it could not compare to an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, it had already vividly displayed the strength of Chu Nan\u2019s Overlord Body realm body.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed a good fist technique!\u201d Chu Nan could not help but praise in a low voice. \u201cThat guy doesn\u2019t know anything. This has benefited me greatly.\u201dEarlier, this punch could be said to have moved all the muscles in his body and displayed almost every inch of strength in his body. Only this could allow this punch to possess such a terrifying might.Ordinary external martial techniques were definitely not so powerful. For example, the fist technique Luo Li practiced was the Overlord Tiger Subduing Fist, one of the top ten fist techniques in the federation. At the same time, he also had the strength of a fifth-stage Overlord Body. A punch could at most reach 300 to 400 kilograms of strength.Of course, this was also because Chu Nan had an abnormal ability to collect data, analyze, and process information that allowed him to unleash the full potential of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist. Otherwise, if it was any other martial artist of the same level as Chu Nan, it would already be very good if they could master more than 80% of this fist technique and unleash 300 kilograms of strength.However, even if he could unleash 300 kilograms of strength, it was enough to prove that this Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist was actually an abnormally outstanding martial technique.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!Chu Nan threw out dozens of punches in a row. Every punch had a slight change in posture.He made adjustments according to his various statistics and data after the punch in order to obtain the best effect.Soon, he confirmed the most powerful posture based on the data and firmly etched it in his mind.With his experience in learning the first move, Chu Nan quickly mastered the next eleven moves.However, what made him feel a little regretful was that even after he used these three stances and twelve moves perfectly, he still did not understand the meaning of \u2018If the intent is there, the fist will be there. If the intent moves, the fist will move\u2019.Just as Chu Nan was thinking hard, the personal terminal on his wrist suddenly rang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosChu Nan lowered his head and saw that it was Dong Fang\u2019s call.He stretched out his hand and pointed at the video chat window. A virtual screen appeared in front of Chu Nan, and Dong Fang\u2019s chubby face filled the screen.\u201cHey, Chu Nan, why aren\u2019t you waiting at the door\u2026 Eh? Where are you? Why does it look like an underground parking lot? Also, why are you sweating profusely? Where did you go? Could it be\u2026\u201d Dong Fang revealed an ambiguous smile.\u201cIt\u2019s too noisy up there. I came down to calm myself down.\u201d Chu Nan rolled his eyes at him, \u201cAre you done shopping?\u201d\u201cYes, Chu Nan. We\u2019re about to eat together. Hurry up and come up. We\u2019ll wait for you at the door.\u201d Rose\u2019s crisp voice sounded.\u201cAlright, wait for me. I\u2019ll be right up.\u201dAfter casually turning off his personal terminal, Chu Nan wiped the sweat on his forehead and turned around to walk towards the underground exit.He had just taken a few steps when he turned a corner and suddenly stopped.Not far away from him, an ordinary-looking young man who would definitely not be noticed by anyone walking on the street walked over. From his appearance, he looked to be only in his twenties.Although this young man did not seem to have anything to pay attention to, the moment Chu Nan saw him, he immediately felt danger.This was not because he felt any killing intent or murderous aura from the other party, but because of his experience from tens of thousands of battles in the virtual space, as well as the comprehensive judgment of any subtle points on the other party at a glance.This person\u2019s footsteps seemed to be slow, but every step he took was very solid. He was as stable as a rock and was not as superficial as ordinary people.Moreover, the distance between each step was almost identical.To be precise, according to the data in Chu Nan\u2019s mind, the difference between each step was less than a millimeter!As he gradually approached Chu Nan, many subtle changes were happening to his body.For example, the muscles on the back of his hand gradually tightened, and the hair on his face gradually stood on end\u2026Although every change was only at the level of a millimeter, it was an abnormally clear change in Chu Nan\u2019s mind.According to Chu Nan\u2019s tens of thousands of battles, all these changes indicated that this person was about to attack.\u201cWho is this guy? Why did he attack me?\u201d While these questions flashed through his mind, Chu Nan\u2019s feet only slowed down slightly. He acted as if he was surprised to see someone appear before returning to normal and approached the other party.\u201c10 meters\u2026 9 meters\u2026 8 meters\u2026 3 meters\u2026 2.9 meters\u2026 2.8 meters\u2026 2.734368 meters.\u201dThe distance between the two of them had just arrived at the most suitable distance that Chu Nan had calculated. His left foot suddenly descended and heavily stepped on the ground.Bang!The moment the dust on the ground rose, Chu Nan\u2019s raised right hand had already clenched into a fist. He waved his left arm that was pulled back and clenched his left hand. His right leg that was stepping on the ground suddenly exerted strength, and all the bones and muscles in his body immediately crackled. Then, his right fist rose diagonally and headed straight for the person\u2019s throat.His left leg stepped forward at an angle, his right leg moved back like a hoof, his left palm clenched tightly, and his right fist soared into the sky. It was the third move of the second stance of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u2014Retreating Horse Hook Fist.Although this punch did not give Chu Nan enough time to assume a perfect posture, with his incomparably precise calculations, it was still perfect.It was even more smooth and natural than when he had practiced this move earlier.The speed of this punch was 78.346723 meters per second, and the force was 429.346813 kilograms. The angle was extremely exquisite, and it just happened to be the moment that person walked over.If that person did not react, this punch would definitely puncture his throat.Instant kill!Just as the punch was about to hit, that person suddenly raised his arms and guarded his chest, coincidentally blocking Chu Nan\u2019s punch.Bang!The force contained in Chu Nan\u2019s punch was extremely shocking. That person originally wanted to sneak attack, but he was counterattacked by the target now. In his hurry, how could he resist with all his might? He was forcefully sent sliding on the ground by this punch.If not for the fact that he had already circulated his Internal Breath to prepare for a sneak attack, this punch would have broken both his arms.While that person was still surprised that Chu Nan had discovered his intention and launched a sneak attack, Chu Nan had already rushed forward. He twisted his body and kicked that person\u2019s head.It was Luo Jie.Last night, he had been ordered by Luo Guang to cripple Chu Nan before the sun set today. Luo Jie immediately received the order and left.At first, he was worried that Chu Nan would stay in West Cloud Academy. If he attacked, it might affect his third uncle, who was also the principal of the West Cloud Academy\u2019s Martial Arts Branch, Luo Yuntong.Who knew that Chu Nan would leave the academy early in the morning? Overjoyed, Luo Jie followed him all the way down.Unfortunately, he did not expect Chu Nan to come to the Martial Artist Exchange because there were too many people in the venue. He had actually lost Chu Nan.Just as he was feeling anxious, he happened to see the video call between Dong Fang and Chu Nan. After knowing that Chu Nan was currently in the underground carpark, Luo Jie quickly walked down.Although Luo Jie and Luo Li were cousins, their personalities were vastly different. Luo Li was proud and arrogant. If he was sent here for this mission, he would definitely fight Chu Nan face to face. However, Luo Jie wanted to sneak attack and cripple Chu Nan.However, he did not expect that before he could attack, the kid would launch a sneak attack.Chu Nan\u2019s punch was indeed quite powerful. Although he hurriedly blocked it, the force of the punch made his chest feel stuffy.Just as he was surprised by how a mere initial-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist could unleash such a powerful punch, he seemed to have gained the upper hand and kicked over.Luo Jie sneered in his mind.Although Chu Nan was able to defeat Luo Li and prove that his true strength was definitely not only at the initial-stage Overlord Body realm, Luo Jie was a second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, so he naturally did not take Chu Nan seriously.Seeing Chu Nan\u2019s kick, Luo Jie\u2019s body swayed like the wind blowing against a willow tree and easily dodged it. Then, he took a deep breath and lightly slapped his left palm.This palm strike did not seem to have any power, but it contained Luo Jie\u2019s powerful Internal Breath. If he was to hit it, the sinister internal force produced by Luo Jie\u2019s cultivation of the Luo family\u2019s Jade Fragment cultivation method would invade Chu Nan\u2019s meridians and immediately cripple him.However, Chu Nan had experienced tens of thousands of battles of various sizes in the virtual space. With his rich combat experience, he had long had follow-up moves when he kicked out.As soon as Luo Jie\u2019s palm moved, he had already analyzed the next move through the data. He twisted his waist again, and the sidekick suddenly fell and smashed into Luo Jie\u2019s chest.Luo Jie did not expect Chu Nan to react so quickly. In his shock, he could only hurriedly withdraw his left palm and raise his hands to block Chu Nan\u2019s kick again.Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!In the sealed space of the underground parking lot, the muffled sounds of fists and feet colliding could be heard.Chu Nan and Luo Jie exchanged blows, and in the blink of an eye, they had exchanged more than a hundred moves.The more Luo Jie fought, the more shocked he became.Up until now, he already knew Chu Nan\u2019s true strength.From the strength of Chu Nan\u2019s punches and kicks, his true strength was only similar to a third-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist.However, from the beginning of the battle until now, he had been completely controlled by Chu Nan and did not have the slightest chance to counterattack.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosThis was the most depressing battle Luo Jie had ever fought since he started practicing martial arts.Every time he wanted to counterattack, Chu Nan would always be the first to change his moves. Moreover, every attack of his would directly attack his weakness, forcing him to change his moves.Luo Jie was so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood, but there was nothing he could do.Originally, he planned to rely on the fact that his Internal Breath was far stronger than Chu Nan\u2019s to counterattack after he was exhausted. However, Chu Nan seemed to be getting braver the more he fought. Not only did he not show any signs of exhaustion, his every punch was even stronger than before.On the contrary, it was because he was always passively defending that his blood qi surged and his strength was consumed extremely quickly.However, Luo Jie did not know that in the tens of thousands of battles in the virtual space, Chu Nan had basically faced inner-rank experts and D-rank beasts who were much stronger than him. In these tens of thousands of battles, he had long learned how to use the least strength to obtain the greatest results. Therefore, although he had fought intensely until now, he had not exhausted much of his strength.Most importantly, during this battle, Chu Nan had used the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist Technique again and again. Gradually, he started to understand something.Originally, every time he used these three stances or twelve moves, he would strictly follow the perfect posture he had obtained from his own analysis. However, in a true battle, it was impossible for him to do it so perfectly every time. His posture would always change because of the situation.After doing this many times, Chu Nan was forced to change his posture and make some modifications through data analysis to maximize the power of his punch.Over time, Chu Nan gradually discovered that he was no longer limited to the three stances and twelve moves.In the beginning, every punch he threw would be related to the three stances and twelve moves. Later on, he had long forgotten about the three stances and twelve moves.He knew that he had to unleash the strongest power of every punch and kick.At this moment, he immediately recalled the tens of thousands of battles he had fought in the virtual space.In those tens of thousands of battles that were even more intense than now, had he ever been confined to any fixed position?When he thought of this, Chu Nan immediately understood.Endless data surged in his mind and Chu Nan\u2019s body changed accordingly.No matter which punch or kick he unleashed, his body could naturally adjust, causing it to always unleash nearly all of his physical strength.In the end, every attack of Chu Nan\u2019s seemed to be smooth and natural.\u201cSo this is the so-called meaning of: If the intent is there, the fist will be there. If the intent moves, the fist will move.\u201dHe suddenly threw a punch and felt a stir in his dantian. A trace of internal breath arose from his dantian and instantly flowed through the meridians in his body to his right fist.Bang!Luo Jie could not help but take a few steps back from this punch.Chu Nan could not help but be stunned. The force behind his punch had actually exceeded 600 kilograms!According to the strength of his flesh, if he only relied on his muscle strength, it was impossible to achieve such a terrifying strength.The reason why it could produce such powerful might was naturally because his punch had mobilized the Internal Breath in his dantian.On the other hand, being able to mobilize Internal Breath at will in battle was something that only Internal Breath Martial Artists could master!\u201cCould it be that I\u2019ve inexplicably become an Internal Breath Martial Artist?\u201d Chu Nan was stunned, but he knew that this was impossible.With his current physical strength, he was at most equivalent to a third-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist. How could he break through to the Overlord Body realm and become an Internal Breath Martial Artist?At this moment, Luo Jie had already counterattacked. Without giving it much thought, Chu Nan took a step forward and threw another punch.Coincidentally, this punch was exactly the same as the second move of the second stance of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist, the Retreating Horse Stab Fist.After punching out, Chu Nan felt a stream of internal breath suddenly rush out from his dantian and flow into the meridians of his right arm.Boom!Under Chu Nan\u2019s precise calculations, the angle of this punch was extremely ingenious. It happened to break through Luo Jie\u2019s defense and forced him to withdraw his fists in a sorry state to block his chest.However, after Chu Nan\u2019s punch obtained the help of his Internal Breath, a terrifying force as high as 768.346768 kilograms suddenly erupted. Caught off guard, Luo Jie was struck by Chu Nan\u2019s punch and was sent flying like a sack.Luo Jie\u2019s body fell to the ground and rolled back dozens of times before he was pressed down by a pair of hands.\u201cHe actually injured Young Master Jie. Brothers, go, cripple him!\u201dWhen he saw more than ten people suddenly appear on the other side, all of them were strong and their martial arts skills were not bad, Chu Nan was immediately shocked.\u201cDamn, someone ambushed me out of nowhere. Now, there\u2019s even such a group of people besieging me. Who did I provoke?!\u201dChu Nan cursed in his mind. He exerted strength with his feet and a trace of internal breath stretched out. His body shot towards the dozen people like an arrow. Then, he forcefully found the gap between the fists and feet of the dozen people and kicked one of them flying.Taking advantage of the gap revealed by the kick, Chu Nan\u2019s body tilted and he flashed into the underground exit behind the dozen people. He sprinted and instantly left them behind.As soon as he arrived on the ground, Chu Nan turned around and saw that the dozen people who were still chasing after him had disappeared.It seemed that because there were too many people on the ground, they were also wary in broad daylight.Chu Nan frowned as he walked towards the entrance of the venue.\u201cStrange, that guy was much stronger than my opponent in the virtual space. He should at least be a higher-level Internal Breath Martial Artist. When did I offend an expert of this level?\u201dCoupled with the dozen plus black-clothed people who appeared later on who were similarly skilled, it could be obvious that this ambush was absolutely premeditated, and these fellows were still organized.\u201cWho have I offended recently?\u201d Chu Nan carefully thought about his recent experiences and a face appeared in his mind. \u201cLuo Li! It must be him! Other than the famous martial arts family on West Cloud Planet, where else could anyone find so many experts?\u201dWhen he thought of this, Chu Nan was immediately furious.He had only injured Luo Li in the qualification competition, but he had actually suffered such a vicious revenge from the Luo Clan!That Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist had attacked extremely ruthlessly just now. Although it did not seem like he wanted to kill him, every move he made wanted to cripple him.Chu Nan clenched his fists tightly and made cracking sounds.\u201cHey, Chu Nan, you\u2019re finally here. We\u2019ve been waiting for so long.\u201d Dong Fang\u2019s voice suddenly sounded from ahead. Chu Nan had already walked to the entrance of the venue and was seen by the sharp-eyed Dong Fang.Chu Nan took a deep breath and suppressed the anger in his heart before revealing a smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I almost got lost.\u201d\u201cLost? Don\u2019t you know how to use your personal terminal to check the area map?\u201d Rose blinked her eyes and asked in surprise. She clearly felt that the explanation given by Chu Nan was unbelievable.\u201cYou can even find this online?\u201d Chu Nan widened his eyes and pretended to be surprised.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s very easy to find it on the Federation\u2019s transportation network.\u201d Rose looked at Chu Nan in disbelief, \u201cChu Nan, you don\u2019t even know this? Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t usually go online.\u201d\u201cI can prove this. This kid really doesn\u2019t go online often,\u201d Dong Fang interrupted.\u201cThat\u2019s true. You\u2019re also a martial artist. If you go online often, how can you not play \u2018Martial Soul\u2019?\u201d Speaking up to this point, Rose suddenly became excited, \u201cHey, Chu Nan, I heard from Dong Fang that you used to play Martial Soul with him. Why did you stop playing it later?\u201dChu Nan blinked, \u201cDo you think I\u2019llI tell you that I stopped playing because I was beaten too many times?\u201dRose and Luo Lan were stunned, and then they could not help but chuckle.\u201cHa\u2026 haha, it\u2019s too fun. Chu Nan, you\u2019re really interesting.\u201dRose held her stomach with one hand and burst out laughing while her other hand patted Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder. Although she had only known Chu Nan for less than a day, they felt that they were already very familiar with him.\u201cWhy don\u2019t\u2026 you come back and play now? Don\u2019t worry, Dong Fang said that your martial technique has improved quite a bit compared to before. You won\u2019t be beaten so many times. Moreover, you don\u2019t know this, but there are many newbies in the Martial Soul now. There are even many entry-level fellows around. Even if your martial technique hasn\u2019t improved, you won\u2019t always be beaten like before.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll consider it.\u201d Chu Nan touched his nose and smiled. He was about to say something when his gaze suddenly froze.Sensing his abnormality, the three of them followed his gaze but saw nothing other than the bustling crowd.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Rose asked curiously.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just that the person over there looks like an acquaintance of mine.\u201d Chu Nan shook his head.In fact, the figure he saw was one of the ten plus people who had just emerged from the ground.However, he did not want to say this out loud and make the three of them worry for no reason.\u201cOh.\u201dRose and Luo Lan did not pay much attention to it, but Dong Fang frowned slightly.As Chu Nan\u2019s roommate for more than two years, his understanding of him was much deeper than others. With a glance, he could tell that Chu Nan was not lying.However, since Chu Nan was unwilling to reveal it in front of Rose and Luo Lan, it was naturally inconvenient for him to ask.After leaving the exchange, the four of them found a place to eat lunch together. In the afternoon, they walked around West Cloud City. Seeing that it was already late, because of the strict rules of West Cloud Academy and the exhortations of Rose and Luo Lan\u2019s family, they did not eat dinner together anymore and bade farewell.Before she left, Rose had already made an agreement with Chu Nan to let him return to Martial Soul so that it would be easier to contact him in the future.Helpless, Chu Nan could only agree.On the way back to West Cloud Academy, Chu Nan told Dong Fang everything that had happened in the underground space.\u201cWhat! They actually ambushed you?\u201d If they were not on the floating bus, Dong Fang would probably have jumped up in anxiety.Even so, he could not suppress the agitation in his heart. He slapped his palm heavily on the chair. With his strength as a third-stage Overlord Body, this palm nearly pierced through the chair.Fortunately, there were not many people on the floating bus at this moment, so it did not cause any commotion.\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s someone from the Luo family?\u201d Dong Fang finally suppressed his anger and asked in a low voice.Chu Nan shook his head slightly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m only guessing. The person I\u2019ve offended recently seems to be only Luo Li. Apart from the Luo family, it\u2019s very difficult to find any faction on West Cloud Planet that has so many experts.\u201dDong Fang naturally believed Chu Nan\u2019s judgment and his expression immediately sank.\u201cThe Luo family? Hmph, do they really think they can do anything they want on the West Cloud Planet?\u201d Dong Fang lowered his head in thought for a moment before suddenly jumping up from the chair and patted Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder, \u201cIt should not be dangerous to take the public transport back to the academy from here. Be careful when you return alone.\u201dChu Nan was immediately stunned. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201dDong Fang did not answer and only waved his hand at Chu Nan before walking to the door.Coincidentally, the bus arrived at the station and the door opened. Dong Fang waved at Chu Nan and jumped off the bus, instantly disappearing into the crowd.Chu Nan could not help but feel puzzled. However, Dong Fang had already disappeared and there was no place for him to ask.\u2026In the north of West Cloud City, a tall building towered into the clouds.This was the most luxurious hotel on West Cloud Planet, the Vartz Hotel. It was usually the first choice for all the esteemed guests who came to West Cloud Planet from other planets.The top floor of the building was the location of the most luxurious Presidential Suite in the entire hotel. Most of the powerful figures who were usually famous on West Cloud Planet would reserve a suite here for a long time as a backup. However, now, the entire floor was tightly sealed by the hotel and no one could approach.This was because the entire floor was covered by someone.Under normal circumstances, such a thing would definitely cause criticism, but now, no one dared to have any complaints.This was because this floor was reserved by the West Cloud Planet\u2019s government, and only two people lived on this floor.These two people were the two Star-Grade Martial Artists, Norman and Mu Yutong.In one of the rooms on the east side of the highest level, Mu Yutong sat steadily on the luxurious sofa in the middle of the living room. His eyes stared at the huge virtual screen not far away from him without blinking.Beside him, a young man who looked to be in his early thirties stood with his hands by his side, his expression respectful.This young man was Mu Yutong\u2019s eldest disciple, Zheng Yuanlin. He was actually 43 years old this year, but because his Internal Breath was deep, he looked to be only in his early 30s.Zheng Yunlin had been practicing martial arts with Mu Yutong since he was six years old. It had been 37 years since then.Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s talent was not especially powerful and he was only an initial-stage Heaven Control Realm Martial Artist to date, so he was not the strongest among the 13 disciples of Mu Yutong. However, because he had followed Mu Yutong for the longest time, he had always been the most trusted. Most of the time, he was directly responsible for dealing with the matters under Mu Yutong.\u201cYuanlin, what do you think?\u201d Mu Yutong suddenly asked.Zheng Yuanlin glanced at the scene playing on the virtual screen and bowed. \u201cTeacher, your judgment is indeed correct. This student called Chu Nan\u2019s martial arts talent can definitely be considered top-notch among the people I know.\u201dThe scene displayed on the large screen was the battle between Chu Nan and Luo Jie during the day.Hearing Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s answer, Mu Yutong nodded slightly and suddenly asked, \u201cHow is it compared to Tianyou?\u201dZheng Yuanlin was shocked.Qi Tianyou was the youngest disciple of Mu Yutong. He had only followed Mu Yutong to cultivate martial arts at the age of 13. He had just passed 20 this year and was already a third-stage Void Break Martial Artist. He had always been praised as the most outstanding martial arts genius under Mu Yutong.Teacher actually compared him to Chu Nan? Wasn\u2019t he overestimating that kid called Chu Nan?Previously, when he was at West Cloud Academy, he had inadvertently seen the battle between Chu Nan and Luo Li. At that time, his performance had already attracted the teacher\u2019s attention.Today, when Zheng Yunlin obtained the information about the recent activities of the Luo family from other channels, his teacher focused most of his attention on this recording.The reason why this recording was sent over was because it recorded the whereabouts of Luo Jie, who was reputed to be the top genius of the new generation of the Luo family. However, he did not expect that it happened to include the part where he fought with Chu Nan.The teacher\u2019s focus was not on Luo Jie, the genius of the Luo family, but on Chu Nan.Of course, Zheng Yuanlin had to admit that through the scene playing on the screen, Chu Nan had indeed displayed astonishing strength.With his mere Overlord Body level strength, he was actually able to continuously suppress a second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist like Luo Jie.Just based on this point, it was not an exaggeration to call him a genius.However, in Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s heart, Chu Nan was still incomparable to Qi Tianyou.\u201cYou must think that he\u2019s inferior to Qi Tianyou, right?\u201d As if seeing through Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s thoughts, Mu Yutong exposed him.\u201cYes, Master. Just from this battle, I feel that he has even more abundant combat experience, which is why he can keep suppressing the other party. Although I\u2019m very curious where he got such rich combat experience at such a young age, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s comparable to Little Junior Brother in terms of martial arts talent,\u201d Zheng Yuanlin honestly stated his thoughts.\u201cYuanlin, your perception is still a little lacking.\u201d Mu Yutong sighed lightly and stretched out his finger to draw a line. The scene on the virtual screen quickly played backwards. He said, \u201cTake a look again and pay attention to the difference in Chu Nan\u2019s initial and final performance.\u201dZheng Yuanlin frowned and looked at the virtual screen. Ever since he got this battle recording, he had watched it with his teacher nearly ten times. What else had he failed to notice?\u201cWatch his punch carefully,\u201d Mu Yutong reminded.After receiving Mu Yutong\u2019s reminder, Zheng Yuanlin hurriedly focused his gaze and seriously observed Chu Nan\u2019s every punch on the screen.With a closer look, Zheng Yuanlin immediately saw something.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Did you see anything?\u201d Mu Yutong asked with a smile.Zheng Yuanlin lowered his head and thought for a moment, and then he organized his thoughts in his heart before slowly answering, \u201cMaster, he\u2026 he seems to be able to improve in battle? In the beginning, every punch he threw seemed to be slightly stiff and astringent, but later on, every punch was very natural. Moreover, if I\u2019m not wrong, his fist strength is increasing bit by bit. Look, this is the last punch\u2026\u201dZheng Yuanlin stretched out his finger, causing the recording on the big screen to stop at the moment when Chu Nan sent Luo Jie flying with his last punch.\u201cAlthough Luo Jie\u2019s Internal Breath must have been greatly exhausted at this moment, under the circumstances that he has defense, Chu Nan\u2019s punch could actually send him flying and even injure him by spitting out blood. I speculate that\u2026 he must have used his Internal Breath in this punch. Otherwise, with his physical strength, it\u2019s impossible for him to unleash such a powerful punch.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not bad that you can see this,\u201d Mu Yutong nodded in approval. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen the most important point.\u201dMu Yutong pointed at Chu Nan on the virtual screen, \u201cWatch his entire body.\u201dZheng Yuanlin stared at it for a moment before shaking his head. \u201cMaster, forgive me for my poor vision.\u201dMu Yutong shook his head lightly and sighed, \u201cAll of you will only pay attention to the cultivation of your Internal Breath, but you have forgotten the most basic elements of martial arts. It\u2019s to try your best to unleash your own strength. Look, Chu Nan\u2019s posture can ensure that every inch of his muscles can erupt with a hundred percent physical strength. Compared to this, it\u2019s not a big deal if he can use his Internal Breath to punch.\u201d\u201cOne hundred percent? That\u2019s impossible!\u201d Zheng Yuanlin could not help but raise his voice. \u201cMaster, you once told us that it\u2019s impossible for a person to unleash one hundred percent of their strength because it requires every inch of his body to be perfectly utilized. How old is Chu Nan? Even if he has practiced this punch since he was young, it\u2019s impossible for him to achieve this!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the truth,\u201d Mu Yutong said casually, \u201cI can\u2019t explain how he did it, so I can only call it\u2026 talent.\u201dZheng Yuanlin turned around and glanced at Chu Nan who was frozen on the screen. His expression changed and he asked, \u201cMaster, what you mean is\u2026\u201dMu Yutong narrowed his eyes and looked at Chu Nan on the screen before suddenly letting out a long sigh.\u201cIf I could have met him ten years earlier, I could almost definitely have taught a true expert. Unfortunately\u2026\u201dZheng Yuanlin was silent.His teacher had already mentioned this when he left West Cloud Academy last time. If he mentioned it again now, it was obvious that he felt pity for Chu Nan.Mu Yutong was silent for a moment before suddenly instructing Zheng Yuanlin, \u201cYuanlin, go see him.\u201dZheng Yuanlin looked at Mu Yutong in surprise and waited for him to explain further.\u201cBefore we set off this time, President Lin once hoped that I could help him find a few good seedlings. Even though Chu Nan is old and his future achievements will definitely be limited, his talent is not bad and his combat awareness is especially outstanding. It\u2019s a good choice to poach him. No matter what, it\u2019s much better than staying in this small West Cloud Academy.\u201dZheng Yuanlin immediately understood Mu Yutong\u2019s meaning and nodded in agreement.Mu Yutong\u2019s gaze shifted and landed on Luo Jie who was sent flying by Chu Nan\u2019s punch. He sneered again.\u201cThis Luo family has been tyrannizing the West Cloud Planet for so long. This time, they\u2019ve also rejected the new governance of the federation in every way possible. They won\u2019t cooperate, so there\u2019s no need to keep them anymore. After eliminating them, you know what to do next.\u201d\u201cThis disciple understands.\u201dZheng Yuanlin naturally understood that after finding an excuse to eliminate the Luo family, the martial arts family with the greatest influence on West Cloud Planet, Mu Yutong\u2019s faction should naturally take over the matters on West Cloud Planet.Although Mu Yutong was a Star-Grade Martial Artist, he and his disciples still had to eat.After discussing for a while, Zheng Yuanlin bowed respectfully to Mu Yutong and left the room.As soon as he went out, he had only taken two steps when the door of a room in front of him suddenly opened. Someone came out and walked towards Zheng Yuanlin.Zheng Yuanlin hurriedly stopped in his tracks and bowed respectfully to the other party from afar.\u201cSenior Norman.\u201dThe person was tall, had a rough face, and an extremely strong physique. On his head was a natural green hair that was the signature trait of the Phezzan Federation. It was the other Star-Grade Martial Artist, Norman, who had come to West Cloud Planet with Mu Yutong.After seeing Zheng Yuanlin, he opened his mouth and let out a rough laugh.\u201cHa, Kid Zheng, your teacher has already been on West Cloud Planet for a few days. Help me ask him if he has encountered any good fellows?\u201dChu Nan\u2019s appearance flashed past Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s mind. He bowed slightly and replied, \u201cMy master is busy with work these few days and has no time to pay attention to private matters.\u201d\u201cBusy?\u201d Norman smiled, \u201cFinding a suitable disciple is also very important business. It\u2019s only a few years until the next invitation from the royal family of Declan. Isn\u2019t he anxious?\u201dZheng Yuanlin was silent for a moment before saying indifferently, \u201cThe martial arts of the Earth Federation is flourishing and there are many geniuses. I believe we can always find a suitable candidate.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Norman raised his eyebrows and suddenly raised his hand to slap Zheng Yuanlin.Zheng Yuanlin was shocked. The first thought in his mind was to dodge, but he immediately suppressed it and remained motionless.Norman\u2019s hand instantly arrived at an extremely fast speed, but in the end, it lightly patted Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s shoulder.\u201cNot bad, not bad.\u201d Norman gently patted Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s shoulder twice, his tone filled with praise. \u201cMu Yutong is indeed capable of teaching a disciple like you. However, Kid Zheng, your Earth Federation is only a remote small place. What do you mean by martial arts flourishing and geniuses being abundant? Be careful not to get treated as a joke by others.\u201d\u201cThank you for your guidance, Senior, but since I\u2019ve said this, I\u2019m not afraid that others will hear me,\u201d Zheng Yuanlin replied calmly.\u201cAlright, I like arrogant kids like you.\u201d Normam laughed again, this time slapping Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s shoulder twice, \u201cIf Mu Yutong doesn\u2019t want you anymore one day, you can join me. I welcome you at any time.\u201d\u201cA teacher for a day is a father for life. Since I have already entered the sect, how can I transfer to another teacher? Senior Norman, I urge you to take back this sentence,\u201d Zheng Yuanlin said seriously.\u201cYou people from the Earth Federation are so stubborn.\u201d Norman shook his head and walked past Zheng Yuanlin. In a short while, he disappeared from the corner of the corridor of the hotel.Zheng Yuanlin turned around and looked at his back, feeling puzzled.Did this Star-Grade Martial Artist suddenly appear in front of him just to say this nonsense?\u201cYuanlin.\u201d A voice suddenly sounded beside Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s ear.Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He hurriedly replied in a low voice, \u201cTeacher, you heard that?\u201dThe air that could vibrate with sound waves could also be gathered into a line and sent into the designated location without any disorder. It could still be heard clearly. This was something that only martial artists with extremely fine control of their internal breath could do. Generally speaking, only martial artists who had reached the Heaven Control realm could do this.Of course, this was not a problem for Mu Yutong and Zheng Yuanlin.\u201cThis guy is just saying it for me to hear. How can I not hear it?\u201d Mu Yutong\u2019s tone was still calm. One could not sense any reaction to what he had just said.\u201cThen what does he mean\u2026\u201d\u201cIgnore him and do what you need to do.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zheng Yuanlin composed himself and quickly left.In the room, Mu Yutong slowly opened his eyes. His gaze passed through the side of the bed and looked in the direction where Norman had left. A strange smile appeared on his face.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that I\u2019m anxious? You actually came to West Cloud Planet with me this time. Aren\u2019t you even more anxious than me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u201cAchoo!\u201dChu Nan suddenly sneezed.He reached out to rub his nose and looked left and right in confusion. He thought to himself that although there was occasionally a chill in the early summer night, with his current body strength, he could not feel it at all. How could he still sneeze?Shaking his head to throw away his doubts, Chu Nan\u2019s knees sank and he threw a punch. It was the first move of the first stance of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist, Sitting Horse Rush Fist.As he threw this punch, Chu Nan clearly felt an internal breath flowing out from his dantian and towards his right arm.With the enhancement of the Internal Breath, the strength of this punch immediately increased greatly. When it was thrown, a muffled bang sounded in the black space under the night sky.After the battle during the day, Chu Nan discovered another benefit of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist. It could mobilize his Internal Breath with the fist technique and greatly increase the power of the fist technique.This discovery surprised Chu Nan.To martial artists, being able to mobilize their Internal Breath to complement their moves was something that only Internal Breath Martial Artists who had reached a certain level could do.If one\u2019s Internal Breath was not strong enough, if they rashly did this, it was very likely that they would lose control of their Internal Breath because it was insufficient. If it was serious, it would even cause chaotic Internal Breath flow and it was very easy to injure their meridians. Therefore, under normal circumstances, only Internal Breath Martial Artists would do this.Of course, if Overlord Body Martial Artists were not worried about their meridians being injured, they could forcefully do this.Chu Nan was very clear about the various statistics of his body. His current physical strength could only reach the level of a third-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist. Although his Internal Breath was thicker because he had been cultivating the Nine Revolutions Technique for a long time and his Internal Breath had greatly increased after being modified by the data, it was very difficult for him to easily mobilize his Internal Breath to complement his moves.He did not expect that he would be able to mobilize his Internal Breath to increase the power of the fist technique when he used the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist Technique. It was truly beyond Chu Nan\u2019s expectations.After returning to the academy, Chu Nan went to a quiet corner and started practicing alone.With his experience in battle with Luo Jie, when Chu Nan used the three stances and twelve moves of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist, every move could be perfectly executed. Therefore, every move and stance could automatically mobilize the Internal Breath in his dantian.With every punch, his Internal Breath flowed from his dantian to his left and right arms before flowing back to his arms. Chu Nan discovered that the strength in his arms was getting stronger and the Internal Breath in his dantian was also getting stronger.This fist technique could not only be used to defend against enemies, it could even be used to regulate one\u2019s breathing!Feeling the strengthening of the Internal Breath in his dantian, Chu Nan admired the martial artist who created this fist technique greatly.This Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist was clearly an external martial technique, but it was able to automatically mobilize internal breath and even harmonize internal breath. What kind of martial arts genius was the martial artist who created this fist technique!If he had not unintentionally obtained this fist technique, even if he could defeat that person in the end, he would have to pay a painful price.Sitting Horse Rush Fist, Retreating Horse Stab Fist, Shooting Horse Hook Fist\u2026As his Internal Breath circulated in his dantian, Chu Nan\u2019s movement technique became more and more smooth and natural. Gradually, he had perfectly fused the three stances and twelve moves together. With every punch, he naturally followed up with another punch without any stiffness.As the saying went: If the intent is there, the fist will be there. If the intent moves, the fist will move.Unknowingly, Chu Nan\u2019s Internal Breath not only flowed from his dantian to his arms, but also to his legs, waist, and back\u2026Gradually, his Internal Breath began to flow through his entire body. It seemed to have no purpose, but as long as he needed strength, it would instantly flow to anywhere.Chu Nan only felt that his entire body seemed to have become boundless in strength and energy.Crack!There was suddenly the sound of a tree branch breaking behind him.At this moment, Chu Nan was immersed in an extremely happy state. When he heard the sound, he quickly determined the exact location through the various statistics of the sound. He stepped on the ground with his left foot and used it as the center of the circle. He twisted his waist to the left and drew an almost perfect semicircle with his right fist in front of the right foot pagoda before throwing a punch in the direction of the sound.It was the third stance and the fourth move of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist, Shooting Horse Cup Fist.\u201cGood timing!\u201d A soft shout sounded, and then a strong wind assaulted him.Slap!Chu Nan\u2019s fist collided with something, but it emitted a muffled sound as if it had hit a dead tree.He was shocked.Due to the fact that he had Internal Breath on his fist, the force behind it was as high as 713.43898 kilograms. Although it could not compare to the last punch when he was ambushed in the underground parking lot, it was still shocking enough.However, the other party easily received it. Moreover, it was as if his fist had struck a piece of tattered leather. He did not feel any pressure at all, and his fist could not unleash its full power.After the strike, Chu Nan immediately took two steps back and assumed a posture as he sized up the other party.Standing opposite him was a thin young man who was half a head taller than Chu Nan. Therefore, he looked like a bamboo pole.When he saw Chu Nan looking over, he raised his hand and smiled as he greeted him.\u201cHeh, you\u2019re a student of our academy? Why didn\u2019t I have any impression of you in the past?\u201dSeeing that the other party did not seem to have any hostility, Chu Nan was slightly relieved. He sized up the other party and realized that he seemed to have some impression of him.If he did not remember wrongly, this person seemed to be a rather famous senior in the higher grades of the academy. He did not know why he had come to the dormitory area of the lower grades.\u201cI\u2019m only an ordinary student. It\u2019s normal for Senior to not have any impression of me,\u201d Chu Nan replied indifferently.\u201cOrdinary student?\u201d The other party shook his head, \u201cImpossible. From the way you were cultivating just now, I\u2019m certain that your martial arts technique will definitely be ranked at the top among the low-grade students of the academy. However, you\u2019re not two annoying fellows, Luo Li and Feng Xiao. Who exactly are you?\u201dWhen he heard this person evaluate Luo Li and Feng Xiao as \u2018annoying fellows\u2019, Chu Nan\u2019s guard against him involuntarily relaxed again. He thought for a moment and smiled. \u201cMy name is Chu Nan. I believe you must have never heard of me before.\u201d\u201cChu Nan?\u201d That person frowned and shook his head, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of you. Could it be that you\u2019re really not famous? That\u2019s impossible\u2026 You\u2019re clearly very strong\u2026\u201dHearing him admit that he had never heard of his name, Chu Nan felt a little strange.Logically speaking, he had defeated Luo Li in public and severely injured him, causing a considerable commotion in the academy. Not to mention the lower grade students, even the higher grade students should have heard of it.However, this was not important. Since Chu Nan\u2019s cultivation had been interrupted, he was unwilling to continue in front of outsiders. He smiled and nodded at that person before turning around to leave.\u201cHey, I finally met a good opponent. How can I let you leave like this? Take this!\u201dUnexpectedly, he had just taken a step when the person behind him cried out softly again, and a strong wind assaulted him from behind.Chu Nan could not help but frown. He turned around again and used Shooting Horse Cup Fist before accurately receiving the palm strike.This time, when their fists collided, Chu Nan\u2019s body shook violently and he was forced to take a few steps back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, he stood on the spot and frowned as he stared at Chu Nan with an extremely dissatisfied expression.\u201cHey, if you don\u2019t want to spar with me, just say it. What\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201dChu Nan ignored him and lowered his head to look at his right hand with a frown.Although this punch earlier was slightly different from the one this person had suddenly used when he appeared earlier, it could be considered the standard third stance and fourth move of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u2014Shooting Horse Cup Fist, and it was sufficient to exert his strength that was infinitely close to 100%.However, the final effect was that the punch just now could be on par with this person. Now, this punch was obviously much worse, causing the other party to complain that he was sparring half-heartedly.Of course, Chu Nan knew that he had already used his full strength in this punch. The reason why there was such an obvious difference was because he had used his full strength with the Internal Breath mobilized earlier, but he did not manage to unleash it in this punch. The difference in strength was obvious.\u201cWhy did this punch not carry any internal breath?\u201d Chu Nan frowned in confusion.\u201cStop daydreaming. Again!\u201dHowever, that person did not give Chu Nan any time to continue thinking. He stepped forward and slapped again.The speed of this palm was actually not fast, and it even looked a little light at first glance. However, when it entered Chu Nan\u2019s eyes, countless fine statistics combined together, allowing him to immediately determine that no matter which direction he moved in, the other party could immediately make the corresponding changes without any difficulty.\u201cGood palm technique!\u201dChu Nan could not help but praise. Without dodging, he stood on his left foot and took a step forward with his right foot. He placed his left fist on his waist and twisted his body along with his right foot. His right arm quickly stretched out and his right fist struck out with a gust of wind.It was the first move of the first stance recorded on the introduction page of \u201cHong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u201d\u2014Sitting Horse Rush Fist.Slap!Chu Nan\u2019s fist struck the palm of that person without any mistakes, and another muffled sound was heard.That person did not move at all, but Chu Nan\u2019s body swayed twice. He used this opportunity to exquisitely eliminate the powerful recoil from that person\u2019s palm. His right leg pressed down forcefully, and his right foot firmly stepped on the ground. His body suddenly twisted to the right, and his left leg stepped forward as he swung his left fist diagonally.The first stance and second move of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u2014Sitting Horse Stab Fist.There was almost no gap between the second and first punch. He even borrowed the force of the person\u2019s counterattack to adjust his body even faster. His entire movement was completed in one go.Just as that person was about to slap him, he discovered that Chu Nan\u2019s punch was aimed at the space under his ribs and he was forced to withdraw his palm.Slap!This time, when their fists collided, their bodies shook and Chu Nan was not inferior.However, Chu Nan still frowned with an unsatisfied expression.This punch was forced to change moves by the other party, so he naturally could not use his full strength. The recoil from his palm immediately decreased from more than 800 kilograms from the previous two strikes to less than 500 kilograms.On the contrary, Chu Nan had already made an accurate calculation and judgment based on the accurate data. He had mobilized all his strength in this punch, but the two of them were still evenly matched.From this, it could be seen that with his physical strength, it was impossible for Chu Nan to surpass the other party.However, what made Chu Nan dissatisfied was not this, but that he was still unable to successfully mobilize his Internal Breath.This puzzled him.Previously, when he was facing the sneak attack in the underground parking lot and when he was secretly practicing the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist, he had clearly been able to punch while mobilizing his Internal Breath. Why could he not do it now?In the intense battle, how could he allow Chu Nan to slowly think about the problem?That person received Chu Nan\u2019s punch and did not gain any advantage. He let out a soft exclamation filled with surprise before his body swayed strangely and he diagonally darted to the left of Chu Nan\u2019s body. His left hand seemed to have casually swayed as it headed straight for Chu Nan.At this moment, Chu Nan struck out with his left fist and his body leaned forward. His left side was weak, so it should be very difficult for him to counterattack in a proper posture. The best choice was to retreat and avoid it.However, Chu Nan\u2019s body suddenly fell to the right and his entire body fell, avoiding his palm.When his body was about to reach the ground, Chu Nan had already retracted his right fist into a palm. He slapped the ground hard and bounced up using the recoil.While his body was still in midair, his waist had already twisted along the recoil to the left. His right fist struck out, aiming at the lower left rib after the left palm struck.Although his posture was extremely strange, if one were to slightly adjust the angle of the scene, they would discover that the upper half of Chu Nan\u2019s body was still in the standard third stance second move of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u2014Shooting Horse Stab Fist.Bang!This time, although that person still reacted in time and twisted his body, using his right palm to block Chu Nan\u2019s punch, when the fist and palm collided, the muffled sound was not like hitting a dead tree, but a solid and normal collision.From the reaction force coming from his palm, it was only 437.983749 kilograms. Chu Nan knew that the other party had clearly reacted even more hastily than before, so he was unable to completely use his internal breath and could not unleash the full strength of his palm.However, Chu Nan was not satisfied.Although he had a slight advantage in this punch because of his abnormally fast reaction speed, the important thing was that he still could not use his Internal Breath in this punch.The mysterious realm that he had unintentionally entered when he was attacked and practicing his fist earlier flashed through his mind. Chu Nan suddenly took two steps back and avoided that person\u2019s subsequent counterattack.\u201cPlease wait!\u201dThat person stopped and looked at Chu Nan in shock with a slightly dissatisfied expression.In the previous two exchanges, he had been slightly passive due to Chu Nan\u2019s abnormally fast and precise counterattack. Although his Internal Breath was clearly deeper than Chu Nan\u2019s, he did not even have the chance to unleash it.However, this situation did not make him feel aggrieved. Instead, he was a little excited.How could it be so easy to encounter such a special opponent?Just as he was about to perk up and properly spar with Chu Nan, this opponent suddenly stopped!\u201cHey, Chu\u2026 hmm, Chu Nan, right? You\u2019re having a good time fighting, why are you shouting for me to stop?\u201dHearing the complaints in his tone, Chu Nan could not help but laugh. He felt that this person was quite a martial arts fanatic.\u201cI\u2019ve encountered some problems and can\u2019t unleash my full strength. Give me some time.\u201dThat person was immediately amused.\u201cYou mean\u2026 you\u2019ve been hiding your strength and giving in to me just now?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Chu Nan shook his head. \u201cI just\u2026\u201d Chu Nan frowned and thought for a moment, \u201cI can\u2019t feel it.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t feel it?\u201d That person was surprised, \u201cWhat do you not feel?\u201dChu Nan did not answer. He only lowered his head and thought for a moment before gesturing to the person to stop and retreated to the side.After concentrating for a moment, he bent his legs and sank. His feet moved left and right, and the distance was just above his shoulders. His fists were clenched at his waist at the same time. Then, he suddenly twisted his waist to the left, causing his right body to spin violently. His right hand clenched into a fist and squeezed out.Bang!A muffled explosion sounded.Chu Nan\u2019s punch affected the air and caused an air explosion.The person watching raised his eyebrows.As an expert of the Internal Breath realm, he could naturally tell that Chu Nan\u2019s punch did not contain any Internal Breath, but it still produced such a terrifying force. It could be seen that not only was Chu Nan\u2019s physical strength tempered extremely outstanding, he was also extremely skilled in using it.When he recalled how he had clashed with Chu Nan three times earlier, other than the first time, he did not sense any Internal Breath surging from his fist the remaining two times. However, he could still sense an abnormally powerful force from it. He could not help but feel a little shocked.It was obvious that this junior student called Chu Nan had yet to reach the stage where he could freely circulate his Internal Breath. He could actually use such a powerful force with his physical strength alone. It had simply surpassed the limit of an ordinary martial artist\u2019s physical body.He was certain that Chu Nan was still in the Overlord Body Realm, but he was definitely the most powerful Overlord body martial artist he had ever seen!Apart from that, from what he had unintentionally observed when Chu Nan was practicing his fist technique alone, he had probably touched the boundary of breaking through to the actual Internal Breath realm. That was why he told himself that he could not feel anything.\u201cHow does this kid plan to find the feeling?\u201dHe could not help but feel curious and took two steps back to give Chu Nan more space to observe his movements.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His body turned right and his left fist that had been curled up at his waist struck out diagonally.The first stance and third move of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist Technique\u2014Sitting Horse Hook Fist.\u2026Just like that, Chu Nan practiced the moves according to the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist.At first, perhaps because someone was beside him, although his movements and posture were still very standard, there would always be a slight deviation due to some reservations, causing him to be unable to display the most perfect strength and speed.After discovering this problem, Chu Nan paused for a moment and took a deep breath. He focused his mind and threw another punch.This time, as he punched again and again, the muffled sounds of air explosions could be heard in the forest.After practicing the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist Technique, Chu Nan once again recalled the feeling of practicing it alone.After he finished the last move, Chu Nan did not stop. His figure moved and he threw another punch.Bang!The person beside him raised his eyebrows again.When Chu Nan first practiced this unknown fist technique, it was obvious that he was only using his powerful physical strength. Although it was shocking, he was still unable to escape the limitations of an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist.However, when he used this punch again, there was already a trace of Internal Breath attached to his fist, causing the strength of the fist to increase greatly, and the sound of the air explosion was obviously much louder.This made that person very puzzled.Previously, when he unintentionally saw Chu Nan practicing his fist alone, it was obvious that he already possessed the ability to casually mobilize his Internal Breath. This was the reason why he was not at a disadvantage in his first confrontation.However, in the subsequent battle between Chu Nan and him, as well as his earlier practice, he was extremely disappointed. He even thought that Chu Nan was deliberately holding back, preventing him from enjoying himself.However, Chu Nan\u2019s punch actually contained Internal Breath, so why?After some thought, he decided to remain calm and observe the situation for the time being.On the other hand, Chu Nan completely ignored the thoughts of the person beside him. He felt a trace of Internal Breath being mobilized in his Sitting Horse Rush Fist and could not help but feel joy in his heart. The next move of the Sitting Horse Stab Fist returned to normal and could not mobilize any Internal Breath.Chu Nan hurriedly calmed his mind and obediently focused.The Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist was very simple. It only took three stances and twelve moves in total. It took less than half a minute to complete all of them.Chu Nan practiced it over and over again and was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was not an illusion.Although the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist looked simple, as long as the posture was sufficiently perfect, it could indeed mobilize internal breath and increase the strength of the fist.However, Chu Nan was not satisfied.If he could only mobilize his Internal Breath as he pleased while practicing his fist alone, it would be meaningless.In a real battle, the enemy would not stand motionless like a wooden pillar, allowing you to punch in the most perfect posture.Without a nearly perfect posture to punch, he could not mobilize his Internal Breath. This was already proven through the short confrontation with that person.What Chu Nan did now was to let his body get used to mobilizing his Internal Breath when he punched with the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist. At the same time, he would figure out how his Internal Breath was mobilized.After practicing the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist for the third time, Chu Nan confirmed again that when he could perfectly combine the moves of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist with himself and unleash nearly 100% of his physical strength, he could indeed successfully mobilize his internal breath and increase its power.According to the manual of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist Technique, when he reached the realm of \u201cIf the intent is there, the fist will be there. If the intent moves, the fist will move\u201d, he would be able to successfully mobilize his Internal Breath.But what was this so-called \u201cintent\u201d?Chu Nan recalled the scene when he was attacked in the underground parking lot and sent the enemy flying with the last strike. He also recalled the scene when he was practicing his fist earlier, but he still could not understand it.In the end, Chu Nan stopped thinking and slowly exhaled. He looked at the person who was still looking at him with interest and nodded.\u201cCome.\u201dThat person smiled and said, \u201cWhat? Did you find a feeling?\u201dChu Nan did not answer. He stepped forward with his left foot and threw a punch.That person chuckled and did not say anything else. He leaned over and lightly slapped his palm.Slap!Another muffled sound that sounded like it had struck a dead tree sounded. That person did not move, but Chu Nan took a few steps back as a flush flashed across his face.\u201cHey, is this the feeling you\u2019re looking for?\u201d That person did not pursue and looked at Chu Nan with dissatisfaction, \u201cI\u2019ve waited for you for so long not to see such low standards. If you continue like this, do you believe I won\u2019t beat you up?\u201dChu Nan shook his head.In the punch just now, he had relied on his extremely powerful data ability to perfectly control all parts of his body to be exactly the same as when he was practicing his fist, but he was still unable to mobilize his Internal Breath.He could use his data ability to obtain the best solution when cultivating the Nine Revolutions Technique, but that was the result of countless experiments and even risking injuries and blood.If he wanted to resolve the problem of how to better mobilize his Internal Breath in battle, one method was to cultivate the cultivation method step by step and increase his Internal Breath. When he broke through to become a true Internal Breath Martial Artist, everything would naturally happen naturally.Another method was to collect enough data through a large number of battles and compare them with statistics.Or to put it another way, it was to obtain enough combat experience to make this special situation normal.Thinking of this, Chu Nan looked at the person opposite him again and said in a deep voice, \u201cAgain.\u201dThat person frowned and originally wanted to reject, but he did not expect that Chu Nan would immediately punch him again.\u201cHmph, if you still dare to trick me, I\u2019ll teach you a lesson today!\u201dWith a thought, that person flipped his palm and slapped Chu Nan.This time, he already looked down on Chu Nan. This palm strike was extremely casual and the internal breath on his palm only used less than 30% of his strength.Bang!When the fist and palm collided, that person suddenly discovered that the force coming from Chu Nan\u2019s fist was clearly much higher than the previous few times. Moreover, it even contained an extremely surging feeling.Under this strike, he was actually forced back by Chu Nan\u2019s punch and could not help but stagger a few steps back.That person was not shocked, but happy. He smiled.\u201cHa, that\u2019s more fun. Again!\u201dChu Nan recalled the situation of the punch earlier and memorized all the statistics. He twisted his body and threw another punch.However, this time, he did not succeed in mobilizing his Internal Breath.When that person saw that Chu Nan was almost sent flying by his palm strike, he frowned and did not understand what was going on.If Chu Nan really only wanted to do things half-heartedly, he could have directly rejected the challenge. Why did he need to use his Internal Breath for a while and not use it for no reason?But why did this guy look like he was able and unable to utilize it at random?The two of them were silent for a moment. They looked at each other and seemed to have a tacit understanding as they attacked at the same time.Bang!Chu Nan\u2019s fist with his Internal Breath collided with the palm of that person who also had a powerful Internal Breath. Their bodies swayed at the same time, but they were evenly matched.That person could not be bothered to think further and slapped out once more without holding back.Chu Nan was also silent. He twisted his feet and counterattacked with the Retreating Horse Stab FistSlap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosChu Nan walked into the dormitory building exhaustedly and felt his entire body sore and weak.The intense battle with that senior just now lasted for nearly half an hour.Although it was not a life and death battle, both sides had already done their best.In order to collect enough combat data, Chu Nan naturally hoped to fight as long as possible. That senior had a strange personality and actually fought with him until the end. When he saw that Chu Nan was exhausted, he reluctantly chose to stop.In the end, when Chu Nan bade him farewell, he even expressed that he was not satisfied with the battle between the two sides. This was because Chu Nan\u2019s so-called \u2018feeling\u2019 was sometimes effective but sometimes not, causing him to be unable to enjoy himself.When he thought of this, Chu Nan shook his head and smiled bitterly.In the end, he was only an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist. Although the Nine Revolutions Technique had already broken through to the third level and allowed his Internal Breath to greatly increase, he was still far from being a true Internal Breath expert. Of course, he was unable to fill his entire body with Internal Breath and circulate it freely, so it was very difficult for him to mobilize his Internal Breath with every move.It was very difficult, but not impossible.The problem that troubled Chu Nan now was why when he was attacked in the underground parking lot and when he was practicing the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist alone, he was able to mobilize his Internal Breath. However, in the battle with that senior earlier, he was unable to successfully mobilize it every time?Since it could happen before, it meant that it was possible.The reason why he could not do it now was definitely because something was still wrong.Due to the fact that he had been unable to break through with the Nine Revolutions Technique, his Internal Breath was far from being robust, so it was naturally impossible for him to mobilize his Internal Breath freely. Therefore, his understanding of Internal Breath was only at the most basic level.As for the various martial arts academies in the federation, they usually only taught students external martial arts techniques. As for internal cultivation methods, they would at most impart some of the most basic and ordinary commoner cultivation methods. They would not be too involved in this aspect.Therefore, even though Chu Nan had been studying at the West Cloud Academy for two years, he had not come into contact with much teaching regarding the cultivation method of Internal Breath, so he naturally did not know where to start.The development of the ancient martial arts of the Earth Federation had only begun gradually 730 years ago after it was discovered by a civilian exploration fleet of the Declan Empire.In comparison, their accumulation in all aspects was naturally inferior to that of an ancient power with more than 60,000 years of history in the Milky Way like the Declan Empire. They could not even compare to the other small countries around them.This situation was not obvious in external cultivation martial arts, but in internal cultivation martial arts, it was extremely exaggerated.The Overlord Tiger Subduing Fist that Luo Li cultivated was created by the ancestor of the Luo family. It was one of the top ten fist techniques in the federation. In the \u201cPan Milky Way Martial Skill Evaluation\u201d, it was even ranked as an A-rank martial technique. It was considered a very powerful external martial technique.However, the Nine Bulls Two Tiger Heart Technique he cultivated was only a Grade B Internal Cultivation Technique. In comparison, it was much worse.Although there was once an ancestor of the Luo family who relied on this internal cultivation method to ultimately grow into a powerful Star-Grade Martial Artist, besides this ancestor, there had never been any outstanding figures after the Luo family.However, even so, the Luo family\u2019s inheritance was an existence that countless martial artists in the entire Earth Federation were jealous of.One had to know that an ordinary martial artist like Chu Nan who did not have any inheritance could at most come into contact with internal cultivation methods like the ones taught by the West Cloud Academy. The highest rating was at most D-rank.A situation like the Nine Revolutions Cultivation Technique could be said to be completely unique. This was because under normal circumstances, no martial artist would casually announce the internal cultivation method that they had created like Su Xuansheng to the public and leave it to their descendants as a legacy.However, even then, because the difficulty of breaking through to the Nine Revolutions Technique was extremely high, no one had cultivated to the seventh level that was equivalent to Su Xuansheng for hundreds of years. Most people were even unable to break through to the third level, so they were classified as trash cultivation methods.From this, it could be seen how difficult it was to obtain a truly powerful internal cultivation method.Chu Nan did not possess the family inheritance like Luo Li. In terms of the cultivation of the Nine Revolutions Technique, because there were very few people and no one openly announced it, there was no possibility of reference, so he could only explore it himself.For example, Chu Nan was already prepared for such a problem today and was not surprised.\u201cHeh, when I was unable to break through to the second level after cultivating the Nine Revolutions Technique for more than ten years, I was not even anxious. Why would I be anxious now?\u201dWhen he thought of this, Chu Nan\u2019s mood calmed down and he even revealed a smile.While he was thinking about these things, he had already climbed to the third floor with difficulty and arrived at the door of his dormitory.After pushing open the dormitory door, he was stunned.In the dormitory, other than Dong Fang who had returned at some point, there was also a man who looked to be less than 30 years old sitting opposite Dong Fang and chatting with him with a smile on his face.After Chu Nan pushed open the door, the two of them stopped and turned around.\u201cYou\u2019re finally back.\u201d When Dong Fang saw Chu Nan, he stood up happily and quickly walked to his side. He patted his shoulder and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re really lucky this time!\u201d\u201cLucky?\u201d Chu Nan was stunned. His gaze landed on the man and he was immediately shocked.Although this man was only sitting there simply, it made him feel as if a mountain was standing there, as if it was impossible to shake.Although the vast amount of data in his mind clearly told him that this man\u2019s sitting posture was not perfect and he easily saw through countless flaws, Chu Nan was certain that if he dared to attack, he would definitely be met with a fierce and irresistible counterattack.This person must be an expert!Zheng Yuanlin put down the teacup in his hand and turned around to smile at Chu Nan who pushed open the door and walked in. He barely suppressed the surprise and shock in his mind.From the moment Chu Nan entered, although he seemed uncaring, he had actually been staring at every subtle action that this kid made.Then, he was extremely shocked to discover that although Chu Nan\u2019s actions seemed ordinary at any moment, with his profound martial technique and extraordinary vision, he did not discover any flaws from the beginning to the end!Zheng Yuanlin had followed Mu Yutong in martial arts for 37 years. During this period, he had seen countless martial artists, but those who could maintain such a perfect state at any time were extremely rare.This Chu Nan was only an initial-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist and looked to be only around 18 years old this year. How could he be like a martial artist with countless combat experience and be able to maintain such a perfect posture?What was even more shocking was that Chu Nan looked exhausted and his muscles were weakened. It was as if he had just experienced a huge battle and looked exhausted.However, even under such circumstances, he was still able to maintain such a perfect posture. It was even more shocking than normal.With this alone, Zheng Yuanlin believed that if he purely relied on his physical body to fight and did not use his Internal Breath and exquisite martial arts to forcefully suppress him, even he might not be able to easily defeat Chu Nan.\u201cNo wonder Teacher sees him in a new light. To be able to have such a performance at such an age, there\u2019s really no other explanation other than talent.\u201dWhen he thought of this, Zheng Yuanlin put away the contempt he had for Chu Nan and stood up with a smile. He stretched out his right hand towards Chu Nan, \u201cHello, let me introduce myself. I\u2019m Zheng Yuanlin, the eldest disciple of Master Mu Yutong.\u201d\u201cMu Yutong?\u201d Chu Nan originally stretched out his hand with a puzzled expression and was about to greet Zheng Yuanlin. When he suddenly heard this name, he was immediately shocked, \u201cCould it be the Star-Grade Martial Artist, Mu Yutong?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zheng Yuanlin smiled and nodded.Chu Nan glanced at Dong Fang in shock and saw him shrug his shoulders. Clearly, he had long known Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s identity.\u201cChu Nan, where have you been? You\u2019re back so late. Senior Zheng has been waiting here for nearly an hour.\u201d Dong Fang reminded him.\u201cOh, I was bored and went out to take a walk. I also wanted to practice my martial arts.\u201d When he saw Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s gaze landing on his feet, Chu Nan lowered his head and saw that the soles of his shoes were covered in mud. It was obvious that they had been stained in the wilderness when he returned from outside. He smiled and explained, \u201cI was afraid to disturb others in the academy, so I ran to the back mountain.\u201dZheng Yuanlin nodded and smiled. \u201cStudent Chu Nan, you are so diligent in your cultivation. No wonder you can have such an achievement.\u201d\u201cSenior, you must be joking. I\u2019m only at the initial-stage Overlord Body realm now. What can I be considered to have accomplished in front of you?\u201dZheng Yuanlin shook his head slightly, \u201cAlthough your Internal Breath is not strong, I can tell that your eyes are bright and reserved, and your skin is tough and shiny. It can be seen that your foundation in internal cultivation is very good. What you lack is only a good internal cultivation method. If a master teaches you a brilliant cultivation method, your internal breath will greatly increase. Coupled with your outstanding external cultivation talent, you can definitely become a powerful martial artist.\u201dChu Nan smiled bitterly. \u201cI come from an ordinary background and can\u2019t learn any profound internal cultivation methods.\u201d\u201cI heard from Student Dong Fang that the internal cultivation method you\u2019re cultivating now is the Nine Revolutions Technique?\u201d Zheng Yuanlin asked again.\u201cYes.\u201dZheng Yuanlin pondered for a moment and said, \u201cIt\u2019s true that Su Xuansheng relied on the seventh level of the Nine Revolutions Technique to dominate the Milky Way back then. However, in the past 400 years, no one has been able to cultivate this Nine Revolutions Technique to the seventh level, let alone the eighth and ninth levels. From this point of view, this Nine Revolutions Technique is not considered a powerful internal cultivation method.\u201d\u201cI have no choice.\u201d Chu Nan sighed.\u201cIs that so?\u201d Zheng Yuanlin smiled and suddenly stretched out his hand, \u201cChu Nan, how about we exchange a few moves?\u201dChu Nan and Dong Fang were shocked. Chu Nan waved his hand repeatedly, \u201cSenior Zheng, are you joking? If I remember correctly, you\u2019re a top-notch expert of the Heaven Control realm. How can I be your match?\u201dZheng Yuanlin laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I just want to test you. I won\u2019t go all out.\u201dChu Nan and Dong Fang looked at each other again. Zheng Yuanlin suddenly came to visit in the middle of the night and acted like this. Could it be\u2026Dong Fang\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he hurriedly poked Chu Nan\u2019s waist and revealed a brilliant smile at Zheng Yuanlin, \u201cSince Senior Zheng is willing to test, how could Chu Nan not agree? However, this place is so small and it\u2019s too late. The martial arts arena in the academy has long closed\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Zheng Yuanlin shook his head and asked Chu Nan, \u201cI believe you all know a game.\u201d\u201cGame?\u201d Chu Nan and Dong Fang were stunned, \u201cCould it be Martial Soul?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosTen minutes later, in the virtual arena provided by Martial Soul.Zheng Yuanlin slapped out with his palm. It seemed to be light, but it contained an extremely huge amount of Internal Breath, forcing Chu Nan to withdraw his right fist that was already half extended. He exerted force with his left leg and his body flew back.Chu Nan was a little depressed. It had been five minutes since he started fighting Zheng Yuanlin, but he still could not gain the slightest advantage.Ever since he obtained a powerful data collection, analysis, and processing ability in the virtual space, other than the first few battles, this was the first time he had encountered such a situation.Before this, even when he was fighting with the powerful martial artist with the strength of the Internal Breath realm in the day, he had always suppressed the other party from the beginning to the end.Of course, he also knew that although the person in the day was a powerful Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, he was completely unqualified to challenge this extremely powerful Heaven Control martial artist, Zheng Yuanlin.Novice, Overlord Body, Internal Breath, Void Break, and Heaven Control. There were two levels of difference between Internal Breath Martial Artists and Heaven Control martial artists.Furthermore, the further one went, the harder it was to cultivate. From the moment one stepped into the Internal Breath realm, it was extremely difficult for any martial artist to obtain any advancement.However, as long as he obtained any growth, this increase would be very obvious. Therefore, although the difference between an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist and a Heaven Control Realm Martial Artist seemed to be two levels, the difference in strength was more than hundreds of times.Facing a martial artist like Zheng Yuanlin who was at the peak of the Heaven Control realm, it was undoubtedly impossible for Chu Nan to gain the upper hand.However, Chu Nan was not convinced. From the beginning of this spar, Zheng Yuanlin had already stated that he would control the strength of his Internal Breath in battle and would not rely on his Internal Breath to suppress Chu Nan.If he only relied on external help, Chu Nan did not believe that he would lose to anyone with the help of his powerful data ability.Initially, Chu Nan felt that he still had hope, but after the battle began, he was surprised to discover that although Zheng Yuanlin had always controlled the strength of his Internal Breath to the extent of an Internal Breath Martial Artist, all his moves were extremely exquisite. Every move and style could vividly display his Internal Breath, and the power was far greater than those Internal Breath opponents he had faced in the past.Although Chu Nan could use his data ability to clearly see the speed, angle, and strength of each of Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s moves and clearly determine the trajectory of each move, every time he wanted to make a corresponding action, Zheng Yuanlin would change under almost impossible circumstances, causing his initial prediction to immediately fail.If not for the fact that Chu Nan\u2019s reaction time was infinitely close to zero, he would have been defeated by Zheng Yuanlin in the first move.Ever since the battle began, Chu Nan seemed to have been led by the nose by Zheng Yuanlin.This feeling of not being able to control the situation made Chu Nan very unhappy, but he could do nothing about it.Even if the strength of his Internal Breath was reduced, a Heaven Control realm expert was indeed far from what an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist like him could defeat.Chu Nan did not know that the shock in Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s heart was dozens of times greater than his.Although Zheng Yuanlin had already confirmed that Chu Nan\u2019s greatest advantage was in his reaction speed and accuracy when he watched the recording of the battle with Mu Yutong, before he truly sparred with him, although he admitted that Chu Nan was very talented in martial arts, he did not take him seriously.If not for the order from Mu Yutong, who Zheng Yuanlin had always worshiped, he would definitely not have lowered himself to personally look for Chu Nan.Moreover, even if his teacher had already given the order, he still could not help but test Chu Nan after seeing him.If Chu Nan\u2019s performance disappointed him, he would definitely report it to Mu Yutong and let him consider it.As the eldest disciple who had followed Mu Yutong for 37 years, he had the authority.However, as soon as he fought Chu Nan, Zheng Yuanlin was immediately shocked.From the recording, it could be seen that Chu Nan\u2019s attacks were extremely precise. However, only after fighting him did Zheng Yuanlin realize that his attacks could no longer be described as simple and precise.It was as if Chu Nan had the ability to predict the future. As long as Zheng Yuanlin moved, he would immediately react. Moreover, this reaction was definitely aimed at the flaw in his opponent\u2019s technique.With Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s extremely powerful martial technique, even if there was a flaw in his move, it was still an extremely small flaw. It was a problem for other martial artists to see through it, let alone someone like Chu Nan who accurately grasped that fleeting opportunity to attack.If not for the fact that the martial arts technique that Zheng Yuanlin practiced was much stronger than Chu Nan\u2019s and his cultivation was countless times stronger, he would have been suppressed from the beginning.Although Zheng Yuanlin had been suppressing Chu Nan until now, he did not feel proud at all.Up until now, Zheng Yuanlin had completely abandoned the last bit of contempt he had for Chu Nan. The martial techniques he used now were the strongest martial techniques passed down by Mu Yutong.His feet moved, and his body spun strangely.This was the Wind Returning Dance Willow Movement Technique, an A-rank martial technique.He took the opportunity to slap out with his palm. Although it seemed to be light and weak, it had already enveloped Chu Nan\u2019s entire body. His palm rumbled like thunder.This was an Eight Earth Palm Technique. It was also an A-rank martial technique.Seeing that Chu Nan had dodged, Zheng Yuanlin raised his left hand and gently pointed at him. A stream of air shot towards him.This was the Three Scorching Sun Finger Technique, an S-rank martial technique. If word got out, it would definitely make most martial artists go crazy!When he saw Chu Nan\u2019s body shrink and the force of his fingers brushed past his scalp, only breaking a few strands of his hair, Zheng Yuanlin suddenly smiled bitterly in his heart.As the Eldest Disciple of Mu Yutong, a super expert standing at the peak of the Imperial Heaven Realm, it was simply a humiliation for him to use so many powerful martial techniques to deal with a mere Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist.What was even more shameful was that after five minutes of fighting, he still could not do anything to Chu Nan.Although Chu Nan had always been suppressed by Zheng Yuanlin, he was hundreds of times more slippery than a loach. When faced with Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s exquisite moves, he could actually find the few flaws and even dodge them every time.Seeing that he had once again dodged his sure-kill move, Zheng Yuanlin sighed in his heart and lowered his hands to stop attacking.Chu Nan was continuously analyzing the various statistics of the battle in his mind in order to find Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s weakness. When he suddenly saw the other party stop, he could not help but be stunned for a moment before he reacted and relaxed.Chu Nan cupped his hands towards Zheng Yuanlin and said, \u201cThank you for your guidance, Senior Zheng.\u201d\u201cGuidance? I don\u2019t dare to teach anything.\u201d Zheng Yuanlin smiled bitterly.This was not flattery. He had actually fought with Chu Nan for a long time and had already determined that if he wanted to defeat Chu Nan, it was impossible for him to rely on ordinary moves unless he used some of the secret techniques from his master.However, it was very difficult to use these killer moves under the circumstances of restricting the strength of his internal breath. Moreover, this went against his original intention. Therefore, although Zheng Yuanlin was a little unwilling, he could only admit that Chu Nan\u2019s martial arts talent was too shocking and he really did not have anything to teach him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I still have something to say.\u201d Zheng Yuanlin waved his hand and went offline.Chu Nan raised his head to look at Dong Fang in the audience and saw the kid waving his fist at him excitedly.He smiled and also chose to log off.The three of them returned to their dormitory from the virtual network space. Zheng Yuanlin picked up the cup of tea on the table that had already turned cold and took a sip. He lowered his head and pondered for a moment before revealing a sincere smile to Chu Nan, \u201cLittle Brother Chu, do you know why I came to find you this time?\u201dSince he had already made up his mind, the way he addressed Chu Nan became closer.Chu Nan\u2019s heart stirred as he guessed something, but he still shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dZheng Yuanlin chuckled and put down his teacup before continuing, \u201cI\u2019ll be straightforward. I\u2019m here on Teacher\u2019s orders.\u201d Speaking up to this point, Zheng Yuanlin deliberately paused.\u201cSupremacy Mu Yutong\u2019s order?\u201d Dong Fang tactfully widened his eyes and spoke.Although Chu Nan was not as agitated as Dong Fang, his eyes still lit up as he looked at Zheng Yuanlin without blinking.Zheng Yuanlin was very satisfied with their reaction. He nodded lightly. After a pause, he suddenly let out a long sigh.Chu Nan and Dong Fang looked at each other in confusion.Why was Senior Zheng suddenly sighing?\u201cLittle Brother Chu, do you know that if you had appeared in front of me ten years ago, I might have called you junior brother now?\u201dChu Nan and Dong Fang were stunned.\u201cSenior Zheng, what do you mean by that?\u201d Dong Fang immediately asked without holding back.Zheng Yuanlin glanced at the frowning Chu Nan and slowly shook his head.\u201cIf we met ten years ago, with Little Brother Chu\u2019s astonishing martial arts talent, Teacher would definitely be tempted and take him in. After nurturing him, he would definitely be able to become a true expert in the future. Unfortunately\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s a pity?\u201d Dong Fang scratched his head in confusion. \u201cSenior Zheng, do you mean that the Supremacy can\u2019t take Chu Nan as his disciple now? I remember that the Supremacy mentioned before coming to West Cloud Planet that he wanted to take in a new disciple.\u201d\u201cHe does have the intention to take in a new disciple, but\u2026\u201d Zheng Yuanlin turned to look at Chu Nan, \u201cLittle Brother Chu, how old are you this year?\u201dChu Nan was stunned before he replied, \u201cI\u2019ll be 18 in two months.\u201dZheng Yuanlin nodded but did not say anything else. He only lowered his head and sipped his tea.Dong Fang immediately turned anxious.He originally thought that it was a great thing for the Eldest Disciple of Supremacy Mu Yutong to come looking for him personally. However, he did not expect Zheng Yuanlin to put on such a show. It was really confusing.Just as he was about to speak, Chu Nan patted his shoulder and stopped him.\u201cSenior Zheng, if I\u2019m not wrong, you mean that I\u2019m already old, so Supremacy Mu Yutong won\u2019t take me in as his disciple?\u201dZheng Yuanlin raised his head again and smiled.\u201cTrue experts need to be nurtured from a young age and build a good foundation. Little Brother Zheng, forgive me for being blunt, but you\u2019ve already missed the best opportunity. Otherwise, with your talent, you should at least be a high-level Internal Breath Martial Artist now.\u201dChu Nan was silent.Dong Fang frowned and said in slight anger, \u201cWho set the rule that experts must be nurtured from a young age? Not to mention the entire Milky Way, there are also many experts who became famous after growing up in our Earth\u2019s federation, right? I even remember that 200 years ago, there was a martial artist who was only at the Void Break Realm until he was 60 years old, but he broke through to become a Star-Grade Martial Artist at the age of 70. They can, but can\u2019t Chu Nan?\u201dZheng Yuanlin smiled. \u201cLittle Brother Chu, you have a very good friend.\u201dChu Nan smiled bitterly and stopped Dong Fang who wanted to speak again.\u201cSenior Zheng, I understand what you mean. But since Supremacy Mu Yutong doesn\u2019t plan to take me as his disciple, why did you come to find me?\u201dZheng Yuanlin was very satisfied with Chu Nan\u2019s reaction.At first, this kid was clearly just like this student called Dong Fang who was beside him and had extremely high expectations for his sudden arrival. However, he did not expect that he would expose the cruel reality later on.Under such a huge psychological difference, he immediately calmed down.In order to become a truly powerful martial artist, talent was important, but character was also important.If one was always anxious and lost their calm when encountering anything, how could they maintain their calm when facing true powerful enemies and dangerous situations?\u201cAlthough Teacher feels that you are already old and not suitable to be taken in as a disciple, he saw your performance twice and thinks that your martial arts talent is really rare. If you continue to stay in this small West Cloud Academy, it will be too wasteful.\u201dChu Nan and Dong Fang were both surprised.From what Zheng Yuanlin said, could it be that\u2026\u201cLittle Brother Chu, what do you know about Star Cloud Academy?\u201d\u201cStar Cloud Academy?\u201d Chu Nan and Dong Fang looked at each other. A thought flashed through their minds and they replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know much, but I heard that it\u2019s called the number one comprehensive academy in the federation. Its military branch is also known as the cradle of the federation\u2019s officers?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not wrong. However, to you, there\u2019s another more important thing. The Star Cloud Academy\u2019s martial arts branch has the best and most abundant external cultivation methods in the federation. Among them, there\u2019s also the only S-rank external cultivation method taught to outsiders by the federation\u2014Arhat Overlord Golden Body. If you have the chance to learn this cultivation method, your future will be limitless.\u201d\u201cThen, you mean to say that\u2026 Chu Nan will have the chance to learn this Arhat Overlord Golden Body?\u201d Dong Fang could not wait to ask.\u201cI can\u2019t guarantee that.\u201d Zheng Yuanlin shook his head. \u201cHowever, if you want to learn this cultivation method, you must first have the chance to come into contact with it. Little Brother Chu, are you willing to enter Star Cloud Academy to study?\u201dChu Nan was stunned, \u201cIs it that easy to enter Star Cloud Academy?\u201d\u201cTo ordinary people, it\u2019s naturally not easy to enter. However, if you have Teacher\u2019s special recommendation, it\u2019s much easier to enter,\u201d Zheng Yuanlin replied with a smile.Their eyes lit up.\u201cSenior Zheng, could it be that the Supremacy intends to give Chu Nan a special recommendation?\u201d Dong Fang asked.Zheng Yuanlin smiled and nodded.\u201cI\u2019m a person who cherishes talent. Seeing that Little Brother Chu\u2019s talent is rare, he wants to give you a chance. However\u2026\u201dAt this point, Zheng Yuanlin paused and his expression became serious.\u201cTeacher\u2019s special recommendation can\u2019t be given casually. Although Little Brother Chu\u2019s previous performance was not bad and made Teacher acknowledge your talent, this is still not enough.\u201dChu Nan immediately understood Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s intention and asked, \u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d\u201cIn a few days, it will be the martial arts competition of West Cloud Planet. As long as you can continue to perform well in the martial arts competition and obtain his true approval, there is a high chance that Teacher will give you a special recommendation. Do you understand what I mean?\u201dChu Nan smiled, \u201cSenior Zheng, can winning my category\u2019s championship count as outstanding?\u201dZheng Yuanlin was stunned before laughing loudly.\u201cAlright! Since Little Brother Chu is so confident, I look forward to your performance in the martial arts competition.\u201dAfter saying that, Zheng Yuanlin stood up and bade farewell to the two of them.After Zheng Yuanlin left, Dong Fang looked at Chu Nan worriedly.Although Zheng Yuanlin did not say it very bluntly just now, his meaning was very clear.Although Mu Yutong felt that Chu Nan\u2019s talent was not bad, he clearly felt that he was too old and it would be very difficult to nurture him into an especially powerful expert in the future. Therefore, he was unwilling to take him in as a disciple.This verdict from a powerful Star-Grade Martial Artist meant that it would be almost impossible for Chu Nan to grow into a true expert.To a martial artist, this was simply a death sentence.However, there was not much disappointment on Chu Nan\u2019s face. He looked at Dong Fang\u2019s worried gaze and smiled.\u201cWhat am I doing? I\u2019ve said it before. Even if I become a disciple of a Star-Grade Martial Artist, it might not be a good thing. Moreover, I\u2019m already very lucky to be able to obtain the chance to enter Star Cloud Academy, right?\u201dDong Fang shook his head and treated Chu Nan\u2019s words as consolation.How could Chu Nan not see through Dong Fang\u2019s thoughts? However, he could not be bothered to explain and only looked in the direction Zheng Yuanlin left in and clenched his fists.He naturally understood what Zheng Yuanlin meant by those words, but he did not agree.So what if he was a Star-Grade Martial Artist?He felt that Chu Nan could not do it, but was that necessarily true?With his powerful data ability, Chu Nan believed that as long as he had enough time and hard work, he would definitely walk his own path in the future and become a true expert that far exceeded Mu Yutong\u2019s expectations!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why were there so many people coming to watch?\u201cHey, Torriman, which one is Chu Nan?\u201d The third grade external martial arts teacher, Rayne, grabbed Torriman who had just walked in and asked while pointing at the stage.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Torriman glanced at him in surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s not just me. Look\u2026\u201d Rayne pointed at the stands.Torriman looked up and saw that there were a few senior college teachers waving at him in the stands. His eyebrows immediately jumped.\u201cWhat are you doing? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re all here to watch Chu Nan\u2019s competition.\u201d\u201cHaha, you\u2019re right. We\u2019ve all heard that there\u2019s a little guy called Chu Nan in your second year. He\u2019s clearly only an initial-stage Overlord Body, but he actually crippled the fifth-stage Overlord Body Luo Li in one move. This is really impressive. Everyone was very curious about who this little guy was, so they all came.\u201dAt this point, Rayne suddenly grabbed Torriman by the shoulder and pulled his head closer, lowering his voice.\u201cOthers might not know, but I heard that this guy called Chu Nan crippled Luo Li, so I\u2019m interested in him.\u201dTorriman looked at him speechlessly.Luo Li relied on Luo Yuntong\u2019s status in the West Cloud Academy and the Luo family\u2019s influence on the West Cloud Planet. He usually tyrannized the academy and often bullied his fellow students. Not to mention that he had long caused the majority of the students in the entire West Cloud Academy to be displeased, even teachers like them could not stand him.However, because of the relationship between Luo Yuntong and the Luo family, they could only close an eye and not do much.Of course, this did not stop them from having a poor impression of Luo Li in private. Now that they heard that Luo Li was actually crippled by an ordinary student who was previously unknown in such an important qualification competition, it was naturally very satisfying.\u201cRayne, let me remind you. If anyone else hears this and it ends up in the ears of the branch dean, you\u2019ll be in deep trouble.\u201d\u201cTsk, I don\u2019t want to stay in this lousy academy anymore. If Luo Yuntong really comes to find trouble with me, do you believe that I\u2019ll directly resign?\u201dAlthough Rayne spoke unyieldingly, his voice could not help but lower. Clearly, he still had some reservations.Torriman shook his head helplessly. He looked up at the other teachers and the students who were clearly seniors. He swept his gaze across the center of the venue and casually pointed.\u201cLook at that black-haired guy who is talking to a fatty, it\u2019s him.\u201dRayne looked in the direction Torriman pointed and immediately frowned.\u201cThat\u2019s not right. His body doesn\u2019t seem very strong. Perhaps he\u2019s a little stronger than an ordinary initial-stage Overlord Body, but he shouldn\u2019t be comparable to a fifth-stage Overlord Body. How did he cripple Luo Li?\u201dThe scene of Chu Nan and Luo Li\u2019s battle yesterday flashed through Torriman\u2019s mind. He suddenly felt a chill in his heart and could not help but clench his legs as his expression became extremely strange.\u201cThis\u2026 even if it\u2019s a fifth-stage Overlord Body, some key parts are still very fragile\u2026\u201d Torriman spoke vaguely.Rayne frowned and wanted to ask more, but he had already left his side and entered the center of the field.\u201cAlright, students, stop what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll announce the results of yesterday and today\u2019s arrangements.\u201dAfter the students retreated to make way for the center of the venue, Torriman announced the results of the first round of the competition yesterday.Apart from Chu Nan defeating Luo Li, there were no other unexpected results in the entire second grade.To these low-level students who were generally still at the Overlord Body Realm, a higher level meant that their bodies had been tempered even more. Be it strength, speed, flexibility, or even resistance to attacks, or even reaction speed, they were clearly much stronger.To martial artists at their level, unless they had a special family inheritance like Luo Li, the difference in martial techniques was minimal.Therefore, the outcome of the battle depended on whose physique was better. Naturally, it was very difficult to make an exception.As for someone like Chu Nan, it was almost impossible for a mere initial-stage Overlord Body to defeat a powerful fifth-stage Overlord like Luo Li.It was also because of this that Chu Nan\u2019s name quickly spread throughout West Cloud Academy, causing so many senior students and teachers to suddenly rush over to watch.\u201cNow, let\u2019s announce the situation of the second round.\u201dWith a wave of his hand, several names were arranged on the virtual screen above the arena, showing the situation of the second round of matches.Seeing this match schedule, the students did not have much of a reaction. After all, after drawing the lots yesterday, they had already confirmed the situation for the next match. Everyone was already mentally prepared.The only student whose face was especially pale looked at the form with an extremely conflicted expression.His opponent was Chu Nan.After looking at Chu Nan who was still quietly chatting with Dong Fang in the distance, he suddenly stood up and raised his hand.\u201cMr. Torriman\u2026\u201dTorriman and the other students looked at him.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Andre?\u201d Torriman asked.\u201cI\u2026\u201d The person called Andre was a student with the bloodline of Northern Europe. His originally white skin was now red. After a long time, he squeezed out a few words from his teeth,\u201d I\u2026 I forfeit\u2026\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dUpon hearing this, Torriman, the surrounding students, and even the audience were all stunned.\u201cForfeit?\u201d Torriman looked at him in surprise. \u201cAndre, do you know what you\u2019re doing? This is a selection competition that determines whether you can participate in the martial arts competition! If you forfeit, you\u2019ll lose your right to compete for this spot. Moreover, I\u2019m certain that since you\u2019ve taken the initiative to forfeit in the competition, the special recommendation spot of the academy will definitely not be given to you. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Andre put on a long face. Clearly, he was a little unwilling, but he still nodded forcefully, \u201cI also want to participate in the martial arts competition and even become the disciple of Supremacy Mu Yutong, but\u2026 but I still want to continue being a man\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dEveryone was stunned again.A moment later, the second-year students and Torriman, who had personally witnessed Chu Nan\u2019s battle with Luo Li yesterday, reacted and their expressions became extremely strange.Torriman and the male students could not help but tighten their legs. Their gazes swept across the gap between Andre\u2019s legs that had long shrunk together and they nodded secretly.Indeed, compared to the victory of a martial arts competition, protecting his life was obviously more important.As for the female students, their faces were slightly red, but they were secretly smiling. After their strange gazes swept past Mr. Torriman and the male students, they finally landed on the stunned Chu Nan and could not help but laugh together.\u201cVery good, Chu Nan. You\u2019ve completely become famous now.\u201d Dong Fang slapped Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder with an extremely serious expression. \u201cCongratulations, your future nickname will be \u2018Descendant Slayer\u2019!\u201dChu Nan opened his mouth and wanted to refute, but he was speechless.The reason why he was so ruthless yesterday\u2026 was completely because he had inherited the habit of bullying Luo Li in the virtual space.The reason why he had developed this habit was because he hated Luo Li greatly previously. Coupled with the fact that he did not have to worry too much in the virtual space, he was ruthless.Chu Nan did not regret it.With Luo Li\u2019s past actions, not to mention crushing his balls, even if he was kicked until he could not take care of himself, it would not be too much.Moreover, West Cloud Academy had a set of supplementary medical equipment bought from the Noctem Chamber of Commerce. As long as it was treated in time, it was not strange for Luo Li to recover completely.Honestly speaking, he felt that he had not been ruthless enough yesterday.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s best for you to restrain yourself\u2026\u201dBefore Chu Nan could answer, Dong Fang stood up.\u201cI disagree! Teacher Torriman, we saw the battle between Chu Nan and Luo Li yesterday with our own eyes. You said that Chu Nan was ruthless, but I feel that Luo Li is even more ruthless than him. In my opinion, Luo Li\u2019s move yesterday was clearly to take Chu Nan\u2019s life!\u201dEveryone recalled the situation when Luo Li and Chu Nan fought yesterday and their expressions changed.Dong Fang was right. Luo Li had put on a ferocious appearance yesterday.With his physical strength as a fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist and the famous Overlord Tiger Subduing Fist of the Luo family and even the entire Earth\u2019s Federation, if Chu Nan was struck by this punch, he would probably be heavily injured even if he did not die.In comparison, it was not a big deal for Chu Nan to kick his vital part, and it was a helpless action.Otherwise, with the toughness of Chu Nan\u2019s initial-stage Overlord Body, how could he be his match if he faced Luo Li head-on?Torriman frowned, knowing that he had said something inappropriate.He thought for a moment, coughed, and waved his hand.\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. It\u2019s just that\u2026 Chu Nan, it\u2019s fine for you to aim at other vital points, but it\u2019s best not to aim at\u2026 er\u2026 that important part. Do you understand what I mean?\u201dThe other male students immediately nodded.Chu Nan stood up, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. His gaze swept past the other male students and finally landed on the distant Andre. He shrugged and nodded, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll take note.\u201d\u201cVery good.\u201d Torriman nodded in satisfaction and turned to look at Andre, \u201cAndre, are you still going to forfeit?\u201dWhen he heard Chu Nan agree, Andre\u2019s expression immediately became excited again. He directly jumped onto the stage of the arena and his fists collided with each other, emitting a muffled bang. This displayed the super strength of a third-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist.\u201cCome, Chu Nan! Let\u2019s fight like men!\u201dChu Nan shook his head and jumped onto the stage.Torriman, who was still on the stage, opened his mouth. He wanted to tell them that the first match was not between the two of them, but after thinking for a moment, he gave up and directly announced the start of the competition.The audience who had specially come for Chu Nan on the stage were originally confused by the actions of Torriman and the second grade students. Now that they finally saw that Chu Nan\u2019s competition was about to begin, they put down the doubts in their hearts and focused on watching.However, after staring at Chu Nan for a while, they revealed disappointed expressions.Chu Nan and Andre had been fighting for a while.The two of them did not use weapons. Their fists collided and often collided directly.Although the muffled sounds were continuous and sounded very exciting, in the eyes of these senior students and teachers, it was undoubtedly still at an extremely low level.\u201cCould this Chu Nan only be at this level? If that\u2019s the case, how can he defeat Luo Li\u2019s fifth-stage Overlord Body?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Although that kid Luo Li has poor character, he is indeed a martial arts genius. He has already cultivated a fifth-stage Overlord Body and has even learned the Luo family\u2019s Overlord Tiger Subduing Fist. He can be considered extremely powerful among fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artists. Even many initial-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists are probably inferior to him. As for Chu Nan\u2019s current level\u2026\u201d\u201cActually, it\u2019s not bad. Look, I think this Chu Nan\u2019s body refinement is only slightly stronger than an initial-stage Overlord Body. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s barely a second-stage Overlord Body. However, pay attention to his movements. Every time he moves, he can practically mobilize the strength of his entire body, so he\u2019s not at a disadvantage when facing that kid with a third-stage Overlord Body.\u201d\u201cHmm, from the looks of it, he\u2019s indeed not bad. But this still doesn\u2019t make sense. How did he defeat Luo Li in one move?\u201d\u201cPerhaps that kid Luo Li underestimated his opponent too much and allowed him to succeed in his sneak attack\u2026\u201d\u201cHow is that possible? Luo Li has a fifth-stage Overlord Body. Even if he underestimated his opponent and stands there for Chu Nan to attack, he won\u2019t be able to deal with it in one move.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201dThe discussion of the other teachers beside him entered Rayne\u2019s ears, causing his frown to deepen.Unlike the teachers beside him, Rayne was a third-year teacher in the West Cloud Academy who was specially responsible for guiding external martial arts techniques. Therefore, although he was already an initial-stage Void Break expert, his research in external martial arts was still very profound.In the eyes of the other teachers, Chu Nan\u2019s actions could at most show that he could mobilize the strength in his body every time. However, when it entered his eyes, it revealed more information.If they only mobilized all their strength, any martial artist who had cultivated their external cultivation to a certain extent could do it.However, in Rayne\u2019s opinion, the current Chu Nan was far from this level.Not only did he mobilize his entire body\u2019s strength, but he could even unleash almost every ounce of force perfectly in every move.In the eyes of Rayne, an extremely outstanding Void Break Martial Artist, every action of Chu Nan was nearly perfect!However, this was not the most surprising thing. What shocked him the most was that Chu Nan\u2019s every action was extremely precise to a terrifying extent.No matter what move the third-stage Overlord Body realm student used, no matter where his fist came from, he could always adjust his posture at the first moment and face it perfectly before displaying his strongest strength.It was not difficult to achieve this once or twice in a battle, but to be able to do this every time, it could only prove that his understanding of external cultivation and martial techniques had already far surpassed his opponent, and it had even far surpassed martial artists of his level.But that was what confused Rayne the most.From his judgment, Chu Nan\u2019s cultivation of external martial arts had clearly reached an astonishing level. In that case, even if his body was inferior to his opponent, he could easily win this battle with his external martial arts that far surpassed his opponent.However, he just had to perfectly meet the other party\u2019s fist every time and face this third-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist who was clearly much stronger than him.This was not a smart move.\u201cIs this kid that stupid?\u201d Rayne looked at Chu Nan and was puzzled.Of course, Chu Nan was not that stupid.There was only one reason why he chose this unwise strategy, and that was to gather enough combat data.After sparring with that unknown senior last night, he realized that he could not casually mobilize his Internal Breath in the battle, but it was not impossible.What he needed to do now was to turn this into the norm so that he could maintain his internal breath in battle.To other martial artists, what was needed was a large amount of combat experience. To him, so-called combat experience was actually a large amount of combat-related data.Every time he collided with Andre\u2019s fists, he would obtain very detailed physical data when using this punch.Not only did this data include the fist speed, angle, and other obvious statistics, but it also included the hidden data related to the muscles in all parts of his body when he used this punch, as well as the details of the circulation of internal energy in his meridians.For example, he was unable to successfully utilize his Internal Breath in this punch, so his fist collided with Andre\u2019s, and it emitted a muffled bang. His figure shook, and he could not help but take a step back.Seeing that his fist had the upper hand, he immediately chased up and threw another punch.Chu Nan did not have the time to think carefully. He adjusted his body slightly and twisted his body. He stepped back and cupped his fists. He suddenly felt a trace of internal breath flowing out from his dantian and flowed into his right arm through his meridians before finally fusing with his right fist.Bang!This time, when their fists collided, a muffled sound that was several times stronger than before could be heard. Due to Chu Nan mobilizing his Internal Breath, the force of his punch, which was as high as 683.323003 kilograms, directly forced Andre to take a few steps back. In the end, he could not stop his retreat and fell to the ground.Seeing that Chu Nan was about to pursue him, Andre suddenly raised his hands.\u201cStop! I admit defeat!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dBe it the referee, Torriman, the second-year students below the stage, or the audience on the stage, they were all dumbfounded.Both sides had always seemed to be on par, but this time, Chu Nan had inexplicably gained a slight advantage. Why did this kid suddenly admit defeat?Only Chu Nan, who was on the stage, could not help but smile bitterly.Needless to say, like the senior last night, Andre thought that he was actually deliberately hiding his strength.However\u2026 he was not hiding his strength at all. It was simply because his strength was insufficient\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He lay on his back and looked at the ceiling with a depressed expression.Dong Fang glanced at him and was instantly amused.\u201cHey, Chu Nan, what\u2019s with your expression?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cHuh? You\u2019re still unhappy? What about those students who were eliminated by you? Wouldn\u2019t I be even more unhappy if I got eliminated in the second round?\u201dDue to the fact that more than half of the students had been eliminated in the first round yesterday, the progress of the qualification competition today was much faster, and it was getting faster and faster as time passed.In just one morning, he had already finished three rounds.Chu Nan obtained three consecutive wins without any suspense, but Dong Fang was eliminated by a classmate with similar strength in the second round.\u201cWhat right do you have to be unhappy?\u201d Chu Nan rolled his eyes at him, \u201cYou\u2019re not willing to focus on martial arts at all. Otherwise, with your talent and resources, you might even be an Internal Breath expert now. How can you not even deal with a third-stage Overlord Body? You deserve it!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m indeed not unhappy. In any case, I\u2019m not interested in martial arts.\u201d Dong Fang chuckled and was not angry at all. He lowered his head to look at Chu Nan\u2019s expression and asked,\u201d I\u2019m curious about you. Why are you unhappy?\u201d\u201cWhat I\u2019m unhappy about is that these three battles were too short, causing me to end before I could even satisfy my cravings. If only they could last a little longer\u2026\u201dChu Nan sighed and looked regretful.Although there were three consecutive battles in the morning, each battle only lasted for a few minutes, preventing him from collecting enough combat data. It was not helpful to him and made him very dissatisfied.\u201cDamn, kid, you\u2019re really posturing after benefiting.\u201d Dong Fang could not help but curse, \u201cYou beat up the other three and eliminated them. Now, you\u2019re complaining that the time they lasted was too short? Why didn\u2019t I see that you were such a freak in the past?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the freak.\u201dDong Fang frowned and thought for a moment before suddenly asking, \u201cRight, Chu Nan, speaking of which, is the Nine Revolutions Technique that powerful? You\u2019ve only broken through the third level, so how did you become so strong in an instant? That kid Luo Li might have underestimated his opponent, but the strongest of the three people you eliminated earlier has a fourth-grade Overlord Body. I think you won quite easily.\u201dChu Nan glanced at him and knew that if his sudden change in attitude fell into the eyes of others, they might think that he had been deliberately hiding his strength and had only revealed it recently. However, in the eyes of Dong Fang who was with him practically every day, it would appear suspicious.However, Dong Fang would not believe the changes in his body even if he said it out loud. It would only become more troublesome.Chu Nan thought for a moment before taking out the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist and throwing it to Dong Fang.\u201cIt\u2019s not only because of the Nine Revolutions Technique, but also because of this.\u201d\u201cHong Clan\u2019s Long Fist?\u201d Dong Fang flipped through it and frowned, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like a very powerful martial technique.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very useful to me. That\u2019s right!\u201d Chu Nan suddenly stood up with an excited expression. \u201cDong Fang, let\u2019s go play Martial Soul!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u2026Half an hour later, Chu Nan and Dong Fang appeared in the virtual arena of Martial Soul.\u201cHey, Chu Nan, what\u2019s wrong with you today? Why do you suddenly want to play Martial Soul again?\u201d Dong Fang still looked at Chu Nan in confusion.\u201cWhat do you mean by crazy? I didn\u2019t play before because I was always tortured after I came in. Of course, I felt that it was meaningless. But now, I\u2019m much stronger than before. Why can\u2019t I play?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 that makes sense.\u201d Dong Fang nodded. With a move of his finger, a virtual system menu appeared in front of him. \u201cIt\u2019s been more than a year since you last played. There are many changes to Martial Soul. I\u2019ll tell you about it first. You\u2026\u201dBefore Dong Fang could finish speaking, he discovered a flash of light beside him and Chu Nan\u2019s figure disappeared.\u201cDamn, this kid is too anxious!\u201dHowever, Chu Nan did not listen to his explanation and directly chose the system to match his opponent.The future of Chu Nan changed as he appeared on a wide platform.Looking around, there were no special decorations, and the vision looked very wide.This was the most ordinary and low-level combat platform in the Martial Soul. It was very suitable for Novice-level martial artists to spar.Chu Nan did not have any objections and only focused on the countdown.When it counted to 37 seconds, a light flashed across the platform and a figure appeared.\u201cHeh, such a skinny kid dares to come here? Don\u2019t cry and call me mom later!\u201d When the person opposite saw Chu Nan, he immediately laughed mockingly.Chu Nan could not help but grin.The scene before him could not help but remind him of the day when Luo Li appeared in the virtual space.At this thought, he suddenly had a question.The optical supercomputer in the logistics center of the academy that was responsible for assisting the students in logistics, physical examinations, and healing was said to have been bought from the Noctem Chamber of Commerce at a high price. The Martial Soul game he was playing now was also developed and maintained by the Noctem Chamber of Commerce. The matching access terminal was also produced by them.Was there a connection?The bearded opponent assigned by the system did not give Chu Nan much time to think. As soon as the countdown ended, he roared and rushed towards him.Chu Nan focused his gaze and laughed.This guy was burly and his footsteps were steady. At first glance, he looked like an expert, but now that he attacked, he was immediately exposed.From the speed and strength he displayed, he was clearly only a beginner martial artist who had barely reached the initial-stage Overlord Body realm. Not to mention comparing him to the current Chu Nan, he was probably much weaker than the previous him.Seeing that he had arrived in front of him, Chu Nan slightly tilted his body, raised his leg, and accurately kicked that person\u2019s lower body.Bang!After a loud bang, that person only had time to scream before turning into a ray of light and disappearing.\u201cCongratulations on winning this battle, Virgin 001. You obtained 1 point from this victory.\u201dThe female voice sounded and the corners of Chu Nan\u2019s mouth twitched.Last year, he was brought into Martial Soul by Dong Fang. At that time, it was his first time coming into contact with it, so he knew almost nothing about it. He even handed the registration to Dong Fang. He did not expect Dong Fang to directly give him such an ID. He had really been screwed badly.Of course, it was not impossible to change his ID.However, the ID was tied to the game access terminal. If he wanted to change the ID, he had to change the terminal. At the same time, he had to submit an application to the Noctem Chamber of Commerce. The procedures were extremely troublesome and required a large amount of money.Chu Nan did not have time or money, so he could only make do with it.After leaving this match, he did not stop and directly started the next random match.Perhaps because there were too many low-level martial artists like him, he only waited for less than five seconds before another opponent appeared.This time, his opponent was not much stronger than the burly man from before. Chu Nan only took a glance before kicking him again.Then, the battle began again.Another opponent of the same level.He was sent flying by Chu Nan\u2019s kick again.Again\u2026\u2026After defeating five opponents in a row, Chu Nan frowned and withdrew from the battle.\u201cHeh, Chu Nan, I thought you were too satisfied with beating up those rookies and were unwilling to come out.\u201d As soon as he appeared, Dong Can sent a message.Chu Nan looked around and discovered that Dong Fang was no longer at the initial entry point and had gone off to do something.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of abusing these rookies? Dong Fang, tell me how to get a higher ranking opponent?\u201d\u201cOh? Kid, you\u2019ve become stronger and more arrogant now. You want to find a higher-level opponent? It\u2019s simple, just increase your level. Otherwise, even if you take the initiative to challenge them, those experts will definitely not fancy you.\u201d\u201cSo simple?\u201d\u201cYou think it\u2019s easy? Let me tell you, if you want to increase your level, you have to win\u2026\u201dBefore Dong Fang could say anything, he realized that the system had already notified him that Chu Nan had entered the combat room again. He could not help but shake his head.\u201cI thought that this kid was not interested in martial arts like me. It turns out that it was only because he was too weak in the past\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In an extremely wide manor outside the city, a sharp scream suddenly sounded from a bedroom that was still lit.\u201cAhhhh\u2026\u201dElvy held her head with both hands, her face filled with disbelief and anger. She kept shouting as if something unbelievable and unacceptable had just happened.Of course, her voice was crisp and pleasant to the ear. Even if she shouted like this, it would only make people feel that it was a little noisy at most, but it would not be ear-piercing.After shouting for a while, Elvy seemed to feel that it was not enough. She scratched her head twice, but she accidentally pulled off a few strands of golden hair. It was so painful that the corners of her mouth twitched.However, this action made her even angrier. She simply stood up, turned around, and smashed her fists on the bed behind her.Bang!The bed frame made of high-intensity alloys creaked and groaned under her furious smash, as if it was about to collapse.Just as Elvy was about to punch again to vent her anger, her bedroom door was suddenly knocked open. A tall young man with golden hair who looked a little similar to her rushed in with a panicked expression.\u201cElvy, are you alright?\u201d The young man rushed to her side and grabbed her fists that were about to smash down. He observed her before gently exhaling and calming down, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What happened? Why are you so angry?\u201dIt was fine if he did not ask, but this question immediately reminded Elvy of what had happened.This time, she was no longer shouting angrily. Instead, she pursed her lips and actually cried.\u201cBrother\u2026 I\u2026 I failed\u2026\u201dThis young man was Elvy\u2019s biological brother, Dunleavy.Seeing two large drops of tears flow out of Elvy\u2019s eyes, Dunleavy immediately panicked. He hurriedly took a piece of tissue to help her wipe her tears and asked softly, \u201cFailed? What failed? It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. Even if we fail, we can try again. Didn\u2019t Father often teach us\u2026\u201d\u201cHow can it be so easy to start all over again?!\u201d Elvy stopped her tears and shouted angrily as she pointed at a large table by the bed. \u201cI obtained 29 consecutive victories with great difficulty and was about to obtain 30 consecutive victories, but I lost this last round!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Dunleavy glanced at the strange-looking Martial Soul game interface on the table and blinked as he understood the situation.It turned out that this precious sister of his had only lost her composure because of a certain winning streak in Martial Soul\u2026Looking at Elvy\u2019s aggrieved expression, Dunleavy could not help but find it funny.Elvy clearly did not like to practice martial arts since she was young, so she was about to turn 14 this year and had only cultivated to the initial-stage Overlord Body realm.Otherwise, with her talent and aptitude that had also inherited from her parents, coupled with the various resources and martial techniques that her family had grasped, even if she did not become an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, she should at the very least complete the body refinement and become a fifth-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist.In the end, ever since she was pulled into the Martial Soul game by her friends last year, she inexplicably began to develop a strong interest in cultivatting martial arts and began to cultivate seriously.However, because she had not built a good foundation since she was young, even with the full support of her family this year, she had only reached the perfection of the initial-stage Overlord Body realm and was only a step away from becoming a second-stage Overlord Body.Of course, being able to cultivate from having no foundation to the perfection of the initial-stage Overlord Body in slightly more than a year was already sufficient to prove that Elvy\u2019s martial arts talent was extremely high.\u201cAlright, it\u2019s said that this Martial Soul has already attracted many experts to enter. Not only are there Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists, but even Void Break Martial Artists are playing. It\u2019s very normal for you to lose to others,\u201d Dunleavy comforted with a smile.\u201cHmph! You don\u2019t know anything!\u201d Elvy did not appreciate his kindness. She pursed her lips and retorted, \u201cI chose the random challenge mode of the same level. The game system will only arrange for opponents of the same level as me. Otherwise, how do you think I obtained 29 consecutive wins?\u201d\u201cOpponent of the same level?\u201d Dunleavy was immediately stunned, \u201cYou mean the opponent is an initial-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist?\u201dSeeing Elvy nod, Dunleavy was puzzled.Although Elvy had only started to cultivate martial arts for a year, her talent was outstanding. Moreover, because she cultivated the \u201cGaia Holy Light\u201d cultivation method that her grandfather had personally taught her and was reputed to be one of the ten great internal cultivation methods of the federation, she had also grasped a few external martial arts techniques unique to her family. Although she could not be said to have become an expert, she was definitely the top existence among martial artists at the initial-stage Overlord Body realm.The only people who could defeat her at the same level could only be those young martial arts geniuses with special family inheritances in the Federation.Thinking of this, Dunleavy felt very curious.Which family in the federation was this martial arts genius, who suddenly appeared, from?\u201cElvy, what\u2019s the name of the guy who defeated you?\u201d Dunleavy asked after connecting his personal terminal to the game data that she had thrown to the side.\u201cIt\u2019s called\u2026\u201d Elvy suddenly blushed slightly and sneered,\u201d You\u2019ll know when you see my battle records. \u201dDeng Liwei was a little surprised by Elvy\u2019s reaction, but he did not think too much about it. He entered Martial Soul and chose the ID \u201cFree Flower Pistil\u201d on his friend list to read her combat records.Sure enough, most of the records of Elvy\u2019s battles were green in color representing victory. Only the top, which was also the most recent battle, turned into a blinding red color representing defeat.Dunleavy deliberately counted and discovered that before this failure, Elvy had indeed obtained a total of 29 consecutive wins.According to the official rules of Martial Soul, as long as one obtained 30 consecutive wins, they could complete an achievement. While obtaining a title, they could also obtain some practical rewards.Of course, Elvy did not care about these so-called rewards. What she valued more was the title of \u201c30 consecutive wins\u201d. This would make her appear especially proud in front of her companions.Dunleavy roughly flipped through the records of the previous battles and confirmed that Elvy\u2019s opponents were indeed all initial-stage Overlord Body or even Novice Realm opponents. There were no opponents at a higher realm than her.When he flipped to the top of the list, Dunleavy could not help but be stunned.It was no wonder she had that expression when she asked what the opponent who defeated her was called.This guy who had defeated Elvy and made her dream of 30 consecutive wins was actually called\u2026 \u201cVirgin 001\u2033\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, he shook his head with an unsatisfied expression.This was already the 30th opponent he had defeated in a row.However, Chu Nan did not feel happy.From the first to the 30th, the opponents were all at the Novice or initial-stage Overlord Body Realm. Not only were their foundations weak, some had not even grasped the most basic martial techniques.It could be said that other than the occasional one or two, all the other opponents were even inferior to Chu Nan, let alone pose any threat to him.Chu Nan\u2019s original goal of entering Martial Soul was to obtain enough opponents and engage in enough battles. From there, he could gather enough combat data to resolve the problem that had plagued him previously and truly control his Internal Breath as he pleased.However, these opponents were too weak now. Under his attacks that had perfectly fused with the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist, they could not withstand three moves and were defeated.After 30 consecutive battles, the combat data Chu Nan gathered was inferior to the battle with that unknown senior that night.Could it be that I should fight that senior again? This thought flashed through Chu Nan\u2019s mind before he bitterly smiled.That night, he fought with that senior for half an hour. When he finally bade farewell and left, he forgot to ask for his name!Although Chu Nan had some impression of that senior and knew that he should be quite famous among the higher-ups in the academy, it was probably useless to find him since he did not know his name.\u201cCongratulations on winning this battle, Virgin 001. You obtained 1 point from this victory.\u201d\u201cVirgin 001, congratulations on obtaining 30 consecutive victories.

There\u2019s also a reward?\u201dA few things appeared on the virtual system menu.The first reward was a special set of clothes in the Martial Soul game. After wearing it, one could appear different in the Martial Soul game.The official price of this special outfit was 4,888 federation coins.The second reward was also a set of supplementary items in the Martial Soul. It included fixed point teleportation cards, limited formation cards, and so on. Each had different effects.Chu Nan only glanced at these two rewards before his gaze landed on the last reward.The third reward was very simple and straightforward. It was 3,000 federation coins, nothing else.Chu Nan did not hesitate to choose the third reward.His economic situation had always been bad. With these 3,000 federation coins, it would at least make his life easier for two to three months.After Chu Nan chose the reward, less than a minute later, the notification of 3,000 federation coins entered his personal terminal.\u201cHa, I didn\u2019t expect to earn money from playing a game.\u201dLooking at the additional amount in his account, the depression Chu Nan felt because he had not met a strong opponent greatly decreased. He decided not to continue fighting at random and instead seriously read the game description.Soon, he confirmed his next target.A hundred consecutive wins!According to the rules of the game, so long as one was able to obtain a hundred consecutive wins, one would be able to obtain a reward of 10,000 federation coins!Looking at the enviable number on the reward list, Chu Nan did not hesitate to start another match.\u2026On Planet Macaw.\u201cBrother, is\u2026 is that guy still not out?\u201d Elvy frowned and asked with displeasure.Dunleavy smiled bitterly and shook his head.\u201cThis guy seems to have been fighting all this time. I don\u2019t even have the chance to speak to him.\u201d\u201cIdiot, can\u2019t you leave a message for him?\u201d\u201cI did, but I don\u2019t know if he didn\u2019t receive it or didn\u2019t notice. In any case, he never replied to me\u2026\u201d Dunleavy shrugged helplessly.After Elvy\u2019s 30-game winning streak was ended by that guy called Virgin 001, she was extremely angry.She knew that she was not a match for Virgin 001, so she simply asked Dunleavy to take revenge for her.However, the two of them had waited here for nearly half an hour and had yet to receive a reply from Virgin 001. Naturally, they could not directly challenge him.Moreover, as a third-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist, even if Dunleavy joined the match, it was impossible for him to be assigned by the system to an initial-stage Overlord Body Realm opponent like Virgin 001.Therefore, as long as Virgin 001 did not respond, they really could not do anything to him.\u201cHmph! This coward! He must have seen that you\u2019re an expert of the Internal Breath Realm, so he\u2019s afraid!\u201d Elvy waved her small fists in disdain, abnormally displeased with the fellow who had shown her an extremely wretched name.Dunleavy could not help but laugh.\u201cElvy, he didn\u2019t add me as a friend. He doesn\u2019t know my level at all.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care. In any case, he must be afraid!\u201d Elvy was clearly already very prejudiced against that Virgin, 001. She did not plan to reason at all.Dunleavy shook his head helplessly and turned around to focus on the game again. He looked puzzled.From the time that Virgin 001 defeated Elvy and ended her 30-game winning streak, 40-50 minutes had passed.During this period of time, other than occasionally stopping for a short while after the battle, this guy had always been in a state of battle.Dunleavy had been staring at his status for a while now, and he discovered that he was changing his status very often. Every time he switched out of the battle, after waiting for less than a minute, he would enter the battle state again.Clearly, he did not stop to rest at all. It was likely that as soon as the previous battle ended, he immediately started the system match again.However, what really surprised him was his combat time.Every time he entered the battle status, after about two to three minutes, he would leave the battle status again.Putting aside the minimum half a minute of preparation time needed for each battle and the ten seconds after the battle ended, each battle did not last more than two minutes.This time, Dunleavy found it unbelievable.Since this guy called Virgin 001 could defeat Elvy, his strength was clearly very outstanding among the initial-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artists. It was not strange for him to win consecutively.However, it was abnormal for him to be able to end the battle so quickly every time.No matter how powerful he was, he was only a mere initial-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist. There was a limit to how much stronger he was than his opponent.It was understandable that he could quickly defeat one or a few opponents of the same level, but from the moment Dunleavy noticed him, he had at least experienced more than 20 battles. It was difficult to understand why he ended so quickly every time.\u201cUnless he chooses to surrender every time he feels that he can\u2019t end the battle quickly, it\u2019s impossible for him to continue so quickly.\u201d Deng Liwei frowned in thought, \u201cBut what\u2019s the point of doing this? There\u2019s neither a winning streak reward nor any value in training himself.\u201dDunleavy only felt that he could not figure it out no matter what. He thought for a moment and decided to give up on paying attention for the time being. He turned around and said to Elvy, \u201cThis guy seems to be a martial arts fanatic. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t have the chance to find him to spar today. It\u2019s already getting late. Go sleep first. If there\u2019s a chance in the future, I\u2019ll help you teach him a lesson, alright?\u201dElvy pouted, looking very dissatisfied. However, she was not a spoiled and willful child after all. Seeing that the night was already very dark outside, she nodded helplessly.\u201cAlright. But Big Brother, if I capture him, you must rush over immediately to teach him a lesson.\u201d\u201cAlright, how can I not do my best at our cute Elvy\u2019s request?\u201dDunleavy smiled at Elvy and was about to turn around and leave when he suddenly saw her looking behind him in shock.He turned around in confusion, then froze.On the huge virtual screen connected to the game terminal of Martial Soul, a row of conspicuous words representing the system announcement appeared.\u201cCongratulations, Virgin 001, for obtaining the achievement of winning a hundred consecutive battles through random matches at the initial-stage Overlord Body Realm!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosChu Nan opened his eyes and saw Dong Fang\u2019s fat face close by.He was shocked and hurriedly dodged to the side. He reached out and pushed Dong Fang away with all his might.\u201cDamn, fatty, why are you so close? I told you I was a normal man!\u201dDong Fang chuckled. \u201cHehe, I\u2019m just very curious. What kind of dirty dream are you having, kid? You\u2019re laughing so hard. Tell me, which girl in the school are you dreaming about? Or are you such a beast that you won\u2019t let go of Luo Lan and Rose, who you\u2019ve only met once?\u201d\u201cGet lost, I\u2019m not dreaming.\u201d Chu Nan kicked the air and forced Dong Fang to retreat before jumping up from the bed.After stretching his body, he still felt a little tired.Although the Martial Soul only produced a virtual person based on the specific data obtained from the scan and would not expend his physical strength when fighting inside, his mind still needed to be exhausted.In order to obtain a hundred consecutive wins as soon as possible yesterday, Chu Nan did not rest at all and fought continuously.Even if each match could be considered a crushing victory, after accumulating a hundred rounds, he still felt extremely exhausted. As a result, after obtaining a hundred consecutive wins in the end, he did not even look at the specific system information. He did not even have the time to receive the reward before he directly exited the game and fell asleep.Otherwise, he would not have been woken up by Dong Fang moving so close.\u201cAlright, no matter what dream you have, wake up now. It\u2019s about time. Today is the last two rounds of the qualifiers. You should still fight seriously and not fail miserably. If you can\u2019t even pass the qualifiers of the academy and can\u2019t participate in the martial artist competition, then you\u2019ll miss out on a great opportunity.\u201dChu Nan nodded and turned to look out the window. He discovered that the sky was indeed bright outside, so he did not waste any time and left the dormitory with Dong Fang.Halfway through, Chu Nan suddenly asked a question.\u201cRight, Dong Fang, you told me before that Martial Soul is a game produced by the Noctem Chamber of Commerce, right?\u201d\u201cYeah, why?\u201d\u201cThen why didn\u2019t I see anyone from the Earth Federation in the game yesterday?\u201d\u201cWhat? You think this game is fun now?\u201d Dong Fang asked with a chuckle.Chu Nan pondered for a moment and shook his head.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t treat this as an ordinary game because the battles inside are almost identical to those in reality. It can allow me to obtain a lot of precious combat experience. Speaking of which, the technology of the Noctem Chamber of Commerce is really impressive. Just by using a data access terminal, we can let the martial artists fight in the virtual environment.\u201d\u201cNonsense. The Noctem Commerce Alliance is a colossus that can contend with a large country like the Declan Empire. How can it not be powerful? So? You\u2019re completely using this game as a training ground? However, this is not wrong. Most of the martial artists who entered this game think so. As for your question just now\u2026\u201dDong Fang\u2019s expression changed as he seriously glanced at Chu Nan and asked, \u201cYou seem to have played late last night. How many points have you gained?\u201d\u201c100 points\u2026\u201d When he spoke of this, Chu Nan had a helpless expression, \u201cI can only participate in a match between initial-stage Overlord Bodies. Even if I win once, I\u2019ll only get 1 point.\u201d\u201c100 points? Then you should have leveled up by now. Listen carefully, you only met our Earth Federation\u2019s opponent yesterday because you\u2019re only a rookie now and can only play in the Earth Federation\u2019s server.\u201d\u201cIn that case\u2026 I still have a chance to fight the martial artists of other countries?\u201d\u201cOf course. As long as you reach level ten, you\u2019ll be qualified to enter the Orion\u2019s Revolving Arm Server\u2019s division and can fight with the martial artists of other countries on the Orion\u2019s Revolving Arm. It\u2019s said that\u2026 in this server\u2019s division, even the young experts of the Declan Empire will appear.\u201d\u201cOrion\u2019s Revolving Arm Server?\u201dChu Nan swept through the introduction of the Orion\u2019s Revolving Arm in his mind and felt a trace of excitement.Not to mention that the Earth Federation was only a small place in the entire Milky Way, even in the Orion Arm, one of the three great spiral arms of the Milky Way, it was only a remote small place that most people had no impression of. No matter how prosperous martial arts was, because they had only joined the Milky Way for a short period of time, they were unable to compare to those old kingdoms.Outside the Earth Federation, there were countless countries with their own specialties and countless martial artists and martial arts techniques.When he thought of the possibility of competing with the young experts from all over the galaxy through the Martial Soul game, Chu Nan felt extremely excited.When the two of them arrived at the third combat arena together, they discovered that it was especially lively today.Logically speaking, only the last two rounds of the qualifiers were needed today. There were only 13 participants left, including Chu Nan. Why was it so lively here?\u201cHeh, Chu Nan, it seems that you\u2019ve really become famous.\u201d Dong Fang patted Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder and encouraged him before walking towards the spectator stand.He had been eliminated in the second round long ago. Today, he was purely here as an audience.Just like him, there were many second-year students who had been eliminated on the spectator stand. They had also come for their friends.However, in comparison, most of the audience came from the other students and teachers of the academy.Chu Nan was still surprised when he saw the audience yesterday, but he was used to it today.He ignored the different gazes that were staring at him and directly found Torriman to sign his attendance.\u201cThat\u2026 Chu Nan\u2026 I have something to inform you\u2026\u201dAfter Chu Nan signed it, Torriman suddenly stopped him.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Chu Nan looked at him in surprise, but he could not help but feel strange when he saw Torriman\u2019s troubled expression.\u201cIt\u2019s like this\u2026 A transfer student came to the academy yesterday. He\u2019s also in his second year, so he wants to participate in this qualification competition\u2026\u201dChu Nan frowned.It was not strange for a transfer student to be transferred here, but it was strange for him to suddenly transfer here yesterday.Moreover, this qualification competition should have started two days ago, but this transfer student had only been transferred here yesterday. How was he qualified to participate?\u201cCough\u2026 This is a spot specially approved by the dean and the branch dean. Of course, he is indeed a rather powerful student. Even if he participated in the qualifiers two days ago, I believe he can still enter the final stage of the competition today\u2026\u201dTorriman spoke in an unclear manner, causing Chu Nan to become even more suspicious.Since this student who had suddenly transferred over was qualified to get the academy\u2019s dean and the branch dean to give him special permission at the same time, then he could completely get the academy to give him one of the remaining three special recommendation spots. Why did he have to come over and participate in the second grade\u2019s qualification competition?Could it be that they were afraid that people would criticize them if they directly gave a recommendation spot?What a joke!What made Chu Nan even more puzzled was why Torriman specially told him about this.\u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019m just informing you in case you feel surprised when you find out later. Alright, since you know, go make your preparations.\u201d Torriman waved his hand and gestured for Chu Nan to leave.Chu Nan walked to the side in bewilderment and thought for a moment. His gaze swept past the students who were preparing for the competition and landed on a young male student who was not tall but had a very sturdy body. He stood there like a calf.He had never seen this male student before, but now that he was here, he was probably the transfer student that Torriman had mentioned.As if sensing Chu Nan\u2019s gaze, the male student turned around and grinned when he saw him. His expression revealed a trace of undisguised disdain.Chu Nan was even more puzzled.This was the first time they had met, so why did he look like he was targeting him?After thinking for a while, he still could not figure it out, so he gave up on thinking about it.In any case, this was arranged by powerful figures like the dean. As an ordinary student, he had no right to doubt it.Moreover, with his current strength, he did not care if another person suddenly appeared.Because today was the final competition, according to the rules set previously, there would be another round of drawing lots.The virtual screen in the arena flickered under everyone\u2019s gaze. After the fourteen names, including Chu Nan, rolled for more than ten seconds, they slowly stopped.In the end, the match sequences were decided. Chu Nan\u2019s gaze landed on his name and discovered that it was matched with an unfamiliar name\u2014Lu Mingcheng.Chu Nan immediately turned to look at the male student who should be the transfer student. As expected, he happened to look over.Their gazes collided and Chu Nan was not surprised to see a pair of hostile eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Knock! Knock!Soft knocks sounded on the door.Mu Yutong did not even look up, \u201cCome in, Yuanlin.\u201dThe door was pushed open. Zheng Yuanlin slowly walked over and handed Mu Yutong a document.After Mu Yutong received it, he said in a low voice, \u201cTeacher, Luo Guangfu has already arrived. He\u2019s waiting in the hotel hall.\u201d\u201cOh, let him wait a while. I\u2019ll let him come up after reading this information,\u201d Mu Yutong casually replied.Zheng Yuanlin hesitated for a moment and wanted to say something but hesitated.\u201cJust say what you want to say. There\u2019s no need to hide anything in front of me.\u201d Although Mu Yutong did not look up, it was as if he had eyes on his head and saw Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s expression.\u201cYes, Teacher,\u201d Zheng Yuanlin hurriedly replied. \u201cThere\u2019s also another small matter that\u2019s related to Chu Nan\u2026\u201dMu Yutong listened patiently and was silent for a moment. He shook his head and smiled, \u201cJust treat it as a test for him. It\u2019s fine.\u201dSeeing that Mu Yutong did not seem to mind, Zheng Yuanlin felt a little strange.\u201cTeacher, if this is true, I\u2019m worried that Chu Nan might not even be qualified to participate in the martial arts competition. Then, wouldn\u2019t your inspection of him\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a special guest of this competition. I can recommend an additional participant.\u201d Mu Yutong interrupted Zheng Yuanlin, \u201cWhat you need to pay attention to is his actual performance. Do you understand what I mean?\u201dZheng Yuanlin immediately understood and nodded.Mu Yutong lowered his head and flipped through it for a while before finally reading the document in his hand.\u201cI thought that the Luo family was planning to refuse to comply until death this time. I didn\u2019t expect them to be so good at taking advantage of the situation. I don\u2019t have a good reason to attack them now.\u201dZheng Yuanlin smiled and said, \u201cThese families have been able to survive for so long, so they more or less know some ways to survive. Teacher, you came representing the federation this time. Even if they don\u2019t care about the federation, they will still be wary towards you. How can they dare to persist until the end?\u201dMu Yutong smiled slightly and accepted Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s small flattery.After his fingers knocked on his leg for a while, Mu Yutong suddenly said in a low voice, \u201cYuanlin, do you know that our Mu family has already been called the next great family by many people on the North Gazing Planet?\u201dZheng Yuanlin was shocked in his mind. He frowned and pondered for a moment before answering hesitantly, \u201cTeacher, the reason why these noble families of the federation are hated by the ordinary citizens of the federation, and even seen as targets that must be eliminated by the federation, is because they control a large amount of resources but are unwilling to share them. It\u2019s harmful to the development of the federation. Ever since you became a Star-Grade Martial Artist, you\u2019ve always been working hard for the flourishing development of the federation\u2019s martial arts and have made outstanding contributions to the federation. How can you compare yourself to these rotten noble families?\u201d\u201cI might be fine now, but who can guarantee that our Mu family can still maintain this principle after I die?\u201dMu Yutong sighed as if he felt that this topic was boring. He shook his head, stood up, and walked out with large strides.\u201cCall Luo Guangfu up. I\u2019ll wait for him in the guest room.\u201d\u2026The final stage of the West Cloud Academy\u2019s second grade martial arts competition was carried out calmly.The third match had just ended. The outcome was not too out of the audience\u2019s expectations and ended with the victory of a fourth-stage Overlord Body Realm student.There were no accidents in the first three rounds. The winners were all students who were usually quite famous in the second grade.In fact, this was the norm for this qualification competition.After all, the second grade students had already studied in the West Cloud Academy for nearly two years. It could be said that they knew each other well and would often exchange pointers. Naturally, the vast majority of the results would not be unexpected.The only exception was Chu Nan.When he walked up the stage and prepared for the fourth match, the gazes of all the second-year students, including the audience, were focused on him.If it was said that Chu Nan defeating Luo Li in the first match would make many people think that he had underestimated his opponent and caused him to lose his combat strength after kicking the most fragile part, then in the next three consecutive matches, everyone would admit that Chu Nan\u2019s current strength was vastly different from before.In these three rounds, Chu Nan\u2019s opponents were a second-stage Overlord Body Academy and two third-stage Overlord Body students.Although it had taken Chu Nan a long time to defeat them and it was not as easy as defeating Luo Li, it further proved his current strength.Since he could use normal methods to defeat these three students in a normal battle, his current strength should at least be at the third-stage Overlord Body realm.What made the other students sigh in surprise was that according to the situation revealed by Teacher Torriman, although the degree of tempering of Chu Nan\u2019s body was slightly stronger than before, it was still only at the initial-stage Overlord Body realm and had even reached the standard of a second-stage Overlord Body.He had tempered his body with the initial-stage Overlord Body realm flesh body, but he could defeat opponents at the second-stage Overlord Body realm or even the third-stage Overlord Body realm in succession. It could be seen how powerful his current external martial techniques were.At this moment, the students came to a realization.When Chu Nan defeated Luo Li, there was indeed the reason why the latter had underestimated his opponent. However, if not for Chu Nan\u2019s powerful external martial arts technique, it was impossible for him to accurately aim at Luo Li\u2019s weakness and kick his vital points.Therefore, the way the other students looked at Chu Nan was completely different from before.In the past, it was very difficult for Chu Nan to even beat an initial-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist. He was one of the last few among the entire second grade, so he naturally would not attract anyone\u2019s attention.Now, with just a few matches, he had already become the most hyped person in the entire second grade.However, compared to Chu Nan, his opponent received quite a bit of attention.According to Teacher Torriman\u2019s introduction, this guy had actually suddenly transferred over yesterday. Moreover, he had obtained the special approval of the dean and the branch dean as soon as he arrived and was allowed to participate in the second grade\u2019s qualification competition.This kind of newbie was easily ostracized, not to mention that he had used such a method to forcefully cut the line. Naturally, it caused the second grade students to be extremely displeased in their hearts, and it caused everyone to look at him with slightly hostile gazes.However, this guy called Lu Mingcheng had a very good mentality. After walking up the stage, he directly ignored the gazes of the audience and only stared at Chu Nan before laughing.\u201cHeh, your name is Chu Nan, right? I heard you defeated a fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist the day before?\u201dChu Nan inexplicably glanced at him, but he still could not understand where his hostility came from.\u201cYes, why?\u201d\u201cNothing much. I only want to remind you not to think that you\u2019re invincible just because you defeated a mere fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist. Let me tell you, there are many martial artists stronger than you in this world!\u201d Lu Mingcheng glanced at Chu Nan with an arrogant expression.Chu Nan immediately laughed, \u201cAren\u2019t you talking nonsense? There are still Internal Breath, Void Break, Heaven Control, and even Star-Rank above the Overlord Body Realm. There are countless martial artists stronger than me. Do I need you to remind me?\u201d\u201cHmph, since you know that there are still Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists above the Overlord Body Realm, do you think you can win against an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist?\u201dAfter asking this question, Lu Mingcheng raised his right foot and took a step forward.As his right foot landed, a strange pale green aura suddenly flashed across his body and instantly condensed on his right foot.Boom!With this stomp, an abnormally muffled bang sounded. A few rocks actually flew out from the sturdy martial arts stage of the third arena.Everyone focused their gazes over and noticed that spider web-like cracks had actually appeared on the ground where Lu Mingcheng\u2019s right foot stepped on.They looked at him in shock, their eyes filled with surprise.His Internal Breath moved as he pleased, mobilizing freely around him.This Lu Mingcheng was actually an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosChu Nan was slightly surprised before calming down.To other Overlord Body Martial Artists like him, an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist could be said to be an insurmountable peak. However, he had personally defeated at least a hundred Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists in the virtual space, so he was not afraid at all.Of course, this did not mean that he would underestimate Lu Mingcheng.Although he had defeated more than a hundred Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists and ferocious beasts of the same level in the virtual space, he knew very well that being able to do this in the virtual space did not mean that he could definitely do it in the real world.When he defeated those Internal Breath Martial Artists in the virtual space, other than relying on his powerful data ability, he had faced enemies of this level several times or even dozens of times before barely winning with his abundant experience.In virtual space, one could revive and fight again, but in the real world, there was only one chance.Chu Nan took a deep breath and threw away the question of why this guy was an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist in his mind. He focused his gaze on Lu Mingcheng.He did not have a chance to redo this battle, but he could not lose!Torriman, who was in charge of refereeing, glanced at Chu Nan worriedly but did not say anything. When he saw that the time was up, he counted down and announced the start of the competition.Chu Nan moved his feet away and his body sank. As he circulated the Nine Revolutions Technique, the Internal Breath in his body slowly circulated.He knew very well that although he had the support of a powerful data ability and had also obtained a major breakthrough in the Nine Revolutions Technique, body refinement was not something that could be done in a day. Although his current strength had greatly increased compared to before, it had not reached the extent of going head-on against an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist.If he wanted to win this competition, he had to fully display his advantage, just like in a virtual space. After obtaining enough data and understanding the characteristics of his opponent, he could then seek an opportunity to win.\u201cHeh, are you ready?\u201d When he saw Chu Nan putting on a serious stance, Lu Mingcheng was not in a hurry to attack. He chuckled and raised his head with a disdainful expression.Chu Nan had experienced tens of thousands of battles in the virtual space and had long tempered his mind to be abnormally firm. How could he be easily provoked by him? After hearing this, he still remained motionless and stared at Lu Mingcheng.\u201cChu Nan, you can do it!\u201dA shout suddenly sounded from below the stage.Chu Nan was slightly stunned. He turned around and discovered that the person who shouted was not Dong Fang, but a classmate he was completely unfamiliar with.The classmate stood up. He waved his arms and shouted with all his might, looking very excited.\u201cChu Nan, you can do it!\u201dThe other student beside him also stood up and cheered for Chu Nan.No matter how low Chu Nan\u2019s presence was usually, he was still a second-year student of West Cloud Academy.Lu Mingcheng was a transfer student who had been transferred over yesterday. Now, he was even using the back door method that the students hated the most to forcefully enter the competition. Naturally, it caused the second grade students to be displeased.These two students were usually generous and outgoing. Now, they directly displayed this displeasure.Just as Chu Nan was about to smile at them, he suddenly heard a wind sound and rushed towards him.\u201cHey, where are you looking?\u201dAccompanied by a muffled groan, a strong wind attacked.Chu Nan kicked his right foot and his body spun around, avoiding Lu Mingcheng\u2019s kick. He took the opportunity to punch out. It was the second stance and third move of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u2014Shooting Horse Stab Fist. It was aimed at Lu Mingcheng\u2019s lower right ribs.When he heard Chu Nan\u2019s punch, an explosion sounded beside his ear. Lu Mingcheng was shocked and a faint green aura flashed past. His Internal Breath instantly circulated throughout his entire body as he took two steps back and raised his right arm to block in front of him.Bang!Chu Nan\u2019s punch landed firmly on Lu Mingcheng\u2019s right arm, emitting a muffled sound.Lu Mingcheng did not move, but his right arm shook twice. However, Chu Nan\u2019s entire body shook and he took two steps back.He could not mobilize his Internal Breath in this punch. Although the strength on his fist was already as high as 378.342098 kilograms, the Internal Breath circulating on Lu Mingcheng\u2019s arm was not weak, and it made him suffer a little.Without the help of the Internal Breath, this was the insurmountable gap between an Overlord Body Martial Artist and an Internal Breath Martial Artist.Chu Nan clenched his fists. He knew that with his current strength, it was impossible for him to face Lu Mingcheng head-on.Under normal circumstances, he would be very happy to be able to spar with an Internal Breath Martial Artist like he did with that senior that night and test how to mobilize his Internal Breath in battle. However, the situation was different now, and he could not do this.Seeing Lu Mingcheng\u2019s figure move and another punch, Chu Nan cleverly took a step back and easily avoided this punch.The tens of thousands of battles in the virtual space had allowed Chu Nan to accumulate extremely powerful combat experience. Moreover, an even stronger data ability could allow him to easily obtain all the detailed data of the enemy\u2019s movements and make the most accurate judgment.As long as he did not want to fight head-on, Lu Mingcheng practically could not do anything to him.On the contrary, when Chu Nan occasionally saw the flaw that Lu Mingcheng revealed and counterattacked, he would force Lu Mingcheng to retreat and save him. Sometimes, he would even appear abnormally miserable because he was too anxious.The audience below the stage were stunned.Before the competition began, everyone felt that it was impossible for Chu Nan to be Lu Mingcheng\u2019s match. After all, even if he defeated Luo Li, a fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist, he would still be unable to cross the gap between an Overlord Body and an Internal Breath Martial Artist. There was no possibility of him winning.However, nearly ten minutes had passed since the start of the competition. The two of them had been fighting for so long, but Lu Mingcheng had not even touched Chu Nan a few times, let alone defeat him.It seemed like Chu Nan was forced to retreat step by step by Lu Mingcheng. It was as if he could only defend and retreat, and he did not even have the strength to parry. However, his footsteps were still stable, and his breathing had only become heavier. There was no sign of disorder. Moreover, as long as he casually counterattacked, Lu Mingcheng would be forced to change his moves.On the other hand, because Lu Mingcheng could not win after a long time, it was difficult for him to even touch Chu Nan. He appeared to be a little anxious and his breathing became heavier.Although he could still obtain an absolute advantage with the powerful strength of an Internal Breath Martial Artist, he was still far from defeating Chu Nan and obtaining victory.\u201cDid you guys notice that Chu Nan\u2019s every action is almost perfect? It\u2019s as if he had calculated it long ago.\u201d In the audience, a senior student who came to watch the battle suddenly said.This sentence immediately attracted a round of agreement.Indeed, since the start of the battle, everyone\u2019s attention had been on Chu Nan. They discovered that although he had been avoiding the attacks, every step and movement seemed to have been calculated accurately. He did not waste any effort but could always dodge Lu Mingcheng\u2019s attacks.This was why he could still maintain his lasting stamina after fighting until now, able to continuously tangle with Lu Mingcheng, an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist.\u201cHeh, how can it be that simple?\u201d When the third-grade external martial arts teacher, Rayne, who was also in the audience today, heard this, he sneered with disdain, \u201cThese guys can\u2019t see how shocking Chu Nan is.\u201dAmong the audience, Rayne was definitely the first in terms of martial arts techniques.His knowledge was naturally not what other students or even ordinary teachers could compare to.When he came to watch Chu Nan\u2019s competition yesterday, he had only seen a hint of what he was capable of.Today, when he watched this competition, he confirmed his guess.This second-year student called Chu Nan was not only talented in movement techniques and accurate strength.This fellow was like a precise machine. He was able to precisely control every inch of his muscles, every inch of his bones, and he was always able to make the most suitable movements at the most suitable time.Because of this trait, he could still act skillfully and easily when facing an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist like Lu Mingcheng who should be far stronger than him.Rayne could not explain why Chu Nan could do this because even he could not do it himself.This could only be called talent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In his eyes, he was no different from those Novice Martial Artists.He would usually deal with such an opponent in a few punches.However, after fighting Chu Nan for so long, this kid was like a slippery loach that he could not even touch a few times.Although his true strength was far stronger than Chu Nan, how could he unleash his strength when he could not even touch it?\u201cKid, if you have the ability, don\u2019t dodge! As a martial artist, don\u2019t you feel ashamed?\u201d Seeing that Chu Nan had once again seemingly narrowly dodged his punch, Lu Mingcheng could not help but shout angrily.Chu Nan retreated. Seeing that Lu Mingcheng did not continue to pursue him and instead stopped, he breathed heavily and stopped. He took a deep breath and calmed his heavy breathing before laughing.\u201cYou mean to make me stand here and fight you? Are you serious? I\u2019m an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist, and you\u2019re an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist. You want me to fight you head-on? Are you stupid or am I stupid?\u201dThe audience below the stage immediately laughed.\u201cThat\u2019s right. You, an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, ran over to fight an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist. You\u2019re bullying the weak. Isn\u2019t it shameful?\u201d\u201cHa, I\u2019m dying of laughter. I\u2019ve never seen anyone say that they have to stand on the spot to fight during a martial arts competition. Are these still martial artists? They\u2019re clearly two wild bulls, right?\u201d\u201cHey, don\u2019t insult the wild bulls, okay? At the very least, they know how to walk around in circles and use their strongest horns to block people. Have you ever seen two wild bulls fight and directly push each other around?\u201d\u201cThis guy is also an Internal Breath realm Martial Artist? Tsk, I thought that an Internal Breath realm Martial Artist was very powerful. After all this, he\u2019s only this stupid\u2026\u201d\u2026Lu Mingcheng\u2019s sudden interruption made almost all the second grade students dissatisfied. Previously, only two people had spoken, but now that they saw that he could not defeat Chu Nan after so long, they felt even more disdain towards him. Therefore, the group of students directly mocked him.On the stage, Lu Mingcheng\u2019s face alternated between green and white. It had been a long time since he defeated Chu Nan and it had already made him feel ashamed. Now that he was mocked by the students below the stage, he was even more embarrassed and furious. He grunted and kicked without any hesitation.However, to his surprise, Chu Nan did not dodge this time. Instead, he took a step forward and punched out.\u201cHa, this kid still can\u2019t stand my provocation.\u201dSeeing that Chu Nan no longer dodged, Lu Mingcheng was immediately overjoyed. The Internal Breath in his body circulated and an obvious light green aura was attached to his leg.After being kicked, even if he did not die, he would be heavily injured!However, in the next moment, Lu Mingcheng suddenly discovered that the position Chu Nan took was extremely ingenious. The speed and angle of his punch were also abnormally exquisite. If the current situation did not change, then before his kick landed on Chu Nan, the punch would accurately hit the dantian of his lower abdomen.Every martial artist knew that the dantian was the foundation of everything. If this place was firmly struck by Chu Nan\u2019s punch, then Lu Mingcheng\u2019s dantian\u2019s Internal Breath would definitely be greatly affected, causing his Internal Breath to be in chaos. Even if this kick landed on Chu Nan, it would be powerless and pose no threat.Lu Mingcheng was also a martial artist with rich combat experience. When he saw that the situation was bad, he immediately changed his move. The right leg that he kicked out shrunk back and bent slightly, protecting his abdomen. His body still leaned forward, but he changed his move to a knee strike.Although this strike had weakened due to the sudden change in move, the knee was the hardest part of the lower body. Coupled with his Internal Breath, once it struck Chu Nan, the lethality would be greater than the previous kick.However, just as Lu Mingcheng changed his move, Chu Nan acted as if he had foreseen this. The moment he retracted his leg, he leaned back and allowed Lu Mingcheng\u2019s knee to brush past his nose.This scene looked extremely dangerous. In fact, the wind brought about by Lu Mingcheng\u2019s knee even caused the hair on Chu Nan\u2019s forehead to flutter. However, because he did not touch it, he was still unable to cause any damage.On the contrary, after Chu Nan avoided this strike, his right fist did not change. However, because his body was leaning back, he took the opportunity to change his angle and curl up, hitting the inside of Lu Mingcheng\u2019s right calf.Bang!Although he had Internal Breath protection, Lu Mingcheng had mainly concentrated his Internal Breath on his knees earlier. The defense at the base of his calf was not tight, and the force of Chu Nan\u2019s punch was as high as 323.459832 kilograms. After his punch landed, there was a slight cracking sound.Lu Mingcheng only felt a sharp pain coming from his calf, and his body tilted.If not for his timely reaction, he would have used his left foot to jump back and stabilize his body. He would have been knocked to the ground by Chu Nan\u2019s punch.Lu Mingcheng exerted strength with his left foot and tapped the ground with his right foot. He stood on one foot and looked at Chu Nan in shock.This guy had actually injured him!Chu Nan shook his head lightly with a dissatisfied expression.If he could successfully mobilize his Internal Breath with this punch, the force would at least be twice as great.If Lu Mingcheng\u2019s calf received such a punch, it would at least fracture and he would lose most of his combat strength.Although Chu Nan\u2019s punch had a certain effect, it would at most cause a slight injury to Lu Mingcheng\u2019s calf, meridians, and bones. It would not affect him much and it would not give him any confidence in winning.In the previous ten minutes, although Chu Nan had been avoiding most of the time, he had actually been observing Lu Mingcheng\u2019s combat style and collecting his various data to determine his combat strategy.After some analysis, Lu Mingcheng was indeed worthy of being an Internal Breath expert. His Internal Breath could circulate throughout his body at all times in battle and unleash extremely powerful strength, causing Chu Nan to be unable to fight him.However, he had a huge problem. He liked to completely focus his Internal Breath on one point, which neglected the defense that belonged to other parts.Generally speaking, this was not a very serious flaw.After all, ordinary Internal Breath Martial Artists could only mobilize their Internal Breath just now. To be able to gather their Internal Breath at one point like Lu Mingcheng and create an even stronger lethality was already considered very outstanding.Even if this would cause some flaws, there were already very few martial artists of the same level who could see these flaws, let alone grasp them.However, Chu Nan was one of those existences.After the punch, Chu Nan had the upper hand in this battle for the first time. He did not give Lu Mingcheng any chance to catch his breath. Just as he retreated, he took another step forward and followed up with a punch.The third stance and first move of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u2014Shooting Horse Rush Fist.Lu Mingcheng had just been injured and could not dodge in time. Moreover, he did not intend to dodge at all. When he saw Chu Nan\u2019s punch, he grunted and received it with a punch.In the end, Chu Nan was only an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist. If he wanted to fight head-on with an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, he would welcome it the most.However, it was obvious that Chu Nan was not that stupid. When he saw Lu Mingcheng\u2019s punch, he only took a wrong step and his body slid slightly to the left. He happened to dodge the punch and aimed at the right.Because Lu Mingcheng\u2019s right calf had been struck by Chu Nan\u2019s punch earlier, it was still in unbearable pain and it was difficult for him to move. Naturally, he could not dodge Chu Nan\u2019s punch in time and could only barely turn his body to the side. He transformed his fist into a palm and planned to receive it head-on.However, Chu Nan flipped his wrist and his body sank to the right. His right fist was retracted and his left fist followed his twisted body.The second stance and first move of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist\u2014Retreating Horse Rush Fist!This punch greatly exceeded Lu Mingcheng\u2019s expectations. Moreover, it just happened to choose the largest gap in his right body, causing him to be unable to dodge at all. He was even unable to block it with his palm, and he could only withdraw his body with all his might while his arms protected his body as he forcefully received it.Bang!Chu Nan\u2019s punch did not change its move again. Instead, it firmly struck Lu Mingcheng\u2019s arms.Lu Mingcheng\u2019s body swayed for a moment before returning to normal.\u201cHeh, kid, in the end, you\u2019re only a rookie Overlord Body Martial Artist. Even if I stand here and let you hit me, can you do anything to me?\u201d Feeling that the force of Chu Nan\u2019s punch was still unable to break through the defense of his Internal Breath, Lu Mingcheng sneered.Chu Nan glanced at him and did not respond. He threw another punch.Lu Mingcheng counterattacked again, but just like before, after a few changes, Chu Nan forced him to defend again.However, he did not panic this time. He only set up his Internal Breath to protect his vital points and planned to let Chu Nan attack.Up until now, he still did not understand why Chu Nan\u2019s external martial technique was so powerful, causing him, an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, to be unable to gain any advantage and instead be restricted everywhere.However, he knew very well that the greatest difference between him and Chu Nan was the Internal Breath.In the end, Chu Nan was only an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist. Without enough Internal Breath to support him, he was unable to suppress his powerful attacks.He only needed to be careful and Chu Nan could do nothing about it.When Chu Nan was exhausted, he would definitely be unable to maintain his nearly perfect movement technique and fist technique. That would be the best time to counterattack.In his excitement, he forgot.Earlier, he had completely suppressed Chu Nan, but now, he could only barely protect himself and try to counterattack.When he saw Chu Nan\u2019s punch, Lu Mingcheng raised his arms and planned to defend against Chu Nan\u2019s attack again. He would take the opportunity to use his Internal Breath to counterattack and make him suffer a loss.Bang!Chu Nan punched the arms of Lu Mingcheng.Lu Mingcheng only felt a copious and terrifying force coming from Chu Nan\u2019s fist. It actually directly scattered the Internal Breath gathered on his arms, and then an extremely terrifying force surged in. His arms emitted a terrifying cracking sound, and then he felt his entire body fly into the air.In the next moment, Lu Mingcheng\u2019s body had already flown out of the platform and smashed heavily into the hard ground below.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosThere was dead silence in the Third Fighting Arena of West Cloud Academy.All the audience looked at Lu Mingcheng who had fallen below the stage and was struggling to get up. Then, they looked at Chu Nan on the stage with stunned expressions.Chu Nan\u2026 had actually won?!What the heck!Chu Nan was only an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist, and he was the lowest initial-stage Overlord Body!How could he defeat an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist like Lu Mingcheng?Unlike ordinary students, although the teachers in the audience were also shocked by the fact that Chu Nan had defeated Lu Mingcheng, they were more concerned about another matter.In the end, Chu Nan\u2019s punch that sent Lu Mingcheng flying undoubtedly contained his Internal Breath. Otherwise, with his low-level Overlord Body realm strength, it was impossible for him to have the strength to send Lu Mingcheng flying with a punch.As teachers of the academy, their knowledge naturally far exceeded the ordinary students beside them. However, they had never heard of an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist being able to unleash Internal Breath with a punch or even send an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist flying.The teachers looked at each other in confusion.\u201cWhat cultivation method does Chu Nan cultivate?\u201d A teacher could not help but ask.The teachers were silent for a moment before shaking their heads.Chu Nan was previously ranked at the bottom of the second grade and was an extremely ordinary student. Naturally, he would not attract the attention of the teachers of the other grades, so how could they know what internal cultivation method he cultivated?However, since Chu Nan was able to fuse his Internal Breath into his moves during the Overlord Body stage of body refinement and send an Internal Breath Martial Artist flying with a punch, the internal cultivation method he cultivated must be extraordinary.However, there were not many outstanding internal cultivation methods in the Earth Federation. Almost all of them were in the hands of those martial arts families and the military. Chu Nan was only an ordinary student without any background, so how could he learn them?Rayne stared at Chu Nan for a moment before his heart suddenly stirred.In the past two days, there was a rumor circulating among the higher-ups of the academy. It was said that Mu Yutong had taken a fancy to Chu Nan and wanted to take him as his disciple.Could it be that Mu Yutong had imparted the powerful internal cultivation method to Chu Nan, allowing him to perform extremely well in the past two days and far surpass the past?However, if that was the case, the fact that Chu Nan was able to master the special cultivation method passed to him by Supremacy Mu Yutong in such a short period of time was enough to prove that his martial arts talent was superb. It was as expected of Mu Yutong\u2019s foresight.The audience below the stage had different thoughts, but Chu Nan, who was on the stage, glanced at Lu Mingcheng who had yet to stand up. He secretly sighed and felt a little regretful.It was not easy for him to encounter an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist as his opponent in reality. He originally wanted to take the opportunity to spar for a period of time and obtain more precious combat experience, but he did not expect that this punch would inadvertently bring out his Internal Breath. The force was as high as 832.873949 kilograms, and it actually directly sent Lu Mingcheng, who had underestimated his opponent, flying.He did not gain nothing from this.When he threw the last punch earlier, Chu Nan originally had the intention to collect data and accumulate experience. He carefully observed and memorized all the relevant physical data. Compared to the experience he had accumulated, it made him feel a little more enlightened.He believed that if the same battle could happen a few more times, he would definitely have hope of achieving his goal.\u2026About 1,200 meters away from the third combat arena was the main administrative building of the West Cloud Academy.At this moment, in the office of the dean on the top floor of the building, the dean of the West Cloud Academy, Feng Ansheng, and the dean of the Martial Arts Branch, Luo Yuntong, looked at the large screen in front of them with ashen expressions.On the large screen, Chu Nan was walking down the stage after Torriman announced his victory.Looking at the group of second-year students excitedly surrounding Chu Nan, Feng Ansheng\u2019s expression was extremely ugly as he turned to look at Luo Yuntong.\u201cThis is the person you found?\u201dLuo Yuntong\u2019s expression was only uglier than his.He stared at Chu Nan for a long time before sighing and standing up.\u201cForget it. The last chance to deal with him has already disappeared. This matter ends here.\u201d\u201cDoes your Luo family plan to let go of Luo Li\u2019s matter just like that?\u201d Feng Ansheng asked in a deep voice.Luo Yuntong smiled bitterly, \u201cMu Yutong and the Seres Security Company have already warned us. Our Luo family can\u2019t provoke these two colossi at the same time.\u201dFeng Ansheng raised his eyebrows in surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for Mu Yutong to interfere, but the Seres Security Company? Why?\u201dLuo Yuntong frowned as if he did not understand.\u201cI don\u2019t know. However, two days ago, the person-in-charge of the Seres Security Company stationed on West Cloud Planet asked someone to bring a message. Although he did not say it explicitly, the meaning was that he hoped that our Luo family would not touch Chu Nan.\u201d\u201cThis Chu Nan is clearly a rural farmer with no background. Why is he related to the Seres Security Company?\u201d Feng Ansheng was puzzled.Luo Yuntong shook his head and did not answer. He turned around and walked out of the dean\u2019s office.Just as he reached the door, Feng Ansheng suddenly spoke again, \u201cI heard that you\u2019ve already met Mu Yutong?\u201dLuo Yuntong\u2019s body shook slightly. He paused for a moment and turned to look at Feng Ansheng. After a moment of silence, he said seriously, \u201cMu Yutong represents the will of the Federation\u2019s joint council this time. Our Luo family has no choice. Dean Feng, please consider it carefully.\u201dFeng Ansheng sneered, \u201cWhat? Your Luo family took the initiative to give up resisting and want to come over and lobby our Feng family now?\u201d\u201cI only advised because we\u2019ve worked together for many years and are all old friends on West Cloud Planet. I don\u2019t have the right to care if Dean Feng and your Feng family are willing to accept it.\u201dAfter saying this, Luo Yuntong pulled open the door and directly left.Feng Ansheng sat in his huge chair and thought for a while in silence. He turned to look at the large screen that had already begun to broadcast the next match, his expression uncertain.\u2026\u201cHeh, Chu Nan, in order to celebrate your victory and obtain the spot, I\u2019ll treat you to a meal today. How about it?\u201dDong Fang turned around and realized that Chu Nan was connected to the game data of Martial Soul. He was immediately overjoyed.\u201cKid, are you really addicted now?\u201d\u201cYes, I really need to fight a large number of experts now. Clearly, it\u2019s most suitable to enter the Martial Soul.\u201d\u201cOh? Why?\u201d Dong Fang asked curiously. \u201cYou weren\u2019t such a martial arts fanatic in the past, right? Did you really become obsessed with martial arts because you suddenly broke through the Nine Revolutions Technique?\u201d\u201cSomething like that.\u201d Chu Nan vaguely explained and ignored Dong Fang as he eagerly entered Martial Soul.A moment later, his consciousness appeared in the virtual space of Martial Soul.As soon as he adapted to the environment, Chu Nan received a few notifications.Flipping it open, he saw that there were a few messages from the system. They were congratulating him for obtaining the achievement of a hundred consecutive wins, obtaining the title of \u201cHundred Kills\u201d, and obtaining the corresponding reward given by the system.Chu Nan had long confirmed the choices of these rewards and did not hesitate to choose the reward of 10,000 federation coins.Soon, he received the notification of 10,000 federation coins on his personal terminal.When he saw the additional numbers on his personal account, Chu Nan immediately became excited.\u201cGreat. I didn\u2019t expect that just by playing a game, I could easily earn 13,000 federation coins. If I had known that I could earn money like this, I wouldn\u2019t have had to work so hard last year.\u201dHowever, he thought about it and shook his head with a bitter smile.Before this, he had always been a useless person who had only barely cultivated the initial-stage Overlord Body. After entering the Martial Soul, he would only be tyrannical. How could he have the qualifications to earn money here?After deleting these relatively obvious system messages, Chu Nan noticed another private message.\u201cWho will send me private messages? That kid Dong Fang doesn\u2019t have to\u2026\u201dChu Nan opened this private message in bewilderment and discovered that it should have been sent before he went offline. It was a message that he had applied to be a friend. It came from an ID called \u201cFree Flower Pistil\u201d.\u201cWho\u2019s this Free Flower Pistil?\u201d Chu Nan thought for a moment and confirmed that he did not have any impression of this ID. Moreover, other than Dong Fang, the only other people he knew in Martial Soul were the two girls, Luo Lan and Rose. They were both unrelated to this person, so he bluntly rejected it.After casually closing the information panel, Chu Nan immediately chose to start a random match.After carefully studying the rules of Martial Soul, Chu Nan knew that he had two choices if he wanted to fight with the true experts in Martial Soul.The first was to win a number of matches and increase one\u2019s level. From there, one could join higher-level matches and might be matched with high-level opponents.The second was to work hard to increase the winning rate. When the winning rate increased, in order to maintain balance and make the battle more meaningful, the system would match one with stronger opponents.No matter what one he chose, to put it bluntly, it was the same method. That was\u2026 to fight!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She lost again!It was not easy for her to obtain another 13 consecutive wins. Just as she was about to confidently continue charging towards the 30 consecutive wins, she encountered another expert and finally lost.\u201cAhhhh, it\u2019s all that damned Virgin 001\u2019s fault!\u201d Elvy shouted angrily.Ever since her 29 consecutive wins yesterday had been ended by Virgin 001, Elvy had not slept at all. She had been obsessed with \u201cMartial Soul\u201d because she wanted to achieve her 30 consecutive wins as soon as possible so that she could brag about it in front of her friends.However, starting from yesterday, she only had a consecutive 16 wins. After that, she never exceeded this number again.Thinking about her previous experience playing this game, she usually only had more than ten consecutive wins. In fact, if she only had a few consecutive wins, she would be matched to an expert by the battle system and lose.The 29 consecutive wins yesterday was already her best chance.Thinking of this, Elvy\u2019s anger towards Virgin 001 rose.\u201cThis damned guy, if I bump into you again, I\u2019ll definitely teach you a lesson!\u201dElvy gritted her teeth and opened her personal information bar. She was surprised to discover that her invitation to add Virgin 001 as a friend had been rejected.\u201cHow dare you reject me!\u201dElvy was even angrier.This damned guy ruined her plan. Did he think it could end like this?Elvy snorted softly and sent another friend request to Virgin 001. At the same time, she sent a message.\u201cCoward! Are you afraid?\u201dAfter doing this, Elvy suddenly felt an extremely strong sense of exhaustion sweep over her. Only then did she remember that she had not slept for a day and night. She hurriedly exited Martial Soul and did not even bother to wash up before sleeping. She turned around and lay on the bed. In less than half a minute, she fell asleep.A moment later, the bedroom door opened quietly. Dunleavy poked his head in and glanced at Elvy, who was sleeping soundly in the bed. He smiled bitterly and shook his head.If he had not helped cover up in front of his parents, the fact that Elvy had played overnight in Martial Soul would have been exposed.However, it was already close to noon. If she still did not get up, it would not make sense no matter how he found an excuse in front of his mother.Looking at Elvy\u2019s current situation, she had clearly just fallen asleep.Should he wake her up now and let her be prepared? Or should he wait for his mother to come over and wake her up personally so that the two of them could face his wrath?Thinking of this, Dunleavy smiled bitterly again.It was all that damned Virgin 001\u2019s fault!\u2026\u201cCongratulations on winning this battle, Virgin 001. You obtained 1 point from this victory.\u201d\u201cYour points have already reached 200. Your level has increased to 3.\u201d\u201cYou have successfully activated the cross-level challenge mode.\u201dLooking at the series of system notifications, Chu Nan was stunned.He had clearly fought less than 200 rounds, so how did he get 200 points?He thought for a moment before realizing.When he obtained 30 consecutive wins and 100 consecutive wins, he had obtained additional points. No wonder he could reach 200 points so quickly.Of course, this was not important. What really attracted Chu Nan\u2019s attention was the last notification: Activate the cross-level challenge mode!\u201cVery good. I finally don\u2019t have to waste time on these initial-stage Overlord Body experts.\u201d Chu Nan excitedly waved his fists.Indeed, regardless of whether it was the hundred consecutive victories from before or the dozens of consecutive victories this time, it was not very meaningful to him.This was because his opponent was limited to the initial-stage Overlord Body realm or even the Novice Realm, causing him to be unable to obtain much precious combat experience in battle.In his opinion, this was simply no different from wasting time.He had forgotten that a few days ago, he was an initial-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist that he looked down on\u2026After activating the cross-level challenge mode, Chu Nan did not waste any time and immediately chose to challenge someone above his level.In less than a minute, he matched up with an opponent.Chu Nan chose to enter the venue and saw some information about his opponent.ID: Kicking the Milky Way KindergartenLevel: Second-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist\u201cSecond-stage Overlord Body?\u201d Chu Nan frowned slightly.Although he had opened a cross-level challenge, his opponent had only risen from the initial-stage Overlord Body realm to the second-stage Overlord Body realm. The change was not big.On the other hand, when the person opposite him saw Chu Nan, he immediately laughed.\u201cHaha, Virgin 001? I say, brother, are you really still a virgin? This is too strange! Don\u2019t tell me you want to become famous in this game because no woman is interested in you? You want to pick up girls through this?\u201dBefore Chu Nan could answer, Kicking the Milky Way Kindergarten coldly snorted before continuing.\u201cHmph! Let me tell you now. A second-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist is not someone a rookie like you can easily challenge!\u201dAfter saying that, Kicking the Milky Way Kindergarten bent his body slightly. With a spring of his feet, he rushed towards Chu Nan like an arrow.It had to be said that although a second-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist was only a level higher than an initial-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist, because the degree of tempering of the flesh body was completely different, it clearly surpassed the previous opponents in all aspects.Be it speed, strength, body coordination, or other attributes, Kicking the Milky Way Kindergarten was much stronger than the opponent Chu Nan had encountered before.Of course, this was useless.After determining the direction and angle of the other party\u2019s charge, Chu Nan took a step forward and threw a simple Sitting Horse Rush Fist, hitting the space under the other party\u2019s ribs.He did not even have the chance to scream before he turned into a white light and disappeared.When he heard the female voice announce his victory, Chu Nan was stunned.Earlier, he had only calculated the location and angle of this punch and directly punched out. He did not even think about the subsequent variations of the move. In fact, it was quite casual.However, he did not expect that this punch would just so happen to mobilize his Internal Breath. The force on the fist exceeded 800 kilograms. As a mere second-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist, being struck in the chest and ribs by this punch naturally meant that Kicking the Milky Way Kindergarten would be killed with a single punch and then be judged by the system to have lost.After leaving the combat room, Chu Nan looked at his fist with a strange expression.Up until now, he still did not understand why he could sometimes mobilize his Internal Breath, but sometimes he could not.Although he had the help of a powerful data ability that could allow him to clearly know the detailed data of every punch, the data was completely different every time, causing him to be unable to analyze the pattern that could be commonly used.There was no other way to resolve this. He could only try his best to engage in actual combat and collect more data before analyzing the patterns and reasons.However, before that, he had to take note of one thing. If he fought people in the future, he had to be careful.If he were to spar with a second-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist or a lower-level martial artist like Kicking the Milky Way Kindergarten, wouldn\u2019t he be able to kill them with a single punch?\u201cI didn\u2019t expect such a side effect\u2026\u201dChu Nan helplessly shook his head and thought that he should quickly find the pattern and reason for mobilizing his Internal Breath.Only by truly being able to freely mobilize his Internal Breath and even becoming a true Internal Breath Martial Artist would he not have to worry about this problem.Thinking of this, Chu Nan immediately chose the next random challenge.While waiting for the system to match his opponent, Chu Nan noticed another message in his personal information bar.After clicking it curiously, he realized that it was actually from that person called \u201cFree Flower Pistil\u201d.This was an invitation to add him as a friend, but there was another sentence added on the back.\u201cCoward! Are you afraid?\u201dChu Nan looked at this sentence in confusion.What had he done to this Free Flower Pistil?At this moment, the system happened to notify him that he had already matched up with a suitable opponent. Chu Nan casually rejected the invitation and deleted the information before choosing to enter the battle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Today, the martial artist competition on West Cloud Planet had finally officially begun. Not only did it attract all the martial artists on West Cloud Planet, but it also attracted the other martial artists from the surrounding administrative galaxies and many martial artists from the surrounding kingdoms.Just the total number of martial artists participating in the competition had already surpassed 30,000. As for the audience who had come to watch the competition, they had roughly estimated that it had already surpassed 200,000. This was truly an extremely rare large-scale event on West Cloud Planet in the past decade.The West Cloud Star\u2019s government placed an abnormal importance on this Martial Artist Competition. This time, they mobilized an incomparably large amount of resources and even applied for administrative support from the federation government. This was to ensure that this competition would smoothly proceed and end successfully.One had to know that the West Cloud Planet had actually invited two Star-Grade Martial Artists in one go this time. Among them, Norman was even invited from the Phezzan Autonomous Region. The price paid could be imagined.It was also because of the appearance of these two Star-Grade Martial Artists that so many martial artists signed up to participate in the martial artist competition.Apart from the high rewards provided by the West Cloud Planet\u2019s government, attracting the attention of two Star-Grade Martial Artists was something that many participating martial artists dreamed of.\u201cEven if Supremacy Mu Yutong doesn\u2019t take me as his disciple, it\u2019s good that he took a fancy to me and casually guided me.\u201dAs soon as he got out of the car, another participant named Afashenko from West Cloud Academy who was walking beside Chu Nan glanced at the bustling crowd and could not help but sigh.Chu Nan glanced at him and thought to himself that his future had already been sentenced to death by Mu Yutong. He did not need to have unrealistic fantasies like Afashenko.However, he still had a clear goal in participating in the martial arts competition this time.In front of Zheng Yuanlin, he had solemnly expressed that he wanted to win the championship of his team so that Mu Yutong could recommend him the qualifications to enter Star Cloud Academy.In addition, according to the rules of this competition, if he was able to obtain the champion of the martial artist group under the age of 20, he would obtain the reward of 300,000 federation coins given by the West Cloud Planet\u2019s government!Just this point was enough for him to work hard to win the championship.One had to know that his parents were only a pair of ordinary farmers on the West Cloud Planet. The income from hard farming for a year combined could not even reach 100,000 federation coins.If he could win this reward, it would undoubtedly make his parents feel much more relaxed.Of course, it was not so easy to win the championship.According to the reports, there were more than 30,000 martial artists participating in the martial artist competition this time. Because of the information that Supremacy Mu Yutong had revealed, there were even more young martial artists participating in the group competition below the age of 20. In fact, nearly half of them were participating, which meant that there were more than 10,000 people.This point was fully verified after Chu Nan signed up to participate in a competition below the age of 20 and discovered that the number he obtained was 12333.\u201c12333? What a pity, we\u2019re not in the same region. I can\u2019t let you taste my fist as soon as possible.\u201d A voice filled with hatred sounded beside Chu Nan.Chu Nan turned around and looked at the person in front of him who had the same vicious gaze. He deliberately glanced at the other party\u2019s lower body and smiled.\u201cWhat? Luo Li, you\u2019ve only recovered for less than two days, and you want to be crippled again?\u201dLuo Li could not help but clench his legs tightly before letting out a muffled groan. He hurriedly released his grip and stared at Chu Nan.\u201cKid, don\u2019t be complacent too early. I admit that I underestimated you last time, but I\u2019m already serious now. Just wait and escape for your life!\u201dAfter saying that, Luo Li\u2019s gaze swept past Chu Nan\u2019s lower body. He sneered and turned around to leave.Seeing that he had walked far away, Afashenko, who had been watching the show by the side, sneered and said with a dissatisfied expression, \u201cWhat qualifications does this kid have to be arrogant? If not for the backing of the Luo family, he wouldn\u2019t even have the qualifications to participate in a different competition.\u201dLuo Li had been insta-killed by Chu Nan in the first round of the qualifiers and thus lost his qualifications.If it was an ordinary student, he clearly could not represent West Cloud Academy in this martial arts competition.However, Luo Li completely healed his injuries in a short few days and obtained the special recommendation spot given by the West Cloud Academy to participate.All of this was naturally because he had the huge figure of the Luo family behind him.Compared to Luo Li, who came from a martial arts family, Chu Nan and the two ordinary students were undoubtedly far inferior in this aspect.In order to prepare for this martial arts competition, the West Cloud Planet\u2019s government had opened up more than a thousand temporary combat arenas in the eastern outskirts of West Cloud City.Most of the combat arenas were actually very simple and crude. It was only an ordinary venue. There were no other facilities. Even the audience seats were not specially set.Among them, only a total of 15 combat arenas were complete. However, they were all arranged for relatively popular competitions. Among the competitors, there were already some famous martial artists from the West Cloud Star or the surrounding galaxies.Chu Nan was clearly not one of them.After registering, he was quickly arranged to fight in the first round.Because he was participating in other competitions below the age of 20, the opponent Chu Nan was assigned to was only a teenager.When he had just gone on stage, this young martial artist carrying the number 10389 was still a little nervous.However, after seriously sizing Chu Nan up, he suddenly smiled proudly.\u201cHa, West Cloud Academy is really getting worse year by year. Even a guy like you who looks like a rookie can be sent out to be a student representative. Looking at you, you must have gotten the recommendation spot through the back door, right? Didn\u2019t the adults in your family tell you that martial artists can get injured in fights?\u201dAfter saying this, he laughed wildly with a look of disdain.Chu Nan could not help but shake his head.Among the second-grade representatives, only Luo Li could participate through connections.However, Luo Li was a true fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist, so how could he be so easy to deal with?He could not be bothered to waste his breath on the other party and turned to look at the referee.The referee lowered his head to look at the time. After confirming that it was already time for the first round of the martial arts competition to begin for those below the age of 20, he gestured to the two of them at the same time.\u201cKid, go back and drink milk!\u201dThe opponent grinned and stepped on the ground, rushing towards Chu Nan.Seeing his actions, Chu Nan frowned slightly.This guy\u2019s movements were loose and his posture was full of mistakes. Not to mention that he was almost flawless like Chu Nan and could even unleash nearly 100% of his physical strength, he was basically not much stronger than ordinary people who did not practice martial arts.At this level, he dared to register to participate in the martial arts competition?Seeing that his opponent was about to pounce in front of him, Chu Nan slightly turned around and kicked.\u201cAh\u2014\u201dHis opponent let out an earth-shattering scream and fell to the ground like a wooden log. He covered his lower body with both hands and curled up in pain.Chu Nan squatted down expressionlessly. He picked up his opponent\u2019s collar, dragged him to the edge of the field, and threw him out.The referee and the few audience members looked at Chu Nan in shock and did not react for a long time.It was not until Chu Nan reminded the referee that he swallowed his saliva with difficulty and raised his hands to announce.\u201cThe competition\u2026 has ended. The winner\u2026\u201d At this point, the referee lowered his head to confirm the match schedule in his hand, \u201cContestant 12333, Chu Nan.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is the special program, Focus News, brought to you by the Federation\u2019s Information Martial Arts World Channel. I\u2019m your host, Diana.\u201d\u201cI believe everyone should be able to guess the content of today\u2019s special topic. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition that will officially be held this morning.\u201d\u201cThe martial arts competition held by West Cloud Planet can be said to be the grandest martial arts event held by the federation in recent years. According to the latest news, it has already attracted nearly 40,000 martial artists to register and participate. At the same time, it has attracted more than 200,000 spectators to the scene to watch the battle.\u201d\u201cIn order to probe deeper into this Martial Competition, we have invited two guests\u2026\u201dThe camera turned and moved away from the beautiful and generous Diana with beautiful golden hair. It landed on a middle-aged man sitting on her left.\u201cOne of them is a guest that everyone is very familiar with. He has participated in a few times in the past and is a famous martial artist in the federation who has stepped into the second-stage of the Heaven Control Realm, Rengal.\u201dWith long, fluffy brown hair and rough facial features, the lion-like Rengal raised his hand at the camera and smiled. However, he did not have any gentleness in him. Instead, he looked like a ferocious beast ready to eat people at any moment.\u201cThe other is Miss Tang Xiaoyou, the deputy editor of \u2018Martial Arts Exploration\u2019, a famous martial arts expert.\u201dThe camera moved away from Rengal\u2019s beast-like face and turned to the right of Diana. Immediately, the scene changed. A young and beautiful face with exquisite and small features, filled with the characteristics of the Earth\u2019s East Asian descent, appeared in front of the camera.The woman smiled at the camera. Although she was not as beautiful and charming as Diana, she was much more comfortable to look at.\u201cDo you have anything to say about this West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial artist competition?\u201dAfter introducing the two guests, Diana asked their opinions as usual.Rengal was just about to speak when Tang Xiaoyou spoke first. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t think much of the martial arts competition held by West Cloud Planet.\u201d\u201cOh? Why?\u201d Diana asked in surprise.\u201cAccording to what I know, the rewards given by the West Cloud Star\u2019s government for this martial artist competition are all corresponding federation coins. Although these rewards can attract a large number of martial artists to participate, I have always thought that for those truly powerful martial artists, what can attract them is definitely not meaningless money, but honor and the pursuit of martial arts.\u201d\u201cSo, you don\u2019t think there are any true experts in your eyes in the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition, right?\u201d asked Diana.\u201cPerhaps there is, but there definitely won\u2019t be many.\u201d Tang Xiaoyou did not fall for this trick and did not say anything.Diana smiled and turned to look at Rengal.\u201cMr. Rengal, what do you think of Miss Tang Xiaoyou\u2019s viewpoint?\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d Rengal sneered and exhaled. He actually showed disdain towards Tang Xiaoyou\u2019s words, \u201cWho told you that true powerful martial artists look down on money?\u201dTang Xiaoyou was not surprised by Rengal\u2019s unyielding retort. She raised her eyebrows and immediately asked, \u201cMr. Rengal, do you mean that you also like money?\u201d\u201cNonsense! Why wouldn\u2019t I like it?\u201d Rengal sneered softly, as if he felt that Tang Xiaoyou\u2019s words were extremely laughable, \u201cDo you think martial artists don\u2019t need to eat? Let me tell you, no matter how powerful a martial artist is, they still value money. If you don\u2019t believe me, go ask the two Star-Grade Martial Artists, Mu Yutong and Norman, who are holding the martial arts competition, if they like money?\u201d\u201cThe two of them are incomparably powerful Star-Grade Martial Artists. How can they be attracted by vulgar money?\u201d Tang Xiaoyou immediately retorted.Seeing that the two of them were actually planning to start an argument at the beginning of the show, Diana hurriedly interrupted them and said, \u201cJust now, Martial Artist Rengal mentioned the two Star-Grade Martial Artists, Mu Yutong and Norman, who were invited to appear in this West Cloud Martial Competition. Then, let\u2019s connect to the reporters at the scene ahead and let them bring us live news to see if these two Star-Grade Martial Artists have already appeared at the scene.\u201dThe scene changed, and a scene with a high altitude view appeared.Below was a huge piece of flat ground that was divided by rectangular venues. There were nearly a thousand densely packed areas.Apart from the fifteen standard arena-like venues in the middle, the other places were only ordinary flat ground that were simply divided.This scene had often appeared on the federation\u2019s information martial arts world channel recently. It even appeared on the first news channel of the federation. It was the venue of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s Martial Artist Competition.From the sky, nearly a thousand venues were surrounded by people. At this moment, two figures were crossing each other in each venue. Clearly, two martial artists were fighting. The scene could be said to be abnormally grand.Coupled with the background music specially provided by the federation, it made people\u2019s blood boil.The camera lasted for about five seconds before it quickly sank and landed beside one of the venues.A young girl appeared on screen.\u201cHello everyone, I\u2019m the live reporter, Yang Xirui. I\u2019ve brought you the live report of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition.\u201dThe girl introduced herself slightly before turning around and pointing at the venue behind her and the surrounding crowd.\u201cEveryone can see that behind me is an ongoing competition between groups below the age of 20. Although it\u2019s only a low-level competition, it still attracted so many spectators to watch. From this, it can be seen how enthusiastic this West Cloud Martial Arts Competition is.\u201d\u201cYang Xirui, have you seen these two Star-Grade Martial Artists, Mu Yutong and Norman?\u201d asked Diana, who was still in the broadcast room.Yang Xirui paused for a moment before answering, \u201cRegarding the situation of the two Star-Grade Martial Artists that everyone is most concerned about, they had already personally appeared in front of the audience during the opening ceremony of the martial arts competition this morning. However, after the opening ceremony, the two of them had already left. It is said that only when the finals begin will the two of them appear at the scene later.\u201d\u201cAlright, please continue to introduce the situation to everyone.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dYang Xirui turned around and noticed that the two participating martial artists seemed to be prepared. He hurriedly gestured for the camera to follow.\u201cEveryone, look. These two participating martial artists are about to officially begin the competition. We all know that this West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition has specially divided martial artists below the age of 20 into another group, in hopes of selecting young martial arts geniuses in the federation. These two participating competitors look very young, but their figures are strong and healthy. Clearly, they are young martial artists with extremely solid foundations. I believe that there will definitely be a fierce battle between them. Let us look forward to them bringing us an exciting competition\u2026\u201dBefore Yang Xirui could finish speaking, she saw that the young martial artist on the right had already rushed over. Then, the young martial artist on the left tilted his body slightly, took a step forward, and kicked up, hitting the crotch of the opponent who was rushing over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let\u2019s return to the broadcast room.\u201dThe scene switched back to the broadcast room of \u201cFocus News\u201d. The atmosphere was a little strange.\u201cErm\u2026 Thank you for the exciting live report Yang Xirui brought us.\u201d Although she had long seen countless strange things as the host of the \u201cFocus News\u201d, she still felt a little awkward when she said this at this moment, \u201cWhat do the two guests think about the situation at the scene?\u201d\u201cDespicable!\u201d Tang Xiaoyou rebuked rudely, \u201cThat young martial artist who appeared on the screen just now is simply insulting the term \u2018martial artist\u2019! How can he\u2026 how can he attack such an important part of his opponent? This is simply\u2026 simply violating the basic morals of a martial artist!\u201d\u201cWhat a joke!\u201d Rengal immediately expressed his dissatisfaction, \u201cHow can there be any morals in a battle between martial artists? Could it be that in a life and death battle, you still have to be wary and not attack the other party\u2019s vital points? This is simply nonsense!\u201d\u201cBut this is not a life and death battle. This is only an ordinary martial arts competition!\u201d Tang Xiaoyou emphasized.\u201cSo what? As a martial artist, what I pursue is to defeat the enemy in the simplest and most effective way. I admire that young martial artist very much because he used the most direct, most effective, and least stamina-consuming method to defeat his opponent.\u201d\u201cMr. Rengal, could it be that you would use the same move when facing an enemy?\u201d Diana interrupted at the right time.\u201cIf there\u2019s a chance, why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d Rengal sneered at the question, \u201cSince even this Miss Tang Xiaoyou knows that it\u2019s the enemy\u2019s weakness, why don\u2019t I target it?\u201d\u201cThen what if the enemy is a female martial artist? Do you also plan to do this?\u201d Tang Xiaoyou immediately asked.\u201cFemale martial artists are also martial artists. Since you have become a martial artist, you must resolve yourself to fight.\u201d Rengal rebuked with equal harshness.\u201cImpressive, Mr. Rengal. You can even be so vicious to women. Can I assume that Heaven Control Martial Artists like you\u2026\u201dSeeing that the topic of the two guests had already deviated, Diana was not in a hurry to pull them back to the topic.Using the conflict between the guests to attract attention and increase the ratings of this program was a common trick.In any case, the initial procedures of the program had already been completed. Now that Rengal and Tang Xiaoyou were arguing, she was happy to see it.\u2026Chu Nan did not expect that his casual kick would actually cause the two famous people of the federation who were hundreds of light-years away to argue in front of countless spectators.From the first match onwards, he had already used this kick to finish his opponent three times in a row.As Rengal had said, this was the most direct, effective, and least physically draining solution.The opponents in these three consecutive rounds were only initial-stage Overlord Body or second-stage Overlord Body. Chu Nan could not even obtain the value to practice on them, so he was naturally unwilling to waste time on them. Therefore, he dealt with them as quickly as possible.In any case, in order to ensure the safety of this martial arts competition, the West Cloud Planet\u2019s government had equipped the most advanced and appropriate service facilities. Even if these opponents\u2019 lower bodies were severely damaged, they would be immediately sent for treatment and would not cause any true damage.The only thing to worry about was that he had used this method to end the battles in three consecutive rounds. He was afraid that his nickname of \u201cDescendant Slayer\u201d would be given just like that.At the thought of this, Chu Nan hurriedly looked around and heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that there were no familiar faces around.After all, it was only the initial stages of the competition for those under the age of 20. Because his standards were too low, he could not attract too many people to watch. Even the West Cloud Academy did not pay much attention to him, so his performance in these three competitions was not too far away.Chu Nan opened his personal terminal and checked the real-time situation. He discovered that because he had won three consecutive rounds, he had already entered the fourth round of the group competition below the age of 20.According to the final statistics, the total number of martial artists participating in the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial artist competition reached 37,081. Among them, the number of martial artists participating in the group competition below the age of 20 had reached 14,993.Therefore, even though Chu Nan had already entered the fourth round, he was only one of the remaining 2,000 participants. He still had to pass a few more rounds before he could enter the final stage.However, from the situation of the opponents he had encountered in the previous three rounds, although there were many martial artists participating in the competition below the age of 20, there were very few with high standards. Therefore, if nothing unexpected happened, it would not be a problem for Chu Nan to enter the final stage.This actually disappointed him.Although his first goal in participating in this Martial Artist Competition was to perform well in the finals and obtain the special recommendation that Mu Yutong had given him to enter Star Cloud Academy, and his second goal was to win those generous cash rewards, besides this, he also hoped that he could encounter a few powerful opponents in this competition and allow him to fight a few more times with sufficient weight to obtain more combat data and accumulate more combat experience.However, because the opponents he faced were too weak, they were probably even inferior to him before he obtained the data ability. How could they give him enough combat experience?\u201cI might as well fight a few more rounds in Martial Soul\u2026\u201d Chu Nan could not help but sigh.In the past few days, Chu Nan had spent almost all his free time in Martial Soul.Through a large number of battles, he had already raised his points to level five and could start higher-level random battles.In the recent few rounds, he could already match with third-stage Overlord Body Realm players.Although such an opponent still could not satisfy him, it could already allow him to fight well and accumulate enough combat experience.This was far from enough.Although every battle could allow Chu Nan to gather a lot of detailed combat data and accumulate experience, he was still unable to summarize the pattern of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist to stimulate his Internal Breath, so he was still unable to mobilize his Internal Breath as he pleased in battle.Chu Nan had also checked many information, but he had never seen any information related to the mobilization of Internal Breath by an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist in battle. Therefore, he knew very well that he could only rely on himself to slowly figure this out. There was no other way.The key point was that there were enough battles.\u201cIf only I could have the chance to continuously fight initial-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists like I did in the virtual space.\u201dAs soon as this thought flashed through his mind, Chu Nan\u2019s gaze landed on a young man passing by on the left and he was slightly shocked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was burly, and his exposed skin revealed a special luster. Clearly, he was a martial artist who had already reached the large success stage of the Overlord Body.However, from his age, he should be the same as Chu Nan, a young martial artist who participated in a group competition below the age of 20.However, this was not what attracted Chu Nan\u2019s attention.\u2018What really made Chu Nan notice him and even feel surprised was that this young martial artist\u2019s walking posture looked a little strange. Every step seemed to be taken with extreme force and not ordinary walking.As he stepped down, an undetectable trace of dark red aura would always appear from the bottom of his feet, and it would instantly disappear.Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist!This West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition had attracted a total of 14,993 young martial artists below the age of 20 to participate. It was not strange for some young martial artists who had cultivated to the Internal Breath Realm before the age of 20 to appear, but this young Internal Breath MartialArtist gave Chu Nan a very special feeling.In the tens of thousands of battles in the virtual space, Chu Nan had fought countless low-level Internal Breath Martial Artists in an infinitely realistic manner. He knew very well that for an Internal Breath Martial Artist, the Internal Breath was hidden most of the time and would only erupt when a battlewas needed.However, with every step this young Internal Breath Martial Artist took, a trace of Internal Breath would erupt and be used on his feet.If this was not intentional, then it could only be explained as a special cultivation method.Perhaps sensing Chu Nan\u2019s gaze, the young martial artist suddenly turned around.Their gazes collided. That person sized up Chu Nan and revealed a disdainful smile before gesturing provocatively at him.Chu Nan shook his head and ignored his provocation. He turned around and walked towards the gathering point of the West Cloud Academy.When the young martial artist in the distance saw Chu Nan turn around and leave, he thought that he was afraid and sneered.\u201cTsk, this bunch of gutless fellows from the Earth Federation.\u201d\u201cshut your mouth, Maruk.\u201d An equally young martial artist had appeared beside him at some point and shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we\u2019re surrounded by people from the Earth Federation. If they hear us, be careful not to anger the public.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d The young martial artist called Maruk raised his head slightly, his expression arrogant and unyielding, \u201cCould it be that these guys dare to swarm us? These fellows from the Earth Federation care the most about the meaningless reputation. They definitely won\u2019t do this. As for one-on-one.Ha!\u201dThe other young martial artist frowned slightly, shook his head, and pulled him away.\u2018When Chu Nan returned to the gathering point of West Cloud Academy, he discovered that other than the teacher-in-charge, he was the only one who came.\u201cChu Nan, why are you so fast? Could it be\u2026\u201d After seeing him, the teacher\u2019s expression was a little ugly,\u201d You\u2019ve been eliminated? \u201dAccording to the time, most of the competitions were only until the second round. The third round had not even begun.Since Chu Nan had retumed so early, the greatest possibility was that he had been eliminated early.\u201cNo, I\u2019ve already finished the third round.\u201d Chu Nan shook his head.\u201cSo fast?\u201d The teacher looked at Chu Nan in surprise.\u201cYes, I fought slightly faster.\u201d Chu Nan shrugged.\u201cYou fought faster?\u201d The teacher looked at Chu Nan with a strange expression.He had heard that during the internal qualification competition, the battle where Chu Nan defeated Luo Li could be considered an instant kill.However, the reason for that instant kill was because Chu Nan had kicked an important part of Luo Li\u2019s body.Chu Nan ignored the teacher\u2019s strange expression and looked around. When he discovered that it was still early, he asked, \u201cMy competition today has ended. Can I go back first?\u201d\u201cReturn early?\u201d The teacher-in-charge was stunned, \u201cWhy are you in such a hurry? It\u2019s best to return together after everyone ends the competition. We\u2019re all from the same academy, so how can we not travel together?\u201dChu Nan frowned. He originally wanted to return early and fight a few more rounds in Martial Soul to quickly increase his points and enter higher-level combat arenas before fighting stronger opponents.However, since the teacher-in-charge had given such a righteous reason, he could not refute. He could only nod and agree.Seeing that Chu Nan had sat down calmly, the teacher-in-charge opened his personal terminal and connected to the official information network of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition to start searching for real-time results.After using the two key words \u201cChu Nan\u201d and \u201c12333\u201d, he quickly found Chu Nan\u2019s battle results.With just a glance, his eyes immediately widened in surprise.Chu Nan had indeed won three rounds in a row and successfully advanced to the fourth round, but this was not surprising. What surprised him was the duration of the three rounds.According to the statistics of implementation, the time Chu Nan completed the three rounds was 7 seconds, 8 seconds, and 4 seconds, respectively!These three rounds only took 19 seconds!\u2018The teacher-in-charge glanced at Chu Nan who was thinking with his eyes closed.If he could end the battle in a few seconds, then it could only be one possibility, an instant kill!If it was only one competition, it could be said that the difference in strength between the two sides was too great. However, if it was the same for three consecutive rounds, it could only prove that Chu Nan\u2019s strength had clearly surpassed the average standard of the groups below the age of 20.This was because the information of the martial artists who signed up for the competition would only provide basic identity information and would not report their respective martial artist strength levels. The teacher-in-charge could not make an accurate judgment.However, no matter what, the fact that Chu Nan could obtain such an achievement was enough to show his current strength.\u201cHe\u2019s clearly only at the initial-stage Overlord Body Realm\u2026\u201d The teacher looked at Chu Nan with confusion.Just as he was thinking about some of the rumors regarding the second-grade\u2019s qualifiers in the academy these few days, a figure in the uniform of the West Cloud Academy suddenly stumbled over from the right.\u2018The teacher and Chu Nan looked up at this person and frowned.Surprisingly, this person was another participant other than Chu Nan and Afashenko in the second-grade of the West Cloud Academy. His name was Honda Ajin and he was one of the rare Japanese students in the academy.At this moment, Honda Ajin was full of panic, as if he had been greatly frightened. His usually cautious and polite demeanor had long been thrown away.\u2018The teacher-in-charge took a step forward and asked in a low voice, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cT\u2026 Teacher\u2026\u201d Honda Ajin took a few deep breaths before answering intermittently, \u201cYou\u2026 you should quickly go take a look. Luo\u2026 Luo Li\u2026 His leg was broken by someone. Now\u2026 I\u2019m afraid his life is in danger!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now, he was lying in the emergency room. His legs were bent at an abnormal angle. Clearly, they were broken.Apart from that, his chest even sank. Even through the transparent cover of the emergency room, it was terrifying.Chu Nan believed that if not for the other party clearly showing mercy and not directly putting Luo Li to death, he would probably be a dead man now.Chu Nan did not have any sympathy for this and instead felt that it was funny.Luo Li had always been tyrannizing the West Cloud Academy before and had done countless bad things. A few days ago, Chu Nan had just kicked his vital part in the qualifiers. Now, on the first day of the competition, he had been beaten up until he was seriously injured. Such bad luck was probably hisretribution.However, Chu Nan was also puzzled.Although Luo Li had been easily defeated by Chu Nan in the qualifiers, that was more or less because he had underestimated his opponent too much. In fact, he was a true fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist, so there was no doubt about this.To martial artists below the age of 20, only an extremely small number were able to reach the fifth-stage Overlord Body like Luo Li. Moreover, because Luo Li had the Luo family\u2019s martial technique inheritance, his strength was much stronger than ordinary fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artists.If one wanted to defeat him in a fair environment, it was probably very difficult for ordinary initial-stage or even second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists to easily achieve it. Moreover, to be able to injure him like this, the opponent was clearly extraordinary.Thinking of this, Chu Nan pulled out his personal terminal. Just like the teacher-in-charge earlier, he opened the official information network of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s Martial Artist Competition and started to search for other matches below the age of 20.Soon, he found the information about the battle with Luo Li.This competition was also Luo Li\u2019s third round, but it was labeled as an elimination.Chu Nan opened the detailed information of this round and focused on the relevant information about Luo Li\u2019s opponent.However, the information of this opponent was ordinary in all aspects. The only thing that attracted Chu Nan\u2019s attention was the nationality he had specially marked.\u201cThe Kingdom of Kexley?\u201d Chu Nan raised his head in surprise and asked the frowning teacher beside him, \u201cTeacher, are there other countries participating in this competition?\u201dThe teacher-in-charge was feeling vexed because of Luo Li\u2019s unexpected injuries. When he heard this, he waved his hand impatiently.\u201cOf course. Didn\u2019t the official information say so long ago?\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Chu Nan raised his eyebrows and looked at the official information network of the competition on his personal terminal.Sure enough, from the information revealed by the officials, this West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition did not restrict nationality. Not only did it attract a large number of martial artists from the Earth Federation to register and participate, but also the martial artists from the few countries aroundthe Earth Federation were attracted.On the battle list for those below the age of 20, Chu Nan used the key term \u201cKingdom of Kexley\u201d to search and immediately discovered more than 300 search results, including the participant number 9527 who heavily injured Luo Li.On second thought, this was not strange.This time, the West Cloud Planet\u2019s government had even invited Norman, a Star-Grade Martial Artist from the Phezzan Autonomous Region, to be a guest. Of course, their ambitions were not small. If they wanted to greatly increase the influence of this martial arts competition, it would be natural toattract martial artists from other countries to participate.The only thing that Chu Nan minded was the Kingdom of Kexley.Unlike the Phezzan Autonomous Region, which had always been on good terms with the Earth Federation, the relationship between the Kingdom of Kexley and the Earth Federation had never been good.Forty years ago, a war broke out between the two sides over the resources of a border planet.Although this war did not turn into a full-scale war between the two countries due to the intervention of the Declan Empire, both sides had accumulated resentment.Currently, many people in the Earth Federation were dissatisfied with the Kingdom of Kexley because they had suffered quite a bit in the previous war.If they knew that the martial artists of the Kingdom of Kexley had actually come to participate in this West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition, their first reaction would probably be to shout \u201cbeat them to death\u2019.However\u2026 Luo Li was beaten half to death by someone now. He could only lie in the emergency room and wait for treatment.Chu Nan retracted his thoughts and looked at the form again.Because Luo Li was assigned to a different half of the competition, Contestant 9527, who had defeated him and came from the Kingdom of Kexley, would not meet Chu Nan before the final stage.This fact relieved Chu Nan but also disappointed him.This guy\u2019s strength had clearly surpassed Luo Li by a lot. At the very least, he should be an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist and was suitable for Chu Nan to find a high-level opponent to spar with.However, Chu Nan also knew very well that although he had defeated countless Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists in the virtual space, this did not mean that his true strength was really that powerful.In the virtual space, he could figure out the characteristics and combat methods of an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist through countless failures and use his opponent\u2019s weakness to win. However, in the real world, there were not many opportunities to let him figure out his opponent\u2019s background.This martial artist competition was an elimination system for single matches. As long as he lost one match, he would be directly eliminated. He could not enter the finals at all, let alone win the championship.If he could not win the championship, he would not be able to fulfill the promise he made in front of Zheng Yuanlin. As for entering Star Cloud Academy, there was no need to mention it.From this point of view, it was a good thing that he did not encounter such a powerful opponent before the finals.However, when he recalled that there was actually such a powerful opponent in the martial arts competition, not only was Chu Nan not afraid to retreat, he even felt a trace of excitement.The opponent had to be strong enough!The ones in the first three rounds were too weak, causing him to not feel that he was evenly matched at all. To him, it was almost meaningless.If the opponents in every match were equally weak in the future, then even if he obtained the championship in the end, it would probably not be convincing in Mu Yutong\u2019s eyes.If he could encounter sufficiently powerful opponents in every battle in the future, he could obtain a large amount of useful combat experience from these battles.Perhaps he could obtain a breakthrough from this and grasp the true technique of mobilizing his Internal Breath in battle with the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist.Compared to the true increase in his strength, what was a difficult or even dangerous battle?Slap!Chu Nan clenched his right fist and heavily struck his left palm. The gaze in his eyes burned.From now on, the martial arts competition would truly become interesting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is the special program, Focus News, brought to you by the Federation\u2019s Information Martial Arts World Channel. I\u2019m your host, Diana.\u201d\u201cThe main content of today\u2019s program is still the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition that was held yesterday. After a day of intense competition, the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition has already entered an even more intense stage. The standards of the martial artists who appear aregetting higher and higher, and the competition is also getting more and more exciting.\u201d\u201cToday, we still invited the two guests from yesterday. They are the famous martial artists of the federation\u2014the second-stage Heaven Control Realm Martial Artist, Rengal, and the famous martial arts expert, Miss Tang Xiaoyou.\u201dThe camera turned to the two guests sitting on either side of Diana.Unlike yesterday, the two of them did not have such relaxed expressions, especially Tang Xiaoyou who had a serious expression as if she was facing a major problem.After a simple greeting, Diana rushed to ask Rengal, \u201cMr. Rengal, the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition carried out three rounds of elimination yesterday. What do you think about this?\u201dRengal pondered for a moment and shook his head.\u201cTo be honest, I actually did not pay much attention to the competition yesterday. After all, it was only the first three rounds. The standards were too low. There were even many fellows who did not know martial arts. It was really unbearable to watch.\u201dSuch a straightforward answer stunned Diana. Surprise flashed across her face, but she hid it with a smile.\u201cThis\u2026 Mr. Rengal is a powerful second-stage Heaven Control Realm Martial Artist after all. It\u2019s understandable that he feels that these competitions are low in standards. However, Mr. Rengal, according to the information revealed by the organizing committee, there are several Void Break Realm expertsparticipating in the adult group. What do you think of their competition?\u201d\u201cIf a Void Break Martial Artist were to fight, then the competition would be a little interesting, However, I think the competition\u2019s organizing committee is not that stupid to let such a rare expert encounter each other so early. Therefore, I think that there will at least be a sufficiently exciting competitionwhen we enter the final stage,\u201d Rengal replied.After saying this, Rengal turned his gaze to Tang Xiaoyou.In the program yesterday, Tang Xiaoyou could almost be said to have deliberately gone against him. Almost without him saying a word, Tang Xiaoyou wanted to refute him.Why was this fellow so silent today?Diana clearly noticed this situation. She nodded and echoed Rengal before turning to look at Tang Xiaoyou.\u201cMiss Tang Xiaoyou, what do you think of the competition yesterday?\u201d\u2018Tang Xiaoyou still had a dark expression. She did not answer this question immediately. Instead, she opened her personal terminal and pulled out a diagram on the virtual screen.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d asked Diana curiously.\u201cThis is the statistics of the martial artists participating in this martial arts competition.\u201d Tang Xiaoyou pointed at the largest blue pattern on the map, \u201cThe blue color represents the martial artists participating in our Earth Federation. The other colors represent the martial artists from other countriesparticipating.\u201d\u201cYes, according to the data revealed by the organizing committee, not only did this West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition attract a large number of martial artists from the Earth Federation to participate, it also attracted many martial artists from the surrounding countries to participate. It can besaid to be a rare martial arts event in recent years.\u201dDiana clearly had a detailed investigation of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition, so she immediately replied with certainty.\u201cIdon\u2019t think this is a grand event for our Earth Federation.\u201d Tang Xiaoyou had a serious expression as she pointed at the map and continued to explain, \u201cThis is the statistical map I carried out before the first round. It can be seen that the blue color representing our Earth Federation occupies themajority.\u201d\u201cThis is very normal. After all, this is a martial arts competition held by our Earth Federation,\u201d said Diana.\u201cBut what happened next is abnormal,\u201d Tang Xiaoyou replied coldly. With a move of her finger, the diagram on the virtual screen changed to another. \u201cThis is the statistics I did after the first round of the competition. Do you see any problems?\u201dDiana and Rengal glanced over and immediately saw the obvious difference.Compared to the first diagram, the range of blue on this diagram was clearly much smaller.\u201cWhat you mean is that\u2026 after the first round of the eliminations, the proportion of martial artists in the Earth Federation has decreased greatly?\u201d As the host, Diana had to directly ask this question.\u201cYes.\u201d Tang Xiaoyou nodded.Rengal sneered from the side, \u201cWhat\u2019s so strange about that? Because the martial artists of the Earth Federation are close and there are no restrictions, those of any level have all come to participate in the competition. Eliminating these guys in the first round of the competition is also beneficial to theexcitement of the entire competition.\u201dTang Xiaoyou glanced at Rengal and ignored his retort. With a move of her hand, the diagram on the virtual screen changed again.\u201cThis is my statistics after the second round of the elimination rounds. Everyone can see that compared to the first round, the proportion of blue representing the Earth Federation has clearly decreased greatly.\u201dAs soon as she finished speaking, the map on the virtual screen changed again.\u201cThis is the situation after the third round of the elimination rounds. Clearly, the ratio has decreased greatly agai\u201cLhave more detailed data here. Before the first round of the competition, the ratio of martial artists of the Earth Federation to all participating martial artists was as high as 87.49%. After the first round, it fell to 74.12%. After the second round, it fell to 62.94%. As for after the third round\u2026 there\u2019s only49.17% left, not even half anymore.\u201dLooking at such a straightforward map and hearing such detailed data, even if Rengal had some opinions about Tang Xiaoyou, he could not refute her.Diana frowned slightly and was about to speak when Tang Xiaoyou took out another diagram.\u201cHowever, compared to the overall situation of this competition, I\u2019m more worried about the other groups below the age of 20.\u201d\u201cThis is the map of the nationality of participating martial artists below the age of 20 after the third round of eliminations. Can you see how many are left representing our Earth\u2019s Federation martial artists? It\u2019s only 28.21%! It\u2019s not even a third!\u201d\u201cI\u2019s shocking! The grouping below the age of 20 represents the future of our regional Federation\u2019s martial artists. However, in this West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition, the young martial artists who can pass the first three rounds of the competition from our Earth Federation actually don\u2019t evenmake up a third of the overall participants! What does this mean? It means the degeneration of our Earth Federation\u2019s young martial artists! It means the decline of the Earth Federation\u2019s martial arts!\u201dTowards the end, Tang Xiaoyou already had a pained expression.Rengal frowned, \u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating too much. It\u2019s only a martial arts competition held by West Cloud Planet. Many of the young genius martial artists of our Earth Federation are unwilling to participate, which is why this situation is happening.\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you say that the young genius martial artists of other countries are unwilling to come?\u201d Tang Xiaoyou asked bluntly, \u201cNo matter what, this situation represents a painful fact. That is that our Earth Federation\u2019s current martial arts foundation has already reached an extremely dangerouslevel. It\u2019s already much worse than the other countries around us. We have to pay attention to it!\u201d\u201cRegarding this, the federation has actually made a move.\u201d In order to prevent the two of them from arguing again, Diana hurriedly interrupted, \u201cThe \u2018Foundation Martial Skill Promotion Act\u2019 that the federation has recently pushed proves that the federation has already noticed this problem.\u201dRengal and Tang Xiaoyou looked at Diana and frowned.The Foundation Martial Skill Promotion Act that the federation government had recently pushed caused a huge controversy within the federation because it touched the interests of the various martial arts families in the federation, causing them to rebound.Because of this act, just on West Cloud Planet, which was holding the martial arts competition this time, a powerful protest sounded.Now that Diana had taken the initiative to mention it in this program, was she not worried that it would cause any problems?However, on second thought, Diana was not one of those rookie hosts. She had probably raised this bill on purpose.The two of them tacitly did not answer this topic. After a moment of silence, Tang Xiaoyou said, \u201cWhat I\u2019m worried about now is that if the martial arts competition held by West Cloud Planet ends up with martial artists from other countries winning the championship, then this competition will probablybecome the laughing stock of other countries. Especially in the competitions below the age of 20, I\u2019m very uncertain.\u201dRengal sneered, \u201cAs martial artists, strength speaks for itself. If the Federation martial artists participating in this competition can\u2019t even win the championship of their own territory, then the ones who are embarrassed are themselves!\u201dDiana smiled, \u201cI can understand Miss Tang Xiaoyou\u2019s worry, but let\u2019s wait and see the results.. Let\u2019s connect to the reporters ahead and see how the situation isPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For the first time since he participated in this competition, he felt a trace of excitement and vigilance.This was his fifth round of the elimination round.In the fourth round of the elimination rounds, the opponent he had encountered was still not strong. He was probably only a third-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist and had easily won.He originally thought that he would not encounter any powerful opponents in the fifth round, but reality surprised him.Although this rather old, dark-skinned, and weak opponent did not look special at first glance, Chu Nan only took a glance at his standing posture and immediately made a judgment.It was an expert!Although it only seemed to be a casual standing posture, Chu Nan could deduce from the various statistics that the other party\u2019s entire body was in a state where he could exert strength at any time. Moreover, every part of his body had been adjusted to the optimal state. If he was attacked, he woulddefinitely suffer the quickest and fiercest counterattack.\u2018With the combat experience of tens of thousands of battles in the virtual space, Chu Nan was almost certain that this opponent was definitely an experienced martial artist who had experienced countless battles.Although the other party did not reveal his Internal Breath, his exposed skin was tight and shiny. Every muscle was perfectly shaped. Clearly, he had at least reached the high-stage Overlord Body Realm.Of course, other than these strength characteristics that could be determined by experience, there was another trait that attracted Chu Nan\u2019s attention.He was a foreigner.This young martial artist\u2019s name was Azalu, and his competition number was 5083. He came from the Famaal Chief Alliance about 300 light-years away from the outer spiral arm where the West Cloud Planet was at. He was not a martial artist from the Earth Federation.Chu Nan did not know how the other party came to West Cloud Planet from more than 300 light-years away. He only knew that the other party was an expert, and that was enough.After hearing the referee announce the start of the competition, Chu Nan slowly assumed a posture and focused on waiting for the other party to attack. He planned to make some judgment through the other party\u2019s actions before planning a counterattack.However, he did not expect that the other party would also put on a defensive posture like him, looking like he was waiting for him to attack first.After the two of them were in a deadlock for a while, Chu Nan could not help but laugh when he saw that the other party\u2019s face was still black as if he was a rock.After thinking for a moment, he stepped forward with his left foot and exerted strength in his leg. He had already rushed to Azalu, twisted his body, and threw a punch.Just as Chu Nan moved, Azalu had already reacted. However, his reaction was not intense and his movements were not big. His body sank slightly until Chu Nan threw a punch. Then, he turned around and threw a punch as well.This punch happened to be aimed at the space under Chu Nan\u2019s left ribs.Be it the angle or speed, this punch could be called perfect.1Chu Nan praised in his mind and twisted his body again. His right fist that he had just punched turned left and changed the Shooting Horse Rush Fist to a Sitting Horse Cup Fist.Bang!Although Azalu\u2019s reaction was extremely fast and he had already changed his move the moment Chu Nan changed it, he still could not completely dodge and his right arm was firmly struck by Chu Nan\u2019s punch.However, after Chu Nan\u2019s punch landed, it was as if he had struck a huge rock. Not only was he unable to cause any damage to Azalu, he even vaguely felt a soft counterforce that was completely different from his image.Although this force was soft, it directly penetrated Chu Nan\u2019s fist and entered the meridians of his right arm. It instantly made him feel that his entire right arm was a little sore and weak, so this punch naturally could not carry much force.Chu Nan was shocked and hurriedly retreated. He focused his mind and circulated the Nine Revolutions Technique. A trace of Internal Breath emerged from his dantian and seeped into his right arm to resolve the strange soft force.He raised his head to look at Azalu and discovered that he still had a stone face and continued to put on a defensive posture. It was as if Chu Nan\u2019s attack and counterattack had no effect on him.Internal Breath Realm expert?Chu Nan looked at Azalu in confusion.If Azalu was not an Internal Breath expert, then when Chu Nan punched his arm earlier, he would not have suffered the soft counterattack that should have been mixed with Internal Breath. However, if he was really an Internal Breath expert, why did his punch earlier not contain Internal Breath?Moreover, if he was really an Internal Breath expert, why did he have to be so careful around a low-level Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist like him and put on a defensive appearance?Of course, it was impossible to figure this out in a short period of time. Chu Nan paused for a moment. When he saw that Azalu did not have the intention to attack, he rushed forward and threw another punch.This time, Chu Nan did not bother with so many tricks. Instead, he faced Azalu\u2019s counterattack with a punch.Bang!\u2018The two fists collided, emitting a muffled bang, causing the audience watching the battle to be unable to help but exclaim.Chu Nan quickly pulled back and circulated the Nine Revolutions Technique again. He pulled out a trace of Internal Breath and inserted it into his right fist, neutralizing the trace of soft Internal Breath that Azalu had penetrated through when their fists collided.Looking at Azalu who was still maintaining his poker face, Chu Nan was even more puzzled.\u2018What was wrong with this guy?In the punch just now, Chu Nan could very accurately sense that the force contained in Azalu\u2019s counterattack was as high as 393.489841 kilograms.If measured by the level of an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist, this force was already quite good, enough to be compared to most third-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artists or even fourth-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artists.However, this punch still did not contain Internal Breath, causing the force of the punch to be far inferior to any Internal Breath Martial Artist that Chu Nan had previously fought.However, that trace of soft Internal Breath still seeped through his fist.If he did not take precautions, Chu Nan was certain that even if it was only a trace of soft and gentle Internal Breath, it was enough to destroy the meridians in his body and greatly affect his combat strength.The problem was that although this guy could clearly mobilize his Internal Breath, he did not have to directly defeat Chu Nan with his fist and had to rely on such a slow infiltration method?\u201cWhat cultivation method is this?\u201d Chu Nan thought for a moment and could not help but ask.Azalu glanced at Chu Nan with an expressionless face.\u201cYou\u2019re really unwilling to say?\u201d Chu Nan coldly snorted and stepped forward with his left foot. He threw another Shooting Horse Rush Fist.\u201cSince you\u2019re unwilling to say, I\u2019ll find out myself!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Please pay attention to the Federation\u2019s Information Martial Arts World Channel at any time.\u201dSeeing that the signal light representing the live broadcast had been turned off, Yang Xirui heaved a sigh of relief.This was the first time she had served as an external host since she had entered the federation\u2019s largest information desk in the Earth\u2019s federation. She did not expect that she would be directly responsible for this highly anticipated West Cloud Martial Artist Competition.To her, this was both an extremely great challenge but also an immense opportunity. Therefore, she had been very serious from the beginning. She had gathered all kinds of information regarding this martial arts competition in many aspects, hoping that she would not reveal any flaws when presiding over the external scene.The two consecutive days of live broadcasts should have been perfect so far without any mistakes. Moreover, she had also performed very well in front of the camera and received unanimous praise from her superiors.If she had to state a problem\u2026 then she could only recall the embarrassing scene during the live broadcast yesterday\u2026When she recalled the situation of that young martial artist kicking his opponent\u2019s lower body yesterday, Yang Xirui could not help but blush.She was only in her early twenties this year. Due to work and personality reasons, she had never even had a boyfriend. When she suddenly saw such a scene, she could not help but feel a little awkward.If not for her professionalism and quick reaction, a live broadcast accident would have happened yesterday.\u201cThat young martial artist clearly looks quite delicate and cute. Why is his foot so ruthless?\u201dThe face of the young martial artist Yang Xirui saw yesterday flashed through her mind. Then, she shook her head and shook off this unrelated thought before focusing her attention on the surrounding arena.As a reporter at the scene of the battle, she needed to dig up enough news at any time to let the relevant news report.After walking for a while, a muffled bang sounded from the left.Hearing this voice, Yang Xirui raised his eyebrows.Although she was not a martial artist, in order to report this martial arts competition, she had naturally studied martial arts.This voice sounded like two martial artists were fighting with their full strength, which was why there was such a huge muffled sound like two boulders collidingBang!Another sound was heard.Yang Xirui did not have the time to think carefully. With a wave of her hand, she walked towards the direction of the voice with her two assistants.Bang!Bang!In the arena on the left, muffled sounds could be heard.The closer she was, the more terrifying this commotion sounded.One had to know that this was the venue of the Under-20 Competition. The participants were all young martial artists below the age of 20.Such young martial artists fighting each other could actually make such shocking sounds. It could be seen that the strength of the two was extraordinary.Yang Xirui finally squeezed to the side of the arena with the assistant. When she looked up, she was stunned.At this moment, in the arena, the young martial artist who flew out from the right and punched his opponent was actually the young martial artist who had appeared on her screen yesterday and kicked the opponent\u2019s lower body!Bang!Chu Nan threw a punch, and Azalu received it without any hesitation.The two fists collided ruthlessly, causing another huge muffled sound.This time, Chu Nan did not withdraw his body but retracted his right fist. He twisted his body to the right and threw his left fist.Sitting Horse Stab Fist.Bang!Azalu\u2019s reaction was also abnormally fast. Although it was still inferior to Chu Nan\u2019s abnormally accurate punch with the support of his powerful data ability, he still had time to raise his right arm and forcefully block Chu Nan\u2019s punch.Bang!The physical strength mobilized by the Sitting Horse Stab Fist was the weakest move in the first move of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist. Therefore, the force attached to Chu Nan\u2019s punch was only 338.738456 kilograms, but the power was actually not great.However, at the same time that Chu Nan threw his punch, an Internal Breath surged and attached to his fist, causing the force of the punch to suddenly increase to more than 500 kilograms!Azalu and Chu Nan had already fought many times. He was originally used to the strength of Chu Nan\u2019s punch, but he did not expect that his punch would suddenly be imbued with Internal Breath, causing the strength to increase greatly.In the end, after Chu Nan punched Azalu\u2019s right arm, the powerful force that far exceeded his expectations shook his body and he involuntarily took a step back.This was the first time Azalu had been forced to move since the battle began.After taking a step back, the expression on Azalu\u2019s poker face changed slightly. His body instantly sank and his left arm moved forward, completely wary of Chu Nan\u2019s pursuit.However, Chu Nan unexpectedly did not pursue him. Instead, he took two steps back and stared at his left fist with a puzzled expression.\u201cWhat\u2019s this guy doing?\u201d Azalu felt a little strange.In fact, after the two of them fought, Azalu was much more puzzled than Chu Nan.Azalu was a young genius martial artist with a special inheritance in the Famaal Chief Alliance. He was only 19 years old this year and was already an outstanding fourth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist. Coupled with his extremely special Internal Breath cultivation method, his true strength was actually enough to fight low-level Internal Breath Martial Artists.He had come to participate in the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition this time to become the champion of the Under-20 category.However, he did not expect that he would encounter a troublesome opponent like Chu Nan in the fifth round.No matter how one looked at it, Chu Nan was only a low-level Overlord Body Martial Artist. In terms of body refinement, he was already inferior to Azalu.Moreover, from the previous battle, he had not grasped any special internal cultivation method inheritance. Logically speaking, he was far from being Azalu\u2019s match.However, since the battle began, Chu Nan had relied on his abnormally outstanding fist technique that even shocked Azalu to completely suppress him from the beginning to the end, causing him to be constantly on the passive side.The characteristics of Azalu\u2019s martial arts technique were originally skilled in finding the flaws of the enemy in his sturdy defense to counterattack. However, after every attack, Chu Nan would always complement it with extremely sharp continuous attacks. Moreover, every attack was nearly perfect. All his actions were just right, causing Azalu to not even find a flaw.This was the first time Azalu had encountered such a situation since he started practicing martial arts.What made him feel even more strange was that although Chu Nan had clearly not been able to mobilize his Internal Breath in the fist technique, the punch just now contained an extremely obvious trace of special Internal Breath.It was also because of this that Chu Nan\u2019s punch could pierce through the Internal Breath defense network set up by Azalu\u2019s Coiling Silk Cultivation Technique and force him to take a step back.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that there was such an unexpected genius among the young martial artists of the Earth Federation.\u201dAzalu glanced at Chu Nan who was frowning as if he was thinking about something and put down the contempt in his heart. Although his expression still did not change, an intense battle intent had already ignited in his eyes..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - So It\u2019s That SimplePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosChu Nan was thinking of a very important question.\u2018When he repelled Azalu with a punch just now, it was actually the first time he had deliberately circulated the Nine Revolutions Technique to mobilize his Internal Breath in battle. It was originally a small experiment, but he did not expect it to produce a result that surprised him.The reason why he circulated the Nine Revolutions Technique at the same time was mainly to guard against Azalu\u2019s special soft Internal Breath counterattack.In the previous battle, every time Chu Nan struck Azalu, he would always be counterattacked by the extremely special soft Internal Breath on his body. As a result, Chu Nan was forced to retreat every time they fought and use his Nine Revolutions Technique to mobilize his Internal Breath to resolve thesituation.After trying this a few times, Chu Nan immediately changed his strategy. Before he threw the punch, he used the Nine Revolutions Technique to mobilize his Internal Breath.With his powerful data ability, he could do it extremely precisely. When the fist struck Azalu, his Internal Breath happened to circulate to the meridians near the fist along with the cultivation of the Nine Revolutions Technique.This way, even if he struck Azalu or fought him, he would still be counterattacked by the soft Internal Breath. However, because he had set up his Internal Breath in advance, he could resolve it immediately and allow Chu Nan to attack next.Initially, Chu Nan was still not skilled. After one or two attacks, his Internal Breath could not be sustained, so he could only retreat to the side and circulate the Nine Revolutions Technique again.After experimenting a few more times, Chu Nan relied on his powerful data capturing ability to quickly master the pattern and quickly became proficient.Before he threw that punch earlier, he had actually already sensed that his Internal Breath was insufficient and planned to punch out. He retreated again and used the Nine Revolutions Technique to replenish himself.However, Azalu happened to reveal a flaw in that strike just now. Chu Nan saw the opportunity and naturally followed up with the Sitting Horse Stab Fist.He had originally thought that after punching out, he would definitely suffer Azalu\u2019s soft Internal Breath counterattack again. However, he did not expect that as soon as his fist reached out, an Internal Breath would naturally appear in his dantian and flow into his left fist.Not only did the punch with Internal Breath increase in strength, but it also shattered Azalu\u2019s defense, forcing him to take the first step back.Chu Nan carefully recalled the situation when he used the Sitting Horse Stab Fist earlier and confirmed that it was slightly different from when he was practicing his fist and fighting others.As for the specific difference, it was probably because he had taken the initiative to use the Nine Revolutions Technique to mobilize his Internal Breath in battle and make the trajectory of his Internal Breath circulation coincide with the trajectory of his punch.\u201cVery good. I\u2019ll know when I try again.\u201dChu Nan slapped his left palm and right fist hard and put down the confusion in his heart. He focused his gaze on the serious-looking Azalu and took a step forward.As he stepped out, Chu Nan had already used the Nine Revolutions Technique at the same time. The Internal Breath in his dantian was mobilized and quickly circulated in his body according to the appearance when he usually cultivated the Nine Revolutions Technique.He took another step forward.Chu Nan started to adjust his entire body\u2019s posture. He tilted his body slightly, clenched his left palm in front of him, and curled his right fist into his waist.This was the last step.Chu Nan took a step forward with his right foot and his body quickly rushed forward. His right fist quickly stretched out from his waist.Shooting Horse Rush Fist!Under Chu Nan\u2019s precise control, an Internal Breath flowed into the meridians of the right half of his body, flowed into his right arm, and finally entered his right fist.A ball of light erupted from Azalu\u2019s eyes. He roared and his body sank like a small mountain. When Chu Nan\u2019s punch arrived, he also received it.In this confrontation, Chu Nan did not change his move. His right fist collided with Azalu\u2019s counterattack without any tricks.Boom!An intense explosion sounded between the two of them. A wave of air burst out from the point where their fists collided, blowing up the dust in the martial arts arena and causing their hair to flutter.The audience gathered at the side were shocked by the loud sound.\u2018Were the two people on the stage really only low-level martial artists below the age of 20 and not even at the Internal Breath realm?Chu Nan and Azalu\u2019s bodies swayed at the same time and they could not help but take a step back.\u201cGreat!\u201dChu Nan laughed and raised his fist again. Without stopping, he threw another punch.In this punch, he used the Nine Revolutions Technique again and mobilized his Internal Breath.Azalu did not make a sound and also threw a punch.Boom!Feeling that because he had Internal Breath on his fist, the force was even higher than the previous punch by 3%, Chu Nan was overjoyed.He had successfully mobilized his Internal Breath in his fist twice in a row, which was enough to prove that his thoughts were correct.\u201cSo it\u2019s that simple!\u201dHe had obtained a possible solution to the problem that had troubled him for a few days by accident. It immediately made Chu Nan feel extremely satisfied. Without any hesitation, he continuously used the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist Technique.First punch! Sitting Horse Rush Fist!The Internal Breath flowed into his meridians along the trajectory of the Nine Revolutions Technique. It happened to coincide with the trajectory of this punch and flowed smoothly into the tip of the fist.Second punch! Retreating Horse Cup Fist!He retreated and his Internal Breath circulated back. It quickly circulated in his body according to the usual cultivation trajectory and flowed out with the punch.Third punch! Shooting Horse Hook Fist!His body moved and his left fist shot past the left rib. His Internal Breath happened to pass through the most important meridians in his chest. Chu Nan\u2019s twisting speed was faster and his punches were faster.Then, his Internal Breath flowed into his left arm and completely fused with the left fist that was thrown upwards.Fourth punch! Sitting Horse Stab Fist!Under Chu Nan\u2019s continuous attacks, Azalu was forced to retreat step by step. In the end, he retreated to the edge of the venue.Seeing that he could not retreat, Azalu grunted and did not hold back anymore. He took a step forward and took the opportunity when Chu Nan had just retracted his punch to punch his lower abdomen.Be it the timing, angle, or target, this strike was extremely exquisite. However, he did not plan to fight Chu Nan head-on. Instead, he wanted to counterattack with this punch and take the initiative.However, before Chu Nan punched, he had already calculated all the possible reactions of Azalu.Seeing that it was the first time he had taken the initiative to counterattack, Chu Nan chuckled and his body suddenly sank.Azalu suddenly lost track of Chu Nan. Just as he cried out in his heart, he felt something kick his calf. The powerful force instantly made him lose his balance and he fell back.Bang!Azalu\u2019s body fell to the ground and firmly smashed into the ground outside the arena.\u2018There was dead silence around the venue.Be it Chu Nan or Azalu, they had both displayed strength that far exceeded ordinary Overlord Body Martial Artists in this competition, causing the audience to watch in excitement. However, they did not expect that it would end with such a simple and ordinary action. It really felt a little lackluster.The referee was stunned for a moment before he loudly announced Chu Nan\u2019s victory.Chu Nan arrived at the edge of the venue and lowered his head to look at Azalu who was still lying on the ground. He saw that the latter had widened his eyes and had an unwilling expression.\u201cHmph.\u201d Azalu ignored Chu Nan\u2019s outstretched hand and jumped up before turning around to leave.\u201cWhy are you leaving just like that? I still wanted to thank you properly\u2026\u201dLooking at Azalu\u2019s back figure that instantly disappeared into the crowd, Chu Nan shrugged and jumped out of the arena.He had just taken two steps when a young and beautiful girl suddenly squeezed out from the crowd and rushed to Chu Nan.\u201cHello, I\u2019ma reporter from the federation, Yang Xirui. May I interview you?\u201dChu Nan glanced at her in surprise and his gaze swept past the other two assistants holding equipment behind her. He thought for a moment and shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have something on.\u201dWithout waiting for Yang Xirui to say anything, he kicked his feet and disappeared into the crowd like a loach.Yang Xirui only felt a blur before Chu Nan disappeared and could not help but be stunned.After a while, she gritted her teeth.\u201cHmph! In any case, you still have to continue participating. I don\u2019t believe you can escape!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Therefore, it was naturally not a problem for him to only have two broken legs today.However, compared to being kicked by Chu Nan previously, although the injuries Luo Li received were much lighter, the consequences were much more serious.Luo Guangfu was silent for a moment before suddenly asking Luo Yuntong in a low voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s the reaction from Mu Yutong?\u201dLuo Yuntong raised his head and glanced at his older brother. Of course, he understood the meaning of his question.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Big Brother. After Liter was injured, Mu Yutong quickly sent people over to comfort him. He even said that Li\u2019er was unexpectedly defeated this time. The opponent was really too unexpected, and Lier\u2019s strength still obtained approval.\u201d\u201cAcknowledged?\u201d Luo Guangfu raised his eyebrows and sneered, \u201cCould it be that Li\u2018er\u2019s injury made Mu Yutong agree?\u201dLuo Yuntong shook his head and suddenly laughed.\u201cAlthough Mu Yutong still did not agree to take Lier as his disciple, from his eldest disciple, Zheng Yuanlin, it can be heard that he has relaxed the cooperation agreement proposed by our Luo family previously.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Luo Guangfu\u2019s expression changed, and a trace of joy appeared on his face, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then it\u2019s satisfying. What did Zheng Yuanlin say?\u201d\u201cZheng Yuanlin told me what Mu Yutong meant. He said\u2026\u201dLuo Yuntong suddenly closed his mouth. Luo Guangfu also restrained his expression at the same time and became a gloomy and angry expression again. The two of them turned to look at the door of the room.A moment later, the door was pushed open and West Cloud Academy\u2019s Dean Feng Tianlin walked in.Seeing Luo Guangfu and the other two, Feng Tianlin raised his hand and waved. He glanced at Luo Li in the nutrition capsule and nodded, \u201cHis recovery is not bad. At this rate, he\u2019ll probably recover completely in less than three days.\u201d\u201cThe martial arts competition will be over in three days,\u201d Luo Guangfu said coldly.Feng Tianlin sighed, \u201cThis can\u2019t be helped. Luo Li\u2019s luck is bad this time. He probably encountered one of the few martial artists who can fight for the championship in this competition. With his strength\u2026\u201d1At this point, Feng Tianlin shook his head and did not continue.Luo Guangtu raised his eyebrows, \u201cWhat? Dean Feng, you mean that with Ler\u2019s strength, he\u2019s originally not qualified to fight for the championship?\u201dContrary to Luo Guangfu and Luo Yuntong\u2019s expectations, Feng Tianlin actually did not avoid this question. Instead, he looked straight into Luo Guangfu\u2019s eyes and nodded seriously.\u201cYes.\u201dThe two of them were shocked. Luo Yuntong could not help but say, \u201cDean, no matter what, Luo Liisa fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist. You say that he doesn\u2019t even have the qualifications to fight for the championship under the age of 20. Isn\u2019t that too much?\u201dFeng Tianlin sneered without holding back. He took out a piece of paper from his bosom and handed it to the two of them.\u201cYou\u2019ll know after reading this report.\u201dLuo Guangfu and Lu Zhou looked at each other and took the report. After reading it carefully, the surprise on their faces became evident.\u201cThere are actually a total of 33 participating martial artists who have been initially judged to be Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists? What the heck! When did the Earth Federation have so many young genius martial artists?\u201d Luo Yuntong could not help but shout.\u201cThis is only the initial judgment. Perhaps there are even more participating martial artists who have the strength of an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist. Because the opponents they encountered previously were too weak, they did not completely show their strength.\u201d Feng Tianlin sighed andcontinued, \u201cSpeaking of which, our West Cloud Academy has lost all our face this time.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Luo Guangfu looked at Luo Yuntong.Luo Yuntong smiled awkwardly and glanced at Feng Tianlin. Seeing that he did not show any special reaction, he coughed lightly and explained, \u201cThis time, our West Cloud Academy has chosen 15 students to participate in the competition. Leaving the adult category aside, eleven of them participated inthe group competition below the age of 20, but now\u2026 only two students have not been eliminated.\u201d\u201cThere are only two left?\u201d Even with Luo Guangfu\u2019s shrewdness, he could not help but reveal a shocked expression, \u201cThis is too few. Who are the remaining two?\u201dBefore Luo Yuntong could answer, his expression suddenly changed and he asked with a frown, \u201cCould one of them be that Chu Nan?\u201dLuo Yuntong smiled bitterly and nodded, \u201cYes. Apart from Chu Nan, there\u2019s also another person who has passed the sixth round. He\u2019s Dean Feng\u2019s second son, Feng Xiao.\u201d\u201cHe was only lucky and did not encounter a true expert.\u201d Feng Tianlin shook his head expressionlessly, \u201cI specially checked Chu Nan\u2019s results. He has not encountered any powerful opponents so far, so his current results are also not worth being happy about. According to the competition schedule, he andXiao\u2019er will both encounter opponents who are evaluated as Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists tomorrow. If nothing unexpected happens, the two of them will be eliminated.\u201dLuo Yuntong\u2019s expression dimmed. \u201cThen our academy will be completely wiped out in this competition\u2026\u201dLuo Guangfu nodded lightly.The West Cloud Academy was called the number one martial arts academy on West Cloud Planet. The fifteen students specially chosen to participate this time were not even able to enter the final stage. If word got out, it would undoubtedly be a huge blow to the reputation of the West Cloud Academy. Itwas no wonder that Feng Tianlin was in a bad mood.Luo Guangfu pondered for a moment before suddenly having a thought.\u201cI feel that\u2026 this Chu Nan might create a miracle\u2026\u201dFeng Tianlin and Luo Yuntong looked at him in surprise.Feng Tianlin was greatly surprised. A few days ago, Luo Guangfu still hated Chu Nan, so why did he sound like he thought very highly of it now?Could it be that because Chu Nan had defeated Luo Li, a fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist, he could not help but think highly of him?Luo Yuntong thought of another matter.In order to take revenge on Luo Li for being heavily injured by Chu Nan, the Luo family had sent Luo Jie out but he had also returned in low spirits.Although Luo Jie had not spoken much about the process after he returned, from his appearance and the situation revealed by the other followers, he had probably suffered a considerable loss under Chu Nan.\u2018When he recalled how Luo Li had used his methods to find Lu Mingcheng who planned to obstruct Chu Nan from obtaining the spot in the martial arts competition but was still defeated by him, Luo Yuntong was suddenly shocked.That\u2019s right, although this kid called Chu Nan looked to be only a low-level Overlord Body Martial Artist on the surface, his actual performance had clearly surpassed theirs. He could even make Luo Jie and Lu Mingcheng, these two low-level Internal Breath Martial Artists, unable to gain victory.Although this did not prove that Chu Nan\u2019s true strength had already surpassed ordinary low-level Internal Breath Martial Artists, it could at least prove that his strength was far from being easily measured on the surface.Therefore, Luo Guangfu was right.This Chu Nan might really create a miracle.When he thought of this, Luo Yuntong actually felt a trace of anticipation and excitement in his heart..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - Internal Breath Merging with the Fist TechniquePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosBang!A muffled explosion sounded in a remote forest of West Cloud Academy.Chu Nan retracted his fist and nodded in satisfaction.The experience he had obtained in the battle with Azalu during the day was indeed useful.After returning to the academy, he repeated his daytime experience and used the Nine Revolutions Technique to mobilize his Internal Breath while practicing his fist. As expected, he could successfully fuse his Internal Breath into his fist and greatly increase the strength of his punch.In fact, he had deliberately not adopted a perfect posture in this punch just now and displayed the strongest physical strength that this Sitting Horse Rush Fist could unleash. However, after complementing with his Internal Breath, the force attached to this punch was still as high as 623.371892 kilograms.One had to know that even in the most perfect state when he was practicing his fist, the maximum force attached to the Sitting Horse Rush Fist was only 473.739238 kilograms.Chu Nan did not continue practicing, Instead, he closed his eyes and carefully felt the various subtle changes in his body when he threw the punch.After a moment, his body sank slightly, and he threw another Sitting Horse Rush Fist.Halfway through his punch, Chu Nan\u2019s face suddenly flushed red. He opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood. His arm instantly became sore and weak as his fist hung down.He took a deep breath and quickly calmed his suddenly chaotic and rapid breathing.In this punch, although he had also used the Nine Revolutions Cultivation Technique to mobilize his Internal Breath, he did not deliberately match this punch. As a result, at the same time he threw the punch, the flow of his Internal Breath in his meridians happened to conflict with the muscles mobilizedby the punch, immediately causing the blood in his body to surge, almost turning into the legendary Qi Deviation.It took Chu Nan a long time to calm his Internal Breath down. He reached out to wipe the blood from the corner of his mouth and smiled self-deprecatingly.He really wanted to run before he could even walk.Now, he had only just discovered a trace of pattern in casually mobilizing his Internal Breath in the battle and wanted to act recklessly. It was simply an act of courting death.However, this was also because of the help of a powerful analytic ability that allowed him to sense every data in his body in an extremely pleasant surprise. He could adjust it in time before an accident happened.Most importantly, through this experiment, he confirmed his guess again.The mobilization of Internal Breath could only unleash its power perfectly when combined with his body\u2019s movements. Otherwise, he would be asking for trouble.After confirming this, Chu Nan sat down and circulated the Nine Revolutions Technique. As he used his Internal Breath according to his usual cultivation method, he carefully comprehended the trajectory of the Internal Breath\u2019s flow in the various meridians in his body.In fact, he had already completed these tasks very well when he broke through the third level of the Nine Revolutions Technique. Now, he was only matching the three stances and twelve moves of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist that he had simulated in his mind to use his Internal Breath.After repeating this process over and over again, while the trace of meridian injuries Chu Nan had received from his rash experiment had recovered, he had also further confirmed the details of the combination of the fist technique and Internal Breath.Chu Nan exerted strength in his legs and jumped up from the ground before throwing a punch without any hesitation.Bang!The force of his fist, which contained Internal Breath, was as high as 693.739231 kilograms. He easily produced a muffled air explosion sound.Bang!Another punch. The force had already exceeded 700 kilograms.Bang!Another punch.Soon, Chu Nan had already practiced the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist Technique\u2019s three stances and twelve moves. Other than the Retreating Horse Hook Fist and Shooting Horse Cup Fist, the other ten punches had successfully mobilized his Internal Breath, causing a series of explosions in the forest.Chu Nan paused for a moment and connected the actions of the Retreating Horse Hook Fist and Shooting Horse Cup Fist in his mind with the Nine Revolutions Technique to mobilize the meridians of his Internal Breath. After thinking carefully for a moment, he threw a punch.With his incomparably powerful data ability, he had only tested it less than ten times before successfully finding the trajectory of the Internal Breath circulation path and meridians combined with these two moves to mobilize his Internal Breath in these two moves.\u201cvery good.\u201dChu Nan nodded and threw another punch.Not long after, he completely practiced the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist.This time, he successfully mobilized his Internal Breath in a total of three stances and twelve moves.However, it was different from the previous time when he successfully mobilized his Internal Breath. This time, Chu Nan did not feel any mysterious and indescribable feeling. Instead, he clearly knew how he successfully mobilized his Internal Breath and fused it into his fist move.He did not like that so-called mysterious and indescribable state, because this meant that he actually did not understand it at all.After thinking for a moment, he casually threw a punch, but he did not succeed in mobilizing his Internal Breath to cooperate.\u201cAs expected.\u201dChu Nan nodded. He knew that the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist was indeed an extremely special fist technique. This was why he could easily use the Nine Revolutions Technique to mobilize his Internal Breath and fuse it. If he only casually threw a punch, it would be very difficult for his physical body to fusewith his Internal Breath, so he naturally could not mobilize his Internal Breath to assist.If he wanted to casually mobilize his Internal Breath, only if it was deep enough could he at least reach the standard of an Internal Breath Martial Artist.On the other hand, even Internal Breath Martial Artists needed a powerful martial technique to unleash their Internal Breath to the greatest extent. Similarly, a casual punch could not satisfy the requirements.\u2018When he thought of this, Chu Nan could not help but laugh.The 5,000 federation coins he had spent at the martial artist exchange were truly worth it!After recalling the process of practicing his fist a few times, Chu Nan posed again and threw a punch.Successfully mobilizing his Internal Breath was only the first step. The work he needed to complete next was the same as when he broke through the third level of the Nine Revolutions Technique. It was to undergo more exquisite and precise modifications, allowing the Internal Breath that could be fusedinto the fist technique to be faster and stronger.He threw a Sitting Horse Rush Fist, but the strength was about 2 kilograms lower than the previous punch.Chu Nan shook his head. He knew that the experiment of modifying one of the meridians when mobilizing his Internal Breath had failed.He considered for a moment and threw another Sitting Horse Rush Fist.The strength of this punch was 3.739619 kilograms more than the previous one!Chu Nan was overjoyed and modified according to this foundation again. He did not expect the force to decrease by 7 kilograms at the next try.He was not discouraged and threw another Sitting Horse Rush Fist.The time when he modified the cultivation method of the Nine Revolutions Technique had already accumulated enough experience.If he wanted to change the martial technique to a martial technique that was most suitable for him, he needed a long period of training and experimentation. It was definitely not something that could be completed in a day.He had not even had this chance before. Now that he had finally obtained this opportunity with his powerful data ability and his own comprehension, as well as a little luck, he naturally had to grasp it well.Bang!Another punch was thrown.The force on this punch was actually as high as 712.739691 kilograms! It had increased by more than 3%!Chu Nan was overjoyed. Just as he was about to punch again, he suddenly heard a shout from behind.\u201cGood fist technique! Chu Nan, watch my palm!\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, a special palm wind assaulted him from behind..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I met you here. Come, Chu Nan, cut the crap. Let\u2019s continue.\u201dChu Nan could not help but laugh and shake his head.Dong Fang that guy often said that he had already become a martial arts fanatic these few days. However, in comparison, this unknown senior was probably the true martial arts fanatic.\u201cCoincidentally, I also have a small breakthrough and want to find someone to test my fist. Senior, you came at the right time. Watch my fist!\u201dBoth sides understood each other, so Chu Nan did not waste any time. He took a step forward and threw a Shooting Horse Rush Fist.With his powerful data ability, this punch perfectly replicated the best punch he had ever used when he was practicing his fist. Be it the trajectory of his Internal Breath, the muscles in his entire body, or the circulation of his muscles, they were all the same. However, Chu Nan was not skilled enough. Thetiming of his Internal Breath circulating was less than half a second, causing the force to instantly weaken by more than 10 kilograms.However, the force of this punch was still as high as 701.732832 kilograms. When it was thrown, the air in the dark forest exploded with a terrifying momentum.The unknown senior raised his eyebrows and shouted, \u201cGood.\u201dWithout dodging, he slapped out.Bang!Chu Nan heavily punched the palm of an unknown senior. He felt that the recoil from the other party\u2019s palm was as high as 783.239101 kilograms. It was at least 10% stronger than any palm strike he had used previously.The two of them took a step back at the same time. Chu Nan said in surprise, \u201cSenior, your Internal Breath is much stronger than before. This can\u2019t be considered a small breakthrough, right?\u201dThe unknown senior laughed, \u201cSame to you. Chu Nan, from your two punches, you seem to have found the so-called feeling?\u201dChu Nan smiled and shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not a feeling, but I roughly found a way to resolve the problem and was about to ask you to help verify it.\u201d\u201cAlright, I like to help people the most. Come, let\u2019s spar again.\u201dAfter saying this, the unknown senior did not greet him. He leaned over and slapped his palm.Chu Nan turned around and punched back, bringing his Internal Breath with him again.Bang!Bang!Bang!A series of air explosions and the muffled sounds of fists colliding sounded in the forest.The two of them punched and slapped each other, and in an instant, they had already exchanged more than a hundred moves.Initially, the unknown senior seemed to have restrained himself. Later on, he discovered that Chu Nan\u2019s every punch contained Internal Breath. Clearly, he had really \u2018found the feeling\u2019 and no longer had any reservations. He struck out palm after palm continuously and continuously without any gaps. Hehad already used the \u2018Heavenly Swim Eight Trigrams Palm\u2019 that he had unintentionally obtained and was extremely proficient in.Coupled with the special Internal Breath produced by the \u201cDead Tree Heart Sutra\u201d he had cultivated since he was young, the power of this palm technique was extraordinary. Even second-stage Internal Breath Martial Artists at the same level as him would most likely only be exhausted from parrying.However, Chu Nan could abnormally accurately find his true palm in his palm shadows every time and punch it.After the two of them clashed, although Chu Nan\u2019s Internal Breath was not as deep as his, the strength he could unleash was extremely powerful. When combined, it was not much weaker than his palm.In the battle that lasted for nearly ten minutes, although Chu Nan was slightly passive, he was not at a disadvantage. The two of them were evenly matched.\u2018When he sparred with Chu Nan last time, he had already discovered the latter\u2019s special trait.He did not expect that Chu Nan would have improved after not seeing him for a few days.This was the first time he had encountered a special opponent like Chu Nan. The more he fought, the more excited he became. He felt that it was even more satisfying than sparring with the experts of the same grade.The intense battle between the two sides lasted for about ten minutes before another fist and palm collided. An unknown senior suddenly jumped back and raised his hand to signal for Chu Nan to stop.Chu Nan stopped in confusion and raised his eyebrows to look at him in doubt.He was just feeling that he was getting more and more into his state and was getting more and more skilled in mobilizing the Internal Breath in his body, and the mobilization of his Internal Breath was also getting stronger and stronger. Following that, the force on his fist became stronger and stronger.Why did this senior suddenly stop?The unknown senior was silent for a moment. When he raised his head to look at Chu Nan, his expression was strange under the moonlight.\u201cHeh, Chu Nan, you\u2019re not an Internal Breath Martial Artist, right?\u201dChu Nan was stunned and nodded. \u201cYes, I am still far away from the Internal Breath Realm.\u201d\u201csee that the degree of tempering of your physical body is probably still at the low-level Overlord Body Realm. However, you can use Internal Breath in your fist. I believe the Internal Breath cultivation method you cultivate must be very special.\u201dChu Nan thought for a moment and felt that the Nine Revolutions Cultivation Technique was not a very special internal cultivation method, nor was it an internal cultivation method that many martial artists treated as a treasure and would not easily expose. Therefore, he told the truth.\u201cNine Revolutions Cultivation Technique?\u201d The unknown senior was even more surprised, \u201cYou can actually cultivate this cultivation method to this extent. Your talent is indeed not bad.\u201dChu Nan smiled bitterly.Before obtaining an extremely powerful data ability, he had cultivated the Nine Revolutions Technique for more than ten years and had only stopped at the second level, causing his body to be insufficient in tempering. He could not even surpass the initial-stage Overlord Body realm.\u2018When he thought of this, he suddenly had a thought and simply told this senior the situation of his cultivation.This unknown senior was clearly an Internal Breath expert. If he could obtain some of his guidance, it would probably be more effective than fumbling around alone.After hearing Chu Nan\u2019s explanation, the expression of the unknown senior became even stranger.He stared at Chu Nan for a while. At first, he seemed to be very surprised, but then a smile appeared on his face. In the end, he held his stomach and laughed wildly.\u201cHaha\u2026 haha\u2026 I\u2019m dying of laughter. Chu\u2026 Chu Nan, this is what you told me last time? This is the\u2026 feeling that you can\u2019t grasp?\u201dChu Nan looked at him speechlessly.Was this funny?The unknown senior laughed for a while before gradually restraining his smile. However, he still breathed heavily and said, \u201cChu Nan, you\u2019re really an Overlord Body rookie. You know too little about the Internal Breath cultivation method.\u201dChu Nan helplessly rolled his eyes.Wasn\u2019t this nonsense? He did not have a complete family inheritance like Luo Li. All the relevant knowledge of martial techniques came from the academy\u2019s professors and personal exploration. Even the Nine Revolutions Technique was only a popular topic found on the Internet. How could he have anyprofound understanding?Perhaps it was because he saw Chu Nan\u2019s expression that the unknown senior reluctantly stopped laughing, but the smile on his face still revealed his thoughts.\u201cHmm\u2026 Chu Nan, do you know? The complete Internal Breath cultivation method is actually divided into two parts. One is used to cultivate the Internal Breath, and the other is to use the Internal Breath. The problem you\u2019re worried about and the feeling you\u2019re talking about are actually just the usagesection of the Internal Breath cultivation method.\u201djh?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let me tell you, this is actually not a profound thing because every internal cultivation method will have a complementary usage method. Otherwise, what\u2019s the use of having Internal Breath?\u201dChu Nan blinked and asked, \u201cIn other words, I\u2019ve been thinking about how to mobilize my Internal Breath for so many days?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d After giving an affirmative answer, the expression of the unknown senior suddenly changed as if he had thought of something. He asked in surprise, \u201cNo way? Chu Nan, didn\u2019t you obtain a cultivation method to use your Internal Breath? You aren\u2019t cultivating it? Are you testing and feeling ityourself?\u201dChu Nan shook his head. \u201cNo. Internal Breath cultivation methods are so rare, so I can\u2019t find any suitable cultivation methods.\u201dThe expression of the unknown senior changed and his body suddenly flashed. In a moment, he rushed to Chu Nan and grabbed him.\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201dChu Nan reflexively raised his hand to counterattack, but he heard the unknown senior shout and forcefully stopped his actions, allowing him to grab his left arm.\u201cRelax yourself, don\u2019t circulate your Internal Breath to resist. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201dAfter instructing, he grabbed Chu Nan\u2019s left wrist and a strange Internal Breath entered. A moment later, it circulated in his body before he heaved a sigh of relief and put down his arm.\u201cSenior, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Chu Nan looked at him in confusion.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d The unknown senior glared at Chu Nan, \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201dChu Nan was even more puzzled.\u201cI thought that you had obtained a special cultivation method for using Internal Breath, so you could use Internal Breath in your fist technique at the Overlord Body realm. I didn\u2019t expect that you were completely figuring it out yourself. What martial arts master do you think you are, that you can createyour own cultivation method?\u201dChu Nan was confused by his cursing. He scratched his head and asked, \u201cWhat? Is this very dangerous?\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d The unknown senior shouted angrily, \u201cWhen circulating your Internal Breath. If you\u2019re not careful, you might damage your meridians. If it\u2019s light, you can recover completely after resting for ten days or half a month. If it\u2019s heavy\u2026 Hmph, you might not be able to practice martial arts in thislife!\u201d\u201cIs it that exaggerated?\u201d Chu Nan could not help but be speechless.\u201cI\u2019s that exaggerated!\u201d The unknown senior emphasized, \u201cWhy do you think the classification of martial artists now starts from the Overlord Body Realm and then the Internal Breath Realm? Moreover, why do you think that only after reaching the Internal Breath Realm will they truly begin to casuallyuse their Internal Breath?\u201dChu Nan shook his head obediently.He only knew that these martial artists were divided into levels, but he could not understand the specifics.Seeing Chu Nan\u2019s puzzled expression, the unknown student sighed.\u201cTherefore, the bill pushed by the federation recently is correct. If we can\u2019t completely popularize the foundation of martial arts, many genius martial artists like you will probably die midway.\u201dChu Nan was stunned. How did his exploration of the cultivation method end up being linked to the recently approved Foundation Martial Skill Promotion Act?This senior\u2019s thoughts were really strange.The unknown senior was silent for a moment before he said ina serious tone, \u201cChu Nan, your talent is indeed very strong. You\u2019re actually able to successfully figure out a set of effective methods that can be used casually at the Overlord Body Realm. However, I warn you not to use it easily in the future.\u201d\u201cBecause doing this will harm my meridians?\u201d Chu Nan asked after thinking for a moment.\u201cYes.\u201d The unknown senior nodded forcefully. \u201cThe rough classification of martial artists in the Declan Empire is not only a nominal definition, but it has a practical significance. The so-called Overlord Body Realm is the process of martial artists refining and strengthening the body. This refinement andstrengthening not only refers to muscle strength, but also includes the bones and meridians. Only after being sufficiently strengthened can the meridians in the body support a sufficiently powerful Internal Breath circulation. Do you understand what I mean?\u201dChu Nan pondered for a moment and retorted with a frown, \u201cBut I\u2019ve been doing this for so long and haven\u2019t felt anything wrong.\u201dThe unknown senior looked at Chu Nan with a strange expression and smiled bitterly before shaking his head.\u201cThat\u2019s why I said that you\u2019re a genius. You clearly don\u2019t have much of an Internal Breath foundation, nor do you have any special inheritance, but you were able to figure it out on your own. It can be seen that your talent is extraordinary. If you were able to come into contact with a sufficiently powerfulinheritance from a young age, your current and future achievements would probably be extraordinary.\u201dChu Nan shrugged and spread his hands. \u201cThe reality is that I don\u2019t have it. Senior, continue to tell me the exact problem.\u201d\u201cAlright, you don\u2019t find anything wrong now. That\u2019s because your current fist technique just happens to match the circulation of your Internal Breath. However, forcefully mobilizing your Internal Breath in battle at the low-level Overlord Body realm still has an immeasurable burden on your body. If anyaccidents happen, your body will very easily be injured, and it might even be so serious that it\u2019s irreversible.\u201dChu Nan frowned slightly, \u201cBut if there\u2019s a suitable Internal Breath circulation method, there won\u2019t be a problem?\u201d\u201cIf there is, there\u2019s naturally no problem. This is because the Internal Breath cultivation method that has already taken shape has generally been verified with enough facts to prove that it\u2019s feasible and effective. However, if you fumble around by yourself like this, the accidents and danger will be muchgreater.\u201d\u201cThen where can I get a suitable Internal Breath circulation method?\u201d Chu Nan asked again.\u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d The unknown senior shook his head.\u201d You know that Internal Breath cultivation methods have always been especially rare, and it\u2019s even more difficult to circulate a suitable Internal Breath cultivation method. If you become a disciple of a Star-Grade Martial Artist like Supremacy MuYutong, it won\u2019t be a problem, but you\u2026\u201dThe unknown senior did not continue, but from his expression, it was obvious that he did not think Chu Nan had any hope.Chu Nan did not mind. In any case, Mu Yutong had already clearly expressed through Zheng Yuanlin that it was impossible to take him in as a disciple, so he did not have any hope.\u201cChu Nan, I think your talent is very good. You can\u2019t ruin your future because of a moment of anxiety.\u201d The unknown senior patted Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder with an extremely serious expression, \u201cAlthough you\u2019re only a low-level Overlord Body Martial Artist now, with your talent, as long as you cultivate stepby step, it\u2019s not impossible for you to become an expert in the future. Therefore, you must not destroy yourself because of the increase in your strength, understand?\u201dSeeing that he spoke solemnly, Chu Nan nodded, \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. You\u2019re a smart person, so I believe you will definitely understand what I mean.\u201d The unknown senior recovered his smile and patted Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder again, \u201cI hope that we can spar when I see you again.\u201dAfter saying that, the unknown senior waved his hand, tumed around, and walked away.Chu Nan watched his back disappear from the forest. After frowning and thinking for a moment, he suddenly thought of a question.After talking for a long time, he actually forgot to ask for his name again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why are you laughing so hard?\u201d Chu Nan pushed open the door and looked at Dong Fang who was holding his stomach and laughing wildly in his seat.\u201cHa\u2026 Chu Nan, you\u2019re back? Come, quickly take a look. I\u2019m dying of laughter.\u201dDong Fang pointed at the virtual screen in front of him with an overjoyed expression.Chu Nan curiously walked over and glanced at the virtual screen. He immediately spat out a mouthful of water.\u201cDamn, who did this!\u201dOn the virtual screen was a huge character projection.This person wore a green cap with a shiny red star in the middle. He was wearing a military uniform that was also green in color and had an extremely ancient and simple style. Under his feet was a pair of dark green, round, and low heel canvas shoes. He held a torch high in his right hand and his lefthand pointed forward. He put on a firm appearance, giving people the feeling that he was so uncool.However, the important thing was that this person\u2019s face was Chu Nan\u2019s.Dong Fang glanced at the extremely exciting expression on Chu Nan\u2019s face and laughed wildly again.\u201cHaha, Chu Nan, do you want to get a set of such clothes to participate in the competition? I guarantee that you\u2019ll be famous!\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201dChu Nan glared at Dong Fang in anger and operated the virtual screen. He discovered that Dong Fang was logging into an online forum. This character projection came from the most popular post on this forum.The reason why this figure\u2019s profile was Chu Nan was completely because Dong Fang had changed his profile to Chu Nan.\u201cFight for the honor of the Earth Federation?\u201d Chu Nan looked at the title of this post in shock, \u201cWhat\u2019s this nonsense?\u201d\u201cYou still don\u2019t know?\u201d Dong Fang was a little surprised before realizing, \u201cOh, right. You\u2019ve become a martial arts fanatic these few days. I\u2019m afraid you haven\u2019t cared about this information at all.\u201d\u201cTm not as free as you.\u201d Chu Nan rolled his eyes at him, \u201cTell me, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s related to the martial arts competition.\u201d Dong Fang curled his lips, \u201cYou know that there\u2019s a program called \u2018Focus News\u2019 on the Federation\u2019s Information Martial Arts World Channel, right?\u201d\u201cYes, of course. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cIn the past two days, the \u2018Focus News\u2019 program has been paying attention to this West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial artist competition. Then, a guest on the program produced a set of data today, showing that after the first three rounds of the competition, a large number of our Earth Federation participatingmartial artists have been eliminated. I feel that it\u2019s too shameful.\u201d\u201cand?\u201d\u201cThen, didn\u2019t they carry out three rounds of competition today? As soon as the competition ended, someone deliberately made a set of statistics. Can you guess the results?\u201dChu Nan shook his head and knew that this number was probably not good.As expected, Dong Fang sighed and said, \u201cThe data shows that after the six rounds of competition, among the remaining participants in the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition, the Earth Federation\u2019s martial artists only account for 23.16%. As for the groups below the age of 20 that youparticipated in, they were even worse. They accounted for less than 17%.\u201d\u201cIs it that miserable?\u201d Chu Nan did not believe it.This competition was organized by West Cloud Planet. Even if martial artists from other countries participated, they should be far inferior to the Earth Federation. How could there be only so many participating martial artists left after six rounds?\u201cI\u2019s that miserable.\u201d Dong Fang nodded. \u201cMoreover, there are also people who have analyzed the next battle and the previous battles. They have concluded that if the three rounds of the competition end tomorrow, the ratio of participating martial artists in the Earth Federation will probably decreaseagain. It might even reach a shocking extent.\u201d\u201cSo? They came up with such a title?\u201d Chu Nan pointed at the virtual screen.\u201cThat\u2019s right. To fight for the honor of our Earth Federation.\u201d Dong Fang glanced at the figure projection and was still overjoyed, \u201cI have to say that the guy who created this figure projection is really a genius. He can actually find a classic Chinese image from more than a thousand years ago to replicate. Itmust be true love.\u201dAt this point, Dong Fang paused and glanced at Chu Nan.\u201cHey, Chu Nan, are you confident in your competition tomorrow? Can you win?\u201d\u201cHow can I know that if I haven\u2019t fought yet?\u201d Chu Nan shrugged.\u201cHowever, if you\u2019re also eliminated\u2026 Not to mention nonsense like fighting for the honor of the federation, you won\u2019t be able to enter the finals like this, let alone fulfill your promise to Zheng Yuanlin.\u201d Dong Fang\u2019s expression had a trace of worry.\u201cLcan only say that I\u2019ll do my best. I can\u2019t control other things.\u201d Chu Nan sighed.This West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition had actually attracted so many experts to participate, and among them were many young experts from other countries. As a result, the difficulty of winning the championship was much higher than he had originally imagined.Chu Nan was now confident that he could defeat low-level Internal Breath Martial Artists in normal battles, but it would be difficult for him to defeat high-level Internal Breath Martial Artists.Of course, this was not a reason to give up.Chu Nan thought for a moment and ignored Dong Fang. He lay on the bed and connected to the data terminal of Martial Soul and logged in.After logging in, he habitually opened the information panel and saw another friend request.Needless to say, it was from the player, Free Flower Pistil.Every time they sent a friend request, they would add another message. This time was no exception.\u201cCoward, I won\u2019t be able to play the game for a long time in two days. If you don\u2019t add me as a friend, you won\u2019t have a chance anymore!\u201dIf it was said that Chu Nan felt very fed up when he first saw this information, he was already used to it now.\u2018When he saw this message, Chu Nan could not help but laugh.\u2018What did it have to do with him if this guy could not play the game for a long time? Why did he make it sound like it was a huge loss not to add him as a friend?Shaking his head, he was about to reject the friend request and delete this message when his heart suddenly softened. He thought for a moment and replied with a message while rejecting the friend request.\u201cWho exactly are you? Why do you have to add me as a friend?\u201dAfter doing this, Chu Nan officially entered the game. However, he did not activate the random match as usual and chose the simulation training room.A moment later, he appeared in a wide and empty room. Standing in front of him was an opponent that, although his appearance was very realistic, it was still obvious at a glance that he was a simulated opponent.This was a special service provided by the Martial Soul game. It could allow martial artists to simulate battles in the simulation training room to practice their martial techniques.With the powerful technology level of the Noctem Chamber of Commerce, the Martial Soul data access terminal could scan the specific physical data of the players in detail. Therefore, it could perfectly simulate the players\u2019 personal situation into the game and carry out battles that were almost equivalentto reality.What Chu Nan wanted to do now was to test his idea.Although that unknown senior had warned Chu Nan earlier out of kindness, he did not plan to completely agree with the senior\u2019s opinion.This was not the fault of that unknown senior because he did not know that Chu Nan had a super powerful data ability and could understand all the relevant data in his body in a very precise manner. Therefore, the problem of accidentally injuring himself in his cultivation did not exist for him.Most importantly, from the current situation, there might be opponents stronger than ordinary low-level Internal Breath Martial Artists in the martial arts competition.If he could not obtain any further advancement, he might really not even be able to enter the finals, let alone fulfill his promise to Zheng Yuanlin and obtain Mu Yutong\u2019s recommendation qualifications.There was another important reason why Chu Nan chose to enter the virtual training room of Martial Soul to practice.Martial artists originally existed to surpass the limits of the human flesh body!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - Nine Revolutions Internal BreathPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosElvy walked into the bedroom softly and threw her body heavily on the wide bed. She lay down with her face facing down, looking lazy and unwilling to move.After a while, a muffled sigh sounded from the bed.Elvy rolled over and lay back, her exquisite little face filled with melancholy that did not match her age.Today was the 25th of June on Earth. There was less than a week until the end of this semester.Tonight, her classmates held a graduation party. She was chatting with a few good friends at the party. When she thought of how they were going to go their separate ways after graduation, she could not help but cry.Now, there was still a trace of tears at the corner of her eyes, which could be seen how exaggerated her crying was.\u201cHow good would it be if everyone was still on Planet Macaw? Then, even if one was in the North Pole and the other was in the South Pole, they would at most need half a day to meet.\u201dThinking of how her best friend, Riley, had said at the gala that she was going to study in the United States of Melaita, which was more than 700 light-years away from Planet Macaw, Elvy could not help but complain.However, she knew that this was impossible.Ever since it was discovered by the civilian exploration fleet of the Declan Empire more than 700 years ago, the Earth Federation had quickly jumped into the era of the Great Galaxy. It had long passed the backward stage of still remaining as a single planet in the galaxy.Now, the people of the Earth Federation were already accustomed to leaving the planet they lived on and heading for dozens of light-years, hundreds, or even thousands of light-years away.It was actually normal for someone like Riley to study in the United States of Melaita more than 700 light-years away.After all, compared to an ancient country in the Milky Way like the United States of Melaita, the Earth Federation was undoubtedly still a rookie. If one could study there, they could leam a lot of advanced knowledge. It would be extremely helpful to their future work and life.If not for Elvy\u2019s special family situation, she might have been sent to an advanced country outside the Earth Federation to study after graduation. She was no different from Riley.\u201cSeriously, even if you want to study abroad, can\u2019t you wait until I finish high school before going out?\u201dElvy mumbled and flipped over. She saw the game data of Martial Soul on the table beside her bed and the access terminal. She thought for a moment and jumped up.\u201cFortunately, there\u2019s the Milky Way Network. Otherwise, if I want to see them in the future, I can only wait for their holidays.\u201dThinking of this, a trace of anger appeared on Elvy\u2019s small face as she waved her fists forcefully.\u201cHmph! It\u2019s all that damned guy\u2019s fault for preventing me from obtaining 30 consecutive wins. Otherwise, I could properly show off in front of them tonight.\u201dElvy angrily entered Martial Soul. As soon as she logged in, she saw an additional message in the system notification bar.\u201cThis coward rejected me again.\u201dAs expected, the additional message was from Virgin 001 rejecting Elvy\u2019s friend request.However, this time, it was different from the previous few times. There was also a message behind the rejection.Seeing this, Elvy\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cHaha, coward, you\u2019re finally willing to answer me!\u201dBoom!Seeing that the training dummy in front of him had been shattered by his punch, Chu Nan withdrew his fist and waved his hand.Martial Soul could perfectly simulate the physical condition of the human body and also perfectly simulate the specific physical changes in battle. Coupled with Chu Nan\u2019s powerful data ability, it could allow him to abnormally understand the various aspects of his body.In this punch just now, he had undoubtedly successfully mobilized his Internal Breath. Moreover, the Internal Breath contained in it was even thicker than when he was sparring with that unknown senior.This was one of the results of his training after entering Martial Soul.Through his in-depth communication with that unknown senior, Chu Nan knew that if he wanted to mobilize his Internal Breath freely in battle, he had to complement a circulation method.Chu Nan did not have any ready-made solutions to this. When Su Xuansheng left behind the Nine Revolutions Technique back then, he only released the first to seventh level Internal Breath cultivation method. He did not include any other related cultivation methods, nor was there any circulationmethod given.As for the eighth and ninth levels, even Su Xuansheng was unable to successfully break through, so there was naturally no need to mention anything.Chu Nan did not obtain any other inheritance that allowed him to freely mobilize the Internal Breath cultivated by the Nine Revolutions Technique. In theory, he could only cultivate his Internal Breath to a certain extent and successfully break through to the Internal Breath Realm before he could attemptto mobilize his Internal Breath in battle.However, according to that unknown senior, even if an Internal Breath Martial Artist wanted to successfully do this, it was extremely difficult without a mature Internal Breath circulation method to complement their cultivation method. Moreover, it might cause danger and cause damage to their body.However, this did not mean that Chu Nan had no choice.Through his previous understanding, Chu Nan had basically grasped the pattern of using the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist together with the Nine Revolutions Technique to mobilize his Internal Breath.After a series of attempts in the Martial Soul virtual training ground, Chu Nan could already successfully mobilize his Internal Breath in every move of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist.Moreover, as his proficiency increased, and as he continuously adjusted the trajectory of his Internal Breath every time, the Internal Breath he could mobilize in each punch became stronger and stronger, the strength of his fist naturally became stronger and stronger.\u2018The force of the Sitting Horse Rush Fist earlier was actually as high as 891.712979 kilograms, and it far exceeded any of his previous punches.Most importantly, this punch made an abnormally bold thought appear in his mind.After thinking for a moment, Chu Nan sat down cross-legged and cultivated the Nine Revolutions Technique.Feeling his Internal Breath flowing through his meridians with the Nine Revolutions Technique, the bold idea in Chu Nan\u2019s heart gradually formed.The power of the Nine Revolutions Cultivation Technique was the Nine Revolutions Internal Breath. Every cycle would make the Internal Breath thicker. At the Ninth Revolution, the Internal Breath would become several times stronger than when it was at the first cycle or even dozens of times stronger.The stronger one cultivated the Nine Revolutions Technique, the greater this increase would be.It was said that Su Xuansheng had cultivated the Nine Revolutions Technique to the seventh level back then. After reaching the Ninth Revolution Internal Breath, the power of his punch was even enough to blast apart stars. It far exceeded ordinary Star-Grade Martial Artists.Although this legend was a little exaggerated, it was enough to show the extraordinariness of the Nine Revolutions Technique.If not for the fact that the Nine Revolutions Cultivation Technique was truly too difficult to break through and that no one had been able to reach the height of Su Xuansheng back then, it would definitely not have been treated as one of the trash cultivation methods by others.Previously, when Chu Nan coordinated with the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist to mobilize his Internal Breath, he had only temporarily coordinated with the Nine Revolutions Technique in battle. He could only circulate his Internal Breath in time and its power was already extraordinary.\u2018What he wanted to do now was to try to advance his Nine Revolutions Internal Breath. When he mobilized his Internal Breath sufficiently powerful, coupled with the use of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist, the power would probably be even more shocking.Of course, the risk of doing this was definitely extremely great, so he could only try it in Martial Soul.This thought was also very difficult. This was because if he wanted to complement the use of Internal Breath with the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist, he had to calculate the trajectory of his Internal Breath in advance and match the moves of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist. As for the Nine Revolutions Internal Breath,it required time. Coupled with the physical movements, the timing had to be extremely exquisite and precise.The battle situation between martial artists was ever-changing. How could it be so easy to accurately grasp all the changes and use the Nine Revolutions Technique in advance to complete nine circulations of Internal Breath?\u201cHeh, the higher the difficulty, the higher the benefits. If I want to become an expert, how can I not take a risk?\u201dChu Nan jumped up from the ground and simulated the plan of the Nine Revolutions Internal Breath in his mind again. Then, he silently circulated the Nine Revolutions Technique and waited for his Internal Breath to circulate nine times in his body before punching out..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - Severe SituationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosAfter two days and six rounds of intense competition, after the seventh round of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition, the number of competitors had already decreased greatly.Take the groups below the age of 20 for example. In the first round, there were a total of 14,993 martial artists who signed up to participate. As for the seventh round of the competition today, there were only 256 left.However, compared to the past two days, the attention received today was much greater.The reason was very simple. Because there was no threshold set for the martial artists participating in the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition, the levels of the martial artists who came to register were mixed. As a result, the vast majority of the competitions two days ago were like what Rengalhad evaluated in the program\u2014their standards were too low, and it was truly unbearable to watch.Now, after six rounds of elimination, those who could pass six rounds in a row and still remain in the arena were nearly all powerful martial artists. The competition naturally became even more intense and exciting.However, there was another important reason why more people were paying attention to the competition today.The \u201cFocus News\u201d program of the Federation\u2019s Information Martial Arts World Channel was an extremely popular program. On the program yesterday, as a guest, Tang Xiaoyou took out an abnormally detailed dataset, proving that after three rounds of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition, thesituation was extremely serious for the Earth Federation.The data showed that as the martial arts competition continued, the proportion of participating martial artists belonging to the federation was actually decreasing at an extremely obvious rate.This was a martial arts competition held in the territory of the Earth Federation. It could be said to be a home ground battle. The results obtained were actually so lousy!Therefore, under the deliberate push of some people and the media, the number of martial artists participating greatly decreased, and the number of people paying attention to this competition increased.In just a day, the news and discussion about the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition on the Milky Way Network increased more than ten times. This competition almost instantly became the focus of attention of several countries.The people of the Earth Federation naturally hoped to see the martial artists of the Earth Federation obtain good results in the next few rounds of the competition and the final stage to protect the honor of the Earth Federation. As for the countries outside the Earth Federation, they were naturally happyto see the Earth Federation embarrassed.In fact, among those countries with their own martial artists participating and passing the first six rounds of the competition, many people directly mocked the Earth Federation publicly, causing the Earth Federation to counterattack. Therefore, an extremely intense flame war had erupted.However, no matter how well they argued, it was not as convincing as the truth.The next day, after the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition ended, the statistics after the six rounds were immediately compiled.According to the competition rules, after the sixth round, the remaining martial artists in the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial artist competition were 512 in the adult group above the age of 20, and 256 in the young martial artist group below the age of 20.Of the remaining 512 participating martial artists in the adult group, only 187 were left from the Earth Federation! They had barely passed a third!However, this was not the most shocking thing. What truly shocked and even frightened the people of the Earth Federation was that out of the 256 participating martial artists below the age of 20, only 42 were left!It was less than a sixth!This time, people truly valued the topic mentioned by Tang Xiaoyou on the \u201cFocus News\u201d program.\u2018The young martial artists represented the future. With such poor results, it meant that the future of the martial artists of the Earth Federation was unimaginable. It could even mean that the martial arts quality of the entire Earth Federation was falling!Perhaps some people were not too interested in this overly broad topic, but they had to admit that there was another possibility that Tang Xiaoyou had mentioned.\u2018That was, in this martial arts competition organized by the West Cloud Planet, the champion might be a non-Earth Federation martial artist!If this could become reality, it would be the humiliation of the entire Earth Federation!Therefore, the third day of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition became the focus of countless people.If the last three rounds of the elimination stage on the third day were still like the previous two days, then there might even be very few Earth Federation martial artists who entered the final stage. The hope of winning the championship was naturally even more remote.They could not allow this to happen!\u201cMartial Artists of the federation! Please fight for the honor of the federation!\u201dChu Nan had just walked out of the floating shuttle specially sent by West Cloud Academy today. When he saw the surging crowd and the huge banner that was raised the most in the crowd, he could not help but be stunned.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dAlthough there were many spectators in the competition two days ago, most of the audience only pretended to watch the competition leisurely. Most of them treated this competition as a grand entertainment event.Why did it seem like the audience had completely changed after not seeing them for a day? All of them became extremely excited, and there was even a faint trace of anger?He turned around and looked at the seven floating shuttle cars that belonged to West Cloud Academy that followed behind him, as well as the students and teachers who were walking out from the seven cars with various support banners in their hands. Chu Nan finally felt that something was wrong\u201cHey, Dong Fang, do you know what\u2019s going on?\u201d Chu Nan grabbed Dong Fang who had just gotten out of the floating Lock Car and walked over. He pointed at the crowd shouting their slogans.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Dong Fang glanced in the direction Chu Nan pointed and nodded before laughing, \u201cHa, have you forgotten the one I showed you yesterday?\u201d\u2018The virtual figure projection that Dong Fang had shown him last night flashed through Chu Nan\u2018s mind, causing him to feel even more puzzled.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cHeh, didn\u2019t I tell you yesterday that this competition\u2026\u201dAfter Dong Fang\u2019s rough explanation, Chu Nan finally understood what was going on.\u201cNo wonder the academy took it so seriously today. They even specially sent a car to send us over and even pulled a bunch of students and teachers to be cheerleaders\u2026\u201dChu Nan\u2019s gaze swept past the students who were being organized by the other teachers and felt a little funny.On the first day of the competition, although the academy was careful, they only sent a team leader teacher and a logistics team composed of five staff members to follow.Early this morning, West Cloud Academy sent out a total of seven cars. In total, there were more than 200 people.Apart from the teacher-in-charge, the logistics team had also increased to 15 people. Even the Deputy Dean of the Martial Arts Branch followed.Coupled with the cheerleader squad of more than a hundred people, the lineup could be said to be abnormally huge.Chu Nan had originally thought that he had benefited from another participant of the academy, who was also the biological son of the West Cloud Academy\u2019s dean, Feng Xiao. Now that he heard Dong Fang\u2019s explanation, he discovered the reason why it was so laughable.\u201cHmph, can victory and defeat between martial artists be decided by shouting slogans?\u201dChu Nan glanced at Feng Xiao who was surrounded by a few teachers and shook his head..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At that time, he even had to register and find the competition venue himself.Today, such chores did not require Chu Nan to spend any additional effort. The teacher-in-charge whose attitude had changed greatly had long arranged things for him abnormally well, allowing him to enjoy the pleasure of being carefully waited on.\u201cHeh, Chu Nan, are you confident?\u201dDong Fang had not come to watch the battle two days ago. This was the first time he had come today. After he got out of the car, he ran around wildly. At this moment, he appeared out of nowhere and asked Chu Nan with a serious expression when he saw him.Chu Nan glanced at his expression and shook his head.\u201cNot confident?\u201d Dong Fang was stunned, and then he frowned, \u201cIndeed. I looked around just now. The remaining participating martial artists are indeed not easy to deal with. I just casually walked around and saw at least ten Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists. Damn, this is below the age of 20. Whyare there so many Internal Breath Realm fellows?\u201dChu Nan rolled his eyes.\u201cNonsense. It\u2019s not rare to see young martial artists who can perfect the Overlord Body Realm before the age of 20 and break through to the Internal Breath Realm. Just our West Cloud Academy alone has a few. What\u2019s so strange about that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. However, Chu Nan, I asked around yesterday. Among the fifteen participants in our West Cloud Academy, three of the third grade participants are participating in the group below the age of 20. One of them is an Internal Breath expert. Why did he get eliminated while Feng Xiao stayed?\u201dChu Nan glanced at Feng Xiao who was talking to the deputy dean in the distance and shrugged.\u201cPerhaps he was lucky.\u201dIndeed, Feng Xiao was only a fourth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist. In terms of strength, he was even slightly inferior to Luo Li.In the end, after six rounds, not only was Luo Li heavily injured, but other Internal Breath experts had also been eliminated. Instead, it was really abnormal for a fourth-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist like Feng Xiao to still be in the competition.\u201cTsk\u2026\u201d Dong Fang curled his lips with disdain. He tumed to look at Chu Nan and smiled,\u201d Of course, Chu Nan, if we really talk about luck, I\u2019m afraid everyone will think that you\u2019re the luckiest one, right? You\u2019re only at the initial-stage Overlord Body realm, but you\u2019ve also entered the seventh round. Whowould believe it if word got out?\u201d\u201cWhether they believe it or not, it\u2019s none of my business.\u201d Chu Nan rolled his eyes.Of course, if he had to say it, Chu Nan felt that his luck was not bad.In the first three rounds, he had encountered initial-stage or second-stage Overlord Body Martial Artists, so their strength was naturally very weak.In the fourth to sixth rounds of the previous day, although the opponent he had encountered had increased in strength, it was only the Azalu he had encountered in the fifth round that had brought him some trouble. The opponent in the sixth round was only an ordinary martial artist between the fourthand fifth-stage Overlord Body realm.In comparison, only Azalu was the strongest. In the end, he was the opponent who helped Chu Nan the most, allowing him to indirectly understand the method to flexibly use his Internal Breath in battle.Chu Nan even felt that if he had the chance to encounter Azalu again, he should thank him properly.\u201cHeh, Chu Nan, I\u2019m asking you. Are you confident?\u201d Dong Fang nudged Chu Nan with his elbow and asked again, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that you promised Zheng Yuanlin to win the group championship below the age of 20.\u201dChu Nan smiled bitterly, \u201cThinking about it now, I was really too arrogant in front of Senior Zheng. To be honest, I\u2019m not completely confident.\u201d\u201cNot completely confident? Does this mean that you still have a little confidence?\u201d Dong Fang\u2019s eyes lit up.Recalling the experiment practice and subsequent breakthroughs in the Martial Soul virtual training ground last night, Chu Nan took a deep breath and slowly nodded.\u201cIf there aren\u2019t any unexpected opponents, I\u2019m more than 50% confident.\u201dDong Fang looked at Chu Nan in surprise.\u201cTsay, ever since you broke through the third level of the Nine Revolutions Technique, you\u2019ve really become different. Seeing you like this, I\u2019m a little tempted to practice the Nine Revolutions Technique.\u201dOf course, Chu Nan knew that he was joking. He smiled and shook his head and ignored it.\u201cAlright, regardless of whether it\u2019s true or not, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re confident.\u201d Dong Fang patted Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder, \u201cDeputy Dean Payne has come. It seems that he wants to chat with you and cheer you on. I\u2019ll leave first and return before the competition begins.\u201dAfter saying this, Dong Fang displayed flexibility that was completely different from his fat body and quickly entered the crowd and disappeared.\u201cHeh, Chu Nan, how is it? Is your condition alright?\u201dDeputy Dean Payne was of Germanic descent. He was tall and strong with a full beard and a rough voice. He slapped Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder, causing his muscles to involuntarily jump.\u201cDeputy Dean, thank you for your concern. I\u2019m in a good state now.\u201dUnlike Luo Yuntong, who was hated by the students of the Martial Arts Branch because he often protected Luo Li, the junior, Deputy Dean Payne was very approachable and was deeply loved by the students.Chu Nan revealed a confident smile and deliberately bent his arm to show him his muscles.Deputy Dean Payne laughed and patted Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder again. He pondered for a moment and his expression became serious.\u201cChu Nan, you and Feng Xiao are the only two remaining participants in our academy\u2019s group below the age of 20. I won\u2019t say that I want you to obtain honor for our academy, nor will I ask you to fight for the honor of the federation like those ignorant people. I only want to say that you\u2019re a martial artistnow. Since you\u2019re a martial artist, you have to face every battle with all your might. Can you do it?\u201dChu Nan smiled.\u201cDeputy Dean, demanding that the other party do his best and not have regrets is a sign that you don\u2019t have confidence in the other party. I remember that you said this yourself. It seems that you don\u2019t have any confidence in me now?\u201dDeputy Dean Payne was stunned and looked at Chu Nan in surprise before laughing again.\u201cVery good. I like straightforward fellows like you. That\u2019s right, I indeed did not have much confidence in you, because you are after all\u2026 er\u2026 only an initial-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist. However, since you were able to defeat Luo Li in the qualifiers of the academy and even defeat LuMingcheng, I believe that you definitely have true strength that far exceeds our imagination. Therefore, is it true that I don\u2019t have confidence in you? That\u2019s not right. I actually have a lot of confidence in you now, even more than I do in Feng Xiao.\u201dAt this point, Deputy Dean Payne even bent down slightly and leaned closer to Chu Nan. He whispered in his ear, \u201cOf course, I can\u2019t say this publicly, let alone say it in front of Feng Xiao. You must understand.\u201dChu Nan could not help but smile.\u201cDeputy Dean, I\u2019m not that stupid.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Deputy Dean Payne stood up and patted Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder again, \u201cGo fight well. I look forward to your surprising performance.\u201dChu Nan watched as Deputy Dean Payne returned to the group of teachers and students who were in the cheerleader squad. Then, his gaze collided with Feng Xiao\u2019s.Feng Xiao had a serious expression. When he saw Chu Nan looking over, he nodded as a greeting. He did not have the arrogant and despotic appearance he usually had in the academy.Chu Nan smiled.From the looks of it, Feng Xiao must be feeling very pressured at this moment, preventing him from relaxing.Just as he turned around and was about to drink some water, a young and beautiful face collided with him.\u201cHeh, Chu Nan, right? Hello, I\u2019m the reporter from the Federation\u2019s Information Martial Arts World Channel, Yang Xirui.. May I interview you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Because there were only hundreds of participants left on the third day, the existing venue was already enough for all the competitions to be carried out simultaneously.In the 256 competitions of the adult group and the 128 competitions of the group under the age of 20, people\u2019s attention was naturally divided.To the live audience of the Earth Federation and the audience who had watched through various broadcast channels, they naturally paid more attention to the competitions that famous martial artists participated in.Clearly, the adult group competition had a natural advantage in this because only adults would be stronger and more famous.Among them, the competition between the only nine Void Break Martial Artists received the most attention. The Earth Federation\u2019s Martial Arts World Channel even directly broadcasted a competition between Void Break Martial Artists from the Earth Federation.In comparison, other competitions below the age of 20 were also highly watched, and in a sense, they were even more eye-catching than those in the adult group.This was because the previous data had already shown that in the group below the age of 20, the young martial artists of the Earth Federation could not even make up one-sixth of the remaining participants!Moreover, according to the detailed statistics of a certain someone on the Milky Way Network, even among the remaining 42 young martial artists of the Earth\u2019s Federation under the age of 20, the number of those who really had hope of winning the championship was small.According to the statistics, among the remaining 42 young martial artists, only one young martial artist had the strength of a second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist. Four young martial artists had the strength of an initial-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, and the remaining 37young martial artists were all only Overlord Body Realm Martial Artists.Compared to the powerful strength of the other countries\u2019 participating martial artists who were on average initial-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists, the young martial artists of the Earth Federation were undoubtedly much inferior.Therefore, before the seventh round of the competition began, someone speculated pessimistically that only after the seventh round ended would more than half of the remaining young martial artists of the Earth Federation be eliminated.When the eighth and ninth rounds ended, the worst outcome was that even a martial artist belonging to the Earth Federation could not stay!If not even a single young martial artist from the Earth Federation could enter the finals, this West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial artist competition would simply be the greatest humiliation to the Earth Federation!Due to the evaluation of strength, most of the gazes focused on the competition below the age of 20 were focused on the few Internal Breath Realm young martial artists of the Earth Federation. Only a small number of people would focus on the competition between the other young martial artists of theEarth Federation.As for an ordinary young martial artist like Chu Nan who was not famous at all and was not even an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, no one paid attention to him.Even the cheerleaders of the West Cloud Academy were almost all sent to Feng Xiao\u2019s competition venue to cheer for him, the son of the dean and a fourth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist.Chu Nan did not know the situation of the competition on Feng Xiao\u2019s side and did not care about such things. All his attention was focused on his opponent.This participant with a number of 6830 and who came from the Phezzan Autonomous Region was called Chloe. As soon as he appeared, he bluntly revealed his strength as an Internal Breath Martial Artist, causing the few Earth Federation audiences around him to instantly lose confidence in Chu Nan.\u201cSigh, this 12333 seems to be only at the low-stage Overlord Body Realm. How can he defeat an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. He\u2019s still a participating student of the West Cloud Academy, right? This West Cloud Academy is really getting worse year by year. Even a student with such poor strength can be sent out to be a representative.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which, how did this guy pass the first six rounds? Could it be that his luck was so good that he encountered lower-level Overlord Body Martial Artists in the first six rounds?\u201d\u201cCould it be that some important figure specially took care of this kid, so the competition schedule was specially arranged?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the use? Doesn\u2019t he still have to encounter experts and be beaten?\u201dAlthough the loud discussion of the audience below the stage surged into Chu Nan\u2019s ears, it did not cause any change in his expression.He glanced at Chloe opposite him and saw that he was still putting on a loose appearance with a disdainful smile. He took a step forward and circulated the Nine Revolutions Technique. The Internal Breath in his body flowed as he threw a punch.Chloe\u2019s eyes narrowed.Chu Nan\u2019s punch seemed ordinary, but the speed of his punch was abnormally fast. When the tip of his fist struck, an ear-piercing sound could be heard. It could be seen that the force behind his punch was extremely shocking.\u201cHow can this guy be only a low-level Overlord Body Martial Artist?!\u201dAs soon as the shocking thought arose in Chloe\u2019s mind, Chu Nan\u2019s fist approached.Chloe had previously underestimated Chu Nan and was not prepared for battle. Now, he was actually unable to react in time and could only hurriedly raise his right hand to block his chest.He did not have any frightened thoughts. Instead, he sneered in his mind.Even if Chu Nan\u2019s strength surpassed what he had seen on the surface, he was only an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist in the end. If this fellow dared to face an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist like him, he would be courting death.As expected, just as he was about to punch Chloe\u2019s palm, Chu Nan flipped his wrist and his right fist changed an angle to strike the space under the ribs.Although Chloe was surprised by Chu Nan\u2019 fast and precise change in move, he was even more relieved.Chu Nan clearly did not dare to fight him head-on. Then, it was time for him, an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, to show his true strength!Facing Chu Nan\u2019s variable attack, Chloe did not dodge at all. Instead, he straightened his chest and similarly threw a punch at him.He could estimate that because he was counterattacking, this punch should only hit after Chu Nan\u2019s punch landed.However, he was a powerful Internal Breath Martial Artist while Chu Nan was only an ordinary low-level Overlord Body Martial Artist. Even if Chu Nan\u2019s punch landed firmly on his body, it was impossible for it to cause any damage to him under the protection of his Internal Breath.On the contrary, it was impossible for Chu Nan to endure his punch that had a powerful Internal Breath. If he really dared to exchange blows with him, he would at least be heavily injured.Therefore, Chu Nan\u2019s only choice was to retreat.As long as Chu Nan dared to take the first step back, Chloe was certain that he would definitely defeat him in ten moves!However, under the shocked gazes of the audience and Chloe, it was as if Chu Nan did not sense this terrifying outcome. He also did not dodge or even change his posture as his right fist went straight for Chloe\u2019s ribs.Although Chloe was surprised, it was too late to change his move. Moreover, why did he need to change his move? He similarly maintained his move and threw a punch at Chu Nan.The first confrontation after the two of them went up the stage had actually directly become the most tragic exchange of injuries!Chu Nan\u2019s upper body moved slightly. His fist was about half a second earlier than Chloe\u2019s estimation and firmly struck the lower left ribs.Chloe felt an extremely huge and irresistible force explode from Chu Nam\u2019s fist.In the next moment, his body had already flown into the air. He passed the guardrail of the competition venue and fell heavily outside..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although Chloe came from the Phezzan Autonomous Region that had a good relationship with the Earth Federation, she was still a foreigner.It was naturally something worth being happy about that Chu Nan could defeat Chloe.Moreover, the situation of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial artist competition was so serious, especially in the groups below the age of 20. If one more young martial artist from the Earth Federation could enter the next round, it would increase the chances of the Earth Federation martial artist obtainingthe championship.\u201cYeah! That\u2019s great!\u201dAmong the cheering audience, Yang Xirui was the most excited.She was so happy that she even jumped up, causing the assistant beside her to look at her twice.Although it was indeed worth being happy that the young martial artists of the Earth Federation defeated foreign martial artists, it should not make Yang Xirui so happy, right?Moreover, this young martial artist called Chu Nan had rejected Yang Xirui\u2019s interview request twice yesterday and today.In the assistant\u2019s opinion, this was clearly not giving Yang Xirui any face.It was already not bad that Yang Xirui was not angry at him. Why was she still so excited about his victory?At this moment, Yang Xirui could not care less what her assistant was thinking. She stared at Chu Nan who was walking down the stage and felt extremely excited.Her judgment was indeed correct!This Chu Nan could definitely make big news!Chu Nan slowly walked down the stairs and arrived beside Chloe who had already gotten up. He stretched out his hand.After Chloe fell out of the arena, the referee had already determined that Chu Nan had won. According to the rules of the competition, shaking hands after the competition was a friendly process.However, perhaps because he was not convinced or because he felt that it was strange, Chu Nan\u2019s previous opponents did not complete the process with him in the previous six rounds, causing him to feel a little regretful.He originally thought that Chloe, an expert of the Internal Breath realm, would be like the other experts and leave directly because he was unwilling to accept being defeated by Chu Nan by accident. He did not expect that Chloe would look at him from head to toe and actually reach out to grab the handChu Nan held out with an excited and curious expression.\u201cHeh, your name is Chu Nan, right? Can you tell me what cultivation method you cultivate? Why is your Internal Breath so special? Right, what fist technique did you use just now? Your strength is too shocking. I\u2019m very curious, can you tell me? Or should we find a place to spar now? I\u2026\u201dChu Nan speechlessly looked at Chloe who was talking non-stop.This guy did not say a word on the stage and put on the appearance of a cold expert. His attacks were even simpler, direct, and even rough. He did not expect that the situation below the stage had completely changed.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dAs soon as Chu Nan spoke, Chloe saw that he seemed to be hesitating and immediately interrupted.\u201cYes, yes, I understand. It\u2019s very annoying to inquire about other people\u2019s cultivation methods. The martial artists of your Earth Federation pay more attention to this. It\u2019s fine if you really don\u2019t want to say it. I\u2019m just curious, really curious. Actually, I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. In the end, you\u2019re onlyan Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist, so the cultivation method you cultivate shouldn\u2019t be much better\u2026 Ah, forgive me, I\u2019m such a straightforward person\u2026\u201dChu Nan began to regret it.He used to think that Dong Fang was noisy enough, but he did not expect that this guy was actually several times noisier than Dong Fang.If only he had known that he would ignore this rule and leave directly.Chloe pulled Chu Nan and spoke for nearly ten minutes before Chu Nan exchanged his personal terminal number and left the communication method before reluctantly leaving.Looking at his back disappear into the crowd, Chu Nan heaved a sigh of relief.He thought for a moment and found it funny.\u2018When he was in the West Cloud Academy, he usually came into contact with some students of the same grade. When he came to participate in this West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition, he could come into contact with all kinds of martial artists and the various strange martial techniques theygrasped. It was truly an eye-opener.Azalu and Chloe, who he had encountered in the earlier rounds, were both very special fellows. He believed that he would easily recognize them the next time he encountered them.\u2018When he thought of this, a figure flashed through Chu Nan\u2018s mind.The guy who could even circulate his Internal Breath at any time when he walked had also left a deep impression on him.He did not know if they could meet after entering the finals.Just as he thought of this, Chu Nan felt a gaze sweep over. His heart stirred and when he raised his head, he saw the young martial artist that had flashed through his mind.He still had that arrogant expression and disdainful gaze as he looked at Chu Nan provocatively.Seeing him staring like this, Chu Nan was puzzled.Why was this guy so hostile to him?Could it be because he had glanced at him in the crowd earlier?Maruk raised his head slightly and raised his hand to gesture at Chu Nan in the distance before sneering.Although this Earth kid looked to be only an ordinary Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist, his vision was not bad. Last time, he could actually see that Maruk was special. Presumably, his true strength was much stronger than it looked, or he had a master guiding him from behind.While waiting for the next round to begin, it was not bad to find him to stretch his limbs and pass the time.In the distance, Chu Nan frowned slightly and carefully observed Maruk for a while. His expression seemed to be a little hesitant.Maruk sneered again and flipped his finger at Chu Nan before gesturing with his thumb.\u2018When he saw this action, Chu Nan immediately laughed.This guy was clearly a young martial artist from the Kingdom of Kexley, but he had specially used this common gesture in the Earth Federation. He had some knowledge of the Earth Federation.He thought for a moment and decided to ask why the other party was so hostile to him.If it was only because of the tense relationship between the Earth Federation and the Kingdom of Kexley, this person was too bored.Just as he took a step, a figure suddenly rushed in front of Chu Nan and stopped their exchange of gazes.\u201cHello, Chu Nan. I\u2019m the reporter from the Federation\u2019s Information Martial Arts World Channel, Yang Xirui. May I interview you?\u201dChu Nan sighed helplessly and looked past Yang Xirui\u2019s shoulder. He discovered that the guy had already turned around and left, so he lowered his head to look at Yang Xirui.\u201cMiss Yang Xirui, why do you want to interview me so much? I\u2019m not a famous person.\u201d\u201cBecause I feel that there are many things worth digging about you.\u201d Yang Xirui revealed a sweet smile, \u201cChu Nan, you\u2019re clearly only a low-level Overlord Body Martial Artist, but you\u2019ve defeated several high-level Overlord Body Martial Artists in a row. You\u2019ve even defeated an Internal Breath MartialArtist now. Don\u2019t you think this is very worth paying attention to?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s only because these people underestimated their opponent.\u201d Chu Nan shook his head and was about to leave when his heart suddenly stirred. He asked Yang Xirui, \u201cRight, can I watch your show, the Purple Cloud Planet?\u201d\u201cOf course. The Federation\u2019s Information Martial Arts World Channel is broadcasted to the entire Earth Federation. It can be seen from anywhere in the federation.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 will the interview with me be broadcasted?\u201dHearing the meaning of Chu Nan\u2019s words, the smile on Yang Xirui\u2019s face became even wider with a hint of cunningness.\u201cThis will depend on whether the interview with you has enough news valuePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mu Yutong, who was in deep thought, suddenly looked up and looked at the door in confusion.\u201cCome in. The door is not locked.\u201dThe door was pushed open and Norman with his signature green hair strode in.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you today? You\u2019re actually willing to come to my place as a guest?\u201d Mu Yutong smiled and greeted.Norman shook his head and did not answer. Instead, he walked straight to the large terminal screen set up in the room and transmitted a message.A moment later, the image of Chu Nan punching Chloe away appeared on the huge virtual screen.After waiting for this scene to repeat twice, Norman pointed at Chu Nan on the virtual screen and asked Mu Yutong, \u201cHey, do you recognize this kid?\u201dThe moment he saw Chu Nan on the virtual screen, a trace of surprise flashed through Mu Yutong\u2019s eyes before he suppressed it.Now that he heard Norman ask, he smiled and asked, \u201cWhat? Is there a problem?\u201dNorman glared at him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? Do you know that this guy has eliminated a genius from our Phezzan Autonomous Region? You\u2019ve always told me that you didn\u2019t find any good seedlings this time. I don\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t notice this little guy.\u201dMu Yutong was silent for a moment before his gaze swept past Chu Nan who was frozen on the virtual screen. He sighed softly and nodded, \u201cHis name is Chu Nan.\u201d\u201cYou did notice.\u201d Norman sneered, \u201cVery good, Mu. Now that you have completed your goal, according to our agreement, you will have to go to the Phezzan Autonomous Region with me next month.\u201dMu Yutong looked up at him.\u201cWho told you that I\u2019ve completed my goal?\u201d Norman was stunned, then furious.\u201cYou clearly have such an outstanding kid here, but you\u2019re telling me that you didn\u2019t complete the goal? Are you lying through your teeth?\u201d\u201cChu Nan\u2026\u201d When he mentioned Chu Nan\u2019s name, Mu Yutong frowned slightly, \u201cHe is indeed very outstanding and his talent is very good, but\u2026 he still does not fulfill my requirement.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible? Although I did not take Chloe as my disciple, his talent is rather good. He has already become a second-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist at the age of 19, but he was sent flying by a punch from this kid called Chu Nan. Could it be that he still can\u2019t meet your requirements?\u201dNorman clearly did not believe it.\u201cLook carefully.\u201d Mu Yutong pointed at the virtual screen, \u201cWatch a few more times and you\u2019ll see why.\u201dSeeing Mu Yutong\u2019s serious expression, Norman frowned and started to play this video again.The scene of Chu Nan sending Chloe flying with a punch only lasted for a few seconds. Norman quickly read it a few times. His two thick green eyebrows that were like weeds growing on his eyes frowned deeply.\u201cThis kid\u2026 doesn\u2019t seem to have reached the level of an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist\u2026\u201d\u201cTo be precise, he\u2019s only at the initial-stage Overlord Body realm now. Of course, from the looks of it, he has made some breakthroughs recently. Perhaps he can be considered a second-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist.\u201d\u201cWhat a joke!\u201d Norman reflexively retorted, \u201cIf he was only an initial-stage or second-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist, what right did he have to send a second-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist like Chloe flying with a punch? Look, he clearly used Internal Breath in his punch.\u201d\u201cDo you need me to tell you that Overlord Body Martial Artists can also mobilize their Internal Breath in battle?\u201d Mu Yutong glanced at him indifferently.Norman sneered and frowned as he looked at the image twice more. He turned and looked at Mu Yutong solemnly.\u201cTell me, what\u2019s going on? This kid called Chu Nan does look like a low-level Overlord Body, but he was actually able to send Chloe flying with a punch. It\u2019s clearly not that simple.\u201dMu Yutong shook his head and did not answer. He adjusted the large screen on the terminal and released another video.This scene was the scene that he had watched and evaluated with Zheng Yuanlin before. It was the scene where Chu Nan repelled Luo Jie in the underground parking lot.After repeating this scene a few times, Norman fell silent.After a long time, he asked, \u201cAre you sure this little guy is only at the low-stage Overlord Body Realm?\u201d\u201cYou saw it just now,\u201d Mu Yutong replied.Norman was silent for a moment longer, then suddenly let out a long sigh.\u201cHow unfortunate\u2026\u201dMu Yutong smiled bitterly, \u201cIt\u2019s indeed a pity.\u201dNorman sighed, \u201cIf we could have discovered this little guy ten years earlier, your Earth Federation would have probably benefited greatly from the next invitation from the royal family of Declan. It would probably not be difficult for another Star-Grade Martial Artist to appear in the future. Unfortunately, he\u2019s only at the low-stage Overlord Body Realm now. His body has yet to be tempered, and his Internal Breath is far from sufficient. It\u2019s almost impossible for him to break through the Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate in the future. No matter how hard he works, he\u2019ll probably only be a low-level Void Break Martial Artist at most. What a pity\u2026\u201dMu Yutong also had an expression of pity.\u201cForget about the Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate for now, but it\u2019s only a few years until the invitation form the royal family of Declan. It\u2019s impossible for him to reach the minimum requirement in a short few years. Therefore, although I admire him very much, I can only give up.\u201dNorman nodded lightly in agreement.In their opinion, if Chu Nan had enough hard work and opportunities in the future, there was still a chance that he could become a Void Break Martial Artist. In the eyes of ordinary people, he could be considered an expert, but in the eyes of these two Star-Grade Martial Artists, Void Break Martial Artists were not much different from ordinary people, so there was no need to pay too much attention to him. After thinking for a moment, Norman suddenly asked, \u201cRight, Mu Yutong, did your Earth Federation push for the popularization of basic martial arts this time to prevent similar wasted potential like Chu Nan from appearing again?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Mu Yutong slowly nodded, \u201cDo you still remember what Yuanlin told you before? Our Earth Federation does not lack talent, but we lack the way to discover talent. There are definitely countless young geniuses like Chu Nan in our Earth Federation. If we can let these geniuses who are buried lay a sufficient martial arts foundation in advance, we can let them grow as much as possible.\u201dNorman thought for a moment and shook his head, \u201cThis policy is useless in our Phezzan Autonomous Region. Everyone in our Phezzan Autonomous Region has practiced martial arts since young. As long as one has enough talent, they will definitely be able to appear. There will definitely not be a situation like Chu Nan.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Mu Yutong glanced at him.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Norman paused and smiled bitterly,\u201d Alright, I\u2019m not 100% sure. But no matter what, we\u2019re much better than your Earth Federation.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. The history of your Phezzan Autonomous Region is actually about the same as the Declan Empire. The time when our Earth Federation stepped into the Milky Way and truly started to explore martial arts was only a few hundred years.\u201dMu Yutong stood up and circled the room twice before suddenly revealing a slightly strange smile to Norman.\u201cAre you interested in putting up a show with me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - Also From the Kingdom of KexleyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the temporary logistics base of West Cloud Academy, the atmosphere was extremely depressing and strange. Be it their actions or words, the people in the base appeared to be a little careful. They were afraid to anger Feng Xiao, who was sitting at the side with a terrifying and dark expression, looking abnormally vexed. The eighth round of the elimination round had just ended.Although Feng Xiao had relied on his powerful inherited cultivation method in the seventh round to erupt with astonishing combat strength and defeat a powerful opponent who was at the perfection-stage Overlord Body and was only a step away from breaking through to the Internal Breath realm, he had encountered an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist in the next eighth round and was defeated without any suspense.There was only one round left until the finals. This fact naturally made Feng Xiao extremely unwillingHowever, he was powerless to change this fact. The difference in strength between martial artists was extremely direct. The stronger party had indeed won. With his current strength at the fourth-stage Overlord Body realm, no one would be surprised if he was defeated by an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist who was an entire level higher.However\u2026 there were accidents in this world.Feng Xiao turned around slightly and his gaze landed on another corner of the temporary base.At this moment, a group of people surrounded Chu Nan. The atmosphere was different from here and it was relaxed and happy.\u201cThis damned guy, how can he pass the eighth round!\u201d Feng Xiao gritted his teeth, feeling furious and puzzled.Not only was Feng Xiao puzzled that Chu Nan could pass the eighth round of the elimination rounds, most of the people in West Cloud Academy were also puzzled. After all, Chu Nan was only an initial-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist. It was understandable that he could pass the first few rounds, but how could he pass the next few rounds, especially in the competition where there were so many experts today?Chu Nan ignored the complicated gazes that were thrown at him. Instead, he lowered his head and carefully studied the information displayed on the virtual screen of his personal terminal.This information was brought over by Deputy Dean Payne just now. The content inside was about the opponents he would face in the ninth round of the elimination rounds.Name: SahaNumber: 9526Country: Kingdom of KexleyChu Nan did not have any thoughts about the name \u2018Saha\u2019. His main attention was focused on \u20189526\u2019 and \u2018Kingdom of Kexley\u2019.The guy who had severely injured Luo Li earlier was also from the Kingdom of Kexley. The number was 9527, which was one number away. If he was not wrong, the two of them should be companions.Then, from this point of view, Saha\u2019s strength would not be weak.Moreover, according to this information that Deputy Dean Payne had gathered, the strength that Saha had displayed in the previous eight rounds was indeed extraordinary. The initial judgment was that he was at least an initial-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, and it was possible that he was still hiding his strength.Apart from recording these calculations, this information also gathered all the videos of the previous eight rounds of the competition.After Chu Nan carefully read through it, he discovered that Saha did not reveal much in the first eight rounds. Apart from being able to tell that his moves were extremely stable and rarely revealed any flaws, he could not see anything else. After all, it was very difficult to see Internal Breath in the video information. To a martial artist above the Internal Breath Realm, the strength and how to use Internal Breath were the most important factors in determining strength.However, Chu Nan still looked at it seriously.With his current strength, he did not expect to use his Internal Breath to suppress his opponent. The possibility of defeating an Internal Breath expert could only be suppressed through his powerful data ability.Analyzing these videos could allow him to roughly grasp the characteristics of Saha\u2019s martial technique. At the same time, he could collect a large amount of physical data and determine his exact ability. It was very helpful for the upcoming battle.After looking at it for a while, Deputy Dean Payne appeared in front of Chu Nan again.\u201cHeh, Chu Nan, the competition is about to begin. How\u2019s your preparation?\u201dChu Nan raised his head and revealed a brilliant smile to Deputy Dean Payne.\u201cDeputy Dean, no matter how well prepared I am, I can only know the truth in the arena, right?\u201dDeputy Dean Payne laughed, \u201cVery good. It seems that you have more confidence than I thought.\u201dAfter saying that, he patted Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder.\u201cAlright, go!\u201d Chu Nan went through the information in his mind and stood up.He had just taken two steps when a figure suddenly blocked Chu Nan.\u201cFeng Xiao, what are you doing?\u201d Chu Nan looked at him in shock. Feng Xiao\u2019s face sank as he stared at Chu Nan from head to toe a few times and sneered.\u201cChu Nan, I\u2019m warning you. If you dare to lose this round, I\u2019ll definitely not let you have a good time when we return to the academy!\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d Chu Nan looked at him in confusion.However, after Feng Xiao threw this sentence, he turned around and left without giving Chu Nan a chance to ask.\u201cHeh, what\u2019s wrong with this kid?\u201d Dong Fang appeared out of nowhere and muttered to Feng Xiao\u2019s back.\u201cHow would I know\u2026\u201d Chu Nan shrugged. \u201cAlright, don\u2019t bother about him. Chu Nan, do you have to be so serious? Isn\u2019t your opponent in this round only a second-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist? Isn\u2019t the guy you dealt with in the seventh round the same?\u201dChu Nan smiled bitterly and shook his head, \u201cI\u2019ve already told you. That opponent in the seventh round underestimated his opponent. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have won so easily.\u201d\u201cHa, look. You said that you wouldn\u2019t win so easily, not that you won\u2019t. Very good, it seems that you\u2019re indeed very confident now. Hmm\u2026 I can\u2019t be bothered to say so much nonsense. In short, do your best.\u201dDong Fang patted Chu Nan\u2019s back and pushed him to the predetermined competition venue.The other students in the logistics base looked around. Just as they were hesitating, Feng Xiao suddenly shouted.\u201cWhat are you all doing here? Aren\u2019t you going to cheer for Chu Nan?\u201dThe other students looked at Feng Xiao in surprise. Seeing that his expression was extremely serious and did not have the slightest intention of joking, they reacted and hurriedly followed behind.After all, Chu Nan was the only hope left in the group below the age of 20. If they did not cheer for him, it would not make sense.A moment later, the group of people had already arrived at the competition venue.Because it was the last round of the elimination rounds, there were 64 matches left in the adult group. There were only 32 competitions left in the group below the age of 20. Even if they were to be held at the same time, they only occupied 96 venues.Compared to the previous competition that had more than a thousand venues open at the same time, the last round had become abnormally concentrated, so it was naturally easier to attract a large number of spectators.The area beside the competition venue that Chu Nan was in was already surrounded by thousands of people. It was so crowded that not even a drop of water could pass through, and there was only a competition passageway left.The group of people from West Cloud Academy sent Chu Nan to the entrance of the competition passageway and cheered him on.Chu Nan smiled and nodded. Just as he was about to turn around and walk into the venue, he turned around and saw a familiar face filled with unyieldingness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - Senior and Junior BrothersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTheir gazes collided and they revealed surprised expressions.Seeing the other party\u2019s surprised expression, Chu Nan could not help but smile bitterly.He and this guy were really destined to meet each other no matter where he went.Then, his gaze landed on the other person beside that guy, and he recognized that this person was the opponent he had seen on the information sheet and was about to face-Saha from the Kingdom of Kexley. The introduction of Saha flashed through his mind and Chu Nan quickly looked at the arrogant guy beside him.\u201c9527?\u201dThat person was stunned and glanced at Chu Nan from head to toe. He chuckled and said, \u201cIt seems that your investigation of Senior Brother is quite detailed. Even I know about it.\u201dAfter saying that, he glanced at the other West Cloud Academy students beside Chu Nan and shook his head with an extremely disdainful expression.\u201cA bunch of useless people from the Earth Federation.\u201dThe students of West Cloud Academy were originally stunned by Chu Nan\u2019s sudden mention of \u201c9527\u201d. When they suddenly heard this, they were immediately furious.After cursing him, a student suddenly pointed at him and shouted, \u201cI remember now! He\u2019s 9527, the guy who heavily injured Luo Li!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s that guy from the Kingdom of Kexley?\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s him!\u201dThe students were agitated, but that person\u2019s expression did not change. He only raised his eyebrows. \u201cIn that case\u2026 I heavily injured your companion? Oh, then I\u2019m really sorry. It can\u2019t be helped, he\u2019s too weak.\u201d Seeing his mocking expression, the students of the West Cloud Academy were even angrier.Although Luo Li\u2019s reputation in the West Cloud Academy was usually not good, he was still a member of the West Cloud Academy. After all, he was from the Earth Federation. Not only was he heavily injured by this guy from the Kingdom of Kexley, but this fellow was also mocking them now. How could everyone endure this?However, in the face of everyone\u2019s cursing, that person only stretched out his hand and dug his ear with his small finger, then took it out. He made a gesture of flicking away the ear feces and said disdainfully, \u201cA group of useless people who only know how to use their mouths. If you have the ability, go on stage and defeat me. If not, shut up obediently.\u201dAfter throwing this sentence, he ignored the other students and glanced at Chu Nan. He shook his head and sighed, \u201cWhat a pity. I don\u2019t like you. I originally wanted to teach you a lesson in front of everyone and break your legs, but I didn\u2019t expect you to encounter my senior brother ahead of time. It\u2019s impossible for you to pass my senior brother, and I don\u2019t have the chance to teach you a lesson in the competition.\u201d\u201cSenior brother?\u201d Chu Nan automatically ignored the other words and noticed this title.Previously, he had only guessed that Saha and this 9527 were companions. He did not expect them to be intimate fellow disciples.Unlike 9527, Saha\u2019s personality was the same as the martial arts characteristics he revealed in the information video. He was extremely calm and even silent.Ever since he appeared, he had only been observing Chu Nan and did not say a word. Even if 9527 and the students beside Chu Nan had a conflict, he still ignored them as if all his attention was focused on Chu Nan.Seeing that Chu Nan ignored him, 9527 thought that he was afraid and patted Saha\u2019s shoulder.\u201cSenior Brother, play with this kid well. Of course, you can\u2019t kill him, or you\u2019ll be eliminated.\u201dOnly then did Saha move his gaze away from Chu Nan and look at 9527. He shook his head and sighed.\u201cMaruk, I should be the one saying this to you. In addition, your competition is about to begin. Go quickly.\u201dOnly then did Chu Nan know that this 9527\u2019s name was actually Maruk.After hearing Saha\u2019s words, he shrugged his shoulders and gestured disdainfully at the West Cloud Academy students beside Chu Nan before slowly leavingAfter he disappeared into the crowd, Saha suddenly became serious. He bent down and bowed deeply to Chu Nan and the students of the West Cloud Academy.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my junior brother has such a personality. Please forgive his rudeness justnow.\u201dChu Nan and the students were stunned.Although this Saha and that Maruk were fellow disciples, the difference in their personalities was worlds apart. It really made people feel strange.Everyone looked at each other, and it was naturally inappropriate for them to say anything. Saha stood up and gestured at Chu Nan.\u201cPlease come on stage and begin the competition.\u201dChu Nan glanced at him and bade farewell to his classmates before walking into the arena with Saha.At 3:38 PM on Earth, which was 2:00 PM in the local time of West Cloud City on West Cloud Planet, the ninth round of the highly anticipated West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition officially began.As soon as the referee announced the official start of the competition, Chu Nan had already moved. He rushed towards Saha and threw a punch.From the video information, this Saha basically walked the path of stabilizing himself while defending and counterattacking. Chu Nan did not want to drag the battle out with him. Otherwise, with the strength of an expert of the Internal Breath realm, Saha\u2019s Internal Breath was far deeper than Chu Nan\u2019s. His ability to last longer would naturally be much stronger.If he dragged this on for too long, Chu Nan\u2019s chances of winning would become increasingly slim.Therefore, even though Saha was skilled in defense and counterattack, Chu Nan also hoped to attack immediately and force the other party to reveal a flaw so as to determine the outcome.Unexpectedly, when he saw that Chu Nan\u2019s punch had already arrived in front of him, Saha did not plan to defend at all. Instead, he took a step forward and received it with a punch.He was actually the same as Chloe in the seventh round who exchanged injuries with Chu Nan right from the beginning! Chu Nan was slightly surprised, but then he was overjoyed.It was because Chloe had underestimated him that she was sent flying and defeated by his punch. Now, Saha was also doing this. He was simply courting death!Before he threw this punch, Chu Nan had already circulated the Nine Revolutions Technique in advance. When his fist approached Saha\u2019s left shoulder, the Nine Revolutions Technique had just completed two cycles of circulation and successfully obtained an increase. The huge Internal Breath was completely condensed on the tip of his fist.The force of this punch was already as high as 758.682131 kilograms!Chu Nan believed that if Saha still did not dodge, he would definitely be sent flying by this punch like Chloe!Bang!In the next moment, Chu Nan punched the collarbone of Saha\u2019s lower left shoulder. However, Chu Nan only felt as if his fist had struck an extremely thick and hard rock. Not only was it unable to cause any damage to Saha, but his fist was also greatly pained by the powerful recoil.Saha\u2019s body did not even sway. His punch was not affected at all and similarly headed for Chu Nan\u2019s left shoulder.Chu Nan cursed in his mind.At this moment, he could only sink his left shoulder slightly and lean back using the recoil of his fist.However, this still could not completely dodge this punch.Bang!Saha\u2019s punch firmly struck Chu Nan, and an extremely huge force assaulted him like a mountain torrent. Chu Nan\u2019s body involuntarily flew out and he fell to the ground. He rolled a few times before barely stoppingSaha did not pursue him. Instead, he waited for Chu Nan to get up and revealed a mocking smile.\u201cChu Nan, I\u2019ve seen your seventh round.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - Black Rock Turtle BreathPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySeeing that Chu Nan was actually sent flying with a punch, the audience below the stage cried out in surprise.This was the martial arts competition held by West Cloud Planet. The majority of the audience was naturally from the Earth Federation.No matter how one looked at it, Chu Nan\u2019s strength was much weaker than Saha from the Kingdom of Kexley. However, Chu Nan was still a young martial artist from the Earth Federation, so the audience would naturally support him without any hesitation.Even if not many people hoped that Chu Nan could create a miracle and defeat Saha and enter the finals, it would be too shameful to be sent flying with a punch like this.However, the difference in strength was obvious. No matter how unwilling they were, there was nothing they could do. The students of the West Cloud Academy below the stage had originally prepared their emotions. As soon as Chu Nan and Saha fought, they were prepared to cheer for him. However, before they could finish cheering, they saw Chu Nan being sent flying and forcefully swallowed the second half of their sentence.Everyone blankly looked at Chu Nan who was struggling to get up from the ground with dejected expressions.Could it be that\u2026 Chu Nan, the last hope of West Cloud Academy, would be unable to pass the last round in the end?On the stage, Saha still maintained his mocking smile. He watched as Chu Nan slowly got up and continued, \u201cI\u2019m different from my junior brother. No matter what opponent I encounter, I will treat it seriously and give it my all. Therefore, I\u2019ve carefully studied you before this competition.\u201dChu Nan took a deep breath and circulated his Internal Breath around his body. After confirming that he did not receive any internal injuries, he felt relieved and raised his head to look at Saha.\u201cWhat\u2019s the result of the research?\u201d\u201cResult?\u201d Saha smiled lightly, \u201cThe result is\u2026 Chu Nan, your true strength is far stronger than what you appear to be. In fact, you\u2019re clearly only a low-level Overlord Body Martial Artist, but you can casually use your Internal Breath in battle. Your seventh round opponent, that fool from the Phezzan Autonomous Region, was sent flying off the stage because he did not know this. Am I right?\u201dChu Nan frowned slightly.Saha was right. The reason why he could easily defeat Chloe in the seventh round was completely because he did not know him well and underestimated him too much.However, this Saha was probably stronger than Chloe now, and he did not underestimate his opponent at all. He actually valued his completely unknown opponent so much and studied him deeply. Then, it was impossible for him to use this to win.Speaking of which, not only did Saha not underestimate his opponent, Chu Nan had also underestimated his opponent.He took a deep breath and ignored Saha\u2019s question. Instead, he seriously sized up this opponent again.Even if this guy was stronger than Chloe, it was impossible for him to be much stronger. He was at most a low-level Internal Breath Martial Artist.Chloe was sent flying by his punch, but Saha received it firmly and was not injured at all. Apart from Saha not underestimating his opponent and being prepared, the cultivation method that Saha cultivated must be very special.Otherwise, even if an Internal Breath Martial Artist could casually mobilize his Internal Breath Protector, the force of Chu Nan\u2019s punch that had fused with his Internal Breath was as high as 758.682131 kilograms. It was impossible for ordinary low-level Internal Breath Martial Artists to forcefully endure it. When he thought of this, Chu Nan did not waste any time. He adjusted his breathing slightly and took a large step forward before punching Saha.The mockery in Saha\u2019s smile became deeper. As expected, he did not dodge and similarly threw a punch at Chu Nan.Bang!Chu Nan\u2019s punch struck Saha\u2019s left chest without any obstruction, and it was slightly lower than the previous spot.However, just like before, he felt as if he had struck an extremely hard rock, and his fist hurt from the powerful recoil. At this moment, Saha had already thrown a punch. Chu Nan was already prepared this time and raised his left arm to block.Bang!Chu Nan was struck in the left arm by this punch. The powerful impact that surged out from Saha\u2019s fist caused his body to fall back and he rolled a few times on the ground. Then, he propped himself up with his palm and flipped around.The audience below the stage cried out in surprise again, but their voices were still lower than before.Chu Nan had only exchanged two moves with Saha, but he had already rolled and crawled on the ground twice. It was really ugly.On the stage, Chu Nan\u2019s expression did not change and he heaved a sigh of relief. Although the force of Saha\u2019s punch was as high as 816.836293 kilograms, preventing him from resisting it with his physical body alone, and he could only rely on his rolling to deflect the force, it looked extremely ugly. However, from the data of the two exchanges, this Saha\u2019s strength was probably only at the level of a low-level Internal Breath Martial Artist, and it did not exceed much.The only thing that made Chu Nan feel troubled was the special defensive cultivation method he had. It made the punch that he had fused with his Internal Breath unable to cause any real damage to him.\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t dare to attack?\u201d Seeing that Chu Nan had fallen silent, Saha hooked his index finger at him and his expression revealed dense disdain.Seeing his appearance, Chu Nan could not help but laugh.When this Saha was below the stage, he seemed to be very humble and polite, causing others to think that his personality was completely different from his junior brother. Now, on the stage, he immediately revealed his true nature, but he was no different from Maruk.Chu Nan shook his head and quickly circulated the Nine Revolutions Technique before punching Saha again.Saha retaliated with a punch without holding back.Bang!Chu Nan\u2019s punch struck the center of Saha\u2019s left chest. At the same time, his Internal Breath happened to circulate through the meridians in his body twice to complete the Second Revolution Internal Breath. The Internal Breath attached to his fist was clearly much higher than the previous punch, and the force behind it actually exceeded 800 kilograms! Saha\u2019s body shook slightly, but he did not have any other reaction and easily received Chu Nan\u2019s punch.In order to dodge his counterattack, Chu Nan had no choice but to turn around in an extremely awkward posture and retreat miserably.\u201cChu Nan, my research on you is indeed correct.\u201d Saha still did not pursue. Instead, he stood on the spot and looked at Chu Nan with interest, \u201cYou\u2019re indeed a very special opponent. Your body is clearly still in a low-level Overlord Body state, but you can unleash an attack that\u2019s close to an initial-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist. I\u2019m very curious, how did you do it?\u201dChu Nan silently circulated the Nine Revolutions Technique and his Internal Breath circulated in his body for a cycle to confirm that his previous experiment in Martial Soul was fine.With the mere addition of the Second Revolution Internal Breath, it would not pose a huge burden to his current physical and meridians, and he would not be injured.He looked at Saha and asked with a smile, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s special about the Internal Breath cultivation method you cultivate so that you can receive my fist head-on?\u201d<b>n</b><b>r</b>Saha laughed loudly, \u201cIf you want to know the name, I can tell you. The cultivation method I cultivate is the Black Rock Turtle Breath. This is the internal cultivation method that has been evaluated as an A-rank cultivation method. There are only a few in your Earth Federation.\u201dHearing this, Chu Nan and the audience were silent.The time that the Earth Federation had joined the Milky Way was too short. In terms of martial arts inheritance, they had accumulated too little compared to the older countries of the Milky Way. The difference was extremely great. An A-rank Internal Breath cultivation method could not be considered the top-notch cultivation method, but there were indeed not many in the entire Earth Federation.The contempt for the Earth Federation was obvious from Saha\u2019s tone, but neither Chu Nan nor the audience of the Earth Federation could refute.Chu Nan was silent for a moment. Without saying anything, he took a step forward and threw another punch.Bang!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He did not even bring it with him. He only used an ordinary punch that completely relied on his physical strength. His strengthsuddenly decreased. With a mere 478.126839 kilograms, it was naturally impossible for him to cause any damage to Saha.However, this also allowed Chu Nan to have more strength to deal with Saha\u2019s counterattack. After punching out, he immediately dodged to the side and threw another punch.Bang!Saha did not even sway and allowed Chu Nan\u2019s punch to hit the lower left chest. Then, his casual punch forced Chu Nan to jump back.The difference between the two was obvious.Bang!Bang!Bang!On the stage, Chu Nan punched Saha continuously. Muffled sounds could be heard, but the Earth Federation audience below the stage had no intention of cheering. Instead, their expressions became uglier.Saha\u2019s strength was clearly much higher than Chu Nan\u2019s. In fact, even if he stood there and allowed Chu Nan to attack, he would be helpless.Under such circumstances, it was meaningless for the competition between the two of them to continue.Saha could clearly defeat Chu Nan easily, but he still maintained the current situation and fought with him. In the eyes of the audience, Chu Nan was no different from a monkey.It was one thing if Saha was not from the Kingdom of Kexley. After all, it was normal for there to be a difference in strength between martial artists. It was not his fault that Chu Nan was unable to defeat Saha.However, it just so happened that Saha came from the Kingdom of Kexley, a country that many people from the Earth Federation hated. Not only was Chu Nan unable to defeat him, he was even toyed around like amonkey by him. How could the audience endure this?\u201cThis fool! Why doesn\u2019t he just surrender!\u201d An audience member suddenly could not help but curse softly.As soon as he finished speaking, the surrounding audience were stunned before they echoed.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Instead of jumping around like a monkey and making people laugh, it\u2019s better to surrender.\u201d\u201cDamn, he clearly knows that his strength is so inferior to others, but he\u2019s still wasting time up there. Will he let other countries laugh at our Earth Federation for no reason?\u201dHearing the complaints and even low curses of the surrounding audience, the expressions of the West Cloud Academy students below the stage became extremely ugly.However, they could not refute.The situation on the stage was obvious. It was impossible for Chu Nan to defeat Saha.Under such circumstances, it was a wise choice to admit defeat readily.Even if he felt that it was very shameful to admit defeat, he should have tried his best to fight Saha and lose decisively.No matter how he looked at it, it was much better than staying up there and being mocked by Saha.However, no matter what the audience thought, they could not affect the actions of the two people on the stage.Chu Nan still punched uselessly, but Saha still had a relaxed expression. The smile on his face even became thicker, as if he was enjoying the current process.He had long made up his mind to exhaust Chu Nan like this and mock him before calmly winning this competition.\u201cSigh, that guy, Maruk, always likes to break people\u2019s arms and legs. He\u2019s simply too cruel. How can he be more artistic and elegant than me?\u201dSaha smiled as he watched Chu Nan punch again. He did not dodge and casually threw a punch back.Bang!Feeling that the force of Chu Nan\u2019s punch was slightly greater than the previous one, Saha was even more happy.\u201cHa, this Earthling is still a little unwilling to admit defeat. I like it\u2026\u201dIn the middle of all the venues of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition, there was a relatively large new building.This building was the competition center specially built by the West Cloud Planet\u2019s government to hold this martial arts competition.This 23rd floor competition center building shouldered most of the logistics support work of this martial arts competition. Almost everything related to the martial arts competition would be settled here.The underground floor was the monitoring center of the building.In the huge underground space that was more than a thousand square meters, thousands of virtual screens flickered with different images.Apart from the data monitoring at every corner of the martial arts competition, it also clearly displayed the real-time panorama of all the competitions currently underway.Two days ago, there was a need to monitor more than a thousand competitions at the same time. The pressure of the staff was naturally extremely terrifying.Now that they had already entered the ninth round of the elimination rounds, all the competition venues added up to less than a hundred rounds, the work pressure was undoubtedly much lower.However\u2026 the staff in the monitoring center still could not relax. Instead, they felt that the psychological pressure was much greater than two days ago.This pressure did not come from work or anywhere else, but from the two of them standing on the largest virtual screen in the middle of the monitoring center.Mu Yutong!Norman!Two Star-Grade Martial Artists!Today was the last day of the elimination competition. According to the arrangements of the martial arts competition\u2019s organizing committee under the West Cloud Planet\u2019s government, they had specially invited twoStar-Grade Martial Artists to visit the competition center today. Their main goal was to cooperate with the publicity for the upcoming finals of the martial arts competition.However, they did not expect that after the two Star-Grade Martial Artists entered the underground monitoring center, they would inadvertently see an ongoing competition surveillance camera. Then, they wouldactually stand together and not leave!Kabaski, the secretary of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s joint government conference and also the nominal chairman of the organizing committee for this West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition, glanced at Mu Yutongand Norman beside him and then looked at the image on the huge virtual screen in front of him, feeling puzzled.It was clearly a very ordinary elimination round for those below the age of 20. Both sides were young martial artists with the highest cultivation levels at the low-level Internal Breath realm. Why did these twoincomparably powerful Star-Grade Martial Artists focus their attention on this after unintentionally sweeping through it just now?They even specially got the staff to transfer this competition\u2019s real-time monitoring to the largest virtual screen in the center of the monitoring center and instructed them to increase the monitoring focus of thiscompetition. Clearly, they wanted to see it more clearly.Was there any value in this competition\u2026 that was worthy of these two Star-Grade Martial Artists\u2019 attention?Kabaski\u2019s personal assistant tried to silently get closer at this moment. She carefully walked to Kabaski and handed him a document.This information was related to the competition in front of him. Kabaski lowered his head and glanced at it a few times, realizing that there was indeed nothing worth paying attention to in this competition.If one had to say that there was anything worth their attention, it would be that the two sides participating in the competition were from the Earth Federation and the Kingdom of Kexley.Kabaski knew very well the conflict between the Earth Federation and the Kingdom of Kexley, as well as the hatred of the people of the Earth Federation towards them.He knew very well that this competition must be worth hyping up for those media outlets, but this should definitely not become the focus of the two Star-Grade Martial Artists.Moreover, this Star-Grade Martial Artist, Norman, was not from the Earth Federation at all\u2026At this moment, he suddenly heard Norman speak.\u201cHeh, Mu Yutong, this Chu Nan\u2026 is really as you told me before. His combat experience is so rich that he doesn\u2019t look like a kid who\u2019s not even 20 years old.\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The video playing was the real-time monitoring video of the competition between Chu Nan and Saha.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t tell?\u201dMu Yutong laughed and nodded.\u201cOf course I can see that, so I\u2019m very satisfied with his performance. However, all the more it makes me feel that it\u2019s a pity\u2026\u201d\u201cPity?\u201d Norman was stunned. He glanced at Chu Nan who was punching Saha on the large screen. In the blink of an eye, he understood and sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s indeed a pity\u2026\u201dMu Yutong also sighed softly and looked at the virtual screen with Norman again. After a moment of silence, he suddenly said, \u201cDo you want to make a bet?\u201d\u201cOh? Youre actually interested in a bet? Tell me, what do you want to bet?\u201d Norman was very excited.Mu Yutong pointed at the large screen. \u201cLet\u2019s bet on how long this kid will take to end this battle.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Norman narrowed his eyes and stared at the large screen for a few seconds before nodding.\u201d Alright. I\u2019ll bet ten minutes, what about you? \u201d\u201cT\u2019ll bet five minutes,\u201d Mu Yutong replied.Norman widened his eyes again and looked at Mu Yutong in surprise.\u201cAren\u2019t you too confident in this kid?\u201dMu Yutong smiled and did not answer.\u201cIt seems that you definitely know something about this kid that I don\u2019t. No, I have to change it. I\u2019ll bet\u2026 Eight minutes will do. In any case, it\u2019ll take a little longer than you estimated.\u201d\u201cUp to you.\u201d Mu Yutong waved his hand, \u201cAs for the bet\u2026 If l win, you\u2019ll have to stay in our Earth Federation for a month.\u201d\u201cThen, if I win, you\u2019ll have to stay in our Phezzan Autonomous Region for another month?\u201d Norman immediately asked.\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cVery good.\u201d Norman immediately turned to look at the virtual screen, \u201cAccording to the time of your Earth Federation, it\u2019s 2:09:27 PM local time. Let\u2019s start calculating from now.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMu Yutong nodded in agreement. The two of them looked at the virtual screen again with focused expressions and did not speak anymore.The people beside him heard the two Star-Grade Martial Artists speak and felt puzzled.It was already very surprising that the two of them were paying so much attention to this very ordinary competition, but they actually made a bet because of this competition!One had to know that with their status, they could not do whatever they wanted like ordinary people. Any action they took could be interpreted differently by others.Therefore, although their bet was only to stay in the other party\u2019s country for a month, the meaning it represented was extraordinary. This bet was definitely not small.In addition, the other meaning revealed in their conversation is also very concerning and confusing.It was not good for Kabaski and the other accompanying people on West Cloud Planet to ask, but the few personal disciples who had come with Mu Yutong and Norman today could not help but wonder. They looked ateach other and finally got Zheng Yuanlin to ask.\u201cTeacher, from what you said just now\u2026 could it be that you think Chu Nan can win this competition?\u201dZheng Yuanlin\u2019s question immediately attracted everyone\u2019s attention.From the current situation of the competition on the virtual screen, that young martial artist called Chu Nan was completely not the opponent of the young martial artist from the Kingdom of Kexley.ff not for his opponent teasing him, Chu Nan would have long been defeated.iow, Supremacy Mu Yutong actually thought that Chu Nan would win?Even Supremacy Norman agreed with him?This\u2026o one dared to doubt the judgment of the two Star-Grade Martial Artists, but\u2026 why?Mu Yutong turned to look at Zheng Yuanlin and saw that his eldest disciple did not have much of a puzzled expression. However, the other disciples beside him and most of the others were clearly very puzzled, so hesmiled and pointed at Chu Nan on the virtual screen.\u201cWhat do you think Chu Nan is doing now?\u201dZheng Yuanlin had followed Mu Yutong for many years and naturally understood his intentions. He immediately said, \u201cI feel that\u2026 Chu Nan is completely being toyed with by his opponent. If it was me, it\u2019s better toadmit defeat.\u201dThis sentence voiced everyone\u2019s thoughts.When they saw Chu Nan, a young martial artist from the Earth Federation, being played like a monkey by the martial artist of the Kingdom of Kexley, everyone from the Earth Federation felt unhappy.Although Chu Nan\u2019s spirit of not giving up was worth praising, it was meaningless to persist like this. It was better to admit defeat and be more straightforward.\u201cAdmit defeat?\u201d Mu Yutong deliberately made a surprised expression, \u201cWhy does he have to admit defeat? Chu Nan is clearly looking for his opponent\u2019s weakness bit by bit. In my opinion, he will succeed soon and winthis competition. How can he lose?\u201dThe surrounding crowd could not help but be in an uproar.Chu Nan was looking for his opponent\u2019s weakness? How could they not see it?From the scene on the virtual screen, Chu Nan was only jumping around Saha like a monkey. Even if he punched him again and again, it was useless.\u201cHe\u2019s finding his opponent\u2019s weakness? How can he find it?\u201d Zheng Yuanlin asked on behalf of everyone.\u201cYou should be able to tell that Chu Nan\u2019s fist strength is actually not weak, but this Saha was able to withstand so many of Chu Nan\u2019s punches without being injured. Clearly, he has cultivated a special defensivecultivation method.\u201dZheng Yuanlin and the disciples beside him nodded.\u201cChu Nan\u2019s fist strength is unable to break through Saha\u2019s defense, so he naturally can\u2019t win. However, no matter what kind of defensive cultivation method it is, due to the limitations of the human body, it\u2019s impossibleto protect every inch of his body. There must be weaknesses. In the traditional martial arts of our Earth Federation, these weaknesses are usually called \u2018Achilles\u2019 heel\u2019.\u201dZheng Yuanlin\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cTeacher, you mean that Chu Nan is currently looking for the Achilles\u2019 heel to Saha\u2019s defensive technique?\u201d Immediately, he revealed a puzzled expression, \u201cHow will he find it?\u201dMu Yutong turned to look at Chu Nan on the large screen and revealed a smile.\u201cThis kid is using a very stupid but effective method.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cWhat you saw was that every punch he threw hit Saha was useless, but did you pay attention to the landing point of his fist?\u201dEveryone focused their gazes on Chu Nan on the large screen and happened to see him punch out. Saha did not dodge again and this punch firmly struck the left ribs of Saha\u2019s waist.Bang!A muffled sound sounded through the large screen. On the screen, Saha did not even frown. Even the obvious disdain and mocking smile on his face did not change. Clearly, Chu Nan\u2019s punch did not pose any threat tohim.After punching out, Chu Nan immediately adjusted his body and slid to the side. While avoiding Saha\u2019s counterattack, he threw another punch and accurately struck the left ribs of Saha\u2019s waist.At first glance, these two punches seemed to have struck the same place, but if one looked carefully, they would discover that the landing point of this punch was slightly lower than the previous punch.The scene of the competition that he had seen through the large screen quickly flashed through Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s mind. He recalled Chu Nan\u2019s actions and his expression changed.\u201cTeacher, are you saying that\u2026 Chu Nan is currently using his fist to investigate the location of the Achilles\u2019 heel on Saha?\u201dSeeing that his eldest disciple understood so quickly, Mu Yutong smiled and nodded.The surrounding people gasped.If Chu Nan was really as Mu Yutong had said and was not being toyed with by Saha as a monkey and was simply probing the Achilles\u2019 heel on Saha\u2019s body bit by bit, then his combat awareness would be too terrifying.Zheng Yuanlin frowned slightly and looked at the large screen. He discovered that two minutes had passed since the bet between Mu Yutong and Norman. However, the situation on the arena had not changed. Hecould not help but show a trace of worry.Although Chu Nan\u2019s thoughts were correct, he was only a low-level Overlord Body Martial Artist after all. Could he last until that moment?Or would Saha give him a chance to persist until that moment?.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, he took an additional step back, stopped, and took a deep breath.Although the battle with Saha had only lasted for less than five minutes, the two sides had already exchanged punches and kicks more than hundreds of times. His fists and kicks had landed on Saha\u2019s body more than200 times without any fancy moves.Such an intense battle had greatly exhausted his physical strength. If not for the abundant combat experience he had obtained in the virtual space allowing him to more efficiently utilize his physical strength, he wouldprobably not have been able to endure it now.\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t do it anymore?\u201d When he saw Chu Nan panting, the mocking smile on Saha\u2019s face became stronger, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t have to be anxious. Rest well before attacking again. In any case, this is the lastmatch today. We have enough time to slowly fight.\u201dWhen such an arrogant sentence landed in the ears of the audience below the stage, it immediately caused them to curse again.However, the situation displayed on the stage was that Chu Nan could not do anything to Saha, causing their curses to appear weak.Chu Nan ignored the reactions of Saha and the audience below the stage. After calming his breathing, his gaze slowly swept the opponent\u2019s entire body.After more than 200 attacks, his punches and kicks had nearly covered every part of Saha\u2019s body. Only three places could not be touched. They were the slightly lower part of the heart, the center of the abdomen, andthe vital points below the abdomen.Saha seemed to be extremely defensive in these three places. When Chu Nan\u2019s fist approached a few times, Saha would slightly move his body and allow his fist to land elsewhere without hitting it.Compared to not dodging Chu Nan\u2019s other attacks, Saha\u2019s abnormal reaction undoubtedly proved his guess.Chu Nan did not know about the so-called Achilles\u2019 heel, but with his experience in fighting Internal Breath Martial Artists countless times in the virtual space, he knew that it was impossible for a low-level InternalBreath Martial Artist to spread his Internal Breath throughout his body at any time.Internal Breath circulated throughout all the meridians in his body. This was a sign that he was infinitely close to becoming a Void Break Martial Artist. If he took another step, he could complete the fusion of the insideand outside and reach the realm of tearing through the air, becoming a true Void Break Martial Artist.This Saha was clearly still far from this realm, so it was impossible for his Black Rock Turtle Breath to protect all parts of his body.After the battle earlier, Chu Nan could basically confirm that the weakness in Saha\u2019s body should be at the three positions that he had yet to attack.The problem now was how to attack those three positions under Saha\u2019s defense.Chu Nan quickly calculated in his mind before rushing forward and punching Saha.Saha chuckled and casually threw a punch back.The location of Chu Nan\u2019s punch initially chose the left chest of Saha. When he saw that Saha had counterattacked, he suddenly flipped his wrist and his fist tilted slightly to the left before landing on the heart of Saha\u2019schest.In the previous 200 plus attacks, Chu Nan had once aimed at this place, but he was dodged by Saha. This time, he was no exception. When he saw Chu Nan\u2019s fist change direction and his body turn left, while avoidingChu Nan\u2019s punch, it also caused the counterattack of his right fist to speed up.However, Chu Nan had already made preparations in advance this time. The moment Saha turned around, he took a wrong step and his body forcefully shifted to the right, allowing his right fist to catch up to the speedat which Saha\u2019s body was spinning.Bang!This punch landed on the heart of Saha\u2019s chest.Saha frowned slightly. His counterattack fist suddenly increased in strength and speed.In order to hit Saha\u2019s heart, Chu Nan had forcefully changed his move. At this moment, he had nearly exhausted his remaining strength, so he naturally could not easily dodge this punch.Fortunately, he was already mentally prepared and used his data ability to calculate Saha\u2019s counterattack in advance. While hitting the location of Saha\u2019s heart, he borrowed the recoil and kicked his feet, causing hisbody to fall back. Then, he rolled on the ground a few times and escaped the range of Saha.After seeing Chu Nan punch Saha again, he rolled away in an abnormally sorry state, but the audience below the stage did not feel anything.They had already seen this situation countless times and were already close to numbness.Chu Nan stood up from the ground with a trace of joy in his eyes.When the punch struck the location of Saha\u2019s heart, the recoil was clearly much weaker than before. It was enough to prove that the defense of Saha\u2019s Black Rock Turtle Breath was clearly inferior to the other parts ofhis body. It further proved that Chu Nan\u2019s guess was correct.Of course, this was not enough to make Chu Nan feel assured.Although Chu Nan did not attach any Internal Breath to his punch just now, the force behind it was still as high as 418.379619 kilograms.However, after receiving this punch, Saha was still unharmed. At most, his reaction was a little more intense than the other parts.This proved that the location of the heart was not his true weakness. At most, it was slightly weaker.Just this was not enough for Chu Nan to defeat him.When he thought of this, Chu Nan did not stop. He widened his feet and rushed forward again before punching out.The target of this punch was still the heart of Saha\u2019s chest, and it had been attached to his Internal Breath in advance. As soon as his fist struck out, there was a muffled bang, as if it had shattered the air.For the first time since the battle, the expression on Saha\u2019s face changed.When he saw Chu Nan\u2019s punch, he no longer maintained his disdainful and mocking smile. Instead, for the first time, he revealed a trace of caution.When Chu Nan\u2019s fist approached, Saha raised his left arm to protect his chest and counterattacked with his right fist.This was the first time he had taken the initiative to defend and not allow Chu Nan\u2019s fist to land on his body.Bang!Chu Nan\u2019s punch struck Saha\u2019s left arm that was protecting his chest.However, although Chu Nan\u2019s punch looked extremely shocking, when it struck Saha\u2019s left arm, the actual force was only 237.179218 kilograms. To Saha, it was light and powerless.Saha\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Before he could react, he saw Chu Nan\u2019s right arm bend and his body moved even closer. It was as if he had collided into Saha\u2019s arms.At the same time, Chu Nan\u2019s left fist reached out at an extremely strange angle and accurately struck the area of Saha\u2019s lower abdomen.Bang!The place where Chu Nan truly used his Internal Breath was his left fist. Although this punch was rushed, the force behind it was as high as 652.128391 kilograms.When Saha\u2019s dantian was struck by this abnormally powerful punch, his expression immediately changed. He exhaled and roared. The counterattack landed on Chu Nan\u2019s left shoulder, sending him flying. He could nothelp but take a step back..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was the first time he moved his body, but he retreated.When the audience below the stage saw this change, they were immediately stunned.Chu Nan had actually forced this guy to retreat?That was great!However, their happy mood only lasted for a moment.In the next moment, when they saw Chu Nan fly out in the air and roll on the ground a few more times, he actually opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood. The trace of excitement and joy that had justsurged in the hearts of the audience immediately dissipated.What joy?!Chu Nan had worked hard for a long time, but he had only forced the other party to take a step back while he paid the price of being heavily injured.n the end, he could not win!Chu Nan stood up and wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth before laughing bitterly.tt could not be helped. In the end, he was only a low-level Overlord Body Martial Artist. The degree of tempering of his body was far inferior to an Internal Breath expert like Saha. Be it strength, speed, or musclestrength, he was far inferior.Although he had already known all the detailed data regarding Saha\u2019s punch earlier, due to his physical ability, it was impossible for him to completely dodge it. He was still struck by the punch.However, relying on his powerful data ability, he could still choose a method to reduce his injuries as much as possible. Therefore, although this punch caused him to be forced to spit out a mouthful of blood and suffersome internal injuries, it was actually not serious and would not affect the battle for the time being.Moreover, he had achieved his goal in the confrontation just now.From Saha\u2019s reaction, the defense of the dantian was clearly much weaker than the heart.However, this was still not enough.Chu Nan had already used his Internal Breath in the punch earlier, but it only forced Saha to take a step back and did not cause any fatal damage to him.According to the situation just now, if the target was the dantian, then it was probably impossible to hit it with every punch.If he wanted to achieve this, he had to do it like before.However, it was obvious that Saha was unwilling to give Chu Nan this chance. When he saw Chu Nan get up from the ground, he took a step forward and the smile on his face disappeared. He said in a deep voice, \u201cChuNan, it seems that I still underestimated my opponent. I admit that you\u2019re much stronger than I estimated. From now on, I\u2019ll treat you as an equal opponent. Then\u2026 take this!\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, Saha had already bounced up and shot towards Chu Nan like a cannonball. He threw a punch and the wind roared.The audience below the stage was immediately shocked.Earlier, Saha\u2019s defense was as stable as a mountain and as hard as a rock. Now, the first time he took the initiative to attack, he immediately became as fast as lightning. The change in style was truly shocking.However, when Chu Nan saw Saha\u2019s terrifying attack, he revealed a relaxed smile.If Saha still stood on the spot and adopted a stable defense and counterattack, then even if he could find an opportunity to hit Saha\u2019s vital points, he would have to pay a huge price.Now that he had taken the initiative to attack, it was impossible for him to defend steadily like before and not leave any flaws. Instead, Chu Nan could find more opportunities.With a glance, Chu Nan had already recalled all the detailed data of Saha\u2019s punch. He only easily tilted his body and avoided his attack.Of course, Saha\u2019s attack was not that simple. After punching out, he turned around and his other fist quietly followed.However, Chu Nan seemed to have predicted this. He twisted his body lightly and easily dodged again.In the blink of an eye, Saha had already attacked dozens of times, but they were all easily dodged by Chu Nan.The audience below the stage were stunned.When Chu Nan attacked earlier, he was almost helpless against Saha, causing the audience to feel despair. They did not expect that after the change in defense, an Internal Breath expert like Saha would actually behelpless against Chu Nan. It really surprised them.Moreover, it was different from when Chu Nan attacked with every punch. When Saha attacked, he could not even touch Chu Nan.In comparison, Chu Nan was even more elegant and relaxed. He seemed to be superior than Saha.Saha threw another punch but was easily dodged by Chu Nan again. He could not help but snort.\u201cLet\u2019s see how long you can hide for!\u201dSaha\u2019s fist sank. Be it the speed of his punch or his movement technique, they were even faster than before.In the end, Chu Nan was only a low-level Overlord Body Martial Artist. The degree of tempering of his body was far inferior to Saha, an Internal Breath Realm expert. Now that Saha was attacking with all his might,although he could instantly determine the angle of Saha\u2019s punch with his powerful data ability and dodge it in advance, he gradually felt a little powerless.Feeling that his stamina was quickly draining, Chu Nan knew that if he allowed this situation to continue, he would soon be unable to dodge Saha\u2019s attack because of his stamina.Seeing that Saha was about to punch again, he took a step back. While avoiding this punch, he suddenly raised his right foot and ruthlessly landed.Boom!Arock on the ground of the arena was forcefully shattered. Countless sand and rocks mixed with dust were sent flying by this stomp and enveloped Chu Nan and Saha.At the same time, Chu Nan had already thrown a punch at Saha\u2019s dantian.With his powerful data ability, even though his vision was blurred by the sand and dust, Chu Nan\u2019s punch was still abnormally precise without any deviation.\u201cHmph\u201d From the dust, Saha grunted, but he did not dare to continue attacking. Instead, he protected his dantian and retreated to dodge Chu Nan\u2019s punch.A moment later, the dust settled and the vision between the two returned to normal.Saha glanced at Chu Nan and the corners of his mouth curled into a sneer.\u201cWhat? You want to rely on such a childish thing to defeat me? Aren\u2019t you too naive?\u201dChu Nan shook his head and ignored it. He leaned forward and threw a punch.Saha did not stand on the spot to defend like before. When he saw Chu Nan attacking, he did not hesitate to charge forward and punch him as well.In just a few moments, Chu Nan was completely suppressed by Saha and had no choice but to retreat under his attacks.Seeing this situation, even if the audience below the stage did not know anything about martial arts, they could already tell that Chu Nan\u2019s defeat was only a matter of time.His attack was completely itchy for Saha, but he could not endure Saha\u2019s attack at all.Under such an unequal situation, it was impossible for Chu Nan to win.When he was exhausted and could not dodge Saha\u2019s attack, what awaited him was failure, or even serious injuries.However, when they thought about it, with Chu Nan\u2019s low-level Overlord Body strength, it was already quite good for him to be able to force an Internal Breath Martial Artist with extraordinary strength like Saha tothis extent. The trace of dissatisfaction they had for Chu Nan had long disappeared.However, Chu Nan, who was on the stage, did not have the awareness that he was about to be defeated. He still tried his best to dodge Saha\u2019s attack.As he hid, Chu Nan stared at the spot under Saha\u2019\u2019s feet and silently calculated the distance between him and a certain location.3.787136 meters.2.986371 meters.2.396183 meters.1.072962 meters.Perfect!Now!A glint flashed through Chu Nan\u2019s eyes and he suddenly stopped. He no longer dodged and instead threw a punch at the dantian of Saha\u2019s abdomen.Saha originally wanted to take a large step forward and punch Chu Nan flying. Now that he saw that Chu Nan actually dared to counterattack, he immediately laughed. His footsteps slowed down and he prepared toeasily block Chu Nan\u2019s punch before taking advantage of this opportunity to deal with him.Unexpectedly, just as his right foot landed, he stepped on air and his body involuntarily fell to the right.\u201cOh no!\u201dJust as Saha cried out in his mind, Chu Nan\u2019s left foot had already kicked over extremely quickly. The foot that contained the powerful Second Revolution Internal Breath accurately kicked between Saha\u2019s legs.Crack!As if an egg had shattered, Saha let out an earth-shattering scream. His entire body bounced up as if it was filled with springs. Then, as if he had lost all his strength, he fell to the ground like a pile of mud.Chu Nan took a step forward and kicked again without holding back, sending Saha, who had lost all his strength to resist, flying and landing outside the arena..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They did not expect that in the blink of an eye, Chu Nan would actually make Saha lose all hisability to resist with a kick and easily win this competition.This\u2026 this was too ridiculous!When they recalled how Chu Nan\u2019s kick had heavily kicked Saha\u2019s important part, the expressions of the audience became strange.Thinking about it, it made sense. No matter how much an Internal Breath expert Saha was, no matter how much he had a powerful A-rank martial technique that specially increased his defense, the defense of thatbody part would definitely be low.The force behind Chu Nan\u2019s kick was more than 500 kilograms. If Saha was still unharmed after being kicked like this, it would be unreasonable.Among the West Cloud Academy students who came to cheer for Chu Nan in the audience, the expressions of the second grade students became even stranger.n the previous qualification competition, Chu Nan had unexpectedly defeated the number one expert of the second grade, Luo Li, and kicked his vital points to obtain victory.Chu Nan\u2019s performance even made Andre nearly announce his forfeit because he was worried that he would be kicked by Chu Nan.iow, Chu Nan had actually used this move in front of thousands of spectators in such a competition!Moreover, his opponent was a powerful Internal Breath Martial Artist!Dong Fang looked at Chu Nan on the stage and the corners of his mouth could not help but twitch twice. He looked as if he wanted to laugh but did not know how to.Earlier, this fellow had said that his nickname could be called \u2018Descendant Slayer\u2019 merely because he was joking. Unexpectedly, he actually took this kick as his ultimate move now?On the other side of the audience, Yang Xirui\u2019s expression was also extremely strange.The first time she noticed Chu Nan was because he happened to win in the competition scene she reported and kicked his opponent\u2019s vital part, causing her to feel a little awkward.Now, he had actually used such a method to obtain victory again, causing her to be at a loss for what to do.When she recalled that Miss Tang Xiaoyou, who was acting as a guest in the broadcast room at that time, had even criticized Chu Nan\u2019s actions for being too despicable and violating the basic morals of martial artists,Yang Xirui could not help but smile bitterly.If Chu Nan, a low-level Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist, faced a powerful Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist like Saha head-on like Tang Xiaoyou had said, there was definitely no possibility of winning.Only by doing something like this that seemed a little\u2026 special could he barely obtain victory. Otherwise, he would be defeated sooner or later.Therefore, criticizing Chu Nan for his despicable actions and violating the basic morals of a martial artist was completely meaningless.However, what happened in that instant?Why did Saha\u2019s feet suddenly turn soft when he was clearly fine, causing a flaw to appear and allow Chu Nan to grab this opportunity to kick his vital points?\u201cBeautiful!\u201dPraise sounded in the underground monitoring room at the competition center.\u201cToo beautiful!\u201d Norman clapped his hands hard and looked at Chu Nan on the virtual screen, not hiding his praise for him, \u201cNo wonder you noticed him. Mu Yutong, this kid is simply too surprising!\u201dMu Yutong shook his head and sighed, \u201cThe better he performs, the more I feel that it\u2019s a pity.\u201dNorman laughed and waved his hand, \u201cAlright, we\u2019ve pitied him enough just now. It\u2019s useless to continue feeling sad for him. Now, we only need to admire the exciting competition he brought us.\u201dAfter a pause, he frowned.\u201cHowever, this kid is still unsatisfactory\u2026\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Mu Yutong looked at him in surprise, \u201cWhat makes you dissatisfied?\u201dNorman pointed at the time on the virtual screen.\u201cLook, it\u2019s already 2:18 PM, it\u2019s just a little longer than the eight minutes I said. Seriously, if he didn\u2019t waste time talking to his opponent, I\u2019d have won.\u201dMu Yutong laughed.\u201cYou can\u2019t blame him. His opponent really likes to talk nonsense.\u201dAfter saying that, he turned to look at Mu Yutong and the disciples he had brought behind him and asked, \u201cDo you understand now?\u201dSeveral disciples looked at Chu Nan on the large screen with admiration on their faces.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed an exciting competition,\u201d a disciple sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s really surprising that Chu Nan could defeat an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Internal Breath Martial Artists should clearly be able to crush Overlord Body Martial Artists in all aspects, but Chu Nan was able to persist in front of this Saha for so long and even grasped the only flaw theother party revealed in the end. It\u2019s really surprising.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not only that.\u201d Zheng Yuanlin shook his head and pointed at the large screen. \u201cSaha did not have any flaws himself. Instead, he fell into Chu Nan\u2019s trap from the beginning to the end and was forced to exposethis flaw.\u201dThe other disciples were shocked.\u201cNo way? Senior Brother Zheng, could it be that you mean that the last strike was not an accident?\u201dUnlike most of the audience at the side of the competition who did not practice martial arts themselves, the disciples of these two Supremacies were powerful experts. Of course, they could see everything thathappened at the last moment clearly.In their opinion, Chu Nan\u2019s sudden counterattack was actually a little rash. However, Saha suddenly made a mistake at this moment, causing him to be unable to maintain his figure and expose a flaw.However, Chu Nan\u2019s ability to grasp opportunities was extremely strong. In less than a tenth of a second, he had already kicked Saha\u2019s vital points and obtained victory.Just this alone was enough to prove how powerful Chu Nan\u2019s combat awareness was and was worthy of the praise of the two Star-Grade Martial Artists and everyone else.However, if it was said that the last mistake of Saha was also a meticulously designed trap by Chu Nan, it would be too unbelievable.\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d Zheng Yuanlin smiled and turned to look at the staff on the other side, gesturing for them to replay the recording of the competition.When the recording returned to the time when Chu Nan stomped on the ground and raised the dust, Zheng Yuanlin gestured for a pause. Then, he got the staff to adjust the direction of the camera and change it fromflat view to overlooking.\u201cWatch the ground carefully.\u201dThe other disciples looked carefully and discovered that because of Chu Nan\u2019s kick, a pit had been created in the originally flat ground.\u201cNo way!\u201d A disciple suddenly cried out in surprise.Zheng Yuanlin smiled and looked at him. \u201cIt seems that you\u2019ve guessed it.\u201dAfter saying that, he continued to let the staff play the recording and requested to look at it from above.A moment later, the recording was already at the last part.From his angle, he could clearly see Chu Nan retreating step by step. However, he was not panicking and choosing the path he wanted to take. Instead, it was obvious that he was gradually approaching the pit on theground. Saha was also brought over by him.After Chu Nan took a step back from the pit, Saha took a large step forward. Just as he was about to cross the pit, Chu Nan happened to punch out at this moment and aimed at the vital part, forcing him to temporarilystop and prepare for defense.However, this time, his right foot landed accurately in the pit.This time, Saha clearly did not expect it at all. His foot stepped on the side, and his body naturally tilted.Therefore, the flaw was revealed, but Chu Nan accurately grasped this opportunity and kicked the vital part of his lower body.Seeing this, the disciples could not help but gasp, their faces filled with surprise.Zheng Yuanlin gestured for the staff to replay the last recording a few times and asked the few of them, \u201cNow, do you still think that the last scene was a simple mistake?\u201dThe disciples looked at each other and saw the shock in each other\u2019s eyes that could not be hidden.\u201cThis Chu Nan\u2026 why is he only a low-level Overlord Body Martial Artist?\u201dZheng Yuanlin sighed and turned to look at Mu Yutong.Mu Yutong nodded lightly before turning to Norman, \u201cHow is it? Are you interested in my suggestion after watching Chu Nan\u2019s competition?\u201dNorman stared at Chu Nan who had already frozen on the virtual screen. He pondered for a moment and slowly nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had no choice but to leave the venue early and rush to the logistics rehabilitation center.Although he did not suffer any serious injuries in the battle with Saha in the afternoon, he had been punched by Saha several times and even spat out blood because of it. Chu Nan still felt his muscles sore and even hisbones were aching.He did not dare to guarantee that he would not leave any hidden injuries, so it was naturally best to properly check.\u201cStudent No. S278309451. Hello, Student Chu Nan. Welcome to the rehabilitation data center. Please choose the service you need.\u201d\u201cFull body checkup, muscle recovery, X-ray vision test, data analysis report, and put on some news.\u201dWhen he heard the steady female voice of the mainframe A.I., Chu Nan gave the same answer as when he arrived here a few days ago.\u201cAlright, a full-body checkup, muscle recovery, X-ray vision test, data analysis report, and live news broadcast. Academy Chu Nan, you\u2019ve chosen these five services. Please answer after confirming.\u201d\u201cConfirm.\u201dSeeing the light screen flash in front of him, the mainframe A.I. started to work, and a large pile of random equipment surrounded him.Chu Nan looked around and pondered.The powerful data ability he had obtained now was clearly from this A.I. of the rehabilitation center and west. However, why did this A.I. allow him to obtain such an ability?Or was this purely an accident?After that, Chu Nan had come here a few times, but he did not enter the magical virtual space again. He also did not have the chance to successfully converse with the mysterious voice that should represent the mainprocessor.When he recalled the situation at that time, Chu Nan felt that the mainframe A.I. of this data center had probably long left the category of ordinary computers and A. and possessed extraordinary intelligence.Otherwise, even if it took the initiative to activate the emergency mode due to the program\u2019s settings, it would be impossible for it to converse with Chu Nan in the virtual space in a humane manner.Of course, when he recalled that the West Cloud Academy had bought this mainframe A.I. from the Noctem Chamber of Commerce at a high price, Chu Nan did not find it strange.The Noctem Chamber of Commerce represented the highest level of technology in the entire Milky Way. Even the Declan Empire, which occupied more than half of the Orion Arm and had a legacy that exceeded morethan ten thousand years, and the Erehuana Military Treaty Alliance, which controlled almost the entire Perseus Arm, were inferior in this aspect.As for the Earth Federation, a remote small country that had only emerged in the star system for less than 700 years, it was naturally much inferior.Chu Nan was not surprised that the Noctem Chamber of Commerce had grasped any super technology that he could not understand.\u201cThis should be considered a fortuitous encounter in those novels, right?\u201d Chu Nan had a thought and decided to give up thinking about these meaningless questions.At this moment, the virtual screen in front of him flashed and the real-time news report began to broadcast. A familiar figure appeared on the screen.\u201cHello everyone, this is the live report of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s Martial Artist Competition brought to you by the Federation\u2019s Information Martial Arts World Channel. I\u2019m the live reporter, Yang Xirui.\u201d\u201cThis afternoon, the ninth round of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition has ended. It\u2019s also the competition for the last round of the preliminaries. According to the post-match statistics, the martial artistswho successfully passed the preliminaries and entered the final stage are from 13 countries and the Earth Federation.\u201cAmong them, the adult group has a total of 64 martial artists who have entered the final stage. Among them, 17 are martial artists from the Earth Federation, accounting for 26.56% of all participating martial artists. Inthe group below the age of 20, the total number of martial artists who have entered the final stage is 32. Among them, martial artists from the Earth Federation\u2026\u201dAt this point, Yang Xirui paused for a moment before continuing.\u201c\u2026There are only six in total, and they only account for 18.75% of all the participating martial artists.\u201d\u201cRegarding this situation, the various worlds of the federation have expressed their interest. We have also contacted the Star-Grade Martial Artist, Mu Yutong, who came to the scene today. He did not voice a directopinion on this, but he said that he will accept our interview with another Star-Grade Martial Artist, Norman. In a while, we will bring you two Star-Grade Martial Artists\u2019 interviews. Please pay attention.\u201dSeeing this, Chu Nan was a little surprised.As a Star-Grade Martial Artist of the Earth Federation, it was one thing for Supremacy Mu Yutong to receive an exclusive interview with the federation. Why would a Star-Grade Martial Artist from the PhezzanAutonomous Region like Norman accept the interview as well?However, on second thought, Chu Nan discovered that it was not his problem and gave up on thinking.However, when he saw Yang Xirui\u2019s expression when he said that the two Star-Grade Martial Artists would accept the interview, Chu Nan felt a little amused.This young beauty had previously repeatedly hoped that he would accept her interview. Now that she was able to directly interview two powerful Star-Grade Martial Artists, she had probably forgotten about him, amere Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, according to the results of your physical examination, I suggest that you receive the following three treatments. They are muscle activity stimulation, blood vessel\u2026\u201dBefore the mainframe A.I. could finish speaking, Chu Nan had already waved his hand.\u201cAlright, there\u2019s no need to say anything else. I\u2019ll confirm it.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dA moment later, several devices that were like probes stretched out beside Chu Nan and stuck to all his joints.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, I\u2019m about to begin the muscle activity stimulation of your entire body. Please relax and maintain your calm.\u201d\u201cYes, let\u2019s begin.\u201dAfter Chu Nan agreed, a trace of something that was like an electric current spread out from several cameras, causing every joint of his body to feel a little sore.Then, this weak electric current spread out from every joint and entered every part of Chu Nan\u2019s body.Soon, Chu Nan felt all the muscles in his body pulsing slightly. It was as if he had exercised with all his might for a few hours and all the muscles in his body were used. Even his every pore opened slightly.Chu Nan was very familiar with this so-called full-body muscle activity stimulation. It was very effective in healing muscles after high-intensity exercise.He had been struck by countless punches in the afternoon battle and caused a large amount of muscle damage. Using this therapy would allow him to recover very well.Not only that, the students of West Cloud Academy often practiced battles. Even if they were not injured, it would often cause their muscles to be extremely exhausted. Therefore, it was a common method for thestudents to use this treatment to recover their muscles. Even an initial-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist like Chu Nan would often use it.Feeling the soreness and numbness begin to surge through every inch of his muscles and even every cell, Chu Nan suddenly thought of a problem..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 - Why Not Create It MyselfPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTo a martial artist, putting aside the initial-stage knowledge of martial techniques, the first stage that needed to be experienced was the Overlord Body Realm.Specifically, the so-called Overlord Body was actually to continuously temper the body and increase the various skills in the body. For example, muscle strength, reaction speed, bone strength, resistance to attacks, and so on.Under normal circumstances, martial artists would choose an internal cultivation method to cultivate. When you were able to successfully mobilize the Internal Breath in your dantian through this internal cultivation method and use it to strengthen your body, it meant that you had officially stepped through the door of martial arts and could be considered an initial-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist.The previous Chu Nan was at this stage.If he wanted to continue rising in the initial-stage Overlord Body realm, he could only persist in cultivating the Internal Breath cultivation method and continuously use his Internal Breath to strengthen and refine his body.When the body was tempered to a certain extent, the Internal Breath would also be powerful to a certain extent. If one could circulate Internal Breath in their entire body at will and unleash their intent as they pleased, it meant that they had officially stepped from the Overlord Body Realm to the Internal Breath Realm.Although Chu Nan could rely on his powerful data ability to calculate all the changes in his moves in advance and circulate the Nine Revolutions Technique in advance to mobilize his Internal Breath, allowing his Internal Breath to perfectly match the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist and attach Internal Breath to his fist in battle, strictly speaking, he was still not a true Internal Breath Martial Artist.The reason was very simple. He was still unable to casually circulate his Internal Breath to any part of his body. He could only mobilize it according to the trajectory of the Internal Breath cultivated by the Nine Revolutions Technique and cooperate with the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist to increase its power.If he was a true Internal Breath Martial Artist, it would not be so troublesome. As long as he wanted to mobilize his Internal Breath in battle, he could use it at any time. The fundamental reason for this difference was the huge difference in the degree of tempering between an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist and an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist.The problem that Chu Nan was considering now was what the exact difference displayed by this so-called \u201cbody tempering\u201d was. If it was in terms of muscle strength, there was undoubtedly an extremely huge difference between Chu Nan and an Internal Breath Martial Artist who had already passed the Overlord Body realm and had completed the initial refinement of the body. He was even clearly inferior to a fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist like Luo Li.For example, Luo Li could easily achieve 3-400 kilograms with a casual punch. Chu Nan had to use his powerful data ability to mobilize every muscle in his body and perfectly cooperate in order to allow his pure fist strength to break through 400 kilograms.However, this was clearly not enough to cause the most important difference between Chu Nan and an Internal Breath Martial Artist. The key was still the difference between the two sides in using their Internal Breath.In the battle with Saha in the afternoon, if Chu Nan\u2019s every punch could contain Internal Breath, even if Saha had a special and extremely defensive Internal Breath cultivation method like the Black Rock Turtle Breath, it was impossible for him to take so many of Chu Nan\u2019s punches without any injuries.However, it was obvious that Chu Nan could not do this.Firstly, his Internal Breath was far from enough to support him mobilizing his Internal Breath with every punch.Although he had already broken through to the third level of the Nine Revolutions Technique and his Internal Breath had greatly increased, the strength of Chu Nan\u2019s current Internal Breath was at most that of a low-level Overlord Body Martial Artist.With the special trait of the Nine Revolutions Technique, he could mobilize a powerful Internal Breath that was even comparable to low-level Internal Breath Realm experts.However, it was fine to do this once or twice. In fact, according to his experiment, it was not a problem to do this more than ten times. However, if in the battle with Saha in the afternoon, hundreds of punches were filled with Internal Breath, that was impossible. Therefore, in the battle in the afternoon, other than the first two punches and the few critical moments after that, Chu Nan only relied on his physical strength to fight Saha.Secondly, Chu Nan was unable to successfully mobilize his Internal Breath with every punch.The reason why he was able to successfully mobilize his Internal Breath to assist him when cultivating the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist was because the fist technique was indeed very outstanding. Every punch could successfully mobilize the muscles and meridians in his entire body, allowing him to use the Nine Revolutions Technique to fuse his Internal Breath.However, if he could not use the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist, it would be very difficult for the Nine Revolutions Technique to be circulated perfectly. Since his Internal Breath could not be fused, he naturally could not mobilize his Internal Breath.He had not paid much attention to this when he was practicing previously, but the battle with Saha today made him pay attention to this problem. The pressure brought about by an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist was too great. Even if he had the support of a powerful data ability, it was impossible for him to ensure that he could perfectly unleash the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist every time. Therefore, he could not guarantee that every punch contained Internal Breath, so the threat to an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist would definitely be much smaller.If it was said that Chu Nan did not understand this problem in the past, after sparring with that unknown senior and being pointed out the difference between the Internal Breath cultivation method and the Internal Breath circulation method, he had a certain understanding now.In the end, he lacked an Internal Breath circulation method that could complement the Nine Revolutions Technique. His Internal Breath was not strong enough, so it was naturally impossible for him to casually mobilize his Internal Breath in battle.If he could do it, he would be an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist.\u201cBut what about that kick in the afternoon?\u201d The last kick that ended the battle with Saha in the afternoon flashed through Chu Nan\u2019s mind.The last move was a meticulously designed trap. Originally, he only wanted to try and kick Saha\u2019s vital points. Perhaps he could find the greatest weakness of Saha\u2019s Black Rock Internal Breath.However, he did not expect that when he kicked out, the Internal Breath that had circulated in the Sitting Horse Rush Fist, which had just cooperated with that move to hit the vital part of Saha\u2019s dantian, happened to flow along the trajectory of the Nine Revolutions Technique to his left leg and flow to the tip of his foot. As a result, the force of his kick was as high as 793.712866 kilograms, directly crushing Saha.This puzzled Chu Nan.What was the Internal Breath circulation method that that unknown senior mentioned?If circulating his Internal Breath required a cultivation method to mobilize it, then wouldn\u2019t circulating the Nine Revolutions Technique with the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist be a cultivation method for circulating Internal Breath?The most important thing was that the last kick had nothing to do with the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist. However, he could follow the situation at that time and circulate his Internal Breath to his foot to bring out his Internal Breath.This\u2026 should be considered a method to control the circulation of Internal Breath, right?In the end, when cultivating the Nine Revolutions Technique, wasn\u2019t it just controlling the process of Internal Breath circulating in the body?\u201cTherefore, the so-called Internal Breath circulation method is not strange at all. It\u2019s only to change the trajectory when circulating the Internal Breath? In that case, why can\u2019t I create it myself?\u201dChu Nan glanced at the busy sensors on his body and glanced at the exquisite and complicated equipment in the surrounding logistics rehabilitation center. He did not hesitate and directly jumped up.\u201cWarning, Student Chu Nan, your muscle activity stimulation has only reached 78%. Please lie down and continue your treatment.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d Chu Nan waved his hand, \u201cA.I., I want you to test my physical condition at any time. If I encounter any danger, treat me immediately.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The female voice representing the mainframe A.I. paused for a moment and actually agreed.Chu Nan smiled and confirmed again that the mainframe A.I. of this data rehabilitation center indeed had extraordinary intelligence. It was far from what the ancient computers produced by the Earth Federation could compare to.After carefully recalling the situation when he proposed the kick in the afternoon, Chu Nan first Sitting Horse Rush Fist and circulated his Internal Breath.When he felt his Internal Breath retract from his fist and turn around, Chu Nan immediately kicked it.Pew!After spitting out a mouthful of blood, Chu Nan\u2019s body went soft and he fell onto the treatment bed.Two robotic arms reached out from nowhere and carried Chu Nan to the bed to lie down. Then, several probes were already pasted on his skin and a needle quietly stabbed into the blood vessels in his upper arm.Not long after, Chu Nan completely recovered.He jumped down from the bed and kicked again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 - High-Frequency Vibration Internal BreathPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHalf an hour later, Chu Nan wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and weakly lay on the treatment bed again. He allowed all kinds of cameras to poke around his body to help him recover.After repeated experiments in the half hour, he confirmed one thing.The kick in the afternoon was not accidental.jasThe reason why he was able to successfully mobilize his Internal Breath with that kick was on the surface because his Internal Breath happened to circulate on his left foot. However, the deeper reason was that he had actually long possessed the ability to circulate his Internal Breath onto his left foot, allowing him to successfully kick.The deeper reason was the Nine Revolutions Technique he was cultivating now.In the Nine Revolutions Technique that Su Xuansheng had publicly announced, the cultivation methods of the third and second levels were naturally different.The difference was mainly that when one cultivated the third level, the meridians that the Internal Breath circulated in were obviously much more numerous than the second level.Therefore, the increase in Internal Breath when cultivating the third level was far greater than the second level. The effect of body refinement was also much stronger.Previously, Chu Nan had relied on his powerful data ability to precisely change the situation when cultivating the second level of the Nine Revolutions Technique. He had modified many of the meridians that the Internal Breath in the second level of the cultivation method left behind by Su Xuansheng. However, in short, he had only made slight adjustments in the area chosen and did not leave that range.After he broke through to the third level, he also performed small-scale modifications.The result of this was that even if he could rely on his data ability to mobilize his Internal Breath in battle, the range of meridians that his Internal Breath could mobilize and circulate was still limited to the third level of the Nine Revolutions Technique.The Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist Technique\u2019s three stances and twelve moves were relatively simple. Moreover, it happened to perfectly complement the Internal Breath circulation of the third level of the Nine Revolutions Technique. Therefore, Chu Nan could successfully mobilize his Internal Breath when he perfectly used the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist. Sometimes, he could even mobilize it if it was not so perfect.At the same time, when he kicked Saha apart in the afternoon, he happened to be able to mobilize his muscles to complement the circulation trajectory of the Nine Revolutions Technique\u2019s Internal Breath. Only then did he successfully mobilize his Internal Breath in that kick, causing the strength of his foot to approach 800 kilograms.Otherwise, even if the vital part of his lower body was Saha\u2019s weakness, with his special Black Rock Turtle Breath, Chu Nan might not be able to deal enough damage to him.Therefore, in summary, it meant that the method of circulating Internal Breath that Chu Nan had studied for half an hour still had to be built on the third level of the Nine Revolutions Technique. It could not exceed this range.The reason was very simple. Chu Nan had yet to open up the meridians outside the cultivation range of the Nine Revolutions Technique. His Internal Breath could not smoothly circulate, so it was naturally impossible for him to mobilize his Internal Breath freely in battle.\u201cNo wonder that unknown senior warned me not to do this casually\u2026\u201dWhen he recalled how he had spat out blood several times when he used his data ability to try and change the Nine Revolutions Technique and how he had also spat out blood several times in his previous attempt, Chu Nan smiled bitterly and shook his head.He was not so arrogant that he felt that he was even more talented than Su Xuansheng back then and could leave the foundation of the Nine Revolutions Technique to create his own cultivation method.It was not a problem to make slight adjustments. If he dared to rashly make any large changes, he might end up with his meridians breaking and his body exploding If not for the fact that he was currently in the logistics rehabilitation center and had powerful medical protection, Chu Nan would not have even tried for the past half an hour.Of course, this half an hour of experimentation was not without results.Chu Nan truly understood the reason for the circulation of his Internal Breath in his body. It could help him better use his Internal Breath in battle and complement the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist. It could even allow him to cooperate with the circulation of his Internal Breath outside the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist and add other threatening attacks with Internal Breath.For example, the kick in the afternoon\u2026However, this attempt could only be tested in the future. Half an hour earlier, Chu Nan had vomited blood a few times. Not only were his meridians damaged, but the recovery of his muscles was also for nothing. Now, he could only obediently lie on the treatment bed and let the mainframe A.I. torment him.Soon, the mainframe A.I. completed the analysis of Chu Nan\u2019s physical condition. He felt a numbing feeling that was like an electric current flowing through his body again.Accompanying this sore feeling, Chu Nan felt that every inch of his muscles, meridians, and bones were quickly healing. The treatment effect was abnormally shocking.He was already numb to the high-tech technology from the Noctem Chamber of Commerce, but when he felt this numbing feeling surging in his body, his heart suddenly stirred and a whimsical thought appeared.This was a method used for full-body recovery. It was said that it used the pulse-to-flow vibration to stimulate the activity of human cells, causing the human body to quickly recover automatically.The benefit of such a method was that it was effective immediately and would not leave any side effects. It was the most popular basic surgical method in the current Milky Way.However, this treatment method reminded Chu Nan of the basic concept of the Overlord Body.The so-called Overlord Body was the process of a martial artist continuously strengthening their body through their Internal Breath.From a different perspective, wasn\u2019t it similar to the treatment method now? It was both to promote cell activity and strengthen the body?In that case, could he use his Internal Breath to simulate the current process and recover faster? Or, in turn, could he better perform the Overlord Body?Chu Nan contemplated. He did as he thought!He took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He focused his mind on the situation where the numbness was circulating in his body and carefully recorded every change in data.The pulse continuously swept through Chu Nan\u2019s body and repeated seventeen times in a minute. He quickly grasped all the details.Then, he encountered the first problem\u2026The most important thing about the pulse flow that was used to stimulate cell activity was the high-frequency vibration. The natural circulation of Internal Breath in the meridians was usually as smooth and clear as a flowing stream. If he wanted to simulate the pattern of the pulse flow, he had to first control his Internal Breath to a high-frequency vibration.This required an extremely powerful and exquisite control of one\u2019s Internal Breath. If one was just a step away, it might even damage their meridians.Of course, this was not a problem for Chu Nan. With the support of his powerful data ability, he could make precise modifications bit by bit.After simulating it in his mind a few times, Chu Nan focused his mind and a trace of Internal Breath flowed out of his dantian. He first tried to control this trace of Internal Breath to perform an extremely low frequency vibration in the meridians near his dantian.Chu Nan felt his entire meridians tremble slightly with the vibration of this trace of Internal Breath, but there was no sign of damage.After this trace of Internal Breath circulated in his body, Chu Nan controlled it to increase the frequency of vibration.After another round, not only did his meridians not receive any damage, but because of the healing help of the number-controlled A.I., Chu Nan felt that his meridians were showing signs of becoming stronger.Therefore, he increased the frequency of his Internal Breath\u2026About five minutes later, the frequency of this trace of Internal Breath had increased to the same frequency as the vibration of the pulse. It flowed into Chu Nan\u2019s left arm and completely overlapped with the pulse flowing through his left arm. At the same time, it washed through every inch of muscle, meridians, and bones in his left arm.The abnormally sore and numb feeling stimulated Chu Nan until he felt as if his entire left arm had left his body and he nearly lost consciousness.After the sore feeling left, Chu Nan instantly felt that his left arm was filled with strength. Every cell seemed to have come alive. Be it his muscles, meridians, or bones, they seemed to have been reborn.Chu Nan was overjoyed.It was really useful!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 - Abnormal StatisticsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Atlas Studios\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Atlas StudiosAbout 470 light-years away from West Cloud Planet at a 37\u00b0 angle bearing from the Galactic Center was a very inconspicuous ordinary star system in the Milky Way.This star system, which only had two satellites, happened to be at the middle of the border between the Earth Federation, the Phezzan Autonomous Region, and the Kingdom of Kexley. Because there were no resources and the location was sensitive, it became a peripheral area that several countries were unwilling to openly interfere with.However, this did not mean that this star system was desolate.Ever since the Declan Empire relied on this star system to build a public stargate in the Orion Arm 376 years ago, this star system had instantly become the focus of several surrounding countries because of its special geographical location and the existence of a public stargate.No country dared to risk violating the \u201cPan Milky Way Stargate Travel Agreement\u201d and triggering the animosity of several other countries to come and occupy this star system. However, the surrounding countries would not give up on secretly controlling this star system.Therefore, with the support of public private commercial activities and secret national organizations, this originally unappealing star system had developed into one of the most prosperous galaxies in the surrounding 500 light-years in a short period of time.Even the Noctem Chamber of Commerce had built an extremely large branch base in the synchronous orbit of this star system\u2019s satellite, providing logistics support for their commercial activities in the surrounding countries.At the center of this branch base that looked like a ball and was more than five kilometers in diameter, was the data center of the Noctem Chamber of Commerce. It was responsible for the collection, analysis, and processing of data related to the Noctem Chamber of Commerce in several nearby countries.To the Noctem Chamber of Commerce, this data center was the most important thing to them, Naturally, it was the most protected place. Ordinarily, unrelated people were not even allowed to approach.However, today, the door of the data center was opened. The center director, Lyons, led his staff and respectfully welcomed the group in.The person walking in front was the specially hired data analyst of the Noctem Chamber of Commerce, Elkart.After he walked in, he did not say anything and directly sat in the seat that had been prepared for him. He connected his personal terminal to the mainframe A.I.of the data center.Soon, on the virtual screen in front of him, countless dazzling amounts of data fell like a waterfall.Elkart\u2019s glasses stared at these data without blinking as if in a daze.The center director, Lyons, and the staff of the data center beside him looked at Elkart\u2019s back with reverence.\u201cLord Elkart is really talented. He can actually complete such a huge amount of data and information so quickly and accurately.\u201d Lyons could not help but sigh softly.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Most importantly, he actually didn\u2019t make any mistakes. No wonder the Chamber of Commerce entrusted such an important task of testing the data of the branch to him.\u201d Roman, the data analysis specialist in the data center, was even more surprised.As a data analyst, the difference between him and Elkart was simply immense.Although he was previously unconvinced that Elkart was a specially hired data analyst of the Chamber of Commerce and enjoyed treatment that far exceeded his, ever since the latter came once two years ago, Roman had abandoned such a foolish thought.Standing between the two of them, the leader of the Noctem Chamber ofCommerce\u2019s inspection team, Rubes, looked at the two of them in amusement. He thought to himself: If Elkart doesn\u2019t have abilities that far exceed your imagination, how can he be so important in the Noctem Chamber of Commerce? He can even obtain the special attention of the president.A moment later, the data flow on the virtual screen in front of Elkart suddenly stopped.The few staff members of the data center who had long been prepared beside him immediately went forward.\u201cLord Elkart, what can I do for you?\u201dElkart pondered for a moment and handed a piece of data to the staff.\u201cCheck the source of this data.\u201d\u201cIs there a problem?\u201dHearing this, Lyons and Roman became nervous.Their data center was responsible for all the relevant data processing work of the Noctem Chamber of Commerce in several countries outside the Orion Arm, exceeding a thousand light-years in diameter. If a problem could attract Elkart\u2019s attention, it would definitely be a great issue.Lyons immediately got the staff to bring out the data and show it on the large screen in the middle of the data center, planning to investigate it.A moment later, the result of this data was mentioned. Everyone looked carefully and were stunned.This data was not strange. It was only 17 consecutive human data analysis reports.One had to know that the photon processor technology of the Noctem Chamber of Commerce was the top in the entire Milky Way. Even in the various countries of the Declan Empire and the Erewana Military Treaty Alliance, it was everywhere. It was even widely used in these small countries on the outside of the Orion Arm.In the area that this data center was in charge of, the most conservative estimate was that more than 10 million Al. units produced by the Noctem Chamber of Commerce were working.These A.I. units were responsible for all kinds of medical care, testing, and so on. Many of them involved human data. It was very normal for human data analysis reports to appear.Honestly speaking, this data center might receive millions of similar human data analysis reports in a day. There was nothing special.VVhy did Elkart specially mention these human data analysis reports and request to see the source of the data?\u201cRoman, do you see any problem?\u201d Lyons asked with a frown.He did not doubt Elkart<sup>i\u00a0</sup>s judgment, because many times in the past had proven his super talent in data analysis.However, if there was really a problem that they could not see, then if such a problem occurred in front of the inspection team led by Rubes, as the director of the data center, he would definitely be held accountable.Roman stared at these few human data analysis reports for a while before his expression suddenly changed.\u201cThere\u2019s indeed a problem.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Lyons hurriedly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? Could it be that the optical supercomputer in charge of this data is malfunctioning?\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s something wrong with the person represented by these data.\u201d Roman shook his head and pointed at the data on the large screen as he explained to Lyons and Rubes, \u201cLook, according to this information, these 17 human data analysis reports have appeared in an hour and are all data analysis reports of the same person.\u201dRubes and Lyons looked at each other in confusion.\u201cThen? This can only prove that this guy was bored and asked for 17 human data analysis reports in an hour?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s not that simple.\u201d Roman shook his head again, and his gaze when looking at the data on the large screen was filled with doubt. \u201cLook, the various statistics of the first report show that the person being tested has much stronger physical statistics than ordinary people. From the data, he should be an initial-stage or second-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist,\u201dLyons continued to look confused, but Rubes looked at the analysis report at the top seriously and nodded lightly.He was a powerful third-stage Void Break Martial Artist and had also experienced the Overlord Body Realm. He was much more familiar with the relevant data regarding the strength of the body than ordinary people.\u201cHowever, continue reading. The second data analysis report and the first report are less than three minutes apart. The various statistics of this person\u2019s body showa very obvious increase. The most exaggerated thing is that the blood vessel toughness has actually increased by 3.61%!\u201d Roman continued to explain.\u201cPerhaps this person is healing?\u201d Lyons guessed.\u201cImpossible.\u201d Before Roman could answer, Rubes rejected immediately, \u201cIf he\u2019s only healing, there won\u2019t be a situation of comprehensive data increase. It should only be a partial increase in data.\u201d\u2018Yes. When we look at the statistical analysis report next, we can see that this person\u2019s physical data has clearly increased every time. If you use a more image explanation, it\u2019s equivalent to saying that this person was only an initial-stage or second-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist an hour ago. However, after just an hour, the strength of his body is already equivalent to a third-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist. He\u2019s not even far from the average data of a fourth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist.\u201d\u201cThis is impossible!\u201d Rubes blurted out, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for a martial artist toadvance from the initial-stage Overlord Body realm or second-stage OverlordBody realm to the third-stage Overlord Body or even the fourth-stage Overlord Body in an hour. The process of an Overlord Body can only be done step by step. There are no shortcuts!\u201dRoman shook his head. He did not argue with Rubes about this. Instead, he issued an order to the mainframe A.I..\u201cShow me the source of this data.\u201dA moment later, the large screen clearly displayed the origins of these 17 human data analysis reports.Earth Federation.West Cloud Planet.West Cloud Academy\u2019s logistics rehabilitation center..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - Don\u2019t Be Too ArrogantPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhile the sore feeling brought about by the pulse flow disappeared, Chu Nan stopped his precise control of his Internal Breath and let out a long sigh.In the past hour, he had been concentrating hard and carefully controlling the waves of his Internal Breath and the pulse flow. Although he had the support of a powerful data ability, he felt abnormally exhausted.Contrary to his mind, he felt that his body was filled with strength, as if it had an endless amount of strength.Success!Feeling the powerful force surging out from every inch of his muscles, Chu Nan could not help but excitedly wave his fists.It was originally just a wild thought of his, but he did not expect it to really take effect!The current him had an abnormally obvious increase in all aspects of his body.According to the data, he was even certain that his current physical strength had already broken through the upper limit of the second-stage Overlord Body realm and become a true third-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist! When he recalled that he could only barely be considered an initial-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist a week ago, a strong sense of surrealism arose in Chu Nan\u2019s heart. If body refinement was really that easy, did that not mean that the Overlord Body Realm was not difficult for martial artists at all?No!Chu Nan shook his head and immediately rejected this thought.No other martial artist had such a powerful data ability like him, and no martial artist would be as whimsical as him and combine their Internal Breath and pulse resonance to temper their body according to a medical treatment program.It was impossible for other martial artists to similarly master this method he grasped.Moreover\u2026Chu Nan closed his eyes and pulled out a trace of Internal Breath from his dantian. While continuing to vibrate at a high frequency according to the previous method, he quickly let his Internal Breath flow through the meridians circulated by the Nine Revolutions Technique. This time, he clearly felt that the increase in his body was very small in all aspects. It proved that up until now, the increase he had obtained through this method was already close to the limit. It was impossible for him to obtain the obvious increase like before.He knew very well that this was completely limited by the strength of his Internal Breath and the circulation of his meridians through the Nine Revolutions Technique.If his Internal Breath could increase, the body refinement effect brought about by his Internal Breath would also increase. This was an Overlord Body process that all martial artists understood to complement.As for the restriction of the Nine Revolutions Technique\u2026 Chu Nan was temporarily helpless.His Internal Breath was not powerful enough to allow him to break through to the fourth level of the Nine Revolutions Technique. It was not impossible to expand his Internal Breath to circulate his meridians, but it was abnormally dangerous. It was not something that could be done casually.Chu Nan did not plan to take this risk when the finals of the martial arts competition were about to begin, so he could only give up temporarily.\u201cThis is already enough!\u201dChu Nan threw a punch and felt that this casual punch contained more than 300 kilograms of strength. He could not help but laugh.The increase in his physical strength was comprehensive. If he faced Saha again now, he would not be as miserable and dangerous as he was in the afternoon.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, the results of your body\u2019s monitoring are good. You don\u2019t need to continue with treatment. Do you have any other requests?\u201dThe female voice of the mainframe A.I. sounded.\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201dChu Nan\u2019s body moved slightly and he gently jumped up from the treatment bed before landing on the ground with abnormal ease.The toughness of his body after breaking through to the third-stage Overlord Body Realm made it much easier for him to do these actions than before. However, no matter how good his body felt, it could not offset the extreme exhaustion in his mind.Chu Nan shook his head and prepared to return to the dormitory to sleep.Not long after he walked out of the logistics rehabilitation center, three female students walked over. The leader was Yu Wanqing, who was called the Flower of the Academy.When they saw Chu Nan, including Yu Wanqing, the three female students took the initiative to wave and greet him.Chu Nan could not help but smile.It seemed that his presence in the academy had clearly increased after successfully entering the finals of the martial arts competition. If it was in the past, not to mention Yu Wanqing, even the two ordinary female students beside her would not take the initiative to greet him.\u201cHeh, Chu Nan, have you just recovered from physical therapy?\u201d Yu Wanqing asked with a smile.Yu Wanqing was called the Flower of the Academy. This smile was immediately like a blooming flower, bright and moving.However, Chu Nan had always only admired her and was not like Luo Li who would seduce him every time. When he heard this, he smiled and asked, \u201cHmm, what about you? Do you also plan to go to the center for physical therapy?\u201dThe other two female students chuckled.\u201cYes, we\u2019re going for physical therapy too, but it\u2019s not what you think.\u201dChu Nan immediately laughed.To many male students who loved martial arts, the logistics rehabilitation center of West Cloud Academy was a good place to recover from injuries. However, to many female students, it was a good place to do physical therapy.It was the same physical therapy, but the meaning was vastly different.Yu Wanqing glanced at Chu Nan again and asked hesitantly, \u201cChu Nan, did you see the news just now?\u201dBefore Chu Nan could answer, the expressions of the two female students beside him changed. One of the female students pulled Yu Wanqing\u2019s sleeve, and the other female student laughed.\u201cWanqing, you\u2019re too much. One look and I can tell that Chu Nan is someone who focuses on martial arts. How can he watch the entertainment news like us?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. He\u2019s already in the finals. He should make the best use of his time to improve himself like the Deputy Dean said. How can he have the time to watch any news?\u201d another female student echoed.Chu Nan looked at them in confusion.News? What news?Yu Wanqing seemed to have realized that she had said something wrong and revealed an apologetic smile to Chu Nan.Just as she was about to explain, a loud shout suddenly sounded from behind the three of them.\u201cHey, Wanqing, wait for me\u2026\u201dChu Nan and the three of them looked over in shock and discovered that Luo Li had run over from afar.When he saw that Chu Nan was also here, Luo Li\u2019s expression changed slightly and he could not help but tighten his legs.Then, he immediately relaxed and revealed an abnormally proud smile before walking to Chu Nan.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t this our academy\u2019s most outstanding martial arts genius, Chu Nan? Why? What are you doing here?\u201dChu Nan frowned and was very puzzled by Luo Li\u2019s performance.It was really strange that this guy did not show any hatred after seeing him.What was even more strange was that he could still continue to act like he was filled with a sense of superiority in front of him, and it was even to the extent that his expression carried not the slightest intention to conceal his pleasure in others\u2019 misfortune.What was he gloating about?Chu Nan could not think of an answer and could not be bothered to pay attention to him. He nodded at Yu Wanqing and the other two and prepared to leave.He had just taken a step when Luo Li suddenly stood in front of him.Chu Nan raised his head and looked at him in amusement.\u201cWhat are you doing? Do you want to be kickedagain?\u201dLuo Li could not help but clench his legs tightly before a trace of anger appeared on his face. He coldly snorted and leaned forward to approach Chu Nan and lower his voice. \u201cKid, I advise you not to be too arrogant. In the future, you\u2019ll at most be a mere low-level Void Break Martial Artist. It\u2019s nothing at all. With my current talent accumulation and my family\u2019s inheritance, it\u2019s not strange for me to become a Heaven Control Realm Martial Artist in the future. It\u2019s not even completely impossible for me to become a Star-Grade Martial Artist. At that time, you better pray that you don\u2019t encounter me again.\u201dAfter saying this, Luo Li laughed and walked towards Yu Wanqing. As usual, he offered meaningless solicitations.Chu Nan looked at his back in confusion.How was this guy so certain that he could at most become a Void Break Martial Artist in the future?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - Public JudgmentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter pushing open the dormitory door, Chu Nan could not help but turn around to look at the sky and feel even more puzzled.It should not be 8 PM yet, and it was the most lively time in the evening.It was already very strange that this kid Dong Fang would actually appear in the dormitory. Why did he still have a stunned expression as he sat there with a blank expression?\u201cHey, Dong Fang, what\u2019s wrong? Did you fall out of love?\u201d Chu Nan walked over and stretched out his hand to shake Dong Fang.\u201cAh?\u201d Dong Fang raised his head in confusion and looked at Chu Nan. After being stunned for nearly five seconds, he suddenly woke up, \u201cAh, Chu Nan, you\u2019re back. You\u2026 cough\u2026 have you eaten?\u201dChu Nan looked at him in confusion.\u201cHey, are you really fine? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re really out of love?\u201d\u201cTsk! Lost what relationship?\u201d Dong Fang spat in disdain, \u201cIf I want to find a woman, as long as I return home and have a large pile of women, I can choose whatever I want. What\u2019s the point of falling out of love?\u201d\u201cThen why are you daydreaming so late at night?\u201d Chu Nan asked curiously.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Dong Fang glanced at Chu Nan and his gaze actually avoided him,\u201d Chu Nan\u2026 where did you come from?\u201d\u201cThe logistics rehabilitation center. Didn\u2019t I say that before I left?\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 have you seen the news?\u201dChu Nan frowned.Why was this question exactly the same as what Yu Wanging had asked? \u201cWhat news? Could it be related to me?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201dDong Fang looked hesitant and conflicted. After a long time, he finally seemed to have made up his mind and sighed.\u201cForget it. You\u2019ll find out sooner or later anyway. I can\u2019t hide it from you.\u201dChu Nan was even more curious.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cLook for yourself.\u201dDong Fang moved aside and revealed the virtual projection terminal of the dormitory. Then, he operated his personal terminal and two familiar figures appeared on the virtual screen.Mu Yutong and Norman were two Star-Grade Martial Artists!\u201cThis is the news that was broadcast just now. The two Star-Grade Martial Artists accepted the exclusive interview of the Federation\u2019s Information Martial Arts World Channel. You were mentioned,\u201d Dong Fang explained.\u201cThey mentioned me?\u201d Chu Nan looked at the two Star-Grade Martial Artists on the virtual screen in surprise and understood that this should be the exclusive interview between the two Star-Grade Martial Artists that Yang Xirui had mentioned before, \u201cIt\u2019s fine if Mu Yutong mentioned me, but could it be that Norman also mentioned me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you see it.\u201d Dong Fang operated his personal terminal again. The virtual screen began to broadcast the news interview he had specially intercepted.Yang Xirui\u2019s figure indeed appeared on the large screen and was responsible for asking the two Star-Grade Martial Artists a question.In the beginning, it was only a few routine questions. Yang Xirui asked the two Star-Grade Martial Artists how they felt after coming to West Cloud Planet, especially Norman. Then, she gradually directed the question to this martial arts competition.The two Star-Grade Martial Artists praised this West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition greatly, indicating that the organization ability of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s government was very outstanding, allowing the competition to proceed very smoothly. Moreover, it had attracted a large number of outstanding martial artists from other countries to participate. It could indeed be called a rare martial arts flourishing event in recent years.Towards the end, Yang Xirui naturally asked Mu Yutong what he thought of the Earth Federation martial artists who were participating in the competition.\u201cSupremacy Mu Yutong, according to the statistics, among the adult group martial artists who have entered the final stage, the martial artists belonging to the Earth Federation only account for 26.56%. The groups below the age of 20 only account for 18.75%. What do you think about this?\u201dMu Yutong had been maintaining a smile, but when he heard this question, his expression sank slightly and he frowned.After a moment of silence, he shook his head lightly.\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m very dissatisfied.\u201dYang Xirui revealed an \u2018as expected\u2019 expression and hurriedly asked, \u201cDo you think the participating martial artists of the Earth Federation performed poorly?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Mu Yutong bluntly gave an affirmative answer. With his status as a Star-Grade Martial Artist, he naturally had the qualifications to give a strict evaluation of the martial artists participating in the competition, \u201cI have to say that the performance of our Federation\u2019s martial artists in this competition is really too poor. There are actually less than half of the martial artists who entered the final stage. It\u2019s too disappointing.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t say that.\u201d Norman shook his head. \u201cAlthough the performance of your Earth Federation\u2019s martial artists is ordinary overall, their individual performance is still quite good. For example, the kid called Chu Nan we saw this afternoon has performed quite well.\u201dWhen he heard his name, Chu Nan who was watching this video and Yang Xirui were stunned.\u201cChu Nan? Supremacy Norman, why do you think he performed well?\u201d Yang Xirui immediately asked.\u201cHa, I actually only watched one of this kid\u2019s matches. It\u2019s the ninth round of the elimination competition in the afternoon. He seems to have faced an opponent of the Kingdom of Kexley, right?\u201d The last question was Norman turning to ask Mu Yutong.Mu Yutong nodded lightly.\u201cYes, this Chu Nan is a student of the West Cloud Academy. I\u2019ve already noticed him when I visited the academy previously. His martial arts talent is extremely outstanding, but I never expected him to be so outstanding. He\u2019s actually able to defeat that Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist from the Kingdom of Kexley with the strength of a low-level Overlord Body Martial Artist.\u201dOn the screen, Yang Xirui was immediately excited and immediately asked, \u201cSupremacy Mu Yutong, you previously mentioned that if you discover any young martial artist with outstanding performance, you might take him in as your disciple. Then, do you feel that this student called Chu Nan has extremely outstanding talent and is interested in taking him in as his disciple?\u201dMu Yutong glanced at Yang Xirui deeply but shook his head.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Yang Xirui was stunned, \u201cWhy? Didn\u2019t you say that his martial arts talent is very outstanding?\u201dMu Yutong sighed and did not answer.Yang Xirui wanted to ask more, but Norman interrupted at this moment.\u201cHeh, this kid called Chu Nan is indeed talented, but unfortunately, he was discovered too late.\u201d\u201cFound out too late? What do you mean?\u201d Yang Xirui was puzzled. \u201cTo put it simply, if he could be discovered ten years or even five years ago, not to mention Mu Yutong, I would be tempted to take him in as a disciple. With his talent and our careful guidance, it\u2019s very likely that he\u2019ll grow into another Star-Grade Martial Artist in the future. But now\u2026 he\u2019s already past the best time to lay the foundation. No matter how hard he works, he can at most become a low-level Void Break Martial Artist. It\u2019s even possible that\u2026 he can only stay in the Internal Breath Realm for his entire life.\u201dHearing the explanation given by Norman, Yang Xirui, who was on the virtual screen, was stunned for a long time before turning to look at Mu Yutong.\u201cSupremacy Mu Yutong, you also agree with Supremacy Norman\u2019s judgment. Do you think Chu Nan can only become a low-level Void Break Martial Artist in the future?\u201dMu Yutong sighed and nodded slowly.\u201cYes. In fact\u2026 Norman said that he could become a low-level Void Break Martial Artist is already an overestimation\u2026\u201dThe subsequent video had nothing to do with Chu Nan.Mu Yutong extended the topic from Chu Nan and criticized the abnormal development of martial arts in the Earth Federation.The martial arts inheritance of the Earth Federation was clearly weak, but the various martial arts families of the federation cherished it dearly and were unwilling to share the cultivation methods they knew. This caused the martial arts of the federation to be unable to improve after so many years, causing a martial arts genius like Chu Nan to be unable to obtain suitable cultivation methods to train from a young age, causing his powerful talent to be wasted.If this situation continued, not only would the gap between the Earth Federation and the other countries not close, it would also grow larger and larger. This was not beneficial to the future of the Federation\u2026Click!The video image on the virtual screen suddenly disappeared, and the virtual screen directly disappeared.Chu Nan turned around in shock.\u201cHey, why did you turn it off? I was just getting into it. Don\u2019t you think what Supremacy Mu Yutong said makes sense? If those martial arts families in the federation can take out all the martial arts cultivation methods they know, it wouldn\u2019t be so difficult for us to learn a better martial technique.\u201dDong Fang looked at him in confusion, \u201cI say\u2026 why do you still care about these things? Didn\u2019t you hear what Mu Yutong and Norman said just now? You\u2019re only a low-level Void Break Martial Artist at most in your life! Don\u2019t you feel\u2026 depressed?\u201dIf the reaction Zheng Yuanlin had made when he came to see Chu Nan previously could be considered Mu Yutong\u2019s unilateral opinion, then now, even the Star-Grade Martial Artist, Norman, had expressed this opinion. For two Star-Grade Martial Artists to make this judgment at the same time was no different from confirming the death sentence for Chu Nan\u2019s martial artist future.What was even more despairing was that these two Star-Grade Martial Artists still expressed this when they were undergoing an interview. It was equivalent to publicly sentenced Chu Nan to death in front of countless people.If it was an ordinary martial artist, they would probably collapse the moment they heard this news and give up.However, Chu Nan only smiled and shook his head.\u201cWhy should I feel depressed? Didn\u2019t Zheng Yuanlin say this before coming?\u201d\u201cThen you\u2026\u201d Dong Fang thought that Chu Nan was barely comforting himself and his gaze was filled with pity.\u201cHeh, what\u2019s with your expression?\u201d Chu Nan laughed instead, \u201cStar-Grade Martial Artists are not gods. Is what they say necessarily true?\u201dDong Fang shook his head. Star-Grade Martial Artists were naturally not gods, but in the path of martial arts, they were not much different from gods.Since the two Star-Grade Martial Artists had judged Chu Nan\u2019s future at the same time, it could not be wrong. Seeing the worry in Dong Fang\u2019s expression, Chu Nan smiled and shook his head.If he was still the Chu Nan of the past, then with the two Star-Grade Martial Artists announcing his future at the same time, he could only resign himself to fate.However, because he currently had a super powerful data ability, he had long surpassed the category of ordinary martial artists.This could be verified through the whimsical experiment he had done in the logistics rehabilitation center.How could the current Chu Nan be judged by two Star-Grade Martial Artists who did not know the exact situation?Chu Nan wanted to say something more, but he suddenly felt a strong sense of mental exhaustion surging. He waved at Dong Fang and lay on the bed. A moment later, he fell asleep.Hearing Chu Nan snoring on the bed, Dong Fang could not help but smile bitterly.Was this kid too ambitious? Or had he actually given up long ago?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Knock! \u201cCome in.\u201d Rubes looked up and smiled at Elkart, who walked in.\u201cDone? Did you discover any problems?\u201dElkart looked exhausted and shook his head gently.\u201cDirector Lyons and his subordinates did well. At the very least, I didn\u2019t discover any problems.\u201d\u201cOh? Then this isn\u2019t a problem?\u201d Rubes pointed at the virtual screen in front of him. On it, the data that Elkart had specially extracted contained 17 human data analysis reports.\u201cYou should know very well that this is not their problem, but the problem of the individual called Chu Nan who is involved in these 17 reports.\u201dElkart sat down opposite Rubes. After a pause, he asked, \u201cWhat conclusions have you reached after studying these data for so long?\u201d\u201cConclusion?\u201d Rubes smiled bitterly, \u201cIf I had not confirmed to Director Lyons repeatedly that there was no problem with the mainframe A.I. of the West Cloud Academy\u2019s logistics rehabilitation center on Earth, I would not have believed that these data were true. How do you want me to come to a conclusion?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you believe that these data are true?\u201d Elkart asked.\u201cNonsense.\u201d Rubes sneered, \u201cHow can I believe that a person can increase the strength of his body from the initial-stage Overlord Body realm to the third-stage Overlord Body realm in an hour? This is completely against the common sense of martial arts and even the basic knowledge of the human body!\u201d\u201cCommon sense?\u201d Elkart looked at Rubes deeply and slowly shook his head, \u201cYou\u2019ve already interacted with those barbarians of the Declan Empire so many times. Do you still think this so-called common sense is meaningful?\u201d\u201cHow can that be the same?\u201d Rubes frowned, \u201cIf such a data analysis report appeared on those guys from the Declan Empire, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all, but it appeared in the Earth Federation. Do you think\u2026 a guy from a remote small country like the Earth Federation can be compared to those guys from the Declan Empire?\u201dElkart smiled and closed his eyes in silence for a moment. Then, he suddenly opened his eyes and asked Rubes, \u201cWhat do you know about the Earth Federation?\u201dRubes was stunned, \u201cAbout that\u2026 I can only say that I\u2019ve heard of this small country. It can be said that I don\u2019t know much about it. Why?\u201d\u201cContrary to you, I know a little about the Earth Federation.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Rubes looked at Elkart in surprise.Elkart was a specially hired data analyst of the Noctem Chamber of Commerce. Not only was he one of the top talents in the Noctem Chamber of Commerce, he could be considered a popular figure in the entire Milky Way.A person like him would be extremely popular in any country in the Milky Way. Why would he pay attention to a remote small place like the Earth Federation?\u201cThis is because after some data analysis, I discovered something special about the effect of the Earth Federation, which is why I\u2019m interested in this small country.\u201dElkart explained, which only made Rubes even more puzzled.\u201cWhat\u2019s so special about the Earth Federation that it\u2019s enough to attract your attention?\u201d\u201cDid you know that the Earth Federation was only discovered by the civilian exploration fleet of the Declan Empire 730 years ago? Before that, they had always been in the star system called the Solar System,\u201d Elkart asked.\u201cThis is not strange. Many small countries in the Milky Way are trapped in the galaxy because of their backward civilization. After they are discovered by other large countries, they officially enter the ranks of the Star System Civilizations. The Earth Federation is naturally no exception.\u201d\u201cHowever, such a backward civilization that could not even leave the star system before it was discovered developed into a border country that spanned hundreds of light-years in a short 730 years and even had a certain amount of influence outside the Orion Arm. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s very admirable?\u201d\u201cHmm, this is surprising. However, what does this have to do with the topic we just talked about?\u201d\u201cOf course there is,\u201d Elkart replied with certainty. \u201cThe reason why the Earth Federation can develop to this point in a few hundred years is largely related to the fortitude of the Earthlings. Putting other aspects aside, from the martial arts perspective that you\u2019re concerned about, there\u2019s very obvious data showing this.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cYou should know very well that a Star-Grade Martial Artist represents the highest combat strength in the Milky Way. A Star-Grade Martial Artist can even cross the Milky Way with his physical body and perform a super spatial jump. His individual combat strength is comparable to the top-notch enterprise-level battleship of our Chamber of Commerce. It simply perfectly reflects the limits of humanity.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Rubes nodded silently.He was already 46 years old this year and had cultivated martial arts since young, but up until now, he was only a fourth-stage Void Break Martial Artist.Becoming a Star-Grade Martial Artist was his dream since he was young, but it was probably something that he would never be able to achieve in his life.\u201cTherefore, I was very interested in Star-Grade Martial Artists for a period of time and did some statistical research. Among these statistics, a piece of data attracted my attention.\u201d\u201cIs it related to the Earth Federation?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Elkart nodded. \u201cIf we only count the number of Star-Grade Martial Artists in each country in the Milky Way, it\u2019s undoubtedly the Declan Empire that ranks first. However, I like to pay attention to the trend of the data, so I pay more attention to the trend of the proportion of Star-Grade Martial Artists in a country.\u201d\u201cThe Earth Federation performed well on this data?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not very good. It\u2019s very terrifying!\u201d Elkart\u2019s serious expression shocked Rubes, \u201cThe Earth Federation was only discovered by the Declan Empire 730 years ago, and from then on, they entered the ranks of the Star System Civilizations. They began to come into contact with the modern martial arts system 683 years ago and began to popularize the cultivation of martial arts.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 After all, it\u2019s a country in the Orion Arm. It will definitely be affected by the Declan Empire. If it\u2019s in the Sagittarius Arm controlled by our Noctem Chamber of Commerce, it will definitely be affected and follow the high-technology development.\u201d\u201cAt least from the looks of it, there\u2019s no difference between the good and the bad. After all, the inheritance of the Declan Empire has still stood strong until now, and our Noctem Chamber of Commerce is not bad at all.\u201d Elkart paused for a moment and continued, \u201cAnyway, regarding the Earth Federation, they began to popularize martial arts cultivation. It was not until 163 years later that the first Star-Grade Martial Artist appeared.\u201d\u201cIs this considered fast or slow?\u201d asked Rubes curiously, having not studied this data.\u201cPutting aside those countries with such a long history that we can\u2019t know the exact situation, among all the countries I know, from the beginning of the popularization of martial arts to the appearance of the first Star-Grade Martial Artist, the fastest only took 163 years. The second place after them was more than twice as long. It took 377 years.\u201d\u201cDid the Declan Empire or other countries secretly help the Earth Federation?\u201dAs soon as Rubes spoke, he shook his head with a bitter smile.Small countries like the Earth Federation, which had a certain degree of civilization and a large number of people, would usually be reduced to plundered targets by other countries in the Milky Way once they were discovered.It was already not bad that the other countries did not secretly tamper with the Earth Federation. Why would they give so much help?\u201cIt has nothing to do with them. After the first Star-Grade Martial Artist appeared, only 17 years later, a second Star-Grade Martial Artist appeared in the Earth Federation. This gap is still ranked first in all the countries. The gap is several times greater than the gap of 63 years for the second place.\u201dElkart continued to talk about his research data. Every data report shocked Rubes.\u201cUp until now, it has been 683 years since the Earth Federation began to promote martial arts universally. The current Earth Federation already has 76 Star-Grade Martial Artists in history. On average, one will appear in less than ten years. In the recent hundred years, the Earth Federation has produced 19 Star-Grade Martial Artists in a row, with 11 remaining now.\u201d\u201cThis number is naturally nothing in the eyes of the Declan Empire. It can\u2019t even be ranked at the top among the several countries outside the Orion Arm. However, according to the results of my data analysis, if this trend continues, in less than 300 years, the Star-Grade Martial Artists owned by the Earth Federation will definitely surpass all the other countries outside the Orion Arm.\u201dRubes thought for a moment and blinked.\u201cIn that case, this Earth Federation can\u2019t be underestimated. However, in the end\u2026 Elkart, what does this have to do with the topic we just spoke about?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve told you so much because I want you to understand that although the Earth Federation is an inconspicuous small country, the people in this small country can\u2019t be underestimated.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that you want to tell me that there\u2019s actually no problem with these data that don\u2019t match common sense? Is there really a martial artist from the Earth Federation who broke through to the third-stage Overlord Body realm from the initial-stage Overlord Body realm in an hour? This is too ridiculous! Even among the descendants of the royal family of the Declan Empire, not many can do this!\u201d\u201cWho knows?\u201d Elkart shrugged. \u201cAfter all, there\u2019s no more detailed data to test. I can\u2019t give you a definite answer.\u201dRubes was immediately stumped.After thinking for a moment, he said fiercely, \u201cIn any case, I\u2019ve already ordered Director Lyons to investigate this matter thoroughly. If there\u2019s really no other way, I\u2019ll personally make a trip to the Earth Federation!\u201dElkart smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re the team leader. You have the final say.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He felt that after sleeping, he was abnormally energetic and his entire body was filled with strength.He straightened his waist\u2026Bang!Chu Nan originally planned to flip over, but he did not expect that with a casual push, his entire body would soar into the air and his head would hit the ceiling of the dormitory.This impact was extremely heavy, but Chu Nan did not feel any pain.After landing on the ground and standing firmly, he touched his forehead and could not help but be a little stunned.This was the effect of body strengthening? Did he really temper his body to the extent of a third-stage Overlord Body in such a short period of time?He turned around to look at Dong Fang who was on the bed beside him and discovered that he was still sleeping like a dead pig. The muffled sound of Chu Nan hitting the ceiling did not affect him at all.Chu Nan thought for a moment before leaving the dormitory and running to the small forest where he often practiced alone these few days.It was still early in the morning. Not many people in the entire West Cloud Academy woke up, and this small forest was empty.Chu Nan casually chose a corner and calmed his mind after standing still for a while. Then, he threw a punch. It was the first move of the first stance of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long FistSitting Horse Rush Fist.Bang!Chu Nan did not mobilize his Internal Breath in this punch, but it had actually successfully caused an air explosion with a terrifying momentum.Chu Nan stopped his fist and was pleasantly surprised.Although he did not mobilize his Internal Breath in this punch, the force on it was actually 518.812671 kilograms! Compared to his previous punch, the force was more than 100 kilograms!After calming down, Chu Nan twisted his body and threw the second move of the first stance of the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist-Sitting Horse Stab Fist.Bang!Bang!The sound of fists shattering the air continuously sounded in the forest. Soon, Chu Nan finished practicing the entire Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist without mobilizing his Internal Breath.Through extremely precise data, the strength of Chu Nan\u2019s body had already increased greatly compared to a few days ago.Similarly, the strength he could unleash could at least increase by 10%, and the power was undoubtedly greatly increased. If it was combined with the increase in speed and body flexibility, the current punch would pose a much greater threat in all aspects than before.After practicing the Hong Clan\u2019s Long Fist thrice, Chu Nan gradually adapted to the change brought about by the huge increase in his physical strength. Then, he threw another punch.This punch contained Internal Breath.Bang!An explosion that was clearly much stronger than before sounded. Chu Nan was surprised to discover that the force of this punch was as high as 1016.12886 kilograms! Such a terrifying force had even surpassed any initial-stage or even second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist that Chu Nan had ever fought!With this punch, if he faced Saha again, Chu Nan was even confident that he could deal irreversible damage to Saha without targeting his weakness.After thinking for a moment, Chu Nan stopped practicing his fist and focused on circulating the Nine Revolutions Technique.As expected, not only did his physical body strength increase greatly, his Internal Breath also obtained an obvious increase. However, the increase in strength was much weaker than his physical body. Coupled with these two factors, the power of his punch was far greater than before.This was still under the circumstances that he had not completely adapted to the strength of his new body. When he completely adapted, the strength of his fist would probably be even more terrifyingWhen he thought of increasing the power of his fist, Chu Nan\u2019s heart stirred.Could the whimsical thought of maintaining the high-frequency vibration Internal Breath to enhance the Overlord Body that he had thought of in the rehabilitation center yesterday be used in battle?After calculating in his mind, Chu Nan did not hesitate to circulate the Nine Revolutions Technique and mobilize a trace of Internal Breath from his dantian. According to the experience data from yesterday, he controlled his Internal Breath to vibrate at a high frequency.After this trace of Internal Breath flowed along the pathways of the Nine Revolutions Technique and into his right arm, Chu Nan threw a punch.Whoosh!Although the power of this punch had slightly increased compared to when he did not mobilize his Internal Breath, it was not obvious and disappointed Chu Nan.\u201cIs there no meaning in this?\u201dAfter concentrating for a moment, Chu Nan\u2019s gaze landed on a tree not far away from him. He focused on mobilizing his Internal Breath, took a step forward, and threw a punch.Boom!The tree trunk that was struck by Chu Nan\u2019s punch seemed to have been filled with explosives as it suddenly exploded and turned into fragments that filled the sky.The tree trunk with a diameter of more than 20 centimeters was actually forcefully broken from the middle. The upper half of the tree trunk suddenly fell and smashed into the lower half with a bang. Then, the upper half of the tree trunk tilted and smashed towards Chu Nan, the \u2018murderer\u2019.Chu Nan jumped to the side and dodged the tree crown. He watched as the upper half of the tree smashed to the ground, raising dust that filled the sky. He was slightly stunned.No way?No matter how strong this tree was on the outside, it was weak on the inside. If it could not withstand the power of his punch, then it should have broken in the middle. Why did the middle fragment directly explode like this?After thinking for a moment, Chu Nan did not dare to find a complete tree to experiment with. Instead, he aimed at the remaining half of the tree and circulated his Internal Breath. While maintaining the high frequency vibration state, he threw a punch.Boom!The tree trunk that was struck by Chu Nan\u2019s punch exploded into fragments again, and a portion of it was forcefully destroyed.This time, when Chu Nan threw this punch, he deliberately felt the situation when his fist touched the tree trunk.When his fist struck the tree trunk, he could clearly feel that his Internal Breath, which was maintaining a high frequency of 1.73 kilohertz, had fused into his fist, causing the fist to carry a strange force of high frequency vibrations.Because it was only an experiment, the fused Internal Breath was not powerful. The force on this punch barely exceeded 700 kilograms, but because of this strange high-frequency vibration, the moment the fist touched the tree trunk, the force went deep into the tree trunk, causing the tree trunk to vibrate at a high frequency from the inside.The internal structure of the tree trunk could not withstand such a high frequency vibration and intense force invasion. It directly exploded from the inside and shattered into pieces of wood.This discovery shocked Chu Nan.It turned out that Internal Breath could be used like this?If the tree trunk received such a punch, it would directly explode from the inside. What if the human body received such a punch?Just as he was thinking, a call sounded from the personal terminal on Chu Nan\u2019s left wrist.Looking down, he discovered that it was an official communication request from West Cloud Academy.\u201cWho\u2019s looking for me so early?\u201dChu Nan accepted the call in confusion. A rough face appeared on the virtual screen of his personal terminal accompanied by a rough voice.\u201cHeh, Chu Nan, good morning. I\u2019m the third grade external martial arts teacher, Rayne. There are only three days left until the finals begin. According to the arrangements of the academy\u2019s leaders, I\u2019ll be giving you special training in these three days. Therefore\u2026\u201dRayne smiled coldly, \u201cIn these three days, enjoy the special treatment that I\u2019ve carefully prepared for you!\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - InterviewPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThree days passed. The finals of the highly anticipated West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition officially arrived.If most people felt that the level of the preliminaries was too low and not worth looking at, then after tens of thousands of participating martial artists passed through nine consecutive rounds of competition, those who could remain were definitely the elites of the elites. All of them were experts, and the competition was naturally much more exciting than the preliminaries.Therefore, before the first day of the final stage began, the venue of the competition had already been completely filled by the audience gathered from all over West Cloud Planet, the surrounding galaxies, and even the surrounding countries.Apart from the ordinary audience, the various major media outlets of the Earth Federation also sent out a large number of reporting teams to track the final stage.At the same time, the various countries around the Earth Federation also sent many media representatives.Of course, the media of these other countries were mainly focused on reporting the martial artists of their countries who had entered the finals. They would also report other situations of the martial arts competition. The private car of West Cloud Academy had just arrived at the competition venue. Before Chu Nan could get out of the car, he was shocked by the swarming audience and the various media representatives.As a famous martial arts academy on West Cloud Planet, the West Cloud Academy had sent 15 students to participate in the martial arts competition this time. In the end, only two students entered the final stages of the adult group and the Under-20 category respectively. Their results were actually not good.However, they were still martial artists from the Earth Federation after all. The audience of the Earth Federation would still give them great support.When the audience that surged over saw Chu Nan and the fourth-year senior who had entered the finals of the adult group get out of the car, a deafening cheer immediately erupted.This terrifying commotion stunned Chu Nan.Fortunately, the organization work of the martial arts competition was very good. It had long opened up a special channel for these participants.Under the guidance of the staff, the private car of West Cloud Academy successfully entered the competition venue.Although they could dodge ordinary spectators, the reporters with special channels were different.As soon as they entered the competition area, the reporters who had received special approval from the organizing committee surrounded them.When he saw those reporters rushing over with ferocious expressions, Fang Yuesheng, the fourth-year senior who represented West Cloud Academy in the final stage of the adult group, chuckled and patted Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder.\u201cChu Nan, be careful.\u201dAfter saying that, before Chu Nan could react, his figure flashed and he retreated to the side.As expected, those reporters completely abandoned Fang Yuesheng, who had entered the final stage of the adult group, and surrounded Chu Nan.\u201cChu Nan, do you have any thoughts about being able to enter the final stage of the group competition below the age of 20?\u201d\u201cChu Nan, according to the information, you\u2019re only a low-level Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist, but you can defeat several Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists in a row in the preliminaries. Can you tell us how you did it?\u201d\u201cStudent Chu Nan, according to the investigation, your performance in the second grade of West Cloud Academy has always been very ordinary. Why can you perform so well now? Did you deliberately hide your strength previously?\u201d\u201cChu Nan\u2026\u201d\u201cChu Nan, Mu Yutong and Norman expressed at the same time that it\u2019s almost impossible for you to become stronger than a Void Break Martial Artist in the future. What do you think about this?\u201dWhen they heard this question, the noisy figures beside Chu Nan instantly disappeared. All the reporters turned around and looked at the reporter who asked this question with unkind expressions.This question was actually the true reason why these reporters paid so much attention to Chu Nan, a participating martial artist under the age of 20.Otherwise, even if Chu Nan had entered the final stage with the strength of a low-level Overlord Body and was indeed worth paying attention to, it was not worth so many reporters fightingHowever, shouldn\u2019t he ask this question after the interview?If Chu Nan was dissatisfied and turned hostile after hearing this question, wouldn\u2019t their efforts be in vain?However, the reporter acted as if he did not see the unkind gazes of his peers. He continued to ask, \u201cTwo Star-Grade Martial Artists made the same judgment about you and felt that your future achievements would not be high. Are you dissatisfied with their judgment?\u201dSaThe other reporters were immediately jolted.Logically speaking, since two Star-Grade Martial Artists had made the judgment at the same time, it was definitely an undeniable fact. This meant that the highest achievement in Chu Nan\u2019s life could indeed only be to become a low-level Void Break Martial Artist. The most likely possibility was to stay in the Internal Breath Realm for life.Even if Chu Nan was unwilling to accept this, it was impossible for him to refute the judgment of the two Star-Grade Martial Artists.However\u2026 what the reporters wanted was for Chu Nan to rebuke them.If he could lose his temper in front of the reporters and even curse at the two Star-Grade Martial Artists, that would be the news they needed the most.Facing the burning gazes of the reporters, Chu Nan did not show any anger or dissatisfaction. Instead, he smiled and nodded at the reporter who asked the question.\u201cDispleased? Why should I be dissatisfied? It\u2019s my honor to be able to obtain the attention of two Star-Grade Martial Artists and gain their recognition. They even personally made a judgment.\u201dThe reporter who raised the question frowned slightly and immediately asked, \u201cThose two Star-Grade Martial Artists feel that it\u2019s very likely that you won\u2019t even be able to become a Void Break Martial Artist in the future. Do you agree?\u201dThe other reporters secretly praised this reporter.What they needed the most now was for Chu Nan to give a clear attitude.Chu Nan smiled and asked, \u201cWhat does it matter if I agree or disagree?\u201dThat reporter was stunned, \u201cOf course it matters. If you agree, does that mean that you\u2019ll give up on continuing to cultivate martial techniques? After all, your future achievements are limited. If you don\u2019t agree, shouldn\u2019t you\u2026 have some other thoughts?\u201dChu Nan shrugged, \u201cThose are two Star-Grade Martial Artists. My thoughts are not important in front of them, right?\u201dThe reporters frowned at the same time.They originally thought that Chu Nan was only an ordinary student who was not even 20 years old. When faced with their situation, he would definitely be flustered. Coupled with the fact that two Star-Grade Martial Artists had directly sentenced his martial artist future to death in an exclusive interview, he would definitely be dissatisfied and would definitely reveal some emotions.Who knew that he would be like an old hand who often faced the reporters? It was really unexpected that he did not show any flaws that others could grab hold of.\u201cChu Nan, Supremacy Mu Yutong has expressed that with your talent, you actually have the chance to become a powerful Heaven Control expert, or even the next Star-Grade Martial Artist. However, because of the selfishness of those martial arts families in the federation, you were unable to come into contact with sufficient martial techniques from a young age. As a result, you missed the best opportunity to lay the foundation, causing your future achievements to be limited. Do you have any complaints towards those martial arts families in the federation because of this?\u201d a reporter suddenly asked.Hearing this question, the surrounding reporters looked over in shock.This reporter was really daring to ask such a question publicly at such an occasion. Moreover, he had bad intentions.If Chu Nan was really dissatisfied with those martial arts families in the federation, by revealing it here, it would show that he supported Mu Yutong\u2019s view.According to the recent actions of Supremacy Mu Yutong and the federation government, they were undoubtedly targeting the martial arts families of the federation.Chu Nan jumping out at this moment was simply asking for trouble.Those martial arts families could not do anything to Mu Yutong, a Star-Grade Martial Artist, and it was even more difficult for them to resist the federation government. However, it was very easy for them to deal with an ordinary martial artist like Chu Nan.Chu Nan glanced at the reporter and slowly shook his head.\u201cYou might not know this, but I\u2019ve actually started cultivating the Nine Revolutions Technique since I was young. This is a powerful Internal Breath cultivation method left behind by Senior Su Xuansheng. I don\u2019t think its power needs to be doubted. However, despite cultivating the Nine Revolutions Technique, I\u2019ve yet to break through to the Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist. This proves that my martial arts talent is actually only limited to this, and it has nothing to do with cultivation methods.\u201dAt this point, Chu Nan paused for a moment and turned around. His gaze swept past all the reporters.\u201cI\u2019ve seen Supremacy Mu Yutong and Supremacy Norman\u2019s evaluation of me. I\u2019m very grateful that the two great Star-Grade Martial Artists have such a high evaluation of me. I\u2019m deeply honored by this. However, it\u2019s a pity that my martial arts talent is actually not as high as they say. The reason why I haven\u2019t been able to build a good foundation until now and prepare myself to become a powerful martial artist in the future is completely due to my own reasons and has nothing to do with anything else. I thank the two Star-Grade Martial Artists for their attention and everyone\u2019s concern for me. However, now, please focus your gazes on this martial arts competition. Thank you.\u201dAfter saying this, Chu Nan bowed slightly to the reporters and turned to leave.The group of reporters looked at Chu Nan\u2019s departing figure and were stunned. They did not have the intention to pursue him.This kid actually replied so flawlessly!Was he really below 20 years old?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - Inside the LoungePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 75 Inside the LoungeAs soon as he turned the corner, the calm smile on Chu Nan\u2019s face immediately collapsed.He took a deep breath and patted his chest, trying to calm his slightly nervous mood.This was the first time he was facing such a large group of reporters and had to face so many of their questions. It would be strange if he was not nervous!\u201cFortunately, I practiced with that kid Dong Fang in advance last night. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid I would have been embarrassed.\u201dAs soon as this thought flashed through his mind, a communication request came from the personal terminal on his wrist.After receiving the call, Dong Fang\u2019s chubby round face appeared on the virtual screen.\u201cHeh, Chu Nan, what did those reporters ask you?\u201d Dong Fang asked with a smile.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s all the questions you guessed yesterday.\u201d\u201cHa, these guys can\u2019t escape my expectations.\u201d Dong Fang looked proud. \u201cThen? How did you answer?\u201d\u201cI did as I practiced yesterday and did not say anything else,\u201d Chu Nan replied. \u201cVery good.\u201d Dong Fang nodded in satisfaction. \u201cChu Nan, remember this. Those reporters can\u2019t wait for something to happen to you so that they can make big news. You must think carefully before answering, otherwise, you will be in big trouble.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d When he recalled the questions of those reporters earlier, he did not think much of it at that time. Now that he thought about it carefully, Chu Nan realized that those reporters were actually secretly harboring ill intentions and every question was luring him into danger. If he continued to answer their questions, Chu Nan would unknowingly offend countless people.Fortunately, although Dong Fang was the same age as Chu Nan, he was extremely familiar with this aspect. Last night, he specially analyzed the situation that he might encounter today with Chu Nan and practiced his answers. This was the reason why Chu Nan did not reveal any flaws.After chatting with Dong Fang for a while, Chu Nan hung up and walked to the competition lounge. The group below the age of 20 was separated from the adult group for the competition. The competition lounge was also separated. As soon as Chu Nan walked in, he felt gazes sweep over. Most of these gazes were filled with curiosity.If it was said that Chu Nan was not famous in the past and was unknown among the 32 young martial artists who had entered the finals, after Mu Yutong and Norman specially evaluated him, he instantly became the most popular among the 32 participating martial artists below the age of 20.Someone even specially made a special topic for this and gathered the video of Chu Nan\u2019s first nine rounds.Through the recording of these nine competitions, everyone discovered that Chu Nan was indeed worthy of the praise of the two Star-Grade Martial Artists.The degree of tempering of his body was clearly only equivalent to a low-level Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist, but he was able to defeat two Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists in succession in the seventh and ninth rounds of the elimination rounds. The ability he displayed was truly shocking.Among those curious gazes, there was more pity, sympathy, or even schadenfreude.It was true that the two Star-Grade Martial Artists praised Chu Nan greatly, but most importantly, they also made a judgment that could be equivalent to a death sentence for him\u2013 it was almost impossible for him to even become a low-level Void Break Martial Artist!In that case, so what if he was a genius? So what if his performance was outstanding? In the end, he could only become an ordinary Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist. He would be mediocre his entire life and become an ordinary person.Unlike Chu Nan, most of the other 32 young participating martial artists in the lounge had successfully entered the ranks of the Internal Breath Realm. Even the few who had not become Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists were at least fifth-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artists.All of them had long laid a solid and good foundation. They would not be like Chu Nan, who would encounter an insurmountable obstacle when breaking through the boundary of the Internal Breath realm to the Void Break realm.In the future, their achievements would definitely surpass Chu Nan\u2019s! Of course, Chu Nan could clearly sense the various meanings in the surrounding gazes, but his expression did not change at all.TIO<b>) 11</b>He had already enjoyed such a gaze in the academy for many days.Ever since the contents of the interview between the two Star-Grade Martial Artists were made public, everyone in the academy would look at Chu Nan the same way. He had long been used to it.\u201cHeh!\u201dA burly young martial artist with a very young face walked over and took the initiative to wave at Chu Nan.\u201cMy name is Rodman, and I\u2019m from the Vig Republic.\u201d Chu Nan looked at him in surprise.\u201cHello, I\u2019m Chu Nan from the Earth Federation.\u201dRodman laughed and waved his hand, \u201cAlright, you don\u2019t have to introduce yourself. Who doesn\u2019t know you here now?\u201dSeeing Rodman\u2019s gaze sweep over, some of the other participating martial artists in the lounge avoided his gaze, and some simply nodded at him and Chu Nan.Chu Nan shrugged, \u201cIs it because the two Star-Grade Martial Artists mentioned me? This is not something to be happy about.\u201dRodman seriously looked at the expression on Chu Nan\u2019s face. When he saw that he did not seem to be depressed, he nodded in satisfaction. He stretched out his hand and patted Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder before laughing heartily, \u201cActually, it\u2019s nothing. Even if the two Star-Grade Martial Artists think you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t just give up, right? All the best! I believe in you!\u201dChu Nan smiled at him and thanked him for his encouragement.Perhaps it was because of Rodman\u2019s words, the other participating martial artists in the lounge also surrounded him and greeted Chu Nan.However, many people still watched from afar and remained indifferent.After Chu Nan dealt with everything, his gaze landed on a corner of the lounge and met with Maruk\u2019s cold gaze.Seeing Chu Nan look over, Maruk stood up and took two steps forward before sneering.\u201cKid, you\u2019re indeed very surprising to me. You\u2019re actually able to defeat Senior Brother Saha. However, this is because Senior Brother underestimated his opponent, but it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re really that strong. You better start praying from now on that you don\u2019t encounter me in the first round. Otherwise, I\u2019ll definitely let you enjoy a warm reception!\u201dAfter saying this last sentence, Maruk stuck out his tongue and licked the corners of his mouth. The smile on his face was very cold. Anyone could tell what he meant.Chu Nan looked at him and still did not feel angry. He only felt that it was funny.This guy had been filled with hostility from the first time he saw him. Now, his hostility was even more obvious. It was a mystery how he had been taught.\u201cIn that case, you think you\u2019re stronger than your senior brother, Saha?\u201d Chu Nan asked.\u201cOf course,\u201d Maruk replied proudly, \u201cI, Maruk, am a famous genius in the Kingdom of Kexley. Although my Senior Brother is not bad, how can he be compared to me?\u201dChu Nan laughed. This guy\u2019s arrogance was really hopeless.\u201cAlright, I hope what you say is true. I also hope that you won\u2019t be eliminated before you encounter me.\u201dAfter saying that, Chu Nan went to the side and sat down. He closed his eyes and ignored everythingMaruk\u2019s eyes flashed. He snorted and sat back.The harmonious atmosphere in the lounge immediately froze. Everyone returned to their seats and silently began to prepare.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He revealed a smile and even nodded at him.Chu Nan was stunned and hurriedly smiled.How could the major media outlets, who had long been waiting for this opportunity, let it go? They immediately recorded this moment.In the hearts of these reporters, they had long imagined countless things and were only waiting to unleash them.\u201cI\u2019m not a person who likes to waste time.\u201d As soon as Mu Yutong spoke, he revealed his straightforwardness as a martial artist, \u201cThe reason I came this time is because I hope to find a genius qualified to become my disciple in the competition.\u201dAt this point, Mu Yutong paused and his gaze landed on Chu Nan again.\u201cOriginally, there should be someone here who has the qualifications, but unfortunately, I discovered him a little too late.\u201dEveryone\u2019s gaze landed on Chu Nan on the stage.Clearly, Mu Yutong was talking about him.\u201cOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean that other than him, there are no other geniuses worthy of my attention and qualifications. It\u2019s just that I didn\u2019t discover them in the past.\u201d\u201cTherefore, in the upcoming competition, I hope that you can do your best to show your standards and show your ability. If anyone satisfies me, even if I don\u2019t necessarily take them in as my disciples, I won\u2019t be stingy with giving you some guidance.\u201dHearing this, the audience below the stage, especially the participating martial artists, became excited. Although Mu Yutong did not say it explicitly, the meaning of his words was clearly that if a participant performed well, he would directly give guidance. This was guidance from a Star-Grade Martial Artist!Not to mention that it was priceless to young martial artists below the age of 20, even to the martial artists of the adult group, it was also shockingly tempting!However, this was not the end\u2026\u201cA few days ago, some people criticized me. They said that I had always expressed that I hoped that the various martial arts families of the federation could share the cultivation methods and martial arts techniques that they had grasped and jointly promote the improvement of the federation\u2019s martial arts, but I did not do anything. I felt that they were very right, so I decided that as long as a martial artist from our Earth Federation obtained the championship in the two groups this time, I would reward him with a martial technique that was suitable for him. It would be at least an A-rank martial technique!\u201dThe venue instantly erupted.Oh goodness! What was Mu Yutong saying? An A-rank martial technique!He actually wanted to use an A-rank martial technique as a reward?In fact, he said it was at least A-rank!There were not many A-rank martial techniques in the entire Earth Federation. According to Mu Yutong\u2019s intention, if the two categories were won by the martial artists of the Earth Federation, wouldn\u2019t he have to take out two A-rank martial techniques?One had to know that any A-rank martial technique could be treated as a secret to any martial arts family in the Earth Federation.Now, Mu Yutong was willing to take it out to impart to other martial artists. This was simply unbelievable!Compared to this reward, the champion reward prepared by the West Cloud Planet\u2019s government for this martial artist competition could even be ignored! The value of an A-rank cultivation method and martial technique was not something that mere millions or even hundreds of thousands of federation coins could compare to!\u201cWhat if both championship titles are obtained by martial artists not from the Earth Federation?\u201d A very discordant voice suddenly sounded from the crowd.Everyone\u2019s gazes turned to the direction of the voice. The gazes of the audience from the Earth Federation were simply murderous.What kind of question was this guy asking?Were the martial artists of the Earth Federation so useless? They could not even win a championship?However, on second thought\u2026 it did not seem impossible\u2026Mu Yutong glanced in the direction of the voice and sneered, \u201cIf you can\u2019t even win the championship of this competition, what right do you have to obtain my reward?\u201dThe people below the stage were silent.Although Mu Yutong\u2019s words were a little unreasonable, no one could refute him. Yes, if they could not even win the championship of this martial arts competition held by West Cloud Planet, what qualifications did they have to request an extremely precious A-rank martial technique as a reward?\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dRight at this moment, an extremely hearty laugh sounded, and it attracted the gazes of everyone.With the eye-catching green hair on his head fluttering, Norman\u2019s body flew out from his seat and landed beside Mu Yutong.\u201cSince the Star-Grade Martial Artists of your Earth Federation are so generous, as a Star-Grade Martial Artist, I naturally can\u2019t fall behind. Hmm\u2026\u201dNorman glanced at the group of participating martial artists standing on the center stage and nodded.\u201cAccording to what I know, there are also a few martial artists from our Phezzan Autonomous Region among the martial artists who have entered the final stage. Very good, I\u2019m very satisfied with this. Therefore\u2026 if any of you can obtain the championship of your respective groups, I\u2019ll reward you with a martial technique that\u2019s at least A-rank.\u201dAs soon as these words were spoken, there was immediately an uproar below the stage.Chu Nan immediately discovered that the surrounding martial artists could not help but tremble with excitement.From the looks of it, these people should be from the Phezzan Autonomous Region.\u201cApart from that, I\u2019m slightly more generous than Mu Yutong. Not only is there a reward for the champion, but anyone who can obtain the top three will also be rewarded! B-rank martial technique! As long as you can enter the top three, there will be a B-rank martial technique suitable for you as the reward! Therefore, kids of the Phezzan Autonomous Region, work hard!\u201dThe audience immediately erupted again.Not only was the champion rewarded with an A-rank martial technique, even the top three were going to be rewarded with a B-rank martial technique!This\u2026 this could not be described as mere generosity! The audience of the Federation below the stage focused their gazes on Mu Yutong again, their eyes filled with anticipation.The other Star-Grade Martial Artist from the Phezzan Autonomous Region was so generous. Couldn\u2019t Supremacy Mu Yutong do the same? On the stage, Mu Yutong was silent for a moment before suddenly nodding and saying in a deep voice, \u201cAlright, this is the territory of our Earth Federation. Since Norman has said so, as a Star-Grade Martial Artist of the Earth Federation, I can\u2019t be inferior to him.\u201dThe eyes of everyone below the stage lit up as they looked at Mu Yutong in anticipation. He stretched out his hand and gestured with the number 8.\u201cAs long as a martial artist from the Earth Federation breaks into the top eight, I will take out a suitable B-rank martial technique as a reward!\u201d\u201cWow!\u201dHuge cheers instantly filled the entire arena.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why did he look like he had a deep hatred when he saw him now?\u201cHey, when did I offend you?\u201d Seeing Rodman\u2019s furious and aggrieved expression, Chu Nan could not help but ask.After the opening ceremony of the finals ended, there was immediately a redraw for the finals. Chu Nan\u2019s first opponent was actually Rodman.This already surprised Chu Nan, but what stunned him even more was Rodman\u2019s attitude.\u201cHmph!\u201d Rodman snorted heavily, \u201cI\u2019m just not convinced. Why didn\u2019t our Star-Grade Martial Artist come?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Chu Nan was stunned before he reacted, \u201cYou\u2019re angry because Supremacy Mu Yutong agreed to give our Earth Federation\u2019s participating martial artists a special reward?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Rodman shouted angrily, \u201cAs long as you guys enter the top eight, you can obtain a B-rank martial technique reward. That\u2019s a B-rank martial technique! As for me, even if I win the championship, it\u2019s only a few hundred thousand federation coins!\u201dChu Nan immediately laughed.\u201cHey, a few hundred thousand federation coins is not a small amount, okay? At the current exchange rate, I think it can be exchanged for more than a hundred thousand Vig Coins, right?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the use?!\u201d Rodman roared, but then he paused for a moment, \u201cUh\u2026 Alright, I admit that hundreds of thousands of Vig Coins are very useful, but they can\u2019t compare to a B-rank martial technique, okay!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no choice.\u201d Chu Nan shrugged, \u201cWho asked us to have a Star-Grade Martial Artist here? Moreover, no one expected him to be so generous, right? Of course, if not for the provocation of Supremacy Norman, I don\u2019t think he would have stated such a good reward.\u201d\u201cHmph! That\u2019s why I said that they should\u2019ve invited the Star-Grade Martial Artists of our Vig Republic this time. Otherwise, we might have gotten a reward.\u201dRodman still had an indignant expression. His fists collided with a loud bang.\u201cForget it, no matter what, I definitely won\u2019t show any mercy this time. I must beat you down!\u201d\u201cYou speak as if you would have held back if not for this reason\u2026\u201dChu Nan muttered and took a step back with his right foot. He assumed a posture and focused his gaze on Rodman.To the remaining six young martial artists of the Earth Federation who were below the age of 20, as long as they could pass two consecutive rounds, they would be able to successfully enter the top eight and obtain the reward of a B-rank martial technique promised by Supremacy Mu Yutong. It was sufficiently satisfying.However, to Chu Nan, compared to obtaining these rewards, he had a greater goal. He wanted to obtain the special recommendation of Supremacy Mu Yutong to enter Star Cloud Academy and obtain the chance to learn the \u201cArhat Overlord Golden Body\u201d.This was an S-rank martial technique!Moreover, since Supremacy Mu Yutong said that this martial technique was very suitable for Chu Nan, it meant that it was really suitable. Moreover, there was a possibility that Chu Nan could successfully cultivate it.Compared to the few S-rank martial techniques in the entire Earth Federation, how could a mere B-rank martial technique satisfy Chu Nan?If he wanted to obtain Supremacy Mu Yutong\u2019s special recommendation, he had to perform well in this competition.As for how to perform well\u2026 at the very least, he could not be eliminated in the first round of the finals.\u201cThe competition begins!\u201dAs soon as the referee\u2019s voice fell, Rodman\u2019s legs had already shot out, and he rushed over like a cannonball.Countless exquisite data fell into Chu Nan\u2019s eyes, allowing him to quickly determine all the details of Rodman\u2019s attack.He could have easily dodged Rodman\u2019s attack, but with a thought, he suddenly stepped on the ground with his right foot. His body sank slightly, and then he punched out with his right fist.Sitting Horse Rush Fist!Boom!Chu Nan\u2019s fist collided with Rodman\u2019s punch.A thunderous explosion sounded. Ripples that were visible to the naked eye spread between the two of them, fully displaying the terrifying power contained in this collision.Rodman\u2019s body suddenly swayed back, but Chu Nan took two steps back before stabilizing himself.\u201cEh?\u201dSurprise sounded around the arena.Even an audience who knew nothing about martial arts could tell that after this punch, Chu Nan was only at a slight disadvantage, proving that the strength of his punch was not much inferior to Rodman.<b>11all.</b>However, Chu Nan was clearly only a low-level Overlord Body Martial Artist, but it was obvious that Rodman was an Internal Breath Realm expert. Why was the strength of Chu Nan\u2019s fist only slightly inferior to Rodman\u2019s and not sent him flying?However, when they recalled Chu Nan\u2019s performance in the preliminaries, he could indeed rely on the low-level Overlord Body realm body to forcefully fight Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists. It was not strange for him to do this.Unlike the ordinary audience, the martial artists who were paying attention to this competition had a different opinion.\u201cNo, this kid did not use his Internal Breath in this punch, but the strength was so shocking. Could it be that his physical strength increased so much in a day?\u201dNorman frowned as he looked at Chu Nan on the virtual screen with a puzzled expression.\u201cIt has only been three days since I last saw his competition. How can he obtain such a huge increase in such a short period of time?\u201dAfter a pause, Norman turned to look at Mu Yutong\u201cHey, could it be that you secretly imparted some special martial technique to this kid?\u201dMu Yutong indifferently glanced at him and did not answer. He only continued to stare at Chu Nan on the virtual screen in deep thought.On the other hand, Yang Xirui waved her fists.She was not a martial artist, but after these few days of studying, her understanding of martial arts had already far surpassed that of an ordinary audience. Moreover, she had been paying attention to Chu Nan these past few days. Of course, she could tell that Chu Nan\u2019s seemingly ordinary punch had displayed an obvious increase compared to the last time she saw him.At the thought of this, Yang Xirui turned to look at the stage in the distance.Mu Yutong and the two Star-Grade Martial Artists came to a conclusion together. It was almost impossible for Chu Nan to even become a Void Break Martial Artist in the future, but he had obtained such an obvious growth in three days. It was simply a slap in the face to the two Star-Grade Martial Artists.In just three days, he could grow so much!Then with his powerful martial arts talent, on what basis could he not become a Void Break Martial Artist in the future, or even stronger?Yang Xirui retracted her gaze from the rostrum and raised her head slightly to look at the huge virtual screen that was floating in the sky specially set up by the competition\u2019s organizing committee.This super huge virtual screen had been repeating a projection these past few days. The content was to describe the process of a martial artist from weak to strong in order to show the huge potential of cultivating martial arts.In the first scene, a human was pounced on and killed by a beast.This was an ordinary person who had not cultivated martial arts. He was even unable to defeat ordinary beasts.In the second scene, the human defeated the beast before him and easily defeated a few ordinary people who were besieging him.This was a Novice Martial Artist who could already match ordinary beasts and easily defeat several ordinary people.In the third scene, a sharp blade slashed at the human body, but there were no wounds.This was an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist. Ordinary weapons could no longer cause any damage to his body.In the fourth scene, the human punched out. A ball of red light flickered on his fist, and the thick wall in front of him collapsed.This was the power of an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist\u2019s punch. It could even match the power of a traditional cannonball.In the fifth scene, a human was surrounded by red light. He looked up at the sky and suddenly stomped his feet, rushing into the sky. Then, he punched down, and a large river below broke.This was a Void Break Martial Artist who had already completed fusion of the inside and outside. His Internal Breath had fused with the energy of heaven and earth and could fly through the air. With a punch, it was not difficult to collapse mountains and break streams.In the sixth scene, the human beings flew to a high place in the sky and looked at the atmosphere surrounding them. They suddenly jumped and actually broke through the atmosphere and flew into the vast starry sky.Then, he collided with a huge battleship that was several kilometers long. He threw a punch, and the battleship\u2019s shield flickered before it exploded into a cluster of brilliant flames.Such a huge and terrifying interstellar battleship had actually been shattered into pieces by this punch.This was a Heaven Control Martial Artist containing a mini universe inside him. He could traverse the universe\u2019s sea of stars with his body alone and fight ordinary interstellar battleships.In the seventh scene, the human was floating in the sea of stars. His figure suddenly flashed, and when he appeared again, he was already in another cosmos.He did not wave his fists. With a glance, the small fleet of more than ten battleships in front of him was annihilated.This was a Star-Grade Martial Artist!Once he became a Star-Grade Martial Artist, not only could he roam the sea of stars with his body, he could even directly perform a super spatial jump. Wherever his thoughts went, cosmic spatial energy entered his hands. Powerful space battleships were simply like toys in his eyes.This was the peak of human martial arts at present, the supreme experts standing at the top of all martial artists!Yang Xirui did not pay attention to the next few scenes but stopped at the scene of the fifth human tearing through the air.With such a rare and outstanding martial arts talent, how could Chu Nan stop here?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - Imperial Wind StepsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe two of them did not care what the audience thought. After exchanging a punch, Rodman looked at Chu Nan in surprise and shook his head.\u201cNo, you\u2019re not a low-level Overlord Body at all. From your punch just now, you should at least be a third-stage or even fourth-stage Overlord Body! Tell me, kid, did you deliberately hide your strength in the preliminaries?\u201dChu Nan waved his hand and shook off the soreness from the punch earlier. He smiled at Rodman.\u201cIf I tell you that I\u2019ve risen from the initial-stage Overlord Body to the third-stage Overlord Body in these three days, do you believe me?\u201d\u201cTsk! Who would believe that?!\u201dRodman spat heavily. His feet paused, and he punched again without ceremony.Unlike the test earlier, this punch clearly contained a powerful Internal Breath.There was no need to directly sense it. Just by relying on the various subtle changes in data on this punch and the powerful increase in speed, Chu Nan determined that the force of this punch was definitely far greater than before.He did not receive it head-on. He stepped forward and his body swayed slightly. In a strange but extremely smooth posture, he easily dodged Rodman\u2019s punch.Rodman\u2019s attacks were endless, but every time Chu Nan moved his feet, he could perfectly dodge.In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged more than ten moves, but Rodman could not even touch the corner of Chu Nan\u2019s clothes!\u201cBeautiful!\u201dAt this moment, in the center of the largest arena in the academy, two huge virtual screens were broadcasting two matches at the same time.One of them was the competition between Chu Nan and Rodman.When Rayne, who was mixed with a group of spectating teachers, saw Chu Nan dodge Rodman\u2019s punch, he could not help but praise him loudly.The other third-grade teacher beside him asked Rayne in surprise, \u201cHey, Rayne, am I seeing things? Chu Nan should have used the Imperial Wind Steps just now, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s the Imperial Wind Steps.\u201d Rayne nodded, his face filled with surprise, \u201cI only taught this kid the Imperial Wind Steps three days ago. I didn\u2019t expect him to use it so well now. He\u2019s really a genius!\u201d \u201cThree days?\u201d Not only was the teacher who asked the question just now, but the other teachers who heard their conversation also had surprised expressions, \u201cDidn\u2019t he cultivate it before? You taught him from scratch three days ago?\u201d\u201cNonsense.\u201d Rayne rolled his eyes, \u201cThe Imperial Wind Steps is a rare C-rank martial technique in our academy. Under normal circumstances, only students with outstanding performances will have the chance to learn it after the third grade. Chu Nan was only an unremarkable student in the second grade, so how could he learn it?\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 he really only used three days to master it?\u201d The teachers beside him still did not believe it. Rayne looked at Chu Nan on the large screen with a strange expression. \u201cIn order to obtain as good a result as possible for Chu Nan and Fang Yuesheng this time, the academy specially approved me to choose any C-rank martial technique to impart to them. I saw that Chu Nan\u2019s fist technique was proficient and his foundation was stable, but his movement technique was insufficient, so I chose to teach him the Imperial Wind Steps. I originally did not expect him to learn much in three days, and I only hoped that he could improve a little. However, I did not expect\u2026 he has actually grasped it so well\u2026\u201dThe other teachers focused their gazes on the virtual screen again. They saw Chu Nan\u2019s feet moving continuously and his figure swaying, perfectly avoiding Rodman\u2019s attacks again and again.Although he did not use the Imperial Wind Steps every time, it was precisely this performance that reflected that he had already learned the technique extremely well and was far from the appearance of a beginner. \u201cHe only cultivated for three days to reach this stage. He\u2019s really an impressive martial arts genius.\u201d A teacher could not help but sigh. \u201cUnfortunately, this is useless\u2026 In the future, he will at most be an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist\u2026\u201d Another teacher sighed, his voice filled with regret.Hearing this, Rayne and the teachers around him fell silent.After a long time, a teacher waved his hand.\u201cAlright, that\u2019s all in the future. Now, let\u2019s see how he can win this competition?\u201d.The teachers focused their attention and looked over.Chu Nan\u2019s opponent, Rodman, was a powerful Internal Breath Martial Artist after all. Even if Chu Nan had already defeated two Internal Breath Martial Artists in the preliminaries and his strength had increased in the past few days, this did not mean that his strength had really surpassed ordinary Internal Breath Martial Artists.If he wanted to defeat Rodman, relying on the Imperial Wind Steps was far from enough.Slap!Chu Nan suddenly raised his left arm and his elbow happened to be on the lower side of Rodman\u2019s right arm. It knocked into his arm and he could not help but raise it slightly. Then, he threw a punch at the right side of Rodman\u2019s ribs.This counterattack was extremely sudden. Rodman was shocked and did not have time to react at all. He could only quickly raise his left arm to block his chest.Bang!Chu Nan\u2019s punch landed and his Internal Breath was activated. The force was as high as 817.681261 kilograms and it actually forced Rodman to take two steps back. Ever since the two of them started fighting, they had already exchanged dozens of rounds. This was the first time Chu Nan had counterattacked, but the effect was obvious as soon as he attacked. Immediately, the audience of the Earth Federation below the stage cheered.After forcing Rodman back with a punch, Chu Nan seemed to have gained the upper hand and immediately kicked out again, aiming at his vital points.Seeing this kick, be it the live audience or the audience who were watching the competition\u2019s live broadcast, most of their expressions were strange.Because the two Star-Grade Martial Artists had specially mentioned it, the current Chu Nan was no longer as unnoticed as before.Information regarding Chu Nan had appeared many times on the Milky Way Network and the various major media in the past few days. Regarding his performance in the preliminaries and even the West Cloud Academy\u2019s selection competition, it had been completely exposed by others. There were even countless people who had profound discussions about it.Regarding Chu Nan\u2019s performance in these competitions, everyone had different evaluations and concerns. However, there was one point that everyone could not ignore and they all agreed.Descendant Slayer!Including the qualifiers of West Cloud Academy, Chu Nan had already kicked his opponent\u2019s vital points many times in these competitions and won.This left a deep impression on everyone. Even the nickname Chu Nan had received was unanimously recognized.Now that Chu Nan kicked again, not only did the audience have a strange expression, even Rodman was shocked. He did not hesitate to clench his legs and desperately protect his vital points.However, Chu Nan\u2019s kick was only a feint. When he saw Rodman putting on a tight defense, his right foot suddenly landed and heavily stepped on the ground. Then, his upper body rushed forward and his prepared right fist struck out.Due to the fact that he also had Internal Breath, this punch was extremely fast. Rodman did not even have the time to complete his defense. He could only barely curl his arms and take a step back at the same time.However, he could not dodge in the end. Chu Nan\u2019s punch landed on Rodman\u2019s chest and a terrifying force that exceeded 1,000 kilograms surged out. Rodman felt as if his chest had been struck by a huge hammer and he did not even have the time to mobilize his Internal Breath. He immediately felt a sweetness in his throat and spat out a mouthful of blood before staggering back. Chu Nan obtained the advantage with a punch and his attacks immediately became continuous, not giving Rodman any chance to catch his breath.After a few moves, Chu Nan\u2019s punch broke through all of Rodman\u2019s defense and struck the vital points in his lower abdomen. Rodman only felt his Internal Breath fall into chaos and he instantly spat out another mouthful of blood before collapsing to the ground. Chu Nan lowered his head and looked at it. He put away his fist and retreated.After waiting for ten seconds, Rodman could not struggle up. The referee raised his right hand and fell.\u201cThe competition has ended. The winner is Chu Nan.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - Why Can You Win?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySeeing the referee\u2019s hand fall, most of the audience below the stage were a little stunned.He won just like that?Wasn\u2019t this\u2026 too easy?At the beginning of this competition, Rodman attacked ferociously, but he did not touch Chu Nan at all.Once Chu Nan counterattacked, Rodman could only exhaust himself defending and could not even counterattack. In the end, his defense was shattered by Chu Nan and he was dealt with a punch.The entire process could simply be said to be calm and without any surprise.Although Chu Nan had already defeated two low-level Internal Breath Martial Artists during the preliminaries and according to the information revealed, he had also defeated an initial-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist in the qualification competition held by West Cloud Academy, proving that he indeed had the strength to defeat low-level Internal Breath Martial Artists.However, defeating an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist like Rodman without any suspense still surprised most people.Be reasonable!Chu Nan was clearly an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist. How could he easily defeat an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist who was one level higher than him?If all martial artists were like this, what was the meaning of the division of levels for martial artists?\u201cThe rankings of martial artists naturally have important meaning.\u201dIn the live broadcast of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s Martial Artist Competition on the Federation\u2019s Information Martial Arts World Channel, Martial Artist Rengal, who was the guest, had a serious expression.\u201cBecoming an Internal Breath Martial Artist means that your Internal Breath can smoothly circulate throughout your entire body. In this case, when a martial artist complements their Internal Breath, the strength, speed, reaction speed, and other aspects that their body can unleash will definitely surpass ordinary Overlord Body Martial Artists.\u201d \u201cThen, how did Chu Nan defeat so many Internal Breath Martial Artists in a row?\u201d The host of the live broadcast asked on behalf of the audience. \u201cWatch what I said just now. I mean that they will surpass the \u2018ordinary\u2019 Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist, but this Chu Nan clearly can\u2019t be described as \u2018ordinary\u2019.\u201d\u201cOh? To be specific, what\u2019s different about Chu Nan?\u201dRengal stared at Chu Nan who was broadcasting on the screen in front of him and paused for a moment before saying with a serious expression, \u201cFirstly, we can tell from Chu Nan\u2019s previous competitions that his use of external martial arts is extremely skilled. I\u2019ve specially studied every competition video of him and discovered that every action he takes in any battle has been carefully considered. It can even be said to be an accurate calculation. There has never been any meaningless action.\u201d\u201cSo powerful?\u201d The host was surprised.\u201cYes.\u201d Rengal nodded. \u201cEven many veteran martial artists who have experienced hundreds of battles might not be able to do this, but Chu Nan can. I can\u2019t explain why he can do this at his age, so I can only say that\u2026 this is talent.\u201dAt this point, Rengal sighed.\u201cNo wonder Supremacy Mu Yutong felt that it was a pity. This Chu Nan indeed has an extremely admirable talent, but he was indeed discovered too late. If he did not choose the Nine Revolutions Technique to cultivate and could come into contact with an even deeper cultivation method when he was young, then with his talent, he should be a good Internal Breath Martial Artist now.\u201dThe host had a thought and asked, \u201cIn that case\u2026 Martial Artist Rengal, you also agree with the latest \u2018Foundation Martial Skill Promotion Act\u2019 by the federation?\u201dRengal coughed lightly, \u201cThis bill still needs to be discussed in detail\u2026 Let\u2019s talk about our evaluation of Chu Nan. Apart from the outstanding talent displayed in external martial techniques, we can also tell from these competitions that Chu Nan has probably already grasped the method to use his Internal Breath as an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist in battle. Otherwise, no matter how outstanding his external martial technique is, because of the huge difference in the tempering of his body, it\u2019s impossible for him to face an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist head-on and not be injured.\u201d\u201cCan Internal Breath be used by those who have not become Internal Breath Martial Artists in battle?\u201d the host asked in surprise again.\u201cYes. Actually, there are many cultivation methods that can do this. The most famous one is the Exterminating Heart Technique unique to the royal family of the Declan Empire. It is said that this cultivation method can not only allow one to use Internal Breath at the Overlord Body realm, but as long as one cultivates to the first level, they can directly mobilize the spatial energy outside their body.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t that the same as a Void Break Martial Artist?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Rengal nodded in a low voice. \u201cThe Exterminating Heart Technique is reputed to be the number one Internal Breath cultivation method in the Milky Way. It\u2019s naturally special for it to allow the royal family of Declan to firmly sit on the throne of the Emperor tens of thousands of years ago.\u201d \u201cIf only our Earth Federation could have such a powerful internal cultivation method\u2026\u201d The host could not help but sigh,\u201d For example, if Chu Nan could cultivate the Exterminating Heart Technique when he was young, his future achievements would probably be extraordinary\u2026\u201d Rengal smiled bitterly, \u201cDon\u2019t think about it. There\u2019s only one Exterminating Heart Technique in the entire Milky Way. Even within the royal family of Declan, not everyone can learn it, so how can Chu Nan come into contact with it? Moreover, he has long passed the best opportunity to cultivate his Internal Breath to lay the foundation. Even if he learns the Exterminating Heart Technique now, he will probably be unable to unleash its full potential.\u201dThe host sighed softly and shook his head before changing the question.\u201cIn that case, Mr. Rengal, can you predict Chu Nan\u2019s next performance? Do you think he can successfully enter the top eight and obtain the special reward agreed by Supremacy Mu Yutong? Or should I say, does he have any hope of entering the finals or even winning the final championship?\u201dRengal frowned and thought for a long time before answering with uncertainty, \u201cWith the strength he has displayed now, there\u2019s a high chance he can pass the next round and enter the top eight. However, breaking into the finals or even winning the championship\u2026 I can\u2019t make any predictions. I\u2019ve seen his competition videos many times and discovered that he has improved almost every time compared to the last time. Therefore, even I suspect that he has been hiding his strength.\u201d\u201cHiding his strength?\u201d The host smiled, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s very worth investigating. Alright, this is all for the evaluation of this competition. Next, we will continue to broadcast the next round of the West Cloud Martial Competition. Everyone, please continue to pay attention to the Federation\u2019s Information Martial Arts World Channel and continue to pay attention to Chu Nan\u2019s performance.\u201dSeeing the scene on the virtual screen begin to turn into an advertisement, Rayne looked away, frowned, and fell into thought.He was not surprised by Chu Nan\u2019s performance.In the past three days, he had given strengthening training to Chu Nan and Fang Yuesheng. After interacting with him frequently, he was already very familiar with his characteristics.What he paid attention to was only the last punch Chu Nan threw in the competition.The lower abdomen\u2019s dantian was indeed a very important vital part for many low-level martial artists.If he was heavily injured there, it would definitely affect the circulation of the entire Internal Breath in his body and greatly affect his combat strength.If it was serious, it was not impossible to directly die because of this.However, this was also on the premise that this attack could indeed cause damage to this place.Under normal circumstances, with Rodman\u2019s strength as an initial-stage or second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, only if his opponent had an equivalent or higher attack power would he have the chance to hit his dantian and cause a fatal effect.Although Chu Nan\u2019s fist strength far surpassed ordinary Overlord Body Martial Artists and he could even mobilize his Internal Breath in his fist technique, he was still limited by an Overlord Body Martial Artist and the amount of Internal Breath he could unleash was limited.Even if he had punched a vital part of Rodman\u2019s dantian, under normal circumstances, it was impossible for him to collapse on the ground with just the force of his fist and completely lose the ability to resist-unless he could contain a sufficiently powerful Internal Breath in this punch.However, with the strength of Chu Nan\u2019s Internal Breath, how could he do this?\u201cCould it be that this kid is hiding something?\u201dRayne rubbed his chin and began to recall Chu Nan\u2019s various performances in the past three days, hoping to find some clues.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - The Noctem Chamber of Commerce ArrivesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHeh, Chu Nan, congratulations on winning the first round.\u201dChu Nan raised his head and smiled at Fang Yuesheng.\u201cAren\u2019t you the same?\u201dFang Yuesheng, who had just won the first match, laughed and shook his head. \u201cThis is different. As long as you win another round, you can enter the top eight groups below the age of 20 and obtain the reward of at least a B-rank martial technique from Supremacy Mu Yutong. As for me? I have to win at least two more consecutive rounds before I can enter the top eight.\u201d At this point, Fang Yuesheng sighed, \u201cSigh, why didn\u2019t Supremacy Mu Yutong consider the different situations of the two groups?\u201dChu Nan could not help but smile. The groups below the age of 20 were different from the adult groups. There were only 32 martial artists participating in the finals, so one only needed to win two consecutive rounds to enter the top eight.However, there were 64 participating martial artists in the final stage of the adult group. This meant that if Fang Yuesheng wanted to become the top eight, he had to win at least three consecutive rounds.The competition in the adult group was much more intense than those in the group below the age of 20. Among the participating martial artists who entered the final stage, there were a total of seven Void Break Martial Artists.Although Fang Yuesheng was called the number one genius of West Cloud Academy and the number one expert of the students, he was only a fifth-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist now. There was still a huge gap between him and a Void Break Martial Artist.The fact that he could enter the finals and even win a round was already enough to show his excellence.If he wanted to win three consecutive rounds and enter the top eight\u2026 he probably needed luck the most.\u201cRight, Chu Nan, I just saw your competition recording. There\u2019s something I find strange.\u201d Fang Yuesheng had a straightforward personality and quickly put down his sigh before turning to ask. \u201cHmm? What\u2019s strange?\u201d\u201cThat last punch of yours\u2026 Although I\u2019m certain that you used your Internal Breath and it was very powerful, how could it beat that Rodman up until he can\u2019t stand up? I don\u2019t understand no matter how I think about it. Rodman isn\u2019t that weak, right?\u201d\u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d Chu Nan raised his right hand and clenched it into a fist. He thought for a moment and revealed a brilliant smile at Fang Yuesheng,\u201d It\u2019s a secret.\u201dFang Yuesheng blinked and was immediately angry.If this guy used other words to reject him, he could still continue to probe. However, he did not expect that he would directly throw out a \u2018secret\u2019. It was obvious that he did not want to tell him. How could he ask?Seeing his expression, Chu Nan laughed and waved his hand. \u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on myself, so I can\u2019t tell you the reason why you asked me to.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cReally.\u201dFang Yuesheng glared at Chu Nan. Seeing that he indeed did not intend to say anything, he could only shake his head and stop asking.Exploring the secret of another martial artist was originally a little taboo. Even if the two of them were schoolmates, this was not acceptable.After chatting for a while, Fang Yuesheng bade farewell and left to prepare for his next match.Due to the fact that there was one less round of matches for those below the age of 20, the time to prepare in the middle was longer and he could continue to wait here.Seeing Fang Yuesheng\u2019s figure disappear outside the door, Chu Nan nodded and looked at his right hand. After pondering for a moment, he lowered his palm. At the same time, his Internal Breath circulated according to the trajectory of the Nine Revolutions Technique and entered his palm.Bang!His palm pressed on the wooden chair, and the chair immediately exploded as if there was a hidden explosive inside.However, compared to the pitiful tree that Chu Nan had used as a test subject, this chair only exploded at the spot where his palm pressed down and the surrounding area. The other places barely remained intact.If one looked through the surface, they would discover that the wooden patterns in the middle of the chair had already twisted into a mess, as if they were twisted together by a strange force. It looked extremely strange.Chu Nan retracted his right hand with a strange expression.This palm was the same as the last punch that struck the vital part of Rodman\u2019s dantian in the competition. When he used his Internal Breath, he deliberately controlled his Internal Breath to a high-frequency vibration state.In the end, this light palm strike directly smashed a huge hole in the extremely thick wooden chair under his butt. The punch just now completely made Rodman lose his resistance.Even if Chu Nan had tested such a terrifying power many times in the past few days, he still found it unbelievable.His Internal Breath maintained a high frequency vibration, causing such a terrifying destructive force.Could this be\u2026 the true Internal Breath circulation method that the unknown senior mentioned?However, why did such a high-frequency vibrating Internal Breath not cause any damage when it circulated in his meridians? Instead, it could simulate the pulse resonance to treat physical injuries?Chu Nan could not understand the reason for this difference. After all, his knowledge regarding Internal Breath only came from the classroom of West Cloud Academy. Those teachers would not explain such a strange phenomenon.\u201cForget it, it\u2019s a good thing anyway.\u201dChu Nan shrugged and stood up to leave the lounge that was specially prepared for him and Fang Yuesheng by West Cloud Academy. He walked towards the martial arts lounge for those under the age of 20.He had only taken two steps when a young man in his thirties wearing glasses walked over.\u201cHello, are you Chu Nan?\u201dChu Nan looked at him in surprise and his gaze landed on the glasses on his nose.Modern technology had long solved the problem of having short-sighted eyes. The only reason why people still wore glasses could only be to show the so-called \u201crefined\u201d and \u201cknowledgeable\u201d feeling.However, this person had a shrewd and capable expression. No matter how one looked at it, it was impossible to associate him with the ancient term \u201cweak scholar\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m Chu Nan. You are\u2026\u201dThat person immediately smiled and said, \u201cLet me introduce myself. I\u2019m Yu Tingfeng. I\u2019m the Director of the West Cloud Planet of the Orion Arm Branch of the Noctem Chamber of Commerce located at the Earth\u2019s Federation\u2019s branch office. This is my name card.\u201dChu Nan was a little amused and curiously took the exquisite name card from the other party.Not only was this guy wearing glasses, but he also used a name card, something that had been eliminated for many years. It was simply filled with an ancient charm. When compared to his appearance, it caused an extremely strong sense of strangeness.The name card did reveal his identity, but Chu Nan did not have any concept of it. He was only a little curious.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like this.\u201d Yu Tingfeng did not produce anything ancient this time. Instead, he operated the personal terminal on his wrist and displayed a few data reports through the virtual screen, \u201cExcuse me, is this the physical data test report you obtained from the West Cloud Academy\u2019s logistics rehabilitation center four days ago?\u201dChu Nan stared at it in shock and nodded.Then, he frowned and asked, \u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t your Noctem Chamber of Commerce always say that user privacy is the top priority? Why have you pulled out my private personal data? What do you want to do?\u201dYu Tingfeng hurriedly waved his hand and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve misunderstood. We don\u2019t have any intention of revealing your private matters. It\u2019s just that there are some problems with these data reports. We hope that you can cooperate with our Chamber of Commerce in an investigation.\u201d\u201cInvestigate?\u201d Chu Nan looked at him in confusion, \u201cInvestigate what? Could it be that you still suspect that I\u2019m faking my body\u2019s data report? Is there a need for me to do that?\u201d\u201cNo, no, no. We definitely don\u2019t doubt this. In fact, we originally suspected that it was the problem with the mainframe A.I. located in the logistics rehabilitation center of the West Cloud Academy. However, after investigation, the A.I. itself is fine, but these data\u2026 still carry some doubts. That\u2019s why we found you. I hope you can cooperate with us to carry out some corresponding investigations.\u201dChu Nan glanced at him. \u201cAren\u2019t you saying that I have a problem?\u201dYu Tingfeng paused for a moment and revealed an apologetic smile.\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because I used the word \u2018investigation\u2019 that you\u2019re unhappy. Alright, I\u2019ll reiterate it now. We only hope that you can help us resolve this problem. What do you think? Of course, we\u2019ll compensate you for wasting your time and energy.\u201d\u201cCompensation?\u201d Chu Nan thought for a moment and his heart stirred.The Noctem Chamber of Commerce was a huge entity located at the top of the Milky Way. Now that they had taken the initiative to find and ask him to help solve the problem, they definitely could not be too stingy.Moreover\u2026 he had some doubts about the situation that day that they wanted to resolve. Perhaps, with the help of the Noctem Chamber of Commerce\u2019s super technology, he could investigate the matter.can\u201cAlright, I can help, but\u2026\u201d Chu Nan pointed at the arena in the distance, \u201cAs you can see, I don\u2019t have time now.\u201d \u201cUnderstood.\u201d Hearing Chu Nan\u2019s agreement, Yu Tingfeng immediately smiled and pulled out his personal terminal to send a request to establish communication to him, \u201cThis is my contact number. After the competition ends and you feel that you have the time to help us resolve this problem, please contact me. Lastly, I wish you good luck in martial arts.\u201dChu Nan exchanged his personal terminal communication account with him before Yu Tingfeng waved his hand and bade farewell.Even after he walked far away, Chu Nan was still puzzled.How could the Noctem Chamber of Commerce find him just because of a few physical statistics reports?What the heck\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe first round of the finals ended. The results were good and bad for the Earth Federation.Of the 17 participating martial artists of the Earth Federation who had entered the finals, 11 had successfully defeated their opponents and entered the next round.This way, among the remaining 32 participants in the final stage of the adult group, more than a third of the participants were from the Earth Federation, raising the chances of the Earth Federation entering the top eight and even greatly increasing their chances of winning the championship.However, compared to the adult group, those under the age of 20 were much more miserable.There were not many young martial artists from the Earth Federation who had successfully entered the final stage of the group competition below the age of 20. There were only a mere six. In the end, after the first round of the competition ended, a total of four were directly eliminated, and only two were left!Among the remaining 16 participating martial artists, the proportion of young martial artists in the Earth Federation was actually only 12.5%!One had to know that this result was still under the premise that Supremacy Mu Yutong took out a B-rank or even A-rank martial technique as a reward!If such an extremely tempting reward was unable to make the young martial artists of the Earth Federation perform well, it could only mean that their strength was indeed insufficient.This result immediately made the people of the Earth Federation, who had been paying close attention to the situation of the previous competition, even more nervous.Miss Tang Xiaoyou was right. Young martial artists represented the future of the Earth Federation\u2019s martial arts development. If the young martial artists of the Earth Federation performed so badly in this competition, did that not mean that the Earth Federation\u2019s martial arts development had already encountered a serious crisis?Everyone\u2019s attention was focused on the two remaining young martial artists of the Earth Federation.One of them was naturally Chu Nan. \u201cMr. Rengal, do you think Chu Nan can pass the next round?\u201d Diana asked the question that many people were concerned about. \u201cThis\u2026\u201dAfter being a guest of the Martial Arts World Channel for so long, this was the first time that Rengal had shown such hesitation on a show.\u201cTo be honest\u2026 I don\u2019t dare to say. From the surface, although Chu Nan has improved compared to the initial stages, he has yet to reach the level of an Internal Breath Martial Artist. According to the strength revealed in the previous competition, his next opponent should at least be a second-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist.\u201d\u201cThen, do you think Chu Nan can\u2019t defeat his opponent?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Rengal shook his head. \u201cChu Nan has already proved that although he\u2019s still an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist, he has the strength to defeat an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist. Therefore, even if his opponent is a second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, it doesn\u2019t mean that he has no chance of winning.\u201dDiana frowned slightly, \u201cThen, Mr. Rengal, what level of martial artist do you think Chu Nan is equivalent to with his current strength?\u201d\u201cYour question stumped me.\u201d Rengal smiled bitterly, \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m completely unable to determine what level Chu Nan\u2019s true strength is at because his past performance has already exceeded my expectations many times. Ordinary martial artists\u2019 ratings can\u2019t be completely used on him.\u201dAfter a pause, Rengal added, \u201cOf course, although he has the strength to jump levels and defeat a few low-level Internal Breath Martial Artists, this does not mean that he can defeat all the low-level Internal Breath Martial Artists. To these martial artists who are still at the initial stage, what determines the outcome of their battle is not only the degree of tempering of their bodies and the martial techniques they know, but more importantly, it\u2019s whether they can maintain their calm in battle and their confidence in themselves. In these two points, Chu Nan\u2019s performance has clearly surpassed young martial artists of the same age. He\u2019s worthy of the praise of two Star-Grade Martial Artists.\u201d\u201cIn other words, you still think that the possibility of Chu Nan defeating his opponent is higher?\u201d Diana immediately asked.Rengal laughed, \u201cChu Nan is a martial artist of our Earth Federation, so I naturally hope that he can defeat his opponent. Here, I also hope that the other Earth Federation audience can give Chu Nan more support and cheers. Don\u2019t give him too much pressure and let him unleash his strength better.\u201d\u201cMr. Rengal is right. Alright, please evaluate the other young martial artist from the Earth Federation who has entered the next round, Tomler Hussein\u2026\u201dChu Nan stared at his opponent and could not help but reveal an abnormally surprised expression.This opponent\u2026 was actually holding a spear in his hand!\u201cWhat? You\u2019ve never seen this before?\u201dSeeing Chu Nan\u2019s expression, this young martial artist called Cardu smiled proudly. He shook the spear in his hand and drew a beautiful flower in the air.\u201cNo.\u201d Chu Nan shook his head obediently.It was not only that he had never seen it before. He was even certain that the audience and other martial artists present had never seen this.This guy had clearly only used his fists and feet like all the other participating martial artists in the previous competition. Why did he suddenly take out a spear?Shouldn\u2019t cold weapons like spears only exist in the hands of museums or collectors with special hobbies?Not to mention that modern high-tech weapons had long eliminated all cold weapons, even martial artists who were focused on martial arts would not choose cold weapons.This was because even high-level Overlord Body Martial Artists would no longer be damaged by cold weapons, let alone higher-level Internal Breath Martial Artists.As for powerful martial artists of higher levels, the power they could unleash was already comparable to modern high-tech weapons. How could they care about these harmless cold weapons?Moreover, compared to the flexibility that the human body could unleash, not only could an additional cold weapon control not give a martial artist any advantage, it would most likely become a burden. It was not a good thingTherefore, generally speaking, no martial artist would specially choose cold weapons as weapons. Even if they really needed weapons, the various weapons produced by high-tech technology could still be found to be far more suitable than cold weapons.Of course, Chu Nan would not underestimate this opponent because of this.Since the other party dared to take out an extremely rare cold weapon like a spear, he must have his own unique understanding and use in this.\u201cLet me remind you first. This Kaff spear was passed down by my ancestors and is made from an extremely special material in our Phezzan Autonomous Region. It\u2019s far from what ordinary cold weapons can compare to. In the battle later, don\u2019t be pierced by me because you underestimate it.\u201dCardu seemed to have been used to Chu Nan and the surrounding audience\u2019s surprised gazes. Not only did he not show any discomfort, he even proudly explained to Chu Nan.Chu Nan nodded and his body sank slightly as he assumed a posture of facing an enemy.Under the circumstances, he did not plan to rashly attack. It was best to observe more and respond.Cardu was not polite. When he saw Chu Nan putting on a defensive posture, he twisted his waist and the spear pierced out from his waist like a thick venomous snake, instantly arriving in front of him.\u201cAlright!\u201dIn the instant that the long spear pierced out, Chu Nan had already determined from various fine statistics that the speed of this spear was extremely fast and the angle was extremely tricky. Due to the long spear being 3.618959 meters in length, it had greatly reduced the distance between the two of them, causing it to stab towards him as soon as he attacked.Since Chu Nan could see the precise data, he was naturally prepared. With a shout, he raised his left arm and punched upwards, accurately hitting the lower part of the spear tip.In his calculations, the force of this punch was as high as 721.623893 kilograms, and it was definitely enough to send the spear flying. Then, he could take the opportunity to charge at Cardu and counterattack.However, just as his fist collided with the spear, Chu Nan suddenly felt an extremely cold and sharp aura coming from the spear.He only felt a chill pass through his fist. He knew that the situation was bad and hurriedly changed his direction to retreat. He tapped his feet and took two steps back. Looking down, he saw that the back of his left hand had already been cut open. A deep wound had opened up, and the bones of his hand could almost be seen in the deepest part. It was a terrifying sight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 - Kaff SpearPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe shocking wound on the back of Chu Nan\u2019s hand was clearly displayed in front of the audience through the special recording device. It immediately caused a commotion. It was the first time they had interacted and Chu Nan was already so seriously injured?Immediately, everyone felt strange.Earlier, Chu Nan had clearly only used his fist to hit the shaft, so why did it seem like his hand was cut by a sharp blade and was so heavily injured?Moreover, even if Chu Nan was only an Overlord Body Martial Artist, his body had already been tempered to a certain extent. Not to mention being touched by the spear shaft, even if he was stabbed by the spear tip, he should be completely unharmed.Chu Nan, who was on the stage, was also puzzled.He knew very well that he was definitely not injured by the spear itself, because the location he had chosen with his punch had completely avoided the sharpest part of the spear.However, when that fist and spear collided just now, he could clearly sense an extremely sharp aura, as if his skin and flesh had really been separated by an abnormally sharp blade.\u201cHeh, I told you to be careful a long time ago.\u201d After succeeding in his first strike, Cardu did not immediately pursue him. Instead, he stood on the spot with his spear in hand, still looking proud. \u201cNo one in the entire Phezzan Autonomous Region dares to underestimate the spear of our Illy family, and you naturally can\u2019t.\u201dChu Nan looked at him speechlessly.He did not show any intention of looking down on it. Why was this guy so anxious to prove the prowess of the Kaff spear?Looking down at the deep wound on the back of his hand, Chu Nan frowned slightly.If he did not treat such a serious wound, he would probably not be able to use his left hand in this battle. Otherwise, after a battle, his left hand would be almost crippled.However, he was currently in the arena, so how could he pause the competition and let him be treated?After hesitating for a moment, Chu Nan silently circulated the Nine Revolutions Technique.A trace of Internal Breath flowed out from his dantian and into his left arm. It had already gradually transformed into a high-frequency vibration state. Just like when Chu Nan received treatment in the logistics rehabilitation center of West Cloud Academy, he had completely simulated a high-frequency pulse flow.His Internal Breath circulated in his left hand a few times, and the wound on the back of his hand healed bit by bit at a speed that could be seen with the naked eye. It was simply as if he was receiving treatment in the logistics rehabilitation center.This strange phenomenon was immediately captured by the broadcast camera and entered the eyes of the audience, immediately causing countless people to be surprised.Although they had indeed heard of some magical Internal Breath cultivation methods that could treat oneself and even one of the Star-Grade Martial Artists of the Earth Federation, Supremacy Oville, who was called the \u201cSaint Hand Heaven\u2019s Heart\u201d, could not only treat oneself in battle but also easily use cultivation methods to treat others, didn\u2019t Chu Nan cultivate the Nine Revolutions Technique?Since when did the Nine Revolutions Cultivation Technique have the characteristics of healing\u2026Cardu took in the change on the back of Chu Nan\u2019s left hand and blinked in surprise before laughing\u201cThat\u2019s great! I was worried that you would be heavily injured in a few moves because you underestimated my Kaff spear and would be unable to perfectly showcase its strength. I didn\u2019t expect you to actually have such an ability, so I\u2019m relieved. Take this!\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, Cardu shook his wrist and stabbed again.Chu Nan narrowed his eyes and stared at the Kaff spear. He tilted his body and easily avoided it before slapping his right palm on the shaft.Seeing Chu Nan\u2019s actions, the audience could not help but cry out.He had clearly been heavily injured just now, but Chu Nan still dared to take such a risk. Was he that stupid? However, when he saw that Chu Nan\u2019s palm did not hit the shaft firmly like the previous punch, but only lightly touched it, he immediately retracted it as if he had only touched it lightly.After touching it, Chu Nan immediately stepped lightly and retreated. He lowered his head to look at his right palm and indeed, he discovered a red mark.When his right palm approached the spear just now, he immediately felt that cold and sharp aura again. When his palm touched the spear, this aura was even stronger. It instantly broke the defense of his palm and seeped into his flesh.Fortunately, Chu Nan was already prepared. As soon as he felt this, he immediately retracted his palm and did not suffer another heavy injury.However, Cardu did not stop like before. Instead, he twisted his waist and flipped his arm. The spear immediately stabbed at Chu Nan like a snake.Not only was there something strange about Cardu\u2019s spear, but his spear technique was also extremely outstanding. When he stabbed out, regardless of whether it was speed, location, or angle, it was almost perfect. Moreover, it perfectly complemented his figure, causing Chu Nan to have no flaws and could only dodge.Cardu attacked fiercely, and the spear momentum was like flowing water. There was no pause in the middle and no flaws. Chu Nan was forced to retreat continuously.However, the size of the arena was limited in the end. Before long, he was forced into a corner.If he continued to retreat, he could only leave the martial arts arena, which meant losing this competition.Seeing Cardu\u2019s spear stab over, Chu Nan knew that he could not retreat anymore. He took a deep breath and the Nine Revolutions Technique quickly circulated in his body. His Internal Breath condensed on his right fist and he punched out, hitting the back part of the spear tip.Cardu chuckled.Chu Nan had been praised by the media of the Earth Federation in the past few days. He did not expect that this would be the case in a real battle.He had clearly suffered a huge loss just now, but now, he still dared to send himself forward. He was simply courting death!With a move of his wrist, the spear pressed down. He planned to wait for Chu Nan\u2019s right fist to be heavily injured before taking the opportunity to react and sweep him out of the stage. Bang!When Chu Nan\u2019s punch struck the spear shaft, not only did it emit a muffled sound, it also emitted an ear-piercing sound. It was as if two rough metal pieces were rubbing against each other at high speed, causing the audience outside the martial arts arena to frown.Under this strike, Cardu felt a heavy impact on the front of his spear. For a moment, he actually could not maintain it, and the tip of the spear rose.Cardu cried out in his heart and hurriedly retracted his right arm. He retracted his spear and threw it at Chu Nan.Chu Nan had already taken the opportunity to dodge to the side and left the corner. At the same time, he dodged Cardu\u2019s attack.Cardu did not continue to pursue. Instead, he retracted his spear and his gaze landed on the shaft that Chu Nan had struck. He discovered that there was only a trace of red mark on it, and the blood was not as obvious as the first strike.\u201cThis guy is actually not injured?\u201d Cardu looked at Chu Nan in confusion.The Kaff spear was made of extremely special materials. Coupled with the special cultivation method passed down by his family, it could allow any part of the spear to possess extremely terrifying destructive power. Even if it was a second-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist of the same level as him, it was impossible for him to withstand the Kaff spear and be unharmed.Chu Nan was only an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist. Even if he performed well and even defeated a few low-level Internal Breath Martial Artists, his Overlord Body was far inferior to Internal Breath Martial Artists. The strength of his Internal Breath was also far inferior, so how could he not be injured?In the distance, Chu Nan was also puzzled.He looked at the trace of blood on the back of his right hand, and his expression was puzzled and slightly strange.Could there be such a coincidence?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - Nothing New Under the SunPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen he punched the Kaff spear, Chu Nan had already felt that something was wrong.The cold and sharp aura coming from the Kaff spear was clearly extremely similar to Internal Breath, but there was an obvious difference.Most importantly, this extremely cold and abnormally sharp aura even gave people the feeling that it was humming at a high frequency.Later on, after Chu Nan\u2019s right palm lightly touched the shaft of the Kaff spear and his right fist firmly collided with the spear, the two sensations confirmed his judgment.The strange aura coming from this spear was definitely Internal Breath that had been fused with a special high-frequency vibration state!The reason why this trait appeared was probably not only because Cardu cultivated a special Internal Breath cultivation method, but also because of the special material of the spear that he had mentioned many times earlier.This discovery made Chu Nan feel strange.He had only been inspired by the high-frequency vibration flow a few days ago and had grasped the method to make his Internal Breath vibrate. He had thought that this method was extremely special and that he was probably the only one who had grasped it. He did not expect to encounter an opponent who had also grasped this method today.\u201cHeh, there\u2019s an old saying that there\u2019s nothing new under the sun. It really makes sense.\u201dChu Nan laughed at himself and shook his head before focusing his attention on Cardu.Not only did the punch just now confirm the source of the strange aura on the Kaff spear, but it also confirmed that as long as the Internal Breath of high-frequency vibration was also attached to his fist, he would not be heavily injured by the cold and sharp aura.When the fist and spear collided just now, the ear-piercing and ugly sound that was like the high-speed friction of a sticker was actually the sound of two auras colliding.After confirming this fact, it greatly reduced Chu Nan\u2019s reservations about the Kaff spear.However, this was not enough for him to defeat Cardu.If he wanted to win this battle, he needed to try more.When he thought of this, Chu Nan did not hesitate. He stepped forward and threw a punch at Cardu.This was the first time Chu Nan had taken the initiative to attack since the two of them started fightingCardu glanced at Chu Nan in surprise and ruthlessly stabbed back.This spear was also exquisite. Coupled with the length of the Kaff spear, it actually sealed off all of Chu Nan\u2019s attacks, causing him to have no other choice other than to face or retreat. Chu Nan did not dodge and took in all the fine statistics of the spear. After seeing its arrival, he turned his body slightly and his right fist transformed into a palm strike. He used his Internal Breath on his palm and slapped the spear shaft.Slap!As soon as his palm touched the spear shaft, that special cold and sharp aura immediately assaulted him.urChu Nan clearly felt that this aura maintained a high frequency vibration. It was like a knife cutting through tofu as it directly penetrated the Internal Breath condensed in his palm and seeped into his flesh.Fortunately, Chu Nan was already prepared. After sensing that the Internal Breath he casually set up could not resist the penetration of the strange Internal Breath, he immediately retracted his palm and retreated.However, even if his reaction was extremely fast, he was still injured by this aura. A shallow wound was drawn on the palm of his right hand, and blood surged.The broadcast camera instantly grasped this detail. When Chu Nan\u2019s right palm, which was covered in blood, was displayed in front of the audience, all the Earth Federation audience who were paying attention to this competition could not help but worry.The spear in Cardu\u2019s hand was so strange that Chu Nan would be injured every time he came into contact with it. However, his spear technique was so exquisite that he could not approach at all. This was simply impossible.If Chu Nan was unable to resolve this problem, he would clearly lose this competition.However, if Chu Nan was defeated, did that not mean that one of the remaining two young martial artists in the Earth Federation below the age of 20 would be eliminated?Moreover, from the news coming from another venue, the situation of the other young martial artist from the Earth Federation, Tomler Hussein, was not too good.eIf the two of them were eliminated, wouldn\u2019t that mean that the Earth Federation did not even have anyone who entered the top eight in the group below the age of 20? That was a rare special reward that Supremacy Mu Yutong had promised!The worried gazes of the audience below the stage focused on Chu Nan on the stage. However, he only paused for a moment before he leaned forward again and threw a punch at Cardu.\u2018This idiot! He actually charged forward again?\u2019Before the audience could scream, they heard a muffled bang. At the same time, there was an ear-piercing friction sound that was much worse than before.Then, they saw that the spear in Cardu\u2019s hand was actually knocked far away by Chu Nan\u2019s punch, causing his weakness to be exposed, revealing an extremely huge flaw. Of course, Chu Nan would not let go of this opportunity. As soon as the shock on Cardu\u2019s face appeared, he had already taken a step forward and punched the air in his chest.Fortunately, Cardu was clearly extremely skilled in spear techniques. Although something unexpected happened, he could immediately react. With a shake of his wrist, the Kaff spear swayed and the tip of the spear was thrown back at Chu Nan.Chu Nan did not dare to force it and retreated to avoid Cardu\u2019s counterattack. He paused his attacks and quietly circulated the Nine Revolutions Technique to adjust his breathing.Although the attack just now was only a test, it had also exhausted a large amount of Internal Breath and caused him to be slightly injured. If he did not take the opportunity to regulate his breathing and treat his injuries in the gap between the battles, it would affect his combat strength greatly.The experience he recovered from this battle naturally came from tens of thousands of battles in the virtual space, but it was not something that the teachers of the West Cloud Academy could impart.Cardu did not pursue him. Instead, he held his spear and assumed a posture as he looked at Chu Nan with shock and confusion.\u201cHey, Chu Nan, you\u2019ve fought with the Kaff spear in the past?\u201d Before Chu Nan could answer, he shook his head.\u201cImpossible. With your age, it\u2019s impossible for you to have fought with Father, and it\u2019s definitely my first time fighting you. In that case\u2026 could it be that someone guided you?\u201dChu Nan could not wait for Cardu to give him more time to adjust his breathing. When he heard this, he smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s only the first day you took out your spear, so how would I know? If you want to say that someone guided me\u2026 other than the martial artists of your Phezzan Autonomous Region, no one else knows the strangeness of your spear, right? Could it be that you think\u2026 it\u2019s Supremacy Norman who guided me in private?\u201dWhen he heard Chu Nan mention Supremacy Norman, Cardu\u2019s expression suddenly became serious.\u201cAlright, regardless of whether you have any guidance, I have to win this competition!\u201dAfter saying that, he did not waste any time and stabbed out with his spear.\u201cHow unfortunate\u2026\u201dChu Nan took a deep breath and his figure flashed. He lightly slapped the spear.Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!In the blink of an eye, Chu Nan\u2019s right palm had already made contact with the Kaff spear dozens of times.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - High Frequency DominationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe audience looked at Chu Nan in confusion. The spear in Cardu\u2019s hand was clearly strange and he would be injured if he touched it. Why did Chu Nan still fight the spear head-on?However, from the various close-ups of the broadcast camera, although Chu Nan\u2019s right palm had made contact with the Kaff spear dozens of times, it was still intact.Compared to before, it was as if the special effect on the Kaff spear had suddenly disappeared.\u201cIt can\u2019t be that this guy called Cardu showed mercy, right?\u201d Many audience\u2019s puzzled gazes focused on Cardu.However, Cardu was also extremely puzzled.Chu Nan\u2019s palm had clearly touched the body of the Kaff spear dozens of times. He could also confirm that his special cultivation method was still displaying its special effects with the spear.However, every time his palm collided with Chu Nan\u2019s, he would feel an extremely strange force coming from his palm.Although this force was weak, it happened to offset the vibration of his Internal Breath after the special enhancement of the Kaff spear, causing him to be unable to unleash its power. Naturally, it could not injure Chu Nan.In the beginning, he would have clearly been heavily injured by the Kaff spear. How did he manage to find a way to deal with it in such a short period of time? The two sides had only come into contact a few times.Could this kid\u2026 could he be that talented?Chu Nan did not care what the audience and Cardu thought. He only focused on recording data after data.Slap!His palm struck 0.217818 meters behind the tip of the Kaff spear and the shaft.\u201c0.619911 kilohertz.\u201dWhen he felt the aura coming from the spear shaft, Chu Nan had already determined the frequency of the aura\u2019s vibration. He immediately adjusted the Internal Breath condensed in his palm to the exact same frequency. His Internal Breath collided with that strange aura. The same vibration frequency caused that aura to instantly lose its special, extremely sharp, and magical effect, only turning into the most ordinary and simple force. Naturally, it could only make the same simple collision sound.Slap!Chu Nan tilted his body and dodged Cardu\u2019s next shot. His palm struck a part of the spear that was closer to the back and another muffled sound was heard. \u201c0.626181 kilohertz.\u201dSlap!\u201c0.581109 kilohertz.\u201dSlap!After dozens of exchanges, Chu Nan had already touched the first half of the spear. He knew every special aura vibration frequency like the back of his hand. He even tested a few of the most important points to confirm that the data was not wrong.This also indirectly proved that Cardu\u2019s spear technique and his special Internal Breath cultivation foundation were solid, and there were rarely any fluctuations..After completing these tests, Chu Nan focused his gaze on Cardu and took two steps back to completely avoid his attack. Then, he silently circulated the Nine Revolutions Technique and instantly completed the Second Revolution Internal Breath in his body before throwing another punch.Boom!In this punch, not only did Chu Nan completely condense the powerful Second Revolution Internal Breath into his fist, causing the pure force on his fist to reach 1161.798619 kilograms. At the same time, he also adjusted the frequency of his Internal Breath vibration to the limit of his current control, reaching 3.681091 kilohertz.The fist happened to hit the front of the spear shaft, 1.072865 meters away from the tip.After the test just now, this was the weakest place in the entire Kaff spear.Chu Nan\u2019s punch landed. With the combination of the extremely high frequency vibration and the extremely powerful Second Revolution Internal Breath, it instantly suppressed the strange aura coming from the Kaff spear. Cardu only felt an extremely powerful and abnormally strange force invade the Kaff spear. As soon as it touched his hand that was holding the spear, he felt an extremely intense vibration. It actually caused his right hand to instantly explode and he could no longer hold on to it.As the Kaff spear flew out, Cardu spat out a mouthful of blood and involuntarily staggered back.At this moment, Chu Nan had already rushed over and threw another punch. Although Cardu barely raised his hand to block, his defense was broken by Chu Nan in a few moves. His punch landed on his lower abdomen and he spat out another mouthful of blood. His entire body soared into the air and fell outside the stage.From the moment Chu Nan officially counterattacked to the moment Cardu flew away, the entire process did not even take ten seconds!The audience below the stage had just seen Chu Nan being forced back by Cardu\u2019s spear attacks and was about to enter his blind spot. However, they did not expect that Chu Nan would so quickly send the spear in his hand flying with a punch. Then, he dealt with Cardu in a few punches. It was truly a sudden change that was too much for the eyes to take in.Immediately, the audience were dumbfounded.What happened?Why did Cardu clearly have the upper hand earlier and beat Chu Nan until he could not counterattack? How did he get dealt with in the blink of an eye?Chu Nan walked to the side and looked at Cardu who was lying on the ground in worry. In order to be safe, he had used the Internal Breath with the highest frequency vibration in the last punch, causing even his meridians to reach the limit of what he could endure. Under the unpreparedness of this punch, it was likely that his injuries were only worse.Although Chu Nan did not have the intention to be a saint, this was only a competition after all, not a life and death battle. He did not want Cardu to be crippled by his punch.Fortunately, although Cardu was lying on the ground and could not even get up, he still widened his eyes and maintained a shocked expression as he stared at Chu Nan.\u201cYou\u2026 how did you do it?\u201dSeeing that he was conscious and could even speak, Chu Nan was relieved. He shook his head and ignored his question. He turned around and picked up the spear that Cardu had thrown on the stage and circulated his Internal Breath into his palm.As soon as his Internal Breath touched the Kaff spear, it was as if he had eaten some stimulant. He instantly became extremely active and began to circulate at high speed.Chu Nan nodded and thought to himself that it was indeed true.When he was fighting with Cardu in the last few rounds, he did not sense anything special about his Internal Breath. As expected, the strange thing was all on this spear.In that case, it seemed that Cardu did not possess the special cultivation method to control high-frequency vibration of his Internal Breath like he had thought.However, this made sense.Apart from Chu Nan, was there another martial artist who had such a powerful data ability and could accurately control the frequency of his Internal Breath?If an ordinary martial artist tried this, a moment of carelessness would severely damage their meridians or even completely cripple them. Who dared to do this?Chu Nan thought for a moment before turning around and walking to the long side. He casually swung his hand and stabbed the Kaff spear beside him. He nodded at him and turned to leave the stage.The audience below the stage blankly watched Chu Nan walk down and only reacted after a long time.Chu Nan\u2026 won?He had won!If he won this round, it meant that he had successfully entered the top eight of the group below the age of 20!According to Mu Yutong\u2019s promise, Chu Nan would obtain at least a B-rank martial technique as a reward!This lucky kid\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - Rengal\u2019s AnswerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cLucky my ass!\u201dDong Fang sneered and turned around to look at Chu Nan who was lying on the bed and entered Martial Soul again. He then sighed.Actually, what the media said was not wrong. Chu Nan was only an Overlord Body Martial Artist, but he was able to defeat a few Internal Breath Martial Artists in a row. Now that he had even entered the top eight teams under the age of 20 and was about to obtain the B-rank martial technique of Supremacy Mu Yutong as a special reward, he could indeed be considered very lucky.There were even many people who called this a miracle because under normal circumstances, it was impossible for an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist to be a match for an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist.As for defeating Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists in succession, that was even more impossible. It could only be explained by a miracle.Thinking of a miracle, Dong Fang frowned. Mu Yutong and Norman simultaneously judged that it was almost impossible for Chu Nan to even become a Void Break Martial Artist in the future. In that case, normally speaking, the judgment of the two Star-Grade Martial Artists would definitely not be wrong. This meant that Chu Nan\u2019s future achievements would at most be that of a fifth-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist. It was impossible for him to break through this limit.However, since Chu Nan had already created such a miracle, could he also create another miracle in the future and shatter the judgment of two Star-Grade Martial Artists to become a powerful Void Break Martial Artist or even take a step further?In the end, what was the basis for the two Star-Grade Martial Artists to determine that Chu Nan would at most become a low-level Void Break Martial Artist in the future?Dong Fang thought for a moment and operated his personal terminal to pull out an interface.This was the largest and most popular martial arts forum in the Earth Federation on the Milky Way Network. It would discuss all kinds of martial arts-related problems, and it was very lively.Due to the increase in attention to the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition these few days, the topic was mostly focused on this competition.Among these topics, many were related to Chu Nan.Regarding the unexpected exciting performance of Chu Nan, an Overlord Body Martial Artist below the age of 20, everyone gave a high evaluation and were extremely excited.This was because Chu Nan had proven that even Overlord Body Martial Artists had the possibility of defeating Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists.It was also because of Chu Nan\u2019s exciting performance that countless people questioned the judgment of Mu Yutong and Norman. No one dared to directly suspect that the judgment made by the two Star-Grade Martial Artists was wrong, but why did they make such a judgment?Chu Nan\u2019s outstanding performance and super powerful martial arts talent proved that there was nothing wrong with the praise of Supremacy Mu Yutong. However, why could he not become a truly powerful martial artist in the future? It was almost impossible for him to even become a Void Break Martial Artist?Regarding this question, many people on the forum gave many different answers. However, because no professional or authoritative person gave a specific answer, no persuasive answer appeared.Dong Fang was very concerned about this problem because even if the two Star-Grade Martial Artists made a judgment at the same time, he was still unwilling to believe that Chu Nan would really be unable to reach the Void Break realm in the future.As Chu Nan\u2019s roommate for more than a year, he knew very well that the previous Chu Nan was indeed not outstanding and could not even be ranked in West Cloud Academy. To say that he could not even become a Void Break Martial Artist in the future was not belittling him, but simply a praise. However, in this recent period of time, his Nine Revolutions Technique had broken through to the third level, and it was as if he had suddenly obtained rebirth. Not only had his strength soared, but his entire body had also become energetic and filled with confidence, as if he had suddenly become a different person.As Chu Nan\u2019s best friend, Dong Fang liked to see the current him. Therefore, when Zheng Yuanlin expressed that Mu Yutong would not take Chu Nan as his disciple and later saw the two Star-Grade Martial Artists publicly say that his future achievements were limited, he was very worried that Chu Nan would be unable to recover from this setback and lose his motivation again. Fortunately, Chu Nan did not show any dejection because of this. Instead, he became more enthusiastic in his cultivation and did not even let go of any time to rest.However, the more he acted like this, the more worried Dong Fang became.If Chu Nan, who had put in so much effort, was still unable to break through the boundary of the Internal Breath realm in the future and become a Void Break Martial Artist, the impact he would receive would only be even greater.Therefore, Dong Fang really wanted to understand why the two Star-Grade Martial Artists made such a judgment of Chu Nan.He believed that as long as he knew the reason, there would definitely be a solution to any problem.After reading for a while on the forum, he discovered that although there were many discussions regarding this question, there were still very few truly valuable conclusions. It still made Dong Fang unable to obtain an accurate answer to this question. Just as he was about to leave in disappointment, he suddenly discovered a new post. The title was quickly highlighted, and in the blink of an eye, it became the hottest post.\u201cWhy could Chu Nan not become a Void Break Martial Artist? Let Rengal tell you.\u201dSeeing the title of the post, Dong Fang clicked it without hesitation and discovered that it was a video.He opened the video and saw that countless martial artists of the Earth Federation, as well as countless ordinary audience members, were familiar with the Heaven Control expert, Martial Artist Rengal, had appeared in front of Dong Fang \u201cRecently, many people have been concerned about a question. Why did Mu Yutong and Norman determine that it would be almost impossible for Chu Nan to become a Void Break Martial Artist in the future?\u201dAs soon as the show began, Rengal pointed out the theme.\u201cIt\u2019s not very convenient for me to answer this question in the program. Moreover, if I want to answer, it will involve many things. It\u2019s very complicated to say. However, many people are concerned about this question, so I might as well make a video specially to answer it.\u201d\u201cI believe what most people know about the difference between an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist and a Void Break Realm Martial Artist is that the latter can fly freely in the sky, but the former can\u2019t. However, this is only the difference on the surface. Do you know where the true reason for this difference is?\u201d\u201cThe reason why Void Break Martial Artists can fly is because the Internal Breath circulation in the bodies of Void Break Martial Artists has already reached a certain extent. Coupled with their long tempered and extremely mature bodies, they can trigger the cosmic energy outside the bodies. When the Internal Breath and the external cosmic energy reach a resonance, martial artists can use their Internal Breath to freely control the external cosmic energy. They can use the cosmic energy to soar into the sky and fly freely.\u201d\u201cIf they want to do this, the prerequisite is that their physical body must be tempered to maturity and the Internal Breath in the body must reach the perfection realm. In other words, this is the highest realm for Internal Breath Martial Artists. However, just this is not enough. They must make the physical body and Internal Breath perfectly fuse together. Only then can they incorporate the external universe energy into their physical body and form an Internal Cosmos in their body.\u201d\u201cThe process of producing this Internal Cosmos is extremely difficult. The martial artists of different countries have different descriptions of this process. However, in the Declan Empire, there is a unified title, called the \u2018Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate\u2019. This means that after passing this gate, one can create their own Internal Cosmos, step through the Heaven\u2019s Gate, and successfully become a Void Break Martial Artist and soar into the sky.\u201d\u201cThis process sounds like it\u2019s about this much, but in fact, it\u2019s extremely difficult to do. Even martial artists who have already reached the fifth-stage Internal Breath Realm need to work extremely hard to break through the \u2018Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate\u2019. There are even many fifth-stage Internal Breath Martial Artists who can\u2019t break through in their entire lives.\u201dAt this point, the expression on Rengal\u2019s face was very serious, proving that the Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate he mentioned was definitely not something that could be easily dealt with.\u201cNow, let\u2019s talk about Chu Nan\u2019s problem. I admit that Chu Nan\u2019s martial arts talent is extremely outstanding. His performance in the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition has even made me sigh in surprise. No wonder Supremacy Mu Yutong sees him in a new light.\u201d\u201cHowever, he has a very serious problem, and it can even be said to be a fundamental problem. As a result, even if Supremacy Mu Yutong praised his martial arts talent very much, he was not tempted to take him in as a disciple. It is the same for Supremacy Norman. They determined that it would be unlikely for him to become a Void Break Martial Artist in the future.\u201d\u201cThis issue is actually very simple. That is\u2026\u201dAt this point, Rengal paused and looked regretful.\u201cHe\u2019s already 18 years old this year, but he\u2019s still only an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist. He\u2019s not even a fifth-stage Overlord Body.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - He\u2019s Not the Only OnePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySeeing this, Dong Fang was still confused. Why was the problem because Chu Nan was still only an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist at the age of 18? Did that mean that it was almost impossible for him to break through the Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate and become a Void Break Martial Artist in the future?What was the connection?Fortunately, this video was not finished.\u201cEveryone knows that the initial stage of a martial artist is the Overlord Body. The so-called Overlord Body is the process of continuously tempering the body through the Internal Breath, causing the strength of the body to continuously increase. At the same time, the increase in the strength of the body means that it can accommodate more and more powerful internal breath circulation. It can be said to complement each other.\u201d\u201cThe process of cultivating the Overlord Body is extremely important to a martial artist. If the body refinement of a martial artist is not perfect during this process, then when they become an Internal Breath Martial Artist, their Internal Breath will not be able to circulate throughout their entire body perfectly.\u201d\u201cIf they take another step forward and break through the Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate, they will be unable to perfectly fuse their physical body with their Internal Breath. From there, they will encounter trouble when absorbing the cosmic energy of the outside world, causing them to be unable to break through this important barrier.\u201d\u201cTo any ordinary human, before the age of 18, it is the process of their body continuously growing. It is also the best time to refine their body and increase the strength of their flesh. Once they are past the age of 18, their meridians and bones will basically be fixed. If they use their Internal Breath to refine it, the effect will be extremely weak.\u201d\u201cChu Nan\u2019s problem is that he\u2019s already 18 years old and his body has basically matured. However, the degree of tempering of his body is still at a very low level and is far from reaching the extent of tempering and maturing.\u201d\u201cIf he has already become an Internal Breath Martial Artist or even a fifth-stage or fourth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist, I believe Supremacy Mu Yutong will be tempted and directly take him in as a disciple.\u201d\u201cHowever, he is not\u2026\u201d Dong Fang sighed and muttered in his heart.Turning around to look at Chu Nan who was lying on the bed motionless, Dong Fang could not help but smile bitterly.Who asked Chu Nan to not be able to come into contact with better internal cultivation methods when he was young? Therefore, he chose the Nine Revolutions Technique?\u201cWith Chu Nan\u2019s current body refinement, I\u2019m certain that his future growth will be extremely slow.\u201dRengal clearly felt that it was a pity for Chu Nan, so he continued to explain.\u201cPerhaps he can rely on his own hard work to advance step by step to an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, or even the top fifth-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist. However, this process will definitely be extremely slow and long. It could take ten, twenty years, or even a lifetime.\u201d \u201cMoreover, even if he can successfully become a fifth-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist, when he attempts to break through the Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate, it will be almost impossible for him to break through because the foundation he laid before the age of 18 is not stable enough. Simply put, there is a flaw in his body refinement.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s also a very important problem\u2014Chu Nan cultivates the Nine Revolutions Technique. I believe everyone knows that although very few people can cultivate the seventh level of the Nine Revolutions Technique, it is actually not like many people say. It is a true trash cultivation method. Chu Nan was unable to cultivate it to a sufficiently powerful level and complete the body refinement before he turned 18 years old, proving that he was actually not suitable for the Nine Revolutions Technique. It can even be said that\u2026 Chu Nan\u2019s talent in the internal cultivation method is not good.\u201dHearing this, Dong Fang was a little surprised.It turned out that there was a difference between external martial arts techniques and internal martial arts techniques in terms of martial arts talent?The external martial arts talent that Chu Nan had displayed in the previous few competitions was indeed extremely powerful. With his not particularly outstanding external martial arts technique, he could often suppress an Internal Breath Realm opponent who was one level higher than him.However, to say that his talent in cultivating Internal Breath cultivation methods was not good\u2026 was that true?\u201cThis is not strange. In the past few days, Chu Nan has fully displayed his outstanding talent in external martial arts techniques to us. It\u2019s even enough to support him in defeating an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist who is a level higher. However, this does not mean that his talent in internal cultivation methods is also very good.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which, I believe everyone should understand why these two Star-Grade Martial Artists do not think highly of Chu Nan.\u201d\u201cPreviously, someone asked me that Supremacy Mu Yutong clearly hoped to find a young martial artist who performed well and take him in as his disciple, but Chu Nan performed so well and he was unwilling to take him in as his disciple. Why is that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll answer you now. As a Star-Grade Martial Artist, will Supremacy Mu Yutong take in a disciple who will almost never break through the Internal Breath Realm in the future?\u201dAfter throwing this question, the entire video ended. Dong Fang stared blankly at the familiar face of Rengal at the end of the video and could not react for a long time.Rengal explained the problem very clearly so that everyone could understand.To put it bluntly, it was because Chu Nan did not encounter a good teacher when he was young and did not learn a good enough Internal Breath cultivation method that he was unable to complete the refinement process of the Overlord Body before he was 18 years old and build a good foundation. In the future, he would encounter difficulty that was almost impossible to break through at the most crucial moment, causing his achievements to be limited.However, such words were applicable to all martial artists who were still stuck at the Overlord Body Realm after they matured. It was not only limited to Chu Nan alone.Rengal gave this explanation. Not to mention that Chu Nan would be deeply affected by this, many of the West Cloud Academy\u2019s students would also be greatly affected. One had to know that in the entire West Cloud Academy, nearly half of the second grade students were already 18 years old. The third and fourth grade students were all more than 18 years old.However, there were still many students who were stuck at the low-level Overlord Body realm like Chu Nan.This meant that they would be like Chu Nan, and it would be almost impossible for them to break through the Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate in the future. Their achievements would also be limited.Dong Fang lowered his head and looked at himself.He was also 18 years old this year and his body had completely matured, but he was only a mere third-stage Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist. In the future, it would probably be impossible for him to become a powerful martial artist.Of course, he did not care.He was not too interested in martial artists to begin with. Even if he could not become a powerful martial artist, it did not matter.On the other hand, Chu Nan\u2026Dong Fang turned to look at Chu Nan on the bed and smiled bitterly.Chu Nan had always hoped to become a powerful martial artist, but from the looks of it, the hope was not high. His dream could be said to have been shattered.To be fair, Chu Nan could be said to have asked for it.Although he had not had the chance to come into contact with an extremely powerful Internal Breath cultivation method when he was young and did not have any teachers to guide him, if he had not chosen the Nine Revolutions Technique, an Internal Breath cultivation method that had screwed countless people over, and had only chosen an ordinary Internal Breath cultivation method, he might have completed the process of the Overlord Body and become an Internal Breath Martial Artist.Dong Fang would not believe it if Rengal said that Chu Nan\u2019s talent in cultivation was poor.\u201cDamn, this is in line with the old saying. One has to pay for the consequences of their own actions.\u201dLooking at Chu Nan who was lying flat on the bed, Dong Fang suddenly felt a trace of anger. He gritted his teeth and kicked, but it only lightly kicked Chu Nan\u2019s buttocks.\u201cThis idiot.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - I Want to Go to Star Cloud Academy TooPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWarning! Your body has suffered a slight external impact.\u201dChu Nan glanced at the system warning message that suddenly appeared and thought for a moment before ignoring it. He continued to focus on another system message.\u201cBecause I want to apply to Star Cloud Academy. I definitely have to make preparations. How can I play games?\u201dThis message came from Free Flower Pistil who tried to add him as a friend again.Ever since Chu Nan rejected the other party\u2019s friend request for the first time a few days ago and added a message, every time he logged into Martial Soul, the two sides would use this method to exchange a few short sentences.After staying like this for a few days, Chu Nan was actually used to chatting with the other party every time she came up.As soon as he logged into Martial Soul today, Chu Nan received the message from Free Flower Pistil as usual.In this message, she once again expressed to Chu Nan that it would probably be a long time before she could log into the game next week. Therefore, she hoped that he would quickly accept her friend request. The last time he saw her say that she would be unable to log into the game for a long time, Chu Nan\u2019s heart softened and he replied to her.Now that he heard her say this again, Chu Nan was a little curious. Why could she not play the game for a long time? He did not expect to receive such an answer from a new system message after the battle ended.Star Cloud Academy?Wasn\u2019t the recommendation opportunity that Supremacy Mu Yutong gave Chu Nan to go to Star Cloud Academy?He was going to the same place as Free Flower Pistil?After thinking for a moment, Chu Nan asked through the system message again, \u201cYour martial technique is so bad, but you can still register for Star Cloud Academy?\u201dOn Planet Macaw 137 light-years away, Elvy saw that Virgin 001 had actually replied to another message so quickly. She was originally a little happy, but when she saw the contents of the message, her nose nearly turned crooked from anger.\u201cHmph! So what if my martial technique is poor? It\u2019s not like Star Cloud Academy only has martial arts subjects! You martial arts fanatic! Lunatic!\u201dChu Nan was not surprised that the Free Flower Pistil would reply so quickly, but when he saw the content of the message, he could not help but feel a little awkward.That\u2019s right. Star Cloud Academy was called the number one comprehensive academy in the federation. Of course, it was not only the Martial Arts Branch. The other branches also had extremely high standards in the Earth\u2019s federation. There were even a few branch academies that could be considered top-notch in the several countries on the outside of the Orion Arm. Even people from other countries would enter Star Cloud Academy to study.\u201cThen what do you plan to apply for?\u201d Chu Nan asked again.\u201cWhy should I tell you?\u201d These words had already appeared in the information panel, but Elvy paused and deleted this line. Instead, she obediently filled in another answer.\u201cHuman genetic engineering?\u201d When Chu Nan looked at this answer, he felt an especially tall aura surge towards him.He had practiced martial arts since he was young. He had only received the basic compulsory education of the federation in his cultural class. His degree of education was only slightly better than that of an illiterate person.Chu Nan had only heard of the extremely popular subject of human genetic engineering in the entire Milky Way, but he did not have any specific concept.Therefore, now that he knew that this Free Flower Pistil was actually qualified to register for the Star Cloud Academy\u2019s Human Genetic Engineering Academy, he immediately looked at her in a new light.\u201cImpressive. I remember that Star Cloud Academy\u2019s Human Genetic Engineering Academy is very famous, right? If you can enter, you\u2019ll be too powerful.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dElvy could not help but laugh proudly.\u201cThis arrogant guy finally knows how amazing I am, right?\u2019If he knew that she had actually long been specially invited by Star Cloud Academy and was only participating in the exam to prove her strength, wouldn\u2019t he be even more respectful to her?Just as she was about to send another message proudly, she suddenly saw another system message.When she focused her gaze, she realized that it was actually a message from Virgin 001 about applying to be a friend! Elvy was stunned, then overjoyed.Was this guy finally willing to add her as a friend?Moreover, he was the one who took the initiative!This was too good\u2026Wait!Elvy rolled her eyes and snorted softly. She directly chose to reject it and added a message.\u201cHmph, you rejected me 27 times. It\u2019s only fair if I reject you 27 times!\u201dWhen he saw this message, Chu Nan laughed.He only thought of the possibility of obtaining Mu Yutong\u2019s special recommendation and entering Star Cloud Academy. In order to get to know a classmate in the academy in advance, he thought of being willing to add this Free Flower Pistil as a friend. He did not expect her to actually give such an answer. This fellow was simply like a little girl throwing a tantrum.Chu Nan shook his head and closed the system information panel to choose the next random match.After these few days of continuous hard work, his current level in Martial Soul had already increased to level five. He could choose to match without limit.This battle pattern would not restrict the martial artist levels of both sides. Instead, they would only match suitable opponents according to their respective battle records.Every time you won, the system\u2019s evaluation of you would increase a little. Then, the next opponent you matched would be slightly stronger than the previous time.Correspondingly, every time you fail, the system will lower its evaluation of you. The next opponent you match will be slightly weaker than the last time.By adjusting it like this, the opponent you match will always be around your strength. This situation was undoubtedly the most popular among the martial artists, so there were also the most martial artists who chose this mode.Due to the fact that Chu Nan\u2019s winning rate in the low-level match was 100%, when he chose this combat pattern for the first time, he directly jumped by several levels and was matched with a fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist.Subsequently, he won continuously. The opponent he matched up with in the previous round had already become an initial-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist.Chu Nan spent a lot of effort to win and was filled with anticipation for the next match.With his current strength, he should be able to defeat most initial-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists and contend with a few second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists.However, if he encountered a third-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist, it was almost certain that there was no possibility of victory.Now, most of the remaining opponents in the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition were already second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists.If he could encounter a few more second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists in the Martial Soul, it would allow him to have a lot of combat experience. It would help him obtain better results in the martial arts competition and even take the championship.\u201cVirgin 001, your opponent has been confirmed. Please confirm the battle.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d When he heard the system notification, Chu Nan did not hesitate to confirm. Then, his eyes flashed and he entered the system\u2019s arena.137 light-years away, Elvy stared at the system notification bar with a serious expression. However, she did not see Virgin 001 send another message requesting to befriend her. She could not help but feel a little anxious.\u201cThat damned guy won\u2019t give up just like that, right?\u201dAfter a while, she could not help but inquire about Virgin 001\u2019s status and discovered that he was actually in a \u201cbattle.\u201d\u201cHe\u2026 he really ignored me!\u201d\u201cWhat should I do? Should I apply to add him again and let him continue to add me? But I\u2019ve already said that. If I add him but he doesn\u2019t add me back, wouldn\u2019t it be a loss? But if I don\u2019t add him and he ignores me in the future, how can I continue to contact him?

    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 - Supporting the New PolicyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe next day, the finals of the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition continued. In the first day of the competition yesterday, the adult group had experienced three rounds of battles. The groups below the age of 20 had two rounds of battles, and they happened to determine the top eight participating martial artists.Among them, within the top eight of the adult group, the martial artists of the Earth Federation had unexpectedly reached three. Their results had exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations and were surprising. However, in the group below the age of 20, because of Tomler Hussein\u2019s miserable elimination in the second round, only Chu Nan remained among the top eight young martial artists. Naturally, everyone was disappointed.Could it be that\u2026 the young martial artists of the Earth Federation had really fallen to this extent? Only Chu Nan was left?However, if he represented the future of the Earth Federation\u2019s martial artists, wouldn\u2019t that be even more ironic?One had to know that Chu Nan would not even be able to become a Void Break Martial Artist in the future.If the young martial artists of the Earth Federation were all like him, the future of the Earth Federation would simply be dark. With this thought, when the audience of the Earth Federation saw Chu Nan standing in the arena again, their mood became extremely complicated.As members of the Earth Federation, they naturally hoped that Chu Nan could win again and win honor for the Earth Federation.However, when they recalled that no matter how outstanding Chu Nan\u2019s performance was, and that he could even obtain the champion of this competition in the end, his future achievements would still be limited, everyone could not help but sigh in their hearts.It was not easy for the federation to have a martial arts genius, but they could only watch helplessly as his potential got wasted. It was really painful.Rengal looked at Chu Nan who was given a close-up on the large screen and suddenly sighed.\u201cSigh, I still had reservations about the new policy pushed by the federation previously, but now that I see Chu Nan, I have to say that there is indeed a need to push this new policy.\u201dBeside him, the host, Diana, had a change in expression. She immediately asked, \u201cMr. Rengal, do you mean to explicitly support the \u2018Foundation Martial Skill Promotion Act\u2019 pushed by the federation?\u201d In the past two days, the Federation\u2019s Information Martial Arts World Channel had focused its attention on this West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition. Coupled with the competition\u2019s organizing committee, every competition in the finals had been broadcasted live, and a special program had been prepared for this.As a long-term fixed guest of the Martial Arts World Channel, Rengal had been actively participating in the past two days and had expressed many opinions and opinions on the program. However, this was the first time he had expressed his support for the new policy of the federation.\u201cYes.\u201d Rengal nodded bluntly. \u201cThe \u2018Foundation Martial Skill Promotion Act\u2019 is very necessary. Take Chu Nan for example. If he had come into contact with a suitable Internal Breath martial technique when he was young and built a good foundation, it\u2019s very likely that he\u2019s already a very good Internal Breath Martial Artist. His future achievements will be limitless.\u201d\u201cBut in the private recording, you said that Chu Nan\u2019s talent in cultivating Internal Breath might not be outstanding?\u201d Diana asked again.\u201cThis is only my speculation and not necessarily true. After all, Chu Nan cultivates the Nine Revolutions Technique, so it\u2019s impossible for others to determine his true talent. From his external cultivation talent, I\u2019m more willing to believe that his internal cultivation talent is equally outstanding.\u201dAfter a pause, Rengal continued, \u201cI also believe that there are more than one genius martial artist like Chu Nan among the billions of people in our Earth Federation. If they could come into contact with a suitable Internal Breath martial technique when they were young and obtain the guidance of a suitable teacher, then the situation in the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition below the age of 20 would definitely not turn out like this.\u201dDiana suddenly smiled.\u201cSpeaking of which, this West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition is really a little surprising. Under normal circumstances, this competition that has the most attention should be the competition of those powerful martial artists in the adult group. However, in this competition, the other young martial artists in the group below the age of 20 are the focus of attention.\u201dRengal sneered, \u201cWho asked these young martial artists of the federation to be too disappointing?\u201d\u201cThen, what\u2019s your evaluation of Chu Nan\u2019s performance?\u201d \u201cChu Nan\u2026\u201d Rengal was silent for a moment before sighing, \u201cI\u2019ve already said it before. In terms of Chu Nan\u2019s performance in this competition, it can be said to be perfect. In the previous few rounds, he defeated an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist and can even be said to be the inspiration for people. He\u2019s worthy of all the young martial artists learning from him.\u201d\u201cThen, can you make a prediction of his match?\u201d Diana asked again.\u201cThis competition\u2026\u201d Rengal\u2019s tone suddenly became relaxed,\u201d I\u2019ve specially studied Chu Nan\u2019s opponent in the upcoming round. He should currently be a second-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist and his strength is slightly inferior to Chu Nan\u2019s previous opponent, Cardu. Therefore, if nothing unexpected happens, Chu Nan will win this competition.\u201d \u201cIs that so? Then let\u2019s wait and see and pay attention to Chu Nan\u2019s performance in this competition.\u201d15 minutes later.Seeing that Chu Nan\u2019s opponent had fallen outside the stage, the referee immediately announced his victory. No matter what the audience thought, they could not help but cheer loudly.Chu Nan was the only hope of the Earth Federation under the age of 20. If he could win one more round, he would be able to earn more glory for the Earth Federation.However, after the cheers, most of the audience were still a little disappointed.It was really a pity that such an outstanding genius martial artist could not become a truly powerful martial artist in the future.The change in the mood of the audience did not escape Chu Nan\u2019s eyes, but he did not mind.In the past few days, he had experienced too many similar regretful and sympathetic gazes, causing him to be long used to or even numb to them.Although the two Star-Grade Martial Artists had determined his future, causing others to think that his future achievements would be limited and his talent would be wasted, Chu Nan did not think so.Be it the two Star-Grade Martial Artists or the other unrelated people, they all felt that Chu Nan had a powerful martial arts talent, but it was wasted because of insufficient opportunities.However, Chu Nan knew very well that his talent could not be said to be especially outstanding. Otherwise, he would not have been unable to break through to the second level after cultivating the Nine Revolutions Technique for more than ten years, causing him to be unable to build a good foundation and allow the two Star-Grade Martial Artists to determine that he would be unable to break through the Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate in the future. It would be very difficult for him to even become a Void Break Martial Artist.The reason why people felt that he had a very strong martial arts talent was completely because he had accidentally obtained the incredible data analysis ability that was equivalent to an A.I..It was precisely because he had this ability that he could showcase an extremely powerful talent in external martial techniques.Otherwise, with the martial technique he had grasped, not to mention continuously defeating Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists, even Luo Li was far from reach. It was impossible for him to obtain the qualifications to participate in this competition, let alone obtain the attention and pity of so many people like now.Therefore, Chu Nan did not take the judgment of the two Star-Grade Martial Artists seriously from the beginning.The two Star-Grade Martial Artists completely relied on their past experience to judge Chu Nan. This might be effective for ordinary martial artists, but in a special situation like Chu Nan, it was probably not completely true.Compared to the judgment of the two Star-Grade Martial Artists, Chu Nan was more concerned about another aspect.When he saw Yang Xirui squeezing out of the crowd and walking towards him quickly, Chu Nan directly went up and spoke before Yang Xirui.\u201cMiss Yang Xirui, do you know Martial Artist Rengal?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - Opponent in the Semi-FinalsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRengal stared at Chu Nan on the virtual screen and seriously sized him up for a long time before a smile appeared on his rough face.\u201cChu Nan, although I\u2019ve seen you countless times through various channels in the past few days, this is the first time we\u2019re talking directly. I\u2019m very happy to see that you can still maintain a calm mood and high fightingspirit.\u201dChu Nan smiled and nodded at Rengal.\u201cI\u2019ve seen you more times on the Martial Arts World Channel. However, in comparison, the video you publicly posted yesterday bothers me more.\u201dRengal laughed, \u201cYou really came because of that video. However, I don\u2019t think you came to find trouble with me because of that video. Then, why did you find me through Miss Yang Xirui?\u201dChu Nan glanced at Yang Xirui. If not for her, it would probably be very difficult for him to obtain the chance to speak directly to the famous Heaven Control Realm Martial Artist, Rengal.Of course, the most important reason why he could obtain this opportunity was probably his outstanding performance during this period of time.\u201cWhy do you think I came to find trouble with you?\u201d Chu Nan shrugged, \u201cYou only mentioned me in some of your analysis. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Rengal carefully looked at the expression on Chu Nan\u2019s face on the virtual screen. After confirming that this young man did not seem to be lying, he could not help but feel curious, \u201cYou also think my analysis is very correct?\u201d\u201cYes. However\u2026\u201d Chu Nan paused for a moment and continued, \u201cThere are some problems that I don\u2019t quite understand. For example, you emphasized that it\u2019s because I was unable to refine and mature my body before it got completely fixed, so it would be extremely difficult to succeed in breaking through the Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate in the future, right?\u201d\u201cYes. A martial artist\u2019s body is the foundation of everything. If the body is not tempered sufficiently, it will affect all future development.\u201d Rengal\u2019s expression was serious as he nodded in agreement.\u201cThen, what can be considered tempering and maturing?\u201d Chu Nan asked again, \u201cAlso, why is it difficult to continue tempering after the human body has completely grown? Will there definitely be flaws? I\u2019ve checked some relevant historical documents. In fact, even if we don\u2019t consider the entire Milky Way, just in the history of our Earth Federation, there are many famous martial artists who became stronger after getting older.\u201d \u201cThen have you ever checked how far these martial artists have reached before they turned 18?\u201d Rengal asked.Chu Nan was silent for a moment before shaking his head.\u201cThere\u2019s no statistics regarding this in the information. Only a few especially famous martial artists have detailed records. When they were young\u2026 they had indeed become Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists.\u201d \u201cSo? Do you think I\u2019m wrong?\u201dChu Nan fell silent again. After a long time, he raised his head and continued to ask, \u201cThen, is it possible that you can still continue to temper your body after you grow up and refine your body to an extremely perfect state so that it won\u2019t be impossible for you to break through the Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate?\u201dRengal looked at Chu Nan\u2019s hopeful gaze and could not help but sigh deeply in his mind. This kid was indeed still unwilling to resign to fate.After thinking for a moment, he shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t give you a completely certain answer. Although there has never been such a precedent in history, I can\u2019t guarantee that there won\u2019t be any exceptions in the future. Perhaps\u2026 you\u2019re that exception.\u201dChu Nan smiled.\u201cThank you for your consolation. I know that the two Star-Grade Martial Artists and you have actually already confirmed in your minds that it\u2019s impossible for me to break through that boundary in the future. However, I still want to give it a try. If I\u2019m unwilling to even work hard and give up, then I\u2019m utterly not worthy to be a martial artist, right?\u201dRengal\u2019s expression changed slightly as he glanced at Chu Nan with mixed emotions and slowly nodded.\u201cI admire you very much. Regardless of whether you can succeed in the future, I can confirm that you\u2019re a martial artist worthy of respect and praise.\u201dChu Nan laughed, \u201cSenior Rengal, let\u2019s talk about this in the future. The main reason why I found you this time is because I want to obtain more accurate guidance.\u201d\u201cOh? For example?\u201d\u201cFor example, what do you mean by body refinement and maturity? Is there a clear standard?\u201d\u201cAbout this\u2026 the standard for body refinement to mature is to first be able to allow the Internal Breath to smoothly circulate throughout the entire body without any obstruction. Of course, this is only a requirement in the meridians. It can allow a martial artist to better become a qualified Internal Breath Martial Artist. If the refinement in this aspect is insufficient, even if one becomes an Internal Breath Martial Artist, because of the difference in the circulation of their Internal Breath, their strength will still be slightly inferior to an Internal Breath Martial Artist of the same level who has tempered their body to maturity.\u201d \u201cIn addition, there are also requirements for the muscles and bones\u2026\u201dNoon had just passed in West Cloud City when groups of spectators gathered at the scene of the martial arts competition again.There were even many spectators who had come from afar who had never left. They directly finished their lunch around the competition venue and focused their attention on the draw for the semi-final that was about to begin in the afternoon.Unlike the preliminaries, after entering the finals, the opponents in each round would draw lots again. Therefore, before the result of the draw was out, no one knew who the opponents were.The competition of the semi-final would begin tomorrow, but it would be held this afternoon to draw lots to determine the opponents between the two rounds.To the audience of the Earth Federation, they were naturally more concerned about what kind of opponent the Earth Federation\u2019s participating martial artists would encounter in the next round.In the morning\u2019s quarter-finals, one of the three Earth Federation martial artists in the adult group had been accidentally eliminated. However, two of them still entered the top four and entered the semi-finals.The audience was very concerned about the outcome of the adult group\u2019s draw.If two martial artists of the Earth Federation were to draw each other in the semi-finals, that meant that one of them would definitely be eliminated.However, on the other hand, one person would definitely enter the finals.If they were separated in the semi-finals, then thinking about it negatively, it was possible for the two of them to be eliminated at the same time. On the bright side, both of them could enter the finals at the same time and the martial artists of the Earth Federation would definitely win the championship. Naturally, this was the best outcome.Therefore, the results of these two lots were acceptable. It depended on whether the prediction was pessimistic or optimistic.However, it was different for those under the age of 20.Chu Nan had obtained victory in the quarter-finals in the morning. Although it was exciting for him to successfully enter the semi-finals, according to the analysis of the media, the remaining three opponents were all extremely powerful young genius martial artists. Their strength was even higher than the opponent he had defeated previously.Among these opponents, the most shocking performance was Maruk from the Kingdom of Kexley and his participant number was 9527.From the beginning of the preliminaries, Maruk easily defeated his opponent in every match in a few minutes. He did not give any opponent any chance to counterattack and displayed unbelievable strength.According to the analysis of the various major media outlets, just the standard displayed by Maruk in the previous few rounds had even surpassed most ordinary second-stage Internal Breath Martial Artists.On the other hand, considering that he had also easily defeated an opponent with the strength of a second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist in the previous eight-to-four competition, he probably still had some reservations. His true strength would only be even more terrifying.There were even many people who guessed that this Maruk might already have the powerful strength of a third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist far beyond his age.If that was the case, it could be said that there was no possibility of winning if Chu Nan drew him.After all, when Chu Nan defeated a few Internal Breath Martial Artists, every match was extremely dangerous. He even nearly lost the competition.Although a third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist was only a level higher than a second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, their strength was completely different.It was extremely difficult for Chu Nan to defeat a second-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist. There was even some luck involved, so how could he defeat a third-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist?Therefore, before the result of the draw was out, many of the audience from the Earth Federation prayed in their hearts that Chu Nan would not face this Maruk.In comparison, although the other two young martial artists who had entered the semi-finals were also very strong, based on their past performance, they were probably only second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists. Chu Nan still had a possibility of winningAt 2 PM, the drawing ceremony began on time.Other competitions below the age of 20 were drawn first.Under the gaze of countless live audiences and reporters, Chu Nan was the first to walk forward and choose his opponent.A moment later, Chu Nan chose his opponent from the original lottery box and the name of his opponent immediately appeared on the virtual screen.It was Maruk.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Chu Nan\u2019s opponent in the semi-finals is a young martial artist from the Kingdom of Kexley called Maruk.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Mu Yutong\u2019s expression did not change at all. He only looked at Zheng Yuanlin in doubt.\u201cThis Maruk\u2026 According to the deductions of the outside world, it\u2019s very likely that he\u2019s already a third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist.\u201d\u201cVery good.\u201d Mu Yutong nodded but did not say anything else. Zheng Yuanlin secretly glanced at Mu Yutong and continued, \u201cTeacher, if Maruk is really a third-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist, I think\u2026 Chu Nan is probably not his match.\u201dMu Yutong stared at Zheng Yuanlin for a moment before asking in a low voice, \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d Zheng Yuanlin took a deep breath and gathered his courage.\u201cI want to say that Chu Nan\u2019s performance in the martial arts competition can already be considered very outstanding. Therefore\u2026 even if he was eliminated by Maruk in the semi-finals, shouldn\u2019t you still recommend him a spot to enter Star Cloud Academy?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Mu Yutong asked plainly.\u201cWhy?\u201d Zheng Yuanlin was slightly stunned, \u201cDid you send me to tell him previously that as long as he performed well in the martial arts competition, you would recommend him to enter Star Cloud Academy? His performance in the martial arts competition now is very outstanding no matter how you look at it, right?\u201d\u201cWas it me who asked him to be the champion of the group below the age of 20? Or was ityou?\u201dZheng Yuanlin immediately felt stifled and smiled bitterly, \u201cHe said it himself.\u201d\u201cSo there\u2019s nothing else to say.\u201d Zheng Yuanlin wanted to say more, but Mu Yutong had already raised his hand to stop him.Zheng Yuanlin glanced at the calm expression on Mu Yutong\u2019s face and sighed internally. He bowed to Mu Yutong and left the room.After gently closing the door, Zheng Yuanlin did not leave immediately. Instead, he stared at the door in front of him with a complicated expression.In the beginning, his teacher should have really cared for Chu Nan and felt pity for his talent.However, later on, because of Chu Nan\u2019s outstanding performance in the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition, he attracted the attention of many people, causing his teacher to have other thoughts.After his teacher\u2019s deliberate arrangements and even cooperated with Norman, he successfully made Chu Nan the focus of everyone\u2019s attention.Due to Chu Nan\u2019s shocking and exciting performance and the judgment of his teacher and the two Star-Grade Martial Artists, Supremacy Norman, on Chu Nan, countless people cheered and praised Chu Nan\u2019s exciting performance, but they also felt extremely regretful for him.Such a young martial artist with excellent talent had limited future achievements because of the lack of martial arts promotion by the federation. This was undoubtedly a huge mockery to the entire Earth\u2019s federation.The federal government had always been vigorously developing martial arts and working hard. Now, it was obvious that something was wrong to let such a young martial artist with excellent talent be abandoned like this.Therefore, with the push of some people, the \u201cBasic Martial Skill Promotion Act\u201d, that had been controversial after it was launched a few days ago and had even received clear objections from countless people, obtained everyone\u2019s attention again. With a clear example like Chu Nan, the internal public opinion of the federation had shockingly united in a short few days.They had to popularize basic martial techniques!They had to let all talented young martial artists obtain the chance to grow!They had to stop a tragedy like Chu Nan from happening again!The martial arts families of the federation had to contribute to the development of the federation\u2019s martial arts!The \u201cBasic Martial Skill Promotion Act\u201d had been in motion for three years. Before it was officially launched, it had encountered powerful resistance from all sides. After it was officially launched, it was even forced to postpone its implementation because of a large number of objections.This made many people suspect that this bill would probably end up like countless similar bills by the federal government and be unable to make any progress. However, after Chu Nan appeared in front of everyone, in less than a week, this bill immediately obtained the full support of countless people in the entire Earth Federation. Even the slightest objection would be quickly extinguished by this surging wave and the push was abnormally smooth.Just yesterday, the federation council specially held a full meeting to discuss and review the amendment to the \u2018Foundation Martial Skill Promotion Act\u2019. It obtained a full vote pass.According to the information Zheng Yuanlin had obtained, if nothing unexpected happened, the \u201cFoundation Martial Skill Promotion Act\u201d would officially be implemented next month.This time, no one dared to stop it from carrying out its mission openly.Even those powerful and deeply rooted martial arts families on Earth could not do it.This was because no one dared to face the wrath of all the citizens of the federation.Although the fundamental reason for such an astonishing change in situation was due to various factors, the most important reason was obvious. It was Chu Nan.Every time he thought of this, Zheng Yuanlin would have an extremely strange feeling.Who could have expected that it would almost definitely change the development process of the entire Earth\u2019s Federation\u2019s martial arts? The most important factor was Chu Nan, a mere low-level Overlord Body Realm young martial artist.Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s gaze was focused on the door as if he wanted to see through it and focus on Mu Yutong in the room. He had to admit that his teacher\u2019s vision and decision-making far exceeded others.The moment he discovered Chu Nan, he determined that he had superhuman martial arts talent.As the situation developed later on, he could also discover the potential value of Chu Nan at the first moment and publicize his situation. Then, he could use the ordinary citizens of the entire Earth Federation to change the public opinion and force the martial arts families of the federation to lower their heads and make way for the bill that he had always supported.This point could be seen from the fact that Rengal, a famous Heaven Control Martial Artist in the federation, had chosen to publicly support the \u201cBasic Martial Skill Promotion Act\u201d because of Chu Nan.Therefore, Chu Nan had actually become the best chess piece in his teacher\u2019s hands.The better Chu Nan\u2019s performance in the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition, the easier it was to attract the sympathy and pity of the ordinary citizens of the Earth\u2019s federation. It was also easier for public opinion to support the \u201cBasic Martial Skill Promotion Act\u201d.In the semi-finals that Chu Nan was going to participate in tomorrow, the relationship between the Earth Federation and the Kingdom of Kexley was not good to begin with. The ordinary citizens even disliked each other. If Chu Nan was eliminated by Maruk in the semi-finals, the ordinary citizens would only be even angrier and target the various martial arts families of the federation who had been heavily criticized.From this point, it would be more beneficial for his teacher if Chu Nan lost the semi-finals tomorrow.In the long term, the lower Chu Nan\u2019s future achievements, the more accurate his teacher\u2019s judgment of him would be. It also made the execution of the \u201cBasic Martial Skill Promotion Act\u201d more convincing.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dEven though he knew that the teacher in the room could definitely easily hear his sigh, Zheng Yuanlin still did not hide anything. He shook his head and turned around to walk towards his room.After entering the room, Zheng Yuanlin pulled out the contact list of his personal terminal and found Chu Nan\u2019s name. He thought for a moment and chose to call.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - Can You Win?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cMr. Rengal, what do you think the possibility of Chu Nan winning the semi-finals tomorrowis?\u201dRengal, who had been stopped for an interview, shook his head and smiled bitterly.\u201cI don\u2019t dare to say. According to my judgment, his opponent\u2019s strength should clearly surpass ordinary second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists. It\u2019s very likely that he has already reached the third-stage Internal Breath Realm. As for Chu Nan\u2026 according to his past performance, it\u2019s possible for him to defeat a second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, but as for a third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist\u2026\u201dRengal did not continue, but from his expression, it was obvious that he did not think much of Chu Nan.\u201cThen you\u2026\u201dDong Fang shook his head and closed this news interview. He switched to another information channel. The person who appeared was actually a martial artist from the Earth Federation. At this moment, he was participating in a certain program and was receiving an inquiry that was related to Chu Nan.Just like Rengal, although this martial artist did not explicitly say that Chu Nan could not win, he tactfully expressed, \u201cI hope the Federation audience can maintain their calm in this competition\u2026\u201d What he meant was that he did not think highly of Chu Nan. Dong Fang felt vexed and switched to a few information channels that were related to martial arts. He discovered that these information channels were all paying attention to the semi-finals that Chu Nan would fight tomorrow.In these programs or news interviews, regardless of whether it was those famous martial artists or so-called experts, no one was optimistic about Chu Nan\u2019s competition results tomorrow.At most, they would say that they could look forward to Chu Nan creating another miracle\u2026After hurriedly browsing through each program, Dong Fang\u2019s frustration became deeper. He simply closed the real-time information and transferred it to the largest martial arts forum on the Milky Way Network.On the forums of the Earth Federation, Chu Nan\u2019s semi-final tomorrow was also the most popular topic. The relevant discussion topics occupied more than half of the page.Dong Fang casually flipped through it and discovered that these topics were indeed mostly discussing the outcome.Like the various information channels, most people did not think highly of Chu Nan.There were even many people who asserted that if Maruk\u2019s strength was really at the third-stage Internal Breath realm, Chu Nan would probably not last more than a minute under him.Of course, it was not like no one had hope for Chu Nan.However, the most optimistic person could only hope for a miracle to happen\u2026Apart from this, there was also an interesting discussion.For example, someone had actually strongly criticized the competition\u2019s organizing committee. He said that since this competition was organized by the West Cloud Planet\u2019s government, it should be extremely easy to secretly control the result of the draw. Why did Chu Nan pick the strongest opponent in the semi-finals?If he drew the other two second-stage Internal Breath Martial Artists, Chu Nan had a high chance of entering the finals!When he saw this topic, Dong Fang could not help but laugh, causing his vexed mood to lighten greatly.If Chu Nan\u2019s strength was insufficient, he would still be defeated.How different was it from being defeated in the semi-finals and in the finals?If he was not the champion, there was no meaning in it. However, on second thought, this accusation was indeed reasonable.All the arrangements for the competition were done by the competition\u2019s organizing committee. It was very easy to secretly tamper with the results of the draw.Under normal circumstances, the competition\u2019s organizing committee naturally hoped that the martial artists of the Earth Federation could walk further.If he could enter the finals, even if he could not win the championship, it could be said that he had lost in the finals. It was not too shameful.However, Chu Nan had just happened to draw the strongest opponent, Maruk, from the hands of three opponents, causing the hope of the martial artists of the Earth Federation to win the championship for groups below the age of 20 to be almost shattered.Why?\u201cCould it be that this is the result of someone secretly manipulating it?\u201d Dong Fang could not help but rub his chin and frown as he pondered, \u201cBut the problem is, what\u2019s the benefit of doing this?\u201d After thinking for a long time, Dong Fang still could not understand. He could only give up on continuing to consider this meaningless problem.After browsing through the various analysis-themed posts on the forum regarding Maruk, Dong Fang sighed and turned off his personal terminal. He went to the dormitory balcony and looked up at the sunset that was falling towards the horizon in the distance.No matter what others said, whether Chu Nan could win tomorrow depended on him.As soon as he returned from the competition in the afternoon, Chu Nan was pulled away by the teachers of the academy. They said that they wanted to give him some last-minute training before the competition and he had yet to return.Now, was he ready?Bang!Chu Nan fell to the ground.The few teachers of the academy beside him immediately surrounded him with nervous expressions. The fourth-year student, Enrico, who had sent him flying with a palm strike earlier, also darted forward. As he stretched out his hand, he asked in concern, \u201cHow is it? Are you alright?\u201dChu Nan shook his head and rejected Enrico\u2019s hand. He gently straightened his waist and jumped up. He even jumped twice before revealing a relaxed smile to Enrico and the teachers who surrounded him.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not that fragile.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d The teachers heaved a sigh of relief.A teacher glared at Enrico and berated, \u201cEnrico, I asked you to come here to practice with Student Chu Nan. Can you pay attention to your strength! If you injure him, will you take his place in the competition tomorrow?\u201dEnrico touched his head and chuckled foolishly without refuting Chu Nan hurriedly waved his hand, \u201cTeacher, you can\u2019t blame Enrico. It\u2019s already very good that he took the time to practice with me. Moreover, the opponents in the competition will only be much more ruthless than him. I hope he can try his best. Otherwise, I won\u2019t be able to truly experience the strength of a third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, so the practice will be meaningless, right?\u201dThe teachers looked at each other, sighed, and nodded in unison.The training this time was specially arranged by the higher-ups of the academy. They specially invited Enrico, a fourth-year student with the strength of a third-stage Internal Breath Realm, to let Chu Nan sense the true strength of a third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist in advance and allow him to be prepared for the competition with Maruk tomorrow.If they asked Enrico to hold back, then this afternoon\u2019s practice would indeed be meaningless.Moreover, according to Maruk\u2019s performance in the previous few rounds, his attacks were extremely ruthless. He even broke the legs of Luo Li, the nephew of the Martial Arts Branch Head, during the preliminaries.When he faced Chu Nan tomorrow, he would probably not hold back.\u201cChu Nan, you\u2019ve been practicing with Enrico for the entire afternoon. How do you feel\u2026?\u201d A teacher suddenly asked.The other teachers and Enrico looked at Chu Nan.Looking at their gazes, Chu Nan smiled bitterly and shrugged. \u201cYou all have seen it too. Be it speed, strength, Internal Breath, or physical strength, a third-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist completely suppresses me in all aspects. It\u2019s very difficult for me to even fight back.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - Take Revenge in the FuturePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe teachers fell silent at the same time.Chu Nan was not lying.In fact, Enrico had already held back after nearly two hours of practice. However, he was still a third-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist after all, and he clearly far surpassed Chu Nan in all aspects.Chu Nan was able to exchange blows with a second-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist in the competition and even relied on his exciting performance to win. However, when faced with a third-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist like Enrico, he did not even have the chance to prepare a combat strategy. It could be said that he was completely suppressed and could not fight back.There was sometimes a world of difference between martial artists.From the looks of it, if Maruk really had the strength of a third-stage Internal Breath expert as most people speculated, there was no possibility of Chu Nan winning the competition tomorrow.The teacher who had asked the question turned to look at the sky outside the training ground and sighed.\u201cForget it, let\u2019s end it here. Today, I mainly want to let Chu Nan experience the exact strength of a third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist. If we continue, it won\u2019t be good if he\u2019s injured.\u201dThe other teachers looked at each other. After a while, they nodded in unison.Before they left, the teachers even patted Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder to encourage him.The teacher who left last threw a comforting gaze at Chu Nan.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be too nervous. Just properly unleash your strength tomorrow. No matter who wins or loses, you\u2019re already the greatest winner in this competition. Do you understand what I mean?\u201dChu Nan smiled and nodded. \u201cThank you, Teacher. I understand.\u201dWhat this teacher meant was that Chu Nan had already obtained a great reputation through the West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial arts competition and attracted the attention of countless people. This would be extremely helpful to his future development.Even if the two Star-Grade Martial Artists judged that it would be very difficult for Chu Nan to become a Void Break Martial Artist in the future, martial arts was not the only thing in life. Chu Nan could completely rely on the powerful reputation brought about by this competition to obtain a better life than before. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d The teacher patted Chu Nan\u2019s shoulder and left.In the end, Enrico looked at Chu Nan and wanted to say something but hesitated.Chu Nan smiled at him and asked, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s impossible for me to win tomorrow?\u201dEnrico remained silent for a moment before nodding.\u201cYes. Chu Nan, I\u2019m very impressed that a low-level Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist like you can defeat Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists in succession. However, I have to be honest. Your current strength\u2026 is still quite inferior to a third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist. I\u2019m actually very ordinary among third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists. If that Maruk also has the strength of a third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, he\u2019s probably stronger than me. You\u2026 shouldn\u2019t be able to defeat him.\u201dChu Nan was a little amused. This Enrico was really honest and spoke so bluntly in front of him. No wonder he was obediently pulled by the teachers to be his sparring partner.However, compared to the teachers\u2019 euphemism, he preferred Enrico\u2019s straightforwardness.\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d Chu Nan patted Enrico\u2019s shoulder, \u201cI know my own limits, but no matter what, I can\u2019t just give up, right?\u201dEnrico looked at Chu Nan and shook his head. He did not say anything else and waved at him before bidding farewell.Looking at Enrico\u2019s figure disappear from the martial arts arena, Chu Nan gently exhaled.After he entered the semi-finals, not only was he the only remaining student of the West Cloud Academy, but he was also the only remaining martial artist in the entire Earth Federation under the age of 20 in this competition. Naturally, he received great importance from the higher-ups of the academy. They even specially invited Enrico, a senior with the strength of a third-stage Internal Breath Realm, to be a sparring partner for the entire afternoon.However, this was not very meaningful.Everyone knew that it was impossible for Chu Nan\u2019s strength to advance by leaps and bounds in a short day and beat a third-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist. From there, he could defeat Maruk and advance to the finals.West Cloud Academy had only made these arrangements because it was their responsibility. They did not expect to rely on this to help Chu Nan win tomorrow.Although Chu Nan did not take it seriously, he was quite thankful for the academy\u2019s arrangements, allowing him to have a rare experience fighting a third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist.From the practice in the afternoon, a third-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist was indeed clearly superior to a second-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist.When he faced the two opponents, Saha and Cardu, who had the strength of a second-stage Internal Breath expert, although he was still at a disadvantage in all aspects, he could still barely keep up. Then, he relied on the powerful experience he had obtained from tens of thousands of battles in the virtual space to set up a combat strategy and make the most correct reaction. Then, he relied on his incomparably powerful data ability to accurately execute it and obtain the chance to win.However, when facing a third-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist like Enrico, he was far inferior in terms of strength, speed, and other aspects. He could not even follow Enrico\u2019s movements, so how could he talk about winning by counterattacking?Therefore, after practicing in the afternoon, Chu Nan could already give himself an accurate judgment. If Maruk really had the strength of a third-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist, then his chances of winning were infinitely close to zero.Chu Nan did not feel much about being unable to win. After all, he was only an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist and there were countless martial artists stronger than him. A failure was nothing.However, Maruk was extremely annoying. When he recalled that he was going to be defeated by him and saw his proud face, Chu Nan felt extremely unhappy. \u201cWhen I become stronger in the future, I\u2019ll get my revenge sooner or later!\u201dChu Nan waved his fists forcefully, but he suddenly recalled that he had already been judged by the two Star-Grade Martial Artists, Mu Yutong and Norman, that it was almost impossible for him to become a Void Break Martial Artist in the future. If Maruk\u2019s speed of improvement was extremely fast and he became a Void Break Martial Artist before him, did that not mean that he would not have the chance to win under normal circumstances?\u201cImpossible! My future is definitely not something that two Star-Grade Martial Artists can confirm with a single sentence!\u201d Chu Nan clenched his fists even tighter.When he thought of Mu Yutong, Chu Nan suddenly recalled the agreement with Zheng Yuanlin.Now that he recalled it, he had been too arrogant to guarantee to Zheng Yuanlin that he would win the championship for groups below the age of 20. At that time, he felt that he could already rely on his data ability to defeat initial-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists in the virtual space. Later on, he had improved, so it would not be a problem for him to obtain the champion in the group below the age of 20. That was why he had spoken nonsense.He did not expect that this West Cloud Planet\u2019s martial artist competition would be successfully held. It actually attracted so many young genius martial artists to participate. Not only were initial-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists common, there were even many second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists. Now, there was actually a super genius martial artist like Maruk who might have the strength of a third-stage Internal Breath Realm. This made Chu Nan uncertain that he could win the championship.\u201cHowever, no matter what, my performance in the competition can be considered very outstanding, right? Even if I can\u2019t win the championship, Supremacy Mu Yutong should still recommend me to Star Cloud Academy.\u201d Chu Nan thought for a moment and his mood was relatively relaxed.At this moment, a communication request suddenly came from his personal terminal. Chu Nan lowered his head and saw the name on the communication request. He was immediately overjoyed and did not hesitate to choose the allowed connection.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked at Chu Nan who was displayed on the virtual screen of his personal terminal with a complicated expression and finally smiled.\u201cChu Nan, congratulations on entering the semi-finals. To be honest, your performance surprised me.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Chu Nan laughed, \u201cAre you surprised that I performed well? Or did I perform too badly?\u201dSeeing that he still had the mood to joke, Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s mood became even more complicated.When he thought of what he wanted to say, he suddenly had the urge to immediately turn off the communication.However, he was ultimately experienced and instantly suppressed this complicated feeling. The smile on his face also faded.\u201cErr\u2026 I think your performance was not bad, because I never expected that you would actually be able to defeat several Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists who were a level higher. Very few Overlord Body Realm Martial Artists can achieve such an achievement.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Hearing Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s praise, Chu Nan was even happier, \u201cWhat about Supremacy Mu Yutong? What does he think of my performance?\u201d Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s eyes twitched slightly as thoughts spun in his mind. In the end, he slowly shook his head.\u201cTeacher has been very busy recently and did not pay much attention to this competition.\u201d \u201cOh? Oh\u2026\u201dChu Nan was a little disappointed, but on second thought, as a Star-Grade Martial Artist, it was impossible for Mu Yutong to come to West Cloud Planet solely for the martial arts competition. He must have other important things to do, so how could he place his attention on a mere Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist like him?With this in mind, Chu Nan felt a little more relaxed. He had a thought and asked the question he was most concerned about.\u201cThen\u2026 about the recommendation of Star Cloud Academy\u2026\u201dLooking at Chu Nan\u2019s undisguised expectations, Zheng Yuanlin sighed in his mind. He knew that he had guessed correctly and that Chu Nan was indeed fantasizing.He knew very well that the best way to help Chu Nan at this moment was to cut off his fantasies.However, Zheng Yuanlin could not bear to do this.At first, Chu Nan still had an excited expression and looked at Zheng Yuanlin with anticipation. However, after waiting for a while and seeing that he did not answer, Chu Nan immediately discovered that something was wrong. After waiting for half a minute, Zheng Yuanlin still remained silent. Chu Nan\u2019s heart skipped a beat and he had a bad feeling.\u201cSenior Zheng? Are\u2026 are you still here?\u201dZheng Yuanlin gently took a breath and focused his gaze on Chu Nan again. He pondered for a moment and asked, \u201cChu Nan, when I saw you earlier, how did you promiseme?\u201dChu Nan\u2019s heart skipped a beat. \u201cThis\u2026 I promise you that I will win other championships below the age of 20\u2026\u201d In the end, Chu Nan\u2019s voice became softer and softer.If Maruk really displayed the strength of a third-stage Internal Breath expert tomorrow, he did not have any confidence in defeating him to enter the finals and obtain the championship.\u201cVery good. It seems that you still remember the promise you made to me.\u201d Zheng Yuanlin nodded. \u201cTeacher is a person who values promises very much. Therefore, as long as you obtain the championship of the group below the age of 20 as promised, he will definitely give you a recommendation spot in Star Cloud Academy. However, if you can\u2019t fulfill this promise\u2026\u201dZheng Yuanlin did not continue, but the meaning of his words was already very clear.Chu Nan blankly looked at Zheng Yuanlin and cursed in his mind.Mu Yutong was a Star-Grade Martial Artist, so why did he care so much about the casual nonsense of a mere Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist?Wasn\u2019t it because he took a fancy to his martial arts talent that he was tempted to recommend him to enter Star Cloud Academy?Why did his attitude seem to have changed 180 degrees in just a few days?However, he had taken the initiative to make the promise of winning the group championship below the age of 20 in front of Zheng Yuanlin. Now, even if Mu Yutong grasped this point and did not let go, he could not refute.Seeing that Chu Nan was speechless, Zheng Yuanlin sighed in his mind again and remained expressionless.\u201cChu Nan, I admit that you\u2019re a young martial artist with very good talent, but you also know that teacher doesn\u2019t think you can become an extremely powerful martial artist, much less his disciple. Therefore\u2026 if you can achieve what you promised, teacher will also fulfill his promise to you. That\u2019s all. Do you understand what I mean?\u201dChu Nan was stunned for a moment before he nodded in a daze.Looking at him, Zheng Yuanlin hesitated for a moment before turning off the communication. Then, he sighed deeply.He knew very well that it seemed very cold-blooded and heartless to say this to Chu Nan, but since his teacher\u2019s decision was set, he had no other choice as a disciple.At this moment, it was easier to be cruel to Chu Nan and it would instead allow him to better recognize his position and not develop unrealistic fantasies. It was better for him.As for what happened afterwards\u2026His teacher had already determined that it was very difficult for Chu Nan to even become a Void Break Martial Artist, so he would at most be a mere fifth-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist in the future. Not to mention being nothing in the eyes of his teacher, a Star-Grade Martial Artist, he was nothing in the eyes of a Heaven Control Martial Artist like him.\u201cI hope you can be an ordinary person in the future and live your life safely.\u201dAfter thinking about the last trace of kindness he had for Chu Nan, Zheng Yuanlin shook his head and threw away all the thoughts related to him.Chu Nan blankly looked at the virtual screen that had turned into darkness and could not react for a long time.After freezing for a long time, Chu Nan revealed a bitter smile filled with self-ridicule and recovered.The meaning of Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s words was very clear. If he could not win the championship for the group below the age of 20, Mu Yutong would not give him the recommendation spot for Star Cloud Academy. Regarding this, Chu Nan had nothing to criticize because he had made this promise in front of Zheng Yuanlin.He just did not expect that Mu Yutong would still be so petty after seeing his outstanding performance in the competition.\u201cIs this considered reaping what I sowed?\u201d Chu Nan smiled bitterly and shook his head. He walked out of the training ground and pondered.Although the meaning of Mu Yutong\u2019s message through Zheng Yuanlin seemed to be too unreasonable, Chu Nan did not have the qualifications to criticize this.He was only a low-level Overlord Body Martial Artist who was not famous at all in the past. If he was thrown into a crowd, no one would take a second glance at him. However, Mu Yutong was willing to give him a chance to recommend him to enter Star Cloud Academy. This was already considered exceptionally generous.Now that Mu Yutong wanted him to fulfill his promise and win the championship for the group below the age of 20, Chu Nan had nothing to say and could only do his best.However\u2026 could he pass through Maruk and win the final championship?No one believed that Chu Nan\u2019s strength could advance by leaps and bounds in a day and defeat Maruk, an opponent who most likely had the strength of a third-stage Internal Breath Realm.However, Chu Nan knew that this possibility\u2026 was not zero\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - What Is the Overlord Body?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cStudent No. S278309451. Hello, Student Chu Nan. Welcome to the rehabilitation data center. Please choose the service you need.\u201dChu Nan straightened his body and lay on the treatment bed.\u201cA.I., give me a physical test report first.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dVarious devices scanned Chu Nan\u2019s body. Soon, a human test report of Chu Nan was displayed on the virtual screen.If it was in the past, Chu Nan would at most glance at the report and stop paying attention to it.To him, the only use of this report was to tell him what was wrong with his body and that he needed treatment to recover. However, now, for the first time, he began to seriously read this report.After a long chat with Rengal through the remote video, Chu Nan had a much deeper understanding of martial artists tempering their Overlord Body.Previously, his understanding of the Overlord Body was only to use his Internal Breath to continuously refine his body, but he did not know what body refinement meant.Through Rengal\u2019s guidance, he finally understood that the refinement of the body was not something trivial. It was a very systematic process. The human body was divided into muscles, blood vessels, bones, and many other aspects. If a martial artist wanted to refine the body, they had to move through all aspects at the same time. In the end, the strength of the body would continuously increase until the Overlord Body was formed. However, different martial artists had different specific circumstances. Some martial artists were born with powerful muscles, while others were born with strong blood vessels\u2026Moreover, because the Internal Breath cultivation methods cultivated by different martial artists were different, the effect of Internal Breath on the body refinement was also different. Therefore, in fact, the situation of tempering the body of two martial artists was completely different.Martial artists with complete inheritances could rely on the experience of their predecessors to better temper their bodies according to their own situation under the circumstances of having someone guiding them. Their progress was naturally much faster than ordinary martial artists.As for martial artists like Chu Nan who did not have a complete inheritance, they could only rely on themselves to figure it out. Often, they would be biased in the refinement of their bodies, causing them to drag down the overall progress and cause the degree of Overlord Body Refinement to be insufficient.After being pointed out by Rengal, Chu Nan had been thinking about how to resolve this problem. The two Star-Grade Martial Artists and Rengal clearly pointed out that because Chu Nan did not undergo enough tempering of his body before he became an adult, there were hidden problems within. When he tried breaking through the Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate in the future, it would be almost impossible for him to truly break through and become a Void Break Martial Artist.What Chu Nan wanted to know now was where the flaws and even hidden dangers of body refinement that they mentioned were.No one could tell him this because no one could understand every situation in his body.However, Chu Nan could find out.With his super data ability, he could be extremely precise in all aspects of his body.Coupled with the detailed test data given by the main computer in the middle of recovery, Chu Nan would understand the exact situation of his body more and determine how to deal withit.This report was very detailed. Not only was there the most basic heartbeat, breathing, but there was also extremely deep data on the activity of muscle cells, the evaluation of vascular wall toughness, and so on.After Chu Nan carefully read it, he got the main A.I. to pull out the physical test reports from a week, a month, and a year ago.After comparison, Chu Nan discovered that compared to a week ago, he had a very obvious increase in his muscle cell activity, muscle and skin toughness, but the increase in other aspects was relatively weak. This was clearly because he had used the high-frequency vibration Internal Breath to stimulate his muscles a few days ago, causing his muscle strength to greatly increase.Previously, he had thought that this was because he had grasped this magical method that the degree of tempering of his body had greatly increased, instantly rising from the initial-stage Overlord Body to the level of a third-stage Overlord Body. However, from the looks of it, he had only greatly increased the strength of his muscles, causing his physical strength to increase greatly. It was equivalent to a third-stage Overlord Body or even higher. The increase in other aspects was not obvious and could not be considered a true third-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist.Compared to the physical test reports a week and a month ago, he discovered that the various statistics of his body had clearly improved.The reason for this change was clearly because after obtaining the data ability equivalent to a A.I., he had broken through to the third level of the Nine Revolutions Technique. His Internal Breath had greatly increased, causing the strength of his entire body to increase greatly.Compared to the physical test reports a month ago and a year ago, although the interval was nearly a year, he discovered that there was almost no increase in all the statistics.This meant that Chu Nan had not improved at all in the past year and was simply wasting his time.After carefully reading these three reports, Chu Nan confirmed his previous thoughts. If he wanted to increase his strength quickly again, he could only use his Internal Breath to clearly change the strength of his body. Only in this way could he obtain a large increase in strength, reaction speed, and physical speed, allowing him to match the strength of a third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist. He would not be easily defeated without even being able to react.It was clearly impossible to raise the Nine Revolutions Technique from the third level to the fourth level today, so he could only start from his body.From the data, his muscles were clearly stronger than before, but he was much inferior in other aspects.According to Rengal\u2019s guidance, tempering the bones was the most difficult part. It was also the part that required the most time to polish carefully throughout the entire Overlord Body process. Clearly, it could not show any obvious improvements in a day. In that case, Chu Nan\u2019s main goal should be to improve his blood vessels. To a martial artist, it meant the strength of their meridians.After setting his goal, Chu Nan took a deep breath. A trace of Internal Breath flowed out from his dantian and slowly circulated in his body.In the past, when Chu Nan was cultivating and circulating his Internal Breath, he had only simply followed the scope of the Nine Revolutions Technique and did not think too much about it.However, this time, as he circulated his Internal Breath and observed the situation of the meridians in his body, he noticed a problem.The monitoring report given by the main A.I. was indeed abnormally accurate. The strength of the meridians that his Internal Breath flowed through was clearly much stronger than the other meridians. This meant that under the continuous refinement of his Internal Breath, these meridians were already clearly different from the other meridians.When Rengal guided Chu Nan, he clearly pointed out that a martial artist who had tempered their body perfectly could circulate their Internal Breath at will through every meridian in their body. This way, they could accurately sense the spatial energy of the outside world in every part of their body and produce an Internal Cosmos to break through the Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate.The reason why the two Star-Grade Martial Artists and Rengal determined that it would be almost impossible for Chu Nan to break through the Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate in the future was because the degree of tempering of his body was too poor. One of them was that it was obvious that his meridians had not been opened.Of course, Chu Nan did not plan to resolve this problem tonight. What he wanted to try was another method that might increase his strength as quickly as possible.He had seriously considered this method before and had even tested it several times in the simulation practice field of Martial Soul.However, this was the first time he had used it in reality.This was because this method was too dangerous. If one was not careful, their life might be in danger. Chu Nan originally planned to slowly test it in the future. After confirming that it was safe, he would use a less intense method to improve.However, Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s words today had stopped him from slowly improving himself.If he wanted to obtain the recommendation spot of Star Cloud Academy, he had to obtain the championship of the group below the age of20.If he wanted to win the championship, he had to defeat Maruk.If he wanted to defeat Maruk, he had to clearly increase his strength in a short period of time.If he wanted to increase his strength in a short period of time, he had to take this risk.Of course, Chu Nan could also choose not to take the risk and give up this opportunity.However, Chu Nan had practiced martial arts for more than ten years and had been mediocre for more than ten years. Now that he had finally changed and obtained a chance to become a powerful martial artist, if he gave up so easily, did he really plan to remain mediocre for the rest of his life?He couldn\u2019t accept this!Chu Nan clenched his fists tightly and raised his head with a firm gaze.\u201cMainframe A.I., monitor my body\u2019s situation at all times. However, pay attention. As long as I\u2019m not about to die, ignore it.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dWhen he heard the female voice agree, Chu Nan took a deep breath and threw away all his distracting thoughts. Internal Breath flowed out from his dantian and quickly circulated in his body.Subsequently, this Internal Breath did not stop. It continued to circulate through the previous route and immediately became much stronger.The Nine Revolutions Cultivation Technique, Second Revolution Internal Breath.Then, this Internal Breath still did not stop and continued to circulate.Third Revolution Internal Breath!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It made the entire treatment bed seem to have been soaked in blood and turned into a terrifying blood red color.\u201cHeh\u2026 heh\u2026 Roar\u2026\u201dChu Nan gritted his teeth, but he still could not help but let out a painful roar. His entire face had twisted into a ball and his body was continuously twitching.His exposed skin was covered in blood stains, and he seemed to have turned into a bloody person.However, Chu Nan still tried his best to control his body and not let it make any huge movements. At the same time, other than splitting a portion of his attention to forcefully suppress the pain, most of his attention was focused on the circulation of his Internal Breath.Previously, when he was cultivating the Nine Revolutions Technique, Chu Nan had already confirmed that with the strength of his current meridians, he could at most endure the Second and Third Revolution Internal Breath of the Nine Revolutions Technique. Once he underwent the third circulation of Internal Breath, his meridians would not be able to endure it. Therefore, he had never truly circulated the Third Revolution Internal Breath before.However, now, he gritted his teeth and persisted.His previous attempts were not wrong. After his Second Revolution Internal Breath passed through, it had basically reached the upper limit that his current meridians could accommodate.When he let this Internal Breath flow out of his dantian and circulate three times in his body, the meridians that flowed immediately exceeded the limit of what they could endure. All the meridians cracked, and even a small area was damaged.Under such circumstances, this Internal Breath circulated in his body, and it gave him the feeling of a knife moving through his meridians. All the places that flowed through it would bring him great pain from the damage of his meridians.This kind of deep pain was extremely difficult to endure. Under normal circumstances, Chu Nan would have long given up on doing this.However, there was a conviction supporting Chu Nan now, causing him to grit his teeth and continue.He had to succeed!He had to increase his strength!He had to win!Due to the pain, Chu Nan had no choice but to divert some of his attention to forcefully suppress it. Also, because the control of his Internal Breath had to be even more precise and accurate this time, the speed at which he controlled his Third Revolution Internal Breath\u2019s circulation was much slower than the previous two cycles. Correspondingly, this also brought him an even longer period of pain. However, Chu Nan did not even allow himself to feel numb to pain. This was because he had to clearly grasp the most precise situation after his Internal Breath circulated in every meridian. He could not make any mistakes, or else his attempt would be wasted.It was an extremely great pain, but he could not give up. Moreover, he could not try to slow down. He could not even divert his attention and allow himself to be in a daze. For the first time in his life, Chu Nan experienced the feeling of time passing by like it was years, or even seconds.Fortunately, he had only cultivated to the third level of the Nine Revolutions Technique in the end. The meridians that he had opened were limited. This factor that greatly limited his strength also prevented him from being forced to endure the pain for so long. Finally, after Chu Nan did not know how long he had lasted, his Third Revolution Internal Breath circulated through the meridians in his body with great difficulty. It was clearly much thicker and stronger than before and returned to his dantian.At this moment, Chu Nan could finally relax his tense mind.However, as soon as he relaxed, the intense pain coming from the depths of his body assaulted him at the same time, causing him to involuntarily let out a long scream.\u201cAh,\u201dAfter a long time, Chu Nan exhaled and barely calmed down.After adjusting his breathing slightly, Chu Nan spoke weakly. \u201cMainframe A.I., conduct a full-body checkup.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAll kinds of cameras swarmed forward and soon, they completed the full body checkup on Chu Nan.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, all your blood vessels have suffered varying degrees of damage. The various statistics of your body are at an extremely low level. I suggest that you receive the corresponding treatment immediately.\u201d \u201cAlright, I understand.\u201d Chu Nan exhaled and waved his hand, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for treatment. Continue to monitor my physical condition. Just like before, if it\u2019s not life-threatening, don\u2019t worry.\u201dThe mainframe A.I. did not immediately agree this time. Instead, without Chu Nan\u2019s order, it surrounded a pile of inspection cameras.\u201cWarning. Student Chu Nan, your current physical condition is already at an extremely dangerous level. If you continue your previous actions, it\u2019s very likely that your life will be in danger.\u201d\u201cSo, isn\u2019t my life still not in danger?\u201d Chu Nan smiled and thought to himself that this mainframe A.I. indeed had extremely high artificial intelligence and was completely different from ordinary A.I.S.\u201cWarning. Once your life is in danger, according to the procedures, I will force you to receive the corresponding treatment.\u2019\u201cAlright, isn\u2019t that what I want you to do?\u201dChu Nan glanced at the various monitoring devices that surrounded him as if he was facing a great enemy. He took a deep breath and calmed his mind. He closed his eyes again and focused again as a trace of Internal Breath emerged from his dantian.This time, he did not perform the Third Revolution Internal Breath again. Instead, he adjusted this trace of weak Internal Breath to a high-frequency vibrating state and simulated the form of a high-frequency pulse. He carefully and slowly circulated it in his damaged meridians.When he unintentionally learned this method earlier, Chu Nan discovered that this special Internal Breath circulation method could not only increase the activity of his muscles and cells, it could relieve muscle fatigue, treat muscle injuries, and even improve his meridians.Now that his meridians had been severely injured by his forceful circulation of the Third Revolution Internal Breath, Chu Nan tried to use this method to repair his meridians without relying on external help.With this experiment, he immediately discovered that this method indeed had miraculous effects.Due to the weak strength of this trace of Internal Breath in the high-frequency vibrating state, it did not cause any damage to his already injured meridians. Instead, it allowed Chu Nan to clearly sense that after this trace of Internal Breath flowed through the damaged meridians and blood vessels, it immediately seemed to have come alive and started to heal at a clear speed.After circulating it for a cycle, his meridians clearly improved.Chu Nan\u2019s mind shook as he continued to control this trace of Internal Breath to maintain a high-frequency oscillation state and circulate it in his damaged meridians.His damaged meridians actually improved bit by bit. The effect was even much better than receiving treatment from the mainframe A.I. After circulating it for 37 cycles, Chu Nan felt that his damaged meridians no longer felt any pain.He was still not at ease. He controlled that trace of Internal Breath to circulate for two more cycles before instructing the main control A.I., \u201cAnother full-body checkup.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dSoon, the monitoring devices completed their work.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, your physical condition is basically good, but the nutrition in your body is severely lacking. I suggest that you immediately replenish all kinds of nutrition.\u201d \u201cSevere nutritional loss?\u201d Chu Nan was stunned. He thought for a moment and felt that it should be because he had perspired too much earlier. \u201cHmm\u2026 then replenish some for me.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019m preparing a nutrition needle for you. Please wait a moment.\u201dAfter a while, a probe quickly approached Chu Nan. A thin needle suddenly stretched out from the front and ruthlessly stabbed into him.A warm current seeped into Chu Nan\u2019s blood vessels from the needle and quickly circulated throughout his body. He immediately felt his entire body filled with strength again and his mind shook.\u201cVery good.\u201d After receiving the basic nutritional supplement, Chu Nan clenched his fists and felt that he had recovered his vitality again. Then, he took a deep breath and paused for a moment. Another Internal Breath was used in his dantian and quickly circulated in his meridians completely. Next, this Internal Breath did not stop at all and completed the second circulation.Then, this Internal Breath still did not stop. It began to circulate three times again.\u201cHeh\u2026 heh\u2026\u201dThe meridians and blood vessels that had just been healed immediately began to rupture because of the powerful Third Revolution Internal Breath.Although he was already mentally prepared, Chu Nan still involuntarily let out a painful groan due to the immense pain.However, this time, other than the helplessness of enduring pain, he was also pleasantly surprisedCompared to when he tried the Third Revolution Internal Breath earlier, the pain was clearly smaller this time. The situation of his meridians being damaged was also clearly slightly weaker.This was enough to prove that after the previous damage and restoration, his meridians had become slightly stronger.Although it was not especially obvious, it was completely obvious.If not for the fact that he was still working hard to maintain his Third Revolution Internal Breath, Chu Nan would have laughed.It seemed that this bold attempt was really effective!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - A Domain No Martial Artist Can TouchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA small fleet consisting of two large civilian spaceships and five Chamber of Commerce-level medium-scale military escort battleships jumped out of the huge stargate located 263 light-years away from West Cloud Planet at a 29\u00b0 angle bearing from the Galactic Center.This huge stargate called the Mountain and Sea Pass by the Earth Federation and known as Namucuo in the Kingdom of Kexley\u2014the name of the Guardian Giant in the legend of the Kingdom of Kexley-was located between the Earth Federation and the Kingdom of Kexley\u2019s Star Field border, labeled as L1690T.Due to its special location, the L1690T stargate had become an extremely important stargate to the Earth Federation and the Kingdom of Kexley. It had also become the most important channel for business communication between the two countries. It was extremely busy at almost every moment.However, when this small fleet jumped out of the stargate, all the commercial fleets could only obediently retreat to the side and move out for this fleet, waiting patiently for it to leave.The reason was very simple. This fleet clearly displayed on the ranking list of the stargate that it had the symbol of the Noctem Chamber of Commerce, representing the officials of the Noctem Chamber of Commerce.To all the small countries at the periphery of the spiral arm, the Declan Empire was the target they could not provoke and be wary of. The Noctem Chamber of Commerce was the target they should curry favor with.The Declan Empire had the strongest martial arts system in the Milky Way. It had thousands of terrifying Star-Grade Martial Artists who could destroy small countries like them with a flick of their fingers.On the other hand, the Noctem Chamber of Commerce had the strongest modern scientific technology in the entire Milky Way. If they could obtain some technical help from the Noctem Chamber of Commerce, it would be of great importance to increase the technology level of the entire country.This was clearly much more important to these civilian businessmen.Therefore, after seeing this small fleet representing the Noctem Chamber of Commerce jump out of the stargate, the merchant fleets from the Earth Federation, the Kexley Kingdom, and the other small countries surrounding the stargate not only willingly gave up their positions, but they also racked their minds to greet this fleet and take the opportunity to pull strings.However, after this fleet jumped out of the stargate, they did not stop at all. They immediately accelerated at full speed and quickly entered the super-time mode, disappearing into the vast sea of stars. They did not give any commercial fleets a chance to approach and greet them.Rubes retracted his gaze from the window and turned to look at Elkart behind him. He smiled and said, \u201cDo you believe that if not for the five corvettes following us, those guys would have probably surrounded us? It won\u2019t be so easy to leave.\u201dThey had just ended their inspection of the Earth Federation. Now that they had passed through this stargate, as long as they performed another stargate jump, they could enter the Kingdom of Kexley and begin their inspection.When the inspection work of the Kingdom of Kexley was over, it meant that all the inspection work they had done on the periphery of the Orion Arm was over.Due to the fact that the previous inspection work had been very smooth and that there were no problems, Rubes\u2019s tone was very relaxed.However, Elkart still had his head lowered as he looked at the rows of data sliding down at high speed on the virtual screen of his personal terminal. He did not react to the words.Rubes shrugged helplessly.Elkart was this habit. As long as he started to process the data, he would be completely immersed and ignore everything that happened in the outside world.He thought for a moment, then sat down opposite Elkart. He sipped his favorite blueberry juice while waiting for him to finish the job at hand.After about ten minutes, the data on the virtual screen in front of Elkart stopped. He finally retracted his gaze and looked up, looking puzzled and a little lost.Rubes was surprised.He had worked with Elkart for so long, but he had never seen him show such an expression.\u201cHmm? What\u2019s wrong?\u201dElkart frowned slightly, shook his head, and looked at Rubes.\u201cI\u2019ll show you some of the data I just received.\u201dRubes was stunned. What data did he need to see?Elkart operated his personal terminal, and dozens of data documents appeared on the virtual screen.Rubes focused his gaze and discovered that these dozens of data documents were all human data reports.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to see?\u201d Rubes was puzzled.\u201cThe name of the person in the reports,\u201d Elkart reminded.\u201cOh? What\u2019s so rare\u2026\u201d Rubes glanced and was immediately stunned,\u201d Chu Nan? Why is it himagain?\u201d\u201cLook carefully,\u201d Elkart reminded him again.Rubes frowned. He knew that Elkart would definitely not do those meaningless things, so he looked at these reports seriously.Similar to the dozen or so human data reports called Chu Nan that had attracted their attention last time, the reports presented in front of Rubes were also continuously produced.However, compared to the previous time, the time period was much longer this time. The gap between the first and last set was as long as 5 hours and 42 minutes on Earth. With his previous experience, Rubes focused his attention on the data changes produced by each report. After reading more than ten copies in a row, Rubes immediately noticed a problem.In these human body data reports, there were no obvious changes in the other human data related to Chu Nan, but there was a very obvious increase in the activity of blood vessels and cells.Compared to the first and last report, Chu Nan\u2019s vascular cell activity had actually increased by more than three times! \u201cHow is this possible?!\u201d After reading the detailed data on the last report, Rubes could not help but cry out in surprise.Previously, after seeing the dozen or so human body data reports that Chu Nan had produced in a short period of time, although he was surprised, the data that Chu Nan had clearly increased last time was mainly related to his muscle strength. It could be said that he had used a special method or even a method that had an extremely strong negative effect like certain special drugs.However, this time, Chu Nan\u2019s main improvement was actually blood vessel cell activity! This was something that even the Noctem Chamber of Commerce could not do with their super technology in the human body, let alone a remote small country like the Earth Federation.However, the truth was in front of Rubes\u2019s eyes, so he had no choice but to believe it. \u201cHey, Elkart, is the mainframe A.I. on West Cloud Planet really fine?\u201dElkart glanced at him and shrugged. \u201cIn any case, Director Lyons said that there\u2019s no problem.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s really no problem?\u201d Rubes stared at the data on the virtual screen with a deep frown.Elkart looked at him strangely.\u201cRubes, why are you so nervous? In my opinion, it\u2019s nothing more than this person called Chu Nan from the Earth Federation cultivating a special martial technique.\u201d \u201cNo\u2026\u201d Rubes slowly shook his head,\u201d Elkart, although you can see that these numbers are wrong, you\u2019re not a martial artist after all. You don\u2019t understand the true meaning of these numbers. If all the relevant data about Chu Nan is true, it proves that he has likely reached a domain that almost no martial artist can touch.\u201cIs it that exaggerated?\u201d Elkart was stunned, \u201cFrom the data, he\u2019s at most an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s precisely because he\u2019s only an Overlord Body Realm Martial Artist that his uniqueness is revealed.\u201d Rubes pondered for a moment before opening his personal terminal and sending out two commands respectively. Then, he said to Elkart, \u201cI\u2019ve already ordered the Earth\u2019s Federation Branch Office to increase the level of attention they pay to Chu Nan. In addition, Elkart, I\u2019ll get Lyons to arrange all the data related to Chu Nan. I\u2019ll send it to you in a while and you can help me deal with it.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Although Elkart was a little puzzled, he still nodded when he saw Rubes\u2019s serious expression. Then, his heart stirred and he asked, \u201cRubes, do you still remember what I told you last time? The small country of the Earth Federation is different from the other small countries in the Milky Way. Would it often create miracles? Do you think\u2026 this Chu Nan will also create miracles and might become a Star-Grade Martial Artist in the future?\u201dRubes thought for a moment, then shook his head with a bitter smile.\u201cIf it was before today, I would tell you that it\u2019s impossible. But now\u2026\u201d Rubes\u2019s gaze landed on the data on the virtual screen of Elkart\u2019s personal terminal with a complicated expression.\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - Risk and ResultPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhoosh\u2026Chu Nan let out a long breath and relaxed his body for the first time.Although the meridians in his body had already been repaired by him using the high-frequency vibration Internal Breath again, the pain still could not be eliminated, as if it had already taken root in his meridians.Tilting his head, he looked at the time and discovered that it was already 11:53 PM in the local time, close to midnight. Chu Nan quietly lay on the treatment bed. The stench of blood mixed with sweat continuously surged into his nostrils and was extremely unbearable. However, he could not even be bothered to wrinkle his nose, let alone raise his hand to cover his mouth and nose. No matter how unbearable the smell was, he still breathed heavily, his heart filled with joy.It was great that he was still alive!In the past five hours, Chu Nan had forcefully circulated his Third Revolution Internal Breath. His meridians had been damaged and even shattered due to the powerful internal breath that exceeded the burden.The pain that went deep into his blood vessels continuously tortured him, making him feel like he was infinitely close to death every time.If not for the detailed data received in his mind coupled with the data report given by the mainframe A.I. proving that he was not really in danger, Chu Nan would have thought that he had died dozens of times.However, not encountering any life-threatening danger did not mean that he was completely fine.Each circulation of the Third Revolution Internal Breath was a huge test of his willpower and life force. It was also a huge test for him to maintain precise control of his Internal Breath in extreme pain.In the dozens of experiments just now, if he was unable to accurately control his Internal Breath because of the pain caused by the Third Revolution Internal Breath, causing his Internal Breath to lose control, it was very likely that his meridians, which were already unable to endure the Internal Breath, would be completely broken.At that time, not only would his meridians be damaged, the most likely thing would be for the powerful Third Revolution Internal Breath to directly flow into the other still undeveloped meridians in his body and ultimately completely lose control, causing the meridians in his entire body to shatter.If that was the case, Chu Nan would probably lose too much blood because of the shattered meridians in his entire body. It was very likely that he would die on the spot immediately. Even if the mainframe A.I. reacted extremely quickly and immediately took action the moment it discovered that Chu Nan was in danger, it could at most protect his life and could not do anything else. He would still be heavily injured.Although with the powerful scientific technology of the modern era, even if Chu Nan\u2019s meridians were shattered, he still had hope of successfully healing them in the future and might even completely recover.However, meridians were the foundation of Internal Breath circulation for a martial artist. Once the meridians were damaged too severely, even if they could recover in the future, it would definitely affect the martial artist\u2019s path.Chu Nan had tried 36 times in the previous five hours. Every time was an abnormally dangerous action. No ordinary martial artist would dare to do this.Of course, there were not many martial artists who cultivated the Nine Revolutions Technique, and those who could cultivate to the third level and master the Third Revolution Internal Breath were even rarer.As for the ability to forcefully circulate his Internal Breath into the third cycle and accurately control the strength of his Internal Breath to just exceed the limit that his meridians could endure without completely losing control, only Chu Nan, who had the super data ability, could do it.Apart from that, only Chu Nan had the ability to control his Internal Breath to a high-frequency vibration state and simulate the pulse resonance in his meridians to stimulate the potential of his meridians to repair the ability to heal his meridians.The risks and pain to do so are terrifying, but the benefits are enormous.After the meridians were damaged and repaired 36 times, through the data he had grasped and the data report given by the mainframe A.I., he could accurately determine that the toughness of the blood vessels in his body had greatly increased compared to before.When he tried it for the first time, any part of his meridians that the Third Revolution Internal Breath circulated would immediately be damaged because he could not endure it.Now, after performing the Third Revolution Internal Breath, the flow in his meridians had already become extremely smooth. His meridians could completely endure it.Feeling the surging Third Revolution Internal Breath circulating in his meridians, Chu Nan could not help but smile.With the support of a much stronger Internal Breath, it meant that he had an even stronger body than before. This also meant that he had the possibility of resisting a third-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist.Moreover, this adventure that lasted more than five hours not only increased the strength of his meridians, but also the strength of his muscles.In fact, from the data report given by the mainframe A.I., some of his bone density had even increased slightly.According to the actual meaning of the Overlord Body that Rengal had explained to Chu Nan in detail, the current him could be said to have truly obtained an obvious increase in the Overlord Body.If it was said that Chu Nan had used the simulation of high-frequency pulses and his own high-frequency vibration Internal Breath to stimulate his muscles, causing the strength of his muscles to reach the level of a third-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist, then this risk today was the true increase in his Overlord Body in all aspects.The current him could already be said to be not inferior to any fourth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist in any aspect in terms of body refinement!\u201cPhew\u2026 In the end, there\u2019s still too little time. If you give me enough time to slowly refine and increase my strength, I wouldn\u2019t have to take such a risk.\u201dChu Nan gently exhaled and shook his head before getting up from the bed with difficulty.If he had a choice, Chu Nan was naturally unwilling to take such a risk.However, Zheng Yuanlin\u2019s words clearly told him that if he did not win the championship, he would not be able to obtain the special recommendation spot given by Mu Yutong.If he could not enter Star Cloud Academy, Chu Nan was certain that it was impossible for him to come into contact with profound martial techniques in his life.Mu Yutong and the two Star-Grade Martial Artists judged at the same time that he would be unable to break through the Cosmic Heaven\u2019s Gate in the future. In the eyes of others, letting him come into contact with profound martial techniques was also a waste and meaningless action.After all, what was the use of grasping profound martial techniques for a low-level martial artist who could only stay in the Internal Breath realm for life?Therefore, if Chu Nan wanted to continue walking down the path of martial arts, he had to grasp every opportunity. After sitting on the treatment bed and resting for a while, Chu Nan felt extremely exhausted. It was as if his entire body had been emptied and he only wanted to fall asleep.However, he also knew that it was impossible to sleep here for a night.Not to mention anything else, just the sight of the blood covered bed under him was not visible.\u201cA.I., give me another dose of nutrition needles.\u201d Chu Nan weakly instructed.\u201cStudent Chu Nan, your body is no longer suitable for receiving nutritional injections. The most suitable way for you to recover is to sleep for a long time.\u201d \u201cOh? In that case, can I just sleep?\u201d Chu Nan was a little surprised. He did not expect that he could not even inject nutrition needles in his situation.However, thinking about it, it made sense. During the \u201cself-harm\u201d process that lasted more than five hours, the mainframe A.I. had already injected him with seven nutrition needles.There was a limit to the absorption of the human body. It was obvious that injecting another nutrition needle would be useless.\u201cYes.\u201dWhen he heard the answer from the mainframe A.I., Chu Nan nodded and composed himself. He forcefully got out of the bed and slowly moved out of the logistics rehabilitation center.Fortunately, it was already close to night and there was no one in the academy. Naturally, they did not discover Chu Nan\u2019s miserable appearance.Chu Nan slowly moved back to the dormitory with difficulty and discovered that Dong Fang was already sleeping like a dead pig.He glanced at his bed beside him and immediately, an irresistible exhaustion surged from his bones and swept through his entire body. His body fell and he fell asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Wake up!\u201dFeeling that his face was being lightly slapped, Chu Nan woke up in a daze.When he opened his eyes, he was not surprised to see Dong Fang\u2019s chubby face. \u201cAh\u2026 What\u2019s wrong? It\u2019s already morning?\u201d \u201cIn the morning?\u201d Dong Fang\u2019s small eyes suddenly jumped, \u201cIt\u2019s almost noon! If you still don\u2019t get up, are you planning to forfeit the semi-finals?\u201d\u201cSemi-finals? Semi-finals\u2026\u201d Chu Nan muttered in a daze. His body suddenly shivered and he woke up. He stood up and jumped out of the bed,\u201d Damn, what time is it now? The semi-finals haven\u2019t started, right?\u201d.Seeing that Chu Nan had instantly recovered, Dong Fang smiled.\u201cAlright, I\u2019m just scaring you. It\u2019s only 8 AM now. However, if you don\u2019t prepare yourself, you might really miss the semi-finals.\u201dAfter saying that, Dong Fang glanced at Chu Nan with a strange expression. \u201cI say\u2026 It\u2019s not a problem for the teachers of the academy to call you for special training yesterday, but is it really good to injure your entire body? With your current state, can you really get to the semi-finals?\u201d \u201cOh? My entire body is covered in injuries?\u201dChu Nan lowered his head in confusion and immediately discovered that his entire body was covered in blood and he looked extremely miserable.Only then did he remember that he had not cared about anything after returning last night and had fallen asleep immediately. He had brought back all his blood after the risky experiment.His nose twitched and he immediately smelled the thick stench of blood mixed with sweat. Chu Nan shook his head and darted into the bathroom of the dormitory.Swoosh! Swoosh!The milky white liquid mixed with shower gel, as well as blood and sweat stains rolled down Chu Nan\u2019s body, causing him to instantly feel much more refreshed. Even every pore on his body seemed to be desperately opening up as he breathed in the surrounding fresh air. Chu Nan felt the pleasure of the water flowing through his body as he circulated his Internal Breath and felt the different feeling of his Internal Breath circulating in his meridians.Due to his exhaustion last night, he did not feel much.After a good sleep, his mind had completely recovered. Chu Nan inspected himself again and discovered that the bold experiment that he had risked his life last night had brought him far more benefits than he had imagined.Last night, he only had time to experience the increase in the strength of his body-in other words, the Overlord Body. However, after letting his Internal Breath circulate in his meridians again today, he discovered that the circulation of his Internal Breath was clearly much smoother, so the speed of its circulation was much faster.This meant that the speed at which he mobilized his Internal Breath would increase.Bang!With a punch, the water flow suddenly exploded. Water droplets smashed into the wall around the bathroom, making cracking sounds.Chu Nan nodded in satisfaction.Through this punch, he confirmed that as the speed of his Internal Breath circulation increased, the time needed to complete the Second Revolution Internal Breath was much shorter than before.Before this, when he mobilized the Second Revolution Internal Breath, the time needed to use it on his fist was approximately 1.161986 to 1.361906 seconds.Now that his meridians had been strengthened, the time needed to mobilize his Second Revolution Internal Breath in this punch was 0.963911 seconds.Although it was only a mere 0.2-0.4 seconds, the battle between martial artists was intense. Even if it was only 0.2 seconds, it was already a very important increase.Specifically, because it took more than a second for Chu Nan to use his Second Revolution Internal Breath, it was clearly impossible for him to have so much time to easily adjust his breathing in an intense battle. Therefore, every time he used it, he had to calculate the subsequent battle process in advance and accurately calculate every move and stance of the enemy before he could coincidentally coordinate with his Second Revolution Internal Breath to launch counterattacks everywhere.However, now that he had shortened the time to less than a second, it meant that the time he needed to calculate had obviously decreased. The decrease in computational requirement also gave him more time to calmly arrange and to react in time when he encountered an accident.Bang!Chu Nan threw another punch and the water exploded again.Water droplets smashed into the wall again, the slapping sounds much louder than before.In this punch just now, he had advanced his Internal Breath to the third cycle. The strength of the Internal Breath attached to his fist had increased by 27.31% compared to the second cycle. The strength of his fist had actually reached an astonishing 1481.76 kilograms!The large increase in his Internal Breath as well as the small increase in the strength of his body caused Chu Nan\u2019s fist strength to increase greatly.This force not only far surpassed Luo Li, a fifth-stage Overlord Body Martial Artist, but it was even enough to fight head-on with the second-stage Internal Breath Martial Artists who Chu Nan had encountered in the competition.\u201cHow is this compared to a third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist?\u201dThe situation of his battle with Enrico yesterday afternoon flashed through Chu Nan\u2019s mind. After roughly comparing it, he felt that if he used Enrico as the standard for a third-stage Internal Breath Martial Artist, he would have the strength to fight with his current strength.However, Enrico had clearly held back yesterday afternoon. Moreover, he had also said that he was considered a very ordinary third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist and was not considered outstanding.If Maruk really had the strength of a third-stage Internal Breath expert, he might be slightly stronger than Enrico.In this way, even if Chu Nan had improved, he might not have the ability to face Maruk head-on.waChu Nan took a deep breath and threw another punch.Be it the increase in the strength of his body or the increase in his meridians and Internal Breath, it had changed his precise control of his body.He had to experience these changes as soon as possible and regain precise control of his body. Only then could he use them better.Sitting Horse Rush Fist\u2026 Retreating Horse Stab Fist\u2026 Shooting Horse Cup Fist\u2026Punches after punches were thrown. With his powerful data ability, every punch of Chu Nan\u2019s clearly became smooth and fluid. His movements became more and more harmonious and perfect, and the flow of Internal Breath in his meridians also became smoother and faster.Soon, he found the feeling of his fist technique, body, and Internal Breath perfectly fusing together.This feeling was extremely beautiful. It actually made him punch out again and again, and he was simply unwilling to stop.\u201cHey, Chu Nan, just take a shower. What are you doing inside? Are you done showering? The Deputy Dean sent a message to rush you.\u201d Dong Fang\u2019s voice suddenly sounded outside the bathroom.\u201cI\u2019ll be done soon.\u201dChu Nan replied loudly and slowly retracted his fist and clenched it.Just the increase in his blood vessels and meridians made his strength increase so obviously.If he could really reach the \u201cPerfect Overlord Body\u201d that Rengal spoke of, what realm would he reach?After thinking for a moment, Chu Nan gently exhaled and put away his distracting thoughts before concentrating again. He would think about it in the future. The most important thing now was to win the semi-finals.Now, his strength had clearly increased through the bold adventure last night.If it was said that there was no possibility of him winning against Maruk before, then now, he already had this possibility!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - BattlePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe local time in West Cloud City was 9 AM. The other semi-finals for those below the age of 20 on West Cloud Planet would begin first.In the first semi-final, the young martial artist from the Phezzan Autonomous Region, Noir, fought a bitter battle and barely defeated the young martial artist from the Vig Republic, Savannah, and successfully entered the finals.Regarding this competition, other than the audience from the Phezzan Autonomous Region and the Vig Republic, only a few media outlets made simple reports without attracting much attention.The only thing that concerned the audience of the Earth Federation was that Noir had successfully entered the finals. This meant that he might obtain the championship and obtain the special reward that the Supremacy Norman had promised-an A-rank martial technique! Although Mu Yutong had also made a promise that as long as a martial artist from the Earth Federation obtained the championship of two groups, he would be able to obtain the A-rank martial technique that he had specially rewarded, regardless of the adult group, only Chu Nan alone had entered the semi-finals in the group below the age of 20.As for his opponent\u2026 he was the strongest among the four participating martial artists in the semifinals, Maruk.Could Chu Nan create a miracle and defeat Maruk to enter the finals?\u201cI can\u2019t say that it\u2019s impossible, but\u2026 the possibility is minimal.\u201dRengal sighed and shook his head. Although he did not say anything, anyone could tell that he did not have any hope. \u201cI\u2019ve seriously seen the recording of every match before Maruk. It can be seen that he has always been holding back. His true strength is probably much stronger than what he shows.\u201dRegarding the popular semi-final of the group below the age of 20 today, the Federation\u2019s Information Martial Arts World Channel would naturally broadcast it live. As usual, Rengal was invited to be the competition commentator.The host beside him was slightly shocked, \u201cBut the strength that Maruk displayed in the previous competition has already been rated as the lowest second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist. If he\u2019s still hiding his strength, doesn\u2019t that mean that his true strength has indeed reached the third-stage Internal Breath Realm?\u201d\u201cThe possibility is more than 90%.\u201dnoRengal said this because he was already certain.\u201cAs for Chu Nan\u2026 to be honest, it\u2019s already very unexpected for him to be able to enter the semi-finals. We can all see that he has actually not reached the level of an Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist, and he has not even reached the perfection of the Overlord Body. The reason why he was able to defeat several Internal Breath Realm Martial Artists in a row was only because his martial arts talent was too high and his combat awareness was extremely powerful. It had even completely surpassed the extent that he should be at his age. However, it\u2019s already extremely difficult for these things to help him defeat a second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist. It\u2019s really impossible for him to defeat Maruk who has the strength of a third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist.\u201dThe host was silent for a moment.This was already the second time that Rengal had expressed that it was almost impossible for Chu Nan to defeat Maruk. It proved that this famous martial artist from the federation had already come to a conclusion about the outcome of this competition.However, one could not say that in the program, so the host could only force a smile.\u201cAlthough on the surface, Chu Nan\u2019s strength is indeed inferior to Maruk, he has already created a miracle of winning against the strong in the previous few competitions. Then, let us look forward to whether he can also create a miracle in this competition!\u201dRengal smiled bitterly.A miracle?Miracles were also built on the basis of strength.Although Chu Nan\u2019s true strength far surpassed his surface strength, no matter how strong his true strength was, he could at most barely defeat a second-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist. Moreover, he had more or less made use of the other party\u2019s underestimate of his opponent, so how could he defeat a third-stage Internal Breath Realm Martial Artist who was much stronger?Chu Nan slowly walked up the arena and the gazes of the audience were focused on him.Due to the fact that Chu Nan had just taken a shower and changed his clothes, he felt much more refreshed.Most importantly, there was no anxiety on his face. Instead, he had been maintaining his calm and composure, and he even had a smile on his face.This made the Earth Federation audience below the stage feel much more at ease. Even if Chu Nan\u2019s strength was really as those martial arts experts had said and was far inferior to Maruk, he could lose in the competition but not his spirit.If he looked timid and nervous before the battle began, it would be too embarrassing.The guy opposite him was from the Kingdom of Kexley. No matter what, he could not embarrass the Earth Federation in front of him.\u201cChu Nan, you can do it!\u201dA shout suddenly sounded from below the stage.Immediately, loud cheers sounded.\u201cYou can do it!\u201d\u201cFight well!\u201d\u201cKill the trash from Kexley!\u201dChu Nan turned around and glanced at the audience below the stage as he smiled bitterly in his heart.They could cheer for him and make him fight well. He could appreciate their good intentions, but as for \u2018Kill the trash from Kexley!\u2019\u2026Not to mention that he did not have the confidence to defeat Maruk, even if he did, he could not kill in the competition, right?However, no matter what, Chu Nan was still very thankful for the audience\u2019s actions of cheering for him. After thinking for a moment, he raised his hand and waved it below the stage, immediately causing a crazy cheer.\u201cHeh, kid, this is a competition. Do you think you\u2019re participating in a performance?\u201dMaruk, who was already waiting on the stage, could not help but mock when he saw Chu Nan\u2019s actions.\u201cYou people from the Earth Federation like to have unrealistic fantasies. Do they really think you can defeat me?\u201dBefore Chu Nan could respond, Maruk shook his head.\u201cNo, these guys clearly don\u2019t think so. I specially looked at the Milky Way Network yesterday. Be it the media of your Earth Federation or the ordinary civilians, none of them think you can win. What do you think?\u201dChu Nan glanced at him and felt that it was funny.\u201cI really can\u2019t tell that you\u2019re such a guy who likes to talk nonsense. How do you know if you can\u2019t win or not?\u201dMaruk\u2019s expression changed slightly and he sneered.\u201cKid, I warned you before that it\u2019s best to be eliminated in advance so as to not collide with me. When I think of how you actually came to be my opponent without knowing your place, I\u2019ll give you another chance. If you immediately choose to surrender, you won\u2019t be tortured anymore. Otherwise\u2026\u201dMaruk stuck out his tongue and licked his lips, revealing a cruel smile.\u201cDon\u2019t regret it when you can\u2019t stand the pain later.\u201dChu Nan looked at Maruk in confusion. He still could not understand why this guy had always been so hostile towards him.However, this problem was not important now. He moved his feet away and assumed a posture as he stared at Maruk intently.This guy\u2019s true strength was not obvious. It was best to observe his various statistics first.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - Reverse SuppressionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMaruk waited for a while and chuckled when he saw that Chu Nan did not have the intention to attack.\u201cI originally wanted to make it easy for you, but since you don\u2019t appreciate my kindness, don\u2019t blame me for being ruthless!\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, Maruk tapped his feet and his body suddenly disappeared from the spot. The audience below the stage were shocked. They did not even see Maruk\u2019s actions clearly.Bang!Only after a muffled sound did everyone focus their gazes on Chu Nan.Chu Nan\u2019s body was already in midair and he was flying back when Maruk appeared where he was just now.From this change, the two of them had actually exchanged blows just now.The audience was shocked.Maruk\u2019s strength was indeed clearly superior to other participating martial artists below the age of 20. As soon as the battle began, he had already displayed such shocking speed and strength and actually sent Chu Nan flying. Chu Nan\u2019s body twisted in the air and landed on the ground. However, he staggered a few steps back before barely stabilizing himself and standing again.He looked up at the distant Maruk, and his expression became even more serious.This guy indeed had the strength of a third-stage Internal Breath Realm!Although the attack earlier was clearly a test, regardless of speed or strength, it was comparable to Enrico\u2019s yesterday, causing Chu Nan to not even have the time to dodge. Chu Nan shook his left hand that had turned numb from blocking Maruk\u2019s attack and confirmed again.Indeed, one could not be careless or wishful thinking when dealing with this guy.He had actually been quite careful just now and had already completed his Second Revolution Internal Breath before Maruk attacked.However, when the power of Maruk\u2019s attack was extremely strong, even if Chu Nan immediately injected his Second Revolution Internal Breath into his palm, he was unable to completely block the powerful force on Maruk\u2019s fist, causing him to be sent flying by this punch. Only then could he completely reduce the force.If Maruk directly pursued him, Chu Nan would already be at a huge disadvantage.Fortunately, this guy had clearly underestimated his opponent. After testing him once, he did not continue to pursue and gave Chu Nan time to adjust his breathing.Maruk looked at Chu Nan and similarly revealed a trace of surprise.Although that strike just now was indeed only a test, Maruk\u2019s punch already had a powerful Internal Breath attached to it. It could be said that he had used at least half his strength.He originally thought that Chu Nan was only an Overlord Body Martial Artist and that this punch was enough to defeat him.However, he did not expect Chu Nan to block it.He did not use much strength in this punch, so it was not too surprising that Chu Nan could endure it. What surprised him was that when he attacked earlier, he had already increased his speed by at least 80%. Chu Nan was actually able to react immediately and block this attack.One had to know that he had always been known for his speed among his fellow disciples.In the Sormida Star System of the Kingdom of Kexley that his master was in, he had even obtained the title of \u201cCrimson Tornado\u201d among the young martial artists. \u201cVery good.\u201d Maruk nodded lightly. \u201cI originally thought that you were too weak and that there was no meaning in letting this competition other than torturing you. Now, it seems that you can still bring me some other fun.\u201dWhen he heard this, Chu Nan did not hesitate to circulate his Internal Breath with all his might and instantly completed the Third Revolution Internal Breath.As expected, just as Maruk finished speaking, his figure disappeared on the spot again.In the next moment, he had already broken through the distance of more than ten meters between the two of them. He instantly arrived in front of Chu Nan and threw a punch.Unlike before, Chu Nan was already prepared this time. The moment Maruk attacked, he had already seen the precise data of all the details of his actions and instantly determined the trajectory of his actions.Bang!Chu Nan threw a punch, but it landed on Maruk\u2019s chest first.Maruk took a few steps back continuously. His body swayed, and he felt a wave of annoyance in his chest, causing his breathing to become slightly unstable.He was shocked. He did not take Chu Nan\u2019s counterattack seriously and did not dodge at all. However, he did not expect that there was a terrifying force that far exceeded his expectations hidden in this punch and he was almost injured. \u201cYou\u2026\u201dAs soon as he spat out this word, Chu Nan took the opportunity to take a step forward and threw another punch. Maruk did not dare to be arrogant anymore. His face sank and he raised his left hand to block Chu Nan\u2019s attack. He slapped his right palm and counterattacked. However, Chu Nan flipped his wrist and gently avoided Maruk\u2019s left hand that was blocking him. His fist aimed at the vital part of his lower abdomen.Maruk frowned and immediately determined that if he continued to maintain the current situation, Chu Nan\u2019s punch would definitely hit him first.If it was in the past, he would not have taken Chu Nan\u2019s punch seriously. It was fine even if he took it head-on.However, the terrifying force contained in Chu Nan\u2019s punch earlier forced Maruk to be wary. A thought flashed through his mind and he was forced to take a step back to dodge the punch. At the same time, he retracted his right hand and grabbed Chu Nan\u2019s right fist.Just as Maruk reacted, the force of Chu Nan\u2019s fist changed again. His right fist was slightly retracted, and the tip of his right foot stepped out gently. His body spun half a circle, and his left fist was already spat out from his waist, aimed at the gap in the right waist. This time, he aimed at Maruk\u2019s weak point, forcing him to change his move to defend again.However, as soon as he changed his move, Chu Nan acted as if he had foreseen this and immediately changed his move to attack the vital point revealed on the other side.The two of them exchanged blows. In an instant, they had already exchanged dozens of times, but not once did their fists and feet collide. It looked abnormally strange.However, in the eyes of the audience, it was obvious that Chu Nan was the one taking the initiative. On the other hand, Maruk was forced by Chu Nan to change his moves every time and appeared extremely passive. The Earth Federation audience immediately became excited.Originally, they did not have much hope for Chu Nan to win this competition. They only thought that he could last for a period of time under Maruk\u2019s attacks.However, he did not expect that Chu Nan would counterattack and suppress Maruk, causing him to appear a little miserable.\u201cChu Nan, you can do it!\u201d\u201cAll the best! Fight well! Kill this guy from Kexley!\u201d\u201cKill him! We must enter the finals!\u201dThe cheers of the audience around the arena passed through the live broadcast equipment and entered the ears of Rengal, who was in the live broadcast of the Federation\u2019s Information Martial Arts World Channel. However, it did not make his expression any better. Instead, it became even gloomier.He was not one of those ordinary audiences who only knew a little about martial arts or even knew nothing about it. They were purely here to watch the fun.With his powerful strength and vision as a second-stage Heaven Control Realm Martial Artist, he could see the actual situation on the field with a glance.On the surface, it seemed that Chu Nan was suppressing Maruk, but in reality, what he did was simply futile.\u201cIn less than two minutes, Chu Nan will be defeated.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
