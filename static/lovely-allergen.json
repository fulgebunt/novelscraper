He\u2019d watched as Yue Zhishi had stared at the doorbell, struggling, for over a minute. \u201cYou ran off without a single second thought.\u201dYue Zhishi turned around and glared at him before very straightforwardly whispering, \u201cBut that\u2019s because I like you.\u201dSong Yu was stunned by such an unexpected confession \u2014 and the door abruptly opened by itself.Lin Rong pulled open the door to their home, a hand on her waist. \u201cWhat were you two whispering to each other about! I waited at the monitor screen for so long.\u201dShe had just finished speaking when there was a sudden\u00a0bang, random streamers spraying onto Song Yu and Yue Zhishi.\u201cWelcome home!!!\u201dYue Zhishi dumbly removed the streamers on his face and body and then went to help Song Yu, except his eyes weren\u2019t on Song Yu at all \u2014 the streamers on his hand ended up wiping all over Song Yu\u2019s face.\u201cWhy are there so many people\u2026\u201dA large group of people stood in the entrance hallway, and other than Lin Rong and Song Jin, Jiang Yufan, Qin Yan, Shen Mi, Nan Jia, and even Xu Lin and Qu Zhi had also come.Song Jin was holding a rose coloured party popper in his hand, quite ill matched with his outfit, and explained with a smile on his face, \u201cEveryone\u2019s here to give you guys a surprise.\u201dIt really was a surprise, and Yue Zhishi inwardly rejoiced \u2014 luckily, he didn\u2019t get yelled at.\u201cThat\u2019s right, the two of you are now the big hero and the little hero.\u201d Nan Jia tugged the two silly looking\u00a0red sashes\u00a0she was holding over them, and she even gave Qin Yan a meaningful look.\u201cOh, right right.\u201d Qin Yan immediately followed behind her and grabbed out a tightly curled up\u00a0silk banner\u00a0from his sports bag. Walking up to Song Yu and Yue Zhishi, he then snapped it open, grinning so widely his eyes all but disappeared.The two of them stared at the two rows of yellow characters on the banner, and they couldn\u2019t help but read the words out loud.Yue Zhishi: \u201cIngenious\u00a0moxibustion\u00a0and divine needles can cure all diseases\u2026\u201dSong Yu: \u201c\u2026May your virtue and skill both spread far and wide.\u201d\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Qin Yan rapidly flipped the banner over to look at it.\u201cSenior Qin Yan, what did you do?!\u201d\u201cOh no?\u201dQin Yan clutched his head. \u201cShit, the owner of that banner store must\u2019ve mixed up my order with the old Chinese medicine doctor next door!\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dYue Zhishi couldn\u2019t stand up straight from how hard he was laughing; his entire body was trembling as he leaned against Song Yu\u2019s shoulder.\u201cAll right, all right. Hurry up and come in, you managed to get back just in time for dinner.\u201d Lin Rong gave both Song Yu and Yue Zhishi a hug. \u201cMy two babies have lost weight. You definitely wouldn\u2019t have eaten well every day.\u201d\u201cWe were okay.\u201d Yue Zhishi said, \u201cSong Yu wasn\u2019t even picky about his food.\u201dQin Yan smirked. \u201cProbably because he wouldn\u2019t have been able to eat otherwise.\u201d\u201cPeople who grabbed the wrong banner have no right to say anything,\u201d Song Yu mildly said.For this surprise gathering, Lin Rong and Song Jin specifically brought out the long table they\u2019d never really used at home and cooked up enough food to fill the table. Everyone had rushed over at noon to decorate the house, blowing up balloons of various shapes and letting them float at the ceiling.Yue Zhishi found everything really pretty, continuously feeling touched as soon as he went inside. Jiang Yufan ended up dragging him to a side and extended out a leg to him. \u201cLe Le, look.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t understand, glancing around in all four directions. \u201cLook at what?\u201dJiang Yufan stretched out his leg a bit further. \u201cLook!\u201dXu Lin, holding a plate of fried chicken wings, was walking past and almost tripped over Jiang Yufan\u2019s suddenly extended leg. Fortunately, he had fairly good balance, and Yue Zhishi also grabbed onto him \u2014 he didn\u2019t end up falling, but he did land a firm step onto Jiang Yufan\u2019s new shoes.\u201cAh my limited edition AJs!!!\u201dYue Zhishi and Xu Lin immediately straightened up at Jiang Yufan\u2019s bitter wail.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi finally understood and said to Xu Lin, \u201cThat\u2019s the pair of AJs Jiang Yufan used as a bet about whether you and Shen Mi would end up together or not.\u201dWith the large platter of fried chicken wings in his hand, Xu Lin suddenly exploded, \u201cWho! Who would get together with Shen Mi!\u201dYue Zhishi jumped in fright once again.Right, he forgot \u2014 he couldn\u2019t talk about it in front of either of them.Lin Rong came out with the large cake she\u2019d baked herself and placed it at one end of the table, clapping her hands. \u201cXiao Yu, come cut. Xiao Yu is a bit obsessive about having things neat, so he\u2019s better at cutting.\u201dYue Zhishi agreed with Lin Rong. \u201cGege\u2019s hands are super precise.\u201dAnd so, Song Yu, who\u2019d always been harder to get to do things than Buddha, really did go and cut the cake.Everyone crowded together to share in the delicious food, handing over Song Yu\u2019s slices of cake one by one. Shen Mi stretched out his neck and looked in Song Yu\u2019s direction, a chicken wing in his mouth.\u201cSenior Song Yu\u2019s so sad, he still needs to cut cake even with only one arm.\u201dQin Yan nodded. \u201cYes, we need to care more about our disabled people.\u201dAnd so the two of them received the two smallest slices of cake in the entire room, while Yue Zhishi\u2019s slice was double the size of theirs added together.\u201cI might not be able to finish this though,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, turning his face around to the Song Yu who\u2019d taken a seat next to him.With a noble and dignified face, Song Yu lifted his own fork. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to finish it, but you can\u2019t share it with them.\u201dCats were really good at holding grudges. Yue Zhishi took a bite of his cake and, very cautiously, praised Song Yu inwardly for being so cute.Everyone talked while they ate, and they had Yue Zhishi and Song Yu share a lot of their experiences while at the plateau.\u201cThe people there are both really tough and optimistic, and they\u2019re also really friendly.\u201d Yue Zhishi recalled so many lovely people. \u201cI was a bit sad when we left.\u201dQu Zhi suggested, \u201cWe can go there together for a holiday next time.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Nan Jia agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to visit snow mountains, and I\u2019ve never been to high altitude places. It must be really beautiful.\u201d\u201cWe can rent tents!\u201d Yue Zhishi rather excitedly started to make plans, pointing at the people around the table as he said, \u201cUncle and Aunt can sleep in one, Nan Jia and Qu Zhi in another, Jiang Yufan and senior Qin Yan can bring your girlfriends along, Song Yu and I will be another, and then Shen Mi and Xu Lin\u2026\u201dHe braked before finishing his sentence, but Shen Mi and Xu Lin looked at each other and said at the same time, \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping with him.\u201dQin Yan said reassuringly, \u201cThis sleep is not that kind of sleep.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping with him no matter what kind of sleep,\u201d Shen Mi resolutely said. Xu Lin puffed up his cheeks and opened his mouth in a huff, as though wanting to say something, but he held himself back and ended up looking like a pufferfish.\u201cWe\u2019ll need to talk about this over some time.\u201d Song Jin gave them some food. \u201cThe two of you have worked really hard the last few days, so you\u2019ll need to rest. Xiao Yu needs to take care of his arm. Everything will be inconvenient now that you\u2019ve injured your right arm. Le Le, you too. Next time something like this happens, you can\u2019t just run off to such a dangerous place without saying anything.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded very sincerely. \u201cI know, I definitely won\u2019t be like that next time.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Jiang Yufan didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cAs soon as you heard something happened to senior Song Yu, you acted like a completely different person. I feel like you still wouldn\u2019t be able to control yourself next time.\u201d\u201cI understand how it\u2019ll be like, now that I\u2019ve gone. I won\u2019t be so impulsive next time, I swear. Everyone can watch over me.\u201d In seeming earnest, Yue Zhishi even raised up three fingers as he promised very genuinely.Song Yu wrapped a hand around his fingers and pulled Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand under the table, holding it. He gently said, \u201cEat your food.\u201dQin Yan cheekily imitated Song Yu\u2019s tone of voice, and then he shook his head. \u201cS.Yu\u2019s never talked to me like that before. The thing he says the most to me is\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up,\u201d Song Yu said.Because he was laughing too much, Yue Zhishi accidentally knocked over the half cup of coke he had next to his hand, and it spilled onto Song Yu\u2019s pants. It was already too late by the time he realised, and he grabbed some tissue, helping Song Yu dab off the liquid in a fluster. \u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Song Yu caught his wrist. He then said to Lin Rong and Song Jin, \u201cI\u2019m going to go change my clothes.\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201dHe threw a quick look at Yue Zhishi when he stood up, but he pulled his gaze back very quickly, walking upstairs by himself. Less than one, two minutes later, when the conversation around the table was already about something up, Yue Zhishi found an excuse for himself, saying it wouldn\u2019t be convenient for Song Yu to change clothes alone. He stood up in the midst of everyone\u2019s hoots and whistles and travelled from the dining room to the living room with red ears, before hurrying his way up the stairs.Song Yu\u2019s door was closed, and he wasn\u2019t sure if it was locked or not. Yue Zhishi tentatively turned the handle; he didn\u2019t expect to be able to open the door. He pushed his way in very softly, but inside, he was ridiculing Song Yu for not locking the door when changing clothes.Only to have Song Yu seize hold of him \u2014 he dragged Yue Zhishi into his arms with just one hand, and then he pressed him against the closed door for a kiss.Yue Zhishi\u2019s legs turned slightly weak at this unexpected kiss, as though he\u2019d suddenly lost his strength. Sweet and numbing pleasure climbed up along his skin until it reached the top of his head.\u201cMm\u2026\u201d Every time they kissed, Yue Zhishi\u2019s two hands would always twine around Song Yu\u2019s neck without him realising. He pressed against Song Yu very tightly, but Yue Zhishi recovered some reason when he felt Song Yu\u2019s arm against his chest. He wanted to retreat slightly, but then Song Yu\u2019s left arm was already wrapped firmly around his lower back.His voice turned weak and needy \u2014 in between the gaps of their lips, he called out either Song Yu\u2019s name or called him gege very docilely, saying he really missed him; he was like a young puppy who\u2019d been born just a short while ago, desperately needing to be loved. The hand Song Yu had left on his lower waist clutched him tighter and tighter, but he let go after a short while, he himself pulling back some distance. He only gave Yue Zhishi a few shallow pecks, and then he kissed the tip of Yue Zhishi\u2019s nose.Resting against the door and lightly panting, Yue Zhishi felt like the kiss had ended with him wanting more. When Song Yu turned around towards his closet, Yue Zhishi quickly followed behind him. \u201cGege, you don\u2019t want to kiss anymore?\u201dSong Yu looked at him, staring at him for quite a while, and then he sighed, pulling out a pair of black pants from his closet. Fairly casually, he said, \u201cIf I\u2019m only allowed to kiss you, then forget about it.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t immediately understand; his cheeks flushed a few seconds later, and he said, \u201cThen, then\u2026 For-forget it.\u201d He prepared to leave as soon as he finished speaking, but Song Yu once again caught him.\u201cHelp me take off my coat.\u201dYue Zhishi let out an sound of agreement and very obediently raised a hand to tug down the zipper on Song Yu\u2019s coat, helping him take it off. \u201cDo\u2026 Do you need me to help you with your pants?\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Song Yu unfastened his belt with one hand and hung it on the handle of the closet door. He then undid his buttons, his pants sliding down to the floor. Yue Zhishi felt like all of this looked somewhat familiar, but then he started to turn shy \u2014 like a silly, small robot, he slowly, unhurriedly turned around and gave Song Yu his back.Song Yu found him adorable and deliberately teased, \u201cNow you know how to be shy? Last time you were in such a rush you did everything yourself.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Yue Zhishi tried to say. But when his brain showed him some ill-timed memories, he thought he truly was too eager at certain times, and so he secretly resolved to be a bit more restrained in the future.His phone abruptly vibrated. After Yue Zhishi pulled it out for a look, he hesitated for a long while, not sure if he should accept the call.Song Yu changed into his pants with one hand faster than he\u2019d expected, and he came up against Yue Zhishi\u2019s back, his chin resting on top of Yue Zhishi\u2019s head. He stared at Yue Zhishi\u2019s phone.\u201cWho\u2019s Ryan?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice had already dropped a few notes.Yue Zhishi twisted his face around somewhat awkwardly, explaining to Song Yu, \u201cThere was an Australian guy with his legs injured when I was helping the foreign tourists as a volunteer. He asked for my number.\u201dSong Yu flicked an eyebrow. \u201cSo he\u2019s the one who\u2019s been calling you the last few days?\u201dYue Zhishi dipped his head. \u201cBut I\u2019ve already told him I have a boyfriend.\u201d He sighed, \u201cI didn\u2019t think he would start bothering me even more, now that he knows I\u2019m not straight\u2026\u201d\u201cSo? He thinks you guys have a chance?\u201dYue Zhishi honestly repeated what the guy had said. \u201cHe said I could go to Australia and get married to him\u2026\u201dThe vein on Song Yu\u2019s temple throbbed.\u201cGive me the phone.\u201dWhen Song Yu took away his phone, Yue Zhishi originally thought he would speak to Ryan \u2014 he didn\u2019t expect Song Yu to directly block him before giving the phone back to Yue Zhishi.\u201cHis legs were probably broken from how shameless he is.\u201dSong Yu returned the phone back to him. \u201cAnd this is why I don\u2019t want to take you along with me when I go out for fieldwork.\u201dThere was an extremely cute look on Yue Zhishi\u2019s face as he leaned against Song Yu\u2019s shoulder. He would feel pleased every time he saw Song Yu being jealous. \u201cYou not bringing me along is clearly because you\u2019re afraid about me getting into trouble.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also afraid of my own backyard catching fire.\u201d Song Yu remained unhappy. \u201cIn the future, just block these people. And all those people who want your WeChat, do the same to them. Qin Yan gave out your WeChat earlier so casually, and now he\u2019s given us a whole heap of trouble.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Yue Zhishi grasped the main point. \u201cHow\u2019d you know senior Qin Yan was giving out my WeChat?\u201dSong Yu stopped talking and pulled Yue Zhishi downstairs.Everyone once again started to make fun of the two of them for the time they\u2019d spent changing clothes. Yue Zhishi was still unused to being teased like that, and with his thin skin, his face reddened extremely quickly. But Song Yu \u2014 he was still that immovable, ice mountain face. He didn\u2019t care about what other people said.Yue Zhishi only found an opportunity to get close to Qin Yan when they were cleaning up the dinner table. Qin Yan was holding a plate with yoghurt and fruit, wanting to finish everything on the plate all by himself.\u201cSenior Qin Yan, you told my ge about you giving out my WeChat?\u201d\u201cMm?\u201d Qin Yan couldn\u2019t immediately recall. Yue Zhishi then asked his second question, \u201cAnd, I\u2019ve always been really curious\u2026 How did my ge come out to you?\u201dFive seconds later, Qin Yan realised the answers to those two questions were actually the same.The shock of that day had still yet to pass, whenever he thought about it.\u201cYour brother told me over WeChat.\u201d Qin Yan put down his plate of fruit. \u201cOkay fine, my own shitty mouth started it.\u201dIt had been right before Christmas: Qin Yan had boasted about all of his early presents without Song Yu asking to hear about it. He\u2019d bragged about his love life, and then, with a heart full of pride, he\u2019d told Song Yu of just exactly how popular Yue Zhishi was. He\u2019d thought that the younger brother-con would\u2019ve been extremely happy.[Qin Yan: a girl asked me for your brother\u2019s wechat.][S.Yu: . ][Qin Yan: but i didn\u2019t give it to her! (self-satisfied.jpg)][S.Yu: Doesn\u2019t matter, he won\u2019t add them anyway.][Qin Yan: bro, let me tell you. your brother\u2019s way too popular, you just don\u2019t know how many girls like the little milk puppy types these days.][S.Yu: Shut up, you.][Qin Yan: shit i almost forgot to tell you, a while ago there was a dude who liked your brother, and the dude kept asking me for his contact details. it made me feel so awkward even though i\u2019m super open and would be the first progressive youth of the new modern era in the entire country to vote for gay marriage. but! le le is the younger brother of my best bro and he\u2019s even closer to him than a real younger brother, so that means he\u2019s my younger brother too. so i decisively rejected him.][S.Yu: \u2026.good for you.][Qin Yan: but of course, aren\u2019t i so reliable? why didn\u2019t he open his eyes and see exactly who it was he liked? let me see exactly who would dare touch the white cabbage our s.yu raised so bitterly!]After sending that message off, Qin Yan had run off to the bathroom and showered, his chest filled with pride for himself. Then, he\u2019d smoothed on one of his girlfriend\u2019s masks, laid down comfortably in bed with plans of playing one round of games before sleeping \u2014 and then he suddenly received Song Yu\u2019s late response.[S.Yu: I touched it.][S.Yu: I\u2019m now formally notifying you, my status has changed. I\u2019m now Yue Zhishi\u2019s boyfriend.]\u201cGod.\u201d Once he finished recounting his experience that night, Qin Yan shivered in front of Yue Zhishi, who\u2019d known nothing about it at all. \u201cHe came out, and then I freaking couldn\u2019t sleep all night.\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019d already registered an appointment online three days ago and had booked a famous orthopaedic surgeon \u2014 which was also why there were so many people waiting in line. Holding Song Yu\u2019s left hand, Yue Zhishi pulled him across the waiting area and found an empty spot in the back, on the far left side of the final row.\u201cSit,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, pointing at the seat.Song Yu wasn\u2019t planning on moving, only indifferently saying, \u201cYou sit. I want to stand.\u201dBut he wasn\u2019t allowed to act cool for all that long \u2014 Yue Zhishi promptly pressed him down onto the seat. \u201cYou\u2019re the patient.\u201dYue Zhishi stood by his side, his eyes turned towards the number displayed on the screen not too far away. He squinted and then, like a small adult, said to Song Yu, \u201cThere are two people in front of us.\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Song Yu caught Yue Zhishi\u2019s fingers, lowering his head to stare at the ring on Yue Zhishi\u2019s ring finger. He then casually tugged Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand in his direction lightly, doing it a good few times before Yue Zhishi understood Song Yu was hoping for him to come in a bit closer.\u201cI\u2019m already really close,\u201d Yue Zhishi said softly. His body was touching Song Yu\u2019s shoulders.Raising his head, Song Yu didn\u2019t speak. He let go of Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand and patted his own knees, and he even arched his eyebrows \u2014 he was signalling Yue Zhishi to sit down.They were surrounded by people here. Yue Zhishi shook his head lightly, his ears flushing, and whispered\u00a0I can\u2019t.And yet Song Yu replied with a completely serious face, \u201cYou can. My legs are really comfortable.\u201dYue Zhishi covered up Song Yu\u2019s mouth in a panic as soon as he said that, awkwardly pretending he hadn\u2019t heard a single thing.The number on the display screen changed at this moment. The door to the consultation room opened, and a girl dressed in the thick winter uniform of a nearby high school jumped out in small leaps, supported by a boy. She\u2019d most likely sprained her leg: her upraised ankle was a bit swollen, and she wore a cotton slipper over it.The boy was carrying two schoolbags on his back, and he was also holding an x-ray.\u201cThe school term hasn\u2019t ended yet?\u201d Yue Zhishi released Song Yu\u2019s mouth. He stared at the boy and girl as he squeezed Song Yu\u2019s fingers, and he murmured, \u201cThey should be third year high school students. I feel bad for them.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t say anything, only tilting his head to rest against the side of Yue Zhishi\u2019s waist.Yue Zhishi\u2019s waist was very soft, and so were his hands as they came to lie on Song Yu\u2019s face. He lowered his head again, softly calling gege. \u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep well?\u201dHe\u2019d sensed that Song Yu hadn\u2019t slept well last night, possibly because of the pain in his arm and possibly because he hadn\u2019t been able to flip his body around. He had only been allowed to lie on his back. Yue Zhishi had hugged his uninjured arm the entire night, sleeping closely, but he hadn\u2019t slept too deeply either in his worry \u2014 he\u2019d woken up quite early.But in a low voice, Song Yu said\u00a0no.Reaching a hand into his pockets, Yue Zhishi pulled out a pineapple flavoured milk candy and held it by Song Yu\u2019s mouth once he\u2019d unpeeled the creamy yellow wrapping paper. Using a tone of voice typically used to coax children, he encouragingly said, \u201cThis one\u2019s really yummy.\u201dWhen Song Yu frowned with a bit of disdain, Yue Zhishi said in an injured voice, \u201cI specifically brought this for you since you\u2019re seeing a doctor.\u201dSong Yu ended up eating the candy, and then he asked him, \u201cWhy\u2019d you bring candy?\u201d\u201cBecause you used to do that for me.\u201dYue Zhishi had really hated going to the hospital as a child, scared and nervous every time he was brought in. He\u2019d needed shots almost every time he\u2019d come, and so sometimes he\u2019d start crying as soon as he sat in front of a doctor.Song Yu had also been quite young at that time, and he\u2019d always fish out a few pieces of candy and stuff them into Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand. He\u2019d then deliberately say, \u201cI don\u2019t even know where they came from. I hate eating candy, I\u2019ll give them to you. Don\u2019t cry after you\u2019ve had candy.\u201dAnd from then on, the tiny Yue Zhishi had started to slowly accept going to see the doctors. It also later turned into a habit \u2014 he would pitifully plead for Song Yu to give him a piece of candy before entering the hospital.It had been strange, even then. Yue Zhishi wouldn\u2019t eat the candy Lin Rong brought; he\u2019d only take candy from Song Yu. Song Yu forgot to bring candy one time, and as his parents took Yue Zhishi to the waiting area, he\u2019d silently gone to the small supermarket outside the hospital to buy some. That place hadn\u2019t sold yummy milk candies, so Song Yu had had no choice but to buy a packet of fruit-flavoured hard candy, Yue Zhishi still eating them very happily.\u201cThat was because you really liked to cry when you were sick as a child.\u201d Song Yu pretended to look annoyed. \u201cI had no other choice.\u201dYue Zhishi wasn\u2019t upset from Song Yu pretending to be annoyed \u2014 delight would fill his heart whenever he thought about their childhood. He reached out a hand and touched Song Yu\u2019s hair, his movements the same as stroking a cat when happy.In the row ahead of them, two people waiting to see the doctor got up and left. That high school couple sat down in their seats, diagonally to the right in front of Yue Zhishi and Song Yu. The girl\u2019s voice was very sweet, and she curved her head onto her boyfriend\u2019s shoulder; she seemed to be cutely whining.Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes would occasionally flick over to them, but he didn\u2019t think doing that was good and so returned to look back at Song Yu\u2019s face. He then quietly said, \u201cWould they be considered as early dating?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Song Yu faintly leaned his head back, meeting his eyes.\u201cI think so\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand was on Song Yu\u2019s neck, and it fiddled with the white sling as Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes once again looked in the couple\u2019s direction.Suddenly, he heard Song Yu speak; he pulled his gaze back.\u201cYou lost me my chance to experience early dating,\u201d Song Yu unabashedly said. His face was calm and composed, and when he saw Yue Zhishi widen his eyes, he continued to say, \u201cOr else I could\u2019ve experienced it as early as I wanted.\u201dYue Zhishi felt his face warming up from Song Yu\u2019s words, and he weakly retorted, \u201c\u2026It wouldn\u2019t have been that early.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Song Yu didn\u2019t agree with him, raising an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted to be your own sister in law while still in kindergarten.\u201dThe moment his dark past came out, Yue Zhishi once again subconsciously went to cover Song Yu\u2019s mouth. Song Yu, now no longer allowed to speak, lightly kissed Yue Zhishi\u2019s palm twice \u2014 and when Yue Zhishi pulled his hand back in a fluster, Song Yu nabbed his hand and touched his lips to Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrist. He then refused to let Yue Zhishi leave.It was only two simple kisses, yet Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart was already beating unsteadily. He tried to distract himself by observing other people, and he looked towards that high school couple, seeing the girl raising her head. She used a very cute voice to say to her boyfriend, \u201cLaogong, I want to eat ice cream later.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s eyes rounded in surprise. As though having guessed he would be extremely astonished, Song Yu intentionally looked up at him. With a faint smile on his face, he teased, \u201cWhat\u2019s that look on your face?\u201dThere were no mirrors here, so Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t actually know what his face looked like. He touched his face with a hand, and then he crouched down next to Song Yu\u2019s knees, whispering, \u201cShe just called him\u00a0laogong\u2026\u201dHe thought Song Yu hadn\u2019t heard.Song Yu had utterly no reaction to it. \u201cMn.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s still so young,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, his pair of eyes large and wide and pure.You haven\u2019t reached twenty yet either.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be married to call someone\u00a0laogong.\u201d Song Yu said to him, \u201cIt\u2019s just an endearment.\u201d He originally wanted to say \u2018just like how you call me gege\u2019, but on second thought, Yue Zhishi actually thought of him as his older brother when he called him gege.Yue Zhishi said\u00a0I see\u00a0in a very soft voice, his chin on top of Song Yu\u2019s knees, and looked back at the boy. As expected, the boy looked extremely shy; his neck and ears were all flushed, but he also looked really happy.The number on the screen changed again, and the nurse in front of the consultation room called out, \u201cIs number 29 here?\u201dYue Zhishi immediately stood up. \u201cHere.\u201dHe was grateful to hear Song Yu\u2019s injury wasn\u2019t as severe as he\u2019d imagined. Just like the time Song Yu had injured his wrist in his third year of high school, Yue Zhishi had searched all over the internet for information about fractured bones. He\u2019d gotten more scared the more he\u2019d read, to the point he almost couldn\u2019t sleep, and now, he stood next to Song Yu and acted like his legal guardian, continuously asking the doctor piles of questions. He didn\u2019t give Song Yu an opportunity to interrupt. Once he heard the surgeon say Song Yu would be fine as long as he took care of himself for three months, Yue Zhishi finally relaxed \u2014 he expressed his thanks again and again.He tugged Song Yu over to pick up his medication, and he had Song Yu stand far, far away when lining up, worried someone might knock into him in the mass of people. Yue Zhishi lined up by himself, and the two of them looked at each other with a wide gap in between; he used some fairly strange looking body movements to talk to Song Yu and looked particularly silly.\u201cWe\u2019ll need to come back for another check up in two weeks.\u201d Yue Zhishi held Song Yu\u2019s hand as they exited the hospital. The weather after Lunar New Year was still very cold. Having ordered a taxi, he sneezed three times in a row as they waited by the side of the road, and he ended up being pulled into Song Yu\u2019s arms and covered by his coat.When they finally got into the taxi, Yue Zhishi intently studied Song Yu\u2019s x-ray. \u201cHuman bones are so narrow,\u201d he said, before gently touching the fracture shown on the film with a bit of distress. He then touched Song Yu\u2019s hand, now in a cast. As though he was casting a spell, he whispered under his breath, \u201cHurry up and get better.\u201dFinding him adorable, Song Yu lowered his head and kissed the top of Yue Zhishi\u2019s head.Yue Zhishi thought his cast really suited having something drawn on it, since it was so white and pale. Abruptly, he heard Song Yu say, \u201cProfessor He said I don\u2019t have to head out for fieldwork for half a year.\u201d\u201cHalf a year?\u201d Yue Zhishi lightly said, \u201cSo long.\u201d\u201cMn, I\u2019ll take this time to write a few more research papers. He even said next month they\u2019ll be switching to a better shockproof surveyor control vehicle with an area specifically to hold instruments. There\u2019ll be a lower likelihood of injuries.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Yue Zhishi tilted his head onto Song Yu\u2019s shoulder. He could sense the driver glancing at him through the rearview mirror, but he didn\u2019t pay him much notice.\u201cWhen we\u2019re officially participating in emergency mapping work, we\u2019ll be surrounded by very high safety measures.\u201d Song Yu explained, \u201cThis time honestly was an accident we weren\u2019t prepared for. Professor He\u2019s previous work was all done\u00a0after\u00a0the disaster, and the work was essentially just controlling drones inside the control vehicle. Danger levels were relatively low.\u201dHearing Song Yu say so much to him, Yue Zhishi felt a pang of pain in his heart for no reason at all. It\u2019d already been so many days, and yet Song Yu was still explaining things to him, trying to tell him \u2014 whether intentionally or not \u2014 that his work wasn\u2019t actually that dangerous.\u201cI know. I know it came about really suddenly, and you guys had to enter the battlefield without any preparations. It\u2019s good no one got hurt.\u201d Yue Zhishi nestled securely against him. \u201cSong Yu, I\u2019m already no longer that scared.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cMn. Humans always need to grow up.\u201d Yue Zhishi smiled and said, \u201cAnd besides, I know you\u2019ll take care of yourself for me.\u201dSong Yu also gave him a very faint smile, promising\u00a0I would, and then said to Yue Zhishi, \u201cWhen you\u2019re in front of me, don\u2019t grow up.\u201dThat was a very unrealistic desire, but Song Yu truly did want it. In front of himself, he hoped Yue Zhishi could forever be frank and straightforward, immature; he hoped Yue Zhishi would look for him whenever he wanted something, wanting Yue Zhishi to hold the deepest reliance towards him. It didn\u2019t matter that they took care of each other \u2014 he still wanted Yue Zhishi\u2019s care for him to forever be as clumsy and adorable as a young child pretending to be an adult.Adults had nowhere to release their feelings of helplessness and distress. Song Yu simply wanted to be the shelter for Yue Zhishi\u2019s childlike feelings \u2014 so when in his arms, Yue Zhishi could cry when he wanted to cry and could laugh when he wanted to laugh.After returning home, they noticed a post it note from Lin Rong stuck onto the entrance hallway\u2019s shoe cabinet.[We\u2019re going to a birthday party for one of my girlies, we won\u2019t be back.]Song Yu couldn\u2019t hold back from scoffing, \u201cStill calling them girlies at her age.\u201dYue Zhishi silently thought, Aunt Rong remained like a young girl for so long because Uncle Song always indulged her. And even though he too wanted Song Yu to always spoil him, he couldn\u2019t right now: Song Yu was wounded.\u201cGege, I\u2019ll cook.\u201dSeeing how animated Yue Zhishi was, Song Yu walked towards him after throwing his coat onto the sofa, questioning, \u201cAre you sure?\u201dHe had a bad premonition \u2014 after all, despite his deft hands, Yue Zhishi really didn\u2019t have much talent when it came to cooking. He\u2019d also never needed to cook, since he had both Lin Rong and Song Yu; he had essentially zero experience.\u201cYeah.\u201d Yue Zhishi was determined, pulling an apron over himself. He saw a pot of pork ribs and lotus root soup in the kitchen, still hot from Lin Rong making it, so he turned to face Song Yu and asked, \u201cHow about I make you some eggs?\u201dSong Yu wanted to urge him not to, but Yue Zhishi had already cracked open an egg. With his back towards him, he quietly made a noise of surprise, and then he reached in with chopsticks to pick something out from the bowl with the egg.Eighty percent chance some shell pieces fell inside, Song Yu inwardly thought.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not a big problem,\u201d Yue Zhishi muttered to himself as he used his chopsticks to briskly beat the eggs. Song Yu wanted to come in and help, but Yue Zhishi decisively rejected him, saying, \u201cGo sit down and have some soup first.\u201dThe kitchen was an open plan kitchen, so even if Song Yu didn\u2019t go in, he could still pretty much see what Yue Zhishi was doing.It felt like what had originally not been a big problem suddenly turned into a big problem.In the end, after turning off the stove, Yue Zhishi stood in front of the counter for a while with his back towards Song Yu. Struggling with himself, he turned his head around, looked at Song Yu and said, \u201cMaybe let\u2019s not have eggs today\u2026\u201d\u201cBring them over,\u201d Song Yu said.Yue Zhishi let out an \u2018oh\u2019, very reluctantly bringing over to the table the eggs he\u2019d both burned and scrambled into pieces. He knew better than anyone else that Song Yu was especially picky when it came to food; he sometimes even nitpicked at Aunt Rong\u2019s food, refusing to even touch his chopsticks if a certain dish had the ginger he disliked.\u201cDon\u2019t eat it.\u201d Yue Zhishi sheepishly scooped up a few more pork ribs from the pot of soup and gave them to him. \u201cEat the ribs Aunt Rong made, what you eat will help heal that part of you.\u201dBut Song Yu mutely picked up a piece of the scrambled eggs, tasting it.The calmer he was, the more anxious Yue Zhishi felt. \u201cGe\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s passable.\u201d Song Yu took another bite. \u201cIt tastes better than it looks.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t really believe him, taking up his own pair of chopsticks to try the eggs. He then lowered his head and focused on drinking his soup; he didn\u2019t touch those eggs anymore. He was probably unlucky \u2014 the eggs he ate just so happened to have some of the eggshell he hadn\u2019t managed to get out completely.Song Yu ended up finishing the entire plate of scrambled eggs, and he even found an excuse for himself, saying he just so happened to feel like eggs today.Yue Zhishi felt like his \u2018just so happened\u2019 came about particularly suspiciously, so he despondently cleaned up the bowls and chopsticks. He turned on the water at the sink and said, \u201cI won\u2019t cook anymore.\u201dLeaning against him, Song Yu smoothed aside Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair and kissed the side of his face. In a grave yet tender voice, he said, \u201cBut I finished it all.\u201dThe way he said it sounded like he was looking for praise, and it rather stirred Yue Zhishi\u2019s small, prideful heart. He turned and stared at Song Yu\u2019s face. \u201cSo you mean it really was hard to eat.\u201d\u201cIt was good,\u201d Song Yu said without hesitating. And he said it without shifting his face at all, as though whatever he said was true. His gaze swept over Yue Zhishi\u2019s very soft-looking mouth. \u201cYou really won\u2019t cook anymore?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Yue Zhishi nodded.\u201cCook,\u201d Song Yu said very softly, coaxing him. \u201cCook only for me.\u201dHe hesitated for two seconds, but Yue Zhishi still wasn\u2019t able to refuse Song Yu. He could only drop his eyes and say, appearing very docile, \u201cAll right.\u201dAs though thinking he\u2019d agreed too hastily, Yue Zhishi turned around, lifted a bowl and said in a serious voice, \u201cOnce I\u2019ve learned to cook well, I\u2019ll cook for you often.\u201dSong Yu clearly only had one moveable hand, but he still took the bowl Yue Zhishi had covered in suds and rinsed it clean under the faucet.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to learn all that well.\u201d He spoke completely casually, using a relaxed voice as though he was the world\u2019s least picky eater. \u201cYou\u2019re already really good the way you are now.\u201d\u201cYou truly ask very little from me.\u201d Yue Zhishi smiled as he soaped up the final plate. The sunlight from outside the kitchen window shone through the layer of clouds and lit up his eyelashes, turning them pale and translucent.\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Song Yu helped him rinse off the plate, placing it on the counter. \u201cBecause you\u2019re already very good.\u201dYue Zhishi gave his cheek a kiss, shaded with a bit of gratitude. Whenever he was with Song Yu, he never felt he wasn\u2019t good enough \u2014 the moment a dark little tongue of flame was kindled, Song Yu would conclusively extinguish it.\u201cI\u2019ll wipe things down. Sit down on the sofa, the doctor said you need to rest.\u201dBut no matter what Yue Zhishi said, Song Yu didn\u2019t leave. He stood where he was, simply asking him if he wanted a dishcloth or a paper towel before randomly grabbing one. Underneath the sunlight, the ring on his hand reflected a lustrous metallic shimmer.For one single instant, Yue Zhishi felt like they were a newly wedded couple \u2014 but in the next second, he dismissed that strange idea.They had nothing to do during their university break, so they sat on the sofa and watched a movie, Yue Zhishi covering Song Yu with a thick blanket. The afternoon sun of winter made them warm and drowsy, and as he lay against Song Yu\u2019s shoulder, Yue Zhishi felt both dazed and exhausted. He didn\u2019t know why he felt like that, but he sensed it very keenly when Song Yu\u2019s breathing started to change. Raising his head, he saw Song Yu frowning, his lips faintly pressed together and the corners of his mouth utterly straight.He sat up and very lightly touched Song Yu\u2019s arm. \u201cIs it hurting?\u201dSong Yu shook his head, telling him to recline back onto him. But Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t quite willing, and he lifted a hand to touch Song Yu\u2019s face. \u201cWhat should we do? Do you want some pain meds?\u201dHe was a completely proactive person, his body immediately moving as soon as his brain had that thought. Song Yu reached out and grabbed him. \u201cNo need, come back.\u201d His hand was holding onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s waist, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s clothes rustled with his movements, letting in some cold air. Yue Zhishi faintly shivered.\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s good to eat pain meds too often,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, starting to persuade himself. He shifted slightly closer to Song Yu and smelled the pleasant scent on his body; soon after, he felt the heat of Song Yu\u2019s body as it transmitted to him through the air \u2014 as well as the warmth of Song Yu\u2019s palm as it pressed into, and started stroking, Yue Zhishi\u2019s skin.Song Yu looked at him without realising, his eyebrows still lightly knit together. His eyes dropped from Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes to his lips, and he said, \u201cI should be able to feel better if we do something to divert my attention.\u201dYue Zhishi pressed his lips against Song Yu\u2019s mouth the moment after Song Yu said those words. His restraint over himself was forever unable to resist the forthrightness and innocence etched into his bones, but because he knew Song Yu was injured, he moved very gently, his hand curving around Song Yu\u2019s face as though it was holding a precious piece of porcelain. It didn\u2019t matter that Song Yu had only one hand \u2014 he was still able to scatter Yue Zhishi\u2019s breathing.He was as soft and supple as a pool of water in the summer. Under the winter sun, in Song Yu\u2019s arms, he sparkled with glittering shards.One kiss overlapped with another, and the sounds of their breathing tangled together and drew them into a deeper, sweeter dream.Dampness, softness, the coiling together like two fishes, the hot pants of air mixing together.It was rare for Yue Zhishi to be in charge, and like a young child, he found it novel. Sensation flared along sensitive nerve endings, and they floated against skin, pain slowly dissipating against the joy and excitement of touch.Lovers were the best intoxicants.Even though he knew Lin Rong and Song Jin wouldn\u2019t be back at this time, Yue Zhishi still felt a bit anxious. His remaining reason presented his brain with a scene of them being caught, and it made him all the more sensitive \u2014 he was trembling even though he was sitting on top of Song Yu.Worried he was cold, Song Yu dragged a corner of the blanket over Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulders.\u201cI\u2019m not cold.\u201d Yue Zhishi was sweating, and it made him even more pliant. He pressed both of his palms onto the sofa, and when they sunk down into the softness, he touched his lips to the centre of Song Yu\u2019s eyebrows and kissed his eyes. Little by little, the speed of their breaths turned into one; Song Yu\u2019s hand gripped onto his waist quite fiercely, and he couldn\u2019t move away even if he tried.The movie arrived at its end without them realising. Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair was damp from sweat, and he pushed it behind his ears. He felt a bit weak, but he also didn\u2019t want to press against Song Yu\u2019s arm. He propped himself up on the edge of the sofa, wanting to get up, only for Song Yu to stop him from moving.\u201cHug for a while.\u201d In a slightly raspy voice, Song Yu called him\u00a0baobao.\u201cMn.\u201d Yue Zhishi docilely cuddled into his arms, except he didn\u2019t dare to press in too firmly and left a bit of space between himself and the arm slung up against Song Yu\u2019s chest. After resting for a while, he lifted his head again and pecked the corner of Song Yu\u2019s mouth. He caught a glimpse of Song Yu\u2019s faintly reddened neck \u2014 maybe it was from earlier, when he had to use his strength.Suddenly, for no reason at all, Yue Zhishi thought of that overjoyed high school boy in the hospital.He didn\u2019t want Song Yu to be in pain; he wanted Song Yu to be happy.Yue Zhishi wrapped his arms around Song Yu\u2019s neck, and he also pressed his forehead against Song Yu\u2019s, his eyes damp and still a touch red. He seemed to be imitating, but it also didn\u2019t seem like he was cutely whining \u2014 whatever came out of his mouth was genuine and lovely.\u201cLaogong,\u201d he gently, delicately said, his voice still carrying the soft, needy tinge from his earlier pants of air.Song Yu obviously wasn\u2019t expecting that.Within his slightly widened eyes, Yue Zhishi saw the surprise Song Yu scarcely ever felt.It was as though that encouraged him, and Yue Zhishi affectionately kissed his lips before shifting to Song Yu\u2019s ears. He whispered again, \u201cLaogong.\u201dThe blanket on his shoulders slipped down, revealing the beautiful lines of his back.Song Yu cleared his throat and then pulled the blanket back over him. He turned his face away, voice stiff. \u201cCopycat.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Yue Zhishi prepared to get up, cocooned in the blanket. Pouting, he said, \u201cThen forget it, since I can\u2019t do it well anyway.\u201dHe said it was cold and stood up from Song Yu\u2019s legs, picking up the plush sweater he\u2019d thrown onto the floor and pulled it over his head. He looked at Song Yu again once he emerged \u2014 and realised his neck and ears were both flushed.He looked no different from that seventeen, eighteen year old boy in the hospital.So Song Yu could also feel embarrassed. He looked so innocent, and it was a tremendous contrast compared to certain other times.\u201cThe movie\u2019s finished.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s sweater managed to cover the top of his thighs, and he pointed the remote in the direction of the television, casually moving the cursor around. \u201cDo you want to watch another one? What about a comedy? I heard this sci-fi movie\u2019s pretty good.\u201dThe television kept jumping from one movie poster to the next, Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes focused on searching for a good movie to watch. He suddenly heard Song Yu release a very light sigh \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t have heard it if he hadn\u2019t been paying attention.Yue Zhishi rapidly turned his head around, and saw Song Yu once again frowning, his left hand on top of his injured right arm. He looked like he was in a lot of pain.\u201cIs it still hurting?\u201d Clutching the remote, Yue Zhishi climbed onto the sofa next to him. Song Yu let out a grudging \u2018mn\u2019, and so Yue Zhishi also laid a hand on his arm. He then said to Song Yu, face serious and respectable, \u201cI might not be able to do things to distract you with anymore, my waist\u2019s sore.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want you to do that\u2026\u201d Song Yu gave Yue Zhishi a look reserved for strange creatures in movies, displaying his obvious dissatisfaction at Yue Zhishi\u2019s misinterpretation.With his head lowered, Yue Zhishi played with Song Yu\u2019s left hand. \u201cThen what should we do? Take some meds then, gege.\u201d He spoke with a bit of petulance, and he even pulled off the ring on Song Yu\u2019s hand, pushing it over his own index finger. Lifting it into the air, he looked at it under the sunlight.The look on Song Yu\u2019s face, as well as his voice, once again turned unnatural.\u201cSay it again\u2026\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dSong Yu glanced away. \u201c\u2026Say it again, just like earlier.\u201dHe begged others so haughtily. Worthy of being a cat.Yue Zhishi ridiculed him silently, and then kissed him with an air of being willing to answer his every request. Briskly, both syllables coming out crisp and clear, he said, \u201cLaogong.\u201dAnd other than that, he even bestowed him with liberal amounts of\u00a0I love you\u00a0for free.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH Extra 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayExtra 3: The Hidden Love of His YouthIf there was one word to describe Song Yu\u2019s teenage years, then it would most likely be: single-minded.He\u2019d single-mindedly studied, had single-mindedly forged ahead step by step according to his career plan.Single-mindedly loved someone in secret.For most of the time, Song Yu had been able to control himself very well when it came to that last matter. But he would occasionally lose control, and during those moments, he\u2019d think in despair: how nice would it be if Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t live under the same roof with him.If he could reduce the number of times he came into contact with Yue Zhishi, if he could reduce the amount of information about him in his life, then \u2014 he should be able to control his hidden love as well as he wanted.But that was a conclusion Song Yu himself later overturned.Because it hadn\u2019t mattered that they had been on separate sides of a sports ground, that he hadn\u2019t been able to hear his voice and hadn\u2019t been able to see his smiling face. As soon as he saw a figure earnestly learning how to shoot a ball, his heart had stirred.When it came to things that appeared to be within his control, his feelings for Yue Zhishi had been the most unstable. But Song Yu had thought it was still okay \u2014 he could still endure. It was just that those feelings had come about so inexplicably; he couldn\u2019t find where, and when, they\u2019d started.No matter how he searched through his memories, it felt like he couldn\u2019t grasp a definite moment in time in which he\u2019d started liking Yue Zhishi. Or perhaps it was because he was always so perplexed and was always looking through his memories that Song Yu remembered all of Yue Zhishi\u2019s tiny bits and pieces so extraordinarily clearly.Just by closing his eyes, he would be able to remember the first time he met Yue Zhishi. He could see how very beautiful, how very adorable he\u2019d been. Yue Zhishi with his pair of little pudgy hands, so small; he still hadn\u2019t known how to call out gege, then.But Song Yu hadn\u2019t passed that period of time well at all \u2014 the guilt and shame of causing Yue Zhishi to fall into an allergic reaction, as well as the psychological stress caused by Uncle Yue\u2019s accidental passing, had tormented a small child who\u2019d only just hit his sixth year of life.The only way he\u2019d found relief was to quietly, sneakily, treat Yue Zhishi well.For example, helping an unwitting Yue Zhishi in elementary school by scolding his classmates who\u2019d once made fun of him for not having parents. Or always leaving inside his own pockets the milk candy Song Yu himself detested before prodding Yue Zhishi to brush his teeth at night.And for another example, biking to a place very far away to buy a volume of manga that had been hard to find, before he threw the book to Yue Zhishi and lied to him by saying he\u2019d purchased it near school.Yue Zhishi had been very happy, but he\u2019d also truly believed that Song Yu had bought it on a whim.He was very easy to trick, and he also never needed to be coaxed.Which was why Song Yu had never slipped up a single bit and had never given himself the opportunity to break the protective shell cased around his hidden love.He always treated Yue Zhishi well in secret, and then he\u2019d cover himself with an utterly uncaring appearance. His acting, in the beginning, had truly been very clumsy, but he had been able to get away with it, more or less.The rain in this city always came particularly frequently, and during summer, it was as though the city floated within rainwater. People would rush about on the roads, and it didn\u2019t matter how careful they were: water would still splatter over them and wet their pants. Even adults were treated like that \u2014 let alone young children.As a child, Song Yu hadn\u2019t felt much towards continuous rain and overcast skies. He\u2019d been a child who would walk very cautiously on the roads, and he would pull on a pair of rain boots before leaving the house, coming home clean and dry. But Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t been the same \u2014 he turned even clumsier during rainy days, and even if the roads hadn\u2019t been flooded, he would still accidentally stumble over a warped tile and be splashed all over.It would be even worse when it flooded. One time, while still in first year of elementary school, Yue Zhishi had been tricked outside by the boys in his class. They\u2019d said they would go with him to the small canteen and would buy something delicious for him to eat. Yue Zhishi had ended up with pants soaked all the way up to his knees, and he also didn\u2019t get anything to eat either. He had been very upset, but he hadn\u2019t dared to tell Song Yu.Until school had ended, and they saw each other on the first floor of the classroom building. Song Yu had seen Yue Zhishi\u2019s pants and his aggrieved face, and only then had he realised that Yue Zhishi had sat through the afternoon classes like that.\u201cDon\u2019t leave your classroom when it rains.\u201d He had been a bit angry, and so he\u2019d set a very unreasonable demand on Yue Zhishi.But once he heard Yue Zhishi meekly say\u00a0okay, Song Yu couldn\u2019t help but change his words.\u201cDon\u2019t leave the classroom building.\u201d He had then stiffly said, \u201cIf you want to eat something, come upstairs and look for me. I\u2019ll go buy it for you.\u201dAt that time, Yue Zhishi had only sniffled and reached out, stubbornly wanting to hold Song Yu\u2019s hand.Song Yu had pulled back his hand, refusing to give it to him. \u201cDo you understand? Don\u2019t run off with other people.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Yue Zhishi had very obediently nodded at Song Yu, his eyes and nose red.But perhaps a large shadow had been left on Yue Zhishi\u2019s mind from being tricked. Even though Song Yu had said he\u2019d take him to the small supermarket, when it rained again, Yue Zhishi still wouldn\u2019t come out of his classroom unless it was thundering. During those times, he would really miss Song Yu and sometimes, he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold back his tears.As soon as school finished for him for the day, Yue Zhishi would still run upstairs to Song Yu\u2019s classroom and wait outside. He\u2019d cling onto the back door and silently blink his large pair of eyes, docilely waiting for Song Yu.Generally speaking, Song Yu would usually realise Yue Zhishi was there through the whispers of the students around him. No one dared to talk to Song Yu during class, so everyone would lean their heads together and gossip. When Song Yu heard things like \u2018that cute younger brother\u2019 or \u2018adorable mixed race\u2019, he would be able to guess that Yue Zhishi was waiting for him at the back once again.After his class ended, Song Yu first packed up his own bag. And then, pretending he didn\u2019t know anything, he would turn around.Yue Zhishi would leap once into the air very happily the moment their eyes met, and then he\u2019d run into the classroom and wrap his arms around Song Yu\u2019s waist. With a very silly smile, he\u2019d lift up his face and call him Xiao Yu gege.\u201cDid you get your pants wet today?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Whenever Yue Zhishi shook his head, his soft and curly hair looked so very fluffy, and it made him twice as cute. \u201cI didn\u2019t take a single step outside my classroom today.\u201dSong Yu thought he was being dumb and wanted to say he could\u2019ve come upstairs to look for him, but he didn\u2019t end up saying that out loud.Their driver had taken a sick day off that day, so Song Yu had needed to take a taxi home with Yue Zhishi. He knew very well that Yue Zhishi would get his pants wet no matter what, so he directly pulled Yue Zhishi onto his back, telling him to hold the umbrella.He docilely rested on Song Yu\u2019s back, his arms holding onto Song Yu very tightly. He was in an uncommonly good mood, and he sang a strange-sounding, but not unpleasant to listen to, nursery rhyme.\u201cXiao Yu gege, Zhang Chengyu said sorry to me today.\u201dZhang Chengyu was the classmate who\u2019d lied to Yue Zhishi by saying he\u2019d buy him some snacks.\u201cMn.\u201dSong Yu thought of how he\u2019d disciplined him, and thought that kind of child didn\u2019t really seem like someone who\u2019d truly feel apologetic. He\u2019d only been forced to apologise through the pressure of an older student.Yue Zhishi started to sing again after saying that one thing. His head was hanging too low, his face almost buried into Song Yu\u2019s neck. The air coming out of him as he hummed was damp and humid, similar to the air of a rainy day.\u201cDon\u2019t forgive him.\u201dIt was as though he was instilling a sense of intolerance into a child, but Song Yu truly did think so.Yue Zhishi was too kind \u2014 even if he was bullied, he would still think it was because he was different from others. He would think that was why he was excluded, and wouldn\u2019t think it was other people\u2019s fault.\u201cBut I already said it\u2019s fine.\u201d Yue Zhishi was holding onto his neck, and he felt Song Yu stop moving, shifting him a bit higher up his back. \u201cI won\u2019t forgive him next time.\u201d\u201cYou want something like that to happen again?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Yue Zhishi sniffed. \u201cIt feels gross when my pants get wet.\u201dSong Yu could feel just how uncomfortable it would be just by imagining it. He walked to the side of the road with Yue Zhishi on his back and asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell your teacher?\u201d\u201cI forgot.\u201d Yue Zhishi was curled around the side of his neck, sticky and clingy like a piece of soft candy unable to be removed after being moistened by water. \u201cXiao Yu gege, I only wanted to look for you.\u201dA car stopped in front of the two children, and the taxi driver rolled down his window, looking at them with a bit of hesitation. \u201cHeading off?\u201dSong Yu nodded \u2014 and so he passed over Yue Zhishi\u2019s reply.The child he\u2019d been at fourth year had still yet to learn how to calmly express his inner thoughts to Yue Zhishi.And later, he realised: after growing up, he was still the same.The confusion of puberty, the rebellion, the struggle \u2014 Song Yu had soundlessly given them all to him, hidden within the shadows.Even though he didn\u2019t remember exactly when he started to like Yue Zhishi, Song Yu remembered the moment his feelings took a sexual turn.It had also been in the summer, during third year of junior high as he\u2019d approached his high school entrance examinations. It had been a thundering, rainy night in which Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t been able to sleep well. By that time, Yue Zhishi no longer fought to climb into Song Yu\u2019s bed like he\u2019d used to as a three year old child; he\u2019d obediently returned back to his own room once he\u2019d been rejected, and he\u2019d left Song Yu alone to regret what he\u2019d done.The reason behind his rejection was actually very simple. People in class had joked about Song Yu and another girl, comparing them to a young couple in the class next door, and they\u2019d brought up inappropriate things such as \u2018first kiss\u2019 and \u2018first love\u2019. Song Yu had found it annoying and tedious, and he\u2019d been in a gloomy mood \u2014 which was why he\u2019d said to Yue Zhishi words such as \u2018I\u2019m really tired, you better go back to your own room to sleep\u2019.Lying in bed, Song Yu closed his eyes and told himself to hurry up and sleep. But the heavy rain was loud and noisy, and it made his already uneasy heart even more restless. He didn\u2019t know how much time passed, but he fell into a fitful sleep, so many strange scenes appearing in his dreams. He was hugging someone and, just like what those people in class had said, was sweetly enjoying his first love, first kiss.Outside of his dreams, a sudden crack of thunder flashed by, and it illuminated the face of the person in his dreams.Song Yu jumped awake from his dreams, his entire body covered in sweat. He was stunned for thirty seconds, and then realised there was something not quite right with himself. At 4am, after changing his pants and his bedsheets, he sat on the bathroom floor and stared blankly at the rumbling washing machine for a very long time. It was hard to swallow; he was shaken.When he came out of his room in the morning, everything was just the same as usual: Song Yu went to knock on Yue Zhishi\u2019s door at Lin Rong\u2019s behest, urging him to get out of bed.Standing at the door, staring at the cipher lock for an entire minute \u2014 he heard the sound of slippers dragging across the floor from inside, and then the next moment, Yue Zhishi sluggishly pulled open his door. He was wearing a set of soft and fluffy white pyjamas, and he raised a hand to rub his eyes, subconsciously going to hug Song Yu.\u201cXiao Yu gege, I still want to sleep.\u201d Yue Zhishi pushed his face into Song Yu\u2019s chest, his arms around his waist. His voice was particularly sticky and needy whenever he wasn\u2019t fully awake.Song Yu held onto his shoulders and shifted him off, very uneasily.He went downstairs by himself, and he said to Lin Rong, \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to wake him up anymore.\u201dAt fifteen years old, Song Yu had flipped open the exam paper of puberty. He\u2019d smoothly worked his way through to the end, yet he encountered the most difficult question in history just as he was about to finish.The first part of the question asked:\u00a0What should you do if you fall in love with a boy?The second part of it asked:\u00a0Then, what should you do if you\u2019ve fallen in love with Yue Zhishi, who is no different from being your true younger brother?For once, he felt like abandoning the test. He didn\u2019t want it anymore, along with the almost full marks he\u2019d managed to get in the previous questions.Because he didn\u2019t know what he should do, Song Yu decided to keep things the same as they\u2019ve always been \u2014 since Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know anything about it anyway. Song Yu even innocently fantasied: maybe one day, he wouldn\u2019t like him anymore.Weren\u2019t people all like that?But when it came to having a change of heart, it seemed to be much harder than he\u2019d thought. Song Yu was a particular, critical person, his social circles narrow and limited. He never seemed to be able to see someone worth his affections ever since he\u2019d been a child, and other than his studies, there seemed to be only a Yue Zhishi in his life.When he finished his high school entrance examinations, Song Jin said he wanted to give him a present and told Song Yu anything was fine. Song Yu very rarely wanted anything, because he felt like he already had everything. When his father asked him what he wanted, the first thing that popped into Song Yu\u2019s mind was that Yue Zhishi liked watching anime. And so he asked his father for a projector.He obviously was given one later, and he even spent an entire morning personally installing it into his room. The projector was right on top of his bed \u2014 because he felt Yue Zhishi was really lazy and would prefer to lie in bed while watching television.He then spent another precious afternoon downloading the anime shows Yue Zhishi liked watching. In his dark room with his curtains drawn, he tested the video display for a very long time, and when he was finally satisfied, he prepared to find an excuse to get Yue Zhishi to come over and watch.Song Yu didn\u2019t think about what words he should use to invite Yue Zhishi over. In his mind, he only practiced again and again how he would reasonably explain why he had those anime shows.But Lin Rong had never wanted only one of her children to receive presents, so on almost the exact same day, she installed a new HD television on a wall in Yue Zhishi\u2019s room. Yue Zhishi was overjoyed, boasting about it multiple times at the dining table, saying it was extremely clear and had really good colour.So Song Yu didn\u2019t say anything.He couldn\u2019t sleep that night, so he played those downloaded shows on mute throughout the entire night; he only really watched twenty or so episodes.As he lay in bed, as he watched, he thought: why is this so long? Exactly how is this interesting to watch?What was so good about it for him to like it so much.For the first time in his life, he felt: nights were so hard to endure.But Song Yu didn\u2019t feel any resentment towards Yue Zhishi for wasting his entire day. Faintly, vaguely, he felt like he would still spend a lot of time on that silly little boy in the future.He then indifferently thought \u2014 luckily, he was someone highly efficient. What he had most was time.The next night, under Qin Yan and their class monitor\u2019s coercion and persuasion, Song Yu carried his adverse reactions from his lack of sleep to the graduation dinner with his junior high classmates. Everyone kept talking about a bunch of irrelevant things as they ate, and the conversation kept changing around; it made it particularly easy for his mind to stray. Song Yu couldn\u2019t remember either, just exactly how they went from talking about barbecue skewers to joking about certain stories.\u201cYou don\u2019t know about the phrase \u2018German orthopaedics\u2019? You\u2019re too behind the times.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it about a brother and sister?\u201d\u201cWhat? A brother and sister dating each other?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s so strange\u2026 A bit abnormal.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t say a thing the entire time, looking not much different from his usual demeanour. On the way back home, Qin Yan circled around him, chattering.\u201cThat Yao Mu guy really annoyed me today, he kept asking me why your little brother doesn\u2019t follow your family surname and why he doesn\u2019t look like you guys.\u201d Even though Qin Yan wasn\u2019t that close to Yue Zhishi, he still looked very vexed. \u201cI later told him that Le Le\u2019s parents passed away in an accident, and he could be considered as being entrusted to your family. And then that idiot ended up telling everyone.\u201dAs though worried Song Yu would be unhappy, Qin Yan then rapidly said, \u201cBut I\u2019ve already yelled at him. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll talk about Le Le to other people again.\u201dSong Yu coldly said\u00a0mn, the speed of his bike somewhat increasing. He was silent the entire way home.The wind of a spring night lightly puffed up his white t-shirt, but his chest felt empty, his heart dangling.Yue Zhishi was just like his one and only allergen, and yet he appeared in every little nook and corner of his life. He was so soft, so adorable \u2014 and he left Song Yu with nowhere to escape, no way to reject him.That night, Song Yu deleted all of the anime shows he\u2019d downloaded for Yue Zhishi, thinking of the quips and jokes his classmates had said around the dinner table. He didn\u2019t know why, but he didn\u2019t find those jokes funny; instead, they made him feel as though he was being brutally cut open.On one hand, he thought the same as so many other normal people: he felt brothers and sisters being together was very abnormal, and that the older brother must\u2019ve been a despicable person.On the other hand, he wanted to know: what happened to them after.After being discovered, after the brother had had his leg broken and then healed \u2014 what happened then?He couldn\u2019t think of what came after, and online opinions couldn\u2019t be believed. But Song Yu silently decided: he didn\u2019t want Yue Zhishi to call him gege anymore.Just like Qin Yan, he also didn\u2019t know how he should face other people\u2019s questioning. He didn\u2019t know what he should say so that everyone wouldn\u2019t learn about Yue Zhishi\u2019s loss of both his parents; he didn\u2019t know what kind of explanation wouldn\u2019t be considered as hurting Yue Zhishi for a second time.And moreover, he wasn\u2019t Yue Zhishi\u2019s true older brother to begin with.He believed very simply that as long as he and Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t act like true brothers in other people\u2019s eyes, then he would be able to be absolved \u2014 while he would also be given the space to continue on, single-mindedly.The projector that Song Yu had initially bought for Yue Zhishi ended up being used to watch many, many geological documentaries. Whenever he watched them, he would think of the past Yue Yi; he became even more wary.Yue Zhishi tired of his new television very quickly, and he started to enter Song Yu\u2019s room without permission again, clinging onto him to play video games together. He wouldn\u2019t leave even after Song Yu rejected him, and he\u2019d stay in Song Yu\u2019s room and watch those documentaries he wasn\u2019t interested in.Every time that happened, Song Yu\u2019s single-mindedness would fail.His eyes would be focused on the documentary, but his heart would be thinking \u2014 when would Yue Zhishi find this boring and return back to his own room.But as long as he wasn\u2019t driven away, and as long as Lin Rong didn\u2019t urge him to sleep, Yue Zhishi wouldn\u2019t leave.Out of all of the possible pitfalls for Song Yu, he was the purest, yet most persistent one, stubbornly staying by Song Yu\u2019s side and watching as he jumped down.As though he refused to give up until he got what he wanted.They moved to another school district for secondary school, Yue Zhishi also entering Peiya\u2019s junior high department. Both of them were surrounded by new classmates. Following his previous decision, Song Y carried out his plan to cut himself off.When it came to Song Yu, Yue Zhishi would forever obey and listen, giving him whatever he wanted. And so he followed along, acting like a stranger who didn\u2019t know him at school; no part of their school lives intersected, and neither did they interact.Song Yu was the first one to find it strange.When they\u2019d still been in the same elementary school, Yue Zhishi would wait outside his classroom for him to finish class. Now that they were in the same secondary school, Yue Zhishi still waited for him; he simply expanded the range and distance between them to the space of strangers, sitting and waiting for him in the corridor connecting their two classroom buildings.In reality, Song Yu knew everything.From the first day Yue Zhishi had lingered in that corridor, not daring to head to the high school department\u2019s classroom building \u2014 Song Yu had known.But he believed this was\u00a0right. There was truly no way he could be anything with his own younger brother.Other than how strange it\u2019d felt in the beginning and the occasional surges of possessiveness, Song Yu sometimes felt a subtle sense of pleasure at their secret agreement to act like strangers in the midst of everyone else.They saw each other a good few times in the cafeteria, and whenever Yue Zhishi noticed him, he would do silly things without realising, sometimes even doing them with both his hands and his feet at the same time. Sometimes he\u2019d even bump into someone.Yue Zhishi, who never looked where he was going, even directly crashed right into Song Yu\u2019s chest one time.His head half lowered, he hadn\u2019t dared to look at Song Yu. His long and soft eyelashes had been trembling, and he\u2019d stammered out an apology before calling him a very foreign \u2018senior\u2019.As soon as Song Yu thought about how this guy would think up all kinds of different ways to sneak into his room at night, and then cutely beg him for help with his math problems \u2014 for a certain moment, Song Yu found this contrast of pretending to be strangers extremely interesting.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He reached out a hand to support Yue Zhishi.\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, junior brother.\u201dUnrequited love at close range was no doubt difficult, but he had to admit \u2014 love brought about delight and a stirring of his heart.Peiya\u2019s flag raising team was made of both junior high and high school students, and there were four flag bearers. Two of them, one from each department, would be in charge of hoisting the flag.Song Yu had been chosen to be a flag raiser since first year of high school, and he\u2019d refused to be one ever since. But in second year, he couldn\u2019t refuse any longer; he was forcefully pulled into the team. He focused on doing his homework during meetings until a certain meeting during the second half of the school year, where the team leader brought up a name.\u201c\u2026Luo Xing, who was meant to partner up with junior high\u2019s Yue Zhishi, has twisted his ankle. Our high school team needs to switch up our roster. There\u2019s a ceremony next week, and someone needs to take Luo Xing\u2019s place. Who wants to do their shift ahead of time?\u201dSong Yu, who\u2019d never been enthusiastic about helping others, proposed changing his shift right at this moment.\u201cI don\u2019t want to hoist the flag near the semester exams. It\u2019ll be good to do it now.\u201d He gave them a slightly clumsy reason, but this impulsive decision actually matched very well with the impression he gave others. He was also volunteering himself, so his team leader gratefully changed the roster for him.Because he wanted to startle Yue Zhishi, Song Yu didn\u2019t tell him about this. Even when Yue Zhishi kept talking about how he needed to hoist the flag next week at home during late night snacks, Song Yu didn\u2019t open his mouth and say a single word.Yue Zhishi allowed him to be a true high school boy in the midst of puberty, able to carry out an exceedingly dull prank on the person he liked \u2014 while imagining with utter delight how he would look when startled.When Monday finally came, the two of them left the house before the sky lightened, and they respectively changed into their military uniforms after arriving at school. It was a foggy morning of early summer, and the sunlight weakly shone onto the wet sports ground. Holding down his cap, Song Yu followed behind the other high school boy with trained footsteps until they were behind the two junior high flag raisers.That little silly boy didn\u2019t notice him until he was standing on the flag raising platform on behalf of the high school department and came face to face with him. There was an adorably earnest look covering his face.Under his cap, his pair of beautiful eyes were extremely wide. Like a dragonfly skimming across the water surface, the dense top and bottom layers of his eyelashes lightly met each other before separating once again.He\u2019d thought he\u2019d been prepared to see him; he\u2019d thought the one who would be thrown into chaos would be solely Yue Zhishi.But it wasn\u2019t like that in reality \u2014 Song Yu\u2019s heart was thrown into a complete mess.Underneath the music and the chirping of summer cicadas, he faintly cleared his throat, signalling Yue Zhishi to wake up from his daze. He could see Yue Zhishi visibly tensing up; he seemed to have forgotten most of the movements he\u2019d practiced so many times on the balcony at home. But he still did his best to follow along with Song Yu, hoisting the red flag together up to the very top as the music came to an end.Their school flag came immediately after, Peiya\u2019s school song starting to play. The main flag raisers for the school flag were the junior high school students \u2014 so, Yue Zhishi. He somewhat stiffly raised the purple school flag, printed with their school\u2019s emblem, and pulled at the halyard bit by bit along with the school song. He carefully controlled his speed.Song Yu stood next to him silently, and he suddenly heard something. Soon after, he heard a clatter. He\u2019d only just thought something didn\u2019t feel right when the massive school flag abruptly fell down, covering Yue Zhishi and him completely.The several thousand students under the flag raising platform dumbly watched as the accident happened \u2014 some people had already made some rather loud noises of surprise.Being cocooned by the flag, Song Yu was also very stunned, but he was still able to think. Yue Zhishi caught his arm in the next second and opened his mouth very softly.\u201cGege, what should we do?\u201dThey were able to hide from everyone\u2019s eyes, having been drowned by the flag, and it was as though they\u2019d temporarily recovered their intimate relationship. Which was why Song Yu also swiftly grabbed onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand.\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, don\u2019t be scared.\u201dHe threw off the school flag and saluted in apology to the school leaders and students underneath the platform. He then, with Yue Zhishi, bowed deeply. They calmly came back up and bowed again towards the direction of the clock tower where the broadcasting station was.As stationmaster, Qin Yan reacted very quickly. He replayed the school song as soon as Yue Zhishi was prepared, and he gave them a chance to remedy the situation as soon as possible after the accident.Yue Zhishi and Song Yu were taken by the teacher in charge of the flag team for a chat, but they weren\u2019t punished. The accident wasn\u2019t actually completely caused by Yue Zhishi\u2019s nervousness; the halyard for the school flag on the flag pole had already aged to the point of tearing.\u201cGood thing you guys handled it well.\u201d The teacher glanced at Song Yu. \u201cHigh school seniors truly are different, so calm.\u201dSmiling, she encouraged Yue Zhishi and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll need to thank your senior well later.\u201dYue Zhishi was a bit dejected as they came out of the office. The summer sunlight landed on him piece by piece, and it made the military uniform on his body look even better.In the corridor filled with people, they remained at the distance of strangers.\u201cYou didn\u2019t even tell me.\u201d Yue Zhishi spoke vaguely, as well as in a very quiet voice, as though worried their act of strangers would be seen through by classmates passing by. \u201cYou scared me.\u201d\u201cSo you think it was my fault?\u201d Song Yu acted also like a senior whose relationship with him stopped at the level of being in the same flag raising team.Yue Zhishi shook his head. \u201cIt was my fault.\u201d He seemed to still want to say something, but he paused \u2014 a girl carrying a thick stack of exercise booklets walked into the broad gap between them.\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d Song Yu mildly said, \u201cThe teacher just said it was the halyard\u2019s problem.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d Yue Zhishi waited until there was no one else around and then opened his mouth, speaking quietly yet candidly. \u201cI was too nervous.\u201dWalking with him to the stairs, Yue Zhishi lowered his head and said, as if to himself, \u201cMy heart gets distracted as soon as I see you, what should I do\u2026\u201d A student came up the staircase, and so he added a form of address to deceive both himself and others.\u201c\u2026Senior.\u201dThe warm wind of summer blew the soft and gentle tone in Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice to Song Yu\u2019s ears.\u201cGetting distracted isn\u2019t anything terrible,\u201d he said, consoling him in a seemingly indifferent manner.It was better than having his heart moved.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A short-term rainstorm, particularly heavy, is predicted to occur, and it\u2019ll be accompanied by thunder, strong winds and other local storm effects. Citizens, please look after your safety as you go out today\u2026\u201dThe old television in the breakfast shop was broadcasting that day\u2019s weather report. The dusty blades of the fan were humming as they spun, the noise meshing into the sounds of the cicadas in the bushes. Yue Zhishi finished his last bite of his vegetarian soup noodles; his forehead was sweating from the heat. As soon as he raised his head, the restaurant owner sighed, gazing outside the store with his arms by his side. \u201cWhat terrible weather. It\u2019s about to scorch people, and yet a heavy rainstorm\u2019s coming. The weather report\u2019s talking nonsense.\u201dYue Zhishi also stood up, and he walked outside, pulling on his schoolbag, and climbed onto his bike. Large, expansive fields of green in both light and dark shades filled his vision, and the wind of midsummer swept over his face and body with humid, hot air, feeling as though it was covering his skin with a layer of film. It was still early morning, and yet the heat harboured within the rays of light was already beginning to show itself \u2014 sunlight reflected off the glass walls of tall buildings, and other than the dappled shadows of trees, it turned everything broiling hot and ghastly pale.It truly didn\u2019t feel like rainstorm weather.Everyone had already long turned on the aircon in the classroom, so Yue Zhishi rushed into the cool room, sweating from his bike ride over. He subconsciously rubbed his arms and sat down, flipping open his books.His desk mate borrowed his English homework, and he even praised the artwork Yue Zhishi had created for the creative arts festival.\u201cThank you.\u201d With his head lowered, Yue Zhishi read through his notes, wanting to memorise his texts, but the only thing he could think of was the invitation he\u2019d extended out to Song Yu last night as they\u2019d eaten their late night snack. It was an invitation Song Yu was very unlikely to care about.It probably couldn\u2019t even be considered as an invitation. Drinking his mung bean soup, he\u2019d only casually mentioned that the creative arts festival was going to display a new group of student artwork today, and that his painting was in that new group to be exhibited. But at that time, only Aunt Rong and Uncle Song had displayed an enthusiastic interest in his painting; Song Yu had peacefully sat there and drank his soup, not saying a single word.Afterwards, Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t been able to hold back, and he\u2019d asked, \u201cGege, do you have physical education class tomorrow?\u201dSong Yu had nodded and then had asked him why.Yue Zhishi had said,\u00a0no reason. A few seconds later, he found a reason to talk and said he wanted to look at one of Song Yu\u2019s textbooks.\u201cSomeone\u2019s borrowed it,\u201d Song Yu had replied.He hadn\u2019t actually wanted to look at it to begin with, so Yue Zhishi had nodded his head very calmly. \u201cOkay.\u201dHe\u2019d only wanted to confirm if Song Yu was going to the physical education class or not.Because going to the sports ground from the high school department\u2019s classroom building required them to pass through the creative arts festival\u2019s exhibition site: the small fountain square.\u201cI think it\u2019s meant to rain today.\u201d His desk mate had finished copying his homework at an incredible speed, and he gratefully returned Yue Zhishi\u2019s exercise book back to him. \u201cDid you bring an umbrella today, Le Le?\u201dYue Zhishi came back to attention and nodded. \u201cI always have one in my desk drawer.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good then, but I feel like you won\u2019t need to use it. The sun\u2019s too strong today.\u201dAfter turning on the aircon, the classroom was like a large blast freezer, isolating him from the outside world\u2019s temperature. His mind turned sluggish, and his body also lost its sensitivity, unable to sense the changes outside. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t like the heat, so he didn\u2019t take a single step out of his classroom.Song Yu, who hated high temperatures even more than Yue Zhishi did, had no choice but to leave his cold air during the third class period and head towards his physical education class very mournfully and very apathetically. The sunlight might\u2019ve been slightly less compared to that morning, but it was still ridiculously muggy; the air felt like a wet towel on his face.If someone wrung out the air in this city, water would most likely pour out of it.\u201cI\u2019ll grab a good basketball court later.\u201d Qin Yan took hold of his shoulders. \u201cHey, want to buy a sprite first?\u201dFinding him too warm, Song Yu pushed Qin Yan away. \u201cToo hot. Don\u2019t want to play.\u201d\u201cNo way! Shit, if you don\u2019t play, how am I meant to win? You\u2019re a high school boy, how could you not play basketball?!\u201dHe once again started to tenaciously plead at Song Yu, his words not stopping as they travelled from the classroom building to the main road in the school, and then to the fountain square that\u2019d had its fountain turned off.Qin Yan\u2019s eyes were caught by the artwork in front of him. \u201cDidn\u2019t they change out the works on display today? Hey, this\u00a0paper cutting\u00a0work\u2019s not bad\u2026 Are there none from us second year high school students?\u201d He looked over the art quickly, his gaze skipping over them with cursory glances. As soon as he turned around, he saw Song Yu stopped in front of a certain easel \u2014 Qin Yan found it a bit strange how absorbed he was in it. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Song Yu turned away, following behind Qin Yan and leaving.It was a bright summer day, and yet their physical education teacher still forced them to run around the sports ground twice. After he finished his run, Song Yu went to the automatic vending machine at the edge of the sports ground and bought a bottle of iced water; he felt somewhat better after taking a few mouthfuls. Qin Yan pulled a few guys over for a three versus three match, and because the weather was too hot, Song Yu played particularly ferociously, wanting to end the match as soon as possible. The three guys playing against him even thought he had an excess of energy.\u201cHoly shit, another one!\u201d Qin Yan was like a cheerleader lazing about on the court, giving Song Yu loud applause.As the ball landed on the ground, Song Yu plucked at his shirt collar, humid air flowing into his shirt. Thick and heavy clouds rapidly took over the entire sky, and it was as though the sky darkened in an instant.He stretched out his hands, dirtied from basketball, and unfurled them with his palms facing upwards as if he was waiting for something.\u201cSong Yu, continue!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too hot.\u201d Song Yu turned to leave. \u201cI\u2019m going to go rinse my face.\u201dQin Yan found him baffling. \u201cYou like being clean too much, can\u2019t you go later.\u201dBut he\u2019d never been able to hold Song Yu back, only able to watch as he went to do what he wanted to do. The strange thing was, Song Yu didn\u2019t go directly to the bathroom behind the soccer field; instead, he left the sports ground surrounded by wire mesh and walked away.Dark spots appeared on the light grey cement ground, one after another. After leaving the sports ground, Song Yu\u2019s footsteps quickened slightly, and then he later started running. The sounds of someone reciting English in the classroom building crossed over the wildly green and lush trees, and Song Yu, in his white shirt, dashed underneath their shadows before finally stopping in front of a particular easel in the exhibition area.Vaguely panting, he stared at the slip of paper attached to the easel. It said, [Yue Zhishi, junior high class 2-8].It started to rain, and drops of water passed through clouds and the gaps in the trees to land on Song Yu\u2019s shoulders.He\u2019d originally wanted to grab the painting and go, but he suddenly saw the palms of his hands: they were very dirty, stained with the basketball\u2019s dirt. So he didn\u2019t touch the painting \u2014 he held onto the wooden frame and lifted it up, the artwork on it facing inwards. He left that deserted small square before the rain started to fall heavier.The rain soaked through Song Yu\u2019s back, and the translucent white shirt wrapped around the gently jutting out shoulder blades of youth. Entering the first floor staircase of the junior high classroom building, he slightly wiped off the water on his forehead with the back of a hand, and then he lowered his head, checking to see if the painting had gotten wet.Good thing he\u2019d managed to get there in time \u2014 only the first initial drops of rain had fallen onto the art. Yue Zhishi had painted a city flourishing in the rain, but the city, teeming with lives, reflected the faint surface of a lake like a photo with double exposure.The title of the painting was:\u00a0No Place to Return.Song Yu held onto the easel and went upstairs using a staircase far away from Yue Zhishi\u2019s classroom. In the staircase, the rays of light turned dark and gloomy, and the images of his memories seemed to refract within the indistinct water vapour in the air.He seemed to see Yue Zhishi crouching underneath a roof as a six year old child, and he was pointing at the water on the ground. The water was overflowing, about to completely cover an entire step, and he asked Song Yu, \u201cXiao Ye gege, why does it flood as soon as it rains? The water\u2019s almost about to swallow the little tower I made from rocks yesterday.\u201dAt that time, Song Yu had tried explaining to him, \u201cBecause we originally had a lot of lakes here. The lakes can hold a lot of water, but in order to build more houses, the lakes have been turned into ground. They can\u2019t hold water anymore.\u201dThe young Yue Zhishi had remained crouched on the floor, and he\u2019d let out a long, long \u2018ohhh\u2019.\u201cSo the rain doesn\u2019t have a home to go back to anymore.\u201dBack then, Song Yu had only thought of Yue Zhishi as being completely clueless, as someone who hadn\u2019t understood a thing he\u2019d said. He\u2019d explained something in such a scientific way, and yet Yue Zhishi had understood it in so strangely.But now, at this very moment, as he recalled his childhood memories, Song Yu couldn\u2019t help but curve up the corners of his mouth.These whimsical ideas of Yue Zhishi\u2019s brain had mostly come from the countless days and nights he\u2019d spent with Song Yu.When their class reached the halfway point, Yue Zhishi suddenly heard his desk mate say it was raining outside. It was as though Yue Zhishi had just awoken from a dream, remembering his artwork was still outside \u2014 he quickly swerved his head around towards Jiang Yufan, who was sitting in another section, and pouted, giving him a sad look. Jiang Yufan gave him a heartbroken look in return; his own work was also in the rain. He then used body language and mouthed at Yue Zhishi:\u00a0we\u2019ll go get them once class ends.The rain started to pour, water beating at the glass windows before trickling down and covering it with transparent lines. Yue Zhishi was feeling slightly down, and it wasn\u2019t entirely because of his painting being possibly drenched.It happened very rarely, but Yue Zhishi reached into his desk drawer and pulled out his phone. The screen lit up, but there weren\u2019t any messages on it.Song Yu hadn\u2019t sent him any thoughts about his painting \u2014 that clearly meant Song Yu hadn\u2019t seen his work at all.But Yue Zhishi very quickly rejected that deduction of his, because even if Song Yu did see it, he still wouldn\u2019t share with him any of his thoughts.\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to finish our discussion of the exam paper, so let\u2019s end it here for today. Revise your incorrect answers once class finishes, and let\u2019s continue during night self-study\u2026\u201dThe teacher was still speaking at the podium, but the moment the bell rang, Jiang Yufan rushed out of the classroom\u2019s front door. Holding onto an umbrella, Yue Zhishi was slightly hesitant; he followed behind a few other people when he saw them leaving too, mingling in with them with his head lowered.The doors for class 2-8 were close to the staircase, and they flew downstairs, the wind of their body movements cutting through the sticky air. When he saw Jiang Yufan prepared to bolt right into the rain, Yue Zhishi shouted out his name, opened his umbrella and ran over to the small square together with him.\u201cMy photos my photos my photos\u2026\u201d Jiang Yufan muttered again and again on their way over. Once they arrived, they realised every easel had been covered by a light blue and see-through waterproof tarp, but he was still worried and pulled Yue Zhishi over to double check. He eventually saw his photos, placed safely under the tarp.\u201cGood thing they moved quickly. But my photos have been laminated anyway, your painting\u2019s in a bit more danger. Let\u2019s go have a look.\u201d He walked around, tugging at Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm.Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes were also searching for his painting, but when they finally arrived at the area where his painting had originally been placed, he realised that section was now missing a frame.\u201cWhere\u2019s my painting?\u201d Yue Zhishi murmured.Jiang Yufan looked to the left and to the right; neither of them was Yue Zhishi\u2019s work, and the space in between them just so happened to be empty. \u201cAre you sure it was here?\u201dYue Zhishi nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s too strange. Let\u2019s keep looking.\u201dThe two of them searched over the entire row, but they still didn\u2019t find Yue Zhishi\u2019s painting. The works were placed very orderly, in two rows facing each other, and so it was obvious there was one missing easel in the area.Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart also seemed to be missing one small section, as though it had been stolen away by someone. He appeared unperturbed, but he inwardly felt lost and confused \u2014 in disappointment, he rushed back to the classroom building before the bell rang for the next class.Jiang Yufan leaped over two steps for every one step he took, arriving at the third floor before Yue Zhishi did, and he was saying, \u201cHow could someone have stolen the painting, the easel\u2019s soooo big. How could it just disappear\u2026\u201dHe abruptly fell silent. Looking at the corridor in front of their classroom, he said to Yue Zhishi behind him, \u201cSo many people.\u201dYue Zhishi also lifted his head to see. There truly was a lot of people. \u201cWhy are they all around our classroom\u2019s back door\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s have a look.\u201d Jiang Yufan looked excited, interested in seeing what the fuss was, and even though Yue Zhishi was in a poor mood, he still followed along.Quite a few of their classmates in the crowd saw Yue Zhishi as he walked over, and they beckoned to him, grinning. \u201cHey, isn\u2019t that Le Le?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so amazing!\u201dYue Zhishi had utterly no idea what was happening, yet the huddle of people spread open as though just for him.The easel of his lost painting was set in front of the classroom back door, and the painting on top of it was completely intact and undamaged. It was raining so heavily outside, yet the painting didn\u2019t look like it\u2019d been touched by a single droplet of water at all.\u201cHow\u2019d it get here?\u201d Jiang Yufan asked the other people. \u201cWho brought it over?\u201d\u201cNo one knows, it was already here when we came out after class ended.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t see who it was even though you were the first one out?\u201dJiang Yufan ruffled his hair. \u201cWe ran directly to the staircase from the front door.\u201dYue Zhishi was still immersed in confusion. The bell for the next class rang, and so he ended up moving that easel \u2014 inexplicably disappearing before inexplicably reappearing once again \u2014 into the classroom and left it next to the aircon.The speed and quantity of the rain increased as the day went on, not stopping once throughout the entire day. The semester exam was approaching, so everyone decided to stay in the classroom for their noon break; Yue Zhishi did the same. He was getting a bit sleepy from working on his questions, and so he napped on his desk for half an hour, the rain even heavier when he woke up. Someone opened the doors, and the classroom, previously sealed off from the rain, suddenly flooded with the restless and anxious sounds of rain.Yue Zhishi was in a daze, slowly blinking at the blackboard.Jiang Yufan ran over to him, propping himself up with his hands on Yue Zhishi\u2019s desk. \u201cLe Le, I think I know who helped you move it. Maybe it was a girl with a crush on you, and since she was concerned about your painting, she secretly helped you bring it here.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes slowly gathered focus. \u201cDoesn\u2019t she need to attend class?\u201d\u201cShe could\u2019ve taken a leave of absence.\u201d Jiang Yufan\u2019s fingers tapped on the desk. \u201cTaking a leave of absence to help you move the easel, how romantic is that.\u201d He then said to himself, \u201cBut not leaving behind a single hint, it really is a secret crush.\u201dLowering his head, Yue Zhishi glanced at the phone in his drawer. It now had a few more messages, but the name he wanted to see still didn\u2019t appear.\u201cI guess so. What you say makes sense.\u201dSomeone who secretly liked him, willing to save his artwork during a day filled with heavy rain \u2014 that was a lot more reasonable than a certain thought that had flashed across Yue Zhishi\u2019s mind.Seconds passed, and the screen of his phone darkened, returning back to silence.The weather report was finally true for once.It was as though there was no end to the rain, the colour of the sky much more shadowy than usual. Water seeped through the window lattices, and the leaves of the broadleaf trees outside the windows were saturated by the rain and looked like they were about to release green-coloured fluid. The ground was flooded, and the ivy leaves on the high school department\u2019s classroom building were swaying underneath the rapid pattering of water.Yue Zhishi was very grateful towards the person who helped him bring in his painting, but he was also worried for other people\u2019s works. During dinner, he saw the students in charge of the creative arts festival moving the easels away, and so he went to help to help.Only he had his artwork with him.The math teacher who\u2019d said he\u2019d come by during the night self-study session to continue going over the exam paper ended up saying he wasn\u2019t coming anymore, and he had the class representative pass out a new paper for the class to do. Everyone was already numb to the endless problems and questions, so when the class monitor sat onto the podium to enforce discipline, everyone in class lowered their heads to work on the paper. Only a few people were talking in whispers.Yue Zhishi was always very focused when working on questions, the end of his pen poking at his chin several times without him realising. Having thought of a way to solve the question in front of him, he was about to start writing when there was a sudden clap of thunder \u2014 his body jerked in reflex.\u201cStorm\u2019s seriously getting worse.\u201d\u201cMan, that lighting really scared me.\u201dJiang Yufan gazed outside the window. \u201c\u2026There won\u2019t be a power outage, right.\u201dThe class monitor knocked on the podium. \u201cQuiet. Stop talking.\u201dHe had just finished speaking \u2014 the originally bright classroom abruptly fell into darkness.\u201cHoly shit, it really is a power outage!\u201d\u201cJiang Yufan, your mouth is so unlucky!\u201d\u201cDoes this mean we can leave school early!\u201dNoises also came from other classrooms. Yue Zhishi\u2019s first reaction was to look in the direction of the high school classroom building; it was also covered in darkness.The class monitor did his best to keep the class in check, telling them to keep quiet. The class next door was obviously much harder to handle: the students had already run into the corridor.\u201cI\u2019m going to the offices to look for our teacher, you guys don\u2019t go outside.\u201dThe boys in the class started to kick up a fuss and chatter, talking about things like \u2018we\u2019re definitely going to be let out early\u2019 and \u2018let\u2019s go eat barbecue skewers in a bit\u2019. A portion of students pulled out small rechargeable table lamps, or used the torches on their phones, to light up their homework and continued working.Yue Zhishi also grabbed out his phone, wanting to finish his question. His hand had just wrapped itself around the pen again when a white light flashed across outside as though tearing open the black night. For a moment, it was as bright as day, but the darkness completely swallowed the brightness very soon after. It was a scary omen, to Yue Zhishi \u2014 he covered his ears with his hands.As expected, a massive roll of thunder sounded in the next second. It didn\u2019t matter how well Yue Zhishi had prepared; he was still startled.\u201cYue Zhishi, you\u2019re still afraid of thunder at your age?\u201d The boy sitting behind him teased, \u201cWhat do you need to cover your ears for?\u201dHearing those words, Yue Zhishi drew down his hands and attempted to distract himself by doing questions.The class monitor had yet to return after heading out, and the classroom became more and more chaotic \u2014 but at least no one had yet to leave the room.\u201cI hear our school has an electric generator, the power outage shouldn\u2019t last for too long.\u201d\u201cReally? But weren\u2019t we just let out of school early last time?\u201dMindless chatter, the sounds of rain, the low voice of the female classmate in front of him as she recited texts \u2014 they all mixed together in the dark and humid classroom, but they were still unable to hold out the cracks of thunder.It wasn\u2019t really a hard question, yet Yue Zhishi was only able to finish it with starts and stops, finally finishing it with an inference. He finally couldn\u2019t continue waiting and enduring anymore; he pulled out his phone, unlocked it and tapped into his chat with Song Yu.He wanted to say to Song Yu that he was really scared, but then he thought of the teasing from the boy behind him and thought, he really did seem ridiculous.As he hesitated, it felt like the chat screen suddenly moved. Thinking he\u2019d just imagined it, Yue Zhishi lowered his head to look at it \u2014 Song Yu had actually sent him a message.[Song Yu gege: The book you wanted yesterday has just been returned. I\u2019ll give it to you tonight when we\u2019re home.]Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t think Song Yu would send him a message about something like that. He grabbed onto it and used it as a hasty excuse to keep talking.But what he didn\u2019t realise even more was that the message was something Song Yu had struggled to think of as soon as that first crack of thunder had sounded, worried Yue Zhishi would be afraid. He\u2019d searched for a very long time before he found a suitable reason to start a conversation with Yue Zhishi.The message looked natural, not too overly concerned, and seemed very much like something a normal older brother would say.White light blazed across the outside sky again, but Yue Zhishi held onto his phone, feeling like Song Yu had snatched away much of his attention. It was why he didn\u2019t feel so panicked anymore, but he was still scared whenever thunder crashed.He typed out a row of words, sending it out.[Yue Zhishi: Gege, I\u2019m a bit scared.]The class monitor came back, opening the classroom door. He said, \u201cTeacher\u2019s not at his office, and he\u2019s not at the kitchenette for teachers either.\u201dThe students in the classroom immediately exploded with cheers, but the class monitor still refused to let them leave, sticking to his role as monitor. \u201cThey would\u2019ve let us know if we were to be let out early. Just wait first.\u201dYue Zhishi received Song Yu\u2019s reply in the midst of cheers and quiet complaints.[Song Yu gege: There are so many people in your classroom, why are you scared?]He thought about it and felt Song Yu\u2019s words had a point \u2014 and so for a moment, Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know what to say.He didn\u2019t notice the \u2018currently typing\u2019 displayed at the top of the chat screen, and after a few minutes, he couldn\u2019t help but send Song Yu another message.[Yue Zhishi: But I\u2019m still a tiny bit afraid.]He waited for a very long time, thunder crashing twice and the class monitor repeating for the third time that they weren\u2019t to make a racket, but Yue Zhishi still didn\u2019t receive Song Yu\u2019s response.He thought: in Song Yu\u2019s eyes, he must look utterly childish, timid and like he hadn\u2019t grown up at all.Some girls gathered together to go to the bathroom, and they asked for leave from the class monitor. Looking towards the high school classroom building, Yue Zhishi saw little flashes of light in Song Yu\u2019s classroom, and he felt like he\u2019d been caught by some kind of spell.He also asked for leave from the class monitor, and because of his image of being an obedient student, he was granted permission very easily. Except he didn\u2019t go to the bathroom \u2014 he walked directly into the staircase and arrived at that open air corridor connecting the two classroom buildings.The outside world was somewhat brighter than inside the classroom, and wind, mingled with rain and the smell of humidity, soared towards him, faintly wetting his hair and shirt. A layer of water covered the marble floor of the corridor and made it very slippery. Yue Zhishi cautiously made his way across, head looking down, and saw his white canvas shoes landing on the ground\u2019s black tiles \u2014 every step created small waves, rippling with light.He was actually walking without a place in mind, his feet moving without much conscious thought. It was as though he\u2019d arrived here in this corridor after yielding to inertia.This was the place he quietly stayed in every day as he waited for Song Yu to finish his classes. But he had \u2018waited\u2019 only by himself \u2014 Song Yu wouldn\u2019t actually go to him. As soon as he saw people coming out of high school\u2019s class 2-5\u2019s room, Yue Zhishi would pack up his vocabulary textbook and leave, biking home first.Song Yu was the one who wasn\u2019t aware of this; Song Yu was the one with actions being done\u00a0to\u00a0him.He was about to reach the end of the corridor \u2014 Yue Zhishi felt like it was time for him to stop walking. In an instant, lightning swept across the night sky and illuminated everything around him. Yue Zhishi lifted his face, and it was like a coincidence that seemed to occur only in movies.Someone was standing tall and upright at the end of the corridor near the staircase entrance. The lightning revealed his face.Thinking he\u2019d seen incorrectly, Yue Zhishi froze where he was, but lightning flashed across; the person standing there hadn\u2019t disappeared, and it truly was Song Yu.In the darkness, he seemed to be looking over at Yue Zhishi with a pair of bright eyes. Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t sure if he was imagining things, but it felt like Song Yu gave him a look with his eyes before turning around. He didn\u2019t walk over to Yue Zhishi and the corridor; instead, he headed towards the bathroom near the entry to the stairs.Perhaps he\u2019d been enchanted by that imagined look, or perhaps he knew it was about to thunder again very soon \u2014 Yue Zhishi strode over and followed.He left behind waves of water on those reflective floor tiles.The moment there was a boom of thunder, Yue Zhishi pushed open the door to the bathroom, his shoulders trembling. He felt like he\u2019d entered a restricted area with no light. He was hoping no one knew he\u2019d run over here, as though he would be terrified of someone noticing how he and Song Yu had appeared at the same time \u2014 as though he would be terrified of someone learning of his relationship with Song Yu.The bathroom was empty, with only a large area for washing hands and a large sink. Song Yu was standing inside, looking like he\u2019d just washed his hands.Yue Zhishi opened his mouth very quietly, calling out Song Yu gege, and then started a conversation very unnaturally.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s really raining too hard today.\u201dHe blankly became aware of one thing: many things, before they occurred, were actually long foreshadowed.The weather report had loudly and clearly told him that there was going to be a heavy rainstorm; warnings had come again and again.He hadn\u2019t dared to believe it, but there was no way he could prevent it from happening.But this realisation was dim and ambiguous; at that time, Yue Zhishi had still yet to fully understand it.Song Yu took a few steps towards him. Lightning appeared once again, and it completely lit up this cramped room of a few square metres. In that short moment, Song Yu saw Yue Zhishi\u2019s face clearly: his soft and short hair, his light-coloured eyes, his eyelashes, his neck as pale as porcelain as it stretched up from the collar of his shirt \u2014 he saw his long and slender fingers, as well as the faint veins slightly bulging up from his lowered arms.\u201cMn.\u201d Because his mind had strayed, Song Yu gave Yue Zhishi a belated response before subconsciously saying, \u201cWhy are you here.\u201dBut that sentence of his was concealed by the sound of thunder.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t hear it, and so he didn\u2019t reply to it. His fear didn\u2019t need to be hidden away in front of Song Yu; he didn\u2019t need to worry that Song Yu would ridicule his biological fear like the boy sitting behind him \u2014 and so Yue Zhishi took a few steps closer to him and arrived in front of Song Yu.Song Yu\u2019s shadow safely caged around Yue Zhishi.Song Yu wanted to comfort him, wanted to tell him to not be afraid, but he didn\u2019t know how best to do it. But Yue Zhishi grabbed hold of his wrist before he could \u2014 he wrapped a hand around the watch Song Yu very much treasured, and then he moved upwards slightly and held onto Song Yu\u2019s forearm.Damp skin attached itself to a palm. Yue Zhishi was holding him very lightly, but it felt like he was clutching Song Yu\u2019s heart.\u201cWe can hug for a bit, right.\u201dHe said it tentatively, but he moved very straightforwardly as if afraid Song Yu would release a sound of rejection \u2014 he immediately went to embrace Song Yu. The metal name badge on his shirt collar seemed to accidentally knock into Song Yu\u2019s badge, and the minute sound of clashing that emerged from the darkness echoed in Song Yu\u2019s ear for a very long time.Slightly surprised, he didn\u2019t raise his hands to return Yue Zhishi\u2019s hug, but Yue Zhishi wouldn\u2019t be able to see the look on his face with his head buried into his collarbone. He was hugging Song Yu like he\u2019d used to as a child, as candidly and naturally as he\u2019d used to do almost every morning in the past.But this was the first time they completed an embrace in a random dark corner of their school \u2014 an embrace no one else knew about.\u201cYour body smells really nice,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, using a tone of voice devoid of any wicked intentions to say inappropriate words. His arms were wrapped around Song Yu\u2019s back, drawing stability from Song Yu\u2019s body.It was slightly awkward how silent Song Yu was, but when thunder sounded again, he subconsciously raised a hand and stroked Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair from behind. His other arm landed very softly on Yue Zhishi\u2019s back, as though he didn\u2019t plan on using any strength to surround Yue Zhishi.A strange fantasy flickered across his mind for a moment; right now, he felt like they were a pair of secondary school students dating early.But that thought was rapidly drowned by the sounds of rain \u2014 rainwater nailed it deeply into the earth.Yue Zhishi clutched him very tightly when the thunder boomed, and after a few seconds, he slightly relaxed his arms. In Song Yu\u2019s arms, he took in a deep breath.\u201cWhy did you come downstairs?\u201d he softly asked Song Yu.Song Yu didn\u2019t know how to reply; it wasn\u2019t as though he could say he\u2019d been worried and had wanted to head over to see him before finding himself being particularly foolish after walking halfway. And then had stopped at the stairs.\u201c\u2026To wash my hands,\u201d he said very simply.Yue Zhishi let out a soft \u2018oh\u2019. Separated by two layers of shirts, he could feel Song Yu\u2019s chest, faintly vibrating.\u201cBut doesn\u2019t the fifth floor have a bathroom too?\u201d he directly asked, having thought of it.Song Yu\u2019s voice turned stiff.\u201cYue Zhishi.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking so much. Are you not scared anymore?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dYue Zhishi shut his mouth in a hurry, before opening it again after two seconds.\u201cHug just a little while longer,\u201d he earnestly requested.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I recently heard that traditional Chinese romantic phrase from my dad, and I found it really odd: every time I receive one of your letters, I feel like I\u2019ve already seen you so many times. Waiting really is something hard to do. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll believe me, but last month, when I didn\u2019t receive a letter from you, I even went and bought a plane ticket to China for myself \u2014 but I woke up in the taxi on my way to the airport. Because you\u2019ve said before that you really hoped our first meeting after growing up would be you coming to see me.I heard from Dad that you\u2019ll be coming here in the summer. I can take you out to the pastures to see newly born baby lambs, and my little garden would also be blooming with so many flowers during then. As well as the\u00a0White Cliffs\u00a0and the coastline \u2014 we can ride over to them with bikes.I really hope summer would\u2019ve arrived by the time I wake up tomorrow.]The summer of his eighteenth year, Song Yu and his parents got onto a plane flying towards London. With the flight taking eleven and a half hours, it was already 7pm when they arrived, but in a country so high above the equator, daylight lasted extraordinarily long. Night had yet to fall, and the streets were still bustling with people.Yue Yi and Olivia specifically came to pick up their family of three. Even though he hadn\u2019t seen them in a good few years, Song Yu thought they hadn\u2019t changed much at all \u2014 Yue Yi was still as cheerful and lively as he\u2019d always been.\u201cXiao Yu\u2019s grown so quickly. I don\u2019t think you were this tall the last time I saw you when I was back in China by myself.\u201dSong Jin said, smiling, \u201cHe\u2019s at that growing age. Your kid\u2019s half European, wouldn\u2019t he be growing even faster?\u201dOlivia could already understand a majority of their Chinese conversations, and she said with English-accented Chinese,\u00a0he isn\u2019t.Yue Yi also waved a hand. \u201cMy kid definitely isn\u2019t growing as fast as your son, he\u2019s shorter by at least\u2026\u201d He gauged Song Yu\u2019s height with his eyes. \u201cHalf a head.\u201d Then, the tone of his voice saying \u2018please don\u2019t blame me\u2019, he said, \u201cYue Zhishi\u2019s school started summer holidays early, so he packed up a bunch of things and went to our holiday home. The place is more comfortable than an apartment and tall buildings after all, and it also has the garden he loves. We originally asked him to come over and pick you guys up, but he was called over by the owner of the nearby pasture to help take care of their young lambs.\u201dHe shrugged. \u201cYou know how he is. He gets all weak in the legs as soon as he sees small animals.\u201dSong Jin and Lin Rong both chuckled, and they brought up the amusing stories of how Yue Zhishi had chased after squirrels in parks as a child. Everyone got in the car, laughing and chattering, and conversation flowed naturally; they were like good friends who saw each other every day, without any hint of unfamiliarity among them.In the car, the only person who felt regret was Song Yu.After all, the guy who\u2019d once written in his letters that he\u2019d \u2018definitely pick you up personally when you come\u2019 hadn\u2019t arrived.The gege who sent him monthly letters, in reality, couldn\u2019t compare to a little lamb.Song Yu leaned back into his seat, and he comforted himself as he looked out the window to the busy city flying past. Perhaps it was a large group of little lambs.The last time he and Yue Zhishi had seen each other was already an extremely long ago memory. At that time, Yue Zhishi had probably been only three or four years old. Later, there had been many times Yue Yi and his wife had wanted to take him back to China for a visit, but those plans had consistently been changed \u2014 most of them due to Yue Yi\u2019s work. Song Yu remembered very clearly a certain time when he had been eleven years old: he\u2019d waited for them to arrive very eagerly, but they hadn\u2019t been able to get on the plane. Yue Zhishi had had a sudden allergic attack, his asthma flaring up.Compared to modern, highly effective and fast ways of keeping in touch with friends, the one thing holding Yue Zhishi and Song Yu\u2019s relationship together was their monthly handwritten letters. Yue Yi and his inherent romantic nature had thought of it; he found cellphones and chatting software to be the worst inventions in the world, omitting the process of careful thought and of waiting. Instead, they threw everything to the person on the other side with a sudden crash \u2014 they weren\u2019t as warm and tender as even a phone call.He\u2019d said it would be good to write letters. He\u2019d said, you\u2019ll consciously consider your wording as you write. You\u2019ll knead all of your emotions and feelings into the paper and into your writing, simply because you have no other way to express your voice and yourself \u2014 and then, as you wait for a reply, your feelings will ferment and grow.On the other hand, Yue Yi believed Yue Zhishi also needed to master the ability to write in Chinese since he\u2019d grown up in England. There was no one else more suitable to be his partner in training than the older brother far away in his motherland.They established a very strange, yet very interesting, promise: they could only write letters to each other \u2014 any other form of communication was cheating.And so just like that, from a very young age, Song Yu had started exchanging letters with Yue Zhishi at a rate of usually once a month. Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t quite been able to write Chinese characters in the beginning, and even if Yue Yi had been there to guide him, Yue Zhishi had preferred to communicate with Song Yu through straightforward drawings. Song Yu had been ten years old the first time he received a written letter from Yue Zhishi.[Song Yu gege, your name\u2019s so hard to write.]It was clearly only one sentence, only eleven words, and yet Song Yu had looked at it again and again for a very long time. He\u2019d found it so very cute.And then even later, Yue Zhishi started to become even more familiar with Chinese writing. He\u2019d even use sentences and phrases he\u2019d read in books, flaunting his Chinese skills like a little peacock. Slowly, he started to talk to Song Yu about all the large and small problems in his life as he grew up, the confusion and bewilderment of puberty; he confided them all to Song Yu without holding a single thing back.Or perhaps the long distance separating them created a sense of security and a kind of beauty. This secret communication between the two of them over such a distance allowed them to grow up with each other, and yet it also made them infinitely curious about each other.\u201cIt\u2019s already a bit late. You guys\u2019ll be really tired with the time difference, so we won\u2019t drive over there tonight.\u201d Yue Yi took them back to his home on the outskirts of London so they could rest. It was a very cozy, very beautiful apartment with two floors in a row of tall buildings. Olivia settled Song Yu into Yue Zhishi\u2019s room.Pulling open the door, she used English to introduce the room to him and gave him some toiletries. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit childish, so there are a lot of things in his room. Don\u2019t mind them.\u201dThere were many, many books inside, and there was even a book of plant drawings spread open on the rug. A half-drawn still life painting rested on the easel, and the room was stuffed full with plants, ornaments and lego pieces \u2014 it looked filled with life.Song Yu quietly said, \u201cActually, I hope he wouldn\u2019t mind me living here for one night.\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t. He was the one to suggest you sleeping here, because he thought the guest room was too small.\u201d Amusement appeared on Olivia\u2019s face. \u201cHe said you\u2019re obsessed with cleanliness and begged me to clean up his room before you arrived. But I finished work too late today and didn\u2019t have the time.\u201d As she spoke, she tugged open the closet. \u201cXiao Yu, you should go downstairs and eat something first.\u201dSong Yu stood by the bed, his head slightly lowered. His eyes swept over that light blue coloured bed \u2014 it looked particularly clean and comfortable.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t need to,\u201d he said to the busily cleaning Olivia.He\u2019d originally thought jet lag was something very torturous, but Yue Zhishi\u2019s bed seemed to hold a power that could pull people quickly into sleep. Song Yu lay down, and as he gazed at the six small pots of exquisite plants sitting on the windowsill, at the unfinished painting; as he breathed in the gentle fragrance of plants, cream and wood embedded into the fluffy bedding \u2014 he fell into the dreams of deep sleep.The next day, as Song Yu was making the bed, he belatedly thought: it felt delicately offensive to sleep in someone\u2019s bed before actually meeting him.Turning around, he saw the desk plastered with many sticky notes. Yue Zhishi\u2019s English handwriting made it very easy to think of his handwriting in Chinese; they were both flowing and delicate. But Song Yu didn\u2019t really read the notes, thinking it would be inappropriate \u2014 even if that guy had given him the right to use his entire room without a single care.After breakfast, they started driving to their holiday home. It was in a village an hour\u2019s drive away from London, located in the south of England and near a seaside town. According to Yue Yi, that place had the best sunlight in the entire country compared to London\u2019s unpredictable weather.Olivia made a call when they were almost there. Song Yu looked like he was casually watching the scenery outside the car windows, but the soft sounds coming from her phone disturbed him like the rippling on a magnetic field.It was as though he could hear Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice \u2014 but it was distorted, unclear.He heard Olivia call Yue Zhishi by his English name of \u2018Joey\u2019 and heard her call him \u2018sweetheart\u2019, but he couldn\u2019t clearly hear what Yue Zhishi said in return. For some reason, it made Song Yu somewhat irritated. Summer in a temperate marine climate wasn\u2019t so scorching hot, and as the humid summer wind stroked his face through the window, it felt both tender and smooth \u2014 very much like Yue Zhishi in his letters.[Song Yu gege, I heard you guys have had a really long period of rain. What a coincidence, London has too. It suddenly started to rain yesterday at dusk, and I was completely soaked in the rain. I was originally in a really terrible mood, but when I remembered that you might also be under the rain at the same time as me, my heart suddenly felt really sweet \u2014 it felt like you and I were actually really close to each other.As always, I hope you can come earlier. I\u2019m here, waiting for you.]The car entered the town, driving through large areas of green broad-leaf trees. The grass was like a short-hair rug, and on top of it, honey-coloured cottages were scattered around, mixed with dark grey lodges.\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d Yue Yi parked the car in front of a three story resort house, and everyone got out of the car, heading to the boot to take out the luggage. Song Yu followed Olivia into the house with a black suitcase, passing by a front courtyard with white roses and unnamed hedges. A tea table and several chairs were placed on the lawn. When the front door was opened, he saw a sweetly decorated living room, an opened sunscreen bottle sitting on the table, a light blue baseball cap and an opened carton of cold milk. A red cotton short sleeve shirt was thrown over the back of a chair.\u201cHe\u2019s definitely in the backyard,\u201d Olivia said with certainty.Sounds of water came from the backyard; Song Yu could hear it. The wooden floor underneath his feet seemed to have turned into driftwood washed up from the ocean, and his senses also seemed to have turned sharp and keen.The moment he stepped outside, sunlight landed on Song Yu\u2019s face. He couldn\u2019t quite see clearly \u2014 under the gleaming rays of the sun, everything looked like an overexposed photo film. He faintly squinted; bushes of lilac coloured hydrangeas appeared. A snow white back was partly visible through the green leaves, as well as a spout of water rising up into the air and arcing over, accompanied by a faint rainbow.\u201cJoey!\u201d Olivia shouted at him to stop, her hands on her waist. \u201cYou\u2019re showering with the hose meant for the flowers again!\u201dThe water instantly disappeared, and so did the gurgling and sloshing sounds of water.An alarmed face turned around within those hydrangeas, a golden halo surrounding the wet hair under the sunshine \u2014 his eyes were very large, and they were as translucent as gemstones.To see someone\u2019s words is to see them.It didn\u2019t matter that he\u2019d seen over a hundred letters; they were nothing compared to a fleeting appearance.But Yue Zhishi, having been rebuked, very quickly turned his head back around. Soon after, Song Yu heard a long, dragged out and extremely adorable \u2018sorry\u2019, and then he saw a large grey towel draping over that snow white back before it came out from the other side of the bushes.With bare feet, he walked on the soft lawn, his pair of legs pale and dressed in navy blue swimming shorts. The towel was on his upper body, but his fair belly and arms remained uncovered. His wet hair was pushed back behind his ears, exposing a pair of eyes that looked even more pure after being soaked in water.\u201cThis is the gege you\u2019ve been longing for every day,\u201d Olivia deliberately introduced with a tease.Yue Zhishi rubbed his hands together with some embarrassment and then stretched out a hand, clasping their hands together. Cold and warm body temperatures blended together and transferred across \u2014 Yue Zhishi\u2019s lowered eyelashes were stained with water droplets, subtly trembling.His voice was also really nice to listen to, and he specifically used Chinese to speak, as though to communicate how earnest he was. With a slightly accented voice, he called him, \u201cSong Yu gege.\u201dFor a moment, many of Yue Zhishi\u2019s handwritten letters flashed across Song Yu\u2019s mind. Paragraphs and paragraphs of grumbling spoken only to those close to him, the boasting filled with childishness \u2014 they were matched one by one to the person in front of him, and gave him a concrete sweetness.The corners of Song Yu\u2019s mouth curled up gently. While holding his hand, he intentionally used Yue Zhishi\u2019s most commonly used word of \u2018lovely\u2019 and said to him in deep voice in English, \u201cLovely to see you.\u201dIt was as though someone had twisted Yue Zhishi\u2019s ears; they appeared a translucent red underneath the sun. Saying he was going to change his clothes, he released Song Yu\u2019s hand and then ran directly into the house, grabbing the red shirt on the chair as he passed by.His entire body, from head to toe, projected a youthfulness that brimmed with exuberance.It was in Song Yu\u2019s room on the third floor that they saw each other again. Song Yu was unpacking his luggage when he suddenly heard a knock, and when he turned around, he saw Yue Zhishi standing by the door, wearing black shorts and the red shirt that made his pale skin glow. He walked inside very naturally, and his brown, slightly curly hair was very soft and fluffy after being blown dry.\u201cYou\u2019re not how I imagined you being.\u201d Yue Zhishi skipped over any greetings and came very directly to stand in front of Song Yu. He used curious eyes to look over him, not hesitant at all.Song Yu placed down the rash guard in his hand and also looked at him. He calmly asked, \u201cHow am I different?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s mouth abruptly curved up with laughter. He nervously swung his arms twice before clutching them with his hands. After he released a sigh, he sincerely said, \u201cYou\u2019re even more handsome than I\u2019d thought you\u2019d be.\u201dSeeing how unmoved Song Yu was to that kind of praise, Yue Zhishi then quickly asked, \u201cHas there been a lot of people who\u2019ve called you handsome? Have a lot of girls at your school asked you to be their date for prom?\u201dSong Yu hung up his final shirt, and with his back towards Yue Zhishi, he used a careless voice to say, \u201cWe don\u2019t have prom. So there\u2019s also no such thing as being their date.\u201dYue Zhishi relaxed very obviously. \u201cNow that\u2019s truly very fortunate.\u201dTurning around, Song Yu saw Yue Zhishi already sitting on his bed, his slender and pale long legs spread open and lightly swinging \u2014 he looked particularly pleased.\u201cDon\u2019t you know I care about cleanliness?\u201dYue Zhishi looked startled at his words, his eyes widening slightly. But then Song Yu said very quickly, \u201cJust joking.\u201dBaffled, Yue Zhishi said, \u201cSo you\u2019re not actually a germaphobe.\u201dSong Yu gave him a more explicit answer. \u201cNot towards you.\u201dHe then walked out the door, Yue Zhishi quickly getting up and following behind him. He told Song Yu his room was next door and even attempted to show him his balcony, but Song Yu didn\u2019t go in. Only their two rooms were on this floor; the second floor contained the two couples\u2019 bedrooms, and he could hear their laughing and happy chatter when standing on the stairs.For lunch, they had barbecue and French fries underneath the shade of the front courtyard\u2019s trees. Yue Zhishi struggled to cut a steak with tendons, and sitting next to him, Lin Rong declared that she was definitely going to cook a table full of delicious local Chinese dishes for him that afternoon. He\u2019d been looking forward to that for a long time, and so he placed down his knife and fork and gave Lin Rong a grateful kiss on the cheek.Song Yu sat diagonally across from him, sipping on a gin and tonic. His eyes occasionally landed on Yue Zhishi and watched how excited and bubbling he looked.\u201cYou went swimming today?\u201d Yue Yi asked Yue Zhishi.\u201cYup. The pool was so cold, and it wasn\u2019t clean, which is why I had a shower when I came back.\u201d Yue Zhishi explained himself.Olivia laughed as she served them, saying, \u201cBut that\u2019s not a reason to greet guests with a bare body.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s face flushed again. He hadn\u2019t had a single sip of the gin and vermouth on the table, yet his face was suffused by an adorable blush. Song Yu had had some of the alcohol, but he had no reaction to it at all, his head lowered as he carefully sliced a plate of beef, precise and refined.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t count, I was wearing swimming shorts.\u201d Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but retort, \u201cBesides, I was covered by a towel.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, only his feet were bare,\u201d Yue Yi helpfully added for him.The adults around the table cracked up. Song Yu lifted his eyes and met Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes, noticing he would dodge away from his gaze. Yue Zhishi shifted his eyes back after two seconds and asked if he wanted fish, stumbling over his words.Song Yu took a piece of grilled trout from him, said thank you and then offered over the plate of beef he\u2019d already sliced up.\u201cNo need to exchange.\u201d Yue Zhishi hurriedly waved a hand at him.\u201cIt\u2019s not an exchange.\u201d Standing up, Song Yu placed the plate in front of Yue Zhishi, his tall shadow enveloping him. \u201cI was slicing it up for you.\u201dYue Zhishi was somewhat stunned, quietly saying thank you before stuffing a piece into his mouth. The adults were joking with things such as \u2018it must be nice to have an older brother\u2019. Yue Zhishi\u2019s cheeks were bulging from the food, and he occasionally glanced at Song Yu as he chewed.It was time to relax after eating, and everyone sat in the front courtyard, drinking tea. Song Yu sat there for a while, reading a few pages of a book on a rocking chair, and started to feel slightly tired. And so he went upstairs, hearing the sound of overlapping footsteps when he arrived at the third floor.Like a hunter waiting for his prey to fall into his trap, he waited behind his room door \u2014 he even obtained a flustered look.\u201cAre\u2026 Are you going to sleep?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked, looking at Song Yu.\u201cMaybe.\u201d Song Yu pulled open his door slightly wider, like an invitation for someone to enter his room.\u201cDon\u2019t sleep.\u201d Yue Zhishi went in very naturally, and he even caught Song Yu\u2019s wrist. \u201cI knew you were coming, so I spent several days planning. I wrote down all the fun, beautiful places in England and waited for you. And yet now you want to sleep during such a nice day.\u201dHe added, \u201cYou don\u2019t know how hard it is to get nice weather in England.\u201dSong Yu now believed English people all liked to discuss the weather. At the same time, he now realised there was a strange quality about Yue Zhishi: he held the sincerity and self-confidence of someone who\u2019d never been hurt before. He could express himself without worrying about anything, and he was shy within reason, not feeling awkward simply because it was their first meeting. He approached him very naturally, and wasn\u2019t scared of being rejected.Of course, Song Yu also had no way of rejecting Yue Zhishi.\u201cThen let\u2019s carry out your plans.\u201d Song Yu thought of the nickname Yue Zhishi\u2019s mother had called him over the phone in the car, and so he added for himself, \u201cLittle tour guide.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t know what the Chinese words of \u2018tour guide\u2019 meant, but he became really excited after asking. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely be an extremely amazing tour guide.\u201dHe took Song Yu biking around the coastline. There wasn\u2019t a beach filled with fine white sand here, but the coastline was filled with sparkling cobblestones. A small store sold strawberry waffles overflowing with cream by the side of the road, and even though Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t eat waffles, he still turned back to look at it three times before Song Yu himself said he really wanted to have one.\u201cReally?\u201d Yue Zhishi was very surprised, rapidly stopping his bike. \u201cI\u2019ll buy one for you.\u201dBut Song Yu only had one bite before handing it to him, saying it was too sweet. Yue Zhishi forked a really large strawberry covered with cream into his mouth, and he mumbled, \u201cBut it tastes okay.\u201d\u201cStrawberry waffle.\u201d Song Yu pointed at the container in his hand. \u201cYou eat the strawberries, I\u2019ll handle the waffle.\u201dThey reached an agreement, the understanding between them as natural as though they\u2019d grown up together even if they hadn\u2019t.Song Yu fell under an illusion of having watched Yue Zhishi grown up, but a vividly alive Yue Zhishi was standing in front of him with so many gorgeous details Song Yu had never thought of: the shallow dimple at the corner of his mouth whenever he smiled, how he rubbed his arms as he spoke, the confidence as he introduced the town\u2019s architecture.\u201cThis is one of England\u2019s most open places. The LGBT community celebrates and marches here every summer. Everything would be covered in rainbows and would be really beautiful.\u201dHaving reached this topic, he tentatively tried to read Song Yu\u2019s expression.\u201cReally?\u201d Song Yu mildly said, \u201cSounds nice.\u201dThe ocean was in front of their eyes, and they walked on top of the cobblestones with their shoes on. Men and women, dressed in bikinis and swimming trunks, filled the beach. Yue Zhishi took Song Yu to the edge of the water and suggested for him to take off his shoes, to experience the water. Song Yu did so, and with their shoes in their hands, they stood there, the salty sea breeze wafting up their clothes and the tide surging up to caress their feet and ankles.\u201cSo cold.\u201d Yue Zhishi was grinning like a small child, and he drew a bit closer to Song Yu, his round big toe brushing against the edge of Song Yu\u2019s sole. Their feet were different in size, and Song Yu\u2019s skin was slightly darker, Yue Zhishi appearing even paler in the water like a luminous piece of porcelain.Song Yu also shifted closer slightly; he even stepped on the back of Yue Zhishi\u2019s fair and soft foot with half of his own. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t move away.A movement like that was even more intimate than holding hands.When Song Yu pulled back his foot, water undulating, Yue Zhishi placed his own foot on top of Song Yu\u2019s \u2014 and then he tilted up his face to him, smiling.\u201cIs this revenge?\u201d Song Yu said.\u201cThis is communication,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, face serious. They stood shoulder to shoulder in the midst of ocean water and sea breeze, arm grazing against arm. Yue Zhishi lowered his head, measuring, and then he grabbed Song Yu\u2019s wrist and lifted it high \u2014 it wasn\u2019t to hold hands with him, but rather, it was to measure Song Yu\u2019s wrist with his thumb and index finger. He wasn\u2019t able to circle around Song Yu\u2019s wrist completely. The flesh of his fingers, separated by skin, pressed onto Song Yu\u2019s protruding wrist bones, Song Yu\u2019s veins pulsing with life.\u201cI have a watch,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, holding onto his wrist. \u201cIt\u2019ll really suit you.\u201d\u201cYours?\u201d Song Yu turned his hand and also caught onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s very slender wrist.\u201cYes, but I\u2019ve only worn it once. Actually\u2026\u201dAs he spoke, a caucasian girl with brown hair in a black bikini headed towards them, her eyes locked onto Song Yu\u2019s body and sizing up his broad shoulders and outstanding features. Standing in front of Song Yu, she very enthusiastically asked if he was here as an overseas student or on a holiday, and asked if he wanted to enjoy a cocktail with her at the bar nearby.Yue Zhishi had also raised his face at this time, his eyebrows faintly drawn together.Song Yu refused her, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve already had some alcohol.\u201dThe girl keenly understood his meaning, as well as the opposition coming from the boy next to him. She couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cAh, sorry. I didn\u2019t know you guys were together.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s knit eyebrows spread open, and they turned into the eyebrows of a panic-stricken face. He awkwardly shook his head, but he wasn\u2019t quite willing to shake his head too definitively.\u201cWe\u2026\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t deny it, but neither did he admit it; instead, he wrapped a hand around Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrist. The girl left after saying\u00a0I won\u2019t bother you guys on your date anymore.\u201cWe\u2019re not on a date,\u201d Yue Zhishi weakly said, once she\u2019d disappeared.Song Yu let go. \u201cSeeing each other for the first time after so many years \u2014 to say it a bit more solemnly, it could be considered as keeping an appointment.\u201dYue Zhishi did his best to understand what he was saying, and he saw the faint red mark left on his wrist after Song Yu had held it.\u201cI wasn\u2019t finished speaking, earlier.\u201d Yue Zhishi gazed at the side of Song Yu\u2019s face. \u201cThat watch I\u2019ve only worn once \u2014 I actually bought it for you.\u201d\u201cI wanted to send you a birthday present.\u201dAnd yet they were only allowed to send letters to each other.\u201cBut that would be against the rules, right?\u201d Yue Zhishi seemed to be talking to himself.\u201cI\u2019m in front of you now.\u201d Song Yu was also looking back at him. \u201cI broke the rules first.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s eyelashes gently quivered, his eyes clear yet confused.Song Yu said, \u201cDid you know you once sent the wrong letter?\u201dSeeing apprehension flare within Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes, Song Yu continued speaking.\u201cIt was a half complete letter. You crossed out more than half of it.\u201d[Song Yu gege, every time my asthma flares up, I always feel really depressed for a long time. Being unhealthy makes me really distressed, and every time it happens, I never want you to come and see me. When you come, I want to be healthy, to be filled with strength and energy. I hope you\u2019ll like the real me (I get rashes when I\u2019m sick, it\u2019s really ugly) and not just the name written in these letters. It\u2019s so strange; I actually don\u2019t remember seeing you as a child anymore, but I really miss you. Why do humans miss someone they\u2019ve never seen before?In the entire world, you\u2019re the only person to whom I can pour out my heart so utterly and completely. My family, my friends \u2014 none of them can take your place. As long as I see a letter from you in my mailbox, it doesn\u2019t matter what I\u2019ve gone through that day; I would be happy. You wouldn\u2019t believe me, but I had a dream about you while in bed after my asthma attack. We met, and we didn\u2019t shake each other\u2019s hands. Instead, you kissed my cheek and said in English, \u2018lovely to see you\u2019.The terrible thing is, that wasn\u2019t the worst of it. When I woke up, I actually felt so much regret \u2014 I wanted that kiss to land on my lips.Does that mean I like]\u201cZhishi.\u201d It was the first time he used that shortened name, one he\u2019d thought about so many times and always wanted to write at the beginning of his letters. But he\u2019d waver and change his mind every time he lowered his pen and started to write.That final incomplete sentence \u2014 seemingly calmly, Song Yu asked him face to face.\u201cDoes that mean you like me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was busy with university applications last time I received your letter, which is why this letter\u2019s coming a bit late. Apologies for the long wait. My parents received a call from your dad yesterday, and they said you were sick a while back. I don\u2019t know if it was serious or not, but I hope you\u2019re better by the time you receive this letter.Once everything\u2019s settled down, I\u2019ll fly over to see you. I actually really care about your body, so maybe you can try writing down an instruction manual for your day to day life and send it to me. If I can familiarise myself with it early, then I\u2019ll be able to avoid making any mistakes.I hope our first meeting will be perfect.]Because of how that letter had ended, Yue Zhishi had been convinced the person writing that final sentence was a perfectionist.Firstly, his handwriting was extremely graceful. From his upright, standard characters of childhood to the stylistic promise in the writing of his teenage years to its current matured script, Yue Zhishi had earnestly tried to copy every single phase. It was why his Chinese handwriting was so similar to Song Yu\u2019s, but it wasn\u2019t exactly the same.Secondly, Song Yu\u2019s letters never had a single wrinkle, and neither did they have any unnecessary smells. They were as clean as though they were freshly made. His signature at the end almost always looked exactly the same each time, looking like a stamp printed by a machine. If even letters had to go through quality control, then Song Yu\u2019s letters would definitely be marked as excellent.Finally, his request to receive a manual \u2014 it highlighted even more his unwillingness to make mistakes.His thoughts having reached this point, Yue Zhishi enthusiastically jumped out of bed, sat down at his desk and turned on the lamp, rapidly scribbling down things about himself on a piece of scrap paper. His allergens, the medications he took, the thunder he hated\u2026 But then, as he reached the end, Yue Zhishi suddenly felt nervous.Song Yu was unwilling to make mistakes.Then would his own feelings for him count as a mistake Song Yu would need to avoid?That question left teenaged Yue Zhishi at a loss for the first in his life.He didn\u2019t know how he ended up liking an older brother who existed only within pen and paper. It sounded a bit weird, like a plot from a fiction novel written in the previous century. But then he thought \u2014 many people in this day and age would also fall in love with fictional characters or with images carefully constructed on social media. He wasn\u2019t so pitiful compared to them: Song Yu was someone who existed in real life, after all. As long as he wanted to do so, he could break the rules and see him whenever he wanted.And Song Yu was just so outstanding. He was willing to listen to Yue Zhishi, and he\u2019d steadily given him care and attention as they\u2019d grown up. It didn\u2019t matter how many strange things he wrote in his letters; Song Yu understood them all, and returned back to him a continuous stream of new inspiration and insight.He was the person furthest away from Yue Zhishi in the entire world, and yet he was also the existence closest to him, no barriers in between.How could he not like Song Yu?Yue Zhishi had started to worry as soon as he\u2019d\u00a0 understood his own heart. Even though he was relatively confident in himself, he also knew very well that he wasn\u2019t perfect. There was nothing wrong with homosexuality, but it was less common. When placed onto him and Song Yu, the likelihood of both of them being homosexual at the same time was almost zero.He had more fantasies about Song Yu than about any other person in the world. At night, he would listen to the wind outside the window and imagine how Song Yu would look \u2014 Song Yu should be better looking than every other Chinese person he\u2019d seen.When reading his letters, Yue Zhishi would often fantasise about Song Yu speaking to him. Chinese was such a wonderful tonal language; the combination of its four tones made speaking as tonally rich and beautiful as singing. Song Yu would definitely also have a voice that could deliver those magical tones \u2014 and so Yue Zhishi worked very hard at learning them. But it was truly very hard: other than his father, Yue Zhishi essentially couldn\u2019t find anyone else with whom who he could practice Standard Chinese, and so he regularly spoke incorrectly. He even once wrote in a letter that if he didn\u2019t take care with the difference between the fourth tone and the second tone, he would end up reading out Song Yu\u2019s (y\u00f9) name as Song Fish (y\u00fa). Song Yu would then turn into an adorable little fish.And Song Yu had replied, \u201cI believe you can do it, you\u2019re a really smart student. But being a little fish wouldn\u2019t be too bad.\u201dYue Zhishi was both delighted and distressed at receiving a reply like that, faintly feeling as though Song Yu was indulging him. He couldn\u2019t tell if the indulgence came from \u2018like\u2019, or if it came from the care between friends \u2014 or if it came from the encouragement meant for someone younger.The more he thought about it, the grimmer he felt.That kind of confusion and anxiety became worse whenever Yue Zhishi was sick. He wrote many, many letters with a dazed and disorientated mind, and he also abandoned many of them. Not wanting to keep Song Yu waiting, he rushed to send off a letter on the very last day with his body still sick and heavy.He didn\u2019t expect to have sent away the wrong one.That ruined the entire plan Yue Zhishi had originally created. His plan had been to keep himself sufficiently mysterious before meeting Song Yu for the first time, so that Song Yu would be as eager as himself to meet; he would maintain his health and energy, and then probe Song Yu to see if he rejected homosexuality. If Song Yu didn\u2019t, then he would do his utter best and try to pursue him\u2026It was why he\u2019d specifically left London early once he knew Song Yu was on his way over. It was also why he\u2019d found an excuse to not pick him up \u2014 the airport wasn\u2019t a place for romantic encounters. And it was also why he\u2019d chosen to not foolishly wait by the door as Song Yu had driven up to the holiday home.Those plans Yue Zhishi had pondered over for a very long time \u2014 in the end, they were ruined by a mistakenly sent letter.The ocean breeze blew his hair onto his cheeks, pieces of it sticking to the bridge of his nose. Yue Zhishi uneasily wiped his hair away with his fingers, pushing down the panic he could feel rising up, but he couldn\u2019t hold it in completely; he rapidly blinked several times in the wind.The tide surged over them once again, this time washing over a third of his calves.Seeing how Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t respond, Song Yu spoke again. \u201cWas I too direct?\u201dHe guessed that Yue Zhishi would deny it before trying to explain something, stumbling over his words.But things would always go against expectations.A chagrined, even somewhat discouraged, look appeared on Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. He lowered his face and pressed his lips together, a good few seconds passing before he raised his eyes to look at Song Yu. In a spiteful voice, he complained, \u201cYes, and it\u2019s because of you.\u201d\u201cI avoided all those mistakes so carefully, but it was no use at all. You still ended up finding out.\u201dFor some inexplicable reason, for an instant, Song Yu felt like their words to each other were very familiar, as though he\u2019d heard them somewhere before \u2014 like a delusion that had come from an entirely different world and time. He even had a premonition that perhaps Yue Zhishi would start crying.He hoped he wouldn\u2019t.But Yue Zhishi, in this time, didn\u2019t cry.\u201cYou ruined my plan.\u201d The sound of his voice as he complained was familiar to Song Yu, because Song Yu had already imagined a sound like that a countless amount of times as he read Yue Zhishi\u2019s letters. Yue Zhishi\u2019s real voice was more beautiful and pleasant to listen to than the one he\u2019d imagined.Yue Zhishi raised up a foot slightly and kicked the water, looking like he was letting out some of the despondency in his heart, the spray of the water splashing onto Song Yu\u2019s pants. Soon after, Yue Zhishi tilted up his face and used those incomparably clear amber eyes to look directly at Song Yu. \u201cI do like you. And I also want to pursue you.\u201dAs though thinking he sounded too impulsive, Yue Zhishi called him by his name like an adult. \u201cSong Yu, I\u2019m really serious.\u201d And in order to sound even more earnest, he even switched to his mother language, in which he could speak more precisely and not make a mistake. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not a perfect person. That\u2019s why I wanted to use a perfect plan to get you to like me \u2014 at least, the chances of it happening would be higher.\u201dHis English words came much faster, and they sounded like they left his mouth without him thinking about them, both blunt and candid. Tiny little expressions flickered over his face, even looking a bit exaggerated. \u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering what kind of freak I am to like someone who writes me letters every month, but you should actually think this way instead: I ended up liking the person you portray yourself as in your letters and wasn\u2019t attracted by something else. Unlike the other people who like you, that means I don\u2019t care as much about your appearance.\u201dSong Yu seemed to think what he\u2019d said was a bit funny; he looked like he was holding back a laugh.And so Yue Zhishi felt offended. \u201cIs that funny?\u201dSong Yu shook his head extremely casually, and he also used English to say to him, \u201cNo. I was just thinking you\u2019re really cute.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s ears flushed once again. His heart was beating very quickly, the speed of it the same as whenever he silently read out Song Yu\u2019s letters and pondered over the meaning behind them, trying to find vague hints of Song Yu also feeling the same way towards him. But Song Yu\u2019s writing was always so impartial \u2014 his words were so delicately written that they couldn\u2019t be considered as hints at all. Over many, many nights, they poured over Yue Zhishi like hot rainwater and drenched him from inside to out; they surged over him with life, no part of him left dry.At this moment, because of Song Yu\u2019s one single compliment, that hot rain flooded over him and left Yue Zhishi with no way to resist. He was about to fall down into the rain.\u201cAm\u2026 Am I cute?\u201d In his nervousness, Yue Zhishi\u2019s languages tangled up and turned into a mix of English and Chinese. When Chinese came out of his mouth, he realised he was speaking it in a supremely strange accent \u2014 and that was a stupid thing he had previously determined to never let happen in front of Song Yu.The amusement in the corners of Song Yu\u2019s mouth became even more obvious, and he switched back to Chinese very considerately, following along with Yue Zhishi. \u201cYes, you\u2019re really cute. And also very noble for not liking my appearance. Not shallow at all.\u201d\u201cI like how you look too.\u201d Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but correct him, and he also reminded Song Yu, \u201cI already complimented you when I first saw you. But liking your appearance doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m superficial and ignoble. You can\u2019t blame an admiring heart.\u201d\u201cClassmate Yue Zhishi, your translation-ese is way too obvious.\u201d Song Yu pretended to be a strict Chinese private tutor. \u201cI told you long ago not to learn Chinese through English-translated Chinese poems and books.\u201dBut Yue Zhishi stayed firm, not letting Song Yu\u2019s interruption change the topic of the conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you understand what I\u2019m saying. Song Yu, did you understand? I really like you.\u201dThe peach fuzz on his face was translucent underneath the afternoon sun, and it made him look soft and warm. He\u2019d only just finished speaking when he lifted up both his hands, palms facing Song Yu. \u201cDon\u2019t rush to reject me, it\u2019s fine even if you don\u2019t feel that way towards me right now. I can pursue you.\u201dSuddenly, Song Yu placed one of his broad and dry palms against Yue Zhishi\u2019s, and his eyes also met his. His incomparably handsome face was quiet and tranquil.\u201cHow would you pursue me?\u201d he first asked, and then he continued speaking. \u201cI hear British people really care about others entering their personal spaces. Are you pursuing me by letting me sleep in your bed? Or by letting me see how you looked showering with your upper body bare? Or perhaps by taking me to see the LGBT community\u2019s rainbow parade and then getting some flash of inspiration?\u201d\u201cYue Zhishi.\u201d He used an abundantly alluring voice to call his name and, as though he was pronouncing a judgment, asserted with complete certainty, \u201cThat\u2019s not called pursuing. That\u2019s called seducing.\u201dYue Zhishi froze; for a moment, he thought he was going to have an asthma attack. Why else would he find it hard to breathe \u2014 why else would he start sweating and feel his heart palpitating.He subconsciously said\u00a0no, wanting to deny it, but before he could pull his hands away, Song Yu curved down his fingers and pushed them down between the spaces of Yue Zhishi\u2019s fingers like the cogs of two gears fitting together.\u201cYou\u2019re still not admitting it? The fish\u2019s already on the hook.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Yue Zhishi frowned in doubt, and then he used English to say\u00a0that\u2019s not possible. He seemed really afraid of misunderstanding something, so he said to Song Yu in a request, \u201cDon\u2019t use metaphors.\u201dSong Yu swung down that hand interlocked with Yue Zhishi\u2019s fingers, and he responded to every single thing Yue Zhishi had previously said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to pursue me, because I\u2019m not planning on rejecting you. I feel the same way towards you.\u201dHe raised an eyebrow. \u201cI like you. Understand?\u201dYue Zhishi thought he was going to drown in this blinding sea.He belatedly felt Song Yu\u2019s thumb stroking and rubbing the skin on the back of his hand, and he abruptly pulled away his hand in a bit of reflex. Certain sensitive nerves in his body were ignited by Song Yu, and a flush climbed up his face, his hands and legs weakening.\u201cThen now\u2026 We\u2026\u201d He was a bit flustered, as though the one who\u2019d just frankly expressed his feelings wasn\u2019t himself.\u201cIf someone else comes by to hit on me,\u201d Song Yu\u2019s mouth curved, \u201cyou can tell her we\u2019re together.\u201dEverything felt like a summer night\u2019s dream. Successfully obtaining the person he adored on the first day they met again \u2014 in that moment, Yue Zhishi felt like he was the luckiest person in the world. But because he hadn\u2019t planned what he would do after successfully pursuing Song Yu, he became much clumsier afterwards compared to his confession.He took Song Yu along the coastline, and when he saw a gay couple kissing together on the beach, he became so nervous his hands and feet started moving together at the same time. He didn\u2019t dare look at Song Yu; like someone fulfilling their tour guide duties, he said to Song Yu\u00a0I\u2019ll take you to the White Cliffs\u00a0and then got on his bike, looking like he was fleeing.Song Yu didn\u2019t make fun of him, very indulgently following Yue Zhishi to many places he\u2019d planned out. Together, they saw the White Cliffs and an art gallery painted in a mint colour, as well as numerous buildings painted in rainbow colours. They shuttled back and forth within the large roads and small alleyways of this artistic seaside town, and as night approached, they biked back home together.With tacit understanding, they didn\u2019t tell their parents of their changed relationship. It was too fragile, like a baby only just born for one day that needed to be protected in swaddling clothes.\u201cJoey, your face\u2019s so red from the sun.\u201d Olivia was holding a large bowl of caesar salad. \u201cYou should\u2019ve worn your cap.\u201dYue Zhishi helplessly stammered out an agreement, and then he followed his nose into the kitchen. \u201cIs this for me?\u201dLin Rong chuckled, saying yes. \u201cThese are pearl meatballs, I think you\u2019ll like them. Here, try one.\u201d She lifted one up on a fork and fed it to Yue Zhishi. He only realised it was really hot when he bit down, and yet he was reluctant to spit it back out \u2014 he could only stand there and open his mouth, puffing out the hot air.He looked adorably silly. Walking over, Song Yu poured a cup of ice water and handed it to him before going upstairs by himself to change his clothes.Yue Zhishi fell in love with Lin Rong\u2019s cooking through just one dinner\u2019s worth of food, to the point Olivia was jealous. She said, \u201cMay as well send you to live at Uncle\u2019s place.\u201dYue Yi took a sip of his white wine, smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea. Old Song\u2019s better than me at raising children.\u201d\u201cStop buttering me up.\u201d Song Jin had also had some alcohol, his face flushed. \u201cJoking like that and you haven\u2019t even asked if he wants to live with me.\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d Yue Zhishi nodded very earnestly. \u201cCan I really go?\u201d\u201cHahahahaha he took it the most seriously!\u201d\u201cI see you really have been lured away by your mouth.\u201dThe adults were laughing, yet Yue Zhishi sneaked a look at Song Yu, his ears red. That was the true bait luring him away.That night, Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t quite sleep. He kept thinking of Song Yu, who was separated from him by only a wall. Even though they\u2019d only seen each other for ten hours, Yue Zhishi felt like he\u2019d already liked him over many years \u2014 over many times.He\u2019d originally thought his nerves were creating trouble and throwing themselves up in arms simply because ten hours was simply too short of a time; he\u2019d thought he would calm down once they spent a bit more time together. But ten days passed, and then thirty \u2014 those feelings remained as deep and etched into him as before.Song Yu was going to start university at the end of summer, studying the geology he liked. It was why Yue Zhishi wanted to use this difficult to come by holiday period as much as he could, and during this period of time, they traveled to Shakespeare\u2019s former home, visited the\u00a0Eden Project in Cornwall\u00a0and fed black swans at\u00a0Bourton-on-the-Water. Together with Song Yu, Yue Zhishi touched the bricks of ancient castles, and on those very bricks, they touched and caressed each other\u2019s fingers.As they held hands, Yue Zhishi would be so nervous his palm started to sweat \u2014 it was like his body was releasing a sticky fluid trying to attach itself to Song Yu\u2019s hand. As they embraced each other, the pleasant smell on Song Yu\u2019s body would twist around Yue Zhishi\u2019s thoughts, and he would nudge his forehead against the side of Song Yu\u2019s neck without realising, holding back his desire to kiss him. And the palm of Song Yu\u2019s hand \u2014 it would press down and stroke at Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder blades and waist, separated by clothes. Those feelings were so very hard to endure.They ran on the edge of the ocean during bright and cloudless days in their swimming shorts, and when it rained, they wore raincoats over their shirts and took care of little lambs in the pastures permeated with heavy mist.During a night at the height of summer, the cicadas madly chirping, Yue Zhishi sat crosslegged on his bed. The two sets of parents had already fallen asleep. He opened the box he\u2019d pulled out and leafed through Song Yu\u2019s letters to him, as well as the many love poems he\u2019d once copied just to write love letters to Song Yu.A knock suddenly landed on his door, and Yue Zhishi cautiously asked who it was.\u201cMe.\u201d Song Yu was standing at the entrance. \u201cCan I come in?\u201dAs soon as Yue Zhishi heard his voice, he foolishly said\u00a0of course. And so Song Yu, upon entering, saw him frantically hugging a large box before finally giving up on trying to hide it.Song Yu walked over to him. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He came slightly closer to look at it a bit more carefully. \u201cMy letters?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Yue Zhishi nodded.Standing by his bed, Song Yu lowered his head to look at him like a refined gentleman. \u201cWhy are you looking at them now?\u201d\u201cI was thinking of you,\u201d Yue Zhishi honestly said, smiling at him. \u201cAnd then you came over.\u201dSong Yu squeezed his chin, but he didn\u2019t do anything further. Yue Zhishi longed for Song Yu to touch any part of him; his touch created a chain reaction, the tingling sensation travelling from Yue Zhishi\u2019s chin to his fingers and toes.\u201cWhy\u2019d you come over?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked, catching Song Yu\u2019s hand as it pulled away.Song Yu first gazed out at the night outside the balcony before returning back to Yue Zhishi\u2019s glowing eyes. \u201cDo you want to look at the stars?\u201dHis invitation was clearly very ordinary, but Yue Zhishi found it extraordinarily romantic, joyfully agreeing. He put on a shirt and then quietly followed Song Yu downstairs. The two of them lay down on the lawn in the backyard, and the tapered blades of grass lightly scraped at Yue Zhishi\u2019s face and neck, the sensation of it similar to Song Yu\u2019s touch.Stars were exceptionally bright in rural skies. Song Yu pointed at a faintly red star and said, \u201cThat\u2019s Mars.\u201d\u201cThe name describes it well,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, commenting on its Chinese name. He then took the initiative, saying, \u201cI want to know where your constellation is. Scorpius.\u201dSong Yu chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019ll be relatively hard to see with just our naked eyes.\u201d\u201cNever mind, then. I\u2019ve already checked, you really do seem like a Scorpio.\u201d Yue Zhishi listed out all the many characteristics of a Scorpio: mysterious, filled with vitality, strongly possessive.\u201cAnd sexual.\u201d He turned his face around, looking at Song Yu who was lying by his side.Song Yu also gazed at him, quietly watching him for a while. \u201cSo strange.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s strange?\u201dHe reached out a hand to stroke Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. \u201cWhen I\u2019m together with you, I keep finding certain moments very familiar \u2014 as if I\u2019ve experienced them before.\u201dYue Zhishi had felt that way as well, and so he slightly widened his eyes.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a parallel universe.\u201d Yue Zhishi attempted to give him an explanation. \u201cDo you believe in multiple universes? Maybe we also know each other in another universe. Maybe I also confessed to you and said you\u2019re really like a Scorpio\u2026\u201dHe stared up at the sky, feeling even more regretful. \u201cMaybe I grew up together with you in that universe. We would eat dinner together every day and would go to school together. The first person we would see in the morning, as well as the last person we would see before sleeping, would be each other.\u201dSong Yu let out a soft laugh.That would truly be too blissful.In that universe, he would have Yue Zhishi\u2019s childhood years, his vivid and lively adolescence \u2014 as well as his future.Yue Zhishi shifted slightly closer to Song Yu, placing his head onto his shoulder. \u201cI hope the two of us in that universe are also happy.\u201d\u201cThey definitely are.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice was certain.A very mild fragrance came from the hydrangeas, and as he remained lying down, it made Yue Zhishi feel as dizzy as though he\u2019d secretly had some wine. Song Yu suddenly turned over after staying silent for a few moments, his face blocking half of the stars from Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes. Song Yu\u2019s dark pair of eyes looked like a soft abyss.\u201cSay\u2026 The me in that universe and the me right now \u2014 who would kiss you first?\u201dYue Zhishi grabbed at the grass with his fingers, his eyes rounding wide. He could feel himself about to squeeze out a sweet-smelling liquid from how nervous he was; his breathing stuttered, and he almost forgot to breathe.Song Yu\u2019s fingers tugged at Yue Zhishi\u2019s lower lip, the pad of his thumb rubbing against Yue Zhishi\u2019s supple flesh. In a voice filled with coaxing, he asked, \u201cWill you let me win, for once?\u201dYue Zhishi breathed out an\u00a0okay, and then he closed his eyes.His one heart was jumping madly out of his chest; it felt like it wanted to shrink down to the size of a cherry before travelling out of his chest to his throat and then to his tongue, before it was deliriously fed into Song Yu\u2019s mouth \u2014 it wanted to be broken down and ground away by Song Yu\u2019s bright teeth before being swallowed. He would then completely and entirely belong to this person.In the boundless darkness, the grass was roughly pressed down before springing back up again. It was like dying and then coming back to life, the cycle of hope and desire endlessly turning.\u201cI like you, I like you so much.\u201d Yue Zhishi bared his heart and expressed his love towards Song Yu during a brief gap in time; no matter which universe he was in, he believed he would do the same. And for him, Song Yu released his most fiercest possessiveness, needing their flesh and bones tightly entwined.The night cooled, and they shifted from lying down to sitting up. Holding each other\u2019s hand, they slowly strolled around the dark backyard.\u201cYou were showering here.\u201d Song Yu pointed at a hydrangea bush very precisely. \u201cSo beautiful.\u201d\u201cOf course they\u2019re beautiful, I take care of them myself. I also have white avalanche roses.\u201d Yue Zhishi was very proud, and as he spoke, he took Song Yu away. He wanted to take him to see the flowers in the front courtyard \u2014 they were also one of his proudest achievements.\u201cI was talking about you.\u201d It was rare for Song Yu to be so frank. He would forever remember how Yue Zhishi had looked that day as he turned around.\u201cYou were many times better looking than how I\u2019d imagined you being.\u201dIt was very easy for Yue Zhishi to become nervous because of his words. \u201cAll right\u2026\u201d They walked past the house, so Yue Zhishi lowered his voice. \u201cThat means your imagination\u2019s not creative enough.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already quite creative.\u201d Song Yu kneaded his fingers, walking with him to the front yard.Yue Zhishi stood still in front of the bushes of roses and turned his face sideways to look at him. \u201cWhat have you thought about?\u201dSong Yu lightly lifted a brow. \u201cDo you want to hear daytime thoughts or nighttime thoughts?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d This time, he understood Song Yu\u2019s hint very quickly.\u201cYour Chinese\u2019s improved.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dStaring at those snow white roses, Song Yu once again interrupted him. \u201cI heard Uncle Yue say today that before you were born, our parents had an agreement. That if you were a girl, they would marry you to me.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m a guy,\u201d Yue Zhishi stressed.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. In any case, you were already mine when you were just an embryo.\u201d Song Yu smiled and asked Yue Zhishi, \u201cDid you plant these flowers for your own wedding bouquet?\u201d\u201cSong Yu!\u201d Yue Zhishi was a bit agitated from his teasing.But Song Yu steadily, tranquilly stretched out a hand and chose a rose blossomed to its most beautiful moment. He cut it down, removing the thorns on its stem.And then placed it behind Yue Zhishi\u2019s ear.Under the moonlight, the face of his lover was even gentler and more glorious than that full and abundant white avalanche rose. Song Yu kissed his soft cheek, his hands curving around Yue Zhishi\u2019s face as though it was holding a precious treasure. Leaning against his clear and smooth forehead, in a tender voice, Song Yu said \u2014\u201cI love you, Yue Zhishi.\u201d\u201cNo matter what universe we\u2019re in, I love you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH Extra 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayExtra 7: Days of Their Lives (Full Story, End)During the winter break of his fourth year of university, Yue Zhishi received\u00a0UCL\u2019s offer the eve of Lunar New Year after being painfully swamped for over half a year with studying for the IELTS exam and applying for universities at the same time. Song Yu, about to graduate with his master\u2019s degree, received an offer as well. When the good news arrived, Lin Rong both laughed and cried, overjoyed that both her sons were so excellent but upset because they were about to leave her for a while to study overseas.\u201cAunt Rong, if you miss us, just buy a ticket and fly over to see us,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, comforting her. His head was on her shoulder, his arms wrapped around one of hers.\u201cTrue.\u201d Lin Rong\u2019s mind turned on, and she started to plan a European tour for herself with England as its starting point. \u201cI\u2019m going to close the restaurant for half a year and have fun with my girlies. I\u2019ll come back when I\u2019ve had enough.\u201dSong Jin was already very used to Lin Rong not including him in her travel plans. Instead, he thought ruefully of their future university and slipped an arm around Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulders. \u201cSo after so many twists and turns, you\u2019re still ending up in England.\u201d\u201cGege\u2019s supervisor gave him a recommendation for UCL\u2019s geoscience department, and since he\u2019s also written so many papers, there definitely won\u2019t be problem for him to apply for the\u00a0CSC scholarship. UCL\u2019s supervisor was really satisfied with him, and they even joked and said to gege, \u2018our profession is to save the world\u2019.\u201dLin Rong couldn\u2019t help but scoff, \u201cBritish people have the same humour is the same as your brother.\u201dWith an indifferent face, Song Yu said, \u201cMs Lin gave birth well.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha.\u201dTime passed very quickly, the holiday break gone in a flash. After returning back to school, Yue Zhishi busied himself with his graduation thesis, so busy he almost didn\u2019t have time to sleep. The cherry blossom season arrived, and Wuhan U overflowed with people; Yue Zhishi turned in his revised draft and went home that weekend with Song Yu to rest \u2014 just in time to avoid the crowds of people heading in to admire the flowers.Early on Saturday morning at 6:30, Song Yu, who had maintained a habit of exercising in the morning, got out of bed and cleaned up. But when he saw how warm and snuggled up Yue Zhishi looked in the blanket, he couldn\u2019t help but sit back on the bed and look at him.While still sleeping, Yue Zhishi sensed the bed sinking down slightly. He kept his eyes closed and subconsciously stretched out a pale, narrow arm in a daze, groping around, before finally catching Song Yu\u2019s hand. It had been pressing into the mattress; Yue Zhishi very affectionately shifted over. The blanket on his body didn\u2019t follow along, and the shirt of his pyjamas even rode up and revealed his flat and pale lower belly. He leaned his head against Song Yu\u2019s hips, his arms wrapping around Song Yu\u2019s waist.The way he looked made Song Yu think of the hamster he and Yue Zhishi had once seen in a pet store. They\u2019d crouched down to look at it, and the hamster had also clenched his eyes shut like that when sleeping \u2014 his tiny paws had also extended out to move around.Song Yu stroked Yue Zhishi\u2019s arms and nudged away the hair lying on his forehead, the pads of his fingers massaging between Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyebrows before sliding downwards to touch his cheeks and bottom lip. Yue Zhishi fidgeted, feeling a bit ticklish, and then he felt Song Yu\u2019s palm touch his belly and grip onto his waist.He was originally going to push away Song Yu\u2019s hand, but the next moment, Song Yu\u2019s kiss landed onto the side of his neck. After tossing and turning for a while, Yue Zhishi\u2019s face was flushed, and he fuzzily opened his eyes, his arms around Song Yu\u2019s neck.\u201cAre you leaving now?\u201d Yue Zhishi was lightly panting, his voice very soft.\u201cMn. Want to come with me?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want to.\u201d Yue Zhishi was very lazy \u2014 he didn\u2019t like exercising.\u201cThen sleep a bit longer.\u201d Song Yu kissed his forehead. \u201cIs your waist sore?\u201dYue Zhishi stared at him a bit blankly, but then he belatedly turned bashful and pulled the blanket up to cover up his head.Through the blanket, Song Yu heard his mumbled\u00a0it\u2019s fine, as well as\u00a0I\u2019m going to keep sleeping\u00a0\u2014 and so he caressed Yue Zhishi\u2019s head through the blanket before getting up and leaving.He might have said he was going to sleep, but Song Yu\u2019s touching had already taken away all of Yue Zhishi\u2019s drowsiness. He pushed away the blankets after staying inside the nest for a little while, re-fastening his unbuttoned shirt, pulled open the windows to the balcony for some air to come through and then went to clean up.Lin Rong had also woken up very early. Yue Zhishi came down in a woollen sweater and saw her setting out breakfast in the dining room.\u201cLe Le, why are you up so early?\u201d She was holding a plate of\u00a0three delicacies beancurd skin. \u201cCome and eat, I just bought it from that super popular stall. I had to line up for so long. I even saw your brother on my way back, he said he was going to eat near the gym.\u201dYue Zhishi helped her carry over some milk and eggnog, glancing at the living room. \u201cWhere\u2019s Uncle?\u201d\u201cHe left for work at the crack of dawn, he has a contract to sign in the morning.\u201d Placing down the platter of fruit in her hands, Lin Rong sat down at one end of the table, Yue Zhishi on the other side. \u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201dThe two of them ate as they pulled up a sitcom from overseas to watch on the iPad at the table. Many families didn\u2019t allow watching television while eating, but Lin Rong was an exception; not only did she allow it, she also took the lead in watching.\u201cI need to head to Yanghe Qizhe after 10am to get ready for the baby\u2019s one-month celebration party. You guys should come over and eat as well.\u201d Focused on the screen, Lin Rong finished off a piece of green apple. The celebration was for the niece of one of Lin Rong\u2019s good friends; Lin Rong and that friend were very close, and so she\u2019d prepared for a very long time.\u201cOh yes, the housekeeping auntie\u2019s coming over in a bit.\u201d Lin Rong looked at her watch. \u201cShe should be almost here.\u201dTaking a sip of milk, Yue Zhishi suddenly remembered the lube and condoms sitting on top of the bedside table and almost spat out the milk. \u201cThat\u2026 I\u2019ll help gege clean up his room.\u201dLin Rong\u2019s eyes shifted over to Yue Zhishi\u2019s face, and she gave him a cute and meaningful smile. \u201cJust how messy is it.\u201dYue Zhishi immediately waved a hand and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not, it\u2019s really not messy.\u201d\u201cFine, then you can clean it.\u201d Lin Rong knew Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t handle being teased. She ate another piece of beancurd and then said through the food in her mouth, \u201cSince your brother doesn\u2019t like other people touching his stuff anyway. What about your room?\u201d\u201cAuntie can clean it.\u201d\u201cTrue, since your room exists in name only,\u201d Lin Rong laughed.Yue Zhishi\u2019s ears were very red. \u201cNot really\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we turn it into a movie room so you can use it to watch your anime. Or maybe let\u2019s turn it into a dressing room for you and your brother, the two of you don\u2019t even have your own dressing rooms\u2026\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dLin Rong had just finished bringing up suggestions when she said to herself, \u201cNo wait, we still need to leave you a room. If you guys end up fighting, then you\u2019ll still be able to leave him alone and return back to your own room to sleep. Right, Le Le? Actually, you can come over and sleep with me too\u2026\u201dYue Zhishi wanted to both laugh and cry, saying, \u201cIs that considered as returning to the maiden home?\u201dLin Rong immediately clapped. \u201cPrecisely.\u201dAfter cleaning up the table, Yue Zhishi rapidly went back upstairs to Song Yu\u2019s room. The long, floor-length white curtains floated upwards from the gentle breeze of April \u2014 ever since Yue Zhishi moved in, Song Yu had pulled down those heavy black blinds and returned light and clarity to the room.Yue Zhishi pushed those items that could make other people feel awkward into the bedside table\u2019s drawer, folded the blanket and caught sight of Song Yu\u2019s black silk pyjamas lying on the light grey sheets. Song Yu had just changed out of them earlier; even though they were thin and very soft, their buttons were extremely hard to undo.The wind of April was as smooth as water, and the scent of an unknown flower flowed inside with it along with the sunlight of early morning. Yue Zhishi grabbed the clothes and experimentally raised his arms \u2014 like water, the clothes unfurled in his palms. He lowered his head and submerged his face into the cloth.That unique scent on Song Yu\u2019s body, the only one of its kind, filled Yue Zhishi\u2019s nose and his entire body. Yue Zhishi thought of those lingering fingers on his face earlier that morning, those kisses and embraces. He didn\u2019t realise it, but he sat down on that perfectly made bed that didn\u2019t have a single wrinkle \u2014 that was a great taboo, as it would ruin the work he\u2019d just finished, but his thoughts had already been led astray by Song Yu\u2019s scent. It was as though the blood in his entire body was pushing against the current, and in the end, he even fell backwards onto the bed, still breathing in those pyjamas.Yue Zhishi could always ruin things placed in perfect order \u2014 Song Yu\u2019s tidiness, as well as his own.People always said that once affection was gained, it would arc downwards, but Yue Zhishi thought his desire for Song Yu seemed to only grow with each passing day. He suddenly had a strange conviction in his mind: perhaps he used to be a certain part of Song Yu\u2019s body in his previous life, and that was why he felt such a sense of belonging towards Song Yu.A stranger\u2019s voice abruptly came through the door, and it interrupted Yue Zhishi\u2019s fanciful thoughts. He heard Lin Rong greet the housekeeping auntie, and his thoughts cleared up for a moment, remembering why he came back to the room.The pyjamas, the chief culprit to be blamed for his distraction, were ruthlessly folded up and placed onto the cream-coloured small sofa. Heading towards the desk, Yue Zhishi closed his laptop, organised the various kinds of documents and writings he\u2019d left on the table and returned his pens back to the penholder. Song Yu\u2019s desk was once again clean and tidy. Yue Zhishi picked up a National Geographic magazine and walked to the bookcase, putting it with all the other ones.He stood there for a bit, and then Yue Zhishi suddenly realised a very thick book without its outer cover lay on the very top shelf of Song Yu\u2019s bookcase. The inside cover was a light yellow-green colour, and there was no title on the side of the book. Slightly curious, Yue Zhishi took it down; he\u2019d just flipped it open to the title page when he saw a row of handwriting \u2014 it was his own.[Song Yu gege, happy birthday!]Yue Zhishi was able to guess it was from his junior high years, seeing the \u2018gege\u2019 and how his handwriting looked. When he saw the title of the book on the table of contents page \u2014\u00a0You Breathe in the Sun, I Breathe in the Moon (A Selection of\u00a0Anna Akhmatova\u2019s Love Poems)\u00a0\u2014 he couldn\u2019t help but marvel at his own taste back then. His thoughts whirling, he thought he had only been attracted by the name of the book; he hadn\u2019t actually read through it before buying it immediately.Now that he thought about it, sending love poems to Song Yu during puberty really hadn\u2019t been a good idea\u2026He lightly skimmed through the pages, the book falling open at a certain page \u2014 there was a folded piece of paper stuck inside. Yue Zhishi first brought out the paper, and then his gaze paused on the page, on the few sentences Song Yu had underlined.[But I didn\u2019t look after my heart wellSomeone has stolen it away from me][I easily guessed who the thief wasI could see who he was just by his eyesExcept I\u2019m afraid that the heart he stole awayWould be too quickly, too promptly returned back to me.]Song Yu\u2019s black underlining was different from those words brimming with emotion; the line was straight and precise, as proper as himself, and the words didn\u2019t seem like language he would approve of \u2014 except, in a bout of contradiction, he had underlined them.Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart raced simply by reading those lines, and just like the poem, he could hear the sound of \u2018dragonfly wings\u2019 in his chest. The folded piece of paper slipped out of his loose hand and fell onto the floor. Closing the book, Yue Zhishi picked back up the piece of paper folded into a square and opened it.There were no words on the paper, and neither were there any calculation formulas. Instead, there was something even more unfitting of Song Yu\u2019s clean handwriting strokes: many, many drafts of a piece of cheese. The only thing that looked like Song Yu on the paper was the neat and orderly arrangement of each drawing, each attempt next to each other. The first few drawings looked a bit stiff, not quite cute \u2014 the piece of cheese only started to look slightly rounder, cartoon-like, near the end.Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyebrows faintly drew together as he stared at the cheese blocks, thinking they looked very familiar. A few seconds later, he remembered the sketchbook Song Yu had given him so casually upon graduating high school: the logo etched onto the cover had been this piece of cheese.He was somewhat puzzled \u2014 why did Song Yu copy the brand logo so many times? Was it simply because he found it nice-looking?A knock landed on the door, and Yue Zhishi turned around, hearing Lin Rong say, \u201cLe Le, come down and help me change the sofa cover.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Yue Zhishi placed the paper back into the book, returning everything back to their previous positions, and went downstairs to help Lin Rong. They\u2019d just finished changing the cover when Yue Zhishi heard the sound of the front door opening; holding the old sofa cover in his arms to carry into the laundry room, he looked over at the entrance hallway. As expected, he saw Song Yu in a black sweater and a dark blue baseball cap.\u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d Lin Rong stood up. \u201cDid you bring home some yoghurt for me?\u201dSong Yu let out a \u2018mn\u2019, putting the bag in his hand onto the tea table, and asked Yue Zhishi, \u201cSlept enough?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t keep sleeping.\u201d Thinking of how he\u2019d actually done so much work that morning only to be misunderstood, Yue Zhishi was a bit dissatisfied. He started walking towards the laundry room with the sofa cover in his arms, but then Song Yu arrived at the door to the laundry before he did and blocked his way. The laundry was connected to the main balcony, and its entrance was very wide. Yue Zhishi shifted towards the left, and Song Yu followed him, not letting him enter. Yue Zhishi moved towards the right \u2014 so did Song Yu.\u201cSong Yu, you\u2019re so childish,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, tilting up his head to look at him. \u201cYou weren\u2019t this childish even in high school.\u201dAt the sofa, Lin Rong clarified, \u201cWrong. He\u2019s never been this childish since he was born.\u201dThere was a smile curling up the corners of Song Yu\u2019s mough \u2014 he liked the look on Yue Zhishi\u2019s face after being teased, and so he caught Yue Zhishi\u2019s chin and kissed him.That scared Yue Zhishi, worried Lin Rong would see. He pushed at Song Yu, but Song Yu ended up slipping his arms around his waist and saying, \u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep longer even though I gave you the opportunity?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s body was warm, the heat from exercising.\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Yue Zhishi replied.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi pursed his lips and then decided to answer frankly. \u201cIt was your fault, and yet you\u2019re still asking me.\u201dHearing the answer he wanted, Song Yu let Yue Zhishi go, and he even nodded with a bit of approval for himself. \u201cYes, my fault.\u201d He even very considerately set the time on the washing machine and turned it on for Yue Zhishi after he stuffed the sofa cover into it with his ears reddened.Lin Rong came over with the remaining cushion covers, clicking her tongue the entire way. Yue Zhishi\u2019s ears flushed even harder.She told her son to let her through, and then she said, \u201cSong Yu, you know you\u2019re turning more and more indecent, right?\u201d\u201cYou gave birth well,\u201d Song Yu returned.Lin Rong kept shaking her head, attempting to drag Yue Zhishi onto her side of the argument. \u201cLe Le, don\u2019t bother with him. Come, follow me to Yanghe Qizhe.\u201dBut Song Yu unexpectedly said, \u201cI\u2019m taking him out for lunch later, we have plans with friends.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Yue Zhishi had no idea. \u201cWhen did we make plans? With who?\u201d\u201cOrganised this morning.\u201d Song Yu leaned against the washing machine and reached out to tug off Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair tie. His hair drifted down from the small ponytail he\u2019d tied up behind his head, slightly wavy. \u201cI think you\u2019ll be really happy when you see them.\u201d\u201cAll right, then.\u201d Sensing that it was a surprise, Lin Rong shrugged. \u201cRemember to come by Yanghe Qizhe later tonight for the one month celebration.\u201dYue Zhishi followed Song Yu out of the house after changing clothes. He didn\u2019t know where he going nor who he was going to see, and the even stranger thing was \u2014 Song Yu didn\u2019t drive.\u201cAre we eating at a place close by?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not nearby,\u201d Song Yu said. He was holding Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand, and they walked past a crosswalk and entered a subway station, getting onto that pink Line 2 train along with everyone else. There were too many people; Yue Zhishi and Song Yu stood at the carriage doors, leaning very closely to each other.\u201cI\u2019ve taken a photo of you here before,\u201d Song Yu suddenly said.Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes slightly widened, expressing his surprise. \u201cWhen?\u201d\u201cThat time you were following me.\u201d Song Yu studied his face, as though believing Yue Zhishi would\u2019ve definitely forgotten about that unimportant little matter. But to Song Yu, whether it had been the clumsy boy following behind him, the two words of \u2018family member\u2019 he\u2019d blurted out upon checking in or even how Yue Zhishi had fallen asleep on his shoulder \u2014 that day had made him happy for a very long time.Yue Zhishi finally remembered that day, and he even very smartly managed to guess where they were going to eat. \u201cYou\u2019re taking me to that Japanese restaurant?\u201d\u201cAre we seeing\u2026\u201dOnce they were almost at the restaurant, Yue Zhishi confirmed all of his own guesses \u2014 including his guess about who Song Yu had said he would be really happy to see.\u201cYou guys are finally here!\u201d Sitting near the floor to ceiling windows, Xia Zhixu waved a long arm at them, his face bright with a sunny smile so similar to the one many years ago. \u201cHurry up.\u201dYue Zhishi was delighted, and he was even more so when he saw Xu Qichen faintly smiling at him. \u201cSenior Qichen\u2026\u201dSong Yu headed over with an arm around Yue Zhishi, and he sat down across from Xia Zhixu and Xu Qichen. \u201cHave you guys ordered?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Xia Zhixu\u2019s tiger teeth peeped out of his smile. \u201cThe same order as last time. What do you think, my memory\u2019s not bad, right.\u201dHearing this, the first person to laugh was Xu Qichen; he was very willing to indulge Xia Zhixu. When Yue Zhishi saw amusement over his quiet and still face, he inexplicably felt relieved. He truly hoped the things in the past could remain in the past \u2014 he truly hoped Xu Qichen wouldn\u2019t be caged within those people\u2019s words.\u201cI ordered an extra portion of ice cream for you,\u201d Xu Qichen said, passing over a cup of tea to Yue Zhishi.\u201cThank you, senior.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes rose from Xu Qichen and landed on Xia Zhixu, and he blinked. Extremely straightforwardly, he asked, \u201cSo senior, you guys are together now, right?\u201dXia Zhixu had been sipping his tea. He choked at Yue Zhishi\u2019s question, coughing, and patted himself on the chest.Song Yu flatly said, \u201cAre you a high school student?\u201dWith his ears tinged with red, Xu Qichen glanced at Xia Zhixu, amused.\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d Xia Zhixu jerked his chin at Yue Zhishi. \u201cSong Yu told you?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s chin was propped on a hand. \u201cI guessed. I had a feeling last time, but it wasn\u2019t very obvious. I thought about you guys afterwards, and then the more I thought, the more I felt like you guys mutually liked each other.\u201d\u201cSo amazing\u2026\u201d Xia Zhixu shook his head.Song Yu gave Yue Zhishi a piece of sushi. \u201cYes, more amazing than you.\u201d\u201cDamned younger brother-con.\u201dFeeling as though Xia Zhixu was the only person around the table who didn\u2019t know about him and Song Yu, Yue Zhishi told him kindly and candidly, \u201cI\u2019m his boyfriend now.\u201dXia Zhixu choked again, and he wrenched his head over to look at Xu Qichen, only to see him with an innocent look on his face. Xu Qichen leisurely said, \u201cOh, right. I still haven\u2019t told you about them\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen??\u201d Xia Zhixu was in disbelief.\u201cDuring\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi took some time to think about it, and the long amount of time he took to remember gave Xia Zhixu an even stronger blow.\u201cDuring my first year of university.\u201dXu Qichen nodded. \u201cAround Christmas.\u201d\u201cYou knew?\u201d Xia Zhixu thought Xu Qichen had been extremely withdrawn during university and had refused to listen to anything outside his two ears.\u201cMm.\u201d Xu Qichen took a bite of his daifuku. \u201cThe whole school knew.\u201dXia Zhixu now truly did turn depressed. \u201cSong Yu, worthy of being you.\u201d\u201cSuch flattering.\u201d Song Yu gave him the last piece of sushi with benevolence.The two of them kept needling at each other as they ate and continued talking, sharing with the other what they\u2019d missed out on during the past few years. Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but compare Xia Zhixu today with the shining image he\u2019d given out during high school, and he kept feeling as though Xia Zhixu had lost weight. His voice had also deepened much more compared to before. And yet the emotions flowing between him and Xu Qichen didn\u2019t seem to have changed: they were blooming, as clean as a first love.Just as before, their hands resting on the table occasionally brushed against each other, but this time, they didn\u2019t pretend as though nothing had happened and shift slightly away. Instead, as Xia Zhixu continued talking with Song Yu, he subconsciously covered Xu Qichen\u2019s hand with his own and held onto him.\u201cSo you guys are going to UCL together?\u201d Xia Zhixu gave Xu Qichen a piece of tempura. \u201cNot bad, a\u00a0G5 school.\u201dYue Zhishi couldn\u2019t hold back from saying, \u201cBut you\u2019re more amazing, you already have your own start-up company.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just some games,\u201d Xia Zhixu modestly chuckled.Song Yu raised an eyebrow. \u201cLuckily you know how to make games.\u201d\u201cI suspect you\u2019re making fun of me.\u201d Xia Zhixu pointed at him.\u201cBe a bit more confident in your guesses.\u201dThe lunch lasted two hours, and Song Yu was the one to pay this time around. The restaurant was a bit packed, so Yue Zhishi waited at the entrance with Xu Qichen \u2014 the afternoon sun was particularly comfortable, and it was warm and gentle as it landed on his body.\u201cLe Le.\u201d Xu Qichen took the initiative to speak to him. \u201cWhen you first got into Wuhan U, I originally wanted to give you something. But I wasn\u2019t in the greatest condition during that time, and I didn\u2019t end up giving it to you because I thought you wouldn\u2019t want it either.\u201d\u201cI want it,\u201d Yue Zhishi blurted out, his eyes sincere as he looked at Xu Qichen.Xu Qichen smiled, his voice gentle. \u201cI just happen to need to visit the university next week. I\u2019ll bring it along for you \u2014 it\u2019s a book.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know where the urge came from, but he directly went forward and hugged him. \u201cThank you.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if he was grateful because Xu Qichen, during his most trying times, had remembered someone he\u2019d only met once over a meal, or if he was grateful Xu Qichen had been able to walk out of his cage himself \u2014 and then reunite with Xia Zhixu.It was as though Xu Qichen silently understood his embrace, and he patted Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m doing well, now.\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Yue Zhishi retreated slightly. \u201cI can tell. I\u2019m glad, even though your ending came a bit late.\u201dXu Qichen gazed at him, and then he looked out at the cars endlessly streaming past them. \u201cIt\u2019s not late.\u201dHis voice was tender. \u201cAs long as we can start over, it would never be late. I would be satisfied no matter when.\u201dXia Zhixu called out to Xu Qichen from far away, and he slipped an arm around Xu Qichen\u2019s shoulders when he arrived. Song Yu also came to stand next to Yue Zhishi \u2014 and they planned to say goodbye just as they did last time.\u201cSee you next time.\u201dXia Zhixu suddenly remembered something and said, \u201cOh yeah, I just remembered.\u201d He said to Song Yu, \u201cYou must\u2019ve made that notebook for Le Le, right? The one you made with me.\u201dYue Zhishi tilted his head. \u201cNotebook?\u201dXu Qichen also turned to look doubtfully at Xia Zhixu.Song Yu, who had always been the winner between Xia Zhixu and him, finally lost his arrogance. \u201cShut up, you.\u201d\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t tell me you still haven\u2019t given it out?\u201d It was as if Xia Zhixu finally had something to tease Song Yu with. \u201cLe Le, your brother made a sketchbook for you that time he went with me to Beijing. He made it so carefully, and he almost injured his hand\u2026\u201d Xia Zhixu only stopped talking under Song Yu\u2019s threats of plugging up his mouth.\u201cYou mean you made one too?\u201d Xu Qichen very keenly caught onto the main point.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Xia Zhixu was stricken \u2014 he\u2019d been so focused on messing with Song Yu that he forgot he himself had yet to give his out. \u201cThat\u2026 You\u2019ll find out when we get back.\u201dSong Yu and Xia Zhixu, who\u2019d both had their wings clipped during their third year of high school, now departed \u2014 each holding onto his own lover.When Yue Zhishi thought back about that piece of paper covered in cheese drawings, all of the clues instantly linked up together.That hadn\u2019t been some brand\u2019s logo at all.\u201cYou etched that block of cheese, didn\u2019t you?\u201dSong Yu stopped acting so awkward after they entered the subway station, and he admitted it somewhat calmly. \u201cMn. Xia Zhixu, that stupid guy, refused to leave without making a souvenir so I followed along and made a sketchbook as well. And then he ended up losing his phone in Beijing.\u201d\u201cThat cheese\u2026\u201d Song Yu paused. \u201cI drew it back then, when I had nothing else to do.\u201dThat final sentence gave Yue Zhishi a peculiar feeling.\u201cWas it because my name\u2019s pronounced really similarly to \u2018cheese\u2019?\u201dSong Yu stared at his eyes, as though not happy about how Yue Zhishi always asked him such candid questions. He only hummed in agreement after a little while passed.In this moment, Yue Zhishi finally knew: it hadn\u2019t only been him who had done something so foolish as writing Song Yu\u2019s name again and again during his early teenage years. Song Yu had also done something similar \u2014 he had simply just hidden it better, hiding it behind a lot more defences.And no wonder. Yue Zhishi had received his second sketchbook only after Song Yu had returned from a conference in Beijing. Those sketchbooks Yue Zhishi had treasured \u2014 Song Yu hadn\u2019t given them to him casually; they were something Song Yu had personally made, had etched his drawing onto their leather covers by hand.And yet he hadn\u2019t said anything. Suddenly, Yue Zhishi was thankful he cherished everything Song Yu had given him. If he\u2019d carelessly lost or wasted those sketchbooks, he would most likely be extremely, extremely upset at trampling on Song Yu\u2019s heart now that he\u2019d learned the truth.\u201cYou keep not telling me things.\u201d Yue Zhishi held onto his hand. \u201cDo you still have a lot of things you haven\u2019t told me?\u201dThey\u2019d already arrived at Yanghe Qizhe\u2019s small alleyway as they spoke. At first, Song Yu didn\u2019t reply, but later, he lowered his head and said, \u201cMn.\u201d\u201cTell me,\u201d Yue Zhishi wheedled, hugging his arm.Except Song Yu laughed softly. \u201cThere are too many.\u201d\u201cI want to listen to them all. You can tell me one thing every night before bed, like a bedtime story. Okay?\u201dPushing open the restaurant door, Song Yu gently consented. \u201cOkay.\u201dYanghe Qizhe had been decorated by fresh flowers, and for a moment, it brought Yue Zhishi back to that time they\u2019d prepared it for a wedding. But the flowers this time were richer in colour, and there were also many large toys children liked to play with \u2014 as well as lego blocks and a\u00a0croquembouche\u00a0almost as tall as a person.\u201cSo lively.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201d Lin Rong placed a balloon to the side, having finished blowing it up.\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d Yue Zhishi ran to help her with the balloons, only to have his first one explode in his face; he scared himself and stood there in astonishment.Standing not too far away, Song Yu froze at first as well, but then he chuckled at Yue Zhishi\u2019s reaction \u2014 he found him more adorable the more he thought about it.\u201cGo to the kitchen and try the soup!\u201d Song Yu had yet to stop working, and Lin Rong urged him away to the kitchen. \u201cOh yes, give your dad a call and remind him to come. He needs to make a speech, so tell him to remember to draft one up!\u201dYue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cSuch an occasion.\u201d\u201cBut of course, it\u2019s the first grandchild for my best friend\u2019s family. She also really likes her niece, they\u2019re as close as mother and daughter. Having a new baby in the family is an extremely joyous occasion.\u201dSeeing the cute photos attached onto the wall, Yue Zhishi\u2019s thoughts started to wander. He grabbed another balloon and said, \u201cAunt Rong, you\u2026\u201dLin Rong seemed to read his mind, crisply and plainly telling him, \u201cI don\u2019t want a grandchild.\u201dYue Zhishi laughed, in spite of himself. \u201cI haven\u2019t even said anything yet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same whether you say it or not, darling.\u201d Lin Rong hugged his shoulders, looking at the photos on the wall with him. \u201cLittle children really are cute, but teaching them and taking care of them require a lot of effort. I\u2019ve managed to raise you two to adults, and so I\u2019ve already enjoyed enough the joys of being a mother. Now that you two are grown up, I want to do some things for myself while I still have the energy and desire to do so. My value shouldn\u2019t lie only in being a mother \u2014 I want to be myself too, and not just someone\u2019s mother. Do you understand that?\u201dYue Zhishi nodded and hugged Lin Rong. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard.\u201dHe leaned into the hollow of Lin Rong\u2019s shoulder. After saying quiet for a few moments, he used a very soft, almost tentative, voice to say for the first time, \u201cMom, thank you.\u201dThey\u2019d been joking around just a few moments ago \u2014 but now, at that title, Lin Rong\u2019s nose started to sting, her eyes turning red.She also returned Yue Zhishi\u2019s hug, and she stroked up and down his back. \u201cSo\u2026\u201dSomewhat childishly, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to call me mom anyway. Hmph, and Song Jin keeps stopping you. Call me by that name again in front of his face later, you hear me?\u201d\u201cI hear you, Mom.\u201d Yue Zhishi laughed, nodding very obediently in her arms.Lin Rong then added, \u201cDon\u2019t call him dad yet.\u201dYue Zhishi couldn\u2019t stop laughing. \u201cAll right.\u201dGuests started to pour in, more and more people gathering in Yanghe Qizhe\u2019s front courtyard. It was still not yet time for dinner. After finishing with the balloons, Yue Zhishi went around, searching for Song Yu. He looked into each private room and travelled all the way to the one at the very back, sliding open the door; he saw Song Yu in Yanghe Qizhe\u2019s secret backyard. He was sitting peacefully on the bench underneath the cherry blossom tree, and without a single word, he lifted his eyes and gazed at Yue Zhishi.Their whole family of four had transplanted that\u00a0weeping cherry blossom tree\u00a0to the backyard when Yue Zhishi had been ten years old. It had grown much larger now, its snow white cherry blossoms studded all over those drooping branches. Under the breeze of early April, those blossoms lightly swayed \u2014 a rain of flowers, snow in colour, drifted downwards in flowing sheets. The orange rays of dusk fell onto that cold-looking tree, and it looked like it was set on fire.And Song Yu, sitting under that tree, was extraordinarily pure and elegant. His face was serene, and the setting sun reflected a tinge of that always so hard to see tenderness on his face.He stretched out a hand towards Yue Zhishi, who walked towards him and gripped onto his fingers. \u201cYou really know how to hide away.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t respond, but he pulled lightly at Yue Zhishi, tugging him into his arms and having him sit on top of his legs. He wrapped his arms around Yue Zhishi, and kissed the side of his neck.\u201cI called Aunt Rong \u2018mom\u2019 just then.\u201d Yue Zhishi was looking at Song Yu and, noticing a cherry blossom fallen onto his head, reached out to gently pluck it down. Twirling it in his hand, he continued, \u201cShe was really happy.\u201dSong Yu let out a \u2018mn\u2019 and said, \u201cShe\u2019d wanted it for a very long time. She just didn\u2019t say it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really similar to her in that sense.\u201d Yue Zhishi curled his arms around Song Yu\u2019s neck, giving him a sweet yet pure smile.Looking at his face, Song Yu was lost in his thoughts \u2014 but he was very quickly pulled back out by Yue Zhishi\u2019s light kiss on his lips.\u201cI had a dream last night,\u201d he softly said, holding onto Yue Zhishi.Yue Zhishi, still yet to let go of that blossom, swept its soft petals over Song Yu\u2019s face. \u201cWhat did you dream about?\u201d\u201cI dreamed that\u2026 your parents didn\u2019t die, and you grew up in England. You were a very loved child.\u201d\u201cAnd then?\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand paused. He seemed to only care about one thing. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d\u201cI was here, but I think I went to look for you and saw you after you grew up.\u201d There was a faraway look in Song Yu\u2019s eyes as he recalled what he\u2019d dreamed. \u201cI also remember seeing an ocean and white cliffs.\u201d His mouth curved slightly. \u201cWe were also together.\u201dYue Zhishi knocked his forehead with his own. \u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really remember. I remember us lying on grass together, as well as an endless, happy summer.\u201dIt sounded like a beautiful dream. Yue Zhishi focused on Song Yu\u2019s face, and then with a completely serious face, he said, \u201cSong Yu, you must really like me to have a dream like that.\u201dSong Yu was amused by his serious expression, and he pinched his face. \u201cYou only know that now?\u201dAnd then, the amusement on his face faded slightly. He hugged Yue Zhishi and asked, \u201cBaobao, do you think \u2014 if you had your parents and happily grew up like you did in my dream \u2014 would you be less\u2026\u201d he paused, carefully considering his words, \u201c\u2026less regretful.\u201dYue Zhishi quieted, getting up to change his sitting position. He switched to straddling over Song Yu\u2019s body, facing each other, and called out gege. His amber eyes were sincere and transparent. \u201cI don\u2019t feel regretful at all.\u201dHis voice was very quiet. \u201cI have no way of comparing myself with a hypothetical me. Of course, I\u2019ve thought about how I\u2019d be like if my parents were still alive, if I would be happier than now. But honestly, it\u2019s already such a wonderful thing to have Aunt Rong and Uncle Song in their roles as my parents. I can\u2019t imagine anyone else better than them in the entire world.\u201dHe pressed against Song Yu\u2019s forehead as he spoke. \u201cBesides, there\u2019s you, too. Being able to grow up together with you \u2014 that\u2019s the luckiest thing I can ever have in my life.\u201dSong Yu reached up and stroked Yue Zhishi\u2019s soft hair.\u201cI don\u2019t think that dream\u2019s all that glorious, and I don\u2019t want it either, because the me in that dream would\u2019ve missed your best childhood and adolescent years. Perhaps I would have your future, but the feelings between us wouldn\u2019t be so deep. From when you were three to your current twenty two years \u2014 every day I\u2019ve spent with you has been the most precious gift I\u2019ve ever received.\u201dSong Yu lowered his eyes before looking back at him, his arms tightening.\u201cI also have no way to imagine you not growing up by my side. So I keep thinking I\u2019m very cruel \u2014 if I had to choose again, I would still choose for you to arrive to me at three years old.\u201d\u201cNot cruel at all.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s arms overlapped behind Song Yu\u2019s head, and he spoke tenderly. \u201cThe other side of regret is a perfect ending.\u201dThey heard the sound of the door sliding open as they spoke, and they looked over, seeing Song Jin standing by the door. All three of them were stunned.\u201cWhy are you just standing there?\u201d Lin Rong had also come over, and when she saw them hugging each other underneath the cherry blossom tree, there was an unsurprised look on her face. \u201cTime to eat.\u201d Turning around, she even smacked Song Jin, who was frozen where he stood. \u201cAnd you, what are you so surprised about. You have your draft speech?\u201d\u201cYes. Have a look.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d Lin Rong threw a look over, holding open the door. \u201cThe two of you stop clinging onto each other, come and eat.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Song Yu helplessly shook his head, and he also knocked Yue Zhishi\u2019s forehead with his own.Yue Zhishi let out a laugh \u2014 he stood up, shaking off the flowers on his body, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hearing Aunt Rong downstairs calling him, Yue Zhishi hurriedly responded, and the cat once again walked across his stomach before agilely jumping off. He quickly washed up and changed before grabbing his schoolbag and running out.\u201cThe alarm clock didn\u2019t ring?\u201d Lin Rong calmly rinsed out a milk bottle, \u201cHurry and have breakfast. Yesterday\u2019s braised beef mince mixed with rice noodles, it\u2019s pretty good.\u201dAt this time, Yue Zhishi had already rushed to the entryway. There was no time to worry about breakfast.\u201cI didn\u2019t have morning study before the opening ceremony so I forgot to set the new time. Aunt Rong, where\u2019s Song Yu gege?\u201dA little Pomeranian followed closely behind and obediently sat on the ground watching him change shoes.\u201cYour brother left already. Isn\u2019t it the opening ceremony today? It seems that he is on duty today. Do third year senior high school students still need to do that?\u201d Lin Rong placed the bottle back and turned around while drying her hands, \u201cThe opening ceremony for the junior high school department should be together with the high school department\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhen Yue Zhishi turned around and opened the door, the Pomeranian started to frantically scratch at his leg to prevent him from leaving.Lin Rong hurriedly called out after him, \u201cLe Le! You can\u2019t skip breakfast!\u201dYue Zhishi knelt down to rub the dog\u2019s head and then gave it a kiss before leaving in a hurry, \u201cI\u2019ll buy some rice cakes. Bye Aunt Rong~\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t just eat anything!\u201dLeaving the house, Yue Zhishi rode his bicycle straight to the breakfast stall outside the community. The granny who usually sold rice cakes there wasn\u2019t around today. Yue Zhishi had heard her talk about her back pain before so she was probably taking a few days off. The noodle soup store next door however was very fragrant, and you could smell the scent of the stewed beef from far away.\u201cLe Le, is it still early? Come and have some noodles.\u201d The owner of the beef noodle soup store lowered a ladle of rice noodles into the hot soup, the silken strands flirting in and out amidst the other soup ingredients.\u201cI\u2019m going to be late Uncle Chen. I\u2019ll have it tomorrow!\u201d Yue Zhishi parked his bike and ran into the convenience store. With no time to choose, he quickly grabbed a bag of rice bread, paid for it and ran back out. This was one of the few snacks in the convenience store Yue Zhishi could eat.It had rained all night last night. The rain in this city had always not been very gentle and would always be accompanied by lightning and thunder, making him unable to sleep at night. He remembered that it was also raining heavily the first night he spent at Song Yu\u2019s place. As soon as the thunder crashed, he was scared to tears and had rushed straight into Song Yu\u2019s room, climbing into his bed.Please read this from kk translatesSince then, he instinctively began to rely on this brother who had no blood relations to him.Yue Zhishi\u2019s father, Yue Yi, and Song Yu\u2019s father, Song Jin, were close friends who had grown up together.The Yue old man had unfortunately passed away at a young age. Before moving to the UK, Yue Yi was practically a non-official member of the Song family, always eating together and living together. Yue Yi loved extreme sports. While rock climbing, he met a British girl called Olivia and the two fell in love and eventually gave birth to the lovely Yue Zhishi. Their happy times however didn\u2019t last long. Eleven years ago, the couple encountered an avalanche while skiing in the Alps and unfortunately both didn\u2019t make it.In just one night, Yue Zhishi had lost both his parents. Even Song Jin who flew to the UK to pick him up didn\u2019t know how to explain this to a three-year-old child.At that time, Yue Zhishi was holding onto Song Jin\u2019s sleeve and would only sweetly call him uncle. (KKnotes: Uncle in English) He didn\u2019t know what death meant or what foster care was. He was taken back to the Song family and since then settled in Jiang City.The red light at the intersection forced Yue Zhishi to come to a stop. He had woken up too suddenly this morning and was still a little lightheaded right now. He stared at the red light ahead as his thoughts jumped from one thing to another. There were only remnants left of dream he had last night. He seemed to have turned into small thing and would constantly follow Song Yu around everywhere. Because his Chinese wasn\u2019t very good, he could only stick close to him.Lin Rong would always tease Yue Zhishi with a jealous tone, saying that the first Chinese word he had learnt was actually gege.\u00a0(KKnotes: gege = brother)But Song Yu didn\u2019t like to speak much and was lukewarm to anyone. Fortunately, even though he didn\u2019t talk to Yue Zhishi much, he didn\u2019t drive him away and just allowed him to pester him. Only when they got older and started elementary school did Yue Zhishi\u2019s mixed-race appearance become more eye catching.Song Yu was already eye catching enough and with another doll-like child following him around, they basically became the topic everyone gossiped about, especially regarding their family affairs. After a while, Song Yu lost patience. When they moved to a new place and left the community and their elementary school classmates, he set up three rules.\u2013 Don\u2019t call me gege outside.\u2013 Don\u2019t go to school or go home together with me.\u2013 Don\u2019t let others know that you live with me.At first, Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t accept this. Song Yu leaving and moving on to junior high school was already a huge blow for him, not to mention the fact that he couldn\u2019t call him gege. He however had always been guided by Song Yu in life and was taught that rules come first. In any case, rather than being completely ignored, keeping a distance outside seemed more acceptable.In Yue Zhishi\u2019s mind, Song Yu was always like a goal or target for him to chase after. When Song Yu was six and he was three, he stumbled after his brother to watch the ants carry their food home. When Song Yu was ten and he was seven, he who could finally attend elementary school with his brother for the first time was so happy, he started singing but his mouth was soon covered up. When Song Yu was fifteen and he was twelve, the old man selling ice cream gave him a bench so that he could sit and wait for his brother to leave the examination centre. He still remembered that he ate three popsicles that day. Song Yu didn\u2019t realise this and even gave up taking the school bus for him to take a taxi to eat crayfish.The crayfish were very big that day. He ate twenty-three of them, fifteen of which were peeled by Song Yu because he peeled them too slowly. He remembered himself retorting, \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know how to peel them, I am very good at hiding. None of your classmates saw me, did they?\u201dSong Yu disagreed, \u201cBut I found you with one glance so you\u2019re not very good at hiding.\u201dYue Zhishi always insisted that he was good at hiding, including his relationship with Song Yu to the outside world. Later he had to admit that Song Yu was right.\u201cThe light is green, let\u2019s go.\u201dA voice interrupted his thoughts. He glanced at the time and then started to accelerate. He arched his thin body and pedalled hard. It was the beginning of September and the wind was still warm. The wind caused his summer uniform to billow out and Yue Zhishi\u2019s slightly curly brown hair glowed golden in the sun, looking fluffy and soft.He rushed all the way to school. Just as he parked his bicycle and saw the large army at the gate, he felt like he had forgotten something.\u201cLe Le!\u201d His shoulder was suddenly slapped. Yue Zhishi turned around, startled. It was his close friend and desk mate, Jiang Yufan.Yue Zhishi\u2019s surname was special and many people would pronounce it as the Le in happiness rather than the Yue in music. After this mistake was made numerous times, it eventually resulted in a nickname \u2014\u2013 Le Le. Not only family members, classmates and friends who are close also call him this.\u00a0(KKnotes: The character \u4e50 in Yue Zhishi\u2019s name can be pronounced as Le or Yue)After succeeding in scaring his friend, Jiang Yufan\u2019s expression was smug. He rubbed his buzzcut head which had been forcefully shaved short by his mother, \u201cWhy are you also getting to school last minute?\u201d\u201cSlept in.\u201d Yue Zhishi dragged Jiang Yufan through the school gates, \u201cThere are so many people at the gates.\u201dThe old god Jiang Yufan nodded with understanding, \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have morning studies, it easier it is to be late.\u201d In the distance was a student on duty wearing an armband. He checked the uniform and along the way glanced at Yue Zhishi.\u201cHey, wait.\u201d Jiang Yufan grabbed him, \u201cYue, where\u2019s your name badge?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s fast footsteps immediately stopped. He touched his chest. It was completely empty.\u201cOh no. Aunt Rong removes it every time my clothes are washed. I was in a hurry today and forgot to put it on.\u201d\u201cWhat to do then?\u201d Jiang Yufan tiptoed and looked in the distance, \u201cAh shit, Compass is also there.\u201dCompass was the nickname for their junior high school director. Because he was tall and thin and very meticulous, everyone called him that.Yue Zhishi was even more anxious. Compass was known for enforcing school rules and would even report on girls who have modified their skirts or uniforms. Since today was also the school\u2019s opening ceremony, there was a high chance of him being punished.He pulled at the strap of his schoolbag and tried to hide it, \u201cJiang Yufan, you cover for me.\u201d\u201cOkay. Who knows, we might even be successful.\u201dJiang Yufan covered half his body and the two moved quickly to the school gate like conjoined twins in attempt to quickly bypass the group of students who were being checked.Compass\u2019s voice was very sharp, \u201cPull out the uniform collar. There will be filming at the opening ceremony later to share on the school\u2019s official website. Your appearance is our school\u2019s image, understand?\u201dYue Zhishi clutched his bag strap tightly and walked ahead while sticking closely to Jiang Yufan.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with your pants?\u201d\u201cTeacher, my school pants aren\u2019t dry yet, so I wore a pair that\u2019s similar\u2026.\u201d\u201cAre two school pants not enough for you?!\u201dPlease support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogYue Zhishi lowered his head even further. He had already prepared his words of apology if he was to be caught.\u201cStop there.\u201dHe was so frightened he stopped in place, frozen like a terrified rabbit. His steps had stopped but he still didn\u2019t dare raise his head.Not me, it mustn\u2019t be me.\u201cI\u2019m talking to you.\u201dCompass approached a little closer and the student on duty in charge of taking names down closely behind him, \u201cThe girl with the short hair. Where\u2019s your name badge? Which class?\u201dYue Zhishi breathed a sigh of relief. He then heard Compass say, \u201cI have said countless times that you must wear your name badge when you go to school. Is it that difficult? Who else doesn\u2019t have it?\u201dMe.Yue Zhishi was completely stiff. He felt like a hand would suddenly appear and pull him out of the crowd, bringing him before Compass.At the moment when he was most nervous, his arm really was grabbed. His heart stopped and Yue Zhishi subconsciously apologised, \u201cSorry\u2026..\u201dBut the next second, that hand moved down his arm, grabbing his hand. Soon afterwards, his fingers were pried open and a metal name badge which still carried some warmth was stuffed in.It may sound strange but Yue Zhishi knew who it was just from the hand. He looked up and, as expected, he was met with a familiar, calm face.The other party was wearing a high school uniform with a red arm band. Under the direct sunlight, his brows were slightly furrowed.It wasn\u2019t anyone else but the \u2018brother\u2019 he shared the same roof with.Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes widened slightly, his light-coloured eyes resembling transparent amber beads in the sun. Seeing Song Yu, he felt as if there was a layer of electricity all over his body. He subconsciously wanted to say something but the next moment, he quickly swallowed the word \u2018gege\u2019 back down.Their gazes met briefly before Song Yu let go and looked away with his usual calmness and indifference. It was as if the relationship between them really was just that of a senior on duty and an offending student. Song Yu glanced at his watch and took out a pen from his pocket, getting ready to note students down for being late.Everyone\u2019s attention was still on Compass and the girl being scolded, and no one noticed this secret exchange. Yue Zhishi looked down at the name badge in his hand which was engraved with the words [Peiya Junior High Schoo, Yue Zhishi]. Before Compass could catch him, he quickly pinned it to his shirt.As soon as he lowered his hand, he saw a pair of shrewd eyes scanning him. Yue Zhishi raised his head and smiled back at Compass. He was born with a pair of innocent and pure puppy eyes. Although appearances cannot give you a free pass in life, that beautiful face of his made it hard for others to be harsh to him.\u201cYou\u2019re almost late.\u201d Even so, Compass still gave a warning, \u201cGo on in.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Yue Zhishi nodded obediently, \u201cThank you director.\u201dThe school clock tower just happened to sound at this moment. He couldn\u2019t help but turn his head to look back. Song Yu was like the characters you would find in comics and he practically glowed even while standing amidst the crowd.There wasn\u2019t much time left. The whole class must gather in the classroom first before going to the opening ceremony. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want to be late, so he ran desperately to class. Jiang Yufan however was concerned about something else, \u201cHey Yue Zhishi stop right there! I saw it just now!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to be late!\u201d Yue Zhishi was of breath and his heart was beating extremely fast.Jiang Yufan was also out of breath from chasing after him, \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026.Don\u2019t change the subject. Tell me honestly. Why does Song Yu have your name badge?\u201dThe author has something to say:Song Yu: Because I am his brother (not blood related!)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He followed Yue Zhishi to the second floor of the junior high school building and continued asking, \u201cEven if he picked it up, how would he know that you\u2019re Yue Zhishi?\u201dYue Zhishi asked back, \u201cAm I not recognisable enough?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026\u2026\u201d With that mixed face, Yue Zhishi was a popular topic of discussion when he first came. Jiang Yufan however felt that it was strange, \u201cI was scared to death just now. When I saw Song Yu wearing that arm band, I thought you were finished.\u201dYue Zhishi leaned against the handrail to catch his breath, \u201cSo extreme?\u201d\u201cWhy not? Breaking the rules on the first day back to school and even running into the cold and aloof Song Yu who is on duty. When he grabbed you, I thought he was going to reprimand you on the spot.\u201dAlmost reaching their classroom, Yue Zhishi turned and shushed him before quickly walking in.It was very good timing. At this moment, the class leader was calling attendance. Yue Zhishi tried his best to hide his heavy breathing and stood at the door with his hair slightly curled up from the running, \u201cTeacher\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe head teacher Wang Qian was a young male teacher in charge of teaching Chinese. He got along with the students well but also wouldn\u2019t hesitate to be strict when necessary. Fortunately, Yue Zhishi had always had a good student reputation and his grades were also good so Teacher Wang didn\u2019t make it difficult for him, \u201cCome in.\u201dBut Jiang Yufan was not so lucky.Wang Qian had a playful smile on his face, \u201cWhy, isn\u2019t this our class\u2019s regularly late guest?\u201d\u201cTeacher Wang,\u201d Jiang Yufan rubbed his head, \u201cI was only later than Yue Zhishi by two steps.\u201d\u201cYes, and I think this standard is pretty good.\u201d Wang Qian raised his hand, \u201cFrom today onwards, you are only allowed to be two steps later than your desk mate or you will stand for the entire morning study session.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Jiang Yufan\u2019s scrunched up his face as the rest of the students in class 8 laughed.\u201cWhat are you huh\u2019ing for? Get in.\u201d When Wang Qian was done saying this, he began knock some senses into the other students, \u201cSmall matters are fine, but you better be good during the opening ceremony. If you\u2019re caught by the director, I won\u2019t be able to save you. After being publicly sentenced, you will make a name for yourself before you even enter senior high. I guess that can be a way to make sure you didn\u2019t attend junior high school for nothing.\u201dEveryone secretly laughed. Only Yue Zhishi who still hadn\u2019t recovered running earlier was in a state of confusion as he tried to stuff his bag under his table. No matter how he tried, it just didn\u2019t go in. He eventually reached in and pulled out a delicate royal blue gift box.Strange. He took a closer look.\u201cWho gave it to you this time? How great, already getting a gift on the first day back to school.\u201d Jiang Yufen whispered from his table, \u201cIt\u2019s nice being handsome.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d Yue Zhishi raised his head and glanced at Wang Qian before opening the gift box. Inside was a exquisite white pen and a bottle of ink and there was also a card. He didn\u2019t touch the pen and just opened the card to read the contents before putting it back under his table.The gossipy Jiang Yufan shuffled over, \u201cWhich class? That pen doesn\u2019t look cheap.\u201dYue Zhishi pursed his lips and seemed to be in thought.\u201cWe don\u2019t disband and go home right after the opening ceremony, right?\u201d\u201cYeah, we probably have to go back to the classroom. Why?\u201d\u201cI want to go to class 11 and return this.\u201dEveryone in class had stood up and was ready to go to the school auditorium. Jiang Yufan didn\u2019t understand the Yue Zhishi\u2019s honest act of returning a gift, \u201cAre you serious Le Le? You\u2019ll hurt the girl\u2019s feelings.\u201dYue Zhishi was a little hungry. He opened his bag, pulled out a rice bread from inside, tore it open and ate half in one bite. He spoke a little muffled, \u201cIf I don\u2019t return it, she might think I agreed but I haven\u2019t so it\u2019s wrong to do that. And right now, I\u2019m only in third year of middle school. I shouldn\u2019t be dating.\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesJiang Yufan was incredulous, \u201cMy heavens, where did this obedient baby come from? That guy in the class next door has already changed girlfriends three times last semester. Forget it, you wouldn\u2019t be able to understand what it feels like to be heartbroken.\u201dHeartbroken.It was true that Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t understand it but he weighed up the seriousness of being heartbroken or being deceived and firmly made up his mind.\u201cI will tell her properly.\u201d Yue Zhishi quickly swallowed the bread in his mouth and stood up with the other students. From his bag fell out a medicine box which looked brand new. He bent over to pick it up and tried to put it in his pocket, but the pockets of the school pants were too small to fit. He then tried to tear open the packaging, but the quality of the plastic packaging was just too good.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d Jiang Yufan tugged him.\u201cOh, okay.\u201dThe entire school swarmed into the auditorium. As soon as he entered, Yue Zhishi saw that there was no bin around, so he quickly finished the last bite and placed the folded packaging in his pocket.Peiya was one of the most well-known high school in this local area. Compared to score focused education like the neighbouring schools, this school took a foreign education route and many students move on to study abroad for their further education. There was even a saying that goes \u2018Only half of Peiya\u2019s students take the college entrance examination\u2019. Coupled with the fact that the school was rich and could afford the land it occupied, the junior and senior high school departments had never been separated.With such a huge student volume, the annual opening ceremony naturally became the school\u2019s major event. No matter how free or uncontrolled you may be, today was a day where nothing should go wrong.The senior high school students entered first and sat in the auditorium according to their class. Compass stood at the front arranging everyone: \u201cJunior high school class 3-6 to 3-11 sit in the centre.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhy is it the blue class again?\u201cHave to sit on the ground again.\u201dThe summer school uniform for the junior high school students are of a light blue short-sleeved shirt while it is white for the senior high school students. Because the winter knitted vest is also these two colours for the two departments, over time, everyone started using the colour of the uniform to represent the junior and senior high school students.Everyone started to look for a place to sit. After not seeing each other over summer, the first thing the girls did was to get together and gossip. After all, this was a topic everyone loved to talk about.\u201cDid you see the confession wall last night?\u201d\u201cNo, who is it this time?\u201d\u201cA junior high school second year confessed to Senior Song Yu. Wrote heaps. Seems to have been secretly crushing on him for a whole year.\u201d\u201cWow the school idol\u2026\u2026really courageous.\u201d\u201cDid our school vote on the school idol? I don\u2019t remember casting a vote.\u201d\u201cNo but Song Yu has been accepted by almost everyone. They even dared to go after him. I have never seen him be close to any girl. Let alone those in junior high school, there aren\u2019t any in the senior high school department.\u201dHearing Song Yu\u2019s name, Yue Zhishi was a little pleased, but he also felt a little uncomfortable inside. His face felt a little itchy. He tugged at his hair a little and looked around, his eyes slowly following the crowd. The class leader had organised everyone\u2019s seats and Yue Zhishi was sitting at the very back of the group of boys. The focus of the gossip of the girls in front changed from the hot topic of a junior high school second year girl confessing to a third year senior high school senior had changed to the topic of how many school idols there were in Peiya.\u201cLater, there was an argument under that confession wall. Someone said that Song Yu has a poker face and likes to ignore people so he\u2019s not as good as Yue Zhishi from the junior high school department. I almost laughed to death. To think that I would eat melon seeds in my own class.\u201d\u201cWhat do they mean not as good? Le Le is pretty good looking. Isn\u2019t a mixed-race face nice? And he has good personality.\u201d\u201cSome said that he\u2019s too young, but they argued and argued and they basically concluded that there can be a school idol in each of the senior high school and junior high school department. After that, everything was settled.\u201d\u201cHahaha, that\u2019s true. I would really like to see the two of them stand together to compare.\u201d\u201cJust putting them together in the same frame is difficult enough. They have no connections at all.\u201dJiang Yufan perked his ears, listening to this conversation for a while. He then started teasing, \u201cLittle Le Le is not bad. You\u2019re even compared with Song Yu.\u201dYue Zhishi had his neck craned, searching for Song Yu\u2019s figure in the auditorium and was not paying attention to the girl\u2019s conversation. Being told something like this by Jiang Yufan all of a sudden, he was confused, \u201cHuh?\u201dAt this moment, one of the girls at the front turned around and grinned, \u201cLe Le, what do you think about Senior Song Yu\u2019s appearance? Aside from his character.\u201dAfter entering junior high, this was the first time he was asked about Song Yu at school.Yue Zhishi felt a little guilty. It was the same feeling as when he hid outside the examination centre, waiting for Song Yu to come out. He started unconsciously blinking faster as he tried to think of a stranger-like response.\u201cSenior Song Yu is very handsome, and his grades are good.\u201dBut in the end, he couldn\u2019t hold back the desire to speak up for him, \u201cAnd I think there is no problem with his character.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s tone was very serious, \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t like to talk, it doesn\u2019t mean that he has a bad personality. Although he looks a little scary, he\u2019s actually very nice\u2026.\u201dThe girl listening felt that it didn\u2019t sound right. She interrupted and asked with some confusion, \u201cWait a minute, how do you know that he\u2019s nice?\u201dSure enough, he wasn\u2019t good at hiding.Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t speak for a moment. At this moment, Jiang Yufan stepped in, \u201cI have to say, Song Yu really is a better person than I thought. Today he was on duty and he picked up Le Le\u2019s name badge and gave it back to him. He even helped him hide it from Compass.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cA heroic act.\u201d\u201cAs expected of a handsome guy!\u201dThe ceremony began. The class leader reminded them to be quiet and the gossiping quickly came to a stop. Yue Zhishi breathed a sigh of relief. That was too close. Considering their ability to gossip, if they really found out about their relationship, they will definitely not stop talking about it.The speeches at the beginning of each year are almost the same. The leader stood there talking while the students listening down below were about to lose their minds. After a while, it changed to the junior high school department representative who was also a female student from their class. Yu Zhishi straightened up and listened attentively to show his support but the lights in the auditorium were too bright, causing his head to slowly bend back down like a wilting sunflower.He didn\u2019t know if it was because he ate the bread too quickly, his stomach felt a little uncomfortable. It was as if there was a clump of cotton stuck in there, unable to go up or go down.Rubbing his stomach, Yue Zhishi stared at a small black spot on the tip of his canvas shoe. Focusing at this spot for a while, that small spot gradually spread and grew, like a low-pressure cloud. Applause came from all directions, signalling the end of the speech. This sound poured into his ears like boiling water, burning into his chest cavity, the steam inflating his lungs.There was a small commotion among the students. His throat was dry and itchy, like it was being tickled by a feather. Yue Zhishi lowered his head to clear his throat as the new student representative stepped onto the stage.Please read this from kk translatesAfter approaching the microphone, there was a sharp screech from the speaker, as if it was calling for everyone\u2019s attention.The next second, a low voice came from the uncooperative microphone.\u201cSorry.\u201dYue Zhishi immediately raised his head to look at the person on the stage, his chest rising and falling rather quickly.\u201cGood morning everyone, I am Song Yu from class 3-5.\u201dHis heart started racing. It was a pathological kind of racing.Just as those girls had mentioned earlier, Song Yu\u2019s good looks were recognised and acknowledged by everyone. His long and narrow figure as well as his sharp eyes however gave him a strong sense of oppression and detachment.It was difficult finding traces of emotion on his face.On the contrary, Yue Zhishi\u2019s features were soft and youthful, making him appear unthreatening. His almost transparent amber eyes also made him look innocent and sincere.\u201cToday is the first day of school\u2026\u2026..\u201dSong Yu lowered his eyes, his gaze falling onto the small folder resting on his forearm. His tone was calm as he spoke, and he would occasionally look up at the audience with a quiet gaze.Yue Zhishi had always liked listening to Song Yu read, no matter what the content was, but right now something wasn\u2019t quite right. He clearly wanted to carefully listen to every word, but he couldn\u2019t seem to concentrate. His dry and itchy throat also appeared to have worsened.His lungs felt like it was compressed and narrow, the airflow unable to go in or go out.Oh no.This reaction was all too familiar. Yue Zhishi pulled out the packaging from his pocket to check. His breathing gradually got more and more difficult.Sure enough, he had made a mistake. Ordinary bread of this brand and their rice bread only had a difference of a small symbol on the bottom right corner, everything else was exactly the same.Yue Zhishi suffered from severe wheat allergy. In addition to the common rash and itchy throat, he also would experience the most uncomfortable reaction \u2013 allergy related asthma. This symptom only appears when he has made a lot of contact with the allergen.The auditorium was too quiet. The only thing that could be heard was Song Yu\u2019s voice and the gradually worsening wheezing from his chest.His first reaction was regret. Regret that he had left his medicine in his desk. Who would have thought that he would have an allergic reaction the one time he left it behind?But this thought didn\u2019t last long and his instinct to call for help took over. The asthma taking away his strength, Yue Zhishi struggled with difficulty to lean forward and grab Jiang Yufan by the arm.The people around him also found it strange.\u201cA new semester also means a new beginning.\u201dStanding on the stage, Song Yu had his eyes lowered as he read his manuscript.The students in the audience suddenly started to turn rowdy and it was concentrated at the end of a certain class. Several even stood up and formed a circle. The other students in the other classes also noticed it and craned their necks to see.\u201cThis can be regarded as a critical point in life. The turning point is just ahead\u2026.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t care much about what happened. His personality was just like that. He only occasionally raised his eyes and just happened to see a person lying on the ground through the chaotic crowd.\u201cLe Le! Are you okay?!\u201dThe director who was unclear of the situation hurried over to maintain order, \u201cHey which class are you? What are you doing?\u201dJiang Yufan was kneeling on the ground, his voice anxious, \u201cTeacher! Someone\u2019s not feeling well!\u201dThe speech stopped abruptly, and it was followed by a clatter. It was the sound of the folder falling. The sound was amplified by the loudspeaker and seemed to sound particularly rushed and sudden.The director looked over. There was no one on the stage, \u201cIt\u2019s all messed up!\u201dThe student responsible for filming stood there stupidly with his camera. For a while, he didn\u2019t know whether he should chase after the student representative or continue aiming it at the empty space on the stage.There was an incident during the ceremony and stopping the speech could be considered a normal response, but the representative had walked off without a word.And that person was also Song Yu.It was too abnormal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He clearly wanted to take a big breath but the airflow entering his body grew smaller and smaller. It felt like there was a hole in his chest and air constantly leaked out. Before he could take a proper breath, he started coughing violently.Sensing that his student was in very bad conditions, Wang Qian was also very anxious, \u201cYue Zhishi, what\u2019s going on? Are you okay? Can you talk?\u201d He lifted Yue Zhishi and gently patted his back, \u201cTry taking a deep breath. Take it slow.\u201dJust when everyone didn\u2019t know what to do, a white figure broke through the crowd of blue.\u201cSpread out, don\u2019t surround him.\u201dThe classmates around Yue Zhishi were shocked. No one had thought that Song Yu who was still speaking on stage just now would suddenly appear here.The head teacher Wang Qian was also a little surprised when he saw Song Yu. This was a student he had taught. Back then, he felt that this child was rather cold and didn\u2019t have many good friends so he didn\u2019t seem like the righteous type.Song Yu half squatted down, supported Yue Zhishi who could no longer speak and help adjust his position before taking out medicine from his pocket.Seeing the medicine he carried with him, Wang Qian was a little confused. He asked carefully, \u201cSong Yu, can he take your medicine? I have already called the emergency staff at the school hospital. They will be here soon.\u201d\u201cNo time. This is his medicine.\u201d Song Yu was so calm, he didn\u2019t seem like a student but more like a professional emergency worker. He raised his head and instructed the people around him, \u201cEveryone, spread out a little more.\u201dHe loosened the tie around Yue Zhishi\u2019s neck and unbuttoned the two buttons at the top of his shirt, exposing his neck. Supporting his shoulder and stabilising his head, one hand accurately held the inhaler at Yue Zhishi\u2019s mouth. His actions were smooth and fluid, \u201cYue Zhishi, take your medicine.\u201dAt this moment, Yue Zhishi\u2019s entire forehead was covered with cold sweat and his lips were slightly purple. He instinctively grabbed Song Yu\u2019s arm and exhausted all his strength to inhale the inhaler.He hadn\u2019t had asthma in a long time. That feeling of being unable to control his tears and breathing was extremely uncomfortable. Everything was blank but he could hear Song Yu\u2019s voice which gave him comfort.\u201cAgain.\u201dOver the past two years of being classmates, it was their first time encountering this kind of emergency. All of Yue Zhishi\u2019s classmates standing around them were stunned. Those who were familiar with him knew that he was allergic, but he usually only had a rash.The mist from the inhaler entered his lungs and, a few minutes later, Yue Zhishi\u2019s heaving chest started to gradually calm down and his breathing was no longer as quick or as short as it was a few minutes earlier.\u201cFeeling better?\u201d Wang Qian was still worried, \u201cWe should still get him to rest in the infirmary.\u201d\u201cNeeds a follow up check.\u201d Song Yu took away the inhaler and moved his gaze away from his pale face, inadvertently glancing at the bread packaging left on the ground.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogHe reached out and placed his palm against Yue Zhishi\u2019s chest to check his heart rate before moving to check the condition of the rashes on his arm and neck.Although the symptoms were relieved, his consciousness was still a little faint. Every time he has an asthma attack, he would become very dependent, like a chick struggling to live.He couldn\u2019t think at all while he was receiving first aid and only knew that Song Yu must be the one saving him. The first thing he wanted to do after recovering was to confirm this, so he weakly opened his eyes and was relieved to when he saw Song Yu\u2019s face.\u201cGe\u2026\u2026.\u201d His voice was faint and his fingers weakly grabbed Song Yu\u2019s arm. The asthma was like a violent storm, and his remaining willpower made him completely forget about his agreement.The sharp eared Jiang Yufan brainlessly repeated it, \u201cGe\u2026\u2026.GE?!\u201dJust that one word echoed through the auditorium.Song Yu is Yue Zhishi\u2019s \u2018brother\u2019.On the day of the opening ceremony, this secret Yue Zhishi had kept from others for two years was finally exposed to the entire school.\u00b7There would always be several outstanding people at school. If they\u2019re not being discussed about, they are surrounded by people.Yue Zhishi and Song Yu are both typical examples of this, but no one thought that these two usually unrelated people would actually have such a connection and it was actually such a close one.News spread fastest through dense crowds and it didn\u2019t take long for this incident during the opening ceremony to become a hot topic of discussion for everyone.Yue Zhishi\u2019s childhood had never been very quiet.When he first joined the Song family, he was transferred to a kindergarten. There, he had no friends he was familiar with and he also couldn\u2019t communicate and, most importantly, he looked different from everyone else. As a result, he was often watched like a circus animal and even bullied by some of the older children with nicknames like \u2018yellow hair\u2019 and \u2018little bastard\u2019.He didn\u2019t like kindergarten very much and would always be unwilling to go, wanting to just hide at home and draw. He would cry as soon as he reached the kindergarten and carrying him out of the car was like they were sending him out to be killed.Although this experience was no less during elementary school, he at least had Song Yu there so he would often find Song Yu when he was unhappy. Sometimes when Song Yu\u2019s class is over and he looks back, he would see the pitiful Yue Zhishi peeping past the classroom door, looking like an unweaned puppy.After his peers gradually matured, fewer and fewer people alienated him, and everyone gradually got used to it. Later, the aesthetics of grown-up children changed, and more and more people began to think that Yue Zhishi was good-looking, good-looking to the point that the other boys their age was no match for him. Since his personality was also good, the bullied Yue Zhishi somehow became a sought-after target of affection.He didn\u2019t like being the centre of attention and he also didn\u2019t want to be publicly executed at the opening ceremony but in the end, Yue Zhishi became the focus of the entire school in a very dramatic fashion.Lying in the infirmary bed, he looked up at the ceiling in daze. The doctor on duty checked him and he obediently cooperated, like a soulless toy. After the check, he laid down and continued to rest.Please read this from kk translatesThe steading breathing made him feel at ease.Ever since he was a child, Yue Zhishi had rich imagination. A small stain on the ceiling could look like a hermit crab on a white sandy beach to him and its small shell would lead him to associate it with caves or even a black hole.As he explored the universe through the ceiling, the door to the infirmary suddenly opened. Yue Zhishi turned over and peeked out through a small gap in the curtain only to see Jiang Yufan\u2019s face. He fell back onto the bed, disappointed.\u201cLe Le?\u201d Jiang Yufan\u2019s voice was very quiet, as if he was afraid of waking him up.\u201cI\u2019m not asleep.\u201d Yue Zhishi sat up and pulled open the curtain, \u201cIt\u2019s over? So fast.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Jiang Yufan brought his schoolbag over for him and handed him a carton of milk, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be allergic to this. I often see you drink it.\u201d Seeing him shake his head, Jiang Yufan was relieved, \u201cThe teacher said there\u2019s no need to go back. You can go home directly after you rest.\u201dYue Zhishu drank some of the milk, \u201cTeacher Wang didn\u2019t call my parents?\u201dThis incident was an accident. It was because he was not careful enough and he didn\u2019t want Aunt Rong to worry.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Anyway, he called Song Yu over and they talked for a while. It\u2019s probably to understand the situation.\u201d Reaching this point, Jiang Yufan started to vent, \u201cI knew it couldn\u2019t have been a coincidence for him just happen to pick up your name badge and just happen to recognise you. Halfway through his speech, he ran off the stage to give you first aid and he also just happened to have your medicine on him. If you didn\u2019t call out brother at the end, I would\u2019ve thought you two had a secret relationship.\u201dHearing that last line, Yue Zhishi was startled, \u201cNo, no, no. How could that be possible.\u201d After saying that, he explained, \u201cWe\u2019re not real brothers.\u201dIn fact, he also regretted it very much. When he sobered up and regained strength, he recalled the scene of himself calling Song Yu brother in front of everyone. Yue Zhishi wanted to beat his chest for making such a mistake.\u201cNot real? Cousins?\u201d Jiang Yufen suddenly came to an understand, \u201cSo that\u2019s why. The two of you don\u2019t look alike at all and you also don\u2019t share the same surname.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it. Just listen to my explanation.\u201d Yue Zhishi zipped up his bag and briefly explained about his foster care situation.Although he explained it very lightly, no matter how dense Jiang Yufan may be, he was still a little surprised, \u201cIs that so\u2026\u2026\u201dThe term foster care was too heavy of a word for these teenaged children, as if it was undermined by misfortune and misery.Jiang Yufan internally though: No wonder Yue Zhishi pretended not to know Song Yu at school.He scratched his head, \u201cTh-then\u2026\u2026then how is his family treating you?\u201dYue Zhishi smiled, \u201cThey\u2019re good. No different from their own son.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good. But\u2026\u201d Jiang Yufan asked again, \u201cBut why didn\u2019t they directly\u2026.what I\u2019m trying to say is\u2026 adopt\u2026.\u201d He said that last word very quietly.Yue Zhishi however didn\u2019t mind it, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve also asked about that before. Uncle said that my parents are great people and no one in the world can replace them so he hopes that I can remember them this way. They also said that even without going through that procedure, they will take good care of me.\u201d He added, \u201cUncle Song is my father\u2019s best, best friend. They grew up together like real brothers.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s it\u2026\u2026\u201d Jiang Yufan looked relieved. He patted him on the shoulder and said seriously, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell anyone. My mouth is sealed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Yue Zhishi lowered his head and suddenly noticed that his buttons were unbuttoned, and his tie had been pulled apart. He was half unconscious when it happened so he couldn\u2019t remember, \u201cWhat happened\u2026..\u201d\u201cYour brother\u2026..I mean, Song Yu undid it when he gave you first aid.\u201d Jiang Yufan then said, \u201cYou probably didn\u2019t see how he looked like rushing down from the stage. Really handsome.\u201dYue Zhishi indeed didn\u2019t see it. It was a pity. He could however imagine what it may have looked like. Lowering his head, he looked at the black spot on the tip of his shoe and recalled the haze he saw before the onset of the asthma attack. It felt as if he was completely trapped inside a dark cloud.The way Song Yu rushed over was probably like a bright beam of light, penetrating through the haze and finding him.Imagining this scene in his mind, a sense of joy rose in Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart and even the milk tasted sweet. When he picked up his bag, he noticed that it was bulging. He opened it and took a look. Inside was the gift he had received in the morning, \u201cYou even put this in?\u201d\u201cI thought you might want to go to class 11 before leaving.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d He finished off the rest of the milk and threw the carton into the trash can. After fixing his tie, he patted Jiang Yufan\u2019s leg, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Go home for dinner.\u201dJiang City\u2019s early September was still rather hot. The Chinese flame tree that hadn\u2019t been pruned for many years stretched its dense branches into the windows on the third floor. These passionate green leaves were blocked by the glass windows, making it appear a little pitiful.It was just like when the younger Yue Zhishi would press his face against the study rooms glass door to look at Song Yu inside, his fleshy face squashed and deformed.Since becoming Yue Zhishi\u2019s classmate at the beginning of their first year of junior high school, Jiang Yufan knew about his allergy, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be so serious. He asked curiously, \u201cHow did you know about your allergy? If it was this bad, it must\u2019ve been very serious the first time you found out.\u201dThe first time\u2026\u2026In fact, he still had some impression, but it wasn\u2019t much. He had also gone to the hospital too many times as a child and that had diluted his memories of his first time.\u201cI don\u2019t remember. I was three at the time and I seemed to need hospitalisation.\u201d\u201cThree!\u201d Jiang Yufan didn\u2019t dare imagine it, \u201cIt was scary enough today. Fortunately, your brother was around. I looked it up earlier and was scared to death. Turns out if you don\u2019t treat asthma in time, you can die.\u201dYue Zhishi comforted him, \u201cWhat happened today was only bad luck. The probability of it happening is very small.\u201dBut he remembered now. When it happened the first time, Song Yu seemed to have also been there.Saying goodbye to the doctor on duty, the two were about to go downstairs to leave only to run into a beautiful, short haired girl wearing a junior high school uniform like them. Her face was flushed red and her voice was very small, \u201cYue Zhishi\u2026..\u201dYue Zhishi wasn\u2019t familiar with her. He looked at Jiang Yufan for help.Jiang Yufan remembered and reminded his best buddy with a whisper, \u201cThis is the girl who gave you the gift. From class 11.\u201dYue Zhishi let out a small \u2018ah\u2019.\u201cA-are you alright now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay, I\u2019m all better.\u201d Yue Zhishi gave his thanks.The girl was relieved. She fiddled with the loose hair next to her ear, \u201cI went to your class this morning to look for you, but you hadn\u2019t arrived yet, so I left it in your desk\u2026\u2026\u201dYue Zhishi saw her ears turn red.\u201cI hope you like it.\u201dThe sun was very bright. The girl\u2019s voice was drowned by the cicada\u2019s cries.Holding the strap of his bag, he was silent for a while. Finally, he unzipped it and took out the gift, returning it to her with both hands.Jiang Yufan couldn\u2019t watch. This scene was too suffocating. When he turned his head to look down from the third floor, he saw a familiar figure; tall and wearing white.Isn\u2019t this Song Yu? Jiang Yufan narrowed his eyes to take a closer look.It really is!Song Yu pushed his bike over and stopped under a camphor tree. He looked down at his watch and looked up again, his eyes meeting Jiang Yufan\u2019s gaze.The aura was so strong, Jiang Yufan who was standing several metres away was rendered frozen by this cold glance. He immediately turned his head back, pretending that nothing had happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m sorry but I have to return this to you.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s eyes had very obvious Caucasian characteristics with softer contours and his hair was also a warm brown colour which shines golden under the sun, making him appear pure and soft. His external appearance gave people the impression that he was someone easy to get along with, easy to capture and easy to persuade, but this was actually not the case.The stubborn Yue Zhishi would often be too serious.The girl\u2019s expression was a little upset but she had also expected this. She hesitated a little over taking back her gift, \u201cBut I\u2026.\u201dShe opened her mouth but stopped.\u201cIt looks expensive. You must\u2019ve spent a long time picking it out.\u201d Yue Zhishi insisted and stretched his arms out more, making her accept it, \u201cYour writing is very nice. I think its more suitable for you to use.\u201dUpon hearing this, the girl looked up. Using praise instead of rejection made it hard for her to even feel sad.But she was still somewhat unwilling, \u201cDo you have someone you like?\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesYue Zhishi was taken aback.Someone he likes.He likes a lot of people; for example Aunt Rong and Uncle Song, for example the owner of the rice noodle store who would give him two extra pieces of beef every time he ordered the vegetarian option and for example Mr. Zhang from drawing class who gifted him comic books and drawing tools\u2026..There were too many. Countless examples appeared in Yue Zhishi\u2019s mind.But if he were to narrow it down to people he likes the most, the number of examples shrink significantly.But they still didn\u2019t seem to be the same as the like the girl in front of him was referring to.\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d The girl asked.Yue Zhishi put on his bag and paused for a moment, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to date right now. It\u2019s almost time for exams. If my grade drops, my parents will be called over.\u201dSeeing that the girl still looked upset, Yue Zhishi added, \u201cWe can still be friends.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t lie.\u201d Yue Zhishi readjusted the bag on his back, \u201cIt\u2019s so hot. Isn\u2019t there a vending machine downstairs? I\u2019ll treat you guys to a drink.\u201d\u201cI want Coke!\u201d Jiang Yufan didn\u2019t hesitate. He glanced down and saw that Song Yu was still there, leaning against the tree with his arms crossed in front of him and earphones in his ear. At this moment, he was staring up at them.Jiang Yufan couldn\u2019t help but shudder. He quickly nudged Yue Zhishi with his elbow.\u201cLe, look downstairs.\u201dYue Zhishi turned his head and saw Song Yu\u2019s figure through the railing.It was as if he was suddenly injected with stimulants. Yue Zhishi immediately turned around and leaned half his body out past the railing while supporting himself with both hands, but when he called out \u2018ge\u2019, it was with a very small and almost airy voice.He was like an excited little puppy who wanted to pounce but is hesitant to do it.The girl looked at Yue Zhishi\u2019s excited face and felt that he was completely different from how he was when he rejected her confession just now.Song Yu who was leaning against the camphor tree lowered his arms and approached his bicycle that was parked under the tree. He kicked away the kickstand and seemed to be about to ride off.Yue Zhishi was anxious. He grabbed his bag and wanted to go down, but he then remembered his promise of buying them drinks so he said frantically, \u201cI\u2019ll go down and buy it for you now.\u201dHe hurried downstairs. Fortunately, Song Yu hadn\u2019t left yet. Yue Zhishi quickly ran to the vending machine and first selected three cans of Coke but hesitated for a moment when he was about to pay and changed it to two cans of Coke and a bottle of white peach soda. Jiang Yufan and them just happened to arrive downstairs at this moment. Yue Zhishi hurriedly placed two cans of Coke on the vending machine, gestured frantically to Jiang Yufan while pointing at the vending machine and then turned and ran towards Song Yu.Through the gaps between the leaves, the small spots of light cast on his panting red face was very pretty. After calming his breathing, Yue Zhishi smiled and called out Song Yu gege and then brushed back his hair.\u201cWhat are you running for?\u201d Song Yu only glanced at him. He was still wearing his earphones.Because I was afraid that you would leave.He had an allergic reaction and even exposed their relationship in front of so many people, messing up Song Yu\u2019s speech in the process. After all that mess, he was afraid that Song Yu would ignore him.Yue Zhishi stuffed the cold soda in Song Yu\u2019s hand. When giving it to him, he noticed the watch on Song Yu\u2019s left wrist. It was a gift from him.When he was ten years old, the little model for Lin Rong\u2019s photographer friend fell ill and Yue Zhishi was brought over as emergency replacement. It was also because of this that he was given a reward. Ling Rong\u2019s philosophy was to let children be free so she encouraged Yue Zhishi to spend it however he wanted.When a child receives a red envelope, their first reaction would be to buy toys and snacks. Little Yue Zhishi went to the mall alone for several days before finally buying a beautiful watch.It was because Song Yu\u2019s birthday was in two days.That was his first time spending his own money to buy a gift. When he was a child, he felt that it was very expensive but, thinking about it now, that watch wasn\u2019t a from a famous brand and the style was also simple. It wasn\u2019t like the electronic watches popular amongst the students and was neither cool nor complicated.Since young, Song Yu would often receive \u2018gifts\u2019 from Yue Zhishi. Things like a manually glued \u2018rare\u2019 four leaf clover, Le Le coupons that he could use to order Yue Zhishi to do anything such as running errands if he collects ten, a hand drawn desk calendar\u2026\u2026But when he first received this gift, Song Yu\u2019s first reaction was to refuse it and even dragged Yue Zhishi to the mall where he bought the watch.At that time, Song Yu had just entered first year of junior high school, but when he stood at the counter handling the return procedures, he was like an adult. Only Yue Zhishi alone was crying. He even sat on the ground holding Song Yu\u2019s leg wailing like he was the one whose gift was being returned.It was a pity that this memory was too vague. As for why Song Yu was so adamant about refusing this gift and why he changed his mind later and accepted it, Yue Zhishi no longer remembered.He was a little curious about it but after some thought, he decided not to ask. He had just had an asthmatic attack and he should be grateful that he wasn\u2019t being scolded. Now wasn\u2019t a good time to ask about this.Song Yu unscrewed the lid, took a sip and then gave it back to him. Only then did Yue Zhishi return to his senses.\u201cSong Yu gege, did you wait long?\u201d\u201cJust came.\u201d Song Yu stepped on the pedal.Please read this from kk translatesYue Zhishi took the initiative to report to him the results from his check up, \u201cI\u2019m fine now. I also took some medicine earlier.\u201d\u201cI can see that you\u2019re fine.\u201d Song Yu said.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t sense anything wrong with that line and continued, \u201cFortunately you were around, or I may not have made it.\u201dHe said the last few words very seriously, but it also wasn\u2019t an exaggeration. Although he brought his own food to eat in elementary school, a child of his age was still unaware of how serious allergies can be. At that time, there were several serious incidents and Song Yu who was in the same school saved him every time.He didn\u2019t know how many times this life of his had been saved by Song Yu. Sometimes Yue Zhishi would think of those clips he saw of small animals repaying kindness and wondered what kind of animal he would be in his next life.It would be nice if he was a little cotton candy-like Pomeranian with a small tag around his neck.Thinking of the tag, Yue Zhishi suddenly remembered what happened at the school gates this morning, \u201cYou saved me twice today.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t scold him like he thought but he didn\u2019t say anything else and just got ready to leave. Yue Zhishi noticed this and immediately sat down on the back seat. When Song Yu turned his head to look at him, he raised his head, \u201cMy bike is parked at the school gate. Getting a ride until we reach it.\u201dHe didn\u2019t agree or refuse. Yue Zhishi waved goodbye to Jiang Yufan and the girl who stood not far away, \u201cI\u2019ll head off first.\u201dJiang Yufan felt that there seemed to be some joy concealed in his voice.When he first found out that Song Yu and Yue Zhishi were brothers, he wondered why the two didn\u2019t reveal this relationship to others. Recalling the time when the two acted like they had no relationship with other, he even felt that Song Yu was too indifferent.But if he put himself in that situation, how would he explain his relationship with Yue Zhishi?No matter how he explained, he couldn\u2019t escape the topic of Yue Zhishi\u2019s parents.Gossip can hurt people without drawing blood. Sometimes, silence was the best form of protection.Riding out, the wind gently swept past their faces.This reminded Yue Zhishi of the time he sat on Song Yu\u2019s back seat when he was a child. The Song Yu at the time had just learned to ride a bicycle and the first person he took around was him. At first they were both very happy. Little Yue Zhishi held his brother\u2019s waist and raised his legs up high yelling: Faster, faster.Later, they fell. Yue Zhishi\u2019s knees were cut and bloody and since then Song Yu stopped letting him ride with him.Almost reaching the school gate, Yue Zhishi was worried that Song Yu would stop and make him ride his own bicycle, so he tried to think of an excuse.His chain fell? Not good, too fake.Not enough air? Probably won\u2019t work either.Or should he say that his asthma still hasn\u2019t fully recovered, and his chest feels tight so he can\u2019t ride his bike?Finally thinking of a good excuse, he looked up only to see that they are now far from the school gates. Song Yu hadn\u2019t stopped. He may have forgotten what he said earlier, Yue Zhishi thought.At the traffic lights, Song Yu stopped. Cars passed by before them one after another.A layer of water droplets condensed on the surface of the bottle, turning it into a bottle of soda with a guilty conscience.\u201cSong Yu gege, did Teacher Wang call Aunt Rong?\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t respond. Perhaps he didn\u2019t hear him.Although Song Yu usually doesn\u2019t talk to him all that much, Yue Zhishi could detect the subtle changes in his emotions. Right now, he seemed to be unhappy.Was it because his allergic reaction after eating the wrong thing caused him trouble?Then why did he come see him?Probably to make sure he was okay, or he wouldn\u2019t be able to explain to Aunt Rong later.\u201cSong Yu gege\u2026..\u201d While the lights were still red, Yue Zhishi gently took out one of Song Yu\u2019s earphones and spoke placatingly, \u201cCan you not tell Aunt Rong about what happened today? She will definitely lecture me about it.\u201dThe traffic lights flashed one after another, making it look even more guilty.\u201cAbout what?\u201d Song Yu suddenly said.Yue Zhishi was a little confused, \u201cHuh?\u201dThe bicycle wheel started to move again. Driven by inertia, Yue Zhishi\u2019s body couldn\u2019t help but lean back, the earphone cable becoming a fragile link between the two. In panic, he instinctively held tightly onto Song Yu\u2019s waist and he could also hear his voice which sounded like it was conducted through his warm body.\u201cAre you referring to you eating the wrong food and not bringing your medicine with you, you almost falling into shock at the opening ceremony.\u201dThe September sun was still blinding.\u201cOr dating?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was still obediently holding one end of the earphone in his hand. He muttered to himself in a small voice, \u201cI\u2019m not dating.\u201dAnd he even rightfully declined.He turned his head back to look at Song Yu in front of him and retorted more loudly, \u201cI\u2019m not dating!\u201dSong Yu remained silent. Yue Zishi could only ponder over it on his own. When he recalled the matter outside the infirmary, he finally came to an understanding, \u201cWere you standing outside all that time? You\u2019re mistaken. I was returning a gift back to her.\u201dOmitting the information about the other party\u2019s identity, Yue Zhishi reported the entire situation to Song Yu like a kindergarten child obediently reporting everything that had happened at school each day, speaking vividly for fear of missing details.One reported the entire way while the other silently listened. They turned into a winding alley from the spacious road and approached their destination under a row of sycamore trees.\u201cI didn\u2019t accept, and I bought her a drink because I was afraid that she was upset after rejecting her. Also, the drink I bought her was a coke. I also bought Jiang Yufan a coke, but I gave\u2026.\u201dReaching this point, he suddenly stopped. Somehow, he felt more and more wronged the more he explained himself. He thought of the confession wall incident the girls in his class were discussing this morning.\u201cWeren\u2019t you also confessed to? And it was on the Peiya confession wall. I\u2019ll also tell on you.\u201d They were clearly words of threat, but it didn\u2019t have that effect at all, and his voice even unconsciously grew smaller when he said it. After a pause, Yue Zhishi added heatedly, \u201cThe girls in our class were talking about it this morning. The whole school probably already knows about it.\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesThe bicycle suddenly stopped. Yue Zhishi immediately found himself pressed against Song Yu\u2019s back, unable to continue voicing his complaints.\u201cThe whole school knows more than just that confession.\u201dSong Yu finally spoke. He then ordered Yue Zhishi off the bike.Of course, Yue Zhishi knew what he was talking about, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it deliberately. I was too uncomfortable at the time and accidentally said it\u2026.\u201d He followed behind him like a little chick, \u201cWhat can we do now? Everyone heard it. There\u2019s probably not a single person who doesn\u2019t know about it now.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t provide him with a plan. He locked the bike and went in.Seeing that his brother was still not happy after all that explaining, it seemed that the reason for his bad mood wasn\u2019t because of this.The bike was parked in front of an old blue-grey house. A tall magnolia tree was planted in front of the courtyard and the courtyard itself was well-kept. The house was of a European-style building and very simple decorated. There was a large stone about the height of a person standing at the door with the two words engraved, \u201cYanghe Qizhe.\u201dThis was a Song Yu\u2019s mother\u2019s hobby \u2014 Running a private restaurant.Song Yu swept open the door curtain and Yue Zhishi followed him in. There were already guests who had come in with prior appointments. Grandpa Zhang, a retired university professor who had been a frequent visitor since the opening of the shop, laughed and joked when he saw them coming in, \u201cXiao Rong, your big handsome boy and little handsome boy are back.\u201dLin Rong came out from the kitchen when she heard this. She placed down a small plate of honey coated peaches on the table and glanced at Yue Zhishi and Song Yu with a smile.Yue Zhishi was a very likeable person. Before Lin Rong could speak, he cutely called out to Grandpa Zhang. Song Yu nodded slightly as a greeting.\u201cLe Le is taller again but still a little less than your brother.\u201dLin Rong took off the schoolbag from Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder, \u201cThey\u2019re three years apart anyway and Le Le is still young and not in good health. It\u2019s already a good height.\u201dYue Zhishi emphasised a number that not many people care about, \u201cI\u2019m already one metre seventy-six.\u201dSong Yu, the tallest in the store, didn\u2019t participate in the discussion of their heights and alone proceeded into the innermost private room. That was a lounge specially prepared by Lin Rong for the two brothers.Lin Rong took out a very delicately packaged meal and handed it to Professor Zhang with both hands, \u201cEat it while it\u2019s hot when you get back.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Professor Zhang was very happy, \u201cMy dear loves this the most and is craving it. I\u2019m bringing it back now.\u201d\u201cGoodbye Grandpa Zhang.\u201d Yue Zhishi took the initiative to walk him out.When the shop first opened, both Le Le and Song Yu were still in elementary school. Ling Rong who was only doing this as a hobby only opened the shop on Mondays and Fridays. There were no menus, and everything was done at her own discretion. Customers came one after another and word of mouth continued to spread. Later, Lin Rong changed those business hours and she now did this four days a week which was also convenient for the allergic Yue Zhishi to come and have lunch.Lunch was as usual very plentiful. The white porcelain plate was filled with gold and crispy fried lotus roots one of which was picked up immediately by Yue Zhishi when it was served. As soon as he bit into it, the outside was crispy while the inside was sweet. Compared to ordinary fried vegetables that are rolled in flour, the lotus root paste that had been kneaded and boiled had a similar consistency to meat and was very delicious.\u201cLotus root balls are the best type of meatballs in the world.\u201d Before Yue Zhishi was done eating them, he had already picked up a braised chicken feet and stuffed it into his mouth. The red sauce was thick, and the chicken feet was so tender, just a light suck pulled the flesh off.Many people have praised Yue Zhishi for his enthusiastic eating style and there were even some who had suggested that he do an eating broadcast because just watching him eat made them also have a good appetite.Lin Rong came in carrying rock sugar lotus root noodles, \u201cWas the opening ceremony fun?\u201d She had her hand placed on Song Yu\u2019s shoulder, but her eyes were directed at Yue Zhishi, \u201cHow was Song Yu\u2019s speech today? Did he forget his lines?\u201dYue Zhishi who was originally stuffing his mouth like a little hamster suddenly paused with his cheeks still bulging.\u201cAh, did he really forget his lines?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Song Yu ignored Yue Zhishi\u2019s sneaky winks and stirred the noodle soup, \u201cIt\u2019s just that something happened.\u201dYue Zhishi suddenly found that the chicken feet in his mouth no longer tasted fragrant.No way. Didn\u2019t he promise not to say it?\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lin Rong was curious.Song Yu lightly glanced at Yue Zhishi, \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d\u201cLe Le? What happened to Le Le?\u201dYue Zhishi panicked. His eyes flitted frantically between Song Yu and Ling Rong and he decided that it was best for him to come clean himself, \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t wear a name badge and was caught.\u201d Song Yu took a sip and when he looked up, he was met with a surprised Yue Zhishi, \u201cWas almost late.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t what he had expected.\u201cName badge?\u201d Lin Rong exclaimed in a small voice, \u201cAh, it\u2019s me. I took them off together when I washed the clothes and accidentally placed them both in your gege\u2019s room. Sorry, sorry.\u201dAfter saying this, she looked at Yue Zhishi apologetically and she then caught a glimpse of the name badge on his chest, \u201cHuh? Why do you have it on?\u201dYue Zhishi explained with a guilty conscience, \u201cGege gave it to me.\u201dA waiter called outside, and Lin Rong hurried out. Yue Zhishi let out a sigh of relief and looked at Song Yu who helped cover up for him.\u201cI was the one who made you mess up your speech, sorry. I won\u2019t eat the wrong thing again.\u201dThe lotus root noodles had been strained through ice water, making Song Yu feel a lot more refreshed after finishing half the bowl and the anger inside him also subsided somewhat but when he heard this apology that missed the point, his expression became cold again.Did he think that he was mad because of the speech?But Yue Zhishi\u2019s expression was pitiful so he suppressed his irritation and asked, \u201cWhere is your medicine?\u201dFacing the sudden question, Yue Zhishi was startled. He explained in a small voice, \u201cThe previous one ran out and I brought a new bottle today. I couldn\u2019t open it in time before we had to leave for the ceremony, so I left it in the classroom.\u201d After that, he added, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that I would get sick\u2026..\u201dSong Yu asked directly, \u201cThen have you ever thought about what it would have been like if I wasn\u2019t there today?\u201dThis question stunned Yue Zhishi.If Song Yu wasn\u2019t there today, he would definitely be in a very dangerous situation. It was a very bad allergic reaction.He didn\u2019t speak. Song Yu coldly continued, \u201cI can\u2019t always be by your side.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Yue Zhishi looked up at him with a frown.The dangerous consequences of having an allergic reaction didn\u2019t scare him as much as that line of Song Yu\u2019s. He couldn\u2019t imagine what it would be like without Song Yu by his side.\u201cI will take medicine every day in the future. I promise this won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Yue Zhishi lowered his eyes, \u201cI really won\u2019t let it happen.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t say that to make Yue Zhishi apologise. Thinking of the events today, he couldn\u2019t restrain his emotions.But after a moment of silence, he didn\u2019t continue the topic, \u201cEat.\u201d He picked up another bowl of lotus root noodles and one by one transferred the goji berries in there into another bowl.Having grown up together for the past eleven years, Yue Zhishi could understand Song Yu\u2019s tone. It meant that the topic was over. Feeling relieved, he hummed happily and passed over a lot of hot and sour lotus root strips into Song Yu\u2019s bowl, \u201cEat this.\u201dThat was Song Yu\u2019s favourite dish since he was a child. It didn\u2019t require any complicated seasoning process, but that crispy taste far surpasses the taste of any of the other vegetables. The lotus root strip was very thin, only about the thickness of a finger. It was cut diagonally into sections and then stir-fried together with dried peppers and boiled with vinegar. With all the pores filled with the soup, it was both crispy and flavoursome. This kind of vegetable could only be served in summer and would no longer be available after September as it was difficult to keep fresh during long distance transportation and hence is not available in many cities.\u201cIt would be great if you could eat lotus roots all the time.\u201dHearing this, Song Yu pushed that bowl of lotus root noodles over to Yue Zhishi. His tone didn\u2019t carry much emotion, \u201cAfter seeing it every day, you won\u2019t find it delicious anymore.\u201dIt only felt more precious because you can only enjoy it for a short amount of time.After seeing it every day, there was less novelty and anticipation.\u201cNo way.\u201dHe didn\u2019t expect Yue Zhishi to refute. There was slight surprise in his eyes.Please read this from kk translatesYue Zhishi spoke with a child\u2019s determination, \u201cI am happy to eat something I like every day. What\u2019s the point of eating something that I don\u2019t like in order to change things up? It\u2019s best to have something I like every day.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s actions stopped, \u201cYou won\u2019t get sick of it?\u201dYue Zhishi hesitated for a moment and didn\u2019t answer immediately. Song Yu didn\u2019t wait for the answer and quietly continued to eat.\u201cIf it is my favourite, I won\u2019t get sick of it.\u201d He spoke each word with great emphasis, as if it was an answer he had come to after thinking it over for a long time.Song Yu\u2019s eyes trembled slightly. While he was caught off guard by Yue Zhishi, he was given a lotus root ball by Yue Zhishi. He furrowed his brows and looked at him strangely.\u201cI\u2019ll give you my favourite lotus root ball.\u201d Yue Zhishi looked up at him the same way he did when he first came to this house.At that time, Yue Zhishi stuck to Song Yu every day. He didn\u2019t understand anything, and he also didn\u2019t know how to speak Chinese, but he would try to express it with his actions. Before Song Yu went to bed every night, he would find some strange little toys placed it next to his pillow and sometimes they would be under his pillow.Every time, Song Yu would take these little toys away but they would always show up next to his pillow the next day.Later, Song Yu who had just come out from the shower happened to catch the \u201cculprit\u201d. He saw Yue Zhishi standing on his tiptoes and stretching out his fleshy arms to place a small train and astronaut toy next to his pillow.Yue Zhishi who couldn\u2019t explain himself clearly and could only babble using simple Chinese vocabulary intermingled with English. It took Song Yu a long time to understand that he had wanted to give him his favourite toy to accompany him while he slept.At that time, he refused, \u201cI don\u2019t want your toys. I\u2019m not a child.\u201dYue Zhishi cried at the time but when night came, he once again brought a toy over and said a bunch of strange English babble to Song Yu. He was basically saying that the toy was really good and that it was his favourite toy.In the end, Song Yu conceded. He just picked up the small train and gave the astronaut toy back, \u201cOne is enough.\u201dSong Yu laid in bed that night, playing with the little train absentmindedly when he accidentally pressed something and the lights on the train lit up and started to rumble nonstop. He didn\u2019t know how to stop it. In the end, it caused him to have a very long dream in which the little dumpling kept on crying and held onto him tightly as he did that. It was simply the worst nightmare.After so many years, nothing had changed.After eating, the two left the table and took out two tatami mats that were rolled up in the corner of the room and laid them out for them to nap on.\u201cIs third year difficult? I heard you used up all your pencil refills in just three days.\u201d Yue Zhishi laid down on his pillow and looked over at Song Yu.Song Yu took out a copy of \u201cNational Geographic\u201d from the shelf and began to look through it, \u201cI only just started third year.\u201dThat was true and he was also very smart so it shouldn\u2019t be hard for him. Yue Zhishi gazed up at the ceiling. He didn\u2019t want to go to high school. There were already too many papers to finish now so he felt that he might die when he enters high school.Rather than asthma or allergies making him die, it was a bit shameful to die because of exam papers.Seeing that Yue Zhishi was still gazing up at the ceiling, Song Yu placed down the magazine and ordered him, \u201cSleep.\u201dYue Zhishi let out an \u2018oh\u2019 and closed his eyes.Seeing that he had finally settled down, Song Yu threw a summer blanket over and also raised the air conditioner by two degrees before he similarly laid down.When Yue Zhishi had his eyes closed, he appeared very docile. Those large eyes of his seemed to be the container for all his vitality so once they were closed, he appeared weaker and paler. This made Song Yu uncontrollably think of his asthmatic episode his morning.Feelings are all archived, and it can be recalled in an instant.Rapid development would be the words many adults would use to describe children, especially if they hadn\u2019t seen them for a long time. Suddenly seeing them again, they are surprised by how much the child had grown. Yue Zhishi had clearly grown up by his side and they were together almost every day, but Song Yu still felt this way.Seeing Yue Zhishi lying there quietly like this, Song Yu couldn\u2019t help but recall the first time he was hospitalised because of allergies. At that time, he was also a quiet, little one.That was the first time the six-year-old Song Yu realised what danger meant.\u201cSong Yu gege.\u201d Yue Zhishi suddenly opened his eyes and turned over, catching Song Yu off-guard with his face at a very close proximity.\u201cWhat was my first allergic reaction like? Do you remember?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6: A Sudden Heavy StormOf course he remembered.Yue Zhishi had arrived at Song Yu\u2019s side at the same time as a sudden rainstorm.He remembered very clearly. He had been the one who opened the door that night, and the unexpected summer rain had blown in, wetting his hair. His father had carried a child in his arms, coat wrapped tightly around the child. After he came in, he\u2019d knelt down and cuddled Song Yu.Song Yu had suspiciously pulled aside a bit of the coat. \u201cWho is this?\u201dThe coat\u2019s opening had revealed a pair of eyes. They\u2019d looked almost like glass marbles.\u201cThis is your younger brother.\u201dSix-year-old Song Yu gained a younger brother overnight. He was soft and beautiful, and he looked just like the angels in fairytale books. He had brown curly hair and could only speak English in a sweet, childish voice.Song Yu was the exact opposite of this child. Song Yu never had a lively personality from birth \u2014 he never fussed around, but he would also never talk much. Relatives always said he had a bad personality that needed to be changed, but Lin Rong stood up for him, saying his personality resembled her father. She allowed Song Yu to be himself from childhood.He was very smart, his mind maturing a lot faster than other children. But no matter how mature he was, he was at a loss when faced with a strange child who would take away a portion of his parents\u2019 love and care. Song Yu didn\u2019t like him at first \u2014 but he also didn\u2019t hate him.Most of the time, he just silently observed.So strange, his eyelashes are so curly.Why does this small thing find it so hard to speak? He looks a bit dumb.I couldn\u2019t have been this dumb when I was younger, right?But Yue Zhishi was born cute, and relatives always complimented him whenever they saw him. Those compliments shook Yue Zhishi\u2019s impression in little Song Yu\u2019s heart. He couldn\u2019t help but admit it \u2014 Yue Zhishi was cuter than the Pomeranian dog Song Yu wanted to buy.The third day he arrived, Yue Zhishi suddenly couldn\u2019t stop crying, sobbing that he wanted mommy and daddy, his own mommy and daddy. No one could stop his tears.\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d Song Yu walked closer, and Yue Zhishi stuck out his arms for a hug once he was close enough. But Song Yu couldn\u2019t lift him, so Yue Zhishi wrapped himself around him, sticking to him just like a glutinous rice cake.\u201cMy head hurts from all your crying.\u201d Song Yu felt hopeless and said to Lin Rong, \u201cMom, let\u2019s send him back to find his mom and dad. Send him home.\u201dLin Rong looked at him, wanting to say something but was unable to speak. She ended up coaxing Yue Zhishi into her arms and brought him upstairs, leaving only Song Yu and his father in the living room.\u201cXiao Yu.\u201d Father Song pulled him over and very seriously said, \u201cThat younger brother doesn\u2019t have a mom or dad anymore.\u201dSong Yu frowned. He didn\u2019t say anything and silently pondered what that meant. Father Song very quickly gave him a clearer answer.\u201cHis parents are gone. He doesn\u2019t have a home he can return to.\u201dHe understood what \u201cgone\u201d meant.Song Yu\u2019s frown deepened. He looked upstairs before turned back to his father. \u201cThen will he leave in the future?\u201dFather Song shook his head. \u201cThis is his home now.\u201dAdults would always unconsciously think children couldn\u2019t understand anything. But in reality, children\u2019s compassionate hearts were always larger than adults\u2019. They were the ones who would shelter a stray dog under their umbrellas on the way home.Song Yu was the same, even if he had never been much of an empathetic child.Once he returned back to his room, he hugged a pillow and sat on the small sofa. Father Song\u2019s words circled around inside his head.Yue Zhishi was such a cute child, and yet he didn\u2019t have his parents anymore.Those words stuck in his heart, and the more he thought about it, the more he thought Yue Zhishi was pitiful. No matter how beautiful a stray dog was, it would always be a stray. It would never have a place to go to when it rained and could only stay shivering in the alleyways, cold and hungry.The door suddenly squeaked open, interrupting Song Yu\u2019s train of thought about stray dogs. He looked over and saw Yue Zhishi\u2019s small figure standing by the door peering sadly into the room. Only half his face showed past the doorframe, and he even gave a random burp.Song Yu glanced at him and arrogantly asked, \u201cWhy are you hiding?\u201d His heart softened when the small figure didn\u2019t move, so he waved a hand, hinting for him to come in. Only then did Yue Zhishi slowly wobble his way towards him, every step stumbling from unsteady feet. It looked like he could fall over at any second, scaring Song Yu as he watched.Once Yue Zhishi finally managed to reach him, he simply gazed at him with his large eyes, face red from all his crying. He looked like a ripe peach almost ready to burst.His eyes were swollen. Song Yu remembered what Father Song said previously and so scooted over and allowed Yue Zhishi to huddle on the couch with him.It rained all through the last few days. It hadn\u2019t stopped raining since Yue Zhishi arrived.He was asking Yue Zhishi why he came to his room when lightning suddenly flashed outside his window. Loud thunder crashed before Yue Zhishi could answer and scared him into throwing his arms around Song Yu, his entire body trembling.Even though Song Yu was also startled by the thunder, Yue Zhishi was scared way more than he was. Not only did he tremble in fear, he once again started crying.Song Yu was most afraid of his crying. He wanted to get up and ask his mother to take Yue Zhishi back to his room, but Yue Zhishi refused to let go, stubbornly sticking to his body. Song Yu had no choice but to pretend to be like a real older brother and try to soothe him. But he didn\u2019t like to speak, so he only covered his ears and lightly patted his back.The thunder refused to stop. Every time Yue Zhishi calmed down a little bit, the thunder would once again sound and waste all of his previous efforts.Song Yu decided to look for something to distract the poor little thing.After thinking for a while, Song Yu took out a large box of chocolate-filled madeleine cookies. His dad had brought it back for him after a trip overseas, and Song Yu hadn\u2019t been willing to open it.How lucky of you.Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t so scared anymore with some sweets and Song Yu covering his ears. He ate very cutely, his two small pudgy hands holding a cookie as he took one bite after another. He jumped when thunder suddenly crashed again, and the cookie fell out of his hands. He picked it straight back up and continued to eat as tears rolled down his face.It was funny and pitiful at the same time.\u201cYou\u2019re so small. How can you eat so much?\u201d Song Yu looked at the empty box. There was only one cookie left, so he took it and bit into the sweet chocolate centre.Yue Zhishi reached out a hand towards him and softly said he still wanted more. Song Yu didn\u2019t have a choice but to hand over the cookie in his hand. \u201cNo more after this.\u201dYue Zhishi quickly ate that last half, chocolate smearing all over his mouth. Song Yu found him dirty and grabbed a tissue to wipe his mouth.He thought he really did seem like an older brother.Song Yu had complex feelings about this older brother identity suddenly being pushed onto him. It was a bit of a burden, but at the same time, he felt both pleased and proud about it. It was better than having a hundred people say to him, \u201cYou\u2019ve grown up.\u201dYue Zhishi refused to leave at bedtime, crying and fussing that he wanted to sleep with Song Yu. Lin Rong was forced to carry him into her son\u2019s room. Yue Zhishi stopped crying and fussing as soon as he entered Song Yu\u2019s blanket, obediently and peacefully sleeping next to Song Yu\u2019s arm. He was just like a small western doll, tearfully, obediently saying good night to him in English.Just because Song Yu covered his ears during thunder and gave him cake to eat, it looked like Yue Zhishi imprinted onto this child only three years older than him. Just like a young chick.Once Lin Rong left, Song Yu flipped over and looked at Yue Zhishi who had his eyes closed. He silently thought it could be nice to have a younger brother. Even though he was a bit clingy and constantly wanted to be close to him, it wasn\u2019t that bad. He could take him to the park to fly kites, to look at the riverside reeds. He could take him with him to his Olympic Mathematic classes, even though this small thing probably wouldn\u2019t understand a word.Song Yu\u2019s brain was already full of scenarios with Yue Zhishi sticking to him.Children were always full of curiosity, except for Song Yu. He was full of logic from a young age. But once he realised he\u2019d become an older brother, for the first time in his life, he was filled with a strange novelty.But that night, Song Yu also understood for the first time that it wasn\u2019t so simple to be an older brother.He was startled awake by the sound of Yue Zhishi\u2019s breathing in the middle of the night. His small hands were tightly grasped onto his arm, every breath gasping for air. Song Yu was scared witless, and his first reaction was to run off the bed to pound on his parents\u2019 door.The sound of the ambulance terrified people more than thunder, and it kept ringing in Song Yu\u2019s ears all night. He refused to be left behind and ran behind the adults, watching as his father carried Yue Zhishi. He was so small. His eyes were closed, and his mouth was no longer that pretty pink colour.The emergency room was full of disorder. His memories were like scattered scenes from a film covered by a grey filter. The sound of his heartbeat and Yue Zhishi\u2019s painful attempts for air were his background music.The doctor finally came out and told them everything was okay. His crying mother suddenly stood up, and his father pulled out a cigarette. Only then did Song Yu\u2019s heart start to calm down.\u201cOur initial testing shows asthma caused by food allergies. We tested some allergens, and it looks like this child has a very severe wheat allergy. He cannot eat anything with wheat. A mild reaction could be diarrhoea and a rash, but a stronger reaction may be like tonight\u2019s acute asthma attack. As parents, how could you not pay attention to these things?\u201dLin Rong kept crying and didn\u2019t say anything. Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t eaten anything that was made from wheat from the day he arrived \u2014 he\u2019d eaten mostly vegetables, fruit or rice porridge. His parents passed away so suddenly, leaving them no way to find out.\u201cWe\u2019ll be more careful next time,\u201d Father Song hoarsely said.\u201cThis allergy is very serious. The child\u2019s only three years old \u2014 you can\u2019t joke around with this.\u201d The doctor continued, \u201cDid he eat something he shouldn\u2019t have eaten today?\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have\u2026\u201d Lin Rong thought it was strange. She couldn\u2019t remember giving him anything with wheat today.A string snapped in Song Yu\u2019s mind. He suddenly understood. He was the world\u2019s scariest culprit, almost killing the younger brother who\u2019d relied on him so much. The beloved cookies he\u2019d brought out to soothe ended up going down as poison.\u201cHe\u2026 he ate some cookies. I gave them to him.\u201d Song Yu had never been so anxious before, and yet he honestly confessed his crime, even though he hadn\u2019t really meant to commit it.The doctor sighed, \u201cWe see these situations a lot. They\u2019re just children. It\u2019s just like when you feed some goldfishes and then they\u2019re dead the next day from being overfed. They never mean to do it.\u201dThis comparison didn\u2019t lessen Song Yu\u2019s guilt at all. It increased it.\u201cSeeing how strongly he reacted, he should\u2019ve eaten a fair amount.\u201d The doctor comforted him and said, \u201cYou must really like your younger brother to give him so much cake. Remember, next time you can\u2019t.\u201dA child\u2019s sense of remorse and anxiety allowed Song Yu to understand for the first time \u2014 even \u2018like\u2019 could cause harm.He thought he\u2019d just taken in a pitiful stray dog, sheltering it with his umbrella during a storm. But in reality, he\u2019d extended out his arm to carelessly feed some fishes while being full of delight, and the end result was just a lifeless, floating goldfish.His parents didn\u2019t blame him and even comforted him like the doctor did, telling him it was okay. But from that day on, Song Yu purposefully put some distance between him and this younger brother and refused to get overly close. He didn\u2019t understand why, but perhaps he was unable to let go of that night\u2019s fear and anxiety. Perhaps he realised what restraint meant.He understood what it meant a lot earlier than even some adults.After growing up, Song Yu constantly felt like there was a barrier between him and the rest of the world. His hands tightly clenched the few threads connecting him to the people he needed, and everything was covered by shades of grey.Only Yue Zhishi was an accident in his planned out life, arriving like a sudden heavy storm. Some people said it was an unresolved brotherhood from their previous lives bringing them together. A special thread was added to his hands, thin and bright red in colour. It was so thin it might break with just one breath. After all, this string didn\u2019t belong to him in the first place \u2014 so not only did he tightly grasp onto it, he tried to find ways to keep it intact.He just chose the stupidest, but most guaranteed way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7: Juice DyeSong Yu briefly recounted his memories of Yue Zhishi\u2019s first allergic reaction, skipping over his feelings and mental processes at that time.After listening, Yue Zhishi only had one thought \u2014 even now, Song Yu still wouldn\u2019t give him anything nice to eat.He was a little depressed thinking about it. But he didn\u2019t say anything, thinking that he would seem a bit childish if he brought it up. Song Yu saw his dejection and thought it meant something else, like being unable to accept Song Yu\u2019s accidentally harming him.So the two of them didn\u2019t keep talking.Curious girls in his class surrounded him once he returned to school in the afternoon. Yue Zhishi\u2019s head ached, so he spoke around the topic and didn\u2019t directly tell them of his parents\u2019 joint death. He only said the relationship between his and Song Yu\u2019s father has been very good, the two families were very close and that was why he was temporarily living with Song Yu. It wasn\u2019t really a lie.He didn\u2019t actually think it was shameful to not have parents. It was just that if he told the truth, everyone would definitely look at him with faces full of sympathy. Yue Zhishi still couldn\u2019t take that sort of situation.He considered himself to be very happy and didn\u2019t want to turn into a pitiful child in other people\u2019s eyes.Other than the curiosity towards his family background, Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t expect something more troublesome to happen \u2014 Song Yu\u2019s pursuers.Peiya\u2019s high school and junior high school departments were each split into two buildings. Two of the buildings had one open corridor connecting them on the third floor. Song Yu and Yue Zhishi\u2019s classes were coincidentally both in these two connected buildings, so it became very easy to cross school departments to look for someone.Many of Song Yu\u2019s pursuers weren\u2019t able to get a response from him, so they decided to take a more devious path \u2014 they added Yue Zhi\u2019s QQ and grabbed information that way. It could be seen as simply asking for help, but more than half of the people who ran straight to Yue Zhishi\u2019s class were his seniors. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know how to handle them at all.The night self-study session ended at 9:30pm. Everyone counted down the seconds until the bell rang and streamed out the door once the time came. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t follow them. High school\u2019s self-study didn\u2019t end until 9:50pm, so he slowly finished the question he was working on, slowly packed up and dawdled until he was the last person to leave.He pretty much did this every day.Yue Zhishi paused once he reached the corridor. He tilted his head and looked across to the fifth floor\u2019s high school class 3-5\u2019s room. Time slowly passed, and Yue Zhishi simply sat in the corridor and read some manga. The bell rang at 9:50, but the door for class 3-5 remained quiet.The advanced classes in high school were clearly very hard.Yue Zhishi ended up biking home by himself. Lin Rong was simmering some Chinese herbal pigeon soup, filling the entire house with fragrance. The little Pomeranian ran straight to Yue Zhishi as soon as he opened the door. He lifted the dog into his arms and said, \u201cCotton Candy, have you gained weight again? You\u2019re so heavy.\u201d\u201cIs it you, Le Le? You must be tired.\u201d Lin Rong dropped some rice cakes into the pot and scooped them into a bowl with the soup as soon they softened. She then placed some red centred dragon fruit slices into another bowl.Yue Zhishi sat on the carpet and raised his head to take the bowl of soup. \u201cWhere\u2019s Uncle?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s out of the country for some business. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be back until next week.\u201d Lin Rong caressed his head. \u201cHe said he\u2019ll bring home some presents for you.\u201dYue Zhishi happily swallowed a big mouthful of soup and almost burned his tongue.\u201cSlowly, no rush.\u201d Lin Rong placed the bowl of fruit next to him before returning back to the kitchen.He continued sitting on the carpet, legs curled under him. Yue Zhishi continued eating his bowl of rice cake soup while watching a variety show. Once he could see the bottom of his bowl, he heard the door open and immediately dropped it to crawl onto the sofa and look over.Song Yu placed his keys on top of the doorway cabinet and changed his shoes before walking in. The family cat leisurely raised its head from the noise, twitched its tail and meowed once before turning back over to continue sleeping.\u201cWelcome home. Hurry and come in.\u201dSong Yu entered the kitchen after hearing Lin Rong\u2019s words. Yue Zhishi followed behind him, whining about how he\u2019d lately turned into just a tool for others to exploit. \u201cThey all added me on QQ and then the first things they would ask were your QQ username and what was the answer to your mandatory friend request question.\u201d\u201cJust say you don\u2019t know it.\u201d Song Yu calmly drank his soup, his entire demeanour as if the situation had nothing to do with him.\u201cHow could I not know it? I\u2019d be lying,\u201d Yue Zhishi muttered to himself. The more he thought about it, the more he couldn\u2019t help but complain. \u201cThey don\u2019t even bother saying some pleasantries before asking after you.\u201dThe first half of his words was full of childish whining, and yet Song Yu found the second half a bit funny. \u201cYou even know the word \u2018pleasantries\u2019?\u201dYue Zhishi frowned, feeling as though he was being underestimated. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d\u201cOur Le Le\u2019s all grown up now. I still remember how he used to not know what sister-in-law meant,\u201d Lin Rong laughed. \u201cHe even said he wanted to be his own sister-in-law.\u201dSong Yu glanced at him before lightly moving away his line of sight.That was something from a long time ago. Yue Zhishi had started learning Chinese later than other children, and Chinese familial relationship terms were complicated to begin with. He had been utterly confused every time he heard his classmate talk about uncles, aunts or nephews. One day, he heard a classmate say he had a very beautiful sister-in-law. He had returned home and curiously asked Song Yu, what is a sister-in-law?\u201cA sister-in-law is the wife of your older brother,\u201d Song Yu had replied.Lin Rong just happened to be eavesdropping nearby. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to leave home once you have a wife.\u201dThat sentence gave Yue Zhishi\u2019s little heart a large shock.His small brain mused over it for a long time. If Song Yu gege married a wife and gave him a sister-in-law, then wouldn\u2019t they have to separate? He would have his own family and wouldn\u2019t be able to live together with him anymore.No way!Yue Zhishi hugged Song Yu\u2019s arm and cutely begged, \u201cXiao Yu gege, I don\u2019t want a sister-in-law.\u201dFather Song teased him. \u201cHow would that work? Your gege won\u2019t marry just because you don\u2019t want a sister-in-law?\u201dYue Zhishi replied innocently, \u201cThen I\u2019ll be your sister-in-law!\u201dYue Zhishi saw questions marks all over Song Yu\u2019s face and realised something wasn\u2019t quite right. He hurriedly corrected himself, \u201cNo no, I\u2019ll be my sister-in-law!\u201dFrom then on, that childish babble became part of Yue Zhishi\u2019s dark past in the Song family. Someone would occasionally pull it out, and every time, Yue Zhishi would have one of his rare fits\u00a0 of annoyance.Just like now.\u201cI was only five! Why bring it up again!\u201d He walked away as he complained. His movements were stiff, almost like a robot pretending to be angry like a human.\u201cTo be honest, it sounded like you wanted a childhood betrothal at that age.\u201d Lin Rong was too amused by Yue Zhishi and lay on her son\u2019s shoulder as she laughed. Suddenly, a scream came from outside the kitchen.Song Yu paused for two seconds before putting down his bowl and went into the living room. But there was only Yue Zhishi and Cotton Candy in his arms: \u201cHow come you look like this? Who let you steal my dragon fruit? Hm? Did you want to dye your fur?\u201dCotton Candy was originally as white as snow, but now his entire face was covered by rose coloured juice, his little grape-like black eyes blinking innocently at him.\u201cThere\u2019s no point looking at me. You can\u2019t just randomly steal things, what if it was something you couldn\u2019t eat? Do you want to go to the hospital? It\u2019s always so depressing to go to the hospital.\u201dJust a false alarm. Song Yu stood there, watching Yue Zhishi scold the little dog like a child pretending to be an adult. Every word from his mouth was too familiar.\u201cYou really make people worry.\u201d Yue Zhishi finished scolding with this sentence. But he soon cuddled Cotton Candy again, turning around and almost running into Song Yu.\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going,\u201d Song Yu said.Yue Zhishi slipped away into the bathroom, cleaning Cotton Candy up before taking a shower himself. His energy was finally depleted, and he laid down on his bed. His phone kept vibrating from the QQ notifications. He couldn\u2019t take it anymore and could only use the last remaining bits of his consciousness to reply to everyone, saying he himself didn\u2019t know the answer to Song Yu\u2019s friend request question. He wasn\u2019t allowed to give away Song Yu\u2019s QQ and if he did, he would be in big trouble.He really would get into trouble. He\u2019d done it before when he was younger.Yue Zhishi turned off his phone once he finished replying and immediately fell asleep. He dreamed about the one time in elementary school he\u2019d been convinced by an older girl to pass along a confession letter. He\u2019d ended up being ignored by Song Yu for an entire week, and this memory almost scared him awake.He rarely rejected girls on Song Yu\u2019s behalf, but it was very effective this time. He was left alone for a good few days.But he never expected that his refusal to help his seniors and the lack of interaction between Song Yu and him would cause the school to start spreading many strange rumours. They were born from the same mother but had different fathers, or he was dumped under their roof, etc. The rumours were more exaggerated than even some dramatic novels. And in the midst of all this gossip, there was one main topic \u2014 that the two brothers didn\u2019t get along.As the rumour kept spreading, it finally reached the ears of the person involved. Yue Zhishi felt like he was a little mouse crawling and tumbling around, falling from one grey pit to another with no end to his troubles. He explained again and again, but everyone refused to listen.After two math classes in a row, Yue Zhishi\u2019s brain was fully numb. He fuzzily took back his homework from the math class representative and took out a red pen to fix his answers. He started chewing on the end of the pen as he reviewed.\u201cI got the arc length wrong again\u2026\u201dJiang Yufan didn\u2019t even bother to open his assignment book. \u201cWe finally get to go to physical education class!\u201d He tugged at Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cMm\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi sighed. He suddenly tasted something sweet in his mouth and looked down at the pen he was just biting. It was leaking!Yue Zhishi immediately touched his mouth. His fingers came away covered with red ink.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jiang Yufan watched Yue Zhishi run out and was completely confused. He looked around for a while before seeing Yue Zhishi come out of the toilet, lips tightly pressed together and refusing to speak. The class bell was about to ring, so the two of them ran quickly to the sports ground. They managed to get there just in time.The class warmed up with some running. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t open his mouth the entire time, and once he finished running, he covered his mouth with a hand and told Jiang Yufan he needed to go to the toilet. Jiang Yufan seriously thought he had diarrhoea, so he didn\u2019t ask much before going to play basketball with the other boys.The girls in the class walked through the sports ground in pairs, heading towards the canteen in the cafeteria. They started chattering loudly at the sight of a boy, but Yue Zhishi simply couldn\u2019t care anymore. He was embarrassed and wanted to find a place to hide and scrub away the red ink staining his mouth.I\u2019ll just go home if I can\u2019t get it off.But I still need to open my mouth to request leave\u2026Let\u2019s just go to the toilet in the cafeteria. At least there\u2019s a mirror there.Decision made, Yue Zhishi covered his mouth and lowered his head, quickly pushing past the girls and leaving the sports ground. The artificial grass underneath his footsteps stubbornly stood back up after being stepped on, rustling in its movements.He kept moving forward, and in a moment of inattention, he accidentally bumped into someone. It was actually quite a heavy bump, so he quickly apologised. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it Le Le?\u201dThe voice sounded familiar. Yue Zhishi raised his head and saw Qin Yan, one of Song Yu\u2019s classmates since they were young. He could also be considered as Song Yu\u2019s only friend.Qin Yan looked at Song Yu. \u201cDoes your little brother plan on leaving his big eyes just for decoration? He doesn\u2019t use them.\u201dYue Zhishi wanted to retort, but he didn\u2019t want to open his mouth. He just shook his head.\u201cI saw you from far away and watched as you walked over step by step until you finally knocked into your brother here like a magnet. Good thing you didn\u2019t bump into poor weak me, or else I\u2019d be on the floor right now,\u201d Qin Yan teased, elbowing the expressionless Song Yu. \u201cRight?\u201dSong Yu lazily said, \u201cYou should go get checked if you\u2019re ill.\u201d\u201cNo way, I have to be our Le Le\u2019s loyalest cheerleader even if I\u2019m sick from the flu.\u201dSong Yu was holding a basketball, and Yue Zhishi guessed that he wanted to go play. If it was before, he would definitely want to stick to Song Yu, but he was too embarrassed right now and just wanted to run away. He lowered his head and said, very quickly, \u201cSorry, it was an accident, I have to go now, bye.\u201dYue Zhishi circled around and prepared to sneak away, but his arm was abruptly grabbed.A change in behaviour was always obvious.Yue Zhishi looked over and saw Song Yu\u2019s gaze move down towards his mouth. He looked at it for a little while before throwing the basketball in his hands to Qin Yan and started pulling Yue Zhishi in one direction without a single word.\u201cAh?\u201d Yue Zhishi stumbled after him. Once his brain caught up, he tried to tug his arm away, but he couldn\u2019t pull away. He could only keep his mouth closed and used his two arms to pull at Song Yu, body leaning backwards and trying to keep Song Yu from moving.Seeing him like this, Song Yu stood still. Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t fully open his eyes from the strong sun, and the few girls walking nearby all turned their heads to look at them.Song Yu suddenly opened his hand. Yue Zhishi was still leaning backwards, so he abruptly plopped onto the floor.Song Yu knelt down as well and took hold of Yue Zhishi\u2019s chin. His thumb and index finger squeezed Yue Zhishi\u2019s cheeks and forced open his mouth. He saw the teeth dyed with red ink.\u201cI knew it.\u201dYue Zhishi quickly closed his mouth, butt scooting backwards.So embarrassing.\u201cWhy are you running.\u201d Song Yu held his face and examined his mouth, pulling him up once he was done. \u201cAre you planning on going to class like this?\u201dSince he had been discovered, Yue Zhishi could only follow behind Song Yu in despair. Song Yu pulled him along like he was just a balloon.\u201cCan we walk slower? My butt hurts.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t say anything, but he did slow down a bit.The infirmary again.Yue Zhishi said in a small voice that he wasn\u2019t sick, but Song Yu didn\u2019t reply. He simply continued pulling Yue Zhishi into the room. The doctor in charge was somewhere else, and there was no one else around. Song Yu told Yue Zhishi to sit on the chair before he went next door to find someone. He came back with a bottle of medical grade ethanol and a box of swabs.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Yue Zhishi watched him as he dragged a chair over to sit in front of him.Song Yu held his face again and expressionlessly commanded, \u201cOpen your mouth.\u201dYue Zhishi listened obediently. His lips were fine, but his teeth and tongue were dyed completely from the pen\u2019s red ink. It was actually quite funny.Song Yu dipped a swab into the ethanol and carefully wiped at the areas with ink. Yue Zhishi had butterflies in his stomach \u2014 he was a bit worried that the ink wouldn\u2019t come off, and he would have to continue to attend class. It would be so hard to keep his mouth closed the entire day.He didn\u2019t know why, but he suddenly remembered how Cotton Candy stole the dragon fruit yesterday. He had to sigh: this pair of master and his dog really was related.The next moment, Song Yu unexpectedly laughed. The sound was very soft, light enough that Yue Zhishi thought he heard wrongly.\u201cYou really make people worry.\u201dThe author has something to say:The Song Yu brand of recording machine is #1 in teasing his younger brother.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 15": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8: My Childhood With YouHe repeated back to him what Yue Zhishi had said to Cotton Candy last night.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know what to feel. Was he laughing at him? He must be, right?But what Song Yu said wasn\u2019t wrong either \u2014 he really did make people worry about him.Yue Zhishi felt a bit sad thinking about it. When Song Yu reached out again with a swab, Yue Zhishi moved back a little and said softly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t respond to his apology. He only reached out his other arm to grab his chin. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201dYue Zhishi really did stop moving after those words. But his thoughts started to wander, and he thought about how in the past, no matter if he had won an award in the speaking contest or if he had been knocked down during a basketball game, Song Yu would\u2019ve never intentionally come up to him even if he was there. They had very seriously pretended to be strangers.So now, Yue Zhishi was actually the tiniest bit grateful to his sudden asthma attack during the school opening ceremony that day. It had forced them to expose their complicated relationship and allowed them to openly walk together in the light.Seeing him sitting there in a daze, Song Yu indifferently asked, \u201cWas it yummy?\u201dYue Zhishi was pulled from his thoughts and was convinced by this question that Song Yu was definitely laughing at him.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to suck up the ink.\u201d Yue Zhishi frowned.Song Yu was reminded of the one time they\u2019d gone to the dentist together. Yue Zhishi had eaten enough candy that his entire mouth was full of cavities, and Lin Rong had brought them to the dentist. As soon as he heard the sound of the electric drill, Yue Zhishi had opened his mouth and started wailing, refusing to let go of Song Yu\u2019s hand.Song Yu continued to clean and calmly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019d it taste like?\u201d\u201cLike a cantaloupe.\u201d Yue Zhishi continued describing it. \u201cIt was sweet at the beginning, but it started tasting a bit weird afterwards, almost like some fever syrup.\u201dHe managed to describe it so specifically.Yue Zhishi spat out some of the taste in his mouth into some paper. \u201cMaybe the ink makers predicted that some people would end up sucking the ink, so they purposefully made it taste sweet?\u201dSong Yu glanced at him. \u201cIf you\u2019d known earlier that pen ink was sweet, would we have not needed to take you to the dentist? If you\u2019d eaten this instead of candy, you wouldn\u2019t have gotten cavities.\u201dHe was being teased again, but Yue Zhishi completely missed the point. \u201cDid I go to the dentist when I was younger?\u201dUnbelievable \u2014 he\u2019d cried so much and yet he\u2019d completely forgotten about it. Shouldn\u2019t it have been something he remembered for his entire life?\u201cYour childhood memories really are quite blurry,\u201d Song Yu said.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t comment and held onto his wrist. His mouth was full of saliva, so his words were a bit unclear. \u201cSo what if they are. Don\u2019t you remember everything?\u201d\u201cSince my childhood was all yours anyway.\u201dSong Yu was slightly stunned.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t think he said anything strange, his two legs still moving about. His entire body wasn\u2019t able to sit still. Song Yu stayed silent, using a hand to press down Yue Zhishi\u2019s shaking knees, and carefully used the cotton swabs to wipe off the ink on Yue Zhishi\u2019s teeth.With his knees being held down, Yue Zhishi lowered his head and caught a glimpse of Song Yu\u2019s empty wrist. He wasn\u2019t wearing the watch he\u2019d given him.\u201cYou\u2019re not wearing your watch?\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t immediately respond, and Yue Zhishi continued, \u201cWhy not?\u201dThis way of repeatedly, straightforwardly questioning him reminded Song Yu of the time Yue Zhishi gave him the watch. When Song Yu had refused to take it, he\u2019d questioned him directly just like this.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want it?\u201d\u201cXiao Yu gege, you don\u2019t like it?\u201dYue Zhishi had been especially naive when he was younger. He\u2019d carried the gift box with the watch, looked at it and thought it looked quite nice. He\u2019d raised his head again and asked, \u201cDoesn\u2019t it look nice? I asked the lady at the counter to help me pick it out, and she promised you\u2019d like it.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that Song Yu hadn\u2019t liked it. To an elementary school student, he knew that the amount of money looked like a fortune. Yue Zhishi could\u2019ve entirely bought many things for himself and not spent the entire amount on a watch for him. Song Yu had also been very clear at the same time that it would be no use if he said these things to Yue Zhishi, who was a silly and stubborn little child.So he\u2019d decided to directly speak to the lady at the counter.\u201cHello, I want to ask for a refund. I haven\u2019t used this watch before, and the packaging and receipt are all here. I should be able to refund it based on this shopping centre\u2019s policies.\u201dThe lady clearly remembered the cute mixed-race child who\u2019d come alone to buy a watch. Now that his brother was here and carried himself with a maturity far beyond his peers to ask for a refund, it was hard to not marvel at the two of them.\u201cNo problem.\u201d The lady kept slightly smiling. \u201cCan I please see\u2026\u201dYue Zhishi was right in front of the counter, and he loudly yelled no before directly sitting onto the floor. He tightly held onto Song Yu\u2019s leg, crying and begging. At first, Song Yu refused to give in and brought out the receipts to give to the lady, but Yue Zhishi was crying so bitterly that the lady couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to discuss it with your younger brother?\u201dSong Yu thought for a bit before kneeling down. He took out a pack of tissues from his bag and gave it to him. \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d\u201cYou, you don\u2019t want my present,\u201d Yue Zhishi sobbed. The more he spoke, the more he felt wronged. \u201cI haven\u2019t even finished saying happy birthday yet when you, you\u2026\u201dSeeing that he was about to start crying again, Song Yu immediately said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want your present.\u201dYue Zhishi immediately hushed, his big eyes brimming with tears as he listened to Song Yu speak.\u201cIt\u2019s just too expensive. It\u2019s not good to spend like this.\u201dMaybe one day he\u2019d look back and regret spending his entire first pay check in one go.The tears continued rolling downwards. Yue Zhishi used the back of his hand to wipe them away. \u201cBut I thought about it for a long time. You all keep thinking I don\u2019t understand anything, but I do.\u201dHearing this, the counter lady standing by the side couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cIt\u2019s true. Even I thought your little brother was just playing around the first time he came. But he came three times and took a long time to choose. He didn\u2019t pay until the last day.\u201dHe\u2019d taken his money pouch out of his bag and carefully counted his money three times.The lady looked at Song Yu. \u201cHe was really cautious about it.\u201dSong Yu fell silent. He was still helpless in front of Yue Zhishi\u2019s loud tears, so he decided by himself to make the decision he thought was right. The watch was temporarily not returned. Yue Zhishi thought he tacitly agreed to accept the present and happily followed him home.Song Yu had sat at his desk that night in his room, the lustrous watch dial glimmering under the light of the desk lamp. He\u2019d looked at the price tag for a long time and decided to go back by himself the next day to return the watch.Wanting a cup of water before he fell asleep, Song Yu was halfway down the stairs when he saw Yue Zhishi nestled in his mother\u2019s arms, watching some anime with a lollipop in his mouth. He was pointing at the\u00a0Xiao Tiancai\u00a0ad playing on TV: \u201cThat watch isn\u2019t as nice as the one I gave gege, right, Aunt Rong?\u201d\u201cOf course! You bought the prettiest one, better than ten of those put together.\u201d Lin Rong patted his head and asked, \u201cLe Le, why did you buy a watch for your brother?\u201dSong Yu froze.Yue Zhishi had taken out the candy in his mouth and said very sincerely, just like a small adult, \u201cWe used to be together everyday, and I could find gege to play just by going down two floors. I really miss him now that gege is going to junior high in a different school. I want my watch to stay with him.\u201d He lifted his own empty wrist and laughed, \u201cSo whenever Xiao Yu gege looks at the time, he\u2019ll think of me.\u201d\u201cOur Le Le is so smart.\u201dSong Yu never thought that those kind of feelings had rested behind such big, wailing cries. He silently retreated, sat back down and put on the watch.He was clearly the one who never paid attention to these things, and yet every minute and every second were etched into his memories. When asked, he would be the only one who remembered.Song Yu couldn\u2019t tell anymore \u2014 between Yue Zhishi and him, who needed each other more.Engrossed in his memories, Song Yu was a bit careless and accidentally swiped the swab onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s gums. Yue Zhishi frowned from the burn and started moving away. Song Yu returned back to reality and pulled his chin forward. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t dare move and stayed motionless just like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered. He repeated his question again. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing it?\u201d\u201cYou ask a lot of questions,\u201d Song Yu said.There would have been only one question if you answered me the first time, Yue Zhishi thought.Song Yu\u2019s expression was extremely cold, his gaze concentrating on one particular area. Yue Zhishi thought of a horror film he\u2019d watched before, where a cannibal in it was just as graceful.Wait, this comparison was too strange. Yue Zhishi told himself to stop daydreaming and closed his eyes.The loss of his sight strengthened his other senses.He could very clearly feel each stroke of the wet swab \u2014 it was very light and slightly ticklish. The ethanol was very cooling. Maybe Yue Zhishi felt so differently because he was very aware that he wasn\u2019t sitting across from a dentist.He was leaning in very closely. He could smell the fragrance of the lemon citrus detergent wafting from Song Yu\u2019s collar. It was the same smell as his own, and Yue Zhishi subconsciously relaxed.But the taste of the ethanol really wasn\u2019t nice. Because Yue Zhishi\u2019s mouth was kept open for a while, his mouth kept producing saliva and mixed in with the medical grade ethanol.So bitter.Song Yu\u2019s hand suddenly stopped.Yue Zhishi obediently sat there with his eyes closed and waited for Song Yu to continue. But after a while of no movement, he suspiciously opened his eyes and warily garbled out a ge.Song Yu stuffed the ethanol and cotton swabs into his hand and stood up. \u201cThere\u2019s a mirror over there. Do it yourself.\u201dYue Zhishi pulled some paper, spat out the bitter saliva in his mouth and obediently followed his instructions. He knew doing this for him was a bit annoying, and he should\u2019ve done it himself earlier.He examined his teeth after he reached the mirror next to the window and found that the stains were pretty much completely gone.So cool, apparently even ink as stubborn as that could be dissolved.Yue Zhishi was never able to hide his moods, so the feelings of worship towards Song Yu started to show on his face.\u201cSo amazing. My uniforms are constantly being stained by pen ink. Can alcohol dissolve those too?\u201d He looked at Song Yu like he\u2019d just discovered a new world.Song Yu\u2019s right hand was holding onto his left wrist. He separated his hands when Yue Zhishi looked around, released a \u2018hm\u2019, and turned around to leave. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 wait for me.\u201d Yue Zhishi wanted to follow Song Yu but looking around him, he also wanted to put away the things they used. He hesitated for a second before deciding to clean up. By the time he walked out, Song Yu was already very far away.Yue Zhishi felt a bit lost as he looked at Song Yu\u2019s receding figure.He touched his chin, pinched it and kicked a little stone. He plodded away and didn\u2019t return directly to the sports ground, but went to the cafeteria\u2019s little supermarket and bought a bottle of Yakult.The ethanol had really been too bitter.Yue Zhishi stood in front of the supermarket holding the small bottle. He swallowed a big mouthful like an adult would swig a beer. He drank it too quickly and felt like he hadn\u2019t drank anything at all. He went back and bought another one, pushing through a straw, and walked back to the sports ground.When he went back, he found that Jiang Yufan wasn\u2019t playing basketball like he thought he would. He was looking around everywhere and coincidentally managed to meet Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes. Yue Zhishi nodded while holding his bottle and widened his eyes, hinting that he saw him too.Jiang Yufan immediately ran over, looking very anxious, and pulled at him. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you. Are you okay?\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head with the straw in his mouth and thought his expression was a bit weird. So he released the straw and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201dJiang Yufan quickly glanced around. \u201cSome of the girls in class just said they saw Song Yu pulling you over somewhere to beat you up. They described it so vividly.\u201dBeat me up?Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t had a chance to react when Jiang Yufan lifted a hand to open his mouth. \u201cI heard your mouth was bleeding too, let me see? Are all your teeth okay?\u201dWhat. Yue Zhishi escaped from his hands and finished his Yakult. \u201cHe didn\u2019t hit me.\u201dHow was there even blood. Yue Zhishi suddenly realised \u2014 when he was resisting earlier, he must have opened his mouth. The girls nearby most likely had thought the red ink in his mouth was blood.That was some strong imagination.\u201cI\u2019m fine. How could my brother hit me? It\u2019s just a misunderstanding.\u201d Yue Zhishi was afraid Jiang Yufan would continue questioning him and force him to reveal the embarrassing ink situation, so he quickly changed the topic. \u201cStill want to play basketball? Let\u2019s play together.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine then, I was just saying it didn\u2019t sound right.\u201d Jiang Yufan relaxed and yelled at some of the boys in their class nearby. \u201cBasketball?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go let\u2019s go, three on three.\u201d A classmate waved a hand at Yue Zhishi. \u201cLe Le, come on!\u201dYue Zhishi threw away his empty bottle while saying he\u2019d definitely hold them back but ran over quite happily.\u201cNo way, how would you hold us back!\u201d\u201cAre we splitting up into teams, I want Le Le!\u201d\u201cLe Le, I\u2019ll carry you!\u201dThe youthfulness and energy of fourteen, fifteen-year-old boys were like the bubbles in a just opened bottle of soda, constantly rising upwards with no way to push them back down. A few metres away, the very sick Qin Yan sneezed and slightly smiled as he rubbed his nose. He looked over and sighed with feeling, \u201cYour family\u2019s Le Le really is everyone\u2019s favourite.\u201dThe basketball dropped into the hoop.Song Yu landed on his toes and retracted his hand. His gaze swept over to where it was full of noise before returning back to look at Qin Yan. He didn\u2019t sound very friendly. \u201cYou talk too much.\u201d\u201cYo, who annoyed you.\u201d Qin Yan smiled foolishly and hooked his arm around Song Yu\u2019s neck. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been Le Le, could it?\u201d\u201cGive me back my watch,\u201d Song Yu said.Qin Yan\u2019s face was full of confusion. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me to hold it for you?\u201d He pulled it out from his pocket and passed it over. \u201cI was so confused, you would take it off every time you played ball. I thought it was some big brand. Who gave it to you? You treat it like your baby.\u201d\u201cMy baby gave it to me,\u201d Song Yu replied, face completely dead. He carefully put the watch back on.Qin Yan cracked up. \u201cXiao Song, you\u2019re too funny!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was a little gullible\u00a0and thought it would all pass after a little while. But others clearly thought more about it than he did, as everyone liked to gossip. Even though he kept explaining, after many days, the rumour of \u201cYue Zhishi was brought aside by Song Yu during physical education class and beat up until his mouth bled\u201d was still running rampant. He couldn\u2019t control it.His classmates all started to express their \u201ccare\u201d for him in many different ways. Some people gave him snacks and said he must be suffering a lot. Others directly painted Le Le as the modern day Cinderella.Yue Zhishi never stopped declaring that Song Yu was a very good older brother, but they all assumed that he simply had a good temper. Even the female classmates who asked him about his views on Song Yu during the school opening ceremony thought so.\u201cNo wonder you didn\u2019t want to answer and would only say good things about Song Yu.\u201d The girl suddenly realised. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise you were so scared of Song Yu.\u201dYue Zhishi usually had such a good temper that most people thought he had no bottom line.But his stubborn, most unbreakable bottom line was Song Yu, and he never allowed anyone to speak the tiniest bit badly of Song Yu in front of him. Song Yu treated him well, and it was an established fact in his heart.\u201cNo, he\u2019s a good person and isn\u2019t like the way you guys think. I\u2019ve said it so many times. He really didn\u2019t hit me, it was all rumours. He treats me especially well.\u201d Yue Zhishi spoke uncharacteristically seriously, tone obviously showing a bit of temper. He even stopped drawing cartoons and said to them, \u201cAnd also, it\u2019s not right to talk about others behind their backs.\u201dHis classmates were a bit scared by the way he acted. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking behind anyone\u2019s back\u2026 With the relationship between you two, if we say it in front of you, doesn\u2019t it equal saying it to his face too?\u201dYue Zhishi had no way to retort.A girl then curiously asked, \u201cIf he really treats you as well as you say he does, then how come he doesn\u2019t act like an older brother to you at all?\u201dAnother person also said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, he looks very nasty.\u201d\u201cOlder brothers generally always spoil their younger siblings.\u201d\u201cAnyway, I just don\u2019t like his personality. He doesn\u2019t have a sunny personality at all, even though he does look decent.\u201dYue Zhishi couldn\u2019t be bothered arguing with them. Song Yu said before, arguing pointlessly can make people look very stupid. He lowered his head and looked at the small figure he just drew. It didn\u2019t look right no matter how he looked at it, so he used his pencil and scribbled all over it.Jiang Yufan was carrying a clean mop into the classroom as he called out, \u201cLe Le, someone\u2019s outside looking for you.\u201d He came inside and said to the classmates still discussing, \u201cAre you guys bored yet. If you put the same amount of effort into studying as you did into gossiping, you guys would test into Peiya\u2019s high school department in a second.\u201dYue Zhishi looked over at the window. He could only see half of someone\u2019s body, but it was a very tall body and was wearing the white shirt from the high school department. Yue Zhishi was suddenly a bit excited and quickly ran outside.The smile on his face froze once he went out.\u201cYou\u2019re too obviously disappointed. Don\u2019t look around, it\u2019s just me,\u201d Qin Yan teased.Yue Zhishi weakly greeted this senior. He was actually very disappointed, so he fluttered his eyelids and purposefully asked, \u201cSenior, you shouldn\u2019t be here to ask me to confess to gege on your behalf, right?\u201dQin Yan laughed loudly. \u201cI can\u2019t decide who\u2019s funnier between the two of you.\u201d He gave Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder a pat. \u201cI\u2019ll stop teasing you. I wanted to speak to you about something serious.\u201dYou\u2019re not a proper person to begin with, what kind of serious thing can you have, Yue Zhishi thought.Male classmates were all loudly horsing around in the corridor. There were too many people around, so Qin Yan brought Yue Zhishi to the stairs.\u201cAfter last semester\u2019s high school senior graduated, our school broadcasting station has been missing an English speaking announcer.\u201d Qin Yan\u2019s voice was very nice to listen to, and he was the current stationmaster of the school\u2019s broadcasting station. There wasn\u2019t a lot of time, so he quickly told Yue Zhishi of his wish for him to join them.\u201cYou speak very well. You enunciated your words really nicely the last few times you attended the English poetry recital contest, and a few of your female seniors recommended you. What do you think? Would you like to try?\u201dYue Zhishi leaned against the wall and lightly tapped the back of his head against it. His answer had no relation to the question. \u201cSong Yu gege also speaks very well.\u201d\u201cHim? Do you think I can actually get that Buddha to help me?\u201d Qin Yan\u2019s expression clearly said: you think too highly of me, my little friend. \u201cBesides, the broadcasting station needs more junior high school students to join anyway. We broadcast your segment only once a week on Fridays. We might take away a bit of your eating time, but it\u2019ll only be about half an hour.\u201d He started quipping again, \u201cEnglish can be considered as half your native language anyway.\u201dHe only used it up until he was four years old\u2026 even that could be considered as his native language?Honestly, working at the broadcasting station wasn\u2019t quite appropriate for a junior high student in his third year. Yue Zhishi was temporarily lost in thought.Qin Yan was Song Yu\u2019s good friend, and he\u2019d often come over to their house for dinner ever since junior high. In Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart, helping Qin Yan was the same as helping his gege. He agreed right before the class bell rang.Once he got home that night, Yue Zhishi was telling Lin Rong all about it, but she mainly focused on how he wouldn\u2019t have time to eat dinner and wanted to deliver food to him. Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but remember the lunchbox bigger than his head that one time in elementary school, leading\u00a0 his classmates to all stare greedily at his fancy lunch. He shook his head and refused, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s too troublesome, no need to deliver some food. I\u2019ll just find some time to eat when I can.\u201dTheir orange house cat slowly walked past him, and Yue Zhishi touched its tail. \u201cRight, Orange?\u201dThis hurt Lin Rong\u2019s feelings, as it made her think Le Le didn\u2019t need her anymore now that he was grown up. Her overflowing motherly love had no way to express itself. She pulled Orange into her arms, but it lightly jumped out and turned around to display its butt at them. It proudly and elegantly stood in the middle of the coffee table.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Xiao Yu if he wants to bring dinner?\u201d Song Jin squeezed his broken-hearted wife\u2019s hand.Song Yu had just finished showering and was drying his damp hair as he walked out of the bathroom when he heard his father call his name. He had no idea what was going on and just looked at the three people in the living room.Lin Rong stretched out a leg and rested it on top of Song Jin\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make dinner for him, it\u2019s too hard. He can go find food himself.\u201dFather Song couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cSure enough, only Le Le is your child.\u201dSong Yu turned around to go upstairs, a towel lying on his head. \u201cA bunch of drama queens.\u201dQin Yan brought Yue Zhishi to observe the broadcasting station on Wednesday. The work was a lot simpler than he\u2019d thought, and his partner was a high school senior sister in her second year. Seeing that Yue Zhishi needed to start preparing for his high school entrance examination, the senior sister was responsible for all of the script writing, and Yue Zhishi only needed to read the script ahead of time and prepare.Yue Zhishi was a bit nervous the first day of broadcasting. In order to prepare for this live broadcast, he\u2019d practiced in the bathroom the night before for a very long time, worried that he\u2019d do something wrong. Once the bell rang and ended the afternoon\u2019s last class, he flew to the clock tower.\u201cRelax.\u201d The senior sister patted his shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll start the show together, and then you\u2019ll introduce the upcoming song by yourself. Then all you have to do is play the song.\u201dYue Zhishi solemnly nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201dAfter class ended, Song Yu was called out by a teacher and ended up talking for a while. He didn\u2019t have a chance to return back to the classroom before Qin Yan dragged him away.\u201cWhat did Old Wang call you for? He blabbered for so long,\u201d Qin Yan said.\u201cHe wanted me to help him with something.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s currently in charge of a junior school class, what\u2019s the point in getting you to help? It\u2019s not like you\u2019ll get paid. I\u2019m going to die from hunger, hopefully the cafeteria has some\u00a0pearl meatballs\u00a0tonight.\u201d Qin Yan tugged Song Yu through the open corridor and happened to see some boys downstairs in the garden. They were holding up another classmate to play a game of\u00a0Happy Corner.\u201cHey! Are you guys not eating?\u201d Qin Yan leaned against the railing and yelled down at the boys.\u201cHow boring.\u201d\u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d Qin Yan chuckled. \u201cAre they boring or am I? Speak clearly, don\u2019t be passive aggressive.\u201dMusic started coming out of the speaker in the garden downstairs, the melody lightly flowing into the bustling school campus. Seeing that Song Yu didn\u2019t respond, Qin Yan started to deliberately provoke him. \u201cYou have the right to remain silent, but anything you say can be used against you in court.\u201dThis guy really was hard to deal with.The music faded away, and someone\u2019s voice came out of the speaker, speaking fluent English. The pronunciation and tone were filled with gentle youth. \u201cGood afternoon, my name is Joy.\u201dSong Yu was pushing away the Qin Yan who was clinging onto him. \u201cYou\u2019re most boring\u201d was about to fall from his lips, but he suddenly stopped when he heard that voice.\u201cWelcome to our weekly Friday segment, The Sound of English. To start off the show, let\u2019s play a really catchy English song\u2026\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t move at all from where he stood. Qin Yan knocked his shoulder against him. \u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d He waved a hand in front of his face. \u201cSystem crashed?\u201dSong Yu knocked away his hand and glanced at Qin Yan. \u201cYou pulled him in?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Qin Yan shrugged and openly admitted it. \u201cLe Le\u2019s voice sounds really nice. I\u2019ve said it before, I wanted to steal him under my command before starting the graduation handover. What do you think? Not bad, right?\u201dSong Yu walked down the stairs by himself. \u201cHe\u2019s in third year already.\u201d\u201cJust this semester.\u201d Qin Yan chattered away, \u201cLook at how worried you are. Everyone else is saying you\u2019re bullying the poor child. What\u2019s the point in showing only me how much you care? You also need to let the public know.\u201dOnce they left the staircase, the view of the campus broadened. The sky on top of the sports ground looked like it was soaked with grapefruit juice, and the sun was softly orange as it hung next to the clock tower. The students on the sports ground held each other by the hand, talking and running around, their laughter melting into the song as it started playing.The first time live host must have forgotten to mute his microphone. He was more absorbed into the song than everyone else and even softly sang the last phrase together with the chorus.In the noisy, cheerful campus, everyone was busy enjoying their own precious leisure time. This small mistake passed by without making a single ripple, but it made waves in one person\u2019s heart.\u201cMy youth is yours.\u201dSong Yu stopped walking and looked at the clock tower, acting as if he didn\u2019t care at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t realise something was wrong until she pushed away the microphone.He kept apologising afterwards, but she didn\u2019t think it was a big deal.\u201cNot many people would\u2019ve noticed it.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s stomach growled just as they were taking a break after finishing half the session with another song playing in the background. The senior only then remembered that he hadn\u2019t yet eaten and said, \u201cAh, I forgot to remind you to bring some food.\u201d She took out her own dinner from her bag. \u201cDo you want to have some of mine?\u201dShe pulled open the lid. Translucent dumplings stuffed with lamb and carrot, stir-fried prawns and sour and spicy cold noodles laid inside the box \u2014 but he couldn\u2019t eat any of them. Yue Zhishi declined, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, senior. I\u2019ve already asked my desk mate to get me some food.\u201dShe thought he was just being polite, so she pushed a fork into his hand. Yue Zhishi had no choice but to admit that he was allergic to most of the food.He didn\u2019t tell her clearly what he was allergic to \u2014 Song Yu kept telling him again and again while they were at home not to tell other people the exact details of his possibly life-threatening allergy.\u201cI see.\u201d The senior sister backed down. \u201cI did see you that time during the school opening ceremony. It was so scary, good thing nothing serious happened.\u201dYes. Good thing gege was there, Yue Zhishi thought.When the segment finally finished, she stuffed an apple into his hand, Yue Zhishi gratefully taking it.There were only ten minutes left until the night self-study class started. Pretty much everyone was already in their seats, with only the rostered student for cleaning duties still sweeping the floor. Yue Zhishi rushed into his seat and breathlessly said to Jiang Yufan, \u201c\u2026I\u2019m exhausted.\u201dThe person in front of him, Hu Xuan, turned around. \u201cLe Le, we heard your live broadcast earlier!\u201d She gave him a thumbs up and said in English, \u201cNice!\u201dYue Zhishi was initially very happy, but then he slumped onto his desk. \u201cBut I committed a big mistake today.\u201d\u201cHah, we couldn\u2019t tell at all.\u201dA boy sitting in the third aisle interrupted and openly taunted, \u201cWho said we couldn\u2019t tell? I heard him. Yue Zhishi, did you purposefully keep the microphone on because you think you have a great singing voice?\u201dYue Zhishi was a bit confused by this direct attack. He usually had great relationships with people and would never have any grudges against anyone. He didn\u2019t understand where this came from.\u201cIgnore Zhang Chen,\u201d Jiang Yufan said. He rolled his eyes at that side of the room. He explained, \u201cHe\u2019s crazy. He\u2019s treating you like that because he likes a girl who likes you.\u201dYue Zhishi asked, \u201cThe girl in class 3-11?\u201dJiang Yufan\u2019s face was filled with disdain. \u201cYeah. Don\u2019t know how Zhang Chen found out about it. That guy kept running over to class 3-11 earlier and treated the girl like a goddess. Next thing he knows, she\u2019s confessing to you instead. It\u2019d be strange if he wasn\u2019t angry.\u201dYue Zhishi actually then turned to Zhang Chen and asked, very sincerely, \u201cWhy are you angry?\u201dZhang Chen widened his eyes. \u201cWhy am I\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you really hurt about it?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked.He was honestly very curious. Zhang Chen completely lost his tongue, and Jiang Yufan collapsed in laughter next to him.Hu Xuan helped Yue Zhishi annoy Zhang Chen. \u201cI can smell the lemon on you from here. So sour.\u201dZhang Chen was burning with rage. \u201cBullshit!\u201dThe class monitor slapped his desk and used his eyes to warn Zhang Chen. Seeing how angry Zhang Chen was, Yue Zhishi thought he must really like that girl and wanted to find an opportunity to explain that he didn\u2019t get together with her. Zhang Chen could still continuing to try.Besides, if this girl didn\u2019t work out, he could always find someone else to like.Jiang Yufan initially wanted to verbally spar some more but soon thought better of it. He turned around and whispered to Yue Zhishi, \u201cLe Le, I didn\u2019t end up buying that dinner bun you wanted even though I rushed over as soon as class ended. The store owner said they didn\u2019t have it today. But I bought this for you, dong dong dong dong!\u201d He pulled out a self-heating instant rice meal from his desk.Yue Zhishi was very surprised, but he kept his voice down. \u201cWhat is this\u2026\u201d He suspiciously lifted it up for a look. \u201cWon\u2019t Teacher Wang catch and kick me out of class with this?\u201dJiang Yufan raised his index finger and knowingly wagged it back and forth. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve heard from trustworthy sources that Old Wang won\u2019t be coming tonight. His car\u2019s not even at school anymore, and his thermos in the office is gone too.\u201d\u201cBut he said yesterday he\u2019ll be reviewing our papers.\u201d Yue Zhishi remembered very clearly.Once the bell rang, Hu Xuan turned around again and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s true. I think Old Wang has something important on today. I went to teachers\u2019 office earlier to turn in some homework and he wasn\u2019t there. Besides, look\u2026\u201dShe pointed at the podium. \u201cThe class monitor\u2019s already sitting there. Old Wang\u2019s definitely not coming in.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve also bribed the class monitor for you and asked him to pretend he doesn\u2019t see anything later.\u201d Jiang Yufan raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat do you think? Isn\u2019t your Fan Bro dependable?\u201d\u201cSo amazing.\u201d Yue Zhishi gave him two thumbs up before turning to look at the self-heating rice meal and its packaging. \u201cI\u2019ve never tried this stuff before.\u201d\u201cNeither have I, but it should be the same as those self-heating hot pot meals.\u201d Jiang Yufan shrugged. \u201cPour some cold water in it, and it\u2019ll start heating up by itself.\u201d\u201cCool\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi intently read the instructions. \u201cI\u2019ll find an excuse later to go the bathroom and eat while I\u2019m out.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, everyone else eats in the classroom.\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head. \u201cCan\u2019t eat in the classroom.\u201dThey fiddled with it for a while and poured in some water like the instructions said to do. Yue Zhishi waited curiously and expectantly for his meal. It came with Sichuan shredded pork with garlic sauce, so it should hopefully taste good.The bell rang again, and the class monitor sitting in front declared, \u201cTeacher Wang has something to do today, so he\u2019s not coming.\u201dThe class burst with happiness, not quieting until the class monitor told them to tone it down. Yue Zhishi cheered up a little bit by how everything was going according to plan.\u201cI\u2019ll come out for a bit later, so let me try it too.\u201d Jiang Yufan knocked his shoulder. \u201cI want to see what it tastes like.\u201dYue Zhishi gave him an OK sign. \u201cNo problem, one bite for you and one bite for me\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe didn\u2019t get a chance to finish his sentence. He choked completely into silence, because the one person he\u2019d never imagined showing up walked into their classroom.The girls in the class whispered in surprise.\u201cSong Yu?\u201d\u201cWah, it really is Song Yu.\u201dJiang Yufan also jumped in surprise and hit Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm a few times. \u201cShit, why is your brother here?\u201dSong Yu walked to the podium without any expression on his face, hands completely empty. The class monitor looked like he\u2019d known earlier Song Yu would be coming, because he easily left his spot and went back to his seat. Song Yu silently undid the first button on his shirt and slightly rolled up his sleeves.Yue Zhishi had no idea what was happening, his face completely unable to cover his astonishment. His nearby classmates looked at him curiously, acting like an audience waiting for the show to begin.Standing at the stage, Song Yu lifted his head and looked at his audience. \u201cTeacher Wang is busy tonight and isn\u2019t able to be here. Since everyone is getting ready to face the high school entrance exam, he asked me to come and share some of my studying tips and experience.\u201dHis words sounded quite professional. Song Yu\u2019s facial expression and voice were also quite indifferent, but the younger school sisters sitting below listened with excitement.Even though the school campus has never officially elected who the school idol was, Song Yu\u2019s appearance would stand out no matter where he was. Once his naturally distant and elusive air and his halo of perfect grades were added in, it became an unimaginably good thing to have this kind of close contact during the night self-study class.A girl in the first row raised her head and enquired, \u201cSenior, how come Teacher Wang asked you to come?\u201dSong Yu had a slight obsession with cleanliness and had a touch of OCD as well. His head was lowered as he straightened the chalk holder on the podium and didn\u2019t look up as he calmly replied, \u201cHe used to be my class adviser.\u201d\u201cThe same class adviser?\u201d\u201cWah\u2026 so cool.\u201d\u201cThen we\u2019re related!\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t expect that they would both have the same class adviser. That means Wang Qian would\u2019ve gone directly to advising his class after Song Yu graduated junior high.But then again, every time their parents showed up, Aunt Rong was in charge of him and Uncle Song was in charge of Song Yu. Song Yu never mentioned it, so of course he wouldn\u2019t know.Song Yu directly went into the main topic. \u201cWe\u2019ll focus on discussion for the first half of tonight. You guys can work on your homework for the second half, and if you need help, you can come and ask me.\u201dJiang Yufan coughed once, hinting to Yue Zhishi to look down. He passed his phone to him underneath their desks and showed him their class group chat without Teacher Wang. Pretty much all the classmates who\u2019d sneaked in their phones to class were chatting, new messages wildly and frantically popping up.[Is today the day the total level of our class\u2019s looks shoots up to the sky?!][Senior Song Yu really is too hot, no wonder he\u2019s a constant guest on the confession wall][You girls care too much for looks. You only know to look at hot guys, sheesh][What look only at hot guys, we\u2019re more excited looking at pretty girls than you guys are][@Joy Le Le, I still think you look better, we bros support you][Gonna be a good show.][@Joy Le Le did you already know he was coming?]How could he!?Jiang Yufan madly typed.[I can guarantee Le Le really didn\u2019t know. Both of us were thinking we\u2019d be stared at by the class monitor all night.]New content quickly bounced onto the screen.[I\u2019m so confused, he didn\u2019t tell you he\u2019d be substituting?][Song Yu wouldn\u2019t make things difficult for Le Le right?][Why be nervous if you didn\u2019t do anything wrong?]Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want to look anymore. He tilted his head away and just so happened to meet Song Yu\u2019s eyes. Song Yu often stared at people like a big cat, gaze cold and unfocused. Having met his eyes, Yue Zhishi quickly lowered his head, put away his manga and sketch books and pulled out his class notes, wanting to look like he was seriously studying.The class atmosphere was actually very quiet despite the group chat being fired up. Song Yu took a piece of chalk and started writing on the chalkboard.\u201cThere\u2019s less than a year left until your high school entrance exam. The study plans for the next two semesters may end up changing your class rank, so you should first create a goal for yourself according to your own situation.\u201dAs he spoke, there was a weird hissing noise, almost like the noise a small train would make. Pretty much everyone heard it and started looking around to see where it came from.The noise started getting louder and louder.Song Yu\u2019s hand paused on the chalkboard. But he didn\u2019t turn around, pretended he didn\u2019t hear anything and continued writing the things he wanted to write.Everyone else was looking over to where the noise originated from. That\u2019s right, the noise came from Yue Zhishi. Or more accurately, from the self-heating instant rice meal hidden in Yue Zhishi\u2019s desk.Jiang Yufan looked over at Yue Zhishi and mouthed the word \u2018shit\u2019. He then scribbled something on some scratch paper before pushing it to Yue Zhishi.[You can post in the TIFU forum now\u2026]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yue Zhishi whipped his head over to Jiang Yufan and mouthed, \u201cWhy is it making noise??\u201dJiang Yufan wildly shook his head. He gestured and said silently, \u201cI don\u2019t know either\u2026\u201dHu Xuan turned around and made the sign of the cross on her chest, giving silent tribute to Yue Zhishi.But it was almost as if Song Yu was completely isolated from the world. He didn\u2019t react and even finished drawing half a mind map on the chalkboard. The rest of the class behind him held back their laughter, mutely sitting in their seats with the sole accompaniment being the sounds from the rice bowl. They were like an audience in the Weiner Musikverein concert hall, their emotions rousing from the symphony.Not only that, this experience was 4D. Steaming hot mist and the smell of Sichuan shredded pork wafted from Yue Zhishi\u2019s desk.He\u2019d only wanted to secretly eat some dinner. But now, everyone \u2013 including Song Yu who was in charge of the class \u2013 knew he was preparing some food.Yue Zhishi completely gave up. He was already imagining the scene \u2014 he was going to be scolded and thrown out of class before being forced to kneel in the corridor to eat his cold meal.He felt like he was now someone who\u2019d seen the world. He could now go onto the Zhihu question boards and vividly answer the question of \u2018how did it feel to commit social suicide\u2019.Ten long minutes finally passed, and Song Yu turned around without any expression on his face. He placed the remaining half of the chalk stick onto the podium and said, \u201cThese are the things I\u2019ll talk about.\u201dThe sounds from the instant rice started changing, turning squeaky and breathless like a balloon letting out air. The noise started to slowly droop and fade away, just like Yue Zhishi\u2019s head that was low enough it was almost touching his desk.\u201cThe first part is to find your weakest area. You all know the bucket theory.\u201d Song Yu said, walking away from the podium.The students right in front of the podium hurriedly put away their cellphones row by row, but they continued looking at Yue Zhishi and waited for the show to start.The rumoured younger brother bully actually came to lead class and just so happened to catch his younger brother sneaking food. It wouldn\u2019t make sense if he didn\u2019t teach him a good lesson.\u201cSystematically sorting out your wrong questions is an effective way to study. Don\u2019t be afraid of making mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes. Only be afraid of constantly making the same mistakes. This could result in losing your class ranking points, so what you guys should do is try to reduce the frequency of making the same mistake.\u201dHe\u2019d already walked to Yue Zhishi\u2019s side by the time he finished speaking halfway and casually rested a slender hand onto his desk.He kept speaking smoothly and steadily, his topic going from how to correct wrong answers to tips on how to best gain points in mathematics, various ways like the substitution method etc. and etc. But Yue Zhishi, as an ostrich, couldn\u2019t absorb anything he listened to and could only hear his frantically beating heart.It looked like Song Yu was torturing him on purpose, choosing to speak right next to him and not moving away.\u201c\u2026and that is how you should choose your answers. Now, use the examination questions you have on hand to try out the method of answering multiple choice questions I just talked about. You have ten minutes.\u201d Song Yu finally looked down after he finished speaking. He gazed at Yue Zhishi who\u2019d been pretending to be dead and lightly rapped his knuckles against the desk.Yue Zhishi only then pitifully raised his head, his whole expression saying he knew he was wrong. He truthfully pulled out the instant rice meal hidden inside his desk.Song Yu raised an eyebrow and softly asked, \u201cDoes it smell good?\u201dHearing this, nearby classmates couldn\u2019t hide their laughter anymore.\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Yue Zhishi very sincerely replied. He then quietly added, \u201cOnly a little bit.\u201dJiang Yufan was an extremely loyal friend, and thinking Song Yu wanted to make things hard for Yue Zhishi, immediately explained, \u201cSenior, I bought it. I bought the wrong thing, blame me blame me. I\u2019m happy to write a self-criticism essay.\u201dSeeing that Jiang Yufan wanted to pull all the responsibility onto himself, Yue Zhishi opened his mouth and said, \u201cNo, I was the one who wanted to eat.\u201dZhang Chen wanted to rile things further. \u201cSenior, I saw the whole thing, it was Yue Zhishi who wanted it. They were acting suspiciously for a while, trying to look for ways to eat during class.\u201dJiang Yufan said angrily, \u201cAs if you can talk! As if you\u2019ve never eaten food delivery before during class. Besides, he wasn\u2019t planning on eating in the classroom.\u201dThe two of them started arguing. Song Yu\u2019s gaze swept across the laughing students, every one of them eagerly waiting for him to give out a punishment. He finally calmly opened his mouth.\u201cLet\u2019s take this chance to explain to everyone how the self-heating rice mechanism works.\u201dZhang Chen couldn\u2019t believe his ears. This was entirely different from all the punishments he was expecting.Song Yu held up the instant rice meal and, ignoring the students\u2019 whispered discussion, said, \u201cLook at this.\u201d\u201cThere is a self-heating package in the lowest layer of the self-heating instant rice meal. The package contains quicklime, sodium carbonate, a mix of magnesium alloys and other chemical reactants. Quicklime is also known as calcium oxide and reacts when it comes into contact with water. It then turns into calcium hydroxide and releases a lot of heat. Sodium carbonate helps with that, and the magnesium alloy powder can also release heat through oxidation. After we pour in water, the self-heating pouch will start reacting and automatically heat up the food.\u201dHe looked down, met Yue Zhishi\u2019s surprised eyes and continued, \u201cBut there is a possibility for this kind of self-heating fast food to explode. The included food are also often not fresh, so it\u2019s best to not eat it too often.\u201dSong Yu placed the package down once he finished. He turned around and pointed at the chalkboard. \u201cI\u2019ve already written down the related chemical equations in the lower right hand corner. You can look at it if you\u2019re interested.\u201dYue Zhishi gazed at the board. So Song Yu had already known what was happening earlier and directly, quietly added the chemical equations.At first everyone just thought the whole situation was funny and wanted to watch the liveliness. Everyone was a bit stunned at how the the \u2018social suicide\u2019 suddenly turned into a chemistry lesson. Amazingly, they had actually already learned the chemical equations before \u2014 they\u2019d just never connected the science to their lives.\u201cAfter this example,\u201d Song Yu said, leaning on the side of Yue Zhishi\u2019s desk, \u201cno one should forget that calcium oxide releases an exothermic reaction when it comes into contact with water.\u201dEveryone unexpectedly collapsed into laughter. Zhang Chen was a bit unsatisfied, so he raised a hand, the expression on his face distasteful. \u201cSenior, then why was there sound? It was too funny.\u201dThis clearly was to bring everyone\u2019s attention back to the moment the instant rice started hissing by itself.Song Yu rested on the desk and chose to not answer directly. He looked at the other students. \u201cYou guys should\u2019ve done some chemical experiments. Is there anyone who can tell me what kind of chemical reaction results in noise?\u201dA girl quietly said, \u201cSodium and water\u2026\u201dSong Yu nodded affirmatively at her. \u201cThat\u2019s a very classic example. Many other chemical reactions also release sound.\u201d He pointedly glanced at Zhang Chen. \u201cNothing surprising about it.\u201dZhang Chen\u2019s face quickly fell. He could tell that Song Yu\u2019s words carried a faint touch of disdain.\u201cOther than the reaction itself, the very act of releasing heat will also produce a large amount of steam. The reactions colliding with each other will then also produce sound. This whole process includes many other reactions such as galvanic cells, which you guys will have yet to learn.\u201dSong Yu lowered his head and gave him a look. \u201cI believe\u2026 if fellow student Yue Zhishi was clear about this from the beginning, he wouldn\u2019t have chosen to heat up his instant rice meal in a quiet environment.\u201dFellow student Yue Zhishi.Yue Zhishi felt this way of calling him was a bit strange, but somehow, it also gave him a bit of pleasure.Even though Song Yu was still icy and calm, he clearly wasn\u2019t trying to blame him. Every word was related to chemistry, and yet everyone could hear his secret intention to clear Yue Zhishi from any wrongdoing.Yue Zhishi suddenly thought, his anonymous reply to the social suicide question can finally be edited with a single sentence: \u201cI\u2019m alive!\u201d Actually, he could probably also reveal his identity.Just as he was dazing off, a wide hand suddenly descended on his head and quickly, lightly rubbed his fluffy hair. He didn\u2019t react in time when the hand disappeared from the top of his head, with one sentence drifting downwards.\u201cIt\u2019ll get cold if you don\u2019t eat it soon.\u201dThe head touch came too abruptly, stunning the rest of the students.The rumour of a terrible brotherly relationship self-destructed under Song Yu\u2019s rare intimate contact.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t even lift his head. \u201cI\u2019ll eat outside.\u201dHe went outside as soon as he finished speaking, hands and feet a bit clumsy.The toilets were to the right of the stairs. Seeing that there was no one around, Yue Zhishi went inside. The quality of the fast food was fairly average \u2014 the rice was hard, and the accompanying meat was a bit too salty.He sat there in a daze while chewing his food. After he gulped down a bite, he raised a hand and touched the top of his head in bewilderment before putting another big spoonful into his mouth.He\u2019d been hungry long enough that his hunger disappeared long ago. After what just happened, Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t really eat. He didn\u2019t leave after he finished eating though, remembering that Jiang Yufan said he wanted a taste. But Jiang Yufan has always had a short memory, and he still didn\u2019t appear after five minutes had passed.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want to dawdle for long, considering that Song Yu was still in class. He quickly cleaned up and returned, and when he arrived at the classroom door, Song Yu was standing at the podium discussing the best way to review their English lessons. Yue Zhishi stood at the entrance and reported his presence, not going directly inside.Once he heard his voice, Song Yu nodded at him and\u00a0 continued speaking as if nothing had happened.Yue Zhishi peacefully returned back to his seat and joined the rest of his classmates in listening. For the first half of the class, the Song Yu who didn\u2019t bring any learning materials spent only ten minutes drawing out his mind map before skilfully describing his train of logic to the class. His competent ability to explain his way of thinking overshadowed some teachers.\u201cWe only have a limited amount of time. We\u2019ll stop here.\u201d Song Yu leaned on one foot and looked at his watch. The first half of the night self-study session was almost over.\u201cYue Zhishi.\u201dYue Zhishi was a bit startled when he heard his name called. He immediately lifted his head and looked at his gege.Song Yu dipped his chin slightly towards the chalkboard. \u201cWipe it down.\u201dYue Zhishi obediently nodded. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, standing up.Ever since he was small, Yue Zhishi was most afraid of Song Yu ignoring him, especially after he did something wrong. If Song Yu scolded him, or gave him something to do that could be considered as punishment, it meant that Song Yu wasn\u2019t actually angry.Song Yu didn\u2019t speak at all when he was truly angry.Both of them understood each other very well.\u201cNo, don\u2019t wipe it yet.\u201d A girl taking notes lifted her head. She wasn\u2019t really paying attention earlier when Song Yu was lecturing, so now she rushed to copy everything down. \u201cI haven\u2019t finished yet.\u201d Other classmates chimed in, causing Yue Zhishi to hesitate.Song Yu coolly glanced at them. \u201cIf you can use your phones to chat, then you can also use them to take photos.\u201dEveryone was suddenly choked by this sentence, especially those who had just been chatting and gossiping in the group chat.The class bell rang, and Song Yu left the classroom. Yue Zhishi listened to him and went to clean the chalkboard, Jiang Yufan grabbing the other duster to help. \u201cWas that thing any good?\u201d\u201cIt was okay.\u201d Yue Zhishi looked at him. \u201cI waited for you for five minutes, but you didn\u2019t come.\u201d\u201cYou spent so much time waiting for me? I was wondering why you took so long. I totally forgot.\u201d Jiang Yufan rolled up his sleeves. \u201cThat stupid idiot Zhang Chen even snipped at you again, saying you didn\u2019t dare come back because you were too embarrassed. I was so annoyed. That guy couldn\u2019t get a girl so he decided to take it out on other people.\u201dYue Zhishi focused on wiping the board clean. He didn\u2019t really care about what people said about him when he wasn\u2019t there. \u201cHe\u2019s only going to be a bit mouthy for the next few days. If the person I liked ended up liking someone else, I definitely wouldn\u2019t be happy either.\u201d The arm busily scrubbing down away the chalk marks suddenly froze. His eyes stopped on the few lines of chemical equations in the corner.They were the last remaining bits of the cleaning duty Song Yu gave to him.\u201cDo you have your phone on you?\u201d He twisted his head to look at Jiang Yufan. He was clapping the dusters together.\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d Jiang Yufan directly offered it to him. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit late to think about taking a photo?\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t reply, quietly snapping a picture of the equations in the lower right corner.\u201cThanks. Just send that to me.\u201dThe author has something to say:The classmates waiting to watch a show: Why did you bring in a dog??Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He put down the duster and went to wash his hands at the bathroom. After cleaning his hands, he just so happened to bump into Song Yu, who was walking his way from the third floor\u2019s open corridor. His white shirt was glaringly obvious against a sea of blue.Song Yu was holding some mock exam questions and wasn\u2019t surprised to see him. He lifted his other hand and passed across a carton of cheese flavoured yoghurt.Yue Zhishi accepted it with both of his hands, eyes slightly widening. \u201cIs this for me?\u201d\u201cQin Yan wanted you to have it.\u201d Song Yu quickened his footsteps away after he finished speaking.Yue Zhishi suddenly remembered that Song Yu had been showering and hadn\u2019t been around when he told Uncle and Aunt Rong of his new work at the broadcasting station. He chased after Song Yu and asked, \u201cThen did you know that Qin Yan gege asked me to help?\u201dHe said the words \u2019Qin Yan gege\u2019 so sweetly and so obediently.Song Yu halted, and Yue Zhishi rammed straight into his back.So did he know or didn\u2019t he? He couldn\u2019t tell.\u201cAnd?\u201d Song Yu didn\u2019t even look around. His speech came quickly, and it didn\u2019t seem like he was in a good mood.\u201cAh? That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s it.\u201d Yue Zhishi started chasing after Song Yu again. \u201cCan I go home together with you tonight?\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t answer immediately. He didn\u2019t answer until just before he entered the classroom.\u201cGo home by yourself.\u201dYue Zhishi pressed his lips together in disappointment, following him inside.Everyone worked separately on their own tasks during the second half of the night self-study session. Song Yu sat at the podium and focused on his mock exam questions.At first, only one or two people dared to ask questions, but everyone soon realised Song Yu really was amazing \u2014 he only needed to look at a question once before giving out a concise and comprehensive explanation. It was very easy to follow his train of logic. More and more people started to head up to him, and of course, this included girls who were looking after their own selfish interests.\u201cHow come you\u2019re not going up?\u201d Jiang Yufan lightly tapped Yue Zhishi. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to line up to take numbers soon.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t bother to look up, seriously working on his physics homework. \u201cI can ask him anytime, no need to take the time away from everyone else.\u201d\u201cTrue.\u201d Jiang Yufan pondered over his words. It felt a bit purposefully benevolent, like an official wife generously giving the concubines time to spend with their husband.Yue Zhishi really did behave accordingly. He didn\u2019t go up to the podium even once during the entire rest of the session, and after he finished physics, he started working on his English assignment where he needed to fill in empty blanks in passages. He concentrated very earnestly, his face very low to his papers. His nose almost touched the desk.Song Yu passed back an assignment booklet after he finished explaining a question. When a different student came up to him, he glanced around the room before returning back to the student in front of him. His eyes caught onto the student\u2019s glasses, and the student looked quite shy.\u201cYour lenses are so thick,\u201d Song Yu carelessly said, lowering his head to look at the new question. \u201cHow many degrees?\u201dThe student who suddenly received this \u2018care\u2019 was a bit frightened by this attention, and cautiously pushed his glasses up his nose. \u201cWell\u2026 six hundred.\u201dSong Yu had already sketched out a rough guideline, writing out the main points on a scrap of paper. He didn\u2019t look like he wanted to explain further.\u201cPay attention to your posture.\u201d He returned the question back to the student.He glanced back again, and the Yue Zhishi who had been bending his head over his work was now sitting up, back as straight as if it was strapped to a piece of wood.The rest of the session finished very quickly, but a few students remained, wanting to ask questions. Even though Song Yu\u2019s face remained very icy, he still stayed for a little while longer.All the other students have all left for home, and Jiang Yufan had initially pulled Yue Zhishi away with him. But Yue Zhishi pretended that he was missing something, needed to look for it and told him to go first. There were less and less people, and after explaining the last question, Song Yu departed as well.He didn\u2019t say anything to him at all.But that\u2019s right, they weren\u2019t going home together anyway.Looking at the remaining students who lived on campus, Yue Zhishi hesitated for a second, but he decided to sit down and finish his remaining chemistry assignments. Whenever Yue Zhishi worked on his homework, he was particularly attentive; if there was a question he didn\u2019t know how to solve, his whole attention would be sucked in completely.\u201cLooks like it\u2019s going to rain.\u201d\u201cAh? I didn\u2019t bring an umbrella.\u201d\u201cClose the window first, otherwise all the desks in the fourth section will be wet tomorrow.\u201dHearing this, Yue Zhishi went up to help close the window. It was raining heavily outside. The rain in this city never knew how to transition, and would always start like a storm whenever it rained. Big droplets of rain pattered on the glass, the noise clattering away into the room.Leaning onto the window, Yue Zhishi gazed across to the high school building\u2019s bright third floor before going back to his seat and continued working on his questions. Dormitory students with umbrellas partnered up with those who didn\u2019t and prepared to leave, with one female classmate offering to lend her umbrella to Yue Zhishi. He refused, thinking it wasn\u2019t right for a girl to get rained on while returning back to her dormitory.He thought the sudden shower would quickly disappear, but contrarily enough, the rain grew stronger the longer it stayed.The never-ending pitter pattering of rain almost concealed the sound of the bell. High school\u2019s advanced class 3 tended to stay long past the end of class, with some live in students remaining in class until 11pm.Qin Yan twirled his pen. \u201cI really can\u2019t do this question. Hey Song Yu, can you look at this for me\u2026\u201d He leaned his head over just in time to see Song Yu already packed and ready to leave. \u201cWait, you\u2019re leaving so early today?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s raining.\u201dQin Yan was confused. \u201cIs it strange for it to rain here?\u201dLooking out the door and windows, Song Yu didn\u2019t reply. He could only see white shirts nearby. Qin Yan thought his expression was a bit unsightly and wanted to ask what was wrong, but Song Yu left before he could.The lights in the connecting corridor were still on, brightly leading the way to the dark junior high school building.Song Yu silently descended the building among the other high school year 3 students, the floor number changing from 5 to 4, then to 3. His footsteps slowed as he got closer, the people behind him shouldering past.Yue Zhishi sat with his legs straight out, the noisy rain blocking his awareness of his surroundings. It felt like he was in his own world. His brown hair softly reflected the light and looked like the softest part of the dark, rainy night.He touched the edges of the carton of yoghurt before carefully tearing off the cover in one piece. A layer of yoghurt remained on the plastic, almost like milk skin. He looked at it for a few seconds before he tentatively licked it.The yoghurt attached to the cover was always the tastiest bit.The usually light flavoured taste of the cheese spread in his mouth and was very sweet. Yue Zhishi used a straw and sucked up a large mouthful, his feelings of pleasure increasing with the rising levels of dopamine in his blood. He wanted to double check again to see if high school\u2019s class 3-5 were still studying, but when he looked over, Song Yu was already standing in front of him with an umbrella in his hand.Yue Zhishi froze. Traces of yoghurt were still smeared on his lips, making him look very silly.Song Yu stood there steadily, eyes a little cold. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dYue Zhishi clutched his carton of yoghurt and didn\u2019t know how to answer. It wasn\u2019t as if he could tell Song Yu he waited here every day.\u201cI\u2019m just waiting for the rain to stop and thought I\u2019d spend the time memorising vocabulary.\u201d He slowly drew back his long, straight legs. He\u2019d long rolled up the bottom of his pants in order to prevent them from getting drenched in the rain, pale narrow calves peeking out.Song Yu raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd if it never stopped?\u201dYue Zhishi watched as the transparent sheets of rain blanketed the edges of the corridor and said to himself, \u201cIt\u2019d eventually stop raining.\u201dHe stood up, pulling on the schoolbag on his back. He very weakly retorted, \u201cThen what are you doing here?\u201dDidn\u2019t you say you weren\u2019t going home with me?\u201cI left a pen in your classroom.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s face didn\u2019t change at all.Yue Zhishi believed him and immediately looked backwards. \u201cThen\u2026 we\u2019ll go back and get it?\u201d\u201cNo need, the rain\u2019s so heavy.\u201d Song Yu turned out. \u201cLet\u2019s just go home.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Yue Zhishi quickly took a few steps forward to stand shoulder to shoulder with Song Yu. \u201cThen can I bring it to you tomorrow after I find it?\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll definitely find it for you, I\u2019ll look for it early in the morning.\u201d\u201cI said there\u2019s no need.\u201dYue Zhishi made a sound in response and didn\u2019t continue. They went down the stairs, the rain gaining strength as time passed and making them unable to ride their bikes. Song Yu held up the umbrella, and they stood by the road and waited for a taxi.Taxis were always difficult to find during rainy days \u2014 they would either not come, or several would come all in one go. They found themselves in the former scenario. Yue Zhishi was a bit hungry despite having just finished the yoghurt.Speaking of yoghurt\u2026\u201cAh, that\u2019s right. Can you tell Qin Yan gege thank you for me?\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t say anything. It looked like he had a small piece of dry skin on his lower lip. Song Yu kept licking it and didn\u2019t look too comfortable.\u201cThat yoghurt he bought was really yummy, the cheese taste was strong.\u201dSong Yu still didn\u2019t speak.Yue Zhishi added in a low voice, \u201cBut it was a bit small.\u201dThe competent umbrella holding sculpture finally reacted, turning his head to look at him, and lightly opened his mouth: \u201cFollow me.\u201dAlmost as if he was afraid Yue Zhishi would refuse, Song Yu extended his hand out and grabbed Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm. The umbrella was very small and didn\u2019t quite cover the two of them together. Song Yu half pulled him into his arms as he walked into another direction and didn\u2019t drop his hand until he was sure Yue Zhishi was walking with him.\u201cWe\u2019re not going home?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hungry. Let\u2019s eat something first before going back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a bit hungry too.\u201d Yue Zhishi was a bit happy about finding a common topic. \u201cThat rice meal wasn\u2019t any good at all, I only ate a few spoonfuls.\u201dThey arrived at the school entrance\u2019s Grandma\u2019s Stewed Flavour as they were talking.This was the most famous restaurant near their school. The shop was completely full with no available seats \u2014 people could only eat while standing. There was often a crowd of people surrounding the front door. Grandma\u2019s Stewed Flavour was one of the city\u2019s specialty dishes: seaweed, lotus roots, dried and marinated beancurd sheets, quail eggs, beef tendons, duck intestines\u2026 All kinds of ingredients were pierced with bamboo skewers before being stuffed into a fully packed big pot. They were then slowly simmered and stewed over low heat in a fragrant, spicy broth, until the flavour soaked deeply into the food.Yue Zhishi stood by the window and swallowed. The grandma inside saw him and kindly said, \u201cIf you\u2019re here for a late night snack, we don\u2019t have much left, only these few skewers.\u201dSong Yu, holding up the umbrella, said, \u201cThen two portions of the marinated beancurd sheets and seaweed please. And one portion for everything else.\u201dThe grandma neatly scooped everything into a paper bowl, pouring over some of the broth before passing it to Song Yu. She also gave them two pairs of chopsticks and some napkins. \u201cIt\u2019s raining so hard, you should hurry and go home after you finish.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dPretty much all of the high school students had left by now, the flow of people ebbing from the initial dense stream to a sparse, gradual dribble. All kinds of umbrellas overlapped in front of the school entrance, dying the dark, rainy night with colour.Heavy rain tended to collide and knock over the usual rules of life. Teenagers running in the rain with their school skirts and pants wet, or shy souls squeezing together underneath the same umbrella \u2014 they were all woven together into the same tight net by the universal rain.Song Yu and Yue Zhishi were the same as everyone else. They stood side by side underneath the roof, and even their shadows from far away looked damp.Yue Zhishi very seriously focused on his food, to the point where he forgot everything else. He always ate his favourite marinated beancurd sheets first. When he thought about it, the ingredient was named very aptly: plain beancurd sheets were sliced into connecting links before being deep fried. They would then be crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. By the time they came out of the broth, little holes in the sheets would be filled with the soup, exploding in the mouth and filling the eater with satisfaction.\u201cSo good.\u201d The food was so hot Yue Zhishi needed to open his mouth and pant. After he swallowed the food in his mouth, he couldn\u2019t help but stuff in a mouthful of seaweed as well. The thick seaweed was soft, chewy and full of flavour after having been stewed for so long, and Yue Zhishi thought it tasted better than meat.Song Yu only ate a skewer of dried beancurd. Gullible Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t think anything was strange, happily eating until only one ham sausage skewer remained. He only then noticed he had eaten everything by himself.\u201cThis one\u2019s for you.\u201d He lifted the ham sausage and brought it to the corner of Song Yu\u2019s mouth. But Song Yu leaned his head slightly backwards and dodged his feeding.\u201cI\u2019m full.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Yue Zhishi placed the entire sausage into his own mouth.Their luck turned for the better after they finished eating, an empty taxi driving past just as they threw away their paper bowl.The taxi had the radio on, volume not very loud. The female broadcaster\u2019s voice was very gentle. After Song Yu sat inside, he touched his left shoulder. His hand came away entirely wet, so he used the napkins from earlier and wiped himself down a few times.He heard Yue Zhishi say, \u201cActually, today was my first time at the broadcasting station.\u201dThose words were a continuation of what Yue Zhishi left unspoken at the bathroom. With the way his thought processes jumped around, it was most likely only Song Yu who could easily understand what Yue Zhishi wanted to say.\u201cI know.\u201dYue Zhishi turned his head around to look him. \u201cWhat?\u201dHow could he have known, Yue Zhishi had never mentioned it before.Maybe it was Aunt Rong? Or maybe Senior Qin Yan.Song Yu absentmindedly replied, \u201cI heard you.\u201dYue Zhishi was suddenly so excited he leaned onto Song Yu\u2019s shoulder, just like a little dog who wanted to pounce on him. \u201cReally? You heard my voice?\u201dThe taxi driver glanced back at them through the rearview mirror. Song Yu pressed onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s animated head, said yes and told him to sit properly.Yue Zhishi was more delighted the more he thought about it. He\u2019d thought his gege didn\u2019t know about it at all, but he\u2019d actually heard the broadcast and could even tell it was his voice.He was now in great spirits, and even the song playing in the car was now especially nice to listen to.Song Yu turned his head to the side. The droplets of rain splashed onto the car windows, melting the bright lights of the city into a vague, dreamlike shape. The song lyrics mixed with the sounds of the rain, faintly rippling and flowing into the ears.[It wasn\u2019t the rainy day that was the most beautiful, it was the shelter I once shared with you in the rain.]\u201cWhat song is this?\u201d Yue Zhishi quietly asked Song Yu.No response came for a while. He pulled Song Yu\u2019s sleeve and curiously called out gege.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Song Yu thought about the title of the song and decided to lie.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The never-ending summer heat needed only one night\u2019s worth of cold wind before it abruptly disappeared in one day.Yue Zhishi woke up early and heard the whistling wind outside. He thought it was just the early morning\u2019s low temperature and didn\u2019t think much about it, rushing to school in a daze. By the time\u00a0 he finished two classes, the wind was much stronger than before. His body didn\u2019t have the ability to resist the sudden drop in temperature, so he kept sneezing repeatedly. The whole class went outside during a break, and Yue Zhishi followed with his arms wrapped around himself.\u201cYour body\u2019s too weak, my brother.\u201d Jiang Yufan hit his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s so cold, why don\u2019t you go home in the afternoon to get some clothes.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded, but then he shook his head straight after, suddenly thinking of something. \u201cIt\u2019s Friday. The senior sister at the broadcasting station can\u2019t come today, so I have to temporarily work with another new person. We have to rehearse later.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. I can bring you some of my clothes?\u201dYue Zhishi sneezed and rubbed his nose. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, might as don\u2019t go out. We don\u2019t have school tomorrow, I should be fine for just one day.\u201dJiang Yufan remembered something at this point. \u201cOh that\u2019s right, Zhang Yameng just said it\u2019s her birthday tomorrow and invited our entire class to go KTV. Are you gonna go?Zhang Yameng was the most well liked girl in their class. Her father worked in the food business, and even though she was a bit spoiled, she was always warm-hearted towards everyone. She could be considered as the class\u2019s favourite. Yue Zhishi was also eye-catching, so a few classmates would always joke about the two of them, Zhang Yameng looking as if she also enjoyed the jokes. It was okay if it was just once or twice, but after too many times, Yue Zhishi wanted to hide and run away.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi sneezed again, unable to finish his words.Coincidentally, Zhang Yameng was just walking over to them, and one skip brought her to Yue Zhishi\u2019s side. \u201cYue Zhishi! You have to come tomorrow, I booked a really good restaurant.\u201d Her two hands were clasped behind her back, and her smile was sweet and pretty. \u201cEveryone else already said yes. Our class can\u2019t miss even one person.\u201dYue Zhishi wasn\u2019t able to say anything in time before Zhang Yameng quickly informed him of Saturday\u2019s entire itinerary in one go, not leaving space for anyone to interrupt. At the end, she even slightly, cutely begged, telling him he definitely had to come.It was a bit difficult rejecting someone directly to their face, especially when she was inviting the entire class. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want to go so he didn\u2019t promise anything, and listening to the gym teacher\u2019s arrangements, he headed straight to the end of the boys\u2019 team.He\u2019ll just text and say he\u2019s sick tomorrow.The music started playing, and the students all did their warm-up exercises.The students in the high school department were in front of the junior high\u2019s department. He gazed through the entire mass of bodies, his sight unconsciously arriving at the front. He saw Song Yu also standing at the very end of his class and sighed in relief. At least gege was wearing his winter uniform.But he wasn\u2019t wearing the western, suit-like uniform. Instead, he wore the black and white gym uniform that was constantly being ridiculed, the clothes big and loose on him and making him look even taller and skinnier than usual.Other schools always envied Peiya\u2019s school uniforms \u2014 the students were given four different sets. Their summer uniform was a shirt and tie, and the additions of a knitted vest and a suit outer coat completed their winter uniform. They also had a set of gym clothing and a set of thick winter-wear. The two school departments were naturally different colours. But because of this abundance of choice, chaotically mismatching uniform sets could always be seen on Peiya\u2019s campus.And even though the gym uniform was loose and unfitting on Song Yu\u2019s tall figure, he still stood out much more than other students.After they finished their last exercises, the students were all dismissed. Yue Zhishi realised that the change in partners tonight had yet to be reported to Qin Yan, so he started walking towards the high school department, hoping to use this time to quickly notify him before going back to class.Qin Yan saw Yue Zhishi running over from far away and stayed where he was to wait for him. He even pulled at Song Yu.After the class substitution last time, the rumour of their bad brotherly relationship had completely disappeared. However, the story of Yue Zhishi eating a self-heating instant rice meal during night self-study and being caught spread very quickly. In everyone\u2019s hearts, Song Yu was a difficult person to get along with, so being able to cover up something so ridiculous during his own class substitution was already a sign of an incredible, earth-shaking brotherly relationship.Yue Zhishi used the least amount of words possible to explain his situation, worried he would be taking up their time. The cold wind rushed past, blowing his curly hair into disarray. Goosebumps formed on his skin, and he shrivelled up just like a frail little mouse.\u201cOkay, I understand.\u201d Qin Yan had sharp eyes. He saw a colourful bag peeking out of Yue Zhishi\u2019s pants pocket and reached out a hand to pull it out. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cSkittles. I bought it from the supermarket,\u201d Yue Zhushi said. \u201cI can give it to you if you want it, Qin Yan gege. The yoghurt from last time\u2014\u201d He sneezed again.Qin Yan\u2019s attention was entirely on the skittles. \u201cSo nice of you. I\u2019ll try a few pieces\u2026\u201d The bag in his hand was yet to be opened when it was snatched away by Song Yu. It flew through the air in a sharp parabolic arc before landing in Yue Zhishi\u2019s stunned hands.\u201cTry what? Time for class.\u201d Song Yu dragged Qin Yan away.\u201cSYU! You just don\u2019t want to see other people treating me well!\u201d Qin Yan was very unsatisfied at being dragged away, but he suddenly realised, \u201cHey, wait, what yoghurt\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so noisy.\u201d Song Yu frowned.Since the candy ended up not being given away, Yue Zhishi could only place it back in his pocket, rubbing the numb tip of his nose.\u201cYue Zhishi.\u201dHearing Song Yu\u2019s voice, he lifted up his head and saw Song Yu zip open and take off his outer jacket in one smooth motion. The coat was quickly thrown over his head, covering him just like a mousetrap, before Yue Zhishi could react.\u201cPut it on.\u201dYue Zhishi hurriedly pulled the coat down from his head, but he only managed to catch the sight of Song Yu\u2019s back. He lowered his head, sized up the jacket in his hands and held it a bit further away to look at it before finally putting it on. He pulled the zipper up to the very top.The sleeves were very long.He could only see half his hands.He swung the sleeves around as he ran back to the classroom, just like a little chick fluttering its wings. The black and white colour of the high school department\u2019s uniform was glaringly obvious in the crowd of blue. Once he was back in class, Yue Zhishi suffered through rounds and rounds of teasing, everyone saying words like \u2018I\u2019m so envious\u2019.But Yue Zhishi found that he inexplicably enjoyed this teasing.The vicious wind outside was just as wild as before, the strange, whining noises drilling through the gaps in the metal window frames. Yue Zhishi held up his face with his pair of sleeve-covered hands and silently listened to the sounds, suddenly finding the wind noises quite cute, almost like the cries of a small baby demon.In order to rehearse their lines, he only ate a bowl of clear, tasteless rice porridge during lunch. He met his partner in the cafeteria and went back to rest in his classroom after they finished discussing their upcoming session. After he slumped onto his desk, Yue Zhishi placed his head on top of his arms, his entire being wrapped in the faint detergent fragrance of Song Yu\u2019s jacket.They clearly used the same detergent, but why didn\u2019t it feel the same?Song Yu was different from everyone else.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t feel too well the entire day and almost sneezed at the microphone when broadcasting, but he luckily managed to endure until class ended. Once the bell rang, Zhang Yameng pulled at him and pretended to ask him questions about their homework. After her question was answered, she suggested heading out together. \u201cAre you feeling a bit uncomfortable? You\u2019ll definitely get sick if you ride your bike through the wind. My driver is outside waiting for me, I can take you home.\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head and distanced himself from her. \u201cMy home isn\u2019t the same direction as yours. It\u2019s very close by, I\u2019ll reach it after just a little bit.\u201dZhang Yameng kept insisting and even pulled on his arm. \u201cDon\u2019t be so polite, if it\u2019s close then it\u2019ll be even faster by car.\u201dYue Zhishi managed to take back his hand just in time to cough twice.\u201cI think it\u2019s meant to rain over the weekend. I don\u2019t want my bike to get rained on the next two days. Maybe next time.\u201d He quickly walked away.It really wasn\u2019t easy to ride his bike during a cold day. The wind kept puffing up his jacket, the cold air mixing with the smell of sweet osmanthus flowers on his body as he rode by. Yue Zhishi was dizzy by the time he got home and made a lot of noise changing his shoes. Father Song was doing some work at the kitchen island and looked back once he heard the noise. \u201cLe Le?\u201d\u201cUncle.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice was stuffy.Song Jin could immediately tell something was wrong. \u201cDid you catch a cold?\u201dWhen he saw Yue Zhishi come in wearing his son\u2019s uniform, Song Jin chuckled before returning back to his notebook. He said to himself, \u201cSong Yu does know how to act like an older brother after all.\u201d\u201cQuickly come and have some sweet soup. Your Aunt Rong\u2019s been simmering this red bean and dried tangerine peel soup all night.\u201dYue Zhishi took down an unfinished volume of shounen manga from the bookcase before sitting down next to Song Jin. The red bean had been stewed to a soft and smooth paste, the sweetness from the crystal sugar just right. The soup was at a comfortable temperature, and it warmed Yue Zhishi\u2019s entire body after just one mouthful. The baked rice cake was fluffy and soft with a slightly crunchy shell. After soaking it in the red bean soup, one bite would pull out the centre of the rice cake, sticky and chewy. Happiness burst in Yue Zhishi as he ate while reading his manga.He didn\u2019t make any noise, seeing as Father Song was busy. He ate silently and grabbed another bowl after he finished his first. There was a roasting platter on top of the kitchen countertop, and freshly roasted spicy pork jerky rested in it. Yue Zhishi took two pieces and returned back to the kitchen island with his bowl.Song Jin closed his laptop after he finished his work. \u201cWhat are your plans for the weekend? Do you want to come fishing at Liangzi Lake with me? Your Aunt Rong is coming too.\u201dYue Zhishi licked the red bean soup off his lips. \u201cIs gege going?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s too busy. He\u2019s making a speech tomorrow for the city\u2019s Best Three Students election,\u201d Lin Rong said, coming down the stairs.City\u2019s Best Three Students. Song Yu was the city\u2019s Best Three again. Yue Zhishi carefully chewed his jerky, his heart full of admiration. Song Jin wasn\u2019t aware of this at all and asked, \u201cThere are so many requirements to elect the city\u2019s Best Three Students now?\u201d\u201cYeah, I thought it was strange at first too, but I later heard from a friend that one of the children who won the award last year got in through different means and took up a spot.\u201d Lin Rong sat in front of them with her own bowl. \u201cThere was a child with better grades from their school who didn\u2019t get chosen. That child\u2019s parents were very unsatisfied and went to find the Department of Education. That\u2019s why the criteria this year is much stricter, and they even added this election speech requirement segment just in case.\u201dYue Zhishi immediately said, \u201cSong Yu gege will definitely get the award.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Lin Rong laughed and patted his head. \u201cBut it\u2019s fine even if he doesn\u2019t get it. Once you worry about winning or losing, it starts becoming too stressful.\u201d\u201cThen I won\u2019t go fishing tomorrow.\u201d Song Jin closed his notebook.Lin Rong held onto Song Jin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNo, your son has ordered that we\u2019re not allowed to come. We should just let him do what he wants.\u201d She then looked at Yue Zhishi. \u201cWhat are you doing tomorrow, Le Le?\u201dYue Zhishi was holding a small porcelain bowl and, hearing her question, let out a long hum and sighed, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cThis little guy looks very busy,\u201d Song Jin teased.Lin Rong curiously asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s got our little man all worried like this?\u201dWhile they were talking, they heard the door open and the very familiar sound of someone putting down keys. All three of them looked over.\u201cXiao Yu, quickly come have some sweet soup,\u201d Lin Rong called out. She then returned back to their conversation. \u201cWhat were we saying? Tomorrow\u2019s date?\u201d\u201cNot a date,\u201d Yue Zhishi decisively denied. \u201cA classmate invited the entire class to a birthday party.\u201dSong Yu left his schoolbag on the sofa and silently went to wash his hands in the kitchen. He then poured himself a cup of water before leaning back against the countertop, eyes looking at the three people at the kitchen island.Lin Rong wanted gossip, unlike a mother. \u201cBoy? Girl? Just a lunch?\u201d\u201cGirl, Zhang Yameng.\u201d Yue Zhishi replied without much care, brain full of other things. He knew Song Yu didn\u2019t like sweet things, so he extended out a hand and pointed at the pork jerky on the countertop. Song Yu turned around and looked at it, and when he turned back, Yue Zhishi was frowning and fighting to not sneeze.\u201c\u2026Uncle should know her,\u201d Yue Zhishi belatedly added.\u201cAh, Zhang Pengyuan\u2019s daughter. I saw him earlier during some business meetings.\u201d Song Jin drank some tea and casually said, \u201cYou should go, weekends are meant for relaxing.\u201dSong Yu slowly ate his piece of jerky with his head lowered. His eyes would occasionally glance upwards and meet Yue Zhishi\u2019s as he looked at him.As long as Song Yu was around, Yue Zhishi\u2019s line of sight tended to always circle around him, like a moon revolving around its planet. His light coloured eyes forever held the burning affection, feelings of worship, of longing\u2026 everything a younger brother would feel towards his older brother.Lin Rong was still teasing. \u201cIs Zhang Pengyuan\u2019s daughter pretty?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s quite beautiful,\u201d Song Jin said.\u201cReally?\u201d Lin Rong lightly smacked Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm and didn\u2019t have any of the strictness other parents would have towards their children\u2019s possible early dating. \u201cDoes she have any intentions towards our Le Le?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Yue Zhishi frowned. He got up from his barstool, put his empty bowl into the sink and softly said to Song Yu who was still leaning there, \u201cSong Yu gege, your jacket\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can just chuck it into the washing machine.\u201d Song Yu finished eating the piece of jerky in his hands and moved away from the little gap he and Yue Zhishi were in from the kitchen island. He said good night to his parents and went upstairs.Song Jin started joking around again. \u201cLe Le, don\u2019t learn from your brother, his mouth is closed tighter than a metal bottle bonded shut. It never opens. He\u2019ll suffer in the future when he meets someone he likes. You\u2019ll have to learn from me if you want to chase a girl\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Lin Rong also got up. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him brag.\u201d\u201cHow am I bragging? I put in so much effort when I chased you back then.\u201dYue Zhishi laughed and said he didn\u2019t want to watch their public displays of affection, turning around to go upstairs. He happened to notice the schoolbag Song Yu left on the couch, and a small light immediately lit up in his heart. He ran to pick up the bag, stomped up the stairs and excitedly went to knock on Song Yu\u2019s door as if he found some treasure.If someone\u2019s mood could materialise into reality, there would be a little wagging tail on Yue Zhishi\u2019s butt right now.He lifted his hand and lightly knocked twice with no reply. He knocked twice again, and there was still no one opening the door.Yue Zhishi could faintly hear the sound of water running from inside the room before it seemed to stop. He stuck his ear onto the door, his entire body leaning onto it, and wanted to carefully listen to the movements inside. But the door suddenly opened in an instant, and Yue Zhishi fell over, body completely unbalanced.He fell directly into someone\u2019s arms.Song Yu had just finished showering and was only wearing a bath towel. His hair was still wet, droplets of water dripping from the tips of his hair onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s forehead. Yue Zhishi was startled awake by the water drops and sprang away from Song Yu\u2019s body.\u201cXiao Yu gege, your schoolbag\u2026\u201dYue Zhishi looked fairly calm, but he\u2019d unconsciously gone back to his childhood nickname of Xiao Yu gege as a reflex, instead of the full name he now used after growing up.Song Yu took his bag and quietly said his thanks. Yue Zhishi had lost his train of thought, the words he wanted to say before coming upstairs entirely forgotten. He only wanted to run away and didn\u2019t know why. It\u2019s not like they haven\u2019t showered together before when they were younger.Even though that was a very, very long time ago.\u201cGood night I\u2019m going back to my room now.\u201d Yue Zhishi had just lifted his legs to turn around when Song Yu grabbed the collar at the back of his neck, almost as if he was lifting a small chick.\u201cWait.\u201dYue Zhishi obeyed and faced him, standing straight.Song Yu gestured with his chin. \u201cMy jacket.\u201dYue Zhishi subconsciously lifted a hand to the zipper at the front of the jacket as soon as he heard Song Yu\u2019s words, but then he paused. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say to just put it in the washing machine?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re at my door already, may as well just take it off,\u201d Song Yu calmly said.Yue Zhishi made a noise of understanding and pulled off the sports jacket. He then flipped it over Song Yu\u2019s torso, pulling both sides of the shoulders to hang just right, and covered Song Yu\u2019s entire upper body.Song Yu frowned. \u201c\u2026What are you doing?\u201d\u201cWorried you\u2019ll catch a cold.\u201d Yue Zhishi sneezed once and then quickly escaped.The author has something to say:There\u2019s not a lot of twist and turns in this novel\u2019s relationship development, maybe just some sweetness and bitterness at the same time. Don\u2019t scare yourself thinking there\u2019ll be large amounts of knives! I also haven\u2019t included a \u2018breakup and then reunite\u2019 tag, but a side CP (very little scene time, will show up only occasionally) will soon show up with a little bit of pain (this storyline is from my first novel, and you\u2019ll see Song Yu\u2019s POV).This is a slice of life novel, so story beats won\u2019t be very fast. I wanted to write about the trivial little things in growing up and going through puberty. You can\u2019t rush it. Little Jade is a very cat-like person, he doesn\u2019t like getting close to people and likes to say one thing but do another. He\u2019s a bit tsundere, but he\u2019s the person who treats Le Le the best.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His slight cold from yesterday still lingered, and he coughed for a while after drinking some milk. He listened to Lin Rong\u2019s urging and took some flu medicine. After a little while, Song Yu came downstairs and departed after eating some pieces of shaomai. Yue Zhishi immediately left the kitchen once he heard the front door close.\u201cAunt Rong, I\u2019m leaving now too.\u201dLin Rong hurriedly came out. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat some more? Or are you guys going to a fancy place for lunch?\u201d She noticed Yue Zhishi\u2019s deep black zip up hoodie and facial mask and said, \u201cDarling, are you going to someone\u2019s birthday party or to a fight?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to be late, can\u2019t talk!\u201d Yue Zhishi gathered all of his stuff and ran out as fast as he could.This city\u2019s breakfast culture was engraved deep into each person\u2019s bones \u2014 it was always busiest during the early morning. No matter what street or alleyway, there would be breakfast stores of varying different sizes and their endless stream of customers waiting for their favourite meal.Small shops didn\u2019t have much space to begin with, so naturally there weren\u2019t many rules on where to sit or stand. People casually stood on the street with their bowls of food, chatting while they ate. Students rushing to go to class would even hold a bowl of dry noodles or beancurd and eat while they walked, finishing their meal right before they got onto their buses or trains. That was their unique ability to survive.Passing through a street full of smoke and chatter, Yue Zhishi finally saw Song Yu at the streetlights.Maybe because he needed to make a speech, he wore a formal black shirt tucked into his pants with the cuffs half rolled up. His long legs and narrow waist were even more obvious in this outfit, making him particularly conspicuous in the crowd.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want to attend his classmate\u2019s birthday party to begin with, so once he knew Song Yu needed to make a speech, there was almost no way he would\u2019ve attended the celebrations. But since Song Yu had refused to let even his parents come along, there was no way Yue Zhishi would\u2019ve been allowed either.So Yue Zhishi had no choice but to stoop to secretly following him. The venue should be full of people anyway, and there was no way Song Yu would be able to find him hidden in the midst of so many people.The light turned green, and the two people walked forward with ten metres of distance separating them into the subway station. Initially Yue Zhishi had worried Song Yu would call a taxi, but thankfully Song Yu decided to take public transport \u2014 or else he would\u2019ve been like one of the actors in the movies and have to tell his taxi driver to follow the car in front of them.Yue Zhishi managed to cram into the train carriage right behind Song Yu\u2019s at the very last moment. He hid behind an old man\u2019s head and peeked at Song Yu, the old man curiously following his gaze before turning back to look at him with a face full of suspicion.Yue Zhishi pulled up his hood and took half a step back. He then pulled out his phone and changed his cover from just hiding behind the old man to pretending to be another office worker browsing on his phone.The city\u2019s Line 2 carriages were all decorated with girly pink colours. Even the poles were pink, so Song Yu standing in the train with his black clothes had a very strange sense of subversion around him, like his own natural barrier isolating him to the rest of the world. Yue Zhishi kept looking over and didn\u2019t realise that he himself was also standing there with his own black clothes.They were pretty much two obvious little black dots in the midst of pink bubbles.The bubbles burst when the two little dots needed to exit. The older one was in front, with the younger one hid behind crowds of people as he followed. They got off at a subway station with many exits and just as many people. When going up the stairs, a young mother was in front of Yue Zhishi, and she was carrying a large backpack, one hand pulling an even larger suitcase and the other pulling at a three or four-year-old child. There were several times she needed to pause and rest.\u201cAh really\u2026 excuse me, please let me through.\u201d A white collar office worker behind them said a few words, clearly annoyed, and detoured around the mother to keep rushing upwards.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The young woman pulled her child closer and turned sideways. \u201cYou guys can go first.\u201dYue Zhishi was initially very far back, but he had followed those hurrying to leave and had quickly climbed the stairs until he finally reached the young mother. \u201cLet me help you.\u201d He directly lifted the suitcase and walked next to her. The young mother kept thanking him, and the child was also very cute, little face leaning over to say thank you.The stairs were very long. By the time Yue Zhishi reached the top, put down the suitcase and looked ahead, he already couldn\u2019t find Song Yu.Damnit, I completely forgot about following him.In his field of vision, people were hurrying about, the entire area in a panic. Yue Zhishi stretched out his neck and looked all around him, but was completely unable to find even Song Yu\u2019s shadow. He tried walking forward a little bit and turned around in circles again and again until he unexpectedly reached a chain milk tea store near the subway station exit. There was a lost and found counter next to the store, but unfortunately he didn\u2019t lose anything. There was no staff at the counter either.He\u2019d just lost the person he was following.Guess there was no way he can watch the speech now.Yue Zhishi tried very hard to cheer himself up and not let himself get too disappointed. Sweets were great at making people feel better, so he decided to buy a cup of milk tea before going home and pretending this trip was an early walk.\u201cWelcome, what would you like to order?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi looked at the menu. \u201cGreen milk tea with pearls and coconut jelly, half sugar.\u201dAfter he ordered, he reached into his pants pocket only to find it was empty.It seemed like he left his cellphone on the couch.Seeing the shop assistant was already busying around with his order, Yue Zhishi frantically searched his entire body, hoping he accidentally left some money in these clothes the last time he wore them.But no matter how he searched, his pockets were empty. At this very moment, he wished a big hand would appear behind him, pick him up and wildly shake him around just to have something fall out.The shop assistant pushed his milk tea towards him with both hands. \u201cHi, here\u2019s your milk tea.\u201d\u201cAh, thank you.\u201d Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know whether he should take the drink or not, his hand pausing in midair.A slight smile appeared on the shop assistant\u2019s face. \u201cHow would you like to pay today? Cash, Alipay or WeChat?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s ears started to heat up. It looked like he was seriously pondering his options, but in reality his entire brain was evaluating the possibility he would be allowed to return home to get some money before coming back. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cWeChat.\u201dA familiar voice came from behind him.He abruptly turned his head and saw Song Yu holding out a barcode on his phone, face cool. After he scanned his barcode, he took the milk tea, pushed through a straw and drank a big mouthful. He then turned around and left, acting as if Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t exist at all.\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi circled around him. \u201cMy milk tea\u2026\u201dSong Yu frowned slightly, stopped and looked at the cup of milk tea in his hands with a bit of dislike. \u201cSo sweet.\u201dIs half sugar still considered sweet. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t make a noise and only watched as Song Yu extended out his hand and pushed the milk tea over. Yue Zhishi immediately took it with both hands and closely followed behind him. \u201cHow come you\u2019re here?\u201dSong Yu pointed at the counter next to the milk tea store behind him. \u201cLost and found.\u201dYue Zhishi glanced over quickly before immediately turning back. He saw Song Yu raise an eyebrow and ask, \u201cWhy were you following me?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s words were momentarily caught in his throat. But he\u2019s never been able to hide anything from Song Yu, so he said, \u201cI just wanted to come have a look. I wouldn\u2019t have bothered you before going home by myself afterwards. You didn\u2019t let Uncle or Auntie come, so you definitely wouldn\u2019t have let me come with you either. I had no choice but to secretly follow you.\u201d He then said in a small voice, \u201cBesides, you didn\u2019t even tell me.\u201dThey left the station together side by side, the bright sunlight falling onto their bodies and causing Song Yu to squint. \u201cTell you what?\u201d\u201cThat you were participating in the city\u2019s Best Three election speech.\u201d Yue Zhishi took a sip of his drink. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t find out.\u201dSong Yu calmly said, \u201cI don\u2019t notify people who have prior engagements.\u201dYue Zhishi felt like Song Yu\u2019s words held a double meaning, but his first reaction was to deny them. \u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d He got a bit angry at the reminder and stubbornly, straightforwardly continued on, \u201cI didn\u2019t say I would go. Song Yu gege, you always misunderstand me, just like last time at the school infirmary\u2026\u201dA bicycle raced past the sidewalk where they were walking. Song Yu\u2019s eagle eyes saw the bike coming and swiftly grabbed Yue Zhishi\u2019s forearm to pull him towards his body in order to dodge the danger.\u201cI know.\u201d Song Yu let go of his arm. \u201cWatch the road, you little social butterfly.\u201dSong Yu was mocking him, right. He has to be.Just as Yue Zhishi was about to explode from anger, Song Yu said, \u201cNext time you stalk me, make sure you bring your cellphone.\u201dSong Yu gazed at the faraway traffic lights and stepped forward when the lights changed colour. \u201cI won\u2019t look for you if you get lost again.\u201dHearing the word \u2018again\u2019, Yue Zhishi\u2019s anger completely disappeared.When he was five-years-old, he once followed Song Yu to the park to play. He had wanted to eat some ice cream, so Song Yu had gone with him to buy some for him. A man selling balloons had passed by, hand holding a bunch of beautiful balloons. A fish-shaped balloon had caught Yue Zhishi\u2019s attention, and he\u2019d followed behind that man. By the time Song Yu finished paying and turned around, Yue Zhishi had completely disappeared.If Song Yu hadn\u2019t found a park worker to broadcast Yue Zhishi\u2019s name, it was unknown if Yue Zhishi could\u2019ve been found.That experience taught Yue Zhishi the fear of getting lost and being alone. But he didn\u2019t actually know what kind of memory it left for Song Yu.He only remembered that when the park worker held his hand and brought him to meet his gege, Song Yu\u2019s face was still wet from his tears.That was the first time, and only time, he saw Song Yu cry.The city\u2019s Youth Association Auditorium was chosen to be the venue for the day. Workers sat at the entrance to check people in, everyone lining up to enter. A pair of parents accompanying their daughter stood in front of Yue Zhishi.\u201cWe\u2019re her family. Yes, we\u2019re her mom and dad.\u201dAfter they left, the worker looked at the two of them, staring especially at Yue Zhishi\u2019s face for a few seconds.Song Yu produced his identification, and the worker nodded before pointing at Yue Zhishi. \u201cAnd this is your\u2026?\u201d\u201cFamily member,\u201d Song Yu said.Yue Zhishi thought about that pair of parents. They were the real family, and he actually couldn\u2019t be considered as part of Song Yu\u2019s. But it felt like there was no better way to describe him \u2014 if Song Yu said he was his younger brother, that even narrower description would fit even less.The worker\u2019s face was slightly suspicious, but he nodded his head anyway and gave Yue Zhishi an observer pass. \u201cAfter you go in, the volunteers will lead you to your seat.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dYue Zhishi sat in the back, surrounded mostly by parents. His presence was particularly noticeable.After Song Yu helped settle him in, he prepared to leave the spectator seats to head towards his own area. Yue Zhishi saw two people appear behind Song Yu, both of them good-looking. The one on the left was especially handsome, and two small tiger teeth peeped out when he smiled. He looked particularly bright, his good lucks and aura completely opposite of Song Yu.That person soundlessly walked to Song Yu\u2019s side and bumped his shoulder with his own. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a while!\u201dSong Yu looked over, face unmoving. \u201cXia Zhixu.\u201d He then glanced further backwards and noticed the refined and clean looking boy standing next to Xia Zhixu. He nodded, and the boy returned the same motion.They greeted each other so peacefully.\u201cYou and Xu Qichen both came. Jingjian took up two spots with one class?\u201d Song Yu asked.\u201cDon\u2019t recklessly accuse people~ Qichen and I split up in 2nd year, he\u2019s humanities stream and I\u2019m science stream. If other people heard what you said, they\u2019ll think our Jingjian High was shady,\u201d Xia Zhixu said, holding familiarly onto Xu Qichen. \u201cBut we were in 1st year last time I saw you in the high school basketball tournament, so it makes sense you don\u2019t know about us separating.\u201d He moved his gaze to Yue Zhishi after he finished speaking, his face still carrying a smile.Yue Zhishi could feel the interest in that gaze. He stood up from his seat. \u201cHi, senior.\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Xia Zhixu looked at Song Yu and waited for a response.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t wait for Song Yu to reply and mimicked what he said earlier. \u201cI\u2019m his family member.\u201dHe sneaked a look at Song Yu right after, but he couldn\u2019t catch anything from his expression.\u201cFamily member?\u201d Xia Zhixu found something funny in those words and didn\u2019t refrain from laughing until Xu Qichen nudged him with an arm. \u201cSorry, my thoughts just went a bit skewed. It\u2019s just that the two of you don\u2019t look similar at all. This little brother should be mixed, right? He\u2019s so pale, and his eyes are so pretty.\u201dHe looked at Song Yu as he spoke, words probing. \u201cMaternal cousin? Or paternal cousin? Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s a child from your next-door neighbour.\u201d\u201cI live with his family,\u201d Yue Zhishi rushed to answer. But his thoughts were still stuck on the part of the conversation he didn\u2019t understand, so he frankly asked, \u201cWhat skewed thing did you think of?\u201dSong Yu gave him a look, and Yue Zhishi added a \u2018senior\u2019.\u201cWell\u2026 you know.\u201d Xia Zhixu attempted to change the topic of conversation. He quickly looked at Song Yu before turning to say to Xu Qichen, \u201cIt would be great if I had such a cute little brother. I\u2019ve always wanted one.\u201dYue Zhishi said he wasn\u2019t Song Yu\u2019s little brother, but unexpectedly, no one responded. The silent Xu Qichen suddenly spoke to Xia Zhixu, \u201cMe too.\u201dThe topic of little brother seemed to be unavoidable. Yue Zhishi gave up trying to explain.Xu Qichen looked at him with a slight smile on his delicate, pretty face. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t said your name.\u201dYue Zhishi kept thinking this older brother\u2019s eyes were quite hazy, almost like those characters in manga with sad backstories. His brain hunted for a better description for a few seconds. The word \u2018melancholy\u2019 seemed more appropriate.Seeing how Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t immediately respond, Xu Qichen introduced himself again and even reached out a hand. This was quite serious to Yue Zhishi, as there weren\u2019t many 3rd year high school seniors who would introduce themselves like this to a junior high school student.He immediately held his hand and honestly confessed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I got a bit distracted just then.\u201d He then replied, \u201cI\u2019m Yue Zhishi.\u201dXu Qichen lightly repeated his name, the smile in his eyes growing deeper. \u201cGood rain knows the right season.\u201d\u201cI like that verse too, but I wasn\u2019t born while it was raining,\u201d Yue Zhishi said.Song Yu glanced at him.You weren\u2019t born while it was raining, but you arrived here in the rain.Xia Zhixu interrupted them. \u201cYou really need to stop analysing people like you always do. If I have to say,\u201d he said, pointing at Yue Zhishi. \u201cYou two are \u2018stones from other hills\u2019,\u201d and then pointed at Song Yu, \u201c\u2018may polish jade\u2019!\u201dYue Zhishi widened his eyes. It felt as if he understood something incredible and was very happy about it.\u201cWhat are you babbling about.\u201d Song Yu used the upcoming speeches to stall Xia Zhixu\u2019s follow-up teasing, and the three of prepared to leave, leaving behind Yue Zhishi who was still enjoying Xia Zhixu\u2019s words.\u201cJust sit here. Don\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d Song Yu said before leaving.Yue Zhishi sent them off and then returned to his seat. Xia Zhixu and Xu Qichen walked very closely together, arm brushing against arm. They looked like the popsicles he used to eat when he was younger, two sticks stuck together needing to be split in half before they were willing to separate.He looked at Song Yu again. He was the one solitary stick left by himself after being split in half.The election speeches weren\u2019t as exciting as he imagined. Everyone simply went up the stage and said the things they prepared. The city\u2019s Best Three were all very talented students, and this included Xia Zhixu and Xu Qichen. One spoke with a natural, sunny disposition that tended to be well-liked, and the other spoke slowly and gently, encouraging the audience\u2019s desire to continue listening.But in Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes, Song Yu was different from everyone else as soon as he went up. He couldn\u2019t say where he was different \u2014 it just felt that even the lights from the stage naturally gathered on his shoulders.The examination committee sitting below the stage didn\u2019t have many reactions. Once the final student finished their speech, they informed the students that the results would be released within two weeks.The whole process took up the entire morning. Yue Zhishi\u2019s legs were a bit numb from sitting so long, and his throat wasn\u2019t too comfortable either from forcing down the sounds of his coughing.It was close to 11:30am. The audience slowly dispersed, and Song Yu walked towards him from the front with the other two boys from before.It suddenly began to rain heavily outside, and all four of them didn\u2019t have umbrellas. No one could stay in the venue, so Xia Zhixu suggested heading across the street to eat in the Japanese restaurant in order to possibly wait out the rain.\u201cWe\u2019ll rush ahead first!\u201d Xia Zhixu took off his outer jacket and very naturally covered Xu Qichen\u2019s head with it, his hand pulling Xu Qichen into his arms and holding onto his shoulder as they rushed into the rain.Watching this entire process, Yue Zhishi was strangely hypnotised and wanted to imitate those actions. He unzipped his hoodie, took it off and gave it to Song Yu.Song Yu frowned and looked like he didn\u2019t understand his movements. \u201cWhat is this for?\u201d\u201cTo be like them.\u201d Yue Zhishi gazed at him, his tone pure and simple. The look on his face said, I have a jacket too, I can block the rain for you.\u201cWe\u2019re not like them.\u201d Song Yu stood under the roof and didn\u2019t stretch out his hand to take the hoodie.\u201cWhy?\u201d A childish naivety unintentionally appeared in Yue Zhishi\u2019s large eyes. He attempted to understand the reason for Song Yu\u2019s refusal. \u201cIs it because they\u2019re friends, and we\u2019re brothers?\u201dSong Yu took the hoodie and grabbed Yue Zhishi\u2019s arms to pull them through the hoodie. He then even adjusted the hood to sit nicely on top of Yue Zhishi\u2019s head. His right hand slid down the top of Yue Zhishi\u2019s head, before the back of his hand stopped at his forehead for two seconds.\u201cThey\u2019re not friends. We\u2019re not brothers either.\u201dThe author has something to say:Xia Zhixu and Xu Qichen are the main characters in my first novel (\u00a0BE Crazy Demon Survival System\u00a0). You don\u2019t have to read it to understand this novel, they only cameo and provide an important assist to the gong. They don\u2019t have many scenes, and even those scenes are pretty sporadic. (But in saying that, in this chapter they\u2019re still in the hotly crushing on each other phase in their relationship)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15: Special FriendshipYue Zhishi noticed, from a very young age, that Song Yu always tended to say things he couldn\u2019t understand.And he would always try his best to figure out the true meaning behind Song Yu\u2019s words no matter how many times it happened. This time, he was fully lost in his thoughts as they looked through the menu to order, and Xia Zhixu, who was sitting across from him, had to call his name several times to catch his attention.\u201cWhat?\u201dXia Zhixu chuckled. \u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head. \u201cI just had a milk tea.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Xia Zhixu looked down at the menu. \u201cThen I\u2019ll have two lemon-lime cokes. This\u00a0daifuku\u00a0looks pretty good, let\u2019s have one portion. And this\u00a0castella cake\u00a0and\u00a0matcha red bean dorayaki\u2026\u201dSong Yu stopped him. \u201cAre you here to eat Japanese food or dessert?\u201dXia Zhixu held onto the menu and laughed. \u201cXu Qichen has low blood sugar, so he\u2019s really good with sweet things. I\u2019ve gotten into a habit after eating with him so many times, sorry, sorry.\u201dHe then passed the menu to Yue Zhishi. \u201cLe Le, is there something you want to try? The ramen here isn\u2019t bad.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s allergic to wheat so he can\u2019t eat wheat noodles.\u201d Song Yu glanced over the menu and, deciding by himself, picked out some items he thought Yue Zhishi wouldn\u2019t mind out of the things Yue Zhishi could eat.\u201cThat\u2019s so sad.\u201d Xia Zhixu counted all the things he could think of that was made of wheat. \u201cThen you can\u2019t even drink beer.\u201d\u201cUnderage people obviously can\u2019t drink.\u201d Xu Qichen poured a cup of barley tea and sent it over to Yue Zhishi before he looked at him with a slight smile. \u201cThe daifuku doesn\u2019t have any wheat in it. It\u2019s a glutinous rice flour skin wrapped around some fruit and cream. You might like it.\u201dYue Zhishi smiled as well. \u201cYes, I like glutinous rice.\u201dActually, Yue Zhishi quite liked these two seniors even though they weren\u2019t from the same school as him. This may have been their first meeting, but their words, even the way they looked at him, didn\u2019t contain any excessive curiosity or intention to probe his moods. Their interactions with him were balanced very delicately, and it let Yue Zhishi feel very comfortable around them.The server brought over two lemon-lime cokes with a pair of glass cups with ice. Xia Zhixu thanked her, and rather than giving Xu Qichen a glass immediately, he started pouring all the ice in one into the other.Xu Qichen looked very unsatisfied by his actions, but he only expressed his dissatisfaction by frowning at Xia Zhixu.\u201cI can leave you a piece?\u201d Xia Zhixu turned his wrist and slid a remaining piece of ice backwards, the glass tinkling as the ice fell back down. \u201cYou should drink less cold things since you\u2019ll be eating spicy stuff later. It\u2019ll be bad if your stomach started hurting.\u201dXu Qichen didn\u2019t respond. After Xia Zhixu finished speaking, he poured the soda into the glasses and then placed the glass with one piece of ice next to Xu Qichen\u2019s hand.Yue Zhishi watched them the entire time, his heart a little puzzled and uncertain. He wasn\u2019t even sure why he was puzzled. He had friends, like Jiang Yufan, and he had seen friends interact with each other before too. But there was something different about the two people in front of him.It felt like there were transparent pieces of silk between them tying them together. Fingers to fingers, mouths to mouths, eyebrows to eyebrows \u2014 there was nowhere the silk didn\u2019t touch. The strings twined along their bodies so that if one person moved, the other\u2019s whole body would move with him.So strange. But compared to this intriguing relationship, Yue Zhishi thought it was more unusual for him to even notice it.Xia Zhixu took a sip of his coke, and his face squeezed together from the sourness of the lemon-lime. He looked at Song Yu. \u201cYou did pretty well on the mid-semester entrance exam. I heard your math score was super high.\u201d\u201cIt was okay.\u201d Song Yu started talking to him about their studies while Xu Qichen quietly ate his bowl of ramen.A server brought over a platter with six different types of grilled sushi. Yue Zhishi picked up a piece of Song Yu\u2019s favourite sweet shrimp sushi and placed it into his bowl, while he himself ate a piece of avocado sushi. The finely sliced avocado was decorated with soy sauce and salad dressing, and it covered the firm and sweetly sour rice ball. Even though it was vegetarian, there was a smooth and milky flavour to the avocado after being torched by a flame gun. It carried a slightly burnt caramel taste, melting away after entering the mouth.\u201cIs it good?\u201d Xu Qichen asked.Yue Zhishi nodded while chewing. Seeing Xia Zhixu also pick up a piece for Xu Qichen, he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll understand after you try it. Eat more.\u201dXu Qichen then said, \u201cLe Le eats his food really well.\u201dYue Zhishi swallowed the food in his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m allergic to so many things. I already have less to eat than other people, so I have to seriously enjoy what I\u2019m eating, and eat more of it, so I don\u2019t end up with less than other people.\u201dSong Yu sipped his tea. \u201cEven gluttonous people have their own reasonings.\u201dXia Zhixu actually quite agreed with Yue Zhishi\u2019s way of thinking and touched his cup to Yue Zhishi\u2019s in a cheer. His tiger teeth peeped out with his smile. \u201cI like this reasoning. People who respect and enjoy delicious food are all especially cute.\u201dSong Yu poured a cup of hot tea again and pushed it to Yue Zhishi to drink it. But he wanted to leave space in his stomach for food, so he responded with a few noises and left it until it was half cold. Song Yu ended up drinking it for him before pouring him a new cup. \u201cIf you don\u2019t drink this one, you\u2019re not allowed to have a single bite of dessert.\u201dYue Zhishi had no choice but to swallow his mouthful of\u00a0crab meat tamagoyaki, lifting the tea cup with both hands to finish it with small sips.\u201cYou\u2019re so fierce as an older brother.\u201d Xia Zhixu gave Yue Zhishi a piece of grilled foie gras sushi. \u201cLe Le, eat this one with a slice of apple. It\u2019s pretty yummy.\u201dYue Zhishi said thank you and ate the piece according to Xia Zhixu\u2019s suggestion. He usually didn\u2019t like eating animal livers and would also refuse to eat foie gras in Lin Rong\u2019s restaurant. In this sort of situation, he felt it wasn\u2019t quite right to refuse. But once he ate it, the taste in his mouth was completely different from what he expected.The foie gras was very soft and buttery, almost like a dense piece of heavy cheesecake. The taste of animal fat mixed with black pepper and rock salt resulted in a very rich, full flavour, and the slice of apple managed to reduce the greasiness very well. When paired with fresh, tangy rice, it was surprisingly very delicious.\u201cSo good.\u201d Yue Zhishi lifted his head to smile at Xia Zhixu, eyes bright.\u201cSee, I didn\u2019t lie to you.\u201dSure enough, preconceived biases can often create missed opportunities and regret.As he focused solely on eating, the three high school 3rd year students moved on from the election speeches to talking about the university entrance examination. It looked like this was also an unavoidable conversation topic.Hearing them talk, Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but interrupt. \u201cSenior Xia, do you know what you want to study?\u201dXia Zhixu slightly moved his head in thought after being asked this sudden question. \u201cI actually quite want to learn computer programming. As to where I want to study\u2026\u201d He leaned onto Xu Qichen\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ve already agreed I\u2019ll go where he goes. We should be going to Beijing.\u201dXu Qichen put down the\u00a0chawanmushi\u00a0in his hands and softly smacked aside Xia Zhixu\u2019s head on his shoulder. \u201cWho agreed with you.\u201dYue Zhishi noticed his ears were turning red.He looked over at Song Yu. \u201cWhat about you, Song Yu gege?\u201dSong Yu lowered his eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it.\u201dAssorted types of tempura was brought out to them, the entire basket crispy and fragrant. Deep fried shrimp, crab legs, pumpkin, squid and mushrooms\u2026 Yue Zhishi wanted to stuff everything in his mouth just by looking at them. Freshly deep fried food was the best in today\u2019s cold and damp weather, but sadly this Japanese restaurant used wheat flour as their tempura coating. He couldn\u2019t eat a single piece.Xia Zhixu laughed after he heard Song Yu\u2019s response. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t at least a third of your Peiya\u2019s students go overseas to study every year?\u201dSong Yu said, \u201cNot that much.\u201dXu Qichen also asked, \u201cAre you going overseas? Are you also preparing for overseas entrance exams?\u201d\u201cNothing\u2019s finalised yet.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s answer was very unclear.Hearing the word \u2018overseas\u2019, the Yue Zhishi who had been suffering from not being able to eat the tempura became even more depressed. So Song Yu could possibly go overseas for university? How many years did overseas universities take to complete? Did that mean Song Yu could only come back during school holidays? How many days of vacation would he have in one year?In just a few short seconds, he imagined himself going through high school alone by himself, while Song Yu attended university parties overseas.\u201cWhy are you zoning out? Not eating anymore?\u201d Song Yu asked.Yue Zhishi shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m still eating.\u201d He gave Song Yu a piece of shrimp tempura, while he took a small portion of seaweed with his chopsticks.\u201cLe Le\u2019s about to start high school, right?\u201d Xu Qichen asked.\u201cCome to our Jingjian,\u201d Xia Zhixu wheedled. \u201cOur cafeteria\u2019s fantastic.\u201dBut Yue Zhishi said, \u201cPeiya doesn\u2019t do remedial classes, and we have lots of activities outside of class.\u201d\u201cTrue, I wouldn\u2019t want to do remedial classes either.\u201dYue Zhishi thought, no matter which high school he went to, he would have to separate from Song Yu anyway no matter where he went for university. They wouldn\u2019t be able to see each other every day, and if Song Yu really did go overseas, several years would pass with Yue Zhishi not knowing when he\u2019d be able to see Song Yu again.He became unhappier the more he thought about it, until he finally couldn\u2019t eat. It\u2019d been raining for at least two hours by now, and it looked like it was clearing up. Xia Zhixu didn\u2019t allow anyone else to pay the bill, saying he must have Song Yu owing him a meal and would find another opportunity to have this debt repaid. Song Yu didn\u2019t reject him either and stood at the back with Yue Zhishi to wait for them.His line of vision unconsciously moved forward. Song Yu saw Xia Zhixu leaning on the front desk, Xu Qichen standing beside him and only centimetres away. Their two hands were hanging next to their bodies, and the back of their hands seemed to graze against each other\u2019s, fingertips almost interlocking, before they separated the next moment. Xia Zhixu rubbed his hand against the seam of his pants and then very unnaturally, with difficulty, stuffed his hand into his shirt pocket. Xu Qichen\u2019s fingers curled into the palm of his hand, and then he moved back a little, his face falling.Song Yu moved his eyes over and looked at Yue Zhishi. He would usually have a face full of satisfaction after he ate some delicious food, but he was so dispirited today. Song Yu thought for a while, and then opened his mouth, saying, \u201cThe tempura today was pretty average.\u201dYue Zhishi lifted his head, his pair of big eyes shining clear and bright under the store lights.Song Yu also said, \u201cWe still have the rice flour from last time. Let\u2019s make some tempura at home tomorrow.\u201dIf this has been in the past, Yue Zhishi would definitely smile and say okay with a face full of expectation. But today, even though Song Yu said it so openly, Yue Zhishi only nodded and faced the glass doors to look at the street outside.Song Yu frowned, but the other two returned after finalising the bill. Xia Zhixu even teased, \u201cSeeing how you have to suffer so deeply being here, let\u2019s go.\u201dOne pair of them lived in Hankou, and the other pair lived in Wuchang. The direction to each place was different, so they left each other after entering the station. Song Yu led Yue Zhishi onto the right train to go home. There were a lot less people on the subway compared to before, but there were still no available seats. Song Yu looked for an empty grab handle after they got in and told Yue Zhishi to lean against one of the nearby poles.The train started to move, the advertisements outside the window flashing past at a speed dazzling to the eyes. Yue Zhishi gazed at his and Song Yu\u2019s reflections in the glass window. Their height different was more than half a head.Yue Zhishi silently wondered, weren\u2019t mixed race children meant to be tall? Why couldn\u2019t he grow past Song Yu? There was already an unremovable difference in their ages, and now it was the same with their bodies.\u201cWhy do you keep dazing off?\u201d Song Yu lowered his head to look at him. \u201cYour face is so depressed. Are you thinking my speech was terrible and I\u2019ll be eliminated?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Yue Zhishi immediately looked up. After drying from the rain, his hair was curlier than usual. Under the carriage lights, it looked like soft down.Song Yu raised an eyebrow and waited for him to speak further. Yue Zhishi blinked, then asked while looking at him, \u201cSong Yu gege, are you really going overseas?\u201dNot expecting this question, Song Yu froze for a second and honestly replied, \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it.\u201d\u201cCan you not think about it?\u201d Yue Zhishi hurriedly asked.Song Yu watched him, looking like he was trying not to smile. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201dI say you can\u2019t, Yue Zhishi silently replied. But since Song Yu said it like that, he definitely didn\u2019t have any plans yet to leave the country because he would have told him otherwise. This allowed Yue Zhishi to relax quite a bit.The carriage door opened, and quite a few people came inside. One couple rushed in, the girl wearing the man\u2019s coat. Yue Zhishi suddenly remembered and shifted his head to look at Song Yu. \u201cWhat did you mean by \u2018they\u2019re not friends\u2019?\u201dSong Yu knew he didn\u2019t understand. He also didn\u2019t want to explain further, so he chose to dodge the question just like when they were younger. \u201cThey\u2019re very good friends.\u201d\u201cI could tell. Their relationship is really good.\u201d Yue Zhishi thought about the second half of Song Yu\u2019s previous words of \u2018we\u2019re not brothers\u2019. Since they weren\u2019t real brothers, it wouldn\u2019t be too bad to be friends. His mouth moved faster than his brain, and he said, \u201cWe can also be very good friends.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t expect him to reply like that and very unnaturally turned his face away.\u201cI won\u2019t be friends with children.\u201dAnd unexpectedly, Yue Zhishi cheered up a little bit seeing Song Yu\u2019s reaction, chasing after him to look at his face. He must have found some shred of hope in Song Yu\u2019s complete refusal.He was a child, but Song Yu was already grown up. His birthday was coming up soon in the winter.Then once Yue Zhishi also grew up, Song Yu would be his friend.Everyone else in the carriage stood with slouched backs and crooked waists except for Song Yu, who stood as straight as a pole he could lean against. Yue Zhishi held onto his arm and gazed at his reflection in the glass window.He needed to grow up faster.They finally found some seats after some people got off at the next stop.Perhaps it was food coma, or maybe it was the flu medicine from the morning finally kicking in, but as Yue Zhishi sat there, his eyelids started struggling to stay apart. He couldn\u2019t help but nod off, his head bobbing up and down like fish bait in water and his body swaying back and forth with the movements of the train. He almost fully reclined onto the shoulders of the random auntie sitting to his right.Song Yu was originally looking down at his phone, but seeing Yue Zhishi\u2019s struggle, he reached out a hand and grabbed his hood. He pulled the hood with enough strength to tilt Yue Zhishi to his body, and as the carriage slightly rocked, Yue Zhishi fell onto his shoulder like there was a magnet drawing him into place. He continued to sleep peacefully.A young girl sitting across from them had been facing her phone towards them for a while. Song Yu lifted his head and glanced at her, and her face was immediately covered by a guilty expression, her phone lowering.But Song Yu didn\u2019t ask her to stop and didn\u2019t look at her again. He merely raised his hand and adjusted Yue Zhishi\u2019s hood, pulling it down to cover most of his face. He reached in a hand and felt his forehead before finally bringing his hand back to his side. It looked like Yue Zhishi was slightly disturbed by his movements, as he shifted a bit on his shoulder before snuggling in again to continue sleeping.Yue Zhishi\u2019s old habit of falling asleep in the car had still yet to be fixed. When he was younger and was on a train or a bus, he wasn\u2019t satisfied with just Song Yu\u2019s shoulder. He would often directly lean over and rest on Song Yu\u2019s lap, two hands holding onto his waist, and wake up with sleep marks all over his face.Song Yu opened his phone and exited the chat he had with Xia Zhixu. He then pressed open his messages with Yue Zhishi.Yue Zhishi\u2019s tracking ability was at the level of a kindergarten student. From the moment he\u2019d left the house that morning, Song Yu had known Yue Zhishi was following him. So during a moment when Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t been paying attention, Song Yu had sneakily taken a photo of him and had sent it over, hoping to give him a little scare. He didn\u2019t expect that this guy would\u2019ve even forgotten his cell phone.He clicked open the unused photo. Zooming in, he could see Yue Zhishi\u2019s extraordinarily long eyelashes. Song Yu stared at the silent chat box and then looked back down at the person sleeping on his shoulder.He\u2019d realised too late \u2014 he could no longer delete.The author has something to say:Girl: don\u2019t stop me, I want to post #handsome guys on the train#Song Yu told Zhixu about Zhishi\u2019s allergy because they\u2019re very good friends, and since they don\u2019t go to the same school, he wouldn\u2019t be able to harm Zhishi. Besides, eating together requires explaining why some food can\u2019t be ordered or why he can\u2019t let them give some food to Zhishi to try.He told Zhishi to not tell other people because his ability to guard against others is too low.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yue Zhishi was ridiculously happy when he saw the list of names. That day, two sentences filled his brain, circling around and around: \u2018gege won the award\u2019 and \u2018of course gege would win the award\u2019.The seasons of spring and autumn in this city were the same \u2014 they never lasted past two weeks. Sometimes it would feel like spring turned into winter over the course of one day, with the only stubborn proof of autumn\u2019s existence being the smell of osmanthus flowers covering the entire city, wafting continuously into the cold autumn wind.Two big osmanthus trees were planted in the little yard in front of Yanghe Qizhe. One was the glistening, golden variety, while the other was a red osmanthus tree. During their monthly school break, Yue Zhishi and Song Yu was called by Lin Rong to pick the flowers.The two of them were woken up early in the morning, and just so happened to coincidentally wear the matching set of sweaters Lin Rong bought for them last year. Song Yu\u2019s was black, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s was ivory white.Lin Rong placed a large tablecloth on the ground around the osmanthus trees in the yard. The two boys used slender bamboo sticks to beat the tree branches on top, golden fragments copiously drifting downwards with heavy fragrance. Yue Zhishi had always enjoyed doing this since he was young \u2014 other flowers also smelled nice, but the fragrance of osmanthus flowers was different, the scent of it carrying some sweetness just like its taste.\u201cEnough, enough.\u201d Lin Rong laughed as she packed up the flowers on the tablecloth. \u201cThere\u2019s not much left on the trees, we should leave some to smell.\u201dThe two of them stopped, and Song Yu prepared to put away his bamboo stick. He tilted his head and saw flower petals resting on top of Yue Zhishi\u2019s fluffy hair, a layer of glistening yellow. It looked like a souffl\u00e9 covered in maple syrup. He silently stretched out a hand, one end of his bamboo stick slowly wobbling over until it finally tapped on the back of Yue Zhishi\u2019s head.Yue Zhishi quickly covered his head and turned his head to look at him, the flowers on his head swirling away. He still managed to see the bamboo stick Song Yu quickly retracted. \u201cYou hit me.\u201dSong Yu had no intention of admitting it whatsoever, the stick hiding behind his back in his two hands. He stayed silent.\u201cAunt Rong, gege hit my head.\u201d Yue Zhishi chased after her and dropped the bamboo stick in his hand, the impact of it on the floor knocking up a pile of petals.Lin Rong helplessly smiled and said, \u201cAhh, be careful of the flowers!\u201dHe didn\u2019t step on the flowers, but he slipped on a corner of the tablecloth as he ran over. Yue Zhishi\u2019s whole body staggered forward, and luckily Song Yu managed to catch him before he fell.Sweet perfume filled the air. The tiny petals tucked away in the fibres of Song Yu\u2019s woollen sweater slowly cascaded down from the collision of Yue Zhishi\u2019s body, just like the unspooling of hidden care.\u201cStop messing around.\u201d Song Yu held his elbow and helped him stand back up.\u201cYou messed around with me first,\u201d Yue Zhishi reasonably retorted.Song Yu glanced at him. \u201cI just wanted to let you know there were a lot of petals on your head.\u201d\u201cSame goes for you.\u201dThe two of them lowered their heads at the same time, each patting away the fallen flowers on his own head.They managed to fill two large pots with the amount of flowers they knocked down, but many withered flowers and flower stems were mixed inside as well. The three of them sat at a table in the empty restaurant and started to separate their haul, chatting as they worked. The flower petals were about the size of rice grains while the flower stalks and stems were even smaller, and Yue Zhishi felt like his eyes were going to go blind from all the sifting. It felt like the plucking would never end.\u201cI know why these flowers taste so nice now.\u201d Yue Zhishi rotated and stretched his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s not the flowers that taste nice, it\u2019s the time spent on them.\u201d\u201cHey, that\u2019s very well said.\u201d Lin Rong was a bit surprised. She then said, her voice filled with emotion, \u201cThe amount of time you put into food makes it more delicious. Honestly, not just food, but everything in life is like that too.\u201dSong Yu thought about\u00a0The Little Prince\u00a0he\u2019d once read to Yue Zhishi when they were younger. Yue Zhishi might\u2019ve forgotten all about it by now, but there was particular quote from this bedtime reading story that remained in his memories.[It is the time you wasted for your rose that makes it so important.]Sometimes he\u2019d think, was that also their relationship? All that expended time and companionship have now become a permanent sunk cost.After being sifted through, the freshly cleaned osmanthus flowers sat in a large pot, golden and beautiful. Lin Rong sprinkled a little of salt and mixed it into the flowers to remove any bitterness while Song Yu and Yue Zhishi disinfected glass jars with boiling water. The flowers were then separated into two, half to make\u00a0osmanthus sugar, and the other half to make\u00a0osmanthus syrup.It was very easy to make osmanthus sugar. One thick layer of flowers was placed into a glass jar before a layer of sugar was poured on top. These two steps were repeated until there was a final layer of sugar on top. After pouring some baijiu over the last layer of sugar, the glass jar was sealed and put aside, waiting only to be put into the refrigerator at home.\u201cSo much sugar.\u201d Yue Zhishi stared at the jar, his face reflected on the glass.\u201cThe two of you work so hard at school, you should be eating more sugar.\u201dYue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but remember Senior Xu Qichen.He had a face that looked like it needed more sugar.The style of making osmanthus syrup was very Japanese. Equal amounts of white wine and caster sugar was mixed with three times the amount of water and boiled until the liquid became slightly thick. Lin Rong scooped up a spoonful to give Yue Zhishi to try. The sweetness was just right, so the osmanthus flowers were mixed directly into the syrup.\u201cI want to give Senior Xu Qichen a bottle.\u201dHearing Yue Zhishi\u2019s sudden words, Song Yu gave him a look, as if he was asking why.Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t yet answered when Lin Rong, who was mixing the syrup together, also remembered the election speeches. She asked Song Yu, \u201cThose two children also won the award, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Song Yu squeezed half a lemon before he went to wash his hands.\u201cAfter I heard from you last time, I felt that child Xiao Xu was so pitiful.\u201d Lin Rong couldn\u2019t help but sigh. \u201cIt just had to happen right before he started high school. If it were another person, there would definitely be no way they would continue going to school.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t continue the conversation, instead immediately giving Lin Rong a look. Lin Rong realised something and turned the topic of the conversation around. \u201cBut that child\u2019s smart, so he\u2019ll definitely end up in either Peking University or Tsinghua.\u201dBut Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t end up distracted. Just like Song Yu thought he would, Yue Zhishi very directly asked, \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Song Yu helped his mother pour out the finished syrup, his voice calm. \u201cHe got into a car accident during his high school examination period and was heavily injured.\u201dBoth his parents also passed away.\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi thought about how peaceful Xu Qichen was that day they ate lunch together. Yue Zhishi was the same age as he was when he got into the car accident. But he couldn\u2019t put the words \u2018Xu Qichen\u2019 and \u2018pitiful\u2019 together \u2014 after all, he himself didn\u2019t like to be called pitiful. He thought Xu Qichen would be the same.Lin Rong changed the subject, pushing some lemon juice and a bottle of alcohol in front of him. \u201cOkay Le Le, I\u2019ll give you our last task for the day. Let\u2019s finish this before I head out with your uncle on a business trip.\u201dYue Zhishi followed her instructions and poured in three spoonfuls of lemon juice and two spoonfuls of the orange flavoured alcohol into the prepared sugar syrup. Once the mixture was poured into jam jars, everything was successfully completed.The sun came out in the afternoon. Yue Zhishi and Song Yu sat at the stone table in the small yard, one silently reciting classical Chinese texts and the other doing his homework questions. Lin Rong carried out a pot of hot black tea, and Yue Zhishi drank two large cups after it was mixed with lemon slices and some of the osmanthus syrup. After also eating a small plate of\u00a0leche frita\u00a0drizzled with osmanthus syrup, he was fully satisfied.The next morning as soon as he got out of bed, the first thing Yue Zhishi did was to open the fridge and see if his osmanthus sugar had started to blend together yet. The previously separate layers in the jars have actually started to melt.\u201cSo cool,\u201d he softly said to himself. He then followed Lin Rong\u2019s instructions and opened each jar, stirring up the flowers inside.One large tree spent an entire year\u2019s worth of effort to produce yesterday\u2019s flowers, and they\u2019d worked through the entire afternoon \u2014 all just for these six little jars.Last night before the couple left for their business trip, Yue Zhishi cheerfully assigned his presents. \u201cOut of my two jars of osmanthus sugar, one is for Senior Xu, and the other one I\u2019ll give to my friend.\u201d\u201cWhat about your syrup?\u201d Lin Rong asked.\u201cI\u2019ll give them to Song Yu gege!\u201d Yue Zhishi had already planned it out long ago. Song Yu had a fridge in his room. If he gave Song Yu his syrup to keep in his room, he would then have an excuse to visit him for tea.He was a person of action. He carried his jars upstairs as he finished speaking, taking advantage of Song Yu\u2019s absence to sneak them into his fridge.As he pulled open the door, he suddenly noticed a row of yoghurt sitting in Song Yu\u2019s perpetually empty fridge.They were all cheese-flavoured.\u2014On Monday, Yue Zhishi carefully carried his jar of osmanthus sugar the entire way to school, worried he might drop and break the glass jar. He planned on giving it to best friend Jiang Yufan.After the last monthly exams, their class had switched up their seats. Yue Zhishi now sat next to the window opening into the school corridor near the back, while Jiang Yufan sat near the front, also next to a window. Yue Zhishi arrived a bit early for their morning self-study session and saw Jiang Yufan\u2019s empty seat. Since there was no one there and the window was open, he directly stood in the school corridor and opened his schoolbag to pull the jar out.The osmanthus sugar sparkled like crystals underneath the classroom\u2019s incandescent light bulbs and looked especially enticing.Jiang Yufan\u2019s desk mate looked at it curiously. \u201cWow, what is this? It looks like it\u2019ll be yummy.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s back was suddenly, forcefully shoved just as he was about to open his mouth. The glass jar almost fell from his hand. His back ached, and Yue Zhishi set the jar onto the desk before he looked around, eyebrows drawing together. He saw four male students surrounding a short classmate, pushing and shoving him towards the bathroom.\u201cIgnore them,\u201d Jiang Yufan\u2019s desk mate said to Yue Zhishi. \u201cWang Jie from the class next door is a gangster. That short guy is someone from their class, he\u2019s skipped a grade. I think he\u2019s called Cheng Mingming. He\u2019s always being bullied.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked, still frowning.\u201cI hear his family has money, and he was raised by his grandparents. Don\u2019t know what he did though, he\u2019s always being blackmailed by the gangsters in their class.\u201d Jiang Yufan\u2019s desk mate said, very disdainfully, \u201cThey should try bullying someone bigger if they have the ability. What does it say about them to be bullying someone without parents, right?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Yue Zhishi sent his bag over and placed it onto Jiang Yufan\u2019s desk, turning over to head towards the bathroom. Jiang Yufan\u2019s desk mate felt something wasn\u2019t right and leaned over the window, calling at him, \u201cHey, wait, Yue Zhishi!\u201dHe didn\u2019t look back. Jiang Yufan\u2019s desk mate was a bit puzzled \u2014 this was an obedient student with a famously good temper. How come he was being so heroic today? But he didn\u2019t follow along, scared that if something did happen, he\u2019d be implicated too.A large crowd was squeezed into the bathroom, and there was even someone standing by the door as a lookout. Yue Zhishi was immediately blocked as he went over. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cTo wash my hands,\u201d Yue Zhishi said.\u201cCome back later.\u201d The guy recognised him, seeing he was also a well known person in the junior high department, and then said, \u201cCan\u2019t you tell something\u2019s going on inside?\u201dYue Zhishi, face full of innocence, asked \u201cWhat is?\u201dThe guy was made speechless by his question and awkwardly glanced backwards. Yue Zhishi took advantage of this pause, pushed away the arm blocking his way and entered. He flung away the guy\u2019s hastily grasping hands. Yue Zhishi thought he was short because he always compared himself with Song Yu when he looked at his height, but in reality, when compared to classmates his own age, he was taller than most of them.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dYue Zhishi thought the fierce-looking boy with the crewcut standing right in the middle should be who Jiang Yufan\u2019s desk mate called Wang Jie. He felt it was more respectful to call him by his name, since he didn\u2019t actually want to fight, let alone stir up any trouble.\u201cClassmate Wang Jie.\u201dJust as he expected, the crewcut twisted his head over, eyes weighing Yue Zhishi. \u201cWhat?\u201dYue Zhishi nodded, and then, just like someone\u2019s alarm clock, said, \u201cThere\u2019s only 15 minutes left before morning self-study.\u201d\u201cWhy the fuck do I need you to remind me? Are you the only good student here?\u201d Wang Jie\u2019s words were harsh, but he turned his body around. \u201cThis is none of your business.\u201dSeeing as his reminder wasn\u2019t as useful as he\u2019d hoped, Yue Zhishi slightly sighed before saying, even more straightforwardly, \u201cDon\u2019t bully classmates.\u201d\u201cDo you think you\u2019re acting in one of those school dramas?\u201d Wang Jie sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re worth something just because some girls like you. What the fuck.\u201d He kicked the student cowering in the corner of the room as he spoke. \u201cYou know him? Looks like he wants to help you, maybe he just wants to use you to get some fame?\u201dThe people following Wang Jie started to gather together, looking like they wanted to hold off Yue Zhishi. But he pushed them all away, going directly to the student on the floor and helped him up. He realised the student\u2019s pockets were flipped out, so he lifted his eyes and stared straight at Wang Jie. \u201cGive his money back.\u201dWang Jie was enraged all of a sudden and ruthlessly shoved Yue Zhishi. \u201cWho do you think you are, daring to stick your nose in my business!\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder blades smacked onto the wall, the pain causing him to frown once again. But he didn\u2019t want to bother with this kind of person \u2014 and besides, with their larger amount of people, he would definitely be at a disadvantage if they started to fight.Yue Zhishi had never done anything to show off like this since he was a child. The whole situation was new to him, and he didn\u2019t know what to do. But whenever he met something he didn\u2019t know how to handle, his habit was always to imitate, thinking, if this was Song Yu, how would he handle this?The other student was very scared, shaking as he stuck closely behind Yue Zhishi. Yue Zhishi tried to make himself look more calm, like Song Yu\u2019s usual demeanour, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal if you\u2019re only hitting people. You can always say it was a small conflict to the teachers. But if it\u2019s money you\u2019re refusing to give back, then that\u2019s robbery, and we can report that to the police.\u201dYue Zhishi then pointed outside. \u201cLook, plenty of people walking outside saw you do it. There are also cameras. If we really did call the police, there\u2019d be plenty of evidence.\u201d He blinked and asked Wang Jie, \u201cHave you been to the police station before?\u201dWang Jie\u2019s face immediately changed. Even though everyone called him a gangster, he was still only just a junior high school student. He had yet to even enter society, let alone been to a police station. Being bluffed like this, his heart was a bit nervous even though his words weren\u2019t: \u201cFuck, let\u2019s see if you dare call the police!\u201dThe bullied Cheng Mingming was scared enough to hide behind Yue Zhishi. Yue Zhishi tightly held onto his arm and said, \u201cEven if he\u2019s too afraid to do it, I can bring him to the police station. After all, I\u2019d only need to give a testimony.\u201dActually, Yue Zhishi had never been to the police station either and didn\u2019t understand the usual procedures. He only followed what he saw in the television dramas, but seeing as Wang Jie was just a paper tiger with no real teeth, he decided to try bluffing his way through.\u201cYou!\u201d Wang Jie choked. He turned around and called to his \u2018little bro\u2019, \u201cGive it to him. I don\u2019t fucking need this small amount of money.\u201dThe little bro threw the money down onto the floor, two bills of 100 and one bill of 50. Yue Zhishi bent over and picked them up for the student, stacking the bills up neatly. \u201cCan you see any missing?\u201d\u201cMissing your ass!\u201dYue Zhishi only frowned and didn\u2019t respond to Wang Jie\u2019s swearing. Once Cheng Mingming shook his head and softly said everything was all there, Yue Zhishi felt everything was finished, so he started to support the scared student to walk outside. Wang Jie felt like he\u2019d lost some face and couldn\u2019t help but continue swearing. \u201cSo fucking unlucky\u2026\u201dYue Zhishi was too lazy to reply and continued walking. He heard one sentence as he reached the entrance.\u201cYou\u2019re in such a hurry to meddle in other people\u2019s business just because your mom\u2019s dead, fuck.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He heard about Yue Zhishi\u2019s fight as soon as he entered the classroom and ran right back out without even putting down his bag. But he still arrived too late \u2014 by the time he got to the bathroom, the school guidance director had already arrived.The bathroom\u2019s few square metres were full of people either fighting or trying to pull others apart. Jiang Yufan forced his way through and immediately saw Yue Zhishi. His right eye was bruised, the corner of his mouth bleeding onto his torn shirt. The blood dripped onto his knitted vest, and his school badge was covered in red.Unprecedented violence and anger covered his face.\u201cYou all come with me to the office! What are the rest of you guys looking at? Didn\u2019t you hear the bell? Go back to class!\u201dJiang Yufan couldn\u2019t understand why Yue Zhishi fought with other people. This was entirely not like him, and he would even believe it if someone said Yue Zhishi was possessed. Not just him, but even the whole class was stunned when they heard of the news.\u201cWho got into a fight? Yue Zhishi? You\u2019re joking right\u2026\u201d\u201cNo way, Yue Zhishi\u2019s never even been late, let alone hitting someone. Oh, except for the first day of school.\u201d\u201cI heard he was defending that guy who skipped a grade in the next door class. I\u2019ve never seen those two together before, so why would he end up brawling with someone like Wang Jie for him?\u201d\u201cAnd it was one against four too.\u201d\u201cShit, Le Le\u2019s amazing.\u201dSome people were even holding open the windows to peer at the high school building across from them. The administrative offices for the school directors and class advisers were all on the second and third floors of the opposite building.\u201cCan\u2019t see anything\u2026\u201d\u201cMaybe they\u2019re still getting yelled at? They might end up in the school corridors writing self-criticism essays in a little while.\u201dJiang Yufan felt particularly anxious and unsettled at hearing the girl in the front seat talk about Yue Zhishi as if it was some other person.\u201cThat Cheng Mingming\u2019s long had a history with Wang Jie. I think they used to be elementary school classmates. Last time I was in the cafeteria, I heard him say to other people that Wang Jie\u2019s family is really poor and that he\u2019s even stolen some of his money before.\u201d\u201cReally? Then\u2026\u201d\u201cAnyway, Wang Jie\u2019s not someone you should mess with, he\u2019s even said Cheng Mingming is useless without his parents. I feel like Le Le was dragged into this mess. Maybe both parties will find an excuse and blame it all on Le Le.\u201dAfter hearing about the topic of no parents, Jiang Yufan appeared to understand something. He was worried Yue Zhishi would be at a disadvantage, so he stood up and said he needed to go toilet because his stomach ached, when he actually ran to the opposite school building.Inside the office, the bullied Cheng Mingming kept fumbling his words, and the school guidance director couldn\u2019t get the full story out of him no matter how he tried.\u201cWhat happened? How did the fight start?\u201dCheng Mingming frantically shook his head. \u201cI had nothing to do with it, I didn\u2019t hit anyone.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t the first time Cheng Mingming and Wang Jie caused a problem. The guidance director knew this and could roughly guess what happened just by looking at them. But this case was strange in that a famously good student happened to participate in this fight \u2014 every teacher who\u2019d taught him before knew he was sensible and obedient.Class adviser Wang Qian and the class adviser for next door had also been called over. The director looked at them and said, \u201cThey\u2019re from your classes. You ask.\u201dWang Qian was well aware of Yue Zhishi\u2019s character, so he didn\u2019t indiscriminately start criticising him.\u201cYue Zhishi, what happened?\u201d\u201cWhy\u2019d you get into a fight with your fellow students? This isn\u2019t how you normally act.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s head was half-lowered, and the blood at the corner of his mouth was already dry. He opened his mouth and directly, obediently admitted his mistake even though he didn\u2019t give out his reasons for fighting. \u201cTeacher Wang, I\u2019ve broken school rules. I\u2019m happy to write either a self-criticism essay or be placed in detention. I\u2019m willing to take anything.\u201dSomeone suddenly appeared at the door, loudly reporting his arrival. Everyone looked over at the same time and saw Jiang Yufan, face full of desperation. \u201cTeacher, Yue Zhishi only went to the bathroom because he saw Cheng Mingming being bulled by Wang Jie! He didn\u2019t start it!\u201dYue Zhishi was worried Jiang Yufan would also be dragged into this, so he immediately said to Wang Qian, \u201cTeacher, Jiang Yufan wasn\u2019t there.\u201dJiang Yufan anxiously said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t there in person, but people saw it, many of our classmates saw them.\u201dWang Qian took a look at Yue Zhishi before he said to Jiang Yufan, \u201cGo back to class, this has nothing to do with you.\u201dJiang Yufan was unwilling, but he had no choice but to leave. He worriedly glanced at Yue Zhishi before he unhappily left.The class adviser from next door looked as if he wasn\u2019t planning on making this a serious matter. He first decided that Cheng Mingming didn\u2019t really commit anything wrong, and after greeting the guidance director, told Cheng Mingming to go back to class. He then turned to interrogate Wang Jie.At first Wang Jie was listless from being hit so many times, merely holding a tissue to his bleeding mouth. But the interrogation fired up his rebellious heart, and he said, \u201cWhat\u2019d I do? He poked his nose into something that had nothing to do with him. I already let them go, but then he turned around and punched me like a crazy person!\u201dHis followers chimed after him. \u201cThat\u2019s right! Yue Zhishi started it!\u201d\u201cWe were all holding back at first, who knew why he suddenly went crazy and started hitting people.\u201d\u201cTeacher, if you don\u2019t believe us, you should look for the people pulling us apart earlier in the bathroom. They would\u2019ve seen who threw the first punch.\u201d\u201cIt was me,\u201d Yue Zhishi calmly confessed. \u201cI wanted to hit him.\u201dAfter he said this sentence, all the other teachers in the office looked sideways at him in disbelief.Wang Jie never thought Yue Zhishi would say something like that. It felt like the Yue Zhishi standing in front of him now and the usual Yue Zhishi were two different people.\u201cI don\u2019t want to waste time debating with you guys whose mistake was bigger and whose was smaller,\u201d said the guidance director. He stood there with his hands behind his back, and smoothly recited what he believed to have happened. \u201cWang Jie, you brought people to bully Cheng Mingming, while you, Yue Zhishi, went to stand up for Cheng Mingming but ended up starting a fight. Both you and Wang Jie made a serious mistake, and thus a demerit shall be recorded for the both of you. Your class advisers will deal with the rest.\u201dHe looked at Teacher Wang. \u201cIf you believe you should call their parents, then do so. Or tell them to write a self-criticism essay.\u201dTeacher Wang nodded and escorted the guidance director out. He faintly felt like something wasn\u2019t quite right, so he brought Yue Zhishi to the teachers\u2019 kitchenette next door. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to the infirmary to take care of your face.\u201d\u201cNo need sir,\u201d Yue Zhishi said. \u201cThe infirmary will open soon, so I can go by myself.\u201dTeacher Wang poured him a cup of water. \u201cIf it was a student who normally got into fights or other trouble, I would simply call their parents to finish things. But the situation can\u2019t be that simple if it got you angry too.\u201dYue Zhishi held his paper cup and was silent for a while before he finally opened his mouth. \u201cTeacher, I don\u2019t want to talk about it. But I can promise you, I definitely won\u2019t fight with other students anymore. I\u2019m willing to accept any punishment you give me.\u201d\u201cI can call your parents then?\u201d Wang Qian put down his cup and gazed at Yue Zhishi.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi then also lifted his head to look at him. \u201cYou can, but my parents are out of town for the next few days. You\u2019ll have to wait for them to come back\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Wang Qian then said, \u201cAs your class adviser, I respect that you have a reason to not explain your actions, but you have to understand, violence is not a good way to solve problems. No matter when. If someone\u2019s threatening you, you can tell the teachers. If you don\u2019t trust us, you can also ask others to help you. Understand?\u201dYue Zhishi knew where he went wrong and nodded. \u201cYes, I understand.\u201dHe stayed in the kitchenette and wrote his self-criticism essay. By the time he finished and left, morning self-study had already finished. Yue Zhishi went by himself to the infirmary and treated his wound fairly simply before he returned to class. He recited his self-criticism essay in front of the entire class before Wang Qian started his Chinese literature class.\u201cGo back to your seat,\u201d Teacher Wang said, standing at the podium. \u201cThe fight this time can also serve as a reminder to your fellow students, to not casually choose to stand up for other people. If you come across school violence, the first thing you must do is notify a teacher, and don\u2019t try to meet violence with violence.\u201dEven though it was a fight, Yue Zhishi\u2019s good relationships with everyone meant they all stood on his side. This matter quickly spread amongst all the students, and most of them directly called him a courageous hero. No one knew the real reason why Yue Zhishi started fighting, and no one really wanted to know \u2014 it was merely another fresh topic of conversation within the dull and repetitive life of a student.After class, as they all started heading to the sport ground for some exercises, Jiang Yufan ran to Yue Zhishi\u2019s seat. \u201cDoes your eye hurt? Let\u2019s go the supermarket and get a popsicle for it.\u201d He reached out a hand and wanted to touch it, but he was also scared he might hurt Yue Zhishi. Yue Zhishi honestly shook his head, and Jiang Yufan felt some pity for him. \u201cThat looks so harsh. Why didn\u2019t you wait for me to go with you?\u201d\u201cI also made him bleed,\u201d Yue Zhishi seriously reported.\u201cHe definitely provoked you. Seriously, what happened? You usually never take part in these kind of things. Tell me, I\u2019ll find a chance to take revenge for you.\u201dBut no matter how he asked, Yue Zhishi refused to answer. Jiang Yufan guessed it must\u2019ve been close to what he\u2019d initially thought \u2014 if it wasn\u2019t because of the topic of parents, Yue Zhishi wouldn\u2019t have bothered and definitely would\u2019t have gotten into a fight. Jiang Yufan changed the subject without batting an eye. \u201cYour osmanthus sugar looks really good.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t it? But you have to wait until the sugar\u2019s all melted before you can eat it. Song Yu gege and I hit the tree to get the flowers\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi suddenly hissed, his lively movements just then pulling on his mouth injury.\u201cAhhh, be careful, talk slower,\u201d Jiang Yufan said. He then remembered: \u201cYou brother should\u2019ve heard about you fighting by now. He wouldn\u2019t yell at you, right?\u201dYue Zhishi instantly widened his eyes. \u201cNo way, he couldn\u2019t have heard.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what you think. The news spread while we were just in the morning self-study. I just saw a post about it on the Peiya school forum, loads of people were replying to it even though they were mostly scolding Wang Jie.\u201dYue Zhishi was suddenly concerned and grabbed Jiang Yufan\u2019s sleeve. \u201cDo I look particularly ugly right now?\u201d\u201cNot at all, you look super manly,\u201d Jiang Yufan laughed. \u201cHow come you\u2019re suddenly caring about your looks? Don\u2019t worry, all the girls are worshipping you right now. This one fight of yours have made you super handsome.\u201dYue Zhishi pretty much didn\u2019t care about those things \u2014 he just didn\u2019t want Song Yu to know he got into a fight, and he definitely did not want to face him with this face of his.\u201cI\u2019m not going to do the exercises anymore, I\u2019m going to take some leave,\u201d Yue Zhishi said. He immediately ran to find the class monitor and hid in the classroom to do his homework. He\u2019d have to hide even if he went down to the sports ground anyway, and it would be even more awkward if he bumped into Song Yu face to face.His eye was now swollen and aching, and Yue Zhishi started to regret the morning. However, he didn\u2019t regret choosing to hit someone \u2014 he was regretting the fact he didn\u2019t move better. If he could redo the fight, he definitely would dodge those few punches and would knock that guy to the floor in one blow.After the school exercises, a few girls in class gave him bandaids. One girl from another class even bought him a bottle of ice water, telling him to put it on his eye. Yue Zhishi thanked them one by one even though he wouldn\u2019t be able to use most of the items. He didn\u2019t quite like the feeling of standing out and thought he\u2019d definitely keep a low profile in the future.Luckily, Aunt Rong wasn\u2019t at home this afternoon, so he didn\u2019t have to go home for lunch. This gave Yue Zhishi a chance to avoid Song Yu. He wasn\u2019t hungry, so he decided to continue staying in his classroom and work on his homework. If he did more of them now, there would be less for him to do tonight. He needed to go home early later, so he could quickly shower and then hide in his room and lower the chances of bumping into Song Yu.While holding onto his \u2018perfect plan\u2019, Yue Zhishi was immersed into his homework questions, his head lowering and lowering until his chin was almost on top of his exercise book.\u201cIs there a point E\u2026 if you make equal\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi read out the question in a low voice, his eyebrows drawing together so closely until they almost touched. His eye started to ache harder. \u201cHow do I prove this\u2026\u201d\u201cAssume it exists.\u201dA voice suddenly flowed over the top of his head. Yue Zhishi thought he was hearing things and frantically lifted his head.Exist?He currently doubted his own eyes. The gege in front of him didn\u2019t actually exist.Song Yu\u2019s face was still as calm as usual. He didn\u2019t look at him and looked only at the question. \u201cProof by contradiction. First hypothesise that the point exists, and then use that assumption to solve the problem. In an equal proposition, it cannot be both true and false.\u201dHe really was here.Yue Zhishi softly said, \u201cOh.\u201d He lowered his head and wrote down the word \u2018proof\u2019, then carefully opened his mouth. \u201cWhen\u2019d you get here?\u201d\u201cJust now.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi hung his head and wrote the phrase \u2018assume point E exists\u2019.Song Yu glanced at the top of his head and said, \u201cStop working, let\u2019s head back for lunch.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going home?\u201d Yue Zhishi blankly stood up and followed Song Yu outside. Both Aunt Rong and Uncle were away, and there was no one at home to cook. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to the cafeteria?\u201d\u201cHome.\u201dHe definitely must\u2019ve heard about the fighting, and yet he didn\u2019t look too unhappy. Yue Zhishi was a bit apprehensive.Song Yu walked in front of him, half a step\u2019s distance away. His arms were by his side, fingers long and slender, and as he stared at him, Yue Zhishi absentmindedly thought about their childhood. He remembered in the first year of elementary school, when he\u2019d just started going to school, they\u2019d also walked like this on the road, one in front and one behind. But back then Song Yu was the one who\u2019d gotten into a fight, and Yue Zhishi was the one who\u2019d been bullied.His tears had flowed in unending streams, and he\u2019d held Song Yu\u2019s hand as they went home.How come they couldn\u2019t hold hands anymore?This curious thought suddenly appeared in Yue Zhishi\u2019s mind, and his hand reached forward without conscious thought.But the person in front unexpectedly put his hand into his pocket. Song Yu\u2019s phone had been vibrating from the moment he left the classroom, and he couldn\u2019t take it anymore, taking it out to look at it. The messages were all from Qin Yan.[Qin Yan: oh my god, i just went to the toilet and you disappeared. where\u2019d you go?][Qin Yan: everyone said you\u2019re not going to the cafeteria? didn\u2019t we agree we were going to eat lunch together today][Qin Yan: are you coming back to school? let\u2019s play some ball with lao zhang later]He was about to simply reply with \u2018going to rest at home for lunch\u2019 when a long paragraph suddenly jumped into the chat, the content of it causing Song Yu to frown.[Qin Yan: fck! xiao hei just said he saw you and your brother leave the school, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to publicly humiliate him, it\u2019s just a small fight between boys don\u2019t get angry at him, hey wait isn\u2019t your mom away today who\u2019s going to cook? are you planning to starve our le le?]Song Yu abruptly stood still and lowered his head to respond. Yue Zhishi stopped moving as well and pulled his hand back in a fluster, hiding it behind his back.The sun in autumn wasn\u2019t very strong, but it still scorched his back, burning the palm of his hand.Having finished his reply, Song Yu glanced back at Yue Zhishi. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dQin Yan was eating some soy sauce fried rice in the cafeteria. He checked his phone and almost spat out everything in his mouth.[I\u2019ll cook. People should eat something nice after being wronged.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cotton Candy was the first to come out and warmly welcome them, while Orange was in the corner of the sofa, simply lifting his head from the noise. After determining it was just them who\u2019d come home, he then lowered his head and turned his back to them to continue sleeping.Song Yu took off his outer school jacket. He told Yue Zhishi to sit on the sofa and asked him what he wanted to eat. Yue Zhishi had just lifted the dog into his arms and froze when he heard Song Yu\u2019s question \u2014 he placed the dog down and followed behind Song Yu into the kitchen. \u201cSong Yu gege, are you cooking?\u201dSong Yu pulled down the apron hanging on the kitchen wall and tied it around himself. \u201cIs it strange for me to cook?\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head, sitting to the side of the kitchen island. The little Pomeranian dog climbed up his leg and snuggled into his arms.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I ate your cooking.\u201dIn the past, Song Jin\u2019s business was a lot busier than now. Lin Rong needed to help take care of the company and was constantly not at home. Song Yu and Yue Zhishi were very young still at that time. They\u2019d tried hiring a nanny, but she once didn\u2019t pay attention to the food she was cooking and gave Yue Zhishi an allergic reaction serious enough to stay in the hospital. From that point on, they didn\u2019t dare hire any nannies. If Lin Rong was too busy, then it would be Song Yu who cooked. Being surrounded by cooking from a young age, Song Yu could be considered quite skilled at it.Two little children, one small dining table and a few home cooked dishes \u2014 this was a memory Yue Zhishi could see by simply closing his eyes.\u201cI want\u00a0maocai.\u201d The Pomeranian\u2019s head rested on the kitchen island, Yue Zhishi caressing his downy head. \u201cAnd cake.\u201dSong Yu turned his head back at him as he stood in front of the open fridge, pointing at the corner of his mouth as he raised an eyebrow.Yue Zhishi only then remembered. He touched his mouth and still felt some pain. \u201cBut I want to eat it.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t say anything, merely starting to prepare the ingredients. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want him to work by himself, so he also went over to help despite not really know how to cook. He could only help wash the vegetables. The scrape on his fist stung a bit from the water. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t make a sound, only pausing his movements slightly, but the water suddenly stopped pouring from the faucet.\u201cYou don\u2019t wash them cleanly enough.\u201d Song Yu tore off a kitchen towel and handed it to him.Yue Zhishi wiped away the water on his hands. \u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cStand there,\u201d Song Yu said, head lowered and focused on cutting the vegetables. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you just watch.\u201dCotton Candy happily ran over to circle around Song Yu\u2019s legs. Yue Zhishi bent over and picked him up, holding tightly onto his paws. \u201cDon\u2019t bother gege.\u201dSong Yu cut off a chunk of the beef tallow hot pot base Lin Rong had previously prepared. Once it went into the wok, it felt like the entire kitchen came alive, hissing and steaming. Ginger and garlic went into the now melted chilli oil, the aroma spreading everywhere. Hot water was poured in while the wok was still hot, and the red soup bubbled up and down as it boiled.Song Yu tasted it after he added in some further seasonings and thought it was a bit salty. He threw in a variety of cut vegetables.As he watched over the wok, Song Yu separated the egg yolks from two eggs and mixed them with wheat free flour. He then gave the egg whites and a hand mixer to Yue Zhishi, signalling him with a look.Whipping up egg whites was Yue Zhishi\u2019s most favourite thing to do \u2014 it could always improve his mood very quickly. It was a magical experience watching the egg whites gradually change from liquid to puffs to finally resemble clouds.\u201cThey\u2019re ready,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, lifting away the hand mixer. The \u2018clouds\u2019 formed little peaks as the whisks were pulled out. The peaks were signs of success, and Yue Zhishi was rather satisfied. \u201cPerfect.\u201dAfter he plated up the maocai, Song Yu started making pancakes. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough time for a cake, this will be faster.\u201d\u201cA\u00a0pancake\u00a0is still a\u00a0cake,\u201d Yue Zhishi said while he nodded, emphasising the English words.Time passed, and the kitchen island soon carried two bowls of rice, a small pot of steaming maocai and a blueberry pancake, two different styles of food combining together. Fatty beef slices\u00a0were stewed until they melted in the mouth, and when covered by some bright red chilli oil, just the look of them could stir the appetite. Song Yu took out a small glass jar and drizzled some golden osmanthus syrup over the pancake and then pushed it to Yue Zhishi.Yue Zhishi picked up a piece of fish and carefully put it into his mouth. He was very cautious when chewing, and his stiff movements were slightly amusing.The maocai was full of flavour, numb and spicy at the same time. Yue Zhishi started sweating after eating some of it and stuffed a piece of the syrup covered pancake into his mouth to help cool down the burn. It was soft and spongy like a thick piece of chiffon cake, the flavour warm and smooth.His uneasy feelings from the morning slowly dissipated in the midst of red chilli oil and honey.Everything can be fixed by some delicious food.Song Yu ate in silence until he suddenly left his seat and returned with a bag filled with ice. \u201cPut this on your eye.\u201dHe finally mentioned it. Yue Zhishi took the ice bag and mumbled his thanks, elbow resting against the table as he placed the ice against his eye. He held it for a little bit before he couldn\u2019t help but raise his head. \u201cIs it really ugly?\u201dSong Yu focused on eating. \u201cYou know the answer to that.\u201dHe clearly didn\u2019t care about the issue of his ruined face in front of other people, but Yue Zhishi was very afraid of Song Yu seeing his swollen eye, to the point he disdained himself. He didn\u2019t understand where this difference came from. Sighing, Yue Zhishi said remorsefully, very seriously, \u201cI should\u2019ve dodged that punch.\u201dSong Yu put down his bowl. \u201cYue Zhishi, shouldn\u2019t you be regretting the fight instead?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t regret it.\u201d Yue Zhishi looked at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s reply somewhat distracted Song Yu. It was like seeing himself when he was younger, so stubborn he refused to admit his mistake despite being beaten until blood streamed down his head.But Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want Song Yu to misunderstand him \u2014 he actively relaxed the initially obstinate attitude he held in front of the class adviser and started to explain himself. \u201cGege, I didn\u2019t mean to cause trouble. I actually didn\u2019t plan on fighting in the beginning, it\u2019s just that\u2026\u201dWithout waiting for him to finish, Song Yu interrupted, \u201cI know.\u201d\u201cThe person you hit,\u201d Song Yu said, gazing at Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes as if he already knew the answer. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201dYue Zhishi abruptly stiffened, his hand tightening on the ice bag. His head drooped down as well, almost like a plant wilting in strong sunshine.\u201cHe said\u2026 it\u2019s because my mom\u2019s dead that I\u2019m poking my nose in other people\u2019s business.\u201dWhen Wang Qian asked, he wasn\u2019t willing to answer. When Jiang Yufan asked, he didn\u2019t want to answer. Even if Lin Rong or Song Jin had immediately been called, Yue Zhishi could also stop a single word from passing his lips. But for some reason, once Song Yu asked, he answered.It seemed like he could only be weak in front of Song Yu.\u201cI hit him because I couldn\u2019t hold myself back.\u201dActually, Song Yu had already guessed the reason. His class representative had been carrying their homework downstairs and just so happened to see Yue Zhishi being scolded in the office. Song Yu initially didn\u2019t believe it when the news spread in class \u2014 he was clearer than anyone else that Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t like being in the spotlight. Even if he really was helping a classmate, he still wouldn\u2019t take the initiative to hit someone.But afterwards, when he heard the bullied student had no parents, Song Yu largely guessed the cause behind the fight.Even a small dog would bite someone if they stepped on its tail.But he\u2019d never wanted to be the rebuking older brother. Pretentious, reproachful adults have already done too much. Sometimes they couldn\u2019t even understand children could have their own worries, let alone consider those worries to be important \u2014 so they only know how to discipline, to force those children to make unwilling promises. They would never try to care about how those children felt, whether they were in pain, or how badly they were suffering.Disciplining or caring \u2014 Song Yu was inadequate at both of them.He watched as Yue Zhishi silently ate with his head lowered, his eyes quickly blinking several times as if he could force the tears back. Song Yu couldn\u2019t tell what what he was feeling, but he discovered that the current Yue Zhishi sitting in front of him was no longer the child who only knew how to hide behind him and cry.\u201cThen did you win? Or did he win?\u201dYue Zhishi never expected Song Yu to ask him something like that.He sniffled and lifted his head. The uninjured side of his mouth was smeared with chilli oil, but his expression was fully serious. \u201cI won. I fought four people by myself. I was a bit flustered after someone yelled the teachers were coming, so I didn\u2019t manage to dodge that last punch. My eye wouldn\u2019t have been hit otherwise.\u201dIt looked like he really cared about that punch to his eye. Song Yu grabbed a tissue and was about to hand it to him, but Yue Zhishi said, \u201cI\u2019m not crying. It\u2019s just too spicy.\u201dSong Yu could only reach over and calmly wipe off the oil on his mouth.Maybe because it felt like he gave himself away by protesting too much, or maybe because Song Yu personally wiped his mouth for him, but Yue Zhishi\u2019s ears started to burn. He frantically stuffed another piece of the pancake into his mouth and almost choked, coughing for a long while.After finishing the food, the two of them cleaned up with enough time remaining for an afternoon nap. Yue Zhishi\u2019s eye felt a lot better after being iced. He went back to his room and looked at himself in the mirror. His eye was black and blue \u2014 it really was hard to look at.Song Yu closed his curtains and lay down onto his bed, casually browsing through his phone. It was full from Qin Yan\u2019s texts. He\u2019d just closed his eyes when he heard knocking on his door, and without even opening his eyes, he said, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI want to sleep with you,\u201d Yue Zhishi said. His words were clear and direct, but he didn\u2019t take\u00a0even half a step into the room.If this was the past, Song Yu would refuse without a second thought. But today he didn\u2019t \u2014 he shifted over on his bed, silently giving permission.Yue Zhishi immediately climbed on top. Song Yu opened his eyes, thinking to give him a pillow, but he saw a blindfold sitting on Yue Zhishi\u2019s head. He lightly pulled on the strap and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201dYue Zhishi held onto his blindfold. \u201cI want to wear it.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t prevent him from doing so and turned over in the bed. Yue Zhishi obediently lay down as well, quietly gazing at Song Yu\u2019s back. He felt like it\u2019d been a long time since he last slept with Song Yu. When they were younger, he would climb onto Song Yu\u2019s bed with a pillow every time it rained and stick closely to his body. He was less afraid that way, and it was only during those times when he wouldn\u2019t be pushed away.But Song Yu was afraid of heat and would always mind when Yue Zhishi, a little meatball of warmth, hugged or clung onto him. Yue Zhishi learned to rest only his forehead on Song Yu\u2019s back, utterly restrained in fulfilling his need to feel secure.This might be the first time he fell asleep with Song Yu during the day. It just had to be with a ruined face, too.Yue Zhishi touched his forehead against Song Yu\u2019s back. He could feel his gege\u2019s heartbeat through his skin and bones, and it felt like he could even smell the very familiar scent of rain, soft and wet and full of hope.The illusion was like a hypnotic drug, the steady beat and imagined smell quickly lulling away his defences and pushing him into sleep.The drug only worked when he was by Song Yu\u2019s side.He couldn\u2019t help but think \u2014 if he could stay like this for the rest of his life, he wouldn\u2019t need anything else.But he knew he couldn\u2019t. He was no longer that three-year-old child who used all the ways he could think of to stop Song Yu from getting married. He could no longer recklessly cry, and he could no longer open his mouth and say things just to make himself happy.Yue Zhishi fell asleep with these thoughts. In his dream, everyone\u2019s faces were blurry and unclear: his parents who died early, the adults with sympathetic eyes and the children pushing and shoving at him. Only their voices were very clear.[Children with no parents are so pitiful.][Oh, so you\u2019re an orphan.]Those voices twisted together and formed a dark shadow, chasing after him as he ran through his winding dream. He couldn\u2019t escape. He wanted to call out Song Yu\u2019s name \u2014 just his name \u2014 but he had no voice when he opened his mouth.\u201cYue Zhishi, Yue Zhishi\u2026\u201dHe startled awake, his whole body covered in sweat. The image of Song Yu, now grown up, slowly sharpened in his field of vision. Yue Zhishi deeply sighed several times, eyebrows tightly drawn together. \u201cI had a nightmare.\u201d He somehow thought of something Jiang Yufan said a few days ago. \u201cIt felt like sleep paralysis.\u201dFinished speaking, he very coolly flipped over. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue sleeping.\u201dSong Yu lay back down, remnants of the sweat on Yue Zhishi\u2019s forehead still on his palm. He stared at the ceiling, and all he could see was Yue Zhishi\u2019s unresponsive face.\u201cYue Zhishi.\u201dHearing Song Yu call his name, Yue Zhishi made a noise in response. His voice was the slightest bit nasally and sounded as if he was cutely whining. He cleared his throat, trying to pretend it didn\u2019t happen.\u201cYou used to be such a crybaby when you were younger. You always gave me a headache when you cried, and it made me want to send you away.\u201dSong Yu spoke very lightly despite his words of complaint. Yue Zhishi continued facing away from him, unconsciously pressing his lips together. He wanted to retort back, but then Song Yu opened his mouth again, quiet uncertainty threading through his words.\u201cHow come you don\u2019t like crying anymore now that you\u2019ve grown up?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The tears he\u2019d tried to hold back for a long time finally started to flow.He very stubbornly tried to wipe away his tears with one hand. He very quickly needed to use his other hand, and soon enough even both of his hands weren\u2019t enough to clean his face, the tears falling faster the longer he cried. He turned around and pushed Song Yu, shoving him until his back faced him once again. He placed his forehead onto Song Yu\u2019s back and cried, his shoulders quivering. His tears fell too quickly, so he buried his face into his pillow and tried his best to not make a sound.Song Yu stayed silent the entire time and let him cry. It soon looked like he ran out of patience, as he flipped over, took off Yue Zhishi\u2019s blindfold and dragged him into his arms. The tone of his voice didn\u2019t sound comforting at all.\u201cYou\u2019re only happy after you dirty my bed.\u201dYue Zhishi wetly retorted, \u201cYou told me to cry.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t reply, his entire attitude utterly unskilled at soothing someone. Yue Zhishi buried his head into his shoulder socket and didn\u2019t dare wipe his nose. In between his sobs, he asked, \u201cWon\u2019t your clothes get dirty?\u201dYou really do love asking questions.Song Yu said in a low voice, \u201cYou can wash them if they\u2019re dirty.\u201dFrom that point on, Yue Zhishi started crying recklessly and outrageously like a child, his sobs as loud and earthshaking as they used to be. Song Yu quietly lay there with his eyes blank. This entire scene was a little foreign to the two of them currently going through puberty, even though they\u2019d held each other like this often throughout childhood. To a younger Song Yu, Yue Zhishi was like a noisy little toy, following after him as if there was a ribbon connecting them together, like the little duck in Tom and Jerry. But as long as someone held him, he would quiet down and quickly fall asleep.He was always very quiet and obedient after falling asleep. He would look like a doll, just like how adults always described him.After growing up, Yue Zhishi was as well-behaved when awake as when he was asleep. He didn\u2019t cry or fuss around randomly and was always understanding and easy to like. Children during their adolescent years were always afraid to cry loudly, almost as if their troubles weren\u2019t worth being considered troubles, as if they weren\u2019t worth mentioning and were insignificant, or as if they would be accused of not knowing what true worries were. It was only in front of Song Yu that Yue Zhishi could place down his burdens and fall apart.Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t stop sniffling once his cries slowed down. Song Yu guessed from his understanding of Yue Zhishi that he wanted to say anything, so he listened for his voice. But Yue Zhishi ended up touching Song Yu\u2019s arm and pulled his hand over to his back. With a voice full of tears, he asked a small request. \u201cCan you pat my back?\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t refuse and lifted his hand to pat once. Yue Zhishi raised his head and looked at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean only once.\u201d\u201cMm,\u201d Song Yu said, his hand starting to move. He asked, \u201cStill feel wronged?\u201dThere were no obstacles in their understanding of each other. Yue Zhishi very quickly understood his question and answered, \u201cNo, not particularly. What he said is true, and he probably doesn\u2019t even know why I hit him.\u201d Yue Zhishi suddenly broke into a laugh. \u201cBut bullies are meant to be beat up. You probably don\u2019t know this, but he was even kicking people.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cDon\u2019t participate in these sort of things anymore.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Yue Zhishi closed his eyes again. He felt like he was in a warm cocoon, and he emptied his mind. He softly opened his mouth and said, \u201cActually, I\u2019ve almost forgotten how my parents look like.\u201dSong Yu said, still patting him, \u201cDon\u2019t you have a picture on your bedside table?\u201d\u201cPictures can\u2019t move. It\u2019s not the same as the actual people.\u201d Yue Zhishi then asked, \u201cHave you met them before?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Song Yu thought about their names. His first memory of them was when they got married on a beach with a small arch woven with flowers. There weren\u2019t many guests, and he was one of the page boys. He shouldn\u2019t have been able to remember that moment in time, but it unexpectedly left him with a strong impression.It was his first experience of a beautiful and happy marriage.But most beautiful things shatter too easily.\u201cThey were very good people.\u201d Song Yu kept patting Yue Zhishi\u2019s thin back. \u201cYour mother was very pretty, and her pasta was very delicious. Her voice was very gentle, and she knew to speak a little bit of Chinese. Your father had a very interesting sense of humour. The birthday present he gave me was the most unusual one I\u2019ve ever received.\u201dYue Zhishi shifted against his shoulder, his words fuzzy and sounding as if he was falling asleep. \u201cWhat present?\u201d\u201cA map he drew himself, with marks on places he\u2019s visited before,\u201d Song Yu said. \u201cHe told me I needed to explore the world.\u201dHe also told him that they could later go together to the places he marked.\u201cHe didn\u2019t give me one.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s arms slightly tightened around him.Song Yu thought he\u2019d probably wanted to wait until he accomplished something new or reached a new peak in his career before drawing one for him \u2014 but Song Yu couldn\u2019t say his thoughts out loud. Little by little, Yue Zhishi fell asleep as Song Yu continued lightly his patting. Song Yu tried loosening his arms, but it was almost like Yue Zhishi could feel it in his sleep and snuggled in closer to make up for any open distance.Even at Yue Zhishi\u2019s current age, soothing him to sleep still took enormous amounts of effort.Yue Zhishi slept deeply, and he was alone by himself in the bed when his alarm rang. The afternoon lunch break was very short. Only ten or so minutes had passed when he checked his watch, but he felt completely recharged and full of energy. He stayed under Song Yu\u2019s blanket in a daze for a little while before he rolled and bundled himself inside the entire blanket. He rolled again and unwrapped himself.So comfortable.There were two knocks on the door. Yue Zhishi lifted his head and saw Song Yu standing at the door, wearing a new set of his uniform and his two hands neatly tying his school tie. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be quick.\u201dStanding at the entrance to the house, Yue Zhishi specifically checked his appearance in the mirror. His eye may be swollen, but luckily he had large eyes. He would be too ugly otherwise. His mouth looked slightly better than before, and Yue Zhishi lightly licked the corner.Such bitter-tasting ointment.Song Yu took him to school on his bike. The smell of roasted chestnuts reached him from far away, and as they waited at a red light, Yue Zhishi jumped off and bought a big bag to enjoy as he sat on the rear seat of Song Yu\u2019s bike. Song Yu parked his bike once they reached the school entrance, and he turned his head to see Qin Yan parking his bike as well, a devious, sneaky smile on his face. Qin Yan shook his head speechlessly, as if he\u2019d caught Song Yu in the middle of something good.\u201cYou little bastard stood me up again for your little brother.\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d Song Yu turned around and got ready to leave, forgetting Yue Zhishi was next to him. He accidentally knocked into him and ended up pushing Yue Zhishi back half a step, the bag of roasted chestnuts in his hand almost falling onto the floor before Yue Zhishi tightly caught it.\u201cOuch.\u201d Yue Zhishi held his elbow, where bruises still remained from the morning\u2019s fight.Qin Yan acted as if he saw treasure and went to grasp onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder \u201cAiyah, let me see, let me see our Le Le\u2019s glorious achievements. You\u2019re so amazing, I didn\u2019t believe what I heard at first.\u201dYue Zhishi looked up at him and seriously said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t anything glorious.\u201d\u201cPfft.\u201d Qin Yan couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter, cracking up harder the longer he laughed. \u201cYour little brother\u2019s heart is too big, he even knows fighting isn\u2019t a good thing.\u201dSong Yu was too lazy to bother with him and said to Yue Zhishi, \u201cDon\u2019t stay in your classroom after your night self-study session ends. If you have homework to do, come to our fifth floor activity room.\u201dEach floor in the high school buildings had its own activity room, made especially for students who wanted a quiet space for memorisation during self-study times.\u201cReally?\u201d Yue Zhishi was elated. He grinned, the corner of his mouth throbbing with pain, before he pressed down on his mouth. \u201cI can really go?\u201d\u201cOf course, you just have to report my name\u2026\u201d Qin Yan wanted to hold onto him, but Yue Zhishi slipped away to Song Yu\u2019s side, leaving his arm dangling in the air. \u201cAh?\u201dSong Yu glanced at Yue Zhishi. \u201cGo in first.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded, and obediently walked toward the school doors. He walked only a few steps before he remembered and turned back around to stuff the paper bag of roasted chestnuts into Song Yu\u2019s hand. He said, \u201cI can\u2019t finish this.\u201d He hummed in agreement when Song Yu said, \u201cWait for me after school,\u201d and quickly left.The bag felt quite heavy. Song Yu opened it and saw peeled chestnuts, round and golden in colour and still slightly warm.\u201cAiyooo, having a little brother must be\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d\u2013Maybe because he knew he would be heading to the opposite building\u2019s fifth floor after night self-study, but Yue Zhishi was in a fantastic mood the entire afternoon, even though more than five people came over to moan about his face.He started packing up as soon as self-study finished, surprising Jiang Yufan. Jiang Yufan flew over to his seat with his bag and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re not staying longer for homework tonight?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201dJiang Yufan could clearly hear Yue Zhishi\u2019s mood from that one word. It felt like when people were chatting online, and they added a \u2018hehe\u2019 after their words \u2014 Yue Zhishi\u2019s answer carried that innate sense of giddiness and happiness.\u201cThen let\u2019s leave together. I\u2019m hungry and craving some hot dry noodles, dunno if the stall is open today.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m heading over to the fifth floor activity room in the high school building.\u201d Yue Zhishi looked apologetic. \u201cWe can walk through the corridor together though.\u201dSo that\u2019s what it was.Yue Zhishi happily climbed up the stairs to the fifth floor. The activity room was right next to Song Yu\u2019s classroom, and year 3 was coincidentally having a break when he arrived. The corridor was full of people, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s junior high school uniform caught everyone\u2019s eyes.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t he Song Yu\u2019s\u2026\u201dHaving been recognised, Yue Zhishi suddenly remembered his black eye and rushed past them with his head lowered. He dived into the activity room and didn\u2019t look at Song Yu\u2019s class at all.The activity room wasn\u2019t large. It held only eight desks and two small sofas, along with one whiteboard. Yue Zhishi was surprised when he saw another junior high school uniform in the room \u2014 she looked familiar, and Yue Zhishi thought she may also be in the same year as him. Yue Zhishi had just sat down near a window when Qin Yan walked in, hand holding a bunch of snacks. Qin Yan dumped the snacks all onto his desk. \u201cLe Le, eat some if you\u2019re hungry.\u201d\u201cThank you, Qin Yan gege.\u201dThe bell rang after they\u2019d just spoken a few words, and Qin Yan swiftly left for his classroom. Yue Zhishi looked at the snacks on his desk and found that cheese-flavoured yoghurt once again. He didn\u2019t touch anything else, opening only that carton of yoghurt, and gulped down a big mouthful.\u201cClassmate.\u201dHearing someone speak, Yue Zhishi lifted his head. It was the junior high female classmate he noticed earlier. Yue Zhishi raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re Yue Zhishi, right?\u201d She ran over carrying her vocabulary book, looking very friendly. \u201cYou helped my class\u2019s Cheng Mingming earlier today. You were so cool.\u201dYue Zhishi felt a bit awkward and leaned back against his chair. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t actually\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be modest, you\u2019re famous now. A lot of girls in my class are talking about you.\u201dSeeing she wanted to continue talking, Yue Zhishi tried to change the topic. \u201cHow come you\u2019re here? You\u2019re not going home?\u201dShe laughed. \u201cWell, I\u2019m studying. And conveniently waiting for my boyfriend to finish class.\u201dBoy, boyfriend?That girl, seeing Yue Zhishi\u2019s wide eyes, then asked, \u201cWhat about you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you live together?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not blood related.\u201d Yue Zhishi replied only to her first question, then looked down and opened his workbook. He said, lightly, \u201cWe should study\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, yes, that\u2019s right,\u201d she answered in awareness. She glanced over at a senior who was facing the corner of a wall trying to memorise her studies and said to him very softly, \u201cI\u2019ll go back now, I won\u2019t disturb you any longer. Let\u2019s talk next time!\u201d\u2018Next time\u2019? Does that mean she studies here every day?After two seconds of thought, Yue Zhishi slightly enviously unlocked a new place in his map of self-study locations. He tried to focus, but it felt too different studying in this room compared to his usual classroom.\u00a0 Whether he stayed behind in his classroom to work on his questions or paced back and forth in the corridor reciting his lessons while waiting for high school year 3 to finish \u2014 no matter what he did, they were all his own one-sided actions. It couldn\u2019t even be called \u2018waiting\u2019, because waiting required two people: one to wait, and one to be waited for.It was different this time. It was no longer an unauthorised, arbitrary waiting.As he thought this, Yue Zhishi lifted his eyes and looked across at the girl. She was messaging on her phone, smiling very sweetly. She should be chatting to her boyfriend. He was about to bite his pen while being lost in thought, but he suddenly thought of Song Yu\u2019s face and managed to hold back.He and Song Yu\u2026 they weren\u2019t quite the same as those two.The bell rang just as he finished his last question. Afraid Song Yu would need to wait for him, Yue Zhishi packed his stuff as quickly as he could, but next door seemed to be delayed with no one coming to the door. Yue Zhishi stood at the rear door of class 3-5, peering inside, and saw Song Yu reading a book with his head lowered, a silver pair of glasses perched on his nose. He was slightly near-sighted and usually didn\u2019t need to wear glasses, putting them on only when he needed to use his eyes for a long amount of time.Yue Zhishi really liked Song Yu\u2019s occasional squints and frowns when he wasn\u2019t wearing his glasses. He couldn\u2019t explain why, but he liked it when Song Yu looked like that.The students sitting near the back door noticed the junior high student standing near them, and they turned their heads to look at him as they whispered. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t notice anything at first until he heard someone softly say, \u201cIsn\u2019t that Song Yu\u2019s little brother?\u201d He remembered once again and immediately covered his bruised eye. He felt like standing there with his hand over his eye was also very strange, so he dodged away from the door.\u201cWhy do you look more afraid than I do?\u201d The girl from before stood openly outside the classroom, looking as if she wasn\u2019t worried at all about being caught by a teacher or a fellow student. \u201cThis place is part of Peiya. I\u2019m a Peiya student, so it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for me to be here.\u201dYue Zhishi thought about it. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d He moved to stand next to her. Before two seconds passed, he took one step to the right and widened the distance between them.Since the class was technically over, the teacher soon came out and specifically gazed at Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. The students inside the room were all very enthusiastic about finishing class for the day except for Song Yu, who took his time packing away his things. A few senior sisters came out hand-in-hand and surrounded Yue Zhishi.\u201cYou must be the little brother living with Song Yu.\u201d\u201cAre you mixed? You\u2019re very cute.\u201d\u201cAre your eyelashes real?\u201dYue Zhishi was used to being surrounded by people and didn\u2019t think too much of it, answering their questions one by one. \u201cYes, I am. Yes. Yes, my eyelashes are real.\u201dA large crowd gathered outside the classroom windows, Qin Yan looking at them with interest. He started teasing Song Yu again. \u201cYour brother\u2019s just as popular as you are, interesting both senior and junior sisters alike.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t say anything and merely walked outside with his bag. Yue Zhishi saw him come out as he stood by the window frame and immediately lifted his arm and waved, eyes bright. He squeezed past the senior sisters surrounding him. \u201cExcuse me seniors, I\u2019m going home now.\u201dIt was already late autumn, the cold wind twirling unavoidably around their necks and feet like a little human-shaped genie. As they went down the stairs, Yue Zhishi noticed the girl from earlier walking side by side with a short year 3 senior brother, leaning against each other as they descended the crowded and dim stairs. They even sneakily held each other\u2019s hands before quickly letting go.He looked at Song Yu as they left the stairs. He wanted to say something, but it was very strange \u2014 he couldn\u2019t think about what he should say. He eventually asked, \u201cIs my eye still really ugly?\u201dSong Yu stared at him and stayed silent. Yue Zhishi covered his right eye again in embarrassment and then heard Song Yu gently laugh.So weird.There were many people leaving the school. They separated to look for their own bikes at the bike parking area, and Yue Zhishi noticed something wasn\u2019t right when he took out his key to unlock his bike. Song Yu rolled his bicycle over and saw him kneeling and fiddling with his bike on the floor. He didn\u2019t look the slightest bit surprised. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d\u201cThe tire\u2019s been slashed.\u201d Yue Zhishi knelt there, finger poking the flat tire a few times. He then tilted his head to look at Song Yu. \u201cEven though this is a bit cynical, I think Wang Jie and his friends did this.\u201dSomething so obvious wasn\u2019t cynical at all. Song Yu got on his bike. \u201cGet on.\u201d\u201cThen what about my bike?\u201d Yue Zhishi may have opened his mouth and asked, but he had already locked his bike again.\u201cWe can talk about it when it\u2019s daylight.\u201dYue Zhishi obediently sat on the backseat and actively offered to help Song Yu carry his bag. Song Yu\u2019s bag was much heavier than he expected, the weight of it almost breaking his thighs. Perhaps his legs would be completely numb after a while and would immediately give way if he tried to walk. He would stumble into Song Yu\u2019s arms, and then Song Yu would carry him on his back like he used to as a child.As the bicycle travelled out of the school, Yue Zhishi hid behind Song Yu\u2019s back and laughed, his brain full of imagined scenes.The late-night food stalls near the school entrance looked almost like a little night market, each of them set up with stoves and furnaces to heat up the cool late autumn night. The fried rice stall owner had a cigarette in his mouth while he tossed his wok back and forth, the grains of rice flying up and down as the tantalising scent arrowed straight into people\u2019s noses. Duck necks covered in chilli oil were also strung together and tossed over an open fire after being stewed full of flavour. Once the spices were added, the duck necks came alive with taste. A claypot even simmered with a\u00a0three combination flavour vermicelli noodle soup, aromatic clouds rising up to the nose once the lid was lifted.As he sat at the back, Yue Zhishi thought of something and asked, \u201cSong Yu gege, did you finish the roasted chestnuts?\u201dSong Yu leisurely replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cActually, you could\u2019ve given some to Qin Yan gege if you didn\u2019t finish them.\u201d Yue Zhishi heard the sound of wood knocking against each other and tried to look for where the sound came from. He said, \u201cHe\u2019s always giving me snacks.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t reply.Yue Zhishi found it. \u201cSteamed rice cakes!\u201d He excitedly patted Song Yu\u2019s back a few times, asking him to stop the bike.Song Yu pressed the brakes and stopped where he requested, right in front of a very simple stall. A large square steamer held a delicate wooden device made of two separate parts, a common cylinder below and a long-handled lotus shaped wooden cover with a hollow centre sitting on top. The stall\u2019s old grandfather warmly welcomed them. \u201cAre you here for some rice cakes? Three yuan for two, they\u2019re very sweet.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded. \u201cI want two, please. Can you add a bit more brown sugar?\u201d\u201cOf course I can.\u201d The old grandfather\u2019s movements were quick, scooping out a large spoonful of flour mix from a container, a combination of rice flour, glutinous rice flour and sugar. He poured it into the bottom of the cylinder before sprinkling on a thick layer of brown sugar, creating two layers before covering it with the wooden cover and placing it into the steamer to cook.As they waited, Yue Zhishi heard Song Yu speak. \u201cYou almost burned yourself the first time you tried this.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d He twisted his head, entirely no memory of it whatsoever. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d\u201cYou never remember.\u201d Song Yu kept his eyes on the device. The warm yellow lighting from the night market and the rising puffs of steam softened his profile. \u201cDad was carrying you, and you were saying the toy looked fun. You reached out to touch it and started wailing from the hot steam.\u201dIt sounded vaguely familiar. \u201cThen what were you doing?\u201dThe cakes finished steaming as they spoke. The old grandfather opened the device and pressed the long handle against the cylinder to push out the rice cakes. The steaming cakes popped out and were wrapped inside a plastic bag.\u201cMe?\u201d Song Yu took the rice cakes. \u201cI was laughing at you.\u201dYue Zhishi was a bit depressed and said seriously, \u201cIf you were crying because of a burn, I wouldn\u2019t laugh at you.\u201dSong Yu gave him the cakes. \u201cYou would cry instead.\u201d He walked towards his bicycle.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t cry these days.\u201d Yue Zhishi followed behind him and then thought about the afternoon. He then added, \u201c\u2026unless you make me cry.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of hobby.\u201dSince he was always crying as a child, there must\u2019ve been a reason behind it.He decided it was all Song Yu\u2019s fault.The steamed rice cakes in the bag were almost hot enough to burn his hands. Yue Zhishi wanted to try some, and so looked inside the bag. The layer of brown sugar was indeed thickly applied and was shaped like a heart. He bit down and almost spat out his bite from the heat. But he couldn\u2019t help but greedily chew a few times, the cooked rice flour stretching and melting as the brown sugar inside started to dissolve. It was a heavy yet uncomplicated sweetness. In Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart, melted white sugar was just like dew drops on top of lotus leaves. When he was younger, he\u2019d thought those little beautiful, transparent drops of dew must definitely be sweet, while brown sugar was like the stickily sweet outside skin of a roasted sweet potato, the pleasure of it doubling during cold days.Song Yu noticed he wasn\u2019t catching up, so he looked back and saw him standing in his original spot with his mouth open, white fog coming out of his mouth and looking like a human-shaped humidifier.\u201cIs it good?\u201dYue Zhishi nodded and ran over, stuffing the other cake into Song Yu\u2019s hand. He said, words unclear, \u201cHurry and eat yours.\u201dSong Yu took a bite, thought it was too sweet and chucked it back to Yue Zhishi. He took him back home on his bike.\u201cCan I study in your activity room tomorrow too?\u201d\u201cIf you want to come, then come.\u201d\u201cWill the teachers check?\u201d Yue Zhishi suddenly remembered and grasped Song Yu\u2019s clothes. \u201cA girl from my next door class also studies there. She\u2019s dating one of the boys in your class. She\u2019s dating before university.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not your fault at all.\u201d\u201cTrue.\u201d But he was still a bit scared. \u201cCan I say I\u2019m your little brother? If people ask.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t reply. They were almost at their neighbourhood when he said a single \u201cyes\u201d. The two of them went up together, Lin Rong and Song Jin still out on their business trip. Yue Zhishi changed his shoes and collapsed onto the sofa, pulling the cat onto his knees and flipping him onto his back to rub his stomach. The cat squinted at him. \u201cOrange, are you sleepy?\u201dOrange let out a comfortable grumble in his arms. Yue Zhishi continued stroking him. \u201cI ate too much, and now I\u2019m not sleepy anymore. Song Yu gege, can I watch two episodes of One Piece before sleeping?\u201dSong Yu picked up the little Pomeranian frantically circling around his legs to bring him upstairs with him. \u201cWake up 15 minutes earlier tomorrow. I\u2019ll take you to school.\u201dYue Zhishi jumped up and forgot about the cat. \u201cThen I\u2019ll clean up and go to sleep now.\u201dMeow\u2014\u2014The brutally abandoned master of a cat stretched out his paws and fiercely swiped in the air at Yue Zhishi\u2019s retreating back to show his authority.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His happiness remained consistently at its peak. He felt like there was a reason behind Song Yu\u2019s bringing him to and from school and allowing him to study in the fifth floor activity room, but he\u2019d always had a magnanimous heart and never closely examined anything that happened to him.Even though an uncle at a nearby repair shop had long repaired his bicycle, he kept it at the school entrance and didn\u2019t use it. All the excuses and reasoning he prepared in advance were enough to fill up an entire excel sheet, waiting for the day Song Yu wanted to get rid of him, but he never had the chance to pull a single one of them out.Winter seemed to be competing with the end of the semester to see who could arrive faster. The two of them eventually arrived together at the same time without warning and caught Yue Zhishi unaware.It was soon time for the semester exams. The school requested the junior high year 3 students to attend an extra half day of class on the Saturday morning right before the monthly break, and the high school year 3 students were asked to attend an extra day. The Peiya that was originally known for no remedial lessons also ended up providing them.Yue Zhishi originally wanted to stay until the afternoon to go home together with Song Yu, but the seasonal flu season had slaughtered through the entire school. Other than the disinfected classrooms being used for lessons, students were not allowed to enter anywhere else. Yue Zhishi could only go home first by himself.He stood at the entrance to the corridor and wrote a text message to Song Yu, explaining the situation.He received a reply one second after pressing send \u2014 a simple \u2018okay\u2019.It\u2019d been a very long time since he went home with Jiang Yufan. On a whim, Yue Zhishi invited him to have lunch with him at Aunt Rong\u2019s private restaurant. Jiang Yufan had heard long ago that her restaurant was super difficult to book, so he couldn\u2019t be more excited and wanted to call home to let his parents know. But he didn\u2019t have his cellphone with him.Yue Zhishi pulled his out. \u201cUse mine, luckily I brought it today.\u201dComing out the math teachers\u2019 office, Song Yu glanced at the third floor corridor. Most of the junior high students were already gone, with only a few students dawdling still. Their talking voices echoed loudly in the empty space around them.He took a quick look into the activity room as he passed it. Workers were inside disinfecting it.Qin Yan just then ran over from the staircase, hand carrying a takeaway bag. He greeted him and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, our fried chicken just arrived. What did Old Zhang want you for?\u201d\u201cNothing much, just some competition stuff.\u201d\u201cI had to wait so long for the delivery driver to find the drop off place, I\u2019m going to freeze to death.\u201d Even though Peiya wasn\u2019t strict with their students, food delivery drivers still couldn\u2019t enter the school. Students could only pick up their orders through the fence railings.Qin Yan rubbed his hands together and took out the fried chicken box from inside the bag. \u201cWhile I was waiting, I saw a couple\u2019s entire fierce argument. Good thing I\u2019m single\u2026\u201d He took a sip of his coke. \u201cI also saw a few young people getting ready to fight. Once they pulled off their uniforms and chucked away their cigarettes, it almost looked like one of those mafia movies.\u201dWith the windows closed, the sound of the outside wind screeched like fingernails scratching down a blackboard. Song Yu frowned and put down the chopsticks he\u2019d just picked up. \u201cWere they junior high students?\u201d\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d Qin Yan stuffed his mouth with some fried chicken, garbling his words as he continued describing what he saw. \u201cThere was a tall and skinny guy with a crew cut, a little fatty and a bony guy with dyed brown hair. Everyone else I saw weren\u2019t students from our school, dunno if they were students from other schools or gangsters. They didn\u2019t look like the type you\u2019d want to annoy, not even trying to hide as they smoked in the parking lot. Are all junior high students like that now\u2026\u201dSong Yu got up to leave without waiting for him to finish speaking.\u201cHey, where you going? Not eating anymore?\u201d\u201cI have something to do.\u201dHe tried calling Yue Zhishi twice, the line busy each time. Song Yu ran to the bicycle parking zone and immediately noticed Yue Zhishi\u2019s bike was gone. It was particularly obvious when a bicycle that was there every day suddenly disappeared. He rode his own bike towards the direction of his house at an unprecedented speed.Song Yu waited at a red light at a fork in the road, the busy line signal still playing through his wireless earphones. He redialed.[I\u2019m sorry, your call could not be connected.]The northern wind at the intersection blew hard enough to make one frustrated. The light for the other road flashed green, and the bicyclists next to him flew across. Song Yu looked at it. It was a road he normally wouldn\u2019t take.It took six stops on the bus to go home, and it wasn\u2019t considered a short amount of time. When riding his bike, Yue Zhishi liked to take little shortcuts, cutting through a residential alleyway waiting to be demolished to save himself some time. Song Yu knew this, even though he didn\u2019t go home with him often.That old alleyway hadn\u2019t been so lively in a very long time.All the big green trashcans at the entrance to the alley have been kicked over to spill onto the floor. Wang Jie chewed his gum, looking like a little gangster, the people next to him throwing their cigarettes onto the floor before they stamped them out with the soles of their feet. Seeing the marks left behind by the cigarette ashes, Yue Zhishi thought of the villains in many of his manga series who liked to forcefully leave behind some signs of their existence with their ugly posturing.\u201cJust because you guys have more people!\u201d Jiang Yufan stood in front of Yue Zhishi. \u201cSo unlucky, start something at school if you have the guts!\u201dWang Jie spat out his mouthful of gum, and it landed on the floor right in front of Yue Zhishi.\u201cAre you worth me fighting you one on one?\u201d Wang Jie had just finished speaking when the tall and strong looking boy behind him grasped his shoulder and considered Yue Zhishi.\u201cIt must be you making things hard for my bro. Your little face is quite pretty, do you like the spotlight that much?\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t reply, his expression excessively calm. In reality, he was thinking this time he must definitely dodge and not let them hit his face, and he must definitely smash Wang Jie\u2019s face this time. After the fight last time, he watched an entire night of various fighting videos in regret, growing more unsatisfied with his own performance the more he watched.His absentmindedness during this moment caused great affront to that big bro. \u201cI\u2019m talking to you!\u201d He advanced and forcefully pushed Yue Zhishi\u2019s chest.Jiang Yufan grew frantic. \u201cWhat are you doing! Don\u2019t touch him!\u201dYue Zhishi took off his schoolbag and handed it to Jiang Yufan, hinting at him with his eyes before he turned around and said to the strong-looking boy, \u201cThis has nothing to do with him, let him go.\u201d\u201cThis little fellow sure is good to his friends.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not leaving.\u201d Jiang Yufan also wanted to take off his bag and chuck it together with Yue Zhishi\u2019s onto the ground, but Yue Zhishi stopped him and said, \u201cHold my bag, don\u2019t let it get dirty.\u201dOr else how would he explain it to Song Yu.Wang Jie stared at him, looking as if he wanted to fight him himself, but he was once again pulled back by the guy in the black clothes. He couldn\u2019t move and could only yell, \u201cYue Zhishi, come over here, I\u2019ll fix things for you.\u201d\u201cFix what, I still need to go home for lunch.\u201d Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t care about him and swept his eyes across the people in front of him. A bird flew across from the rooftops, its shadow passing over his pupils. \u201cAre you all coming up together?\u201dHis words were drowned out by the sounds of a bicycle braking and falling onto the ground. No one heard his perfectly heroic declaration right before a fight. But Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t discouraged at all, because the person who arrived was Song Yu.The moment Song Yu turned his head to look at them, his hair was blown into a rare moment of disarray by the wind. The messy hair looked very good on him, and even the alarm on his face was able to move someone\u2019s heart. His bicycle was chucked behind him, and the thick outer coat of his uniform was also chucked into a corner \u2014 he clearly had a light obsession with cleanliness, but he didn\u2019t stop to consider at all if something was dirty or how he should later tidy things up.Song Yu headed towards him with long strides as the light shined on his back. In Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart, this was the exact image of a hero arriving to save the day.Song Yu grabbed him by the arm and dragged him bodily behind him, just like when they were younger.\u201cWho the fuck is this?\u201d The strong-looking boy glanced at Wang Jie, looking rather dissatisfied with the expansion of the battlefield. Wang Jie also looked annoyed at this sudden unexpected appearance.\u201cI\u2019m his older brother.\u201d Song Yu took off his watch and passed it to Yue Zhishi. \u201cStand further away.\u201dSong Yu spoke to him in a very low, somewhat gentle voice. Yue Zhishi moved to stand in the wind and stared at the watch in his hands \u2014 it didn\u2019t look much different from when he\u2019d first bought it, still clean and new. It didn\u2019t look like it\u2019d been used for four years. The second hand ticked along on the watch face, and his heart accelerated with it.The other person wasn\u2019t as tall, but he wasn\u2019t afraid with his larger amount of people. He even looked Song Yu up and down, deliberately provocative. \u201cSo? You here to take his hits?\u201dSong Yu lifted his eyes, and the blue vein at the end of his eyebrow quietly twitched.\u201cI\u2019m here to hit people for him.\u201dHe was still in elementary school the last time Song Yu fought in front of him.That was when Yue Zhishi was being bullied the heaviest. He\u2019d greedily taken a few bites of the school provided cookies, and large sheets of red and swollen rashes had appeared on his face. After they saw the rashes, some of the boys who\u2019d previously ostracised him taunted him, saying he\u2019d turned so ugly, and surrounded him in a circle to stuff a few more cookies into his mouth. Too much time have passed, and Yue Zhishi no longer remembered how he\u2019d begged for help. He only remembered how Song Yu looked when he arrived, standing in front and sheltering him from everyone else just like a manga hero.But they didn\u2019t have a cool ending like in a manga series. One of them was decorated by fighting marks, and the other was disfigured by his allergic reactions. Lin Rong forced them to sit in at the entrance of Yanghe Qizhe like official mascots.In comparison to a fully experienced Yue Zhishi, Jiang Yufan clearly had no idea what he was seeing.\u201cWait \u2014 no way \u2014 your brother is this awesome\u2026..\u201d He watched as Song Yu, by himself, flipped the strong-looking boy. The remaining other people hesitated to get closer.Yue Zhishi held onto the watch. \u201cHe\u2019s taken taekwondo lessons.\u201d He then added, \u201cI have too.\u201dJiang Yufan stared at a tranquil Yue Zhishi with two wide eyes.No wonder he fought one versus four last time in the bathroom.The \u2018big bro\u2019 Wang Jie brought with him was nothing more than another paper tiger. Song Yu had seen this from the moment he entered the alleyway. He\u2019d worried that the guy would\u2019ve hidden some sharp weapons on his body, but after observing for a while, he noticed his clothes didn\u2019t have any pockets. His hands didn\u2019t have a single callus, so rather than calling him strong, it was probably better to describe him as someone with a high level of body fat.If the ringleader could be defeated first, it would be stupid to fight the followers instead. Song Yu didn\u2019t want to waste too much time on this scuffle, so he gave him a few side kicks to his chest. He couldn\u2019t hit too hard, or else he would have to worry about being pulled into the police station. He could only use clever methods to dispose of this big bro.\u201cZhang ge!\u201dOther than Wang Jie, the other people circled around Song Yu. A little bro with dyed red hair jumped up and wrapped his arms around the back of Song Yu\u2019s neck, wanting to pin him down for everyone else.Song Yu frowned and looked a bit annoyed. He grabbed the guy\u2019s arms and threw him over his shoulder to land heavily on the ground, the dust rising from the impact.No one dared to come closer after a succession of force. The Zhang ge on the ground was just about to get up when Song Yu kicked him again, several times in a row, to the point where Song Yu would only just lift his leg and the other guy would shrink backwards in reflex.\u201cWant to try again?\u201d Song Yu asked.\u201cI\u2019m so fucking unlucky today,\u201d the guy cursed as he retreated.Song Yu stood there with his arms hanging by his side. He rotated his wrists and said, face still clear of any expression, \u201cDon\u2019t touch him again. If I find out, things won\u2019t be as simple as today.\u201dYue Zhishi watched as Zhang ge stood up with his trembling fat body. He was just like one of those unimpressive villains in many manga series, retreating with a grey face surrounded by his people while spitting out words like \u2018I\u2019ll be back\u2019.Wang Jie was the angriest. Nothing had gone according to his plans. His eyes landed angrily on Song Yu, and his fists clenched.\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d Song Yu didn\u2019t bother to even look at him and went to pick up his outer coat from the ground.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in fighting a child.\u201dThe author has something to say:Qin Yan: Yet another day of being stood upPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He turned to look furiously at Yue Zhishi.What are you staring at, I still want to give you a punch back in the face. Yue Zhishi rudely glared back at him.Song Yu walked towards Yue Zhishi, took back his watch and lowered his head to carefully put it back on. \u201cIf they bully you, you can hit them back to let them understand you\u2019re not someone who can be bullied by just anyone. But if you keep punching them and I keep kicking them, then there\u2019s no way we\u2019ll be able to end things. Nothing is ever that simple.\u201dHe gazed into Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou need to learn how to handle and solve issues by yourself.\u201dJiang Yufan had been seriously holding onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s schoolbag in the corner, not making a single sound. As soon as he saw Song Yu come over, he very respectfully called out a \u2018Senior Song Yu\u2019. Song Yu gave him a slight nod and took Yue Zhishi\u2019s bag from his hand.Naturally, Yue Zhishi understand what Song Yu was trying to say. This matter couldn\u2019t keep dragging on until it turned into something from a television drama, where each party tried to get revenge on each other until no one knew how the situation truly started. Even though Wang Jie bullied classmates, charged protection fees and even cursed people, the words he said to Yue Zhishi at that time weren\u2019t truly aimed at him.Yue Zhishi rubbed the tip of his noise, stealing a glance at Song Yu, and gathered up his courage to walk towards Wang Jie. Wang Jie thought he wanted to hit him and said, posture already hostile, \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m afraid of you just because your brother\u2019s here! I\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you still remember the last thing you yelled at me that time in the bathroom?\u201d Yue Zhishi looked at Wang Jie\u2019s eyes.The emotions in Yue Zhishi\u2019s large eyes were almost imperceptible, but Wang Jie saw them and felt very uneasy. \u201cIf you want to hit then hit, what are you blabbering\u2026\u201d His words drawled away. He suddenly remembered what happened that day.Yue Zhishi continued, \u201cYou were right. That\u2019s why I was angry.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Wang Jie\u2019s words were caught in his throat. He got into fights, skipped classes, ran away from school, bullied classmates \u2014 he did everything teachers didn\u2019t want students to do. He\u2019d long grown numb to it all. These little things were nothing to him. He was just an uneducated, unskilled little punk who knew exactly what his future held: he would become a grown up punk who did nothing but laze around all day.He never expected to feel guilt over something he\u2019d yelled at someone in a fit of anger.\u201cBut it was wrong of me to hit you.\u201d Yue Zhishi lowered his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dThis was completely out of his expectations. Wang Jie was a bit lost. He\u2019d only wanted to take some revenge on the meddlesome Yue Zhishi, so he slashed his tires and looked for people to give him a little scare, so that he would never again dare to pretend to be a hero. But after hearing Yue Zhishi\u2019s words and seeing the traces of a bruise still on his face, Wang Jie was slightly flustered. At the end of it all, he was the only person trying to make himself seem stronger than he actually was.\u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t give me that kind of pathetic look.\u201d Wang Jie pretended to bluster, but his fingers were clutching his school pants. \u201cJust look at your panda eyes. Since I\u2019ve hit you as well, let\u2019s just call it even.\u201dHis voice weakened. \u201cThat\u2026 that thing I said, I didn\u2019t mean it. I\u2019m not that disgusting of a person.\u201dJiang Yufan interrupted in a low voice. \u201cBut you still bully other students\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because he talked shit about me first, he said my dad\u2026\u201d Wang Jie abruptly stopped. He looked very angry but also slightly awkward. \u201c\u2026He spread rumours about my family and even got our teacher to go through my desk and bag just by saying I stole from him. I may not have money, but I\u2019ve never stolen his money!\u201d He was a bit agitated by this point, eyes turning red, but he very quickly remembered he\u2019d had issues with the people in front of him. His tone changed. \u201c\u2026If he wants to lie about something, then I\u2019ll just go ahead and do it. What can he do? Cheng Mingming was asking for it!\u201dIt looked like even he knew his words were unreasonable, as a flush spread across his face to his ears.Yue Zhishi silently listened to him speak, his attention caught by his face. He suddenly realised the world was more complicated than he\u2019d thought. Even he himself wasn\u2019t solely a saviour filled with only courage and righteousness \u2014 it\u2019s just that he\u2019d heard the phase \u2018no parents\u2019 and had a part of his damaged heart stabbed. That was the only reason why he acted so unlike himself and rushed out to save Cheng Mingming.The person being saved, the person doing the saving, and the person committing the violence \u2014 not one of them was as black and white as the characters in a shounen manga. At this point in time, he couldn\u2019t tell whether it was Cheng Mingming or Wang Jie who was the victim in a case of school violence and who was the actual perpetrator. Maybe it was because they both played both roles that the violence and humiliation endlessly cycled between them.Maybe this was what Song Yu meant by being unable to end things.\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you can bully classmates. That\u2019s wrong too.\u201d Even though the not very mature him couldn\u2019t give them a way to break through the cycle, Yue Zhishi learned his lesson. He looked at Wang Jie\u2019s eyes and very seriously said, \u201cJust like how I shouldn\u2019t hit people.\u201dWang Jie was quiet for a few seconds, and Yue Zhishi gazed at him very directly, as if waiting for a response. Wang Jie had never met someone so strange before. He turned away his face awkwardly. \u201cI can\u2019t be bothered to argue with you. You\u2019re an obedient baby, a good student. I\u2019m not.\u201dHe then glanced at Song Yu, who was not very far away. Song Yu was looking at him too with a cool gaze. He was a bit afraid, but at the same time there was a subtle stirring of emotion in his heart. It felt like envy.It made him think of his most embarrassing childhood memories, and it made him slightly uncomfortable.Wang Jie cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m leaving. I\u2019m also sorry about today.\u201d He pulled out a crumpled 20 yuan note from his pocket and slapped it into Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand. \u201cFor your tire. I was saying how stupid this all was, but they were all egging me on. Now I even have to pay you back. Let me tell you, we\u2019re clear from now on. Let\u2019s pretend we don\u2019t know each other at school and keep clear of each other.\u201dAfter finishing his words, he picked up his school coat from the floor, shook off some of the dust and turned around to walk towards the opposite alleyway exit. His steps paused right before he turned the corner, ultimately turning to the right before he disappeared.Yue Zhishi lowered his head and looked at the note in his hand. There were some complicated feelings in his heart, but he didn\u2019t know how to describe them. He\u2019d originally thought it would be a grand and spectacular scene just like in television or manga series, him as the protagonist fighting back the bad guys before finally gaining victory.But he now realised there were few invincible protagonists in real life, and it was very difficult to find truly evil villains. They were all clumsy and awkward children, who would unintentionally do things because of their own impulsive natures. There were some who could laugh away those actions, but there were also some who would tumble deeper and deeper until their various emotions carried them away from their original intentions.If he\u2019d initially ignored Wang Jie\u2019s words, it was unlikely all these following things would have happened.However, if Yue Zhishi was given a chance to redo it, he would still choose to get angry at those words. But he would then choose to explain everything clearly to Wang Jie and request for him to apologise to his mother.The opposite alleyway exit was completely empty. Every single car on the street drove about frantically, but he didn\u2019t keep watching and turned away.He believed Wang Jie would\u2019ve apologised.Yue Zhishi arrived next to Song Yu while carrying those feelings. Song Yu passed over his bag and said, \u201cGo home for lunch.\u201d\u201cAre you coming too?\u201d Yue Zhishi raised his eyes.Song Yu faintly nodded, his face without a single trace of reproach. Yue Zhishi noticed and was very relieved. Jiang Yufan slid up next to him. \u201cThis didn\u2019t develop the way I\u2019d thought it would. I thought you guys would have another fight.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t fight, fighting\u2019s not good,\u201d Yue Zhishi strongly stressed to him, and to himself.Jiang Yufan patted his shoulder like a proud grandfather. \u201cVery good. You\u2019ve grown up.\u201dThe three of them biked back to the restaurant, Jiang Yufan slowly riding next to him in the back. Yue Zhishi noticed Song Yu rode with only one hand on his bike handle and felt it looked particularly cool. Jiang Yufan kept praising Song Yu, asking Yue Zhishi where he\u2019d learned his taekwondo because he now wanted to take lessons too \u2014 after adding everything together, Yue Zhishi thought Song Yu was cooler the longer he thought about it.This was the first time Yue Zhishi brought a friend to the restaurant. Lin Rong was especially happy, and she set about filling a large table with food:\u00a0rice flour steamed pork ribs with pumpkin,\u00a0steamed Wuchang-style fish,\u00a0stir-fried chicken giblets with pepper\u2026 Jiang Yufan was stunned.\u201cAre you still making more?\u201d Yue Zhishi tried restraining Lin Rong. \u201cI think it\u2019s enough\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you guys for a while. Here, try this\u00a0steamed beef brisket with vermicelli and chestnuts. This is the last batch of chestnuts from autumn. After this, we\u2019ll have to wait another year.\u201d Lin Rong lifted the lid of the claypot, a heavy aroma wafting from inside. She placed a spoonful onto Jiang Yufan\u2019s bowl of rice. \u201cHurry and eat, I\u2019ve been braising this for three hours. It should just melt in your mouth.\u201d\u201cThank you, Auntie!\u201d Jiang Yufan was a bit shocked and softly said to Yue Zhishi, \u201cAuntie is such a good person. She\u2019s so friendly and welcoming, not like Senior Song Yu at all.\u201d His last words were particularly quiet.\u201cHe\u2019s not like Uncle Song either,\u201d Yue Zhishi also quietly said. \u201cGe\u2019s personality is a bit of a throwback, he\u2019s like Lin Rong\u2019s dad.\u201d\u201cOh~ that makes sense.\u201dSeeing Lin Rong focus her entire attention on the classmate he\u2019d brought over, Yue Zhishi glanced at Song Yu, worrying he might get jealous, and wanted to serve him some food. He lifted his chopsticks and thought about it for a while before finally choosing the spare rib resting at the very top. It was a thick and juicy piece and looked particularly appetising. He was about to pick it up with his chopsticks when Song Yu set down a bunch of\u00a0mixed shredded vegetables\u00a0into his bowl.\u201cYou should eat more vegetables,\u201d Song Yu calmly said.Yue Zhishi was very happy and quickly placed that piece of spare rib into Song Yu\u2019s bowl. He even gave the piece next to it to Jiang Yufan, before he very delightedly put a piece of shredded\u00a0Manchurian wild rice\u00a0into his mouth. He felt like the most thoughtful person in the world.After finishing all of her cooking, Lin Rong sat down as well. It was pretty much just her and Jiang Yufan conversing throughout the entire meal, gabbing about Yue Zhishi in school and even bringing up Yue Zhishi\u2019s childhood. Yue Zhishi would occasionally say a few words, but he mainly focused on eating. To him, eating was very important, and people needed to focus on savouring their food.\u201cAuntie, I heard Le Le say he used to learn taekwondo when he was younger.\u201dYue Zhishi lifted his head at those words.Lin Rong nodded. \u201cFor a while. Gege took lessons for a longer amount of time.\u201dJiang Yufan then said, \u201cThat\u2019s too cool. Why didn\u2019t I take any lessons when I was younger, my mom\u2019s useless.\u201d\u201cPfft,\u201d Lin Rong laughed at him. \u201cI did think boys should learn some martial arts. I let them go because I thought they\u2019d look so handsome, and they could even strengthen their bodies. Especially for our Le Le, his body was so weak frail as a child, always getting sick. I even have a video of our Le Le struggling to kick the wooden boards with his little legs. He was so cute.\u201dYue Zhishi very seriously declared, \u201cMy legs are the longest in the entire class.\u201d\u201cYes yes yes. But who doesn\u2019t have little legs to begin with?\u201d Lin Rong continued, \u201cIt was quite difficult for him. In order to learn just basic skills, he needed to run ten laps around the training ground.\u201dSong Yu remembered something all of a sudden. He\u2019d been silent the entire time, so his abrupt laughter, while quiet, caught everyone\u2019s attention. The three of them looked at him, so Song Yu cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I just remembered one time a certain someone couldn\u2019t run, so the instructor had to punish him.\u201dJiang Yufan could immediately tell he was referring to Yue Zhishi. \u201cWhat\u2019d he punish you with?\u201dYue Zhishi thought for a while, frowning, before he suddenly remembered. At that time, he was the youngest out of the entire class, only six-years-old \u2014 there was no way he could\u2019ve followed along. Running just one lap already meant his butt would fall to the ground, let alone ten laps. The instructor unsuccessfully tried all kinds of different ways to get him to run before he finally thought of a method: tying a traction belt around his waist. He attached the line to Song Yu, who ran in front of Yue Zhishi and pulled him along.Even though Song Yu darkened his face and said he didn\u2019t want to, he still listened to the instructor and ran, carrying the little package behind him. The two boys in their white taekwondo uniforms ran in tandem until they finished at sunset, wheezing and struggling the entire way.The instructor laughed as he undid the traction belt. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s nice to have an older brother. You can keep going if your brother\u2019s with you.\u201dThinking about it now, Yue Zhishi found it extremely embarrassing. He brought up various conversation topics to try to distract Jiang Yufan from the punishment. Jiang Yufan never focused too much on one thing, and with other things to talk about, he completely forgot to chase up what happened.\u201cGege continued taekwondo until first year of high school. Le Le\u2019s body isn\u2019t as strong, so he stopped after graduating elementary. He\u2019s more suited to drawing classes anyway.\u201d\u201cTrue, Le Le\u2019s manga drawings are super nice. He\u2019s always asked to do our blackboard announcements.\u201dYue Zhishi relaxed after the conversation moved on. He pouted at Song Yu, who pretended he didn\u2019t see him and calmly poured himself a bowl of soup. Song Yu didn\u2019t eat much. He took a while to finish his bowl of fish soup and, right when everyone was about to finish, asked if there was any dessert.Lin Rong was reminded by his question. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I prepared a chestnut and taro cake today.\u201d She got up and went to prepare, cutting the cake into pieces before she returned. \u201cOne slice each.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d Song Yu said.\u201cThen why\u2019d you ask if there was dessert?\u201d Lin Rong asked. She then pushed his piece over to Yue Zhishi. \u201cLe Le, you eat it.\u201dYue Zhishi was very willing to eat a second piece of one of his favourite cakes. Most cakes in dessert stores were made with some form of wheat flour, and he could only look and not eat. He\u2019d been craving cake for a long time, and Lin Rong had been busy lately, unable to make him a delicious cake he could eat.The restaurant\u2019s head waiter called away Lin Rong for some matter, leaving behind only the three of them around the little round table. Song Yu\u2019s fingers tapped against his cup of black tea, and after a little bit of silence, he asked, \u201cHow come your cellphone\u2019s turned off?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s mouth was stuffed full with cake. He doubtfully blinked his eyes before looking at Jiang Yufan, who only then remembered. \u201cOh yes, his phone\u2019s with me.\u201d He pulled out Yue Zhishi\u2019s cellphone from his pocket. It really was turned off.Jiang Yufan rubbed his hair. \u201cSorry about that, I must\u2019ve used up all the battery during my phone call. My mom\u2019s super long-winded.\u201dSong Yu glanced at Yue Zhishi in understanding. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Eat your cake.\u201dBefore Jiang Yufan left, Lin Rong packed a few other flavours of cake for him to take home before sending him out. Yue Zhishi wanted to walk him out, but he was so full he could barely move. Seeing Jiang Yufan waving him away, Yue Zhishi happily sat down on the marble steps in front of the entrance and followed him with his eyes, pretending to see him out.Song Yu walked out after a while and sat next to him with half an arm\u2019s length in between them.This felt very familiar, involuntarily reminding Yue Zhishi of the last time they sat here together as mascots. He almost couldn\u2019t help but laugh.He vaguely thought a photo of them may have been taken that day, but because of how ugly he\u2019d looked, a younger Yue Zhishi had refused to let Lin Rong keep the photo in an album and clamoured for her to burn it.Yue Zhishi pursed his lips and twisted his head over to look at him. \u201cSong Yu gege, how\u2019d you know we were there today?\u201dSong Yu knew Yue Zhishi would eventually ask. He was the most straightforward child in the world, unable to hide a single thing. He\u2019d long thought of a way to divert Yue Zhishi\u2019s attention.He stretched out his right arm and showed Yue Zhishi his wrist.Song Yu\u2019s wrist was particularly red and looked like it\u2019d been sprained and slightly bruised. Yue Zhishi immediately forgot to interrogate him, his two hands lightly, gently cupping against the red area as if he was afraid to look at it. He then asked in a slightly pathetic voice, \u201cDoes it really hurt?\u201dAs if the one in pain was himself.Song Yu didn\u2019t say anything and simply watched him, observing him as if he was a little animal.\u201cIf you don\u2019t say anything, then it hurts.\u201dSong Yu flatly denied: \u201cDoesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\u201cIf you say it doesn\u2019t hurt, then it hurts.\u201d Yue Zhishi got up. \u201cI\u2019ll grab you an ice pack!\u201dSong Yu immediately pulled him back to sit. \u201cJust stop for a bit.\u201dYue Zhishi could only obediently sit next to him before he abruptly thought of something else again. He lifted Yue Zhishi\u2019s left arm and looked at his watch. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be late.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t dare believe him. \u201cNot going? You\u2019re going to skip an entire afternoon of classes?\u201dSong Yu bent one of his legs, rested his elbow on top and held up his chin. He then reached out and straightened his other arm, saying, his voice filled with a rarely seen laziness, \u201cI\u2019ve already gotten into a fight. Skipping classes is nothing.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d Yue Zhishi held his arm. \u201cWeren\u2019t you just telling me it\u2019s bad to fight, that it couldn\u2019t solve anything? Then you fighting and now skipping classes\u2026\u201dSong Yu interrupted him. \u201cIt\u2019s enough for our family to have only one good child.\u201dThe winds of late autumn blew up Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair on his forehead, exposing a bright, clear forehead and that pair of clear and transparent eyes.\u201cBut bad children will lead good children astray.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t often have any interest in exploring what made someone behave the way they did, but sometimes he was very curious \u2014 where did Yue Zhishi\u2019s many whys and buts come from, and what sustained his desire to frankly and candidly express his feelings? Was it an innocence that came from being overprotected, or was it an earnest foolishness embedded deep into his bones?His eyes always carried a sincere flame that never flickered out, as if he was very afraid Song Yu wouldn\u2019t be able to see it.Pure and innocent things always caused two extreme emotions.A desire to protect, or a desire to destroy.\u201cThen are you afraid of me leading you astray?\u201d Song Yu asked, gazing at him.The author has something to say:Those who worried about pacing, don\u2019t worry, after gege graduates and they\u2019re no longer at the same school, I\u2019ll speed up the plot!

He slowly blinked and said, looking relaxed, \u201cNo, why would I be? You\u2019re not a bad person, so how would you lead me astray?\u201d\u201cEveryone would rather I turned out like you anyway.\u201dSong Yu pressed his lips together. His answer was perfectly reasonable, and Song Yu probably could\u2019ve guessed his answer ahead of time. He merely couldn\u2019t find a way to reply to it.\u201cIt\u2019s cold outside. Let\u2019s go in.\u201dYue Zhishi had initially thought Song Yu was just joking, but he really didn\u2019t end up going to class and stayed in his room the entire afternoon without coming out. After eating dinner, Yue Zhishi worked on his homework on the tea table in the living room, but he found it hard to focus. He kept thinking about Song Yu\u2019s wrist, so he grabbed his phone and pulled up Baidu \u2014 he only typed in [what to do if your wrist slightly hurts], but he somehow found himself reading about all kinds of injuries, from sprained wrists to even fractured wrist bones.Yue Zhishi sat up in alarm and hurriedly pulled on a heavy knit outer-coat. \u201cAh\u2026 Aunt Rong, do you have any trash? I\u2019ll take it out for you.\u201d\u201cHow come you\u2019re so good today.\u201d Lin Rong grabbed a small bag from the trash can. \u201cJust this.\u201dYue Zhishi ran off with the trash in his hands.Cotton Candy lay on the sofa and watched him leave, wagging his tail.Yue Zhishi rushed back soon after, and Cotton Candy sat at the entrance to welcome him home. Lin Rong was busy with her yoga exercises and told him a plate of fruit was left on his desk. Yue Zhishi responded to her words and hugged the medicinal supplies he\u2019d just bought tightly to his chest, afraid she\u2019d see it, and bolted upstairs.After he placed down the medicine boxes, Yue Zhishi sat down to eat the small plate filled with pear and green apple slices while he studied an instruction leaflet.\u201cCompound anaesthetic patch\u2026 to improve blood circulation and to dissolve clots\u2026\u201dIt looked like the patch needed to be stuck on in order to stop the pain. Yue Zhishi lifted his head and looked at the time. Song Yu should still be doing his homework, but it felt like he might disturb him too much if Yue Zhishi just directly went over now. But what should he do if he went over later and Song Yu was already sleeping?He thought of a way to solve both issues.Song Yu was finishing his examination paper when he heard a knock on his door. He went to open it and didn\u2019t expect to see Yue Zhishi, who was carrying his schoolbag.\u201cSong Yu gege, can I do my homework with you?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked with an expectant face.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do some of the questions\u2026\u201d Cotton Candy staggered over to Yue Zhishi\u2019s legs as he spoke and hugged his calves. He asked again, \u201cCan I?\u201dSong Yu eventually relented, and Yue Zhishi happily went inside. Orange was sitting on Song Yu\u2019s bed, leisurely rolling a cat toy around his paws, and Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but be slightly envious.\u201cMove a chair over.\u201dOther than study materials and stationery, Yue Zhishi\u2019s desk was covered by many drawing tools he\u2019d saved up money to buy. Song Yu\u2019s desk was only one size larger, but there were much less things on it and looked extremely neat. Yue Zhishi grabbed a chair from the balcony as Song Yu went to find a book on his bookshelf, and he intentionally placed his chair particularly close to the desk, only a few centimetres away.\u201cSong Yu gege, you really didn\u2019t go back to school today.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Song Yu took out a book from his shelf.Yue Zhishi asked, \u201cYour teacher didn\u2019t try to call you?\u201d\u201cI said I was sick.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that lying?\u201d Yue Zhishi quietly said.\u201cFighting, skipping class, lying.\u201d Song Yu turned around and blankly tilted his head to look at him. \u201cAm I bad enough now?\u201dYue Zhishi very seriously considered his question, but a part of his brain was sighing with emotion \u2014 that pair of glasses really looked quite nice. Maybe he should also get a pair.Seeing Yue Zhishi daze off, Song Yu gave up on trying to get any useful reaction from him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say there were some questions you didn\u2019t understand? Which ones?\u201d He sat down as well, and pushed up the glasses resting on his nose. \u201cI\u2019ll give you fifteen minutes. I\u2019m heading to bed after that.\u201dYue Zhishi glanced at the desk. \u201cBut aren\u2019t you still doing your papers\u2026\u201d\u201cI only have one question left.\u201dLeft with no choice, Yue Zhishi could only brace himself and choose a random question to ask, worried Song Yu would see through him. But luckily, Song Yu didn\u2019t say anything, pulling over the question to seriously look at it.Yue Zhishi sat there, fidgeting, when Song Yu suddenly opened his mouth.\u201cYou just went out.\u201dThere were no traces of doubt in his voice, as if he was completely certain.Yue Zhishi widened his eyes. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t raise his head, gaze still focused on his question. He very casually said, \u201cYou smell like the cold.\u201dThe scent of winter.He phrased it so delicately. Yue Zhishi lowered his head to sniff at his collar, but he couldn\u2019t smell anything special. Rather, he immediately noticed the light shower gel fragrance on Song Yu\u2019s body. It smelled very nice and was as pleasant as the smell on his blanket, making someone feel at ease.But Song Yu didn\u2019t give him much time to explore the smells. He directly started talking about his question.The little Pomeranian jumped onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s thighs and nestled into his arms, one tiny head peeking out as he listened together with Yue Zhishi to Song Yu\u2019s explanations.He quickly swept his eyes over his chosen question, and Yue Zhishi thought he probably could\u2019ve answered the question himself \u2014 but as he continued to listen, he realised Song Yu was teaching him another method, one that contained less steps than the method his teacher taught in class. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t expect his excuse to turn into a real tutoring session and completely forgot about his medicinal supplies.\u201cDo you understand?\u201dYue Zhishi hummed in agreement and took back his workbook to hastily write down the entire method, afraid he would forget it later. After a long period of schooling, the usual flow of answering homework questions had long been engraved into his body; he naturally, without thinking about it, finished his initial question and automatically started working on the next. It was slightly more complex, and by the time Yue Zhishi discovered how to solve it, Song Yu had already finished his last question.He pulled off his glasses, placed them on the desk and silently rose up to get into bed.The orange cat jumped off the bed the moment he lifted the blanket, meowing once. Yue Zhishi also made a questioning noise.\u201cI finished my question, so I\u2019m going to sleep. Go back to do your homework.\u201d\u201cI, I still have something to ask, wait a second\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi frantically flipped through his workbook. Song Yu knew he was only looking for an excuse, so he grabbed the blindfold resting on the bedside table and securely put it on, looking entirely like someone ready to pass out for the night.\u201cGege, don\u2019t sleep yet.\u201d Yue Zhishi knew he could no longer continue pretending. Carrying the dog and his bulging backpack, he ran to Song Yu\u2019s bedside and plopped down onto the floor. He unzipped his bag and poured out a pile of medical supplies in one go.Song Yu frowned and turned over in heavy distaste. \u201cAren\u2019t you cold, what are you moving about so much for.\u201d He chucked a beige coloured cushion at Yue Zhishi.\u201cI\u2019m not cold.\u201d Yue Zhishi very naturally placed the cushion onto the wooden floor and sat on top of it with his legs crossed, Cotton Candy comfortably burrowing into his arms once again. \u201cSong Yu gege, I bought some medical supplies. Let me see your hand.\u201d\u201cNo need, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Song Yu coolly refused.\u201cThere is a need.\u201d Seeing it\u2019d be useless for him to keep asking, Yue Zhishi got up slightly on his knees and carefully lifted a corner of the blanket to look for Song Yu\u2019s hand, only to have his face covered by it.\u201cGo to bed.\u201dYue Zhishi took the opportunity to grab his hand. He was worried he\u2019d hurt Song Yu\u2019s wrist, so he only took hold of the front half of his fingers. He lightly cupped his wrist after Song Yu didn\u2019t show any signs of wanting to struggle. \u201cDoes it hurt? It won\u2019t hurt after I put on an anaesthetic patch for you.\u201dSong Yu sounded a bit impatient, but he didn\u2019t pull back his hand like Yue Zhishi thought he would. \u201cDon\u2019t bother, it\u2019ll look so ugly.\u201d\u201cBut I bought the most expensive one, it\u2019s meant to be very good. The auntie at the pharmacy said the pain will stop as soon as the patch is on.\u201d Yue Zhishi gazed at Song Yu\u2019s wrist, the bruising now more obvious than during the day. The wrist bone area was also slightly swollen, and the symptoms looked almost exactly like the ones listed online for a sprain.\u201cI already said I don\u2019t need it.\u201dIt felt like Song Yu was very resistant to plaster patches. Yue Zhishi tried offering something else. \u201cThen do you want to try this gel? The auntie said this can also be used to stop pain\u2026\u201d\u201cI just want to sleep.\u201d Song Yu interrupted his sales pitch.\u201cThat\u2019s fine, you can sleep.\u201d Yue Zhishi intentionally pulled the cat over and placed him into the crook of Song Yu\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019ll apply the gel for you. I promise I\u2019ll move so lightly you won\u2019t feel a thing.\u201dHow could he not feel anything.With the blindfold blocking his line of sight, Song Yu silently opened his eyes. He could still see some faint light shining through the blindfold, gentle and warm. Even though he clearly couldn\u2019t see a single thing, he could still completely imagine how Yue Zhishi looked as he knelt next to his bed.\u201cLet me apply some of the gel first. It might be a bit cool, the instruction leaflet said it contained some menthol.\u201dYue Zhishi investigated the instructions very thoroughly, reading through them more carefully than he did his homework. His hands were very warm, and it didn\u2019t feel too uncomfortable as he spread the ice-cold gel onto Song Yu\u2019s wrist.\u201cMassage it in. It\u2019ll absorb faster if it\u2019s rubbed in,\u201d Yue Zhishi muttered to himself. The sound of his voice was very light, as if he was very worried about bothering Song Yu. His two hands held onto his wrist, and he moved very lightly and gently as he massaged Song Yu\u2019s injury from the sprained wrist to the palm of his hand.It must be tiring to be constantly writing, Yue Zhishi thought. He decided to give Song Yu a very unpracticed hand massage.Song Yu could pretty much imagine Yue Zhishi\u2019s current feelings right now. He must be feeling very attentive, but at the same time, he was also probably slightly delighted, feeling as if he was like an adult who now had the ability to take care of people.This made him want to tease him.As Yue Zhishi kept massaging, he felt Song Yu\u2019s hand suddenly twitch and asked in alarm right away, \u201cDid that hurt? Was I pressing too heavily?\u201d He immediately apologised, but Song Yu said, \u201cAre you sure there\u2019s nothing wrong with the gel?\u201dYue Zhishi jumped in panic and pulled out the instruction leaflet. \u201cNo way, an allergy?\u201d He very nervously looked over Song Yu\u2019s wrist. \u201cWhere does it feel uncomfortable? Does it itch?\u201dThis was interesting. The usual scene was now flipped upside down \u2014 the person constantly sick and bedridden since childhood was now worrying about someone else.\u201cThere were no precautionary warnings?\u201d Song Yu steadily asked.\u201cWarnings? They\u2019re listed here.\u201d Yue Zhishi held onto that long piece of paper, carefully looked at it and recited the precautions out one by one. \u201cDo not use this medicine if you are allergic. Please be cautious if you have allergies. Please keep this product out of the reach of children. Children must be under the supervision of adults when applying\u2026\u201dHe heard light laughter as he continued reading.Yue Zhishi doubtfully raised his head. \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201dThe curve at the corner of his mouth was pretty obvious despite Song Yu\u2019s blindfold. Maybe because the blindfold hid his eyes, but Yue Zhishi felt the gege in front of him was a bit different from usual.\u201cSo it\u2019s not adults who should be under the supervision of children when applying.\u201d Song Yu spoke calmly, the teasing in his voice almost imperceptible.Yue Zhishi understood after a little while and realised Song Yu was making fun of him. He opened his mouth and very determinedly denied, \u201cI\u2019m not a child\u2026 right.\u201d He trailed off very indecisively.He actually wanted to go online and search up the legal definition of a child.Song Yu used his other hand and pushed up his blindfold, his two eyes peering out. \u201cI\u2019m just teasing.\u201dYue Zhishi was stunned, all the disapproving words he\u2019d wanted to say at Song Yu making fun of him disappearing from his mind.Since he was teasing him, that meant Song Yu gege truly wasn\u2019t feeling too uncomfortable. This was very important to him.\u201cMy hand feels much better. Go to bed.\u201d Song Yu turned off his bedside lamp and flipped over. \u201cTurn off the light for me.\u201dYue Zhishi stuffed all of the medical supplies lying on the floor back into his bag and stood up. When he went to grab his homework, he also placed the cushion Song Yu gave him onto a chair before softly moving out of the room. He stood at the entrance and turned off the light, ready to close the door, but then he abruptly noticed Cotton Candy looking at him in the middle of the room and wagging his tail. He ran back inside to scoop him up.\u201cThank you.\u201dHe suddenly heard those words from Song Yu, who had his back facing towards him.Yue Zhishi froze for a moment, foolishly standing there with the dog in his arms for two seconds, before he felt like a small and shrivelled balloon that was suddenly blown full of air.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201dAnyone could tell just from Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice that he was smiling very happily.The light from outside the room arrowed in and reflected the door\u2019s shadow on the wall. It continuously shrank as Yue Zhishi noiselessly moved away, gradually narrowing and narrowing until it turned into a brilliant and dazzling gap in between the door and the wall.\u201cGood night, gege.\u201d He heard Yue Zhishi say.The door was finally closed, Yue Zhishi taking away the last of the light.Good night, Song Yu whispered in reply.The author has something to say:Next chapter is another day of Le Le displaying the strength of his older brother complex!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Song Jin was home from his business trip and spent the day baking with Lin Rong, the entire house full of the smell of pastry and sweets. Song Yu came downstairs to make himself some coffee, and ended up being questioned by Father Song about his most recent grades and TOEFL results.\u201cDo you think you did well?\u201dSong Yu replied with a simple, it should be okay, and prepared to go back upstairs. Lin Rong called to him, \u201cXiao Yu, didn\u2019t you say yesterday you wanted a rug? I chose a woollen one for you from your auntie\u2019s store. It\u2019ll be delivered shortly, and we\u2019ll come up later to spread it out for you.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Song Yu coughed, as if his throat was a bit uncomfortable. \u201cWhenever is fine.\u201dLin Rong passed over a tray of wheat-free molten chocolate biscuits that had just come out of the oven. \u201cBring these up for your brother. Wait a second, let me pour him a glass of hot milk.\u201dSong Jin suggested, \u201cMaybe some yoghurt instead, it\u2019s good for the stomach.\u201dAfter his parents organised things nicely, Song Yu went upstairs carrying the tray. He passed Yue Zhishi\u2019s room and called out his name as he stood outside the door. He heard Yue Zhishi reply from within, asking him what was the matter.Song Yu frowned, feeling Yue Zhishi was being strange. \u201cMom told me to bring up some biscuits for you.\u201d\u201cOh! Then\u2026 then can you leave them outside the door for me? I\u2019ll grab them in a bit.\u201dAfter Yue Zhishi finishing yelling at the door, he heard Song Yu make a noise in response after a few seconds. He waited for a few moments before he went over to crack open the door, peeking out of a small gap to see if Song Yu was still standing at the door. Once he was sure Song Yu was no longer there, he relaxed and easily swung open the door, lifting up the tray left on the floor.\u201cWhat are you doing in there?\u201dBeing caught in the act, Yue Zhishi stretched his head out to peer around him. Song Yu stood a few steps away in the corridor looking at him, and scenes from Tom and Jerry filled Yue Zhishi\u2019s mind. Right now, he was the Jerry sneaking out of his mouse hole preparing to steal some cheese.Song Yu didn\u2019t say anything else and directly walked towards Yue Zhishi\u2019s room. But Yue Zhishi was faster \u2014 he dodged back inside and slammed the door closed with a bang.Song Yu, being refused at the door, experienced a complex state of mind he\u2019d never once felt before in the past eleven years of his life.He actually stood at the door, frozen, for a while.Early Monday morning, the two cleaned up brothers came downstairs and saw Lin Rong changing her shoes at the house entrance. She spoke in a hurry.\u201cOne of mom\u2019s friends suddenly got acute appendicitis, so I\u2019m going to the hospital now to take care of her. I didn\u2019t have time to make breakfast today, but there\u2019s some money on the table for you two to use.\u201dYue Zhishi noticed her scarf was still on the shelf. He rubbed his eyes and went over to wrap the scarf around her. \u201cBe careful when you drive.\u201d\u201cBe careful when you eat outside. Don\u2019t be too greedy.\u201d Lin Rong hugged him, said good bye to Song Yu and opened the door to leave.The cold air outside went straight to Yue Zhishi\u2019s ankles, causing him to slightly shudder. He stomped his feet in place before he ran back upstairs to put on a pair of long socks, taking care to hurry so he could leave together with Song Yu.Thinking of Song Yu\u2019s injured wrist, Yue Zhishi wanted to take Song Yu to school on his bike. His suggestion was obviously immediately rejected, and in the midst of a deadlock and the blowing of the cold winter air, the two of them chose to ride a taxi to school.The taxi was very fast. It was still early by the time they arrived at school, and Yue Zhishi was pretty much stuck onto Song Yu\u2019s body as they walked inside. He previously couldn\u2019t go to school together with his gege, so Yue Zhishi was in a fantastic mood now that he could openly walk next to him.But once they reached the breakfast restaurants, he could no longer move.\u201cI\u2019m so hungry.\u201d Yue Zhishi stood there and didn\u2019t move a muscle.Song Yu didn\u2019t say a single word. He chose the cleanest, most spacious looking restaurant and went inside, ordering some soup buns,\u00a0three delicacies beancurd skin\u00a0and a bowl of beef noodles.\u201cDo you want thin or thick noodles?\u201d the owner asked.Yue Zhishi looked behind the owner. \u201cDo you have macaroni?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d The owner swiftly poured some macaroni into a colander. \u201cI\u2019ll give you extra.\u201d\u201cThank you, boss!\u201d Yue Zhishi sat across from Song Yu and looked around the inner walls of the restaurant, menus plastered all over. After a little while, he opened his mouth. \u201cSong Yu gege, I want some red bean soup.\u201dSong Yu raised his head to glance at him and looked as if he thought Yue Zhishi was very troublesome. But he continued to not say anything and rose to ask the owner if he had any, only for the owner to say he didn\u2019t. \u201cI only have black bean soy milk. I think next door has red bean soup if you guys want some.\u201dSong Yu headed next door immediately after his words.Everything seemed to be happening according to Yue Zhishi\u2019s wishes. He stretched out his neck to look outside, and after making sure Song Yu truly disappeared, he quickly reached into his schoolbag and pulled out a pouch. He ran across, swiftly opened Song Yu\u2019s bag and stuffed the pouch inside.After disposing of his evidence, he went back to his seat and pretended nothing happened, obediently splitting apart two pairs of disposable chopsticks. Not long afterwards, Song Yu came back with some red bean soup.The bean paste was still very hot. Yue Zhishi took one of the straws Song Yu grabbed on the way back and poked it into the cup, swallowing a big mouthful of the sweet and soft soup.The owner\u2019s wife gave them their soup buns and two little plates full of vinegar and pieces of ginger. Yue Zhishi stood up and placed Song Yu\u2019s chopsticks onto his little saucer.The soup buns were stuffed with a mixture of chopped shrimp and minced beef. They were given eight pieces, little leaves separating the buns from the bamboo steamer. The shape of the shrimp and meat ball showed vaguely through the particularly thin and translucent skin. Yue Zhishi grabbed a bun, only for it to slip through his chopsticks like a water balloon and land in his vinegar saucer.The two of them didn\u2019t discuss it at all \u2014 Yue Zhishi directly opened the other straw on the table and jabbed it into the skin of the soup bun, taking a sip of the soup inside at the same time. \u201cYum!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of being burnt,\u201d Song Yu said. He may have commented, but he looked like he was quite used to Yue Zhishi\u2019s actions.\u201cThis soup\u2019s so sweet.\u201d Yue Zhishi tore open the skin after he finished the soup and dipped the ball of meat into his plate of vinegar before devouring it, leaving behind only the big piece of dough.\u201cYour noodles and the beancurd skin.\u201d The owner\u2019s wife carried the two bowls over. When she saw Yue Zhishi grab the soup bun\u2019s skin and place it into Song Yu\u2019s bowl, she questioned, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, is the skin no good?\u201d\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Yue Zishi dragged the bowl of noodles to him. \u201cI just can\u2019t eat it.\u201dShe nodded as if she understood what he meant and left after bidding them to add their own coriander if they wanted it.Song Yu very naturally ate the soup bun skin Yue Zhishi gave him and ate a piece of the beancurd skin while it was still warm. Three delicacies beancurd skin could probably be considered as the most filling breakfast dish.Pieces of pork, dried bamboo shoots and mushrooms were mixed with some glutinous rice before being marinated. The beancurd skin was made by grinding mung beans and rice together before frying the mixture together with some eggs. Once the bottom was cooked and turned into a skin, the piece was flipped and then wrapped around the marinated glutinous rice. It was then shaped into squares as it continued frying. The glutinous rice filling would be fragrant, soft and tasty, while the skin was crispy and golden.Most importantly, there was nothing in the entire dish that was an allergen to Yue Zhishi. It was also something Yue Zhishi very much liked to eat.They shared all of their breakfast items. Yue Zhishi ate a piece of the beancurd skin and then started attacking the noodle soup. He gave a piece of beef to Song Yu. \u201cI wanted to eat macaroni for a while now. I wanted to eat it like this.\u201d Yue Zhishi pierced one of his chopsticks through the centre of a piece and delivered it to his mouth. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem like Chinese-style spaghetti?\u201dSong Yu just felt he was like one of those early birds in the morning, chittering and chattering away. He normally wasn\u2019t like this \u2014 he was unusually excited today, as if he\u2019d successfully completed something important.\u201cTalk less and eat faster.\u201dYue Zhishi then focused, quickly eating four soup buns without skin, half a bowl of noodles and another piece of the beancurd skin. Everything else was finished by Song Yu. Lin Rong taught them from a young age to respect food, so whenever the two of them ate out, they would leave nothing to waste.There were more people walking in and out of the school entrance by the time they finished breakfast. Song Yu walked out with his bag, and Yue Zhishi jogged after him.The owner\u2019s wife stared in thought at their bamboo soup bun steamer. Her husband patted her once. \u201cAre you still sleepy?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d She frowned, looking very confused. \u201cThose two boys earlier were very strange. One only ate the meat filling, and the other one only ate the skin.The owner thought she was worried about something else. \u201cAiyah, children these days all have their own quirks.\u201dThe two of them separated on the third floor, Song Yu continuing upwards. He saw some of his classmates, and they made fun of him as he walked past.\u201cI saw you guys eating breakfast from far away. Your relationship with your brother\u2019s really good.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t say anything to refute their words.Not long after, the morning self-study session started, and the English teacher walked into the classroom with a book. Song Yu opened his schoolbag to grab his English notes and abruptly noticed there was an extra box in his bag. He found it strange and immediately pulled it out.His desk mate was a slightly gossipy boy with glasses and not much courage. He glanced at the box and was worried Song Yu would see him, so he pretended to loudly recite his vocabulary.It was a white box and looked like it was handmade. It was covered by a drawing of two people \u2014 one with curly brown hair and the other with black hair. The one with black hair had an injured wrist, yet it was the one with brown hair that had tears falling from his eyes. There was a large red arrow near their foreheads, and it pointed at the opening of the box.The desk mate looked at him through the corner of his eyes and saw an extremely disdainful expression on Song Yu\u2019s face. He thought Song Yu would throw it away, since that was what he always did with the frequent amount of presents he was given. No matter how prettily they were wrapped, he would never look at them for more than a glance.But he never expected Song Yu to suddenly open it. It was such a shabbily handmade box, and yet he opened it to have a look?The desk mate silently cried out in alarm. It looked like Song Yu preferred these types of presents.He started to get curious about what the box held.Song Yu unpacked it and pulled from inside a wad of\u2026Plaster patches? His glasses slipped down his nose in his surprise, and he immediately pushed them back up again, reciting his memorisation work as he continued to steal looks. Song Yu flipped each piece one by one, each patch carrying a drawing. Each drawing was different and covered each plaster entirely, and the wad of patches looked like they were a storyboard of scenes, just like a comic strip \u2014 the main characters were the two boys, one with curly hair and one with black hair.In the self-study classroom ringing with voices loud enough to be deafening, the desk mate accidentally heard Song Yu laugh. He sounded like he was amused, and yet he also sounded helpless. The noise was extremely unlike him, and yet it was also very miraculous.Song Yu didn\u2019t look at them for too long before he neatly packed those skin-coloured plaster patches away back into the box. He placed it into his desk drawer.This morning self-study\u2019s unsolved mystery stayed in the desk mate\u2019s heart for a long, long time.Both of the morning mathematic classes discussed their examination papers. Song Yu didn\u2019t have many wrong answers, so he spent the time doing new questions, his wrist still hurting. He paused his pen and stared at his wrist in consideration for a long while, until he finally pulled out the box in his drawer.He thought about what he\u2019d just casually said that day \u2014 that he didn\u2019t want to put one on because it was too ugly.Ever since childhood, every surprise from Yue Zhishi came from him sneaking and skulking around.Song Yu chose the plaster patch with the two people leaning the closest together. He carefully examined it and realised this was a very familiar scene: it looked like that time in fourth year of elementary school when he\u2019d won first place in a high jump competition, and Yue Zhishi had been so happy he jumped straight into his arms. But Yue Zhishi had used too much force when jumping and directly sent Song Yu tumbling onto the floor of the sport ground.When it came time for the awards, the top three winners stood on the little award platform, Song Yu on the highest level. The Yue Zhishi who had just entered elementary school ran in and appeared from the middle of nowhere, slipping straight behind Song Yu and hugging his legs. He\u2019d disrupted the entire award ceremony.Of course, Yue Zhishi had ended up being carried away by his elementary class adviser.Song Yu peeled away the plastic film attached to the back of the plaster as he walked out of his memories. He carefully attached the plaster onto his wrist, smoothing it out, and self-consciously tugged the sleeves of his sweater and outer coat to see if they could cover it up. He then pretended as if nothing happened and immersed himself back in his questions.After a busy class, the entire student population gathered downstairs to do some exercises. Qin Yan moved lazily, his eyes peeking around in all four directions, and coincidentally caught a glimpse of Song Yu\u2019s right hand wrist.What was that on his wrist, a tattoo??After they were released, he immediately ran to Song Yu and didn\u2019t say anything before grabbing his sleeve. \u201cWhat did you do to your wrist? SYU, you really are a man of culture, you even dared to go behind my back and\u2026\u201d The moment he held up Song Yu\u2019s wrist, Qin Yan suddenly turned into the\u00a0old man looking at his phone on the subway meme. \u201c\u2026put on a plaster patch?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s face changed and pushed him away, jerking his sleeve back down. \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about.\u201d\u201cWait, what is this?\u201d Qin Yan laughed like he discovered something new and exciting. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get such a cute patch? Did some girl give it to you! That\u2019s exactly the kind of patches a beefcake man should use! Hurry hurry hurry, I injured my shoulder two days ago while playing ball, give me one too.\u201dSong Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so stingy, I can give you money for it.\u201d Qin Yan started to unzip his uniform. \u201cOh shit, it\u2019s cold. Hurry up! Just one!\u201d\u201cIn your dreams.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 25: Fear of SeparationTime never moved forward at a constant speed \u2014 or at least, not in a physical sense.Yue Zhishi truly believed this as he worked on his physics homework over the winter semester break. He didn\u2019t know how the last semester passed by in such a fuzzy manner, to the point he seriously thought about looking up if scientists have ever done experiments on time. However, Lin Rong\u2019s phone call to him interrupted what may have possibly been Yue Zhishi\u2019s first ever paper research project.\u201cYes, okay.\u201d Yue Zhishi walked down the stairs as he talked on the phone. \u201cSong Yu gege went to cram school. I\u2019ll bring him there, I know where it is.\u201dPlacing down the phone, Yue Zhishi went to look for a leash to wrap around Cotton Candy and prepared to bring him to the vet for a physical check up.\u201cLet\u2019s get you all pretty while we\u2019re there, Cotton Candy. Your fur has been way too long lately.\u201d It was very cold outside, so Yue Zhishi wrapped himself in a thick white down jacket. The human and dog pair looked almost like two balls of cotton candy from far away.Since it was winter break as well as the weekend, the vet clinic was extremely full. Yue Zhishi saw many cats and dogs, and even chinchillas. He felt very satisfied, and secretly imagined himself petting and playing with them all. The older sister in front of him in the line was holding two large dogs, one Alaskan and one golden retriever. When the golden retriever was being examined, the Alaskan seemed to be very cautious about its surroundings, constantly pulling around wildly, and its owner almost couldn\u2019t hold onto it as she was also distracted by the golden retriever.\u201cExcuse me, would you mind holding onto the leash for me? He might be a bit scared, so I\u2019ll hug him for a bit.\u201d\u201cAh, sure.\u201d Yue Zhishi placed down the obedient Cotton Candy in his arms and used his other hand to help the older sister with the Alaskan dog\u2019s leash. Holding the leash of such a large dog felt very novel to Yue Zhishi \u2014 when he looked at his left hand holding onto the Pomeranian and compared it to his right, that hand pretty much was dominated by the dog and almost looked like the dog was walking him instead.The female owner knelt down to rub the Alaskan\u2019s head. After a few minutes, the dog quietened down slightly and no longer fussed around. Yue Zhishi could finally relax, thinking it was good thing Cotton Candy was a quiet and obedient dog, and fished out a dog treat from his pocket. He prepared to award it to Cotton Candy, but he noticed the other end of the leash he was holding was empty only after he turned his head. Cotton Candy was missing.Yue Zhishi panicked and searched the small clinic upside down, holding out Cotton Candy\u2019s favourite treat as he called out his name. It was useless, so Yue Zhishi ran out to the road and looked all around him. He was still unable to find any signs of Cotton Candy.He searched around and around that nearby area, and his first reaction was to give Lin Rong a call when his searches were all fruitless. But it seemed Lin Rong was too busy with her food importation issues and was uncontactable. He had no other choice but to call Song Yu.The call only rang once before it was picked up. It was like Yue Zhishi had finally found his saviour, the first words out of his mouth covered with tears. \u201cSong Yu gege, Cotton Candy\u2019s missing.\u201dSong Yu told him to calm down. Yue Zhishi took a breath, and his ability to think returned in a moment.\u201cLet\u2019s search for him separately. I\u2019m on my way home now. You\u2019re closer to Yanghe Qizhe, so go look for him there.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t know why Song Yu told him to search for Cotton Candy at the restaurant, but he went anyway. Right before he hung up the phone, he heard Song Yu say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll definitely find him.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s heart abruptly settled. He packed away neatly all of Cotton Candy\u2019s treats and took a taxi to Yanghe Qizhe.The restaurant wasn\u2019t open today. The courtyard gate was shut, no one and nothing inside. Yue Zhishi was very disappointed, having run until his body was covered in sweat, and he pulled off the hood of his down jacket. He looked around the nearby alleyways once again before he finally saw Song Yu come out of his taxi at the nearby road crossing.Song Yu was wearing the same down jacket as he was \u2014 Lin Rong bought one for both of them, one in white and one in dark grey. Seeing Song Yu\u2019s empty hands, Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t able to hide his disappointment, and he lowered his head apologetically.\u201cHe\u2019s not at the restaurant\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t look after him well.\u201dThe dog was brought home by Song Yu. Strictly speaking, it was Song Yu\u2019s dog.Yue Zhishi was extremely distraught and knew Song Yu must also be very concerned if he ran straight out of his cram school.But Song Yu wasn\u2019t angry like Yue Zhishi thought he would be \u2014 he merely pulled Yue Zhishi\u2019s hood and covered his head with it again. \u201cHe managed to escape his leash last time I walked him. There\u2019s something wrong with the leash.\u201dThe sweat on Yue Zhishi\u2019s forehead had already been blown dry by the cold wind. They stood there for a little while, Song Yu saying he\u2019d already gone back home to have a look. He\u2019d also paid attention to the roads while on his way here.Yue Zhishi turned even more distraught.\u201cLet\u2019s have a look again.\u201d Song Yu walked towards the restaurant.Yue Zhishi followed behind him, his heart already losing hope. He didn\u2019t initially feel it when he first came out, but the weather today felt especially cold, the wind cutting across his face like thin knives and penetrating into his neck.He pulled up his zipper with his head down and lifelessly walked behind Song Yu.Wind filled the alleyway, and all Yue Zhishi could think about was Cotton Candy wandering the streets alone by himself. It was almost Lunar New Year, and Cotton Candy was so small \u2014 he wasn\u2019t even wearing a vest today.He started wondering about the possibilities of asking for help on Weibo and posting missing notices all over the streets.Song Yu\u2019s footsteps suddenly froze. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t stop in time and bumped into his back. \u201cAh, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d He looked ahead, Yanghe Qizhe\u2019s entrance door in front, and there was an old granny sitting there with Cotton Candy by her side.The moment he saw Song Yu and Yue Zhishi, Cotton Candy flew over. Yue Zhishi immediately knelt down to wrap his arms around him, his heart recovering and feeling as if it was on a rollercoaster from all the emotions today. He pushed his face into Cotton Candy\u2019s fur. \u201cWhere did you run off to? You almost scared me to death, I was already thinking about how to hand out flyers.\u201dSong Yu headed over to the old granny. She looked to be around sixty years old, a strand of pearls around her neck, and was dressed quite well if almost over-dressed. She stood up as well, smoothing out the wrinkles in her wine red coat with her leather covered hands, and gave them a kind smile.\u201cSo the dog belongs to you two.\u201d Her hair was pure white, and she spoke very slowly. \u201cDid you guys come here to eat as well?\u201dYue Zhishi hugged the dog and met Song Yu\u2019s eyes. Song Yu said to her, \u201cYou might be thinking of the wrong date. The restaurant\u2019s not open today.\u201dPuzzlement covered the old lady\u2019s face, and she looked like she didn\u2019t entirely believe them. \u201cReally? But I wouldn\u2019t have remembered incorrectly. My husband made a reservation here for today.\u201dYue Zhishi doubtfully said, \u201cIt\u2019s really not open today. The owner\u2019s not here. Granny, are you sure you\u2019re thinking of the right date?\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d The old lady kept insisting she had a reservation. Yue Zhishi looked at her thin clothing and thought it wasn\u2019t good to keep standing here in this cold weather. He touched Song Yu\u2019s hand. \u201cSong Yu gege, did you bring the key to the restaurant?\u201dSong Yu nodded and pulled out his keys to open the door.Yue Zhishi went to support the old lady. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we head inside first? I\u2019ll help you look at the reservation list and see where the problem is.\u201dThey turned on the restaurant\u2019s heating and helped the lady sit down. Song Yu went to boil some water, and Yue Zhishi turned on the front counter\u2019s computer to pull up the list of reservations. They used to constantly help out here at the restaurant, so they generally understood how the restaurant usually operated.Hot water flowed into a transparent tea cup, the aroma of black tea blooming and spreading. Song Yu placed the cup of hot tea in front of the old lady.\u201cThank you.\u201dHe returned to Yue Zhishi\u2019s side. \u201cDid you find anything?\u201dYue Zhishi lifted his eyes and shook his head, softly saying, \u201cThere really aren\u2019t any reservations for today.\u201d He looked over at the old granny. She gazed at the entrance with a face full of expectancy and longing, as if waiting for someone to appear. Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cGranny, the list doesn\u2019t help. Can you tell us your husband\u2019s name? Or phone number?\u201dShe looked back at the two of them and opened her mouth with a smile. But suddenly, it was like she was caught on something in her mind, her smile dissipating away to be replaced by a look of confusion. \u201cMy husband\u2019s name\u2026\u201d She frowned and bowed her head to think. \u201cName\u2026\u201dSong Yu focused on her, feeling like something wasn\u2019t quite right.\u201cDo you remember what date it is today?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d She paused, and then her eyebrows relaxed, smile once again appearing. \u201cIt\u2019s the 21st of November. It\u2019s our silver wedding anniversary today, and we planned to celebrate it here.\u201dNovember\u2026 But Lunar New Year was quickly approaching. No wonder she was dressed so thinly \u2014 she\u2019d forgotten the date.Yue Zhishi once again looked at Song Yu and very quietly opened his mouth. \u201cSong Yu gege, is she\u2026\u201dSong Yu nodded. \u201cYes, Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201dThis might be slightly troublesome. Yue Zhishi thought to himself, the old granny forgot what date it was, and she may have even gone to the wrong restaurant. Her family might be looking for her in a panic now that she\u2019s lost, but they didn\u2019t even have a name or way of contacting her family.\u201cLet\u2019s call the police,\u201d Song Yu said.His voice wasn\u2019t very loud, but the old lady just happened to hear his words. Her mood immediately worsened, and she looked very resistant. \u201cPolice? Why are you calling the police? I just want to have a meal.\u201dYue Zhishi wanted to explain. \u201cGranny, you\u2026\u201d\u201cCan I order first?\u201d She looked at them, her eyes full of expectation. \u201cI think my husband might have been delayed by something, but he should be arriving very soon.\u201dYue Zhishi looked at her expression and wasn\u2019t able to reveal the truth. It was almost dinner time anyway. He took in a breath. \u201cThen what would you like to eat? There\u2019s only the two of us here today, so we might not be able to do too much.\u201dThe old granny smiled very kindly. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. We\u2019re very simple. Your pearl meatballs are my husband\u2019s favourite dish.\u201d\u201cAnything else?\u201d\u201cSomething else\u2026\u201dThe old lady once again sunk into her confused memories. Yue Zhishi could only take down her order. \u201cThen we\u2019ll go have a look first.\u201d He ran to check the restaurant\u2019s stock levels, and luckily it had glutinous rice and meat. Under his pleading, Song Yu somehow turned into the head chef and was pushed into the kitchen.Yue Zhishi brought out his ability to coax large cats, offering to massage his back and shoulders and actively wrapping the apron around Song Yu. Even though Song Yu was completely reluctant, he still didn\u2019t refuse Yue Zhishi in front of the old granny.Yue Zhishi came out of the kitchen and saw her gazing once again at the door, slight disappointment on her face.\u201cHe\u2019ll definitely come. Just wait a little while longer, granny.\u201dShe peered at Yue Zhishi\u2019s earnest face and abruptly gave him a smile. \u201cYou look better now than when you were child.\u201d She glanced towards the kitchen. \u201cYour brother too.\u201d She then added again, \u201cYou looked like a little western doll before.\u201dYue Zhishi was stunned \u2014 there truly was a large problem with her memories. She obviously didn\u2019t recognise them earlier when they met at the door, but she now suddenly remembered some things from when they were children.Perhaps she really did come here before.\u201cDo you remember which year you got married?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked.The old lady tried very hard to remember, but she still shook her head.\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t give up. He looked up on Baidu what a silver wedding anniversary was \u2014 it was a wedding anniversary after 25 years of marriage. The old granny looked to be around sixty years old, so if she got married around her twenties, she would\u2019ve been around her fifties when she first visited Yanghe Qizhe about ten years ago\u2026The timeline matched fairly well. They truly were quite young when the restaurant first opened. But\u00a0for the first two years, the management wasn\u2019t quite perfect and there weren\u2019t that many guests. All reservations were written down by hand and not recorded electronically.Yue Zhishi looked everywhere for the right key, before he finally found in a random drawer at the front desk the key to where all the old reservation books were kept. He knelt on the floor and grabbed out the dusty books. There was one book for each year, and he seriously looked through all of them, dust settling onto his face and causing him to constantly cough.Song Yu suddenly came out and poured himself a cup of water.\u201cFinished?\u201d Yue Zhishi tilted his head up, his face red from all of his coughing.\u201cThey\u2019re steaming now.\u201d Song Yu asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cThat granny should\u2019ve celebrated their anniversary here before. I wanted to check the reservation books from back when we first opened to see if we can find any guest records for the 21st of November. Maybe we can find a way to contact her husband that way, since we didn\u2019t have that many guests each day.\u201d Yue Zhishi abruptly frowned as he spoke. \u201cAh, but it\u2019s been so many years. What if he\u2019s changed his phone number?\u201dSong Yu shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think he would since his wife suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201dYue Zhishi was steadied by his words and wanted to continue looking through the records, but he was brushed away by Song Yu.\u201cGo spend some time with her.\u201d\u201cYou can go, I\u2019ll keep searching,\u201d Yue Zhishi said.\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk.\u201dYue Zhishi naturally took on the job after hearing those words. He stayed next to the old granny and spoke to her. She didn\u2019t remember many things, but every other sentence out of her mouth was about her husband. Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t describe what he was feeling \u2014 he was slightly heartbroken, but he wasn\u2019t feeling just heartbreak.\u201cYue Zhishi.\u201dHearing Song Yu call him, Yue Zhishi immediately rushed over.\u201cTry calling these.\u201d Song Yu spread open a book and gave it to him, pointing at the numbers he\u2019d circled in red. Yue Zhishi sat down and, just like Song Yu instructed, phoned the guests who\u2019d once had a reservation with them.\u201cHello, am I speaking to Mr Wang? I\u2019m sorry to disturb you, but I wanted to ask if you\u2019ve lost a family member\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, maybe we made a mistake. Sorry for disturbing you.\u201d\u201cAm I speaking to Mr Lee? Hello,\u2026\u201dThe phone calls went out one by one, and Yue Zhishi started to wonder about the likelihood of this method succeeding. He drew a cross after each unsuccessful phone number and lifted his head to see the old granny still waiting. Even Cotton Candy was influenced by her and sat in front of the floor-length window, wagging his curly tail, as if he too was also waiting for someone.After one hour, Yue Zhishi counted the remaining numbers. \u201cOnly two left.\u201dSong Yu nodded. He knew Yue Zhishi wanted to keep trying, so he didn\u2019t stop him and merely stood next to him.Yue Zhishi organised his emotions and once again dialled a number. The line was busy, so he waited for a little while before he decided to call the next number first.The last phone call was very quickly picked up. The other party\u2019s voice sounded very young, but it was the same as all the previous calls: they had not lost any of their family members, and they didn\u2019t know anyone suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s. Yue Zhishi was filled with despair, and he very much wanted to collapse onto the front desk if he wasn\u2019t also worrying about dirtying his white down jacket. He ended up resting his forehead on Song Yu\u2019s hand.Song Yu understood what he was feeling. He lifted his hand and wanted to rub his head, but it was then that the phone on the front desk suddenly rang. Yue Zhishi immediately lifted his head and picked up the call.\u201cHello.\u201dThe person on the other side sounded even more urgent than he did, his voice breathless from his panting. Yue Zhishi held onto his last shred of hope and asked once again \u2014 and he finally heard the answer he\u2019d been waiting to hear.\u201cYes, that would be me.\u201dYue Zhishi excitedly raised his head and smiled at Song Yu. \u201cOkay, then we\u2019ll wait for you here!\u201dHe belatedly felt like the other person\u2019s voice was very familiar after he placed down the phone, but he couldn\u2019t match the voice with a face. Cotton Candy ran over to circle around his legs, so Yue Zhishi picked up him and slowly walked around the dining room, observing the old lady from the corner of his eyes.She was still tirelessly, expectantly gazing outwards.The person she was waiting for finally arrived when the pearl meatballs finished steaming. Yue Zhishi was stunned as he looked out of the floor-length glass door to see the person pushing open the courtyard gate \u2014 it was one of their frequent guests, old Professor Zhang.Professor Zhang rushed over with quick footsteps and looked very worn out. He was usually very friendly and witty whenever he came over, and had never once looked this anxious and flustered.\u201cMei Yin.\u201d He pushed open the front door and called out the old lady\u2019s name.Yue Zhishi thought the dust was settling and everything was about to finish, and very happily crossed over to Song Yu\u2019s with a large step. It was at this moment that the old lady lifted her eyes, gaze full of suspicion, and said, \u201cYou are\u2026?\u201dSong Yu looked at them and lowered his eyes. He\u2019d long thought this would happen. But Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t understand; he frowned and looked almost even more upset than Professor Zhang.\u201cLe Le, Xiao Yu, I\u2019m sorry for troubling you.\u201d Rather than coaxing the old granny, Professor Zhang first greeted them. Song Yu shook his head and told him to not worry about it.Yue Zhishi saw Grandpa Zhang open the bag he was carrying. He\u2019d brought over a padded jacket, scarf and a hat. \u201cYou left the house wearing so little. What would you do if you got sick at your age?\u201d He unfolded the jacket and went to put it on his wife, but his wife rejected the jacket.\u201cWho are you? I don\u2019t know you.\u201d\u201cGranny, this is your husband.\u201d Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but go towards them. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember him?\u201dGrandpa Zhang gave Yue Zhishi a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Le Le. I\u2019m used to it.\u201d He pulled out some old photos from the bag\u2019s side pocket. It was their wedding photo from when they were younger. Another photo was them together in a group photo. \u201cMei Yin, look. We took these together. You weren\u2019t very happy about not having a wedding dress, so you put on a white skirt.\u201dStrand by strand, piece by piece, he carefully detailed their past history together, patiently putting back together her memories. The old lady was no longer so resistant and listened to him uncertainly. She gradually allowed him to help her put on the scarf and hat.At the very end, she looked like she finally remembered him. She kept grumbling about Professor Zhang having arrived so late, causing her to wait for so long. He apologised again and again and promised he won\u2019t be late to their next date.The granny\u2019s face was full of love. \u201cI ordered the pearl meatballs you love so much. Let\u2019s leave after we eat them.\u201dProfessor Zhang gazed at Yue Zhishi and Song Yu, and said, laughing, \u201cWe\u2019ll just take it home to eat. It\u2019s time for the restaurant to close.\u201dThe sky was already darkening, the street lamps lighting up pole by pole. Warm yellow light covered the dim alleyway. Yue Zhishi and Song Yu stood together at Yanghe Qizhe\u2019s courtyard gate and prepared to send the two elderly people on their way.\u201cGood thing you two were here today. A previous student wanted to speak to me about something today, and she ran out by herself during our quick chat.\u201d Professor Zhang\u2019s eyes were slightly red, his hand clutching his wife\u2019s. \u201cI usually get her to wear clothes I\u2019ve previously prepared for her. The pockets of her jackets would normally hold my contact number, just in case something like this happened. I don\u2019t know how my wife suddenly wore something else.\u201dYue Zhishi kept looking at the old lady and thought about the expectant expressions on her face.She changed out of her usual clothing and meticulously dressed up because she was celebrating an anniversary with the person she most loved.Professor Zhang lightly patted Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand and looked at Song Yu. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s late now, you two should hurry home. Don\u2019t worry your mother. I\u2019ll come by soon to pay my respects and to show my gratitude.\u201dSong Yu had kept quiet all this time and finally opened his mouth. \u201cNo need to worry about it.\u201dYue Zhishi leaned against Song Yu and nodded, smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Grandpa Zhang, hurry back, the pearl meatballs are going to go cold.\u201dThe old granny once again started to grumble at the mention of pearl meatballs. \u201cYeah, you made me wait for you for so long. You\u2019re always late every time we meet, and you didn\u2019t even bring me the flowers you said you would.\u201d\u201cAiyah, that\u2019s because\u2026\u201dFlowers?Yue Zhishi abruptly said, \u201cHe did bring some.\u201d He turned around and ran back to the restaurant and came back not long after. He slid next to Professor Zhang with his hands behind his back and sneakily gave him the item in his hand. Song Yu glanced at him and very cooperatively didn\u2019t say anything.Professor Zhang stretched out his hands. A slender narcissus flower was caught right as it was blooming.\u201cGrandpa Zhang prepared this for you.\u201d\u201cSo pretty.\u201d Even though it was only one flower, the old lady\u2019s face overflowed with happiness. She received the flower and carefully treasured it in her hands. After three more rounds of goodbyes, the two of them slowly walked away, nestling against each other as they left.A gust of wind blew past, and Yue Zhishi hunched up his shoulders to protect his neck from the cold. Looking from far away, the city lights covered and blurred away the two people\u2019s silhouettes.\u00a0 His nose started to ache, and perhaps it was from the cold, but the ache trickled into his heart.He stood at the door. The alleyway, the winter night, the courtyard gate to Yanghe Qizhe and even the glow of light spilling from the street lamps \u2014 they were all very familiar sights to Yue Zhishi. He was lost in his thoughts as he gazed at the wall across from them.\u201cI don\u2019t want to forget you,\u201d Yue Zhishi suddenly said.Song Yu turned to look at him. There was a very complicated look in his eyes, as if he was confused and thought he\u2019d heard something wrongly.There was a street lamp above his head, and it sent light downwards to wrap around Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. His soft brown hair glimmered golden, the tip of his nose and his cheeks flushed red from the cold. His eyes were very bright.\u201cXiao Yu gege, I don\u2019t want to forget you.\u201d He looked into Song Yu\u2019s eyes.Song Yu froze for two seconds and then turned his face away.\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying.\u201dYue Zhishi knew he was saying groundless, silly words, so he didn\u2019t respond. He\u2019d just felt so heartbroken looking at the old granny \u2014 he didn\u2019t have someone he loved like she did and couldn\u2019t understand how it felt to forget the person he loved. But he tried to imagine how it would feel to one day forget Uncle Song, Aunt Rong.He even imagined how it would feel to forget Song Yu.His heart stung, and it even felt like it was being tightly, fiercely squeezed, unable to be released.\u201cI won\u2019t forget you,\u201d Yue Zhishi said once again.Song Yu was also lost in his thoughts right before Yue Zhishi opened his mouth. To be the one forgetting, or to be the one forgotten \u2014 which one was more painful. If he had a choice, which one would he choose to be.He couldn\u2019t find an answer. He pulled off his own scarf and threw it onto Yue Zhishi.\u201cYou\u2019ve pretty much forgotten all of your childhood already.\u201d\u201cI remember a lot, I only forgot small bits and pieces. I remember all the important things.\u201d His stomach growled just as he finished speaking and ruined the solemnity of all the words he\u2019d just spoken.Song Yu stuffed his two hands in his trouser pockets and turned around to enter the yard. \u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201d\u201cWe have food?\u201d Yue Zhishi quickly entered as well.\u201cPearl meatballs,\u201d Song Yu said. \u201cI made an extra portion.\u201d\u201cReally?!\u201dCotton Candy flew out the moment they opened the restaurant door and went to stand by his legs. Yue Zhishi picked him up again and cuddled him. \u201cYou little thing, even though you weren\u2019t obedient and sneaked away by yourself, you did something important today. You helped us find a lost granny, so I won\u2019t punish you this time.\u201d\u201cWoof!\u201d Cotton Candy made a noise in his arms.\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Yue Zhishi held Cotton Candy and doubtfully asked, \u201cGege, how did you immediately think to look for Cotton Candy here?\u201dSong Yu came out of the kitchen and placed the pearl meatballs warmed by a low fire onto the table. He lifted his eyes for a look before he lowered them again. \u201cI actually found Cotton Candy here by the door of the restaurant.\u201dYue Zhishi looked at Cotton Candy, and the dog tilted his head to look back at him.\u201cWhen was this? I didn\u2019t even know.\u201d\u201cYou were in third year of elementary school and had gone to winter camp at Hainan.\u201dYue Zhishi remembered. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I came back then and saw there was a Cotton Candy at home.\u201d He\u2019d asked where the dog came from, and Song Yu hadn\u2019t said much, only that he\u2019d picked up the dog from the streets.Song Yu poured a cup of hot water, his hand circled around it. \u201cIt was also night time that day I found him. It was very cold, and he was huddling against the wall of the courtyard gate in a very small ball. He was a bit dirty, but his eyes were very bright.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t understood at that time why he decided to be so kind-hearted and pick up a small dog, but he\u2019d known that once he brought it home, he needed to be responsible for it.Song Yu hadn\u2019t understood until Yue Zhishi had come home from Hainan, looked at the little dog ecstatically and wrapped his arms around him in his joy, his pair of eyes shining and glittering at him.\u201cSo that\u2019s why. So good, Cotton Candy seems to have a good memory and remembered where his old home was.\u201d Yue Zhishi continued to carry Cotton Candy and placed a pearl meatball in his mouth. The soft and sticky glutinous rice and chewy ball of meat were meant to be eaten togeher, the separate delicious flavours doubling. He chewed carefully, eyes empty, and glanced at the messy front desk. He looked at those notebooks that carried the history of this restaurant.After swallowing, he sighed with feeling. \u201cDiseases like that are so scary. You clearly want to remember everything, but you end up forgetting even your favourite person. You forget how they look, and even their name.\u201dSong Yu stared at Yue Zhishi. Under the restaurant\u2019s lights, Yue Zhishi\u2019s profile softened and looked a little young and ignorant.He opened his mouth, his voice as somber and indifferent as always. His words were very realistic.\u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t because of a disease, memories aren\u2019t something you can control. It also doesn\u2019t mean your feelings won\u2019t change just because you don\u2019t forget someone. Maybe after a very long time, you still remember this person\u2019s existence \u2014 but his place in your heart is already very different. Compared to being forced to forget someone because of Alzheimer\u2019s, it\u2019s even more tragic to have that kind of ending.\u201dRelationships between people were always very delicate and fragile. Everyone continuously walked forward, moving in every single direction. People were like hasty ants, always so lost in their own busyness that they lose contact with the people around them. That was why Song Yu hated establishing deep personal relationships: he\u2019d rather save his efforts and avoid danger to his heart in advance.\u201cIn this world, it is so easy for people to lose one another.\u201dLose.Song Yu\u2019s words were a bit too profound for Yue Zhishi. He seemed to understand what Song Yu was saying, but at the same time he didn\u2019t \u2014 and this made him feel very vaguely melancholy. He thought about the feeling of losing Cotton Candy, thought about the granny foolishly waiting in front of Yanghe Qizhe\u2019s door and released a sigh just like an adult, the white fog floating up and covering his eyes.Seeing him like this, Song Yu actually wanted to slightly laugh. He wanted to say, let\u2019s eat, don\u2019t think about it anymore, but he didn\u2019t have the chance to open his mouth.\u201cWe won\u2019t lose each other.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s empty, yet determined eyes gathered onto his body.Song Yu looked at him and stayed silent for a moment. Yue Zhishi was very clear that his silence meant he didn\u2019t agree, so he continued, \u201cIf we separate from each other, I\u2019ll definitely try my best to find you.\u201dHis expression was so serious, so earnest, and he spoke as if his words were true and beyond doubt.\u201cNo need.\u201dSong Yu refused him very decisively, frustrating Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart. But in the next second, he heard Song Yu continue.\u201cYour sense of direction is too terrible.\u201d Song Yu gave him another meatball and looked into his pair of confused eyes.\u201cJust stay where you are and wait for me.\u201dThe author has something to say:It\u2019s already winter break, are gege\u2019s college entrance examinations still far away?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26: To Be Dependent on Someone Else\u2019s GraceYue Zhishi had been very eager for winter break, but as a year three student soon to face the high school entrance examinations, his actual holiday was pitifully short at only seventeen days. He spent three days catching up on sleep at the very start of the break, and one fifth of his holiday disappeared. The few days celebrating Lunar New Year also flew by very quickly, and in the blink of an eye, only half of his break remained.This feeling was almost exactly how it felt to chase after manga chapter updates \u2014 new chapters were eagerly, keenly opened, but before you felt like you\u2019ve read enough, there was no more and you could no longer continue.Holidays never lasted long enough.Song Yu went back to school one week earlier than he did, and Yue Zhishi lonesomely worked on his homework by himself. The night before starting school again, he grabbed the homework questions he couldn\u2019t do and went to Song Yu\u2019s room. Song Yu was in the shower, so Yue Zhishi held his notebook and spun in circles where he stood, the new rug on the floor soft and comfortable underneath his feet. When he sat on it, he no longer felt the cold floor.He saw Song Yu\u2019s schoolbag on the floor, still yet to be packed away, and unintentionally glanced inside to see a few pouches of cat food.Why was gege bringing cat food to school? To give to friends?Yue Zhishi was too lazy to think too much about it. Since Song Yu wasn\u2019t in the room, he pulled out a raspberry flavoured lollipop from his pyjama pockets and threw it into his bag.Everyone started to feel the pressure of the upcoming high school entrance examinations after school resumed, and the study atmosphere around the school thickened heavily compared to before. The first round of mock exams arrived after only one week of classes. Yue Zhishi\u2019s results weren\u2019t too bad: he took first place in English, and his other scores were all in the upper ranges of his class. Even though his grades weren\u2019t at the very top, they were always very consistent, and he should have no problems entering Peiya high school\u2019s advanced classes. Lin Rong and Song Jin had also never truly required certain results from Song Yu and Yue Zhishi, so the two of them had a healthy mindset and weren\u2019t too nervous about their entrance examinations.Yue Zhishi was someone who was very clear about when to play and when to study. He would always finish his homework during the evening self-study sessions, his efficiency and focus at their very highest while he waited for gege to finish class. As long as he finished all of his work, he would be able to bike home together with Song Yu and might even be able to eat some late night snacks together \u2014 it was an unparalleled incentive.\u201cI\u2019m so jealous. It\u2019s not like you don\u2019t play around at all, and yet your scores are still so good.\u201d Jiang Yufan was completing his flower bed cleaning duties for this week and was holding a broom higher than his head. He didn\u2019t pay attention to where he was sweeping, and accidentally swung the broom at Yue Zhishi. \u201cYour brother must\u2019ve given you some private attention over the winter break.\u201dYue Zhishi took the broom with a move like one of those martial artists in a television drama before he cleanly confessed, \u201cHe didn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t have time to tutor me.\u201d\u201cWhat was he so busy doing over the break?\u201d\u201cSleeping.\u201d Yue Zhishi dropped the broom down and went to rescue the packaging of an instant noodle packet. It\u2019d been blown away by the wind just after being swept over. \u201cHe slept for over ten hours every day, and after he woke up, he stayed in his room to watch movies or documentaries. Stuff like\u00a0Earthflight\u00a0or\u00a0Voyage of the Continents.\u201d\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cI watched them with him after I finished my homework.\u201d But he\u2019d lost focus more often than not and ended up falling asleep in Song Yu\u2019s bed.A girl who was on cleaning duty with them interjected, \u201cIt must be nice to have an older brother at home. I want an older brother too.\u201dYue Zhishi completely agreed with her and even wanted to share his wonderful experiences of having a gege with her, but another girl spoke before he did. \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about having an older brother? Mine annoys and bullies me every day. I always wanted someone to take him away when I was younger.\u201dShe placed her iron dustpan on the floor after speaking, her face mysterious and yet slightly happy. \u201cBut I\u2019ll soon escape from my days of suffering.\u201dJiang Yufan was very curious. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cMy mom agreed to let me go overseas for high school, and I just happen to have an aunt in Australia.\u201d She then shared how she spent the winter break choosing high schools and preparing for the IELTS. Yue Zhishi focused on sweeping the instant noodle packaging into the iron dustpan and searched for his next target.\u201cYou\u2019re leaving for overseas already?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty normal. A lot of students in the high school department aren\u2019t taking the college entrance examinations either,\u201d the girl said.That\u2019s right. Yue Zhishi paused and leaned against the broom, nodding his head inside his mind. He thought of Song Yu as he listened to the girls talk uneasily about Peiya\u2019s examinations. Song Yu should be taking the college entrance examinations, but this was only a faint belief in Yue Zhishi\u2019s mind. He wasn\u2019t actually sure.Coincidentally, after they got home that night, Yue Zhishi was heading downstairs after his shower to grab his cell phone on the sofa. He just happened to hear Father Song talking very casually with Song Yu about various things happening at school. He walked up the stairs and heard Uncle Song say, \u201cHonestly, there are pros and cons for studying in country or going overseas. I think you already know what you want to do, and I\u2019ll support you no matter what you choose.\u201d\u201cMn.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s footsteps suddenly stopped as he heard those words, and his thoughts were thrown into disarray.\u201cYue Zhishi.\u201d Song Yu abruptly called his name. Yue Zhishi froze and turned his head to look at him.Song Yu stared at him and said after a little while, \u201cSleep early. Come with me to school tomorrow.\u201dHe\u2019d thought gege had found the lollipop in his bag.\u201cOkay, I understand.\u201d Yue Zhishi went back upstairs into his room.He thought again about what that female classmate had said earlier that day.Song Yu should be going overseas for college, right?Even though he\u2019d promised to sleep early, Yue Zhishi was unable to fall asleep all night. He climbed out of bed, opened his notebook and went online with questions like \u2018how to apply for high school overseas\u2019. However, for every question he typed in, the most information he would find were advertisements for overseas education agencies, and he found the general process utterly confusing. The only substantial information he obtained was that studying overseas required a lot of money \u2014 a lot more than he\u2019d initially expected.So then he spent a long amount of time calculating how much allowance money he\u2019d managed to save over the last few years.Yue Zhishi was ridiculously sleepy the next day. He forced himself out of bed and was completely dazed the entire way to school. He knew he would fall asleep, so he very purposefully chose to stand up when memorising his Chinese classics and stood for the entire morning self-study.He realised, as long as he\u2019d never paid attention to something before, it wasn\u2019t really all that important \u2014 but once he noticed it, that something would appear in front of him often enough that it was almost scary.For example \u2014 the advertisement for an overseas education agency plastered in front of the cafeteria entrance, the list of students going on an overseas study exchange on the notice board, or even a teacher randomly mentioning older students who were now studying in Ivy Leagues during class.During the Chinese literature class that afternoon, the teacher was talking about past papers from previous high school entrance examinations. Yue Zhishi\u2019s Chinese literature grades have never been especially good, particularly in reading comprehension. He\u2019d always felt he understood what the passages were talking about, and it was just that his way of thinking was different from the person creating the answers.It was always possible even the authors themselves had no idea their writing could be read that way.\u201cNext, let\u2019s look at the section on the Classics. This past exam chose to focus on\u00a0Dream of the Red Chamber,\u201d the Chinese literature teacher said as he pushed up his glasses. \u201cThe first question. Characters in literature are often multi-faceted. Lin Daiyu in\u00a0Dream of the Red Chamber\u00a0is undoubtedly a very classic female example in literature. Using examples from the book, please briefly explain her personality characteristics and how those characteristics originated.\u201dPersonality characteristics. Yue Zhishi leaned his chin against his desk. His first thought was that she was literarily talented since she was very good at writing poems, but he suspected that didn\u2019t quite count as part of her personality.The teacher fortunately didn\u2019t pick him to answer and chose another student instead. That student stood up, and the first thing he said was, \u201cAlways worried and anxious.\u201d\u201cOkay, then can you now explain why she\u2019s like that?\u201dThe student loudly said, \u201cBecause she had to depend on others for a roof over her head.\u201d Questions for\u00a0Dream of the Red Chamber\u00a0should all be very similar, constantly linking Lin Daiyu with her dependence on someone else\u2019s grace and causing students to automatically blurt out that answer without too much thought.\u201cGive us a bit more details. Explain how her personality was affected by needing to live in someone else\u2019s house and rely on other people\u2019s generosity,\u201d the teacher directed.He thought for a while. \u201cSince her parents both died when she was young, she needed to go to someone else\u2019s place to live.\u201dThe Yue Zhishi who had been seriously listening suddenly felt a bit strange. He self-consciously sat up straight and fiddled with the pen on top of his desk.\u201cAnd then she definitely couldn\u2019t act the same way in someone\u2019s else home like she could in her own. She\u2019d be scared of saying some things and wouldn\u2019t dare do other things, and even the money she used belonged to other people.\u201d The other students in the class were all amused by this student\u2019s simple and straightforward explanation, and yet Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t find it funny at all.The teacher looked like he was satisfied with that answer and cited the original text. \u201cThat\u2019s right. She needed to be careful about every single one of her movements, always paying attention to everything she did. She couldn\u2019t say a single extra word or walk just one extra step, for fear of being sneered at by others.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I mean.\u201d That student continued, \u201cBesides, the other family treated her so well despite not being actually blood-related. So she was even more anxious and sensitive and would always think a lot about things.\u201dYue Zhishi blinked and stared at the paper. He covered up his own answer of \u2018overflowing with literary talent\u2019 with some correction tape and wrote \u2018always worried and anxious\u2019. But after he looked at those words for two seconds, he covered it up again, this time with slightly impatient movements. Not only was he not able to cover up those words, the corner of the correction tape dispenser even tore a piece off the previous piece of tape he\u2019d laid down and revealed two words: \u2018literary talent\u2019.\u201cTo be dependent on someone else\u2019s grace \u2014 well done.\u201dThe teacher gave that evaluation to his answer.\u2013Yue Zhishi had been very obedient as of late.As soon as he reached the monthly break, he ran to help Lin Rong as soon as he finished with his homework. Lin Rong was afraid he\u2019d be too tired so didn\u2019t let him do anything, but Yue Zhishi worked in spite of her words anyway, wiping down tables, washing the dishes or anything that needed to be done. Even the workers in the restaurant found his behaviour very strange.As soon as the phone rang, Yue Zhishi was the first one to run over and pick up the phone call in place of the front desk lady who\u2019d gone to the bathroom. \u201cHello, this is Yanghe Qizhe\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026what?\u201d Yue Zhishi was immediately shocked upon hearing the other party\u2019s words. He placed the phone down and ran to the break room. \u201cAunt Rong, is your cell phone off?\u201dLin Rong was choosing the layout of the new menu. She reached for her phone and said, \u201cAh, it really is turned off.\u201d\u201cGrandpa\u2019s in the hospital,\u201d Yue Zhishi said very urgently.The grandpa Yue Zhishi referred to was Song Yu\u2019s grandpa. He had two sons, and Song Jin was the younger of the two.In earlier years, the Song family didn\u2019t live in great economic conditions. Song Jin grew up in poverty and later started a business all by himself in order to gain his current economic freedom. Song Jin had always wanted to provide for his father, but his older brother had always refused to let him.Older Uncle Song, as the oldest son in the family, believed he and his family should be the ones to take care of Grandpa Song. Song Jin could only compromise by sending over a large amount of money for support every month in order to let his father live a bit more comfortably. He didn\u2019t expect his father to suddenly have an accident. Grandpa Song had been changing a light bulb while at home by himself and had accidentally slipped off his chair, breaking his right arm. Older Uncle Song hadn\u2019t been able to find a hospital bed, so he had no choice but to come find his younger brother.Lin Rong immediately went to find one of her friends and organised a VIP hospital room, while Song Jin also prepared to fly back to the country as early as possible. Since it happened to be the monthly break, Song Yu and Yue Zhishi also rushed to the hospital.Yue Zhishi held a very deep affection towards Grandpa Song. He\u2019d lived in his house for a little while when he\u2019d been in elementary school. Grandpa had taught him how to play spinning tops in the park and had brought him to play on random exercise machines in their neighbourhood. During summer breaks, Grandpa had even lived with them occasionally and had cooked very yummy crayfish for him to eat.So when he and Song Yu headed over, Yue Zhishi purchased a very large, very beautiful basket of fruit with his now extraordinarily precious allowance money. Song Yu scoffed at the heavy bag he was bringing to the hospital and even said only stupid people would buy fruit baskets from stores in front of the hospital, but Yue Zhishi thought it was money well spent as long as the fruits were still edible. Besides, it looked impressive to be carrying in a large fruit basket anyway.Song Yu was too lazy to argue, but he did help take his heavy impressiveness from him.The entrance to the VIP section of the hospital was very peaceful. Before they went inside, the two of them had thought they would see a very weak and fragile elderly person resting on the bed. But unexpectedly, Grandpa was brimming with as much energy and vigour as a dragon as he watched the\u00a0Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils\u00a0television drama, even almost getting off his bed once he saw his two grandchildren.\u201cBe careful, don\u2019t move around for no reason.\u201d Song Yu placed down the fruit basket. \u201cYue Zhishi bought this for you.\u201d\u201cAiyah, such a large basket. Too bad I don\u2019t have any roommates to show it off to \u2014 single hospital rooms are too boring.\u201dSong Yu shook his head in his mind, thinking Yue Zhishi should be the actual blood-related grandchild. He went and told his grandpa about the things he needed to pay attention to after his orthopaedic surgery.\u201cAh, Xiao Yu, how come you\u2019re still like this? You\u2019re even more boring than I am.\u201d Grandpa gave Yue Zhishi a look. \u201cLe Le, did you bring the thing I asked for?\u201dYue Zhishi hummed in agreement and dropped his schoolbag onto the sofa, pulling it open. Song Yu only then found out why his bag was so heavy \u2014 the entire set of the\u00a0Dragonball\u00a0manga series was inside.Song Yu sighed, \u201c\u2026Grandpa, you need to rest.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Grandpa put on his reading glasses and opened a volume. \u201cThere\u2019s such a comfortable bed here, and I even have manga to read. There\u2019s no rest better than this.\u201dYue Zhishi introduced the overall storyline to Grandpa and tore open the plastic covering of the fruit basket. He grabbed an apple and prepared to wash it, but Grandpa told him the water faucet in the room was broken and yet to be fixed. He could only head outside to rinse the apple.\u201cTurn right, then walk straight down the corridor. Then turn left.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201dYue Zhishi chose the largest apple he could see and followed Grandpa\u2019s directions to the public toilet. He didn\u2019t expect to meet his aunt and her new daughter-in-law, and they looked like they were buying some coffee. Yue Zhishi\u2019s footsteps paused.He needed time to think about what to call them.The wife of his paternal aunt\u2019s son is\u2026Let\u2019s try again. If his paternal aunt\u2019s son is older than him, then he was called\u00a0tang ge. The wife of his\u00a0tang ge\u00a0is\u00a0tang sao. Right.After he managed to calculate the right names for everyone, Yue Zhishi suddenly felt a random spurt of pride. He was getting ready to walk closer to ask after his new cousin\u2019s wife when the two people not too far away started talking about him.\u201cMom, out of the two who just arrived, which one is our cousin?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t recognise people from our own family?\u201dHer words were very clearly rebuking, and Yue Zhishi was momentarily stunned, no longer moving.It felt like there were many small pins piercing into his face.\u201cAh, I was about to say.\u201d The new daughter-in-law smiled awkwardly. \u201cThat brown haired boy looked like he was mixed. You can immediately tell he doesn\u2019t belong to our family. He must be the child uncle brought home?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d His aunt sipped her coffee, sat down on a chair and released a long sigh. \u201cIf you think about it, he must\u2019ve lived with them for at least ten years by now.\u201dIt would be twelve years soon. Yue Zhishi silently retorted as he subconsciously retreated backwards until he was behind the corridor corner again.She drank another sip of coffee and said, \u201cThe things he eats, where he lives, what he uses, the school he goes to \u2014 everything is exactly the same as his own son. They even take him along when they go overseas for holidays. It\u2019s not like that boy is easy to take care of either. Who knows how many times he needed to stay in a hospital when he was younger? Plus hiring all those drivers to take him to and from school \u2014 they only relaxed a bit after he grew up.\u201dShe appeared to remember something. \u201cI heard your father say that boy is just like his blood father. That Yue Yi used to daily eat and live at the Song family\u2019s house. Who would\u2019ve expected his son to also be a parasite.\u201dHer new daughter-in-law also sat down. \u201cUncle truly is strange. He doesn\u2019t care much for his own nephew, but he cares so much for someone else\u2019s child.\u201d\u201cStop bringing it up. Your husband, my son, has never received much kindness from that side of the family. He missed entering Peiya by just a few points. We looked for your uncle for help, but he wasn\u2019t willing to help us with such a simple thing.\u201d\u201cThat is a bit too stingy. I was just at the window earlier, and I saw that child carrying an especially large fruit basket before he gave it to cousin. It looks like that child doesn\u2019t think about how much money he\u2019s spending. He\u2019s more delicate compared to cousin as well. Say, seeing how uncle is so willing to take care of someone else\u2019s child, do you think\u2026 that child\u2019s relationship with him isn\u2019t so simple\u2026\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s fists clenched in anger, and he prepared to rush up there to clarify things. His father wasn\u2019t \u2018someone else\u2019, his name was Yue Yi, and Uncle Song wasn\u2019t the kind of person they were talking about.But he wasn\u2019t able to head out \u2014 someone caught his wrist.Yue Zhishi turned around for a look and saw Song Yu with an extremely ugly look on his face.Song Yu pulled Yue Zhishi behind him and walked out himself.\u201cWhat kind of relationship do you think it is?\u201dCarrying her paper cup of coffee, their cousin-in-law stood up with an awkward look on her face and looked like she didn\u2019t know what to say.Song Yu stared straight at her, his face icy enough to scare others.\u201cCousin, do you recognise me? Do you know who I am?\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re Xiao Yu, right? Just then, I was just concerned\u2026\u201dSong Yu interrupted her words without a single care.\u201cOutsiders don\u2019t need to worry about our family\u2019s matters.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone had always warmly and enthusiastically asked about how his studies were going or how his life was \u2014 he\u2019d never once heard such sharp and harsh words. They came out so fiercely, and Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t used to them at all.Yue Zhishi realised, after such a long while, everyone had only been pretending to be gentle and kind towards him. In their hearts, he was only a parasite.He\u2019d been protected too well, to the point he really did consider himself as Song Yu\u2019s real younger brother. He had completely forgotten his true reality of being sent to live under someone else\u2019s roof.\u201cWhat outsiders?\u201d Their aunt\u2019s face was flushed with colour. \u201cYour cousin was only thinking of you. You child, you\u2019re just like your father, always liking to sacrifice yourself for others, to raise someone else\u2019s child. Do you think all your money was blown over by some wind?\u201dSong Yu calmly responded, \u201cAll our money came from Uncle Yue. He gave his entire life savings to my dad in a gamble.\u201dHe looked towards his aunt, eyes sharp. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m too young and don\u2019t remember anything, but I just wanted to ask. Back when my father was just starting his business and didn\u2019t have enough cash flow, did uncle help him at all?\u201dShe immediately had nothing to say, and her expression started to look a bit ugly. She finally forced out, \u201cBack\u2026 back then we weren\u2019t too well off either.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Song Yu nodded his head as if he was an inquisitor who had just gotten the answer he\u2019d wanted.\u201cSince you never helped, then it has nothing to do with you.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d His aunt stood up in anger, her new daughter-in-law patting her back to help calm her down. Song Yu\u2019s cousin looked at Song Yu in dissatisfaction. \u201cCousin, only we are a family. Acting like this is too harmful towards family members\u2026\u201dSong Yu abruptly laughed. It looked like she didn\u2019t expect that reaction at all and couldn\u2019t finish the words she wanted to say. When Yue Zhishi looked at Song Yu, his face was even icier than before.\u201cThe word \u2018family\u2019 sounds so cheap coming out of your mouths.\u201dThis was the first time Yue Zhishi has ever seen such a harsh, scathing part of Song Yu\u2019s personality. Song Yu held his wrist and led him out of there.This was completely out of Yue Zhishi\u2019s expectations. He\u2019d thought Song Yu would walk ahead by himself like he usually did, with Yue Zhishi following behind him.Maybe it was because Song Yu guessed he couldn\u2019t move \u2014 he had no way of removing himself from such an unbearable situation.They didn\u2019t speak the entire way back to Grandpa\u2019s hospital room. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t really want to talk. The unwashed apple sat heavily in his hand, and when Song Yu entered the room, he gave his grandpa his premeditated excuse, saying the outside bathroom was also under repair with no way to get in.Grandpa was fully absorbed in his manga. He\u2019d never wanted to eat some fruit anyway, so he wasn\u2019t the slightest bit suspicious about Song Yu\u2019s words. His reading glasses perched on his nose, and he waved Yue Zhishi over to his side. \u201cQuickly come, read with me. This bit is really interesting.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded and went to sit on the side of the hospital bed. He eventually ended up lying down next to Grandpa while they read the manga together. If this was any other usual day, he would\u2019ve happily, enthusiastically introduced every single character and their abilities to Grandpa. But he wasn\u2019t able to find any interest in the manga at all, and it was like squeezing out toothpaste talking to him \u2014 only one sentence for every question asked.After ten minutes, their aunt and new cousin finally sat outside for long enough and also came into the room. The two of them acted as if nothing had happened, talking to them with their faces wreathed with smiles. \u201cXiao Yu\u2019s here too. You should eat dinner with us later tonight, there\u2019s a decent restaurant nearby.\u201d\u201cYour parents will come by later too.\u201d Their aunt looked particularly at Yue Zhishi, the corners of her mouth hoisted high and supporting her uplifted cheeks. \u201cLe Le, right, why don\u2019t you come too? What do you like to eat? How about hot pot?\u201dIt felt like there was something clogging up Yue Zhishi\u2019s throat. He gazed at their aunt, his eyelashes lightly trembling.\u201cHe won\u2019t be going,\u201d Song Yu said decisively in a slightly icy voice. \u201cHe can\u2019t eat outside things.\u201dGrandpa took care of Yue Zhishi for a little while, so he knew about his allergy. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Le Le needs to be careful about what he eats.\u201d He rubbed Yue Zhishi\u2019s head. \u201cJust wait until my arm\u2019s better. I\u2019ll make some barbecue ribs for you. Didn\u2019t you really like to eat my ribs before?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Yue Zhishi raised his head from the bed and smiled at Grandpa.There were many times Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t understand how the world of adults worked.Just like how, at this very moment, he didn\u2019t understand how the two of them could pretend nothing had happened despite having their words and faces torn to such ugly pieces by Song Yu earlier. They still continued to talk freely, faking a beautiful, friendly family relationship, as if they held no grudge at all.His chin pushed into the bed\u2019s pure white blanket, that pair of large yet beautiful eyes looking at the aunt easily chatting away before they turned to the gentle and submissive new cousin-in-law. At the end, maybe because his eyes started to burn, but he closed them for a little while. When he opened his eyes again, he just happened to meet Song Yu\u2019s gaze.Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t quite describe Song Yu\u2019s mood at that moment. He was frowning, and his expression seemed to be a bit more complicated than just being slightly upset. Yue Zhishi tilted his head and didn\u2019t change his expression at all, looking as he was acting spoiled towards Song Yu.Good thing Song Yu was here \u2014 he covered Yue Zhishi like a suit of armour.Only then could Yue Zhishi naturally, instinctively hide away.He\u2019d always wanted to be someone courageous, willing to face any difficulties head on like every single protagonist in a manga series. But sometimes, even he needed to find a place to hide.\u201cGrandpa.\u201d Song Yu stood up from the sofa. \u201cI\u2019ll take Le Le home now.\u201dHearing his nickname rather than his full name, Yue Zhishi lifted his head, eyes slightly surprised.\u201cYou\u2019re going back so early.\u201d Grandpa was a bit unhappy and lifted his head to touch the top of Yue Zhishi\u2019s head. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to play a bit longer, Le Le?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dSong Yu lied for the second time without a single change on his face. \u201cHe still has tutoring lessons.\u201d He then added, \u201cIt\u2019s almost time for high school entrance exams.\u201dGrandpa didn\u2019t force them to stay after hearing those words. He nagged a few words, saying while studies were important, they needed to take care of their bodies too. He even told them to come visit him more often if they weren\u2019t too busy.Yue Zhishi only nodded and didn\u2019t say too many things. He didn\u2019t really want to do much in front of their aunt, just in case she thought he went overboard and acted as if he really was trying to be part of their family.Naturally, she sent them off with a bunch of polite greetings. She completed her role to its fullest, walking them all the way to the elevator without a single shred of unkindness.As they left the hospital, Yue Zhishi only then realised that she actually didn\u2019t know he had been just behind the corner, that she didn\u2019t know he\u2019d heard everything she said. Song Yu blocking him from coming out was actually to save his last bits of dignity.Song Yu didn\u2019t speak as they got on the taxi. He looked very unhappy.Yue Zhishi possessed a very subtle, almost extraordinary ability to perceive Song Yu\u2019s moods that no one else had. It was normally very hard to know what Song Yu was feeling \u2014 he very rarely changed his facial expressions, and since he also didn\u2019t speak much, he was essentially like playing an emotion recognition game in hard mode. But Yue Zhishi was always able to detect Song Yu\u2019s feelings from the most delicate of changes.It was most likely from the changes in the atmosphere.It was early spring, and this city\u2019s spring season was always exceptionally lush. The reflection of Song Yu\u2019s face on the car window rested in the midst of a large swath of greenery, and he stared ahead at the car windshield, thinking of Yue Zhishi\u2019s pale face and bewildered eyes as he lay on the hospital bed.Ever since he was young, Yue Zhishi had never faced complex people or things. Sometimes he was so naive there was no way he would survive in this world, always directly and straightforwardly questioning, expressing or displaying his emotions \u2014 but his type of directness was as harmless as a soft flick of flame, the flare and heat muted and gentle.Song Yu wanted to say something.He kept feeling he should say something.Yue Zhishi shifted closer towards Song Yu, arm touching against arm, and the back of his hand accidentally brushed against Song Yu\u2019s.If this was a usual day, Song Yu would\u2019ve said why are you crowding so close against me, or maybe he would\u2019ve turned and glanced at him, or maybe he would\u2019ve done nothing at all and continued to stare outside the window.But today was different. Song Yu, who Yue Zhishi thought was very angry, lifted his hand and wrapped it around Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand that had accidentally touched his. He didn\u2019t say anything, and neither did he turn his head around.The warmth of his palm said everything he wanted to say.Suddenly, Yue Zhishi thought of Cotton Candy.He regretted attending that winter camp. He wanted to personally see how Song Yu had looked like when he\u2019d found Cotton Candy. Had it been just like this? Without a single word, he\u2019d went and held onto Cotton Candy\u2019s paw.And then Cotton Candy had followed him home.\u2013Once they returned home, Yue Zhishi worked on his homework and reviewed his lessons straight until 9:50pm, tiring himself out until he couldn\u2019t think of anything else. He hadn\u2019t eaten much when they had dinner earlier, so now he was a bit peckish and wanted to find something to eat downstairs. The house may not have everything, but there was never a short supply of food.Yue Zhishi went into the kitchen and saw Lin Rong\u2019s sticky note attached to the fridge. It said: [There are cinnamon rolls in the oven, warm them up before you eat.]He gave up on the fridge and headed to the oven. He was too lazy to heat up the rolls, so he directly opened the oven door and pulled out a wheat-free cinnamon roll.It was already warmed up. Was it gege?The icing on top of the roll smelled amazing, and Yue Zhishi stood there next to the countertop and slowly ate the roll piece by piece. Even though the kitchen was essentially a half-open kitchen style, his entire person was tucked into a corner and was completely hidden by the fridge.Yue Zhishi wanted another roll after finishing one, so he pulled out another piece. He\u2019d just taken one bite when he heard the door open. Lin Rong and Song Jin had just come home.He\u2019d just had that realisation when Lin Rong said, full of anger, \u201cLet me tell you, I\u2019ve held in my anger for a long time already. If you need to visit your brother in the future, you go ahead and go \u2014 I\u2019m not going anymore. Today\u2019s dinner pissed me off way too much.\u201dSong Jin sounded a bit helpless. \u201cDon\u2019t be so angry, your face is all flushed.\u201d\u201cFrom my makeup!\u201d Lin Rong threw her bag onto the sofa. \u201cDad already slipped and had an accident. They couldn\u2019t even take him to a nicer hospital, they just had to wait until you gave them some money before they signed the surgery papers. What were they thinking? Were they not worried after Dad fell? He\u2019s already so old, how could he be okay after a fall? They\u2019re seriously pissing me off!\u201d\u201cAnd your sister-in-law. I get so annoyed every time she speaks \u2014 it\u2019s only ever talk about money coming out of that mouth. Do we owe her a few million or something?\u201dSong Jin massaged her shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way she is. Don\u2019t hold it against her.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t just walk out. Maybe because of that morning, but he subconsciously shrunk back behind the fridge.\u201cAnd that new daughter-in-law of theirs. What kind of words was she saying during dinner\u2026\u201dAfter hearing some noise, Song Yu came downstairs as well. He saw his mother full of righteous anger and didn\u2019t ask about it. Unexpectedly, a large pot suddenly came and fell directly onto his head.\u201cSong Yu!\u201dSong Yu paused in the middle of stairs and looked at his mom after hearing her call his name.\u201cI\u2019m telling you now. If you bring home that kind of daughter-in-law, I\u2019m going to break your legs.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t have much of a reaction to his mother\u2019s rare vicious words and lifted his legs to start walking again. Lin Rong continued, \u201cGood thing they didn\u2019t say anything directly in front of Le Le, or else I really would\u2019ve started yelling at them.\u201dYue Zhishi silently thought, well, I\u2019ve pretty much heard everything already.Her voice lowered, and she started to sound a bit heartbroken. \u201cI felt so uncomfortable as I heard them talk about Le Le. What do they mean by \u2018be careful about raising an ungrateful wolf\u2019 \u2014 are those words a human will actually say? After so many years, I\u2019ve long thought of him as my own son. Just think \u2014 such a small little thing following around after me. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to grow up.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Song Jin sighed. \u201cYou cried every time he was sick.\u201d\u201cI really didn\u2019t feel comfortable today. After hearing them talk, I thought about how one day Le Le will leave me after he\u2019s all grown up. I\u2019m upset just thinking about it.\u201d She looked at Song Jin again. \u201cI was so happy when he wanted to call me mom when he was younger.\u201d She hit Song Jin a few times. \u201cBut it\u2019s all your fault, you didn\u2019t let him call me that.\u201dSong Jin grabbed her hand and laughed. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been too good for you. You already gained a little baby for free, and to even have him call you mom? Did you think about how your son or Olivia would\u2019ve felt?\u201dSong Yu walked past with the words \u2018I have no interest in this conversation\u2019 written all over his face and went to find some water. Cotton Candy appeared out of nowhere and snuggled up to his legs, bouncing up and down and looking as if he wanted Song Yu to pick him up.Lin Rong sighed. \u201cSuch a pity. Too bad Yue Yi didn\u2019t give birth to a daughter. It would\u2019ve been so nice if Le Le was a girl. He\u2019s already so obedient and pretty. Where can you find a girl as good as him nowadays? He could\u2019ve directly been our daughter-in-law, and would\u2019ve been a hundred times better than the one we had dinner with today.\u201d She then said to Song Yu without skipping a beat, \u201cRight, Xiao Yu?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s back was facing towards them, and he coolly said, \u201cAs long as you guys are happy.\u201dHe lazily walked towards the fridge, pulled open the door and grabbed out a bottle of soda water. He then closed the door. He did not expect to see Yue Zhishi hiding in the corner behind the fridge, still holding half a cinnamon roll and staring at him with his large eyes. Yue Zhishi stood there a bit awkwardly and gave him a slightly foolish smile.Song Yu hadn\u2019t even drank his water yet when he forcefully choked.The author has something to say:Le Le: What do you mean by \u2018as long as you guys are happy\u2019?Little Jade: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His pair of eyes looked pitifully at him, begging Song Yu to not expose him.Song Yu cleared his throat and recovered his usual demeanour. He wasn\u2019t planning on revealing Yue Zhishi to his parents anyway, so he prepared to walk away.But Yue Zhishi held onto his sleeve and shook his head at him. Yue Zhishi was wearing a pair of dusty blue pyjamas, hair slightly mussed, and in Song Yu\u2019s eyes, this all made him look particularly small and fragile.Song Yu stopped moving and met Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes for a few seconds. His face shifted, taking on a look of slight helplessness, and he took one step forward closer to Yue Zhishi.Yue Zhishi pointed at his stomach before showing Song Yu the cinnamon roll in his hand. Song Yu pretty much understood what happened and calmly took a sip of water.Lin Rong decided to call out, \u201cXiao Yu, there are some cinnamon rolls in the oven. Give them a try, they\u2019re really nice.\u201dSong Yu responded to her without any real inflection in his voice, his eyes staring at Yue Zhishi and the icing smeared across one of his cheeks.\u201cIt does look quite yummy.\u201dYue Zhishi quickly stuffed the remaining half of his roll into his mouth and wiped his face and hands clean.Hearing her taciturn older son suddenly give her a word of praise, Lin Rong was immensely pleased. \u201cThen you guys should give some to your classmates tomorrow. I bet Xiao Yan will love them.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Song Yu held onto his bottle. After thinking about it, he decided to help Yue Zhishi escape from this precarious situation, so he said to his parents, \u201cAren\u2019t you guys going to clean up for bed?\u201dLin Rong was lying on her husband. \u201cI\u2019m not in any rush.\u201dSong Yu then said, \u201cIt\u2019s really late.\u201d He walked out of the kitchen and pointed at the clock. \u201cYou\u2019ll distract your true born son from sleeping if you keep walking up and down the stairs.\u201d These words were a bit amusing coming out of his calm, emotionless voice.Song Jin laughed and got up to go upstairs, thinking his words were reasonable. Lin Rong was also amused and ran to Song Yu after getting off the sofa. \u201cHey, are you being jealous of Le Le?\u201dThinking she was planning on heading over to where he was, Yue Zhishi frantically squeezed himself behind the fridge, practically sitting onto the countertop directly.Song Yu, with absolutely no change in his face or voice, grabbed his mother\u2019s shoulders and pushed her outside. \u201cUpstairs. Shower.\u201dHe only walked back into the open plan kitchen after he finished rushing his parents upstairs and made sure they closed the door of their master bedroom. He saw Yue Zhishi sitting on the countertop and thought it was a bit funny.But he didn\u2019t laugh \u2014 because if he thought about it again, he would find Yue Zhishi very pitiful.He never wanted Yue Zhishi to be trapped in this kind of situation again.\u201cThank you, gege.\u201d Yue Zhishi jumped off the countertop. He begged Song Yu to go upstairs together with him as a human shield, just in case Lin Rong decided to come out of her room.Song Yu knew there was no way he would be able to actually hide Yue Zhishi behind his body, but he agreed anyway, walking with him all the way until they safely reached the entrance of Yue Zhishi\u2019s room. Before he shut the door, Yue Zhishi very softly told him goodnight. Song Yu nodded, and then he heard Yue Zhishi speak again.\u201cSong Yu gege, don\u2019t be angry. It\u2019s not good for your body.\u201dHe said those words very earnestly.Song Yu suddenly didn\u2019t know what he should say.His peaceful, quiet heart always seemed to sprout very complicated emotions because of the person in front of him. Earlier in the day, he\u2019d gone to look for Yue Zhishi because he\u2019d thought he wouldn\u2019t be able to find his way around the hospital to wash his apple and had accidentally overheard those pile of words. He\u2019d clearly known these relatives had inferior moral character, and he\u2019d clearly known he shouldn\u2019t be saying those words as the younger generation \u2014 but Song Yu had said them anyway. He didn\u2019t even feel satisfied after he finished.He started to believe everything in the world was fair. Once someone believed they treated everyone normally with icy aloofness, all their missing empathy and compassion will gather and surround one certain person.He detested feeling empathy. It was a persistent, uncontrollable feeling of suffering on behalf of someone else, and he would always feel it after seeing Yue Zhishi\u2019s face.Just like this very moment, his heart once again stirring in pain.Yue Zhishi thought everything necessary had been said and prepared to close his door. Song Yu stood just beyond, and he watched as Song Yu\u2019s silhouette was sliced by the closing door until it turned into a small and thin line, narrower and narrower. He watched until just a thread remained. Suddenly, a hand shoved its way in and held onto the doorframe.\u201cI\u2019m not angry.\u201dHe was very surprised and urgently swung open the door.He\u2019d almost hit Song Yu\u2019s hand.But emotions changed too quickly \u2014 before Yue Zhishi could ask after Song Yu\u2019s hand, his heart was already busy with something else.Song Yu stood just outside Yue Zhishi\u2019s door, caged by the darkness of the corridor. Yue Zhishi was standing inside his room, highlighted by the warm light, and Song Yu reached out and wrapped his hands around him. He gave him an unexpected embrace on the edges of their worlds.\u201cDon\u2019t be sad.\u201dFor the rest of the night, Yue Zhishi was unable to calm down. He didn\u2019t understand why either, but maybe it was because too many things happened today. He woke up once in the middle of the night, got out of bed and sat at his desk after turning on the desk lamp. He pulled out a piece of paper. It was an action plan for studying overseas, and he\u2019d spent over one week working on it. He seriously read through it again, one more time.Loopholes everywhere, and impossible to succeed. Yue Zhishi evaluated it so and decided \u2014 since it was impossible anyway, he\u2019ll give up his plan of studying overseas.Honestly speaking, he felt more upset hearing Lin Rong\u2019s words than the cold and mocking words that aunt of theirs had said. Because they were so good to him, Yue Zhishi had no way to continue being an ignorant child, easily and comfortably accepting all the good things they gave him. If he relied on just himself, there was no way he would be able to save all the money he needed to study overseas in the remaining time he had before Song Yu left.And if both Yue Zhishi and Song Yu left home, then Aunt Rong will definitely find it hard to be away from him.He crumbled his action plan into a ball and climbed back into bed to continue sleeping. This time he slept much more easily. He dreamed only once.He dreamed he was at the airport sending Song Yu off. He couldn\u2019t stop crying, and Song Yu eventually had no choice but to hug him.Song Yu said, don\u2019t be sad.Yue Zhishi woke the next morning in a daze and told himself it was only a dream.Because he wouldn\u2019t have let himself cry.\u2013After giving up his plan for studying overseas, Yue Zhishi was much more relaxed the next few weeks. But he knew, if Song Yu wanted to go, it meant they wouldn\u2019t see each other very much over the course of a year. Yue Zhishi could already predict it would be difficult for him to get used to the separation; after all, he\u2019d never been apart from Song Yu for such a long time before.Thinking about it, it felt like someone was lightly twisting Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart. So he decided to get used to it early, and the way he decided to get used to it was to try his best to not look for Song Yu.It was quite difficult when he initially started, since Yue Zhishi\u2019s world had pretty much always revolved around Song Yu. Especially after everyone learned about their relationship, he had given up all pretences and followed around Song Yu as much as he wanted. But Yue Zhishi was an earnest and serious person: once he decided on something, no one would be able to change his mind. He believed Song Yu wouldn\u2019t look for him by himself, since he was even busier than Yue Zhishi, but they had other ways of communicating \u2014 like the sticky notes on the fridge or the times they would talk to each other over midnight snacks.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t intentionally dodge away. He just wanted to learn how to grow up.His studies were actually a fantastic distraction. Yue Zhishi threw himself entirely into his studies, staying in school during the afternoon break and reviewing until very late every night. His grades reflected his efforts, and his school ranking after midterms shot up by twenty-three spots. Yue Zhishi had always been content to stay in the upper middle rankings, but he entered his year\u2019s top-ranking students with just one jump. Class adviser Wang Qian was so overjoyed by his progress that he spent over a minute praising him during their night self-study session.After exams, it was Yue Zhishi\u2019s turn to put on the armbands of a student on duty. He and the other student on duty grabbed a notebook after the night self-study session and went around their assigned areas, noting down areas that still needed to be cleaned.Yue Zhishi found it very strange. \u201cWhy does Peiya get students to go around checking for cleanliness at night? It\u2019s so dark.\u201dHis male classmate laughed. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re not just checking for cleanliness.\u201dYue Zhishi looked at him, and his classmate joked again, \u201cIsn\u2019t our nickname the \u2018anti-sex brigade\u2019?\u201dYue Zhishi wondered, would there really be couples meeting up in such dark places?These places were clearly more suited for the opening scenes of horror films. How could anyone\u2019s heart be moved?The road outside the school\u2019s poplar tree grove was very close to the cafeteria and was often a disaster zone for cleanliness. His classmate noted down the area while Yue Zhishi looked around the place, and he accidentally saw a very familiar figure. That figure seemed to have his phone torch on, a beam of bright light in the dark.He could immediately tell it was Song Yu, even though he saw only his back.Song Yu walked through the trees until he reached the old school buildings at the back. That area was surrounded by an iron fence with constant rumours of it soon being torn down. Yue Zhishi was a bit curious and unconsciously started walking towards it.Once he was a bit closer, he saw Song Yu kneel down in front of the fence and pull out a pouch from his schoolbag. His two hands couldn\u2019t hold onto it, so the light from his phone torch skewed to the side and shone onto the grass behind the fence, shining onto the animals heading towards Song Yu.They were the school\u2019s stray cats.There were many of them, and they came one after another. They looked like they were all in the habit of gathering at this place at this time, and they waited for Song Yu to pour cat food into the small container left at the corner of the fence before they went to enjoy their dinner.Yue Zhishi finally learned why Song Yu had cat food in his schoolbag to bring to school.He didn\u2019t know why, but his heart started to beat faster, going a bit tingly as if it had been licked by a kitten.\u201cWhat\u2019re you looking at?\u201d His classmate followed him over. \u201cThere\u2019s not really someone hiding here on a date, right?\u201dYue Zhishi guiltily turned around and shook his head. \u201cNo. I just got distracted.\u201dHe didn\u2019t walk over to where Song Yu was, and he also didn\u2019t want his classmate to discover Song Yu\u2019s location.More often than not, Yue Zhishi was the only person who could understand Song Yu. He knew, no matter who it was, if someone actually appeared in front of Song Yu right now and witnessed his actions, Song Yu wouldn\u2019t be too happy.He was a very strange person \u2014 he was never able to openly show his innate kindness to others.So even his tenderness was always concealed away.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d His classmate was a bit curious, seeing Yue Zhishi in a trance.Yue Zhishi only shook his head. \u201cI was just thinking I shouldn\u2019t assume things so easily.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The other guy didn\u2019t understand what he was saying, but Yue Zhishi simply glossed over his words and changed the conversation.He\u2019d assumed people\u2019s hearts wouldn\u2019t be moved in these places.But that was before he saw Song Yu in the darkness.When he got back home that night, he couldn\u2019t quite focus on his homework and drew a picture.A cold and indifferent high school student dressed in his uniform surrounded by a pack of lonely stray cats with no one to rely on.After he finished drawing, Yue Zhishi stayed in a daze for a very long time until he heard the sound of the room next door opening. He heard Song Yu go downstairs, and he abruptly startled awake, flipping over his pieces of paper, and took a few deep breaths before he started working on his homework again.The happiest person at Yue Zhishi\u2019s large grades improvement was Lin Rong. She prepared a large table\u2019s worth of dishes the night of their monthly break, the splendour and variety possibly surpassing their usual Lunar New Year family dinner. Yue Zhishi had been too tired and under too much pressure during this time frame, so he actually had a slight flu the day of his monthly break. He\u2019d napped the entire afternoon after taking some medicine. He blearily stumbled his way down the stairs and just happened to bump into the Song Yu who had just been released from school.Maybe because he was still a bit confused from his nap, but he suddenly felt a bit strange \u2014 it felt like it\u2019d been a long time since he saw Song Yu.Even though he clearly had peeped at him not too long ago.The flu medicine left a bitter taste in his mouth, and this was the first time Yue Zhishi felt little interest towards a celebratory dinner. He needed to chew a piece of beef tenderloin twenty times before he could swallow it. Song Jin and Lin Rong kept praising him over the table, and while Yue Zhishi was very happy about it, he was also slightly unhappy.But he couldn\u2019t explain why he was unhappy. He could only look at Song Yu\u2019s face every time he felt a pang of unhappiness.Song Yu slowly, meticulously ate his food. He was very quiet and wasn\u2019t too different from how he normally was; his usual habit was to finish off his meal with a bit of soup, so Yue Zhishi guessed he had finished eating and was preparing to leave when Song Yu swallowed his last mouthfuls of soup. His unhappiness grew even more obvious.But things didn\u2019t happen the way he thought they would.Song Yu placed down his bowl. He said, directing his words to the parents who were planning a holiday trip after their two children finished their high school and college entrance exams, \u201cI\u2019ve decided which university I want to apply for.\u201dSong Jin put down his chopsticks. \u201cReally? Which one?\u201d He understood Song Yu\u2019s personality and knew he had strong opinions ever since he was young, which is why he then said, \u201cThe colleges I mentioned last time were for you to reference and consider only, but I did think they were pretty good. It\u2019ll really depend on what you want to study as your major. There should still be enough time to get everything ready since the semester doesn\u2019t start until spring.\u201dSong Yu waited for his father to finish speaking before he opened his mouth. \u201cDad, I don\u2019t plan on going overseas.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t want to waste time exploring other options.\u201dYue Zhishi finished dinner in the midst of his doubt and confusion.In comparison, Song Yu\u2019s parents were a bit more relaxed. Song Jin was more satisfied knowing Song Yu already planned out his future than if Song Yu had merely chosen one of the options he\u2019d previously given him.Lin Rong had never placed too much importance on grades and their future prospects for her children\u2019s education; she knew Song Yu was a mature child and the best way to show her love for him was to give him respect.It was only Yue Zhishi who couldn\u2019t understand, so he sat on the sofa in a daze, hand caressing Orange\u2019s fur stroke after stroke. Orange was particularly obedient today and didn\u2019t run away from his arms.Of course, a bubbling happiness slowly grew within his inability to understand, because this meant the distance of their separation immediately shortened from the other side of the ocean to a range he could accept.He didn\u2019t come to his senses until Song Yu stood in front of him.\u201cCome out with me for a bit.\u201d Song Yu threw over a coat and walked by himself to the entrance of the house.It was late spring, and the warmth of its nights were always a very tricky matter. Yue Zhishi wore the coat Song Yu gave him, and it felt like his flu medicine finally started to kick in and helped him feel less uncomfortable. Their bicycles weaved through the late night, the wind softly rising and wrapping around their bodies as if they were swimming in warm water. The light of the street lamps rippled as they rode past.They passed a decently sized park centred around a lake with many people taking a walk in the darkness. Song Yu parked his bike in front of a brightly lit convenience store and went inside to buy some things, Yue Zhishi very docilely standing outside and waiting for him, just like when he was younger.Younger Yue Zhishi was very much a glutton. He hadn\u2019t been able able to move every time he entered a convenience store, busily wanting to buy everything he saw, but the majority of the food inside were things he couldn\u2019t eat. He\u2019d cry if he wasn\u2019t allowed to buy what he wanted, and this made things very difficult for everyone.Song Yu had later thought of a plan \u2014 he\u2019d ordered Yue Zhishi to stand in one particular spot in front of the convenience store\u2019s ceiling to floor windows, and he hadn\u2019t been allowed to move. Song Yu would then enter the store and buy what he needed at the quickest possible speed, and he\u2019d constantly look back to check on Yue Zhishi. If Yue Zhishi was obedient, Song Yu would then reward him with an ice cream.It was the same this time as well, but because his childhood had long gone by, Yue Zhishi was no longer the child who needed to be supervised. This kind of unwritten rule hadn\u2019t been used for a very long time, so Yue Zhishi found it a bit strange when Song Yu gave him an ice cream cone.The ice cream still carried the frigid air of the freezer, and Song Yu\u2019s fingertips were also cool to the touch.\u201cCongratulations.\u201d Song Yu led him to a nearby bench and sat down. \u201cYour reward for improving your midterm grades.\u201dEven though his tone didn\u2019t really sound all that congratulatory and the reward was just an ice cream cone, Yue Zhishi was very obviously happy. He lowered his head and ripped open the packaging, realising he\u2019d never tried this flavour before.The packaging said the cone was white peach oolong tea flavoured.\u201cYou can have only one bite.\u201d Song Yu once again started to sound a bit merciless. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat too much ice cream when you\u2019re sick.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t really pay attention to what he said. He noticed this ice cream cone was slightly different from others \u2014 it didn\u2019t have the fancy swirls of chocolate and hazelnut pieces at the top, only a layer of white, translucent jelly. His first reaction after he pulled open the packaging was disappointment, and when he took a bite, he found it a bit sour.It was a layer of peach-flavoured jelly.His brain only then processed what Song Yu said. \u201cOnly one bite?\u201d He looked at Song Yu and squeezed his eyebrows together. \u201cBut this top layer\u2019s not nice at all. I still haven\u2019t gotten to the ice cream, so it\u2019s like I didn\u2019t even get to eat it. Besides, no one\u2019s flu will get worse just because they ate an ice cream.\u201dOnly when it came to food would Yue Zhishi be particularly logical and eager to debate.Song Yu eventually relented. He leaned back on the bench and gazed at the lake not too far away.There was a hazy layer of mist floating above the lake. One couple stood underneath a street lamp, kissing, and he looked again at Yue Zhishi. He was truly absorbed into eating his ice cream cone, peeking into it every time he took a bite to see what was inside.Yue Zhishi found the layer of jelly quite ordinary, so he tentatively tried the light pink layer of ice cream.It was surprisingly very delicious.He flipped his face over to Song Yu, eyes bright. \u201cIt tastes like milk tea.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Song Yu glanced back at him, looking a bit distracted.\u201cThis ice cream cone is milk tea flavoured, like an\u00a0oolong macchiato.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice was very excited. \u201cDo you want to try?\u201d He lifted the cone and merely moved it over closer to Song Yu, unlike how he used to directly stuff the food he wanted Song Yu to try into his mouth.But after he moved it closer, Yue Zhishi remembered Song Yu didn\u2019t like to eat sweet things, so he\u00a0 paused and started to retract his hand back, curbing his desire to share his things with Song Yu.The moment Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand began to retreat, Song Yu grabbed his wrist and pulled, holding it in place so he could take a bite.Nearby, a mischievous child threw a stone into the lake. The couple joined together under the street lamp slowly pulled apart, and the moonlight shining onto the heart of the lake was startled enough to diffuse and spread into thousands of glittering fragments.Yue Zhishi took back his hand, his wrist flushed.Song Yu was silent for a few seconds, and then he gave an assessment. \u201cNot bad.\u201dThe two of them quietly sat there, Yue Zhishi continuing to eat. Eating the ice cream cone took a lot of effort as he needed to break off the cone shell and leave it to the side as he consumed the ice cream, but he was still very satisfied at the end. He said, falling back on the bench, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve recovered by fifty percent.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t make fun of his childish way of thinking. He took out a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it over. Yue Zhishi was a bit stunned when he took the slightly wrinkled paper \u2014 he carefully looked over it under the light, and realised it was the action plan he previously created for studying overseas.\u201cHow did you get this?\u201d In his agitation, Yue Zhishi almost stuffed the paper into his mouth. He wanted to crumple the paper into a ball again and swallow it to destroy the evidence just like a television drama.\u201cI\u2019ve pretty much memorised it all.\u201d Song Yu straightforwardly smashed his fantasy into pieces. \u201cI went to your room to look for the book you took from me. You weren\u2019t there, and the desk was all messy, so I accidentally saw this balled up piece of paper as I was searching.\u201d\u201cAccidentally?\u201d Yue Zhishi frankly questioned Song Yu\u2019s wording.\u201cYes.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s face didn\u2019t flicker at all, and he even gave him a suggestion. \u201cBesides, if you happen to have a secret you don\u2019t want others to discover, you should destroy it immediately.\u201dHe successfully convinced Yue Zhishi.That\u2019s true. He indeed should\u2019ve torn this abandoned action plan of his into pieces straight away.\u201cWhy did you give up?\u201d\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you going overseas?\u201dThe two of them spoke at the same time, voices overlapping.Song Yu no longer spoke. Both of them waited for a moment, and then Yue Zhishi opened his mouth first. \u201cI initially\u2026\u201dHe thought for a little bit and then very candidly said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to separate from you if you were going to leave the country. That\u2019s why I wanted to go too.\u201dHearing these words, Song Yu\u2019s hand clenched on the edge of the bench. A bird flew past the lake, and its wings skimmed across the surface of the water, leaving behind traces of its journey.Yue Zhishi dropped his eyes and continued, \u201cBut I don\u2019t have any money. The allowance I normally get isn\u2019t even enough to pay for the English test\u2019s registration fee. That\u2019s why I made a plan to study and work part time.\u201d\u201cBut I later realised I might not be able to save that much money, and I didn\u2019t want to use uncle or aunt\u2019s money. Besides\u2026\u201d He thought about what happened that day at the hospital, paused and changed the excuse he was about to say. \u201cAunt Rong might not want to me go either. If I left, she\u2019d be the only one left at home and would definitely be very sad.\u201dThe dates on the action plan started on the night Song Yu spoke with his father. The daily schedule included one action to implement every day, and all of them had a little tick mark next to them. The last tick stopped on the day they went to the hospital.It was also the night Song Yu witnessed Yue Zhishi hiding behind the corner of the fridge and the countertop, mutely eating his cinnamon roll.\u201cSo you decided to give up going overseas and focus on your studies for the high school entrance exam?\u201dYue Zhishi discovered Song Yu sounded a bit strange, almost as if he was asking a rhetorical question. But his question was a bit more difficult than a normal rhetorical question \u2014 he sounded almost as if he was slightly angry.\u201cYou\u2019re not happy about it?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked.Song Yu pressed his lips together. Yue Zhishi\u2019s large and pure pair of eyes was staring at him. \u201cWhat is there for me to be unhappy about?\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Maybe Yue Zhishi thought wrongly. But he temporarily didn\u2019t want to give a proper answer to Song Yu\u2019s question because he didn\u2019t want to tell him he was afraid of being away from Song Yu and was trying to get used to that separation ahead of time \u2014 it felt like he would sound a bit stupid if he said it out loud.So he nodded. \u201cI originally needed to work hard at my studies anyway. I\u2019m number three in my year now.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t continue asking.Yue Zhishi repeated his earlier question. \u201cSong Yu gege, how come you\u2019re not going overseas anymore?\u201d He thought of how Song Yu had picked up his thrown away action plan and lifted it into the air. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be related to this, right?\u201dAfter saying he didn\u2019t want to separate from Song Yu, it felt a bit like he wanted to keep him here with him. So he then said, \u201cI know I said I wanted to go overseas with you, but it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll stop you from going just because I can\u2019t go.\u201dHis words came out with a touch too much self-confidence, but Yue Zhishi had always been a child like this: the care and love he\u2019d received since childhood made him into someone who could openly and honestly express his feelings.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t entirely because you gave up,\u201d Song Yu replied, avoiding the actual question.Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t actually all that disappointed. If Song Yu had said he\u2019d given up because of him, then Yue Zhishi would\u2019ve thought something was wrong with him.\u201cI actually didn\u2019t know if I wanted to go overseas or not. It was just an option I was given.\u201d Song Yu looked ahead at the lake. \u201cI previously didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do in the future. I took a very long time to think about it recently, and I only just now decided.\u201dHe pulled out a neatly folded piece of paper and also handed it to Yue Zhishi.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dSong Yu glanced at him. \u201cDo you remember what I told you last time about the gift your dad gave me? You said he\u2019d never given you one.\u201d\u201cIs this the map he drew himself?\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes glowed.Song Yu sounded a bit helpless. \u201cI drew this. It\u2019s a topographic map of the first place we visited together on a tour, Jiuzhai Valley.\u201dYue Zhishi drew the map slightly closer. \u201cThis is so amazing. I still remember the photo we took together, everything was so beautiful there.\u201dSong Yu hummed in response and continued, \u201cI\u2019m going to stay and take the college entrance exams so I can enter the major I want to study.\u201d He lifted his head to look at the sky and unexpectedly saw a few spectacularly twinkling stars.Yue Zhishi very much enjoyed how he felt right now. The words Song Yu didn\u2019t finish saying at the dinner table \u2014 to have Song Yu willingly say them to him, Yue Zhishi felt particularly satisfied.\u201cSong Yu gege, can you give me this map?\u201dSong Yu gazed at the lake. \u201cWhy do you want it for? It\u2019s not like your dad drew it.\u201dHe was just joking and didn\u2019t expect Yue Zhishi to grab his arm and say, very earnestly and directly, \u201cBut I want the one you drew.\u201dActually, Yue Zhishi was nervous at asking. He did think there was a large possibility Song Yu wouldn\u2019t actually give the map to him since it was the first time he\u2019d ever drawn a topographic map \u2014 and since it was a map of the first place he\u2019d ever gone to on a holiday, it held even more sentimental value.He didn\u2019t expect Song Yu to look at him and very casually say, sure.\u201cReally?\u201d Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t control his excitement and scooted closer until they were almost touching. \u201cAre there any conditions?\u201dHow could there be someone rushing to ask for conditions.\u201cYou just reminded me.\u201d The corner of Song Yu\u2019s mouth hooked up in light amusement. \u201cYou can give me your drawing in exchange.\u201dWhat good luck is this \u2014 Yue Zhishi agreed without any hesitation. \u201cNo problem, you can choose anything you want! I\u2026\u201dWait a second.Seeing him abruptly stop speaking, Song Yu deliberately asked him if there was anything wrong.Yue Zhishi blinked. \u201cWhich drawing are you talking about?\u201d Since he\u2019d already seen the action plan, did that mean the drawing on the desk\u2026Song Yu was calmer than ever. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the drawing you\u2019re also thinking about.\u201dNo way. Yue Zhishi shot up in a panic, his body posture making him Song Yu think he was going to jump in the lake.The light from the convenience store shone onto his body and caught on his red ears.He\u2019d secretly watched on as Song Yu fed the stray cats and had even drawn a picture about it \u2014 didn\u2019t that make him one of those perverts in television dramas?Song Yu wanted to tease him again, so he raised his head and asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to give it away that much?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Yue Zhishi rushed to explain. \u201cI only saw you by accident.\u201d And then accidentally drawn a picture. This reasoning would be too laughable if he said it out loud and didn\u2019t even answer Song Yu\u2019s question, so he didn\u2019t say it. He also didn\u2019t know why his whole head felt warm and said, inserting his foot into his mouth, \u201cThis isn\u2019t even the first time I drew you. I used to have a bunch of small comic figures of you, but you never wanted them.\u201d\u201cWhen did I not want them?\u201d Song Yu said, looking at him. \u201cCompared to you, always sneaking about.\u201dYue Zhishi retorted, \u201cI saw you outside right in the open.\u201d He then added, \u201cNot only did I see you, I\u2019m going to go back and tell Orange you have cats other than him. A large group of them.\u201dSong Yu froze for a second, and then broke into laughter, the likes of which Yue Zhishi had not seen for a very long time.Seeing him like that, it felt like the tension Yue Zhishi had been holding in the last few days finally disappeared. Except he faintly felt he hadn\u2019t been like himself lately with all his worries of what he might gain and what he might lose \u2014 they circled around and around, randomly making him either upset or happy for no reason at all. He was able to carelessly and honestly say he didn\u2019t want to be away from Song Yu, but he had no way to naturally explain the drawing he\u2019d created in the middle of the night.Yue Zhishi was a bit embarrassed since Song Yu was still laughing. He told him to stop laughing and even grabbed his arm, wanting to pull him up.But Song Yu clasped his arm in return, the laughter on his face greatly disappearing as he calmed down.\u201cGive it to me. I really like it,\u201d he seriously said.The author has something to say:Le Le: I think I\u2019ve grown up (1\u3001\u3001) Everyone, please give me more water~Cornetto, I really like your peach oolong ice cream cone, but please release a version without the peach jelly.

He slightly regretted giving it away and wanted to take it back, but it was obvious how asking for it back would go.Song Yu would never give him a chance to fix up his work.But Song Yu\u2019s map was honestly well-drawn \u2014 it was beautiful in a very clean, scientific way, and Yue Zhishi actually wanted to frame and hang it at the head of his bed.After such a long period of stress, he finally fell into a deep sleep. In his dream, he was feeding little kittens with Song Yu when he heard a familiar cat noise behind his back. Yue Zhishi turned around, and an indignant Orange was standing behind him, catching him red-handed.Meow\u2014\u2014What a nightmare.It wasn\u2019t easy surviving until the monthly break, and yet they were given only one day to rest. Yue Zhishi was woken up bright and early by Orange stepping on him, and Lin Rong just happened to be calling him down for breakfast. He blearily carried Orange downstairs with him and saw Song Yu changing his shoes at the front door. Yue Zhishi\u2019s mind cleared up immediately and went over in his house slippers. \u201cGege, you\u2019re leaving the house so early?\u201dSong Yu nodded as he tied his shoelaces. \u201cYes, I have something to do.\u201d\u201cCan I go with you?\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t really answer him, only saying, \u201cYou should stay at home and do your reviews.\u201dYue Zhishi understood Song Yu\u2019s way of speaking too well. If he didn\u2019t say he couldn\u2019t go, then that meant he could, as long as he tried hard enough. \u201cI want to go, can you bring me too? My productiveness will be much higher after we come back, truly.\u201dYue Zhishi sounded a bit pitiful. Song Yu raised his head and met his eyes for a while. Yue Zhishi sorrowfully opened his mouth again and said, \u201cGege, please. I already gave my drawing to you.\u201dSong Yu gave up.\u201cI\u2019ll give you ten minutes to change your clothes.\u201d\u201cNo problem!\u201dAs he waited, Song Yu sat at the front door and played on his phone. He saw Xia Zhixu\u2019s WeChat message and replied while he was there.It was early morning, the temperature just right and the air fresh. Yue Zhishi was in an extremely good mood at not having to go to school and being able to go out together with Song Yu. He sat on the bench as they waited for the bus, and Song Yu pulled out a pink lollipop from his pocket and gave it to him.\u201cYou put this in my bag, right? It\u2019s too sweet. Eat it yourself.\u201dIt\u2019d been so long since he\u2019d snuck the candy into his bag, and yet Song Yu still hadn\u2019t eaten it yet.But it made sense since Song Yu hated sweets.Yue Zhishi took the lollipop and tore open the wrapper without really thinking about it. He\u2019d just placed the lollipop into his mouth when the bus arrived, so he immediately stood up and got onto the bus with Song Yu. The bus drove extremely quickly, and Yue Zhishi fell asleep also extremely quickly, swaying and wobbling about until he ended up on Song Yu\u2019s shoulder. He stayed there until he was woken up to get off the car.Standing at the bus stop, Yue Zhishi reached up his arms and lazily stretched. The bus drove away, and a tall, beautiful girl across the street waved at them. Yue Zhishi slowly pulled down his arms, glancing at the Song Yu standing next to him, and saw him nod in her direction.What is this?It was hard enough to have a break. They left the house early in the morning only just to come and meet a pretty older sister. Yue Zhishi felt like something wasn\u2019t quite right \u2014 this really didn\u2019t fit Song Yu\u2019s usual behaviour.The pedestrian lights turned green, and Song Yu walked across the street. Yue Zhishi abruptly felt grumpy and stuffed his hands into his pockets, the lollipop still in his mouth as he followed behind.Gege had never interacted with a girl in private before.The girl appeared very friendly and looked to be a bit older than the two of them. She warmly greeted Song Yu, \u201cHave you had breakfast yet? What a coincidence, I only just arrived when I saw you too.\u201d She glanced at Yue Zhishi after she finished speaking and looked back at Song Yu. \u201cThis must be your younger brother.\u201dSong Yu nodded. Seeing he was mentioned, Yue Zhishi politely greet her as well and introduced himself.\u201cHello hello, I\u2019m Feng Yue.\u201d She checked her watch. \u201cThe car should be here soon.\u201dAre they going somewhere? Yue Zhishi specifically looked over her outfit. She was wearing very comfortable casual clothing, long sleeves, long pants and flat sneakers.Could they be going to somewhere like Happy Valley? Or maybe going on an outdoors trip somewhere?He thought about how Song Yu had initially not wanted to bring him along.Feng Yue\u2019s phone suddenly rang, and she apologised before stepping away. \u201cYes, right now we\u2019re at\u2026\u201dSince she was far away, Yue Zhishi touched Song Yu\u2019s arm and stood very closely to him. He waited until Song Yu leaned his head over, and abruptly asked, \u201cAre you going on a date with her?\u201dOnly Yue Zhishi would ask something like that so directly.But the moment the words left his mouth, even Yue Zhishi felt it was a bit strange to ask. His mood didn\u2019t improve at all.Song Yu lifted an eyebrow. \u201cWhy would I take you with me to a date?\u201dThat one sentence knocked Yue Zhishi awake.That\u2019s right.Since Song Yu didn\u2019t refuse to let him come along, he shouldn\u2019t be going on a date with a girl. Besides, who would bring such a big lightbulb onto a date, especially one who could easily go home and tattle on him to their parents?If Song Yu really was going on a date, Yue Zhishi might actually tell on him. He truly was slightly unhappy.He was just about to ask Song Yu what was the real purpose behind this trip, but Feng Yue happened to finish her phone call and return back to where they were. The car she mentioned earlier arrived in the next thirty seconds. It was a very large white car with a lot of empty space inside.They got on the car together, and there were already two other young men sitting inside. The road was very smooth, and Yue Zhishi was very curious about where they were going \u2014 unexpectedly, the road became more familiar the longer they drove, until the car finally stopped at Peiya\u2019s side entrance.Why\u2019d they come to school?There were a bit too many people around, so Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t really speak. Song Yu exited the car and walked by himself to the security guard, providing him with his student identification and approval letter from the school before the security guard let them through.After he returned, the car went straight into the school, driving on the road through the side entrance until it reached the cafeteria. It continued past until it stopped nearby the old school buildings near the back of the cafeteria.\u201cTime to start working.\u201d The young man wearing a cap got off the car first and rolled up his sleeves.Yue Zhishi was a bit stunned. He thought about a video he\u2019d once seen online, where people caught and killed stray animals. He grabbed Song Yu\u2019s arm without thinking. \u201cWhat are they doing? Are they going to kill all those cats?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Song Yu lightly patted the back of his hand. He then said to the other people, \u201cI\u2019ve already had the cats neutered.\u201dFeng Yue, pulling on some gloves, was surprised. \u201cDid you pay for it yourself? It couldn\u2019t have been cheap. You must\u2019ve also spent a lot of time as well, since there\u2019s no way you could\u2019ve neutered all of them at the same time.\u201dOne of the men also said, \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s enough if you\u2019ve already neutered them all.\u201dSong Yu shook his head and pulled out a key he\u2019d borrowed from the school\u2019s management to open the iron fence. \u201cI\u2019m graduating soon.\u201dYue Zhishi understood the words he\u2019d left unspoken.\u201cI see. That\u2019s fine then, just leave it to us. You don\u2019t have to worry anymore.\u201d Feng Yue nodded and started to work with everyone else. \u201cHopefully today will go smoothly.\u201d\u201cAre you trapping them?\u201d Yue Zhishi started to follow them. \u201cLet me help you.\u201dSong Yu seized his wrist. \u201cDon\u2019t follow us.\u201dObviously, Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t listen to him. \u201cI\u2019m really good with animals.\u201d He then said a bunch of other reasons, and since Song Yu didn\u2019t want to outright reject Yue Zhishi in front of so many outsiders \u2014 it would\u2019ve depressed him \u2014 he reluctantly allowed him to come along. He found a pair of gloves for Yue Zhishi and told him to put it on well.Catching cats required a lot of effort and time. Luckily Song Yu was there, as the cats were familiar with him and were a bit easier to catch than usual.But they never expected Yue Zhishi\u2019s words to actually be so accurate \u2014 animals were naturally attracted to him. It wasn\u2019t clear if it was because they were curious, but some cats subconsciously walked closer to him. The other workers could then very quickly pick them up from behind.Yue Zhishi was like living catnip, a fantastic way to lure in the cats.But as soon as he wanted to reach down and either touch or catch a cat, Song Yu would stop him.After working for almost two hours, they finally managed to transfer all the stray cats in the area into cages, placing them one by one into the car. Some of the worried cats kept meowing, and they didn\u2019t calm down until Song Yu fed them their usual food.One kitten was particularly small and stayed in a large cage with his mother. Yue Zhishi kneeled down to look at him, and the kitten weakly gazed back.\u201cI counted eight in total, just like you described.\u201d Feng Yue gave Song Yu a document. \u201cOnce you sign here, we\u2019ll take them back and clean them up.\u201dYue Zhishi listened to them speak, and only then learned that Feng Yue worked in the local area\u2019s largest stray animal rescue shelter and specialised in bringing back stray animals to prepare them for adoption. Song Yu had requested them to make this particular trip.\u201cGood thing you were here. I think this might\u2019ve been the easiest trap job in history \u2014 we used to be scratched all over our bodies in previous jobs until we mentally collapsed.\u201d Feng Yue looked over at the cats in the cages and smiled towards Song Yu. \u201cThey listen to you quite well. Looks like you\u2019ve spent a lot of time with them.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Song Yu glanced at the cats and, after a silent moment, brought out a little notebook the size of his palm. \u201cThis notebook has all of their personalities and habits. Maybe it\u2019ll help you guys in the future.\u201dThe rescue shelter\u2019s workers once again expressed their gratitude and even wanted to give him a rescue certificate, but Song Yu kept denying he\u2019d done anything to help. He even declined their offer to drop them back home on their way back, and he stood at Peiya\u2019s side entrance with Yue Zhishi and sent off their car.As he watched those cats disappear into the distance, Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but observe the side of Song Yu\u2019s face.Sure enough, he was someone who was unable to show his emotions.He may\u2019ve kept saying he did nothing at all, but it was likely he\u2019d started taking care of the cats from his first year of high school.\u201cWouldn\u2019t you miss them?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked.Song Yu lowered his head and booked a car on his phone. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to miss. This is the best choice.\u201dThe car he\u2019d booked stopped right in front of them, and the two of them got on, Yue Zhishi vividly describing to Song Yu the dream he\u2019d had last night of them feeding cats together. He didn\u2019t mention the end though, where they\u2019d been caught by Orange, and then complained, \u201cI didn\u2019t get to feed them even once. I didn\u2019t expect last night\u2019s dream would be a sign of what would happen.\u201d\u201cSimply feeding stray cats is actually nothing more than unchecked kindness.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s words were a bit harsh, and yet they were very realistic. \u201cIf you only feed them and leave them alone to continue roaming around, you might end up damaging the surrounding ecology. To these cats, from the day they\u2019re born until the day they die, how many times can you actually feed them?\u201dHe looked out the window after he finished speaking. \u201cIt would be better if they were given a chance to have a home.\u201dYue Zhishi thought about what Song Yu had once said \u2014 people must be responsible for their own actions, even if those actions had come from kindness.He started to understand why Song Yu would do these things silently, without notifying anyone else. Once other people learned about the cats, the news might spread \u2014 and since Song Yu had a lot of people chasing after him to begin with, the situation would then be even harder to control.Yue Zhishi knew he often didn\u2019t consider things carefully or deeply enough, but more than anyone else, he hoped Song Yu\u2019s wish would come true.\u201cThose little kittens could definitely be adopted by some good people,\u201d he said, smiling. He then very naively, very heartlessly added, \u201cJust like me. I can give to them all of my experience and good luck.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t like hearing him say those kinds of words, and even felt a bit unhappy.He flicked a dissatisfied look at Yue Zhishi before he frowned and looked ahead again. He said, a bit coolly, \u201cYour experience is useless as a reference, and you don\u2019t really have any luck at all.\u201d\u201cWho decided that?\u201d Yue Zhishi was very discontented. He thought he\u2019d been very lucky.Song Yu continued, \u201cJust because they\u2019re at the shelter doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll definitely be adopted. And even if they\u2019re chosen, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be adopted by a responsible family. This could always be an endless, random wait, truly dependent on luck.\u201dHis words initially sounded very hurtful, but Song Yu\u2019s tone changed. \u201cYou\u2019re not like them.\u201d Then, with a very calm expression on his face, he said something highly absurd. \u201cYou suddenly fell from the sky.\u201dYue Zhishi frowned. \u201cAm I a\u00a0pie?\u201dSong Yu turned his face over and met his eyes. Yue Zhishi saw a glowing spot of light in his dark pupils, as well as his own face.\u201cEven apples could fall and hit someone.\u201dSong Yu used a cryptic, old metaphor, and even attempted to use a well-known scientist\u2019s story to hide his own ulterior feelings.\u201cOh,\u201d Yue Zhishi merely said, his mind only thinking about Newton\u2019s large curly wig in his portrait. He didn\u2019t consider Song Yu\u2019s words further.But no matter what Song Yu said, Yue Zhishi secretly decided to transfer his own good luck over those stray cats, hoping each of them would have a safe and peaceful future.Once they arrived home, Lin Rong asked them where they\u2019d gone. Song Yu said the bookstore, and Yue Zhishi naturally acted along. Except when he\u2019d left the house, he\u2019d worn black clothing, and now they were very obviously covered by cat hair.\u201cI\u2019m really warm, I\u2019m going to shower,\u201d Yue Zhishi said and ran upstairs.Lin Rong pulled out the stuff she\u2019d bought for her son, showing off the completely full climbing backpack she\u2019d prepared for him. It was stuffed until bursting, and someone might\u2019ve thought she was participating in a competition to see who could store more items into one bag.\u201cLook, all of these things are all very useful. Ah yes, and this pack of medicine. You have to bring this too.\u201d\u201cSo much stuff. Am I leaving to establish new territory?\u201d\u201cXiao Yu! How can you make fun of the great maternal love?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYue Zhishi went back to his room. He felt inside his pockets when he changed out of his clothes, and pulled out a wrinkled lollipop wrapper. It was from the lollipop Song Yu gave him earlier that morning.Before he threw it away, Yue Zhishi casually flipped over for a look and frowned, accidentally discovering something.\u201cStrawberry milk?\u201dWeird.The one he\u2019d bought was clearly raspberry flavoured.The author has something to say:\u2018You\u2019re the apple of my eye.\u2019This sentence can be traced back to the Old English period. It really is old, Shakespeare used it often. But it feels romantic in a very classical sense (at least I think so hhh)I\u2019m not alluding to Adam and Eve hhh (and besides, the Bible actually never said what the forbidden fruit was, later generations mistakenly turned it into apples)I think everyone is reading too closely into the quote as love talk. It actually isn\u2019t, Song Yu just didn\u2019t want Le Le to see himself as a stray cat adopted by someone. He\u2019s very very precious to the entire family, so that\u2019s why he said it (of course, if you want to read it as spoken out of romantic love, you can! Since it\u2019ll be hard if this pair doesn\u2019t end up married in the future!)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because Song Yu was in the building across from him, Yue Zhishi would study in the fifth floor\u2019s self study room every night, waiting for Song Yu to finish his night study session before they left for home together.\u201cYou\u2019re going to Beijing for training?\u201d His bike twisted as it traveled along, and Yue Zhishi immediately steadied it with his hands. \u201cWhen?\u201d\u201cThe day after tomorrow.\u201d\u201cSo soon?! You\u2019re going in two days?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 how long does the Mathematical Olympiad training camp go for?\u201d Yue Zhishi tried to cover up his dropping mood as much as possible.\u201cOne month.\u201d Song Yu finished speaking and opened his mouth again. Yue Zhishi thought he wanted to say something, but there was nothing else even after they arrived home.The morning all the students going to the camp gathered together in front of the school for the large bus to Beijing, Yue Zhishi was in English class and wasn\u2019t able to send Song Yu off. After the class ended, he lay against the window frame and looked out for a very long time, the school entrance completely empty with nothing to see.The Mathematics Olympiad team chose very few people to take in \u2014 Peiya only had two students, and one of them was Song Yu.Jiang Yufan headed over to him, knocking his shoulder. \u201cHey, I heard your brother was chosen for the Mathematics Olympiad training team. They all say you\u2019re pretty much guaranteed to get into Tsinghua University if you get chosen. Is that true?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d Yue Zhishi wearily replied, remaining on the window frame.One month isn\u2019t too long.He silently tried to convince himself.The coach bus was provided by the Bureau of Education, and it started its trip from Peiya, stopping on its way at Jingjian High School where two more people got on the bus. Song Yu was leaning against a window, earphones on and eyes closed in rest, when someone suddenly patted his shoulder. He opened his eyes.\u201cYo!\u201dThe smile and tiger teeth were super dazzling.Song Yu took off one of his earphones and lifted his head to meet Xia Zhixu\u2019s eyes, crooking the corner of his mouth without saying anything. Xia Zhixu placed his luggage to one side and sat in the empty seat next to him, flinging open his arms and shaking his legs. \u201cI\u2019m so tired. I should\u2019ve eaten more earlier.\u201d\u201cWho told you to bring so much stuff.\u201d\u201cWho else but my mom.\u201dSure enough, all mothers in the world were the same.\u201cI hear the camp\u2019s super strict with its rules. Bet we\u2019ll be bored as hell.\u201d Xia Zhixu looked over at Song Yu and sighed. \u201cGood thing you\u2019re here, at least I won\u2019t be too lonely this month.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s fingers toyed with a wireless earphone. \u201cIt\u2019s useless even with me here.\u201dXia Zhixu felt guilty at the implication in his words. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Song Yu lifted an eyebrow.\u201cWhat are you oh-ing about? You\u2019re such a strange guy.\u201dThe life of a Mathematics Olympiad trainee was much more difficult compared to high school year three. The quantity of questions and sheer intensity of the training were several times higher than their usual lives. Students improved much faster under high intensity and high pressure, but the consumption of energy was also much higher.Yue Zhishi always sent messages to Song Yu every night at 10pm. The nature of his messages were very different compared to other people\u2019s, however \u2014 for example, Song Yu\u2019s mom would consistently send questioning messages such as\u00a0what did you eat tonight?\u00a0or\u00a0did you sleep well?\u00a0tired?\u00a0and then wait for Song Yu to reply.But Yue Zhishi differed in that his messages were always about himself and never required a response. Sometimes he would send a photo of a fish-shaped cloud he\u2019d seen on his way to school, or a photo of a highly scored test with a halo effect drawn around the score, or even a photo of some random brand\u2019s new soda flavour he\u2019d just tried.Song Yu didn\u2019t reply for the first three days. The training team\u2019s adviser was very strict when they\u2019d first arrived, forbidding them to carry their phones with them. The phones could only be left in their dormitory rooms. Song Yu would see the messages only after a very long time had passed, and even though he wanted to reply, he suddenly felt embarrassed about being so late.But on the fourth day, he responded.That night, he was tired enough to collapse, having just returned to the dorm at 11:30pm. He lay on his side in bed and opened his phone \u2014 he hadn\u2019t yet received Yue Zhishi\u2019s daily updates when he accidentally fell asleep holding his phone. His phone vibrated and woke him up after an unknown amount of time, and he peeled open his eyes, frowning.[Yue Zhishi:\u00a0sent a photo]His sight was still blurry from sleep, and the little photo icon was blindingly white. He sleepily pressed on the photo to open it, only to discover it was Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm with a very small rash.Song Yu was immediately awake.[Xiao Yu gege: What happened to you?]Yue Zhishi pretty much responded right away with a voice message. \u201cJiang Yufan bought the new\u00a0oden\u00a0from the school\u2019s supermarket today. I only ate a few fishballs, but those cheap manufacturers actually mixed in a lot of wheat flour.\u201d He sounded slightly indignant.Yue Zhishi very quickly sent over a second voice message, his voice very weak. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose, the fishballs were so white and looked really yummy. I thought they would be like the fishballs we have at home and be made out of only fish paste.\u201dXia Zhixu returned back to their room after finishing his phone call and was very surprised to see Song Yu sitting up and furiously tapping away on his phone in bed, completely unlike his usual behaviour.This guy usually conserved his energy as much as he could \u2014 he only knew how to work and sleep, just like a robot.But there would be times Song Yu would be quite strange. He usually ate his meals in the training camp\u2019s cafeteria with his head lowered without saying a single thing, but he unexpectedly raised his head and watched a few minutes of the One Piece episode playing on the cafeteria\u2019s big screen yesterday.It was very interesting \u2014 seems like a hot blooded shounen anime fan rested inside the ice mountain\u2019s inner heart.Song Yu didn\u2019t notice his temporary roommate had come back as he quickly typed his reply and sent it out.[Xiao Yu gege: I\u2019ve said this so many times \u2014 you need to avoid eating outside things as much as you can, it\u2019s so hard to avoid such a common allergen like wheat. You\u2019re already this old, and you still don\u2019t understand this?][Yue Zhishi: I do]He sent over a sticker of a\u00a0little puppy crying.Xia Zhixu carelessly rubbed his hair a few times and went to sit on his own bed across from Song Yu. He ridiculed, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still chatting. It\u2019s amazing, I thought you\u2019d secluded yourself in cultivation. I didn\u2019t think you had a friend who could get you to sit up and chat.\u201dHe particularly emphasised the words \u2018sit up\u2019.Song Yu\u2019s eyes left his phone screen and without even looking at Xia Zhixu, he said, unwilling to be outdone, \u201cI can\u2019t compare to you. One phone call takes one whole hour, and you even report everything you ate for dinner every day. What, you dating?\u201dXia Zhixu had just taken a sip out of his cup of water and almost spat it back out.This guy\u2019s really aggressive\u2026\u201cWho, who\u2019s dating! How can I be dating?\u201d\u201cWhat are you so guilty about.\u201dHis phone vibrated once again, so Song Yu lowered his head and unlocked it.[Yue Zhishi: Song Yu gege, I miss you]\u201cYou\u2019re the guilty one. I can tell these things.\u201d Xia Zhixu turned off his beside lamp and lay down. \u201cGonna sleep.\u201dBut just as he said this, he noticed Song Yu staring at his phone screen in a daze in the darkness, a subtle change on his face.Xia Zhixu actually started to doubt if his eyes were working correctly.He wrapped himself in his blanket and stared at Song Yu. \u201cHey, what are you smiling about? How creepy.\u201dCompared to getting a reply, the screen turned off by itself faster, and the last remaining source of light in the room vanished in a flash.\u201cNo such thing,\u201d Song Yu denied.\u201cNo way, I just saw your eyes smile \u2014 what a miracle!\u201d\u201cYou talk too much.\u201d\u201cI speak a normal amount. Ah, I know, you were just projecting, you\u2019re the one actually dating, right?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Song Yu very decisively said.Xia Zhixu felt something wasn\u2019t quite right, but he also felt continuing to question him would drag himself into the conversation. He rolled over and blinked at the dark ceiling. \u201cThat\u2019s fine then, neither am I.\u201dIn the midst of the darkness, he once again heard Song Yu\u2019s voice.\u201cXia Zhixu.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cHas no one told you sometimes you\u2019re too stupid to be a top student?\u201dXia Zhixu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFrom that day on, Yue Zhishi would receive Song Yu\u2019s replies every day, so he would stay up and wait no matter how late it was. He didn\u2019t even turn on his phone\u2019s do not disturb mode when he went to sleep, in fear of missing even one message.Yue Zhishi used to be afraid of being startled awake by his phone while he slept, but now, as long as it vibrated even once, no matter how sleepily confused he was, he would immediately wake up and check his phone.It was just that sometimes it would be an empty-handed search, resulting in annoying harassment messages from insurance or stock companies.Seeing Yue Zhishi send over a photo of Orange and Cotton Candy fighting, Song Yu would reply with a question mark. Seeing a photo of a late night snack, Song Yu would respond with a period rejecting the social media sharing of food late at night. Sometimes Yue Zhishi would forward a question he didn\u2019t understand, and a few minutes later, he would receive a photo with written explanations on how to solve the problem.Yue Zhishi felt like Song Yu was actually a tree hole robot with slightly more intelligence. He sent over daily snapshots of his life and would receive a simple reply or evaluation, and when he encountered any problems, he would be able to harvest answers.It was actually very good like this \u2014 maybe he himself was also a lonely little robot, needing to complete his daily mission of interacting with Song Yu before he could be rewarded with bits of emotion.And then afterwards, their programs would continue to smoothly operate, no software bugs to ruin the flow of their lives.\u201cAren\u2019t you too clingy with your brother?\u201d There were a lot of people in the cafeteria, and Jiang Yufan sat next to Yue Zhishi, watching as he typed in a new message. \u201cThey should be almost finished by now, right?\u201dYue Zhishi had just typed in the words [let me tell you] when he suddenly froze, hearing Jiang Yufan\u2019s words. He turned his head over and asked, \u201cReally?\u201dJiang Yufan didn\u2019t understand what he was asking. \u201cYeah, aren\u2019t there only ten more days? I\u2019ve even counted the days for you.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Yue Zhishi asked again, \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m too clingy?\u201d\u201cOh, that. Maybe just a little bit?\u201d Jiang Yufan ate a mouthful of stir-fried noodles and didn\u2019t really think about what he said. He was very quickly distracted. \u201cThey call this stir-fried noodles with shredded meat, but where\u2019s the meat? Cafeteria\u2019s such a trap.\u201dYue Zhishi was in no mood to care about the quality of the cafeteria\u2019s dishes \u2014 he had a new understanding of how clingy he was as a person, and even started to panic because of it. He\u2019d initially wanted to delete the message he was originally writing, but he accidentally pressed the send button.[Yue Zhishi: Let me tell you]As soon as he saw the message was sent, he tried to hurriedly recall it back. He didn\u2019t expect a new message to immediately pop up.[Xiao Yu gege: Mm]So fast\u2026 Yue Zhishi thought for a long while, partially trying to remember what he\u2019d initially wanted to say and partially feeling his constant messages to Song Yu truly might be pestering him. Song Yu said before he didn\u2019t have much time to sleep.So Yue Zhishi finally replied with\u00a0never mind.After a few seconds, his phone vibrated.[Xiao Yu gege: ?][Xiao Yu gege: Then why\u2019d you message me?]It was the first time Yue Zhishi felt Song Yu actually wasn\u2019t as busy as he said he was. He read Song Yu\u2019s question, and his first reaction to it was very simpleminded, leading him to reply with a plain sentence without much emotion.[Yue Zhishi: I can\u2019t message you if I have nothing to say?]He read his message again after he sent it and inexplicably felt it didn\u2019t sound quite right \u2014 and yet he couldn\u2019t really explain how it sounded wrong. He stared at it for a while before he finally turned to Jiang Yufan for help.Jiang Yufan squinted at it and then laughed. \u201cHow come you sound like a little wife throwing a tantrum? \u2018Can\u2019t message you if I have nothing to say?\u2019\u201d He read out the line in a very exaggerated tone. \u201cYou dare to say stuff like that even with your brother\u2019s temper.\u201dNo wonder he felt particularly awkward. That sentence carried emotional ambiguity when in writing \u2014 if he\u2019d asked Song Yu that question face to face, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have used the tone Jiang Yufan just added.He was just going to explain when Song Yu responded.[Xiao Yu gege: You can.]He can?This reply was already very odd, and even more strange was the lengthy amount of time the little chat box displayed the words \u2018the other party is currently typing\u2026\u2019 Yue Zhishi waited for a very long time, and yet he didn\u2019t receive any new messages. He was starting to nervously suspect Song Yu was writing an essay to reprimand him.Just as they were leaving the cafeteria and preparing to return back to their night self-study session, Yue Zhishi finally received a message right before he turned off his phone.[Xiao Yu gege: You can call me after 10:15pm. My lessons finish then.][Xiao Yu gege: If you want.]Xia Zhixu walked over carrying his food tray and saw Song Yu staring at his phone. He\u2019d thought Song Yu would never bring his phone out since only the cafeteria and dormitory had signal.He placed his tray onto the table with a bang, Song Yu raising his head. Even though his facial expressions always changed in very minute ways, Xia Zhixu was able to catch a very very small hint of guilt. \u201cTut tut, you look like you\u2019ve been caught cheating.\u201dSong Yu flipped his phone face-side down and lowered his head to eat his wontons. He very calmly said, \u201cAre you finally bored enough to entertain yourself with analysing facial expressions?\u201d\u201cI finally managed to force your important self to say such a long sentence.\u201d Xia Zhixu cracked up, his tiger teeth exuberantly displaying. \u201cI\u2019m so curious, what kind of person could get you to be so focused on chatting? Don\u2019t tell me someone with facial paralysis like you has a habit of getting into online relationships.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not chatting,\u201d Song Yu flatly denied. \u201cI\u2019m just reading the news on Weibo.\u201dHis words had just left his mouth when his phone suddenly decided to crazily notify him of messages, one after another, causing the entire table to follow along in shaking.It was like the phone came with the ability to undermine Song Yu\u2019s words.Song Yu\u2019s face said \u2018I don\u2019t feel awkward at all\u2019, and he calmly lifted his phone and opened up WeChat.[Yue Zhishi: Really?!][Yue Zhishi: I want to call!! I really want to!!!!][Yue Zhishi: How about tonight, gege? I want to call you today!][Yue Zhishi: Can I call you every day? I promise I\u2019ll only speak for a little while, I\u2019ll definitely won\u2019t bother you!][Yue Zhishi: Please please [pitiful puppy sticker.jpg]]Xia Zhixu couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud. \u201cWhat big thing is happening on your Weibo? The push notifications are so excessive. It wouldn\u2019t happen to be some big celebrity courageously revealing they\u2019re in a relationship, right?\u201d He fished out his own phone. \u201cLet me have a look too.\u201dSong Yu could feel the vein on his temple jumping.Right now, he was in regret \u2014 regretting offering Yue Zhishi a chance to call him as a way to distract him from being angry.\u201cI won\u2019t make fun of you anymore.\u201d Xia Zhixu put down his phone and started to eat his noodles. \u201cYou should hurry up and reply.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s phone shook once again, and Xia Zhixu took the chance to tease him again. \u201cLook, that person\u2019s impatiently waiting.\u201dSong Yu never intended to speak too much with Xia Zhixu, so he lowered his head and looked at his messages[Yue Zhishi: Song Yu gege, are you resting? Can I call you for just one minute? I really want to hear your voice right now.]Xia Zhixu\u2019s attention remained on Song Yu, who took his phone and left the cafeteria without finishing his wontons. After a moment, as if he\u2019d solved one of the world\u2019s biggest mysteries, he sent a message to Xu Qichen who was far away in Jingjian.[Zhixu: Let me tell you, Song Yu is definitely in an online relationship!]The author has something to say:Having received this message \u2014\u2014 [Yue Zhishi: I can\u2019t message you if I have nothing to say?]Little Jade\u2019s inner heart: Is he angry? He\u2019s definitely angry. He must be, I made my little brother angry.Xia Zhixu: what is this facial paralysed guy doing?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 32: Unpredictable ChangesYue Zhishi heard Song Yu\u2019s voice for the first time after so many days of the training camp. He was very happy, and even though he\u2019d said the phone call would last only one minute, the call was twelve minutes and three seconds long when he hung up.From childhood, as long as he was separated from Song Yu, Yue Zhishi would feel a large sense of anxiety and often cried because of it when he was younger. When he\u2019d been in kindergarten, he understood there was no point in crying because Song Yu was studying at a different place, but it was different once he started elementary school \u2014 Yue Zhishi knew Song Yu was on the fourth year students\u2019 floor and yet he wasn\u2019t able to casually look for him. Little children who\u2019d just started their schooling weren\u2019t really able to follow the rules, and Yue Zhishi was also a late bloomer, tears frequently rolling down his face as he missed his gege while in class.Because Song Yu had once said he couldn\u2019t cry loudly while outside, the Yue Zhishi who\u2019d just started elementary school constantly sat in class while large drops of tears silently fell from his eyes. Even now, his first year school books were still wrinkled.The teachers had been busily directing the lessons and had occasionally looked up to see Yue Zhishi crying. He hadn\u2019t dared to release any noise while he cried and had even obediently crossed his arms on his desk like his fellow classmates \u2014 except his whole face was completely wet. His class advisor once found him too pitiful and had allowed him to listen in Song Yu\u2019s class, so he took a small chair upstairs to class 4-8\u2019s room and sat in the aisle next to Song Yu\u2019s seat.He\u2019d stopped crying and peacefully sat there for the entire lesson. When the English teacher got the year four students to stand up and recite vocabulary, Yue Zhishi had also obediently followed along, his two hands tucked behind his back.But Song Yu scolded him that night once they\u2019d returned home.\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to come over anymore. What are you crying for, you\u2019re already an elementary school student.\u201dYue Zhishi had felt very wronged. \u201cI cried because I really missed you.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t know what to say after hearing Yue Zhishi\u2019s words. He was also only just an elementary year four student and had yet to be able to say any deep or profound principles. He also knew Yue Zhishi, as a stubborn child, wouldn\u2019t be able to understand any normal reasoning.\u201cIf\u2026 if you miss me, you should focus on studying well. I\u2019ll also be studying seriously.\u201d\u201cAnd then\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi had been puzzled.\u201cAnd then I\u2019ll know you miss me, because we\u2019ll be doing the exact same thing. Do you get it?\u201d Song Yu had left his room after awkwardly saying some final words. \u201cYou\u2019ll affect me if you come to my class. I won\u2019t be able to receive your signal.\u201dThose words sufficiently tricked Yue Zhishi for at least a year and a half and successfully created the habit of independently going to class.He had been like that at three years old, and he had still been like that at seven years old \u2014 so to Yue Zhishi, it wasn\u2019t anything embarrassing to express how much he missed Song Yu. He\u2019d done it often enough since he was a child.Before he hung up his phone call with Song Yu, he once again repeated, he really missed him.Song Yu didn\u2019t give him a reply, only pausing for a few seconds before he said he would bring home some Beijing pastry specialities for Yue Zhishi.But he very quickly corrected himself and said never mind, Yue Zhishi might be allergic and wouldn\u2019t be able to try them.Song Yu very rarely forgot Yue Zhishi\u2019s allergy, so he was particularly flustered at this rudimentary error. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t mind, however, and happily started planning how he would pick Song Yu up the day the training camp finished.They spoke on the phone every night for the next two, three days. The calls were all within a fifteen minute timeframe, and Xia Zhixu initially teased Song Yu about it before he got used to it. Besides, he was the one who could squat in the corridor and speak on the phone until the early hours of the morning. One day, he came back particularly early, and Song Yu mocked him, asking why he had nothing to say today \u2014 Xia Zhixu only shrugged and said Xu Qichen had fallen asleep as they talked.Song Yu caught a glimpse of the phone Xia Zhixu left on his bedside table. He\u2019d yet to hang up, and he lightly, carefully moved about, lifting the phone to his ear for a little while after he finished showering. He didn\u2019t say a single word the entire time, listening only to his phone.Song Yu woke up once in the middle of the night and felt there was a slight glow in the room. He got up to look around.Xia Zhixu was sleeping very deeply, but his phone still remained on the call screen interface.Song Yu initially wanted to bring it up and mock him that night when they were both going to their phone calls, but Xia Zhixu\u2019s phone was stolen that day. He hurriedly borrowed Song Yu\u2019s phone to call his parents and to contact Xu Qichen.But Xu Qichen didn\u2019t pick up his phone calls.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know my contact details,\u201d Song Yu said. \u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t pick up calls from unknown numbers.\u201dXia Zhixu then went onto WeChat and sent Xu Qichen many, many messages, but he yet again didn\u2019t receive a reply. Xu Qichen replied with only one message the next day: okay, I understand.Keeping in touch turned troublesome now that he didn\u2019t have a phone. Even though Song Yu told him he could borrow his phone, Xia Zhixu didn\u2019t want to bother him \u2014 he occasionally logged onto WeChat, but he wasn\u2019t really able to contact Xu Qichen.\u201cWe\u2019ll be back in a few days. I\u2019ll sneak out tomorrow to buy a phone if I can\u2019t handle it.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t able to implement his plan though, as the pressure of the training camp\u2019s latter stages reached its highest peak. He had no way to go outside and also had no time to even use a phone. The camp held many mock competitions, and everyone performed quite well so the teachers specifically brought the students out to eat a nice dinner. They even broke their own rules and allowed the students to go back to their dormitory for an early rest.Xia Zhixu bought two bottles of orange-flavoured\u00a0Bei Bing Yang soda\u00a0before heading upstairs to the dorm. Coincidentally, just as the two of them were waiting for the lift, the dormitory building lost electricity. There was nothing to do in the building so everyone ran outside, and Song Yu and Xia Zhixu decided to wait outside as well, sitting on the edge of a flower bed.It was very hard to see stars in this city. Xia Zhixu tilted his head up and searched for a while before he lowered his head back down. \u201cTime went by so quickly. Only three days left.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t speak, taking a sip of the soda and finding it a bit too sweet.\u201cIt\u2019s college entrance exams soon.\u201d Xia Zhixu bumped into his shoulder. \u201cNervous?\u201dSong Yu shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Xia Zhixu spread his legs wide open, very relaxed. \u201cI feel like you\u2019re never nervous no matter what you do. Always effortlessly and easily doing the things you need to do.\u201dSong Yu glanced at him. \u201cAren\u2019t you the same?\u201dXia Zhixu also shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m just pretending most of the time.\u201d He bent his right leg and wrapped an arm around it. \u201cIsn\u2019t it strange? I always look like I\u2019m a positive person, but actually I\u2019m running away from reality every day. Sometimes I\u2019ll be with a group of people, laughing about this or chatting about that, but secretly, I\u2019m thinking\u00a0I\u2019m so tired\u00a0or\u00a0I\u2019m so bored\u00a0or\u00a0I want to go home. And yet, I\u2019ll continue to fake it because only this way will things be less troublesome.\u201dEven if Xia Zhixu hadn\u2019t said it out loud, Song Yu had long felt this about him.He thought about something and hesitated, wondering if he should bring it up. He watched as the air bubbles in his glass bottle popped, one by one.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like troublesome things so much, then in the future\u2026 What are you going to do?\u201dXia Zhixu looked at him and asked in confusion, \u201cIn the future?\u201dSong Yu gazed at his eyes. \u201cStop pretending.\u201d He said further, \u201cI can already tell.\u201dXia Zhixu finally understood.He buried his head in his knees and released a long, long sigh. He remained silent for a while, and then he placed the glass bottle in his hands onto the edge of the flower bed. \u201cI just want to take each day as it comes.\u201d He stared at the ground. \u201cHaven\u2019t you felt like that before? When you\u2019re about to do something you\u2019re really unsure about, you just want everything to remain the same.\u201dIt was clearly Xia Zhixu who said those words, but for Song Yu, it felt like those words were cut directly from his heart.Seeing Song Yu didn\u2019t reply, Xia Zhixu raised his head, sniffing. He looked like he suddenly thought of something and asked, laughing, \u201cHey, did you go to Zhongshan Park when you were a kid?\u201d\u201cWhat a stupid question,\u201d Song Yu said.\u201cHave you fed pigeons before?\u201dSong Yu speechlessly stared at him.Xia Zhixu grinned at him with his tiger teeth. \u201cOf course you have. I used to really love feeding pigeons when I was younger. I\u2019d buy a little pouch of bird food, pour a bit into the palm of my hand and crouch down. They\u2019d all come flying to me. You\u2019d think they\u2019d be scared of people, but they were so friendly when they came close and would happily eat the food. But if you said they weren\u2019t scared of people\u2026 As soon as I reached out a hand to touch them, they would flutter their wings and fly away. And once they flew away, they never came back.\u201d\u201cI feel like that right now. Do you get it?\u201d Xia Zhixu asked, smile hanging on his lips.Song Yu\u2019s hand was frozen by the soda.Of course he did. It was just that compared to Xia Zhixu, their situations weren\u2019t quite the same. His pigeon might always follow behind him, unable to be driven away, but in order to prevent anything dangerous from happening, not only did he need to pull his hand back, he needed to push him away.After a silent moment, Song Yu opened his mouth. \u201cThen you plan on continuing on like you\u2019ve always had?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Xia Zhixu looked at the lights not too far away. \u201cSometimes I imagine \u2014 both of us going to the same university, taking the same general education courses. He\u2019d watch as I played in basketball competitions. We\u2019d join the same university society and go to dinner parties together. We might even rent an apartment together during our internship years and become flatmates. I think being like that would be enough.\u201dSong Yu softly laughed once. \u201cYou ask for so little.\u201dXia Zhixu shook his head in self mockery. \u201cWhat I ask for is directly proportionate to the probability of it happening. The world is so large. Being able to meet someone you really like, someone the same gender as you, and to have that someone like you back \u2014 that\u2019s definitely something with a low probability of actually coming true.\u201dWhat he said was reasonable. Song Yu subconsciously calculated his own probability \u2014 it might be even lower.Even movies wouldn\u2019t dare show something so coincidental.\u201cBeing able to be friends and stay together every day is already good enough.\u201d After a momentary pause, Xia Zhixu slapped his thigh, seemingly in a very generous manner. \u201cAs to whether he\u2019ll have a girlfriend in the future or not, as long as I don\u2019t imagine it, then he won\u2019t.\u201dThat kind of self-deceptive, escapist mindset could really only make Xia Zhixu himself laugh. Song Yu couldn\u2019t.The dormitory building\u2019s electricity finally came back, and the training camp teachers all ushered them inside. Xia Zhixu stood up and gave a large stretch. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cMn.\u201dHe thought \u2014 maybe it was because they didn\u2019t see each other often even though his relationship with Song Yu was quite good, or maybe it was because Song Yu was someone naturally quite tightlipped that he was able to say such utter nonsense without worrying about it.He\u2019ll just pretend he shared his secrets with an unresponsive tree hole.Since tree holes wouldn\u2019t have their own secrets anyway.Song Yu also stood up. He didn\u2019t have a habit of comforting others, and he also knew comfort was useless in this case. But as he spoke with Xia Zhixu, he couldn\u2019t help but occasionally remember the lunch together under the rain and Xu Qichen\u2019s red ear.The two hands briefly touching before falling away.His mind cleared in a flash, as if an example showing him how to solve the question finally arrived in front of his eyes. He wasn\u2019t an exam marker, only a student on the sidelines who didn\u2019t know the right answers from the wrong ones \u2014 and yet he still wanted to take part in this particular test.Compared to him, Xia Zhixu clearly had a chance to keep the pigeon by his side.\u201cYou should give it a try.\u201dXia Zhixu froze. He didn\u2019t expect the tree hole to respond, let alone to respond with such a suggestion.Song Yu spoke calmly and yet full of certainty. \u201cAfter you go back this time, just try once. The result might be better than what you can imagine.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know how this question would be marked.But he really hoped his answer was correct.The one month high pressure training camp finally ended, and the flight from the training camp back to school was scheduled for noon. Xia Zhixu dragged Song Yu from the dormitory in the early morning hours, saying he needed to buy something when he was actually going to look for gifts.They went to a local famous bookstore, Xia Zhixu needing to pick up a book he reserved a long time ago. Song Yu listened by the sidelines, and only then learned that the book was actually really hard to buy \u2014 it was a limited edition run of the original English publication with the author\u2019s signature. It was only because the author had once held a fan signing in this bookstore that Xia Zhixu was able to buy it.\u201cWhat are you going to buy? I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d With his newly purchased book, Xia Zhixu was in a very good mood.Song Yu shook his head, expressing he didn\u2019t need to bring gifts back home. But Xia Zhixu didn\u2019t believe him at all and kept trying to pull him there and pull him here, before finally discovering a store offering handmade notebooks behind the original bookstore. Xia Zhixu refused to leave once he went inside and spent two hours making a small motivational notebook, the outside leather covering also personally sewn by Xia Zhixu himself.As for Song Yu, he created a sketchbook filled with 16K paper. The leather cover was steely gray, and after the store owner said he could manually engrave either some characters or personal design onto it, Song Yu wavered for a moment before drawing a triangular block of cheese with holes. He carefully etched it onto the leather.Despite having quick brains for answering questions, the two of them turned particularly clumsy at doing handiwork. They weren\u2019t satisfied no matter what they did and ended up being almost late for the assembly to go to the airport.The flight was landing after taking a nap, and they once again got onto the same coach that had initially taken them away. Song Yu really detested flights \u2014 he wasn\u2019t able to sleep well on the flight, so he continued to nap after getting on the bus. He put on his earphones as the coach kept rocking and swaying, his senses all blurred and fuzzy.The complicated anxiety of finally being close to home after a long absence gave birth to a dream.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t see anything concrete in his dream, only fainting hearing Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice as it transmitted to him through a radio wave. Yue Zhishi pretended to not understand how to answer a question despite knowing exactly what to do. A girl in the row behind him swept open the curtains on the windows, the light stinging his eyes, and he was finally able to clearly see his dimly lit dream. Yue Zhishi was standing in the light not too far away, staying exactly in place.Song Yu walked towards him, hand holding a sketchbook he may never again make in his lifetime.At least in his dream, he was unable to stay where he was.As they were about to reach Jingjian High, his surroundings abruptly became noisy, and the music in his earphones could no longer block the chatter. Song Yu frowned and heard Xia Zhixu\u2019s voice.\u201cClass 4? What happened to class 4?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s real, but this forum post really writes like it is. And it\u2019s been circulated all over QQ\u2026\u201dSong Yu opened his eyes and saw Xia Zhixu next to him not looking quite right. He held onto someone else\u2019s phone and browsed online, but his hand was slightly shaky, his eyebrows tightly knit together.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What are you looking at?\u201dXia Zhixu didn\u2019t give him a single shred of response. Song Yu felt even more strongly that there was a problem, so he took off his earphones. \u201cHey, what happened.\u201dXia Zhixu reached out a hand just as he finished speaking and held onto the seat in front of him, his eyes lost and confused. He blinked multiple times. Song Yu very rarely saw him like this \u2014 no matter where and when, Xia Zhixu always displayed a sunlit warmth different from ordinary people. And yet at this moment, he looked as if he\u2019d collapsed.Song Yu noticed that the boy sitting behind him looked worried. The phone was most likely his, so he leaned over and asked what happened.He was a younger student in Jingjian, and even he was a bit perplexed. \u201cThere\u2019s a really popular forum post in our school today, it\u2019s been spread everywhere in QQ. I only gave it to senior to have a look, I also don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d He was a bit worried and went up to pat Xia Zhixu\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSenior, what\u2019s wrong, are you okay?\u201dForum post?The bus stopped while Song Yu was confused, and their lead teacher reminded all the Jingjian students that they\u2019d already arrived. Xia Zhixu, without taking his bag, rushed off the bus as everyone looked on with uncertain eyes.\u201cXia Zhixu!\u201d Song Yu followed behind him with his bag. In just this short amount of time, Xia Zhixu had already ran past the school entrance, but Song Yu was stopped outside.\u201cStudent, you\u2019re not wearing our school\u2019s uniform, are you?\u201dSong Yu stood outside the entrance and yelled Xia Zhixu\u2019s name once again \u2014 but it was like he didn\u2019t hear him at all, running desperately towards the teaching building.\u201cSenior Song Yu.\u201d The junior who was just sitting behind Xia Zhixu rushed over. \u201cLet me bring senior\u2019s bag.\u201dWith a lowered head, Song Yu looked at Xia Zhixu\u2019s bag. It was very heavy, the book he\u2019d anxiously wanted to gift and the notebook he\u2019d made by hand resting inside \u2014 and yet he\u2019d forgotten to take even these away with him.The coach didn\u2019t wait for him. Song Yu stood in front of Jingjian\u2019s entrance by himself, lost in his thoughts.He thought about the forum post the junior had mentioned, so he took out his phone and tentatively explored an online space he\u2019d never really seen before. Quite a lot of his junior high classmates had entered Jingjian for high school, and the two high schools\u2019 social circles actually overlapped quite substantially. He kept scrolling downwards in a hurry until he finally saw an reposted article. Song Yu\u2019s fingers paused and no longer moved.He was frozen for a second.The article\u2019s headline was as eye-catching as if it\u2019d come straight from a gossip tabloid. If he\u2019d seen it on a normal day, Song Yu would\u2019ve ignored it \u2014 but the protagonist of this particular article was Xu Qichen.[High school class 3-4\u2019s class adviser and male student is in a romantic relationship, complete with photos and the truth. Is the school not going to care about this?]There was only one photo in the article, and it wasn\u2019t strong proof by any means. It only showed Xu Qichen getting into a car, and it looked like his young male class adviser was also inside. Other than that, the article listed a bunch of things as evidence that had yet to be proved, such as unusual meetings outside of class or even awards obtained through improper methods.Replies to the article have already been shared, rumours spreading like wild fire. Every single person hotly and vividly debated this issue, as if everyone had seen the two of them do something in person.Watching as all these people turned the cool and calm Xu Qichen into a ruthless character who knew how to seduce an adult man for his own personal gain, Song Yu felt this was an absurd situation \u2014 and yet he also felt it was very realistic. He had always viewed the world negatively and was never too surprised when something unpleasant happened.Talent brought glory and achievements in exchange, but they could always be distorted into illicit, dirty results. It was the inevitable evil of humans constantly chasing after excitement and stimulation.In the eyes of the public, how could the truth be more important than the dramatic ups and downs of life?Even though he\u2019d always admitted to being detached and indifferent, Song Yu suddenly saw the article and the sarcastic, mocking replies from Xia Zhixu\u2019s perspective, as if he\u2019d entered his body for a moment.The students in the replies viewed the article only as gossip, and not many people actually suspected if the article\u2019s claim was true. Song Yu\u2019s junior high classmate who\u2019d reposted it had included only one sentence in his post.[Oh my god, a homosexual teacher/student pair \u2014 even TV wouldn\u2019t film something so stimulating, that student\u2019s finished]Song Yu stared at that sentence, mood very complicated. It felt like something was forcefully peeled off of him, exposing a not very honest and forthright heart. His imagination replaced a few words in that sentence \u2014 and then the sentence became a coldly shining knife that gouged out his heart and threw it under the sun.The bell for the afternoon\u2019s final class rang, and students came out one after another. Many of them stayed by the entrance to pick up their food deliveries. Song Yu, with his uniform from another school, was as conspicuous as if he was an alien.He wanted to message Xia Zhixu and say something, but he abruptly remembered Xia Zhixu was so pitiful he had nothing left \u2014 not even a cell phone.There was an endless stream of traffic on the road. Song Yu went and caught a taxi back to Peiya, and the driver kept up his friendly chatter the entire way. Song Yu couldn\u2019t utter a single word, so the embarrassed driver stopped his one-sided conversation. Song Yu paid, a single apology leaving his mouth as he got out of the car. After he turned around, he stopped in his tracks.There weren\u2019t many people at the school entrance. The junior high students had already left the school at noon for their monthly break, and only high school students remained to complete an extra half day of lessons. Just outside the school, Yue Zhishi sat on a little stool in front of the newsstand in a cream-coloured sweater and read a newly bought magazine, his head drooped.He looked very absorbed in what he was reading. Song Yu knew, no matter what Yue Zhishi did, he would always focus his all to it.But Song Yu had forgotten a long time ago \u2014 such a good habit was actually taught by himself.Separated by ten metres, Song Yu quietly gazed at him, like a stranger. Sometimes he really did wish he could be a stranger.Maybe it was telepathy, but Yue Zhishi lifted his head as he turned a page, and his eyes matched up with Song Yu\u2019s as he stood in the distance.\u201cSong Yu gege?\u201d Yue Zhishi immediately stood up, a smile very quickly diffusing across his face. His hair, facial expression, clothes, even the way he ran over to Song Yu \u2014 they were all especially soft and filled with joy like a little puppy who had waited for his master for a very, very long time. Every single action played in slow motion in Song Yu\u2019s heart, full of pleasing little details.But at that moment, Song Yu\u2019s mind was still flooded with those unkind taunts, the violence that was camouflaged by curiosity.As he stood in the wind, Song Yu hoped those dark things would stay behind him. He hoped Yue Zhishi would forever stay brilliant.Yue Zhishi ran over and stopped in front of his gege, not even taking the time to take a breath before he said, \u201cThe training bus was just here. I thought you\u2019d come out, but only one person came down after waiting for a long time. I asked the driver, and he said you got off earlier. I even thought you wouldn\u2019t come back to school.\u201dI thought you\u2019d forgotten I would come pick you up.Song Yu could imagine how Yue Zhishi looked like as he waited in front of the bus door, peering inside. He managed to move the corners of his mouth with difficulty. \u201cThen why are you still waiting here.\u201dYue Zhishi smiled at him. \u201cI thought you\u2019d come back. And\u2026\u201dHis eyelashes fluttered down, and a harmless innocence that begged to be protected spread across his face. \u201cYou told me before to stay where I was and wait for you.\u201dYue Zhishi tugged at his hair before he realised what he\u2019d just said was a bit strange. \u201cI mean, if I went to look for you\u2026 I didn\u2019t know where you were, and you didn\u2019t reply to my messages\u2026\u201d\u201cLe Le.\u201dSong Yu interrupted him with the name Yue Zhishi had rarely heard from him after growing up.He was stunned and looked at him in confusion. \u201cHm?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so tired.\u201d His voice was a bit hoarse, and a vulnerability inconsistent from the usual Song Yu exhaled from all over his body, making Yue Zhishi feel disorientated and worried. After so many years, he\u2019d never once seen Song Yu so directly express his own uncomfortable and negative feelings.As a child, Yue Zhishi felt that his heart was actually grown on Song Yu\u2019s body. Even if Song Yu injured his knee and let out a lot of blood while playing soccer, his face had remained expressionless as his injury was treated. It was only Yue Zhishi who would cry.Wildly and luxuriously green\u00a0Chinese parasol trees\u00a0shielded Peiya\u2019s empty school entrance. They stood on both sides of the street and grew, flourishing, until they almost gobbled up the blue sky. A\u00a0southern magnolia flower\u00a0fell noiselessly onto the soil. Large, roaring trucks passed behind them, carrying heavy cargo almost about to exceed their weight load.The earth was trembling.Yue Zhishi took a step forward and wrapped his arms around Song Yu.He put his chin on Song Yu\u2019s shoulder, his soft palm slowly caressing up and down his back. \u201cGege, lean on me.\u201d\u201cLet me charge your battery, okay?\u201dThe author has something to say:PS: the side ship isn\u2019t BE, they\u2019ll be together after a few years. They\u2019ll occasionally appear later in order to prompt changes in gege\u2019s emotions. This ship actually isn\u2019t too angsty \u2014 the saddest part has been witnessed by Song Yu.Let me just say one more time, there are no big knives in Song Yu and Le Le\u2019s relationship development (such as a break up and then reunite together later like some readers are imagining), but there has to be small setbacks. This particular matter was a type of awakening for gege \u2014 it has definitely affected him.Lovely Allergen\u2019s couple can be considered as fauxcest with an older gong. There\u2019s no way they can start understanding their feelings, confirm their relationship and get married without any worries. There has to be some emotional changes and struggles as they go through their journey (all of my books are like this). But really, there are no big knives like breaking up and then getting back together later (of course, I plan on writing a book with that tag later, I already have the initial characters x)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33: May All Your Wishes Come TrueXu Qichen\u2019s rumours spread also to Peiya. Compared to the Jingjian who was in the centre of the storm, Peiya\u2019s students weren\u2019t much calmer: everyone loved gossip. The rumours were grossly exaggerated, and different kinds of the \u2018truth\u2019 came out, each version stranger and more contrived than the last.The gossip recklessly misrepresented Xu Qichen\u2019s personality and usual behaviour. The gossipers have never even seen him before, and yet they all acted as if they were the ones who understood him best. \u201cI heard\u201d, \u201callegedly\u201d, \u201cjust by looking at that face\u201d, \u201ceveryone\u2019s heard already\u201d \u2014 in the midst of all these illogical, empty words, the person concerned had already lost his true identity.The second day after the training camp finished, Song Yu returned back to school. Another boy sitting at his table in the cafeteria during lunch started to talk about this topic.\u201cI\u2019m sure you guys must\u2019ve heard right, about that guy from Jingjian. A male student having an affair with a male teacher.\u201d The boy\u2019s sexual orientation was the same as a large majority of the population, and his belief in his superiority showed in his words. \u201cIt\u2019s so disgusting how a man can like another man. Good thing they\u2019re not here, or else I wouldn\u2019t even dare come to school.\u201d A few of the people around him burst into laughter after he finished.Qin Yan picked up a bite of the communal food dishes with his chopsticks and threw it into his food tray, lazily saying, \u201cThat\u2019s enough. There\u2019s plenty of girls who like boys on the streets. Do you see them liking any random guy they see? It\u2019s the same for gay men too.\u201dThe other student\u2019s face fell in irritation. \u201cSo what? Gay people can\u2019t be gossiped about? Don\u2019t tell me you like guys too.\u201dQin Yan placed down his chopsticks. \u201cHonestly, I like pretty girls with long, straight black hair. But even if I suddenly turned gay one day, I still wouldn\u2019t like men from the\u00a0Qing Dynasty.\u201dSong Yu had been silently brooding as they talked. He grabbed his still fairly full food tray and stood up as Qin Yan was speaking, walking away with a look on his face. Qin Yan saw how he looked and also followed him with his food tray.The fourth day after they came back from the training camp, Song Yu finally received Xia Zhixu\u2019s WeChat reply.[Xia Zhixu: I\u2019m fine.]But Song Yu didn\u2019t feel like he was truly fine. The people surrounding him were all very noisy, and his desk mate was taking the chance to catch up on sleep. He sent a message.[Song Yu: If you\u2019d like to play some basketball, you can look for me during the weekend.]He very rarely cared about others, but Song Yu wasn\u2019t able to be a completely indifferent bystander when it came to Xia Zhixu. Maybe it was because he just happened to witness his breakdown, or maybe it was because he really did consider Xia Zhixu as his mirror.The mirror was shattered, and his reflection in it was also in pieces.The sky was grey, and the rain came down in needles, drizzling down in a way this city rarely saw. Song Yu gazed out the window, lost in his thoughts. A memory drifted back again into his mind \u2014 of that day he stood outside Peiya\u2019s school entrance after he\u2019d just come back from the training camp.It was very hard for him to describe how it had felt to be embraced by Yue Zhishi after witnessing an example of such utter defeat.If he had to describe it, then he would probably describe it as drinking poison to end his thirst.That day, Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t ask a single thing, only soothingly saying, let\u2019s go home, we can watch a documentary together?As if he were the child and Yue Zhishi was a very mature adult.For the first time, they took the streets home from school. The road was very long, and Yue Zhishi had tightly held onto him the entire way, sharing a lot of happy things that had happened at school. He\u2019d also told him one of Aunt Rong\u2019s friends had a border collie and that border collie had recently given birth. The puppies were particularly cute when he\u2019d gone to see them.Yue Zhishi would never tire of putting in all his effort to transfer his warmth to Song Yu.But Song Yu hadn\u2019t given him too much of a response.From the very moment he\u2019d seen that post, an intention to retreat grew in Song Yu. He\u2019d thought \u2014 forget it, this is too dangerous, even the heavens were trying to warn him away. But once he faced Yue Zhishi in person, there was no way for him to withdraw so firmly and decisively.Sure enough, he wasn\u2019t mature at all.Song Yu didn\u2019t end up gifting the handmade sketchbook to Yue Zhishi. He kept it in his school bag, and sometimes he\u2019d see it whenever he went to grab his textbooks and pretend to not see it. After a little while longer, he pushed it into his desk drawer and hid it underneath many, many books.He lay on his desk after class, eyes closed in rest. His phone vibrated.[Xia Zhixu: I can\u2019t distract you from studying. We can play again after exams.]Before he could respond, a new message appeared in their chat.[Xia Zhixu: I finally managed to see him. But it didn\u2019t look like he wanted to see me. He said he wasn\u2019t homosexual and also didn\u2019t want to be friends with me anymore.][Xia Zhixu: You said I should give it a try. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a chance anymore.]That night with no electricity, the shoddy pigeon analogies and Xia Zhixu\u2019s conservative imagination \u2014 they all felt like omens. Song Yu thought, if Xia Zhixu had tried to flinch back one more time before this stuff happened, he would\u2019ve pushed at his shoulder and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201dBut now, there was no way for him to say such a thing.Xia Zhixu and Xu Qichen were an example with a higher chance of success, and yet they ended so explicitly in front of Song Yu. He\u2019d thought he was mature enough to stimulate the heart of someone so similar to him, wanting to create the results he desired. To say he was generous enough to want to help someone else achieve love? Not really.Song Yu knew \u2014 he was looking only a successful example nearby, so that he could give himself a little encouragement.When it came down to it, he was still too young.No one could ever guess what tomorrow will bring.Yue Zhishi would occasionally think about how Song Yu looked like that day he returned back to school.His exhaustion hadn\u2019t lasted too long. After they\u2019d arrived home, Song Yu didn\u2019t watch a documentary with him \u2014 only closing himself into his room, and when he came out again, he was once again the indifferent Song Yu.Even though his speech and actions weren\u2019t all too different compared to before he\u2019d left for the training camp, Yue Zhishi kept vaguely feeling as if Song Yu had changed slightly. He spoke even less than before and refused to express his inner thoughts even more.Once he returned back to school after the monthly break, Yue Zhishi also heard the rumours of Xu Qichen. Yue Zhishi would directly, face to face, object to anyone who tried to maliciously slander Xu Qichen in front of him.He strongly believed Xu Qichen wasn\u2019t the type of person they all said he was, but this event eventually left a shadow in Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart.So there were also boys who liked other men.From childhood, their education had taught only about opposite attraction. Very little other possibilities were brought to their attention in order to establish the same ideas in everyone. The start of awareness, the sprouting of consciousness, could only begin from doubt.Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but remember the rainy day they\u2019d first met. He thought about the subtly different relationship between Xu Qichen and Xia Zhixu and felt as it he\u2019d discovered something \u2014 and yet felt what he discovered wasn\u2019t clear enough.He\u2019d already been about to fall asleep when he turned over and opened his phone, searching online for some answers.In the morning, Yue Zhishi was almost late, startling awake only when he heard Lin Rong knocking at his door. The phone in his hand had already turned off from the lack of battery. He speedily cleaned up and went downstairs, and in the living room, he saw Song Yu pulling off his school shirt. Lean muscles covered all over his back, and they stretched with any random movement.A strange feeling suddenly grew in Yue Zhishi, and he stopped in his tracks.Lin Rong brought over another school shirt. \u201cThis one should be dry. I gave you the wrong one earlier, no wonder it was a bit damp. Here.\u201d She passed over the shirt to Song Yu and saw Yue Zhishi frozen in place once she lifted her head. She urged, \u201cLe Le, why are you still standing there, hurry and eat something. I can drive you guys to school today.\u201dSong Yu put on the new shirt and also looked around, meeting Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes for a short amount of time.His fingertips felt like they were electrified. Yue Zhishi dropped his eyes and hurried down to get ready.Lin Rong drove a small sedan, and after entering the car, Yue Zhishi and Song Yu each stuck to a car door and the window. The two of them were separated by a distance.After glancing at them through the rearview mirror, Lin Rong teased, \u201cLe Le, you\u2019ve grown up.\u201dYue Zhishi was a bit confused. \u201cHm?\u201d\u201cYou used to be stuck onto your brother\u2019s body.\u201d She laughed very prettily, her pearl earring swaying. \u201cHanging onto him like a little pendant.\u201dHearing her words, both Song Yu and Yue Zhishi turned and glanced at the gap between them. Two seconds later, Song Yu brought his head back to look at the passing scenery, and Yue Zhishi stared at the school bag on his lap.\u201cSticking together\u2019s a bit hot,\u201d Yue Zhishi weakly explained.\u2013The two weeks before the college entrance exams, Yue Zhishi kept falling sick with an upset stomach and once even had a fever.He was afraid the people at home would worry, so he secretly went to a nearby medical clinic. The old doctor sat there and only briefly looked at him before saying many students had come by lately, just like him, all sick from the excessive stress and tension of the upcoming exams.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. The more nervous you are, the more uncomfortable you\u2019ll be.\u201d The doctor gave him a general exam, sat down and pulled out a medical record book from his drawer. He glanced at the calendar. \u201cAh, it\u2019s already the 2nd. Then the college exams aren\u2019t that far away then.\u201dHis pen flew across the page, and without even lifting his head, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, and how old are you?\u201dYue Zhishi gave him his name and said, \u201cI\u2019m fifteen.\u201d He sat across from the doctor and honestly told him, \u201cI\u2019m not the one taking the college entrance exams.\u201d\u201cFifteen?\u201d The doctor pushed up his reading glasses. \u201cAh? I was thinking you looked too young for the college exams. Then you\u2019re worried about the high school exams?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I am.\u201d Yue Zhishi said, \u201cBut I am a bit nervous, I can\u2019t sleep well at night.\u201d He added, \u201cMy gege is about to take the college exams.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re worried for him.\u201d The doctor thought it was very funny. \u201cYou should think more about yourself, foolish child.\u201dYue Zhishi ended up taking a bunch of medicine home, his symptoms mostly disappearing after taking them for two days.The school soon notified the junior high department that they\u2019ll be setting up the college entrance exam venue in a few days so they needed to start moving all of their books home, the classrooms turning into the exam venue after being cleaned. From the creation of the venue to the end of the exam, all junior high students were then released from school, and Yue Zhishi could only study at home.He went downstairs looking for some food after some studying, and Lin Rong just happened to be video-chatting with a good friend. Lin Rong waved at him to go over, so he sat next to her with a pudding in his hands, very politely greeting\u00a0auntie.\u201cSo well behaved. You\u2019ve turned handsomer, too. Hey, Xiao Rong, both of your sons are taking entrance exams soon, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Lin Rong\u2019s face immediately changed, and she covered her heart with a hand. \u201cI hope they\u2019ll both stay healthy. We\u2019ll go on a trip after they finish.\u201d\u201cReally, other parents are worried about exam results while all you think about is going out to play. Hey, you know that Chen Xiaomei, the doctor? She went to the Guiyuan Temple the other day to burn some incense for her daughter.\u201dLin Rong laughed. \u201cDoes that really help?\u201d\u201cSomeone introduced the idea to her. Someone said before it\u2019s super miraculous, and it\u2019s making even me want to go and burn a stick of incense.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t be bothered to go, it\u2019s too troublesome. My eldest wouldn\u2019t be grateful for it anyway.\u201dYue Zhishi sat by the side and listened to their conservation, going upstairs after finishing his pudding. He turned on his computer and looked up Guiyuan Temple, unexpectedly seeing only good reviews. His education has always been secular and non-religious, but Yue Zhishi saw one particular review and felt it was particularly logical \u2014 if you sincerely believe, only then will it come true.Besides, Yue Zhishi was unhappy just thinking about how there would be someone in the same exam venue who will have burned some incense, prayed to a god and carried a protective talisman while Song Yu had nothing at all.If other people had something, gege must have it too.Yue Zhishi was a person of action, the next day leaving the house early with all the money he needed. He said he was going to KFC with a friend for some review and ran off. Guiyuan Temple was very far from home, so he took the subway all the way until he reached the right bus stop. He then took a very long bike ride before finally arriving at his destination.Since it was so close to the exams, the temple was completely packed with people. Yue Zhishi went in by himself and realised there were no guides inside \u2014 he had no choice but to follow the other worshippers. Guiyuan Temple was much larger than he expected, each temple building looking very similar to each other, and he circled around in confusion a few times asking for directions. There were also too many different bodhisattva statues, Yue Zhishi dizzy just by looking at the 500 arhat statues alone. He was tossed from side to side the entire afternoon until he finally managed to find the place he was looking for.He carefully observed the people around him as he lined up to offer incense. When it was finally his turn, he very seriously bowed and paid his respects.Please, you must protect and bless gege so that everything goes well. He sincerely, silently prayed.Before he left, Yue Zhishi went to try his hand at\u00a0Chinese\u00a0fortune sticks. Someone next to him teased, \u201cYou\u2019re so young and already here to worship. Do you understand what\u2019s written on the stick?\u201dA sentence resembling ancient poems was written on the fortune stick, and Yue Zhishi truthfully said he didn\u2019t and asked if he could explain it to him.\u201cAre you looking for answers for yourself? What\u2019d you ask for?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s for my ge.\u201d Worried that he would forget the explanation, Yue Zhishi took out his phone to record it down.The other person raised his glasses. \u201cI see.\u201d He gave the stick back to Yue Zhishi. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to request one for yourself? You\u2019ve come so far.\u201dThat was true \u2014 so Yue Zhishi prayed again, asking the same person to explain the stick to him before bringing both sticks home.Yue Zhishi was tired and fell asleep on the bus. He accidentally missed his stop and got off the bus at an unfamiliar station, heading across the road to take the bus going the opposite direction. He was hungry the entire way to the subway and was so mentally and physically tired he felt as if he himself went on a pilgrimage.As he sat on the subway, he pulled out his two fortune sticks and matched the two of them to the explanations he\u2019d recorded on his phone. Song Yu\u2019s stick had led him to Monk 169 Guanshen, while the stick he\u2019d prayed for himself had brought him to Monk 015 Futuo Mido. He compared the two and felt the fortune stick he received for himself had a better message.Song Yu came home a lot earlier than usual that night \u2014 it was the final day before the college exams.Song Yu had stopped going to and from school with Yue Zhishi after the training camp. It was the final sprint before the exams, so even after he returned home from school, Song Yu would still stay in his room to study and not come out.Yue Zhishi had also reached the critical time period for preparing for his own exams. But because of the growth of some inexplainable feeling, he lately hadn\u2019t gone to look for Song Yu on his own.They clearly lived under the same roof, and yet the two of them subtly stepped around each other.It started to rain again. Each year, the college entrance examinations would always be held on a rainy day, and Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but worry because of this \u2014 he\u2019d always felt rain was never a good sign. He opened his door when he heard noises from downstairs, and seeing Song Yu come home, he stood and waited in front of his room.Song Yu reached the last step on the stairs, shifting his head to look at him. His eyes slightly brightened, but his lowering eyelashes covered and hid away that light.\u201cYes?\u201d He walked over.Yue Zhishi\u2019s two hands were hidden behind his back, the gentle corridor light framing his pure gaze. It made Song Yu think about the message Yue Zhishi had sent before \u2014 seems like he\u2019d truly been mistaken. Yue Zhishi wouldn\u2019t get angry because of something like that.\u201cGege, I have something I want to give you.\u201d Yue Zhishi walked a bit closer.But Song Yu didn\u2019t look like he wanted to open his door. He stood in place. \u201cWhat?\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t want Lin Rong to find out, thinking it was a bit embarrassing to go to a temple all by himself, so he tried again. \u201cCan I go inside? I\u2019ll only take up a little bit of your time.\u201d\u201cHere is fine.\u201d Song Yu didn\u2019t move, and directly said what he guessed was happening. \u201cIf it\u2019s something you made by hand, or anything else, you can just give it me.\u201dDownstairs, Lin Rong just happened to look up and see them. \u201cWhy are you two standing in the corridor? Le Le, do you want some juice?\u201dYue Zhishi hurriedly shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m okay.\u201d He once again looked over and gave Song Yu a pitiful expression. He had no intention of giving up, but this time, he didn\u2019t reach out a hand and pull at Song Yu\u2019s wrist.His pair of large yet translucent light-coloured eyes was full of innocence, delivering his plea for Song Yu to take pity on him.Song Yu sometimes suspected that Yue Zhishi actually knew he had no way of rejecting him. His actions were always balanced exactly right and would never go too far. He\u2019d lift his legs just slightly higher than the threshold Song Yu had installed for him.He turned around, silently opening his door, and went inside to turn on the light, rejecting his own suspicions all by himself.He was wrong.He\u2019d never had a threshold towards Yue Zhishi.It was already spring, and the white wool rug had already been put away, the room once again turning into that icily cold space with not much signs of life. Yue Zhishi closed the door and jumped straight into what he\u2019d wanted to say, giving Song Yu the protective talisman in his hand.\u201cThis is a talisman I asked for at Guiyuan Temple, they all say it really works.\u201d Yue Zhishi was worried Song Yu wouldn\u2019t take it, so he very quickly introduced it like an insurance salesman. \u201cDid you know? There were so many people there to burn incense, and many of them all asked for this talisman. They all say it\u2019s legendary. The temple was really big and really confusing, I had to look around an entire morning before I found it. Not only that, when everyone else placed their incense sticks, they only knelt and bowed three times. I made sure to bow one more time compared to everyone else. The bodhisattvas definitely must\u2019ve seen how sincere I was.\u201dSong Yu lowered his head and considered the so called legendary talisman in his hand. Hearing Yue Zhishi\u2019s long-winded speech, he could already imagine how he\u2019d looked like, foolishly running around in the temple.He said he\u2019d bowed one extra time. It definitely wouldn\u2019t have been only once.\u201cThank you.\u201d Song Yu placed the talisman onto his desk and said nothing further.The understanding between them told Yue Zhishi that gege was hinting at him to leave. He very obviously started to get upset, feeling that gege truly didn\u2019t believe in these things just like how Aunt Rong had earlier said.\u201cNo need to thank me.\u201d Yue Zhishi sniffled, his next words very wobbly. \u201cIt\u2019ll rain all the way to tomorrow morning.\u201dSong Yu looked at how Yue Zhishi appeared to not want to leave and slightly wavered. They silently stood across from each other for around five seconds before Yue Zhishi decided to give up. The moment he was about to turn around and leave, Song Yu opened his mouth.\u201cWhich bodhisattva did you pray to?\u201d He picked up the talisman and asked a strange question.Yue Zhishi was obviously stupefied by his question, staring at Song Yu as he tried to think of the answer.After he\u2019d entered into Guiyuan Temple, his only thought was to find a talisman. He\u2019d circled around and around before he finally found one \u2014 there had been so many people, so he\u2019d simply lined up and waited for his turn. As to which bodhisattva\u2026He couldn\u2019t quite remember. Yue Zhishi frowned and seemingly seriously accused, \u201cAll bodhisattvas are celestial beings, how can you be picky?\u201dSong Yu silently sighed.He was seriously starting to suspect Yue Zhishi was actually Lin Rong\u2019s true son, and he himself was the one who\u2019d been brought back home.Not much longer, Yue Zhishi opened his mouth again. \u201cAh, I remember. I prayed to a double-sided\u00a0Guanyin.\u201d His eyes glowed, his facial expression looking as if he was saying, isn\u2019t that amazing, I prayed to Guanyin, and a double-sided one too.Song Yu nodded and, in front of Yue Zhishi, tucked the talisman into the bag he\u2019ll bring to the exam tomorrow, placing it with his identity tag.Yue Zhishi quickly pulled out the two fortune sticks he\u2019d also received while Song Yu had his head lowered. The stick referring him to Monk Futuo Mido was given to Song Yu, and he very solemnly said, this was requested for him.\u201cThis is mine?\u201d Song Yu looked at the words written on the stick.[There is a happy Buddha in the west, continue forward and smile at the world. You will be healthy and strong no matter what path you take, no troubles to deter you from anything you wish to do.]It didn\u2019t look like his no matter how he read it.Yue Zhishi nodded. \u201cYes, there was an expert next to me when I prayed. He told me this is a very high luck stick and is especially favourable. He even said this poem meant that the person who got the stick was compassionate and kind, and will never have any worries. He\u2019ll have a bright and beautiful future, and everything will go smoothly. No matter what he wishes for, it\u2019ll come true.Everything he wished for will come true.It sounded even less like him after Yue Zhishi\u2019s explanation.Song Yu glanced at him, seeing the other stick in his hand. He hadn\u2019t even said anything when Yue Zhishi noticed and immediately held it tighter, explaining, \u201cThis is mine.\u201dSong Yu stretched out a hand. \u201cLet me see.\u201dAfter he looked at it, the stick was better than Song Yu imagined, referring to Monk Guanshen. He\u2019d thought it would be a very low luck fortune stick.[It is ominous for a fish to see the abyss, hidden wisdom will bring disaster. The world is wide, throw away your worries and let nature run its course.]\u201cThis isn\u2019t a high luck stick, but it\u2019s not that bad either.\u201d Yue Zhishi wanted to take it back, but Song Yu wasn\u2019t planning on giving it to him and asked for his explanation. Yue Zhishi could only say simply, \u201cJust, let things happen the way they\u2019re meant to happen.\u201dIn order to prove these things really were true, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s true, I recently felt like my studies weren\u2019t improving and was really nervous. It looks like this bodhisattva is telling me to stop being so anxious and to let my fate be determined by the heavens.\u201dHearing this kind of explanation, Song Yu actually crooked the corners of his mouth, looking as if he was smiling. He gave the stick back to Yue Zhishi and told him to listen to the heavens and go to sleep.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t push to stay this time. He knew he couldn\u2019t keep bothering Song Yu and was also worried he\u2019d accidentally let something slip, so he left very quickly.Song Yu sat at his desk once the door closed, glancing at the red protective talisman inside his transparent identity tag and gazing at the fortune stick in his hand. It felt like the words written on it were giving him a hint, tapping and foreshadowing something.It was an unlucky thing for a fish to see clearly in the deep sea. Those who can see others\u2019 private thoughts will bring disaster to themselves \u2014 the smarter one was, the easier it was to sink and disappear into the mud. Only those who allow themselves to relax, to place down all those self-imposed worries, and let things happen naturally could continue to walk ahead.Song Yu abruptly realised: Yue Zhishi was the one who\u2019d went to a temple, and yet he was the one who believed in these mystical teachings. Yue Zhishi was the one who\u2019d prayed for the fortune sticks, and it was once again only himself who cared about the sticks\u2019 explanations.It was because Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t lost, wasn\u2019t worried. He wasn\u2019t a follower trapped in misery in urgent need of enlightenment \u2014 he only cared about being able to gift Song Yu a high luck stick.Even if there was only one, Yue Zhishi would still happily replace it and give him the best one.Now that he understood this, Song Yu felt like there was even less chance of curing himself.The author has something to say:Le Le darling is the world\u2019s most obedient little puppy 5555Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Locals would always say: it rained several East Lakes again today. Just by measuring with his eyes, Yue Zhishi conservatively guessed that at least six lakes rained over the two days of college entrance exams. Six was a good number \u2014 gege\u2019s exams must have definitely gone well.Song Yu\u2019s exam venue was in a very low area of the city, and the water flooded the area until the sunken sports ground almost became a lake. Yue Zhishi sat in Lin Rong\u2019s car, watching the time. There were less than five minutes remaining.The rain ran heavily down the car windows. Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t see the outside clearly, so he secretly lowered the window a bit. Parents blocked the school entrance with their umbrellas, and the rain poured through the crack in the window, wetting Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair.Not long after, he saw a tall figure carrying an umbrella in the distance, and it weaved through the packed crowd of parents to walk in their direction.\u201cGege\u2019s coming.\u201d Yue Zhishi opened the car door as soon as he finished speaking and waved at Song Yu. The heavy rain easily entered the car, and Yue Zhishi, who was only wearing a short-sleeved shirt, shivered.Song Yu clearly walked a bit faster and bent over to enter the car. He closed the door, locking the rain outside.The seats were all covered by Yue Zhishi\u2019s study materials, so he hurriedly cleared them away to make room for Song Yu.\u201cYour dad\u2019s still in a meeting.\u201d Lin Rong pulled out a neatly folded dry towel from her large tote bag and handed it over to Song Yu. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet up with him later at dinner. What do you want to eat?\u201d Even though she asked, she knew there was an eighty percent chance Song Yu would say he didn\u2019t care.Song Yu placed the drenched umbrella at his feet. \u201cLet\u2019s get crayfish.\u201dHearing this, Yue Zhishi was happier than anyone else. \u201cI want to eat crayfish too.\u201dLin Rong was a bit surprised \u2014 she didn\u2019t think Song Yu would want to eat that. \u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll let your dad know.\u201dThey drove to the restaurant, the rain growing heavier until it even started to thunder. Yue Zhishi\u2019s fear of thunder could be entirely seen by his physical reaction: they had just heard the bang of thunder when he started to tremble. This habit wasn\u2019t too bad when he was younger, but it embarrassed him after growing up. He tried his best to hold himself back from trembling. Everyone was originally chatting in the car, but because Yue Zhishi was too afraid, he\u2019d already left the conversation topic.Song Yu was aware of this, so he pulled out his exam bag and put it in between them, murmuring, \u201cThe thing you gave me was really useful.\u201dYue Zhishi was very quickly distracted. He turned his head to look at Song Yu\u2019s face and very quietly asked, \u201cReally? Do you think your exams went well?\u201dSong Yu nodded.Yue Zhishi very quickly cheered up, but it didn\u2019t last very long. A peal of thunder struck right as he opened his mouth, and he shuddered again, his voice slightly trembling. \u201cThat\u2019s really good\u2026.\u201dSong Yu felt he looked a bit cute like this. He lowered his eyes and leaned back into his seat.Yue Zhishi put on a pair of over-ear headphones and played some rock music, and then he picked up the big bag he\u2019d placed in the corner, placing it onto the left side of his seat. He turned around half his body and started to dig into it, searching for something with almost his entire body.He first pulled out a small purple bento box and put it directly onto Song Yu\u2019s leg after he turned back around. He very quickly flipped back to his bag and grabbed a bottle of soda water, giving this also to Song Yu.He never stopped moving and kept silent the entire time, as if he was a very busy mime actor. Song Yu opened the bento box \u2014 pieces of mango and strawberry and peeled grapes and lychees rested inside with some sparkling sugar syrup drizzled on top. It all looked very delicious.Yue Zhishi turned back to him and handed him a fork. Very loud music came from his headphones, and he looked like he\u2019d forgotten other people could hear him speak. He pantomimed cutting the pieces of fruit, and then finally pointed at himself.As they waited for the red light to turn green, Lin Rong happened to see them eating the fruit. \u201cLe Le prepared that. Look at how attentive he was, he even removed the grape seeds.\u201dSong Yu ate a grape \u2014 it was very sweet. Yue Zhishi also held onto another small fork, piercing a piece of mango and stuffing it into his mouth. He then speared a piece of lychee, leaned forward and sent it to Lin Rong\u2019s mouth.The three of them shared the little box of fruit, with Yue Zhishi eating the most to the point he started to worry about his appetite when they finally sat down in the restaurant. Song Jin arrived as the first courses of entrees were being served, his button up shirt slightly damp and him looking like he\u2019d rushed over. Lin Rong kindly took out a silk handkerchief from her bag for him to use.When the crayfish arrived, Yue Zhishi abruptly remembered \u2014 they had also eaten crayfish when gege finished his high school exams. He felt something like a sense of ritual, and this made him feel slightly better.He was looking forward to Song Yu peeling the crayfish for him like he did three years ago, but because the motherly figure of Lin Rong was there, there was no problem at all with Yue Zhishi\u2019s supply of crayfish meat. It didn\u2019t need to wait for Song Yu\u2019s peeled crayfish.Everyone wasn\u2019t too worried about Song Yu\u2019s grades. They enthusiastically planned their upcoming family holiday after Yue Zhishi\u2019s high school exams, with Song Jin suggesting a trip to Europe while Lin Rong preferred Egypt. The two of them listed out the advantages for their respective choices for Song Yu to decide, but he said he wanted to go to Japan.Yue Zhishi stuffed a grape tomato into his mouth, the juice exploding in his mouth after he bit into it. His entire being felt like that after hearing Song Yu\u2019s suggestion.He repeatedly nodded, swallowing the tomato. \u201cI want to go to Japan too. I want to go to Akihabara.\u201dWhat cultural heritage, what beautiful scenery \u2014 they all failed in the face of the Song family\u2019s two youngest members\u2019 wishes. Having decided on the location, Song Jin called his assistant to book travel tickets and hotel reservations. The entire family hotly discussed the upcoming itinerary, and only Song Yu, who\u2019d proposed the country, kept silent.They didn\u2019t stay outside too long after finishing their food, since Yue Zhishi still needed to continue his studies. After returning home, Yue Zhishi reviewed his wrong answers until midnight. He was slightly dozing off when his phone vibrated twice, startling him awake, and he glanced at it to see a message from Jiang Yufan asking him how to do a particular question.Yue Zhishi had coincidentally just reviewed a similar question, so he very quickly flipped to the wrong question and took a photo of it before sending it across.The group chat for their class was always very lively. Yue Zhishi had never participated in it, but he\u00a0 pressed it open as he left his chat with Jiang Yufan. He scrolled through the chat history and realised everyone was kicking up a fuss \u2014 a girl from class 7 had gifted her name badge to a boy in their class. Someone had seen it and started joking about it in the group chat, saying that boy was no longer single.[I heard you two grew up together? Lived right across from each other?][This is completely like a fictional plot][When can I start a sweet, sweet early dating relationship\u2026]Yue Zhishi was a bit confused, so he exited the chat to ask Jiang Yufan.[Le Le: What does giving a name badge mean?]Jiang Yufan hadn\u2019t immediately replied when he\u2019d sent over the question earlier, so Yue Zhishi had thought he\u2019d fallen asleep. He didn\u2019t expect Jiang Yufan to reply so excitedly at this topic.[Fan Zi: Isn\u2019t your name on the name badge? In our school, from a very long time ago, giving away your name badge to someone else at graduation meant that person\u2019s very important to you. People might also ask for other people\u2019s badges, and it\u2019s a good sign if they can get it. If the other person refuses to give away their badge, then that means \u201cI don\u2019t like you at all.\u201d]So Peiya had a tradition like this. Yue Zhishi stared at his phone screen for a while and then asked a question Jiang Yufan found really strange.[Can guys give their badges to other guys?]A moment later, Jiang Yufan replied, [There\u2019s no rule saying you can\u2019t. What, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to give it to me, don\u2019t give me something so precious. A basketball\u2019s enough.]Yue Zhishi was amused and responded with a sticker.He was still a bit sleepy. He wanted to drink something cold, so he went downstairs by himself.It was very late, downstairs completely pitch black. Too lazy to turn on the lights, he stuck to the walls and groped his way into the kitchen to open the fridge, grabbing out some iced kiwi juice. He drank a cup of the sour juice, the chill shocking awake his brain. He poured another cup and went back upstairs with it in his hand.Song Yu\u2019s door was always tightly shut, but it was slightly cracked open today, revealing a glimmer of light from inside. Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but draw closer, doing something out of his own expectations.\u201cYou\u2019re still not asleep?\u201dSong Yu lifted his head and looked at his door when he heard Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice. He saw Yue Zhishi wear a large, cream blue t-shirt and a pair of white shorts, standing at the door holding a glass cup.\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you gone to bed?\u201d Song Yu asked him the same question in return. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to school tomorrow?\u201d\u201cI was just doing some review. Would you like some juice?\u201dNot hearing a refusal, Yue Zhishi went inside. Song Yu was lying on his bed, watching a new documentary. It looked very old, a foreigner wrapped in heavy clothes standing at the foot of a snowy mountain as he explained something. That area looked very cold, just like this room with the air-conditioning set to a very low temperature.Song Yu didn\u2019t directly drink the juice after he took it. He placed the cup onto the drawer next to the bed. All the lights in his room were already turned off, with only the projector\u2019s coldly bluish grey light shining in the room. The light fell onto Song Yu\u2019s face and turned his features even handsomer.Yue Zhishi yawned, Song Yu shooing him back to his room, but he sat onto Song Yu\u2019s bed and took off his slippers. \u201cI want to watch this for a while.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t like it,\u201d Song Yu very directly, very coolly said.\u201cI\u2019ll like it.\u201dIf you like it, then I\u2019ll like it.Song Yu\u2019s bed was always neatly arranged, the dark grey, striped bedsheets consistently looking cool and not particularly warm. But once they were messed up, the bed quilt pushed aside, his bed became exceptionally soft and comfortable looking.Yue Zhishi initially just sat on the side of the bed, but then he later placed his legs on top. A little while later again, Song Yu didn\u2019t even know how, but he\u2019d moved to rest next to him, even carefully covering his own stomach with a corner of the blanket.Song Yu wanted to ask why he lay down, but Yue Zhishi turned his face to him, the bridge of his nose and his eyelashes shimmering under the light of the projector. He very softly asked, \u201cCan you give me a pillow to lie on? Gege.\u201dHe always said gege with a voice much softer than his usual voice. He was clearly a boy who\u2019d already changed his voice, but sometimes, his tone would sound a little bit childlike.Song Yu gave him a pillow, but told him he must go back to his room to sleep after ten minutes.Yue Zhishi agreed very readily and then started to earnestly watch the film. In a little while, he asked which mountain is this, and then in a little more while, he asked why are they climbing towards the top of the mountain, are they trying to survey something? As soon as he started asking more questions, Song Yu felt he was purposefully trying to distract him from remembering the time.But he wouldn\u2019t be fooled.\u201cYou ask a lot of questions.\u201dYue Zhishi paused, his eyes focused on the scene in front of him, and slowly blinked before he burrowed his entire person into the blanket until only a pair of eyes could be seen.Song Yu knew he was about to start trying to be sneaky, so he started planning on throwing him out of his room. But before he could start scolding, Yue Zhishi explained in a muffled voice, \u201cYour aircon\u2019s too low.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t be cold if you go back to your room.\u201d\u201cWhy are you always trying to get rid of me?\u201d Yue Zhishi curiously raised his head to look at him, his gaze innocent. He simply wanted to know the answer.Song Yu hesitated. \u201cBecause I like being by myself.\u201dYue Zhishi no longer spoke \u2014 he felt like Song Yu was lying. No one liked being alone. Even if they did, it would only be temporarily.Maybe it was because he had yet to find the someone he liked to have around. If that person appeared, he probably wouldn\u2019t be like this \u2014 he would smile, would look forward to that person staying beside him and would even give the things he considered important to her.Like that name badge.Yue Zhishi thought about Jiang Yufan\u2019s words, and some strange emotions stirred in his heart. Recently, those emotions kept rising in his heart, making him feel uncomfortable. He tilted his head and coincidentally saw a metal name badge placed on the bedside table, and it glowed underneath the projector\u2019s luminous ray of light.\u201cGege.\u201d Yue Zhishi took that name badge and held it in the palm of his hand. \u201cCan you give this to me?\u201dSong Yu frowned. \u201cWhy do you want mine?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you have two?\u201d Yue Zhishi tightly held onto it, widening his eyes in plea. \u201cGive me one, as a memento.\u201dIn Song Yu\u2019s eyes, Yue Zhishi currently looked exactly like he was asking for a little dolphin pendant at the aquarium, a toy from the set meal at McDonald\u2019s or to collect cards as he played games. There was no difference.Turning his face away, Song Yu set the air-conditioning a bit higher and brought his attention back to the documentary.\u201cUp to you.\u201dHow careless. Yue Zhishi thought \u2014 he so easily gave away something other people found precious.Yue Zhishi lowered his head to look at the badge resting in his palm and found himself very lucky. If he\u2019d looked for him a bit later asking for the badge, this tiny little thing might\u2019ve already been carelessly given away by Song Yu, especially since so many people liked him.But when he imagined someone else keeping this name badge, Yue Zhishi once again appreciated Song Yu\u2019s carelessness.He hadn\u2019t needed to beg for it for too long.The memento was like a pacifier: the little child was much more peaceful after getting it no matter if they were in the aquarium or in bed. After giving him the badge, Song Yu was able to peacefully finish his documentary episode.When the next episode was about to start, his attention turned to the person next to him, and he realised Yue Zhishi was actually asleep. His head was askew, curly hair messy and lips in a slight pout \u2014 he looked truly tired. His chest lightly rose up and down, and yet his hand was clenched around that name badge.Song Yu tried calling him awake to get him to go back to his room, but it was useless. Calling him awake with a louder voice or forcefully pushing awake felt very cruel, so he gave up and didn\u2019t do anything else.His phone vibrated as Qin Yan sent him a message. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t wake up, but he subtly shifted. Song Yu very quickly took up his phone, and for the first time, went to read his friend\u2019s messages without a single delay.[Qin Yan: you\u2019re not coming despite us booking out the internet cafe for a whole night, can\u2019t believe you\u2019re not coming out to party after college exams. handsome guy with social anxiety, what are you doing at home.][Qin Yan: don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re sleeping.]The constant vibrations were really annoying, so Song Yu first turned on his phone\u2019s do not disturb mode before replying a single word.[Song Yu: Mn.]He placed his phone to the side and lowered himself down, laying down in bed, but still making sure to keep a distance between him and Yue Zhishi.There was a light smell of kiwi in the blanket, sour yet sweet. Song Yu didn\u2019t drink the juice he\u2019d been given, and yet it felt like he\u2019d already tasted it.Dawn was just breaking when Yue Zhishi woke up. He felt he was in a strange place, and yet it was very comfortable \u2014 he slightly opened his eyes and realised he was sleeping while hugging Song Yu\u2019s back, his arms wrapped around Song Yu\u2019s lean waist and cheek resting against his shoulder blades.They were both lying on their sides like two bananas that\u2019d been broken away, tightly clinging to each other.Yue Zhishi\u2019s heartbeats suddenly sped up. He took back his hands, forgetting to worry about whether he\u2019d wake Song Yu up. His movements weren\u2019t small, and Song Yu ended up moving.He didn\u2019t wake up, but he flipped his body over and pulled into his arms the Yue Zhishi whose heart was beating too quickly. He hugged him as naturally and easily as if he was wrapping his arms around a pillow.The shape of their bodies fit together just right. Yue Zhishi\u2019s cheek snuggled into Song Yu\u2019s neck, and their bodies were twined together. His heart violently jumped, as if it wanted to burst through his chest and jump into Song Yu\u2019s chest which was very close by.The projector hadn\u2019t been turned off the entire night, the documentary unexpectedly that long.Just like the flow of time at this current moment.The school asked the high school year three students to return to school and clean their desks the day after college exams finished. Song Yu\u2019s alarm was the same as before the exams, ringing at 6am. He peeled open his eyes and turned it off with some difficulty, his bed empty. He\u2019d initially wanted to continue sleeping for a bit, but he thought for a while and forced himself to get out of bed.The projector was turned off, and the full cup of juice sitting on the nearby drawer had also disappeared without leaving behind a single trace.He was bent over folding the blanket when something fell out and hit the floor. Song Yu glanced at\u00a0 \u2014 it was his name badge, so he bent over again to pick it up.He said all the right things when he wanted it, and yet he didn\u2019t look after it after he got it.The door was abruptly shoved open, and a flustered Yue Zhishi came in, looking like he was in a very big hurry. He swallowed and said, \u201cI, I left something.\u201dSong Yu pretended to not know anything, turning around and asking, \u201cWhat?\u201dYue Zhishi really was in a rush. He dashed straight to the bed Song Yu had just made, and even though he made it very messy, Song Yu was unusually calm and not even the slightest bit angry. He actually felt a little bit pleased. He waited until he realised Yue Zhishi was truly panicking, and then he held it out. \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201dYue Zhishi very obviously relaxed after looking into the palm of Song Yu\u2019s hand. He took the item back.\u201cYou lost it so quickly. Looks like you didn\u2019t really need it.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t want Song Yu to know how agitated he\u2019d been when he slipped out earlier, so he \u00a0 tranquilly accepted Song Yu\u2019s sarcastic remark. He very obediently said, \u201cI won\u2019t lose it again.\u201d In order to prove himself, he immediately pinned the badge onto his uniform, right next to his own, and then flew out the door to head to his morning self study session.Song Yu turned around, stared at the bed Yue Zhishi messed up, and after looking at it for a while, decided not to make it again. He went downstairs for breakfast.Lin Rong made kiwi juice again, and thinking Song Yu might not like it, didn\u2019t pour him a cup. She didn\u2019t expect Song Yu to ask for it out of his volition and even drink an extra serving.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty nice.\u201d Song Yu praised Lin Rong\u2019s handmade drinks for the first time, and this made her particularly happy.The high school year students returned back to school with an air of relaxation that infected even the security guards at the school entrance. Those who used to make things difficult for students looked kind and amiable today. \u2018We\u2019ve graduated\u2019 was scrawled on the blackboard in the classroom, and Song Yu took a brief look at it when he entered the room, the reality of it not yet hitting him.The classroom was very rowdy, all of his surrounding classmates animatedly planning their holidays. The class monitor, holding the class roster, went around and got everyone to separately confirm whether they were attending the gratitude dinner party for their teachers. In order to reduce the workload of the cleaning staff, the school had strongly prohibited the celebratory tearing of books a long time ago \u2014 even though in reality, there weren\u2019t that many students who truly did want to shred their books.Many people immediately took all their books and started to sell them.The bags of books they lugged out one by one were the heavy, yet youthful hearts they\u2019d strained for so many days.Qin Yan had arrived earlier and had pretty much finished clearing all of his things. He nonchalantly grabbed a chair and sat next to Song Yu. \u201cI\u2019ll help you?\u201dSong Yu shook his head, saying he was fine.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you let auntie come with you? My dad just left with all my stuff.\u201d Qin Yan held onto Song Yu\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat a good friend I am to stay back with you.\u201dSong Yu was too lazy to put on a comedic show with him and silently packed away his study materials. There was some noise at the classroom door, and Qin Yan bumped Song Yu\u2019s shoulder once, hinting at him to raise his head. Song Yu drew his eyebrows together when he saw quite a few girls with one leading the way. The rest of the girls followed her in.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty lady.\u201dSong Yu looked at Qin Yan. \u201cWhere.\u201dQin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe girl right in the centre was very beautiful. She had a heavy sweep of long, jet-black hair and was slightly shy. The rest of the girls surrounding her almost had to push her in with them. Qin Yan whispered she was the year flower in high school year two. Song Yu knew nothing about year two, let alone who the year flower was, and only thought she looked just like Qin Yan\u2019s type.That morning as soon as he arrived at school, even before he\u2019d gone up to his classroom, Song Yu had already been intercepted by a girl with a ponytail. She smiled very brightly and very confidently and had said lines similar to those in a campus romance drama. Song Yu kept his distance and listened to it all, before he rejected her graduation gift and confession.She\u2019d fairly stubbornly asked the reason for his refusal, but Song Yu had said there was no real reason and continued upstairs.But after he managed to escape from her, he\u2019d paused at the entry to the third floor corridor, silently standing there for a while.The few girls who\u2019d just came in were even more eye-catching than the one earlier that morning. There were already a lot of people in the classroom packing away their things, and seeing this scene, they all started to follow along and create a fuss.Even though Qin Yan looked a bit scatterbrained, in reality, he was someone who knew what was truly acceptable. He was usually all noisy and disorderly in front of Song Yu, randomly teasing this facially paralysed guy, but at this moment, he didn\u2019t make a single noise, only leaning over to help Song Yu take out his books from inside his desk.\u201cWhat\u2019s this, it\u2019s so big.\u201d Qin Yan forcefully pulled out the handmade sketchbook Song Yu had previously stuffed at the very bottom. He flipped through it. \u201cIt\u2019s just white paper.\u201dSong Yu doubtfully looked at him. At seeing the sketchbook, his first reaction was to grab it back. \u201cYou can\u2019t throw this away.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say I was going to throw it away?\u201d Qin Yan found it strange how tense he was, as if it was something very important. But there was nothing in it at all, not even a name \u2014 it looked brand new.\u201cIs this one of those gravure photo albums? Leather cover too, must\u2019ve been super expensive. Is it\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dClass 9\u2019s year flower was pushed all the way to the front of Song Yu\u2019s desk, an exquisite gift bag from a luxury brand in her hands. It was like Song Yu didn\u2019t hear the commotion at all, focusing exclusively on tidying.The year flower herself didn\u2019t speak. Next to her, her friend spoke first. \u201cSong Yu, our Yaoyao has something to say to you.\u201d She then pushed the girl called Yaoyao again, urging her to speak.At this point, Qin Yan started to feel embarrassed for them.\u201cSenior Song Yu, I\u2019ve liked you for a very long time,\u201d the girl called Yaoyao shyly said. She held out the gift bag in her hands. \u201cI searched for a gift for a very long time, I hope you like it. Before\u2026 before you are still studying for the exams, so I didn\u2019t dare speak out in case I disturbed you. But now that you\u2019re graduating from Peiya, I might not have anymore chances if I don\u2019t say it now.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t reach out and accept the gift. The rest of the classroom was quietly observing and gossiping, and this made her friends very unsatisfied.Yaoyao didn\u2019t really mind. She plucked up her courage and asked again, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, can we give it a try?\u201dSong Yu had tidied up half of his things when he saw a box sitting inside his drawer. It was the box Yue Zhishi had made last time for his hand-painted plaster patches. Compared to the gift bag in the girl\u2019s hands, this box looked much more childish and inexpensive, but Song Yu gazed at it for a very long time.Seeing him in a daze, Yaoyao\u2019s friend picked up the gift bag in her hands and placed it on top of Song Yu\u2019s desk. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it here. It\u2019s fine as long as you\u2019ve given it out, it\u2019s up to him how he wants to deal with it.\u201dQin Yan almost rolled his eyes at her words. She didn\u2019t sound like a pig teammate.But Song Yu remained without any expressions on his face, only separating the box Yue Zhishi made from his other things and placing it into his bag. He didn\u2019t raise his head, but he finally opened his mouth.\u201cI suggest not leaving it on my desk. It might be taken away by the cleaning lady.\u201dThe other girl was clearly made speechless by his words, and traces of humiliation appeared on Yaoyao\u2019s face. But she, as well as every single person who\u2019d confessed to Song Yu, had already long prepared her heart, so she tried again. \u201cSenior.\u201d She looked at the paper box with all of the things Song Yu had cleared away. \u201cAre you taking these away? If possible, can you give me some of your notes? And, your name badge\u2026\u201d\u201cI have a little brother at home.\u201d Song Yu interrupted. He lifted a paper box from the floor, placed it on to his desk and looked at her.\u201cI\u2019m leaving all of my things to him.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He returned back home for dinner, and when he had nothing to do at night, he would play games in his room. He didn\u2019t live at all like an eighteen year old boy.A fifteen year old boy\u2019s interests and hobbies clearly ranged much wider, but Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t have the time to enjoy his life, his time all squeezed into studying. The high school entrance exams were inching closer, and the usually calm Yue Zhishi was also caught into everyone else\u2019s tension and nervousness.The Song family was much more nervous about his entrance exams than compared to Song Yu\u2019s exams. In order to send him off well, a few days before the actual exams, Lin Rong familiarised herself with the way to the exam centre and plotted out the food menu for the few days of the exams, worried Yue Zhishi would get an allergic reaction or have an upset stomach.Song Yu grudgingly finished all the food as Lin Rong experimented with the menu. His role as her true born son was to be a free lab rat for her younger son, and he wasn\u2019t allowed to resist.The night before his exams, Yue Zhishi was released from school early. Lin Rong gave him a long list of things he needed to double check and told him he needed to follow the checklist one by one after he finished dinner, just in case he forgot to bring something. Yue Zhishi felt they were going a bit overboard, but even Song Jin, who was usually quite relaxed, felt this kind of worry was to be expected.In the entire family, only Song Yu appeared to not care about Yue Zhishi\u2019s exams.This sharp contrast made Yue Zhishi a bit frustrated.He felt like Song Yu didn\u2019t care about him the way Yue Zhishi cared about him.He was shooed upstairs to shower by Lin Rong after dinner. \u201cYou have to sleep early tonight, okay? It\u2019s not a joke if you don\u2019t sleep well.\u201dYue Zhishi stood up, nodding, and prepared to go upstairs when he heard Lin Rong tease Song Yu, \u201cXiao Yu, why are you going to the library every day? You\u2019re not going on a date with a girl you like, right?\u201dSong Yu said with his face devoid of any expression, \u201cYou can follow me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not interesting at all.\u201d Lin Rong placed the bowls and chopsticks into the dishwasher. \u201cI\u2019m just curious, you\u2019re an adult now. You really didn\u2019t like anyone during all those years at school?\u201dSong Yu stayed silent, but his face showed traces of disdain at her curious gossiping.Lin Rong automatically took his silence as denial, so she said, sighing, \u201cYou\u2019re not like me at all. I started liking boys since elementary school.\u201dYue Zhishi dragged his feet up the stairs into his room, the pyjamas Lin Rong had washed for him lying on his bed.He didn\u2019t know why, but the two questions Lin Rong asked Song Yu kept echoing in his head. A bit absentmindedly, he went into the bathroom, took off his clothes and showered, the water running down from his head and wetting his hair and eyelashes. Everything in front of his eyes was hazy \u2014 sometimes it\u2019d be white, sometimes grey, and then he imagined a scene where Song Yu met a girl in the library. The plot he imagined was very standard: the two of them just happened to see each other in between the gaps in a bookshelf, just happened to like the exact same book and then just happened to reach out at the same time to get that book.That kind of plot line seemed to often appear in shoujo manga, but Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t like shoujo.He also didn\u2019t like the girl who impelled Song Yu to go to the library, even if she didn\u2019t exist.This slightly nasty way of thinking had appeared for just one moment when it shattered at the sound of knocking at the door, his thoughts vanishing into thin air. Yue Zhishi wiped his face and turned off the water.\u201cWho\u2019s it?\u201d\u201cMe.\u201d It was Song Yu\u2019s voice. \u201cAre you showering? Then I\u2019ll come back in a bit.\u201d\u201cI just finished!\u201dYue Zhishi swiftly dried off the water on his body and carelessly rubbed his hair a few times. He left the shower area and realised his pyjamas weren\u2019t in the dry zone.He usually placed his clothes on the shelf.Song Yu waited outside. Suddenly, the bathroom door slightly opened, and he thought Yue Zhishi was coming out. But a pale hand, still warm and steamy, extended from the crack in the door. Song Yu couldn\u2019t help but walk over to see what he wanted, and just as he reached the door, Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand grabbed onto the bottom of his shirt.The accuracy of Yue Zhishi\u2019s grab was as if his hand was a robotic hand in a gold mine searching for stones, each lunge heading directly to a piece of gold. He pulled Song Yu\u2019s shirt once, realised it didn\u2019t feel right and immediately let go, hand retreating back behind the door.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cI\u2026..\u201d Yue Zhishi hid behind the crack in the door, showing only his eyes, damp neck and half of his collarbones. \u201cI forgot my clothes. Are they on the rack in front of the door?\u201dSong Yu pulled back his line of sight and slowly looked around him. \u201cNo.\u201dYue Zhishi suddenly remembered. \u201cThey\u2019re on my bed! Can you help me get them, gege?\u201dSong Yu went and grabbed his clothes, and then he stood next to Yue Zhishi\u2019s desk, waiting for him to come out after putting on his clothes.Having just showered, Yue Zhishi\u2019s entire body was emitting soft swirls of steam, his hair still slightly damp. He ran out of the bathroom with bare feet. As he stepped on the floor, he was shorter than Song Yu by only a head, and yet Song Yu always felt there was a natural innocence about him.He knew people usually entered social interactions based on their expectations of others; these expectations were based off what they imagined others to be, meaningless personality traits such as kindness, elegance and candour subjectively endowed upon them.He knew this, and yet he continued to insist that Yue Zhishi was innocent.\u201cAre you looking for me for something?\u201d Yue Zhishi slightly lifted up his face and looked at him. Droplets of water still hung from his lashes like the morning dew hanging on the tips of leaves.Only then did Song Yu remember what he came for \u2014 he walked to the door and brought in the little paper box he\u2019d left outside, placing it onto the floor next to Yue Zhishi. \u201cThese are all things I organised after graduating. There are some notes that might be useful for you to keep.\u201d He then looked down and pulled out two items from his pocket to give to Yue Zhishi. One was the protective talisman Yue Zhishi had prayed for and given to him, and the other was a pen.\u201cThis is the pen I use most. It writes really well, you can bring it as a backup pen.\u201d Song Yu told him to rest early after his simple explanation. He turned around, about to leave, but Yue Zhishi called out to him.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dSong Yu looked over his shoulder. Yue Zhishi was kneeling on the floor, the handmade sketchbook in his hand and head tilted towards him in question.\u201cThat\u2026 I bought it a while ago. I bought it in an accident and haven\u2019t used it.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019d you buy it? The sketch paper is such high quality! Are you really giving it to me?\u201d Yue Zhishi hugged the sketchbook as he stood back up.Song Yu stiffly made a noise in affirmation and then left.Yue Zhishi always felt Song Yu\u2019s behaviour was a bit familiar.He was just like Orange, who would reluctantly grumble and always pretend to dislike being petted despite clearly enjoying it.One of Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand held onto the sketchbook, while his other hand clasped the protective talisman and pen. He looked down \u2014 the front side of the protective talisman looked the same as when he\u2019d initially given it out, but after flipping it over, he noticed a row of words in Song Yu\u2019s neat handwriting.\u201cMay you always be successful,\u201d he softly recited.He\u2019d thought it would be something like\u00a0good luck on your exams.But not only did Song Yu wish for his exams to go well, he hoped for Yue Zhishi to achieve everything he wanted.Holding onto Song Yu\u2019s many little hidden thoughts and prayers, Yue Zhishi fell onto his soft bed, his heart full and content.A small piece of his heart steadied.When it was finally time for his exams, Yue Zhishi was even more relaxed than he imagined he\u2019d be. The exam questions weren\u2019t as complicated as the questions on the mock exams, and even though math was slightly difficult, he progressed very well, the final two major questions similar to those he\u2019d previously completed incorrectly and had been forced to review. Song Yu had also taught him how to do those two questions before, and they\u2019d left a very strong impression on Yue Zhishi.Most importantly, the pen Song Yu gave him played a huge role in his exams. His own pens didn\u2019t work well, the ink not flowing smoothly. They were all newly purchased, so it was highly likely he\u2019d bought a batch of bad quality pens.Luckily, he had Song Yu\u2019s pen.As he finished his exams one after another, Yue Zhishi cheerfully felt he was doing quite well, and when he reached his final exam, he checked over his work again and again until the very last second.The hot sun was high and bright in the sky when Yue Zhishi finally left the exam venue. Lin Rong saw him come out, and she went to walk with him back to the car, shielded by her umbrella.\u201cIt\u2019s hot, isn\u2019t it darling. Quickly head in and cool down.\u201dYue Zhishi opened the car door, not expecting to also see Song Yu. In such a hot day, he wouldn\u2019t have even dreamed of Song Yu coming to pick him up.\u201cSong Yu gege, how come you\u2019re here?\u201dThe tone of his voice exposed his complete and utter delight. Song Jin was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, and he joked, \u201cEverything must be a coincidence today. I was meant to be signing a contract right now, but the other side had something urgent come up and pushed the signing earlier. Xiao Yu also just said something was happening at the library, so he didn\u2019t go this afternoon.\u201dSong Yu, for the first time, decided to explain his actions without being prompted. \u201cRenovation. They\u2019re only allowing people to borrow books.\u201dThis was a fantastic piece of good news to Yue Zhishi, who was never suspicious of good news. But in this case, the good news was followed by a piece of bad news.\u201cWe can\u2019t go to Japan anymore?\u201d Yue Zhishi deflated into his seat. \u201cBut I already had an attack strategy of where to go. \u201dHe\u2019d already planned out the restaurants and official merchandise stores he\u2019d go to together with gege.As well as the Mount Fuji gege would\u2019ve really liked.They all disappeared.Lin Rong leaned back against her seat as listlessly as he did and sighed. \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought there would be a typhoon warning? And for such a long period of time, too.\u201dSong Jin chided them. \u201cSafety comes first, safety comes first.\u201dBecause of the temporary cancellation of their Japan holiday, Yue Zhishi was in low spirits for a while. The third day after finishing his exams, his classmates organised a dinner and karaoke party. Yue Zhishi was originally not interested in going, but Jiang Yufan called him two hours before the planned meeting time.\u201cOne Piece merchandise? The limited edition one? Really?\u201d Yue Zhishi was thrilled and ate a big piece of watermelon, fed by Lin Rong.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go too. Wait for me.\u201d Yue Zhishi hung up the phone and happily ran up the stairs. He carried a basketball when he finally came down \u2014 it was the present he\u2019d prepared a long time ago to gift to Jiang Yufan.\u201cAre you going to play basketball?\u201d Lin Rong asked.\u201cThis is my graduation gift to Jiang Yufan. I\u2019ll give it to him when I see him later at the dinner party.\u201d Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t resist bragging, \u201cJiang Yufan bought me a limited edition piece of merchandise I\u2019ve been wanting for a while. I was planning on buying it myself when we got to Japan.\u201dUsing a spoon, Lin Rong slowly scooped out a large bowl\u2019s worth of watermelon flesh. \u201cThat\u2019s so nice of him. You should invite Xiao Fan over for dinner soon.\u201dSong Yu came out of his room half an hour after Yue Zhishi left. Lin Rong was about to carry up the now cooled watermelon to give to him, and the two of them saw each other at the stairs.\u201cJust in time. Come down and have some watermelon.\u201d Lin Rong pulled him to the dining room and started to scold him. \u201cYou\u2019re always hiding in your room every day. Look, even your brother\u2019s gone out to his classmates\u2019 dinner party.\u201dSong Yu raised his head, glancing at the time. \u201cDinner party? Where?\u201dEvery time he left the house, Yue Zhishi would report when and where he was going to his family, and this time was no exception. Lin Rong told Song Yu the location, and Song Yu\u2019s only thought was that it sounded a bit familiar.The dinner party was held at a 24 hour karaoke bar with a dinner buffet. Yue Zhishi arrived later than most people, and by then, everyone had already started to freely eat and drink.\u201cLe Le\u2019s here!\u201d\u201cLe Le come here, sit over here.\u201dThe majority of junior high boys and girls matured early these days \u2014 even though they were in an enormous room, everyone sat apart, the girls clustered together with their friends and the boys crowded into the corners. The room was a bit dim, the light not quite enough, and Yue Zhishi carefully walked into the room to meet up with Jiang Yufan.Seeing Yue Zhishi truly carrying a basketball, Jiang Yufan felt everything was worth it and pulled Yue Zhishi next to him to give him his present. The surrounding male classmates looked on and were highly envious.\u201cYour relationship\u2019s so good.\u201d\u201cThis basketball\u2019s not bad, let\u2019s go play some rounds after this.\u201dYue Zhishi actually didn\u2019t really like places like karaoke bars. They tended to be very noisy, and whenever parties were held in one of them, everyone tended to turn rowdy and make jokes Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t enjoy once enough people arrived. But Jiang Yufan was also there, and his new merchandise was truly very well-made. Using the light from the big karaoke machine screen, Yue Zhishi earnestly inspected his new gift, to the point he didn\u2019t hear Jiang Yufan tell him he was going to the toilet.There were two, three boys in their class who had matured very early, each of them dating, smoking and getting into fights. They couldn\u2019t be more familiar with karaoke bars. Yue Zhishi was a bit hungry, so he ate a piece of apple from Jiang Yufan\u2019s food tray. He\u2019d just chewed twice when he saw those boys heading towards him.\u201cLe Le, you\u2019ve arrived. How come you\u2019re not singing?\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head, vaguely explaining he wasn\u2019t a good singer. The boys were all holding cups, and they jostled aside the people sitting next to Yue Zhishi before sitting down. One of them was even holding a cigarette, a red dot clearly burning in the dim room.Yue Zhishi\u2019s throat itched from the smell of cigarette smoke. He tried to cough and clear his throat, but his throat remained uncomfortable.\u201cThe smell of my cigarette must be choking you.\u201d The smoking classmate extinguished his cigarette by stubbing the head into the table. He then clapped his hands together. \u201cLook, your face is all red from coughing.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s throat was still itchy, so he wanted to drink some water. There were many cups on the table, and they all looked exactly the same. He grabbed the cup closest to Jiang Yufan\u2019s food tray, and after drinking a mouthful, realised it wasn\u2019t what he expected. It tasted of alcohol.\u201cThat\u2019s my beer.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Yue Zhishi hurriedly put the cup down, coughing a few times. \u201cYou\u2019re not of age yet, you can\u2019t drink alcohol.\u201dThey all started laughing. Yue Zhishi could tell he was once again being mocked. The boy on his right said, still laughing, \u201cLe Le\u2019s a good child. Don\u2019t smoke or drink in front of him, or else you\u2019ll look like a delinquent.\u201d\u201cHow am I a delinquent, I haven\u2019t even taught him how to do bad things yet. Aren\u2019t you blaming me too early?\u201d\u201cYou can teach him how to jack off.\u201dAs soon as those words left the boy\u2019s mouth, all of the boys surrounding them loudly cracked up. Only Yue Zhishi sat there in confusion \u2014 he didn\u2019t understand what had happened and innocently asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s jacking off?\u201dEveryone knew Yue Zhishi was a late bloomer, his natural personality innocent and childish, but no one expected he was innocent to such an extent.\u201cShit, we\u2019re about to start high school. How can you not know what that is!\u201d\u201cThis is too funny. How can there be a guy who doesn\u2019t know what jacking off is?\u201dYue Zhishi was a bit unhappy over how much fuss they were making, feeling as if they were looking at him like he was an idiot. He grabbed out his phone. \u201cI\u2019ll just look it up.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d The boy who was previously smoking grabbed his wrist. \u201cSince we\u2019re bored and have nothing to do, why don\u2019t we give you some sexual education.\u201dJust like that, Yue Zhishi was kidnapped and brought away.They went into an empty room, and the so called sexual education was a boy bringing up a precious, indescribable website as the rest of the boys crowded around him.\u201cThis one\u2019s good. Her body\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201cYou little shit, your saved bookmarks are some good stuff.\u201dYue Zhishi was watching along, very sincerely hoping to learn, when he realised the reactions of these guys were overly excited \u2014 but the sexually explicit images still gave him a strong visual impact.The smoker smacked Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder and purposefully teased, \u201cDo you find this stimulating?\u201dYue Zhishi honestly replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cEven this isn\u2019t stimulating enough?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIs there something wrong with you?\u201dHe reached out, wanting to touch Yue Zhishi\u2019s bottom half. Yue Zhishi was startled enough that he fell to the right, and in all the confusion, someone\u2019s hand accidentally pressed onto an advertisement. The currently playing video was immediately replaced by another scene, a huge video advertisement playing on the entire screen.\u201cHoly shit, who pressed this?\u201d\u201cLu Zi, are you a pervert, trying to watch this? I have to stay away from you.\u201d\u201cFuck, it really wasn\u2019t me. I don\u2019t know how it turned to this.\u201dThe cell phone screen distracted everyone\u2019s attention. Having gotten some space, Yue Zhishi propped himself up on the sofa, getting a glance at the content playing on the screen. Honestly, the two videos weren\u2019t all that much different. The only difference was that the previous female role was replaced by a man who was very skinny, very pale and didn\u2019t resist.Yue Zhishi\u2019s heartbeat abruptly, rapidly increased. It felt like his face was being pricked by many needles, his whole body electrified.\u201cI\u2019m going to die laughing, straight men must fuck other men!\u201d\u201cHurry up and go back. I\u2019m all soft now, fuck.\u201dThey all turned away, but the scene stubbornly remained. Yue Zhishi was suddenly hit by a violent coughing fit, his face turning completely red from his coughs. It felt like the little bit of alcohol he\u2019d just drunk was burning its way down his throat, heating up his entire body.He pushed away the classmates who\u2019d come up to help him and escaped from the sleazy and unpleasant little room.It was such a little bit of beer; it shouldn\u2019t have created such a strong allergic reaction. But he truly was feeling hot, feeling there wasn\u2019t enough air \u2014 so he followed the corridor and ran outside, ran downstairs until he reached the entrance of the karaoke bar. He wanted to breathe some fresh air.He didn\u2019t expect to see Song Yu\u2019s figure at the door, standing next to a stopped black car.Yue Zhishi thought he was hallucinating, but at that moment, a window on the second floor was pushed open. Qin Yan\u2019s voice came out. \u201cSong Yu, are you still not coming back up? There\u2019s no point in you being down there. It\u2019ll still smell like smoke after you come back.\u201dSong Yu looked up, but the first thing he saw was Yue Zhishi standing at the door. He told Qin Yan he wouldn\u2019t be coming up for a while and then walked over to Yue Zhishi.\u201cHow come you\u2019re here?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked, standing on final step in front of the door. Song Yu reached him, and because of the step, for the first time, they met each other face to face, eye to eye, without any height difference.\u201cSame as you guys. Group activity.\u201dSong Yu noticed Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t look quite right. With his two hands in his pocket, he leaned forward, face drawing closer as he intently observed him.The distance between the tips of their two noses suddenly shrank. Song Yu\u2019s body emitted a very pleasant smell \u2014 the familiar body wash fragrance was mixed with the smell of menthol cigarette smoke that had yet to disappear.At such a close distance, Yue Zhishi\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple moved up and down. He forced himself to not overthink.\u201cYour face is so red. What have you been doing?\u201dThe author has something to say:Gege didn\u2019t smoke, other people were smoking and he didn\u2019t want to bring the smoke back to Le Le.Le Le\u2019s classmates don\u2019t know what he\u2019s allergic to \u2014 they didn\u2019t mean for him to drink alcohol on purpose. It was such a small sip, no need to worry.I suggest for everyone to read my new novel without comparing it to my other ones (and in the future as well), because I want to always be improving and trying new things. To say it differently \u2014 things I\u2019ve written before I won\u2019t write again. There are so many topics and styles I want to try. Every time I start a new novel, I always have to go through people comparing my new work with my old, and even though I haven\u2019t written all that many, it\u2019s already become a bad habit hhhhI\u2019m still going to say the same thing as usual \u2014 read the novel you prefer. There\u2019s not much point in comparing. Even if you say my previous novel was better, I still won\u2019t write something similar again.I initially started writing this slice of life novel to adjust myself, because I\u2019m planning on writing a novel focused more on plot next. I wanted to switch things up with a healing slice of life (and another reason was because I wanted to read about childhood sweethearts myself but there were too little options, I had to write it myself hhh). I didn\u2019t expect to find slice of life so hard to write when I was stockpiling chapters. I couldn\u2019t add in too much drama plot points, and I needed to make the lives in the novel read like \u2018real life\u2019, like I was truly showing you moments in their lives. I also needed to establish my characters in such a calm story environment, so as I continued to write, there had to be a dramatic change in my writing style. I want to see myself change; I always want to leave myself with room for improvement.So it was very clear, a slice of life novel needed a realistic writing style. It\u2019s not right to have vast, dramatic romance moments or unrestrained fantastical moments in a novel like this. There are many glittering pieces of joy in the small lives of every day people \u2014 life may be ordinary, but as two people grow up together, the tiny details of their journey are also very beautiful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36: The Awakening of FeelingsThey were too close.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t get the chance to answer Song Yu\u2019s question when guilt and panic pulled his body into retreating, and he stumbled over the higher step behind him, his entire body falling backwards.But Song Yu reached out, grabbed his arm and tugged him forward before he could fall. Yue Zhishi was like a wobbly toy without any free will, tilting to and fro, before he finally fell headlong into Song Yu\u2019s arms.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Song Yu asked, frowning.Yue Zhishi extracted himself from his arms without thanking him at all, and then retreated a few times to stand on an even higher step. He spoke a bit unsteadily. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dSong Yu stood in place, gazing steadily at him as if he was trying to decide whether he was speaking the truth.Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t acting like he normally did at all. He had no way to explain to his gege why he was acting so differently, so he simply gave up and crouched down. He hid his face in his knees and used another reason to cover up his peculiar behaviour. \u201cI accidentally drank a little bit of someone else\u2019s beer. I feel a bit sick.\u201dHearing this, much of the suspicion still lingering in Song Yu\u2019s heart disappeared. He crouched down as well and took Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrist, flipping it over to check if he had any rashes \u2014 none. If Yue Zhishi said it was an accident, then Song Yu would never think otherwise.\u201cHow much did you drink?\u201dStill keeping his face buried in his knees, Yue Zhishi shook his head. \u201cNot much, just a sip.\u201dThe wrist Song Yu was holding felt like it was burning, the heat creeping up his arm and into his chest like a snake. A light layer of sweat appeared on his back. He wanted to pull his arm away, but he also wanted to stay in this same position, wanted to continue being held like this \u2014 he even wanted to be hugged again like before.Having all these contradictory feelings felt too strange. But when he thought about what he\u2019d just seen in the karaoke bar, Yue Zhishi subconsciously started to panic.A certain kind of possibility for himself he\u2019d never thought of extended in front of his eyes, and that possibility was something completely different from everyone else. It was an untimely thought, but he thought of the reactions of all the other boys after they saw the two men together \u2014 all of them, without even thinking about it, openly mocked and ridiculed the video without the slightest hint of trying to cover up their distaste.Only he was different.Why couldn\u2019t he laugh about it?\u201cGo home.\u201d Song Yu released his wrist and patted his hand. \u201cTake some allergy meds later.\u201dYue Zhishi raised his head, his face now even redder after stuffing it into his knees. \u201cAre you going home too?\u201dSong Yu nodded at him. \u201cIt\u2019s quite boring.\u201d\u201cThen why\u2019d you come?\u201dThe look on Song Yu\u2019s face slightly shifted. When faced with Yue Zhishi\u2019s uninhibited and straight-forward questions, he\u2019d learned a very long time ago how to change the topic. He stood up by himself. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Without hesitating, Yue Zhishi stood up as well, but then he remembered his merchandise was still on the table in the karaoke bar. He told Song Yu he was going to go back and get it.Song Yu didn\u2019t say anything, only wordlessly following behind him. The large room for the junior high year three students was at the very end of the first floor, while the high school year three\u2019s room was on the second floor. Song Yu initially hadn\u2019t wanted to go in, but when he thought about the beer Yue Zhishi had accidentally drank, he guessed there should be some students who didn\u2019t really follow rules. He decided to go in with Yue Zhishi.As expected, Yue Zhishi caught even more attention when he returned bringing his older brother. The atmosphere in the karaoke bar was obviously very different compared to school, and everyone kicked up a fuss with even more enthusiasm.\u201cYo, Le Le, your brother\u2019s here to take you home?\u201d\u201cYour family\u2019s so strict.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s face stayed icily still, and he didn\u2019t say a single thing. Yue Zhishi noticed the boys who\u2019d pulled him to watch the video earlier had now returned to this room, and they were now busy singing. He was a bit afraid of being caught by them again, so he rushed to the corner he\u2019d sat in earlier.Jiang Yufan was still sitting there, playing a video game with someone, and he looked up at him just as Yue Zhishi arrived. \u201cHey, you\u2019re back. They said you went to the toilet.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going home now, my ge\u2019s here.\u201d Yue Zhishi grabbed his merchandise. \u201cYou should go home soon too.\u201dJiang Yufan nodded a few times. \u201cI\u2019ll leave after this round. Come out tomorrow for some basketball.\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d Yue Zhishi swiftly ran away, worried Song Yu would feel uncomfortable staying here for too long and worried those boys would catch him to do some weird things again.Song Yu left the room a bit earlier than he did, his phone vibrating.[Qin Yan: handsome guy are you coming back?]Head lowered, Song Yu typed a reply.[SYU: I\u2019m going home.][Qin Yan: ?? you\u2019re too funny, you didn\u2019t want to come earlier but then you suddenly changed your mind. and then you ran out after staying just for a little bit without singing a single song. while other people are the kings of karaoke, you are the king of standing people up]That joke wasn\u2019t really all that funny. Song Yu didn\u2019t smile, and for a moment, he also didn\u2019t know how to respond.He too felt his desire to protect was too intense.Yue Zhishi came out holding his beloved merchandise and walked towards the bus station with Song Yu. He discovered that many things were like when you couldn\u2019t sleep and lay in bed counting sheep \u2014 the more you counted, the more you couldn\u2019t fall asleep. Right now, the more he told himself not to think about it, the more that video flashed in front of his eyes, making him very unsettled.Buses took longer to arrive at night, so they waited, standing shoulder to shoulder. Neither of them said anything, and cars continuously drove past them on the road. Having not eaten dinner, Yue Zhishi\u2019s stomach made a noise, and the air around them turned even more awkward.But Song Yu didn\u2019t think it was strange. He told Yue Zhishi to wait there, and then not long after, he came back with a red bean and matcha daifuku and a small container of ice cream, giving them to Yue Zhishi.The bus arrived. They got on, only a young man wearing earphones sleeping in the back of the bus. The two of them swiped their cards and sat in the very last row of double seats. Yue Zhishi opened the daifuku, swallowing it in two bites, and opened the ice cream to slowly relish it.His attention would always subconsciously shift to his food whenever he ate.Song Yu held onto his merchandise for him and looked at it for a little bit. \u201cYou went to the dinner party for this?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t try to pretend at all, even saying this was his most desired piece of merchandise. \u201cActually there was a Naruto one too, but it\u2019s been sold out already. I\u2019m going to stalk Xianyu and see how my luck goes.\u201dSong Yu soundlessly sighed, thinking there was an actual possibility of Yue Zhishi one day running off with someone just for a piece of anime merchandise.The ice cream was also matcha-flavoured. Yue Zhishi thought Song Yu might like it, so he scooped up a little bit on his spoon and placed it next to his mouth only for Song Yu to reject it. Yue Zhishi could only finish it all by himself, and he happily put the empty container into the bag from the convenience store. The ice cream lowered the heat in Yue Zhishi\u2019s body, but some peculiar feelings still remained in his heart.He realised he didn\u2019t dare to reflect, to look carefully into what he was feeling \u2014 as if he was afraid he\u2019d learn something.The awakening of adolescence was like a restless wisdom tooth slowly preparing to appear: it was hidden in the deepest part of oneself. That kind of existence was faint at best but impossible to ignore, making you always want to lick it, touch it with your tongue. But there was never any clear response.Anxiety, curiosity, panic, awe \u2014 all these emotions were buried and waiting in dark and soft flesh, and there was no way for you to have any accurate predictions.You wait and look forward to it appearing, and yet you\u2019re also afraid of the aching pain that may arrive at any moment.Song Yu sat next to him, having put on his earphones when Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t paying attention. The bus continued swaying forward, and the handsome side of his face was reflected on the window. When neon lights flashed by and across that reflection, it created an almost unreal sense of beauty.Yue Zhishi gazed at the glass window, and the kind of curiosity a younger person held towards an older person sprouted in his heart.\u201cSong Yu gege.\u201d He leaned his head over.Song Yu took off one of his earphones and met his eyes.\u201cHave you watched those kinds of videos before?\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s face and voice revealed how shy he was at asking this question, but it was like he was worried Song Yu wouldn\u2019t understand what he was saying. He especially clarified, \u201cThe kind that\u2019s not suitable for children.\u201dSong Yu drew his eyebrows together. \u201cWhat are you asking this for?\u201dThis time, Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t distracted by Song Yu\u2019s counter question. He persistently asked, \u201cHave you?\u201dSong Yu stayed quiet for a few seconds, and then he lifted his hand to put his earphone back in, looking like he wasn\u2019t going to answer his question. Yue Zhishi hurriedly pressed down on the hand holding the earphone. \u201cI\u2019m just curious.\u201d\u201cWhy are you curious?\u201d Song Yu stared at him, eyes sharp.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t dodge away from Song Yu\u2019s eyes, but it took him two seconds to open his mouth. \u201cA few boys took me to watch one earlier.\u201dHe was originally a bit scared of how Song Yu would react, but his reaction was much calmer than he imagined. \u201cAnd then?\u201dSong Yu raised an eyebrow, his face still smooth with not much expression. \u201cDid you like it?\u201dYue Zhishi lowered his eyes and mumbled, \u201cIt was okay.\u201d He didn\u2019t dare say what he later saw, only telling Song Yu the first half of what happened. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t see all that clearly. The boys were all crowded together over such a small phone screen, and they were laughing so loudly. They all said the woman\u2019s body was really good, but I couldn\u2019t tell. She was really pale, a foreigner, and the man\u2026\u201d\u201cHe wasn\u2019t good-looking at all. He had a messy beard.\u201d Yue Zhishi flicked his eyes upwards, quickly glancing at Song Yu and looking like a puppy pressed against the corner of a wall after doing something wrong. But the words that came out of his mouth were so direct they could make someone laugh: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t as good-looking as you.\u201dA confused expression appeared on Song Yu\u2019s face. \u201cWhy are you comparing him to me? Do you think I\u2019ll be really happy to hear you say I look better than a porn actor?\u201dYue Zhishi was also a bit uncertain, but he very quickly found a reason. \u201cBecause you\u2019re here. And you really are good-looking.\u201dSong Yu was made speechless by his words. The bus announced the current stop, and as if waking up from a dream, Yue Zhishi pushed his shoulder to get off the bus.\u201cDon\u2019t hang around with those people in the future. You\u2019ll only be led astray,\u201d Song Yu sternly warned him.But even if he didn\u2019t say so, Yue Zhishi already knew this. He may not have been brought up as strictly as under an iron hand, but his upbringing had always guided him towards a good direction, to the point even Yue Zhishi himself didn\u2019t like how it\u2019d felt to be around that group of people.And not only that, he always subconsciously felt that if he really did head down the wrong path, Song Yu might be disgusted by him.As they walked along the street, the summer wind blew towards their faces. There were many busy barbecue shops along the road with their tables scattered outside, one leaning against another. People sat outside and chatted as they ate their late night snacks. Song Yu\u2019s voice was slightly lost in the midst of such a loud environment, but it no longer sounded as stern. \u201cIt\u2019s very normal to start becoming sexually aware. You\u2019ve already grown up.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t know how to continue this conversation, so he didn\u2019t utter a single sound. They walked past the area with all the late night food stalls, and the noise started to quiet down, leaving behind only the chirping of the late night cicadas. Their shadows lengthened under the dim yellow light of the street lamps, stretching until they merged together.With his head down, Yue Zhishi heard Song Yu ask, \u201cYou didn\u2019t feel anything else after watching the video?\u201dHe didn\u2019t know why Song Yu changed the topic again. He resolutely said, \u201cNo.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t insist on asking anything further, and the two of them walked in silence until they reached the lift to their home. Song Yu pressed the button, and as they waited, Song Yu once again quietly said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel ashamed about these things. Even if you felt something or had some sort of reaction while you were watching, it\u2019s all very normal. It\u2019s instinctive for humans to have reproductive desire. You can be curious, and you can actively try to understand it \u2014 as long as you don\u2019t do anything you shouldn\u2019t be doing just because of your curiosity.\u201dIn reality, Song Yu didn\u2019t want to act as a mentor in this area. He forcefully pretended to be indifferent as he took care of this situation \u2014 but it was only because he didn\u2019t want Yue Zhishi to be embarrassed because of it.In reality, he wasn\u2019t too willing to imagine how Yue Zhishi looked like when he watched that video.\u201cSex isn\u2019t shameful. Only when you face it directly can you treat it as it should be treated: correctly.\u201dOn one hand, Song Yu hoped his little brother could properly handle the awakening of his sexual awareness, but on the other hand, he felt as if he didn\u2019t really have the right qualification to lead him. After all, his intentions and thoughts were what everyone considered to be \u2018incorrect\u2019. This kind of contradictory feeling went against all logical thinking, and Song Yu was tired, trapped as he learned how to properly fulfil the responsibilities of an older brother.\u201cIt\u2019s all very normal. No need to be nervous.\u201dThinking how Yue Zhishi could say these things to him without a single shred of worry, Song Yu kept feeling more and more that he should remain in his current position and be a good older brother.Yue Zhishi mulled over Song Yu\u2019s words, and the burden in his heart felt lighter. But the thing he was too embarrassed to say seemed to be two separate things compared to what Song Yu said \u2014 the degree of it was different, and the direction was also different.But maybe it was the same kind of reasoning, he tried to convince himself.But if Song Yu really did learn that he had a stronger reaction to a video with two men in it, would he still be able to say these things to him in such a calm manner?Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t tell.The elevator doors opened, and maybe because of something being transported in the lift earlier, but some dust flew down the moment the doors opened. Yue Zhishi was standing right in front, and he breathed the dust in and was unable to stop from coughing.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Song Yu pressed the button for their floor. He wasn\u2019t as sensitive to smells as Yue Zhishi. He didn\u2019t feel there was anything unusual in the lift, so he unconsciously lowered his head to check if his body still smelled like cigarette smoke. Seeing this, Yue Zhishi shook his head, steadied his breathing, and said to Song Yu, \u201cIt\u2019s not the smell from your body. Some dust just fell down.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s tone sounded a bit unnatural as he realised Yue Zhishi noticed what he was doing. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to smell like smoke. It stinks.\u201d\u201cA little bit. But I don\u2019t know why\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi leaned against the elevator wall. After coughing, his pale face was tinged with red, his eyes slightly wet, and yet his voice and gaze were sincere.\u201cBut if it\u2019s on you, the smoke smells really nice.\u201dThe author has something to say:Le Le, my darling child, you can\u2019t be such a tease\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had been like that since he was young, always able to openly divulge his affection for gege at any time, any place, and never feeling that it was inappropriate to express his feelings.But the current him had slightly changed \u2014 sometimes he hoped gege would be able to give him a bit of a response, even if the response was a decisive rejection like when they were children, telling him, \u201cI don\u2019t like it when you say stuff like that. Don\u2019t do it again.\u201dIf Song Yu didn\u2019t say a single thing, then Yue Zhishi would want to guess. But he didn\u2019t like guessing.He didn\u2019t get an allergic reaction, but he still decided to take an antihistamine just in case. That night, Yue Zhishi found it hard to sleep, tossing and turning until about 2am in the morning before finally falling asleep.He had a very strange dream. He initially lay on a very beautiful meadow, the sky very heavy and clouds very puffy. He reached out a hand, and one dark cloud dropped to press onto his body without leaving any room for him to move. Yue Zhishi immediately had no way to breathe. He tried to break free, and the cloud gathered together and turned into a human figure \u2014 a tall male figure without a face, and yet it felt very familiar.The cloud wrapped very tightly around him, almost completely airtight, and the sexually intimate-like embrace suffocated him. That sense of impending death felt just like an allergic attack, pressing and constricting all of his nerves. But the strange thing was \u2014 in the midst of this struggle for air, he was compelled to feel something wondrous.At the end, the cloud in his dream turned into a pool of hot rainwater without any warning and drenched him completely. At 5am in the morning, Yue Zhishi was shocked awake from his dream.In the many days after, Yue Zhishi kept trying to further understand his feelings through online searches. He didn\u2019t want to keep being caged in between ignorant curiosity and fear, so he read many articles, performed many tests and even watched many movies by himself. Most of them were art films, created very beautifully and were very emotionally affecting \u2014 but Yue Zhishi fell heavier into doubt the more he watched.He looked at photos of many highly attractive men without much feeling. He did tests set by set and didn\u2019t get any clear results: not every test gave him the same result.All of this left Yue Zhishi at a loss.His bewilderment showed quite clearly as he was often lost in thought, frowning. When he watched television dramas with Lin Rong, he\u2019d either stare blankly at the scenes with the male and female leads acting against each other or show a very serious, probing expression as he watched, as if he really needed someone to give him an answer. So on a certain day later, as the entire family spent a day outside, Song Yu looked at Yue Zhishi, who was staring blankly at a field of lotus flowers, and said, \u201cDo you remember your fortune stick?\u201dYue Zhishi looked at him a bit absently, his arms carrying a peaceful Cotton Candy.\u201cLet nature run its course,\u201d Song Yu said.He vaguely felt Song Yu understood and knew why he was feeling so lost. And he\u2019d always relied on Song Yu, never once erecting any barriers between them.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be different from other people.\u201d Yue Zhishi very honestly revealed his thoughts to Song Yu, his hand lightly caressing Cotton Candy\u2019s furry head. \u201cIt\u2019ll be really weird.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dCotton Candy sneaked out and away to Lin Rong\u2019s call.Yue Zhishi sat on the grass next to the lake, grabbed a full lotus pod and started picking out a few tender lotus seeds. \u201cPeople have always given me special attention since I looked different from everyone else when I was young. I don\u2019t want to stand out too much now that I\u2019m older.\u201d He broke off the green shell around a seed, revealing the white and delicate lotus nut inside, and gave it to Song Yu.Song Yu took it but didn\u2019t eat it. He silently felt it was natural for Yue Zhishi to be worried since he was about to start high school and needed to face a new and different social circle. The two of them sat next to each other. It was the end of June, right as the lotus flowers were starting to bloom. The wind blew the lotus leaves until they flipped upside down and covered the newly born, very unsteady flower buds. Song Yu said, in a low voice, \u201cDo you know what the most contradictory thing about humans is?\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head, eyes focused on the side of his face.\u201cIn order to avoid getting hurt, we imitate and copy the way other people live until we\u2019ve changed ourselves to be like them, until we\u2019ve merged into society. This is instinctual for humans to survive in a social setting. Just like the mimicry you see in nature \u2014 in order to protect themselves, animals have evolved to fuse with their environments. It\u2019s safer that way.\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d\u201cBut humans are much more complicated compared to animals.\u201d Song Yu stared out at the lake in the distance. \u201cSometimes, we carry a certain kind of hope. We think we\u2019re not the same as other people, and occasionally, we even want to be a bit more special \u2014 we don\u2019t want to be part of the ordinary and unremarkable majority. So we all fall into an inner struggle with ourselves, struggling to understand the contradiction. And in order to remove the contradiction, we need to give up ourselves.\u201dHe looked at Yue Zhishi as he spoke. \u201cIf you\u2019d rather be part of the multitude of people, then you will need to give up the part of you that\u2019s unwilling to be mediocre.\u201dYue Zhishi was also looking at him, his light-coloured pupils very clear. Under the swaying rays of sunlight, even his dark brown eyelashes were semi-transparent.The kind of hesitation that came from deliberation lay deeply in his eyes.Having finished what he needed to say, Song Yu turned his face away. Song Jin called him from behind, asking him to get new fish bait. Song Yu responded and stood up.He\u2019d taken only two steps when Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but turn around and call out to him.\u201cThen how do you think I should choose?\u201dBehind him, a single flower bud swayed uneasily in the warm breeze.Song Yu stopped walking and turned his body halfway. \u201cYou need to choose for yourself. I can\u2019t give you any helpful suggestions. Because to me, you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201dYue Zhishi frowned in doubt.\u201cYou were special from the moment you were born.\u201d Song Yu raised an eyebrow. \u201cWeren\u2019t you?\u201dThe wind by the lake blew away the wildly growing flowers and plants and also blew away the fog lingering around the wetland park. The round leaves fluttered as they covered the entire surface of the lake, separating and then coming back together, and the pond of lotus flowers changed from scattered little flower buds to flower petals blossomed across the entire lake. The height of summer arrived at the end of August, and everything became bright and luminous.The news of the college entrance examination score release had already entered the hot searches, and even people who hadn\u2019t participated were very nervous. Only Song Yu remained calm and composed, and when he went to check his score, he even looked like he was checking it for someone else, his entire person acting as if this matter had nothing to do with him. It was Yue Zhishi, pulling and pushing, who was anxious on his behalf.His score was as calm as his person. Even his class adviser called and congratulated him, saying he\u2019ll have no problem getting into Tsinghua and giving him many suggestions on where to register for university. After finishing his phone call, the school headmasters called. Song Yu was later too lazy to deal with them and gave them all to Lin Rong, pretending to be ill.Yue Zhishi was one hundred times more overjoyed compared to Song Yu. He was more excited than when he found out his own score was enough to enter Peiya\u2019s advanced class stream. He immediately sent a message to Jiang Yufan to brag, even saying his ge only lost two points in math and stressing the news twice.Song Jin rushed home from his company after learning his son tested well. He said they needed to celebrate, but knowing Song Yu didn\u2019t like to publicise his personal matters, he temporarily didn\u2019t invite guests to a grand celebration. After discussing it with Lin Rong, they decided to throw a private celebration before Song Yu registered for university.\u201cThese are all dishes you guys like, hurry and eat up.\u201d Lin Rong placed a bottle of red wine on top of some ice. \u201cSince we\u2019re celebrating today, we can drink a little bit. Le Le can\u2019t, though.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t mind. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, I like Sprite.\u201dSong Jin stood next to the table, cutting grilled lamb chops while he asked Song Yu, \u201cDidn\u2019t you already choose a school earlier? You\u2019ve kept it to yourself for so long, isn\u2019t it about time you told us?\u201dMore than anyone else, Yue Zhishi cared about Song Yu\u2019s answer. He thought about what Xia Zhixu said a while ago, that they were going to study in Beijing \u2014 he wanted to know if Song Yu would also be going to such a faraway place.If even his class adviser and high school director were urging him, then Song Yu should be going, right?Lin Rong brought out three wine glasses and started to joke, \u201cIf you really are going to Tsinghua or Peking, then we definitely need to invite everyone for dinner. Even though I don\u2019t really want to see sister-in-law and the rest of the family, we still have to follow the rules and invite friends and family\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to Beijing.\u201d Song Yu sat on his chair and was very calm. \u201cI want to register for Wuhan University.\u201d\u201cYour score\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no such thing as a score that requires you to go a particular university, only the field you want to go into and the university you want to attend.\u201dSong Jin clearly hadn\u2019t expected this at all, his face subtly changing because of this unexpected news before he once again displayed his usual understanding. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, as long as you\u2019ve already decided.\u201d\u201cWuhan University is also good.\u201d Lin Rong\u2019s mindset changed very quickly. Tsinghua or Peking would be always be the secret first choice for every parent, but she was also very happy to learn her son was willing to stay in his home city. Plus, Lin Rong knew Song Yu\u2019s personality \u2014 before he announced his choice, he would\u2019ve already gone and planned everything out. She didn\u2019t want to show too much opposition, so she tried to ease the situation by saying, \u201cWuhan U\u2019s close to home, you can come back whenever you want. I think that\u2019s a good choice.\u201dYue Zhishi was secretly very happy, but even he knew how to tailor his behaviour to other people\u2019s reactions. He didn\u2019t say much.\u201cThen have you already thought about what you want to study?\u201d Song Jin asked.\u201cGeomatics,\u201d Song Yu replied. \u201cI\u2019ve already learned a lot about it over the summer vacation. I\u2019ve learned the foundations, and even took the chance to get familiar with some of the relevant software knowledge. It\u2019ll be easier for me later after enrolment.\u201d He looked at Song Jin and added, \u201cWuhan University is the best in this field. Not only is the university ranked number one for this discipline, even their academic resources and the depth of their research are the best. I\u2019ve also considered my academic research plans for the future.\u201dSong Yu had matured much earlier compared to his peers. As his parents, they\u2019d long known this, but Song Jin was still slightly surprised \u2014 he never expected Song Yu to have planned out his future so far ahead.And he never even thought that Song Yu would want to study this field.For a moment, Song Jin couldn\u2019t quite control his facial expressions, and Yue Zhishi noticed it from the corner of his eye.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, that\u2019s all in the future. All that matters is our son\u2019s good score.\u201d Lin Rong urged Song Jin to sit down. \u201cLet\u2019s just celebrate first.\u201dAs he ate, Yue Zhishi asked Song Yu many questions, like what was geomatics, what did it teach, what could he do after graduating. Song Yu gave each of his questions a succinct answer, leaving him with a basic understanding of what geomatics was.\u201cNo wonder.\u201d Yue Zhishi abruptly caught Song Yu\u2019s wrist. \u201cThe drawing you gave me last time.\u201dSong Yu pulled his hand away. \u201cHurry and eat.\u201d\u201cWhat drawing?\u201d Lin Rong chimed in to tease, \u201cYou two have more and more little secrets.\u201d\u201cNot at all, I tell you everything.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. Then tell me if there\u2019s a girl you like.\u201dYue Zhishi dryly laughed. \u201cI really don\u2019t.\u201dEven Song Jin laughed. \u201cHow could a mom be like you, every day trying to gossip with your child to find out if they\u2019re dating.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s completely normal, if he tells me then I can give him hints or ideas.\u201dSong Yu gave Lin Rong a piece of beef. \u201cYou should eat.\u201d\u201cXiao Yu can\u2019t stand me again!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter dinner, Yue Zhishi and Song Yu gave Cotton Candy a shower. When the Pomeranian was dry, he was as woolly and fluffy as a cloud, but once he was soaked in water, his entire body would shrink by half. Cotton Candy didn\u2019t like showering and kept trying to run away, so they needed to have one person hold onto him while the other washed him.Yue Zhishi was more than half-drenched by the time they finished cleaning him halfway. Song Jin appeared in front of the downstairs bathroom door and mildly said, \u201cSong Yu, come out with me.\u201dAfter Song Yu was called away, only Yue Zhishi and Cotton Candy were left in the bathroom. Both of them were wet, and both of them were also very nervous.But Song Yu wasn\u2019t nervous. He\u2019d already expected his father would call him out for a talk and wasn\u2019t surprised. Song Jin held a basketball as they went down and brought his son to the neighbourhood\u2019s basketball court.The two of them played carelessly, one on defence and the other on attack, and would switch roles after landing a basket. Song Yu would always remember \u2014 it was Song Jin who\u2019d taught him how to play basketball when he was a child, telling him this sport not only needed explosive power, it also needed patience and persistence.\u201cIt\u2019s been too long since we played together.\u201d Song Jin stood in the middle of the court. He took a shot, and the ball flew in a parabolic curve until it hit the rim and fell into the net, bouncing on the ground. He shook his head, two hands resting on his hips. \u201cI\u2019m too old now, my body can\u2019t keep up with yours.\u201dSong Yu picked the ball back up and went to the vending machine on the side of the court, buying two bottles of sports drink before giving one to his father. The two of them sat down to rest. Facing the empty basketball court, Song Jin released a sigh. \u201cI still remember when we used to play here together. We\u2019d face off against each other, with you on defence but still really wanting to win. You wanted to steal my ball, but you ended up hitting the ball out in a rush and smacking your brother\u2019s head.\u201dSong Jin laughed out loud as he thought of that memory. \u201cLe Le was so dazed, his butt plonked directly on the ground. He didn\u2019t get up for such a long time, and yet he didn\u2019t cry. He only stared blankly at the ball on the ground.\u201dHe looked at Song Yu. \u201cYou must\u2019ve also been very scared at that time.\u201dSong Yu stayed silent as if in unspoken admission. His memory of that time was already blurry and indistinct, but he could still remember how nervous he was \u2014 and because he had been so nervous, he couldn\u2019t remember how Yue Zhishi reacted.\u201cBut he didn\u2019t really mind. You ran over to him, and he babbled something, maybe for you to carry him \u2014 if you didn\u2019t pick him up, then he wouldn\u2019t get up.\u201d Song Jin smiled. \u201cLe Le\u2019s personality is truly so similar to his dad. He\u2019ll definitely be like your Uncle Yue after he grows up. He may look like he doesn\u2019t understand anything like a child, but for many things, he\u2019s already well aware of what he should do. He just isn\u2019t willing to think too much about them.\u201dSong Yu knew what his father was saying was correct. But unconsciously, he\u2019d always considered Yue Zhishi as a child even though he clearly already knew Yue Zhishi was grown up. He\u2019d even occasionally looked at him like someone he needed to protect, as if he could gain some sort of pleasure from it \u2014 when in reality, he only gained an ever-increasing burden.\u201cTell me your thoughts.\u201d Song Jin knocked his sports drink against the one in Song Yu\u2019s hand. \u201cWhy do you want to study geomatics? It sounds like it should be related to your Uncle Yue.\u201dSong Yu gazed steadily at his father, realising he actually already understood everything.\u201cI feel like Yue Zhishi\u2019s really similar to you too,\u201d Song Yu suddenly said.Song Jin knew he wasn\u2019t trying to change the conversation. He laughed, \u201cHe\u2019s also really similar to your mom. After all, he is a child we raised. But as for you, it\u2019s like you grew up by yourself and don\u2019t really need us.\u201dSong Yu shook his head, denying his father\u2019s words. \u201cI really need you guys. Every single one of you.\u201d It was rare for him to be so honest, but even then it was only just to this point.There was a sudden gust of wind, and the shadows from the surrounding trees rocked in response as the summer cicadas screamed. Song Jin said, \u201cI know you\u2019ve liked geography since you were a child. Maybe it has to do with your Uncle Yue as well. I was too busy running my business, so Yue Yi brought you to many places, climbing mountains and viewing oceans.\u201dHe held onto Song Yu\u2019s shoulder as he spoke. \u201cWhen I think about it, my son\u2019s actually really amazing. You followed him at such a young age and ran around the country to so many different places. You must\u2019ve seen landscapes even many adults haven\u2019t seen.\u201dIn the family, Song Yu was actually the person most unwilling to bring up Yue Yi. To him, Yue Yi was another father figure who\u2019d taken him to see a different world as he emerged from his infancy years.He would always remember Yue Yi standing at the peak of the mountain, shouting out to the surrounding mist and clouds \u2014 shouting that he hoped every single person by his side would be blessed with happiness.That he hoped his future child would also be blessed.Song Jin laughed as he said, \u201cSometimes I would wonder, how would he be like if he was still alive? He was such a chatty person, such a good person. If Le Le had grown up under their care, would he be in better shape than he is now?\u201d He paused, and then continued. \u201cSo your mom and I, we really are trying our best to raise him. We always feel that Yue Yi guy is looking at us from the heavens.\u201dHe looked towards Song Yu. \u201cJust think about how well he treated you when you were a child. If he was still here, just how dearly would he love Le Le?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s nose started to burn. He was a bit resistant to continuing this conversation further, because it felt like he was falling into a contradictory, difficult choice. On the one hand, he was well aware that if this premise was real, Yue Zhishi would definitely be happier. But on the other hand, he couldn\u2019t imagine the existence of a Yue Zhishi in this world who didn\u2019t grow up together with him, a Yue Zhishi who was completely independent from his own life.It was truly scary, Song Yu thought.\u201cMy heart is a bit resistant to hearing that you want to learn geomatics, and that you even want to continue researching into this area.\u201d Song Jin openly said to him what was on his mind. \u201cYou probably guessed it already.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re afraid it\u2019s not safe.\u201d Song Yu knew he would think this way. After all, no matter how advanced modern technology was, to surveying and mapping workers, it was hard to avoid heading out to the wild. It was very likely they would face and be tested by very dangerous terrain.Song Jin dipped his head. \u201cYou\u2019re probably aware that your Uncle Yue\u2019s accident left me with a little bit of a traumatic experience.\u201dHe spoke too subtly. Song Yu knew it wasn\u2019t just a \u2018little bit\u2019.\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Song Yu tried to explain. \u201cNo matter what, there\u2019s still a long time to when I can head out for work. It\u2019s too early to talk about these things. Besides, it\u2019s different doing it for work or doing it as a hobby. The levels of security arrangements are different.\u201dSong Jin knew all this and knew things were no longer the same as the past. It was no longer common to head out to the wild.At the end of the day, it was merely his heart that couldn\u2019t accept it.He patted Song Yu\u2019s knee, sighing. \u201cGo. Even if I\u2019m worried for you, I\u2019ll still support you.\u201d He gave Song Yu a smile. \u201cBut if you could rely on us more in the future, that would be even better.\u201dSong Yu lowered his eyes and nodded.Song Jin\u2019s cellphone rang \u2014 it was his wife rushing them to come home. He stood up and stretched. \u201cLet\u2019s buy some ice cream for your mom.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. You probably don\u2019t know, but it was your Uncle Yue that helped your mom and me get together.\u201dSong Yu actually hadn\u2019t known; no one had mentioned this before. \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYour mom had a good background and was beautiful. There were so many people chasing after her.\u201d Song Jin joked, \u201cAlthough I, your father, also had a beautiful face and a good body, my family background was worse than hers and was even more terrible compared to your Uncle Yue\u2019s. He knew I liked your mom when we were in university, and he knew your mom was also interested in me. I was too embarrassed to chase after her, and Yue Yi kept encouraging us as he ran back and forth between the two of us. It took a lot of effort for us to get together.\u201d\u201cWithout your Uncle Yue, you might not even exist.\u201d Under the street lamps, Song Jin\u2019s smile carried a few measures of nostalgia. His smile gradually faded, and he said some words, full of feeling.\u201cOur large lucky star\u2019s gone, but he left us a little lucky star. Isn\u2019t that good too?\u201dSong Yu watched their shadows on the ground, shrinking and lengthening as they weaved through the tree shadows. He nodded.\u201cMn.\u201dAfter buying some ice cream, Song Jin suddenly needed to take a business phone call before heading up. He gave the convenience store bag to Song Yu and told him to go upstairs first, saying he\u2019ll head up after his call.So Song Yu opened the door of his home by himself, giving to his mom the ice cream his dad had bought for her and refusing to accept her affectionate attacks. He went up the stairs, but as he passed Yue Zhishi\u2019s room, the door to Yue Zhishi\u2019s room abruptly opened and gave him a scare.Yue Zhishi stood in the entrance of his room. \u201cSong Yu gege, are you okay?\u201dSong Yu found his question very random. \u201cDo you need me for something?\u201d He prepared to walk towards his own room, but then Yue Zhishi dragged him into his room and even closed the door.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Before Song Yu could figure out what was happening, Yue Zhishi pushed him against the door. One of Yue Zhishi\u2019s hands pressed on his rib cage, and the other held onto the door handle.\u201cDid Uncle Song just pull you out to scold you?\u201d Yue Zhishi looked into Song Yu\u2019s eyes, his own gaze very certain. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to be too supportive of you going to Wuhan University.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIf you say he didn\u2019t, then he definitely did.\u201d Yue Zhishi thought he already figured out everything that happened. \u201cWhat did Uncle Song say? Did he want you to go to Tsinghua?\u201dHe\u2019d heard Lin Rong talk on the phone with a friend of hers earlier as he was blowdrying Cotton Candy. She had also felt it was a pity Song Yu didn\u2019t want to go to Tsinghua.Everyone said it was fine, he could go anywhere he wanted \u2014 but secretly, they all wanted to urge Song Yu to reconsider.The more he thought about it, the more he felt his thinking was correct. Yue Zhishi released the hand pressing onto Song Yu and pulled open the door, preparing to go downstairs. \u201cLet me talk to Uncle Song for you. I can convince him.\u201dOne leg had just passed the door when Song Yu grabbed and pulled him back. \u201cCome back here.\u201dYue Zhishi faced him, and seeing how Song Yu looked a bit helpless, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cHow come your face looks like you want to laugh without being able to?\u201dHe was surprisingly perceptive this time. Song Yu let go of his hand and said, \u201cWhat do you keep thinking about?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thinking about you.\u201dSong Yu froze for a moment.Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice was too sincere for Song Yu. \u201cWhen you said you wanted to study geomatics at dinner, I felt Uncle Song and Aunt Rong weren\u2019t really supportive. If it were me, and I saw everyone giving me reactions like that, I\u2019d definitely be frustrated. Who wouldn\u2019t want other people to approve the path they want to take?\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d Song Yu gazed at him.He raised his head, eyes firm. \u201cI support you. I support you no matter what. Just then when you were gone, I went and did some research. Wuhan University is the best school for geomatics, and some people even say it\u2019s the best in Asia. Besides, I also know many people don\u2019t know what they want to study after college exams. You\u2019re not like that, you\u2019re already very clear about what you want to do. I\u2019m really happy that you can go to the best, and the most suitable, place to study what you want to study. I don\u2019t want to see you change your mind because of someone else. Because you\u2019re very mature \u2014 you know what you want, right?\u201dYue Zhishi clasped Song Yu\u2019s hand as he spoke. Even though he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d made a mistake in his reasoning, the heart that rushed to convey its support \u2014 Song Yu could feel its heartbeats.\u201cGege, I\u2019m always standing on your side.\u201dIn a daze, Song Yu remembered what had happened at the basketball court when he was a child. He finally remembered what Yue Zhishi had actually said to him after being knocked hard enough that he fell onto the ground.He had been very small, and yet he held back his tears and didn\u2019t cry. He even stretched out his arms and said to him, Xiao Yu gege, you know how to play ball now, you\u2019re so amazing.Can you pick me up?The author has something to say:Big time skip warning (but it\u2019s nothing like having become of age and then getting together immediately, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve only written 150,000 characters hhhh)Song Yu didn\u2019t stay back and choose Wuhan U because of anyone. He has his own desires and has even already considered his future research area. Wuhan U\u2019s geomatics is the strongest in the country (at one point, it was also called Asia\u2019s #1. Everyone can search online how often\u00a0academicians\u00a0teach undergraduates. Tsinghua or Peking shouldn\u2019t be chosen just because they\u2019re Tsinghua/Peking \u2014 you should focus on what you want to do). He considers everything he does, and earlier when he chose to stay in the country, it was also because he already knew what he wanted to study professionally.Gege is a very logical, very mature person who does nothing without thinking over it. And besides, not every main character in a story needs to go to Tsinghua or Peking; just like a commenter said, geomatics belong to Wuhan U and dentistry belongs to Sichuan U. There was some news a while ago about a Yunnan college entrance examinee being admitted into one of Peking\u2019s medical specialities, dentistry related, and then wasn\u2019t satisfied after going there for a while. He chose to take the entrance exams again, got 712 points and registered for Sichuan U. It\u2019s the same kind of logic.And here, to every person preparing for exams and every person who will face the college exams in the future \u2014 I wish that you can all go to the school you want and study the field you want to study~ I support you all~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Song Yu very naturally applied to the university he wanted to attend, and the day the acceptance letter came, the entire family was particularly happy. Since their eldest child managed to get into university, the Song family, for all intents and purposes, needed to treat their relatives to a meal.As they sat around the dinner table, older Uncle Song expressed his dissatisfaction at Song Yu\u2019s choice multiple times.\u201cHopeless. Everyone who does well on the entrance exams all go Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou. What\u2019s the point in staying here? And such an unpopular field of study too. Young people these days all either study IT or something high tech. Easier to earn money.\u201dYue Zhishi was very angry at this form of parental criticism, but he had no position to retort back. He could only give Song Yu some pieces of beef.\u201cI don\u2019t lack money,\u201d Song Yu very flatly said. \u201cThe majors you mentioned are all very good, but I have no interest in them.\u201dHis aunt chuckled and said, as if trying to smooth things over, \u201cXiao Yu, your uncle\u2019s just thinking of you. Yes, it\u2019s important to be interested in what you want to study, but geomatics is too unpopular. So many people haven\u2019t even heard of it. Wouldn\u2019t it be hard to find a job?\u201d\u201cAnd yes, Wuhan U is very good, but you would\u2019ve been able to get into Tsinghua with your score. It\u2019s such a pity. It would\u2019ve been fine even if you\u2019d ended up taking a slightly more ordinary degree at Tsinghua. You\u2019re still too young. When you\u2019re later looking for work, no matter what degree you have, people will respect you as soon as you say you graduated from Tsinghua.\u201dLin Rong couldn\u2019t help but snap, \u201cIn that case, sister-in-law, why don\u2019t you go work in Tsinghua\u2019s cafeteria? Why are you still working in a local school? You should believe in yourself a bit more, it\u2019ll sound so good to say you work in Tsinghua\u2019s cafeteria.\u201dTheir aunt had nothing to say to Lin Rong\u2019s brusque words. It was very difficult for Yue Zhishi to hold back his laughter \u2014 his leg started shaking in his amusement and only stopped when Song Yu reached below the table and held it down.Since the atmosphere was slightly awkward, Song Jin said a few words. \u201cYes, Xiao Yu\u2019s score truly could\u2019ve taken him to those universities. But if we think about it, if he went to Tsinghua and studied something he didn\u2019t like and ended up with a job he didn\u2019t want, he would\u2019ve struggled to be happy. We don\u2019t want him to have a future like that. Since he\u2019s already planned out his life and wants to continue researching into geomatics in the future, then naturally he needed to choose the best school for that field. Of course,\u201d he said, looking at Song Yu, \u201cuncle and auntie are just sharing their life experiences with you. You should listen to them too.\u201dYue Zhishi silently thought, they didn\u2019t even go to university, what experiences can they have? It\u2019s just that they found an opportunity to point their fingers at their family to nitpick.His aunt sighed again. \u201cThat\u2019s true. For children like Xiao Yu, they all have an escape route if they end up regretting choosing a field they liked or not. You can always take up your dad\u2019s company if you\u2019re really not happy. Your dad\u2019s working so hard just for you, after all. And to use a phrase that\u2019s super popular with you young people \u2014 you having your dad already means you\u2019ve won at life. You actually don\u2019t need to work that hard.\u201dHer face may have been covered by a large smile, but her eyes were filled with sarcasm. Song Yu was too lazy to reply and indifferently continued drinking his soup, entirely ignoring every single thing said by the people around the table.But Song Jin, who had always had a gentle personality, said with a stern face, \u201cSister-in-law.\u201dSeeing Song Jin without any traces of humour, she slightly panicked. She wasn\u2019t able to say anything before Song Jin continued speaking.\u201cI\u2019m not working so hard just for him to have already won at the starting line of life. It\u2019s so my son can have the right to make his own choices.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s hand also paused.\u201cWhat I can give him is the confidence to continue being himself.\u201dYue Zhishi was suddenly very touched. He\u2019d attended many of these dinners since he was a child. He didn\u2019t understand when he was younger, thinking everyone got along in beautiful harmony, but after visiting grandpa last time, he now understood their aunt and uncle\u2019s family wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d imagined. And yet every time they gathered together, no one tore apart the exterior layer of peace.Especially Uncle Song \u2014 Yue Zhishi had never seen him get angry. He had always been the person to ease the tension in the room while carrying a smile on his face.But this time, he very seriously stood up in front of Song Yu and defended him, safeguarding his choices.Yue Zhishi was very happy for Song Yu, and slightly envious.Having gotten into trouble, their aunt very naturally changed the topic since her own younger son might not even be able to get into an undergraduate course. She would only lose her own face if she continued to argue about study fields. The dinner may have been awkward, but the wonder of Chinese family dinners lay in the fact that no matter how many struggles or dramatic arguments may have occurred in the past, the entire family will always come together \u2014 whether in true joy or not.In the last few days of the summer holiday, Yue Zhishi went with Song Yu to the library. They would buy a cup of milk tea and a cup of lemonade as they travelled there on their bikes and be able to stay there the entire day.The library truly didn\u2019t contain a girl like he\u2019d fantasied. The only person who sat across from Song Yu, watching him quietly read and study, was Yue Zhishi himself.The person he\u2019d seen as his benchmark since he was a child moved forward towards his own goals step by step, becoming an increasingly more outstanding adult.Peiya\u2019s high school department was about to start school, so Yue Zhishi no longer followed Song Yu to the library. He closed himself off in his room for an entire week. Song Yu thought he was trying to play and watch anime as much as he could before starting school again \u2014 after all, he was about to start high school and even needed to attend military training. In those few days, Song Yu never could have imagined that Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t actually lock himself in his room to play.The start of high school was earlier than the day new students needed to report to university. The day before Yue Zhishi started school, he sent a message to Song Yu, who was in the library.[Yue Zhishi: I want to eat barbecue skewers. Let\u2019s go get some for dinner, since Aunt Rong and Uncle Song aren\u2019t coming home tonight.]Naturally, Song Yu agreed.They agreed to meet in front of the little restaurant. Delicious barbecue restaurants were all usually very shabby, hidden amongst old communities filled with the history of their people. Many small tables were clustered in front of the door and were prepared to be used later during the late night snack hours. Song Yu parked his bike and as soon as he entered, he immediately saw Yue Zhishi sitting next to the window and looking at the menu with his head lowered.Yue Zhishi truly had grown up. His arms and legs were long and slender, his skin very fair, and he was easily noticeable in a crowd of people. It wasn\u2019t just because of his appearance \u2014 but also because of his pure and clean youthfulness that was unable to be ignored.Song Yu walked over and sat across from him. Yue Zhishi immediately lifted his head, his light-coloured eyes brightening. \u201cYou\u2019re here. I\u2019ve already chose a few things, do you want to add anything else?\u201d He then covered his face with the menu, very softly hinting to Song Yu, \u201cThe table next to us ordered a\u00a0crab noodle pot. It looks really tasty.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t eat it,\u201d Song Yu heartlessly replied and took the menu from Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand.Yue Zhishi was very dejected and poured himself a cup of hawthorn iced tea. \u201cOkay.\u201d When he went to pour a cup for Song Yu, he abruptly noticed that Song Yu had actually ticked off the crab noodle pot on the menu.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say I can\u2019t eat it?\u201d\u201cYou can eat the crab.\u201d The corners of Song Yu\u2019s mouth lightly crooked up. He raised a hand, calling over a waiter, and asked, \u201cCan we change the egg noodles in the crab noodle pot to thick rice noodles?\u201d\u201cYou can, but the rice noodles will break apart easier.\u201dYue Zhishi was already very satisfied. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t mind rice noodles.\u201dSong Yu inspected once again the items Yue Zhishi had already marked off, and seeing there weren\u2019t any problems with them, handed off their food order to the waiter. He took a sip of the hawthorn iced tea Yue Zhishi had poured for him and frowned.\u201cIsn\u2019t it really sour?\u201d Yue Zhishi laughed. \u201cThe little bit I just had was also really sour.\u201d His hair was still a soft dark brown colour. After staying at home for so long during the summer break, his hair had grown out, once again starting to curl. It looked like it would be very soft to the touch.\u201cYou\u2019ll need to fix your hair before going back to school,\u201d Song Yu reminded him.Yue Zhishi nodded. As they waited for their food to arrive, he took out a gift box from his bag and lifted it towards Song Yu over the table.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Song Yu asked.\u201cOpen it after you go home. Don\u2019t open it now.\u201d Since Song Yu had yet to take the box, Yue Zhishi slightly pulled back his hands and waited for Song Yu to nod before he was willing to give it to him. \u201cI originally wanted to buy it, but none of the ones I saw were any good.\u201dYue Zhishi withdrew his arms and wrapped a hand around his plastic cup. \u201cI recently read online that guys shouldn\u2019t give handmade stuff as gifts since they\u2019re not worth much. Usually most people who are given those gifts don\u2019t really like them either.\u201d His fingers tightened, the cup changing shape and the hawthorn tea inside almost spilling out. \u201cAnd a lot of people in the comment section also agreed.\u201d\u201cBut it was a bit too late. I only saw the Weibo post last night after finishing this.\u201d Yue Zhishi tried his best to hide how disheartened he felt, but it was still very clear. \u201cSo look at it after we get home. Actually \u2014 no, bring it to university and then open it. Don\u2019t open it at home, I don\u2019t want to see how dissatisfied you are with it.\u201dThe expression on Song Yu\u2019s face shifted, and yet this guy completely didn\u2019t give him a single chance to say anything.Yue Zhishi lifted his face and looked at him. \u201cIf you really don\u2019t like it, you can tell me. If you\u2019d told me about this earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have kept making so many useless handmade things.\u201dHe threw back his head and drank some of his tea, his posture looking as if he was trying to drown his sorrows.In Song Yu\u2019s eyes, the look of Yue Zhishi moping about was a bit cute and also a bit pitiful. So he asked, \u201cThen when should I have told you? Kindergarten?\u201dYue Zhishi thought about it. That was true enough, the first time he\u2019d given Song Yu a present was in kindergarten \u2014 the love heart his teacher had taught them to fold.\u201cTrue.\u201d Yue Zhishi very seriously said, \u201cThen this is called cutting your losses.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve never rejected any before.\u201d Song Yu raised an eyebrow.That was also true. Yue Zhishi then said, \u201cThen that means you didn\u2019t reject them strongly enough.\u201dSong Yu quietly laughed once. \u201cHave you seen me accept presents from other people?\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head. \u201cNo, but you probably took mine because you had no other choice. Since I\u2019m your little brother.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s fingertip softly tapped on the table. \u201cI can\u2019t help it if you want to think that way.\u201d\u201cHere it is, here it is.\u201d Yue Zhishi rested a cheek against one of his hands. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that phrase online before too. Many people make fun of it.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t understand what he was talking about and frowned.\u201cThat phrase is listed as one of the things girls hate their boyfriends saying the most.\u201d He even purposefully pretended to act very impatiently and dismissively. \u201cI can\u2019t help it if you want to think that way. That\u2019s just how I am.\u201d Yue Zhishi spoke very energetically and completely didn\u2019t notice he\u2019d compared their relationship to being boyfriend and girlfriend. He also didn\u2019t notice Song Yu hadn\u2019t initially said it with indifference \u2014 rather, he\u2019d said it helplessly.\u201cExcuse me, your barbecue potatoes, tendons, green peppers and cartilage.\u201d The waiter carried their barbecue skewers over and placed them on the table, interrupting the two of them. After thanking him, Yue Zhishi slightly forgot what he was just talking about.Song Yu opened his mouth after waiting for the waiter to leave. \u201cStop going online so much.\u201dYue Zhishi tightened his lips and didn\u2019t retort, only grabbing a barbecue potato skewer to start eating.The crab noodle pot without any egg noodles came very soon after. The dish was actually made in a very similar way to braised crayfish \u2014 it\u2019s just that the crayfish was changed to crab. After grilling, the crab turned wonderfully spicy and fragrant with its rich and thick sauce, and the egg noodles would then be mixed in and absorb the sauce and juices from the crab. It was a very popular late night speciality dish for the locals.Since Yue Zhishi unfortunately couldn\u2019t eat egg noodles, the main eating point was changed to rice noodles. Even though it didn\u2019t absorb flavour as well, the mouth feel and texture of those noodles was smoother and more refreshing, and it did taste quite delicious.Yue Zhishi was a very open-minded person. He wouldn\u2019t be disappointed if something he couldn\u2019t eat needed to be cooked a different way for him to eat it. Many things in life were like that as well \u2014 if you weren\u2019t meant to have it, then don\u2019t think too much about it.He even directly gave up on the pieces of crab he couldn\u2019t break open, choosing another piece to eat.Yue Zhishi always felt he was the type of person who wouldn\u2019t force things.They left for home after they satisfied their stomachs. Cotton Candy whined to go downstairs, so Yue Zhishi went to walk the dog by himself.Song Yu went back to his room, sitting at his desk to examine Yue Zhishi\u2019s gift. Yue Zhishi would usually also make the gift wrapping by hand and would decorate it with some cartoon drawings, but this time, it truly looked like he\u2019d been disturbed. He used a gift box from somewhere; it was packaged very beautifully and looked just like a very important gift.But Song Yu still liked and preferred Yue Zhishi\u2019s old packaging. He\u2019d yet to throw away a single one of the gift boxes he\u2019d received since they were children.Since Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want him to open it, Song Yu followed his orders and directly placed the box into the suitcase he planned to take to university. He closed the suitcase and pushed it into the corner of his room.This medium sized suitcase rested in the corner for only four days before following Song Yu to report to Wuhan University. The campus was on the other side of the river, not really that far from home. Song Yu stubbornly wanted to go by himself, but Song Jin and Lin Rong, thinking this was an important event in their son\u2019s life, insisted on sending him over.The university was surrounded by mountains and lakes, Chinese classical architecture mixed with western and fused with layers of greenery. It was very beautiful. The volunteers in charge of welcoming the new students were also very friendly, doing their best to help the new students as they arrived on campus. Song Yu and his family drove over in a car \u2014 the school was even bigger than they\u2019d imagined. Lin Rong wanted to follow Song Yu up to his dormitory, but Song Yu directly refused.Song Jin said, pacifying his wife, \u201cXiao Yu\u2019s already so grown up. If you go up and fuss around, he\u2019ll be laughed at by his roommates.\u201dLin Rong didn\u2019t take him seriously. \u201cIf it were Le Le, he would definitely let me go up.\u201d\u201cSo you have nothing to regret this time, you still have one more chance,\u201d Song Yu said.Song Yu refused to let them go up with him once more, so his two parents went home after strolling around for a bit. They really were quite busy with work, and since the campus was in the same city, they could come by whenever they wanted.After Song Yu sent them away, he pulled his suitcase by himself to the designated reporting area: the plaza in front of the School of Arts and Sciences general library. The major he chose truly was very unpopular \u2014 the amount of people arriving there to report was much less compared to the size of the plaza, and with the efficiency of the people working there, the reporting procedure finished quite quickly.Song Yu held his residence registration form and a map as he prepared to walk towards his dorm. The map said he could take the campus bus to his dorm, so he dragged his suitcase along as he searched for the bus stop.He stood there by himself for a little while, and then Song Yu lowered his head to look at the watch on his wrist. When he looked up again, a person not too far away was moving closer, carrying his own suitcase. This person looked very pale and very exhausted.There were always many coincidences in life.The greeting Song Yu failed to send months ago because he didn\u2019t have his contact information swirled in his brain.But he still couldn\u2019t open his mouth by the time Xu Qichen was separated from him by only three metres.There was still another person who didn\u2019t know what was happening \u2014 Xu Qichen was staring at the map on his phone, and when he finally lifted his head, he met Song Yu\u2019s eyes straight on. Surprise flashed across his eyes before it quickly disappeared, and his gaze once again turned apathetic.He\u2019d lost a lot of weight. He\u2019d originally had a very thin figure to begin with, but now he looked almost skeletal, weak and fragile. He wore a white t-shirt that no longer looked new, a pair of faded jeans and a pair of glasses, his eyes dull.Song Yu eventually opened his mouth. \u201cWhat a coincidence. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d end up at the same university.\u201dXu Qichen pursed his lips, looking as if he didn\u2019t really want to speak, before he finally nodded. Song Yu couldn\u2019t tell if he was acknowledging what he\u2019d said or if he was merely saying hello.The campus bus still had yet to arrive, and Xu Qichen looked like he wanted to leave. Song Yu saw that he was carrying a lot of things, his suitcase very large, and his heart slightly softened. He honestly wasn\u2019t someone who was eager to help others, but he thought about Xia Zhixu, thought about Yue Zhishi \u2014 if either of them were here, they wouldn\u2019t leave Xu Qichen behind and ignore him.So he walked up and helped Xu Qichen carry a luggage bag.\u201cYour dorm should be nearby if you can get by without taking the bus.\u201d Song Yu glanced at the residence form in his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d That was the first sentence out of Xu Qichen\u2019s mouth since he arrived. He didn\u2019t look well at all, looking as if he\u2019d fall over with just one gust of wind.Song Yu frowned and asked a question even he thought was very absurd. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Xu Qichen didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cQuite well.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t look too well,\u201d Song Yu said, very frankly.Xu Qichen finally lifted his face and gazed at Song Yu. \u201cIs there any need for me to lie?\u201dSong Yu paused, momentarily unable to answer. It\u2019s not like he was Xu Qichen\u2019s friend; at the most, he was only a friend of a friend.\u201cI heard about what happened before. Xia Zhixu was also very worried after he heard you got into trouble.\u201dWhat he said was true, but in reality it was also a bunch of useless words. There was no way Xu Qichen didn\u2019t know about it, so after he finished speaking, Xu Qichen remained expressionless. The sun was very bright, and the two of them stood in a place without any shade, facing each other.\u201cThank you for telling me.\u201d Xu Qichen stared at the shadows on the ground, the black spreading without a single obstacle.Song Yu didn\u2019t want him to be like this, so for Xia Zhixu, he tried to get something from him. \u201cXu Qichen\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you think it\u2019s a pity?\u201d Xu Qichen suddenly raised his head and looked directly at Song Yu.Song Yu froze.\u201cWhat\u2019s so pitiful about it?\u201d Xu Qichen laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being like this?\u201dRumours were the best way to destroy a person. Song Yu knew this, especially when it came to someone as sensitive as Xu Qichen, but he kept feeling that the two of them shouldn\u2019t have ended up like this. But at this very moment, as he took in Xu Qichen and the way he acted, a seed of doubt grew in his heart.\u201cYou don\u2019t regret leaving so decisively at all?\u201dXu Qichen laughed again, the cicadas drowning out his soft laughter. \u201cIf there was anything for me to regret, I should regret many things. I should regret getting my parents to take me out on a trip after my high school entrance exams. I should regret the fact only I survived the accident \u2014 I should regret getting on that bus the first day of high school and meeting Xia Zhixu.\u201dHis voice was a bit shaky, and he paused for a few seconds before he continued, voice steady. \u201cNo, maybe the last thing I should regret is meeting him. After all, he is the person who pulled me back up to my feet again.\u201dA few girls chatting and laughing arrived. They were most likely new students too, their words and voices filled with expectation, with hope.On a day when everything can be started all over again, who wouldn\u2019t look towards the future with hope?Xu Qichen took his luggage from Song Yu and said, \u201cBut if I were to relive my life again, I would rather have never met him.\u201dHe politely gave Song Yu a slight smile, almost as quiet and calm as the first time they\u2019d met. He expressed his gratitude. \u201cIf you really want me to live well, then pretend you don\u2019t know me. We\u2019re in two different departments after all, so we shouldn\u2019t see each other often.\u201d\u201cIf I see you, I\u2019ll keep thinking about him. I don\u2019t want to be like that anymore.\u201dThe bus appeared, and that cheerful group of girls got on while Xu Qichen left by himself.Song Yu sunk into an indescribable emotion. He entered the bus, and the inside was very cramped, giving him no way to breathe. On the very first day of classes, in a new environment, he bumped into a familiar face who couldn\u2019t really be called an old friend, but the other person was already no longer the same as before.He was assigned to a relatively new building for his dormitory. There were four people to a room, and he was the first one to arrive. The dormitory room wasn\u2019t as spacious as his room at home, and Song Yu opened the window, feeling quite empty. He didn\u2019t really want to pause and rest, so he started making his bed, spreading open his mattress cover and bedsheets, tidying and cleaning until finally, he opened his one and only suitcase.He\u2019d brought a pitifully small amount of things. The left side of the suitcase held his usual clothes and daily items, while the right side was mostly taken up by a large gift box and a photo album.Song Yu pulled out the photo album, flipping through the pages. It was filled with a child who looked like a western doll.Following Yue Zhishi\u2019s orders, Song Yu grabbed out the starting school gift he\u2019d been given many days ago and sat on a chair. He silently opened the packaging.He\u2019d actually already thought of many possibilities of what outrageous toy he might receive this time, but the gift he finally received was very different from what he\u2019d imagined.Yue Zhishi gifted him a globe.The base and the stand were both carved by hand, the detailing very exquisite, and were covered with a layer of metallic copper polish. And the actual globe \u2014 the rivers, mountains and land, the seven oceans and four continents, the latitude and longitude lines \u2014 every minute detail,\u00a0 every little mark, was personally hand drawn by Yue Zhishi as he copied the markings from a real globe.It was very hard for Song Yu to imagine just how much time Yue Zhishi had spent on it.Song Yu stared at the heavy globe in his hand, and the only thing he could think of was what Xu Qichen had said earlier.People who\u2019d lost all hope could choose to not see each other in order to cut their losses. But there was no way for him to cut away this relationship \u2014 from that rainy night Yue Zhishi had trespassed into his life, Song Yu had become an older brother even if he hadn\u2019t wanted to, even if he didn\u2019t want to stay as one. There was no way to reverse time \u2014 everything they\u2019d gone through had become memories and bonds caging him in place.Sometimes, Song Yu truly would rather they were strangers and have the kind of beginnings strangers had.But he once again had no way to give up those memories of growing up together.At his heart, he was actually the one person who was deeply trapped in contradictory thoughts and yet who was unable to give anything up.In his quiet dorm, Song Yu placed the globe in his hand onto his desk. The active and noisy voices of many new students passed through the window, and they were filled with the spark of youth. He leaned against his chair, his long arm resting on top of his desk, and lightly touched the globe with a fingertip. The globe gently swayed, as if it was blown by a breeze.This globe rested peacefully on his desk and stayed with him through many late, sleepless nights as he studied.The first time it rained, Song Yu was outside and kept worrying if the window in the dorm was tightly shut. Later, he didn\u2019t want to worry, so he directly placed it under a glass cover.The cherry blossoms started to bloom in March, and the petals occasionally drifted in only to be blocked outside the glass with no way to fall onto a single river drawn by Yue Zhishi.When it snowed, the dorm was very cold. A thin layer of white fog often covered the glass, the small globe turning hazy and indistinct.Sometimes he touched it with a fingertip, gently brushing against the glass cover and leaving behind a fingerprint or even a name. But his mark never stayed for long and was very quickly wiped away.As if nothing had ever happened.The person hiding under the cover, and his globe, were both very safe.\u201cThis globe of Song Yu\u2019s has been sitting on his desk for almost three years now. It looks almost brand new.\u201d Roommate Chen Fangyuan ate some potato chips as he bent over to look closely at Song Yu\u2019s globe, looking closer than if he was at a museum. \u201cIt\u2019s drawn so well. This is the first time I\u2019m looking at it from such a close distance.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you touch it. He won\u2019t be happy when he comes out of the shower.\u201d One of their other roommates, and also the dormitory leader, Wang Chengzhi was packing away some things. He zipped close his bag and looked outside at the dark and gloomy sky. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s going to storm. I need to hurry up and go home, my mom\u2019s still waiting for me to eat lunch together.\u201d\u201cGo, go.\u201d Chen Fangyuan stood up straight, stretching. \u201cOld Liu is with his girlfriend, and you need to go home. Everyone\u2019s leaving. I\u2019m going to hang out at my little brother\u2019s place in a bit. Only our tall and handsome Song Yu will stay and keep this empty room company.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe him, he\u2019s clearly a local. He never goes home and keeps locking himself away in the research lab.\u201dAs the two of them spoke, Song Yu came out of the bathroom, drying his hair. Seeing Wang Chengzhi was about to leave, he reminded him, \u201cRemember to bring an umbrella.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Wang Chengzhi shrugged on his backpack. \u201cI\u2019ll bring back some of my mom\u2019s braised beef for you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go downstairs with you and borrow your umbrella while we\u2019re at it.\u201d\u201cHow many umbrellas have you lost this semester, really\u2026\u201dThe dorm once again calmed down. He blew dry his hair as the sky turned darker. It was the morning, and yet it looked as if it was night time. He sat back at his desk, and Song Yu turned on his desk lamp, opening a book, when his phone vibrated. He didn\u2019t look at it, thinking it was a roommate.But his phone didn\u2019t just vibrate once \u2014 it vibrated twice, then three times, the notifications consistently popping up on his screen. Only one person texted him this way.So Song Yu placed down his book and unlocked his phone.[Yue Zhishi: Gege, it\u2019s my monthly break][Yue Zhishi: Aunt Rong said she\u2019s made some soup for you, but she can\u2019t come. She asked if I had time, and guess what I said?][Yue Zhishi: \u201cWhat kind of good luck is this?\u201d][Yue Zhishi: And all that is the context. I\u2019m going to your school to look for you, I\u2019ll get there in the afternoon][Yue Zhishi: Gege, wait for me]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 39: To Meet By ChanceYue Zhishi was still in his classroom when he sent across his messages. After hearing they\u2019d be let out early for their monthly break, he was too excited to sit still and for the first time, sneakily used his phone while his teacher was still standing at the podium.He was so excited, he completely missed the reason why they were being released for their monthly break so early in the morning.In the classroom, his classmates were all delighted at the news, and the class adviser once again stressed, \u201cThe storm warning this time is level red and might be the largest amount of rain we\u2019ve had so far this year. Those who live at school, try not to leave if you can. Safety comes first\u2026\u201dYue Zhishi was entirely focused on his WeChat. He\u2019d thought he would have needed to wait for a long time, but Song Yu\u2019s reply came faster than he\u2019d imagined.[Xiao Yu gege: It\u2019s raining today, don\u2019t come.]Yue Zhishi drew his eyebrows together, not quite happy with his reply.[Yue Zhishi: No way, I agreed to it last night. If you don\u2019t come see me, then I\u2019ll go look for you at your research lab building.]After he finished typing, Yue Zhishi lifted his head and saw everyone was already packing their things away to go home, so he stuffed his phone into his pocket and quickly got himself ready as well. His phone was set to silent mode \u2014 Yue Zhishi only remembered after he\u2019d gotten on the bus home. He immediately looked at it, and as expected, there was a reply sent two minutes after he\u2019d sent out his own.[Xiao Yu gege: What time]There was another message right under it, only one minute separating the two.[Xiao Yu gege: I need to go to the lab right now, there\u2019s a bunch of new data I need to organise and remodel. Let me know when you\u2019re almost here, and I\u2019ll come out and get you. Remember to bring an umbrella, and be careful on your way here.]Song Yu usually didn\u2019t speak much, but he often explained himself very clearly even though Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know what his work was and what he needed to do.Yue Zhishi silently reread Song Yu\u2019s messages and thought their conversation felt a bit stiff, so he sent over a sticker of a little puppy nodding, making their chat feel a lot gentler.[Yue Zhishi: I\u2019ll arrive at 6pm.]He didn\u2019t want to tell Song Yu he\u2019d been let out early \u2014 he wanted to give him a surprise. It was fine even if Song Yu needed to study; he could always sit next to him and not bother him.It would be very nice to see him earlier.When he got home, Lin Rong was just pouring the finished soup into an insulated container. She praised Peiya for having a conscience when she heard he was released early, but she was still a bit worried at Yue Zhishi going to Wuhan U.Lin Rong waited for Yue Zhishi to come down again after changing his clothes and said, \u201cIf you go over in the afternoon, what are you going to do if it starts storming? It\u2019s really not safe enough if you\u2019re in a car.\u201dYue Zhishi was wearing a smoky blue short-sleeved t-shirt with a pair of black jeans, and his outfit emphasised his long arms and legs and his pale, glowing skin. He held a black baseball cap and went to sit in front of the dining table, pushing a small piece of cantaloupe into his mouth with a fork. \u201cThen I\u2019ll take the subway. It goes directly there anyway even if it\u2019s a bit slower.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t I go instead.\u201d Lin Rong was still anxious. \u201cI\u2019ll drive over there and then head to the high-speed rail from Wuhan U.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t, it\u2019ll be too much of a hassle. You\u2019re only taking the high-speed rail because your flight was cancelled. What if your train\u2019s delayed?\u201d Yue Zhishi chose a bigger piece of fruit and stretched out his arm until the cantaloupe piece rested next to Lin Rong\u2019s mouth. \u201cAunt Rong, don\u2019t worry, nothing will happen.\u201dYue Zhishi added, \u201cBesides, I was already planning to head over earlier. It\u2019s 10am right now, and I\u2019ll get there right in time to eat lunch with gege. I still haven\u2019t tried Wuhan U\u2019s cafeterias.\u201dLin Rong felt this plan was workable and placed the insulation container into a bag. \u201cYou\u2019ve already discussed it with your brother?\u201dYue Zhishi nodded but didn\u2019t tell Lin Rong about his planned surprise. \u201cHe said he\u2019ll pick me up at the entrance.\u201d\u201cYour brother, really\u2026 It would be nice if he came home more.\u201d Lin Rong knelt down and opened the oven door, her voice carrying a slight hint of grumbling. \u201cHe only came home once every three months last year. He still has yet to come back after starting school again after the summer holidays.\u201d Lin Rong had made some\u00a0salted-egg puffs\u00a0and\u00a0flower pastries\u00a0specifically for Song Yu\u2019s roommates, and they had just finished in the oven and were ready to be packed away.\u201cMaybe he\u2019s too busy. They all say some university studies are scarier than third year of high school.\u201d Yue Zhishi helped Lin Rong wrap and place the pastries into another container before also putting it into his school bag. Both of the pastries were made without any wheat flour, so he tried some as he was putting them away. The salted-egg puff still had a warm, gooey centre, was particularly fragrant and was very delicious.Lin Rong released her ponytail after packing up the food and cleaning up the kitchen. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, that guy might\u2019ve found himself a girlfriend. He might be too busy hanging out with his girlfriend at school, so he doesn\u2019t want to come home.\u201dYue Zhishi was just about to pull on his bag. He froze at Lin Rong\u2019s words.Lin Rong always liked teasing her children, but her teasing was never truly serious \u2014 she always forgot what she said immediately after, always changing the topic of the conversation faster than anyone else. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you\u2019re going to eat on campus, but please be careful and don\u2019t eat anything you can\u2019t eat.\u201d She added some nutritional supplements into Yue Zhishi\u2019s bag. \u201cIs it heavy? If it is, let\u2019s take some things out.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Yue Zhishi lifted his head and looked at the clock. It wasn\u2019t early anymore, so he turned around and urged Lin Rong to hurry to the high-speed rail.The two of them ended up leaving together. Lin Rong sent Yue Zhishi to the subway station, placing an umbrella in his hand, and kept giving him reminders as if he was a young child. Yue Zhishi said, laughing, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come together with me? Don\u2019t go to uncle anymore, we can have a two person day trip to Wuhan U.\u201dOnly then did Lin Rong start to relax. She smiled and said, \u201cThen your uncle will be too pitiful. All right, hurry up and get on the subway.\u201d\u201cOkay. Give me a video call when you get there.\u201d Yue Zhishi got on the escalator and waved back at Lin Rong.There were many people in the subway station, the majority of them either students on a break or people who\u2019d come out to play on the weekend. Yue Zhishi got on his train and, with a very good stroke of luck, found an empty seat. He sat down, and a young couple stood in front of him, the man quite tall. The man\u2019s right hand held onto the strap handle, while his left hand held onto his girlfriend\u2019s waist. The woman stood a bit unsteadily, her arms wrapped around her boyfriend\u2019s entire waist as she leaned against his chest, looking as if she was greatly reluctant to let go.There was very little distance between the couple and Yue Zhishi. He felt it was a bit impolite to keep staring at them, especially since the woman had already, maybe intentionally or not, glanced at him, so he pulled his cap lower onto his face and closed his eyes, pretending to sleep.He thought he would only pretend to sleep, but Yue Zhishi actually did fall asleep. When he woke up, the couple was already gone, and the train cabin was still just as full as before. The train arrived at a stop, and coincidentally enough, it was the one Yue Zhishi needed to get off at.There were so many people. Yue Zhishi immediately stood up, carrying his backpack and holding the insulation container, and pushed against the people tightly packed inside the cabin like sardines. He finally managed to get out right as the doors were about to close. Yue Zhishi felt like he\u2019d been reborn, like a fish who\u2019d managed to escape from a fish pot back to the ocean.He climbed onto the escalator, emotionally sighing in his heart about how lucky he was today \u2014 there just so happened to be an empty seat, and he just so happened to wake up as the train arrived at his stop. But he was struck dumb when he reached the entrance to the subway and saw the rain pouring down like a waterfall.An old granny was at the entrance selling some things with a stall, and she tilted her head to watch as this beautiful boy patted down his body, looking as if he\u2019d just had something stolen. He then turned around to face the subway, frustrated, and walked only two steps before spinning back around and staring blankly at the storm.She tentatively asked, \u201cLittle handsome boy, would you like to buy an umbrella? Fifteen yuan for one, very cheap. It\u2019s my last one.\u201dAnd then her wish was fulfilled.Yue Zhishi bought her last umbrella. It was long and transparent, and as he opened it, getting ready to leave, he saw the old granny lower her head and arrange the wet items lying on her stall. Fresh gardenia and magnolia flowers were neatly laid out, and there weren\u2019t many left.Glancing at the heavy rain, Yue Zhishi paused. He crouched down and softly asked, \u201cGranny, how much for these flowers?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d like some flowers?\u201d The old granny was a little surprised at first, but then she very quickly gave Yue Zhishi a price. A fresh magnolia flower earring hung from her earlobe, and as she spoke, it lightly rocked back and forth, dispersing a light fragrance into the air.The subway entrance was overcrowded with people. Everyone was very busy, hurrying to and fro, and not many people cared about this faint flower fragrance.\u201cI\u2019d like all of them.\u201dThe old granny smiled from ear to ear and carefully wrapped up the flowers for him. \u201cYou must be giving them to your girlfriend. I\u2019ll wrap them up for you. You can display them for a few days, they smell very nice.\u201dYue Zhishi gave her his money, and then very truthfully said, smiling, \u201cI don\u2019t have a girlfriend.\u201d\u201cAiyah, no way, how could a good-looking boy like you not have a girlfriend.\u201d She encased the flowers in a layer of transparent foil before handing it to Yue Zhishi. \u201cI\u2019m here every day. You\u2019re the most handsome boy I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dYue Zhishi was a bit shy at all her praise. He helped her put away her stall and repeatedly urged her home, saying the storm will last for a very long time.He started to leave the subway station only after he watched the old granny walk a far distance away with an old, checkered umbrella. He carried the transparent umbrella he hadn\u2019t really needed to buy and headed towards Wuhan U.After starting high school, Yue Zhishi would occasionally ask to visit Song Yu during his school breaks, but his requests were denied more often than not. He also knew Song Yu was very busy and didn\u2019t have much time to accompany him, so he later stopped trying. He\u2019d only come by once, when Lin Rong wanted to see Song Yu and brought Yue Zhishi along, but he didn\u2019t get the chance to enter Song Yu\u2019s dormitory.And then afterwards, he too became busier and busier. There were less and less school breaks, and so he had no appropriate excuse to come to Wuhan U.The torrential rain never stopped, the raindrops loudly drumming onto his umbrella. The ground was already flooded by a layer of water, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s pair of canvas shoes was very quickly drenched. Wuhan U was truly too large \u2014 he was lost as soon as he went in. Yue Zhishi tried looking for where he needed to go through the map app on his phone, but he ended up needing to stop a girl to ask for directions. He finally managed to find that very hidden school building.The time had just passed 12pm. The sky was dark and gloomy, the storm clouds covering over half the sky. Since he arrived so early, maybe he\u2019d be able to get Song Yu to eat lunch with him. Yue Zhishi knew very well Song Yu never paid much attention to his meals and would often forget to eat whenever he was busy. If no one pushed for him to eat at this time, it was very unlikely for him to have already eaten.He started to imagine how Song Yu would react when he saw him \u2014 he\u2019d definitely immediately blame Yue Zhishi for not informing him ahead of time and ruining his plans. And then, with a slightly reluctant face, he\u2019d tell him he can\u2019t do this again next time before he took him somewhere to eat.Yue Zhishi\u2019s footsteps paused as he was about to reach the building. He changed the hand carrying the insulation container, using the other hand to hold his umbrella since his wrist was starting to get a bit sore. A gust of wind blew just as he was changing things over, and the umbrella was almost blown upside down. Yue Zhishi raised a hand to steady the umbrella, but then his cap was lifted away by the wind and fell to the ground, the rain very quickly soaking through it.Yue Zhishi wanted to bend over and pick his cap back up, but no matter how he juggled the items in his hands, the umbrella and container sat very awkwardly in his arms. He was too tired. He stood there, looking up and sighing, when he abruptly saw a familiar figure come out of that school building.It was Song Yu.There was nothing more coincidental than this. Yue Zhishi was about to call out his name, but then he saw a short and petite girl come out next to him. The two of them stood quite closely, a black umbrella in Song Yu\u2019s hand, and the girl kept looking at him with her head raised as she spoke. She was standing slightly on her tiptoes and didn\u2019t stop talking while Song Yu occasionally nodded and briefly replied a few words.He didn\u2019t know why, but when he saw Song Yu nodding, Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart inexplicably and unconsciously sprouted a sense of discouragement, of anxiety, and it urged him to leave this place. The rain was pouring very heavily onto his umbrella, the ground \u2014 it was everywhere, and nothing was able to dodge from it.Yue Zhishi was worrying about his cap just a second ago, but now he didn\u2019t have the ability to think about it anymore. He turned around, used the umbrella to block half of his body, and left the place with hasty footsteps before he quickly started to run.He could feel that there was much more water on the ground than before. His pants already belonged to the rain, and even though his upper half of his body hadn\u2019t been rained on, the feeling of cold dampness spreading from his lower half and travelling upwards trapped him, making him uncomfortable. He ran without thinking, exiting from a little alleyway, and tried to find a place he could sit and hide from the rain. Because he truly was tired.When he escaped, the splashes from his footsteps made a little noise, but the sound very quickly disappeared in the unstoppable heavy rain. More and more students started to gather together underneath the school building, and they were all discussing which cafeteria to go to for lunch.\u201cSong Yu? Are you still listening?\u201dSong Yu brought his gaze back, but he was still frowning. He somewhat perfunctorily apologised for his loss of attention. \u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d The girl smiled very brightly and looked like she didn\u2019t really care. \u201cWe can talk about the rest in the afternoon. Let\u2019s go eat first.\u201d She felt she\u2019d invited him very naturally, with a low possibility of being rejected.But she didn\u2019t expect Song Yu to lower his head, pulling out his phone and calling someone, before he somewhat absentmindedly said to her, \u201cI have something to do, I\u2019m not eating anymore.\u201d\u201cAh? Not eating?\u201d The girl was dumbfounded for a moment, then she leaned closer a bit and looked at Song Yu. She noticed his attention was no longer on her, and he\u2019d even already pulled a slight distance away.She tried a new different tactic, a bit of plea entering her face. She said, voice very soft, \u201cThen can you send me to my dorm? I didn\u2019t bring an umbrella. It\u2019s very close, just over there.\u201dThe rain really was too heavy, and the students around them were all mostly sharing their umbrellas as they quickly departed. She focused on Song Yu, and seeing him call again without anyone picking up the phone, she\u2019d thought he didn\u2019t hear her request and prepared to ask again.\u201cYou can borrow it.\u201d Song Yu gave the umbrella to the girl, and then he ran into the rain.The girl stood there with the umbrella, frozen. She didn\u2019t understand why Song Yu suddenly had something so urgent \u2014 so urgent to the point he\u2019d rather throw his only umbrella to her than send her to her dorm.There was no way for her to guess this, but it was very obvious \u2014 all of this was solely because of a similar receding figure that held a slight hint of possibility.Holding his umbrella, Yue Zhishi felt like he was a stray dog who\u2019d suffered through a rough journey. He was pulled down by the rain, his steps slow and heavy. He didn\u2019t know how, but he arrived at a random cafeteria, ceiling to floor windows covering the airy first floor mess hall. It looked very clean inside, so he padded up the steps, closed his umbrella and went in.When he sat down at a seat near the window, Yue Zhishi finally placed down all of the items in his hands. The palms of his hands had turned red from being strangled, so he kneaded them. He wanted to see if he\u2019d brought any tissues, and as he searched his body, he ended up taking out only his phone.The screen lit up. There were four missed calls, all from Song Yu.Yue Zhishi jumped in shock, and he suddenly remembered he still had yet to turn his phone back onto vibrate mode because of his usual school habits. The phone hadn\u2019t sounded at all. He hurriedly lifted his phone, preparing to call back, but the other side was faster and called again. Yue Zhishi was a bit afraid, and he trembled as he picked up the call.\u201cWhere are you right now? Why didn\u2019t you pick up your phone?\u201d Song Yu didn\u2019t sound happy, and his voice was very different from usual \u2014 very urgent, and sounded like he was angry.Yue Zhishi wanted to answer his question, but he really didn\u2019t know where he was. He exited the phone call screen in a fluster, wanting to look at the map, but he was also worried he\u2019d miss Song Yu speaking. He could only stand up and ask someone nearby, \u201cExcuse me, can you please tell me which cafeteria this is?\u201dOn the other side of the phone, Song Yu could hear the person\u2019s very fuzzy answer. He immediately said, \u201cWait for me.\u201dYue Zhishi returned back to his seat next to the glass window and lowered his head to look at his call screen displaying the hung up phone call. He put his phone down on the table, and after two seconds, he lifted it back up again to turn it to vibrate mode.He couldn\u2019t think. Yue Zhishi\u2019s head dropped, and he stared at the red mark on his palm and the plastic bag drenched by rain. He pulled open the bag and rustled through it without lifting his head \u2014 the flowers inside were still intact and were still very fragrant.What happened today wasn\u2019t exactly what he\u2019d thought would happen before he came. It was a lot messier and much more panicked. He started to think his good luck had once again slipped away.After only a short moment, his phone once again vibrated. Yue Zhishi immediately picked up the call, placing the phone next to his ear.\u201cWhich floor are you on?\u201dKnowing he might\u2019ve already arrived, Yue Zhishi twisted around to look towards the door as he explained where he was to Song Yu. \u201cI\u2019m on the first floor, near the big door. Turn right after you come in, and you should be able to see me. I\u2019m wearing\u2026\u201d\u201cA blue shirt,\u201d Song Yu said first.The voice over the phone turned pensive. \u201cI\u2019ve found you.\u201dSo quickly? Yue Zhishi looked all around him in bewilderment, searching for Song Yu\u2019s voice, when he suddenly heard the sound of something knocking on the glass from behind his back.Dong dong\u2014\u2014He twisted his head around. Song Yu was just outside, holding on his phone, his entire body saturated from the rain. Only one layer of clear glass made hazy by the rain separated him from Yue Zhishi.His raised knuckles were still resting against the glass window, and the little area he was touching was also splotched with water marks.As if something was controlling his body, Yue Zhishi lifted his palm and laid it against the window, covering Song Yu\u2019s knuckles. But then, in the next second, he felt what he\u2019d done was too foolish and awkwardly wanted to take his hand back.But Song Yu was always faster.His bent knuckles spread open, his palm flipped over, and he very naturally rested it against Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand.\u201cWhy\u2019d you run?\u201dSong Yu was standing in front of him, and yet his voice came to him through the phone. He sounded much more relaxed than before, and this made Yue Zhishi feel as if he\u2019d entered into a trance. But as soon as Song Yu finished speaking, he dropped his hand back down to his body, and he left, walking towards the cafeteria.Seeing as Song Yu couldn\u2019t see him, Yue Zhishi frowned, thinking of how he\u2019d looked as he desperately ran away earlier. There was no way for him to explain. He decided to take a chance \u2014 he felt Song Yu actually hadn\u2019t seen him, and had only guessed that he ran away.Song Yu arrived in front of him without giving him much time to think, hanging up his phone. His face was covered with water droplets, his short hair and eyebrows completely wet, and even his eyelashes carried tiny drops of water. He clearly should look a lot messier, and yet all the water created a kind of strange, bewitching air around him.There shouldn\u2019t be anyone who didn\u2019t like that face, Yue Zhishi thought. He completely forgot why Song Yu would be drenched to this extent, when he\u2019d clearly brought an umbrella.Song Yu asked again, \u201cWhy did you run earlier?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Yue Zhishi was subconsciously reluctant to admit it. \u201cYou can see how much stuff I\u2019m carrying. How could I run?\u201d He finally quietly grumbled, \u201cI only just arrived.\u201d\u201cDo you think you\u2019re good at lying?\u201d Song Yu flicked an eyebrow as he spoke.Even though his voice didn\u2019t sound gentle at all, Yue Zhishi could clearly feel \u2014 after seeing him, Song Yu was no longer as urgent as he was earlier on the phone. He\u2019d slowed down, and was also no longer as angry.But this kind of change was too slight for someone as serious and reserved as Song Yu. Anyone else might think there was no difference in him at all, and that Yue Zhishi was only thinking too much.He gazed straight at Song Yu\u2019s black eyes, and after an inner struggle, he finally admitted defeat. \u201cYou saw me? You shouldn\u2019t have, you clearly hadn\u2019t noticed me before I turned around.\u201d He was very sure about this bit \u2014 he\u2019d even used his umbrella to block himself.Song Yu set down the cap he\u2019d lost earlier.For a similar body silhouette, he\u2019d run into a torrential downpour.That reason was too ridiculous, so he made one up on the spot.\u201cYour umbrella\u2019s transparent.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It really was transparent.He was too foolish, trying to use a see-through umbrella as a shield.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say 6pm?\u201d Song Yu asked.Yue Zhishi pursed his lips and ended up clearly laying out his failed surprise plan to Song Yu. Song Yu didn\u2019t look too surprised, only nodding, and then asked if he\u2019d eaten.\u201cNot yet.\u201d Yue Zhishi shook his head, explaining he\u2019d come straight over after going home, but then he stood back up, taking his bag and preparing to leave. \u201cCan your cafeterias pack food for takeaway? I don\u2019t want to eat here, you\u2019re already drenched through. Let\u2019s go back first and shower.\u201dSong Yu silently accepted his suggestion and stood up as well, very naturally taking Yue Zhishi\u2019s bag off his shoulder and pulling it over his own before he went to grab the bag with the insulation container. He only said, \u201cHold your umbrella.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Yue Zhishi securely held onto his umbrella and his flowers, and he followed behind his gege. Song Yu queried if there was anything he wanted to eat, but Yue Zhishi only said he wasn\u2019t hungry \u2014 he was completely focused on getting Song Yu into the shower, worried that he might be cold.But Song Yu looked like he already had a destination in mind. He didn\u2019t consider too much and went directly to a window with a long line. He paused and squinted towards the front.Yue Zhishi really liked this little movement of his \u2014 the little squint felt like something a big cat would do, and he felt it was very cute. Even though Song Yu and the word \u2018cute\u2019 were two completely isolated things, sometimes, that description would unconsciously jump out into Yue Zhishi\u2019s mind.There were many people waiting in line. Yue Zhishi wanted to help Song Yu carry a bag, but he was rejected. Song Yu\u2019s fingers were still dripping with water; Yue Zhishi stretched out a fingertip and caught the droplets of water as they fell.\u201cWhere\u2019s your umbrella?\u201d he asked Song Yu.Song Yu very quickly replied, \u201cI\u2019ve lent it to someone.\u201dYue Zhishi thought about what he\u2019d seen under the school building. \u201cDid you lend it to that girl? You only had one umbrella, and yet you still gave it to her.\u201dIf I\u2019d known, I would\u2019ve gone to pick you up.\u201cI don\u2019t want to share an umbrella with other people.\u201d The crowd of people slightly shifted upwards. Song Yu then said, \u201cShe\u2019s a classmate in the same group as me. There were some issues in our data collection, so she wanted to discuss it with me.\u201dSo that\u2019s what happened. Yue Zhishi nodded. \u201cThen next time don\u2019t lend out your umbrella. Ah, no, that\u2019s not good.\u201d He himself felt that suggestion wasn\u2019t too chivalrous, so he changed what he was about to say. \u201cIf you\u2019d called out to me, I would\u2019ve stopped running. You wouldn\u2019t have gotten wet.\u201dSong Yu wanted to say something, his lips moving, but he decided to give it up. He felt like Yue Zhishi might not even understand himself, so there was no need to confuse him even more.They lined up to buy two portions of pineapple rice, and then they went to other windows to buy\u00a0steamed Wuchang-style fish,\u00a0water spinach with minced garlic\u00a0and sweet and sour pork. They took them all back to Song Yu\u2019s dormitory.Using his already drenched body as an excuse, Song Yu told Yue Zhishi to hold his umbrella by himself, but Yue Zhishi completely refused, insisting on sticking next to Song Yu. So Song Yu, who\u2019d said he wasn\u2019t willing to share an umbrella with others, actively chose to lift up the umbrella, even though most of the clear umbrella was mainly tilted towards Yue Zhishi\u2019s side.After Yue Zhishi noticed, he pushed Song Yu\u2019s wrist, but it wasn\u2019t all that effective \u2014 after a little while, the umbrella naturally crept over again, as if it was some kind of unreasonable set routine.There were more and more puddles of water, and even though none of them were higher than their ankles, Yue Zhishi\u2019s pants were already wet to his knees. He jokingly called it the\u00a0capillary effect. A quickly moving girl passed by ahead of them, one hand supporting an umbrella and her other hand holding a big bag of fruit. She used only her ring finger and pinky to carry a bowl of beef noodles, and it all looked very precarious, very dangerous \u2014 and yet everything stayed securely in place.When it rained, people would always become very interesting. They walked around and around, and Yue Zhishi complained to Song Yu that he\u2019d almost gotten lost when he first arrived. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come in through the main entrance. I walked really far and got really confused, I later found an older sister near the old science building to point me in the right direction.\u201dAs he spoke, a car flew past. Yue Zhishi could see the incoming splashes, but he didn\u2019t manage to dodge in time. He only felt his waist being pulled, his entire body dragged over, and then he completely escaped the water.The car was already very far away.Song Yu\u2019s hand didn\u2019t drop away in time, and it still rested on Yue Zhishi\u2019s waist. He turned around to look at that car, and then he turned back around, his mind still on what Yue Zhishi had just been complaining about. \u201cYou even managed to get lost on Cherry Blossom Avenue.\u201dMaybe because his words held the slightest hint of ridicule, but Yue Zhishi\u2019s ear was a bit warm. He lowered his eyes and weakly said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell which one is Cherry Blossom Avenue when there aren\u2019t any cherry blossoms. It looks the same as any other road.\u201dSong Yu felt there was a bit of logic in his words, so he didn\u2019t bother to retort. He only then realised the position of his hand wasn\u2019t quite right, so he lowered it while pretending nothing had happened. \u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019re almost there.\u201dThe dormitory building was older than Yue Zhishi had imagined. He used to think Song Yu, with his obsession with cleanliness, wouldn\u2019t really want to live in a dorm and might even go home often when he couldn\u2019t get used to living there. But this thought very quickly disappeared in smoke.Song Yu greeted the auntie in charge of the building and brought Yue Zhishi upstairs. The light in the building wasn\u2019t quite bright enough, but as soon as he opened his dorm room, the south-facing room still looked bright and spacious. There was no one else in the room. Yue Zhishi walked in, looking left and looking right, and then finally stared at their window. He really liked it \u2014 fresh greenery, soaked with rain, lay outside their window.He could immediately tell which was Song Yu\u2019s desk. It was as clean and fastidious as he always kept his desks. \u201cIs this your bed?\u201d Yue Zhishi raised his head to look at it, the bed linen pretty much the same as the ones he used at home, all of them a very cool, dark grey colour.\u201cMn.\u201d Song Yu placed down their items. His clothes were so wet they stuck onto his body, so he went into his closet to find two outfits, giving one of them to Yue Zhishi. \u201cEverything\u2019s new, I haven\u2019t worn them before. You can change into them later.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay even if you\u2019ve worn them before.\u201d Yue Zhishi scooped up a bit of the pineapple rice into his mouth. The rice was moist and sticky, and there were even pieces of nuts and raisins. \u201cThis one\u2019s really yummy, it\u2019s a bit sweet.\u201d He picked up a bit and sent it across to Song Yu\u2019s mouth. \u201cHave some.\u201dSong Yu took a bite, but then he frowned, looking as if he didn\u2019t really like it. Yue Zhishi thought it was strange. \u201cWhy\u2019d you buy it if you don\u2019t like it?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t tried it before. There\u2019s always a line in front of this stall, and everyone always says it\u2019s good,\u201d Song Yu carelessly said, and then he went into the bathroom with his clothes.Haven\u2019t tried it before.Yue Zhishi lowered his head to look at the pineapple rice, jabbing it twice with his spoon \u2014 something flashed across his heart and disappeared.Taking the chance while Song Yu was showering, Yue Zhishi sent a message to Lin Rong, asking if she was already on the train. He didn\u2019t get an immediate reply, but the other phone on the desk vibrated, the screen lighting up. It was Song Yu\u2019s phone. Yue Zhishi accidentally saw the content on the screen.[Daisyyy: Song Yu, I left your umbrella on your seat, thank you. I bought you a cup of milk tea too, remember to drink it.]That sense of feeling uncomfortable once again flooded back, like rain that never truly went away. Yue Zhishi pressed the lock button for Song Yu, and the screen turned black. He looked around the surface of the desk, wanting to find something to do, so he turned around and placed the wet cap and umbrella nearby to dry. He then opened his schoolbag and pulled out the salted-egg puffs and flower pastries Lin Rong had stuffed inside, separating them out portion by portion before he placed them onto the desks of Song Yu\u2019s roommates.Having finished giving the items away, he then grabbed the takeaway food and arranged them for eating; he also poured a cup of steamy hot soup for Song Yu into the insulation container\u2019s cap. He flicked his head over and saw the flowers he\u2019d bought were hanging from a chair \u2014 Yue Zhishi pulled them out of the bag, shook off the water droplets on them, and displayed them on the wall in front of Song Yu\u2019s desk.The flowers looked very out of place, but they looked very warm and comfortable.After taking a photo, he sent it across to Lin Rong. As he stared at the chat between him and Lin Rong, Yue Zhishi once again thought about that message, but this time his focus shifted, thinking only that Song Yu was very amazing. He could clearly remember who was who, and didn\u2019t need to change the display names at all.Song Yu came out from the bathroom, and his entire body was still wet \u2014 except this time, hot steam was diffusing from him. He changed into some white coloured clothes, and they greatly softened his entire person.He saw Yue Zhishi sitting in front of his own desk. Two pairs of chopsticks were already separated and sitting next to the bowls, ready to use. The food was laid out very neatly on the desk, and pastries were on every single one of his roommates\u2019 desks.He\u2019d never once thought of this scene \u2014 a very subtle sense of pleasure emerged. Song Yu stood in the doorway of the bathroom and was lost in a daze for a little while.\u201cYou\u2019ve finished showering?\u201d Yue Zhishi turned around first, smiling at him. \u201cHurry and come eat.\u201dSong Yu rubbed his hair with a towel. \u201cDo you want to shower?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hungry, I want to eat something first before showering.\u201d Yue Zhishi asked if they could borrow a roommate\u2019s chair. Song Yu nodded and grabbed the chair across from them, placing it next to Yue Zhishi and sitting in it.Yue Zhishi pushed the soup until it was in front of Song Yu. \u201cDrink it while it\u2019s still hot so you won\u2019t catch a cold.\u201d There was very little logical science behind his words, but Song Yu still did it, lowering his head to drink the soup his mother had made for him while he listened to Yue Zhishi chatter about stuff that had happened to him at school.\u201cPeiya\u2019s about to celebrate its 70th anniversary. Everyone\u2019s preparing for it right now, so every day has been really lively. You should come by and see.\u201d Yue Zhishi greatly enjoyed his food. His entire journey here had made him tired and hungry, and with his mood swinging up and down, the delicious food was there to act as his comfort.Song Yu placed a piece of sweet and sour pork in his bowl. \u201cAre you guys participating too?\u201d\u201cNo way, we\u2019re already in third year. There\u2019s only one more month until college entrance exams.\u201d Yue Zhishi gave up all his manners and slouched against the chair as he finished speaking. \u201cSo tired. I feel like it\u2019s been a long time since I had a break. I don\u2019t get enough sleep every night. I almost fell asleep during yesterday\u2019s monthly literature exam.\u201dSong Yu could pretty much imagine the entire scene \u2014 the exam paper might even have Yue Zhishi\u2019s careless splotches of ink on it. It should\u2019ve been very funny, but he still seriously asked, \u201cHow did the exam go?\u201dYue Zhishi came back alive, sitting up straight as he drank a big mouthful of soup. \u201cIt was okay, it wasn\u2019t hard.\u201d As one of the few boys studying liberal arts in his year, Yue Zhishi\u2019s grades were still near the top. He was about to graduate, and he had still yet to change his preference for studying in the corridor. Sometimes he would stay there as he ate dinner, sometimes he would go there after the night self-study session \u2014 even when he didn\u2019t want to study, he would still sit there for a little while.These days, he wouldn\u2019t sit on a chair in the corridor and read manga. There also wouldn\u2019t be anyone who would run over there to pick him up.\u201cI want to come to Wuhan U too,\u201d he abruptly said, feeling like there was no lead up to his sentence.Song Yu lifted his head, giving him a glance, and then lowered his eyes again as he cleaned up his bowl and chopsticks. \u201cYou can look at other schools and majors.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t really like this reply from Song Yu. It felt like he was still a child in Song Yu\u2019s eyes, as if he said everything based on impulse. But he also understood, no matter what, Song Yu would never say to him, sure, I\u2019ll be really happy if you came.He saw Song Yu\u2019s phone screen light up again, so he tried changing the topic.\u201cYour phone vibrated earlier when you were showering. I think someone messaged you.\u201d Yue Zhishi pretended to act like he didn\u2019t see the content at all, that he was only simply prompting Song Yu.Song Yu made a noise in response, but he looked like he didn\u2019t plan on opening his phone to have a look.\u201cYou\u2019re not looking at it?\u201d Yue Zhishi frowned.\u201cMaybe later.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t know what was pushing him on, but he said it anyway \u2014 \u201cThat girl who borrowed your umbrella, she bought milk tea for you and told you to drink it.\u201dHe regretted it the moment the words left his mouth. One reason was because he exposed the fact he\u2019d seen the messages, even if he didn\u2019t mean to, and the second reason was because the tone of his voice was truly too strange.Song Yu\u2019s eyebrows slightly wrinkled, and he stared at Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201dHe\u2019d turned and run away after seeing him, and now he was so clinging so stubbornly onto one message.Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t answer his question. He blinked, and then suddenly didn\u2019t really want to talk anymore.The rain grew worse the longer it fell.\u201cI\u2019m full.\u201d He rose up from his chair. \u201cCan I go shower?\u201dOf course Song Yu wouldn\u2019t say no \u2014 he didn\u2019t continue questioning him. He took Yue Zhishi into the bathroom, gave him the slippers he himself had worn as he showered and told him which direction to turn the knob for hot water. He finally taught him how to manage the very difficult to use hair dryer.\u201cThis belongs to one of my roommate. It\u2019s a bit fiddly, remember to wrap the cord around the bottom when you hold it.\u201dYue Zhishi said he understood, but he wasn\u2019t really listening. The bathroom was very narrow, the two of them a bit crowded together as they stood inside. Yue Zhishi turned to turn on the shower, but the direction of the shower head was a bit off: the water poured directly onto his body. He retreated half a step backwards in a fluster, grabbing the hem of his shirt and pulling it off.He entirely forgot Song Yu was still behind him.His back was very pale, very skinny, and his waist was skinnier than Song Yu had imagined. He looked a bit taller than he used to be, but his frame was still a youth\u2019s frame \u2014 slender wrists and ankles, as if they would snap as soon as they were twisted. Realising he was staring, Song Yu twisted his face away, but at that very moment, Yue Zhishi stepped on something, slipped and fell backwards.Luckily, Song Yu caught him just in time and held onto his arms.Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart had leaped in fear.\u201cI\u2019m okay, I\u2019m okay.\u201d Yue Zhishi placed his palm against the wall and stood securely. \u201cThis pair of slippers is a bit slippery.\u201d\u201cBe careful.\u201d Song Yu opened his hands. He realised he held on too tightly \u2014 in such a short amount of time, he had left a red mark on the back of Yue Zhishi\u2019s arms. He didn\u2019t look at Yue Zhishi anymore and turned himself around. \u201cI\u2019m going out. Go shower.\u201dEven though the bathroom didn\u2019t look that nice, the water temperature was very comfortable. It was similar to the temperature he used at home, and Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t need to fiddle with it. He was a bit distracted as he showered. He kept thinking of how Song Yu had looked like when he was speaking with someone else, and he felt like he was being a bit irrational. It felt like he didn\u2019t want Song Yu to speak to anyone else.But he wanted Song Yu to have a good relationship with his roommates; he hoped his life went smoothly every day.His thoughts twisted in circles until they finally turned into a tight, secure knot. Yue Zhishi felt a bit dizzy as he continued showering, so he very quickly washed away the suds on his body.Song Yu had given him a sea blue t-shirt. There was nothing on the front, and he even thought he\u2019d put it on inside out. When he flipped it out, there was a block of cheese printed on the reverse side, and it looked like the block of cheese on Tom and Jerry. Yue Zhishi pulled it on \u2014 it was very large, very oversized, and half of his shoulder was exposed just by tugging at the neckline. He gazed at himself in the mirror. This colour made him look even paler.But the pants were too large. Yue Zhishi bent over, looking at the loose pant legs, and rolled up the hem a few times before he got up and grabbed the hair dryer, turning it on.Song Yu had just finished cleaning up his desk when he heard the sound of the hair dryer from the bathroom. The noise came on and off sporadically, and he knew there had been no point in him teaching Yue Zhishi how to use it. He stood in place, not heading over, and waited for three seconds; as expected, the bathroom door opened, and Yue Zhishi peeked out with his damp hair, a bit of embarrassment on his face.\u201cGege, I still don\u2019t know how to use the hair dryer.\u201dAt the end, Song Yu still ended up blowing dry his hair. Yue Zhishi obediently sat on a chair, his eyes closed, and left Song Yu to mess up his hair however he wanted. Song Yu\u2019s fingers were very long, and the feeling of them combing through his hair was very comfortable. It created a sense of security, of safety, that Yue Zhishi felt he could rely on.\u201cYour previous hair dye\u2019s gone.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s hand twirled his brown strands of hair. He thought of one time he\u2019d gone home and realised Yue Zhishi had dyed his hair black. He had looked a bit unlike himself, but Song Yu hadn\u2019t asked much at that time, thinking it was only a child\u2019s passing fancy.\u201cMm.\u201d Yue Zhishi lowered his head. \u201cEven if it didn\u2019t fade away, it would\u2019ve been cut off anyway. My hair grows too quickly.\u201dHe thought about it \u2014 from when he started high school to now, the most rebellious thing he\u2019d done in the last three years was only to dye his hair black once.His excuse had been even more bizarre. It was only because last semester, when Song Yu had attended his parent-teacher meeting, too many people had said the exact same thing to him.You and your gege don\u2019t look similar at all.That day had even been his eighteenth birthday.\u201cDon\u2019t dye it anymore, it\u2019s quite nice this way.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s hand accidentally touched Yue Zhishi\u2019s long nape. A small, inconspicuous mole grew there, and most likely even Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know he had one there.He used to occasionally stare at that mole in a daze, and when Yue Zhishi had sometimes caught him looking, Yue Zhishi would laugh and ask if he\u2019d taped a piece of paper on his back and why he kept staring at it.Song Yu didn\u2019t have a habit of pranking people \u2014 he only held a strange yet complicated emotion towards this natural mark.Such as a desire to possess.\u201cDo you think I don\u2019t look good in black hair?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s phone on the table started vibrating for a long time just as the question left Yue Zhishi\u2019s mouth. Yue Zhishi helped him grab it, passing it behind his back.Song Yu\u2019s thoughts were interrupted. He picked up his phone \u2014 it was the dormitory head\u2019s phone call, so he turned off the hair dryer and accepted the call.\u201cHe\u2019s already here, he\u2019s in the dorm right now. Yes. I know, I\u2019ll tell him to go back in a little bit.\u201dSitting on the chair, Yue Zhishi heard that sentence and immediately spun over, shaking his head at Song Yu. The person on the other side of the call seemed to be saying something, so Song Yu walked towards the window and looked outside.\u201cIt\u2019s already flooded?\u201d Song Yu paused, and then, his voice very low, as if speaking to himself, \u201cThen how will he leave\u2026\u201dYue Zhishi inexplicably cheered up a bit as he heard those words. He relaxed.Song Yu hung up the call without speaking too much. The roommates\u2019 group chat sent over two videos: one was the flooded subway station, and the other was the rain that even umbrellas could no longer hold back.[Chen Fangyuan: Our annual sea view came early. Comrades, we once again have an ocean view house.]\u201cHas outside flooded really terribly?\u201d Yue Zhishi also stood up, and he ran to the window to have a look. The rain truly had increased.\u201cMm, it\u2019s a level red warning today. It might flood out like before, and then it\u2019ll be really inconvenient to go out.\u201d\u201cThen I might not be able to go back today.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice was a bit too obvious with its utter lack of regret for not being able to go home, and it held an unmistakable joy. But as soon as he turned around, he saw Song Yu lifting up his school bag. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dHe sounded like a child who\u2019d had his snacks taken away from him right in front of his face.Song Yu pulled open the zipper, checking inside to see if there was anything left behind. But he abruptly noticed \u2014 in this black schoolbag, the name badge he\u2019d carelessly given to Yue Zhishi was pinned to the inside.The moment he saw his name, he found himself at a loss.\u201cGege.\u201dHearing Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice, Song Yu\u2019s attention returned, and he placed down the bag. \u201cSince the subway\u2019s flooded, it won\u2019t be safe either in a car. I don\u2019t have anywhere for you to sleep here, but there\u2019s a few hotels nearby. I\u2019ll see if I can book one for you.\u201dA blinding white light suddenly flashed outside the window. Yue Zhishi had suffered through this too many times, and his body\u2019s instinctive reaction was to cover his ears. In the next moment, a tremendous crack of thunder rang through the sky.Song Yu saw his shoulders shaking, and yet he still grabbed his phone, preparing to book Yue Zhishi a hotel.Yue Zhishi was very upset seeing him act like that. It felt like he\u2019d run to all different kinds of fruit stores to finally find a crisp peach, and when he bit down, full of expectation, the peach turned out to be soft.But he had been the one who\u2019d wanted to come \u2014 just like he\u2019d been the one to buy the peach.He needed to eat it entirely, and yet each mouthful was full of discouragement.Since it was currently a school break, all of the hotels nearby the university were already very hard to book, and it was even harder with the special weather the last few days. Song Yu checked a few good quality hotels, and pretty much all of them were fully booked. He didn\u2019t want to even check hotels with a slightly lower quality, and when he thought about the environment of those hotels, he didn\u2019t want to send Yue Zhishi over at all.Especially since his body was still so sensitive.As he thought about how the bedsheets in the hotels might not be clean enough, and how they might even smell of cigarette smoke, Song Yu thought, if he told Yue Zhishi to live there by himself, it might be Song Yu himself who tossed and turned and was unable to sleep all night.His wrist was suddenly grasped just as he was struggling with what to do. Yue Zhishi had arrived in front in him. He wore the shirt Song Yu had bought and yet had never worn, and the body wash fragrance diffusing from his body was the same as his. His hair was soft and smooth, his gaze innocent.In a very soft voice, he said, \u201cGege, I don\u2019t want to stay outside.\u201dThe hand surrounding Song Yu\u2019s wrist was pale enough that he could see Yue Zhishi\u2019s veins as they throbbed up and down, full of life. Song Yu knew very well \u2014 this kind of skin would turn red and would turn warm at the merest chafing. Just like when he was younger, at the slightest cry, Yue Zhishi\u2019s face would turn red just like a fragile peach.\u201cIt\u2019s thundering outside. I won\u2019t be able to sleep.\u201d He used the excuse Song Yu could never reject, just like the first time he\u2019d intruded into his room. But compared to the painful crying of his childhood, the way he requested it now seemed to make it even harder for Song Yu to deny him.He seemed to be even better now at guessing Song Yu\u2019s thoughts than when he was a child \u2014 he simply stretched out a hand, and he was able to touch Song Yu\u2019s weak spot.Yue Zhishi gazed at him, that pair of large yet beautiful eyes full of pleading but also full of some kind of other emotion that could give someone a wrong impression.\u201cCan I stay here? Just one night.\u201dThe author has something to say:Say yes!Something that can be easily overlooked is gege\u2019s love~Some sisters said gege\u2019s too cold. He truly isn\u2019t, when you compare how he treats other people with how he treats Le Le. It\u2019s called restraint. To me, the charm of an older gong in a situation like this is in his restraint \u2014 if he can\u2019t even control his own emotions, then he would have an unfair advantage due to his guidance of the younger person. He would affect the younger person\u2019s choices, and that, to me, would completely lose the charm of having an older gong. The ways he treats Le Le well are all in the details. In choosing to not express his love, he is taking responsibility for and protecting Lele, especially after seeing a failed example. Especially since their relationship is so similar to a relationship between brothers. If he chose to directly express it, and then they later face dangers or difficulties, who will bear the burden for that? Would he be willing for Yue Zhishi to suffer through Xu Qichen\u2019s experience? After all, Le Le still has yet to go through his college entrance exams.I feel like questions like \u201cwill they still be like this after they get together\u201d are very strange. Clearly they won\u2019t, Song Yu is already like this before he\u2019s even felt Le Le\u2019s arrow \u2014 he\u2019s only bearing it and not expressing himself because he wants to protect the relationship between them. He\u2019ll love Le Le up to the heavens when they\u2019re together.Refusing to allow the person you like to get close to you doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love them. But if someone treats you, the person they like, with despicable behaviour, then no matter what they do, that\u2019s not called \u2018being cool\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s called \u2018they don\u2019t love you\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He released his hands and went back to sit in Song Yu\u2019s seat with his schoolbag, his face full of joy. He asked Song Yu if he had anything he needed to do that afternoon, and if he would be bothering him.Song Yu shook his head. \u201cHave you finished your homework?\u201d\u201cFinished it ages ago.\u201d Yue Zhishi said to him, \u201cI\u2019ve even memorised all my texts already, I prepared before I came. I\u2019ve even brought my review work over so I can look through them tonight.\u201dHaving learned yesterday that Lin Rong needed him to help bring things over, he started finishing his homework early and was even working on it earlier that day during class before the monthly break started. He was someone with a very high efficiency rate once he focused on something, and just by thinking he was coming to see Song Yu, the strength of his concentration pretty much doubled.Song Yu nodded. He kept hearing Yue Zhishi\u2019s phone vibrating, so he prompted him before saying he need to go downstairs to buy some things.Thunder crashed once again outside, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulders unconsciously shook. He checked the messages on his phone, and then he lifted his head to Song Yu, saying, \u201cCan I go down with you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s raining too hard outside.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi waved his phone at him. \u201cCan I play games for a bit? A classmate\u2019s asking me to join him, and I\u2019ll be able to distract myself.\u201dFair enough, thunder was still ringing outside. Song Yu nodded, but he couldn\u2019t help but advise, \u201cDon\u2019t play games so often.\u201d\u201cI play very rarely,\u201d Yue Zhishi explained. \u201cI\u2019m a terrible gamer, so I don\u2019t even like playing games all that much.\u201dSong Yu had already changed his shoes. He said, \u201cMm,\u201d and then grabbed the dorm\u2019s communal umbrella, heading out.Outside was even worse than he\u2019d imagined \u2014 the water had already flooded past the steps and was about to reach the access door for the dormitory\u2019s first floor. He waded out, very people left outside in the heavy wind and rain, but there were quite a few people pushing about in the university\u2019s supermarket. The storm season in this city was always very dramatic, so everyone had accumulated a lot of experience and knew to stock up their groceries.Song Yu usually tried to stay far away from crowded places like these, but he went straight in this time without thinking about it. He very quickly bought the snacks Yue Zhishi liked and could eat, a completely new set of towel, soft bristled toothbrush and slippers, and went to line up to pay.He was about to reach the front after a long time of waiting, but then he saw a girl walk past holding an ice cream Yue Zhishi had once said he liked. He left the line.When he finally returned back to the check out lines, he felt like he\u2019d added at least twenty minutes to the time he needed to spend in this supermarket. Song Yu would usually be very impatient in these types of situations, but right now, he was in a pretty good mood.His phone lit up with an unread message: a push notification from QQ. Song Yu rarely used social media apps, and especially after entering university, most of his work communications and messages had been transferred over to WeChat. He\u2019d pretty much stopped using QQ, and he\u2019d even muted all of his previous group chats.This time, he opened it because it was a push notification sent from Yue Zhishi.Song Yu had nothing to do now that he was waiting in line, so he opened up the notification \u2014 a photo. Yue Zhishi had taken a photo of his desk, and laying on top of his desk was the well-packed takeaway containers of food and the pork ribs and lotus root soup.[Yue Zhishi: Delicious! Another reason to aim for Wuhan U!]The amount of comments he received completely showed how popular Yue Zhishi was, and it was easy to see he was everyone\u2019s favourite just by how many people called him Le Le. The comments were mostly related to Wuhan U. Many of his good friends also teased him, calling him an older brother con who went straight to find his brother as soon as he had a break. As he kept scrolling, Song Yu\u2019s finger paused, one particular comment drawing his attention.[I am the god of the new world: You foodie, you went so far even in this heavy rain. Aren\u2019t you afraid of getting kidnapped halfway there? I know how to cook that fish too. I guarantee mine is better than the cafeteria\u2019s by 100 times, come to my home if you don\u2019t believe me!]Yue Zhishi replied: [Are you serious, you even know how to make steamed fish?][I am the god of the new world: Of course, I can even plate it up to look like a peacock. So cool, right? Why don\u2019t I bring some next week for you to try?]Yue Zhishi innocently agreed, even saying he really liked to eat fish.The conversation back and forth between these two became a long chain of comments, and the topic was already no longer about Yue Zhishi\u2019s photo. The other person seemed to be very chatty, quickly jumping past what they\u2019d do after going back to school to talk about a homemade mango-flavoured yoghurt drink he\u2019d found quite decent. He said he could bring it for Yue Zhishi to try, if Yue Zhishi exchanged it with the homemade cinnamon rolls he\u2019d brought last time. Yue Zhishi agreed, and from the amount of time it took for him to reply, it didn\u2019t look like he hesitated much before agreeing.After one minute, that person suggested playing games together. Yue Zhishi refused, saying he wasn\u2019t good at games at all, but the other person acted like he was very familiar with Yue Zhishi.[I am the god of the new world: I know, don\u2019t worry, big bro here will carry you up a rank, I guarantee you\u2019ll win this round of PUBG.]Thunder was rumbling outside, the dark stormy clouds bearing low onto the ground, and the entire campus was trapped into such a gloomy and depressing environment. Song Yu returned his phone back into his pocket, glancing at the line that had barely moved, and started to get irritated.One minute later, two girls came up together to Song Yu and took up the narrow aisle. One of them was holding her phone, and she bravely greeted Song Yu before asking, \u201cCan we add each other on WeChat?\u201dSong Yu looked particularly annoyed. He didn\u2019t want to deal with this at all, so he directly found an excuse to send them away. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t use WeChat.\u201dThe girl seemed to have guessed it wouldn\u2019t be so easy and wasn\u2019t too discouraged so quickly. She tried again. \u201cThen\u2026 how about QQ?\u201dSong Yu frowned and then said, his tone even more irritated, \u201cI hate that social media app the most.\u201dAt the end, he ended up wasting half an hour more than he\u2019d expected before he managed to return back to his dorm. He heard Yue Zhishi\u2019s very intense gaming reactions from inside the room as he was opening the door, saying things like damn it damn it, I just gave them a free life.It appeared the sound in his earphones was turned up very high. His elbows rested on top of the table, and he looked like he was completely separated from the rest of the world. Song Yu put the umbrella back on the rack near the door, changed his shoes and heard Yue Zhishi say to his gaming partner, \u201cWho\u2019s the little baby? Don\u2019t talk so carelessly.\u201dHis eyes were still focused on the screen, but his hands started to look a bit flustered as they moved, looking as if he was amused by his teammate. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t immediately place down his things, standing in place for a bit, and watched as Yue Zhishi seemed to completely give up. Yue Zhishi relaxed his upheld hands, complaining that his teammate had affected his play, and then after a little while, he very seriously said, \u201cDon\u2019t give people nicknames so casually, look, I just died.\u201dThe other person seemed to still be talking, so Yue Zhishi placed down his phone with a bit of spite and said, \u201cLet\u2019s see how you can win with just yourself.\u201d With his game finished, he reached up and stretched, but his gaze still rested on his phone screen as he chose to continue observing the game as a ghost.Song Yu\u2019s patience completely disappeared. He no longer wanted to wait for Yue Zhishi to notice him and went to set down the snacks and ice cream he\u2019d purchased onto the table. Without saying a single word, he grabbed out the daily personal items and headed into the bathroom.\u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201d Yue Zhishi pulled out his earphones very quickly and immediately stood up to follow behind Song Yu without noticing the ice cream. \u201cWhat\u2019d you buy? Did you buy those for me?\u201d\u201cToothbrush, towel.\u201d Song Yu arranged the toiletries, reminded him not to use the wrong ones and then turned around, walking out. He opened up the slippers, placing them next to Yue Zhishi\u2019s feet, but he didn\u2019t speak.He didn\u2019t know if he was imagining it, but Yue Zhishi felt like gege\u2019s mood seemed to be worse after going out for a bit. He didn\u2019t like it when Song Yu was in a bad mood, so to cheer him up, Yue Zhishi took the initiative to share his embarrassing story in the game just now. \u201cJust then, I thought the grenade was a smoke bomb and almost blew up my teammate. Good thing he ran away quickly.\u201dYue Zhishi actually didn\u2019t like losing, and he also didn\u2019t like being laughed at by other people. But if the other person was Song Yu, then he could accept his laughter completely \u2014 as long as Song Yu laughed.But it looked like it was useless this time.Song Yu took out a cold bottle of coke and said, his voice not having warmed up very much, \u201cReally.\u201d He leaned his head back and took a sip before he frowned. He closed the bottle and put it back on the desk.Seeing him like this, Yue Zhishi felt a bit helpless. His phone kept vibrating, messages nonstop, but he didn\u2019t have any interest in replying to them. He grabbed the ice cream Song Yu bought for him. \u201cI really like this one.\u201d After unfolding the little spoon, he scooped a bit and placed it at Song Yu\u2019s mouth. \u201cTry it.\u201dSong Yu naturally didn\u2019t eat it, just like usual. But unlike usual, he glanced at Yue Zhishi\u2019s phone before turning to look at Yue Zhishi. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see who it is?\u201dYue Zhishi took back his hand, eating that scoop of ice cream himself, and lifted up his phone to quickly reply before he placed it back down. \u201cMy teammate, he asked if I wanted to play anymore.\u201d He then added, \u201cI\u2019m not playing anymore. I kept losing, so it\u2019s not fun at all.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t respond to his words, taking the laptop on his table and putting it onto his roommate\u2019s desk across from them before he turned it on.\u201cAre you going to study?\u201d Yue Zhishi also turned over, staring at Song Yu\u2019s back. The thunder outside seemed to have paused.\u201cMn.\u201d In reality, there wasn\u2019t much left for Song Yu to do; everything that needed to be finished soon had already been completed. He originally hadn\u2019t needed to go to the research lab, but after Yue Zhishi had said he was coming over, Song Yu had showered and also gone out, wanting to use the time wisely and quickly finish his group\u2019s remaining data analysis work.He checked his email and saw a document sent by his professor. Song Yu had just started his third year of university, but because of his exceptional grades, he\u2019d been taken in early by a famous scientific researcher to foster his talent. He\u2019d entered the research lab very early and was nicknamed \u2018Master Degree Year 0 new student\u2019 by his senior brothers and sisters.After replying to his professor\u2019s email, Song Yu organised once again all the data documents he\u2019d placed on the desk and then opened the document pdf he just finished downloading.Yue Zhishi felt like he really was very busy, so he finished the ice cream by himself. He leaned on the back of Song Yu\u2019s chair, his chest to its back, and rested his chin on his arms. He stared at Song Yu\u2019s back like that without uttering a single sound, just like a little dog who was silently accompanying its owner after eating well.In the downpour, all the sun was rushed away by the storm clouds. It was clearly only 4:30pm, and yet the light was already very dim.He didn\u2019t know how much time had passed. Yue Zhishi felt like he was about to fall asleep when he abruptly heard Song Yu\u2019s voice.\u201cWho was that person gaming with you?\u201dHe sounded very casual. He didn\u2019t turn his head over either, looking like he was merely asking a random question. Yue Zhishi was also clueless \u2014 he lifted his head, sat up straight and rubbed his eyes. \u201cMy classmate.\u201d\u201cIn your particular class?\u201dYue Zhishi nodded and then, realising Song Yu might not be able to see him, said, \u201cHe sits behind me.\u201dSong Yu fell back into silence. Yue Zhishi got up from his chair and went to search through his schoolbag for his thick notebook. He pulled the chair close to Song Yu\u2019s side. \u201cCan I sit next to you while I review?\u201d\u201cYou can play games if you want. Don\u2019t mind me.\u201d Song Yu was quite indifferent. Yue Zhishi realised Song Yu was still bothered by his game playing, as if he was someone addicted to games in Song Yu\u2019s eyes.He frowned for a brief moment, and then he leaned in very closely to Song Yu, looking a bit like he wanted to cutely whine. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t like playing games that often. It\u2019s just that you weren\u2019t here. Someone asked if I wanted to play, and I only agreed to play two rounds with him because I was afraid of the thunder. If you were here, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to play at all.\u201dTo Song Yu, these words seemed to be useful \u2014 he finally turned and looked at Yue Zhishi, except his gaze still carried some doubt.\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Yue Zhishi gave his phone to Song Yu and even opened up the game for him to examine. \u201cYou can look at my rank if you don\u2019t believe me. It\u2019s super low, I\u2019ve only played a few times.\u201dThe game returned back to the home screen, and out of the two people on the opening display, one was the teammate Yue Zhishi was talking about with the ID of \u2018god of the new world\u2019. It was the person Song Yu was thinking about.Song Yu turned his face away, acting as if he wasn\u2019t interested in Yue Zhishi\u2019s game. His finger lightly slid across the touchpad on his laptop. \u201cThe most important thing for you to do right now is to study.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Yue Zhishi lowered his head and flipped open his notebook. \u201cI\u2019m studying hard every day.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t hang out so much with students who like to play games,\u201d Song Yu lectured him, very unnaturally.\u201cYou mean the one just now?\u201d Yue Zhishi was looking at his notes. He turned a page and then casually said, \u201cHis grades are pretty decent, he can sometimes get higher grades than me when he\u2019s doing really well. He\u2019s especially good at math, but his English isn\u2019t as good as mine. In the last monthly exam, he\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested in your classmate.\u201dLifting his head, Yue Zhishi looked at him and said, \u201cOh.\u201d He actually didn\u2019t want to talk about other people \u2014 he just wanted to prove his own grades were quite good by comparing them to someone else\u2019s.He saw Song Yu put in his earphones and open up the bottle of coke again. Song Yu took a large sip before placing it back on his desk.Song Yu usually didn\u2019t drink coke very often, so his intake of carbonated drinks today was slightly strange. Yue Zhishi wondered about it for a while, and then he saw the packaging of this coke bottle was different. It looked like it was cherry-flavoured. He felt this flavour was usually listed as a \u2018dark cuisine\u2019. He wanted to ask Song Yu how he felt after drinking it, but he was worried Song Yu might roll his eyes at him \u2014 so instead, he continued to study his notes.When Song Yu was about to finish the coke, Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but lift up his head and pass over a post it note with his handwriting on it. His strokes were very beautiful.[I don\u2019t like holding people back when I\u2019m playing a game with someone. Can you take me to play?]Song Yu turned his face away, holding that empty bottle of coke. Yue Zhishi pulled off one of his earphones.\u201cThat game showed me which of my QQ friends also played it, and you were listed in there. I saw your ranking \u2014 it was really high, and your statistics were also really amazing. I\u2019ve sent you some messages before, but you never replied.\u201dSong Yu put down the bottle and logged into the game with his QQ username, opening his in-game inbox.\u201cI\u2019ve been really busy this semester. I haven\u2019t been online, so I didn\u2019t receive your messages.\u201d He occasionally played a few times, but once he started getting busy, he might not be able to play at all during the semester. He had many, many messages in his inbox, and as he kept scrolling down, he saw a friend request from a QQ friend with the ID of Cheese1010. There were also many messages from him, almost all of them emoji expressions \u2014 the earliest was from three months ago, and the message contained a love heart.\u201cI know.\u201d Yue Zhishi lifted up his hand to put Song Yu\u2019s earphone back in. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t ignore me otherwise.\u201dThere was pretty much nothing left in the coke bottle. Yue Zhishi felt the cherry flavour must be very delicious if Song Yu drank so much, so when Song Yu wasn\u2019t paying attention, he took the bottle and finished the last drop.It was terrible. Yue Zhishi stuck out his tongue in disgust and threw the bottle into the bin.The author has something to say:Gege wasn\u2019t drinking iced coke, he was drinking iced mature vinegar.QQ: You said you hated me, but didn\u2019t you still scuttle and log in with me as soon as your younger brother wanted to play games with you (-\u3002-)The \u2018god of the new world\u2019 reference is from Death Note [tears of a generation]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019d thought his heavy load of schoolwork would be able to completely fill up his every day life, but reality proved otherwise \u2014 no matter how tired he had been during the day, once he lay down on his bed and closed his eyes, he still found it very difficult to fall asleep.He\u2019d been later dragged into playing the game together with a roommate. He realised it could serve as a temporary distraction, so he played for a period of time. Song Yu was very good at sniping, his in-game operation very stable, and his ranking rose very quickly. But after playing for a while, the game\u2019s ability to distract him clearly decreased, and so he no longer really wanted to play.With his head lowered, Yue Zhishi happily stared at their friend interface in the game, and he asked if Song Yu could take him as a pupil. Song Yu very quickly rejected him.\u201cWhy?\u201d Yue Zhishi thought the teacher-pupil relationship in the game was really interesting, and many people carried others like this. His classmate kept trying to tempt Yue Zhishi into taking him as his teacher, but Yue Zhishi had never once been swayed. After learning that Song Yu had played this game before, Yue Zhishi wanted to play with him only.\u201cIsn\u2019t our relationship complicated enough?\u201d Song Yu said, looking at his document.True.Yue Zhishi felt it was easier to call him gege.After ending their conversation about the game, the two of them tacitly started to sit together to study. Yue Zhishi felt like Song Yu had a magic power that could calm him down \u2014 when Yue Zhishi was next to him, as long as it wasn\u2019t thundering, he found it easier to focus on memorising his work, and his memory also improved by a fair amount.Both of them tended to forget the time after they started studying. Yue Zhishi finished his memorisation work and worked his way through some incorrect literature comprehension multiple choice questions. He lifted his head, and it was already 7:30pm.\u201cNo wonder I\u2019m a bit hungry.\u201d Yue Zhishi leaned back on the chair. \u201cIt\u2019s already past dinner time.\u201dSong Yu only then realised the time. He usually didn\u2019t eat at set times, so he too forgot about dinner. He lifted his phone and asked Yue Zhishi, \u201cWhat do you want to eat? Let\u2019s order some delivery. The rain outside still hasn\u2019t stopped, so everything nearby might already be flooded.\u201d\u201cCan the delivery come all the way in here?\u201d Yue Zhishi was doubtful. \u201cI want to eat\u00a0river snail noodle soup.\u201dSong Yu questioned his request, but Yue Zhishi really did want to eat it. \u201cThe best time to have river snail noodle soup is when it\u2019s raining. And hot pot too, that kind of hot and soupy meal is the best during rain.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of reasoning is that,\u201d he may have said, but Song Yu still sent a WeChat message to his roommate Chen Fangyuan, asking if he had any river snail noodle soup packets.[Chen Fangyuan: I finished them all already. But I still have hot and sour noodles, they\u2019re really good. I also have instant ramen noodles. They\u2019re all on my desk, feel free to take some! I have ham sausages too!]\u201cHot and sour noodles are fine too.\u201d Yue Zhishi saw the chat screen on the laptop. \u201cInstant ramen noodles should be delicious.\u201dThe word \u2018should\u2019 made Song Yu feel he was really pitiful, so he stroked Yue Zhishi\u2019s head.Yue Zhishi ate an extremely unhealthy meal as he wished: hot and sour noodles soaked until they were soft and slippery, potato chips,\u00a0hot and spicy konjac chips\u00a0and a big pile of\u00a0roasted seaweed. He was already really full, but Song Yu still forced him to eat an apple. Yue Zhishi was stuffed until he completely didn\u2019t want to move, slumping on the desk for a while.Feeling like his stomach was doing its best to digest the food, Yue Zhishi\u2019s large eyes scrolled around in every direction. The flowers he\u2019d bought that afternoon were already a bit droopy, but they were still very fragrant. Many post it notes were stuck on the wall with study notes Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t understand, and there were even some posts that looked like celestial charts and geological maps. Neatly arranged textbooks and tools were in a book shelf on the table, and there were also some typed essays.The globe he\u2019d made wasn\u2019t there, and this made Yue Zhishi a bit disappointed. But his disappointment very quickly disappeared \u2014 he thought, handmade globes weren\u2019t accurate enough, so maybe displaying it made Song Yu look like he wasn\u2019t professional.Unlike a watch that could be worn on his hand every day.His eyes continued peeping around. Yue Zhishi saw a bottle the size of his palm near the insulation container. Its packaging was all in English, and it said something something soft candy, the first word foreign to Yue Zhishi.Song Yu came out of the shower just then, and Yue Zhishi turned over and waved the bottle at him. \u201cIs this edible?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Song Yu walked over and took away the bottle from his hand, returning it to its original position. \u201cMelatonin. It\u2019s a hormone.\u201dYue Zhishi automatically classified it as a nutritional supplement. \u201cCan I eat it?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Song Yu urged him to shower, so Yue Zhishi had no choice but to move.Every time he was urged to do something, Yue Zhishi would be hit by the illusory sense of being roommates with Song Yu. This misconception very much pleased Yue Zhishi, as if they actually weren\u2019t brothers three years apart but rather people the same age \u2014 they\u2019d study together, go to school together and could even get out of bed and fall asleep together every day.He wouldn\u2019t need to wait at home every day, asking Lin Rong every week if Song Yu was coming home.After both of them finished showering, they received Lin Rong\u2019s video call, and the family of four, separated in two places, chatted for a very long time across the screen. It looked like Shanghai was also storming, and with Song Jin\u2019s work temporarily cancelled, the two of them could only stay in their hotel and enjoy the river view. Song Jin joked that this was the rain the heavens prepared for their honeymoon and was pushed out of the view of the screen by Lin Rong.Yue Zhishi also felt this rain was very coincidental, or else he might already be home by now. There would have been only been one person, one cat and one dog, more forlorn and desolate than anything else.He glanced at Song Yu and thought he was even more lonely \u2014 he didn\u2019t have a cat or a dog.After hanging up the phone, Song Yu started urging him again, this time to sleep.\u201cWeren\u2019t you saying you were sleep deprived? You can catch up on sleep today.\u201dTheir dormitory was the classic four-person room with the bed at the top and desk down below. Song Yu told Yue Zhishi to go up and sleep in his bed since he used the same bed linen brand as the ones used at home. There shouldn\u2019t be anything Yue Zhishi was allergic to.Yue Zhishi obediently climbed into bed, and his phone was also taken away by Song Yu. The aircon was turned on, and he crawled under the blanket \u2014 in that moment, Song Yu\u2019s familiar scent wrapped around him, creating an illusion that he could sink and infinitely fall into the softness of the bed. For a moment, he hoped he could remain forever buried here, where no one except Song Yu could find him.The college entrance exams were very stressful, and studying was very tiring. He wanted to hide away under Song Yu\u2019s blanket.\u201cI\u2019m turning off the lights.\u201d The lights in the dorm turned off as soon as Song Yu finished speaking. The darkness was like an even larger blanket falling down on him at a very quick speed to wrap around him. Yue Zhishi consciously shifted in towards the wall, leaving some space for Song Yu.But he waited for a long time, and Song Yu still didn\u2019t come up. He patiently waited for a little while longer and then, thinking a long amount of time had passed, couldn\u2019t help but lean against the bed railing and look down. He saw Song Yu quietly sitting at the desk, reading a book.\u201cAren\u2019t you sleeping?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked. \u201cIt\u2019s already 10pm.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sleepy,\u201d Song Yu said. \u201cYou should sleep first.\u201d He then added, \u201cI\u2019ve already discussed it with my roommate, I\u2019ll sleep in his bed.\u201dYue Zhishi was incredibly disappointed. The wall he\u2019d tightly stuck to and the space he\u2019d left for Song Yu were instantaneously made meaningless.He didn\u2019t respond.The two of them were silent for a while, and Yue Zhishi finally surrendered, flipping over and facing the wall to pretend he was already sleeping. But he heard the sound of Song Yu turning off the desk light and also heard Song Yu climbing up into another bed.He silently consoled himself \u2014 this bed really was too small. Between being in an unclean bed or being forced into a tight and cramped space, maybe Song Yu only chose the option he could tolerate for longer.The dark room was extraordinarily silent, and as Yue Zhishi kept persuading himself, he hazily fell into sleep. But just as he was in between sleep and consciousness, a white light flashed across outside the window, brightening up the room. A short moment later, a heavy crack of thunder sounded and shocked Yue Zhishi awake.His reaction as he woke up was very loud. Song Yu immediately flipped and came over, thinking Yue Zhishi had fallen down. \u201cYue Zhishi?\u201d\u201cMm\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice was very weak, giving off the feeling as if he was covered in cold sweat while sick. But he hadn\u2019t fallen down, only covering his head with the blanket. His voice came out muffled and unclear. \u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026\u201dHe actually had always felt it was really embarrassing to tell other people he was still afraid of thunder at eighteen years old. He needed to train away his fear, and since he had fallen asleep just then, Yue Zhishi wanted to try to sleep again even though he was shocked enough to be covered in cold sweat.But this thunder wouldn\u2019t stop just because Yue Zhishi wanted it to stop. The most frightening thing about the thunder was that you could sense its frequency \u2014 you knew it was going to happen again very quickly, so it kept you anxious and uneasy, unable to relax.After the thunder crashed three times, Yue Zhishi wanted to beg Song Yu to stay with him for a bit. He stretched out a hand outside the blanket, wanting to hold onto the railing as he got up.But unexpectedly, the hand he stretched out was tightly caught.Yue Zhishi moved away a corner of the blanket in confusion, his eyes peering out to look down, and saw Song Yu already standing under the bed.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Song Yu very lightly squeezed his fingertips. \u201cYour hand\u2019s really cold.\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head, but another crack of thunder struck, his hand helplessly drawing back under the blanket. He was already so terrified, and Song Yu was already used to seeing him crying in fear \u2014 so Yue Zhishi felt there was no need for him to continue pretending to be strong.\u201cI can\u2019t really sleep.\u201d He didn\u2019t say he was afraid. \u201cCan you come up and stay with me for a bit?\u201dIn the darkness, he thought he heard Song Yu sigh, very softly. Maybe he heard wrongly, because Song Yu still came up. Yue Zhishi felt a bit better, and he squeezed himself against the wall with all his might, hoping that when Song Yu finally lay down, Song Yu would feel Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t actually take up that much space.But reality proved that the bed was truly too small for two guys \u2014 especially when Song Yu was a tall 186cm.\u201cAm I crowding you?\u201d Yue Zhishi sounded a bit apologetic, completely not daring to lean on Song Yu at all in fear of him thinking it was too cramped.Song Yu said no, and then he said, \u201cYou\u2019re very skinny.\u201dYue Zhishi only then relaxed, and he stretched out a hand to pull Song Yu under the blanket. The space was very small \u2014 the two of them couldn\u2019t lie on their backs at all and could only sleep on their sides. Song Yu lay on his side with his back facing Yue Zhishi, silent. Yue Zhishi turned the same direction as Song Yu, his back resting against the wall, and faced Song Yu\u2019s broad back. The space he\u2019d emptied out for Song Yu was filled to the brim, and it was like the heat diffusing from Song Yu\u2019s back included some kind of healing substance. He couldn\u2019t see it, couldn\u2019t touch it, but it made Yue Zhishi feel very reassured.They were like two croissants in a sealed bag. If he lost Song Yu, Yue Zhishi would feel like he was about to fall into danger, into great insecurity.The older he was, the more he knew this anxiety wasn\u2019t quite right. It was an incorrect anxiety. He\u2019d been taught to be an independent person, and he\u2019d tried his best to be one.But if Song Yu was by his side, he still couldn\u2019t help but draw near \u2014 and only then could he slightly relieve this trying, difficult to bear anxiety.The sounds of rain and thunder mixed together, and they were essential elements in Yue Zhishi\u2019s familiar memories. In his memories of being woken up as a child, he\u2019d clung to Song Yu just like this, always not allowed to hug him.So Yue Zhishi placed his forehead onto Song Yu\u2019s back, just like when he was a child.They hadn\u2019t been this close to each other in a very long time. Yue Zhishi thought he could feel Song Yu\u2019s heart beating, again and again, slowly and silently thumping against his muscles and bones. His mind and heart calmed down, but Yue Zhishi\u2019s thoughts were still wildly flying, unconsciously returning to that night Song Yu had finished his college entrance exams. He thought about how it\u2019d felt to be hugged by Song Yu after he\u2019d fallen asleep.That experience seemed to have been embedded in his body, hidden away \u2014 and it was only when he was so close to Song Yu that it would be accidentally triggered, reappearing again and breeding some kind of anticipation.He had no way of controlling any of these feelings.Song Yu didn\u2019t move at all, and he also didn\u2019t speak, as if he really was only there to accompany Yue Zhishi for a little while. As soon as he thought Song Yu might leave once he fell asleep, all of Yue Zhishi\u2019s sleepiness completely disappeared.Thunder boomed again and again, and Yue Zhishi gradually retreated back into the blanket. Song Yu couldn\u2019t help but remind him, \u201cDon\u2019t cover your head with the blanket, it\u2019s not good for your breathing.\u201dOnly then did Yue Zhishi meekly shift back up, once again putting his forehead onto Song Yu\u2019s body.\u201cAre you going to fall down?\u201d he asked Song Yu.Song Yu replied very quickly, \u201cNo.\u201dYue Zhishi then said, \u201cSleep if you\u2019re sleepy, you don\u2019t need to care about me.\u201dSong Yu was quiet for a few moments, and then: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have come up if I didn\u2019t care about you.\u201dGood point.\u201cAre you finding it hard to sleep?\u201d Song Yu spoke again after a long time, his voice sounding a bit awkward. \u201cIf you\u2019re scared, you can lean on me.\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Yue Zhishi very obediently rested against him, his chin placed on Song Yu\u2019s shoulder. He felt really comfortable like this, and his nose exhaled a breath in satisfaction.And then Song Yu\u2019s head slightly jerked, dodging away to the front.Yue Zhishi actually really wanted to sleep, but whenever he closed his eyes, flashes of lightning would light up the room and awaken many of his memories \u2014 such as Song Yu wanting to send him away to a hotel, and Song Yu resting his hand against his in the cafeteria.And the memory of him talking to that girl.This was even more self-indulgent than begging Song Yu to stay with him until he slept, but Yue Zhishi really did not like it when he spoke to other people.The sounds of thunder was unstoppable, just like the tug of war between an inexplicable sense of loss and his weak willpower in the midst of the heavy rain.Just as Song Yu was staring at the pattern on his roommate\u2019s bed curtain across from him in a daze, he heard Yue Zhishi open his mouth, very abruptly.\u201cAunt Rong said the reason why you weren\u2019t coming home might be because you have a girlfriend.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s heart sank, and then he denied, \u201cI don\u2019t have one. It\u2019s just because I\u2019m a bit busy.\u201dHe again heard Yue Zhishi say, \u201cI only turned and ran away because I thought about what she said. I thought you were on a date and didn\u2019t want to bother you.\u201d He then added, \u201cI would be a bit unnecessary if I showed up then.\u201dSong Yu was already very used to Yue Zhishi\u2019s straightforwardness. He only thought it was a bit funny \u2014 at that time, he\u2019d only replied a few times, nodding at the most, and his actions were interpreted into something like this.\u201cYou think me standing twenty centimetres away while I spoke is dating?\u201d\u201cThen what do you think dating should be like?\u201dSong Yu stopped speaking. After a long while, he repeated his earlier statement, \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m not dating.\u201dYue Zhishi very lightly said okay, but he couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cThe girls and boys who are dating in my year, they\u2019re always chatting to each other. They talk online, and then they continue talking even when they see each other.\u201dSong Yu felt Yue Zhishi still didn\u2019t believe him, and being misunderstood as being in a relationship just by talking to someone was too absurd. \u201cIt would be a bit more logical if you saw me hugging someone and then thought I was in a relationship.\u201dYue Zhishi said, his voice muffled, really?Song Yu was about to say yes, but then he heard Yue Zhishi say, \u201cThat kind of reasoning isn\u2019t reliable. You\u2019ve hugged me before.\u201dSong Yu almost laughed when he heard this \u2014 he felt Yue Zhishi\u2019s competitive heart was sometimes very strange. \u201cUsing examples from when we were younger is sophistry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not talking about when we were younger,\u201d Yue Zhishi very quickly retorted. He seemed to feel speaking to Song Yu\u2019s back contained very little convincing power, so he pulled Song Yu over, getting him to lay and face him directly.In the dark, Song Yu could see his eyes \u2014 the slight glimmers from outside reaching in and illuminating his eyes. His stubborn face was astonishingly good-looking.\u201cThat night I fell asleep while watching a documentary in your room after you finished your college entrance exams. That night you gave me your name badge \u2014 in the middle of the night, you turned over and pulled me into your arms.\u201dSolely just to demonstrate what happened, Yue Zhishi pulled open Song Yu\u2019s arms. He burrowed his way in and buried his head into Song Yu\u2019s chest.\u201cJust like this.\u201dThe author has something to say:You set yourself up for that, S.Yu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But after he finished moving into Song Yu\u2019s arms and heard his heartbeats, Yue Zhishi was shocked awake, thinking he\u2019d gone crazy.The thunder crashed again, and Yue Zhishi, who\u2019d initially wanted to retreat, subconsciously clutched onto Song Yu\u2019s clothes.He heard Song Yu\u2019s voice, filled with confusion.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dSure enough, he didn\u2019t remember.For no reason at all, Yue Zhishi was unwilling to accept it. Actually, to them, hugging wasn\u2019t a big deal; Song Yu had often hugged him when they were younger. When it heavily rained during elementary school, Song Yu, who was also a child, would carry him up and let him wrap around him like a koala \u2014 that way, he wouldn\u2019t step into the rain water.And even though he hadn\u2019t been allowed to hug him while they slept when it was thundering, whenever he was upset, Song Yu would actively wrap his arms around him. An embrace was a kind of silent comfort.Yue Zhishi was already used to all of this, and yet he couldn\u2019t forget about Song Yu\u2019s mutual embrace while he was deeply asleep.He clearly was the one who\u2019d been hugged, but the one who actually did it didn\u2019t remember anything at all.If it was someone else next to him, would he still have turned around and pulled them into his arms?\u201cI\u2019m not lying, it was exactly like this.\u201d Yue Zhishi repeated, a bit obstinately. His head was snuggled into Song Yu\u2019s chest, and he lifted it up, looking at Song Yu\u2019s eyes.They were very close. Even though they were in the dark, he could still faintly see Song Yu\u2019s face, and he could feel him frowning.\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were lying.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s heart was beating faster than Yue Zhishi had imagined, the reverberations magnified in the night. \u201cI just don\u2019t remember something like that happening.\u201dHe paused, and then he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t paying attention when I was sleeping.\u201dYue Zhishi released his hands little by little, and he withdrew from Song Yu\u2019s arms the moment the next white light flashed. He suddenly understood \u2014 he guessed that Song Yu had only considered him as a pillow on his bed at that time, or a blanket. This wasn\u2019t anything special to begin with.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologise. I was just giving an example.\u201dA hug couldn\u2019t be considered as a good example either.Separated by a few centimetres of space, Yue Zhishi confessed his thoughts to Song Yu. \u201cI actually really like it when you hug me. I feel very safe.\u201d Yue Zhishi then very quickly admitted, as if he was really scared of being admonished, \u201cBut that\u2019s really strange, I know.\u201dSong Yu was very quiet, only touching his shoulder across the blanket when he heard Yue Zhishi\u2019s words.Yue Zhishi was encouraged by this movement. He faced Song Yu and looked again at his eyes. \u201cJust for tonight, can you hug me while we sleep?\u201dHe started to continuously rationalise his request, just like when he wanted to eat something \u2014 he clearly and logically laid out his various motives. \u201cSince the thunder outside still hasn\u2019t stopped, I can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019ll feel safer if I\u2019m being hugged. And if I fall asleep earlier, you won\u2019t have to worry or mind me anymore. This could be considered as special circumstances. I won\u2019t be sleeping in the same bed with you every day, and it\u2019s not like it\u2019ll be storming and thundering every night.\u201dNoticing that Song Yu didn\u2019t immediately reject his request, Yue Zhishi shifted slightly closer again. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do anything. I\u2019ll be fine just by sticking next to you, I won\u2019t sleep on your arm.\u201dSong Yu abruptly found everything a bit funny, and yet he couldn\u2019t really laugh. He already couldn\u2019t tell \u2014 was he deliberately, wishfully finding Yue Zhishi childish, or had he truly yet to grow up?He couldn\u2019t help but stretch out a hand. He stroked down Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair, pausing at the side of his face, and then very gently covered his ear.But no matter what, Song Yu didn\u2019t want to further confuse or deceive Yue Zhishi, so he repeated it one more time.\u201cNo matter what example you bring out, I\u2019m not dating anyone. That\u2019s the truth.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s eyes were closed, and he looked very meek and very obedient. \u201cThen will you tell me if you started dating someone?\u201d\u201cWould you want to know?\u201d The words left Song Yu\u2019s mouth without him thinking about them, and after he asked, he felt a bit of regret.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know if he wanted to know or not. He didn\u2019t want to be enveloped away, knowing nothing at all, but he might also not feel well if he knew. He didn\u2019t want to share his gege with other people.Their breaths mingled in the space between them as they shared the same pillow. Song Yu waited for Yue Zhishi\u2019s answer in this tranquil and yet torturous atmosphere, and the answer he was given was Yue Zhishi\u2019s change in conversation.\u201cMy desk mate is a girl. She has an older brother too.\u201d Yue Zhishi especially pointed out, \u201cBlood brother.\u201d\u201cShe was complaining to me a while ago, saying her brother was never at home anymore after he started dating. He used to take her to Happy Valley during school breaks or to eat at many delicious places, but now he deliberately stays away from her. He\u2019s worried his girlfriend might not be happy.\u201dYue Zhishi looked like he didn\u2019t have enough air as he spoke, inhaling a long, long breath with his eyes closed. His voice was dull. \u201cHer brother got married this year and moved out to have his own family. It\u2019s been very hard for her to see him afterwards. I told her, you can go look for him.\u201d His eyelashes faintly trembled. \u201cBut she said she has, and that when she was in her brother\u2019s new home, she was very much like an outsider, like a guest. Honestly, from another point of view, that is actually very normal. No one would be willing for their loved one to share their heart with someone else. So my desk mate said that too \u2014 that she only needed to get used to it.\u201dSong Yu silently listened to him speak, thinking of a younger Yue Zhishi. During that time, he was truly as simple as a child with his childish interests and amusements, cute and earnest, sensitive to nothing. But now, a similar topic once again appeared, and Yue Zhishi could no longer use the tone he used before to tell his story.\u201cWe\u2019ll probably be like that in the future.\u201d Lightning flashed, reflecting onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s face and making it look pale and wan. Thunder crashed, and he seemed to come to his senses and said, denying his own words, \u201cEven blood siblings are like that, so we\u2019ll be even more distant in the future. Since I\u2019m not your true younger brother.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if it was his imagination, but Song Yu kept feeling like Yue Zhishi was about to cry. His heart wrenched, and the resistance he held towards his own sinful selfishness ended up losing to his empathic concern for Yue Zhishi. He pulled Yue Zhishi into his arms, abandoning everything. \u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t really believe him. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who said that it was very easy for people to lose one another. Nowadays, I believe this more and more.\u201d He closed his eyes, his chin supported on Song Yu\u2019s shoulder socket. It sounded like he was talking to himself when he asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we real brothers?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s hand was on his back, and he hugged Yue Zhishi tightly after lightning flashed again. A bit helplessly, he asked Yue Zhishi in return, \u201cWhy do you want to be real brothers with me?\u201d\u201cBecause social connections are very fragile.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand was wrapped around Song Yu\u2019s waist. \u201cBut if we were true brothers, even if we cut away all our other connections between us, we won\u2019t be able to cut through a blood relationship with each other.\u201dHearing these words, Song Yu felt Yue Zhishi was both naive and cruel.He\u2019d long understood his own selfishness, so he\u2019d never once hoped to be true brothers with Yue Zhishi. He hoped they would never have any relationship, only strangers occasionally meeting with each other.It would be best if that relationship was never mixed with any other feelings. His burdens would lessen \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t think about his own parents when he embraced him, and he wouldn\u2019t have to carry the weight of other people\u2019s eyes when he held his hand.And he wouldn\u2019t be unable to understand exactly what it was Yue Zhishi felt for him. He wouldn\u2019t grow too many wishful, optimistic thoughts.Seeing Song Yu not speaking, Yue Zhishi touched his back, his tone lightening up a little bit. \u201cAm I really strange?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t Yue Zhishi who was strange; rather, it should be their current status that was strange.Song Yu didn\u2019t reply, so Yue Zhishi said, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m really abnormal?\u201dSong Yu had fallen into sadness, and this almost made him laugh. In a soft voice, he said, \u201cNo.\u201d He even very openly patted Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair. \u201cYou were like this as a child.\u201dYue Zhishi asked why, puzzled and worn out. Song Yu said, \u201cMaybe because you established an intimate reliance on me as a child. This kind of emotional connection is usually only between children and their parents, or maybe between siblings. In such special circumstances, you attached onto me \u2014 and that\u2019s why you have separation anxiety. It\u2019s actually normal. Some people, no matter how old they are, still find it hard to be away from their parents.\u201dHearing him speak, Yue Zhishi felt very relieved, his ability to think declining under his drowsiness. He grasped only the key words: separation anxiety. He felt it made a lot of sense; he really would feel anxious whenever he was away from Song Yu. He squeezed Song Yu and wriggled in his arms, as if he was whining. \u201cThen can you not stay too far away from me? Can you come home more often?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s body stiffened for a few seconds, feeling as if it was no longer his.But he felt Yue Zhishi would fall asleep easier if he gave him a promise.\u201cMn.\u201d\u201cReally? In the future as well?\u201dSong Yu couldn\u2019t help but nod again as he clearly heard Yue Zhishi cheer up.Yue Zhishi buried his head once more, preparing to sleep. He found it was actually very easy for him to get what he wanted from Song Yu \u2014 he looked like someone who was very hard to get close to, but he was actually someone who surrendered very easily.He softly said good night, and then Yue Zhishi peacefully closed his eyes.The rain continued to recklessly, outrageously fall. It was very noisy, and Song Yu\u2019s palm never left Yue Zhishi\u2019s ear until the thunder completely disappeared and Yue Zhishi\u2019s breathing steadied out.\u00a0 Only then did Song Yu remove his hand, lightly placing it on top of Yue Zhishi\u2019s waist.Human will was at its weakest in the deep of the night, and it was very easy to make impulsive decisions. So Song Yu indulged himself for a second \u2014 he lowered his head and very gently kissed the top of Yue Zhishi\u2019s head.Other than the rain outside the window, no one else knew of this kiss.Yue Zhishi slowly, fuzzily woke when the sun was about to rise. He realised Song Yu didn\u2019t leave after he fell asleep and was very happy. A single-sized bed was truly too cramped \u2014 his waist was a bit sore, and he continued resting in Song Yu\u2019s arms for a little while with his eyes closed. He started to feel it was a bit too warm, so he turned over and placed his forehead against the wall.As he continued sleeping, Song Yu felt Yue Zhishi turn over. He moved as well, subconsciously pulling Yue Zhishi closer and wrapping his arms around him. Yue Zhishi\u2019s entire back was securely enfolded into Song Yu, and they comfortably, snugly nestled into each other.It was 7:30am the second time Yue Zhishi woke up. It was very bright outside, so he pulled the blanket over his head before he remembered Song Yu\u2019s admonishing. He pulled it back down, slightly.He only then realised the bed was missing one person. Yue Zhishi flipped over, eyes squinting, and stretched out an arm as he continued laying in bed. He flung his arm around, vaguely and weakly calling out Song Yu\u2019s name.He didn\u2019t know how many times he repeated Song Yu\u2019s name before he finally heard some noise. With great effort, he heaved his head up, peeled open his eyes and watched as Song Yu came out and closed the bathroom door. Yue Zhishi rubbed his eyes, curled on Song Yu\u2019s pillow, and lazily said, \u201cWhy are you showering in the morning too\u2026\u201dSong Yu seemed to not have expected Yue Zhishi to wake up so early. He was a bit surprised when he saw him, but he very quickly recovered. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to wake up this way.\u201dHe wanted to tell Yue Zhishi to nap a bit longer and that he\u2019ll go and buy breakfast, but Yue Zhishi climbed out of bed by himself. Having not lived in a dormitory before, Yue Zhishi\u2019s movements as he climbed down the ladder were very unsteady. Song Yu stood by the side, ready to catch him whenever he needed.But Yue Zhishi safely landed on the floor without Song Yu needing to lift a hand. He stepped barefoot onto the tiles, and he only quickly stepped into his slippers after Song Yu ordered him. He stretched and, just like a true copycat, said, \u201cI\u2019m going to shower too.\u201d He walked towards to the bathroom after he finished speaking.Song Yu helplessly glanced at his retreating figure and then lowered his head to put on his watch sitting on his desk. He then seemed to abruptly think of something, turning his head around to take a look at the bathroom, and then started to feel some remorse in advance.And then, as expected, Yue Zhishi yelled as he turned on the shower.\u201cThe water\u2019s so cold!\u201dEven after he changed the water back to an acceptable temperature, Yue Zhishi was still complaining when he came out. \u201cYou don\u2019t shower with cold water, do you? It\u2019s so cold, you\u2019re going to catch a cold.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t explain \u2014 it was very likely he might set himself up if he explained why a 21 year old young man needed to take a cold shower after he woke up in the morning.He didn\u2019t want to create an awkward situation where he might end up revealing too much about himself, so he quickly changed the topic, shooing Yue Zhishi to hurry up so they could go eat breakfast together.The water downstairs hadn\u2019t actually flooded up to the first floor as Song Yu had expected; rather, it had drained away by quite a lot. Yue Zhishi\u2019s entire body was covered in Song Yu\u2019s clothes, and he specifically chose a pair of shorts that reached only to his knees, worried he\u2019d get Song Yu\u2019s pants wet. His very pale pair of calves were exposed, and they were both long and slender.Yue Zhishi drank a warm, steamy bowl of eggnog. Eggs were whisked into warmed fermented glutinous rice wine, and it tasted sweet and mellow. He also ate a\u00a0Chinese doughnut\u00a0the size of his palm \u2014 this was one of the few fried breakfast food items he wasn\u2019t allergic to. He liked ripping the doughnut apart to eat the crispiest, most delicious inner ring, and then he\u2019d take a bite of the soft and tender outer ring. It was salty, fragrant and crunchy all at the same time, and he was also able to taste the flavours of rice milk and soybeans.\u201cDo you have a night self-study session today?\u201d Song Yu gave him a tissue.Yue Zhishi started to deflate at the mention of this. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s head back after lunch. I\u2019ll send you off.\u201d Song Yu also drank some eggnog. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to rest after enduring just a little bit more.\u201dYue Zhishi really didn\u2019t want to leave, but he still nodded. \u201cAnd Cotton Candy must feel very strange being at home by himself.\u201dSong Yu observed Yue Zhishi\u2019s expressions. He didn\u2019t look too upset \u2014 Song Yu felt he had actually, truly grown up.After they finished eating, Yue Zhishi said his mouth felt a bit greasy from eating fried things and wanted something to drink. Song Yu could only bring him to the university supermarket he went to yesterday. Yue Zhishi was a classic libra with serious difficulty in making choices, so he stood in front of the row of drink fridges for a very long time.Song Yu stood next to him. Quite a few people came and went, and a lot of girls peeked at Yue Zhishi. Not only because of his mixed-race face, but he really did stand out in a crowd of people \u2014 it was very common for him to catch people\u2019s attention. But Song Yu wasn\u2019t too comfortable with this.This was even worse than when he himself was surrounded by staring people.\u201cIsn\u2019t this the one you were frantically drinking last night?\u201d Yue Zhishi lifted up a bottle of cherry-flavoured coke and looked at Song Yu.Song Yu corrected him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t frantically drinking it. I was just thirsty.\u201dThis drink also made him think of some unpleasant memories.Yue Zhishi looked at the packaging, and a small expression of disdain showed on his face. \u201cDon\u2019t you think this looks like the fever reducing syrup we used to drink? It looks exactly the same.\u201d He returned it back to its spot and grabbed a bottle of lemon soda instead. \u201cJust this one.\u201dYue Zhishi also picked up a lemon-flavoured lollipop at the register, telling Song Yu to buy it as well.After they came out, Song Yu started to chide, \u201cYou can\u2019t casually eat things other people give you at school.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d Yue Zhishi refuted. \u201cI\u2019m not that dumb.\u201dHe\u2019d clearly already agreed to eat food other people brought from home.\u201cNo matter if it\u2019s fish or other sweets, it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t have them at home. There\u2019s no need to eat stuff outsiders give you.\u201dYue Zhishi felt Song Yu\u2019s tone was a bit strange, but he still promised, \u201cI know.\u201dOnly then did Song Yu let the matter drop. The two of them walked around the campus, and in a place with lots of puddles, Yue Zhishi\u2019s foot went into the water and accidentally stepped on something. He yelped.Song Yu looked down. It was a red koi fish, but he spoke calmly, unperturbed.\u201cMaybe it ran out from the lake nearby after it started flooding.\u201dBut Yue Zhishi felt this wasn\u2019t usual at all \u2014 he felt he was extremely, extraordinarily lucky, and he even clasped his hands together to bow at the koi fish he\u2019d stepped on. \u201cPlease give me your blessings so I can smoothly enter your home.\u201dSong Yu called him superstitious, but he started to scold Song Yu. \u201cWhen you were taking your college exams, I went out of my way to pray to the gods and ask for their blessings for you.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s perpetually straight mouth involuntarily crooked up a little, and he very naturally asked, taking advantage of the situation, \u201cThen what would you like for your college entrance exams?\u201dYue Zhishi froze for a bit after hearing him speak. He\u2019d not considered this problem before. \u201cI need to think about it.\u201d He very quickly said, \u201cFirst\u2026\u201dSong Yu raised an eyebrow. \u201cHow many requests do you have?\u201dYue Zhishi caught his arm, preventing Song Yu from interrupting his words, and then he said to Song Yu with an upturned face, \u201cFirst, I hope you can encourage me to test into Wuhan U. I haven\u2019t thought about everything else yet, so I\u2019m automatically extending the deadline to one week after the college entrance exams.\u201dSong Yu lowered his eyes, a faint smile on his face, looking as if he was expressing his silent consent and indulgence at Yue Zhishi\u2019s rule-modifying behaviour.Yue Zhishi left his newly-bought lollipop to just before he needed to leave. The break was about to finish, and there were many people waiting in the subway station. Song Yu swiped his card, saying he\u2019ll send him home, but Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want him to ride back all by himself. He rejected him very maturely.The previous subway train whistled in departure as they came off the escalator. Yue Zhishi was very glad.He and Song Yu stood shoulder to shoulder in front of the subway\u2019s security doors, and the glass reflected their images back at them. He was wearing Song Yu\u2019s clothes all over his body, and yet it didn\u2019t make him look more like Song Yu. But Yue Zhishi, right now, was starting to learn how to not feel anxious about a nonexistent blood relationship.Thinking about himself last time during the parent-teacher meeting, Yue Zhishi laughed out loud as he sucked at the lollipop.As they waited for the next train, Yue Zhishi once again repeated his request from last night. Song Yu patiently agreed, saying he\u2019ll definitely come home to see him next weekend.\u201cDo you have anything to say to me?\u201d Yue Zhishi lifted his face up, gazing at Song Yu\u2019s eyes. He curved his lips and smiled, very beautifully.The sound of an approaching subway train gradually neared, and an announcer\u2019s voice started to broadcast over their heads.[Dear customers, the train towards Tianhe Airport is about to arrive\u2026]Yue Zhishi was distracted by the upcoming train \u2014 his body leaned forward, and he tilted his head over to gaze at the track lights. In the next second, his wrist was caught.[\u2026Please allow others to alight before boarding. Please mind the gap between the platform and the train.]In the ever-decreasing gap of time, Song Yu\u2019s voice appeared next to his ear.\u201cLe Le.\u201dYue Zhishi turned his head around, looking at him in a daze.Song Yu\u2019s face was very soft, very gentle, and he looked different from usual. \u201cEncouraging words \u2014 I\u2019ve actually written them into your math textbook last time at the parent-teacher meeting.\u201d His gaze held a hint of mischief, but his face was calm and steady. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like math, and I knew you wouldn\u2019t flip back through it. Sure enough, you didn\u2019t notice I wrote something.\u201dThe subway\u2019s security doors opened, the long, airtight train space opening all at once. A multitude of people rushed out from inside, separating to all kinds of different directions. Yue Zhishi felt the hold around his wrist loosen, and he was pushed by a stream of people into that narrow, moving space.He realised Song Yu was very cunning. He was very good at hiding things away \u2014 he could conceal a riddle for a very, very long time. He would only reveal a single, solitary clue when Yue Zhishi had no way to continue asking him questions.Song Yu knew very well how to torture someone. Right now, Yue Zhishi wanted nothing more than to rush back to him.The train doors closed, and the announcement broadcast switched from outside to inside the carriage.[\u2026Please stand firm and hold on securely. Next stop\u2026]Yue Zhishi\u2019s cellphone vibrated. He swiped it open, the message jumping out into the front.[Gege: I actually really hope you can get into Wuhan U.][Gege: I\u2019ll be here, waiting for you.]The author has something to say:The parent-teacher meeting will be writtenPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yue Zhishi stared at the messages on his phone screen, his face calm. His heart was beating very quickly.He locked his screen and looked up at the train\u2019s route and upcoming stops. He couldn\u2019t help but turn on his phone once again \u2014 he read through Song Yu\u2019s messages once more, and then he took a screenshot, as if this way he wouldn\u2019t lose the words Song Yu had sent him.His hand pulling on the strap handle, Yue Zhishi gazed at his reflection in the train\u2019s glass windows and had a hallucination: the person in the window looked exactly like him, but that person was wearing Peiya\u2019s student uniform.And so he remembered the day Song Yu took Lin Rong\u2019s place and came to his parent-teacher meeting.It was last year\u2019s October 10th, Yue Zhishi\u2019s birthday. No one would be happy at having a parent-teacher meeting during their birthday. It was very cold that day, the temperature having dropped in the morning. Yue Zhishi was originally wearing his thin sports uniform when Lin Rong called him back and ordered him to change into his knitted vest and winter coat uniform.Thinking about it later, Yue Zhishi was very grateful to Lin Rong for forcing him to wear his proper uniform. He later received Lin Rong\u2019s messages during lunch, saying she needed to attend a very important party with Song Jin and that Song Yu was going to the parent-teacher meeting in her place. She even said they\u2019ll make up for his birthday over the weekend.His lunch of scrambled eggs with carrots and Sichuan shredded pork with carrots substituting the usual bamboo shoots was actually really hard to eat, but Yue Zhishi was remarkably happy, so excited he didn\u2019t take a nap during his afternoon break. He rushed to clean and organise his entire desk, and when his desk mate came back later, she jumped in shock at his desk, as shiny as new.\u201cHow\u2019d you do this?\u201dYue Zhishi finished scrubbing his desk with wipes for the third time, and after he threw them away, he patted his own hands. \u201cWith nothing but my hands.\u201dHe sat behind this bright and clean desk for the next three lessons, and he fastidiously tidied away all the materials he used after each single lesson, making sure to even go through his drawers. It was finally time for the parent-teacher meeting. Most students hated these kinds of meetings \u2014 if they were lucky, they would be invisible during the entire meeting. But for those who weren\u2019t that lucky, they were sending their parents to their own public execution.It was the first time Yue Zhishi looked forward to the meeting so much.The weather was worse compared to the morning, the sky completely covered in stormy clouds. Yue Zhishi started to worry if it was going to start raining, if Song Yu had brought an umbrella. Their class adviser came in early and pulled up her prepared PowerPoint on the presentation screen, telling the students to later wait outside in the corridor.The first parent to arrive for their class was the mother of a female student. She was dressed very plainly and appeared in the classroom door looking a bit lost. Yue Zhishi watched as his classmate led her mother to her seat, and then he couldn\u2019t help but go outside. He crouched near the corridor railings for a while before he went to wait at the top of the stairs.\u201cLe Le, is your mom or your dad coming?\u201d Another male student was standing at the stairs, and he bumped Yue Zhishi with his shoulder.\u201cThey\u2019re both busy. My ge\u2019s coming.\u201d\u201cYou have a brother? That\u2019s great.\u201dA female classmate also walked over. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know? Ah, that\u2019s right \u2014 you weren\u2019t here for junior high. His brother used to be our senior in high school, he\u2019s handsome and had good grades.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s vain little heart swelled, and he said, in place of his gege, \u201cHe\u2019s not as good as you make him out to be.\u201d He then turned his head around, and in that moment, he saw Song Yu.Song Yu wore a windbreaker the same black colour as his hair. It set off his sharp features and the outstanding air around him, and it made him extraordinarily easy to see in the crowd of parents. He tilted up his head as he walked up the stairs, and he just so happened to meet Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes. His originally straight mouth faintly moved, and the cold look on his face faded away slightly.\u201cGege.\u201d Yue Zhishi took a few steps forward and stood next to him after Song Yu reached the top of the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you to my seat.\u201dThe girl behind him was still gossiping with the male classmate from before. \u201cSee, isn\u2019t he tall and handsome?\u201dThis was the first time Song Yu had come to Yue Zhishi\u2019s classroom, but it felt like Yue Zhishi was the one who found it more novel and exciting.His seat was in the second to last row of the third section of the classroom. Yue Zhishi brought Song Yu over, sat him down and pointed at the cup of warm water he\u2019d just poured. \u201cIf you\u2019re thirsty, you can drink this.\u201dSong Yu nodded as soon as he finished speaking. He surveyed his desk without much expression on his face, but he praised, \u201cSo clean.\u201dThe female desk mate next to Song Yu sold Yue Zhishi out in front of a good-looking guy. \u201cHe was cleaning it the entire afternoon.\u201dBeing thoroughly exposed, Yue Zhishi shot a glare at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t clean it for the\u00a0entire\u00a0afternoon\u2026\u201d He still wanted to recover some face, but he realised Song Yu didn\u2019t seem to really care about it. He was looking around the classroom, so Yue Zhishi asked, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dSong Yu pulled his gaze back and looked at Yue Zhishi. \u201cI realised I was in this classroom for my 2nd year of high school.\u201dPeiya was always changing classrooms, to the point sometimes even the repair team in school would throw away the classroom name plate. After Yue Zhishi entered high school, he\u2019d changed classrooms four times, including the one time their year needed to split up for different streams. He never expected to graduate from the classroom Song Yu had spent his 2nd year in.\u201cReally?\u201d To Song Yu, Yue Zhishi\u2019s happiness always seemed to come from nowhere.Song Yu nodded, his elbows on the table. He very tranquilly added, \u201cI sat behind you.\u201dHis sentence was too mesmerising.As if they really were in the same classroom, as if he really did sit behind Yue Zhishi every day \u2014 and as long as Yue Zhishi wanted, he could turn around and see him.In a parallel space-time continuum where time was delayed by one year \u2014 if that timeline overlapped with Yue Zhishi\u2019s current universe, then Song Yu would\u2019ve been able to stay with Yue Zhishi through every single difficult-to-endure day as he finished his last year of high school.Yue Zhishi froze for a second, and then a smile bloomed outside of his control.\u201cIs there anything I can\u2019t see in your desk?\u201dYue Zhishi spread out his hands and generously said, \u201cNo, feel free to look.\u201dHe only tidied up so cleanly because he wanted to take care of Song Yu\u2019s obsession with cleanliness.Their class adviser was pushing the students out of the room, so he had no way to continue staying for longer and could only follow his classmates out. Everyone ended up standing at the windows, peeking in, and observed the reactions between their teachers and their parents. However, Song Yu\u2019s appearance in this parent-teacher meeting was a special case, and he particularly drew everyone\u2019s attention. All of the surrounding classmates were talking about him. Boys said Song Yu played basketball really well, while girls said Song Yu had both handsome looks and fantastic grades \u2014 Yue Zhishi, with his dazzling older brother complex, had no way to compete.He looked only at Song Yu. Other parents had their heads up, devoutly and seriously listening to the class adviser as she spoke, but Song Yu didn\u2019t look up at all. He bent his waist and took out a stack of exam papers and textbooks from Yue Zhishi\u2019s drawers.\u201cYou\u2019re dead,\u201d his desk mate said. She was also standing outside the window. \u201cYour brother\u2019s looking at your exams. He won\u2019t go back and tattle on you to your parents, will he?\u201dEveryone laughed, but Yue Zhishi was incredibly calm. \u201cHe won\u2019t. He\u2019s never tattled on me before, and besides, my mom and dad don\u2019t really care if I get good grades or not.\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s so lucky.\u201d\u201cThen why\u2019d he take them out?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I don\u2019t like other people going through my things. Not even good-looking guys.\u201dYue Zhishi wrinkled his brows when he heard this person speak. \u201cHe\u2019s my ge, not \u2018other people\u2019. I like letting him go through my things.\u201d He walked away to another side of the window after he spoke. He was famous for his good temper and popularity \u2014 so not only had he not gotten angry before, he had rarely even spoken harsh words to anyone. He was clearly not happy this time, and all the girls nearby were heavily astonished.Another classmate said, \u201cLe Le, you\u2019re not similar to your brother at all, he looks so standoffish. But his facial features are very solid, very sharp \u2014 is he mixed too? How come his hair and eyes are so black?\u201dYue Zhishi thought he had too many questions, but he still answered, \u201cHe\u2019s not mixed.\u201d\u201cNo wonder, you two don\u2019t look alike at all. You\u2019re not real brothers right? Cousins?\u201dYue Zhishi fell silent \u2014 he didn\u2019t really want to answer this question.After entering high school, he and Song Yu separated. Even if Yue Zhishi went again to the self-study room next to the high school class 3-5\u2019s classroom, there was no longer anyone who could go home with him. Sometimes, he would stand in front of the college entrance exams honour board in the cafeteria and stare at Song Yu\u2019s name in a daze, but this board stayed for only one year before the names were changed to others.He slightly regretted staying at Peiya by himself. He should\u2019ve gone to a new school, where he wouldn\u2019t think of Song Yu at every moment. At the cafeteria, he\u2019d think of the dishes Song Yu detested; at the sports ground, he\u2019d think of how Song Yu had looked like when he was shooting a basketball.And the cruelest, most hateful place was the open-air corridor on the third floor.\u201cIf you\u2019re not real brothers, then your relationship shouldn\u2019t be that close.\u201dHe gazed at the window glass, and his face overlapped with Song Yu\u2019s side profile like a moment of double exposure in photography.Abruptly, Yue Zhishi really, really hoped for Song Yu and him to look exactly alike \u2014 to the point other people would be able to guess their relationship at first glance. There would never again be any\u00a0questions, and he himself would no longer have to carry the anxious weight of constantly second-guessing himself.The class adviser came down from the talking podium not much longer. She opened the door, telling the class monitor to either take them outside or to go home. She\u2019d just closed the door again when a girl in the outer crowd suggested going to the cafeteria, and everyone agreed one by one. They all went down together.Yue Zhishi left a bit wistfully, taking a few more looks before he walked away. Song Yu had taken off his windbreaker jacket and had draped it over the chair, wearing a white knit shirt. He sat there very peacefully, holding Yue Zhishi\u2019s pen, and lowered his head with a very earnest expression as if he was considering something.Yue Zhishi returned back to three years ago in a trance \u2014 he stood outside the classroom, waiting for his gege that had yet to finish his class.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Le Le.\u201dYue Zhishi turned. \u201cI know.\u201dThe content and general process of parent-teacher meetings were always very similar. The class adviser talked about the seriousness of the college entrance exams and reported the scores from the latest mock tests. Song Yu was very familiar with all of this \u2014 it was just that his role was now flipped, turning into the person who sat below and listened to the class adviser.He didn\u2019t really want to listen. He\u2019d heard all of these things for three straight years, and he was so familiar with the content that even if he didn\u2019t listen now, he would still be better at guiding the students than the parents now sitting in place, who knew nothing about college entrance exams.Song Yu turned through Yue Zhishi\u2019s exam papers. His English was as good as it always was, and even he was a bit curious \u2014 did blood truly carry knowledge? But Yue Zhishi\u2019s math scores weren\u2019t as great in comparison to the rest of his subjects: his scores fluctuated often and weren\u2019t very stable. His scores were very high when he tested well, but when he didn\u2019t, his scores were very far from the other students who did well.He pulled out Yue Zhishi\u2019s booklet of wrong answers, going through that as well, and noticed Yue Zhishi once again answered similar questions incorrectly in the newest test paper. To Song Yu, these questions were very straight-forward and had fairly standard answers, so he lifted up his pen and took this time to explain the questions to Yue Zhishi. In the wrong answers booklet, he even wrote down several common problem-solving methods.He concentrated on Yue Zhishi\u2019s work for some time, and then he suddenly heard the class adviser call out Yue Zhishi\u2019s name. Song Yu lifted his head, realising all the parents in front were looking at him.\u201cThe parent for our Yue Zhishi student is actually one of Peiya\u2019s outstanding graduates: Song Yu. His grades were always at the front while he was still attending our school, and his score for the college entrance exams was also incredibly excellent.\u201d The class adviser\u2019s gaze was full of expectation as she looked at Song Yu. \u201cIt\u2019s also such a coincidence that he came here today. Can you share with our other parents a bit of what you\u2019ve learned from your study experience, or maybe what they should pay attention to as parents?\u201dSong Yu was quite unused to this kind of environment. He felt like he wasn\u2019t Yue Zhishi\u2019s older brother right now, but rather more like his father. He pressed his lips together at this strange shifting of seniority and was silent for a moment before he opened his mouth. He said, in a deep voice, \u201cActually, it\u2019s already too late to be talking about studying.\u201dHis words were truly too direct, and the class adviser shifted in slight awkwardness. \u201cAh, to be honest\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I think there are still things parents need to do. If possible, it would be best to prevent putting too much pressure onto your children. Rather than constantly telling them to study or take care of their bodies, it would be better to care about their mental health \u2014 focus less on their education.\u201d Song Yu finished speaking and left a little bit of room for the class adviser\u2019s self-respect. He gave her a faint, slight smile. \u201cI think everything else has been covered quite well by you, class adviser.\u201dMost likely because he carried the halo of a top-scorer, but there were parents who agreed with everything he said. After he finally sat back down, Song Yu continued placing his focus on his little brother\u2019s test papers. He stacked the papers away neatly after he finished going through most of them and returned them back to the drawer. He placed the wrong answer booklet on top, so that Yue Zhishi would be able to see it as soon as he came back.He had accidentally pulled out a math textbook at the same time he pulled out the test papers. It had a purple book cover, and seeing as he had nothing else to do, he opened it and flipped through it as well. Textbooks like these that didn\u2019t need to be given to the teachers were usually filled in quite sparsely.And as expected, not only was there not much work in it, this textbook looked like something Yue Zhishi used to waste time. The lower right hand corners contained simple drawings of an anime character Yue Zhishi really liked; when the pages were quickly flipped, the drawings turned into a full-blown fight sequence.Only Yue Zhishi would be able to do something like this.Song Yu abruptly felt parent-teacher meetings were really interesting. As he looked through the textbook again, many pages were covered by scribbles \u2014 the more Yue Zhishi wrote, the more illegible they became until one particular scribble turned into a heavy dot on the paper. Clearly, Yue Zhishi had been so sleepy he\u2019d lost all consciousness, and yet he still persisted on sitting up straight, pretending to write.Just by looking at these marks, Song Yu could imagine a lively, vivid Yue Zhishi.He flipped to a random page. He paused, staring at it for a while, and then lifted up his pen to write down a line of words.Time flew very quickly as he amused himself this way. After the meeting ended, quite a few parents came to Song Yu\u2019s desk and hoped he could share a bit more with them. Even though Song Yu always spoke little and had a cold face, he couldn\u2019t be too obvious about it. He said a few more things, and he only opened his mouth in blunt refusal when a parent asked for his contact details, hoping to hire him as a home tutor.\u201cI\u2019m very busy. I don\u2019t even go home all that often. If I really do need to tutor someone, then that someone will definitely be my family\u2019s child. Right?\u201dHe pulled on his windbreaker and left the classroom. Song Yu didn\u2019t see any traces of Yue Zhishi, so he called him with no one picking up. Yue Zhishi\u2019s phone was usually either on silent mode or turned off completely when he was at school, so Song Yu guessed Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t see his call \u2014 he went to find him himself.In reality, Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t even taken out his phone. He was surrounded by many classmates in the cafeteria, with him being the sole centre of a very awkward situation \u2014 a female classmate was suddenly confessing to him. He\u2019d never once thought she would like him, and yet she\u2019d prepared a small birthday surprise. Clamouring boys pressed him onto a chair, so Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t even get up.\u201cI specifically went out to get this cake today.\u201d The girl was sitting across from him, and she pushed the cake until it reached him. She looked very bashful. \u201cThis shop\u2019s cakes are really yummy, I needed to book a week ahead to get this.\u201dThis cake truly did look very beautiful. It was rose and lychee flavoured, and words wishing Yue Zhishi a happy birthday were drawn on top.Everyone was making a fuss by the side. Most of them didn\u2019t know he was allergic to wheat, and Jiang Yufan, the only person who knew, was still in science class. They all wheedled Yue Zhishi to cut a piece and try it, and Yue Zhishi had no way of refusing \u2014 he thought he should be okay if he wiped off some of the frosting to taste.So he lifted up a fork to swipe some down, secretly trying to calculate how he could later leave without looking too impolite.But before he could implement his plan, in the next moment, his wrist was held by a familiar hand.He lifted his head and immediately met Song Yu\u2019s pair of cold and stern eyes.\u201cHe\u2019s allergic. He can\u2019t casually eat cakes from outside places.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice was very cool, and he yanked Yue Zhishi to his feet.The girl on the other side looked a bit awkward \u2014 she\u2019d just confessed, and yet she ended up giving the person she liked something he might be allergic to. This situation was truly unlucky. But Yue Zhishi still nicely said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m okay. Thank you for buying it for me.\u201dSong Yu pulled him out without letting him continue to speak.Wind was harshly blowing outside, and rain had just started to fall. There were already large droplets of water on the ground, and at the speed the rain was falling, Yue Zhishi guessed it was about to start showering. He shrank his neck back into his coat and followed behind Song Yu.\u201cYou\u2019re going to just eat anything anyone gives you? How many times do I have to say it?\u201d Song Yu didn\u2019t look happy. \u201cYou didn\u2019t learn enough from your childhood?\u201dYue Zhishi felt a bit wronged. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t going to eat it. She just\u2026\u201dSong Yu\u2019s footsteps stopped, and he looked at Yue Zhishi. \u201cYou can eat things just because someone confessed to you?\u201dHow did he know it was a confession\u2026Yue Zhishi stood there in confusion, briefly pouting before he smoothened out his face. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to eat the cake. I just wanted to try the frosting so she\u2019d feel better.\u201dSong Yu stayed in place for a little while, and the rain started to pour. He simply said he understood and walked towards his car before pulling out the keys. He pressed the button, and then he circled around to the passenger seat, opening the car door for Yue Zhishi.Yue Zhishi meekly got into the car, sitting next to Song Yu. He realised Song Yu\u2019s hair had gotten shorter \u2014 it truly was very dark, and it didn\u2019t look very inviting to the touch. This difference in hair colour might be the largest disparity in his and Song Yu\u2019s appearances.He suddenly thought, maybe he should dye his hair black \u2014 would that make him look more like Song Yu?He honestly, really wanted a distinctive and exclusive relationship that couldn\u2019t be cut away at any time.His brain swirled in chaos. Thunder suddenly rang outside, and Yue Zhishi raised a hand in automatic reflex \u2014 but Song Yu pressed his hand down. Song Yu didn\u2019t speak, only using his other hand to turn on the car\u2019s music player. He played relaxing, soothing classical piano music.The hand holding onto Yue Zhishi had yet to move away.In the entire world, Song Yu was the person who understood him the most. What he could eat, and what he couldn\u2019t eat; what he liked, and what he didn\u2019t like; and even the little habits he had during class \u2014 he held all that knowledge in the palm of his hand. All these small, minor details were accumulated from the passage of so many years.Yue Zhishi watched as he twisted his body over, grabbing a cleanly beautiful white box from the backseat. He placed it onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s lap.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cOpen it yourself.\u201dA chocolate cake lay inside, and a rich fragrance wafted up. The cake\u2019s smooth and shiny surface reflected a beautiful sheen just like a mirror. It looked very much like something Song Yu would make.\u201cThere was no more wheat-free flour at home, so I needed to go to a few places to find almond flour. It\u2019s a bit rushed.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s perfectionism lowered his own self-evaluation, but Yue Zhishi really liked it \u2014 he didn\u2019t think Song Yu would remember his birthday, let alone spend so much effort to make him a cake.\u201cIt looks really, really delicious.\u201dYue Zhishi had even thought he needed to wait until the weekend to celebrate his birthday, and he\u2019d even thought Song Yu wouldn\u2019t come home and wouldn\u2019t spend the day with him.The white flash of lightning flew past, and without waiting for Yue Zhishi to move, Song Yu raised his hands first and covered his ears. Song Yu\u2019s voice came the same time as the thunder, overlapping the beating of his heart.\u201cHappy birthday.\u201dYue Zhishi remembered he sat in the car and ate a very large piece of cake. A tiny bit of chocolate ganache had even been smudged onto his nose, and Song Yu had been very treacherous \u2014 he didn\u2019t tell him of that smudge at all, and Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t find out until they arrived home.He still remembered both Lin Rong and Song Jin hadn\u2019t come home that day. He had clung to Song Yu, chattering about many things, and he\u2019d stayed in Song Yu\u2019s room as he did his homework until midnight had passed.At that time, Song Yu had even asked him if he\u2019d properly worked on the textbooks he\u2019d spent money to buy.Yue Zhishi had just thought Song Yu was randomly asking him from a parent\u2019s perspective, as a residual effect from the parent-teacher meeting. Now that he thought about it again, Song Yu had been giving him a hint.The subway ran much faster than normal. Yue Zhishi swiped his card and left the station, his curious heart driving him to rush home as quickly as he could, seeking the answer hidden away for so long.Lin Rong had also just returned home from the airport and found it quite strange when she saw Yue Zhishi dive directly into his room as soon as he entered the house. She went upstairs with a bowl of red bean\u00a0double milk skin custard. Seeing Yue Zhishi strenuously reaching for the cardboard box on top of his bookshelf, she knocked on the open door. \u201cDarling, what are you doing? Here, have some double milk skin custard.\u201dYue Zhishi glanced at her, his arms still struggling to pull down the box. \u201cAunt Rong, are the textbooks I brought home last semester in this box?\u201dLin Rong placed down the bowl and stood there, thinking. \u201cNo, I think I put them into that white cabinet for you.\u201d\u201cReally? Let me have a look.\u201dThinking Yue Zhishi might\u2019ve received some kind of stimulation after visiting Wuhan U and wanted to strongly prepare for the last stretch before exams, Lin Rong didn\u2019t dare bother him any longer. \u201cRemember to eat the custard. If you want something, just tell me. Don\u2019t overwork yourself.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d Yue Zhishi knelt in front of the cabinet, searching through each book without lifting his head to her. Lin Rong closed the door behind her, and he searched for over ten minutes before he finally found the math textbooks he\u2019d previously purchased. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t give up now that he had a narrower scope to search \u2014 he carried all those books to his desk and flipped through all of them.He went through each one until he reached the textbook he\u2019d previously drawn in and used most often to kill time. A sense of shame, half a year late, rose in his heart, and only then did Yue Zhishi faintly feel as though he\u2019d found the right one.What could it be.The hand turning over his textbooks suddenly stopped, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s gaze halted at the same time.It was a textbook about mathematical functions. The exercises were all very long, and the first one was about calculating the flow of guests in a particular park. Yue Zhishi still remembered this question \u2014 it was tediously long, going on and on about things he didn\u2019t understand, and even the\u00a0equivalence relation refinement\u00a0was ridiculously difficult. At that time, he\u2019d been so tired from answering questions that after he finished reading it, all his brain could think about were the key words of park, guests and holiday. His brain hadn\u2019t wanted to calculate it at all.So then, in a fit of rebellion, he\u2019d written down a row of words.[Answer: I don\u2019t want to do questions anymore, I only want to go out and play. The park has so many guests, it won\u2019t be much just to add one more me.]But when he looked back at it now, an extra line appeared below his words in an entirely different, swift and sharp handwriting.[Endure for just a little while longer. I\u2019ll take you after the entrance exams \u2014 I\u2019ll take you wherever you want to go.]Was this the encouragement Song Yu was talking about?Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart started to pound, pitter-pattering in its speed. He suddenly felt an illusion \u2014 it felt like he and Song Yu were two people living in two separate timelines in a science fiction movie, and in a wonderful, sudden moment, their timelines started to intersect.The words he\u2019d once written down, words no one knew about, now received a reply.His fingertips were numb, and his heart was filled to the brim, about to overflow like rainwater. Yue Zhishi reached out a hand and very gently ran his fingers over Song Yu\u2019s writing, unconsciously repeating them in his heart multiple times.He felt there should be more; Song Yu wouldn\u2019t have left behind just this one small trace. After tasting one little bit of sweetness, Yue Zhishi continued to turn the pages, seriously flipping through them many times. But he actually hadn\u2019t slacked off often; he had conscientiously, diligently applied himself to most of the questions.Song Yu didn\u2019t seem to have played in many places.Yue Zhishi was slightly dejected, but he was already very satisfied with the one answer he received.He closed the book, and he stared at the cover in a daze. Something flashed across his mind, and his ears started to burn.One time, when he hadn\u2019t been paying attention in class, he\u2019d done something very foolish.Yue Zhishi frantically opened the textbook again as he thought about this, turning the pages until he finally found the one page that he never wanted to see again.He had been so bored. As if he was practicing calligraphy, he\u2019d written Song Yu\u2019s name again and again \u2014 and looking back now at the name he\u2019d repeated many, many times, Yue Zhishi felt his heart speed up again. He couldn\u2019t tell if he was feeling embarrassment or something else. When he silently read out the name, only his own voice resounded in his brain. He called out gege\u2019s name again and again, not hoping for an answer.Unexpectedly, he froze. He stared at the last time he\u2019d written that name, gaze fixed on the twentieth time he\u2019d written those two characters.[Song Yu]A single word was added underneath, echoing back at him.[Hm?]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45: Left-Behind SignsThe late replies didn\u2019t lessen any of the joy Yue Zhishi felt at finding them \u2014 rather, discovering them so late doubled his surprise.Before heading back to school for his evening self-study session, he placed into his schoolbag the textbook he\u2019d thrown into a random corner for half a year. But the book was too heavy, so Yue Zhishi took it out again, carefully cutting out the two pages with Song Yu\u2019s replies and tucking them into the grey sketchbook Song Yu had previously given him.Looking at Song Yu\u2019s handwriting, Yue Zhishi was suddenly struck by a strong urge to share what he\u2019d just received. He didn\u2019t have someone suitable to share the messages with though, so after thinking a while, he finally posted a post on QQ visible only to himself.[Cheese1010: Messages after half a year \u2014 received!]Yue Zhishi felt like Song Yu might be a talent sent by the heavens to soothe him. He had never thought he could one day not only\u00a0not\u00a0be anxious about separating from Song Yu, but also unable to hold himself back from rushing home.No matter when, as long as Song Yu gave him the slightest left-behind hint or signs, it would always be able to arouse his emotions.His phone vibrated \u2014 a message from Song Yu.[Gege: Home yet?]Yue Zhishi initially replied without thinking, but then he deleted the two words he typed in and instead, sent over his photo of the two textbook pages.[Yue Zhishi: You\u2019re too good at hiding things. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to hold it in for so long and would\u2019ve brought it out for you to see ages ago.]Reading Yue Zhishi\u2019s reply, Song Yu was distracted, thinking of how Yue Zhishi used to play hide and seek when they were younger. Yue Zhishi truly was just like how he said; if both of them were hiding together, Yue Zhishi would never be able to wait and stay still. If they still hadn\u2019t been found after a while, Yue Zhishi would always want to leave their hiding spot. Song Yu had always needed to cover his mouth, forcing him to stay with him and not letting him go out.Sometimes, Song Yu had the one seeking. If he called out Yue Zhishi\u2019s name in a room and if Yue Zhishi was in there, there would always be some noise or movement. So Yue Zhishi would always lose \u2014 because he could never keep hidden.But Song Yu hadn\u2019t been like that. As long as he wanted to hide, Yue Zhishi would never be able to find him. Yue Zhishi would start crying out of panic, and Song Yu would stand up by himself when he could no longer stand it.The relationship between them seemed to always be like this \u2014 they could never clearly tell who was the one forcing the other to do something.The dormitory door was suddenly opened. Song Yu came out of his daze and looked over to see Chen Fangyuan, who appeared to have just come back from outside. He noisily grumbled about how tired he was, chucking his bag onto his own desk. \u201cI thought it was going to flood for a week and was hoping for a holiday. Who\u2019d have thought all the water would\u2019ve disappeared today. It clearly isn\u2019t the right time to have an ocean view.\u201dAs he spoke, he saw the neatly arranged pastries on his desk and was a bit puzzled. He glanced at the other desks in the room, and then he shoved his hands into his pockets and strutted over to Song Yu.\u201cTsk tsk tsk\u2026\u201dSong Yu blankly lifted his head and gave him a look before he returned his eyes back to his book. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u201cTell me honestly, did you bring a girl in here?!\u201dSong Yu wrinkled his brows and flipped a page. He said calmly, \u201cYou must\u2019ve gone crazy.\u201dChen Fangyuan braced himself up on Song Yu\u2019s desk. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about lying to me. There are already gifts to us on our desk.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t even bother lifting his head. \u201cSomeone from my family sent it over. I put it on your desks.\u201d\u201cBullshit. You never placed things so nicely on our desks. Every time you came back with stuff from home, you\u2019d always left it on the window frame and told us to get it ourselves. Besides, look at this.\u201d Chen Fangyuan pointed at the flowers hanging on Song Yu\u2019s wall. \u201cLook at these little white flowers!\u201dBeing a full-blown drama queen, Chen Fangyuan stood in front of Song Yu\u2019s desk and laboriously sniffed at the flowers\u2019 fragrance like a little puppy. He then exclaimed, full of pleasure and satisfaction, \u201cAh, the perfume of my sister-in-law.\u201dSong Yu could feel goosebumps popping up on his skin. \u201c\u2026.You\u2019re sick.\u201d\u201cI have a very serious case of appearance obsession. Since your eyes are grown on the top of your head, anyone who can get you to lower them and give her a look must be a super gorgeous lady. She must definitely be a pale-skinned, beautiful, long-legged sweetheart. I want to see her.\u201dEven though he clearly knew Chen Fangyuan was someone who liked to constantly quip and make jokes, Song Yu seemed to be brainwashed by his diabolical chattering \u2014 he seriously compared his description one by one.Pale-skinned, beautiful, long-legged, sweetheart\u2026 Honestly, there wasn\u2019t much difference.Being mixed-race would probably be even better in Chen Fangyuan\u2019s eyes.\u201cI feel like my desk\u2019s been tidied by my sister-in-law, it\u2019s so clean.\u201d Chen Fangyuan jumped back over, rubbing the top of his desk. It was way too spotless, so he thought about how it\u2019d looked like before he left. \u201cI remember there were a few books lying around in a mess, and the chair wasn\u2019t pushed in neatly.\u201dSong Yu was speechless. \u201cI cleaned them up.\u201dChen Fangyuan directly rejected his words. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. You\u2019re not that good of a person \u2014 I definitely have a sister-in-law now. I want to see her!\u201d\u201cGo see her in your dreams.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t want to explain that the person who\u2019d visited was his younger brother. Besides, Chen Fangyuan wouldn\u2019t believe him even if he told him.As expected, when Chen Fangyuan saw the toiletries that had yet to be put away in the bathroom, he immediately started to loudly make a fuss.\u201cShe even stayed the night?! Song Yu, you! You\u2019ve got some guts!\u201dSong Yu popped in his earphones, sighing, \u201cI\u2019m not like that. You\u2019re overthinking it.\u201dOne week after Yue Zhishi returned back to school, Peiya held its 70th anniversary celebration ceremony. The school considered this anniversary year very important, and everything was done with great momentum and effort. The junior and high school departments were both brought together, and they loudly and happily celebrated for quite a few days.But the joy all belonged to others \u2014 Yue Zhishi, as a high school third year student, had no time to participate in anything.In this aspect, Peiya had always been very willing to spend money. In order to memorialise their 70th anniversary, the school leaders specifically invited a crew of professional cameramen to film the entire school celebrations. Yue Zhishi, who had no fate with the celebrations, was accidentally pulled to the side as he walked back to his classroom building with his classmates from the cafeteria. He was stopped by the filming director and was asked to record a short interview and blessings for Peiya.The school celebrations included parties and cultural festivals, and the scope of their invitations was very wide \u2014 even someone like Song Yu, who graduated three years ago, also received a message. It was just that he was too busy and didn\u2019t have the time to go back.And since Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t participating, Song Yu didn\u2019t think there was any need for him to go back.But on the night of the celebration ceremony, Song Yu received a WeChat link from Lin Rong as he sat in his dorm and wrote a report. Videos and photos all poured out once he opened it; Lin Rong had run over by herself to play.[Mom: I went to see Le Le and took some videos while I was there. Have a look!]At this point, it was entirely more like she\u2019d gone to see Le Le while she was there.Song Yu wasn\u2019t too interested in the photos and videos she sent over. He carelessly scrolled down, and since there wasn\u2019t anything new, he was about to close out of it. Just then, Lin Rong sent over a new message \u2014 this time, it was just a repost of an official WeChat account\u2019s post.[Mom: Xiao Yu, hurry and have a look, Le Le\u2019s in the video in this post! 3 minutes 12 seconds!]Song Yu only then clicked into it after seeing her message. The link jumped to Peiya Secondary School\u2019s official Weibo account and was an article recording all the celebrations held for this year\u2019s anniversary. Song Yu moved his mouse, looking for the video his mom mentioned, and finally saw it at the very bottom. It was captioned as Peiya students and teachers celebrating the school\u2019s 70th anniversary.He\u2019d just clicked on it when dormitory leader Wang Chengzhi walked over with his phone. \u201cSong Yu, have you filled in the application form? I\u2019ve sent it to you already.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll fill in it later.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Wang Chengzhi took a look at his laptop. \u201cSchool anniversary? You\u2019re from Peiya? I saw a lot of people posting it about it lately in my moments \u2014 guess they\u2019re all your school mates.\u201dSong Yu nodded. He directly forwarded the video to the 3 minutes 12 seconds Lin Rong had said and, sure enough, saw Yue Zhishi.In the video, that guy was walking around unsuspectingly and didn\u2019t even look at where he was going; he was even a bit stunned when he was stopped.The interview host was very friendly, guiding Yue Zhishi to look at the camera. \u201cHello, student. Have you participated in the Peiya anniversary celebrations lately?\u201dIt seemed like there was more than one camera \u2014 Yue Zhishi looked around for a while. \u201cAh, I\u2026 I\u2019m in my third year of high school. I don\u2019t have the time to get involved, but I\u2019m actually really envious of all the students who have.\u201dThe host then asked a few more questions, and Yue Zhishi answered them very sincerely and even stood very tall and straight.Seeing Song Yu watching so earnestly, Wang Chengzhi couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cThis handsome little fellow looks mixed. You know him?\u201dSong Yu glanced at his dormitory leader. \u201cYes, a little brother in my family.\u201d\u201cYou even have a brother, so lucky.\u201d Wang Chengzhi clearly misunderstood him. \u201cYour family genes go against the laws of nature.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t explain, and when he returned back to the video, the interview had already reached the stage of sending Peiya his blessings. Yue Zhishi smiled like a sunflower, his posture perfectly straight. \u201cI wish our school will be better every year and will continue on for another seventy years.\u201dAnother boy suddenly appeared in the video at this moment \u2014 he was very tall, taller than Yue Zhishi by over half a head. His hair was very short, and he threw an arm over Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulders from the back, his smile very bright. \u201cSeventy years isn\u2019t enough. Make it another seven hundred years.\u201dIn the video, Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t immediately push him off. Instead, he was amused enough to laugh. \u201cSeven hundred years is too long.\u201dThat boy continued holding onto Yue Zhishi with this intimate posture, and he even reached out a hand to the camera, shifting it into the shape of half a love heart. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t get it at first and was lightly shoved by the boy\u2019s shoulder \u2014 he only then understood, and Yue Zhishi foolishly laughed as he slapped away that boy\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re so strange.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so strange about this? Peiya, happy birthday!\u201dVery quickly, the camera shot changed, and the people in the video became other students. Wang Chengzhi was just sighing, \u201cYour brother\u2019s looks stand out among the crowd of people in the video. Even though that other student just now was also a bit good-looking, he\u2019s a long way off from your brother.\u201dAs he spoke, he noticed Song Yu didn\u2019t respond and was being a bit strange. He lowered his head and looked at him \u2014 Song Yu\u2019s mood seemed to have changed for the worse.Was it just his imagination?Song Yu didn\u2019t watch that video anymore. He closed it right away and opened his chat with Wang Chengzhi to find that form.\u201cIs this the application you were talking about?\u201dWang Chengzhi replied, \u201cAh, yes\u2026 just send it to me after you\u2019ve filled it in.\u201dWhat the hell, he felt like a completely different person.That night, Song Yu was extraordinarily reticent. And completely unusually, he got into bed really early, looking as he was planning to sleep. Chen Fangyuan was in the bed across from him and felt like something was wrong, so he sent a message to Wang Chengzhi.[Chen Fangyuan: What\u2019s wrong with Sending Fish today? He\u2019s in bed so early, he can\u2019t be sick, can he?][Wang Chengzhi: I don\u2019t know, he was a bit weird earlier when he was filling in the application form. I think he suddenly became unhappy after watching a video.][Chen Fangyuan: Video? Fuck, my Fish bro wouldn\u2019t have been cheated on??][Wang Chengzhi: \u2026\u2026how is that possible, he doesn\u2019t even have a partner. How could he get cheated on when he\u2019s not dating.][Chen Fangyuan: I think he does, my sixth sense is telling me Song Yu is dating.]The Song Yu laying in bed had entirely no idea of his two roommates\u2019 chat. He simply wanted to sleep earlier, but contrarily to what he wanted, the more he wanted to sleep early, the less he was able to fall asleep.He opened his phone once again, the light shining onto the wall. He hesitated and then opened the chat history between him and Lin Rong, staring at that link \u2014 he was about to click on it, but then a new WeChat notification popped up. It was Yue Zhishi.[Yue Zhishi: Gege, I got a really high score for this week\u2019s math test, look.]Yue Zhishi sent across a photo of his test paper and then very happily pulled out the paper again to look at it. Not long after, he received Song Yu\u2019s reply.[Gege: Mn.]Only a \u2018mn\u2019? Yue Zhishi was a bit disappointed at this reply, but he noticed, at the very top of the chat, that Song Yu was currently typing. He patiently waited and waited, waited until the currently typing indicator disappeared and yet no new messages appeared. After a little while longer, it once again said Song Yu was currently typing\u2026Yue Zhishi impatiently sent over a message.[Yue Zhishi: Are you writing an essay gege]One minute later, he finally received a message from Song Yu.He first sent over a screenshot of Yue Zhishi\u2019s interview. The screenshot was of nothing else except that incomplete love heart.[Gege: Is this the guy who was dragging you to play games?]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He prepared to press the voice call button, but he accidentally pressed the wrong option and sent over a video call request instead.As he moved about in a panic, Yue Zhishi wanted to quickly hang up and send over a new request before Song Yu noticed \u2014 but Song Yu actually picked up the video call.In the camera, Song Yu\u2019s side was completely dark, looking as if all the lights in his room had already been turned off. The only source of light was from Song Yu\u2019s phone screen, and it was only enough to illuminate Song Yu\u2019s face.It was strange \u2014 Song Yu turned incredibly good-looking underneath this kind of light. The camera was very close to his face, and his facial features were very much magnified. It was almost as if he was right next to him.Yue Zhishi stared at him for a little bit. His phone vibrated, so he left the video call screen to see a message from Song Yu.[Gege: Why a video call?][Gege: Dorm lights are all off, I can\u2019t talk.]Yue Zhishi returned back to the video call and gave Song Yu an OK hand sign, telling him, \u201cI originally wanted to voice call, I just accidentally pressed the wrong button.\u201dHis phone vibrated again.[Gege: Then I\u2019m hanging up.]Yue Zhishi immediately shook his head at Song Yu. \u201cDon\u2019t don\u2019t don\u2019t, I want to video chat with you, just for a little while.\u201d[Gege: Don\u2019t you have anything to explain?]Yue Zhishi only then remembered why he originally wanted to call. \u201cAh, right. You were talking about games. I don\u2019t really play anymore, I haven\u2019t played even once ever since I came back. The guy in the screenshot is the classmate who played with me last time. I\u2019ve told you this before, but how did you know it was him?\u201dIn the video, Yue Zhishi could see Song Yu\u2019s flat lips. He didn\u2019t look very happy, so Yue Zhishi softened his voice and called out, gege. Only then did his phone vibrate again.[Gege: I guessed.]\u201cYou\u2019re so amazing, you got it right on the first guess. I actually only played with him two or three times. He plays more often with the other guys in our class.\u201d[Gege: Are you guys close?]After reading that message, Yue Zhishi picked up the yoghurt on his desk, took a sip and casually said, \u201cWe\u2019re okay. I get along well with everyone else in our class.\u201dSong Yu typed in a few words, deciding at the end to delete and change the person he wanted to compare with.[Gege: What about compared to Jiang Yufan.]Yue Zhishi pretty much replied without a single bit of hesitation. \u201cThat\u2019s not a valid comparison at all, we only met in 2nd year after our year split class streams. Of course my relationship with Jiang Yufan is the strongest.\u201dSong Yu felt the tightness in his chest relax upon hearing Yue Zhishi\u2019s words.He didn\u2019t know whether his intuition was right or not, but he truly wasn\u2019t in a good mood after watching that video.It wasn\u2019t often Yue Zhishi had the opportunity to video chat with Song Yu, so he took the chance to tell gege a bunch of stuff that had recently happened. How much weight Cotton Candy recently gained again, how many cans of cat food Orange ate every day \u2014 Song Yu\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change much under the camera, but he flipped over, looking as if he shifted over to a more comfortable, more relaxed sleeping position.As he continued looking at the screen, Yue Zhishi also lay down on his desk without realising, his head on its side resting in the crook of his elbows. Song Yu\u2019s eyelashes were very obvious at such a close distance, the contours of his face right in front of Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes.He quietly watched him, and Yue Zhishi felt like he once again returned to that night he and Song Yu had been trapped together due to the storm.\u201cGege, how come you\u2019re sleeping so early? Are you really tired?\u201dAfter listening to Yue Zhishi speak for such a long time, Song Yu was a bit absent-minded and forgot he couldn\u2019t open his mouth to speak. He said, \u201cMn.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t chat with you for too long then, in case I\u2019m bothering your sleep. I still need to memorise some texts.\u201d Yue Zhishi was afraid Song Yu was still thinking he was playing games, so he specifically said, \u201cI\u2019m going to uninstall that game in a bit, I\u2019ll download it again after the exams.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t speak, but the curve of his mouth slightly eased. Yue Zhishi smiled at him and said, \u201cHurry and sleep. Good night.\u201d\u201cGood night.\u201dSong Yu subconsciously murmured in reply and then hung up the video. He abruptly heard sneaky laughter spiralling through the dorm room and uncertainly turned around. Three cell phone torches shone directly at him, almost exactly as if he was being interrogated by three people at the same time.\u201cWho\u2019re you saying good night to, handsome man \u2014 you\u2019re being so attentive, your ice cool persona\u2019s smashed to bits.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much, he\u2019s definitely saying good night to me.\u201d\u201cFuck, is someone else losing their single status in our dorm?\u201d\u201cYou guys really have nothing else to talk about.\u201d Song Yu put in his earphones, closing his eyes to sleep.This time, he fell asleep very quickly.The college entrance exams were imminent. A large countdown number was written on the upper right hand corner of the classroom\u2019s blackboard, and it changed every day, the number reducing as the days passed.Everyone started arriving earlier and earlier and started leaving later and later \u2014 all of their energy and time were invested into their final sprint of studying.The atmosphere felt like it was being compressed tighter as well. The air turned so heavy it was hard to move, and it pressed onto everyone\u2019s shoulders together along with all the knowledge they couldn\u2019t remember.Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart was much lighter, his psychological state more peaceful compared to everyone else. His desk mate had already cried twice, and she\u2019d even hid from Yue Zhishi the first time as she cried in the female bathroom. When she returned with red eyes, Yue Zhishi knew she was stressed and gave her the rainbow candy he\u2019d just bought. For the second time, she directly collapsed and cried onto her desk.\u201cCome on, Zhang Yueyue, you\u2019re already crying when it\u2019s not even the exams yet.\u201dHearing someone joke like this, Yue Zhishi said seriously, \u201cCrying is an effective way of relieving stress. You should cry before the exams \u2014 it\u2019ll be too late to cry after.\u201dAnd just like that, the last ten-odd days before the college entrances exams streaked by in chaos and turmoil. The last night before the exams arrived in a flash, and in order to relax them all, their class adviser stood at the podium and told them her embarrassing stories back when she\u2019d taken the exams. As he sat there and listened, Yue Zhishi fell into a bit of a daze.He\u2019d clearly really hated waking up so early and coming home so late every day. He hated reviewing and memorising all the different kinds of little knowledge requirements day in and day out and hated answering the same kinds of questions again and again. These kind of monotonous, dull and tightly scheduled days \u2014 he had looked forward to them ending earlier every day.But when the day finally arrived and he could see the end, Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t willing to leave those days behind.There were still thirty seconds to the end of the night self-study session. A boy in their class suddenly yelled out, \u201cHigh school year 3, class 10,\u00a0jiayou!\u201dEveryone was originally a bit stunned, but after only two, three seconds, someone laughed \u2014 and someone followed along and yelled out\u00a0jiayou\u00a0as well. More and more people joined in, and their loud voices passed through the walls and spread to the next door class.They didn\u2019t know how, but the entire high school third year students started yelling and screaming. Their voices reverberated through the entire building \u2014 as if they were all cheering on each other.After he rode home, Yue Zhishi drank a cup of warm milk under Lin Rong\u2019s instructions. He showered and cleaned up early, got into bed and checked all the things he needed to bring tomorrow to the examination centre before preparing to go to sleep.It was only 10:30pm when he lay down on his bed.There was no way he could fall asleep.He tossed and turned for a very long time, and Yue Zhishi realised his heart was beating very quickly. His brain couldn\u2019t stop thinking about tomorrow, and he became more awake the longer he thought about it.He was too nervous.He pulled out his phone. The lock screen lit up \u2014 it was the photo he\u2019d taken of Wuhan U\u2019s front entrance the last time he was there. He stared at it for a long time in the darkness. He didn\u2019t come back to attention until a message from Song Yu appeared.[Gege: Remember to double check every pen to see if they work. Relax.]How could it be so easy. Yue Zhishi felt gloomy: when it was Song Yu\u2019s turn for the entrance exams, it was Yue Zhishi who\u2019d fallen sick from nervousness, and now when it was finally his turn, he was still so nervous. He was nervous twice for something he was going to take only once \u2014 what a loss.He felt there was no way he was going to fall asleep if he continued on this way. He hesitated for a time before he finally couldn\u2019t hold himself back from giving Song Yu a call. The phone rang only once, and then it was picked up.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice was incredibly low through the airwaves. As it passed to him in the darkness of nighttime, it gave Yue Zhishi a concrete sense of comfort, as if it was a grey cloud. It looked very cold, but when he reached out a hand to touch it, he could feel its softness.Yue Zhishi was snuggled underneath his blanket. He flipped over, saying, \u201cI have a bit of insomnia.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201dHe heard Song Yu deliberately lowering the volume of his voice.\u201cMn. I tried sleeping, but maybe I\u2019m too nervous, because the more I tell myself to sleep the more I feel awake. Can you talk to me for a bit and distract me?\u201dSong Yu was quiet for two seconds. \u201cAre you sure you won\u2019t be even less likely to sleep after hearing me talk?\u201dYue Zhishi thought for a bit and felt Song Yu was right \u2014 but there was an exception. \u201cBut when you talk to me about math questions, I get sleepy so easily.\u201dIt sounded like Song Yu lightly laughed, over the phone. Yue Zhishi keenly heard him, so he laughed as well.\u201cWhere can I find math questions for you right now?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice carried a slight hint of helplessness.\u201cTrue.\u201d Yue Zhishi closed his eyes, imagining Song Yu was right next to him. \u201cThen can you pretend to be a math teacher and lecture to me about something I\u2019d fall asleep to?\u201dSome scuffling noises transferred over through the phone, and they sounded like someone was looking for something. Very quickly, Yue Zhishi heard Song Yu stand up and move somewhere else; the background sounds changed, and it sounded like there was a lot of empty space where Song Yu was.After a few seconds, he heard Song Yu quietly ask, \u201cWhat do you think about Oxford\u2019s\u00a0Very Short Introductions: Mathematics?\u201d\u201cEven just the title of it sounds really sleep-inducing,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, agreeing.He heard the sound of pages turning, and shortly after, Song Yu started speaking in a deep voice. His speaking voice was very low with very little emotional fluctuations, but it resonated very beautifully and calmed Yue Zhishi\u2019s restless spirits.\u201c\u2026When we examine the answer to a physics problem, eighty to ninety percent of the time, we can draw a clear line between the scientific and mathematical contributions to the answer\u2026\u201dThe words he recited were obscure and hard to understand. But as they entered into Yue Zhishi\u2019s ear, the words seemed to peel away and become simple audio waves, pouring into Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart. It felt like he was moving up and down with the undulation of the waves, and his breathing slowed, his limbs slackening \u2014 he finally entered a calm and serene state of mind.\u201c\u2026It turns out that even very simple models of the\u00a0interacting particle system\u00a0are extremely complex. They have led to exceedingly difficult to solve \u2014 in fact, most of the unsolved \u2014 mathematical problems.\u201dAs he heard the steady breathing from over the phone, Song Yu slowed down the speed of his words until he finally came to a stop.The most complicated, hardest to solve problem in the world seemed to have temporarily received some peace.\u201cGood night.\u201dStanding in an empty corridor, Song Yu softly closed the book in his hands. He stood there quietly for a moment and then returned back to his dorm.\u2013The time during the exams seemed to flow at a different speed compared to all other times. It felt like he\u2019d only just entered the examination centre and watched the proctor open the sealed bag of exams \u2014 and then suddenly, one day had gone by.After finishing his first day, Yue Zhishi felt like he\u2019d done quite well. The math exam had quite a few questions he\u2019d specifically studied for. Peiya had organised a school bus to take them all back to school, and students on the bus were all comparing answers. He didn\u2019t want to listen to them, so he put on his earphones and listened to music.People were saying their examination questions had entered onto Weibo\u2019s hot searches. Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t in the mood to look it up \u2014 he only opened the chat between him and Song Yu.[Yue Zhishi: The book you read to me yesterday was great for sleeping.][Yue Zhishi: Do you read it too when you can\u2019t sleep?]He only received Song Yu\u2019s reply when they were about to get off the bus, Song Yu\u2019s helplessness towards him leaking through the words.[Gege: I don\u2019t read this kind of book because I need to sleep.]Yue Zhishi laughed at his phone.The English and literature analysis exams the second day were both his strengths, but Yue Zhishi still begged Song Yu to read another night\u2019s worth of that book. Song Yu agreed.A senior sister in the same research lab saw Song Yu stand up and head towards the kitchenette next door with a thick book in his hands. She thought he wanted to take a break \u2014 he\u2019d worked through the entire day without even eating dinner, all just to finish organising the data earlier.She thought for a bit and then opened a drawer. She pulled out a bag of granola and a packet of oreos and got up, preparing to give them to her junior brother.She walked to the entrance of the kitchenette and saw Song Yu\u2019s back. He wore earphones and recited out the book\u2019s contents in a speed neither too fast or too slow \u2014 his voice didn\u2019t really sound different, but the tone of it was completely different compared to what he usually used in the research lab, no longer cold and emotionless.This was very tricky to hear, because he wasn\u2019t reciting some prose poetry, but rather some boring mathematics and science book \u2014 and yet the flow of emotions concealed in his voice was crystal clear and easily heard.Her intuition told her not to bother him, and so she lightly closed the door, placing the granola and cookies onto Song Yu\u2019s empty workspace.She suddenly realised \u2014 this perpetually taciturn and uncommunicative junior brother wasn\u2019t really all that different.Desperately compressing the amount of work even three days might not be enough to complete into two days \u2014 he was probably rushing to go somewhere, to see someone.Yue Zhishi was full of energy from the nighttime\u2019s sleeping aid reading materials. He specialised in the second day\u2019s exam topics, and the weather was also fantastic. Everything went very smoothly, and when the bell finally rang at the end, he finally looked at the name written on the exam paper.It felt like he was participating in a long-distance stamina test. He kept desperately running forward, following the rules and wishes of other people in a never-ending struggle with his willpower.When it reached the final second, the timer on the stop watch was pressed. The energy from his entire body leaked away, and he left this track that had trapped him.It was finally finished.Everyone was much calmer than expected, with only one student loudly yelling out something after he left the exam venue. Yue Zhishi followed along in the bustling streams of people, heading outside; there were many parents and families waiting, and he had nowhere to focus his eyes, only a tiny thought telling him to repeatedly search around.And finally, his eyes accidentally met with another pair of eyes.Song Yu wore a white t-shirt and blue jeans, his head covered with the baseball cap Yue Zhishi had worn last time to see him at Wuhan U. He gave him a very slight smile.He clearly was dressed very normally, and yet Yue Zhishi felt all the light had wrapped around his body.He ran forward, stopping in front of Song Yu.\u201cLooks like you did well.\u201d Song Yu simply assessed his mood.Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t hide the smile on his face. \u201cI\u2019m already really close to my first college entrance exams wish \u2014 looks like the koi fish at Wuhan U really did protect me after all.\u201dSong Yu raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou stepped on it, and yet it still protected you \u2014 what a fish to repay injury with kindness.\u201dThe two of them saw Lin Rong and Song Jin not too far away as they continued speaking and waved at them. It had been a while since the entire family gathered together, and Lin Rong sat in the passenger seat, happily chattering away. To Yue Zhishi, it felt like he entered some kind of time loop \u2014 it felt like he returned to three years ago, with Uncle Song driving the car and Aunt Rong sitting in the passenger seat as they carefully planned out what to do after the exams.\u201cLet\u2019s eat at home, I already made the dishes you two like the most as well as a cheesecake and some\u00a0mango pomelo sago.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded. He watched as Song Yu leaned back against the upholstered seat and quietly asked when he arrived.\u201cJust then. I took the subway over,\u201d Song Yu said very simply.Taking the subway must\u2019ve been very tiring. Yue Zhishi asked again, \u201cYou didn\u2019t drive?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a bit sleepy.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s elbow was wedged against the car windowsill as he held his chin. \u201cIt\u2019ll be dangerous to drive.\u201dYue Zhishi moved a bit closer and pulled at Song Yu\u2019s arm. He patted his own shoulder, his face confidently saying he was worth relying on. \u201cYou can sleep on me.\u201dSong Yu glanced at him and then turned his face away. \u201cI\u2019m not a child like you.\u201dLin Rong couldn\u2019t help but laugh after hearing that exchange. \u201cNow that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. In this car today, Le Le is the biggest.\u201dSong Jin was driving, but he very cooperatively asked why. Lin Rong said, \u201cBecause examinees are the biggest.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Yue Zhishi pulled at Song Yu, simply just to drag him to his own shoulder. \u201cJust sleep on me for a bit, we\u2019ll be home when you wake up.\u201dAs if afraid Song Yu wouldn\u2019t agree, Yue Zhishi leaned in, right to his ear, and said very softly, \u201cJust think of it as a gift in return for the last two days. Didn\u2019t you also help me sleep?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s hand grabbed at his shoulder, and he felt like Song Yu\u2019s body stiffened for a bit. Luckily, his argument seemed to have worked \u2014 Song Yu agreed at the end. He curved over a bit unwillingly, shifting around for a better position and looking as if he wasn\u2019t really satisfied. Yue Zhishi thought he wanted to get back up and said in a bit of fluster, \u201cDo my shoulder bones stick out too much? Are you not comfortable?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dIn the next moment, the Song Yu who Yue Zhishi thought was going to sit straight back up, tugged the brim of his cap lower and lay back down. But this time, he wasn\u2019t aiming for Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder \u2014 he directly lay down on Yue Zhishi\u2019s legs.\u201cThis is much better.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He couldn\u2019t help thinking of his childhood \u2014 he seemed to have constantly slept on Song Yu\u2019s legs, and he would always sleep particularly well.Now that the roles were reversed, Yue Zhishi felt it was an interesting experience. At the same time, he felt a subtle sense of responsibility and didn\u2019t dare move at all, worried Song Yu would be uncomfortable and wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep.He lowered his head and looked at the light hand Song Yu had rested on his knee. His fingers were very long, each joint clearly defined. It was the nicest looking hand Yue Zhishi had seen since he was a child.And the most important thing was \u2014 he was still wearing that old watch.Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but have a slight sense of regret. If he\u2019d known Song Yu would always keep wearing it, he would\u2019ve earned more at that time and bought gege a better, more expensive watch.The car moved calmly, but they had just entered rush hour. It was very noisy outside, so Yue Zhishi mimicked how Song Yu soothed him to sleep, placing his own hand softly onto the side of Song Yu\u2019s face, and looked outside.The clouds wrapped around the setting sun turned into a gentle and soft pastel orange colour.The sky was like a bowl of clear\u00a0white fungus sweet soup, slightly yellow with a large piece of grapefruit flavoured marshmallow floating on top.Song Yu woke up when they were close to home. He pulled off his cap and very quickly fixed up his hair before putting it back on and stretching his neck. He woke up so coincidentally that Yue Zhishi wondered if he had truly fallen asleep.\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s urgent enquiry was like a newly downloaded app immediately asking for user feedback and rating.Song Yu only looked out the window, not looking at him.\u201cIt was fine.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t really hear any tone to those words, but Yue Zhishi was already very happy despite his legs being a bit numb.All four of them sat together in a rare family dinner and celebrated Yue Zhishi surviving the the difficult college entrance exams. Song Jin couldn\u2019t help but drink some alcohol, and as he ate, he started talking about Yue Zhishi\u2019s father. His face was flushed, and he almost started crying \u2014 luckily, both Yue Zhishi and Lin Rong were there to gently calm him down, so he didn\u2019t actually cry.\u201cYue Yi would\u2019ve died laughing if he saw you like this.\u201d Lin Rong returned back to her seat, giving Song Jin a bowl of soup. \u201cHow old are you?\u201dSong Jin gave a long sigh. \u201cThe last few days, I\u2019ve been talking to Yue Yi in my office every day, telling him to protect Le Le and to not have anything bad happen. Everything needed to go smoothly.\u201dHis office desk still held a photo of the two of them, taken during high school.Hearing this, Song Yu asked, without any expression on his face, \u201cDid he talk back to you?\u201dYue Zhishi cracked up, laughing until he collapsed onto Song Yu\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIf he did, then that\u2019ll be a spiritual photo.\u201d\u201cBut everything went so smoothly for you this time. It didn\u2019t rain during your exams \u2014 really such good luck.\u201d Lin Rong couldn\u2019t help but emotionally sigh, \u201cIf Yue Yi and Olivia knew about this, they would definitely be very happy. Ah, that\u2019s right.\u201d Lin Rong seemed to suddenly remember something, abruptly getting up and leaving the table. She held a photo album when she came back, and the photos inside were individual photos of Yue Zhishi when he took part of that interview last time during the school celebrations.\u201cLook, our Le Le\u2019s so handsome. These high points in life must always be saved.\u201dYue Zhishi ate a large piece of\u00a0pork rib steamed in rice flour, and as he chewed, he said, \u201cThis can\u2019t be considered as one of the high points in my life, I was only randomly pulled into the interview.\u201d\u201cBut they only grabbed you because you were good-looking, or else why wouldn\u2019t they also randomly interview other people?\u201d Lin Rong gave the photo album to Song Yu, telling him to hand it to Yue Zhishi. She remembered that she\u2019d sent him some messages on WeChat that day. \u201cDid you see the photos I sent you of the celebrations? And your brother\u2019s interview video?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s face obviously turned annoyed at this reminder. \u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYou sound so perfunctory. Not only do you sneer at motherly love now, but you\u2019re also starting to scoff at your brother?\u201dSong Yu had nothing to say to this teasing, stuffing the photo album into Yue Zhishi\u2019s hands.Lin Rong gave Yue Zhishi a piece of\u00a0stir-fried chilli ciba-style fish. \u201cTalking about that interview, it was such a coincidence that Shen Mi was also interviewed with you. That child\u2019s so amusing.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Yue Zhishi focused on eating his fish and didn\u2019t really respond to Lin Rong. But Song Yu \u2014 he looked at Lin Rong, frowning. \u201cWho\u2019s Shen Mi?\u201d\u201cSee, I knew you didn\u2019t watch that video.\u201d Lin Rong acted as if she caught him in a lie, shaking her head, and explained, \u201cShen Mi is that tall boy who later showed up, Le Le\u2019s classmate after they split classes. That child\u2019s particularly amusing. Le Le once forgot his phone on the bus when it was raining, and he ran here to give it back to him. He\u2019s a good child.\u201dSong Yu was baffled and twisted his head over to ask Yue Zhishi, \u201cYou can even lose your phone?\u201dYue Zhishi was a bit confused when he lifted up his head. \u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t know either. I was wearing such thick clothes in the winter, it must\u2019ve fallen out from my pocket.\u201dSong Jin seemed to finally remember. \u201cAh, that boy. Is he the one who later came to help out at Yanghe Qizhe?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Lin Rong took a sip of her mango pomelo sago. \u201cShen Mi was passing by and helped me moved quite a few things. That child really knows how to talk, and his personality\u2019s especially nice \u2014 I kept him here for dinner, and he even gave me flowers.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t really pay much attention to their conversation, only silently finishing his own bowl of sago. He looked over and realised Song Yu had barely touched his own bowl. \u201cGege, how come you\u2019re not eating?\u201dSong Yu stayed silent for two seconds, and only then did he lower his head to finish his dessert.After finishing dinner, Yue Zhishi and Lin Rong went downstairs together to walk the dog and help their stomachs digest. When they came back, they saw Song Jin sitting in the living room by himself, watching a basketball game.\u201cWhere\u2019s your son?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been upstairs the entire time, hasn\u2019t come down at all.\u201d Song Jin\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t move from the television.\u201cHe\u2019s probably asleep again.\u201d Lin Rong had been bitten a few times by mosquitoes, so she took out some ointment for herself. She pulled Yue Zhishi over, checking if he had any bites, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re okay, they didn\u2019t bite you. Darling, go see if Orange ate dinner yet. He doesn\u2019t seem to be eating lately, he better not be sick.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded and wandered around the first floor a few times without seeing any signs of Orange. He\u2019d only just gone upstairs when he saw Orange in front of the Song Yu\u2019s room, lifting his paws and scratching the door twice \u2014 he looked as if he wanted to stand up and lean his entire body onto the door.\u201cFound you.\u201dThe door wasn\u2019t fully shut, so a small crack in the doorway appeared as soon as Orange fell onto the door. He took advantage of the space and slithered in, Yue Zhishi a step too late to catch him. Yue Zhishi could only go in and get him.Once he got to the doorway, he saw Orange jumping onto the bed. Yue Zhishi softly called out once to Song Yu as he stood outside the door; there was no response, so he went in, realising Song Yu was sleeping in bed.The lights weren\u2019t turned on in the room, and it was very dark. Yue Zhishi toed off his slippers, heading in with his feet bare, and planned to leave as soon as he caught Orange. But that cat was just too sly \u2014 he snuggled straight into Song Yu\u2019s arms. Song Yu was wearing earphones, and he truly seemed very tired as he continued sleeping very deeply.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s eat dinner.\u201d Yue Zhishi held out a little cat toy, whispering to him. He wanted to take him away, but Orange only grumbled and turned his back to him.Yue Zhishi sighed. He stood at the side of the bed and watched Song Yu\u2019s sleeping face for a few seconds. Moonlight slid in through the gap in the curtains, falling onto Song Yu\u2019s face \u2014 it softened his sharp eyebrows.He felt he couldn\u2019t stand there in a daze for much longer, so he bent over, wanting to carry Orange out of Song Yu\u2019s arms. But Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t personally carried the orange cat for a very long time \u2014 he incorrectly estimated the cat\u2019s weight and didn\u2019t manage to successfully pull him out. Not only that, his feet accidentally slipped on the floor, and his entire body planted onto Song Yu\u2019s bed.Seeing Song Yu frown and start to crack open his eyes, Yue Zhishi gave Song Yu an awkward smile without panicking. \u201cI\u2026 I actually only wanted to take Orange away and accidentally\u2026\u201d\u201cAccidentally gifted yourself onto my bed.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice was very deep, and his arm covered his eyes.The way he said it was very strange, but it did match what happened.Yue Zhishi originally wanted to get up; he should be getting up, but seeing Song Yu wasn\u2019t angry, he wanted to stay in his bed for a bit. So he shifted forward, saying, \u201cIf you sleep now, will you be able to sleep tonight?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s eyes were covered, and Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t see them all \u2014 he could only stare at his lips. The corners of his mouth were very straight, his lips faintly separated. Song Yu only opened his mouth after a few seconds passed, and he said, voice carrying some lingering weariness, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s bad to reverse your biological clock.\u201d Yue Zhishi reached out and grabbed the arm Song Yu rested on top of his eyes. He pulled it away and then squeezed Song Yu\u2019s palm again and again. His voice was still very soft, not daring to be noisy. \u201cYou\u2019ve already slept for two hours. You won\u2019t be able to sleep again if you continue sleeping.\u201dHis voice lilted upwards at the end, as if he was cutely whining. Song Yu didn\u2019t open his eyes, only saying, \u201cSo your mission changed from taking Orange away to taking me away.\u201dYue Zhishi laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much the same thing.\u201dHe was still humouring a cat.Song Yu tilted his face over, looking at Yue Zhishi. His voice was lazy, his words coming very slowly. \u201cThen since you\u2019ve woken me up, what would you like to do?\u201dHis words held an ambiguous, teasing undertone, yet Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t catch it at all. He directly crawled in front of Song Yu, and the distance between them shortened in one breath.This time, Song Yu wanted to dodge away.\u201cCan you go somewhere with me?\u201d Yue Zhishi blinked, his hand still tightly holding onto Song Yu\u2019s palm.He must\u2019ve still been half-asleep to agree to Yue Zhishi\u2019s request. Song Yu was really very tired, and he really hated being woken up by other people \u2014 but if it was Yue Zhishi, his temper completely disappeared.And the extent of his patience towards Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t limited to just this.\u2013It was 9:30pm, and the two of them stood on the sidewalk directly across from Peiya\u2019s school entrance, cars driving back and forth in front of them. Song Yu tugged at the uniform jacket on his body \u2014 it used to be too large, and now it fit perfectly. He asked Yue Zhishi in utter incomprehension: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we come tomorrow? You can openly go in tomorrow and get your books.\u201d\u201cBut you won\u2019t be able to go in. I already said earlier \u2014 I want to come here together with you.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes aimed directly at the entrance and saw many junior high students already coming out from their night self-study sessions. More and more people started to come out, spreading from the school to the nearby streets. Yue Zhishi took this chance and pulled Song Yu, running in the direction of the school.\u201cWe\u2019ll just pretend we\u2019re junior high students who forgot something. Don\u2019t talk, and don\u2019t look at the security guards.\u201dSong Yu let him pull him along, as if he was a little fish-shaped balloon with no free will.Even though the two of them were truly eye-catching in a crowd of people, their uniforms meant the security guards didn\u2019t try to stop them. After they successfully sneaked their way into the school, Yue Zhishi was incredibly excited and turned around to say to Song Yu, \u201cHasn\u2019t it been a long time since you came back? Does it feel like you\u2019ve returned back to high school?\u201dSong Yu was as steady as he always was, only taking off his jacket and revealing the white t-shirt underneath. \u201cThis is what you want for the exams?\u201d\u201cThis is one of my requests.\u201d Greed filled Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice. He ran down the stairs, his hair lifting from the summer night breeze and his jacket rising from the wind \u2014 he was like a carefree, unrestrained bird.As he gazed at his receding figure, Song Yu\u2019s heart also lightened, by just a tad.It had been too long since he last came to Peiya. Song Yu\u2019d thought he would find it very foreign to him, but the school still looked exactly the same. Not much had changed, except for an old school building that had been meant to be torn down; it was now a new laboratory building. All the cats that used to be here \u2014 they were now all dispersed into the myriad lights and warmth of many families.He\u2019d clearly already left for three years, and yet, in that moment, Song Yu felt as if he was just here yesterday, living through busy yet simple high school days and pretending to be strangers with Yue Zhishi.\u201cThere\u2019s no one here, let\u2019s go in.\u201dThey went in against the stream of people leaving from school and arrived at the sports ground. Peiya\u2019s sports ground was surrounded by wire mesh; the entrance was already locked, but everyone knew there was a broken side door near the\u00a0Yifu teaching building. The lock had been broken long ago, and the door could only be simply closed.\u201cDo you know about this door?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Song Yu had sometimes followed Qin Yan here during lunch to play basketball. They were only able to get in through the side door.He followed Yue Zhishi in \u2014 they were like two fishes escaping from the net, leaving one large mesh to slither into another smaller one. Song Yu thought ahead, out of habit. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried someone will come by later and catch you?\u201d\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be, right?\u201d Yue Zhishi always liked to leave things to chance, always thinking on the bright side. \u201cAll the third year teachers and students aren\u2019t here today, so there\u2019s definitely less people on patrol compared to usual. If we really do get caught, then we\u2019ll just run. As if our long legs won\u2019t be able to outrun shorter ones.\u201dHe was always able to speak with such plausibility.Cicadas chirped through the dreary summer night. A breeze occasionally weaved through the poplar tree forest, fluttering to the sports ground and carrying the thick, sticky air of June. Yue Zhishi walked closely to Song Yu as they arrived at the three-point line on the basketball court. He lowered his head, fixing his gaze on their shadows on the floor \u2014 the shadows were long, and they interlaced each other, the rich darkness of them touching and mingling together on the ground before separating very quickly.They were more intimate than the two of them in real life.An unfamiliar feeling surged in his heart \u2014 he couldn\u2019t explain what it was.\u201cIn the past, I really did want to graduate as quickly as I could. I wanted to leave this place as fast as possible.\u201d Yue Zhishi looked at the small grove near the sports ground. \u201cI sat on the stone stool over there every day before exams, memorising my texts. My arm was all swollen from mosquito bites, and after going back home, I needed to take some allergy meds and then continue studying.\u201dHe released a long sigh. \u201cBut who would\u2019ve thought my high school life would end so quickly? I will never have it again \u2014 today is the last day.\u201dSeeing him like this, Song Yu slightly wanted to laugh. He paused where he was, standing in the exact centre of the basketball court, and turned his body around to look at him. \u201cSo you chose to come here specifically to kill time?\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t killing time\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi originally wanted to protest, but since he had nothing to argue with, he could only admit to it. \u201cYes. That\u2019s right. The me before today didn\u2019t have time.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s face tilted towards the moonlight, the wistfulness from just then mostly disappearing, and he smiled beautifully. \u201cBut the me right now does \u2014 so the first thing I want to do after exams is to throw away my time.\u201dTogether with you, I want to squander and throw away my last day in high school.Song Yu seemed to smile, not replying. For the two of them, they didn\u2019t seem to need to always, constantly respond to each other.Yue Zhishi suddenly noticed something and made a noise. Song Yu thought a small animal had passed by, when actually it was basketball caught in between the basketball hoop and the backboard.\u201cSomeone definitely left this here to mark their spot.\u201d Yue Zhishi ran over.There were many boys in Peiya. With both the junior and high school departments added together, the basketball courts became a highly sought after commodity, and everyone frequently left a basketball in the courts \u2014 if a court had a ball left there, then that meant someone had preemptively already taken the spot. This had already become a long-established practice.Yue Zhishi stood underneath the hoop, stretching out his arms and jumping up. His fingers pushed the ball down, and after catching it, he hit the ball once, the sound of it landing on the ground diffusing across the empty basketball court.\u201cCan you teach me how to dunk?\u201d Yue Zhishi threw the ball over after he asked.Song Yu caught it very nimbly and asked why he wanted to learn.\u201cI always kept getting blocked, so I want to try dunking.\u201d Yue Zhishi looked at the hoop very defiantly. \u201cMaybe I can\u2019t jump high enough.\u201d\u201cThe move is more for show, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t know how to do it. You just need to know how to do layups \u2014 getting points is most important.\u201dBut Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t convinced by Song Yu\u2019s pragmatism. He only wanted to dunk, so he implored Song Yu to give it a try. \u201cYou definitely know how to do it, I heard Jiang Yufan say Wuhan U\u2019s geomatics basketball team is really strong. Aren\u2019t you also in the team? Gege, dunk one for me to see.\u201dSong Yu stood there, dribbling the ball a few times. At the end, he couldn\u2019t help but agree to do it.He flexed his ankles and neck, and then he went forward with the ball \u2014 he jumped up with one foot, and his left arm directly grabbed onto the basket, right arm winging up to slam the ball in. The entire basketball stand wobbled.Yue Zhishi watched in a daze. Not only did Song Yu dunk in the ball so easily, he even grabbed onto the rim.\u201cSong Yu gege, you\u2019re too amazing.\u201dHearing Yue Zhishi\u2019s heartfelt praise, Song Yu had no choice but to admit he did enjoy Yue Zhishi watching him. Song Yu had become the basketball team\u2019s point guard when he\u2019d just entered high school; as soon as he entered the court, Song Yu usually focused only on gaining points, his ears completely blocking out the sound of everyone else \u2014 unless he knew Yue Zhishi was watching.The two of them at that time had no interactions at school. Yue Zhishi would sometimes look on from within the crowd, but he wouldn\u2019t be like other people yelling out Song Yu\u2019s name.He also wouldn\u2019t know that every time Song Yu shot in a ball, the first person he would look at after turning around \u2014 it would always be him.Even though a model answer was right in front of him, dunking a ball wasn\u2019t something that could be easily copied. Yue Zhishi tried many times, but he still couldn\u2019t do it. He was a bit depressed, and he knelt down, tying his shoelaces once again, and prepared to try again.Song Yu watched him try again and again and worried he would injury his Achilles tendon. \u201cDunking isn\u2019t something you can learn in a day or two. You can practice your jumping and explosiveness during summer break, it\u2019ll be easier after.\u201d\u201cThen will you stay with me as I do it?\u201d Yue Zhishi stood back up and very straightforwardly said, \u201cI want to play basketball together with you. I\u2019ve never played with you before.\u201dWhen he entered junior high, Song Yu was already an unprecedented star in the basketball team \u2014 but no one knew he was Song Yu\u2019s little brother, so he couldn\u2019t cling next to him. After everyone learned of their relationship, Song Yu had already entered his third year of high school and departed the basketball team.He stayed at Peiya for six years, and yet he was only able to stand on the same court and play basketball with Song Yu on his last day.Song Yu turned his face away as he saw the regret on Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. He gazed at the moon. \u201cWe can talk about it later.\u201dAnd then, he softly added, \u201cIf I have time, it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t.\u201dEvery time Song Yu spoke in double negatives, it was to cover up and obscure his awkward and troublesome true heart.Yue Zhishi was already very satisfied at receiving such an inconclusive promise from his gege. Since he was already handling the ball, he took the chance to try shooting three-pointers, and his accuracy wasn\u2019t too bad.\u201cAh.\u201dSong Yu glanced at him after hearing Yue Zhishi sigh. He asked, looking as if he wasn\u2019t really paying attention: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dYue Zhishi dribbled the ball to the bottom of the basket and lifted a hand to shoot the ball in; he immediately picked it up again, holding the ball against his hip with his arm. \u201cThe last day before graduating, Yue Zhishi\u2019s Peiya basketball dunking record remains at zero.\u201dLifting his head to gaze at the hoop, Yue Zhishi shrugged in self-defeat. \u201cForget about it, let\u2019s save this for\u2026\u201dHe was abruptly lifted into the air before he could finish speaking. His feet suddenly left the ground, and Yue Zhishi was startled enough that his voice shifted higher in fear. He almost didn\u2019t manage to hold on to the ball. \u201cGe, what are you doing!\u201dSong Yu murmured, don\u2019t move, and walked forward step by step, hugging his legs, until he finally stood still in front of the basketball hoop.\u201cShoot.\u201d His voice remained soft, as if the person doing something so unusual wasn\u2019t him.\u201cAh?\u201d Yue Zhishi looked at the hoop right in front of him. He was a bit confused, and when he looked down, he saw Song Yu curve his head at him as he continued holding onto him, as if he was questioning why he wasn\u2019t moving.So he took action \u2014 as he hung in midair, he dunked the ball in his hand into the basket in a position he\u2019d never once thought of being in.\u201cTwo points.\u201d Song Yu spoke like an impartial referee, but his actions were so biased and off-centre he was almost at the Antarctic Circle. He relaxed his hands and let go of the confused and dazed Yue Zhishi.But this was cheating.Dong\u2014\u2014Dong\u2014\u2014The basketball fell down, Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart still floating in the night sky.Song Yu stood in front of him and raised an eyebrow. \u201cStudent Yue Zhishi in Peiya\u2019s high school year 3, class 10.\u201dYue Zhishi lifted his head at being called. He saw a smile touch the corners of Song Yu\u2019s mouth.\u201cDunking record, plus one.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The light was too bright, and Yue Zhishi turned his face away in reflex, squinting.\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming.\u201d Song Yu swiftly reacted, grabbing Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrist and running towards the side door.As expected, a few people appeared right outside the wire mesh around the sports ground. The person in front ran towards the main entrance with his torchlight waving around like a searchlight. \u201cWhich class are you guys from? Why haven\u2019t you gone home! Why are you guys cuddling and hugging on the basketball court?!\u201d\u201cShit, I think it\u2019s Compass.\u201d Yue Zhishi was familiar with his voice and desperately ran ahead. \u201cHow are we so unlucky.\u201dSong Yu pushed open the side door and left, pulling along Yue Zhishi. The two of them didn\u2019t immediately know where to go after coming out of the basketball court. Yue Zhishi remembered that there was a side gate in the wall behind the new laboratory building, and it was connected to the neighbourhood where family members of the teaching staff lived \u2014 so he flipped his hand over and clutched Song Yu\u2019s hand instead, tugging him towards that direction.Compass chased very closely behind them, loudly yelling at them to stand still as he continued to ran. Yue Zhishi felt he himself was quickly running out of breath just by running; he didn\u2019t understand how Compass could have so many energy.\u201cThis way.\u201d The two of them circled around the right side of the new laboratory building. A row of cars was parked there, and two three metre-high square column sculptures were placed on the left and right side of the cars.\u201cLet\u2019s hide here for a bit first.\u201d Yue Zhishi dragged Song Yu behind a sculpture and leaned against it. The width of the sculpture wasn\u2019t quite enough. Yue Zhishi was worried they\u2019d be noticed, so he stood there, face close to Song Yu\u2019s chest, trying to hear the noises around them.The school director brought people with him, and they ran into the new laboratory building, thinking Yue Zhishi and Song Yu had gone inside. They went into the first floor, and just so happened to go into the classroom that was directly across from the square column.\u201cWhere are you guys going, not going home so late at night! I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re dating at school!\u201dThe director\u2019s voice was particularly clear in the empty classroom, as if it was amplified.The light from the torch abruptly shone out of the window. Yue Zhishi had originally peeked out half of his head as he continued hiding behind the sculpture, wanting to look; he immediately retreated back once he saw the light.The moment he retreated and pulled back his head, he accidentally met Song Yu\u2019s pair of dark eyes.He belatedly realised the distance between them was overly close \u2014 his and Song Yu\u2019s chests were pretty much pressed together, their colliding heartbeats intimately echoing each other. He was still panting from their earlier running, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple quivered, his eyes blinking twice in a fluster.\u201cI definitely have to catch those two. These children who all start early dating, they\u2019re all more courageous than the next\u2026\u201dEarly dating.It felt strange and misplaced to use this term on the two of them.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know where his guilty conscience came from. He only felt really hot \u2014 he was too hot from running, and he also felt really hot from pressing so closely together. He attempted to take half a step back, but Song Yu caught his arm. Song Yu slightly shook his head, looking much calmer than Yue Zhishi felt.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t dare move anymore. The light from the torch violently barged around in the dark night, just like his heart at this moment. He felt he was overly nervous, so he silently begged in his heart for the director to quickly leave.The begging seemed to be somewhat useful.The director left the classroom he was initially in and went searching in a different place; his torchlight also disappeared. Yue Zhishi only then relaxed, and his tense muscles loosened in relief, subconsciously leaning against Song Yu\u2019s body.\u201cThat scared me to death.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s head was lowered, the sound of his voice very soft \u2014 his forehead was propped on Song Yu\u2019s shoulder as he continued to lightly pant.This pose looked like a half-finished embrace.A few minutes later, the director seemed to give up. Many classrooms and labs in the laboratory building were locked, so even if students wanted to hide in them, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get inside. The director and the other people came out and walked around to the back.Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart had only relaxed for a short amount of time before starting up again. Luckily, Song Yu reacted very quickly and pulled him around to the side of the column to hide.The director was tired from running around. He roughly scanned around with his torchlight, and when he didn\u2019t see anyone in the vicinity, he cursed and decided to give up.Yue Zhishi only opened his mouth after a long time passed. He whispered, \u201cDid they leave?\u201dHe only relaxed after seeing Song Yu nod \u2014 his shoulders slumped in relief.\u201cAs expected, people shouldn\u2019t say things to jinx themselves.\u201d Yue Zhishi led Song Yu towards that side gate as he continued complaining. \u201cGood thing I\u2019m pretty familiar with this area. I noticed this gate here before.\u201dTheir footsteps landed in the thickly grown grass, the rustling noises mixing with the chirping of the cicadas \u2014 this was the sound of summer.\u201cWhy\u2019d you notice this for?\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t look back as he carelessly said, \u201cBecause I was always looking for a place to memorise my texts by myself. There are very little people around here. Many retired teachers live here in the area, and I once saw them bring their grandsons and granddaughters to play at school by coming through this side gate.\u201d He started to sound pretty pleased with himself as he continued speaking. \u201cI even told Jiang Yufan about this, and then he later always used this gate to sneak out of school.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve never snuck out before?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t sure if Song Yu was questioning whether he\u2019d actually snuck out before, or if he was questioning his familiarity with this side gate. He thought Song Yu was probably asking him more about the latter, so he stressed, \u201cIn any case, I pretty much memorised my texts every day, at least six days a week. I always see people going through this gate every time I came, so it\u2019s definitely a reliable way to get out.\u201dBut this later also became a jinx.Song Yu stood there, arms crossed against his chest, and remained calm and composed as Yue Zhishi stood in front of that little iron gate, wildly shaking the door lock almost the size of his fist. He repeated the key words from Yue Zhishi\u2019s speech earlier. \u201cI\u2019m pretty familiar with this area, I\u2019m here six days a week, definitely reliable.\u201dYue Zhishi awkwardly raised his face. \u201cMaybe today\u2019s the one day they lock the gate\u2026\u201dThey ended up climbing over the wall to escape.The back wall next to the teachers\u2019 apartments was a bit high, but at least it didn\u2019t have any sharp objects on top to prevent people from climbing over. Compared to Peiya\u2019s other school walls, this wall was already very friendly. Song Yu backed up and approached the wall at a slight run, borrowing the metal trashcan attached in the corner \u2014 he jumped off the trashcan with one foot and flipped over, his movements as smooth as running water. Seeing how proficient Song Yu was, Yue Zhishi suspected this wasn\u2019t the first time Song Yu had done something like this.\u201cHave you climbed over walls before?\u201dSong Yu had already gone down the other side and didn\u2019t respond to his question. Yue Zhishi adopted a safer way to going up \u2014 he stepped on top of the trashcan and finally climbed to the top using his long legs. He ended up sitting on the wall in weariness.His view of the world changed: the wall seemed to be even higher than he expected after sitting on it. He suddenly was a bit afraid of jumping directly down.\u201cWill my legs break from this height?\u201d he asked, very earnestly.Song Yu gazed at him, his face upturned towards him. A helpless look covered his face, and he seriously said they won\u2019t.\u201cThen will I sprain my foot? Will you still play basketball with me if I sprain my foot?\u201d\u201cYou ask too many questions.\u201d Song Yu walked until he was under Yue Zhishi, face clear of expression. He caught ahold of Yue Zhishi\u2019s dangling ankle, and then he lifted his head, opening his arms towards Yue Zhishi. \u201cJump down, you won\u2019t fall.\u201dEven though he didn\u2019t look enthusiastic at all and didn\u2019t look like he was going to properly catch him, complete trust and a bit of happiness filled Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart. Yue Zhishi thought of the summer holiday during his first year of elementary school \u2014 he\u2019d gone to learn swimming together with Song Yu, and he\u2019d clutched the metal handrail by the pool, utterly refusing to go into the water. It was useless no matter which instructor came by to coax him.At the end, it was still Song Yu. He swam over, his little face cold, and caught Yue Zhishi\u2019s small, trembling, plump legs, telling him to jump down.Yue Zhishi at that time had very seriously asked him, \u201cWill I drown?\u201dSong Yu had said he won\u2019t \u2014 had said, \u201cI\u2019ll catch you.\u201dSo he jumped down very obediently, just like this time. No matter if it was the young Yue Zhishi or the Yue Zhishi who\u2019d now grown up \u2014 he accurately, precisely landed into Song Yu\u2019s arms without a single injury.\u201cWe\u2019re finally out.\u201dHe\u2019d only just jumped down when an auntie came out of a nearby apartment building to throw away her trash. She stretched out her neck and looked at them as they stood there, arms wrapped around each other. Their eyes just happened to meet, and Yue Zhishi rapidly left Song Yu\u2019s arms.Two fake junior high school students wearing junior high uniforms who climbed over the school wall to the teachers\u2019 living community \u2014 it was very hard for them to not be noticed.\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go home.\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Yue Zhishi also took off his coat, tying it around his waist. He followed Song Yu.After leaving the neighbourhood\u2019s main area, a small, bustling street filled with food was right in front of the entrance. They\u2019d wasted two hours in school, and it was already almost midnight. Yue Zhishi was a bit hungry after playing basketball and running around. He tugged at Song Yu\u2019s arm and walked towards the food stalls.Song Yu understood what he wanted more than anyone else and didn\u2019t stop him.Yue Zhishi stood in front of a stall selling\u00a0soda buns. He watched as the owner lifted the lid of his wok and flipped over each panfried bun with a pair of tongs.\u201cCome have some soda buns. I have glutinous rice, turnip and vermicelli \u2014 which one would you like?\u201dSong Yu watched as Yue Zhishi continued to stand there. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can eat it, why stare at them?\u201dYue Zhishi was like an emotionless machine, repeating, \u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s not like I can eat it.\u201dSong Yu felt he looked a bit pitiful, so he said he wanted some mung bean soup. Yue Zhishi was very quickly distracted. \u201cI saw some over there just then.\u201d He wasn\u2019t able to eat the soda buns, but he bought two cups of iced mung bean soup \u2014 Yue Zhishi took a sip of the sweet paste, and his entire body relaxed. Small booths nearby sold all different kinds of late night snacks:\u00a0crispy three delicacy potstickers,\u00a0cold noodles tossed with sesame sauce and shredded seaweed, and even thin and\u00a0crunchy flour pancakes filled with salted preserved vegetables, fresh from a clay furnace. They all looked especially delicious.But Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t eat any of them.The auntie selling the cold noodles greeted Song Yu very cheerfully. \u201cWould you like some cold noodles, handsome boy?\u201dSong Yu stood there and asked if the noodles could be changed to rice noodles. The cold noodles food stall happened to also sell stir-fried rice noodles, so the auntie quickly exchanged the noodles over. As she mixed the noodles with the sauce and seaweed, she couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cThe point of cold noodles is to eat the egg noodles, why do you want rice noodles instead?\u201dWatching Yue Zhishi swallow his saliva next to him, Song Yu lightly said, \u201cI don\u2019t like egg noodles.\u201dThe two of them sat in front of a tiny folding table and shared the unusual bowl of mixed noodles and a portion of\u00a0fragrant and spicy roast tofu. The plastic stools were too short, so they could only stretch out their legs in front of them.Song Yu didn\u2019t really care about his previous tests, and he had never wanted to give Yue Zhishi too much pressure \u2014 but as they ate their late night snacks, he casually asked, \u201cHave you looked up any universities and majors?\u201dHe then added, \u201cActually, there\u2019s no rush.\u201dHe looked a bit guilty at his inconsistent words, but Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t notice as he rushed to stuff a piece of tofu into his mouth. He ended up wanting to spit it out from the heat.\u201cWhy do you always eat without sparing a single thought about what you\u2019re putting in your mouth,\u201d Song Yu ruthlessly said in ridicule.\u201cSo hot.\u201d Yue Zhishi swallowed with effort and answered Song Yu\u2019s first question. \u201cWuhan U, I\u2019m aiming for Wuhan U.\u201d He pretty much blurted it out, his words sounding very hasty, but after taking a sip of the mung bean soup, Yue Zhishi then said, \u201cAs for majors, I have a few options. I\u2019m going to really look into them for the next while.\u201dHe placed his cup back onto the table, movements full of self-confidence. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely choose a good major.\u201dSong Yu observed the expression on his face and lowered his eyes, his gaze softening. \u201cThen you must have already chosen a major.\u201d\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d Yue Zhishi felt he was completely transparent in front of Song Yu.Song Yu watched him, a faint smile on his face. \u201cWith your indecisiveness, you wouldn\u2019t have made plans already if you still haven\u2019t decided. You would\u2019ve been really anxious instead.\u201d\u201cOkay, you guessed right.\u201d Yue Zhishi finished off the remaining noodles. \u201cYou might laugh at me once I say it.\u201dSong Yu looked serious. \u201cThe possibility of me laughing should be smaller than everyone else.\u201dYue Zhishi laughed by himself once he heard Song Yu\u2019s words. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d He softly drummed his chopsticks against the table, and then he leaned in a bit, quietly saying to Song Yu, \u201cI want to study law.\u201dHis answer truly was out of Song Yu\u2019s expectations, but after thinking about it, he was able to guess why.\u201cMaybe this might sound very immature, but I really feel like being a lawyer is about defending justice.\u201d Yue Zhishi rushed to explain, as if he was very afraid Song Yu would think he was only saying this in the heat of the moment. \u201cEven though this \u2018justice\u2019 might not be justice in reality \u2014 and may be more procedural justice \u2014 but no matter what, I think being able to help others find justice is something very extraordinary.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s eyes glowed as he spoke, a kind of innocence shining through them \u2014 they made it very easy for others to think everything he said was simple and naive. But Song Yu knew \u2014 even though Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t really understand this profession, he was inherently born with this desire for justice. All of the heroic characters he used to like were like his spiritual totems, and they had long been etched into his character.Song Yu involuntarily thought about the one time he\u2019d asked Yue Yi why he wanted to be a reporter. At that time, he didn\u2019t understand the answer he was given; he only remembered Yue Yi saying: journalism was a profession that could expose injustice, he could speak for those who had no voice, he could pull into the light all the things that couldn\u2019t be seen in the darkness.Yue Yi at that time \u2014 he seemed to be like this too, eyes bright and glowing.They truly were father and son.\u201cDo you still think I\u2019m being really childish?\u201d Without waiting for Song Yu to reply, Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but open his mouth in question.Song Yu returned back to attention, and he looked at Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes. \u201cI think you\u2019re amazing. What you said is right.\u201dYue Zhishi was immediately happy and grabbed Song Yu\u2019s wrist. \u201cThen that means you support me, right?\u201dSong Yu shifted his eyes away. \u201cStudy well, these are all things to consider later.\u201dEven though Song Yu didn\u2019t exactly encourage him, Yue Zhishi was already satisfied by getting Song Yu to support his very immature thoughts. \u201cIf I successfully get in, I\u2019ll definitely study hard.\u201dSince they\u2019ve pretty much finished all their food, Song Yu paid and took him away.The temperature dropped a fair amount, and it was no longer so stickily hot. They walked on the empty road, shoulder against shoulder, and enjoyed the tranquility of the summer night. As he thought about how they\u2019d just escaped from school, Song Yu found it very amusing.\u201cI was there for six years of school, and I\u2019ve never been so flustered.\u201dYue Zhishi laughed out loud. \u201cThat\u2019s right, if you were caught dating a girl while you were in high school, the entire school would\u2019ve gossiped about you. The school would\u2019ve circulated a criticism notice.\u201dHow could anything of that sort happen. Song Yu lowered his eyes.As they walked, Yue Zhishi abruptly remembered something and frantically pulled up Song Yu\u2019s wrist, glancing at his watch.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s almost no more time.\u201d Yue Zhishi rapidly searched his body. A car darted past behind him, blowing high the hair on his forehead.Song Yu was curious about what he was looking for, but before he could ask, Yue Zhishi said, as if talking to himself, \u201cHigh school year 3, class 10\u2019s Yue Zhishi: record of being chased by the director, plus one. Record of successfully escaping, plus one. Record of climbing over walls, plus one. A qualitative leap from nothing at all.\u201d He raised his face and smiled like a child. \u201cThere\u2019s one last thing before I can perfectly end my high school years.\u201dWhen he finished speaking, he stretched out a hand to Song Yu.A metal name badge rested quietly in his palm, and it glittered under the street lamps.\u201cSong Yu gege, this is my name badge.\u201d Yue Zhishi picked up his hand and pushed the name badge into it \u2014 just like how Song Yu had stealthily stuffed it into his own hand that day school started. \u201cI\u2019m giving it to you.\u201dSong Yu looked at the name badge in his hand, an indescribable feeling suffusing his heart.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to leave it for someone else?\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head, and he said, clearly and directly, \u201cI\u2019ve never had any other option.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s mood became even more complicated at these words. Yue Zhishi was unbearably, unspeakably handsome under the dim yellow glow of the street lamps; even his eyelashes were a transparent golden colour. The memories and desire he thought he\u2019d buried very well \u2014 after seeing him smile, they all surged outwards like the rain flushing over the entire city\u2019s fireworks.His watch\u2019s second hand jumped at the same rate as his heart, passing by the number twelve. Everything returned to zero.The tender youth that would never return once gone \u2014 it was all condensed into a piece of metal engraved with a name, and was delivered to another person\u2019s hand.\u2013After having eaten so much late at night, Yue Zhishi knew early on that he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep. He guessed Song Yu would be the same, so he sneaked into his room without asking permission, coaxing and pestering Song Yu until he agreed to play games with him for a while. Yue Zhishi was honestly not all that good with this game, and he didn\u2019t even really like it all that much \u2014 when he used to play with other people, he would have little interest in searching through rooms, thinking it was boring. But with Song Yu, Yue Zhishi became particularly enthusiastic: he was extremely excited whenever he found anything useful and would ask if Song Yu wanted it, and even if he didn\u2019t want it, Yue Zhishi would still forcefully give it to him.Even when he foolishly danced in the game for Song Yu to watch, Yue Zhishi still found it very interesting.They played until very late, and Yue Zhishi only returned back to his room to sleep at 3am. Lin Rong rushed to Yanghe Qizhe in the morning and didn\u2019t wake them up to eat breakfast. Song Yu woke up rather early, and after cleaning up, he went downstairs to warm up a glass of milk for Yue Zhishi. He didn\u2019t expect to hear the door bell just as he reached downstairs, the sound ringing for a very long time.When he reached the entrance, Song Yu glanced at the security monitor screen. There was no one on the screen \u2014 maybe they\u2019d already left.Two seconds later, he still opened the door, walked outside and saw someone crouching just outside the door.The person seemed to think he was someone else, as he initially stood up very happily. But his expression changed once he saw Song Yu\u2019s face \u2014 he was very tall, his hair very short, and he wore an entire outfit of sportswear, a basketball in his hands.Song Yu recognised him very quickly. The person in front of him was Shen Mi, who\u2019d appeared in that interview video.\u201cGood morning.\u201d Shen Mi opened his mouth first, his voice friendly. \u201cThis should be Yue Zhishi\u2019s house, right? I\u2019m looking for him to play ball.\u201dHe looked at Song Yu and probed, \u201cYou are?\u201dThe author has something to say:Fight! Fight!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49:\u00a0 Open and Covert FightingThe expression on Song Yu\u2019s face didn\u2019t really change, and he also didn\u2019t reply to Shen Mi\u2019s question.\u201cIt\u2019s basic manners to introduce who you are when you\u2019re at someone else\u2019s door,\u201d he mildly said.The other person smiled when he heard this. He raked a hand through his hair and said, voice unconcerned, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I forgot to introduce myself. I\u2019m Yue Zhishi\u2019s classmate, in the same class. I\u2019m Shen Mi.\u201d He then glanced at the house number again. \u201cI haven\u2019t gone to the wrong place. I was here last time, and it was auntie who opened the door for me. You are?\u201dSong Yu appeared calm and composed, and the eyes looking at Shen Mi \u2014 they contained a naturally born aura that made it hard for others to get close to him.\u201cI\u2019m his older brother.\u201dShen Mi\u2019s face looked slightly surprised. \u201cHe has a brother? Ah, that\u2019s right \u2014 I think I\u2019ve heard other people mention this before, but Yue Zhishi has never said anything to me.\u201dSong Yu raised an eyebrow. \u201cHe has also never said he has a classmate called Shen Mi.\u201d\u201cNo way? I\u2019m already so close with auntie.\u201d Shen Mi pulled out his phone, grinning, and opened his photo gallery. He scrolled until he found a video he\u2019d recorded, clicked play and held it up to Song Yu.He\u2019d used an app to record Yue Zhishi while they were in class. In the video, Yue Zhishi was eating some snacks, and he kept using his hand to block the camera as he laughed, calling out Shen Mi\u2019s name and telling him to stop recording.\u201cSee, I sit behind Le Le.\u201dSong Yu watched the entire video, his face calm.Shen Mi put away his phone. \u201cBut that\u2019s fine, we can be considered as acquainted now. Bro, can you help me call him down? Since we have to go back to school to clean out our desks today, I wanted to go together with Le Le and play basketball afterwards.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s still sleeping.\u201d Song Yu lowered his head to glance at his watch, and then he lifted his eyes again. He leaned against the doorframe and methodically said, \u201cLet me remind you. Modern day science has resulted in something called a cellphone. You completely could have called Yue Zhishi a day ago and told him you wanted to go to school together with him at 9am on June 9th. This method is more likely to succeed than directly knocking on his house door. After all\u2026\u201dSong Yu chuckled. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know what he was doing last night or if he would be up late, would you?\u201dThe grin on Shen Mi\u2019s face faded a fair amount after he heard Song Yu speak, but it was only for two, three seconds before he nodded again, saying in a warm voice, \u201cTrue, that\u2019s on me for not thinking of everything. It\u2019s just that I live nearby, so I came over in the spur of the moment. You don\u2019t know this, but he\u2019s normally very hard-working. He\u2019s always the earliest to arrive in the morning, so I didn\u2019t expect him to stay up late and laze about in bed as soon as the entrance exams were over.\u201dThe smile on his face and the intimate way he phrased his words were all telling Song Yu: they were very good friends.No matter how you look at it, blocking your younger brother\u2019s friend outside was not a respectable way for an older brother to behave.\u201cUhm, bro, I just ran over and am a bit thirsty. Can I come in for some water?\u201d Shen Mi watched Song Yu. \u201cI can also wait for him in the meantime.\u201dAt the end, he entered, just like he wanted.\u201cWater\u2019s on the kitchen island. There are other drinks in the fridge, take what you want.\u201d Song Yu returned back to the kitchen counter after he finished speaking. He opened the packaged bottle of milk and poured it into a mug, putting it into the microwave to warm up.Shen Mi also entered the kitchen and poured himself a cup of cold boiled water. Sound drifted down from upstairs after he silently drank half of it.\u201cGege? Ge\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi shuffled around in his slippers. He saw Song Yu\u2019s open door with no one inside the room; he looked from upstairs into the living room, and it also didn\u2019t look like anyone was in there. Thinking he wasn\u2019t at home, he picked up Cotton Candy who was passing by and used a different way of calling as he played with Cotton Candy\u2019s paws. \u201cSong Yu?\u201dSong Yu carried the cup of milk and walked out of the kitchen. He tilted his head up and looked at Yue Zhishi once he got to the living room. \u201cWho are you calling?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s hair was messy and disordered from sleeping. He gave Song Yu a guilty, yet silly, smile and called him gege, plopping onto the handrail.\u201cGood morning.\u201dSomeone else appeared next to Song Yu, and Yue Zhishi froze in surprise. \u201cShen Mi? How come you\u2019re here?\u201d\u201cI want to go to school with you to clean out our desks. Did you forget the day before the exams we promised to play ball together after they were over?\u201d Shen Mi placed his two hands on his hips and looked up at Yue Zhishi, smiling. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still sleeping. Look at where the sun\u2019s at?\u201dYue Zhishi remembered. \u201cAh, yes. I played too late with my ge last night, I\u2019ve completely forgotten about picking up my books.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Shen Mi sighed. \u201cI ran over so early just to look for you. You can\u2019t be standing me up, right?\u201d\u201cNo, but I don\u2019t really want to play ball. Why don\u2019t we just go clean out our stuff first.\u201d Yue Zhisi looked again at Song Yu as he hugged Cotton Candy. \u201cBut Aunt Rong just called me and said we should go to Yanghe Qizhe for lunch.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t speak. Instead, Shen Mi replied in excitement, \u201cReally? That\u2019s so good, auntie\u2019s food is super yummy.\u201dYue Zhishi was a bit apologetic about changing his mind about playing basketball, so he compensated by bringing up a suggestion he thought was a very good idea. \u201cThen how about this, let\u2019s first clean out our desks and then go to Yanghe Qizhe for lunch together.\u201d He turned to look at Song Yu again, his face changing to an expression he always had whenever he wanted something. \u201cGege, can you drive me to school?\u201dSong Yu was silent for a second. \u201cAm I a tool?\u201dYue Zhishi immediately refuted, \u201cOf course not, I just want you to go with me.\u201dAt the end, Song Yu still agreed.Yue Zhishi changed his clothes very quickly and came downstairs, and he even ran over very naturally to drink the warm cup of milk Song Yu was holding. Even though he wasn\u2019t very happy about it, Song Yu still changed his clothes and went out with him when he thought about how inconvenient it\u2019d be for Yue Zhishi to lug his books into a taxi.Their journey to school now included one more person, and Song Yu in the driver\u2019s seat suddenly became a bit unnecessary. Yue Zhishi sat in the passenger seat, and all the things he talked about with Shen Mi, who was sitting in the back, was about their class 10 \u2014 like the gratitude dinner party for their teachers, or who stayed overnight in an internet cafe or who confessed to whom after the entrance exams.These were all blank areas Song Yu wasn\u2019t familiar with; this was the first time he experienced the absurd idea that he actually didn\u2019t understand Yue Zhishi as well as he thought he did.The road to school also coincidentally made people impatient. They once again hit another red light, and Shen Mi was already talking about their summer plans. He chattered about a comic convention coming up in a month, and the topic just so happened to be what Yue Zhishi was most interested in.\u201cAre you going too?\u201d Yue Zhishi twisted his entire body over. \u201cI want to go too!\u201dSong Yu threw him a glance. \u201cSit properly. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201dYue Zhishi sat back down and faced ahead very obediently after he was chided. He peeped at Song Yu, and then he stretched out a hand to touch Song Yu\u2019s arm. \u201cSuch a long red light.\u201dSong Yu felt this was one of Yue Zhishi\u2019s ways of pacifying him \u2014 Yue Zhishi seemed to be really skilled at accomodating his moods. He pretty much only needed to reach out a hand, and he was able to cleanly, precisely catch his moods. But Song Yu thought again \u2014 maybe Yue Zhishi himself didn\u2019t even know he was pacifying him.Maybe he was just used to his temper and knew exactly how to handle it.At the back, Shen Mi suggested going together and even said he had already prepared for it. \u201cYou can relax, you definitely won\u2019t get lost if you follow me.\u201dThe red light turned green, and Song Yu once again pressed on the accelerator. Yue Zhishi agreed to Shen Mi\u2019s invitation.Song Yu wasn\u2019t able to go in when they were clearing out their desks; he was only able to wait in the car. Yue Zhishi and Shen Mi went back and forth a few times, and Shen Mi helped Yue Zhishi carry things in a very friendly manner He busied himself with every little thing, as if he himself didn\u2019t have many books to clear out.\u201cNothing left?\u201d\u201cNope!\u201d Yue Zhishi placed the last bundle of books into the car trunk. \u201cI have everything.\u201dShen Mi stood behind Yue Zhishi. \u201cThank you, brother Song Yu. Or else we might\u2019ve needed to call a taxi.\u201dSong Yu closed the lid of the trunk, not speaking, and went directly to the driver\u2019s seat and drove to Yanghe Qizhe. The timing was just right \u2014 Lin Rong was ordering the waiters to get the dishes ready just as they arrived. She saw Yue Zhishi enter the courtyard through the ceiling to floor windows, and when she saw Shen Mi also closely following behind him, she came out enthusiastically to welcome them.Shen Mi knew exactly what to do. He went up to Lin Rong and said: \u201cAuntie, I\u2019m here to bother you again. Your food is just too delicious.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s all this nonsense about bothering me. If you like my food that much, then you can come here every day.\u201d Lin Rong smiled as she pulled him in, not giving her own son a single look.It was like Song Yu was an invisible person as he silently walked behind them. Only Yue Zhishi looked back, tugging at his arm, and said, \u201cA young school sister gave me some milk tea earlier.\u201dSong Yu asked in reply, with not much inflection in his voice, \u201cWas it nice?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t take it.\u201d Yue Zhishi entered the restaurant, their table near the window. \u201cI\u2019m not the kind of scum man who takes someone else\u2019s milk tea with a clear conscience even though I don\u2019t like them.\u201dSong Yu lightly laughed. \u201cYou better not be.\u201dYue Zhishi sat down and lifted his head to Song Yu, wrinkling his nose in uncertainty. It felt like there was a strange undertone to his words, as if he was angry at someone \u2014 and he even sat across from him.Seeing Song Yu not speaking, Yue Zhishi actively went to sit next to him. \u201cWhen does your summer holiday start? Let\u2019s go swimming together, a new indoor pool opened nearby. The water\u2019s really clean.\u201d\u201cIndoor pool?\u201d Shen Mi was helping Lin Rong bring out dishes. After he placed down a plate of\u00a0sweet and sour fish, he sat across from Yue Zhishi. \u201cAre you talking about the one near the subway? I just opened a membership.\u201dSong Yu hooked up the corners of his mouth and said to Yue Zhishi, \u201cWhat luck, there\u2019s someone to go with you to everything you want to do.\u201dYue Zhishi looked at him and frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re not going?\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t directly give him a response. Lin Rong came over, and Shen Mi shifted over slightly. \u201cAuntie, you\u2019ve worked hard!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, there\u2019s a few new dishes this time. I\u2019m planning on promoting these this season, so why don\u2019t you guys give them a try?\u201dAs they ate, Lin Rong questioned how Shen Mi\u2019s exams went. Shen Mi laughed as he gave a piece of fish picked free of bones to Yue Zhishi. \u201cThey went quite well, I should be able to get into the university I want to go to.\u201d\u201cNot bad.\u201d Lin Rong asked, smiling: \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d\u201cWuhan U.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s chopsticks paused the instant the words left Shen Mi\u2019s mouth.\u201cYou want to go to Wuhan U too? Me too.\u201d Yue Zhishi ate a piece of\u00a0cherry pork meat, and then he picked up an even larger piece to give to Song Yu. He quietly said to him, \u201cThis is really good, you should try it.\u201dShen Mi glanced at the fish Yue Zhishi had yet to touch. \u201cI know, you\u2019re always talking about Wuhan U this and Wuhan U that \u2014 my ear\u2019s about to fall off.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic, it\u2019ll be so good if you guys can get in together. You\u2019ll be able to take care of each other.\u201d Lin Rong was very happy and gave Shen Mi a bowl of dried shrimp and spare rib soup. \u201cOur Le Le\u2019s like a little child. I\u2019ve been worried about him being cheated or bullied by other people ever since he was a child. If you do end up going to Wuhan U, please take care of him.\u201dShen Mi smiled as he took the bowl of soup. \u201cThat goes without saying. Auntie, don\u2019t worry.\u201dYue Zhishi wasn\u2019t very satisfied by this conversation. \u201cI\u2019m not a child anymore. Besides, gege is at Wuhan U too, I\u2019ll look for him if anything happens.\u201dLin Rong purposefully teased, \u201cYour brother\u2019s busy enough to die, how does he have the time to worry about you.\u201d\u201cSo Song Yu bro is also at Wuhan U.\u201d Shen Mi\u2019s face looked a bit startled. \u201cWhat a coincidence. Then we\u2019ll be senior-junior brothers \u2014 that\u2019s fantastic.\u201dSong Yu flicked a look at him, too lazy to respond. He only silently said in his heart, it\u2019s not a coincidence at all, the person sitting in front of you is only going to Wuhan U because of me.Yue Zhishi was incredibly excited at being able to praise his gege. \u201cThat\u2019s right, my ge is super amazing. He\u2019s already doing experiments with postgraduate seniors.\u201d\u201cWow.\u201d Slight admiration appeared on Shen Mi\u2019s face. \u201cLe Le, you and your brother give off entirely different feelings. You really don\u2019t seem like brothers.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t like these words at all and lifted up his chin in dissatisfaction. \u201cHe\u2019s still my ge.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so cute,\u201d Shen Mi abruptly, very straight-forwardly said.Song Yu raised his head, his eyes squinting slightly. He focused on Shen Mi, who was smiling like a ray of sunshine.He suddenly realised there truly was a large disparity between people. When Xia Zhixu smiled, he too was like a ray of sunlight \u2014 but the smile on his face was always comfortable to look at and could very easily make people feel closer to him. But the person in front of him \u2014 the more he looked at him, the more Song Yu disliked him.Before today, Song Yu thought his instinctive dislike of Shen Mi came from his prejudice towards him. He\u2019d thought he should be less narrow-minded, but after meeting him today, Song Yu overthrew his own doubt towards himself.Shen Mi was completely different from any of Yue Zhishi\u2019s previous friends.Song Yu was very clear on this.\u201cRight?\u201d It was like Lin Rong identified herself in Shen Mi. \u201cDid you know, Le Le was even cuter when he was younger. I was always noticed when I went out with him. When I picked him up from kindergarten, everyone would always call me the mom of \u2018that western doll\u2019, and it gave me so much face.\u201dShen Mi widened his eyes. \u201cAre there photos? I really want to see him as a kid, did he look pretty much like one of those child models?\u201dYue Zhishi immediately rejected him. \u201cNo way, you can\u2019t see me as a kid.\u201dFor the majority of the time, Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t like it the other people called him cute. To him, the term \u2018cute\u2019 meant being childish, innocent and not mature enough.He had a target he really, really wanted to catch up to \u2014 and so he always tried his best to downplay the distance between them.Lin Rong ignored Yue Zhishi\u2019s rejection and said to Shen Mi: \u201cThe photos are at home. I\u2019ll take them out for you to look at the next time you come over to play. We used to have two large album, but for some reason\u2014\u201dAnd here, Lin Rong looked a bit puzzled, \u201c\u2014we only have one left at home. I can\u2019t find the other one no matter where I look.\u201dSong Yu choked as soon as Lin Rong spoke. He coughed, head lowered, and Yue Zhishi immediately gave him his own cup of water, patting his back and softly asking if he was okay.\u201cDid you choke on a fish bone?\u201d Shen Mi was very concerned. \u201cMy mom says drinking some vinegar can help. Do you want to try?\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head and very sincerely refused. \u201cThat\u2019s just a folk remedy.\u201dSong Yu took a sip of the water Yue Zhishi had given him and said in a low voice that he was fine.\u201cBy the way, there was a girl just now who wanted to give Le Le her name badge.\u201d Shen Mi chuckled. \u201cBut she was brutally rejected.\u201d\u201cName badge?\u201d Lin Rong doubtfully queried. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the thing you guys have to wear every day at school? What\u2019s the point in taking someone else\u2019s, it\u2019s not like you can wear it.\u201d\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know this auntie, but nowadays, giving your name badge away is the same thing as confessing.\u201dLin Rong\u2019s gossipy heart was lit aflame by this knowledge. \u201cReally~ Then Le Le, why didn\u2019t you take it?\u201dYue Zhishi opened his mouth and choked, and after hesitating for two seconds, he quietly said, \u201cI already have one from a long time ago. I don\u2019t need anyone else\u2019s.\u201d\u201cReally? Whose did you take? When? You didn\u2019t even tell me.\u201dFrom Lin Rong\u2019s reaction, Yue Zhishi felt like he was about to light himself on fire. He also didn\u2019t know why, but his words started to falter. \u201c\u2026Giving or taking a name badge doesn\u2019t have to mean that. Sometimes good friends can also give their badges away as a memento.\u201dHe was rarely like this \u2014 most of the time, he spoke openly, confidently and very frankly.Maybe it was because he didn\u2019t sleep enough last night and was feeling out of sorts, Yue Zhishi comforted himself.Lin Rong persistently refused to give up. \u201cSo whose did you take?\u201dWithout waiting for Yue Zhishi to open his mouth, Song Yu admitted very bluntly: \u201cMine.\u201dThe other three people around the table looked at Song Yu, but he continued looking indifferent, like this entire matter had nothing to do with him. He said, with a poker face, \u201cYue Zhishi asked me for it when I graduated high school. He wanted to steal some luck since I tested so well.\u201dLin Rong thought this was quite reasonable. \u201cI see, so it was like that.\u201dShe picked up the ladle, stirring the soup in its bowl, and joked, \u201cYour brother\u2019s name badge must\u2019ve definitely been hard to get. Who knows how many girls are still thinking about it.\u201dShen Mi was a bit dazed, but he smiled again very quickly. \u201cAre the two of you breaking off each other\u2019s peach blossoms?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have all that many peach blossoms.\u201d Yue Zhishi was eager to brush over this topic \u2014 he thought how he\u2019d just mentioned being given milk tea, and Song Yu didn\u2019t have a good reaction.He didn\u2019t want to put Song Yu in a bad mood.When he lowered his head, he realised Song Yu was wearing the same pair of shoes as he was. It was the same style, just in a different colour \u2014 it was such a tiny, trivial similarity, and yet Yue Zhishi became happy because of this.The reasons for his mood changes were always very simple.Lin Rong gave Yue Zhishi a bunch of water spinach. \u201cYou can slowly gather peach blossoms if you don\u2019t have any. You\u2019re about to start university. Don\u2019t be like your brother focusing only on your studies and living like an acetic monk. At your age, you should go out more and meet more friends.\u201d\u201cAuntie\u2019s right, I was thinking like that too.\u201d Shen Mi said, \u201cI want to find a place to work at over the summer holiday and earn some pocket money. I don\u2019t want to ask my parents for money anymore after going to university.\u201dShen Mi\u2019s image in front of Lin Rong was originally a friendly and sensible child. After hearing this, Lin Rong appreciated his way of thinking. \u201cNot bad. Then have you found a suitable job yet?\u201dShen Mi shook his head and sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy looking for work. Very few places want to hire someone who\u2019s just graduated high school.\u201dSeeing how worried he looked, Yue Zhishi thought of an idea. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try home tutoring?\u201d\u201cThere are too many home tutors now, and parents only want students from the big brand name universities.\u201dLin Rong thought for a while. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to Yanghe Qizhe. You know how to talk, and you have a good personality too \u2014 you can come and help me.\u201d She patted Shen Mi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAuntie will treat you well.\u201d\u201cReally? Auntie, you\u2019re too good of a person!\u201dSong Yu had nothing to say as he watched the lively scene across from him. He only turned his head over and said to Yue Zhishi, \u201cSince you already have a major to think about, relax at home over the holiday. Read some books, and polish yourself a bit.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Yue Zhishi said, as if he didn\u2019t need to think about it at all. He grasped Song Yu\u2019s wrist under the table, whispering, \u201cCan I go to Wuhan U to see you? People say Wuhan U\u2019s library is very good.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too far,\u201d Song Yu said.But he rapidly added, as if he was comforting him, \u201cI\u2019ll come back during the summer holiday.\u201dLin Rong also persuaded Yue Zhishi. \u201cListen to your brother and rest at home. Study after you\u2019ve refreshed yourself.\u201dShen Mi watched Song Yu and Yue Zhishi and said, after a long while, \u201cYou two have a great brotherly relationship. I\u2019m jealous, I really wanted an older brother when I was younger too.\u201dYue Zhishi was rather pleased with himself. He secretly thought, even if Shen Mi had an older brother, he\u2019d definitely wouldn\u2019t be as good and outstanding as Song Yu \u2014 he felt even luckier thinking about it.Lin Rong sighed emotionally: \u201cThat\u2019s right, Le Le has clung to his brother the most since he was a child. He refused to be even half a step away when he was younger and wanted to eat and sleep together.\u201dShen Mi looked at Song Yu and laughed again. \u201cThen what\u2019ll happen after they both get partners? They wouldn\u2019t be able to live together at that point anyway?\u201dThe two people across the table grew silent at those teasing words. Yue Zhishi fell into a bit of a daze, blinking a few times. The table abruptly shook \u2014 it was Song Yu\u2019s cellphone. Song Yu left the table with it and connected the call once he reached a ceiling to floor window not too far away. Yue Zhishi mutely gazed at his back, Shen Mi\u2019s question still circling in his brain.Song Yu returned after a little while. Lin Rong asked if he had something he needed to do.\u201cMn. A senior brother just called to tell me we need to have an unplanned group meeting this afternoon. He said I needed to report the data from earlier during the meeting.\u201dYue Zhishi was a bit disappointed. \u201cThen do you need to leave?\u201d He always felt a bit guilty whenever he requested something, so the sound of his querying voice turned softer. \u201cCan you ask for a day off?\u201dSong Yu nodded, drinking some water before placing the cup down. \u201cI have to go to the meeting. We need to talk about the progress of our recent work with the other people in the group. All the data is with me, so it\u2019s irresponsible if I ask for a day off so casually.\u201d He took his car key once he finished, as if he was already preparing to leave.Since it was already like this, Yue Zhishi had no other way to stop him. His brain considered the possibility of forcefully going with Song Yu later that afternoon, but since Song Yu needed to go into a meeting, there was no way he could sneak inside \u2014 he might even cause him some trouble.\u201cYour brother\u2019s truly amazing.\u201d Shen Mi once again sounded like he was in admiration. \u201cNot like me \u2014 I only know how to take you places to play without thinking about studying or working. If it were me, I definitely wouldn\u2019t go back for the meeting since I\u2019m already here.\u201dSong Yu was already weary of these little obvious, surface-level tricks.But Shen Mi clearly was not \u2014 he added, \u201cHe\u2019s clearly only older than us by three years. How come he\u2019s so mature.\u201dSong Yu stood up. He gave Shen Mi a kind smile.\u201cMaybe because I\u2019ve gone to university.\u201dThe author has something to say:Little brother Shen is simply an assist, he\u2019s not a villain hhh he\u2019s not a bad person at all, but gege is truly a Tea Connoisseur.ps: I\u2019ve successfully managed to write a new way of appreciating green tea?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They exchanged car keys, and Song Yu went out of Yanghe Qizhe. Not long after Song Yu left, Yue Zhishi chased after him.Song Yu had already started the car, but he still rolled down the window and looked at him when he saw Yue Zhishi come out.Yue Zhishi was panting a bit from his run. He leaned against the car window, called out gege and asked, \u201cAre you not happy about something?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s elbow was resting on the windowsill. He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d Yue Zhishi pursed his lips. \u201cI keep feeling like you and Shen Mi aren\u2019t getting along well, maybe I\u2019m just imagining things. But I don\u2019t like it when he speaks to you like that.\u201dSong Yu saw how worried he looked and slightly wanted to laugh. \u201cA friend\u2019s come over for lunch, and yet you left him inside to run out by yourself. You\u2019re even talking badly about him \u2014 is this really good?\u201dHe even said on purpose, \u201cShen Mi cares about you so much, he wants to go with you to everything you want to do. Unlike me, who still needs to go to a meeting even though I\u2019ve already come back.\u201dYue Zhishi felt like everything Song Yu said this morning was hard to deal with it, but he was amused by these words. \u201cYour words are so strange.\u201d He reached out a hand to adjust Song Yu\u2019s watch, ensuring it faced properly upwards on his wrist. \u201cDrive slowly, it should be fine if you\u2019re late for a bit. You haven\u2019t even started your postgraduate studies yet, but you\u2019re already so busy\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you want to leave with me?\u201d Song Yu abruptly opened his mouth.Yue Zhishi immediately froze \u2014 he even thought he heard wrongly and kept staring at Song Yu, the hand holding Song Yu\u2019s wrist loosening.\u201cJust joking.\u201d A slight smile hung on Song Yu\u2019s face. He stretched out a hand and squeezed Yue Zhishi\u2019s nape. \u201cGo back in and finish your food.\u201dHe still left by himself in the end, as if he sobered up in the space of a moment.And then Yue Zhishi also woke up. He returned back to Yanghe Qizhe by himself.Before he went inside, Yue Zhishi touched his own nape. He wasn\u2019t used to being touched there at all \u2014 in his memories, Song Yu had never done anything like that to him before. He was a bit not used to it, but he was also slightly pleased by the affectionate intimacy.He hoped Song Yu would stop joking like that \u2013- he really could take him away if he wanted. And yet he felt Song Yu was different from usual when he was joking: he felt even closer.His contradictory and bewildered feelings left Yue Zhishi immersed in his own world after he returned. He didn\u2019t really respond to Shen Mi\u2019s chatter and also forgot to tell him to not speak to his gege like that.After they finished eating, Lin Rong drove the two boys back. Shen Mi barely took the initiative to speak as they drove and was like a completely different person from when they first arrived. Yue Zhishi vaguely felt the atmosphere wasn\u2019t quite right, but he couldn\u2019t really tell why. He\u2019d never liked pondering over other people\u2019s moods, and he also felt Shen Mi kept changing back and forth. Shen Mi was usually fine, but he\u2019d changed into a different person after he met Song Yu and was different again now.All of this left Yue Zhishi confused, but he didn\u2019t want his friend and gege to not get along.Shen Mi\u2019s home was in the same neighbourhood as the Song family\u2019s and was very near. Lin Rong first dropped Shen Mi off at home, telling Yue Zhishi to help him take his books in.It was very quiet in the elevator. Yue Zhishi stared at the constantly changing number on the screen, and he suddenly heard Shen Mi speak.\u201cLe Le, what do you think of your relationship with your brother?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really good. He\u2019s the best person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Yue Zhishi said without even thinking about it. His arms were a bit sore, so he supported the books against the elevator panels. \u201cHaven\u2019t I told you this many times?\u201dShen Mi was quiet for two seconds. \u201cTrue.\u201dHe\u2019d said so many times, but without truly meeting him, he\u2019d still held a bit of wishful thinking.Yue Zhishi thought about their lunch, thinking maybe Shen Mi was a bit biased against his ge. He explained again, \u201cHe honestly is a really good person. He\u2019s so good you wouldn\u2019t be able to imagine it.\u201dShen Mi laughed out loud at hearing this. He glanced at Yue Zhishi as he continued carrying his books. \u201cDo you know you sometimes sound like a child when you talk? Like a child who lacks a sufficient amount of adjectives to describe something \u2014 you\u2019ve been using the word \u2018good\u2019 over and over again.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t know how else I could describe him.\u201d Yue Zhishi followed Shen Mi out the elevator, his words very honest.Shen Mi opened his door, pulling off his heavy schoolbag and placing the books in his hands into the entrance. He then took the pile of books in Yue Zhishi\u2019s arms. \u201cThanks.\u201dYue Zhishi suddenly remembered. \u201cAh, I think you\u2019ve left your basketball in the restaurant.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine, I\u2019m not really in the mood to play today.\u201d Shen Mi stretched his arms around. \u201cI\u2019m really tired. My back and waist are already sore just from moving these books.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded. \u201cOkay, since you\u2019ll be at Yanghe Qizhe anyway, you can leave the ball there. We\u2019ll play together next time.\u201d Talking about basketball, he thought of the scene of Song Yu and him sneakily playing at school, and a smile appeared on his face. He then acted like he usually did and happily shared this with Shen Mi. \u201cLet me tell you, my ge took me to play ball last night. I even did a dunk.\u201dBut he very quickly and honestly admitted: \u201cEven though the dunk was through cheating.\u201dShen Mi also smiled. \u201cNo wonder.\u201d\u201cNo wonder what?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked.Shen Mi shook his head. He abruptly thought of something as well, telling Yue Zhishi to wait there for a bit, and then went into the living room. He took out something from the drawer underneath the tea table and rushed back to the entrance. \u201cThis is a ticket for the comic convention.\u201d He gave it to Yue Zhishi. \u201cI\u2019ll remind you a day ahead this time.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve even bought tickets already.\u201d Yue Zhishi took it, cheerfully staring at the ticket. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back in a bit.\u201dShen Mi rubbed the back of his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to. It didn\u2019t cost much, and I only found a place to work because of you.\u201d He pressed his lips together. \u201cUhm, it felt like your brother didn\u2019t really welcome me when I went to look for you at home today. He didn\u2019t believe I was your friend either and seemed a bit unhappy. So I lied and said I didn\u2019t know he was your brother \u2014 I actually already knew who he was as soon as I saw him. He\u2019s exactly like how you described.\u201dHe just hadn\u2019t been willing to accept it.After frankly admitting it, Shen Mi looked again at Yue Zhishi. \u201cBut you \u2014 did you really not talk to him before about me?\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have lied to him.\u201d Yue Zhishi was very biased on what he focused on, but he was also very honest in replying to Shen Mi\u2019s question. \u201cI\u2019ve mentioned you before, just not that much.\u201d\u2018Not that much\u2019 pretty much meant he hadn\u2019t mentioned him at all. Shen Mi was very clear on this, so he nodded. \u201cAnyway, I didn\u2019t really watch what I said today. My mouth kept going and said a lot of useless things. Don\u2019t be angry. I won\u2019t look for trouble. Now that I think about it, it was impolite and a bit foolish of me to rush directly to your place. Besides, I really do think your brother\u2019s really amazing. I\u2019m quite jealous of him.\u201dHis words came very quickly, to the point Yue Zhishi thought he misspoke his last sentence \u2014 accidentally saying \u2018jealous of him\u2019 instead of \u2018jealous of you\u2019. But he chose to automatically filter out this little \u2018slip of the tongue\u2019.\u201cThat\u2019s fine, I truly do have a slight problem with people saying my ge\u2019s not good. I\u2019ve been like this since I was a child. His personality really is a bit \u2018strangers stay away\u2019, and he\u2019s always a bit cold interacting in the beginning with people he\u2019s not familiar with. But you\u2019ll understand later \u2014 he honestly is a really good person. So don\u2019t target my ge, okay?\u201d\u201cI can tell you truly have an older brother complex from your head to your toes.\u201d The smile on Shen Mi\u2019s face slightly faded. \u201cBut in this world, there are a lot of people other than him.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t really understand what he meant, frowning in uncertainty. He focused on Shen Mi\u2019s eyes, but he only received Shen Mi\u2019s urging him to go downstairs without any further explanation.Once he got back in the car, he saw Lin Rong with a super large bar of chocolate from somewhere. She struggled to break off a piece to put into her mouth, and when she saw Yue Zhishi, she also broke off a piece for him.\u201cI\u2019ll take you home. I need to go back to Yanghe Qizhe in a bit.\u201d\u201cI can also go and help,\u201d Yue Zhishi said.\u201cDon\u2019t, your brother just sent me a message saying you didn\u2019t sleep enough last night and told me to send you home to sleep.\u201d Lin Rong started up the car, her mouth still filled with chocolate and her words a bit muffled. \u201cShen Mi was also acting strangely today. This was his first time seeing Xiao Yu, right?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d\u201cXiao Yu just doesn\u2019t like to talk. You\u2019ll need to explain that to Shen Mi.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already told him. He understood.\u201dLin Rong passed the chocolate to Yue Zhishi, turning around the steering wheel completely to exit in a different direction. \u201cShen Mi \u2014 this child really does care about you a lot. I feel he really does take you as a very close friend. When he came in to help with the dishes, I asked him if he was preparing to relax over the next few days, and all of his plans were things you like doing.\u201d\u201cI know he treats me really well.\u201d Yue Zhishi searched up the price of the comic convention ticket, head lowered, and then transferred the sum to Shen Mi over WeChat. He was able to relax after doing so, and then he added, \u201cAll of my friends are especially nice.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 I feel like Shen Mi is sometimes too anxious and can\u2019t hide how possessive he is about his good friends. It\u2019s not really a bad thing if he treats you well, but it\u2019s a bit too obvious.\u201d She chuckled, \u201cOf course, he\u2019s still a child. He can\u2019t really control himself.\u201dShe also couldn\u2019t understand it \u2014 he was usually very normal, how did he suddenly change after meeting Song Yu? It was like he had been very anxious to show off how well he got along with Yue Zhishi.Yue Zhishi listened to Lin Rong\u2019s words, and after thinking for a while, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think Jiang Yufan would be like that.\u201d\u201cXiao Fan is just as open-hearted as you, always like a happy foolish child. Hey, I haven\u2019t seen him for a while. He wouldn\u2019t happen to be dating, would he?\u201d\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d Yue Zhishi looked at Lin Rong, completely looking like he thought she could foretell things like a prophet.Lin Rong clicked her tongue a few times. \u201cBoys your age are truly very easy to see through. Other than you and your brother \u2014 you two should be covered by peach blossoms, and yet you guys don\u2019t have a single person you like.\u201dYue Zhishi fed Lin Rong a piece of chocolate. \u201cBut I do. I like Aunt Rong.\u201dBeing forcefully fed a piece of chocolate, Lin Rong replied in an unclear voice: \u201cBoys your age just know how to sweet talk!\u201d\u201cHow could you mock my true heart?\u201d Yue Zhishi said in the exact way Lin Rong normally did, causing her to have nothing to say in reply.Once they arrived home, he sent a message to Song Yu, telling him in exact detail what Shen Mi had said earlier.But after waiting for a long time, he only received a reply that had nothing to do with his message.[Gege: I won\u2019t interfere in your friendships with others. It\u2019s fine as long as you think the other person treats you well.]\u2013Before the exams, Yue Zhishi had truly wanted to sleep in as long as he could and catch up on all the sleep he\u2019d been missing out on \u2014 but once he actually tried to do so, he realised it was actually very hard to do. A person\u2019s biological clock was etched into their body\u2019s memories, and he was unable to keep sleeping once his normal wake up time arrived. So later on, Yue Zhishi followed in Song Yu\u2019s footsteps, cycling to the library every day to read books.He was also aware that his interest towards law was actually very shallow. It was possible he might lose all interest once he read a civil law textbook, so he spent a lot of time reading. He would become quite excited once he read some exhilarating cases, and a day in the library went by very quickly.In the endless last ten-plus years, Yue Zhishi had always been like this. He followed the roads Song Yu had strode in, walking in Song Yu\u2019s footsteps to pass his own life.Shen Mi didn\u2019t actually invite Yue Zhishi to go out every day like he previously said he would. After meeting Song Yu once, he realised the relationship between the two of them was even closer than he\u2019d imagined and would be very hard to shake \u2014 he decided he might as well retreat for the sake of the future. He helped Lin Rong at Yanghe Qizhe every day, and when it was quiet, he would read in the restaurant.Sometimes Yue Zhishi would also go to the restaurant. They\u2019d eat together and then go home together since they lived so close; Shen Mi watched all the anime Yue Zhishi chased after, so they were always able to have something to talk about.Song Yu\u2019s summer holiday started later than expected, and he was called by Lin Rong to Yanghe Qizhe on his first day back.Lin Rong had received an engagement banquet booking over this period of time. It was one of her best friends\u2019 children, so she spent a lot of time and effort designing the menu and the venue decorations. Fresh blooms of Chinese wisterias, lilies of the valley and white roses had been delivered over, and they covered Yanghe Qizhe until the place almost looked like it belonged to the celestial heavens.When Song Yu arrived, Yanghe Qizhe\u2019s workers were organising the seating. He immediately saw Shen Mi, who was wearing the same uniform as him, and he was helping a female worker move chairs, carrying four all by himself. Separated by a few metres, Shen Mi also saw him and gave him a smile, calling out brother Song Yu.Even though he didn\u2019t have the best impression of him, Song Yu still nodded before he went around them, heading directly into the restaurant. As soon as he went in, he saw Yue Zhishi standing on a long table, holding a long strand of Chinese wisteria flowers. He was trying very hard to hang the flowers on the ceiling, but the drooping flowers kept falling onto his face and veiling his vision.Just as Yue Zhishi was struggling, Song Yu stepped onto the table and took a hold of the flowers in front of his face, gathering them all together into his hand.His vision was suddenly cleared, Song Yu\u2019s face appearing behind the Chinese wisteria blooms, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes immediately brightened. \u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Song Yu used his other hand to hang the strand of flowers onto the hook and then straightened them out. \u201cWe can hang the last bunch now.\u201dYue Zhishi took a step backwards, but he\u2019d spent too much time trying to hang these flowers and had forgotten he was pretty much standing on the edge of the table. He lost his balance after taking this one step, unable to stop himself from falling backwards \u2014 luckily, Song Yu\u2019s sharp eyes and agile hands caught and pulled him directly into his arms.\u201cThat was really scary.\u201d Yue Zhishi rested in Song Yu\u2019s arms, cold sweat covering his body. He lifted his head and saw Shen Mi come in with some extra chairs, and after seeing this scene, Shen Mi\u2019s face turned a bit strange.\u201cBe careful.\u201d Song Yu saw Shen Mi as well once he turned his head, and he dropped the hand clasped around Yue Zhishi\u2019s waist. \u201cGet down, I\u2019ll hang up the rest.\u201dBut Yue Zhishi was unwilling to leave. He circled around the table, as if he was afraid Song Yu would also commit the same rookie mistake as he did.Shen Mi detoured around them, mutely taking away the baskets of flowers leaning against the wall. He placed them all according to Lin Rong\u2019s instructions, and then finally called Yue Zhishi over, telling him to stand in the restaurant and let him know if he displayed the banners correctly.After finishing with the flowers, Song Yu stood next to the table, his eyes focused on the two people separated from him by a glass window. Yue Zhishi was telling Shen Mi to either shift left or shift right, the two of them gesturing to each other, and Shen Mi ended up doing something that made Yue Zhishi collapse onto the window in laughter.They busied themselves until 9pm before the entire venue was fully decorated. Lin Rong needed to drive three female workers home, so Song Yu ended up driving the two boys.Yue Zhishi and Shen Mi fervently talked about the upcoming comic convention and exhibitions. \u201cI need to bring my DLSR, there should be many people cosplaying the characters I like in three days.\u201dShen Mi was leaning against the car door as he sat, able to completely see the side of Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. \u201cYou can cosplay too, you\u2019re better looking than all of them. Your facial features all stand out, and you wouldn\u2019t even need to wear a wig if you cosplay certain characters.\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head. \u201cNo, I like watching other people. I don\u2019t like being watched.\u201dRed light \u2014 Song Yu stopped the car, casually saying, \u201cPeople will look at you even if you\u2019re just standing there.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Shen Mi very naturally expressed his agreement. This time, it was like he learned his lesson, and he occasionally tried interacting with Song Yu as he talked with Yue Zhishi, asking things like how were Wuhan U\u2019s cafeterias or how many people stayed in a dorm together.Even though he didn\u2019t really like him, for Yue Zhishi, Song Yu still answered every one of his questions. The atmosphere around the three of them in the car was still a bit awkward, but it was better than the first time. Song Yu was very clear about Shen Mi\u2019s heart, but he also felt Shen Mi was a child and didn\u2019t want to expose him. He may not want someone plotting for Yue Zhishi existing around Yue Zhishi, but Song Yu didn\u2019t have any right to interfere in someone else\u2019s actions.Or interfere in what Yue Zhishi wanted.The cramped and narrow space of the car made it very suitable to observe others. Shen Mi\u2019s line of sight always rested on Yue Zhishi, unlike when they were in school together. Yue Zhishi continued to constantly mention his gege using an adoring tone of voice, but he was only able to discover more things after he was given the chance to observe him directly.Yue Zhishi liked to grab Song Yu\u2019s hand whenever he started to have fun chatting \u2014 even if that hand was on the steering wheel, he would still subconsciously reach out to touch it. It was like it had already become a habit, and Song Yu very much indulged it, not saying a single word.All of this was caught in Shen Mi\u2019s eyes. He wanted to say to Yue Zhishi, wouldn\u2019t you disturb your brother driving? but after calming down, he decided to give up on it.After last time, Shen Mi knew he couldn\u2019t act like that.Yue Zhishi rolled down the window, saying he\u2019ll see him tomorrow, after they reached Shen Mi\u2019s building. Shen Mi smiled as well, and he thanked Song Yu right before he left.Yue Zhishi once again sneaked into Song Yu\u2019s room once they got home. He was already very familiar with what he needed to do to get in \u2014 he only needed an excuse of either bringing in fruit or milk to get in the door, and then he\u2019d laze around for a bit while Song Yu wasn\u2019t paying attention. He\u2019d stay until Song Yu realised he was still there and kicked him out.He felt like Song Yu\u2019s reflexes were actually very slow. He could be like Cotton Candy and nest in his room, undiscovered.Song Yu lay on his bean bag, his hand holding a book. Yue Zhishi came in holding a bowl of grapes and then sat down next to him, bending over very naturally without a single thought. \u201cGege, let\u2019s play some games.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t Shen Mi also really good at it?\u201d Song Yu flipped a page, voice lightly drifting over.Yue Zhishi frowned. \u201cBut I want to be team up with you.\u201d\u201cHe should be waiting online for you right now.\u201dHe really wasn\u2019t able to understand Song Yu\u2019s attitude. Song Yu had never once cared so much about one of his classmates before \u2014 he\u2019d even called Jiang Yufan as Jiang Yifan for a time. But every time he bumped into Shen Mi, Song Yu would say things he would normally never say, would act in baffling and inexplicable ways.Yue Zhishi put down his phone, staring at Song Yu. \u201cWhy do you keep bringing up Shen Mi?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s appearance looked utterly peaceful and calm, full of patience and tolerance. \u201cNo reason. I just think he\u2019s not bad.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s phone screen lit up. He unlocked it again and returned back to the homepage of that game.Song Yu said he had nothing else to say, but he opened his mouth again after only a short amount of time, his voice extremely casual. \u201cCan Shen Mi dunk?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Yue Zhishi changed the clothes on his in-game character to the blue colour Song Yu liked; he\u2019d specifically bought the outfit. \u201cHe\u2019s our class\u2019s small forward.\u201dSong Yu said, \u201cMn,\u201d and then flipped another page of the book he hadn\u2019t been able to read at all. He flatly listed out a bunch of Shen Mi\u2019s good points. \u201cHe can play basketball and can play games. He\u2019s very open and cheerful and knows how to speak. He\u2019s tall as well.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not short either.\u201d Yue Zhsihi immediately placed his legs on top of Song Yu\u2019s legs once he heard his words. \u201cI\u2019m 180cm already, look at how long my legs are.\u201d\u201cMinus one centimetre, right.\u201d Song Yu glanced at home, purposefully pretending to remove Yue Zhishi\u2019s leg in disdain. \u201cI\u2019ve seen your college entrance physical examination report.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already been over a month, I should have grown one centimetre by now.\u201d Yue Zhishi was a bit dissatisfied. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m open and cheerful too. I might not be able to play basketball or games as well as he can, but I\u2026\u201dSong Yu turned his face over, looking at Yue Zhishi. \u201cYou what?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m good-looking.\u201d Yue Zhishi felt embarrassed after he said it and lowered his head to stuff a grape in his mouth \u2014 but he ended up wrinkling his entire face by the sourness. \u201cThese grapes are terrible, we can\u2019t eat them.\u201dSong Yu stiffened the corners of his mouth, keeping the calm and distant look on his face, and met Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes. \u201cThen do you think Shen Mi\u2019s good-looking?\u201dThe tart and biting taste of the grapes still remained in his mouth, and that immature flavour continued to affect Yue Zhishi\u2019s brain. He stared at Song Yu without moving, as if he wanted to read something from his face.The room was very quiet. Song Yu\u2019s phone suddenly rang, someone unknown calling. He lowered his head, giving it a glance \u2014 a pale and slender hand appeared in his field of vision, grabbing away Song Yu\u2019s phone and muting it.Song Yu raised his head, wanting to say something, but Yue Zhishi was one step ahead. His carefully planned and deliberately enigmatic and sarcastic words seemed to have entered Yue Zhishi\u2019s ears and turned into something completely different, going in a direction Song Yu had not expected.\u201cI think he\u2019s not as good-looking as I am.\u201d If these words had come out of someone else\u2019s mouth, they may have been overly confident \u2014 but Yue Zhishi had always been this candid. This time, Yue Zhishi \u2014 who was usually hard to anger \u2014 sounded a bit irritated and held onto Song Yu\u2019s phone without intending to return it.\u201cIf you don\u2019t agree with me, then I have reason to doubt your sense of beauty.\u201dThe author has something to say:System prompt: Player Song Yu has launched his [Enigmatic, Sarcastic] attack, accidentally triggering the [Sweet and Sour Cheese] cutscene.Shen Mi: I\u2019m Truly just a toolMom doesn\u2019t understand. Read carefully, mom also doesn\u2019t understand why Shen Mi is like someone else entirely when faced with gege. She only thinks Shen Mi treats Le Le well, and that he has a friend\u2019s sense of possessiveness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He initially managed to keep a straight face, but he suddenly started to chuckle.\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d Yue Zhishi caught and shook Song Yu\u2019s shoulder twice, but Song Yu started laughing even harder. His amusement was different from usual \u2014 rather than just the corners of his mouth curling, his eyes curved too, and his entire person became livelier, more vibrant. The more Yue Zhishi told him not to laugh, the harder it was for Song Yu to hold back, and he eventually fell to the side.\u201cHonestly, what are you laughing about? What\u2019s so funny?\u201dBut not only did Yue Zhishi not manage to get an answer, it was like he was infected as well, and he also inexplicably started to laugh, collapsing onto Song Yu\u2019s body. After they slightly calmed down, he again ordered Song Yu to not laugh; he also remembered his earlier question. \u201cYou\u2019re so unserious. You can\u2019t actually think he\u2019s better looking than I am, right?\u201dThe amusement on Song Yu\u2019s face had still yet to fully fade away. \u201cI think your brain\u2019s different from normal people\u2019s brains.\u201d\u201cHow come you\u2019re doing personal attacks again?\u201d Yue Zhishi pulled at Song Yu\u2019s clothes and used his phone like a small gavel to pound Song Yu\u2019s leg. \u201cSilence. Do you have any objections to my opinion?\u201d\u201cNo objections. Is that okay, little judge?\u201dSong Yu gave him a look, his face appearing warmer and gentler after laughing.Yue Zhishi somehow said okay, and then afterwards, thought he had been a bit silly.He abruptly realised it had been a very long time since Song Yu had laughed like that. He searched through his memories, and it was very hard for Yue Zhishi to find a similar scene. In front of him, gege forever seemed to be a\u00a0precision machine\u00a0with a fixed program, carrying out orders unlikely to be wrong and forever doing the correct things.Suddenly, Yue Zhishi sat straight and gazed at Song Yu\u2019s pair of dark eyes.\u201cGege, you look the best when you\u2019re laughing.\u201dSong Yu froze, but he didn\u2019t stay still for too long before he moved his eyes away. He even took away his phone in Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand, the laughter on his face already completely disappeared. He once again returned to the quiet, taciturn Song Yu.The screen of his phone lit up, showing Qin Yan\u2019s missed call.\u201cI\u2019m going to make a phone call.\u201dAfter Song Yu got up and left, Yue Zhishi shifted and moved to rest against the bean bag Song Yu had just been on \u2014 gege\u2019s warmth still lingered on it. He replayed the last few minutes in his mind and felt he must\u2019ve been thinking too much, causing Song Yu to laugh at him.But he also hoped Song Yu could laugh more, just like then \u2014 it was fine even if he was making fun of him.Time disappeared in a flash. Yue Zhishi was very happy when he received his letter of admission, and he was even happier to learn a few of his friends also got into the same university as him. Jiang Yufan\u2019s exam score may have been a bit low, but he had applied for an unpopular major and successfully entered Wuhan U to become Yue Zhishi\u2019s schoolmate.What surprised Yue Zhishi the most was that on the day he went to Wuhan U for his first day, he found out Jiang Yufan had become his dorm mate.\u201cMy major just so happened to have me as an extra person, so I need to live with other majors.\u201d Jiang Yufan was so happy he was beaming with joy. \u201cAt first I was a bit annoyed since this place is so far from my faculty building, but I didn\u2019t expect to live with you \u2014 the heavens must\u2019ve been touched by our strong friendship!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Yue Zhishi was also very happy and pulled him out to eat some KFC together even though he pretty much couldn\u2019t eat any of it. He was only able to eat some ice cream.His one and only regret was that this initial start of the term just so happened to coincide with Song Yu needing to do some fieldwork in the mountains. Song Yu wasn\u2019t able to take Yue Zhishi to the university, and he was also unable to teach Yue Zhishi each and every road in Wuhan U like how Yue Zhishi had previously requested.\u201cI hear Shen Mi also got into the law faculty?\u201d Jiang Yufan took a sip of peach oolong tea. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty awesome. He was able to transfer directly into your class 10 despite it being difficult to transfer classes in Peiya, and now he\u2019s also in the same faculty as you.\u201d\u201cBut we\u2019re not in the same major.\u201d The sundae was overly sweet, and Yue Zhishi also took a sip of his drink to cleanse his mouth. \u201cHe helped move a lot of my luggage when we first started school, and that\u2019s when I found out he actually lived in the next building.\u201dJiang Yufan couldn\u2019t help but emotionally sigh. \u201cWhat a loyal friend. Auntie must definitely have stuffed a bunch of stuff into your luggage. Is there anything delicious? Give me some.\u201d\u201cYeah, there is. Aunt Rong\u2019s already packaged everything for me \u2014 there\u2019s your portion, Shen Mi\u2019s and my other dorm mates\u2019 portions. But she doesn\u2019t know you already own one of my dorm mate portions, so I have an extra pack. I\u2019m planning on giving it to Qin Yan gege.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s right, senior Qin Yan is also here as a gifted student.\u201d Having eaten his fill, Jiang Yufan leaned back against the chair and stretched. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to have everyone together in the end.\u201dMilitary training started the third day after reporting to school. This city\u2019s summer was always extremely hot \u2014 people standing underneath the sun were pretty much walking pieces of butter, feeling as if they could completely melt at any point in time. This kind of heat was different from merely sitting in the sun: the Yangtze River ran through this city, and the many lakes made for a humid climate. The city was like a natural food steamer once summer arrived \u2014 it was like stepping into a sauna as soon as people went out, let alone all the new students who needed to wear their military training uniforms.Every day Yue Zhishi went back to his dorm, he felt like he\u2019d lost a layer of skin. He was pretty much able to immediately fall asleep as soon as he cleaned up and got into bed, but he always tried his hardest to resist falling asleep. He sent messages to the far away Song Yu, sharing his new student life with him.The mountains didn\u2019t have good reception, so it was very rare for Song Yu to be able to see his messages as soon as they were sent. There was always a lag in their communication \u2014 Yue Zhishi would silently send out his messages, and after a bit of buffer time, he\u2019d receive a few responses.It was like there was no way to get rid of these difficult to avoid delays.Because of Yue Zhishi\u2019s distinctive features, he was always noticed by either his female fellow schoolmates or their drillmasters during their military training. The drillmasters always liked to joke with the students with especially strict facial expressions or voices, and Yue Zhishi would frequently be pulled out as an example.\u201cYou\u2019re too pale, you\u2019ll look more like a man once you get a tan.\u201dThat was something a drillmaster said, and Yue Zhishi thought he was being serious \u2014 so on the second day of military training, he didn\u2019t follow Aunt Rong\u2019s instructions to put on sunscreen. He didn\u2019t expect to lose a layer of skin on his nose after just one day.Once he returned back to his dorm, Yue Zhishi took a video and showed Song Yu his peeling nose. \u201cGege, look, don\u2019t I look like an onion.\u201dIt was already noon the next day when he received Song Yu\u2019s reply. He was on his way to pick up a delivery after eating lunch, and he hurriedly replied to Song Yu\u2019s message. Song Yu had seemed a bit angry at him not having put on sunscreen.Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t had much of an appetite when he was eating lunch earlier, so he hadn\u2019t eaten much. The weather was honestly too hot, and his eyes started to blur as he gazed at his screen. He started to feel dizzy, and he\u2019d only just sent out two short messages when he could no longer steadily stand. It was hard for him to breathe, and he felt nauseous.His body had always been weak. Yue Zhishi was very sensitive to any uncomfortable reactions in his body, so he wanted to look for a place where he could sit. He\u2019d only taken two steps when his vision went black.He heard a very warm and gentle voice, a pair of hands holding his arms. \u201cFellow student, are you okay?\u201dHis vision recovered slightly. A beautiful, tall and slim girl with black wavy hair stood in front of him, wearing a baby blue dress. She looked worried. \u201cAre you suffering from a heat exhaustion? There\u2019s so much sweat on your forehead, let me help you find a place to rest.\u201dYue Zhishi said thank you very softly. She was visibly much more familiar with this area and brought him directly away from the little garden to a convenience store with air-conditioning. Yue Zhishi felt much more comfortable after he went inside.\u201cSit here for a bit.\u201d She escorted Yue Zhishi to the bar counter. \u201cI\u2019ll be back very soon.\u201dWorried his asthma would act up, Yue Zhishi looked for his inhaler in his bag and pulled it out in case he needed to use it. He then held his phone and finished sending his messages to Song Yu.That girl came back very quickly, her hand carrying a small bag, and went to the entrance of the convenience store to buy a bottle of water. She walked to Yue Zhishi, giving the bottle to him after opening it. \u201cDrink some water first.\u201dThe plastic bag rustled as she opened it. \u201cI bought some\u00a0Huoxiang Zhengqi liquid\u00a0and cooling patches for you.\u201d She pulled open a patch and very naturally tugged off the cap on Yue Zhishi\u2019s head to stick it onto his forehead.\u201cI can do it myself.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s already on.\u201d The girl also opened a bottle of the Huoxiang Zhengqi liquid. \u201cStudents suffer from heat exhaustion every year. This isn\u2019t something minor \u2014 you\u2019ll still feel dizzy if you suffer from minor heat exhaustion, but a serious case can give you stomach flu. You\u2019ll need to be sent to the hospital if you end up developing heat stroke.\u201dYue Zhishi could tell: \u201cAre you a senior sister?\u201dShe chuckled very gently. \u201cIs it that easy to tell I\u2019m older than you?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Yue Zhishi immediately explained, \u201cI just feel like you\u2019re really familiar with this place, and it also doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s your first time seeing someone suffering from heat exhaustion.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m in third year. I used to be the manager of my faculty\u2019s basketball team, and many team members would often get symptoms during training.\u201d She introduced herself graciously. \u201cI\u2019m Nan Jia, in the law faculty. What about you?\u201dYue Zhishi was a bit astonished \u2014 who would have expected something so coincidental. \u201cMe too.\u201d\u201cThen we\u2019re faculty senior sister and junior brother? How lucky.\u201d Nan Jia also found it very miraculous. \u201cIn that case, we might end up seeing each often in the future. You can look for me if you need help with anything, no need to be shy.\u201dNan Jia suggested for him to get up and walk around after he sat there for a while and brought out a little electric fan for him from the bag. \u201cUse this, and don\u2019t wear your cap for a bit.\u201d Hearing that Yue Zhishi needed to pick up a delivery, Nan Jia brought him along a shorter way, and the two of them went back to the law faculty building on their way. Yue Zhishi kept expressing his gratitude as they walked, but Nan Jia said he didn\u2019t need to worry about it.\u201cI have a little brother too, and he\u2019s about the same age as you. He\u2019s studying in a different province, and I think of him whenever I look at you.\u201d Nan Jia smiled again after she finished speaking. \u201cOf course, he\u2019s not as handsome as you.\u201dAt the dormitory building, they bumped into Jiang Yufan who\u2019d come downstairs to buy some drinks, and he was particularly agitated at seeing Nan Jia. He ran over, grabbing Yue Zhishi, as soon as she left. \u201cHey, how did you end up walking with the law faculty flower!\u201d\u201cFaculty flower?\u201d Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t understand. \u201cYou mean senior Nan Jia?\u201d\u201cYeah, you didn\u2019t know? She was in charge of the volunteers when all of us new students came to report, and she even gave me directions at that time.\u201d Jiang Yufan\u2019s face was full of excitement. \u201cThe second year senior brother who picked me up said she was the law faculty flower, beautiful and kind, with many people chasing her.\u201dYue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but ridicule him. \u201cDon\u2019t forget you\u2019re someone who has a girlfriend.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. I just instinctively appreciate beauty, and obviously the person I like the most is my Xiao Ya.\u201d Jiang Yufan looked Yue Zhishi up and down, and seeing the cooling patch on his forehead, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Are you sick? You can\u2019t be allergic to something, are you!\u201dYue Zhishi was afraid he\u2019d make a big fuss, so he explained as they went upstairs together, conveniently also telling him about how he met Nan Jia.\u201cAs expected, it must be nice to be a handsome guy. You even meet faculty flowers randomly.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019ll meet nice people too if you end up suffering from heat exhaustion.\u201dJiang Yufan helped Yue Zhishi ask for leave from the afternoon military training session. Since Yue Zhishi had a special body constitution and had a history of asthma, the drillmaster didn\u2019t dare be careless \u2014 he allowed Yue Zhishi to rest in his dorm for the afternoon.And even though his dorm mates urged him to not continue attending the military training, Yue Zhishi still stubbornly returned the next day. To a certain extent, he was very stubborn and committed seriously to anything he did.There were less than four days to their military training performance, and he was chosen to be a flag bearer by the battalion commander. He didn\u2019t dare relax at all.There weren\u2019t many flag bearers \u2014 they were all students with honest features and well proportioned figures chosen by their various faculties, and they were in charge of escorting the country flag at the beginning of the performance. To Yue Zhishi, this was something very glorious; the thing he regretted the most during high school was not being able to be in charge of raising the flag. He hadn\u2019t done well when the school had selected the flag raisers, and his raised flag had swished downwards, covering up his entire person.And so he had lost such a glorious opportunity.In order to not make a single mistake this time, he constantly stayed back after they were dismissed to do some solo training. He\u00a0goose-stepped\u00a0around the sports ground as many people watched on, but Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t care about other people\u2019s gazes.The day of the military training performance, Qin Yan also appeared on the dais in his role as the president of the literature and arts student society. Yue Zhishi initially didn\u2019t notice him until he passed the dais carrying his class banner. He heard a familiar voice, and only then did he realise Qin Yan was the broadcaster \u2014 but he was locked in his goose-steps and had no way of turning back to see.After they were dismissed, every faculty\u2019s flag bearer was given fresh flowers from girls except for Yue Zhishi. The law faculty didn\u2019t have any precedent of arranging for flower delivery.But Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t disappointed at this, because he felt like holding a bouquet of flowers was something a bit awkward.Once the performance was over, the drillmasters took all of them and left the stadium. Yue Zhishi\u2019s phone rang with a call from Qin Yan.\u201cLe Le? Wait for me at the stadium entrance.\u201dTen minutes passed, and Qin Yan finally arrived after two girls came together and left after hitting on Yue Zhishi. Qin Yan was holding a bunch of sunflowers, and Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t understand what they were for.\u201cTake them.\u201dYue Zhishi found it very strange \u2014 he\u2019d never been given flowers by a guy before. \u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d\u201cJust look at how unwilling your face is.\u201d Qin Yan couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter. He told him the truth. \u201cThese are from your brother. He told me to give them to you during your performance since he\u2019s still in the mountains.\u201d\u201cMy ge bought these?\u201d Yue Zhishi immediately took the flowers from Qin Yan\u2019s hands. The black paper packaging held eleven sunflowers just in bloom, the flowers the size of his palms. Every single one of them was carefully chosen, pulsating with life, and a black card was stuck right in the middle of the bouquet. It held a typed message with no signature.[Congratulations on successfully completing your military performance, little flag bearer.]It didn\u2019t feel like Song Yu\u2019s style to send flowers, but sending a message did. He flipped over the card. An introduction to the flowers was typed on it, and the name of this particular breed was very special \u2014 they were called\u00a0earthwalkers.\u201cI don\u2019t know why he chose these flowers, what\u2019s wrong with roses? People usually give roses or lilies since they look nice. Sure enough, a person like Song Yu who\u2019s been single since he was born has tastes like a straight man.\u201dHead lowered, Yue Zhishi stared at that card, a subtle suspicion growing in his heart. Maybe he was thinking too much, but maybe this was also another one of Song Yu\u2019s riddles.Perhaps Song Yu\u2019s signature was the name of the flowers \u2014 he was someone wandering around the earth, an earthwalker.Yue Zhishi felt a deep sense of satisfaction at getting something with a meaning so hidden underneath the surface, something only the two of them would understand \u2014 as if he really was different from everyone else, as if he really was someone special.Seeing him stand in place in a daze, Qin Yan placed his hands in his pockets and said, \u201cCome, I\u2019ll take you to get some food.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Yue Zhishi hugged his flowers. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good idea going like this.\u201d\u201cWhat, are you afraid of people misunderstanding?\u201d Qin Yan laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my girlfriend will be there too. Let me take you to meet your sister-in-law.\u201dYue Zhishi held an instinctive natural opposition to the word sister-in-law after his childhood blunder, so he didn\u2019t make a single noise and only followed behind Qin Yan. He passed by a flower shop on the way, and he bought a clear and glittering crystal vase. They went back to his dorm before they went to eat, and Yue Zhishi placed the sunflowers neatly into the vase, changing his clothes before he went back down.Qin Yan brought him to a little diner near campus. It wasn\u2019t very large, but it was extraordinarily busy. His cute, short-haired girlfriend had lined up and gotten in early, and she matched very well with Qin Yan.\u201cI feel like everyone suddenly got a girlfriend,\u201d Yue Zhishi said without thinking.\u201cYeah, so when are you getting one.\u201d Qin Yan ordered, and even though Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t speak, all of the things he ordered were food Yue Zhishi could eat. Qin Yan\u2019s girlfriend took out her phone, a forum post appearing on the screen. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your junior brother has pretty much harvested a bunch of female hearts over this military training. It\u2019s comparable to three years ago\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Song Yu from three years ago,\u201d Qin Yan very tacitly continued, and then he told his own girlfriend, \u201cThe two of them during high school were so very eye-catching.\u201dA big bowl of\u00a0sliced fish in chili oil\u00a0was brought up, a bunch of bean sprouts and kelp laid at the bottom. Fillets of catfish filled the top, the soup red and the fish white, and a layer of chives and sesame seeds was sprinkled on top. The lady boss came over as well, her hand holding an iron ladle full of hot oil. She poured the oil over the bowl, and the fragrance wafted to everyone\u2019s faces.\u201cWe weren\u2019t that eye-catching.\u201d Yue Zhishi poured and sent over cups of hawthorn juice. He thought of something, and so he asked Qin Yan, \u201cI keep seeing clubs advertising for new members lately. Is the basketball team also looking for new people?\u201dQin Yan gave a meaty and tender piece of fish to his girlfriend. \u201cYou asked the right person. I\u2019m the vice captain of the university team and am in charge of recruiting new people. I\u2019ve been trying to get more people \u2014 I interviewed a bunch of people just yesterday. You want to join too?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d But Yue Zhishi knew himself very well: \u201cMy body\u2019s not as strong as other people\u2019s, so I might not be able to get into the main team.\u201d\u201cYou can train with your faculty team first. If you really want to join, you can. It\u2019s just that you temporarily might not be able to actually play in a competition.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already signed up to the faculty team. They said they\u2019ll give us training and that I don\u2019t have to worry if I don\u2019t play well.\u201d He even specifically went to look for senior Nan Jia in order to enter the faculty team \u2014 even though she was no longer in the team, she still managed to take him directly over. Everything went very smoothly.That day, Nan Jia had sent him a bunch of information about the faculty and university teams, as well as information about training. She hadn\u2019t chatted much, and this let Yue Zhishi feel she was warm-hearted, yet tactful.Qin Yan nodded in agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s true. You\u2019ll be able to gain some popularity as well. You can play for just half a session if your physical abilities aren\u2019t enough. The only thing is your brother might not agree, just in case something happens.\u201dYue Zhishi silently said in his heart, he wanted to join the university team specifically because of Song Yu.\u201cGege should be the main force in the university team, right?\u201d\u201cWhat else. A lot more people watch too if he\u2019s playing,\u201d Qin Yan said, producing a long sigh after he finished talking.Yue Zhishi was a bit confused and asked in concern, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cA while ago, I told him to come back earlier for training, but he told me he wanted to drop out. He said he\u2019s too busy and doesn\u2019t have the time to compete anymore.\u201d Qin Yan poured a spoonful of soup onto his rice and mixed everything together. \u201cIf he really does drop out, we\u2019ll lose a great general. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to find someone reliable.\u201dYue Zhishi was suddenly disappointed at hearing this \u2014 he\u2019d wanted to enter the basketball team from the moment he\u2019d signed up to the university. He\u2019d even planned to enter the faculty team first before slowly expanding into the main team. He didn\u2019t think Song Yu would quit. But now that he\u2019d already signed up and had even troubled his senior sister, it might be too much to drop out of the team now too.Wuhan U was still very lively at night, and after he separated from Qin Yan, Yue Zhishi slowly walked back to his dorm. Each day Song Yu didn\u2019t return, each day he felt this place didn\u2019t seem like Wuhan U at all \u2014 it felt very foreign. He was already used to going to the library whenever he was by himself, and he read textbooks about his major just like before, when he had yet to start school.He returned back to his dorm at 10pm. Yue Zhishi noticed a bunch of food placed on his desk, many of them snacks he would usually buy. Jiang Yufan was up in his bed, video chatting with his girlfriend, and he dragged open his bed curtain, pulling out an ear bud. \u201cShen Mi was just here. He bought you a bunch of fruit and snacks, and even bought us milk tea. What a good friend.\u201d\u201cHe left already?\u201d Yue Zhishi sat down. He\u2019d eaten too much during dinner and wasn\u2019t able to eat any of the snacks, simply touching the sunflower petals.\u201cMn, he waited for you for a bit, and then he left since you weren\u2019t back yet.\u201dYue Zhishi said okay and also said he\u2019ll visit his dorm tomorrow, before he went into the bathroom. When he came out, he saw his phone on his desk light up and saw a message from Song Yu after he went over to have a look.[Gege: I\u2019ll be back tomorrow.]Just a second ago he was like a frosted eggplant \u2014 and at this very second, Yue Zhishi immediately came back to life.[Yue Zhishi: Really? I\u2019ll pick you up tomorrow, where are you guys getting off the car?]He mutely read his reply again after he sent it out, realising he truly was very impatient to see Song Yu.[Gege: We\u2019ll be dropped off directly at the school entrance, no need for you to come.]Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t satisfied with this \u2014 he still wanted to see him. No matter what time it was, as long as it was to see Song Yu, he would never find it troublesome. But he\u2019d only typed up half of his message expressing his disagreement when he received a new message from Song Yu. It was like a patch coming in just in time.[Gege: I\u2019ll look for you.]The corners of his mouth rose at once. This patch successfully managed to cover up the small hole in Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart.\u201cLe Le, what are you looking at that\u2019s making you so happy?\u201d A dorm mate looked at Yue Zhishi as he came in with a washbasin. \u201cAre you grabbing red pockets?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d His voice unconsciously lilted up in happiness in his reply. Once he sat back down, Yue Zhishi saw the sunflowers on his desk and thought for a bit, before he took a photo. He shared it on his Moments without any text.He only realised he forgot to set who could see the photo after he submitted it; this update accidentally entered his public Moments. He wasn\u2019t able to delete it before someone noticed it.Shen Mi was the first person to give it a like. He even commented twice.[Shen Mi: Yo, who gave you this?][Shen Mi: Did you see the snacks I bought for you?]Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t reply to his first comment, because he felt Song Yu wouldn\u2019t want others to know he gifted someone flowers \u2014 this was something truly unusual for Song Yu, and it might destroy his public image. So Yue Zhishi responded only to Shen Mi\u2019s second question, telling him he was really thankful. This particular update very quickly gained a bunch of likes, including from Qin Yan and senior Nan Jia.The last person to like the photo was Song Yu. Seeing the like notification, Yue Zhishi thought Song Yu wouldn\u2019t comment; it wouldn\u2019t be his usual behaviour. But a few seconds later, he received a new notification from Song Yu\u2019s comment.[Gege: I was even thinking you wouldn\u2019t show off what I gave you.]Yue Zhishi was very surprised. He even swiped out and entered the app again before he read the comment once again \u2014 the comment truly was from Song Yu.This curious and rare comment naturally pulled in Qin Yan, who liked to make a fuss and watch.[Senior Qin Yan replied to gege: have you been possessed? (it was already very strange to deliver flowers, but this handsome man still helped out free of charge)]Qin Yan wasn\u2019t friends with Shen Mi, so Shen Mi wouldn\u2019t be able to see this comment. Thinking Song Yu wouldn\u2019t reply, Yue Zhishi put down his phone, spraying his earthwalkers with some water.Unexpectedly, Song Yu actually responded.[Gege: What\u2019s so strange about it, don\u2019t all the other flag bearers receive flowers from their faculties.][Gege: For the sake of fairness, it can\u2019t be just my flag bearer who doesn\u2019t receive flowers.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 52: A New GiftLin Rong was always joking, saying she didn\u2019t know who Song Yu resembled. She always said this child\u2019s heart was harder than a rock \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t move even if it was poked, and it wouldn\u2019t react even if it was knocked.Stone-hearted Song Yu always appeared to be satisfied with what he had, never showing any interest in other people and the outside world. He never expressed his emotions and never showed his thoughts, and Yue Zhishi thought he liked living hidden away like that \u2014 he truly was like a buried piece of rock.So whenever he expressed anything, it looked visibly, particularly out of place.In the darkened dorm room, Yue Zhishi again and again turned on his phone, clicked into that Moments update, looked at it and closed his phone. These meaningless and repetitive actions weren\u2019t able to dispel the pleasure boiling over in his heart, and he had no way to peacefully fall asleep.His intellect weakened under his pleasure, and so Yue Zhishi no longer thought about why Song Yu acted so differently, forcing himself to close his eyes and sleep while he hugged this fickle happiness.Song Yu came back from his field operations on the day Yue Zhishi needed to attend the tryouts for the basketball main team. He initially hadn\u2019t had any confidence, but Qin Yan pulled at him, saying he may as well try it out and it was fine even if he didn\u2019t get in. He\u2019d agreed, and one hour before he needed to meet Qin Yan in front of the university gym, he received Song Yu\u2019s phone call.\u201cI\u2019m almost at your faculty.\u201d Song Yu asked where he was.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t say anything further, running directly to look for his gege. It was a very sunny day, the shadows of the trees interlacing with bright spots of sunshine, and Yue Zhishi was wearing a white, yellow-trimmed basketball jersey. He ran past some girls carrying parasols, a breeze following behind him.Song Yu stood next to the clear glass doors inside the ground floor of a classroom building. He was looking at his phone, head half lowered, and there were clearly people going to and fro \u2014 and yet it was like he was surrounded by an aura naturally isolating him from the rest of the world. Yue Zhishi saw him as soon as he arrived.He pushed open the door and went in. The aircon was turned on very highly, and he was unable to stop himself from shuddering from the sudden change in temperature. He happened to be seen just as Song Yu raised his head, and affection very clearly entered Song Yu\u2019s indifferent eyes as he walked towards Yue Zhishi from the pillar in the hall.\u201cHow come you\u2019re dressed like this?\u201d Song Yu looked at his jersey. Yue Zhishi\u2019s collarbones and arms were both exposed, and with a white coloured jersey, his innately pale skin made him look like a little porcelain man once he stood underneath the sun.\u201cI need to go the gym in a bit, Qin Yan gege said he\u2019s taking me to the tryouts.\u201d Afraid Song Yu would laugh at him, Yue Zhishi decided to attack himself first. \u201cI know I definitely won\u2019t be chosen, I just want to go have a look.\u201dOnce he was closer, he smelled a light lemon fragrance from Song Yu\u2019s body. It was the fragrance of his usual shower gel, and he realised Song Yu was wearing a loose white t-shirt without any decorations on it. He wasn\u2019t wearing a backpack, his hair loose and relaxed, and he looked almost lazy. He didn\u2019t look tired or worn out from coming back from his outside field operations at all.\u201cIt\u2019ll be very dangerous for your body to compete,\u201d Song Yu still decided to say.Yue Zhishi said, changing the conversation topic, \u201cDid you shower after coming back?\u201dSong Yu paused, saying after a long while, \u201cMn.\u201d His facial expression looked a bit awkward. \u201cI feel more comfortable after showering.\u201d\u201cYou smell really nice.\u201d Yue Zhishi took a step closer. \u201cI especially like the smell of this shower gel. It\u2019s a bit like that boyfriend cologne my previous high school desk mate gave me to smell.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s unexpected statements frequently interrupted the rhythm of Song Yu\u2019s talking. Sometimes, he needed to bring the rhythm back himself.He first said Yue Zhishi could buy the same one if he liked it, and then he lowered his head, stretching his hand into his pant pocket. \u201cI picked up something this time.\u201d He spoke very casually, as if he\u2019d picked up a useless ball of paper or empty drink bottle that no one wanted. But when his hand finally came out of his pocket, Yue Zhishi realised \u2014 it was a very striking piece of stone. The surface was black, and it looked a bit like a piece of coal despite Yue Zhishi not having seen a real piece of coal before.He carefully picked up the stone resting in Song Yu\u2019s hand. It wasn\u2019t a large piece at all, only about the size of a\u00a0mangosteen, and it looked a bit strange. The outer layer was black, and Yue Zhishi only noticed one side had been sliced after turning the stone around.\u00a0Lustrous and beautiful blue-coloured stone could be seen from the cut, dark-coloured lines crisscrossed on top.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? It\u2019s so pretty!\u201d Yue Zhishi raised his head to look at him, his amber eyes glowing.Song Yu pulled out a transparent little bag. It held a very thinly sliced stone specimen, and a label was stuck onto the bag. \u2018Turquoise\u2019 was written on the label, as well as the time and place it was found.\u201cThe mountain area we went to seemed to produce these kinds of stones. I just happened to see them during our field operations, so I picked up a piece and cut off a fragment as a specimen. I don\u2019t need the leftover stone, so I can give it to you, if you want it.\u201dHe continued to sound as if this didn\u2019t matter to him at all, but Yue Zhishi was extremely happy. \u201cOf course I want it!\u201d His gaze shifted from the stone to Song Yu\u2019s face. \u201cDid everyone find some too?\u201dSong Yu moved his eyes away. \u201cNot really.\u201d Just him.\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Yue Zhishi stared at his gift. \u201cThis looks so dark and dirty, it must\u2019ve been really hard to recognise in the mountains. You\u2019re so amazing.\u201dHis praises were always without any reservations.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing special. It\u2019s just because I\u2019ve studied a bit about it.\u201d\u201cAre you giving this whole piece to me?\u201d Yue Zhishi held onto the stone, looking towards him. \u201cThe entire piece?\u201dSong Yu nodded and shook the specimen bag in his hand. \u201cI just need a small fragment, everything else is yours.\u201d\u201cAnd in the future? You might continue finding many special little stones in the future, can you give them all to me too?\u201d It was habit for Yue Zhishi to reach out a hand and touch Song Yu\u2019s wrist whenever he started feeling anxious. His hand was very hot, Song Yu\u2019s skin cool, and it wasn\u2019t only their body temperatures that were transmitted across this touch \u2014 but also many vague and indistinct feelings.\u201cMy job isn\u2019t to find stones. This was just a coincidence.\u201d But Song Yu still added, \u201cIf I see any, I\u2019ll still bring them back.\u201d He glanced at Yue Zhishi. \u201cWhy do you want so many stones? Are you going to sell them?\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head. \u201cOf course not, I\u2019m keeping them all for me. This is a memento from an earthwalker.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s face once again looked awkward. He changed the conversation, asking when Yue Zhishi was meant to meet with Qin Yan. Only then did Yue Zhishi startle awake, and he grabbed Song Yu\u2019s hand, looking at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, I still have half an hour.\u201dSong Yu originally said he wanted to go back to his dorm and sleep, but Yue Zhishi said he wanted Song Yu to go with him, to give him some courage \u2014 so Song Yu gave up and agreed to go.\u201cBut other people don\u2019t know you\u2019re my little brother.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Yue Zhishi said very innocently, \u201cIt\u2019ll be easier for me to get distracted if you\u2019re standing there. I won\u2019t be so nervous.\u201dIt was very hot the entire way to the gym from the classroom building, and Yue Zhishi looked at the girls carrying umbrellas with a touch of envy. \u201cI want an umbrella too.\u201dSong Yu looked at the pale, almost blinding skin he exposed. \u201cYou should\u2019ve worn some sun protection clothing.\u201dYue Zhishi slid over his suggestion. \u201cLet me tell you, Jiang Yufan\u2019s always showing off in front of me every day, saying it\u2019s so good to have a girlfriend. He can use her as an excuse to hold up an umbrella and doesn\u2019t need to burn under the sun. He even said his girlfriend\u2019s hand is so small it\u2019s particularly cute \u2014 and that it\u2019s really comfortable to hold.\u201dListening to this, Song Yu held up Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand and said, a bit ill-timed: \u201cYours isn\u2019t large either.\u201dYue Zhishi frowned at hearing this, thinking this was a type of mocking. He pulled away his hand. \u201cMy hand\u2019s quite large, I can hold a basketball with one hand for ten seconds.\u201d\u201cVery amazing,\u201d Song Yu flatly praised.The two of them saw Qin Yan in front of the gymnasium building. He was playing games, squatting on the steps, and looked just like a down to earth youth. Song Yu climbed up the steps, and Qin Yan only lifted his head when Song Yu was standing right in front of him. \u201cYo, you\u2019re back. You\u2019re here with your brother?\u201dHe looked at Yue Zhishi. \u201cLe Le looks so handsome in that jersey.\u201d\u201cAm I not allowed to come?\u201d Song Yu asked.Qin Yan stood up, stretched out his neck and brought the two of them into the building. \u201cNo one said that. You scum man may have let me down, but our team will always remember your contributions.\u201dHis words were very funny, and Yue Zhishi took the chance to ask, \u201cThen have you guys seen any suitable new members? Ones who can compare to my ge.\u201d\u201cJust look at how Le Le phrased his words \u2014 are you trying to say no one is as good as your brother?\u201d After teasing him, Qin Yan then seriously said, \u201cWe actually did find someone suitable. His physical fitness and innate explosive power are all pretty good, and even though there\u2019s still some space for him to improve his skills, he should luckily have no problems taking care of Song Yu\u2019s empty spot.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded, saying that\u2019s good. He could hear the sounds of basketball shoes squeaking against the floor as he walked in the corridor. Qin Yan pushed open the door, and there were quite a few people inside, the already established team members and new members here for the tryouts split into two separate areas. Qin Yan walked in front, many people greeting him and Song Yu face to face, and Yue Zhishi found it a bit uncomfortable \u2014 it felt like he was walking in, framed between two big bosses, and everyone took the chance to give him a look.So he retreated slightly backwards. Qin Yan saw someone and twisted his head over, telling them, \u201cHey, that\u2019s the new guy I said would replace Song Yu.\u201d He then whistled at someone\u2019s back.The other person turned around, and Yue Zhishi was a bit astonished. \u201cShen Mi?\u201dShen Mi saw them as well, and he enthusiastically and happily ran over after he threw his ball to someone else. Utter satisfaction covered Qin Yan\u2019s face, and he crossed his arms over his chest, nudging Song Yu\u2019s shoulder with his own. \u201cWhat do you think? The successor I found for you isn\u2019t too bad, right?\u201d\u201cI really do have to thank you.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s gaze darkened, his tone strange enough for Qin Yan to give him a sideway glance.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You learn how to\u00a0mask-change\u00a0in the mountains?\u201dArriving in front of them, Shen Mi warmly greeted them. \u201cSenior Qin Yan, senior Song Yu.\u201d And then, smiling at Yue Zhishi, \u201cLe Le, you\u2019re here too.\u201d\u201cI came to have a look.\u201d Yue Zhishi was a bit unconfident, but he still smiled at Shen Mi. \u201cCongratulations, I hear you got into the main team.\u201dShen Mi rubbed the hair at the back of his head. \u201cAh, it was mostly coincidence. Senior Song Yu just so happened to be leaving.\u201d\u201cWho said I\u2019m leaving?\u201d Song Yu raised an eyebrow. \u201cI only said I\u2019m falling back to second string, I don\u2019t have any intention of leaving the team.\u201dQin Yan pivoted his head over to him,\u00a0his eyes as wide as copper bells. \u201cBig bro, are you joking with me.\u201d\u201cAre you really not dropping out?\u201d Yue Zhishi grabbed hold of Song Yu\u2019s arm, unbelievably happy. \u201cThen gege, you\u2019re going to stay in the basketball team? Will it be too hard on you?\u201dSong Yu was clearly answering Yue Zhishi\u2019s questions, but his eyes flicked over at Shen Mi. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to play occasionally.\u201dShen Mi didn\u2019t look too disappointed. \u201cThat\u2019s really good, I was always regretful that I was never able to learn from senior Song Yu before.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded his head again and again. \u201cMy ge really is really good at basketball, you\u2019ll definitely improve if you train with him.\u201dNo matter what, Song Yu not leaving the team was fantastic news to them. Even though Qin Yan felt he had been mercilessly played around with, he still shared this news to the other team members with great enthusiasm.\u201cHe\u2019s really not leaving! That\u2019s great, that\u2019s great!\u201d\u201cI was even sad for a bit too.\u201d\u201cSad that half the girls won\u2019t be watching anymore?\u201d\u201cHahahaha! But how come senior Song Yu suddenly changed his mind?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m curious too!\u201dEveryone was gossiping when the gym\u2019s inner doors were once again pushed open, and Yue Zhishi looked over. \u201cEh? Senior Nan Jia?\u201dNan Jia\u2019s appearance excited all the guys in the gym, including Qin Yan. Only Song Yu looked at Yue Zhishi. \u201cAre you familiar with her?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Yue Zhishi blinked. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a long story. Senior Nan Jia helped me out a lot, and she\u2019s a super nice person.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t too high of a risk factor in his evaluation, so Song Yu decided to put it aside for the moment.Contrary to usual, Nan Jia wore a slim black tracksuit, her hair tied into a ponytail. She looked full of energy, and she greeted everyone with warmth and enthusiasm. The popularity of a beautiful senior sister in the midst of the all male team went without saying. \u201cYou guys must be tired. I bought you guys some milk tea, and the drinks will arrive in a bit.\u201d\u201cThank you senior!\u201d\u201cSenior\u2019s such a good person!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re all very welcome.\u201d Nan Jia finally arrived next to Qin Yan, and her eyes were visibly pleasantly surprised when she saw Song Yu. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were leaving the team?\u201d\u201cThis little shit keeps changing his mind. He says he\u2019s not leaving,\u201d Qin Yan ridiculed.Song Yu threw him a look in disdain. Nan Jia then said, \u201cThen that means you\u2019ll be coming back too?\u201d\u201cToo?\u201d Yue Zhishi looked at Nan Jia in doubt, suddenly thinking of that time he\u2019d been hit with heat exhaustion and Nan Jia had carelessly talked about her history of being a manager in the basketball team.Qin Yan startled. \u201cFuck, are you returning back to the main team?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Nan Jia curved her head down, a very playful expression on her face. \u201cI\u2019ve finished my previous law popularisation volunteer work. I still have time to spare this semester, so I applied to transfer back to the main team as the manager.\u201d\u201cWait here, I need to tell everyone about this inspiring piece of news.\u201d Qin Yan ran off as soon as he finished speaking, and not much longer after, the entire gym full of guys learned of this news \u2014 they only managed to just hold back from shouting and jumping for joy.\u201cSenior, you\u2019re so popular.\u201d Yue Zhishi watched that crowd of feverishly excited guys from far away and couldn\u2019t help but sigh with emotion.Nan Jia patted Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLe Le, are you participating in the tryouts today? I\u2019ll measure your arm span for you, let me experience the superior proportions of a mixed race person.\u201d\u201cHis legs are super long,\u201d Shen Mi couldn\u2019t help but praise.\u201cI know you.\u201d Nan Jia stretched out her hand in a fist, and the two of them bumped their fists together. \u201cDiamond in the rough. Work hard.\u201dYue Zhishi realised every popular person seemed to have a natural affinity for others. Just like Nan Jia \u2014 she could skillfully and easily interact and talk with anyone with sincerity, and her kind of relaxing, soothing personality was entirely suited to be the basketball team\u2019s manager.With two good news coming right after another, Qin Yan made a decision there and then. \u201cWe\u2019re having a dinner party after the tryouts, no one\u2019s allowed to leave! Two of our great generals have returned to us today, and so many new friends have also joined us \u2014 we need to celebrate!\u201dAs soon as the topic turned to the tryouts, Yue Zhishi\u2019s stomach started to ache; that was how his body reacted to stress whenever he was nervous. He clutched Song Yu\u2019s arm and very quietly whispered: \u201cI\u2019m a bit worried.\u201dSong Yu lifted his hand and patted Yue Zhishi\u2019s back twice like a kind senior, but he didn\u2019t take his hand back immediately. He left his hand on his shoulder blades as if he was reluctant to move away, stroking a few times very slowly.This method of diverting his attention was very effective. In a moment, Yue Zhishi once again smelled the very light shower fragrance on Song Yu\u2019s body, and in this gym full of hormones and sweat, this subtle smell silently wrapped around his entire body \u2014 it was like a transparent barrier, protective and possessive.The tryouts went by much faster than he\u2019d imagined. Nan Jia measured their weight, height, arm spans and other kinds of body data, leaving the actual skills tryout to the team captain.\u201cI actually didn\u2019t grow,\u201d Yue Zhishi grumbled, coming off of the body weight and height scale. He refused to believe it and went back on again \u2014 the numbers remained the same. Nan Jia found him particularly cute. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t grown, I\u2019m still one centimetre away from 180cm.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s face was full of bewilderment. \u201cI feel like I have, it\u2019s almost been three months. How come it\u2019s so hard to grow one single centimetre.\u201dQin Yan said maybe his bones were already fused together, but Nan Jia interrupted him and said, laughing, \u201cIt definitely must be our machine\u2019s fault. I\u2019ll give you 180cm.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you making a false report then?\u201d Qin Yan said loudly on purpose. \u201cWhere\u2019s your moral fortitude as a basketball manager.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with doing so?\u201d Nan Jia recorded down the data as she continued to banter. \u201cYou have 170cm guys reporting themselves as 175cm, and 180cm guys report themselves as 183cm. If someone actually did get to 185cm, I bet they\u2019d engrave it onto their faces as an admission pass.\u201dYue Zhishi laughed in amusement and turned his head around to look at the 186cm Song Yu, who was helping out in the tryouts. He carried the ball through the crowd, going up to the basket with movements as natural and smooth as water and his face clear of any waves. In a crowd of basketball team members, none of whom were short, he completely stood out like a crane among the chickens.Everyone left the gym after the tryouts ended. Because of his unique body, Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t able to enter the main team, and Nan Jia kept comforting him the entire way. But Yue Zhishi had already predicted this from a long time ago, and the result matched his predictions entirely \u2014 so he wasn\u2019t all that disappointed.Qin Yan, Song Yu and the rest of the old team members walked in front, chatting with the new recruits as they walked out the campus. They wanted to throw a dinner party, and Yue Zhishi, who had failed to be chosen, didn\u2019t actually want to follow along. But with Song Yu there, he still slightly wavered \u2014 and since Qin Yan and Nan Jia had both told him to come along, Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t able to escape.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Le Le. You can still come to train with the main team.\u201d Nan Jia said, \u201cYou can come whenever you want, especially since your senior Qin Yan will be there too.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi hesitated a bit over his wording. \u201cWill senior Song Yu train too?\u201d\u201cHim?\u201d Nan Jia smiled. \u201cVery rarely. But Song Yu came every day when we were in first year, and he always stayed until he was the last one to leave.\u201dYue Zhishi very frankly asked, \u201cHow do you know?\u201dA hint of nostalgia appeared on her face. \u201cI had just started working as the basketball manager at that time. I needed to help out every day with sorting out the basketballs, ordering the jerseys and all kinds of very minor odd jobs. Sometimes the team wouldn\u2019t pack up after training, so I needed to stay behind and clean. I was in the gym every day with a lot of spare time, and sometimes I\u2019d do my homework as I sat in the benches. Song Yu didn\u2019t even know I was there in the beginning \u2014 he\u2019d thought there was no one else in the gym, and he\u2019d practice shooting by himself again and again.\u201dNan Jia smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand why he needed to practice so often. His shooting accuracy was already so high. One time, I couldn\u2019t hold back anymore and asked him why he kept shooting as I sat in the benches. It was the first time he saw me, but he didn\u2019t speak to me at all \u2014 he grabbed his clothes and immediately left.\u201d Nan Jia looked at Yue Zhishi, her face carrying an emotion she usually didn\u2019t show. It looked a bit like she was cutely whining, and the tone of her voice was very cute. \u201cHe was super cold.\u201dYue Zhishi wanted to say Song Yu wasn\u2019t someone like that at all, but he faintly felt Nan Jia actually was aware of that \u2014 so he didn\u2019t say anything. An absurd thought suddenly appeared in his mind: he wanted to be that person sitting silently, soundlessly in the benches at that time.Socialising expert Qin Yan chose one of their usual barbecue restaurants, its atmosphere very suitable for parties. Nan Jia seemed to abruptly think of something when they reached the entrance of the restaurant. \u201cOh yes, I saw Song Yu replied to your Moments update yesterday. Your relationship with him\u2026\u201dA guy entered in front of them, and he cared only for himself, not thinking of the people behind him \u2014 the heavy glass door slid backwards, about to close, and Yue Zhishi grabbed the edge of the door. He pulled it open again and let Nan Jia in first. Qin Yan was yelling out her name inside, asking her to pick the tables.In the midst of all these things, Nan Jia rushed inside in a hurry and forgot to continue what she was about to ask.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know when Shen Mi first appeared next to him, but his eyes remained only on Song Yu, who seemed to be enclosed by a crowd. A tall and sturdy senior headed towards the two of them and very heavily smacked Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder, his words brash and like a hooligan. \u201cHey, they say you\u2019re mixed. What countries are you mixed with?\u201dYue Zhishi felt like this guy was a bit impolite, but he still sincerely replied, \u201cMy mom\u2019s from England.\u201d\u201cOh, England. Ladies like the way you mixed guys look.\u201d The senior\u2019s words seemed to be praising him, but his face carried a hint of condescension. \u201cAre you close with Nan Jia? Are you from the law faculty too?\u201dSeeing Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want to speak, Shen Mi answered for him. \u201cYes. Senior, are you from the same faculty?\u201d\u201cYep, I\u2019m your dear old faculty senior.\u201d He stretched out a hand, looking as if he wanted to grasp Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder, but Shen Mi looked like he had no idea what was happening and stuck himself in between them. He even smiled and said, \u201cSenior, then does that mean I can ask you questions if I have any problems in the future?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d The senior glanced at him. He jerked his chin over when he heard the tables were ready. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Law faculty kids should sit together.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t like these kinds of arbitrary commands \u2014 he only wanted to sit together with Song Yu, but it felt like he would look very childish if he directly asked to do so. And besides, this entire affair actually didn\u2019t have much to do with him; he was really only here to freeload some food and didn\u2019t have much right to ask for anything.There were too many people, so they needed to be split between two large tables. His momentary hesitation meant he was forcefully brought to one of them, and half the people at the table were from the law faculty, the other half from either the electrical or civil engineering faculties. Luckily, Shen Mi and Nan Jia sat next to him on his left and right sides, or else he might\u2019ve actually ran away.After sitting down, Yue Zhishi kept sending messages to Song Yu; he would then lift his head and look in his direction, but Song Yu was being bothered by the guy sitting next to him. The guy kept asking him questions, and it looked like Song Yu didn\u2019t have any time to look at his phone. Yue Zhishi reached into his pocket, clutching the small stone Song Yu gave him.Everyone was chatting as they waited for the food to be brought up. A guy suddenly raised his phone in the midst of their conversation. \u201cHey, someone posted in their Moments saying senior Song Yu came back for sister Nan Jia.\u201dAnd then very quickly, all the guys on the table started to hoot, and someone even turned around to the other table, joking with a teammate. Both tables started to make a fuss.Shen Mi peeped at Yue Zhishi, thinking he looked calmer than he\u2019d expected.Nan Jia, the person in the centre of all the fuss, kept trying to stop their teasing. \u201cThat\u2019s not true, can you guys please not spread rumours? Neither of us knew the other was coming back, it was solely a coincidence.\u201dThe first guy to make a fuss started to tease again. \u201cTsk tsk, already using the word \u2018us\u2019.\u201d\u201cCan you not take it out of context.\u201d Nan Jia severely said, \u201cSeriously, don\u2019t be like this, this has nothing to do with anything. You guys seriously have nothing better to do.\u201dRight then, Yue Zhishi really wanted to leave. He not only wanted to leave, he even wanted to take Song Yu away.The senior who\u2019d make things a bit difficult for Yue Zhishi pressed down the guy who was making a fuss. \u201cEat your food. I want to see if I can plug up your broken mouth later when the alcohol\u2019s here.\u201dThe aircon was set to a very low temperature, and Nan Jia asked Yue Zhishi if he was cold. During the tryouts, she learned Yue Zhishi had a serious allergy, his body relatively fragile, so she paid particular attention to him. But her actions seemed to really annoy that large and bulky senior.The alcohol arrived earlier than the food, and it came over in a large box. Yue Zhishi looked over \u2014 Song Yu was being held by Qin Yan, not saying a single word. He also turned his head over to look in Yue Zhishi\u2019s direction, and their gazes just happened to meet. Both sides were very noisy, and with the two tables separated, neither of them knew what was happening on their respective tables.Yue Zhishi mouthed the word \u2018phone\u2019 to him, but Song Yu squinted, looking a bit puzzled.Yue Zhishi did it again, exaggerating his lip movements, and looked a bit cute. Song Yu seemed to finally understand, and he lowered his head to look for his cellphone.\u201cOkay okay, I\u2019m not going to talk nonsense. Let\u2019s just welcome everyone by having a good drink \u2014 no one\u2019s allowed to escape today.\u201d The bulky senior opened a bottle of alcohol one by one, sending the opened ones around. He made it look like everyone was to have their own bottle.Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t drink beer, so he specifically told him, \u201cSenior, I\u2019m allergic to beer. No need to open one for me.\u201d\u201cBullshit. Nine out of ten people who say they\u2019re allergic to alcohol are lying.\u201d The senior forcefully pushed the bottle in his hand to Yue Zhishi. \u201cHold it.\u201dNan Jia was slightly unhappy. \u201cWang Zhi, what are you doing. He\u2019s already said he\u2019s allergic. He\u2019s not joking.\u201d\u201cNothing\u2019ll happen to him with just a bit.\u201d Wang Zhi spoke a bit softer to Nan Jia, but he didn\u2019t change his attitude at all. \u201cHold the bottle. I\u2019ve already said no one\u2019s allowed to run today.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t reach out to grab it, and the atmosphere turned very rigid. Knowing very well how to take a hint, Shen Mi took the bottle. \u201cSenior, look, I\u2019ll drink for him. What do you think \u2014 I can match you bottle for bottle.\u201d He immediately started to gulp the beer down, and over half of the bottle disappeared in one go. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t manage to stop him in time, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to drink.\u201dShen Mi wiped away the alcohol on his mouth and placed the bottle back on the table. He said, smiling, \u201cSenior, he\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\u201cJust what? You\u2019re pretty good, hey. It\u2019s only your first day, and you\u2019re already trying to act like a hero. Did I agree for you to drink?\u201d The longer he spoke, the harder it was to hold Wang Zhi back. He grabbed a newly opened bottle, left his seat and circled around to stand next to Yue Zhishi. He ignored Nan Jia and Shen Mi, directly saying to Yue Zhishi: \u201cYou have no choice but to drink today. This is basic courtesy \u2014 you need to respect your elders, understand? You\u2019ll only be considered a man if you drink. I\u2019ll admire you then.\u201dYue Zhishi raised his head and gazed at Wang Zhi. His voice was very calm, his words very direct. \u201cBut I don\u2019t need you to admire me.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Wang Zhi wanted to reach out and grab his hand, prepared to force him to hold the bottle \u2014 but very quickly, his hand was grabbed by another person and was very rudely flung away. He wasn\u2019t able to touch Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm.Yue Zhishi saw Song Yu as soon as he looked up. Just by looking at his face, he could tell that he was extremely angry.Wang Zhi had never liked Song Yu. \u201cWhat? You here to fight me too?\u201dSong Yu spoke coldly, indifferently. \u201cHe can\u2019t drink.\u201dWang Zhi laughed in anger. \u201cWhat a joke. He\u2019s a new student in our law faculty. I\u2019m teaching my own junior brother how to act like a proper person, so what are you, a geomatics student, doing here?\u201dSong Yu sneered and lightly repeated, \u201cJunior brother\u2026\u201dHe looked at Wang Zhi, his gaze cold and stern. \u201cWhat a coincidence. Guess who he is.\u201dThe look on Wang Zhi\u2019s face started to change as he stared at Song Yu\u2019s colder than usual face.\u201cWho are you to teach my little brother?\u201dThe author has something to say:Senior Nan Jia is a very good person (strongly stressing this). I really don\u2019t like writing poisonous female supporting characters, and I also don\u2019t like it when girls are \u2018identified\u2019 as something hhhh. There\u2019s nothing wrong with liking someone. If she had really wanted to cling and stick onto SY, she would\u2019ve done it already in the last three years of university. She\u2019s the faculty flower too, and til now, Song Yu still hasn\u2019t felt her arrow (he\u2019s actually worried she likes Le Le). You can tell senior hasn\u2019t done anything.(spoiler)She\u2019s the most important assist to Le Le. She\u2019ll trigger his change of mentality, where he realises he actually likes gege.(/end spoiler)From her head to her toes, she\u2019s a very good girl.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53: Lingbo Plank RoadThe two of them were close to hitting each other. Yue Zhishi stood up without a single thought and went to stand in front of Song Yu. Qin Yan, Shen Mi and other guys came in time to pull apart the two guys in conflict so that they didn\u2019t actually end up fighting.Despite being in the basketball team for so long, Song Yu had always been like a ghost. If Qin Yan hadn\u2019t been there with him, Song Yu might\u2019ve forever floated outside the crowd, never speaking and never socially interacting \u2014 he never mixed in unless it was for training or for a competition. But he may have always been cool and indifferent, but he had never clashed with another team member before.His blow up this time didn\u2019t seem like him at all, so many people found it very strange. Of course, people were more surprised that the mixed-race junior brother Qin Yan had been taking care of was actually Song Yu\u2019s little brother.\u201cStop, stop. This is only our first day, no need to ruin our team spirit.\u201d Qin Yan was in the middle, trying to lighten the situation. He patted Wang Zhi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cZhi bro, our little friend here really wasn\u2019t lying to you when he said he couldn\u2019t drink. You wouldn\u2019t know this, but we used to be in the same secondary school. Le Le suffered an allergic reaction during one of our school opening ceremonies and almost went into anaphylactic shock. It was so scary. His life was saved only because his brother was luckily there too. Look, we\u2019re meant to have fun tonight over dinner \u2014 if something really happened, whose fault would it be?\u201dHis words were like a needle wrapped in cotton, subtly and yet cleanly reminding Wang Zhi. Qin Yan turned around and then said to the other team members, \u201cI\u2019ll pay for all the alcohol myself today. I\u2019ll treat all of you, drink as much as you want. Don\u2019t force it if you don\u2019t want to drink, I\u2019ll call over a waiter in a bit for some coke and sprite. Everyone should enjoy themselves.\u201d\u201cWhy buy coke?\u201d Nan Jia threw him a look, a slightly annoyed look on her face. \u201cDoes no one want to drink the milk tea I bought earlier? Since everyone likes drinking alcohol so much, I won\u2019t buy milk tea for you guys ever again. Such a waste of time and effort.\u201dThe expression on Wang Zhi\u2019s face kept changing. His initially stiff face now looked more uncomfortable, and he looked as if he wanted to say something. The other guys heard Nan Jia and immediately said things like, \u201cOf course not, I like milk tea best. Who likes alcohol.\u201d\u201cI really, really don\u2019t like it when guys force people to drink. No matter if they\u2019re forcing guys or girls, it\u2019s always against their will.\u201d Nan Jia looked at Wang Zhi. \u201cYou study law too. You should know how many civil disputes are caused by alcohol.\u201dNan Jia had already spoken like this \u2014 even if he wasn\u2019t willing, Wang Zhi still gave in a bit irritably. \u201cFine fine fine. Just fucking blame it all on me.\u201d\u201cAll right, all right, let\u2019s just pretend nothing happened.\u201d Qin Yan glanced at Shen Mi and chuckled. \u201cLook at how red Xiao Shen looks after gulping down half a bottle.\u201dAs he continued chatting about things to ease the atmosphere, Qin Yan held onto Song Yu\u2019s arm, as if he was afraid Song Yu would throw a fit and run off. He also gave Song Yu a look. \u201cCalm down, don\u2019t be angry.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s face continued to be icily indifferent. He didn\u2019t want to say a single thing more to the other people, so he flicked Yue Zhishi a look. \u201cSit next to me.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d He had been recovering from his fright, worried gege would start fighting with that Wang Zhi, when Yue Zhishi once again cheered up. He happily followed behind Song Yu in satisfaction. The junior brother from earlier, who\u2019d had so many questions as he sat next to Song Yu, started foolishly giggling once he heard he was now sitting next to senior Nan Jia. There was nothing he wanted more.\u201cSure enough, no matter how charismatic a senior brother is, he can\u2019t compare to a senior sister,\u201d Qin Yan sighed as he sat down. He couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter once he saw Yue Zhishi. \u201cLe Le, you\u2019re so energetic now that you\u2019re over here. I looked at you a few times when you were sitting on the other table, and you looked like you were cramping.\u201d\u201cI want to sit with you guys.\u201d Yue Zhishi was being slightly, a tiny bit dishonest. He actually only wanted to sit with Song Yu, so he very quickly changed the conversation, trying to lighten the guilt he felt at lying. \u201cSenior Qin Yan, what did you guys order? I want roasted green pepper.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve ordered that already. We\u2019ve ordered everything you like eating.\u201d Qin Yan peeked at the silent Song Yu and leaned onto the table to say to Yue Zhishi, \u201cLook at how important you are. Your brother\u2019s been with the basketball team for so long, and yet he\u2019s never joined us for dinner. He must\u2019ve come only for you. This is also his first time ordering stuff, he usually doesn\u2019t care and eats whatever.\u201dHe then looked at Song Yu again. \u201cLook, don\u2019t be mad at Wang Zhi. That guy\u2019s not afraid of anything, and he\u2019ll get into trouble sooner or later once he graduates. No need to fight with him \u2014 it won\u2019t be nice if rumours get out.\u201d He once again lightly bumped his shoulder against Song Yu and said, grinning, \u201cIf someone\u2019s angry, I\u2019m not angry; if you wreck your body from anger, no one can replace you.\u201dQin Yan had thought Song Yu wouldn\u2019t reply to him, but Song Yu unexpectedly said, \u201cReally? Then who immediately went to find my replacement after I\u2019d only lifted one foot to leave?\u201d\u201cHey, don\u2019t be so petty.\u201d Qin Yan cracked up. \u201cLe Le, look at your brother! Help return some justice to me!\u201dYue Zhishi was originally biting on his chopsticks, and he started to laugh along after he heard this exchange. He gazed at the side of Song Yu\u2019s face. \u201cWho told you to leave.\u201dSong Yu turned his head over, giving Yue Zhishi a not very happy look. Yue Zhishi immediately lifted a hand to touch his arm, whispering\u00a0I was wrong, I was wrong\u00a0as a pleading look filled his face. Song Yu only turned his head back after being coaxed a few times and silently drank some boiled water.The barbecue skewers came one after another, the spicy cumin fragrance highly tantalising to the appetite. Yue Zhishi picked up the skewers and used his chopsticks to pull the roasted food off the iron sticks, eating slowly after he placed the now empty skewers to the side.\u201cHow was your fieldwork this time?\u201d Qin Yan chatted as he ate. \u201cWere you guys really sleeping in tents?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Song Yu said the terrain of the mountains they\u2019d gone to was unusual; the villages were all at the foot of the mountains, and there were very few people living in that area.\u201cYou should go learn some rock climbing or some wilderness survival stuff, just in case something bad\u2026\u201d Before Qin Yan could finish his joke, Song Yu had already elbowed him \u2014 the second half of his words were all pushed back into his stomach. Qin Yan initially thought Song Yu couldn\u2019t handle the teasing, but he very quickly realised, glancing at Yue Zhishi who was sitting next to Song Yu.Song Yu also looked over. Fortunately, Yue Zhishi was always very focused on his food whenever he ate, and he looked like he was brawling with a barbecued chicken foot and didn\u2019t hear what Qin Yan had said.Qin Yan changed the subject, his voice slightly louder. \u201cS.Yu, you don\u2019t treat me like a brother at all. Going out for studies can also be considered as going on a trip, and yet you didn\u2019t even bring me back a local gift.\u201dHaving finished his chicken foot, Yue Zhishi coincidentally heard Qin Yan. \u201cHe didn\u2019t bring a gift back for you?\u201dSong Yu twisted around to give Yue Zhishi a look, as if warning him not to say anything, but Yue Zhishi completely didn\u2019t take notice at all \u2014 he cared only about showing off to Qin Yan. \u201cGege brought me something.\u201d\u201cAs expected, you can\u2019t be friends with people with damned younger brother complexes,\u201d Qin Yan complained.Yue Zhishi groped out that little stone in his pocket with a great deal of enthusiasm and sent it over to Qin Yan, his arm reaching across Song Yu. \u201cLook!\u201dQin Yan puffed out a laugh the instant he saw the rock. He didn\u2019t even take it. \u201cWhat\u2019s this, I thought it\u2019d be something nice. He only picked up a dirty rock for you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not!\u201d Yue Zhishi was very dissatisfied with Qin Yan and wanted to explain to him what it was \u2014 but the Song Yu sitting in between them pulled his hand back. After Yue Zhishi freed himself, he stubbornly went around Song Yu and forced Qin Yan to look at the other side of the stone. \u201cSenior, look at this side. The outside looks really plain, but it\u2019s very beautiful on the inside.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Qin Yan only then saw it. \u201cIt\u2019s blue on the inside.\u201d But his sense of novelty lasted for only a few seconds. \u201cBut this is still just a rock.\u201dYue Zhishi felt like there was no way he could fully explain. This was clearly a very precious stone, yet Qin Yan didn\u2019t care.Having noticed Yue Zhishi\u2019s disappointment, Song Yu looked over. He said to Qin Yan, pretending to speak carelessly, \u201cThis is a turquoise.\u201dQin Yan did have a decent family background. He might not be able to recognise the raw stone, but he understood as soon as he heard the name. \u201cReally? Turquoise? How much does this usually go for?\u201dSong Yu mildly said, \u201cThe clearest, deepest blue ones cost several thousand rmb for one gram. This one\u2019s high clarity and is a sky blue colour. Calculate it yourself.\u201d\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Qin Yan immediately changed his attitude. \u201cYu bro, you\u2019re too fucking amazing. You can make a fortune just by picking up rocks. Do you have any left for me? That one\u2019s too small, do you have one the size of a watermelon?\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t bother with him anymore, silently eating his food.\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was this expensive.\u201d Yue Zhishi leaned in very closely to Song Yu, almost sticking onto his arm. \u201cDid you really find it?\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201d Song Yu gave him a piece of roasted green pepper. \u201cStop looking at it and eat.\u201dYue Zhishi listened to him obediently. After eating a whole meal together, he realised the majority of the other team members were actually not bad, all of them having delightful senses of humour.Everyone was slightly curious about Yue Zhishi\u2019s outer appearance and his brotherly relationship with Song Yu. It was human nature to be curious, and Yue Zhishi had long gotten used to it.But he wasn\u2019t used to Song Yu suddenly starting to explain: he said they weren\u2019t true brothers, and they didn\u2019t have any blood relation at all. He never used to say this and used to never care how other people interpreted their relationship \u2014 as long as he didn\u2019t need to mention Yue Zhishi\u2019s passed away parents.So Yue Zhishi now found it a bit foreign, hearing Song Yu personally admitting their relationship. He wasn\u2019t feeling regret because they weren\u2019t true brothers. He was feeling something else entirely, something indescribable.Everything felt very contradictory \u2014 it felt like Song Yu was publicly acknowledging their relationship, and yet it also felt like he was implicitly resisting against being defined as brothers.The dinner ended, and everyone respectively returned back to their dorms. Nan Jia said Shen Mi seemed drunk and suggested taking him back with another guy from the law faculty.\u201cLooks like that newly arrived Shen Mi might have a chance with Nan Jia,\u201d Qin Yan started to joke in a gossipy manner. \u201cI think they look quite compatible.\u201dYue Zhishi thought \u2014 it might not actually be like that.\u201cIt\u2019d be good if something happened.\u201d Song Yu spoke very quietly, his words a bit muffled.\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dYue Zhishi strolled around with Qin Yan and Song Yu. The campus was very large, and they mindlessly walked around without a destination in mind.\u201cWhere\u2019s your girlfriend?\u201dIt was already the third time Song Yu asked this question.\u201cWhy do you keep worrying about my wife?\u201d Qin Yan didn\u2019t get Song Yu\u2019s hidden meaning at all. \u201cShe went out to find a close friend today, throwing me away all by my lonesome self.\u201dPretending to sob, Qin Yan once again slipped his arm around Song Yu\u2019s shoulders. \u201cLook at how good I am. Even though you\u2019ve stood me up for so many years, I still won\u2019t abandon you and your cute little brother.\u201dYue Zhishi said, very frankly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t need you to stay with me, senior Qin Yan.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s with you?\u201d Qin Yan laughed in exasperation and said, trying to intimidate him, \u201cI\u2019m going to sell your little rock.\u201dThe three of them were almost at the campus\u2019s side entrance near the East Lake. A gust of wind rose, and humid air rushed at their faces. Qin Yan suddenly received a phone call \u2014 it seemed to be from his girlfriend. Yue Zhishi noticed that even though he usually spoke roughly and really enjoyed joking around, he always spoke particularly gently to his girlfriend, his voice soft and tender.\u201cAh, you\u2019ve gone over? Don\u2019t go by yourself, wait for me. You\u2019ll be bullied if you go by yourself. Okay, I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201dSeeing Qin Yan hang up his call, Song Yu raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat, your girlfriend going to a fight?\u201d\u201cWhat are you joking about.\u201d Qin Yan neatly put away his phone. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to live in the dorms anymore now that she\u2019s about to take the postgraduate entrance exams. Didn\u2019t I also say earlier that I needed to start preparing for internship interviews? We\u2019ve talked about renting a place outside, it\u2019ll be more convenient.\u201dYue Zhishi was very curious. \u201cAre you guys going to move in together?\u201d\u201cOf course, why would we each rent a place separately?\u201d Qin Yan smiled. \u201cShe just said she made an appointment to see a place on her way back. She liked it as soon as she saw it online. I\u2019m heading over now to go with her. Comrade Xiao Yu, sorry, but it\u2019s finally come to the time when I, your friend, am standing you up.\u201dIt was exactly what Song Yu wanted, and he asked in passing, \u201cWhich neighbourhood? Is it a nice place?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not too bad. It\u2019s a loft with two floors, and it looks quite cozy. The important thing is that she likes floor to ceiling windows so she can look out to the lake.\u201dRight before Qin Yan left, Song Yu said, \u201cTake a video, I\u2019ll watch it later.\u201d\u201cYou want to move out too?\u201d Qin Yan said, \u201cAren\u2019t you already guaranteed a postgrad spot? Everything\u2019s pretty much finalised, isn\u2019t it?\u201dYue Zhishi was a bit surprised \u2014 Song Yu had never mentioned this to him.\u201cI just want to have a look.\u201d Song Yu didn\u2019t say much else, hurriedly rushing him away.In a flash, it was only the two of them left. Yue Zhishi wanted to say something, but Song Yu\u2019s eyes gazed into the distance. \u201cLet\u2019s go over there. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve been there before.\u201dYue Zhishi was distracted as expected, and he looked towards the area Song Yu mentioned. There were quite a few people coming and going. \u201cWhat\u2019s that place?\u201d\u201cLingbo Gate.\u201dSong Yu brought Yue Zhishi over. As soon as they arrived, all they could see was a large span of rippling, undulating lake water, the view suddenly spreading right before their eyes. The sky had already darkened, the sun at the tail-end of its day, and only a dark blue sky remained, merged with lake water.Many, many narrow plank bridges interlocked each other on top of the lake right outside Lingbo Gate, the roads connecting together. Yue Zhishi pretty much immediately understood why this place was called Lingbo Gate \u2014 the rising water of the lake was separated from the bridges by only ten or so centimetres, and many students and tourists stood above, as if they were truly walking on water, taking lingering steps on the waves.\u201cLet\u2019s get on there too.\u201d He ran over, pulling Song Yu\u2019s wrist. He only realised then that the plank bridges were even narrower than he\u2019d expected; they were half a metre wide at the most, thin and long. There were also no railings built onto the planks. The planks were supported by a great deal of stone pillars plunged into the lake, each separated by half a metre, and they held up the winding and circular plank road.It was the first time Yue Zhishi walked on here, and he was a bit afraid, worried he might fall in. His two hands subconsciously stretched out, balancing himself, and he walked ahead while frequently looking back. \u201cI won\u2019t fall down, right? I haven\u2019t swam in a long time, and I\u2019ve only worn this jersey once.\u201dSure enough, he valued his life. Song Yu found him too noisy, so he caught his hand. \u201cYou won\u2019t fall.\u201dThey walked like that, one in the front and one in the back. They walked into the depths of the lake while holding hands, and Yue Zhishi paused once they reached a corner. \u201cI want to sit here.\u201dThey sat down on the plank bridge, just like many of the other people at Lingbo Gate. The sky had deepened even further, the dark blue turning into a much richer colour. The wind of September mingled with the damp smell of the lake, and it softly puffed onto their faces. Light illuminated the distant far shore of the lake, twinkling brightly and gently.Yue Zhishi swung his legs and shifted closer to Song Yu. \u201cGege, did you use to come here often?\u201dSong Yu looked into the horizon, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019ve only sat on the\u00a0bench on the shore. This is my first time on the plank bridge.\u201dThis was inconceivable to Yue Zhishi. \u201cThis place is so beautiful. How come you didn\u2019t come here before?\u201dIt was because it was so beautiful \u2014 I wanted to leave my first experience to when you arrived.It wasn\u2019t only Lingbo Gate\u2019s plank bridge. There was also the open air cinema in the\u00a0Plum Garden playground\u00a0every Friday, the slowly blooming cherry blossoms\u00a0covering each rooftop\u00a0every spring,\u00a0the archway in front of the oldest dormitory building\u00a0reflecting the sea of golden gingko trees in the distant hills, to the administrative building sports ground covered in pure white snow every winter\u2026Song Yu mutely walked past too many places by himself, never once stopping \u2014 it was like if he paused for just a little longer, these places would no longer be as beautiful the next time he came with him.Even though at that time, he had thought Yue Zhishi might not even come to this university.Song Yu was silent for a short while, and then he randomly found an excuse to dodge Yue Zhishi\u2019s question. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want to sit on the ground. It\u2019s too dirty.\u201dYue Zhishi found it very funny, despite how Song Yu\u2019s words were in line with someone obsessed with cleanliness. \u201cThen aren\u2019t you sitting on the ground now? What\u2019s the difference?\u201d\u201cThe difference is that you\u2019re here.\u201d Song Yu looked at him and said in a serious manner, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t come up here as well, how would I explain it to my mother if you fell down?\u201dThat was true.\u201cOkay.\u201d Yue Zhishi swayed his long legs. He was about to speak when a guy a few metres away jumped directly into the water from the plank road, splashing Yue Zhishi with water and startling him. He immediately wanted to get up, but Song Yu held him down.\u201cThat\u2019s very normal.\u201d Song Yu was still holding his hand. \u201cLook at how many people are swimming.\u201dOnly then then Yue Zhishi notice that there a bunch of people swimming in the lake nearby. They looked like they were playing very happily.\u201cThere are even lake jumping festivals in the spring, where people jump into the water using all kinds of methods.\u201d Song Yu focused on the lake surface, looking as though he was thinking of a memory. \u201cSome jump in with their bicycles, some go in with a springboard. There are even some couples who jump in hugging each other.\u201dUnder the faint shimmer of the lights, Yue Zhishi gazed at the side of Song Yu\u2019s face. He felt like he was speaking very gently, and so were his blank eyes \u2014 as if he\u2019d personally seen all of these, as if he\u2019d come here many times and seen all kinds of different people.He wanted to know if Song Yu came here by himself, or if he came with someone else. But as soon as Yue Zhishi imagined Song Yu sitting on the bench on the shore by himself, he felt very distressed. He wasn\u2019t really able to accept the solitary, extremely lonely image of Song Yu being himself and would feel upset for him.But it was like Yue Zhishi had no way of imagining Song Yu coming here and sitting on that bench together with someone else. He would feel distressed for himself.These contradictory emotions were like slow-acting drugs, and they corroded Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart bit by bit. He initially didn\u2019t feel them at all, but gradually, these feelings became stronger. They attacked from time to time, and they caused him to sink into negative illusions for no reason at all.\u201cSometimes you can ride a boat here.\u201d Song Yu interrupted his train of thoughts. \u201cWe can try our luck next time.\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Yue Zhishi said, \u201cIt must be really nice to watch the sunset here, right? Can we come here next time to watch the sunset? When you\u2019re not busy.\u201dSong Yu nodded.Yue Zhishi thought about Qin Yan renting a place of his own, so he said carelessly, \u201cI like looking at the lake too. The scenery here\u2019s really nice.\u201d\u201cOur house might be really big, but we can only see the greenery in our neighbourhood. It must be wonderful to be able to see the lake from the balcony.\u201dHe was very satisfied just by visualising it. Yue Zhishi looked all around him, realising there were more people at the corner of the plank bridge where the person had just jumped off. They were also two men, but they leaned against each other closer than he and Song Yu were, their heads almost laying on each other.Yue Zhishi was a bit curious, so he peeked at them for a little while longer. He noticed in shock that they were holding hands, and their fingers were even intertwined.An undefinable feeling emerged in his heart at this; the next second, where his eyes could see, the guy on the right turned his head over and kissed the person next to him very briefly. The kiss was very quick, and because of his bold action, his face was covered by a shy and lovely smile.The sky was now fully dark, the surface of the lake glistening. Those secret, concealed emotions were blown away by the wind and scattered into those glittering fragments, dissolving into the lake water.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Song Yu subconsciously followed Yue Zhishi\u2019s line of sight and looked over. He also noticed that pair of men, but he didn\u2019t say anything.Yue Zhishi turned his face around. His head lowered, the palms of his hands braced by the stones on the plank road. He uneasily swung his dangling legs. \u201cNothing.\u201dHe may have said that, but Yue Zhishi was still not used to concealing anything from Song Yu. So after two seconds, he looked over and said to Song Yu, \u201cThey kissed just now. I saw it.\u201dSong Yu wasn\u2019t as surprised as he\u2019d expected, only calmly saying, \u201cReally.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded at him. \u201cThey were even holding hands.\u201dHe realised very belatedly that the two men kissing didn\u2019t actually make him think about the video he\u2019d been accidentally forced to watch during his junior high graduation. On the contrary, he found the kiss very pure \u2014 especially the smile on the face of the guy kissing.He was so cute \u2014 he must really like his boyfriend.Seeing Yue Zhishi not speaking, Song Yu wondered if he needed to say something, but unexpectedly, Yue Zhishi asked him, \u201cGege, would you find it very weird for them to kiss?\u201dWhen he spoke, Yue Zhishi shifted the hands he\u2019d braced on the plank. The tips of his fingers touched Song Yu\u2019s \u2014 they were a bit cold. Song Yu looked at Yue Zhishi and moved his eyes away as if he was totally unconcerned. He spoke flatly, \u201cWhat\u2019s weird about it? It\u2019s nothing to do with us.\u201dIt was like he wasn\u2019t asking a question in return and was only making a simple statement.\u201cThen can you accept two guys being together?\u201dFaced with Yue Zhishi\u2019s question, Song Yu fell into a kind of deadlock \u2014 he didn\u2019t want to give any kind of guidance, and yet he also didn\u2019t want to say anything against his own heart.\u201cIt\u2019s not up to me whether I accept it or not. It\u2019s their business.\u201dHis words sounded a bit too heartless, so Song Yu added, \u201cAs long as they truly like each other, they have done nothing wrong.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Yue Zhishi softly echoed, as if he was convincing himself.Song Yu realised he had a truly unfeeling heart. The person he liked was right in front of him, and that person was asking him a question he could use to publicly reveal his hidden love. And yet he still didn\u2019t do anything \u2014 because he was an older brother.The relationship between them was like a bubble that would burst at being touched. Yue Zhishi was free to act as recklessly as he wanted, but he needed to act with great care and caution, bearing all of the consequences.He hoped he was truly a piece of obstinate rock. He would have no consciousness, and he could continue on stubbornly, without weakening.The wind cooled down, and Yue Zhishi stuck closely to Song Yu\u2019s arm. It was like he was searching for some warmth, and he once again smelled the pleasant fragrance on Song Yu\u2019s body.He didn\u2019t know when it started \u2014 he wanted to embrace Song Yu, wanted to possess his entire person. At learning that Song Yu had so many memories that he hadn\u2019t been in, Yue Zhishi would feel powerless.It was like he suffered through a serious illness. He\u2019d originally thought he could chase after someone without asking for anything in return, but he actually wasn\u2019t that generous.He needed a response \u2014 he needed a Song Yu that belonged solely, exclusively to him.This slightly pathological possessiveness was about to completely devour Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart.He had no way of continuing their conversation just now, so he sniffed and changed it to something different.\u201cGege, when\u2019s the next time you\u2019re going out for fieldwork?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked.Song Yu said he wasn\u2019t sure, and Yue Zhishi asked again if he could follow along. Song Yu refused. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit dangerous.\u201dYue Zhishi yielded very sensibly. \u201cThen you\u2019ll bring me back some stones, right?\u201dHe turned his face, looking at Song Yu. \u201cOnly for me.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d Song Yu gave him a firm promise. \u201cBut these stones are useless. You don\u2019t research them, so they\u2019re meaningless to you.\u201d\u201cThen will they be more meaningful if you give them to other people?\u201dSong Yu frowned at Yue Zhishi\u2019s abrupt question. \u201cWhy are you asking that?\u201dYue Zhishi wasn\u2019t able to respond and didn\u2019t give him an answer.He suddenly felt a deep sense of insecurity in each and every area. He was frightened \u2014 someone who might make Song Yu care more for them might appear, and then he\u2019ll no longer have his position in Song Yu\u2019s life. He was even more frightened of Song Yu suddenly disappearing one day and never coming back.\u201cI just don\u2019t want you to give things to other people. Is that okay?\u201dSong Yu keenly sensed the change in Yue Zhishi, so his heart softened very quickly. He raised his hand, lightly stroking the top of Yue Zhishi\u2019s head. \u201cOkay.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to disappoint Yue Zhishi. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to find different mementos for you. They might not be worth so much every time, so don\u2019t expect too much.\u201dYue Zhishi pulled out the turquoise Song Yu had given him, lowering his head to stare at that sliced and glowing, blue side. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll be really happy no matter what you give me.\u201dThese gifts that crossed mountains and rivers \u2014 he\u2019ll safely guard all of them.\u201cWhy?\u201d Song Yu abruptly wanted to ask, so he blurted out the question.This time, Yue Zhishi was very honest. \u201cBecause if I know you\u2019ll give me a present once you come back, it\u2019ll be easier for me to accept you leaving.\u201dHearing those words, only then did Song Yu understand.Yue Zhishi had actually heard the things Qin Yan had said at the dinner table, the jokes about him learning how to rock climb in case of accidents. He\u2019d only pretended he didn\u2019t hear, pretending he was focusing on eating; he didn\u2019t want them to feel awkward around the dinner table because of him.Song Yu also suddenly realised \u2014 in fact, Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t as absent-minded or as easy to trick as he\u2019d thought.It had been a long time since he\u2019d been a child who didn\u2019t understand anything.\u201cGege.\u201d His voice dropped. \u201cYou can go to very far away places, or very dangerous places, if you really want.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s hand was clenched so tightly. It wasn\u2019t that he must have mementos \u2014 he wasn\u2019t that childish. Even if someone who might give more meaning to those stones truly appeared, that was fine too.\u201cBut you can\u2019t forget \u2014 I\u2019m still waiting for your present.\u201dYue Zhishi only wanted one promise from Song Yu, one habit, that would make him remember to protect himself every single moment. Remember that there was someone waiting for him.He looked at Song Yu, the lakeside wind blowing high the hair on his forehead and exposing his beautiful features. He opened his mouth, the tone of his voice a rarely heard calm.\u201cI was too young back then, and I had no way to hold them back. They never returned after they left, and I had no choice but to accept it. But I\u2019m older now. I don\u2019t want to accept anything like that again.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t leave me. Don\u2019t leave me by myself,\u201d Yue Zhishi said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He restrained himself and hugged him with a very, very light strength, so that the embrace looked more like he was comforting him \u2014 and not possessing him.\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Song Yu caressed Yue Zhishi\u2019s nape, his voice a bit husky. \u201cSomething like that won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Song Yu was already smart enough, but he couldn\u2019t understand how he could get Yue Zhishi to understand he actually really cared about him and actually didn\u2019t want to leave him at all. His feelings were like the tip of iceberg: he could only show one ten-thousandth of his feelings. Only then could he continue acting normally as an older brother should.But he found it harder and harder to regulate his emotions. He wanted Yue Zhishi to understand how important he was to him, and yet he wasn\u2019t willing to expose his true desires to him. He borrowed Yue Zhishi\u2019s trust and reliance towards him to satisfy his own narrow-minded possessiveness.\u201cI will do everything I promised you.\u201dYue Zhishi quietly let Song Yu hug him. He didn\u2019t cry, didn\u2019t respond and was even more silent than the lake water. Song Yu felt a bit uneasy at this, as if Yue Zhishi thought the words he\u2019d spoken were no longer useful \u2014 as if he would no longer ask him again and again like when he was a child, \u201cReally? You promise.\u201dNow that Yue Zhishi was grown up, Song Yu was a bit scared he wouldn\u2019t need his promises anymore.But at the end, Yue Zhishi still lifted his hands and gently grabbed onto Song Yu\u2019s clothes at the small of his back. Even though the wrinkles on his clothes could disappear at any time after this mutual embrace ended, not leaving behind a shred of evidence, Song Yu was still slightly consoled by this.Noticing Yue Zhishi\u2019s arms were a bit cold, Song Yu suggested taking him back. They walked on the plank road timidly, as if they were treading on thin ice, and yet they clutched each other\u2019s hands tightly. Once they arrived back to the shore, they returned once again to a safe distance from each other.Yue Zhishi had already recovered by the time they stood underneath his dorm building. It was like he\u2019d already forgotten what they just spoke about, and he started smiling to Song Yu again. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to basketball training, can you tell me ahead of time? I want to train with you.\u201dSong Yu nodded in agreement, and then he raised a hand to touch Yue Zhishi\u2019s face, once again caressing Yue Zhishi\u2019s nape for a little while.These movements exceeded Yue Zhishi\u2019s expectations. They made him feel like a little puppy who\u2019d been given extra snacks; his heart very much liked them, but he didn\u2019t dare move. He was even more shaken after he left Song Yu and went upstairs \u2014 to the point that he silently said to Song Yu in his heart in distress and out of spite,\u00a0don\u2019t touch me like that again.But he wanted him to; he liked it.When he reached the fourth floor, Yue Zhishi suddenly heard someone call his name. He saw Shen Mi once he lifted his head, and he was standing next to the windows in the corridor.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Yue Zhishi remembered he was drunk and asked again, \u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201dShen Mi chuckled and answered his second question first. \u201cI didn\u2019t drink that much. I\u2019m just a bit red, I\u2019m not actually drunk.\u201d He then said quickly, \u201cI sent you some messages after I got back. Since you weren\u2019t replying, I came over by myself. I waited for you for a while, but since you weren\u2019t back yet, I was getting ready to leave. I didn\u2019t expect you to come back now.\u201dYue Zhishi gave him a smile too. \u201cI was walking around campus with my ge.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Shen Mi spoke a bit too quickly.Yue Zhishi originally wanted to ask if he wanted anything else, but he felt asking something like that wasn\u2019t too nice. So he extended out an invitation: \u201cDo you still want to come and hang around?\u201dUnlike usual, Shen Mi refused. \u201cNo, it\u2019s late. You should go rest. I just wanted to check on you, in case you weren\u2019t happy about tonight.\u201d He then said, consoling, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry because of someone like that. There\u2019s no need.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded. \u201cI know, don\u2019t worry.\u201d He stood in the corridor, watching Shen Mi leave, and waited for him to reach outside. He could see his receding figure enter the building next door from the window.Yue Zhishi was still caged by that feeling of insecurity. In the past, once he\u2019d received Song Yu\u2019s promise, his symptoms would ease; this time, they didn\u2019t. Song Yu had clearly given him his word, but it didn\u2019t help him at all.Yue Zhishi felt very helpless.Everything Song Yu promised, he truly did, including bringing Yue Zhishi to training. Even if he really was very busy, he\u2019d still accompany Yue Zhishi at least twice a week. He once arrived still wearing his glasses. Song Yu would usually leave his glasses at his seat in the research lab in case he lost them, because he only wore them when he was either studying or working. But he didn\u2019t even realise he was still wearing them this time, and he was even wearing a white button down shirt that was unsuited for basketball.At that time, Yue Zhishi was about to shoot a three-pointer. The court he just happened to be in faced the entrance of the gymnasium, so when he saw Song Yu come in, the trajectory of the ball went crooked. He\u2019d thought it would definitely go in, and yet his shot turned into a very absurd airball.Yue Zhishi thought it was a bit embarrassing, but Song Yu looked so nice wearing his white button down shirt and his glasses. The two feelings collided, and he forgot what he was doing, only foolishly saying to Song Yu, \u201cWouldn\u2019t your glasses fall off if you wear them playing ball.\u201d He rapidly realised his question was very silly, so he added, \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t, your nose bridge is really high.\u201dSong Yu reached up a hand to touch his glasses, and he only then realised what had felt different. He didn\u2019t say he had just come from an unexpected meeting; he merely said he could see clearer with his glasses and didn\u2019t take them off.He was always like this \u2014 using lies neither too big or too small to cover up the thoughts he\u2019d thought wouldn\u2019t hurt or itch at his heart. Yue Zhishi wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference, anyway.Bumping into Shen Mi during training was unavoidable. Song Yu had held a large prejudice against Shen Mi in the beginning. He\u2019d very keenly sensed the good feelings Shen Mi held towards Yue Zhishi, as well as his extremely strong desire to show off to him. Song Yu had always felt that the majority of the people who liked Yue Zhishi usually only liked his outer appearance, or maybe they thought he was a kind and innocent person who was very easy to approach. But after interacting with him, Song Yu realised Shen Mi truly did treat Yue Zhishi very well \u2014 he was just too childish and wasn\u2019t able to hide his feelings at all.There were a few times when Song Yu had hugged Yue Zhishi from behind, teaching him how to shoot. When Shen Mi saw them, his hand movements would freeze, and then he\u2019d continue acting as if nothing had happened, continuing to train with other people.Other than him, everyone else was even less likely to find Song Yu and Yue Zhishi\u2019s overly close actions strange. Everyone silently saw them as brothers who\u2019d grown up together.The people in the basketball team wouldn\u2019t joke about Yue Zhishi and Song Yu, but they had still yet to cure their old habit of discussing Song Yu and Nan Jia, despite Nan Jia sternly refuting them every time and Song Yu directly walking away. Sometimes, Yue Zhishi would also be very curious \u2014 just exactly where did they think them so well-matched?Whenever he thought about this, he would look towards Nan Jia. She was very beautiful, and despite her exquisite face, she didn\u2019t have any airs at all. Her warmth and gentleness basked others like a soft spring breeze, and yet her strength was convincing and believable, not discordant at all. She and Song Yu would sometimes accidentally stand together, and they truly did look beautiful together.After observing and pondering over it for a while, it felt like Yue Zhishi also started to gradually believe this as fact.They truly complemented each other very well.His moods lately were like the unstable temperatures in September \u2014 it would be hot enough to wear short sleeves one day, and yet the temperature would suddenly drop the next day, catching people by surprise.Yue Zhishi wore the wrong clothes twice, running back to his dorm after a class to grab a jacket. After doing so a number of times, he fell slightly sick, and it felt like he had fallen into a vicious cycle, his cold aggravating the heavy weight on his emotions.Two weeks had clearly already passed since they\u2019d had their late night chat at Lingbo Gate, and yet he still hadn\u2019t made much progress.His afternoon course started pretty late, and Yue Zhishi was pulled by the seniors in the main basketball team to eat lunch together in the cafeteria. Song Yu, Qin Yan and Nan Jia were all not present, so he sat next to Shen Mi, his left side filled by another cheerful senior. They chatted about NBA competitions and gossip from other faculties. Yue Zhishi was somewhat distracted. His course that afternoon was very difficult; he hadn\u2019t been able to fully follow along in the last few classes, and most importantly, the professor didn\u2019t provide course notes. He wanted to buy a cup of coffee after lunch so he could be a bit more awake during class.\u201cHey, Le Le, I have a question for you.\u201dThe senior sitting next to him interrupted Yue Zhishi\u2019s worries. He lifted his head, earnestly looking at the senior\u2019s face. \u201cSure, what is it?\u201d\u201cHas your brother really not dated before?\u201d\u00a0He looked extremely curious. \u201cA guy like him should have heaps of people chasing after him.\u201d\u201cHe hasn\u2019t,\u201d Yue Zhishi replied. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be very interested in dating.\u201dThe senior sitting across from him laughed. \u201cThe key thing is that most high schoolers dating early also wouldn\u2019t tell their younger brothers.\u201d\u201cTrue.\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head. \u201cHe really hasn\u2019t. There\u2019s never been a girl who\u2019s gotten close to him.\u201d\u201cReally? We really can\u2019t understand the world of a university tyrant. I hear his entrance exams score was fucking high, so him running over to study a painful major like geomatics is amazing.\u201d\u201cHe really likes this field.\u201d Yue Zhishi stressed, \u201cIt\u2019s very good as long as he likes it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so good to your brother. It would be nice if I had a little brother like you, I\u2019d steal some fame just by showing you off.\u201d The senior chuckled and gave Yue Zhishi some of his own\u00a0stir-fried noodles with squid. \u201cHave some.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t want to say he couldn\u2019t eat it, but Shen Mi moved swiftly and quickly took the noodles from his bowl once the senior wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201cHey, then let me ask you something else.\u201d The senior looked at Yue Zhishi again. \u201cHave you thought about what kind of sister-in-law you\u2019ll have in the future?\u201dThe other guys all unintentionally cracked up at the same time, their laughter coming across a bit strangely.Yue Zhishi shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cSeriously?\u201d A senior sitting diagonally across from him chortled and said, \u201cI always look a few extra times every time my brother brings home his girlfriend.\u201d\u201cTsk tsk, Old Zhang, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re that kind of person!\u201d\u201cHey, who doesn\u2019t like sister-in-laws!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not lead our juniors astray, okay.\u201d The senior sitting across from him looked at Yue Zhishi. \u201cSince you really haven\u2019t thought of it before, then what about\u2026\u201d He pondered for a bit, and then looking as if he thought of a good option: \u201cJust as an example. If senior Nan Jia became your sister-in-law, would you be happy?\u201dYue Zhishi watched him in silence. He didn\u2019t respond for a long time, and then he suddenly started coughing. His coughs became worse the longer they went on, and it seemed like he couldn\u2019t stop.\u201cSenior, you guys are so gossipy,\u201d Shen Mi said. \u201cSenior Nan Jia will definitely be angry again if she heard about this.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re just joking, it\u2019s too boring to just sit in silence while we eat.\u201d\u201cRumours like these better not be true. An enemy like Song Yu is too strong \u2014 I still have a chance as long as it\u2019s not him.\u201d\u201cAs if you have a chance!\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s stomach was slightly hurting, his palms covered by a thin layer of sweat. It felt like a stress reaction from the sudden changes in his moods. Doctors had told him since he was a child: even if his asthma was triggered by his allergy, he still needed to pay attention to his emotions. He needed to prevent falling sick as much as possible and maintain a cheerful mood; that was the best way he could minimise his risk of suffering from an attack. He had always been an obedient child, and he\u2019d always requested all this from himself.But now, it became harder and harder for him to control his own emotions \u2014 just like how he couldn\u2019t control his own breathing when he was suffering from an allergic attack.After they finished lunch, Shen Mi said he needed to pick up a delivery and asked Yue Zhishi to go with him. Yue Zhishi naturally didn\u2019t refuse, and they separated from their seniors that way. Shen Mi actually didn\u2019t have something he needed to pick up. He brought Yue Zhishi into a convenience store, buying him a hot milk tea.\u201cI\u2019ll treat you to this. All the girls say this is really yummy,\u201d Shen Mi said.Yue Zhishi thanked him. \u201cYou keep treating me to food.\u201dShen Mi laughed. \u201cThe way you look when you\u2019re eating can really cheer people up.\u201dYue Zhishi said thank you again, and the two of them sat on the bar stools, drinking their milk teas. Shen Mi chattered a lot about some amusing things he\u2019d encountered recently, and Yue Zhishi quietly listened to him, occasionally breaking into laughter. As they left the convenience store, Yue Zhishi asked Shen Mi, \u201cDo you think senior Nan Jia and my ge are compatible?\u201dShen Mi focused on him for two seconds, and then he let out a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s not up to me to say.\u201d\u201cThen who does?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not up to anyone to say.\u201d Shen Mi smiled. \u201cI can even say we\u2019re the best of friends, but that\u2019s just lips flapping around.\u201dYue Zhishi fell silent, and then he said after a little while, \u201cYou\u2019re a good friend of mine.\u201dShen Mi didn\u2019t comment or respond to his words, but he went with Yue Zhishi the entire way to his classroom entrance, patting his shoulder before he left. \u201cLe Le, don\u2019t think about useless things and end up hurting yourself. Cheer up.\u201dShen Mi\u2019s words were always really reasonable, but Yue Zhishi always never truly understood them.Before his class started, Yue Zhishi sat in the lecture theatre and looked through his previous notes again. He didn\u2019t want to fall behind, and he was consistently able to calm down whenever he focused on his studies. It was almost time to start the class, and more students arrived \u2014 Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t even notice them until the class bell rang, and he came back to attention, lifting his head.Except it wasn\u2019t the fussy old professor standing at the podium. It was Nan Jia.Though the microphone, Nan Jia\u2019s voice was slightly stricter than usual. \u201cProfessor Wang\u2019s attending a seminar today, so he\u2019s not able to lecture. My name is Nan Jia, his assistant, and I\u2019ll be taking you guys through some real life cases. We\u2019ll also review some of the course\u2019s previous content. You can take today as a question and review session.\u201dShe looked at the roster in her hands and decided to place it down. \u201cI won\u2019t call names. Everyone should know what to do.\u201dA guy joked, \u201cGood thing I came today, we\u2019re getting two things for the price of one.\u201dAll the other students started to laugh, including Yue Zhishi.He realised he couldn\u2019t hate Nan Jia no matter how hard he tried.Nan Jia\u2019s grades had always been at the top, and she was very capable, helping them sort through all of the previous course content and completely taking them through the flow of logic. Yue Zhishi felt like he finally understood some of the coursework he previously hadn\u2019t understood, and some of the previously hard to memorise points were now easily digested.Nan Jia wore a smile the entire time she led the class. Many students greeted her before they left, and she replied to every single one of them. Yue Zhishi packed up his bag, walking over. \u201cSenior.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think, were you surprised when you saw me?\u201d Nan Jia unplugged her USB, following him out. \u201cWhy do you look so tired? Let me buy you some coffee. There\u2019s a decent automatic coffee machine around the corner of this floor. Have you tried it?\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head. He said this course was a bit hard, and he was a bit sick, so he wasn\u2019t feeling very energetic.\u201cAh, I was the same when I was taking this course. My head was always floating around in the clouds.\u201d She whispered to Yue Zhishi, \u201cThis professor is really amazing, but he\u2019s not great at teaching. I have his course notes from before. There\u2019s been some slight changes since then, but they should be roughly the same content as now. Do you need them?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Yue Zhishi cheered up and then complained, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give course notes anymore.\u201dNan Jia took him to the automatic coffee machine around the corner and bought him a caramel macchiato, saying this was the nicest flavour \u2014 it had a very rich, nutty taste.\u201cWe don\u2019t have time today, but next time I\u2019ll take you to try some freshly ground coffee.\u201dAs they spoke, a girl walked by and called out Nan Jia\u2019s name from far away. \u201cHow come you\u2019re here!\u201dNan Jia looked over. \u201cYueyue.\u201d She showed her the cup of coffee in her hands. \u201cI just finished my teaching assistant class. I\u2019m just perking my junior and myself up with some coffee. You said our dorm was leaking water during lunchtime \u2014 has it been fixed?\u201dYue Zhishi looked at the senior called Yueyue and guessed they were dorm mates. They seemed very close. She walked over and also gave Yue Zhishi a friendly greeting. \u201cI know you, you\u2019re Yue Zhishi, right? You\u2019re Song Yu\u2019s brother.\u201d\u201cHi, senior.\u201d\u201cHello, hello. You\u2019re too famous, you became our law faculty\u2019s faculty grass as soon as you came in. So many people are talking about you.\u201d She was very bright and cheerful, her face filled with animation as she spoke.Yue Zhishi shook his head in embarrassment, not knowing how to continue the conversation.Yueyue stared at Yue Zhishi and then looked back at Nan Jia, giving him a meaningful look. \u201cHey, you have a pretty good relationship with Song Yu\u2019s brother. Are you planning something?\u201dNan Jia frowned. \u201cWhat nonsense are you saying? This has nothing to do with anything.\u201d\u201cWhy are you holding back for, seriously.\u201d She smiled at Yue Zhishi again. \u201cLet me tell you a secret. Your senior Nan Jia has liked your brother since first year.\u201dA small dull pain flared in Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart. He opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but she spoke before he could.\u201cYou should help out your senior sister.\u201dWithout waiting for Yue Zhishi to react, Nan Jia found an excuse to leave her dorm mate behind and pulled Yue Zhishi away.They came out of the classroom building to sit on a bench in the little garden behind the building. During this time, Nan Jia kept saying to Yue Zhishi, \u201cMy dorm mate\u2019s quite careless with the way she speaks. Don\u2019t take her seriously, everything she said were just jokes.\u201dYue Zhishi sat down as well. The coffee in his hand had now cooled down a bit, and he could finally drink it.He didn\u2019t drink much, but the caffeine worked faster than he\u2019d expected \u2014 his fingers started to slightly tremble. Yue Zhishi was a bit cold \u2014 maybe he wasn\u2019t wearing enough clothing.Nan Jia said she had never able to avoid being teased. Not only just about Song Yu, but also about other people. She started to laugh as she spoke. \u201cThere are even some people joking about you and me. Isn\u2019t that really funny?\u201dThe way she explained it seemed to confirm their jokes.Yue Zhishi raised his eyes, shifting his gaze to Nan Jia. \u201cSenior, do you truly like my ge?\u201dNan Jia quieted down and then sat next to Yue Zhishi. She looked down at her cup of coffee, head lowered, and spoke only after a long while passed. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve liked him since first year. But\u2026\u201dShe lifted her head and looked at Yue Zhishi. \u201cLe Le, I don\u2019t need you to help me.\u201dYue Zhishi wrinkled his eyebrows. \u201cReally?\u201d He even smiled uncontrollably at Nan Jia, saying words even he thought were very fake. \u201cI can help you. I used to help people give him love letters and deal with girls who looked for me after they couldn\u2019t add his contact details. This is nothing.\u201dHe wanted to say,\u00a0if it\u2019s you, I\u2019ll be even more delighted, but Yue Zhishi, at the end, wasn\u2019t able to say it.He found himself even slightly enjoying the feeling of hurting himself \u2014 as though he wouldn\u2019t feel so lost if he was in a bit more pain.Nan Jia tilted her head over and smiled at Yue Zhishi. \u201cThe reason why I said I didn\u2019t need your help is because I\u2019m slowly giving up right now. This has always been an unrequited love. Other than my own emotional investment, I actually haven\u2019t put in anything. I liked him by myself, and now I\u2019m giving up by myself \u2014 from the beginning to the end, nothing will affect Song Yu and other people.\u201dYue Zhishi couldn\u2019t understand. \u201cGive up?\u201dHe felt like giving up Song Yu was the hardest thing to do in the world.\u201cCan you really give him up?\u201dNan Jia gazed at his eyes, her voice relaxed. \u201cDoes it sound shameful to give up? But actually, I had my own considerations when I made this decision.\u201dHer finger lightly tapped on the paper cup. \u201cTo me, there are two things I should judge when deciding to give up on someone. One: how likely is he to accept me? Two: the \u2018like\u2019 I have for him \u2014 is it worth me spending a large amount of time and effort to force him to like me back?\u201dSeeing Yue Zhishi a bit bewildered, Nan Jia smiled and explained, \u201cLet me talk about my first point. I can clearly sense Song Yu doesn\u2019t like me; he has absolutely no interest in me at all. It\u2019s already very hard just with this. Then, I need to consider my second point. There\u2019s nothing wrong with me liking him, but just for this \u2018like\u2019 \u2014 should I waste my energy, giving up my every day life, just to eagerly chase after him like in one of those idol dramas? Will he respond to me and like me back just by me doing so?\u201dThe wind blew, a leaf drifting onto Nan Jia\u2019s long skirt. She didn\u2019t brush it away. \u201cYou know, so many people think once a girl likes someone, she\u2019ll lose all her reason. They think she\u2019ll like someone to the point she\u2019ll give up herself. But I don\u2019t think I can do that \u2014 there are too many things I want to do, too many goals I want to reach.\u201d\u201cSo you think if there isn\u2019t much hope for something, we can choose to give it up, right?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked.\u201cNo. Rather than putting it that way, it\u2019s more that if I have to choose between him or me, I chose myself.\u201d Nan Jia gazed at him. \u201cCompared to liking him, I love myself more. I don\u2019t want to give myself up, so I\u2019m giving up Song Yu.\u201dYue Zhishi found Nan Jia very clear-headed. She was very similar to Song Yu in that sense, but she was even more unwavering and steadfast than Song Yu.\u201cSenior Nan Jia, you\u2019re truly amazing.\u201d He sounded a bit envious and yet also very sincere. \u201cTo be able to make a decision so rationally.\u201dNan Jia smiled wryly. \u201cWho wants to remain level-headed when it comes to feelings? It\u2019s just because I haven\u2019t received any special treatment.\u201dShe took a sip of coffee. \u201cActually, I vaguely feel like Song Yu has someone he likes. It might be an unreliable gut feeling.\u201dThis slightly upset Yue Zhishi. His hand braced against the bench, his nose a bit blocked, and it felt like his cold suddenly worsened. He pretended to look curious, lightly asking, \u201cReally? Who do you think it is?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t know, then I definitely won\u2019t know.\u201d Nan Jia laughed, but after a moment, the smile on her face gradually ebbed away. \u201cI just feel like, there are so many times Song Yu would do something to distract himself \u2014 like the basketball shooting I talked about last time. Sometimes he\u2019d daze off, as if he\u2019s thinking of someone. Girls are very sensitive to these things, we can sense it.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s heart felt very complicated. When Nan Jia admitted she truly liked Song Yu, he felt very miserable, as though they were about to get together and Song Yu was about to leave him. But when Nan Jia said she was giving up, Yue Zhishi suddenly felt a sense of relief even he himself found despicable. He\u2019d visibly relaxed.But now, he changed again: he impatiently, eagerly wanted to know if Song Yu really had someone he liked, and if he did, who that person was.It was awful \u2014 Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t wait even for one moment. No matter how he tried to convince himself, this way of thinking was truly unhealthy. It was abnormal, and it definitely wasn\u2019t something a little brother should have.\u201cLe Le, don\u2019t tell your brother any of the things I\u2019ve told you.\u201d Nan Jia pleaded with him with her eyes. \u201cI just wanted to explain to you so things don\u2019t get more troublesome in the future. Besides, if he knew, he might find it awkward.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d Nan Jia released a breath, patting Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAll of the things I said about love \u2014 they were all directed to myself. I\u2019m very selfish, always calculating about how much I\u2019ve invested and how much I\u2019ll get back in return. And plus, I can feel that the other person\u2019s heart belongs to someone else. But\u2014\u2014\u201dHer voice turned solemn and filled with encouragement. \u201cIf you meet someone you like, don\u2019t be like me. If you truly really like that person, you should be brave.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know why, but Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes suddenly started to burn. \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. Who knows, that person might be carrying the same feelings for you. It would be a pity to miss each other.\u201d Nan Jia raised her head, looking up towards the clouds in the sky, and said to herself, \u201cSong Yu is a really good person, but I\u2019m not bad either. I\u2019ll definitely meet someone who\u2019ll make me overlook the cost versus the return, someone who\u2019ll give me a reply.\u201dYue Zhishi looked at the side of Nan Jia\u2019s face, hesitating. In his heart, Nan Jia was someone who could help him push away his foggy confusion. She was clear-headed yet sincere, and Yue Zhishi subconsciously trusted her.Or maybe he truly had nowhere else to turn and chose Nan Jia without noticing. From her, he hoped he could find a lifeline, or maybe a knife to sever his thoughts.\u201cSenior.\u201dNan Jia looked back. \u201cHm?\u201dYue Zhishi frowned, his voice very soft. \u201cThe feelings you have towards someone \u2014 how can you tell if it\u2019s \u2018like\u2019 or something else?\u201dSeeing Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes, Nan Jia was silent for two seconds, and then she used a not too relaxed but very calm voice to answer, \u201cLe Le, if the feelings you hold for someone is something else, you\u2019ll find that person very, very good. You\u2019ll be very happy and feel very warm as soon as you see them, as soon as you think of them.\u201d\u201cThat which makes you feel uncontrollable pain \u2014 only then is that\u00a0like.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 55: InevitableAfter he separated from Nan Jia, Yue Zhishi completely forgot to eat dinner, muddling his way back to his dorm in a blur.It just happened to be dinner time, so there was no one in the dorm. Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes really hurt, and he had no energy at all \u2014 he felt dizzy and utterly weak, and he planned to sleep after taking a hot shower. But his luck and his physical condition seemed to line up: he\u2019d only finished showered halfway when the dorm\u2019s hot water heater suddenly broke, only ice-cold water coming out no matter how he tried to adjust the gauge. With no other choice, Yue Zhishi could only rush through the rest of his shower, drying off and putting on his clothes before going out.Song Yu sent Yue Zhishi two messages in the meantime. The first one was to tell him he\u2019d been called away to do a surface survey and wouldn\u2019t be able to train with Yue Zhishi after dinner; the second one asked where he was.Yue Zhishi\u2019s teeth were chattering from the cold by the time he wrapped himself into his blanket. He typed out \u2018sleeping in the dorm\u2019 with shaking hands and then turned on his phone\u2019s do not disturb mode.He didn\u2019t know how long he actually slept. His dreams were extraordinarily fragile, and he\u2019d wake as soon as he moved. He passed back out very quickly after waking up, so his dreams were broken bits and pieces, all of them memories from his childhood and every single one of them related to Song Yu. Whether he was in his dreams or in reality, he was still the one chasing \u2014 chasing until he fell down. But every time, Song Yu would turn around and wait for him. Except for the last time.Song Yu walked away without looking back, his shadows of his receding figure disappearing rapidly. His surroundings melted and trickled down, the scene monstrous and bizarre, and everything was dyed red, turning into boiling, viscous lava that wrapped around Yue Zhishi. He couldn\u2019t breathe and had nowhere to escape.When he was about to suffocate, Yue Zhishi woke up as if in self-protection. It felt like there was someone calling his name from below his bed, but he couldn\u2019t lift up his eyelids at all \u2014 he could only feel his swollen and painful eyes and the extreme aching in his bones. He used some effort to turn over, mumbling out a response from inside his blanket.He seemed to hear Jiang Yufan and Shen Mi\u2019s voices. Jiang Yufan said he needed to go out and asked Shen Mi for help, but these sounds seemed to reach Yue Zhishi through a wall and didn\u2019t seem real at all. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t feel anything concrete until Shen Mi and Jiang Yufan pooled their strength together and brought him down from his bed.Pain \u2014 it was everywhere.Jiang Yufan pulled a long woollen knit over Yue Zhishi. Thinking Yue Zhishi\u2019s legs might be too weak, he asked, \u201cLe Le, do you think you can walk?\u201dYue Zhishi heard him clearly and nodded, his voice feeble. \u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk anymore. How can you be fine when you\u2019re burning up so badly?\u201d The sound of Shen Mi\u2019s voice was a bit high, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart shook as he listened. He didn\u2019t say anything to contradict him, but he very stubbornly insisted on walking by himself. The other two people had no choice but to hold him up and support him down the building. By the time they were walking on the stairs, Jiang Yufan clearly felt Yue Zhishi drifting back into unconsciousness.So when they came out of the building, Jiang Yufan immediately called a taxi \u2014 but his teacher called him, asking where he was, and he had to leave. \u201cShen Mi, I really have to go. Are you going to be okay by yourself?\u201d\u201cYeah. You should go, I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go look for you guys at the hospital once I\u2019m done.\u201dAt the end, only two of them remained, and the wind under the dormitory building seemed to blow Yue Zhishi a bit more awake. He mumbled that he didn\u2019t want to go to the hospital, that he didn\u2019t like the hospital, and Shen Mi patiently tried to persuade him before he finally pulled Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm over, wanting to carry him on his back. But Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t willing to get on; he knew Shen Mi was going to take him to the hospital.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go, I hate going to the hospital.\u201d Yue Zhishi spoke with great difficulty, and he kept repeating it over and over, his words disjointed and muddled.Shen Mi stopped caring that he refused to go and directly pulled him over to forcefully get him on his back.But very soon, blinding high beams stopped his movements. Shen Mi looked over, frowning, and realised a black car was coming closer. He could guess who the person in the car was, and it was exactly who he expected.Song Yu came out of the car, his steps very swift. Shen Mi\u2019s actions stiffened, and he placed down Yue Zhishi, keeping hold of his wrist. Yue Zhishi looked completely unwilling \u2014 unwilling to go to the hospital \u2014 but in Song Yu\u2019s eyes, the reason for his unwillingness turned into something else.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dEven though Shen Mi gripped onto Yue Zhishi very tightly, Song Yu was still able to bring Yue Zhishi over in one motion.Yue Zhishi had clearly been so insistent just then, but it was like he gave up the moment he heard Song Yu\u2019s voice. He leaned against Song Yu\u2019s body.As their skin came into contact with each other, Song Yu only then realised something was wrong with Yue Zhishi. He lifted a hand to touch Yue Zhishi\u2019s forehead and then looked at Shen Mi.Shen Mi\u2019s face was steady and calm. \u201cHe\u2019s sick. I was going to take him to the hospital. It\u2019s that simple.\u201dSong Yu stared at him and said thank you after a few seconds. \u201cHe has a terrible temper when he\u2019s sick. You won\u2019t be able to handle it. I\u2019ll drive him over.\u201d He lifted up the half conscious Yue Zhishi horizontally, carrying him into the car, and closed the passenger seat\u2019s door.He turned around and saw Shen Mi who\u2019d subconsciously followed over. He felt apologetic for misunderstanding him, and Song Yu\u2019s voice gentled slightly. \u201cYou should head back to your dorm, I\u2019ll contact you on WeChat if anything happens.\u201dBut for some reason \u2014 maybe because of that sentence, or maybe because of the sentence before \u2014 Shen Mi was unexpectedly infuriated. The hands he\u2019d left next to his body tightened into fists, and he glared at Song Yu from half a metre away. He said, using a moderately loud voice, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you directly. I like Yue Zhishi.\u201dSong Yu wasn\u2019t surprised. He turned his head over to double check if Yue Zhishi was still sleeping, and then he twisted back around to continue confronting Shen Mi.\u201cI really liked him from the first time I saw him on the bus. That\u2019s why I ran after him in the rain to return his phone, and that\u2019s why I actively requested to transfer classes. Yue Zhishi looks like he\u2019s really easy to get close to, but he actually doesn\u2019t open his heart very easily. So I\u2019ve been working hard, hoping to get a bit more space in his heart. Do you understand how that feels?\u201dSong Yu listened to Shen Mi speak very solemnly. He thought if Yue Zhishi heard these words, he might\u2019ve been very touched \u2014 but unfortunately, he was Song Yu.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point in you telling me all this?\u201dShen Mi laughed, as if he was extremely unsatisfied with Song Yu\u2019s attitude of ignoring everything he said. \u201cYou can continue pretending. To be honest, I\u2019ve felt like you and I were the same since the first time I saw you. We\u2019re both people with ulterior motives, so why don\u2019t we reveal our cards and fight fairly. There\u2019s no need for you to act like you have a higher identity than me \u2014 it\u2019s not like your feelings are more important than mine.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your identity, a friend? A classmate?\u201d Song Yu looked at him indifferently, and then bluntly lay bare Shen Mi\u2019s thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019re just using that as a pretence to continue getting closer to the person you want to approach.\u201dShen Mi bitterly smiled. \u201cThen what about you?\u201dSong Yu stared at his eyes.Shen Mi dropped his gaze briefly and then fearlessly looked at him again. \u201cBy relying on your identity as his older brother, by relying on the emotional foundation you\u2019ve accumulated over so many years, you do so many ambiguous, boundary-crossing things to Yue Zhishi. You enjoy how he worships you and how he\u2019s unwilling to leave you, and yet you\u2019re not willing to break through the layer between the two of you with your own hands. Song Yu, have you seen it when Yue Zhishi\u2019s unhappy? Have you seen how your actions have affected him? Do you know about the distress and pain he feels because of you? Or are you pretending to not know?\u201d\u201cSong Yu, just exactly how are you better than me?\u201dSeeing Song Yu not say a single word, Shen Mi thought this was useless. There was no point in a one-sided provocation, and there was also no point in exposing the truth like this. He went around Song Yu\u2019s shoulder to glance at Yue Zhishi; his head curved onto the car window, his face unclear.He pushed down his emotions, finally saying to Song Yu, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking, and I\u2019m not bothered enough to care. Song Yu, you can either sincerely be a good older brother with clear boundaries, or you can just give up your lofty, respectable identity. I can\u2019t see you being able to continue with it anyway.\u201dUp until Shen Mi left and entered into another dormitory building, Song Yu didn\u2019t speak. He felt extremely unwell \u2014 he\u2019d been bound with this \u2018older brother\u2019 identity since he was six years old, and it didn\u2019t matter if he wanted it or not. The identity had already become a layer of his skin attached onto his body.Shen Mi\u2019s words were like a knife, sharply cutting off this fake layer of skin. Song Yu had no choice but to face the bloody and mutilated truth.He truly did want to continue drifting along, leaving things alone.By the time he returned back to his car, Song Yu was still unable to calm down his emotions. He drove towards the hospital, the car moving very quickly, and he distantly had a very scary thought. He might actually be willing for another car to suddenly appear and crash into him \u2014 after all, Yue Zhishi was here.But this thought lasted for only a second. He rapidly lowered the car\u2019s speed and forced himself to continue driving calmly, arriving safely at the hospital. He once again carried Yue Zhishi up, and he realised he was lighter than he\u2019d imagined. There were many people in the emergency room, and Yue Zhishi rested against Song Yu as he sat in the seats in the corridor. He\u2019d occasionally open his eyes to look around before he closed them again in pain.When it came time for Yue Zhishi\u2019s turn, he suddenly recovered a bit of energy. He\u2019d clearly not been willing to come, and yet he cooperated with the doctor very well as he faced him.\u201cThe fever\u2019s at 39.4 degrees.\u201d The doctor spoke flatly, telling them they should\u2019ve come earlier. Song Yu was even more remorseful; he didn\u2019t even know Yue Zhishi had a cold.Yue Zhishi had changed \u2014 Song Yu was just afraid of admitting it. Past Yue Zhishi would\u2019ve told him everything, offered every little bit of information to Song Yu like a treasure, but now, he no longer did.\u201cAllergic to any medication?\u201dSong Yu said yes and listed out every drug Yue Zhishi was allergic to.\u201cWho are you to the patient?\u201d the doctor asked.Song Yu paused for two seconds, struggling, and then replied, \u201cOlder brother.\u201d\u201cThe fever\u2019s not too serious. He doesn\u2019t need to stay in the hospital, and we don\u2019t have space right now anyway. But I see he has a history of allergic asthma. Asthma can be easily triggered by a cold and a cough, so I\u2019ve prescribed a cough medicine. You need to watch over and take care of him the next few days. Go pay around the corner on the right and then take him to get an IV drip.\u201dSong Yu sat next to Yue Zhishi during the transfusion, telling him to rest on his shoulder. There was nothing he could do, and there was nothing he wanted to do, so he quietly stared at a stained patch on the hospital\u2019s white walls. Yue Zhishi seemed to hazily recover some consciousness, opening his mouth to say he wanted some water, and Song Yu pulled out the bottle of mineral water he\u2019d prepared earlier. After twisting open the cap, he placed the bottle next to his mouth, slanting it to pour in some water.But Yue Zhishi struggled to swallow, and even though Song Yu raised the bottle very slowly, a lot of water still trickled from Yue Zhishi\u2019s mouth. He grabbed a tissue and wiped Yue Zhishi dry.He heard Yue Zhishi painfully call him gege. For no reason at all, Song Yu suddenly felt angry. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say you were sick?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s reactions were delayed due to his illness. His face was flushed red from his fever, unable to take in enough air when he spoke, and yet he still reached out to touch Song Yu\u2019s arm without realising it. He didn\u2019t speak, only using this method to admit his mistake and ask for forgiveness.His hand was very pale, his veins visible, and a thin, short needle was inserted into the back of his hand. Song Yu thought, there was going to be a very obvious bruise there tomorrow.Yue Zhishi was someone easily injured.As he thought of this, the pain and worry he felt for Yue Zhishi once again defeated his anger, and so he stroked Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrist, treating it as a silent comfort.\u201cNext time you\u2019re sick, you need to tell me immediately.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if Yue Zhishi heard his words or not, because Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t do anything at all. He seemed to have closed his eyes once again due to his lack of energy. Song Yu flipped open Yue Zhishi\u2019s medical record he held in his hand, saw the word \u2018allergy\u2019, and his mind started to wander.He became aware that he himself seemed to often suffer from an allergy. It would flare up whenever he broke a taboo, and he would only wake up after it attacked. Except the more he wasn\u2019t allowed to touch something, the more he wanted to touch it \u2014 the taboo was meant to restrain desire, but instead, it gave birth to an even greater desire that was about to consume him.Yue Zhishi was Song Yu\u2019s one and only allergen.The night sky outside the window darkened as they sat there, and yet the hospital corridor was still so noisy. After finishing two bags of infusions, Song Yu brought Yue Zhishi and left the hospital.Yue Zhishi\u2019s impression of hospitals was always very terrible. He always went in when he was feeling most unwell, and he was forced to let other people give him all sorts of tests. He used to always cry when he was a child because he\u2019d thought it would be useful to do so, but reality proved otherwise. No matter how hard he cried or how loudly he screamed, illnesses that needed to be checked still needed to be checked.From falling asleep after his shower, to spending time in the hospital, to waking up in the middle of the night in a foreign place \u2014 Yue Zhishi was delirious for all the time in between. He was like a piece of self-igniting wood with no awareness, lifeless yet dangerous. This time, he woke again and realised everything around him was unfamiliar. The cream-coloured ceiling was very low, like a thick layer of clouds pressing down on him, and the blanket and bedding on his body were in the same dark colours Song Yu liked using. But they were all new without a single hint of Song Yu\u2019s smell on them at all.A faint light came from the bedside table. Yue Zhishi pushed himself up and borrowed the light to look around \u2014 the room wasn\u2019t large, and even though he hadn\u2019t come here before, it was decorated a bit like Song Yu\u2019s room.He touched his own forehead, thinking the fever was pretty much gone, but he was still weak. He wanted to get off the bed, but he could only move slowly.The door opened, and Yue Zhishi met Song Yu\u2019s eyes just as he was pulling away the blanket. Song Yu was bringing in some porridge. It was a bit awkward; Yue Zhishi froze, not knowing if he should continue getting off the bed, or if he should get back underneath the blanket.\u201cLie back down. Do you want to get a fever again?\u201d Song Yu placed the porridge onto the bedside table, forcefully pulling the blanket back over Yue Zhishi\u2019s body.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t say anything, seeming to lean back against the headboard obediently, and watched as Song Yu stood there above him. Song Yu lightly stirred the plain porridge in the bowl with a stainless steel spoon.He\u2019d never used stainless steel cutlery before, and even the bowl looked like it came from somewhere random.Everything looked very hastily prepared.\u201cYou\u2019ll need to take some more medicine after food, you should feel better after sleeping. The doctor said it\u2019s not very serious.\u201d He sat onto the bed and stretched out a hand, looking as if he was going to feed him.But Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t obediently shift closer automatically like he used to do. He simply didn\u2019t want to eat. His stomach really hurt, but it didn\u2019t feel like a stomachache \u2014 it was a dull, deep gnawing, as if something was being torn apart inside.Song Yu could see his resistance. \u201cAt least have a few bites.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice was very soft. He reached out a hand, wanting to take the bowl from Song Yu, but Song Yu put the bowl back down. He could see Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want him to feed him.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to eat now, you can wait until it\u2019s cooled down a bit.\u201dYue Zhishi dropped his eyes, sealing shut his lips. He fixed his eyes on the blanket covering his body and painfully managed to swallow back a cough. Song Yu touched his forehead again, briefly checking his temperature, and then took his hand back.Song Yu\u2019s heart eased \u2014 Yue Zhishi was no longer burning up. He pulled out all of the medicine Yue Zhishi needed to take and separated them out onto the table according to dosage. He\u2019d just lifted his head when he heard Yue Zhishi ask: \u201cWhat is this place?\u201dHis face was very pale, but his voice sounded fairly relaxed \u2014 as if he was asking only a random question.\u201cAn apartment I\u2019m renting.\u201d Song Yu counted the tablets again. There was one missing.Yue Zhishi first very lightly released a hum, and then he took a deep breath; this time, he couldn\u2019t hold back his coughing. He turned his face away when Song Yu turned to look at him. He didn\u2019t know that Song Yu had said he had a terrible temper when he was sick. If he\u2019d heard, he definitely would\u2019ve hurriedly denied it. He was actually very obedient \u2014 he only made a fuss because he was scared.Song Yu called out Yue Zhishi\u2019s name, prepared to feed him the medicine, but the coughing eventually stopped by itself. Yue Zhishi turned his head over to look at Song Yu, his gaze a bit empty.\u201cWhy\u2019d you rent a place?\u201dHe waited for a long while, and yet Song Yu didn\u2019t give him a response. Yue Zhishi usually would only ask a question once in order to not annoy Song Yu, but this time, he asked very insensitively again, \u201cWhy are you moving out?\u201d He lowered his head to look at the blanket after the question left his mouth.A layer of sweat covered Song Yu\u2019s palms. He didn\u2019t look at Yue Zhishi and only gave him a brief reason. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to live by myself.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Yue Zhishi was still smiling at the beginning, and then he continued asking, \u201cThen who did you want to leave this bed to? Who did you want to go with to get all the cutlery you haven\u2019t had time to buy? And then, in this apartment \u2014 who did you want to cook with, eat with and sleep together with?\u201dHis questions were thrown out one after another. He grew agitated to the point he was about to break apart, his voice shaking. Song Yu didn\u2019t expect and didn\u2019t really understand why Yue Zhishi became angry at such a minor thing like renting a place; he had still been okay at the hospital. Song Yu was very distressed, so he reached out a hand, catching Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand that was tightly clutching the blanket, trying to console him.\u201cBe good. Don\u2019t be like this.\u201d\u201cWhat am I like?\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes were red, tears stubbornly gathering and yet not falling. \u201cAm I not obedient enough?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve asked you before if I was really strange like this. You said I wasn\u2019t, you said I was only afraid of separating from you.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice slightly trembled, so he took a small pause. \u201cNo matter what you said, I listened and followed along. Even if you treated me like a child, I still believed you.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t find anything he wanted to see in Song Yu\u2019s face. He lowered his head and accidentally saw the red rash on the inside of his arm. He rubbed the rash with his fingers, his face blank \u2014 the rash turned angrier, and he muttered, \u201cAn allergic reaction again. I\u2019m still so sensitive.\u201dYue Zhishi broke down without warning \u2014 that mild allergic reaction became the final straw and overwhelmed him, and he cried bitterly like a child. \u201cWhy I am still reacting\u2026 Weren\u2019t you at the hospital? Didn\u2019t you tell the doctor I was allergic? You keep things away from me so carefully, but did that help me at all?\u201dNan Jia was right: he really was in uncontrollable pain. He convulsively sobbed, struggling to breathe, and yet he still raised his head to stare at Song Yu. The tears clouded his sight, so Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t see what look Song Yu had on his face. He actually really, really wanted to see clearly, and this made him even more angry. He didn\u2019t want to look anymore.Yue Zhishi felt very fragile, but he didn\u2019t plead for Song Yu to hug him like he did in the past.He curled up, hugging his knees and burying his head into the crook of his arms. \u201cIt was no use at all. I still ended up liking you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, he truly wasn\u2019t himself tonight \u2014 he\u2019d even wanted to die earlier when he was driving.Song Yu had never given himself the opportunity to hope for Yue Zhishi to return his feelings. The world was so large \u2014 it was already so unlikely for two people to meet, and they\u2019d even become family members who could be with each other for their entire lives.What else could he ask for?He approached Yue Zhishi with a very narrow view because of this fixed way of thinking; he kept thinking he was very pure and very innocent because he\u2019d been brought up with such love and care. Song Yu would sometimes even lose sight of what Yue Zhishi had lost, thinking he must be happy.The now grown up Yue Zhishi fell to pieces and cried in utter pain in front of him \u2014 it was the first time Song Yu had ever felt so lost, not knowing what to do.The hand covering the back of Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand shifted unnaturally. It felt like a very anguished feeling kept transmitting through this connection, pouring into Song Yu\u2019s heart.As expected, he truly was a failure as a rock. He looked so strong and stubborn on the outside, and yet his inner heart was an utter mess, soft and weak.Song Yu touched Yue Zhishi\u2019s head, called out his nickname in a very soft voice and pulled him into his arms.Yue Zhishi actually didn\u2019t want Song Yu to see him cry. He didn\u2019t want him to see such fragile parts of him, but he wasn\u2019t a mature adult. He had a limited threshold, and he could only bear it up to here.He buried his face into Song Yu\u2019s shoulder, his tears mixing into the cotton fibres of Song Yu\u2019s jacket. Yue Zhishi felt much lighter after saying it out loud \u2014 he didn\u2019t expect much to begin with, so he didn\u2019t wait for a response. Song Yu had always treated him very well, and he probably wouldn\u2019t reject him as coldly and resolutely as he rejected other people. He was more likely to try to persuade him.The aching from his sickness both clouded and cleared his mind, and all of the possible things Song Yu could say passed through his brain. He told himself he couldn\u2019t cry anymore. He honestly looked really ugly when he cried.Song Yu\u2019s hand kept softly patting his back. It was only just a few years ago when Song Yu still hadn\u2019t known how to comfort him, when he\u2019d had to personally grab his hand and tell him he needed to pat like that when comforting someone.Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but grow upset again. He thought again of what he\u2019d just done and felt he had been too aggressive. It felt like he was always forcing Song Yu, again and again. He\u2019d forced him to stay with him when it thundered, forced him to accept him staying behind and even forced him to admit he was his gege in front of everyone.But now, after he\u2019d smashed the relationship in between them so impulsively \u2014 how should Song Yu face him? How could they go back to how they were like before? He really didn\u2019t want to become one of Song Yu\u2019s burdens.Yue Zhishi started to regret it again.But Song Yu\u2019s embrace was truly too intoxicating. It was the most powerful hallucinogen in the world, and even if he knew best how many failed examples were ahead of him, even if he knew he\u2019d definitely leave with bloody, dripping injuries after plunging straight in \u2014 he could still only smell the blood red and candied smell of roses.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t cry anymore. He acutely sensed the hesitation and indecisiveness in Song Yu\u2019s breathing, as if he was about to say something. He was very scared, and before he could be pushed away, he grabbed Song Yu\u2019s back.Sure enough, he heard Song Yu speak.\u201cCan you repeat what you just said?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice was very low, and it carried a rarely heard uncertainty and confusion, as if he really did think it was his problem. He didn\u2019t even dare to repeat what he heard.This surprised Yue Zhishi. He didn\u2019t know what Song Yu was trying to do \u2014 or was he going to laugh at his feelings?\u201cI said I like you.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s face remained hidden away. He emphasised, voice filled with tears, \u201cI really do.\u201dHe felt Song Yu\u2019s body slacken, his chest heaving for a long time. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d frightened him. Yue Zhishi lifted his head and used his tear swollen eyes to look at him, quietly calling out gege.He couldn\u2019t tell if Song Yu\u2019s face was upset or smiling. Song Yu took Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand, his fingertips lightly caressing the rash on his arm.\u201cHow come there\u2019s still an allergic reaction\u2026\u201d He spoke very weakly.Yue Zhishi thought, as expected, he was confused and didn\u2019t know what to do. From the first moment he\u2019d appeared in Song Yu\u2019s life, he\u2019d persistently created trouble for Song Yu.Even though Song Yu had clearly done nothing wrong.He heard it start to rain outside the window, the constant pitter-pattering noise of the rain seeping into the room. This place was truly very nice \u2014 it was Song Yu\u2019s style. The ceiling to floor curtains in the room covered up everything, but they should be able to see beautiful views during the day.It was as nice as that turquoise stone. In his heart, Yue Zhishi silently said, at least the first person to receive a memento and the first person to use this apartment \u2014 was him.\u201cYue Zhishi.\u201d After what felt like a century, Song Yu was finally willing to speak to him. His eyelids were lowered, his hand still holding on his arm, and his voice was solemn. \u201cOut of the things I\u2019m going to say, there are some things that might cause you to misunderstand me. But I\u2019ve never wanted to trick you, and neither am I doubting you. It\u2019s just that there are more things for me to consider. Okay?\u201dHe frowned briefly and gazed at Yue Zhishi from ten centimetres away, waiting until Yue Zhishi nodded with his red eyes. He only then continued. \u201cYou\u2019re sick right now. You\u2019ve only just stopped having a fever, and this is not the best time to make a decision. Is this something you\u2019ve carefully thought about, or are you actually not sure and can\u2019t tell whether you feel familial\u00a0affection for me or\u2026\u201dHe hesitated for a moment and only then pushed out with great difficulty, \u201cLove.\u201d After he finished speaking, Song Yu seemed to belatedly remember something and grabbed up the thin khaki coloured woollen quilt on top of the blanket, circling it around Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulders and wrapping him up.\u201cCan I answer now?\u201d Yue Zhishi coughed twice and then struggled to hold back from further coughing.Song Yu dipped his head, looking at his eyes.\u201cI was confused before, but now I\u2019m sure I can tell the difference.\u201d Yue Zhishi stared at Song Yu\u2019s long and slender fingers, his head lowered. He said, nose blocked, \u201cSong Yu, I\u2019m nineteen years old.\u201dMaybe it was because he couldn\u2019t breathe smoothly, but that last sentence of his sounded particularly feeble. Song Yu didn\u2019t have the heart to point out that he hadn\u2019t actually had his birthday yet.Yue Zhishi felt like Song Yu didn\u2019t believe him, so he asked, \u201cHow do you define what love is? You\u2019re the person I like the most, and other than to you, I wouldn\u2019t feel the same way to anyone else. I only want to be together with you for all twenty-four hours. I like hugging you, and I really want to hold your hand when I\u2019m walking with you. When I saw that couple kissing on the plank bridge, I\u2026\u201dHis voice dropped, slightly losing confidence. \u201cI also wanted to kiss you.\u201dConfessions should be made using more romantic words and expressions.But Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t able to do it. As a young person, he didn\u2019t have the rich experience and history to draw from, and he wasn\u2019t able to find all that many heart-stirring words. He could only slowly, timidly and impatiently cut open his chest blazing with love and let Song Yu see. Song Yu was born with a face everyone adored; Yue Zhishi felt he was a desperately poor child, afraid of not being worth much even after taking out all his money \u2014 afraid he still wouldn\u2019t be valuable in Song Yu\u2019s eyes.But Song Yu raised his hand, touching and stroking his face. He seemed to really want to say something, but he didn\u2019t say it at the end.Yue Zhishi was a bit dizzy. He asked, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m being very hasty?\u201dSong Yu shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just really surprised.\u201dAnyone would be surprised at a little brother who\u2019d grown up together with you suddenly having these kinds of improper thoughts.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi pressed his lips together. He swallowed back the question he wanted to ask. Green and blue veins could be faintly seen on his thin and white eyelids, and his eyelashes were slightly trembling. \u201cI interrupted you just then. You can continue what you were going to say now.\u201dThe rain outside the window fell harder, and Yue Zhishi hoped it wouldn\u2019t thunder. Or else he would fall to pieces even more, and Song Yu might not stay with him after hearing his confession.Song Yu actually didn\u2019t want to see Yue Zhishi acting so uneasily. He was very happy after hearing those words, but he was also worried and fearful, feeling as though he\u2019d created all this with his own hands. The sweetness Yue Zhishi was currently giving him \u2014 it was the cookie he\u2019d personally fed him all those years ago. He had no way of predicting what was going to happen in the future.\u201cLe Le.\u201d Song Yu gripped Yue Zhishi\u2019s fingers. \u201cWhy did you suddenly get angry when you heard I rented an apartment?\u201dYue Zhishi corrected him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t angry, I was upset.\u201d And then he slowly explained, \u201cThey all say you have someone you like. I thought you wanted to be like senior Qin Yan and move in with someone, and then, just like when I was in high school\u2026 hide from me.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of person do you like?\u201d Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but ask.Song Yu\u2019s palm, broad and dry, covered his hand. He tossed a question back at him. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dHead lowered, Yue Zhishi feebly listed out the conditions he\u2019d considered many times. \u201cSomeone mature, independent, who wouldn\u2019t pester you for no reason, who would give you personal space\u2026\u2026 Someone who\u2019d better be beautiful, too.\u201d He added the last condition himself. He felt like Song Yu didn\u2019t really care about appearances, or else senior Nan Jia would already be extremely suitable.He didn\u2019t realise he\u2019d been frowning until Song Yu softly rubbed at the centre of his eyebrows. \u201cLooks like our senses of beauty really are completely different.\u201dYue Zhishi lifted his eyes, giving him a glance, and his lips subconsciously pressed together.\u201cOther than that last bit, everything else doesn\u2019t match.\u201d Song Yu gazed at him, his eyes warm and gentle. \u201cEven completely opposite.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t understand and sniffed, slightly disdaining his preferences. \u201cYou actually like someone childish and clingy, someone who likes to bother you.\u201d No wonder he didn\u2019t like senior Nan Jia.\u201cYes. I like a beautiful idiot.\u201dAfter frankly and openly saying it, Song Yu leaned in and kissed Yue Zhishi\u2019s forehead.This unexpected movement scared Yue Zhishi into lifting his head, his tears covered eyes very wide and filled with shock and disbelief as he looked at Song Yu. He was like a little puppy who\u2019d been hit with an apple \u2014 he blinked multiple times, not understanding what happened.He called out gege very weakly. This was something he was used to doing every time he wasn\u2019t sure what to do.\u201cAt least don\u2019t call me that anymore.\u201d Song Yu smiled wryly. \u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d\u201cFrom a very long time ago, I didn\u2019t want to be just your older brother.\u201dHe\u2019d walked on the wire rope as carefully as though he was walking on thin ice, struggling for so long. Morals and ethics pulled at him on one side, and the love accumulated over days and months pulled at him from the other side. No matter which side he fell, it would still be into endlessly burning lava, raging with flames.Seeing Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes once again gathering with tears, Song Yu stroked his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else. There\u2019s never been.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t willing for Yue Zhishi to be in pain; as long as he stood by one side and beckoned to him, Song Yu would jump down from the wire immediately. So many years of misgivings and struggles \u2014 they collapsed against a single\u00a0don\u2019t reject me\u00a0from Yue Zhishi.It felt good to jump down. Even if he chose wrongly, he would still stand in front of Yue Zhishi, blocking and taking all the blame.Yue Zhishi\u2019s mind was completely blank, his fingertips numb, and was even more at a loss than before. His weak body from the fever also slowed down his thinking, and he frowned uneasily. He didn\u2019t care if he sounded childish or not, thoughtlessly asking, \u201cReally?\u201dSong Yu solemnly nodded. \u201cI can also answer the questions you asked me before you started crying. I rented this apartment for you. Not to hide from you \u2014 but because you\u2019re always falling sick, and it\u2019s not convenient to take care of you in the dorms. It\u2019s too far to go home, so I needed to find a place where you could rest.\u201d\u201cThe landlord gave me the keys two days ago. I actually didn\u2019t go out for a surface survey today. I came to furnish the place, so yes, there truly hasn\u2019t been anyone else who\u2019ve lived here. The bowl is new \u2014 I bought it downstairs out of urgency. I originally wanted to find an excuse over the weekend to take you shopping at Ikea.\u201dHe stood up, drawing open the curtains. A layer of rain covered the ceiling to floor windows, blurring the quiet yet resplendent lake view.\u201cYou said you wanted to see the lake. Is this okay?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice was a bit nervous. \u201cI was really in a rush. It still might not be good enough, but it\u2019s much better than Qin Yan\u2019s place.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s tears flowed down again. He wiped the tears away with the back of his hand, but there were more tears the more he wiped until he finally wrapped the woollen quilt around himself, not letting Song Yu see him. How could something so good happen to him \u2014 how could he still be crying so shamefully.In the shadowy, hazy light, he sensed Song Yu coming closer. His footsteps were softened by the carpet, becoming tender and gentle, and he sat down, a small piece of Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart sinking down with him.\u201cLe Le, I\u2019ve liked you for a very long time. Even though I\u2019ve questioned your feelings, please forgive me. Don\u2019t question my heart for you.\u201dAfter considering it repeatedly, Song Yu still decided to splash a basin of cold water over Yue Zhishi and over himself.\u201cBut right now, you and I are both feeling very emotional. A large part of you liking me might have come from the dependency you hold towards an older brother. There are actually many, many people better than me in this world \u2014 I was the one who limited your field of vision.\u201d He no longer sounded as calm as before, but he did his best to control his feelings, to finish saying what he needed to say.\u201cWe\u2019ll be up against many problems\u2026\u201d A touch of evasion grew in his heart. He didn\u2019t really want to continue speaking, and Yue Zhishi also didn\u2019t let him continue. He fumbled about, grabbing onto Song Yu\u2019s hand, and very forcefully linked their fingers together, as if showing his determination.Song Yu laughed a bit helplessly, and said one sentence he\u2019d thought he would never say.\u201cLet\u2019s give it a try.\u201d He added, somewhat uncertainly, \u201cIf you want.\u201dThe woollen quilt was still on top of Yue Zhishi\u2019s head. He forgot about it, absorbed in eagerly, excitedly lifting his head, and yet he couldn\u2019t even see Song Yu\u2019s face.Just a try. If you meet someone you like more, you can go back on what you\u2019ve said. You can leave whenever you want.Song Yu only said it silently in his heart, afraid his words might disappoint Yue Zhishi. He took them as a warning to himself.Even though he\u2019d only said they\u2019d give it a try, Yue Zhishi was already beyond happy, taking off the quilt on his face with exhilaration and happiness. He accidentally ended up hiccuping, so he quickly covered his face again, as if he could pretend nothing happened by doing so.\u201cThen can you kiss my forehead again?\u201d He hiccupped again, and the words \u2018beautiful idiot\u2019 drifted across his mind.\u201cSure,\u201d Song Yu said.Separated by the quilt, Yue Zhishi felt Song Yu\u2019s warm breath drawing near, and his heart started to race.And yet that warm kiss didn\u2019t land on his forehead as promised \u2014 it landed on his lips, soft fibres in between.Song Yu opened up the thin quilt after he moved his lips away and wrapped his arms around him. He\u2019d matured early at a precocious age, and in front of this love that went against the ethics of the world, he showed an unprecedented clumsiness, passiveness and solemness.\u201cNo matter how long this may last, I will still treasure you very, very much.\u201dThe author has something to say:Maybe because the double-sided arrows in my novels are always extraordinarily thick, but once one person confesses, the other person won\u2019t be willing to reject him no matter what \u2014 the emotional journey between them has been connected. I also think getting together can be one of the climaxes of the story, it doesn\u2019t have to be the end. From beginning their relationship to learning how to love each other, they still need to go through many, many things.But no matter what, these little puppies are about to begin their journey of cautious and inexperienced first love.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wrapped in Song Yu\u2019s arms, Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t hear the sounds of rain; he could only hear his rapidly beating heart.He felt completely dizzy, his arms and legs weak and sore. Everything felt too good to be true, just like the display items in glass windows \u2014 he wanted them even in his dreams, but he was always separated by a transparent barrier. He could only look at them and not touch.When he heard Song Yu say they could give it a try, Yue Zhishi\u2019s first reaction was to think he was dreaming. He\u2019d already passed the night in an utter daze with only a few slices of memories, and who knows: maybe he was still in his dorm, Song Yu hadn\u2019t come to take him to the hospital and there was no rented apartment.But Yue Zhishi thought again \u2014 based on his usual quality of sleep whenever he was sick, he definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to have such a good dream.Seeing Yue Zhishi not speaking for so long, Song Yu lowered his head to look at him. He saw his eyes wide open, his two arms loosely wrapped around his waist, looking as if he was lost in his thoughts.Song Yu recalled his words just then. They truly couldn\u2019t be considered as an acceptable confession. He didn\u2019t seem to have said all that many suitable and sweet words. Other than pouring cold water, he\u2019d only said instructional words.\u201cYue Zhishi, are you a bit disappointed?\u201dYue Zhishi jerked up his head, staring at Song Yu. Doubt slightly filled his eyes.Song Yu self-consciously shifted away his eyes. \u201cShould I have bought a gift, or maybe furnished this place a bit prettier.\u201d\u201cThen I would be even less likely to have that sort of dream.\u201d Yue Zhishi responded with a sentence that came out of nowhere. Song Yu frowned in confusion.But Yue Zhishi still felt very blissful \u2014 he clung to Song Yu, unwilling to let go, and stuck his cheek onto the skin of his collarbones. He didn\u2019t call him gege, only earnestly calling out his name.\u201cSong Yu.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d Song Yu gave him a response, his palm covering Yue Zhishi\u2019s nape.Yue Zhishi shook his head, squeezing Song Yu tighter.The reply that had been delivered through pen and paper appeared in front of him now, changed into a warm embrace he could take shelter in. Since he was three years old, Song Yu had been a beautiful dream Yue Zhishi chased after.This beautiful dream was out of reach to everyone else, but Yue Zhishi was lucky \u2014 he was an exception. He only needed to work just a bit harder, cling just a bit tighter, and he was able to touch that hidden tail, obtaining that gentle touch no one else saw. It was because of this that so many unrealistic fantasies grew in Yue Zhishi.Little brothers never yearned to stay with their older brothers for their entire lives. It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d never doubted his own unjustifiable behaviour and way of thinking, but Song Yu had said he could. So he\u2019d believed him all this time, until he broke though this fake safety zone by himself.The separation anxiety he held towards Song Yu wasn\u2019t because Song Yu was a very good older brother. It also wasn\u2019t because he was a little brother who never grew up \u2014 it was solely because he liked him.\u201cI really like you.\u201d Yue Zhishi nuzzled his face into Song Yu\u2019s collarbone, wriggling without thinking and repeating those words once again. Song Yu shied a bit away from his wriggling and placed his hand on Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t fuss.\u201dYue Zhishi said he wasn\u2019t fussing, and he ended up accidentally coughing. He wasn\u2019t able to stop once he started and, worried he\u2019d infect Song Yu, turned away to continue coughing. Song Yu wrapped the quilt around him again, subconsciously looking for the medicine.It was just a false alarm. Yue Zhishi stopped coughing very quickly and took the water and the large pile of tablets Song Yu gave him. Cold capsules, cough tablets, allergy pills \u2014 Yue Zhishi very obediently ate them one by one. Except there were truly too many, and so he ran out of patience and swallowed down the last remaining few in Song Yu\u2019s hand all in one go. The pills were both bitter and hard to swallow, and he fell onto the bed, face glum and eyebrows drawn.Song Yu touched his forehead, thinking he still had a low fever. \u201cI\u2019ll go heat up the porridge. You should sleep after having some food.\u201dYue Zhishi caught his hand, looking as if he didn\u2019t really want to let him leave, but he\u2019d only just caught his hand when he let go again, very docilely saying okay.\u201cI\u2019ll be quick.\u201d Song Yu patted his hand and went downstairs with the cooled bowl of porridge.Only Yue Zhishi was left in the room. He looked around the room once again, and it looked pleasing no matter how he looked at it. It was a bit empty, but Song Yu still needed to take him to Ikea. It\u2019d be best to go tomorrow \u2014 they haven\u2019t shopped at Ikea together before.He needed to quickly get better.Yue Zhishi felt a bit weak, so he removed the quilt and burrowed into the blanket, wanting to rest for a while.The blanket also seemed to be completely new, fluffy and soft, and it held that very new cotton fibre smell. His eyes wandered to his sleeves; he was wearing a pair of black striped pyjamas made of pure cotton, threaded with the smell of Song Yu.He went into a daze for a bit, and then he abruptly panicked, stretching out his arm to look at it.That wasn\u2019t right \u2014 he remembered he was clearly wearing a pair of dusty blue pyjamas.Yue Zhishi shoved away the blanket, looking down at that pair of roomy black pyjamas.They really did belong to Song Yu.A buzzing noise started in Yue Zhishi\u2019s brain, and he touched the button that was fastened all the way up to his neck. He then looked downwards and pulled open his pants to check. Fortunately, his underwear was still his own.When Song Yu returned with the bowl of porridge, he saw Yue Zhishi lying on his stomach like a little puppy, his face completely buried into the pillow.\u201cAsleep?\u201dYue Zhishi lifted a hand, waving it at him.\u201cThen get up and have some porridge.\u201dSong Yu sat on the side of the bed, forcefully flipping Yue Zhishi over. He realised his face was entirely flushed, and his pair of eyes were still slightly swollen from crying. He looked particularly pitiful. Song Yu very lightly stroked his cheek. \u201cWhy\u2019s your face so red.\u201dYue Zhishi could feel his ears burning. He was too shy for Song Yu to feed him again, so he grabbed the bowl of porridge sitting on the bedside table by himself and had a bite. It was clearly only a bowl of plain porridge, but it was very sweet.\u201cDid you add white sugar?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked, his eyes raised.\u201cI was worried you wouldn\u2019t be able to eat it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really yummy.\u201d Yue Zhishi ate spoon after spoon, and he couldn\u2019t continue eating after finishing a bit over half the bowl, giving it back to Song Yu. Knowing Yue Zhishi\u2019s stomach wasn\u2019t feeling well, Song Yu didn\u2019t force him to keep eating. He only told him to drink some warm water and urged him to lay down and sleep.\u201cI still have to organise some data.\u201d Song Yu leaned over to touch his forehead. Yue Zhishi really wanted him to kiss him again, but Song Yu didn\u2019t, simply stroking him very tenderly from his forehead to his cheek before caressing Yue Zhishi\u2019s earlobe.\u201cYou\u2019ll feel better after sleeping.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s entire body felt weak and numb after that chain of movements. It was like a tiny electrical current ran underneath his skin, and his brain fogged up even more. He subconsciously reached out and held Song Yu\u2019s hand.\u201cCan you not go?\u201dYue Zhishi was extremely unsatisfied with the rain today. Since it didn\u2019t thunder, he couldn\u2019t find a suitable excuse and became particularly unconfident.Song Yu stared at his eyes and, after a little while, unexpectedly nodded. Yue Zhishi struck while the iron was still hot, pleading for him to sleep together with him, but Song Yu refused, saying they only had one blanket. There would be a gap underneath the blanket while they slept, and Yue Zhishi might catch a cold again.\u201cYou could grab another blanket.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t able to change his mind, so Song Yu could only grab the blanket from the other room and place it onto the bed. He went to shower and wore a pair of comfortable and clean looking white pyjamas, coming back in with his laptop.Yue Zhishi sat on the bed, happily patting the empty blanket next to him. Song Yu had no choice but to turn off all of the other lights in the room, leaving only the little lamp on the bedside table. He then got into his own blanket and started on his work while sitting up in bed.After getting his wishes fulfilled, Yue Zhishi obligingly snuggled himself up into his own blanket. He turned onto his side, exposing only his head, and stared at the side of Song Yu\u2019s face without moving. Song Yu had still yet to bring over his glasses, so he occasionally squinted as he looked at the data on his laptop. Whenever he did, Yue Zhishi would squish his face against Song Yu\u2019s blanket.He liked him too much. He needed to take a pause to breathe.Song Yu focused on his screen without moving his eyes away. \u201cIf you don\u2019t sleep, you won\u2019t get better.\u201d\u201cThen can I continue staying here if I don\u2019t get better?\u201d Yue Zhishi shifted slightly closer again to him.\u201cSure. I\u2019ll head back.\u201dSong Yu started teasing him again. Somewhat hurt, Yue Zhishi retreated backwards a bit. Even though Song Yu didn\u2019t look at him, he still reached out a hand and stroked his hair. \u201cI\u2019m just joking.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already asked for leave for you. It\u2019s the weekend luckily enough, and you don\u2019t have any classes. We\u2019ll need to be careful the next few days, or else your asthma might start again.\u201dYue Zhishi gripped Song Yu\u2019s fingers, softly saying, \u201cMn.\u201dThe night darkened, the temperature dropping. Yue Zhishi was a bit cold, so he slightly withdrew back into his blanket. Song Yu pretty much also finished his work, and he closed his laptop, putting it on the cupboard. He then turned the lamp down to its weakest level and lay down.Yue Zhishi was still looking at him like before, not making a single noise.\u201cIs the flu medicine not working?\u201d Song Yu also lay on his side, gazing at Yue Zhishi\u2019s light-coloured eyes. \u201cHow come you\u2019re not sleepy?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep.\u201d Yue Zhishi rapidly blinked, and under the light of the lamp, his thick eyelashes became a soft, downy brown colour. \u201cYou might leave after I fall asleep. Isn\u2019t there a room next door? You actually could\u2019ve rented a small, one bedroom apartment.\u201dHis words were too obvious, and the corners of Song Yu\u2019s straight mouth lightly curled up. \u201cI won\u2019t leave.\u201dHe said again, \u201cI won\u2019t leave again.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded and smiled too. His smiling eyes held a very beautiful curve, and they were pure and clean, empty of any worries. Song Yu kept getting distracted, thinking this was all a dream.Whenever that happened, he would reach out and touch Yue Zhishi, double checking if he was truly there. Over the course of this one night, he didn\u2019t know how many times he\u2019d double checked.Just as he was once again absorbed in his thoughts, Yue Zhishi leaned in. The blankets might have been in between them, but the tips of their noses were almost about to touch. His face was still very red, and he stalled for a while before he finally couldn\u2019t hold it back anymore. \u201cMy pyjamas from earlier\u2026\u201dSong Yu raised his eyebrows just a little, only then realising what he meant. \u201cYour clothes were damp from sweating so much while you had a fever. I changed you into a new pair.\u201dYue Zhishi pursed his lips. Song Yu saw through his little expression easily and worked hard to not let himself think about the memory of changing his clothes, forcing a peaceful and clear expression on his face.\u201cYou started showering with me since you were three. I\u2019ve already seen it all.\u201dEvery time he was teased by Song Yu, Yue Zhishi\u2019s face would be covered by a very lively expression, and the look was very much able to please Song Yu \u2014 even if the Song Yu right now was struggling with the lingering memory in his brain. Yue Zhishi said that\u2019s true, that\u2019s true, and the rash on his arm started itching again. He scratched at his arm, a bit irritated.\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Song Yu noticed and pressed down on his arm over the blanket. \u201cThe more you scratch, the more the rash will get worse.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so itchy.\u201d Yue Zhishi rolled up his sleeve. As expected, red spread down the inside of his arm.He\u2019d be particularly uncomfortable every time a rash appeared on his body. He really enjoyed scratching them when he was younger, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop once he started. He didn\u2019t listen no matter what the adults said, and it was only Song Yu who\u2019d thought of a plan \u2014 such as cutting his fingernails completely bare. Yue Zhishi had been very afraid of having his nails trimmed, and he and Song Yu used to sit on their own separate little stools when they were younger, Song Yu holding his hand and gingerly yet coolly clipping his nails. Yue Zhishi was afraid of him cutting into his flesh and kept shrinking away.His nails couldn\u2019t scratch after they were trimmed, and Yue Zhishi could only get Song Yu to touch him whenever he felt itchy.Just like now.\u201cIt\u2019s useless touching it.\u201d Yue Zhishi looked unhappy. \u201cIt\u2019s still really itchy. Why don\u2019t you pinch me.\u201dSong Yu helplessly glanced at him. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say bite?\u201d\u201cYou can bite too, as long as it doesn\u2019t itch anymore,\u201d Yue Zhishi emphasised, completely willing to sacrifice himself.\u201cFine.\u201dSong Yu brought his arm up to his mouth, opening his lips. Thinking he was actually going to bite down, Yue Zhishi hurriedly said, \u201cLightly.\u201dBut he didn\u2019t. Song Yu\u2019s eyes were lowered, and he held onto the bottom of Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand \u2014 he very softly kissed his arm covered with rashes.Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart was beating madly, and he watched Song Yu\u2019s handsome face, watched as the tip of his nose pressed into the skin of his arm when he kissed him. He felt like his entire body was immersed in the aftereffects of such sweetness, and yet for no reason at all, an overly anxious kind of grieving overcame him, one that was not quite in preparation for the future.If he hadn\u2019t gotten sick today, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have dared to cry and say he liked Song Yu. Then when would he have been able to possess Song Yu?\u201cSleep.\u201d Song Yu turned off the light, the room falling into darkness in one moment. He patted Yue Zhishi\u2019s blanket, as if to comfort him. \u201cI\u2019ll buy some yoghurt mousse cake for you tomorrow.\u201dIt was quiet for a while, and Song Yu thought Yue Zhishi had finally fallen asleep. He also closed his eyes, but after only three seconds, his blanket was pulled away. Yue Zhishi wormed his way in without saying a single thing, and he stuck onto Song Yu\u2019s body like a piece of sticky candy, arms going around his waist.\u201cI\u2019m so cold.\u201d Yue Zhishi tilted his head, his voice soft and light. \u201cHug me while I sleep.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to stay by himself in another blanket, unable to reach Song Yu. Only skin contact could make Yue Zhishi feel fully secure.Song Yu\u2019s body stiffened for a second, and then he said, very unnaturally, \u201cYour body\u2019s clearly warm.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m sick.\u201d Yue Zhishi wouldn\u2019t let go of Song Yu\u2019s waist, and he drew close to Song Yu\u2019s ear. \u201cGege, can\u2019t you hug me to sleep?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s heart quickened when he called out gege \u2014 Yue Zhishi was forever able to subconsciously know his kryptonite. He slightly turned his face, agreeing to Yue Zhishi\u2019s request with a steady voice. \u201cI can.\u201dYue Zhishi was extremely satisfied, and he even kissed Song Yu\u2019s cheek voluntarily, even going to kiss the side of his neck. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cBe serious,\u201d Song Yu warned.\u201cI\u2019m very serious,\u201d Yue Zhishi sincerely said. He squirmed in his arms once again after he finished speaking, trying to find the most seamless, gap-free hugging position he could find.Just as Yue Zhishi wriggled in his arms for the third time, Song Yu could no longer bear it and held down the back of Yue Zhishi\u2019s waist.\u201cYou might\u2019ve been a little brother for too long, and your mind might not have gotten used to it yet. There\u2019s something I need to say clearly.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice was a bit hoarse. \u201cRight now, you are lying in the arms of an adult man who holds ulterior motives towards you. Don\u2019t try to test other people\u2019s self-control. That self-control was already depleted by more than fifty percent when changing your clothes.\u201dYue Zhishi finally behaved, not moving at all. Song Yu didn\u2019t know if he was sleeping or not, but the face pressed onto the side of his neck was ridiculously warm. Let alone squirming again, he even scratched his own rash timidly.After threatening him, Song Yu sternly requested, \u201cGive me your hand.\u201dYue Zhishi did so, very obediently. Song Yu grasped the hand he stretched out and interlaced their fingers together very firmly.\u201cThis is to stop you from scratching again.\u201d Song Yu left a lot of room in his explanation and fell into his dreams, embracing the now well-behaved Yue Zhishi.When he woke up the next day, Yue Zhishi was hugging Song Yu\u2019s pillow. He was a bit confused, feeling as though the pillow was intentionally stuffed into his arms by someone. He touched his forehead to check \u2014 his fever was completely gone, only his throat still slightly aching, and he didn\u2019t want to get out of bed.\u201cSong Yu\u2026\u201dSong Yu came in after he called twice. He had already changed his clothes, wearing a black long-sleeved sweater without a hood and a pair of white pants. He looked very relaxed. \u201cAwake now?\u201dYue Zhishi nodded in his nest of blankets. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201dOf course he was hungry, it was already midday. Song Yu pulled out a set of his own clothes and told Yue Zhishi to wear them after he finished cleaning up.\u201cGo out for a bit?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dWhen he was going down the stairs, Yue Zhishi\u2019s legs, stomach and waist were incredibly sore, as if he\u2019d had a fight with someone. He found the apartment truly very nice \u2014 other than the ceiling to floor windows, it also had a very large balcony directly facing a wide span of the lake. The water shimmered, light bouncing off the lake. It was absolutely breathtaking.\u201cThe shoes are a bit big.\u201d Yue Zhishi sat on the sofa and shook his leg after putting on a shoe. There was so much space around his foot. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m stepping on a boat.\u201dSong Yu came over, and Yue Zhishi thought he was going to laugh at him \u2014 he didn\u2019t expect him to kneel on one leg in front of him and mutely undo the shoelaces, drawing them tighter bit by bit to tie up his shoelaces again.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Song Yu lifted his eyes, gazing at him.This look from Song Yu flustered Yue Zhishi; he could only nod blankly. \u201cMuch better.\u201dSo Song Yu lowered his head again and helped him put on the other shoe. He even tugged at his crooked sock. \u201cAlready nineteen years old, and yet you still don\u2019t know how to wear your socks.\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been my birthday yet,\u201d Yue Zhishi quibbled.Song Yu stood up, a smile hanging from his lips. \u201cSo you do know.\u201dThe two of them left once they were ready, and Song Yu drove him out to the neighbourhood. Yue Zhishi left a small crack in the window, and the sweet osmanthus fragrance of the end of September drifted inside.\u201cThere\u2019s a decent dessert shop over there.\u201d\u201cAre we eating cake?\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes brightened.\u201cMn.\u201d Song Yu parked the car and took off his seatbelt. \u201cI promised you yesterday.\u201dYue Zhishi followed behind Song Yu closely and saw himself reflected on the dessert shop\u2019s glass doors, once again wearing Song Yu\u2019s clothes like last time when he\u2019d stayed over at his dorm. He thought about it differently this time \u2014 it felt wonderful seeing himself like that again, as if he was stamped from head to toe with the label\u00a0I belong to Song Yu.The small dessert shop was very pretty, its walls a lake blue and decorated slightly in an American countryside style. The circular glass windows were also designed to be pulled up from the bottom. Yue Zhishi really liked the little windows, so he chose to sit down at a table next to one of them.\u201cHello, one slice of wheat-free yoghurt mousse cake, one hot flat white and one shot of espresso.\u201d After Song Yu ordered, he told Yue Zhishi to obediently wait for him. He was going to the pharmacy across the street to buy a thermometer.The slice of cake came swiftly, blueberries and strawberries beautifully spread on top. It looked so delicious. Yue Zhishi picked up a fork, ate a small bite \u2014 it was even tastier than Song Yu had described.A couple sat diagonally in front of him, and the girl fed the guy a bite of their cake. They looked very sweet. So Yue Zhishi placed down the fork in his hand, preparing to wait until gege came back for them to eat it together.He was going to be like other people and have a magnificent love.Song Yu bought the thermometer and saw Yue Zhishi\u2019s fluffy head through the yellow circular window as he crossed the road. His phone suddenly rang; it was Yue Zhishi calling.\u201cHow come you\u2019re still not back?\u201d It was as if he\u2019d already waited for a very long time.\u201cI\u2019m almost done.\u201d Song Yu walked towards him, stopping in front of that window.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t react until his shadow cast down on him. He lifted his head and looked at Song Yu\u2019s face with surprise \u2014 and then, once again as if something was controlling his body, he lifted his hand and laid it against the glass.This time, Song Yu didn\u2019t rest his hand on the glass like he did before.\u201cHold my hand for a bit.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice was deep and gentle through the phone.He pulled up the glass window and joined Yue Zhishi\u2019s palm with his own \u2014 there were no barriers between them, and for a short amount of time, they interlocked their fingers together.The author has something to say:Sharing some sugar first, the little couple definitely needs to be fed first after just getting into a relationship.(spoiler)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58: To Quench a Thirst with PoisonAfter eating a simple meal in a cafe, Song Yu drove Yue Zhishi to Ikea. The drive was fairly long, and Yue Zhishi fell asleep after taking some medicine, head curved. In order for him to sleep more comfortably, Song Yu adjusted the seat lower for him as he waited at a red light.The day wasn\u2019t very sunny despite raining all through the night. The clouds were very thick and heavy, and the sunshine could only weakly leak through the gaps. Yue Zhishi occasionally coughed as he slept, and he coughed more than when he was awake, unable to repress the coughs in his dreams.Song Yu drove, thinking of the many, many similar questions Yue Zhishi had whispered to him in the cafe.\u201cWhy do you like me?\u201d\u201cWhen did you start liking me?\u201d\u201cWhat do you like about me?\u201dHe hadn\u2019t answered immediately. It wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t have the answers; it was only because he was afraid he wouldn\u2019t be able to give a good enough answer and then disappoint Yue Zhishi.But Song Yu had also wanted to ask those same questions. He wanted to know why Yue Zhishi chose to be together with him \u2014 was it because they\u2019d grown up together? Or was it because he had seen only him since they were children.When talking about treating Yue Zhishi well, Song Yu thought many people would be the same as him, unable to harshly reprimand him. He was kind-hearted, fragile and was born with a pair of eyes that could make someone want to protect him. He was an innocent trap with no shortage of victims willing to sacrifice themselves.When thinking about it, out of all the people who\u2019d jumped in, it was Song Yu who\u2019d been the most indifferent, the one who\u2019d held him at arm\u2019s length the most.There were times when a person\u2019s feelings could truly be unjustifiable and beyond reason.All kinds of colours were blurring together in the grey sky as the flow of traffic converged on the overhead bridges.Feelings could also be blurred very easily. Under the flow of time, love could become familial affection; friendship could also evolve into love. The boundary lines between these feelings were very indistinct, and Song Yu had also wavered on these lines for many sleepless nights.The contradictory thing was \u2014 on one hand, he hoped Yue Zhishi was aware and understood exactly where he stood. On the other hand, he was afraid of Yue Zhishi being so aware.Yue Zhishi started coughing again when they were almost at their destination. He turned his head over towards Song Yu, sleeping very peacefully. Song Yu parked the car and didn\u2019t wake him, simply gazing at him for a while with his hand resting on the steering wheel. He realised Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t really changed from when he was a child; his features had grown up a bit, and his nose had straightened out. But when he was asleep, he still very much felt the same to Song Yu as when he was three years old.Once, in a fit of spite, Song Yu had thought it would\u2019ve been best if Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t arrived at his home when he was three and had stayed in England. Maybe he would\u2019ve travelled to China with Uncle Yue before starting university, staying with the Song family for the summer holiday.That would\u2019ve been their first time meeting. Song Yu would become his tour guide and would take Yue Zhishi to eat all of the local delicacies he\u2019d never tried before.Maybe Yue Zhishi, at that time, would\u2019ve spoken only British English. He wouldn\u2019t be used to eating chili and brown sugar, and would also dislike the fragrance of osmanthus flowers. Maybe he also wouldn\u2019t like him all that much and think he wasn\u2019t friendly enough. But Song Yu \u2014 he thought he would really like Yue Zhishi. He would put in a lot of effort to become his friend in the limited timeframe of one summer, and then logically, naturally pursue him. They would fall passionately in love, would worry over the upcoming separation into different countries, and he would do everything he could do until he obtained approval from Yue Zhishi\u2019s parents.He thought they would agree \u2014 after all, he had once been a small witness to their free love.When Yue Zhishi woke up, he saw Song Yu lost in his thoughts. He looked out the window and touched Song Yu\u2019s arm, very softly calling gege.Song Yu returned to his senses and looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201dIf fate decided to offer him an easier path, Song Yu would most likely choose to give it up solely to be called\u00a0gege, choosing the harder start to his journey with his own free will. He truly did need the unexpected meeting of strangers to lighten his burden, but the three year old Yue Zhishi standing by the door of his room also really needed him. Song Yu thought \u2014 he would forever be unable to close that door, unable to reject that child.The fifteen years of memories were the answer to every question.\u201cTake a bit of cough syrup.\u201d Song Yu opened the bottle, filled up half the cap and handed it to Yue Zhishi.Yue Zhishi really detested this kind of medicine, and he hesitated at taking it, frowning. \u201cBut I\u2019m not coughing anymore.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t give him much of an opportunity to argue, directly placing the cap at his mouth. Yue Zhisi couldn\u2019t escape and could only drink it. He didn\u2019t want to suddenly suffer from a coughing fit as they were shopping \u2014 that would ruin their fun.They had rarely ever shopped together at a supermarket before, unless Lin Rong dragged them to do some Lunar New Year shopping as part of their family\u2019s Lunar New Year celebration activities. Song Yu preferred to work with high efficiency, unable to bear being troubled and disliked wandering around aimlessly while shopping. He would think ahead of time of what he needed to buy and then head in and out rapidly, or else he would be wasting time. But Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t like that \u2014 he liked places filled with the chatter of people, such as the supermarket and home furniture shops. He could stay in those places for an entire day.A man and a woman walked by, clearly a newly married couple. The woman grabbed a candle in excitement and told the young man next to her they could put this in their room \u2014 her words were filled with hope for the future.Yue Zhishi also walked over and grabbed that candle like a copycat, chucking it into Song Yu\u2019s cart without discussing it. He thought Song Yu wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201cWe can\u2019t buy this. Even if we bought it, we couldn\u2019t be able to light it.\u201d Song Yu took it out, placing it back. \u201cWhat if it sets off your asthma.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Yue Zhishi glanced at it in regret. His eyes chased after that couple\u2019s shadows, and he saw they were buying paintings to hang on the wall.\u201cLet\u2019s buy a painting too, your walls are too bare.\u201d Yue Zhishi clutched Song Yu\u2019s arm.Song Yu lowered his head, looking at Yue Zhishi\u2019s slender and pale hand. The curve of his fingernails was very pretty, and there was still a small bruise on the back of his hand from the IV drip needle. He lifted his head to look at him. \u201cDo you know what you look like right now?\u201d\u201cLike what?\u201d\u201cA little student rushing to copy someone else\u2019s homework.\u201dYue Zhishi was dissatisfied with Song Yu\u2019s description of him, but he had no choice but to admit he really was imitating other people and not really looking at what he wanted.Song Yu continued pushing the cart ahead, and Yue Zhishi quickly followed behind him, very frankly saying, \u201cThat\u2019s because this is my first time shopping at a home furniture shop with my boyfriend. Can\u2019t I look at what other people are buying?\u201dHearing a certain unfamiliar title, Song Yu\u2019s cart halted, as if the wheels were suddenly stuck \u2014 it almost slipped out of his hand.Yue Zhishi also stopped. He stared at his face, a bit perplexed.\u201cHave they agreed to you looking at them?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice sounded slightly awkward.Yue Zhishi was a person of action. \u201cI\u2019ll just go ask her then.\u201d He\u2019d just lifted a foot to head over when Song Yu firmly caught his arm.\u201cCome back here. What\u2019s the point of copying her, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s the one I\u2019m dating.\u201d\u00a0 Song Yu didn\u2019t look at Yue Zhishi when he spoke, his voice still just as awkward as before.\u201cJust buy what you like.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s heart suddenly sped up, and he stood in place for a while before he ran after Song Yu again, walking closely next to him.They bought a set of blue-coloured bed linen. They both thought the other person liked the colour blue \u2014 Yue Zhishi kept wearing blue clothes in order to make Song Yu happy. Song Yu, also thinking Yue Zhishi liked blue, couldn\u2019t help but constantly buy blue clothes; he\u2019d give them to Yue Zhishi if he could find a reason to gift them, and if not, he\u2019d keep them himself.Neither of them knew when or how this misunderstanding started, but the two of them inevitably always did the same things under different reasons.A beanbag, beautiful dinnerware, a floor lamp and a rug Yue Zhishi liked \u2014 they bought all of them. They passed through Ikea\u2019s small show rooms, and there was a warm and cozy home already furnished. Yue Zhishi pulled Song Yu in, and they sat at the two ends of a small dining table.\u201cA small table like this is quite nice,\u201d Yue Zhishi said to himself.Song Yu wasn\u2019t happy with it. \u201cIt\u2019s too small.\u201d\u201cA smaller one feels more secure.\u201d Yue Zhishi rested a cheek on his hand, his face turned towards the little sofa in the show room, and said, his voice natural, \u201cI like being able to see you wherever I go.\u201dHis eyelashes were transparent under the lighting, and they seemed to sweep over Song Yu\u2019s heart whenever Yue Zhishi blinked.Five, six more people pushed their way into the show room, and Yue Zhishi pretended to make a fuss, standing up. \u201cNope, there\u2019s too many people at home now. Too crowded.\u201d He pulled Song Yu up as well. \u201cLet\u2019s get some fresh air first.\u201dSong Yu was a bit tickled by his behaviour, but he held back from laughing.\u201cThey all say the food here is really nice.\u201d Yue Zhishi was touching Song Yu\u2019s arm, a very obvious yet very useful strategy.\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be many things you can eat here.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s hand started to slide its way into the sleeve of Song Yu\u2019s sweater, and he held onto Song Yu\u2019s wrist. \u201cJiang Yufan said the Swedish meatballs are really yummy and that they don\u2019t taste like they have flour in them at all. He said there\u2019s a 99% chance they\u2019re made only from meat.\u201dSong Yu wasn\u2019t convinced at all, and he grabbed Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand that was randomly touching him everywhere. \u201cNot up for discussion.\u201dAll of a sudden, Yue Zhishi felt Song Yu was still just as stern and impartial as before \u2014 there was no difference after they started to date. He sighed in despair the entire way, and at the end, he was only able to get an ice cream from outside the checkout area. He even had to give away the rest of it after eating to the cone.But Song Yu bought a milk chocolate bar in blue packaging for him in compensation, and he even hugged him for five seconds in the empty car park. Yue Zhishi cheered up again.All those small, unattainable wishes became insignificant in Song Yu\u2019s arms.As long as Song Yu was willing, he could have an eternally happy Yue Zhishi.Yue Zhishi suddenly wanted to eat hotpot on the way back, and after mumbling about it for a while, Song Yu could only take him to eat a mild and lightly-flavoured\u00a0Chaoshan-style meat hotpot. It was already dusk by the time they returned back to the apartment, and they were just in time to see the most beautiful view out of the living room. As soon as he opened the door, Yue Zhishi made a small noise in wonder \u2014 he took off his shoes and ran to the ceiling to floor window, his two hands placed onto the glass as he gazed out into the shimmering and sparkling lake.The orange-coloured sun was half-submerged into the water, and the rest of it dyed the floating clouds red. The light filtered in through the white floor-length curtains, warming and gentling even the walls.\u201cSo beautiful.\u201dSong Yu watched as Yue Zhishi stood by the window, thinking this entire scene was stunning. The first time he came here, it had been the same time as now; he\u2019d liked the window\u2019s view from the first moment he saw it, and he\u2019d been very certain Yue Zhishi would like it as well. If he liked it, he would be willing to come often.He took out the cream yellow beanbag after he opened the packaging. He stood in the living room and asked Yue Zhishi, \u201cWhere do you want to put this?\u201dYue Zhishi turned around, taking the beanbag out of his hands. \u201cLet\u2019s put it on the balcony.\u201dThey opened up their purchases one by one, and the two of them pulled the dark beige-coloured sofa cover over the leather sofa already in the living room. Song Yu assembled the coffee table and the cabinet, and Yue Zhishi decided where to put the floor lamp, warmth and sweetness slowly filling the empty room.The sky outside the window gradually darkened, the sun completely disappearing into the lake. Once the lamp was turned on, the warmth of its light filled up the entire room.\u201cThis rug is so comfortable.\u201d Yue Zhishi stuffed a piece of the milk chocolate bar into his mouth as he sat on the floor. He stroked the rug, and then he looked over at Song Yu, who was sitting on the sofa. \u201cTry touching it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still not fully recovered yet, don\u2019t sit on the floor.\u201d Song Yu wanted to pull him up, but Yue Zhishi turned around and deliberately, shamelessly flopped onto his lap instead. Yue Zhishi looked at him, face raised, and said in a soft voice, \u201cI\u2019m not cold.\u201dHis light brown eyes seemed to hold the afterglow of the setting sun.Song Yu met his eyes, not speaking for a very long time. He finally couldn\u2019t resist and reached out a hand to stroke Yue Zhishi\u2019s cheeks, his eyes, the upturned corners of his mouth and the red lips still lightly glistening with water.\u201cYou really like touching me.\u201d Yue Zhishi curved his face, actively pushing it into Song Yu\u2019s palm. \u201cYou never used to be like this. I used to think you always disliked and wanted to avoid me.\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201d Song Yu very quickly denied it, but he didn\u2019t say anything further.He didn\u2019t want Yue Zhishi to realise he was actually a paranoid and pessimistic person.\u201cSit up here.\u201d Song Yu once again pulled him up, and Yue Zhishi listened to him this time \u2014 except he misunderstood, and instead of sitting on the sofa, he straddled and sat precisely on top of Song Yu\u2019s legs.Song Yu arched an eyebrow, and Yue Zhishi only then realised what he\u2019d done. \u201cAh,\u201d Yue Zhishi said extremely lightly, his entire face covered by the question of\u00a0can I sit here?\u00a0Seeing Song Yu not speaking, he lifted his legs and prepared to move away. \u201cPardon me\u2026\u2026.\u201dSong Yu chuckled in amusement. He held down Yue Zhishi\u2019s legs, telling him to sit back down, and he folded his arms around Yue Zhishi\u2019s waist very naturally and rested them on his back. Yue Zhishi was wearing a very soft woollen coat and Song Yu\u2019s white t-shirt, and the collar of the shirt was slightly open, revealing his pale collarbones.He was the one who got on first, but Yue Zhishi abruptly felt shy after Song Yu lightly wrapped his arms around him. His ears reddened very quickly, and he didn\u2019t quite sit down fully. \u201cAm I heavy?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Song Yu looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re very skinny. I don\u2019t need that much effort to lift you up horizontally.\u201d He then looked him up and down, his voice questioning, \u201cAre you really 179cm\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t question my height!\u201d Yue Zhishi pressed his two hands to Song Yu\u2019s face, keeping his gaze directly on him. Yue Zhishi\u2019s face was serious. \u201cNo one will use 179cm as their fake height.\u201dSong Yu nodded in understanding. Then he asked, \u201cComfortable?\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t really understand what he was asking, lightly letting out a questioning sound.Song Yu asked more specifically, \u201cAre my legs comfortable, or is the rug more comfortable?\u201dYue Zhishi pursed his lips at this question, but he couldn\u2019t hold back the corners of his mouth from curling upwards. He watched Song Yu, asking, \u201cCan I keep sitting here if I say your legs are more comfortable?\u201d\u201cWho taught you these negotiation skills?\u201d Song Yu asked.\u201cI\u2019m self-taught,\u201d Yue Zhishi replied very proudly. His arms went around Song Yu\u2019s neck by themselves, and he unexpectedly realised they were actually very close \u2014 he could see the fine lines on Song Yu\u2019s lips, as well the perpetually straight corners of his mouth.\u201cSince you told me to sit up here\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi felt very bold all of a sudden, and he used his pair of innocent eyes to look at Song Yu. \u201cCan you let me kiss you?\u201dSong Yu wanted to laugh, and yet he also found it remarkable \u2014 at a time like this, how could someone ask first?\u201cWhat if I object?\u201d\u201cObjection overruled.\u201d Yue Zhishi passed the verdict swiftly, kept his arms around Song Yu\u2019s neck and slightly lowered his head.As Yue Zhishi leaned in, Song Yu could practically smell the fragrance of the milk chocolate on his lips. It was a very mild, sweet flavour with a tinge of bitterness, and it bewitched his mind like a drug, depriving him of his self-control and resolution. He\u2019d initially wanted to use his hands to stop Yue Zhishi from moving, but they clenched tightly around his hips instead and stopped moving.The sky outside the window was now fully dark, the moon meeting the lake \u2014 the tips of their noses pressed against each other, and their breaths blended together.Yue Zhishi was very nervous. He\u2019d thought he had many romantic scenes from movies he could reference, but in this moment, his brain was almost completely blank. It was hard for him to breathe, and it felt like an acute attack, his emotions unable to be restrained.He was worried he wouldn\u2019t be able to kiss well, so he wanted to only lightly press their lips together. He didn\u2019t want to disappoint Song Yu.Their lips were almost about to touch, but then a long, long vibrating noise suddenly came from the sofa and interrupted their movements. Yue Zhishi was startled into coughing, and Song Yu supported his back, lifting up the phone with a frown. The moment he saw the name of the person calling, he once again felt like he was waking up from a dream.He waited until Yue Zhishi was no longer coughing and picked up the call. \u201cMom.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s heart felt like it was suddenly jabbed by something when he heard Song Yu. He got up from Song Yu\u2019s body without thinking and sat back down on the sofa, lips pressed together.The room was very quiet, and he could pretty much hear Lin Rong\u2019s voice. She sounded very anxious, and words such as \u2018fever\u2019 and \u2018where is he\u2019 were faintly audible.\u201cYou\u2019re already on campus?\u201d Song Yu glanced at his watch. He then said, lying, \u201cI\u2019m at the hospital with him right now. No need, we\u2019ll head over to you.\u201dThe phone call ended, and Yue Zhishi asked Song Yu if Aunt Rong had come. Song Yu nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s already on campus. We\u2019ll drive over now.\u201d He caught Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm. \u201cYou never returned her calls, so she looked for Jiang Yufan. He said you had a fever and I took you away. She immediately drove over to see you since she\u2019s so worried.\u201dYue Zhishi felt a bit guilty \u2014 from last night until now, he\u2019d almost forgotten everything else in his joy. He\u2019d pretty much thrown the rest of the world to the back of his mind, leaving only Song Yu in his eyes and in his heart. He sobered up the moment the phone call came: he was a child taken in by Song Yu\u2019s family since he was young, and he\u2019d been brought up by a husband and wife closer to him than even his own parents.\u201cYou haven\u2019t told Aunt Rong you\u2019ve rented an apartment, have you?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked.\u201cNo.\u201d Song Yu stood up. \u201cLet\u2019s go back first. She must be really anxious.\u201dOf course Yue Zhishi understood that \u2014 he was the kind of child adults described as difficult to raise. Aunt Rong used to cry whenever he got sick as a child; now that he was in university, she still sent him messages every night, asking him how he was.He followed Song Yu out, getting into the car, and then asked if he could drive while holding hands.\u201cThat\u2019s against the rules.\u201dYue Zhishi looked out at the dark road in front of them. He whispered, \u201cWe\u2019re already breaking the rules anyway.\u201dSong Yu fell into silence for a few seconds, and then he ended up holding Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand anyway. The interior of the car was a very private space, and they held hands while inside, letting go after they left the car. With ten centimetres separating them, they walked together to where the shadows of the trees landed in front of the dormitory building.Yue Zhishi could tell Lin Rong had driven over in a panic. She wasn\u2019t wearing any makeup, and she wore a beige windbreaker as she stood in front of the building, chatting with the auntie in charge of the dorm. A polite smile was on her elegant face. He walked over, calling out her name.Lin Rong immediately turned around once she heard Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice, and worry covered her face the moment she saw him. She threw her arms around him, her hand repeatedly stroking his back. \u201cMy poor baby, Xiao Fan said you had a high fever. I was so scared when he said you were delirious. Let me look at you.\u201d She looked up and touched Yue Zhishi\u2019s forehead. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like you have a fever anymore. You just got an IV drip, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay now, Aunt Rong.\u201d Yue Zhishi smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I caught a cold from the constantly changing temperature the last few days. I only got a fever afterwards, when the water wouldn\u2019t warm up when I was showering. The fever\u2019s been gone the entire day today.\u201d He hugged Lin Rong again after he finished speaking.Yue Zhishi had actually missed her a bit \u2014 with this hug, he suddenly wanted to cry. He didn\u2019t know why.\u201cYou can\u2019t shower when you have a cold.\u201d Lin Rong continued stroking his back. \u201cHave you taken some medicine? Are you coughing?\u201dThe dorm auntie couldn\u2019t help but chuckle as she watched Yue Zhishi hug Lin Rong. \u201cAiyah, you\u2019re still so clingy with your mom even though you\u2019re grown up already.\u201dYue Zhishi only then pulled away. He straightened up his body and said he really was okay now.Lin Rong turned and pulled Yue Zhishi over to the dorm auntie, an apologetic look on her face. \u201cSister, my youngest son\u2019s body is really weak, he gets sick very easily. Most people can just wait for their colds to go away, but this child of mine can\u2019t cough at all \u2014 his asthma might flare up once he starts coughing, and it\u2019s really dangerous.\u201dShe looked over again and waved over Song Yu, who had been standing to one side. \u201cThis is his older brother. He studies here too, in geomatics. I know it\u2019s not easy for you to let random people in and out of the dorms, but my son\u2019s a special case. His brother is very clear about his conditions, and he can take care of him. I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could let him through when necessary and let them look after each other.\u201d\u201cYou have such good luck to have two such handsome sons. They really look like you.\u201d The dorm auntie agreed very freely and took out a form for Song Yu to fill in.\u201cHurry and sign, it\u2019ll be easier for you to come over,\u201d Lin Rong urged.Song Yu held the pen, filling in his major and ID number like they requested. The final sections he needed to complete were his relationship with the person he was visiting and the signature block. The dorm auntie helpfully said, \u201cJust write \u2018brother\u2019 and then write down your name.\u201d\u201cMn.\u201dSong Yu wrote down the word \u2018brother\u2019 and his name, the words scribbling together.\u201cCome home with me, Le Le.\u201d Lin Rong pulled at his hand. \u201cLook at how cold your hand is. It\u2019s Sunday tomorrow, and you can take the next day off too. I\u2019ll drive you back after.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t know what to say. Song Yu put down his pen. \u201cHe\u2019s almost nineteen. He can\u2019t keep running back home as soon as he\u2019s sick. I\u2019ll take care of him at school.\u201d\u201cThen you really have to look after your little brother.\u201d Lin Rong was still worried, and she looked at Yue Zhishi. \u201cI talked to Xiao Fan just then, and I already left some medicine in your dorm. I put your asthma inhaler under your pillow. Remember, you can\u2019t sleep too deeply at night, if you feel like you can\u2019t breathe, you need to use it, okay?\u201d\u201cUncle wanted to come too, but he\u2019s out of the city right now and couldn\u2019t come.\u201d Lin Rong squeezed his hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been away from home before. It doesn\u2019t take long to drive over, so tell me if anything happens \u2014 or get your brother to help you. Okay?\u201dYue Zhishi nodded the entire time, and he couldn\u2019t help but hug her again.People came in and out of the dorm entrance, and Lin Rong started to laugh. \u201cAiyah, don\u2019t let other people see you like this. They\u2019ll tease you.\u201d\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to go home with me?\u201d\u201cReally, I\u2019m fine. I still have class on Monday.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice was very quiet.\u201cAll right, then.\u201d Lin Rong surrendered. Song Yu and Yue Zhishi walked with her to where she parked her car, and Lin Rong kept giving instructions the entire way, worried Yue Zhishi would suffer while at school. Song Yu followed behind them, listening to them speak without talking. Lin Rong twisted her head over. \u201cHow come it feels like your brother\u2019s not in a good mood today?\u201dYue Zhishi said, slightly guilty, \u201cNot really?\u201dLin Rong chuckled. \u201cHe must be jealous because I\u2019m only caring about you.\u201d She tugged at Song Yu, crooking her arm around his. \u201cSon, let me say something. Studying is really important, but it\u2019s also really important to live. Be a bit happier. If you\u2019re happy, mom will be able to relax.\u201dSong Yu nodded. \u201cHurry and go home. It\u2019s not safe at night, make sure you drive carefully.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Mom was in too much of a rush today, I don\u2019t look like a beautiful rich lady at all. Right, Le Le?\u201d Lin Rong joked. She embraced them each for a while. \u201cBoth of you need to be well.\u201dYue Zhishi watched as Lin Rong\u2019s car drove off and out of sight. He suddenly felt a bit afraid, and he tilted up his head, glancing at Song Yu. In the dark of the night, the side of his face looked a bit cold.He opened his mouth, subconsciously wanting to call out gege, but Yue Zhishi held the words back.\u201cHead up first,\u201d Song Yu said.Yue Zhishi became somewhat flustered. \u201cDoes that mean I can\u2019t live at your place tonight?\u201dSong Yu turned his face to him, his face slightly softening. \u201cI mean, head up to get your phone and clothes to change into. You can\u2019t wear my clothes tomorrow too.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s tightly clenched heart fractionally eased. The next second, he heard Song Yu ask, his voice very, very low.\u201cAre you scared?\u201dThe author has something to say:Mom is a very good person. I\u2019m scared you guys are worried, so let me say it again \u2014 their coming out won\u2019t be a massive fight (of course, mom will definitely be hurt for a while)Time to start their secret relationship~ (I really like dating relationships with sneaky, hidden bits)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He gazed at Song Yu, and he looked slightly helpless \u2014 but the words that left his mouth were very firm. \u201cI\u2019m not scared.\u201dSong Yu had already guessed Yue Zhishi would reply that way. He truly was a very stubborn child.And then, Yue Zhishi lowered his eyes very quickly. \u201cI just feel a bit\u2026 distressed. I don\u2019t have the courage to look at her.\u201dHe thought of Lin Rong as his own mother, and he didn\u2019t want to hurt her at all.The moment he\u2019d seen Lin Rong, he remembered the jokes Lin Rong had once said about Song Yu dating. Even though she\u2019d been teasing him, it was very obvious she hoped Song Yu could find a girl he liked and happily, peacefully spend their lives together.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know what he should do.\u201cDon\u2019t think about it anymore.\u201d Song Yu saw the worry on his face. He wasn\u2019t willing to leave these complicated issues to him; they weren\u2019t Yue Zhishi\u2019s fault to begin with. \u201cLet\u2019s just head up to your dorm first.\u201d\u201cMn.\u201dThe dorm auntie warmly greeted them when they returned back to the dormitory building. \u201cYour mom left?\u201dYue Zhishi responded quietly, \u201cYes, she\u2019s gone home.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let your mom worry about you getting sick. She almost fell when she came in.\u201dYue Zhishi saw the pastries Lin Rong gave her \u2014 the packaging was easily recognisable. He could also imagine Lin Rong tripping and falling as she rushed in. She was sometimes very careless when she walked, and he was very similar to her that way.With Lin Rong\u2019s request, Song Yu was allowed to go upstairs together with Yue Zhishi, and he was able to enter his dormitory whenever he liked.It\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t know \u2014 he knew that as long as he signed the registration form and clearly expressed who he was, he could easily come to Yue Zhishi\u2019s dorm to take care of him. But he really needed a reason to have a space where he could be alone with Yue Zhishi, so he ended up renting an apartment without asking, lying to himself and pretending to others.Luckily, fortunately, Yue Zhishi also liked him \u2014 at least for now. Or else he really would\u2019ve made a decision based on too much one-sided wishful thinking.It was Sunday, and there was no one else in the dorm. Yue Zhishi opened the door, turned on the light and crawled onto his own bed, grabbing his phone next to his pillow and also seeing the inhaler Lin Rong had left.His mood wasn\u2019t very good. He came down from his bed, taking two sets of his own clothes from his wardrobe before putting them into his schoolbag, and also took his laptop and the turquoise stone Song Yu had given him.Standing in front of Yue Zhishi\u2019s desk, Song Yu noticed the chicken soup Lin Rong had spent time and effort in making \u2014 as well as the little snacks and pastries she\u2019d left onto each desk of Yue Zhishi\u2019s dorm mates. They were all placed neatly.These same habits of hers were telling him \u2014 Yue Zhishi was also a \u2018son\u2019 Lin Rong had raised.In a complicated mood, Song Yu could feel his body going slightly numb. He\u2019d hidden from everyone all of those little thoughts he\u2019d had in the past, and over the course of time, it had become habit to continue hiding. He had learned to digest and absorb those feelings by himself.But right now, he was no longer alone. He\u2019d promised to treasure Yue Zhishi, but that decision seemed to have also pulled Yue Zhishi into the abyss of self-blame and torment. Song Yu couldn\u2019t adjust, all of a sudden; he didn\u2019t know what was the right direction to take.\u201cI\u2019ve finished packing.\u201d Seeing Song Yu lost in his thoughts, Yue Zhishi stretched out a hand and touched his fingers, briefly squeezing the tips. He softly said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dSong Yu said okay, and then he took Yue Zhishi\u2019s bag, driving them back to that secret apartment. The entire way there, the two of them tacitly avoided mentioning what had just happened. Song Yu played a soothing piece of piano music, and it covered up the silence in the car.Yue Zhishi checked his phone: there was a startling number of over ten missed calls, as well as the WeChat messages his friends had sent. A strong desire to avoid everything swept over him, and he turned off the screen, not looking at a single message. All at once, at this very moment, he really wanted Song Yu to drive and take him away, fleeing and hiding in a place no one could find.But this bad idea lasted only for a few seconds before Yue Zhishi gave it up. He wasn\u2019t willing to snatch Song Yu away, and he also wasn\u2019t willing to leave behind Lin Rong and Song Jin.After he calmed down, Yue Zhishi sincerely replied to every single message, one by one, and then made the decision to turn off his phone.The apartment wasn\u2019t far from campus, and they arrived very quickly. The lights in the underground car park were very dim, and Yue Zhishi followed behind Song Yu into the elevator after getting out of the car. He sneezed once in the elevator, so Song Yu lightly held onto his waist.The inside of the apartment was pitch-black once they opened the door, as if it was no longer that beautiful, warm place from that afternoon. Song Yu reached out a hand, wanting to flick the light switch next to the door, but Yue Zhishi held him back. Song Yu wanted to ask him what was wrong, but in the next second, Yue Zhishi was hugging him, his face buried into his collarbones. He didn\u2019t say anything, and yet he seemed to be comforting Song Yu with this embrace.The strange thing was \u2014 it was as if they naturally, logically deserved to be in the dark.Yue Zhishi\u2019s arms were crossed behind Song Yu\u2019s back, and they stroked up and down very lightly, trying to ease Song Yu\u2019s tense mood. He spoke only after a long while passed. \u201cI\u2019m hungry. We should have the soup.\u201dSong Yu said sure and turned on the light.The chicken soup held\u00a0red dates\u00a0and\u00a0goji berries, as well as nourishing ginger and\u00a0fish maw. The soup shined golden, and the familiar fragrance of it wafted into their faces as soon as they lifted the lid. Yue Zhishi took out their newly bought porcelain bowls and soup spoons, pouring the soup into them after he washed them. He thought of his childhood once he took a small sip \u2014 his body had been weak, and with so many things he\u2019d been unable to eat, Lin Rong had delivered food to his school every day up until he graduated elementary school. She\u2019d accompanied him every day in the cafeteria, waiting for him to finish eating.There was no one who didn\u2019t envy him for having such a beautiful \u2018mom\u2019 who could cook. So the younger Yue Zhishi, when he was outside, didn\u2019t call her Aunt Rong; he\u2019d delighted in having other people praising his mother as being so talented.This pitiful sense of pride truly did satisfy Yue Zhishi as a child.\u201cHave some more.\u201d Song Yu placed a chicken drumstick, stewed until it was falling to pieces, into his bowl.Yue Zhishi watched Song Yu, vaguely wondering if he\u2019d made a wrong choice \u2014 should he have kept hidden the fact that he liked him? Would it have been better for everyone if he\u2019d held on for a bit?Time flowed exceedingly slowly in the quiet air of the room. Yue Zhishi really wanted to say something to cheer Song Yu up, but Song Yu kept speaking, saying he needed to remember to take his medicine, he\u2019ll check his temperature in a bit, he needed to remember to message his mom \u2014 he spoke as he stood by the sink, washing the dishes.Song Yu usually didn\u2019t speak so much; he\u2019d always been the quietest one. Contrarily enough, his speaking so much made Yue Zhishi uneasy. His thoughts were very messy, and his heart was also confused. He had been too naive: he\u2019d thought he entered heaven just by being able to be together with Song Yu, but once he returned back to reality, he realised this heaven was very likely to be hell for the people they loved.This must be why Song Yu had always kept silent about his feelings.That entire night, Yue Zhishi listened to Song Yu\u2019s instructions very peacefully. He took his meds, cleaned up, and when he returned back to his room, the blanket Song Yu had brought into his room last night was missing. He couldn\u2019t help but be a bit disappointed, but he didn\u2019t want to create a larger burden for Song Yu \u2014 so he kept silent.He lay on the bed, messaging Lin Rong to say the chicken soup was very delicious and to ask whether she\u2019d safely returned home.Lin Rong replied swiftly, and she even sent over a photo of Cotton Candy and Orange cuddling together in sleep.[Aunt Rong: Has your brother cheered up a bit?]Yue Zhishi said very honestly, he didn\u2019t seem to have.Lin Rong replied once again very quickly.[Aunt Rong: You should coax your brother a bit. He always likes to be by himself whenever he\u2019s not happy, and that really worries me. He\u2019s grown up now, and he\u2019s not willing to tell mom anything anymore. Luckily he still has you by his side \u2014 he laughs and smiles more when he\u2019s with you. It would be nice if he could rely on us a bit more like you do.]Reading Lin Rong\u2019s words, Yue Zhishi thought for a few seconds.[Le Le: Aunt Rong, one day, if you feel like gege or I hurt you, can you not be angry with him? You can just be angry with me \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter if you want to hit me or yell at me. Gege really, really loves you. I really love you too, but if we did something wrong, it would definitely be my fault.]Lin Rong rapidly responded.[Aunt Rong: What are you talking about, have you done something you\u2019re too scared to tell me? But there shouldn\u2019t be, the two of you are such good children. You need to tell me if you\u2019re not happy, I\u2019ll help you guys fix it. What\u2019s the point in having parents otherwise? And I know you guys both really love me, really love dad \u2014 I\u2019ll never be angry with you guys.]After a little while, he received another message.[Aunt Rong: I\u2019ll be angry just for a little bit at most. You guys can just sweet talk me and I\u2019ll be fine.]Yue Zhishi sniffed.[Le Le: Mn. Love you <3]His nose was originally already quite blocked, and now it was even more uncomfortable after wanting to cry. He really needed some tissues, so he got off his bed and searched around his room before remembering he saw some earlier that day in the living room. Planning on going to get it, he cautiously opened his door. He saw Song Yu in the living room and didn\u2019t go directly downstairs, hesitating.He hesitated because he saw Song Yu take out a medicine bottle of some kind from the white low cabinet next to the sofa. Song Yu tapped out one pill into his hand and swallowed it down with some cold water.Yue Zhishi frowned, thinking Song Yu might\u2019ve also gotten sick. He was very worried, so he took another look at the bottle \u2014 that bottle looked very familiar. Seeing Song Yu about to turn around, Yue Zhishi retreated back into his room a bit guiltily and shut the door. He leaned against it, listening to Song Yu\u2019s footsteps as he softly climbed up the stairs, dull noises coming from the wood.He didn\u2019t know if he was imagining it, but it felt like Song Yu\u2019s footsteps paused in front of his door for a few seconds. His heart started racing, and yet those steps didn\u2019t stop, continuing until they reached the room next door.Yue Zhishi abruptly remembered why the bottle looked familiar. He\u2019d seen that bottle on Song Yu\u2019s desk before, the packaging exactly the same, and Song Yu had told him it was melatonin and hadn\u2019t allowed him to try it.In hindsight, he took out his phone and searched up the effects of taking that particular hormone.[To a certain extent, taking melatonin can help alleviate sleeping disorders and relieve insomnia.]A thin pang of pain threaded through Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart once he saw those words. He continued scrolling downwards, reading through everything that had to do with this hormone.Time flowed very quickly at night. The lake outside the glass windows was tranquil \u2014 Yue Zhishi looked towards it, and his own anxious face reflected back at him on the transparent glass, as if the lake was also gazing at him.Ten minutes later, after trying his best to persuade himself to not disturb Song Yu, Yue Zhishi finally couldn\u2019t hold back. He put on some socks, worried his slippers would make too much noise, and lightly, gently opened the door. He walked next door and pretty much spent over thirty seconds turning the door handle, doing his best to not make any sound.Song Yu\u2019s room was always very dark, very quiet, like a bomb shelter completely cut off from everything. He liked having the curtains drawn tightly together without a single shred of light allowed to come through. Yue Zhishi groped his way in through the dark, very, very carefully searching his way ahead, and his eyes rapidly adapted to the darkness. Seeing Song Yu\u2019s bed, he inched closer.But he was still caught.Song Yu reached out a hand, turning on the bedside lamp. The inside of the room immediately brightened, and Yue Zhishi was like a foolish thief caught in the act, standing next to the bed in shock. He somewhat awkwardly stared at Song Yu.\u201cWhy\u2019d you come over? Do you feel unwell?\u201d Song Yu shifted up, looking at him.In this moment, Yue Zhishi really, really wanted to be a little dog like Cotton Candy. He could stealthily run in and then jump lightly onto the bed, snuggling next to Song Yu\u2019s body without disturbing him. His eyes faintly stinging, he walked over and sat onto Song Yu\u2019s bed.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t feel sick.\u201d Yue Zhishi explained himself. \u201cI didn\u2019t come over to cling to you.\u201dSong Yu gazed at him, his eyebrows drawn from the light faintly relaxing. He pulled out a hand from his blanket and covered Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrist with it, his fingertips cold. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to cling to me anymore?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d Yue Zhishi felt like he was being misunderstood, so he quickly denied it. He turned the light down to its dimmest, lay down next to Song Yu\u2019s body and placed a hand onto him. \u201cI came here with a mission.\u201d\u201cWhat mission?\u201d\u201cTo soothe you to sleep.\u201d Yue Zhishi looked a bit proud.The corners of Song Yu\u2019s mouth curled up a touch. He didn\u2019t speak. Yue Zhishi then said, \u201cI\u2019m really good at it. Every time Orange lies on my leg, he falls asleep with just a casual touch or two from me.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re here to also touch me casually?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice sounded a bit sluggish, deep and pleasing to the ears.Yue Zhishi shook his head. \u201cNot casually. I\u2019ll try my best to soothe you to sleep.\u201d He started performing his duties once he finished speaking, very gently patting Song Yu\u2019s shoulder. Worried he\u2019d be cold, Song Yu pulled him under his blanket.\u201cYour hand\u2019s so cold.\u201d Yue Zhishi was slightly dissatisfied. Whenever he remembered that one of the side effects of melatonin was a drop in body temperature, he\u2019d feel upset \u2014 he clutched Song Yu\u2019s hand with his free hand, covering it with his own.Song Yu focused on his face and quietly asked, \u201cWhy\u2019d you come here to soothe me to sleep?\u201dYue Zhishi replied truthfully, \u201cI saw you taking melatonin. I looked it up just now, and I only just realised it\u2019s to relieve insomnia.\u201d He raised his eyes, his eyelashes faintly trembling. \u201cYou often can\u2019t sleep, right?\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t answer him, and his silence stretched until he saw a layer of tears floating on Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes. He only then said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that normal \u2014 a lot of people these days can\u2019t sleep at night. They like staying up late.\u201d\u201cWanting to stay up late isn\u2019t the same as wanting to sleep and not being able to fall asleep.\u201d In the end, Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but wrap his arms around Song Yu. \u201cIf it\u2019s not serious, why would you take melatonin? And you can\u2019t take it long-term, it has so many side effects. You\u2019ll get addicted to it, and it might even cause mild anxiety and temporary depression.\u201dHe called out gege once, his voice a little whiny. \u201cCan you not take it anymore?\u201dSeeing Yue Zhishi so worried, seeing him holding him so tightly \u2014 Song Yu could only agree. \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t use it anymore.\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t sleep, I\u2019ll stay with you.\u201d Yue Zhishi spoke seriously, earnestly. \u201cI\u2019ll buy a book and read it to you, I can recite the civil legislation to you, as well as the criminal\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need for that,\u201d Song Yu chuckled, very lightly.The taut string in Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart marginally loosened after he heard Song Yu laugh. He lifted his head to look at Song Yu\u2019s eyes. \u201cI can read whatever you want.\u201dSong Yu thought for a while, and then, as if he had a really good idea: \u201cYour diaries from first to sixth grade.\u201dImmediately, an uneasy expression covered Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. \u201cBut that\u2019s private\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it then,\u201d Song Yu said. \u201cJust let me continue to lose sleep.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay it\u2019s okay,\u201d Yue Zhishi hurriedly agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll bring them all over once I find them, I\u2019ll read them to you.\u201d He stroked Song Yu\u2019s back. \u201cI hope you won\u2019t laugh to the point you won\u2019t be able to sleep after I read them to you. The things I wrote when I was younger probably weren\u2019t too normal.\u201d\u201cSuch as wishing for all the wheat in the universe to go completely extinct and so everyone won\u2019t be able to eat it?\u201d\u201cHow\u2019d you know!\u201d Yue Zhishi widened his eyes in shock. \u201cDid you peek?\u201d\u201cMom accidentally saw it when she was bringing you a night snack, and then she sneakily told me.\u201d\u201cHow could you guys be like that\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi found it embarrassing to have been secretly laughed at for so long.Song Yu\u2019s mouth lifted gently, and he looked a little happier than before. Just with this, Yue Zhishi was already very satisfied, and he nuzzled his face into the side of Song Yu\u2019s neck. \u201cI want you to be happy every day.\u201d\u201cNo one is happy every day,\u201d Song Yu answered negatively.Yue Zhishi brought out a counter-example. \u201cI\u2019m happy every day whenever I\u2019m with you. Being happy for one hour is still being happy.\u201dHis voice dropped as he finished speaking; he buried himself into Song Yu\u2019s shoulder, silent for a while.Thinking he wasn\u2019t going to speak anymore, Song Yu wanted to urge him back to his room to sleep.\u201cGege.\u201d Yue Zhishi still ended up opening his mouth, his voice muffled in between their arms.\u201cIf you\u2019ll suffer a lot by being with me, tell me, okay? I won\u2019t demand to stay next to you.\u201dThe room was very quiet. He could hear Song Yu\u2019s heartbeats as they thudded against his chest. He didn\u2019t know how much time passed before Song Yu finally gave him an answer.\u201cBy being together with you, I have both happiness and suffering.\u201d His voice was slightly hoarse. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m pulling out the glorious parts of my life early, leaving behind only a deficit \u2014 and yet I still want it, very badly.\u201dYue Zhishi held onto him, wanting to give him some kind of comfort or relief, but very quickly, he heard Song Yu continue.\u201cBut if you leave me, I might be left with only suffering.\u201dA great wave of pain and unwillingness washed over Yue Zhishi at these words. He felt like Song Yu was very different from usual \u2014 or maybe it was because he\u2019d never seen Song Yu like this before. He was like a cat who knew only how to lick its own injuries; he always turned around proudly, giving Yue Zhishi the appearance of a strong and steadfast back.\u201cEven though I promised you and said we could give it a try,\u201d Song Yu was caressing Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair, \u201cin reality, you hold all the power. If you\u2019re scared and don\u2019t want to hurt anyone, you can withdraw any time you want. We can still go back to our relationship from before.\u201dHe then added, \u201cI\u2019ll still treat you very well.\u201dHis gentle, kind words sounded like he was trying to talk some sense into Yue Zhishi, but Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want it; he didn\u2019t want to be treated as a child, especially after learning Song Yu would be in agony without him.\u201cI definitely won\u2019t withdraw after you said something like that.\u201d His voice held a bit of spite. \u201cIf I really did leave you, we won\u2019t be able to go back to before. You can\u2019t treat me well either \u2014 if you do, I\u2019ll just burst into tears right in front of your face.\u201d\u201cWhen I\u2019m together with you, you\u2019ll hug me while I sleep. You\u2019ll touch my face, kiss my arm, smile at me so gently \u2014 now that I\u2019ve experienced all of that, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able to accept it if we one day change back to how we were like before.\u201dSong Yu laughed bitterly. \u201cThen what would you do?\u201dYue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help it; a tear rolled down, and he pushed his face in, not wanting Song Yu to see.\u201cI\u2019d leave all of you behind, and hide in a place no one can find.\u201dBut before he left, he\u2019d take away the little stone Song Yu had given him, as well as the mathematics textbook Song Yu had once recited to him. That textbook was truly hard to understand, but one lifetime was a very long time. He\u2019d definitely be able to learn how to read it by himself.\u201cWill you spend your whole life by yourself?\u201d Song Yu asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Yue Zhishi thought \u2014 did he come across very heartless this way? Should he act like one of those foolish, love-struck men and women in dramas and movies who died for love in order to look like he really did like Song Yu? So he explained, \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t live very long. I should live a few more decades in their place.\u201dHe spoke very flippantly, as if he was joking, but Song Yu abruptly hugged him very tightly, almost as if he wanted to draw him into his own body. But very soon, he loosened his hold.\u201cThere\u2019s no way someone can live by himself.\u201dThis sentence had no clear reference to anyone, and at first, Yue Zhishi thought Song Yu was speaking about him. He later felt Song Yu was talking about himself.\u201cSo you can\u2019t tell me to go.\u201d Yue Zhishi kissed the side of his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t treat me like a child anymore. I\u2019m already grown up, and no matter what happens, I can bear it with you.\u201d\u201cI know I did something I shouldn\u2019t have. When I saw Aunt Rong today, I felt like I committed a terrible crime. They treat me so well, bringing me up like their own child, and yet I\u2019ve snatched you away from them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Song Yu said.Yue Zhishi corrected his words. \u201cIt\u2019s not solely your fault either.\u201dSlightly lifting up his head, he kissed Song Yu\u2019s chin and gazed at him. \u201cYou said being with me gives you both happiness and suffering. If you\u2019re left with only suffering after leaving me, then there\u2019s no way I can leave you by yourself. You should keep that happiness, and give the suffering to me.\u201d\u201cAs long as I have you, even suffering turns into happiness.\u201dSong Yu really couldn\u2019t understand it; where did Yue Zhishi find these warm and tender emotions from? In attempting to absorb all of his negative thoughts, Yue Zhishi was like a plant sucking in carbon dioxide and then releasing a steady stream of oxygen in return \u2014 all just so he could smile.Yue Zhishi was an extraordinary, special substance in his life. The energy he gave him was large and beyond measure.\u201cAll right.\u201d Song Yu was forever unable to reject him, and so he simply gave up resisting.\u201cI said I was going to treasure you. Until you make another choice, I won\u2019t run away by myself.\u201d\u201cThere is no other choice.\u201d Yue Zhishi was very firm. \u201cAs long as you need me.\u201dSong Yu clasped Yue Zhishi to him, hugging him as closely and inseparably as though he was hugging a toy. Their skin connected, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s warmth slowly and gradually seeped into Song Yu, his body finally able to relax. While patting his back, Yue Zhishi talked to him about the things they\u2019d done together when they were children: the lotus seeds they\u2019d plucked, the loquats they\u2019d planted; the endless summers in the\u00a0sunflower field\u00a0and botanical gardens at Jiangtan Park. He spoke until his voice faded, little by little, and his hand slowly stopped moving.The deeply anxious heart he had for Song Yu \u2014 it lulled into peace slower than his consciousness, and it extended into his dreams.The next day, Yue Zhishi had a low fever again. He didn\u2019t know if it was because he was blown by some wind last night, but Song Yu took him to the hospital, getting him to sit through two hours of IV drips. Song Yu sat next to him, writing a paper, and he leaned on Song Yu\u2019s shoulder quietly as he read manga on his phone and occasionally chatted to Jiang Yufan. Song Yu sometimes glanced at him while he chatted, and he saw Jiang Yufan showing off his relationship by sending through quite a few photos of him and his girlfriend.It was time for dinner by the time they came out. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t have much of an appetite, eating slowly and sparingly. Dinner only finished after Song Yu urged him to finish a bowl of\u00a0pork rib and lotus root soup.\u201cCan we not go home immediately? I want to go to a place on campus.\u201dSong Yu gave him a look. \u201cAnd then get another IV drip tomorrow?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t catch a cold again.\u201d Yue Zhishi smoothly transferred the responsibility onto him, murmuring, \u201cWho knows, maybe it was because you stole my blanket\u2026\u201dSong Yu crooked his head down and stared at him, not saying a word.\u201cDefinitely not, I kicked off the blanket myself.\u201d Yue Zhishi touched his arm. \u201cYou can sleep pressing me down today. Then I definitely won\u2019t be able to kick away the blanket.\u201dSomeone walked past them \u2014 Song Yu clapped a hand over Yue Zhishi\u2019s mouth, not releasing his hand until that person disappeared.\u201cWhat stuff are you saying?\u201d His voice sounded awkward again, and Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t understand why.He may have said no, but Song Yu still ended up following Yue Zhishi to where he wanted to go. They walked around the campus for a very long time, relying entirely on Yue Zhishi\u2019s GPS; they walked further away the more they walked.\u201cTell me where you want to go and I\u2019ll take you there,\u201d Song Yu finally said, unable to hold back.Focused on his phone, Yue Zhishi waved his hand at him. \u201cYou definitely don\u2019t know where it is. One hundred percent.\u201d\u201cCold reminder: I\u2019m fourth year, and you are a first year new student.\u201d\u201cShh.\u201d Without even lifting his head, Yue Zhishi reached out, trying to cover Song Yu\u2019s mouth. He didn\u2019t get to reach before his hand ended up getting caught.They finally found it at the end. There was a small walking road made of stone on the Lion Mountain behind the rooftops usually spread with cherry blossoms. The road started at the bottom of the mountain. Barely any people were here, and Yue Zhishi clutched Song Yu\u2019s wrist, more excited than if he\u2019d journeyed to the west and found scriptures. \u201cIt\u2019s here, we found it!\u201dSong Yu frowned in doubt. There were countless amounts of little mountain roads like these in Wuhan U \u2014 he usually would never even think about taking them. They weren\u2019t convenient, and they also took forever to reach anywhere.\u201cSo? If you wanted to reach the rooftops, there are many other ways\u2026\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t wait for him to finish, immediately crouching down and pointing at the ground. \u201cGege, look.\u201dSong Yu looked down, only then noticing the many cobblestones inlaid onto the ground. They formed\u00a0six very clear characters, and Yue Zhishi read them out. \u201cPlease enter the road of love!\u201dSong Yu suddenly wanted to laugh. \u201cDid Jiang Yufan tell you about this?\u201dYue Zhishi stood back up. \u201cHe said his girlfriend took him here last week, that it was very meaningful.\u201d He said to himself softly, \u201cI like stones.\u201dWith that, he tugged at Song Yu. \u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s enter the road of love.\u201dSong Yu had thought he would never do something so childish his entire life, but not only did he do it, he was even a bit happy about doing it. They walked closely next to each other, heading upwards one step at a time.Other than the six characters at the beginning, there were also many classic Chinese poems, as well as love poems. They were all written out through the cobblestones, and Yue Zhishi said he heard a teacher made their students do it as extra-curricular work in the eighties.\u201cThis teacher was so romantic.\u201d Yue Zhishi said, \u201cEven the characters are laid out so cutely.\u201d He abruptly saw a translucent yellow cobblestone. \u201cThis one\u2019s really nice, it looks just like a piece of jade.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s hand was loosely resting on his shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019s a chalcedony stone formed from colloidal silica. Parts of it are blue due to the presence of copper.\u201dYue Zhishi glared at him. \u201cIt sounds so complicated now that you explained it.\u201dSong Yu raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. \u201cScience reveals the true nature of romance.\u201d\u201cFine, I can\u2019t argue with you.\u201d Yue Zhishi took him past the characters spelling out the name of their city, strolled past the\u00a0lush grass on the plains, withers and thrives once each year, and the\u00a0as long as two feelings remain to same, why do they need to stay together day and night. After a moment, Yue Zhishi froze \u2014 he said to the ground, \u201cThey wrote it out wrong, it should be\u00a0remain the same.\u201dThey walked up the hill bit by bit, and very soon, the two of them reached the end of the road. Green trees surrounded them, and there was no one else to disturb them.\u201cWe\u2019ve reached the end.\u201d Yue Zhishi slightly hopped in place, and he pointed at the characters on the floor, saying to Song Yu, \u201cLook.\u201dThe unremarkable cobblestones on the ground spelled out simple characters, and yet those characters seemed to carry the weight of the many years in between them.\u201cTime passed, deep affection grows,\u201d Song Yu softly read.Since no one else was there, Yue Zhishi took his hand. \u201cSince we\u2019ve already journeyed through the road of love, we have lots of experience now. Don\u2019t worry, everything will get better.\u201dSong Yu couldn\u2019t hold back his smile. \u201cWhat experience do you even have\u2026\u201dYue Zhishi suddenly popped upwards, just as his words left his mouth; he very lightly, very quickly pecked at his lips \u2014 it was just like the autumn days in this city, transient and glorious.He nervously retreated back to a safe location, and he also let go of Song Yu\u2019s hand, looking around him in a fluster with his lips pressed together.\u201cThe experience of my first kiss,\u201d Yue Zhishi stammered, his voice without any confidence.The setting sun fell gently onto his face, turning his soft hair into a glimmering gold. His ears were red, the rays of the sun shining through the semi-translucent flesh \u2014 the capillaries were faintly visible, and his ears looked just like golden sea shells. Song Yu could look nowhere else; he hoped the shadows of night would arrive later, because this was truly beautiful and breathtaking.And yet he also hoped the sky would darken right that moment \u2014 so that in the dark corners of the night, he could hold Yue Zhishi in his arms.\u201cAre you unsatisfied?\u201d A bit of chagrin covered Yue Zhishi\u2019s face as he lifted his head. \u201cYou must definitely be unsatisfied.\u201dSong Yu stuffed his two hands into the pockets of his trench coat, looking entirely at ease. \u201cMaybe a bit.\u201d\u201cThen can I try again? That one didn\u2019t count.\u201dSong Yu took one step ahead, the distance between them shortened to zero. Their chests were right on top of each other, and he said, \u201cSure.\u201dYue Zhishi glanced around again, and then he swiftly kissed him for the second time before he retreated half a step. He very earnestly questioned, \u201cHow was that?\u201dHis romantic partner was very hard to satisfy; his mouth curved upwards slightly again, but he still shook his head. \u201cStill not good enough.\u201dYue Zhishi realised he might have dug a pit for himself. \u201cI feel like you won\u2019t be satisfied no matter what I do.\u201dSong Yu raised his eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll give you many, many chances.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 60: A Perfect Exam PaperYue Zhishi rested in the apartment the last few days a bit too well \u2014 he originally didn\u2019t really lack sleep to begin with, and yet Song Yu turned him into someone with the habits of a long sleeper.Knowing Yue Zhishi had a general education class at 10am, Song Yu got up at 7:30 and went out to the breakfast stalls outside the apartment\u2019s neighbourhood, buying the\u00a0osmanthus wine flavoured egg soup\u00a0and\u00a0fish porridge noodles\u00a0Yue Zhishi liked. It was already 8am by the time he got back; he put down the breakfast items and entered Yue Zhishi\u2019s room, sitting on the edge of the bed. His hair all fluffed up and messy, Yue Zhishi was still sleeping deeply, hugging his pillow, and completely didn\u2019t sense someone had come into his room.\u201cLe Le,\u201d Song Yu softly called, his voice so soft it clearly wouldn\u2019t cause a reaction. He bent over, leaning closely next to his ear. \u201cTime to get up.\u201dYue Zhishi shifted faintly, and his eyes squinted like a young baby chick. He released some vague noises through his nose before he flipped over, taking the pillow in his arms with him, and continued sleeping with his face towards the wall.There was nothing Song Yu could do \u2014 it was still early, so he planned on letting Yue Zhishi continue sleeping. Picking up Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm, he squeezed out a bit of the allergic rash salve onto his fingers and lightly smeared it onto the area where the rash had been. After a few days of the salve, the rash had already mostly disappeared.\u201cDon\u2019t lick me\u2026 Cotton Candy, get out\u2026.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry once he heard Yue Zhishi\u2019s mumbles, and yet he found him too cute. He lifted up Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm after finishing with the salve and kissed the palm of his hand.Yue Zhishi started to mumble again, as expected. \u201cGo away, I want to sleep\u2026\u201d He flipped again, his face now facing the ceiling, and a piece of hair on his forehead that\u2019d been pressed down now drifted straight up \u2014 it made him look a bit silly.Song Yu reached out and pushed it down for him, but that chunk of hair was more stubborn than Yue Zhishi himself. He tried pushing it down several times, but it continued to stand back up. He was just about to get up and collect all the things Yue Zhishi was going to need to take to class, and then he heard Yue Zhishi murmuring out\u00a0gege.What dream was he having now.Supporting himself with one hand on the blanket, Song Yu bent over again, wanting to hear Yue Zhishi sleep-talking. Except Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t continue, merely dropping back into his deep sleep. The shape of his lips was very pretty, the colour of them a pink blushing almost to red; combined with his curly, light-coloured hair and pale skin, he looked almost like an Adonis from one of those Middle Ages oil paintings. In mythology, someone like him was often portrayed as purely innocent and romantic to arouse desire from others. Song Yu very much identified with that desire, and so he lowered his head and kissed Yue Zhishi\u2019s lips.His kiss lingered, and yet it was a peaceful kiss. It was a simple meeting of lips without a layer of heavy desire \u2014 like someone in prison kissing an unrestrained skylark passing by the edge of his window.After standing up, Song Yu lightly adjusted the hair on Yue Zhishi\u2019s forehead. The cell phone next to Yue Zhishi\u2019s pillow suddenly rang; it was his alarm, and the deeply slumbering Yue Zhishi wrinkled his eyebrows, groping around everywhere to find his phone without even bothering to crack open his eyes. Song Yu helpfully stuffed the phone into his hand. \u201cHere.\u201dYue Zhishi still didn\u2019t open his eyes. He held the phone with one hand, and he used his other hand\u2019s index finger to randomly poke at the screen, poking until he hit the button to turn off the alarm. The noise stopped, and he immediately fell back into sleep.Song Yu felt both helpless and amused at the same time; he decided to let him sleep until he was happy, so he lay down, quietly gazing at him. He lay there until 9am, and he woke Yue Zhishi by brushing a finger around his neck. Yue Zhishi\u2019s neck was extremely sensitive \u2014 he\u2019d curl away at the slightest touch. Song Yu knew where he was weakest, and he hadn\u2019t want to use it until the very last moment.Sure enough, Yue Zhishi squiggled around a few times like an earthworm. He was finally awake.\u201cThat was too much.\u201d His voice was low and grumbly.Song Yu said, very sternly, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do that, then you\u2019ll probably be given a demerit point.\u201dOnly then did Yue Zhishi remember he had a class that morning \u2014 he immediately patted himself on the face, flipped off the bed and rapidly cleaned up. Drops of water were still all over his face by the time he ran out of the bathroom.\u201cDry your face.\u201d Song Yu stood up from the bed. \u201cNo need to rush, it\u2019ll only take us a few minutes by car. We still have plenty of time.\u201dYue Zhishi flung his head around a few times, his movements no different from Cotton Candy\u2019s after he was given a bath. But then he ran to stand in front of Song Yu and hooked his arms around his neck, saying, \u201cI like the toothpaste you have here. It tastes like jasmine.\u201d\u201cDoes it?\u201d Song Yu felt like there was no difference between toothpastes.Yue Zhishi gave him a kiss, telling him the answer.It didn\u2019t matter what kind of person the prisoner was; after being treated so gently and tenderly, the skylark would still happily, fervently twitch its wings and gift him a soft feather in return.His tiptoed feet returning back to the ground, Yue Zhishi observed Song Yu\u2019s eyes \u2014 the contours of his face were stained with damp, as if he was within the morning fog. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it taste like jasmine?\u201dEvery time he finished kissing, he would always look delighted with himself; he even thought he hid his delight well, as if Yue Zhishi truly thought he was a master at love. Song Yu saw right through his little game, and the corners of his mouth couldn\u2019t help but curve upwards.\u201cWhat are you smiling about?\u201d Yue Zhishi blinked.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to taste it that way.\u201d Song Yu grasped his waist, easing him backwards, and he very gently pushed Yue Zhishi against the wall. Yue Zhishi\u2019s chest was pressed down by Song Yu\u2019s, and his heart was running so quickly \u2014 he once again experienced the physiological illusion of his breathing being constricted, and it felt completely different from when he went to kiss Song Yu himself. Losing his ability to act independently felt both dangerous and seductive.Song Yu tightened the arms wrapped around his waist, and he lowered his head, covering his lips with his own.If the skylark hadn\u2019t left that feather behind, then the prisoner wouldn\u2019t have desired to keep that bird with him.Easily, languidly, he broke through Yue Zhishi\u2019s line of defence. In between their thin breaths, the sensations of moisture, softness, slick teeth \u2014 they all merged together with the aroma of mint mixed with jasmine, and it was like an intricate chemical reaction in slow motion, taking away their\u00a0resistance and ability to breathe.Yue Zhishi\u2019s face burned from the slight sound of sucking. It was almost as if Song Yu was leisurely, methodically sampling an exquisite appetiser, and his actions made Yue Zhishi\u2019s lack of experience and immaturity all the more apparent.Sensing Yue Zhishi\u2019s weakening, Song Yu stifled his thoughts of going further and released him.Both of Yue Zhishi\u2019s cheeks and his neck were flushed from embarrassment. His lips were still glistening, and his heart had yet to return back to normal. He leaned against the wall, trying his best to calm his breathing.\u201cI managed to taste it.\u201d Song Yu was composed to the point he could speak without shame, and he stretched out a hand to wipe Yue Zhishi\u2019s wet lips. \u201cThe jasmine flavour\u2019s very sweet.\u201dHe might\u2019ve been embarrassed, but the train of Yue Zhishi\u2019s thoughts seemed to be a bit different from other people. He squared his shoulders. \u201cSo you\u2019re more satisfied with a\u2026 kiss like that, right?\u201d He wasn\u2019t able to force out the words \u2018french kiss\u2019.Song Yu stared at him for a little while, and he was suddenly no longer as relaxed. He turned serious, as if he was saying something extremely important.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I\u2019m already very happy with whatever actions of love you find the courage to do. You can\u2019t measure the things we do by whether I\u2019m satisfied with them or not. You don\u2019t need to please anyone, understand?\u201dYue Zhishi pursed his lips, looking as though he understood, but he still persisted in saying, \u201cBut I want you to be satisfied by the things I do. In your heart, I\u2026 want to have a higher score.\u201dSong Yu stroked his cheek. \u201cI know. But you don\u2019t need to.\u201dActivities such as that would admittedly please Song Yu, but Yue Zhishi was too innocent; it would be very easy for others to take advantage of his habit of doing things in exchange for getting into their good graces. In order to stop Yue Zhishi from falling into a misconception about what he needed to give in this relationship, Song Yu spoke bluntly and straightforwardly for once.\u201cTo me, you already have full marks. Even if you don\u2019t do anything at all, you will still have a perfect score.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s heart abruptly jumped wildly \u2014 it felt like there was a small rabbit hopping desperately in his chest.\u201cThen\u2026 what if I turn in an empty paper?\u201d He looked at Song Yu, asking a very childish question. \u201cWill I still have a perfect score?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d\u201cThen what if I cheat?\u201d\u201cHow would you cheat?\u201dYue Zhishi hugged his neck, smiling very sweetly. \u201cI\u2019d bribe the exam proctor and have a good relationship with the teacher. That way I\u2019d get 101 points.While his self-control was still operating, Song Yu lifted his wrist and showed Yue Zhishi the watch he\u2019d given him. \u201cBeing late for class will still get your points deducted.\u201d\u201cOkay, Teacher Song.\u201d Yue Zhishi drooped his head, crestfallen, and decided to hate going to class for three seconds.But he was able to complete another heroic feat: he managed to eat breakfast inside the obsessed-with-cleanliness Song Yu\u2019s car, and he even managed to get Song Yu to finish the osmanthus egg soup he wasn\u2019t able to drink. Luckily Song Yu drove; Yue Zhishi rushed into the classroom at 9:59am and sat next to Jiang Yufan.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have gone home, right?\u201d Jiang Yufan didn\u2019t know about the apartment. \u201cUncle and auntie drove you over so early? Or did you take the subway?\u201d\u201cMy ge.\u201d Yue Zhishi circled around his question.\u201cDo you feel any better? You still have a fever?\u201d Jiang Yufan asked again.The professor came in at that moment, and Yue Zhishi shook his head, lowering his voice. \u201cI was fine by yesterday.\u201dThe doors closed by the professor were pushed open once again, Shen Mi entering two minutes late. Yue Zhishi glanced at him, feeling he didn\u2019t look right. Jiang Yufan nudged his shoulder. \u201cShen Mi hasn\u2019t seemed okay the last two days. He drank a lot, and I saw him sitting on the steps by himself when I was walking around the sports ground with my girlfriend.\u201d\u201cWhy was he drinking?\u201d Yue Zhishi curiously asked.\u201cI asked him later on WeChat, and he said it was something to do with his family. He said it wasn\u2019t important, and even told me not to tell you.\u201d Jiang Yufan didn\u2019t think that was a good idea. \u201cAs friends, it\u2019s necessary to take care of each other.\u201dYue Zhishi felt his words were very logical, so he sent Shen Mi a sticker of a doggy being patted on its head. Since Shen Mi hadn\u2019t wanted to tell him, Yue Zhishi thought he wouldn\u2019t want him to ask either.And as expected, five minutes later, Shen Mi replied with a silly looking sticker and nothing else.Yue Zhishi was pretty skilled with the content of this particular general education class, and he didn\u2019t need to spend a lot of effort when listening. His notes were quickly well-written, and after just the first half of the class, three people had already come over to ask for his notes. Yue Zhishi sent over a copy of his word document and then sprawled onto his desk to rest for a while.As soon as he closed his eyes, he would remember how it felt as Song Yu kissed him, and his heart would quicken, unable to be controlled. It made him almost afraid to close his eyes.\u201cHey, I hear our university\u2019s about to put on an arts festival. Are you going to participate?\u201d Once the words left his lips, Jiang Yufan felt Yue Zhishi was definitely going to be dragged in \u2014 just with his looks, all the seniors in his faculty were going to fight over him. \u201cWhat kind of event do you like?\u201d\u201cAre there a lot?\u201d Yue Zhishi was a bit curious. \u201cI haven\u2019t even heard.\u201dJiang Yufan forwarded a WeChat message to him. Yue Zhishi pulled out his phone, but the first thing he saw was a message from Song Yu, saying he was going to head over to the law faculty and have lunch with him. Immediately, Yue Zhishi forgot everything else in his joy, and the message Jiang Yufan had sent him was thrown to the back of his mind.Jiang Yufan stared at him. \u201cWhich one are you interested in? How come you\u2019re so happy, the corners of your mouth are almost high enough to pluck the moon out of the sky.\u201d\u201cWhat? Interested in what?\u201d Yue Zhishi mumbled to himself quietly, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in anyone at all.\u201d\u201cAiyo.\u201d Jiang Yufan laughed at him. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely going to be dragged to be a model. Being born handsome is a crime by itself.\u201dThe professor returned back to the classroom, and their mismatched conversation halted. Yue Zhishi was very focused during class, not looking at his phone at all, and he was still organising his notes on his laptop by the time the professor finished the second half of the class.\u201cI\u2019m not going to eat lunch at the cafeteria with you today.\u201d Jiang Yufan quickly packed up his bag. \u201cI promised to go eat\u00a0crab meat pot\u00a0with my girlfriend.\u201dYue Zhishi was focused on his laptop screen, and he spared a bit of his attention to reply, \u201cAll right, you dude who forgets his friends once he has a girlfriend\u2026\u201dHe\u2019d just finished speaking when Yue Zhishi sharply woke up. \u201cGirlfriend?\u201d He didn\u2019t even bother saying goodbye to Jiang Yufan, who was already running away, and stuffed all his things into his bag, turning on his phone. He immediately saw Song Yu\u2019s messages.[Gege: Tell me when you finish class.][Gege: Do you want some roasted chestnuts? Some place is selling them.][Gege: I\u2019m heading over.]Yue Zhishi headed out with the flow of people with his head lowered the entire way, wanting to type. He\u2019d just typed out two characters when he received a new message.[Gege: Don\u2019t look at your phone while you\u2019re walking. No need to reply, just come out \u2014 I\u2019m waiting for you.]Someone might\u2019ve thought Song Yu had installed an eyeball next to him just to watch him. Yue Zhishi turned his head, making sure Song Yu truly wasn\u2019t behind him.Song Yu understood him too well. With just a simple \u2018currently typing\u2026\u2019, he was able to guess what he was doing.The flow of people swept him along until he reached the entrance of the classroom building. It was a noisy and rowdy place, and Yue Zhishi thought he\u2019d have to search for a while \u2014 but as soon as he lifted his head, he saw Song Yu standing underneath the Chinese parasol trees. He gave Yue Zhishi a very faint smile, and when their eyes met, he walked towards him.Even though Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t replied to him, Song Yu still bought some roasted chestnuts anyway. They were still warm.\u201cThey smell so good.\u201d Opening the package, Yue Zhishi glanced inside. Every single one of the chestnuts were round and bulging, and fragrant, sweet yellow flesh was exposed from the little cracks on them. He strolled closely next to Song Yu, their arms grazing against each other very intimately. \u201cHow\u2019d you know I was still inside? What if I\u2019d left already?\u201d\u201cI guessed you might be asking questions or finishing up your notes.\u201d Song Yu paused, and then he said, \u201cPlus, Shen Mi just came out. He came over and told me you were still inside.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t said only just that. He\u2019d even congratulated him on getting together with Yue Zhishi, the words coming out entirely against his will. \u201cYou need to treat him better, don\u2019t forget how to do that just because you have him now.\u201d When Song Yu asked him how he\u2019d known, he pointed at him. \u201cLook, I managed to trick it out of you.\u201d\u201cEven an idiot would be able to tell. Don\u2019t take me for an idiot. He didn\u2019t come back to school for three days straight, and he was like a completely different person as soon as he came back. He was almost bubbling over with happiness. You think I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell just by seeing how happy he was? But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not foolish enough to expose my loss. I\u2019d just lose my own face.\u201dSong Yu watched Shen Mi, not saying a single word. He watched as a childish expression covered his face, as he pretended to be open-minded and generous.\u201cEven though you\u2019re the person I least want to beg in this entire world, still \u2014 please don\u2019t tell him what I said to you that night. Just pretend I was also suffering from a fever that day and was spouting nonsense. He won\u2019t feel burdened if he doesn\u2019t know.\u201dHe said to Song Yu at the end, \u201cYou\u2019re definitely a lot clearer than I am about whether this road is easy or not. Please make sure he doesn\u2019t suffer so much. I\u2019m giving up now, by myself. It\u2019s a lot easier to be friends. Luckily I didn\u2019t confess.\u201dSong Yu felt like he was trying to boast, and yet he didn\u2019t want to expose him. Before Shen Mi left, Song Yu even thanked him.\u201cDon\u2019t thank me, it was hard enough for me to catch an opportunity to educate senior Song Yu. I really didn\u2019t expect this at all. This might be the highlight of my entire life.\u201dHe was still a guy who liked running his mouth, even at the end.A smile escaped from Song Yu \u2014 he, too, never expected he would one day say thank you and smoothly reconcile with a rival.It felt like the entire world was finally revealing its inconceivable nature after getting together with Yue Zhishi.\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything else, did he?\u201d Yue Zhishi looked at Song Yu. \u201cJiang Yufan said he hasn\u2019t seemed right lately, that he hasn\u2019t seemed too happy.\u201dSong Yu hummed and said, \u201cMaybe just a bad period in his life.\u201d\u201cI hope he can get out of it soon,\u201d Yue Zhishi sincerely said. He saw Song Yu wearing his AirPods with a lift of his head. \u201cAre you listening to music?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d\u201cI want to listen too.\u201dSong Yu pulled out one of them and placed it into Yue Zhishi\u2019s ear. When he saw his slightly reddened ear, Song Yu kept remembering how he looked as he stood on the road of love, the first time he\u2019d kissed him.Yue Zhishi adjusted the earbud with a hand, continuing to walk closely next to Song Yu. An English song was playing, and the melody of the guitar was beautiful.In the past, Song Yu always used to wear his earphones by himself, immersed in his own world. Yet now, he was willing to share a piece of himself with Yue Zhishi. Every single person standing within this large campus was an individual, all by themselves \u2014 they were like the many isolated islands in the vast ocean. But Song Yu and Yue Zhishi were different: their bodies didn\u2019t touch each other, and they looked as though they had no connection with each other \u2014 and yet they were able to hear the same music only they themselves could hear.This connection was hidden, yet belonged solely to them; it was like a special ocean current, swirling around two small, ordinary islands. They were no longer alone.The cafeteria was full of people, and Song Yu didn\u2019t want him to line up, asking Yue Zhishi what he wanted to eat. Song Yu found a table, telling him to wait there for him, and he went to buy food by himself. He went too far \u2014 five metres, ten metres and then at a certain distance away, the earbud in Yue Zhishi\u2019s ear went quiet. The sounds of his surroundings instantly poured in, just like a tidal wave.Their ocean current was cut through.\u201cLe Le.\u201dHearing a familiar voice, Yue Zhishi raised his head and saw Nan Jia, who was holding a plate of food. \u201cWhat a coincidence. Did you guys just finish class too?\u201d\u201cMn. I\u2019m eating lunch with Song Yu.\u201d He intentionally didn\u2019t use the words gege.\u201cReally? Then do you mind if I join?\u201d Nan Jia smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit hard to find a spot.\u201d\u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind.\u201dNan Jia sat diagonally across from Yue Zhishi, leaving empty the spaces directly across and next to Yue Zhishi for Song Yu. \u201cI\u2019ve been so busy today, I haven\u2019t had a chance to even drink water the whole morning.\u201d She threw the straw into her cup and took a large sip of her drink.Curious, Yue Zhishi asked, \u201cWhy are you so busy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s that arts festival. I\u2019m helping out with both the debate and the fashion show. Our faculty entered all six events last year, but we only managed to get into two finals. Everyone wants a better result this year, so they\u2019re all working hard.\u201dYue Zhishi thought of what Jiang Yufan said during class. \u201cSo there are six events.\u201d\u201cYup, but the debate is the most competitive. You know our university is famous for its debating teams \u2014 too many people have signed up for this event. A lot of fourth year graduates or postgraduate students are planning on competing. But the other events are really amazing too.\u201d Nan Jia\u2019s eyes widened slightly at this point. \u201cBy the way, Le Le, do you want to join in? I can help you with whichever event you want to join. Would you like to sing, dance, act in a play or debate? Or you can go be a model for our faculty\u2019s dressmaking team.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Yue Zhishi thought for a bit. \u201cBy being a model, do you mean someone will design my clothes?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. A team of people will design the clothes, and then there\u2019ll be a grand exhibition show. I feel like you\u2019ll definitely look great on the walkway.\u201dCompared to walking a fashion show, Yue Zhishi was a bit more interested in designing and debating. He originally hadn\u2019t been considering participating in the arts festival, but now he started to wonder.Afraid of interrupting him, Nan Jia didn\u2019t continue speaking once she saw Yue Zhishi lost in his thoughts. Unexpectedly, only thirty seconds later, Yue Zhishi came out of his daze and abruptly said, \u201cMy ge\u2019s back.\u201dThe invisible ocean current between them once again connected, the sound of the guitar having changed to a piano, slowly flowing.Nan Jia looked up \u2014 Song Yu really was back. He stood only a few metres away.\u201cThe telepathy between you guys is a bit too strong,\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but sigh.Yue Zhishi looked over as well, and the moment he met Song Yu\u2019s eyes, a smile appeared on his face. The music starting again was a hint, and it was also as if it was a hug, given to him in Song Yu\u2019s place after he returned.\u201cNo, we\u2019re just cheating,\u201d he said, smiling to Nan Jia.The author has something to say:To me, Song Yu is the best, Le Le is the best and they\u2019re the best for each other.Song Yu\u2019s charm is in his maturity and restraint. I still stubbornly believe the older person shouldn\u2019t take advantage of the younger person\u2019s trust and already established emotions to ask for love. To me, the older person would lose their charm. If the age gap was larger, then guiding the younger person a certain way under the guise of \u2018taking initiative\u2019 is even more unacceptable.The younger person in this story may be young, but he still has the right to take steps out of his own free will. Song Yu is protecting Le Le\u2019s free will and ability to make his own choices, and isn\u2019t asking for anything in return.PS: the osmanthus wine flavoured egg soup is made from whisked eggs and osmanthus flowers, almost like a dessert. You can pretty much ignore the alcohol content hhhh of course, you shouldn\u2019t drive after drinking, don\u2019t drink if you\u2019re driving \u2014 or else your relatives will have their faces full of tears.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He spoke without any emotions in his voice, as if he was a household service robot with an outstanding appearance.\u201cNo\u00a0duck blood and vermicelli soup\u00a0today. Only\u00a0mixian rice noodles.\u201d\u201cMixian\u2019s fine too.\u201d Yue Zhishi very happily took the bowl from Song Yu. He then asked, thinking of what Nan Jia had just said, \u201cHave you participated in the arts festival before?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Song Yu nodded, casually separating out the cutlery. \u201cI was in my faculty\u2019s debate team for a bit.\u201dNan Jia was smiling when she said, \u201cI even competed against your brother once in a semi-final. He really was the dark horse in the first years\u2019 competition. Everyone initially thought this person who didn\u2019t know how to talk wouldn\u2019t be articulate at all, and then he turned out to be a golden fourth speaker.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s bad with words. He just doesn\u2019t like talking.\u201d Yue Zhishi explained for Song Yu immediately, but his heart yearned to see the sight of Song Yu in a suit, sitting at the long tables of a debate competition.Yue Zhishi poked the tip of Song Yu\u2019s foot with his own. \u201cThen will you participate this year?\u201dShaking his head, Song Yu said, \u201cI don\u2019t have the time. I stopped last year.\u201dNan Jia shrugged as well. \u201cI was chatting to his faculty\u2019s coach a while ago, and he was really regretful about Song Yu. He felt like he was a really strong seeded player. You have to know \u2014 the attacking and defence strategies of a second or third speaker are actually really easy to learn and practice. There\u2019s no lack of excellent second and third speakers, but it\u2019s actually very hard to find strong fourth speakers.\u201dYue Zhishi had also participated in debate competitions in high school, and he very much agreed with what Nan Jia said. \u201cThat\u2019s right, especially when the strength of the two teams are equal and it\u2019s hard to figure out who has the stronger position. In situations like that, the later you speak, the more pressure you have. It\u2019s often up to the fourth speaker to fight for success.\u201dSong Yu was indifferent. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as exaggerated as that. The second and third speakers are always the main force of the team.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s regretful anyway.\u201d Nan Jia said to Yue Zhishi, smiling, \u201cBut I feel like, other than his studies, everything your brother does is just for fun and just to get some experience. You can be like him too and try a few more things. It\u2019s university. You should grab all the opportunities you can to enrich yourself.\u201dThey didn\u2019t talk much further. Nan Jia very quickly finished her food, returned her plate and then said goodbye to them as she left. She was always very busy, rushing from one place to the next, but she lived every one of her days to the fullest.With no one there to chat with, Yue Zhishi peacefully sat there, pondering as he ate, and then after a little while, he raised his head. \u201cSong Yu.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t even look up. \u201cIt sounds like my name comes out of your mouth easier every time you say it.\u201dYue Zhishi squeezed Song Yu\u2019s legs in between his own, rocking them slightly before he let go. \u201cIt feels more intimate that way.\u201d\u201cWhy did you stop going to the debate team? You could\u2019ve been able to enter the university team if you continued, and you might\u2019ve even been able to participate in those championship competitions.\u201dAnd then, as if he was cutely whining, Yue Zhishi said very softly, \u201cI want to watch you compete too.\u201dNow that it was only the two of them, Song Yu\u2019s explanation increased. \u201cI originally joined with the intention of killing time. After participating for two years, I realised it really was something that required a lot of time. I needed to continuously train. Just for one argument, I needed to repeatedly research information, guess the other team\u2019s arguments and then find a way to dismantle it. All of that work doesn\u2019t come from thin air; it needed time and energy. I didn\u2019t have the energy to continue with it, so after I quit the team after my last planned competition.\u201dHe then said, \u201cBesides, there are many more people who love debating more than I do. I should leave the opportunities to them.\u201dYue Zhishi bit his chopsticks and nodded. He realised Song Yu was very different from other people \u2014 if it was someone else the same age as him who was lucky enough to enter the faculty team, even if he didn\u2019t initially want to join the university team, he would still definitely want to continue winning after competing for a while. He would\u2019ve entered a different path.\u201cEveryone said you\u2019re really good at it, that you have talent. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a pity to give it up?\u201dSong Yu opened a bottle of water and took a sip. \u201cThose who find giving up a pity \u2014 it\u2019s because they stopped doing something they weren\u2019t able to do to begin with.\u201dHe handed the bottle over to Yue Zhishi, hinting at him to also have some water. He continued speaking only after Yue Zhishi obediently took it. \u201cThere are limits to how much energy a person has. It\u2019s already difficult enough to focus on one thing and to do that one thing well.\u201d\u201cSometimes you really feel feel like someone who climbs mountains.\u201d Yue Zhishi gazed at him, a small smile emerging on his face.Song Yu raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t we watch that documentary together before? Those mountaineers who needed to climb thousands of metres above sea level were all so focused. They plan out everything to the smallest detail before starting their journey, and during their climb, they only have one goal: to continue upwards. They abandon everything else, and they\u2019re more concentrated the higher they go.\u201dA process like that was extremely similar to how Song Yu lived his life. Just like the optimal algorithm for pruning, all unnecessary paths were filtered out, reducing the complexity and increasing the efficiency rate of his life.Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes slowly lost focus as he spoke about mountain climbing, and he looked like he was a bit lost in his thoughts.\u201cSay, do you think my dad was also someone like that?\u201dHe looked at Song Yu, asking uncertainly, \u201cWhy do you seem more like him than I do?\u201dSong Yu was silent for a moment, and then he said to Yue Zhishi, \u201cUncle Yue wasn\u2019t someone who knew how to do only one thing. He was very brave, and he would always try out the things he wanted to do in order to broaden the scope of his life. That\u2019s another wonderful way to live. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s actually similar to him.\u201dYue Zhishi was a little flattered. \u201cReally? You think I\u2019m like him?\u201dSong Yu nodded. \u201cYou are the best parts of your parents put together.\u201dHis words were a bit overly solemn to be said over lunch. Yue Zhishi was a bit embarrassed, but he understood Song Yu; he had never been able to compliment others, so everything he had just said was rare true words from his heart.They\u2019d pretty much finished their food by now, so they cleaned the table, leaving the cafeteria after they returned their bowls and plates.Even though Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t very willing to separate from Song Yu, he was no longer sick, and so he still needed to return to live in his own dorm. His dorm mates had also been very worried about the last few days. Song Yu agreed with his thoughts as well, so he walked Yue Zhishi to his dorm \u2014 he needed to attend a meeting later that afternoon to discuss the schedule of their research paper, and he didn\u2019t know how long the meeting would last.The weather had turned cool, but the leaves still stubbornly held onto the colours of spring. As he walked, Yue Zhishi suddenly raised his head and asked Song Yu, \u201cDo you think I should go to the debate competition or the clothing design competition?\u201dHis indecisive nature always came out during times like these to interfere with his decisions. \u201cLogically speaking, wouldn\u2019t the debate competition be more helpful to my studies?\u201dA car drove towards them from the front. Song Yu didn\u2019t answer his question immediately; he circled around Yue Zhishi, swapping places with him without a single thought.\u201cSpeculative reasoning\u00a0is helpful to anything you do.\u201d He spoke after the car drove away from them.Yue Zhishi nodded thoughtfully, but then he heard Song Yu say, \u201cBut the most important thing isn\u2019t if it\u2019s helpful. It\u2019s whether you like it or not.\u201dIt felt like all of his piled up thoughts about choosing the debate competition had been pulled out and flipped over by Song Yu \u2014 he\u2019d easily poked at what his heart actually wanted, as if he extremely understood him. Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but laugh, and he asked, \u201cHow are you so sure I want to do the other one?\u201dThe empty campus roads were very quiet, and their entire journey had been covered by osmanthus flowers drifted onto the ground, all the various fragments of autumn exhaling their sweet fragrance. Song Yu\u2019s footsteps merged stably, consistently with Yue Zhishi\u2019s own steps, and his reply was also very tranquil.\u201cOther than who you would end up liking, I\u2019m very sure about everything else you like.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s footsteps abruptly paused, the rhythm of their pace thrown completely into disarray.After getting together with Song Yu, his heartbeats were always extremely unstable. This was different from before, where Yue Zhishi had already gotten used to guessing the reasons behind Song Yu\u2019s actions, obtaining tiny hints from his slight expressions. But now, Song Yu sometimes exposed himself so directly, as though he was a cat revealing his soft underbelly without a single precaution.No one can defeat a cat\u2019s belly.His ears might be burning and his heart may be speeding, but Yue Zhishi still caught onto Song Yu and stopped him from continuing forward. He faced him, and he looked directly into Song Yu\u2019s eyes. \u201cI would only end up liking you.\u201d\u201cSince you didn\u2019t know something so simple, I guess you\u2019re not that amazing after all.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s eyes shifted from his reddened ears to his pair of eyes, slightly wanting to laugh. \u201cAre you trying to goad me into doing something?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just stating a fact.\u201d Yue Zhishi lightly curved his head down, a little smug.Seeing him like that, Song Yu couldn\u2019t hold back his hand from tapping his nose. \u201cWhat are you so happy about?\u201dYue Zhishi shamelessly boasted as he held onto Song Yu\u2019s hand, \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, because now you entirely, thoroughly understand the person who is Yue Zhishi.\u201dSong Yu was defeated by Yue Zhishi\u2019s magical speaking abilities. In front of Yue Zhishi, all of his negative emotions had nowhere to hide, nowhere to live \u2014 they briefly showed themselves only for a short little while, and then they were strangled just as they were born by just a few words from Yue Zhishi.\u201cThen right now, should I say it\u2019s a great honour?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Yue Zhishi patted his shoulder, and the two of them broke into laughter, facing each other.His other two dorm mates were also in once he returned back to his dorm, other than Jiang Yufan who was out on a date. They asked how Yue Zhishi had been the last few days, and then he shared the snacks he\u2019d just bought with them.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t take an afternoon nap. He spent a while looking through the arts festival recruitment information Jiang Yufan had sent him, and then he consulted with senior Nan Jia on WeChat. In the end, he decided to sign up for the clothing design competition.Nan Jia initially wasn\u2019t aware Yue Zhishi knew how to draw, and she was even a bit shocked when she saw the drawings he sent over.[Senior Nan Jia: You drew all of these? Did you learn drawing before? They\u2019re all so good.][Le Le: It\u2019s just a hobby. I really like watching anime, so sometimes I would draw a bit too.][Senior Nan Jia: This is fantastic \u2014 our faculty was missing a competitor like you who has a background in drawing.]After registering, Yue Zhishi received the time and place for the preliminary round. He became somewhat nervous, so he stood up and paced around his small dorm twice before he finally thought of something, sitting down and opening his laptop.He asked Nan Jia for the video recording of Song Yu\u2019s final debate competition. After ten or so minutes, Nan Jia sent it over, and she included a message.[Senior Nan Jia: By the way, Song Yu was surrounded by a lot of rumours after this. Pretty much no one was talking about the competition itself, only gossiping that he might not be single for much longer. But the gossiping masses stopped talking about it after Song Yu stayed single.]A bit puzzled, Yue Zhishi smiled as he typed.[Le Le: It was that awesome? Then I guess I\u2019ll need to seriously pay attention.]In the video, Song Yu was wearing a suit, and he didn\u2019t look much different from now other than what he was wearing. A minute sense of loss grew in Yue Zhishi when he saw this; maybe this competition wasn\u2019t important to Song Yu, but to Yue Zhishi, it was.He really wanted to be involved \u2014 even if he wasn\u2019t able to personally attend and watch the competition, he still hoped Song Yu could tell him about it and give him the chance to say a single\u00a0jiayou.But passed by time was in the past, and he remained not having been involved. The dazzling Song Yu in the video had no connection with him.By the time his thoughts returned back to the video, the debate moderator had already started introducing the topic of the debate: between science and humanities, which one was more important.Yue Zhishi felt like this topic was very familiar. It was most likely because this topic truly was very common, and he might have debated a similar topic in high school. When the affirmative and negative teams were announced, Yue Zhishi pretty much burst into laughter \u2014 because Song Yu\u2019s team had unexpectedly been given the negative side.To argue humanities was more important than science \u2014 that was essentially telling Song Yu to debate with himself.From the start of the introductions to the free debate, Song Yu didn\u2019t speak at all. He acted as though he was a free bystander outside the competition itself, recording down all the different arguments he heard. Even though the free debate had opportunities for him to battle with his words, he stood up very rarely, and when he did, it was mainly to support his team\u2019s arguments as the other side tried to undermine them.Song Yu only started to perform when it came time for the conclusions. He didn\u2019t speak quickly, yet he was very stable, the first half of his concluding remarks precisely catching almost all of the holes in the other side\u2019s arguments. He dismantled the other team\u2019s logical reasoning one by one, as if he was taking down the building blocks of the other team\u2019s meticulously built mansion of logic.The camera even purposefully switched to the other team\u2019s fourth speaker, who\u2019d yet to speak. He had already lost his ability to control his facial expressions.Song Yu disliked using emotions or feelings to affect the way someone thought; he didn\u2019t want to sweep the audience along with emotional storytelling, even though it would\u2019ve been advantageous for his position in this particular competition.He remained as calm and unhurried as always \u2014 but in his final statements, he quoted words from someone else, and it didn\u2019t seem like something he would do at all.Yue Zhishi froze, rewinding the video back a few seconds and listening again to Song Yu\u2019s final words. His mind flashed, remembering something. He took the date of the competition, written on the video, and searched through his cloud archive for a particular chat record.The voices of the judges and moderator filled his ears as they announced the winner. But at this point in time, Yue Zhishi was already too busy to care; he knew Song Yu had won.His eyes fell onto a particular chat record, two years having already passed.[Gege: Let me ask you something.][Le Le: What?][Gege: Do you think science is more important, or humanities]Yue Zhishi thought about how he\u2019d first felt when he received that message. He hadn\u2019t thought it was something serious, and he\u2019d even said some irrelevant things to Song Yu \u2014 because for a question like that, he\u2019d felt like his own opinion wouldn\u2019t be important to Song Yu.He later realised Song Yu was asking him a serious question, and he only then gave him a serious response.[Le Le: I think it\u2019s really hard to determine which one\u2019s more important. But I just thought of something \u2014 if we returned back to the primeval times, science might be what allows humankind to make an axe. This is really important, because we can use it to hunt and feed ourselves. But\u00a0humanistic thinking\u00a0would then appear at this point, and it would tell us: don\u2019t use that axe to kill our fellow human beings.]Yue Zhishi was still in disbelief as he read through the chat record. He couldn\u2019t believe Song Yu had actually cared about what he\u2019d said.As a result, he once again rewinded the video to where Song Yu was making his concluding remarks. Every single one of his concluding statements was tight and secure in logic without a single inconsistency, but at the end, where he should\u2019ve elevated his team\u2019s final argument, he took and used the opinion Yue Zhishi had believed to be insignificant.In the video, with only the final ten or so seconds remaining, Song Yu placed down his tightly controlled weapons of words and looked towards the audience. The face that had been unperturbed to the point of being almost apathetic \u2014 it finally held a tiny shred of gentleness.\u201cWhen I first saw the debate topic, I sent it over to someone whose opinions are always the opposite of mine and yet who is very important to me. He said something very simple when he saw it, and I want to quote those words as my final statement in my concluding argument.\u201dThe chat record also held the last sentence of that day.[Le Le: If science is what allows humanity to make tools, then humanistic thinking is to prevent us from becoming the tools of science.]He watched as the Song Yu in his screen repeated this point of view and then deeply bowed. There was a complicated mixture of emotions in his heart. He was slightly annoyed that Song Yu quoted his own immature words as a conclusion in such an important competition, and yet he was surprised, his face burning, at the words \u2018someone very important to me\u2019. He understood why Nan Jia said this video caused a wave of rumours.But the wave of emotions finally flooded over, leaving behind only a grieving and emotional heart.All those experiences he\u2019d thought he never participated in \u2014 he hadn\u2019t missed them at all.Yue Zhishi\u2019s pure sincerity was reflected in every single glittering fragment of Song Yu\u2019s life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Quickly transfer me some money.]With no reply coming after waiting for a while, Yue Zhishi guessed Song Yu was still in his meeting. He might even be giving a report right now with no time to reply, so Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t really mind. He only noticed Song Yu had replied to him when he checked his phone right before he was about to start his first class in the afternoon.Song Yu didn\u2019t say anything \u2014 he simply transferred over 520 RMB to Yue Zhishi\u2019s WeChat.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know whether he should laugh or cry when he first saw that notification; there was no way he would\u2019ve able to guess Song Yu would give him such a response. If you said Song Yu was a straight-forward person, sometimes he was particularly indirect, going around in circles and circles. If you said Song Yu didn\u2019t understand how to flirt, he still knew how to transfer over money in an amount that carried special significance.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t accept the transfer.[Le Le: I was joking. How could you have kept it so hidden and not told me at all? I heard from senior Nan Jia that a lot of people thought you were about to get into a relationship after your final competition match. With so many people discussing you and your rumours, how\u2019d you feel?]He received a reply after two minutes.[Gege: I don\u2019t remember.]The professor had already arrived at the podium at the front of the classroom and was opening his lesson plan. \u201cHave all the students arrived? Scan this QR code and sign in.\u201dYue Zhishi quickly left the chat to scan the code, and he nudged Shen Mi, who was sitting next to him and trying to hide the fact he was playing\u00a0Honor of Kings.Another notification popped up in WeChat, so Yue Zhishi returned back to the chat after he finished signing in.[Gege: But right now, I\u2019m quite happy that I\u2019m no longer single.]Yue Zhishi could almost imagine Song Yu saying the words \u2018I\u2019m quite happy\u2019 with that dead, expressionless face of his, combined with his flat voice.[Le Le: If you\u2019d let me heard that last bit earlier, you would\u2019ve lost your single status earlier.][Gege: I\u2019m very glad you didn\u2019t hear it earlier. This way, I know you ended up liking me by yourself, and not because you were affected by some affectionate words. You say yes to things very easily because you\u2019re incapable of rejecting other people\u2019s kindness, and that\u2019s especially true when it comes to me \u2014 you never refuse me. I\u2019m very clear about this.]When he saw this message, Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart felt very warm. Song Yu understood him more than anyone else \u2014 he knew his issues when it came to social interactions, and he was also the person who understood his personality and temper the best. And yet, he would never take advantage of this familiarity and understanding to achieve any particular goal.But Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want Song Yu to take him as a child, so he argued back for himself.[Le Le: I\u2019m already an adult now. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t be affected that easily anymore.][Gege: The first step in becoming a qualified adult is to learn how to refuse people, and that includes me.]He was right. Yue Zhishi stared at that message. He was often bound by his inability to reject other people\u2019s requests and would get caught in trivial matters that had nothing to do with him. But when faced with Song Yu, it felt like he wasn\u2019t able to refuse him \u2014 because Song Yu fundamentally never requested anything at all. Yue Zhishi actually hoped Song Yu could ask for something from him, whether it was to hold his hand or to give him an embrace.[Le Le: The first step in becoming a qualified partner in love is to learn how to rely on your other half, and that\u2019s me.]The professor started the class once he sent through that message. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t wait for Song Yu to reply, opening his laptop and preparing to learn.The courses after entering university were actually very different compared to how Yue Zhishi imagined they would be. Professors no longer focused on specific points of knowledge; instead, they focused on teaching them how to think, getting the students to turn their brains into \u2018legal minds\u2019 through training. At the same time, law was also closely related to many other fields \u2014 not only did the students need to learn the law, they also needed to understand the content of many other interrelated disciplines in order to understand a specific case.Yue Zhishi was used to learning about all kinds of different things, so he adapted to it pretty easily.\u201cProfessor Zhang\u2019s classes scare me the most.\u201d Shen Mi left his phone on his desk and opened his textbook. \u201cPlease don\u2019t call on me.\u201dProfessor Zhang always assumed everyone had already understood the background knowledge of the cases when it came time for his classes. His \u2018casual questions\u2019 always left the majority of the students silent, unable to answer them, but Yue Zhishi usually had already researched the background material while doing his reading.After answering questions two classes in a row, Yue Zhishi remained the only person who had anything to say. His looks were also unique, so the professor very quickly remembered his name.\u201cYou\u2019re not bad.\u201d The old professor nodded with his hands behind his back. \u201cGood, continue studying well and you\u2019ll have a bright future.\u201dShen Mi needed to go to training with the university basketball team once the class ended, so Yue Zhishi went together with Jiang Yufan to eat at the cafeteria. The cafeteria was extremely busy; Yue Zhishi only checked his phone after he found a place to sit with his food. His phone was covered by many WeChat messages.But his eyes went straight to the unread messages in the pinned chat at the top.[Gege: You\u2019re right.][Gege: I still have one more thing to say \u2014 I forgot to say it earlier after getting interrupted. If I were to do it again, I probably still wouldn\u2019t let you come to watch the competition, and I still wouldn\u2019t send the video recording to you. But I would change my introduction of you to \u2018the person I like\u2019.]As if he was patching up his words, there was yet another message one minute later.[Gege: So everyone would stop guessing. It was so annoying.]Yue Zhishi gazed at the chat, grinning so foolishly he didn\u2019t even eat. Jiang Yufan watched him for a while and then gave him a kick, dragging him back to reality.\u201cYou find money? What\u2019s so funny?\u201d\u201cWhat money? I didn\u2019t even accept the three-figure windfall dropped from the sky.\u201d Yue Zhishi picked up his chopsticks and stuffed a piece of\u00a0red braised pork belly\u00a0into his mouth. It was soft and fragrant, the fat coating his mouth without being greasy. He originally wasn\u2019t hungry, but his appetite woke up after this one bite \u2014 he went to grab a quail egg and pushed his bowl of food over to Jiang Yufan. \u201cThis quail egg and red braised pork belly\u2019s really, really delicious. Try it.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d Jiang Yufan clutched his own chin with a hand like a terrible detective. \u201cI feel like after you\u2019ve gotten better, there\u2019s been something different about you. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve been soaked in a pot of honey, laughing and smiling every day. And you\u2019re always chatting with someone. Are you in an online relationship?\u201d\u201cWho would I be in an online relationship with.\u201d Yue Zhishi shoved some rice into his mouth guiltily.Jiang Yufan dipped his head. \u201cTrue, if you really did get into an online relationship with your looks, then the other person is definitely the luckiest king of pulls.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cBeing able to get into an online relationship with you, wouldn\u2019t that be the same as blindly pulling the rarest, most limited item?\u201dYue Zhishi broke into laughter at that description. He secretly thought \u2014 the person he actually managed to pull should be the most limited of all limited items, the only one in the entire world.\u201cAiyah, just look at how messily you\u2019re eating. Wipe your face.\u201d\u201cHurry up and try the pork, it\u2019s so good.\u201dJiang Yufan picked up a piece. \u201cHey! It really is, I\u2019ll get this next time.\u201d Swallowing, he received a message and then said, extremely excited, \u201cLe Le, I can actually go act in a comedy play!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Yue Zhishi was also really happy. \u201cYou\u2019re too amazing, when are the roles being selected?\u201dJiang Yufan glanced at his message. \u201cThe 8th. I\u2019m starting to get a little nervous now.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Yue Zhishi comforted him. \u201cYou speak well, have a great upright figure and have a super energetic voice too. You\u2019re particularly suited to act in plays. I\u2019ll come watch your performance.\u201d\u201cOh that\u2019s right, have you registered for something yet?\u201dYue Zhishi nodded, taking a large sip of his soy milk. \u201cI registered for the clothing design competition, the preliminary round\u2019s on October 9th. I think I\u2019m definitely going to be busy over the National Day holiday.\u201d\u201cShit, isn\u2019t that the day before your birthday?\u201d Jiang Yufan gave him a chicken wing from his own plate of food. \u201cBut that\u2019s fine too, you can go directly home and celebrate afterwards since the results won\u2019t come out the same day.\u201dThat said, Yue Zhishi still felt a large amount of pressure from the clothing design competition. He might really like to draw, but he still wasn\u2019t someone officially studying clothing design. A large university such as this would definitely have some hidden dragons and crouching tigers, and Yue Zhishi was less confident the more he thought about it.Coincidentally, the faculty basketball team didn\u2019t have any matches lately, everyone busying themselves with the arts festival. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t go to training either, using all of his extra time on learning how to design clothes. He borrowed a bunch of books from the library, and he immersed himself completely, drawing designs in his dorm up until 1:30 in the morning.The paper quality of the sketchbooks from the university\u2019s stationery store was very ordinary. Drawing a few lines with his pencil, Yue Zhishi abruptly got lost in his thoughts.He thought of the leather-covered sketchbook Song Yu had given him when he graduated high school. Yue Zhishi had left it at home, not having brought it to campus; the paper quality of that sketchbook was the best he\u2019d ever used.So in the spur of the moment, Yue Zhishi sent Song Yu a message.[Le Le: Gege, where did you buy the sketchbook you gave me? Do you have a link? Or did you buy it in store.]Song Yu gave him a call directly without replying to his message. Yue Zhishi rushed out of his dorm as silently as he could, closing the door, and accepted the call once he entered the corridor.Song Yu\u2019s low and deep voice came through the phone. \u201cWhy are you still awake?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sketching some designs.\u201d Yue Zhishi really missed him as soon as he heard his voice. It felt like they\u2019d only seen each other during mealtimes the last few days. \u201cWhy are you awake too?\u201dThe sounds of typing transferred over through the speaker.\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with the data. I\u2019m trying to find out where we went wrong.\u201dYue Zhishi hummed in acknowledgement, and then he asked again about the sketchbook. The keyboard noises suddenly paused; Song Yu only spoke after a long moment passed. \u201cThat\u2019s not easy to buy.\u201d\u201cReally? Don\u2019t worry about it then. I just remembered it all of a sudden because the paper in it was so nice,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, his back resting against the wall.\u201c\u2026I can ask about it, if you want it.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t chat with him for too long, worried he would disturb Song Yu\u2019s work. After hanging up the call, he sent over\u00a0I really miss you, and Song Yu replied\u00a0Don\u2019t stay up too late.He decided he was going to bring back the sketchbook next time he went back home. There were too many drawings of Song Yu in that sketchbook \u2014 his face, his silhouette, and even his hands. In the past, Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t thought much of all of these drawings, but now that he was in a relationship with Song Yu, it was like they had all turned into pieces of evidence of his crush.No one had ever been like him, foolishly unaware of his own crush.Both of them were very busy over the one week holiday. Song Yu was taken by his advisor to attend a conference in Beijing, his return planned for the 9th. Yue Zhishi missed him terribly; this was Song Yu\u2019s first time away since they\u2019d officially gotten together. They talked on the phone every day, and whenever Yue Zhishi ran out of ideas for his designs, he\u2019d touch the turquoise sitting on his desk.At the tail end of the holiday break, Yue Zhishi returned home to have dinner with Lin Rong and Song Jin. But with the preliminary round upcoming, his designs had been stuck at a very tricky spot, light on inspiration, and he had no interest in resting. He stayed at home for only one day before he returned to campus, taking that grey-coloured sketchbook with him.The sky was also grey, as though it wanted to rain. Yue Zhishi slightly regretted focusing so much on chatting with Song Yu as he was leaving, instead of listening to Aunt Rong and putting on that denim jacket.He held his sketchbook, needing to take the subway by himself for over an hour before he could get back to campus. There were also over ten hours before he could see Song Yu, but Yue Zhishi held back from calling him, afraid he would take up his time.But unexpectedly, Song Yu sent him a message, asking him when he would arrive back to campus and even reminding him not to fall asleep on the train.Yue Zhishi honestly replied he still had five stops, and he also said he was extremely awake right now. He was just craving some milk tea.Song Yu didn\u2019t respond further, so Yue Zhishi put in his earphones to listen to music, pulling out the laptop in his bag to continue some sketches. He was so absorbed in his drawings that he almost missed his stop \u2014 he ran out of the carriage right as the doors were about to fully close. He released a breath in relief and got onto the escalators.Yue Zhishi was exhausted, carrying his bag. As he stood on the escalator, he thought \u2014 subway stations were truly very strange. They were clearly overflowing with people, and yet they didn\u2019t hold much evidence of human touch; they were like separate workstations on an urban assembly line.Every single figure came and went in a hurry, storming in before they were transferred over to the next workstation. Everyone stayed here very temporarily, very briefly \u2014 and yet they were separated for only a very short amount of time as well, all of their emotions flowing at an accelerated pace.Yue Zhishi was the slowest moving section in the tide in this sped up city. He held his drawings and wearily followed along with everyone else as they went towards the exit.The cold wind outside blew at him, and he shrunk his neck in, thinking it was about to rain soon. In the next moment, in the stream of people rushing and going, he caught sight of a wholly motionless form.Thinking he was mistaken, Yue Zhishi froze where he stood. The endless stream of people circled around him, as though he was a lifeless stone in the middle of the river currents.Except the other, initially still, stone moved, and it walked towards him step by step with a gentle and tender face.\u201cGone blank from being too tired?\u201dSong Yu wore a black windbreaker, a dark grey paper bag in his hand, and he stopped in front of Yue Zhishi. Seeing him wear only a thin hoodie without even a light coat, Song Yu asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d He pulled out a warm cup of milk tea from the bag and held it out to Yue Zhishi.Yue Zhishi\u2019s nose started to abruptly burn as he took it. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were coming back tomorrow? Why didn\u2019t you didn\u2019t say anything before coming back ahead of time\u2026\u201dHis voice was exceptionally soft in the noisy cacophony of the subway station. The tip of his nose was also slightly red, and a faint layer of tears covered his eyes. As he looked at him like this, an extraordinarily strange impulse, one that deviated from his original plans, suddenly grew in Song Yu\u2019s heart \u2014 he pulled Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm and took him to the bathroom in the subway station, not caring about anything else.Yue Zhishi asked him what he was doing, but Song Yu didn\u2019t respond. The bathroom was empty, but he tugged him into a cubicle, heading in himself and locking the door.\u201cWhat are we here for?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me to rely on you?\u201d Song Yu pressed him onto the cubicle door. \u201cI really missed you, and right now, I really need you.\u201dAnd with that, he lifted up Yue Zhishi\u2019s chin and kissed him.The kiss came without warning, leaving him undefended, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart was captured almost instantly.This kiss was completely different from the gentle touches from before; the aggression and possessiveness Song Yu usually hid so well erupted at this moment. Yue Zhishi\u2019s waist was tightly clutched as he was pressed against the door, and his tongue passively tangled with Song Yu\u2019s.In this cramped and intimate space, he heard the sound as the metal buckle on Song Yu\u2019s belt hit his waist \u2014 he also heard the slight sounds of their suckling, of their kissing. Reason made him a bit flustered, made him want to hold back.But desire and inhibition were always contrary to each other, and their lips and tongues were like crudely mating fishes, slippery and suggestive.Yue Zhishi\u2019s body weakened as he started to find it hard to breathe; his hands almost couldn\u2019t hold Song Yu anymore. Hearing the sounds of Yue Zhishi\u2019s breathing grow louder, Song Yu loosened his arms and retreated a slight distance.He watched as Yue Zhishi gulped in air against the wall, thinking he looked both pitiful and loveable. He couldn\u2019t help but caress Yue Zhishi\u2019s face; it was still a bit cold, so he could only pull him into his arms, enveloping him entirely in his windbreaker. Song Yu then raised a hand, softly stroking his back, and helped him breathe.Yue Zhishi panted as he leaned against his body. He felt like this Song Yu was an entirely different person compared to the Song Yu a few seconds ago.The pleasant smell on Song Yu\u2019s body wrapped around him, and it made him intoxicatingly, sweetly dizzy.\u201cIt takes so much out of you just to kiss\u2026\u201d Song Yu murmured next to his ear, his head lowered. Yue Zhishi\u2019s entire body felt both weak and numb at his voice \u2014 it was like he\u2019d been electrified. His ear tingled, and he subconsciously ducked his head away.But once he recovered, he felt like Song Yu\u2019s words sounded very incomplete, as though he still had a follow up sentence he\u2019d yet to say.Yue Zhishi tilted up his face, his gaze pure and innocent. \u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dThe author has something to say:Little Jade, something\u2019s not right with youPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He just continued hugging Song Yu\u2019s waist, resting on his body for a while. He waited until he felt better, and then he raised his face, very docilely pecking Song Yu\u2019s lips and whispering\u00a0I really missed you\u00a0multiple times.They were in an enclosed environment, and the bathroom smelled very strongly of an aromatherapy product. Worried it would irritate Yue Zhishi\u2019s breathing, Song Yu didn\u2019t want him to stay here for too long. He kissed Yue Zhishi\u2019s forehead, took off his windbreaker for him to wear and took him away.The cold wind rushed straight at them once they went back onto the street. Yue Zhishi followed Song Yu into his car, wrapped in his windbreaker, and he\u2019d just sat down when he straightforwardly asked, \u201cAre you going back to the dorm? Or the apartment?\u201dSong Yu fastened his seatbelt. \u201cThe apartment. My dorm mates are still in Beijing.\u201dYue Zhishi twisted over when he heard this and placed his hand on Song Yu\u2019s arm. \u201cThen can I go too? I want to go.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t immediately respond. He turned on the car, and then looked towards Yue Zhishi after a few moments. \u201cYou really aren\u2019t afraid of me at all.\u201dThat question came out as certainly as a declarative sentence, as though Yue Zhishi should actually guard against him a bit. After all, he had lost control just then \u2014 he hadn\u2019t cared about what time it was or where they were, let alone his own obsession with cleanliness.\u201cWhy would I be afraid of you?\u201d Yue Zhishi was slightly confused, adding a few seconds later, \u201cOh, but I am a little bit. I was really afraid of you getting angry when I was younger. Even though you wouldn\u2019t lose your temper at me, you wouldn\u2019t speak at all. I don\u2019t like it when you brood.\u201dThey were completely not on the same page at all. Song Yu gave up. He saw Yue Zhishi still clutching that sketchbook, and he was reminded of that paper bag he had been prepared to give him when they first saw each other; the entire matter had been tossed to the back of his mind because of that unplanned kiss. He pulled it over and handed it to Yue Zhishi.\u201cYou can put that in here.\u201d\u201cIs there anything else inside?\u201d Yue Zhishi saw it earlier and had been curious about why it was so large, thinking it was to only carry the milk tea. Glancing inside, he realised in astonishment that it held a new sketchbook with a dusty blue leather cover, and a block of cheese was also etched onto it.\u201cYou managed to get it?\u201d Yue Zhishi was very happily surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic, I really like this sketchbook.\u201d He stroked the small cheese design on the cover and curiously asked Song Yu, \u201cIs this the brand\u2019s logo?\u201dSong Yu vaguely said, \u201cSomething like that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so cute,\u201d Yue Zhishi said from the bottom of his heart. He even hugged the new sketchbook together with the old one.\u201cHow is it cute\u2026..\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice sounded uneasy.Giving up on trying to understand Song Yu\u2019s tastes, Yue Zhishi switched to ask about his Beijing conference. He only then learned that Song Yu had given up on the group activities on the final day \u2014 the academic conference had ended that morning, and he\u2019d bought the final flight back.\u201cYou should\u2019ve gone to the Great Wall with them.\u201d Yue Zhishi felt sorry for him.\u201cIt\u2019s too boring. I didn\u2019t want to go.\u201dThe sky darkened very rapidly, and by the time they arrived at the apartment, the sky had turned into full night. As Song Yu parked the car, Yue Zhishi suddenly realised: the car didn\u2019t smell of a scent diffuser. It held only the fragrance from Song Yu\u2019s body, as well as the very faint scent of leather that drifted up from the seats.Song Yu asked him about the arts festival when they were in the elevator. \u201cHow\u2019s your preparation going?\u201d\u201cCan I say not well?\u201d Yue Zhishi leaned against the elevator wall, looking at him. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t blindly encourage him like other people; instead, he very seriously asked why he felt that way.\u201cI\u2019m not professional at all.\u201d The elevator arrived at their floor. Yue Zhishi shifted the backpack on his body and followed behind Song Yu. \u201cI read through a lot of books lately, and I only just realised how hard it is to design clothes. There\u2019s so much professional knowledge I don\u2019t have, and so far, I still don\u2019t know how to differentiate between different kinds of fabrics.\u201dHe sighed. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have any inspiration right now. The theme for the preliminary round is \u2018lake\u2019. I thought it was a really simple theme at first \u2014 since we see lakes so often \u2014 but I wasn\u2019t satisfied with any of my designs after sketching out a lot. Plus the preliminary round\u2019s tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYou still have some time.\u201d Song Yu sounded like he was the organiser of the competition. \u201cThe preliminary round won\u2019t be that strict. As long as you give them completed design drafts and ideas, there\u2019s no reason for them not to pass you.\u201d\u201cReally? Then what should I do in the later stages? I\u2019ll need to personally make the clothes\u2026\u201dSong Yu swiped the keycard, pushing open the door, and took Yue Zhishi\u2019s bag to place it down in the entrance hall. He then put his hand on the top of Yue Zhishi\u2019s head. \u201cHow remarkable. You\u2019re a child who can even make clothes with his own two hands now.\u201dThat sentence, paired with the imperturbable look on his indifferent face, sounded cute in a strange way. It was like he was a robot complimenting his little master according to his inbuilt programs, and at this thought, Yue Zhishi burst into laughter and glommed onto Song Yu.\u201cYou\u2019re so funny.\u201d He rested his chin on the top of Song Yu\u2019s shoulder.Song Yu found it very peculiar \u2014 no matter if it was \u2018cute\u2019 or \u2018funny\u2019, both of those descriptions didn\u2019t match him at all. But he still hugged Yue Zhishi back, even lifting him up in his arms without a single prior warning. He only let him down after Yue Zhishi called out ge in alarm.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t lost weight,\u201d Song Yu said, as if to himself.Yue Zhishi laughed again. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a few days, how could I lose weight?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s hand lay on his lower back, and he said, very mildly, \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s been a long time.\u201dAt these words, Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart stumbled slightly.He didn\u2019t know where he found the courage, but he caught Song Yu\u2019s hand and tugged him towards into the apartment. The curtains in the living room had yet to be pulled down, and the semi-dark space looked almost dark blue, like another lake. They headed towards the island in the middle \u2014 the soft sofa. Yue Zhishi loosened his hand and lightly pushed Song Yu\u2019s shoulder, hinting at him to sit on the sofa; he himself sat on top of Song Yu\u2019s thighs.In the dimly lit space, he could see the touch of uncertainty in Song Yu\u2019s eyes. Yue Zhishi took off the windbreaker and circled his arms around Song Yu\u2019s neck. \u201cI keep remembering about the kiss that was interrupted last time.\u201dHis voice seemed thin and flimsy in the empty room \u2014 but it was because it was too quiet here, and even the sound of his breathing became very obvious.\u201cAnd I remember how it was interrupted. I also remember how much pain you were in afterwards, because we did something bad and because it might hurt your mom.\u201dThe puffs of air from Yue Zhishi\u2019s nose approached Song Yu, and there was a minute change in the tone of his voice.\u201cBut for some reason, I think I like this feeling.\u201dSong Yu found it odd how this person, who had no knowledge of sexual desire at all, could display such a delicate, inexperienced allure at this very moment.\u201cWhat feeling?\u201d He wrapped his arms around Yue Zhishi\u2019s waist.\u201cThe feeling of doing wrong things with you.\u201d Once those words left his mouth, Yue Zhishi lowered his head, leaned in and did what he really, really wanted to do.Song Yu\u2019s lips were a bit cold, but they were very soft and supple; Yue Zhishi\u2019s breathing was unsteady almost in the span of one moment.He tried copying what Song Yu did in order to become the person in control, but he sensed that he wasn\u2019t doing it well as he pressed their lips together, gently rubbing or sucking. He could even sense that his movements were making Song Yu impatient, because he tightened his hold on him until their chests pressed together.He felt constricted, and it became even harder to breathe.Within this clumsy kiss, like a child filled with reluctance to leave, Yue Zhishi intermittently called out for his gege, but little by little, he lost that brief moment of control. Song Yu\u2019s entire person lurched forward to save the body that subconsciously pulled away in shyness \u2014 he clamped onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s waist, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s upper body arched backwards under the rising moon.Song Yu\u2019s kiss swallowed his breaths like lake water, the illusionary feeling of having an allergic attack once again appearing. Yue Zhishi tightly grasped onto Song Yu\u2019s clothes, and his mouth opened, separating from the kiss, in the fluster of him tilting backwards. He was like a drowning man desperately struggling for the surface of the water, seeking just one breath.So Song Yu\u2019s lips started to move downwards, leaving behind traces of moisture on his flushed neck.\u201cGe\u2026\u201dOnly one sound had left his mouth when Yue Zhishi\u2019s entire world spun. He was set down onto the sofa, his back sinking deeply into softness.Song Yu rushed on top of him, and he watched as the gleaming shimmer of the lake outside the window suddenly landed on Song Yu\u2019s right eye and temple. The cool toned ray of light floated suggestively on his handsome face, as though it yearned to rise and fall.He was the lake that was about to swallow him whole.Song Yu propped himself up with a hand on the edge of the sofa, just about to lower his head to kiss \u2014 and then abruptly, Yue Zhishi prevented him from doing so. \u201cI got it!\u201dSeeing him like that, Song Yu paused, puzzled. Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes were bright and luminous, and the look on his face changed from the dazed confusion from before to a vivid liveliness, as though he\u2019d been suddenly injected with something.\u201cGege, wait a bit. Get up first. I just had a great stroke of inspiration.\u201d He wormed out from the narrow gap in between Song Yu\u2019s arms, ran to the entrance hall and turned back to him after rummaging through his bag, the sketchbook and pens in his arms.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Song Yu noticed his voice was somewhat hoarse, so he cleared his throat.\u201cI know how to express the theme now. It doesn\u2019t have to be the richly green lake water of lovely weather days \u2014 the lake is also very beautiful in the dark.\u201d Yue Zhishi was extremely excited. He pretty much forgot that the collar of his hoodie had been pulled to one side, a stretch of his glowing, pale collarbones still exposed.Song Yu turned his face away and didn\u2019t look at it. Yue Zhishi even ran over on purpose and kissed Song Yu\u2019s cheek very generously. \u201cThe light from the lake on your face just then was so beautiful, and it was that moment that inspired me. Thank you.\u201dHe sat down on the floor, cross-legged, as soon as he finished speaking. He borrowed the shimmers from the lake, his pen flying across the paper as he outlined the design. He shared his thoughts with Song Yu, saying, \u201cI want the base to be a wide swath of black and dark blue colours. And then with something like silver tulle, the raised neckline would make it look almost submerged \u2014 as well as with silver embellishments.\u201dYue Zhishi raised his head and looked towards Song Yu. \u201cI\u2019ve even thought of the make-up. I want the same kind of effect as when you were on top of me.\u201dSong Yu nodded, looking like he was slightly dissatisfied. He half-crouched in front of Yue Zhishi and pulled up his chin, forcing him to give him a kiss. He acted a bit ferociously and rose up before Yue Zhishi realised what was happening, turning on the lights in the living room for him.As he picked up the windbreaker from the floor and turned to leave, Yue Zhishi reached out a hand and caught Song Yu\u2019s calf. His eyes were still focused on his sketchbook, and yet his voice carried a coquettish lilt that was hard to detect. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cTo shower.\u201d\u201cYou have to turn the water up a bit warmer, or else you might catch a cold.\u201dSong Yu rather suspected he said it on purpose.Since he now had an idea, Yue Zhishi was filled with energy, and he was swiftly immersed into his work.He first drew out his general ideas on paper, and then he went upstairs with his bag, sitting down in front of the desk in his room. He completed his first draft with his drawing tablet and laptop. Even though it was just the preliminary round in his school, Yue Zhishi still wanted to do his best, unwilling to just go through the motions. Following the theme of \u2018lake\u2019, he drew five pieces, the main colours being a subdued black, navy blue and dark turquoise, and used thin, sheer fabrics on the clothing shapes to portray the sensation of rippling water.Song Yu came out of the bathroom in his pyjamas and went to stand behind Yue Zhishi, staring at the screen.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Yue Zhishi freed up a hand to search for Song Yu\u2019s hand, but he couldn\u2019t find it no matter where he groped \u2014 Song Yu caught him instead.\u201cDon\u2019t cause trouble again,\u201d Song Yu quietly said.Yue Zhishi felt like he wasn\u2019t causing trouble at all, let alone \u2018again\u2019. He squeezed Song Yu\u2019s hand, assuring him, \u201cWait for me, I\u2019ll go shower once I finish.\u201dThis wait took a few hours. By the time Yue Zhishi finished colouring in his last piece, it was already close to midnight. Looking over, he realised Song Yu was already asleep on the bed, so he softly creeped to the bathroom downstairs, speedily cleaning up before he crawled into Song Yu\u2019s blanket.He\u2019d just gotten in when Song Yu appeared to wake up, his eyebrows drawing together. Yue Zhishi was somewhat dismayed, but in the next second, the semiconscious Song Yu wrapped his arms around him, pulling him into his embrace.\u201cHave you finished\u2026.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice sounded very muffled, very hoarse.\u201cMn.\u201d Yue Zhishi kissed his neck. \u201cThankfully I have you, or else I wouldn\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done tomorrow.\u201dSong Yu made a vague noise in response, and his hand slipped under the edge of Yue Zhishi\u2019s pyjamas, touching the bare skin of his back.\u201cStill want to do wrong things?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s face suddenly burned, his lower back tingling. \u201cAh\u2026\u201dA very light noise came from Song Yu\u2019s noise, and it sounded like a laugh. He caressed Yue Zhishi\u2019s spine. \u201cSleep.\u201dWith an early class that morning, Yue Zhishi got out of bed early together with Song Yu. He arrived on campus in Song Yu\u2019s car and edited his drafted designs after lunch, quickly putting them into a powerpoint.The preliminary round was each school\u2019s selection of competitors \u2014 the ones who got through would enter the university\u2019s competition in a team. The rules for the preliminary round were relatively simple because of that reason; everyone only needed to submit their design drafts. They were not required to actually construct the clothes. The preliminary rounds for both the law school and journalism and communication school were both on the 9th, and they were also in the same multimedia classroom.The round for the journalism and communication school was booked for 2pm to 4pm, while the law school was for 4pm to 6pm. Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t stand waiting in his dorm after finishing his powerpoint, so he went over at 3pm.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous don\u2019t be nervous.\u201d Jiang Yufan went with him, and he squeezed Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou definitely can get in. It\u2019s not easy getting into the school team, so don\u2019t you worry.\u201dThere were other people other than the two of them in the corridor; there were quite a few law students who\u2019d arrived early just like Yue Zhishi. Song Yu couldn\u2019t come with him because he had a class. Yue Zhishi sneaked a look at the window, but he couldn\u2019t see anything \u2014 the curtains on the inside were drawn.\u201cLet me through.\u201d A voice came from behind them, and Yue Zhishi subconsciously shifted to the side, his back supported by the wall.A guy wearing streetwear with vintage translucent orange glasses walked passed him, his chin jutted high. He carried a set of sample clothes that were covered.\u201cLet me through, I want to go in.\u201dJiang Yufan scoffed in contempt once that guy went inside. \u201cHe must be a crab to have to walk sideways.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t stop himself from emotionally sighing; he\u2019d watched him the entire way until he entered the classroom.That guy definitely wasn\u2019t someone simple. The preliminary round started at 2pm, and yet he arrived fashionably late at 3pm. He wasn\u2019t nervous at all, even going above and beyond the requirements to make clothing samples.\u201cWhat\u2019s so amazing about him?\u201d Jiang Yufan grasped Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulders very protectively and shook him. \u201cYou are the best. Understand?!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s pretty strong.\u201d Next to them, a girl also from the law school spoke, looking as though she recognised the person who\u2019d just gone in. \u201cMy boyfriend\u2019s in journalism, and he says that guy is most famous person in the school\u2019s new students. He\u2019s called Xu Lin. His dad\u2019s a television news anchor, and his mom is quite a famous fashion designer. Both of them could be judges for our competition.\u201dIt was like Jiang Yufan was suddenly enlightened. \u201cOoh, so the child\u2019s following his mother\u2019s footsteps. No wonder he looked so arrogant.\u201dThat girl said again, \u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t expect him to participate as well. Looks like the first place this year will belong to the journalism and communication school.\u201dJiang Yufan nudged Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder when he saw he wasn\u2019t speaking. \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous.\u201d\u201cMn, I\u2019m okay.\u201d He had been so panicked before yesterday, but Yue Zhishi felt like he\u2019d already stopped being nervous \u2014 he didn\u2019t know why. He was only a bit curious about how everyone else\u2019s designs looked.He took out a piece of milk candy from his pocket, chucking it into his mouth.The journalism school\u2019s preliminary round finished at the same time he finished his candy.The door opened, a bunch of people coming out, and the guy called Xu Lin took the lead in exiting. This time, his orange glasses were pushed to the top of his head, his long and narrow eyes full of confidence. He was even leisurely chewing bubble gum, and he was still holding his set of sample clothes.There were quite a few people surrounding him. A short guy next to him was flattering him, saying, \u201cYou\u2019ll definitely get into the school team. You\u2019re already giving the competition face by participating in the preliminary round, and you even prepared so seriously \u2014 it was virtually an overpowered attack.\u201dXu Lin arched an eyebrow, and he didn\u2019t give either a response or an opinion; it seemed like he tacitly agreed.When he passed Yue Zhishi, Xu Lin gave him a long look before walking past and turning around again. Yue Zhishi\u2019s brain was currently filled with all the commentary he needed to say, so he walked around him to enter the classroom, not realising someone was looking at him at all.\u201cHey.\u201dYue Zhishi still wasn\u2019t aware of what was happening, until someone circled around and ran in front of him \u2014 it was Xu Lin.\u201cWhat school are you from? The law school?\u201d Xu Lin asked.Jiang Yufan didn\u2019t like his attitude. \u201cWhat are you \u2018hey\u2019ing for, don\u2019t you know how to say fellow student.\u201dYue Zhishi had a good temper, so he nodded at Xu Lin. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAre you also participating in this?\u201d Xu Lin\u2019s eyes measured Yue Zhishi from top to bottom once. \u201cAs a model, right? Models actually didn\u2019t need to come today.\u201dHe walked over to study Yue Zhishi\u2019s profile, nodding to himself. \u201cYour body proportions are quite good, and your features are also outstanding. It\u2019d be such a pity if credentials as good as this went to be a model for the law school\u2026 Why don\u2019t I hire you, and you can be my model?\u201dJiang Yufan laughed in anger, seeing how confident he was. \u201cDon\u2019t you journalism students have people? Poaching from the law school \u2014 who would the championship belong to if you win?\u201dHe\u2019d been misunderstood completely.Yue Zhishi looked at Xu Lin and said, extremely candidly, \u201cFellow student, you\u2019re mistaken. I\u2019m not a model. I registered for the clothing design competition.\u201dThe look on the other person\u2019s face changed \u2014 disbelief covered his entire face, and he even pulled down the orange glasses on top of his head to put them on his nose again. He sized him up once more. \u201cAre you serious? Does the law school not have anyone else to design if they\u2019re planting a model seedling into the hill of design?\u201d\u201cNo one said what a model should look like or what a designer should look like.\u201d Yue Zhishi smiled at him. \u201cYou\u2019re someone from the fashion industry. You should be more open and tolerant than us.\u201dBut this Xu Lin had a strange personality as well, and he refused to give up. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to go. I\u2019ll tell you directly, the law school doesn\u2019t have much talented people. It\u2019ll be a waste even if you get into the team. Why don\u2019t you come to me \u2014 I can guarantee that I\u2019ll absolutely make you shine at the fashion show.\u201dJiang Yufan was rather worried. Yue Zhishi was famous for being soft, unable to reject anyone. It would be terrible if he really did end up being persuaded by this guy.\u201cLe Le\u2026\u201dUnexpectedly, Yue Zhishi spoke first. It was an ill-timed thought, but he thought of those words Song Yu had said not too long ago \u2014 and decided to take the first step towards being a qualified adult.\u201cThank you for recognising my outer credentials.\u201d He spoke gently, a sincere smile on his face. Xu Lin thought he\u2019d been convinced, crossing his arms across his chest in extreme satisfaction, but Yue Zhishi\u2019s next words deviated from what he imagined.\u201cBut I apologise, I still refuse your offer. I decided to participate as a designer from the very beginning, and if I can enter my school\u2019s design team and contribute, I\u2019d be honoured beyond measure. I have never considered any other option.\u201dXu Lin looked like he couldn\u2019t understand him at all. He even looked as though he was about to roll his eyes at him, before he held himself back. But his chin was still angled highly, and he still held that utter confidence in himself. \u201cYou\u2019ll regret it.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201dYue Zhishi was still smiling, and he shrugged.\u201cAnd I don\u2019t need other people to make me shine. I can do it myself.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was in charge of running the preliminary round, and she got all of the contestants to line up and pick a number. There were about fifty of them. Yue Zhishi was in the back of the line, and when Nan Jia saw him, she gave him a smile, very softly saying\u00a0jiayou.\u201cWhich number are you?\u201d\u201c49. Second from the last.\u201d Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t think it was a good or a bad number, even though many people thought those near the end would be at a disadvantage.He and Jiang Yufan headed towards the back of the classroom, sitting down once they found a row of empty seats. Jiang Yufan was even more nervous than Yue Zhishi as he watched the other students go up and explain their inspirations \u2014 he even felt a bit suffocated, and he ran to open the back door behind their seats.\u201cThis is so hard. Even the audition for my comedy play wasn\u2019t so difficult.\u201d He ran back to sit next to Yue Zhishi.Yue Zhishi nodded. \u201cThen that means you\u2019re definitely talented at acting.\u201dJiang Yufan comforted him too. \u201cYou can definitely get through. Don\u2019t listen to that four-eyes and his nonsense.\u201dYue Zhishi chuckled; he actually hadn\u2019t been irritated by what Xu Lin said. On the contrary, his fighting spirit was ignited in a way: he hoped he could successfully enter the design team and compete against Xu Lin directly.The law school\u2019s contestants brought up their work one after another, explaining their thinking process. After receiving the theme of \u2018lake\u2019, everyone\u2019s design styles were fundamentally the same and were just like Yue Zhishi\u2019s designs from before. The most common colours were green, blue and lake green, and the designs leaned heavily on the\u00a0gradient colours\u00a0of\u00a0water sleeves\u00a0as well as other traditional Chinese styles. There were a few designs that were astonishingly similar. Yue Zhishi saw the judges whispering with their heads together, the looks on their faces not ideal.\u201cTheir concepts are so similar.\u201d Jiang Yufan knew he wasn\u2019t an expert, so he only whispered as he sat next to Yue Zhishi. \u201cI\u2019d believe it if someone said they were all designed by the same person.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded, and just as he was about to speak, a delicately pretty girl walked onto the stage. She wore a\u00a0hanfu, and her voice was very thin and very timid \u2014 but one of her sentences captured Yue Zhishi\u2019s attention.\u201cI made my outfit myself.\u201dThe judges sitting below were also extremely surprised, all of them nodding. \u201cYou\u2019ve done well. We wouldn\u2019t have realised if you didn\u2019t tell us.\u201dJiang Yufan looked at her powerpoint and leaned closely to Yue Zhishi, saying, \u201cBut her designs aren\u2019t too different from the ones earlier. It still gives off the feeling of\u00a0Chinese water ink paintings.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Yue Zhishi explained, \u201cThe arts festival is a group competition between different schools, just like your comedy play. Each team needs to design, but they still need to create outfits for models to wear \u2014 so they also need someone who can construct the end product. Her chances of getting in are slightly higher.\u201dJiang Yufan understood. But he felt like it was very strange: everyone around them who had yet to go up was continuously looking over their own powerpoint and design drafts, preparing their commentary. Only Yue Zhishi listened with great interest as other people presented their works, and he even noted down the contestant names and designs that he liked, as though he was a judge.When it came time for Yue Zhishi to go up, he didn\u2019t look too different from usual. He gave the judges below him a smile after he opened up his powerpoint, and he opened his speech very naturally. Jiang Yufan sat below, and he saw quite a few girls in the front rows lifting up their phones, cameras all faced towards Yue Zhishi.\u201cThese are the five designs I created using the theme of \u2018lake\u2019.\u201d His digital drawings were projected onto the screen: three sets of womenswear and two sets of menswear. The designs were dreamlike and coolly elegant. \u201cI was inspired by the lake water at nightfall, so I used large areas of dark colours with silver decorations and light polarisation in my designs. The first outfit is a long satin dress. I\u2019ve cut the dress so that it simulates the flowing of water, and the silver and blue polarisation reflects the shimmering nature of lake water.\u201dHe simply explained his designs, and the judges nodded again and again. One of them particularly asked, \u201cYour idea is very unique. Can you share with us your thinking process and the source of your inspiration?\u201dYue Zhishi glanced at the backdoor as he listened to the judge\u2019s question. Coincidentally, he saw someone enter the backdoor \u2014 and that person wasn\u2019t a random someone. It just so happened to be his \u2018source of inspiration\u2019.Song Yu was wearing a white button-down shirt and a large lead grey coat. Combined with his silver glasses, he looked both distinctive and refined, and he silently sat at the last row of seats, his eyes focused on Yue Zhishi.\u201cInspiration\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi, who\u2019d originally been speaking smoothly, suddenly had his words stuck in his throat. His light-coloured cheeks were almost completely suffused with colour. Pursing his lips, he still gave them a very candid answer. \u201cThe inspiration came from someone very important to me.\u201dThe few contestants below the stage started talking; they were all students in the law school, and it wasn\u2019t a large circle. Yue Zhishi had been the most popular new student in the school since he started, and no one expected to hear such gossip during the preliminary round.Jiang Yufan was first shocked \u2014 and then he frowned, thinking.He felt it was very likely that the important person was Yue Zhishi\u2019s older brother. After all, this child was an older brother-con who knew nothing else.But he never thought Yue Zhishi would say his next sentence.\u201cI saw the lights from the lake reflected on that person\u2019s face one night. It was very beautiful.\u201dJiang Yufan thought it wasn\u2019t his older brother after hearing that \u2014 but he still didn\u2019t dare believe Yue Zhishi had a girl he liked and didn\u2019t tell him. His heart hurt.Yue Zhishi lowered his eyes, his eyelashes concealing some of his emotions. And yet his ears were still red, as though he\u2019d transformed into a pure and bashful youth from the confident and easygoing designer from before. \u201c\u2026I was stunned. I was inspired at that moment. I initially thought the same as everyone else and confined my \u2018lake\u2019 to how it looked during the day: a pool with crystal clear green water. But a lake at night, with its flickers and glow, is also breathtaking. It\u2019s aloof and mysterious.\u201dThe judge nodded in praise. \u201cVery good. Your idea is very rare, and you managed to convey the sense of beauty very well. Your background story is also quite engaging.\u201d The people down below all laughed.\u201cAll right. Next person, please.\u201dYue Zhishi came down from the stage, but he didn\u2019t go directly to sit next to Song Yu. He walked with his head lowered all the way to his previous seat; he felt very warm, so he unzipped his sweater, taking it off. He wore only a thin cotton shirt with long sleeves, and he flopped onto the desk. Jiang Yufan leaned in to speak to him, even slipping an arm around his shoulders.From Song Yu\u2019s perspective, the sight of Yue Zhishi from the back was always so cute \u2014 with his slightly curly hair, he looked like a stuffed toy.\u201cYou\u2019re too amazing. Your design is especially striking, I think you\u2019ll definitely get into the team.\u201d Jiang Yufan\u2019s gossipy heart awakened. \u201cBut that important person you were just talking about\u2026 who is it, and why didn\u2019t I know this person existed?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t find a suitable reason to explain it away in the spur of the moment. Besides, his entire brain was currently filled with Song Yu.His phone abruptly vibrated, and Yue Zhishi looked down to check.[Gege: Put on your jacket.]Once he saw that message, he finally couldn\u2019t hold himself back from turning around.Song Yu was steadily looking at him, his gaze warm. Yue Zhishi was very aware that his face was the same one he\u2019d tried to hide in his designs; he didn\u2019t want the model to look too similar to Song Yu. He\u2019d edited his designs many times, and yet no matter how unrecognisably he changed them, there was no way he could conceal the heart that liked him.He turned his head back to the front, and pulled his jacket back on.The final person\u2019s explanation finished at this moment, and the people around him all stood up to go outside. Some of them went towards the backdoor, while some of them headed to the front. Anyone who walked past Song Yu also looked at him, and after a good few people did the same thing, Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t sit still anymore. He rose up, walked towards Song Yu and stopped in front of him.Seeing Yue Zhishi leaving, Jiang Yufan also followed behind. When he unexpectedly saw Song Yu, he hurriedly greeted him. \u201cSenior, why\u2019d you come?\u201d\u201cI heard there was a preliminary round here. I just wanted to have a look.\u201d Song Yu stood up as well, and he walked out of the classroom shoulder to shoulder with Yue Zhishi.The outside sky was slowly darkening. In a hurry to have dinner with his girlfriend, Jiang Yufan rushed away, saying he\u2019d bring something delicious back to the dorm for Yue Zhishi. Only the two of them remained, and Yue Zhishi shifted closer to Song Yu.Song Yu thought he was cold and wanted to take off his own heavy coat. Yue Zhishi quickly realised what he was doing and stopped him. \u201cMy jacket\u2019s very warm.\u201d He pressed down on Song Yu\u2019s arm before releasing it and continued to walk, sticking closely to him. He asked the same question Jiang Yufan had asked earlier. \u201cWhy\u2019d you come?\u201dBut Song Yu gave a different response.\u201cI came to see what good thing you managed to do by using me.\u201dThere was a bit of teasing underlying his words, and Yue Zhishi felt apologetic \u2014 but he also felt Song Yu was being very cute. He couldn\u2019t help but stroke his arm. \u201cThen what did you think?\u201dNow, Song Yu didn\u2019t tease him. He faintly nodded, his voice serious. \u201cVery well designed. Maybe you can also try getting into that field.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still far from doing it professionally.\u201d Yue Zhishi felt his words were already very high praise. He puffed up in pride, like a balloon filled up with air that floated up to the sky. He wanted to hold hands, but he needed to hold back; there were too many people.Song Yu took him to a very hidden little restaurant. It wasn\u2019t on campus and was outside of the professors\u2019 residential buildings, with most of its customers living in that neighbourhood. He ordered a\u00a0chicken soup simmered in a clay pot, and it held meticulously stewed chestnuts and orange\u00a0cordyceps militaris fungus. He also ordered a large portion of the\u00a0stewed meat dish\u00a0Yue Zhishi enjoyed, and the porcelain soup bowl was packed to the brim, a layer of bright and glossy chili oil poured over the top with white sesame seeds sprinkled everywhere.Steaming bowls of rice were delivered, and Yue Zhishi poured a spoonful of the heavily aromatic sauce over his bowl. He mixed it all together and stuffed a large portion into his mouth \u2014 the rice, mixed with the sauce, was both flavourful and chewy, and it was a very simple and homey taste.The stewed meat dish at this restaurant reminded Yue Zhishi of the Grandma\u2019s Stewed Flavour in front of their high school. He had only eaten one bite, and yet he thought of why he\u2019d needed to hide from the rain, thought of Song Yu picking him up from the corridor with his umbrella.In a daze, Yue Zhishi thought \u2014 perhaps he\u2019d already liked Song Yu by then, just a little. He just hadn\u2019t realised.Or else why would he have been afraid of staying at that corridor by himself after Song Yu graduated.But if Yue Zhishi tried to look back on his feelings, he truly might not be able to find when his feelings started to change \u2014 because from the day he met Song Yu, he had already liked him, very much.Song Yu ate a bit more than he usually did, so Yue Zhishi asked, \u201cDo you really like this place? It feels like you have a good appetite.\u201d\u201cI just felt like you would like this place.\u201d Song Yu then explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to eat lunch, so I\u2019m eating both meals at the same time.\u201dYue Zhishi was extremely unhappy at how he didn\u2019t take care of himself. \u201cYou can\u2019t be like that. You should\u2019ve told me if you didn\u2019t have time to eat, I could\u2019ve delivered some food to you.\u201d\u201cYou had your preliminary round in the afternoon.\u201dThe subtext underneath Song Yu\u2019s words was quite clear, but Yue Zhishi refused to care. \u201cYou should\u2019ve told me anyway. Nothing\u2019s more important than you.\u201dHis voice was a bit loud, and the couple next to them glanced at them before turning back to their own food.Song Yu quietly pulled off the skin and bones from a piece of chicken with his chopsticks, dunking the flesh into the dipping sauce before placing it into Yue Zhishi\u2019s bowl. It was like he was\u00a0 both surrendering and consoling, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice softened. \u201cYou need to tell me next time.\u201d\u201cI will,\u201d Song Yu said solemnly.Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart felt better, and he devoured the piece of chicken Song Yu gave him. He then said, \u201cI\u2019m going to remind you about all three meals in a day.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dSong Yu knew he didn\u2019t need to say why he didn\u2019t end up eating lunch; it would only worry Yue Zhishi. But he couldn\u2019t hold back his tongue \u2014 and so he saw Yue Zhishi anxious for him, saw Yue Zhishi throw a small, rarely seen fit of temper for him.Song Yu sometimes really needed a thing like this in order to prove something \u2014 so that his heart that increasingly craved Yue Zhishi could find a place to stand.But in the end, he still didn\u2019t want Yue Zhishi to be worried about him, so he added, \u201cIt\u2019s only because I want to change research areas in the future. I might need to change research groups, so I want to quickly produce some results and pass as soon as possible. It\u2019ll be fine after this busy period.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that simple in reality. He\u2019d stayed in his professor\u2019s office from 3 to 5:30pm, listening as his professor said many things he wasn\u2019t willing to hear \u2014 including things that weren\u2019t related to his studies. He\u2019d almost missed Yue Zhishi\u2019s preliminary round because of it, but luckily Yue Zhishi was the second to the last person to present his designs.Yue Zhishi understood Song Yu; he\u2019d undertaken a large portion of the work in his previous group. His advisor must be reluctant to let him go.\u201cThen did your advisor agree to you leaving?\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t answer him directly, and he even carried a touch of emotions as he spoke.\u201cTo be precise, he\u2019s just my undergraduate advisor. I still haven\u2019t graduated, and I haven\u2019t started my postgraduate work yet. It\u2019s not up to him to agree.\u201dSong Yu also said, \u201cA different advisor is now in charge of the group I want to get into. I\u2019ll most likely head to him once it\u2019s confirmed I don\u2019t need to take the postgraduate entrance exam.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t really understand his field, so he didn\u2019t continue to query. \u201cIn any case, I\u2019ll get angry if you don\u2019t take care of yourself.\u201d\u201cYou never used to get angry,\u201d Song Yu said, \u201cunless you were sick.\u201dYue Zhishi thought to himself, he didn\u2019t get angry at Song Yu because he didn\u2019t have the status to do so.\u201cI\u2019ll get angry now, and I\u2019ll even lose my temper at you.\u201d Yue Zhishi propped up his chin with his hands. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t get sick, you can lose your temper however you\u2019d like.\u201dThere was no reason for Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart not to weaken after hearing something like that. He couldn\u2019t help it \u2014 he squeezed Song Yu\u2019s ankles between his calves, covertly acting cutely spoiled.After finishing their meal, they headed towards campus from the residential area\u2019s entrance, holding hands for three minutes in the dim alleyways. It was such a short amount of time, but a layer of sweat still grew on the palm of Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand. He couldn\u2019t tell if it was because he was too nervous or if it was because he liked doing it too much \u2014 or maybe it was because of both those reasons.They passed by the\u00a0Plum Garden playground, and they saw the movie playing in the open air cinema as well as the large crowds of people. Yue Zhishi only then remembered today was Friday.\u201cThere\u2019s so many people.\u201d He gazed at the cinema screen as he continued walking. He could vaguely see the faces of the male and female lead actors; it was a European romantic film.With just a glimpse at his face, Song Yu knew Yue Zhishi wanted to go watch. He promptly headed in that direction without asking, and Yue Zhishi was like a small animal who couldn\u2019t leave his master\u2019s side, rushing immediately to him as soon as he walked in a different direction. He once again stuck closely to Song Yu\u2019s arm.\u201cAre we going to watch the movie?\u201d His voice was a bit excited.\u201cMn.\u201dThere were too many people, so Song Yu reached out a hand to lightly hold onto Yue Zhishi. There were already no spots to sit in; they could only stand and watch, and they stood at the tail end of a crowd of people. The male and female leads in the movie were strolling on the river bank at dusk, talking about a book they both liked. The female lead unexpectedly changed the subject and said today was her birthday. Yue Zhishi foolishly said to the screen, \u201cWhat a coincidence. My birthday\u2019s tomorrow.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s mouth curled up, and he smoothened out Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair that had been blown into a mess by the wind. He pulled up the hood of Yue Zhishi\u2019s jacket for him and said he was going to buy some water, asking if there was anything Yue Zhishi wanted.Yue Zhishi shook his head. It was rare for him to not request anything, only telling Song Yu to quickly come back.More and more people started to arrive. Everyone huddled together within the darkness, many of them paired up into couples. Yue Zhishi even saw someone that looked like Qin Yan near the right hand side of the screen, but with so many people, he couldn\u2019t see clearly. He rose up on his toes, curving his head over, and the guy that resembled Qin Yan was kissing his girlfriend just as he once again looked over.Yue Zhishi\u2019s face slightly flushed \u2014 it felt like he was peeping. When he dropped his feet back to the ground, he lost his balance and accidentally leaned backwards. A hand supported his lower back; without even turning his head around, he knew it was Song Yu.\u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201dSong Yu nodded. There was no water in the convenience store bag in his hand, only a box of cheesecake.\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like eating sweet stuff?\u201d Yue Zhishi pulled out the cake, opening it. The fragrance of cream was very rich.\u201cI bought it for you.\u201d Song Yu said, \u201cIt was the only cake without flour. Mom said she\u2019d make and bring over your birthday cake tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Yue Zhishi picked up the plastic spoon, wanting to take a bite, but Song Yu stopped him.On the screen, the male lead sang happy birthday to the female lead. Song Yu asked, \u201cCan we celebrate your birthday a day early?\u201dThis request of his was very unreasonable, and came a bit rashly. No one would carry a small cake worth only a small amount of money, bought from the fridge of a convenience store, and ask the person they liked if they could consider today their birthday. There was no present, and no surprise.But it just so happened that Yue Zhishi was someone who would definitely agree.\u201cSure.\u201d Standing in the midst of the multitude of people and cold wind, Yue Zhishi smiled very sweetly. On the big screen not too far away, the male lead pulled out a lighter \u2014 he used the tongue of flame as a candle, easing it closely to the female lead and saying, make a wish.The screen\u2019s brightness illuminated Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. He asked Song Yu, \u201cSince there\u2019s no candle, are we still making a wish?\u201d\u201cI do have candles.\u201d Song Yu drew out a box of\u00a0Pejoy biscuits\u00a0from his pocket. If Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t mention the issue of making a wish, he had decided to not reveal this stupid method of his. He didn\u2019t want to admit that he\u2019d stayed in the store for a further five minutes just to search for a candle replacement.He inserted the slender matcha flavoured sticks into the cake, and then he said, \u201cThese are candles.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t contradict him, merely closing his eyes as he continued smiling. He then opened his eyes and blew, his acting realistic. Now that the biscuits had completed their jobs as candles, Song Yu took them out. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat these.\u201d\u201cAre they yummy?\u201d Yue Zhishi curiously asked.\u201cThey\u2019re okay.\u201d Song Yu didn\u2019t want him to get greedy, even though Yue Zhishi was no longer the child who would cry if he couldn\u2019t eat something.Yue Zhishi took a bite of the cake and also fed Song Yu a mouthful. The male and female leads in the movie also finished their simple birthday celebration.\u201cWhy did you want to celebrate it early?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked, his voice muffled.Song Yu quietly stood there for a moment, his eyes gazing into the distance. \u201cThere will be a lot of people tomorrow. Everyone will be coming to celebrate with you.\u201dOnly then did Yue Zhishi understand. Song Yu wanted to celebrate one of his birthdays with him alone. Even if he was truly very busy with no time to eat and everything was distinctly unprepared and hasty \u2014 he still wanted it.\u201cIt\u2019s so cold, it\u2019s so cold.\u201d Yue Zhishi spoke extremely loudly on purpose. Some people around them twisted their heads over to look at him, and then he pretended to look like he was fooling around; he pulled open Song Yu\u2019s coat and tunnelled in, saying, \u201cCover me up.\u201dSong Yu initially felt what he was doing was peculiar, but then he saw the people around them chuckling as they looked at the two of them before they turned back around to continue watching the movie. The sky was now fully dark \u2014 there weren\u2019t too many people who were paying attention to what they were doing.Yue Zhishi snuggled his face into his chest, his arms wrapping around his waist underneath the coat. His arms didn\u2019t stay around him for long, and they soon released him.\u201cAm I considered nineteen years old now?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s mouth revealed a hint of laughter. \u201cSure.\u201dHe lifted a hand, ruffling the hair on Yue Zhishi\u2019s forehead. His eyes were a bit unfocused. \u201cEven now, I still remember how you looked when you were nine years old.\u201d\u201cOnly when I was nine?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked, tilting his head.\u201cI remember how you looked when you were three, when you were four, when you were five\u2026\u201d Song Yu thought for a moment. \u201cI think I remember how you looked every year.\u201dYue Zhishi thought, perhaps in Song Yu\u2019s eyes, he forever remained a child.\u201cSong Yu.\u201d Yue Zhishi once again called his name, shifting closer slightly. He opened his mouth amid the noise of voices and movie dialogue \u2014 his voice was very soft, as though he was making a wish.\u201cWhen we were brothers, you were my older brother and I was your little brother. We weren\u2019t equals. I needed you to take care of me, while you didn\u2019t need anything.\u201dSong Yu silently listened, looking at his eyes.\u201cBut we\u2019re not like that anymore. I\u2019m your boyfriend, and you are mine. We are now very much equals.\u201d\u201cI need you. Can you need me too?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked very innocent as he gazed at him with his face upturned. When Song Yu didn\u2019t reply, he once again reached out a hand and held onto Song Yu\u2019s sleeve.\u201cMn.\u201d Song Yu nodded.The leads in the movie kissed, and waves of whistles and cheers sounded in the outdoor sports ground. Everyone watching the movie was at the height of their youth, and they were all either bashful or excited at the sight.Hearing the noise, Yue Zhishi turned his head over to look before he turned back around. His ears slightly reddened.Song Yu used to hate places with crowds of people, and he also used to hate it when other people followed along and made an uproar. But now, he unexpectedly felt a scene like this was very glorious; his sole regret was that he was unable to kiss Yue Zhishi here.\u201cYou have to do what you promised me. You can\u2019t just say you\u2019ll do it.\u201d Yue Zhishi was very close to him. As the people around them continued to make a commotion, he rose on his tiptoes and said to Song Yu, \u201cAnything you need me to do for you, I\u2019ll do.\u201dSong Yu nodded. He knew Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t someone who would say things he didn\u2019t mean, so he couldn\u2019t help but tease, \u201cAnything?\u201dYue Zhishi quickly nodded without even thinking, but he still added off one condition in the extremely low limits he held towards Song Yu. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s not illegal.\u201dSong Yu was amused. \u201cYou sure do live up to your studies.\u201d\u201cDo you remember the sticker sheets I gave you when we were kids? You only used one.\u201d Yue Zhishi clutched his arm.Song Yu asked in return, \u201cI\u2019ve used them before?\u201d\u201cYes! I was in your room asking you to play video games with me during the summer of your sixth year of elementary school.\u201d Yue Zhishi replied very rapidly, but he didn\u2019t look too happy when he next said, \u201cYou used one sheet in order to get me to be quiet for half an hour.\u201dBut Song Yu at that time hadn\u2019t even brought out them for Yue Zhishi to double check. After he said he\u2019d use them, Yue Zhishi had gloomily left his room, silently believing he\u2019d used one.He honestly was capable of doing something like that. Song Yu thought about it for a little while, the memory floating into his mind.He looked at Yue Zhishi\u2019s face again, and seeing him with his head lowered in dejection, he stroked the top of his hair. \u201cSo you remember things like that.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t just remember the good things about you.\u201d With his head lowered, Yue Zhishi used a voice only he himself could hear and muttered, \u201cOr else I would be even more hopeless.\u201dSong Yu stood for a bit, and then he said the later half of the movie wasn\u2019t interesting to watch. He pulled Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm, taking him away from the huge crowds.They instinctively walked forward, the unlit campus littered with all different kinds of undisturbed, secret places like a dash cam filled with easter egg videos. They opened one of them at random, sneaking inside, and shared a lingering kiss that belonged only to those in love. And then, under their identities as brothers, they exited and reentered the light of day.One kiss was far from enough, but Yue Zhishi had no way of asking for more.Yue Zhishi sunk into a slight sense of loss as he restrained his desire to ask for more. But he convinced himself \u2014 this was something he must learn to do in his journey towards growing up.As they walked, he asked if Song Yu\u2019s advisor had done something to make Song Yu unhappy, but since Song Yu glossed over an answer, Yue Zhishi stopped asking.\u201cThe cheesecake was really delicious. We should buy another slice again next time.\u201dSong Yu said, sure.It was 8:30pm, and Song Yu dropped him off at his dorm. Even though he was very reluctant to leave, Yue Zhishi thought about how Song Yu hadn\u2019t had time to eat lunch; he didn\u2019t have the heart to wilfully request for him to spend more time with him.He stood in front of his building and waved to Song Yu, a smile hanging on his face. When he entered the dorm building, he stood once again at a window on the stairs and wistfully searched for Song Yu\u2019s receding figure.Jiang Yufan was scrolling through a restaurant review app as he entered his dorm room, and he discussed with Yue Zhishi which restaurant they should try tomorrow. Yue Zhishi also received many, many messages from Lin Rong, Shen Mi and other senior brothers and sisters. He replied to each and all of them, but the only thing he could think about was the look on Song Yu\u2019s face as he said, standing on the sports ground, there will be a lot of people tomorrow.He didn\u2019t know if something had happened to Song Yu before he\u2019d come and looked for him. Even though Song Yu was very good at masking his emotions, Yue Zhishi was extremely sensitive in his perception of them.But Song Yu had come to see him when he wasn\u2019t happy, had come to talk to him and then had requested to celebrate Yue Zhishi\u2019s birthday early with just the two of them \u2014 Yue Zhishi felt like he\u2019d improved already.And yet, Yue Zhishi still felt like the degree to which he needed Song Yu was far, far more than the requests Song Yu had asked from him. His possessiveness and the level of intimacy he needed were at levels even he himself found unbearable.Qin Yan\u2019s message was very long, and he said he was going to bring his girlfriend along tomorrow to celebrate Yue Zhishi\u2019s birthday and also said he\u2019d already booked a karaoke room. Yue Zhishi said he didn\u2019t need to spend that kind of money, but he didn\u2019t receive a reply instantly.As he waited, Yue Zhishi tapped Qin Yan\u2019s profile and saw a Moments update that was uploaded not too long ago. He\u2019d uploaded two photos: one of the Plum Garden sports ground and one of his and his girlfriend\u2019s hands as they interlocked together.So it was him.Yue Zhishi stared at that photo for a long time, his heart slightly envious. He sometimes really wanted to show off his partner to every one around him, and yet he had no choice but to endure.Enduring was the thing he was most unable to do. When he was a child, he\u2019d been unable to endure the pain as he fell sick from his allergies and had uncontrollably cried; he\u2019d also been unable to endure his happiness and pleasure and had wanted to pour out all those feelings completely. And especially how he liked Song Yu \u2014 he hadn\u2019t been able to hide it for even one moment, wanting to tell him about his entire heart.But after being together with Song Yu, Yue Zhishi started to learn what it was to endure. It was so that this relationship that went against the rules could last for just a little longer.Because he truly liked him very, very much \u2014 and thus Yue Zhishi, who had been successful at anything he did, started to learn what it was to be a coward.It was 11pm, and he finished showering, pulling on a woolly beige-coloured outer coat meant to be worn at home.The dorm mate across from him was on the phone with his girlfriend, Jiang Yufan was playing games with his girlfriend and the other remaining dorm mate said he was peckish and wanted to go downstairs to get a cup of instant noodles from the vending machine.Yue Zhishi went down with him.\u201cBoth of them are always showing off their relationships in the dorm.\u201d His dorm mate elbowed Yue Zhishi. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you dating? So many girls are chasing after you.\u201d\u201cI have someone I like,\u201d Yue Zhishi truthfully said.\u201cAh?\u201d It was if his dorm mate was a bit flattered at how Yue Zhishi suddenly opened himself to him. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be able to have a secret crush as well.\u201dEven though he\u2019d been misunderstood, Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t correct him.His dorm mate stood in front of the vending machine, speaking as he decided which one to get. \u201cThe person you like must definitely have great looks. They\u2019re probably also quite a good person.\u201dYue Zhishi dipped his head. \u201cVery gentle.\u201dIt was unlikely anyone other than Yue Zhishi would agree to that description of Song Yu. Only Yue Zhishi knew: Song Yu, who always looked so unfeeling and cold, carried the gentlest and greatest heart in the world.\u201cGentle people are always really easy to persuade.\u201d His dorm mate seemed to be egging him on. \u201cYou can give it a try, she might think you\u2019re a really good, handsome person. She\u2019ll have no way of rejecting you so she might just agree to dating you. Wouldn\u2019t that make everyone happy?\u201dHe chose the noodle he wanted, paid and then gave Yue Zhishi another piece of encouragement. \u201cI hear your chances of succeeding double if you confess on your birthday.\u201dAfter a burst of sound, his dorm mate took out the noodles lying on the bottom of the machine.But because of his words, Yue Zhishi fell into confusion.\u201cAre there really people who would agree to dating just because they can\u2019t think of a reason to reject someone?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked.\u201cYup.\u201d His dorm mate said, \u201cI confessed many times to a girl I liked in high school, and she ended up agreeing to be with me. But I could sense that she didn\u2019t actually really like me all that much, so we broke up after graduating. She was a very gentle person who didn\u2019t like rejecting people, and she felt like she could give us a try.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Slightly demoralised, Yue Zhishi said, \u201cBut that\u2019s true, especially if someone ended up crying when they were confessing. It\u2019ll be even more troublesome.\u201dHis dorm mate said in amusement, \u201cIsn\u2019t that something only girls would do?\u201dHe shook the cup of noodles in his hand and leaned onto the vending machine. He asked Yue Zhishi, \u201cLe Le, do you want something to eat? This pudding\u2019s pretty nice. My treat.\u201dYue Zhishi said no need. He didn\u2019t want to eat; his mind was looking for all the pieces of evidence that could prove Song Yu really liked him \u2014 he felt like there were much too many. He shouldn\u2019t be so insecure, worried about how much of Song Yu he actually had.He was torn for two seconds, but then Yue Zhishi still ended up asking his dorm mate to buy him a pudding, with the money transferred to him later. His dorm mate kept waving his hand in refusal, and the words that came out of him were actually somewhat romantic. \u201cJust think of it as a final little gift from me to your eighteen years of life.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Once he took the pudding, Yue Zhishi sluggishly followed behind him. He walked a few steps, and then turned back.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d His dorm mate watched as Yue Zhishi headed towards the main doors of the dorm building. He called out, \u201cThe doors are about to get locked!\u201d\u201cI know. I\u2019m not coming back tonight.\u201d Yue Zhishi held onto that carton of pudding and ran out without even looking back.He didn\u2019t have his phone, and without a GPS, he ran around in the pitch black campus for a very long time. He ended up relying on his intuition, born from so many days of walking back and forth on these roads with Song Yu, and arrived at the part of campus where Song Yu lived.He stood in front of Song Yu\u2019s dormitory building, panting for air. After struggling to calm his breathing, Yue Zhishi pulled up his courage and went to the window where the dormitory auntie was. The auntie saw him in his outfit of sleeping clothes, and since he was a wholly unfamiliar face, she asked him why he was here and which building he belonged to.Yue Zhishi answered all of her questions, still short of air. He didn\u2019t look too normal, and so the auntie was very suspicious.\u201cI\u2019m here to look for Song Yu. He lives in room 418.\u201d\u201cWhy are you looking for him? It\u2019s so late. You guys aren\u2019t from the same school, so you can\u2019t just casually come in and visit.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi thought about saying he was his little brother, but he wasn\u2019t willing to say it \u2014 and so he stood in front of that tiny window, frozen.Someone walked behind him, and that person headed slightly closer to him. It was a very delicate looking guy, and he wore a pair of black-framed glasses. He glanced at Yue Zhishi a few times before he decided to come up; he lightly patted his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re Yue Zhishi, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know this face. Yue Zhishi asked in surprise, \u201cDo you know me?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d The guy smiled. \u201cIs there something urgent you need Song Yu for?\u201dYue Zhishi thought \u2014 giving a cheap pudding wouldn\u2019t be considered as anything urgent, and he would be ashamed to even say it out loud. He fell silent.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Did you not bring your phone?\u201d That guy gazed at Yue Zhishi and went around him, greeting the auntie inside the window. \u201cAuntie, this is Song Yu\u2019s brother. Can I take him up to look for his older brother?\u201dSuspicion covered her face, but this guy seemed to get along well with the auntie; he coaxed her into laughing with just a few sentences, and so she relaxed with Yue Zhishi.\u201cYou should\u2019ve said you were his brother earlier. Why didn\u2019t you say so when I asked?\u201dYue Zhishi was still unwilling to speak.\u201cYou need to come out in a bit, you can\u2019t stay over.\u201d\u201cWe know, auntie. Good night.\u201d The guy brought Yue Zhishi to the stairs before introducing himself. \u201cI\u2019m Song Yu\u2019s dorm mate. I\u2019m Chen Fangyuan.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, senior.\u201d Yue Zhishi hurriedly greeted him, but he was still a bit curious. \u201cSenior, how did you know who I was? Have you seen me before?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen you and Song Yu eating together at the cafeteria a good few times already. The gossip about Song Yu almost getting into a fight with someone from the law school because of you has spread around our year several times.\u201dChen Fangyuan grinned. \u201cBut what a wonder \u2014 Song Yu\u2019s such an icy guy, and yet he\u2019s a damned younger brother-con.\u201d He then rushed to explain, \u201cI\u2019m just teasing, don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head. He followed Chen Fangyuan to the door of their dorm room, and then he hesitated. \u201cCan I go in?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Chen Fangyuan pushed open the door and then realised there was no one inside. \u201cEh? Your brother\u2019s not back yet. He must still be in the research lab. Why don\u2019t you sit at his desk and wait a bit.\u201dThis place was still the dorm Yue Zhishi was familiar with \u2014 it felt like he\u2019d hidden here from the rain just yesterday. He gazed at the bed he\u2019d slept together in with Song Yu; it still looked exactly the same.Chen Fangyuan headed to the desk across from Song Yu\u2019s bed, taking off his jacket and pulling out his phone. \u201cLet me give your brother a call. Have a seat, the cleanest looking one is his.\u201dYue Zhishi very obediently went over. Song Yu\u2019s desk wasn\u2019t too different from before, with all the furnishings pretty much the same. Except there was now an item in a corner, covered by a black velvet cloth, and he couldn\u2019t tell what it was.Song Yu didn\u2019t pick up the phone, so Chen Fangyuan turned back around and saw Yue Zhishi touching the black cloth cover on Song Yu\u2019s desk. He immediately called out, \u201cHey, hey, little brother \u2014 don\u2019t touch that. He might come back and yell at you.\u201dYue Zhishi pivoted his face over to him in doubt, and yet he didn\u2019t take back his hand. He looked at how nervous Chen Fangyuan was, but the first thing that came out of his mouth was, \u201cHe won\u2019t yell at me.\u201dWith a face full of\u00a0this little ancestor has no idea what\u2019s coming, Chen Fangyuan rapidly sent a text and then headed over to where Yue Zhishi was sitting. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily true. Your brother fucking babies this thing and doesn\u2019t let anyone touch it. At first he was worried about dust and water, so he put a glass cover over it. And then when dust kept piling up on the glass, he found the velvet cloth to put over it. Eighty percent chance my future sister-in-law gave it to him.\u201dHe then added, \u201cIf they do end up getting together.\u201dHearing Chen Fangyuan speak so hotly and emotionally about this decoration, a bit of jealousy grew in Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart. He had never seen Song Yu treasure something so much.He reached out a hand again. \u201cI want to see.\u201dChen Fangyuan silently wondered about how this child just refused to listen. \u201cFine, but just be careful. Or else I\u2019d be worried about your brother coming back and saying something to you.\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, a bit of pique in his voice as he took off that cloth covering.The next second \u2014 he froze where he was.The globe he\u2019d given to Song Yu after labouring for so many summer nights rested under the glass cover.Yue Zhishi had almost forgotten this thing existed. He\u2019d thought Song Yu wouldn\u2019t like it at all, had thought it\u2019d long been thrown into some random corner \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t move, would stay still as it faded away and collected dust. It would have been abandoned.He knew there was a lag in the knowledge transmitted between him and Song Yu. Song Yu\u2019s feelings were like well-buried clues, puzzle pieces hidden deeply away.It had been so hard for Yue Zhishi to find a small piece of the puzzle; and now, the puzzle of feelings Song Yu held for him in his heart could be slightly restored to its original appearance.But it was never complete \u2014 which is why he would question it.With twenty minutes still remaining until he turned nineteen, Yue Zhishi gained an extremely important clue.And with this, he became intensely greedy. The puzzle pieces that came out one by one made him lose all patience; the sole thought of wanting a complete Song Yu pressed into him, so urgent he couldn\u2019t stand it.Chen Fangyuan\u2019s phone vibrated, and he immediately answered it.\u201cHey. Yeah, it\u2019s cold downstairs so I told him to come up, I thought you were at the dorm\u2026 your brother didn\u2019t bring his phone\u2026\u201d Chen Fangyuan looked Yue Zhishi up and down as he continued speaking. \u201c\u2026it doesn\u2019t look like anything happened to him. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s sick either. Ah, sure\u2026\u201dThe door to the room opened, and Yue Zhishi and Chen Fangyuan looked over at the same time. It was Song Yu in a rare panic.\u201cWhy\u2019d you call if you were already on your way up. What a waste of money.\u201d Chen Fangyuan hung up the call.Steadying his breathing, Song Yu walked in, his eyes containing only Yue Zhishi. He didn\u2019t even notice the globe on his desk.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He quietly asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were coming over?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know what he should say. Should he say he really missed him, that he changed his mind and wanted to stay by his side in the last few remaining minutes in order to spend the first moments of his birthday together? Or should he use the shoddy reason he\u2019d hastily thought up, and say he heard a certain pudding was quite tasty \u2014 and had ran over half the campus in the middle of the night to bring to him to eat.Or should he admit to the insecurities that had come without cause and needed to be soothed.It seemed like Song Yu understood something, and he pulled Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrist and headed outside.\u201cHey,\u201d Chen Fangyuan called out to him from the back. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He ran to the door. \u201cDon\u2019t get angry at your brother.\u201dSong Yu only said, \u201cI\u2019m not coming back tonight, no need to wait up.\u201dYue Zhishi was taken downstairs. The auntie had already finished her shift at the entrance, and they left the dorm with no other place to go.Seeing the cotton slippers on Yue Zhishi\u2019s feet, Song Yu could only tug him to the grove a few hundred metres behind the dormitory building. There was an empty, open air car park with very little people, and Song Yu was used to leaving his car there.Song Yu turned up the aircon after getting in the car, and then he asked Yue Zhishi what happened.Yue Zhishi continued to not speak, only gazing at Song Yu. His nose started to burn, but he couldn\u2019t tell if it was from the guilt he felt at misunderstanding him, or if it was from the heart that\u2019d been touched after seeing the globe.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Le Le.\u201d Song Yu called him by his nickname, and touched his face that\u2019d been chilled by the wind. All of a sudden, Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t hold back anymore \u2014 he embraced Song Yu from his passenger seat, burying his face into the side of his neck.\u201cI want to spend my birthday with you.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s body visibly relaxed a bit at this, and he hugged Yue Zhishi back. \u201cYou could\u2019ve told me.\u201d\u201cI was worried after hearing you ran over.\u201d He stroked Yue Zhishi\u2019s back.\u201cThis was very unplanned, I wasn\u2019t thinking of coming out initially,\u201d Yue Zhishi explained. He then thought about what his dorm mate had said, and without thinking about it, he poured it all out for Song Yu to hear.\u201cHe said his ex-girlfriend was also a really good person and agreed to be with him because she couldn\u2019t reject his confessions. And then I thought about you, thought about how particularly sorry I\u2019d looked when I confessed. I was sick too, so you definitely had no way to reject me. But\u2026\u201dHe squirmed on Song Yu\u2019s shoulder, his nose somewhat blocked. \u201cBut I really do like you, a lot. I didn\u2019t want to leave after kissing you. You said you wanted to celebrate my birthday early with just the two of us \u2014 but in reality, I wanted to give my entire birthday only to you.\u201dHe was slightly agitated, and there was no method or logic to his speech. Song Yu tried sifting through his words and found an important point Yue Zhishi no longer considered important.\u201cDo you think I don\u2019t really like you?\u201dYue Zhishi rose from his body, shaking his head. \u201cNo, I just\u2026 Sometimes I don\u2019t know how much you like me. I just feel like you definitely don\u2019t like me as much as I like you. I want you to rely on me a bit more\u2026 I don\u2019t know why I think like this either. But I saw the globe just then.\u201dThe look in Song Yu\u2019s eyes changed, and after a few seconds, he asked, \u201cDid that help you believe I actually really do like you?\u201dYue Zhishi met his eyes and nodded. \u201cYes. I understand now.\u201dSong Yu let out a light laugh, and yet there wasn\u2019t much amusement in his eyes.\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand.\u201dThe false birthday cake and candles had only provided happiness in advance \u2014 there was still the final minute remaining before nineteen.\u201cI only used the word\u00a0like\u00a0in order to adapt to you,\u201d Song Yu said.\u201cBecause the word sounds relatively harmless. It doesn\u2019t sound all that intense, and the word itself doesn\u2019t carry much possessiveness. But I\u2019m actually very unreasonably anxious. Do you know why I don\u2019t remember using the stickers you gave me?\u201dYue Zhishi watched him. \u201cWhy?\u201dIn the dark, the second hand on the watch ticked, second by second, like the sound of a countdown.\u201cBecause I\u2019ve kept all of them. I still have every single sheet. I remember very well that there are ten sheets \u2014 I count through them every year when I\u2019m cleaning.\u201d Song Yu was clearly smiling, yet his face was very pale.\u201cDo you think that\u2019s something a normal older brother would do?\u201d\u201cThe watch you gave me; the four leaf clover you gave me that\u2019s so withered it would disintegrate if it\u2019s touched; the old calendars you\u2019ve used\u2026 I still have all of them, hidden away. It\u2019s the same with the globe.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you ask me before about when I started to like you? To be honest, I really can\u2019t find a specific moment. Maybe when I was thirteen, or maybe when I was six. I can\u2019t tell.\u201dThree\u2014\u201cI only know that I\u2019ve lost countless nights of sleep because of you.\u201dTwo\u2014\u201cIf I did sleep, I would have many dreams about you, dreams I shouldn\u2019t be having.\u201dOne.Song Yu gazed at his eyes, his voice slightly hoarse. \u201cI don\u2019t like you. Yue Zhishi, I love you.\u201dYue Zhishi, at nineteen years old, finally received the birthday present he needed: a fully and utterly exposed Song Yu, who gave to him the whole of himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After getting together with Song Yu, every day seemed like a dream; sometimes even he himself was so dazed that he thought the person in front of him would disappear as soon as he blinked.He\u2019d carefully, tentatively tried to be a considerate partner. He gave Song Yu space, restraining the possessiveness he held towards him \u2014 he thought Song Yu would like him a little bit more, would need him more. He thought, by doing so, Song Yu would no longer take him as a little brother who didn\u2019t understand anything.But he\u2019d been mistaken from the very start.It was Song Yu who had been truly struggling. He\u2019d started struggling much earlier than him and had struggled much more painfully than him.He\u2019d thought he\u2019d feel as sweet and warm as all those romance movies at hearing the person he liked say\u00a0I love you\u00a0\u2014 but at this moment, Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart was filled with grief and sorrow. Those feelings weren\u2019t for himself.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi reached out, gently covering the back of Song Yu\u2019s hand. He clutched those long, slender fingertips.Song Yu flipped his own hand over to hold his. \u201cWhy are you saying sorry?\u201dHis fingertips were very cold; Song Yu massaged his fingers.\u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201dYue Zhishi drew his eyebrows together. Finally, he couldn\u2019t hold back \u2014 he embraced him, throwing his arms around his neck, and pressed his face into the hollow of his shoulder. \u201cI was too slow. If I\u2019d understood I liked you much earlier, you wouldn\u2019t have had to endure so much by yourself.\u201dSong Yu had been so impassive. Even when he was laying himself bare, he\u2019d been incomparably calm, as though he hadn\u2019t suffered at all. But all the years of pain \u2014 Yue Zhishi could feel them in their entirety and even further.Perhaps Song Yu\u2019s heart truly had been given to him. It lived in his body, and it was why Yue Zhishi was so heartbroken at a time like this.\u201cWhy are you crying.\u201d Song Yu could sense Yue Zhishi was crying, and he stroked his back. \u201cDon\u2019t be upset. It\u2019s bad for your body.\u201dAt this, Yue Zhishi was even more distressed.\u201cBut you\u2019ve been in pain for so long.\u201dIf it had been him who\u2019d realised he liked the older brother who lived under the same roof as him like true blood-related brothers, knowing something like that wasn\u2019t right. The other person might consider him only as a family member, but feelings were uncontrollable; without a single person to confide to, he could only protect the small pieces and things he\u2019d received from the other person, losing sleep night after night.If it had been him, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to continue on at all.But Song Yu seemed to care only about why Yue Zhishi came to look for him and why he was feeling such a sense of loss. \u201cDid I give you the wrong idea when I said we could give it a try?\u201dThe coral fleece home clothes on Yue Zhishi\u2019s body was very soft and plush. It was fluffy, and as Song Yu hugged him, even his voice gentled.\u201cI wanted to let you give us a try and take this time with me as a trial period. You would be the one to decide how long it lasted.\u201dHis face slightly itching because of Song Yu\u2019s cashmere coat, Yue Zhishi rubbed his face against the side of Song Yu\u2019s neck. He lingered against Song Yu\u2019s warm skin and asked, voice muffled, \u201cThen what about you?\u201dSong Yu stayed silent for a while, and then he said, softly, \u201cIt\u2019s already more than enough for me to have this period of time.\u201dCurving his head onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s, he said, \u201cI never thought I would have a day like this.\u201dThey were like two plants tangled together. The past Yue Zhishi had blindly accepted the nutrients Song Yu transferred to him, ignorant of everything. He grew up without a single worry, but now \u2014 he finally understood where all those nutrients had come from and recognised the accumulated years of suffering living within Song Yu\u2019s body.Love was truly too strange.Song Yu safeguarded so well a worthless, imprecise globe, and yet he, in describing himself as unreasonably anxious, hadn\u2019t dared to keep the maker of that globe.Yue Zhishi wanted to say something to Song Yu very badly, so that he would believe he was the same. But his brain became more chaotic the more anxious he was, and all the things he could think of saying were disjointed and illogical.In the end, Song Yu looked at his watch and said it was already very late.\u201cI even made you cry on your birthday,\u201d he grumbled at himself before giving Yue Zhishi a kiss. \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201dHe didn\u2019t use the words\u00a0let\u2019s go home.\u00a0Both of them were very clear \u2014 it would be very hard to return back home.The inside of the car was impossibly quiet on the drive, and once Yue Zhishi got out of the car in the underground car park, Song Yu pulled up the hood on his jacket for him and took him upstairs.The door opened, darkness deep and heavy within the room. Song Yu turned on the lights and the air-conditioning, but the temperature warmed much slower than he imagined. Yue Zhishi slipped off his dirtied cotton slippers, changing into the slippers in the apartment, and went to sit on the sofa by himself, still frowning.Song Yu walked over to him, holding a pair of thick and downy cotton socks he grabbed from somewhere. Kneeling down on one knee, he didn\u2019t say a single word and reached out to catch Yue Zhishi\u2019s ankles.Yue Zhishi pulled away, but Song Yu held onto him and tugged an ankle forward. His broad palm enveloped Yue Zhishi\u2019s almost frozen heel, and after chafing it for a bit, he pulled a sock over it.Neither of them had spoken in the last two minutes. Song Yu helped him put on the socks, stood back up and then he finally, casually opened his mouth.\u201cThe things I said \u2014 would they make you feel pity for me?\u201dHe didn\u2019t expect his question to accidentally stir up Yue Zhishi\u2019s emotions. Frowning, Yue Zhishi moved his legs away; his voice wasn\u2019t quite steady. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201dVery quickly, Yue Zhishi once again sunk into self-reflection. He suspected he really was an idiot who understood nothing about love: the first thing he\u2019d actually said after hearing Song Yu say he loved him was\u00a0I\u2019m sorry.He was in all honesty blaming himself for Song Yu\u2019s pain, but Song Yu \u2014 how would he interpret that single\u00a0I\u2019m sorry?His thoughts having reached this point, he did his best to calm himself down, to smoothen out his breathing.\u201cNot pity.\u201d Yue Zhishi raised his head, looking at Song Yu. He used the back of his hand to scrub his eyes; the rims of his eyes were very red, and even his eyelashes were damp. \u201cI said I was sorry because I was too upset. It wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t accept your feelings. They were what I wanted the most. You don\u2019t know how much I wanted to know if you liked me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t keep thinking that I can\u2019t tell the difference between familial affection and love. I might\u2019ve been sick when I confessed \u2014 I honestly wasn\u2019t clear-headed, so I definitely appeared really impulsive \u2014 but I struggled over those words for a very long time before I wanted to say them out loud. They existed since a long time ago, and I only said them because I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore.\u201dYue Zhishi frowned again before relaxing his eyebrows. He stretched out a hand, curling it around Song Yu\u2019s dropped hand, and gripped his fingers. \u201cYou said I would be the one to decide how long this lasted. You left me with space to step back, but have you ever thought about this.\u201d\u201cSong Yu.\u201d Yue Zhishi lowered his eyes, the gathered tears gently wobbling. \u201cIt was you who let me feel the love I had never been able to feel from other people. It was you who gave me the feelings I never received from anyone else. From our childhood to now \u2014 the last ten-plus years \u2014 my eyes have seen only you. I only wish to spend every minute, every second with you, and that has never changed. We\u2019ve already reached this point, and yet you still expect me to like someone else?\u201dLifting his eyes, he squeezed Song Yu\u2019s hand. No matter how stubborn he was, his reddened eyes couldn\u2019t hold onto that teardrop after all, and it tumbled down. \u201cFrom the time you accepted me to your side, I had no other option. It was you who made me unable to love anyone else \u2014 so how could you leave me with ways to retreat?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s voice had never been so resolute. \u201cI have no way out. I have only you.\u201dSong Yu fell into a prolonged period of silence, and then he went to sit next to him.Yue Zhishi\u2019s tears were rolling down drop by drop, and he subconsciously reached out a hand to wipe them away, again and again. He was like a robot, only able to execute simple commands.\u201cI don\u2019t want only a period of time. It\u2019s not enough.\u201dUnderneath the lights of the living room, Yue Zhishi was so pale the slightly swollen green and blue veins on his eyelids were clearly visible. He looked extremely fragile, as though he would shatter with just one touch. His eyelashes were long yet soft, and even the skin on his cheeks was very soft. He wore very comfortable coral fleece clothes. But the look on his face, his voice \u2014 they held the unyielding stubbornness that lived in his bones.\u201cI want all of you for a very, very long time.\u201dLifting a hand, Song Yu touched his cheek. Yue Zhishi caught it.\u201cYou said it\u2019s harmless to like someone. Maybe to you, my feelings are a simple\u00a0like; even I didn\u2019t define what they were. But I really struggled with them \u2014 the possessiveness I feel towards you has already gone beyond what I can handle. That\u2019s why I ran out in the middle of the night in my pyjamas to look for you. That\u2019s why I was filled with self doubt once I heard some insignificant stuff.\u201dHe pulled out from his pocket the pudding he\u2019d still yet to give away. \u201cI even found a ridiculously hasty excuse that I can never say out loud to other people just so I could see you earlier. At eighteen, you said I was still a child. But at nineteen\u2014\u201dThroughout the nights Song Yu had lost sleep because of these feelings, Yue Zhishi had continuously done all he could to smooth away the gaps and lags in their timelines, in the knowledge transmitted to each other \u2014 all of the staggered, unmatched differences he could think of.\u201c\u2014do I have the right to say I love you?\u201dSeeing how Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes reddened and eyelashes trembled at asking a question like that, the last string holding Song Yu back finally snapped.He didn\u2019t give an answer, only directly pressing Yue Zhishi onto the sofa and fitting their lips together. His glasses were wedged in between their faces, and there was a noise that sounded like metal breaking. After adjusting it a few times, Song Yu tore off the glasses and carelessly threw it onto the floor.The leather on the sofa was very cold. With Song Yu holding down his wrists, Yue Zhishi had no way to move \u2014 but Song Yu\u2019s breaths were hot, and so were his lips and tongue. The weight of the person he loved bore down on him, as though he\u2019d fallen into the lake; the familiar scent of Song Yu\u2019s body wrapped around him, and Yue Zhishi gradually lost control amongst the ferocity and suffocation he\u2019d never experienced before. He liked the Song Yu who was gentle, and he also liked the Song Yu who completely revealed himself without concealing or holding any of himself back.Song Yu kissed him very forcefully, entering him in a determined way. He no longer cautiously thought about Yue Zhishi\u2019s breathing; he plundered his way into a moist and velvety territory, as though he was trying to leave behind a mark \u2014 so that Yue Zhishi would always remember how much he wanted him.The feeling of suffocation made Yue Zhishi feel as though he was walking on a suspension bridge. He tightly clutched onto Song Yu\u2019s arms, eyes closed, as his breathing through his nose became all the more intense. The zipper on the outer layer of his pyjamas slipped downwards from the friction, and only the bottom pin box remained connected; a soft cotton short-sleeved shirt peeked out from within. He tried returning the kiss, awkwardly and stubbornly entwining with Song Yu, and yet he plunged into another whirlpool as he did so \u2014 sinking deeper and deeper, as his hunger for Song Yu became all the more consuming.Time slowed down, and just as he was on the verge of losing all of his air, Song Yu shifted away, breaking through the thread of desire. Yue Zhishi lay limply on the sofa, the corners of his mouth slightly wet. His lips were flushed from the fierce kiss.His head was pillowed on the sofa\u2019s armrest, and he pulled in large mouthfuls of air. His heart was racing, his whole body covered with sweat; his breaths were thin, and his chest rose and fell very rapidly. All of this felt almost exactly the same as though he was hyperventilating \u2014 except he was both frightened and ravenous.As Song Yu lightly, soothingly kissed the edge of his lips, Yue Zhishi moved in relying solely on his instincts. He intimately rubbed the tips of their noses together, panting as he pressed kisses against Song Yu\u2019s cheeks, Song Yu\u2019s lips. He called out either Song Yu\u2019s name or called him gege; the sound of his voice blended indistinctly into the wet, sucking noises and his sharp breathing. His voice came in fragments, again and again, tainted with lust as they moved against each other.He was like a puppy raised with indulgence, subconsciously equating Song Yu\u2019s intimate actions with darkness through training. In dark spaces with no one else around them, Song Yu would embrace him, kiss him \u2014 which is why he always stepped inside, filled with expectation, and was unwilling to leave.If it was possible, he wished Song Yu\u2019s kisses would never stop.Dazed, Song Yu saw a very small drop of blood well up from Yue Zhishi\u2019s slightly swollen lips. He calmed down, and he held Yue Zhishi\u2019s face, using the pad of a finger to delicately wipe it away. He said very gently, \u201cSorry,\u201d and backed away, giving him some space to breathe. \u201cDid I scare you.\u201dBut Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t accept his good intentions. Instead, he climbed onto Song Yu\u2019s body and twined his arms around his neck. Shaking his head, he said, \u201cNo,\u201d and pleaded, \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday today, you can\u2019t leave.\u201d His whole body eased onto Song Yu\u2019s, and he took the initiative to merge their lips together. He actively kissed without much skill, like a child begging for candy.Innocently asking for more, simply expressing his love and demanding passionate kisses despite clearly knowing it\u2019d be hard for him to breathe \u2014 that was Yue Zhishi. Other than Song Yu, there would be no one else who would be able to see him like this.Song Yu pushed his shoulders, moving him slightly away. His hand tenderly cupped his cheek as his thumb swiped back and forth against the corner of his mouth.\u201cWill you feel as though I\u2019m influencing you?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s jacket was already completely off; only the sleeves still remained on him. He grasped Song Yu\u2019s arms, fighting to steady his breathing. His red lips glistened with moisture, and even his face was red as he gazed at Song Yu with damp yet sincere eyes. Faintly opening his mouth, he sucked Song Yu\u2019s thumb in, and the tip of his tongue subtly brushed against it.\u201cIsn\u2019t it me who\u2019s seducing you?\u201dHis movements were tempting and alluring, and yet his eyes were clean and pure. It was as though they were hinting at Song Yu, telling him: you are innocent, and I am the one who is guilty. Just like Yue Zhishi had done countless times, they were telling him: you can do to me whatever you want to do.This actually increased Song Yu\u2019s guilt.But when guilt was mixed with the initial layer of desire, it became an almost incurable hallucinogen. It shot right into his veins, and his reason utterly disappeared. Still fully dressed, he peeled off Yue Zhishi\u2019s jacket and kissed down the line of his neck, leaving behind traces on his pale, bare skin.Yue Zhishi was covered by a layer of thin sweat, and the short-sleeved shirt stuck to his body. He quivered when Song Yu kissed his still covered nipples; he tilted backwards, clinging to Song Yu\u2019s head, and his waist, arched forward, was firmly squeezed. A kind of impatient eagerness circulated in his blood, and it seized hold of his entire body \u2014 he lost strength and wanted to slide backwards, but Song Yu clasped onto his lower back and pulled him back in until he toppled onto Song Yu\u2019s body.\u201cDoes it feel bad?\u201d Song Yu hadn\u2019t even finished speaking when Yue Zhishi started kissing him again.His hands shoved off Song Yu\u2019s outer coat in a hurry, revealing the black knit inside. He trailed kisses to the side of Song Yu\u2019s face and gasped next to his ear, \u201cHot\u2026\u201dSong Yu\u2019s hands slipped into his clothes and came into contact with his feverish skin. Cold fingertips somewhat relieved the heat in Yue Zhishi\u2019s body, but it made no real difference. Sitting on Song Yu\u2019s body, Yue Zhishi lightly rubbed back and forth; he took Song Yu\u2019s hand and led it downwards until fingertips went past the edge of his pyjama pants.\u201cHave you done it yourself before?\u201d Reaching in, Song Yu gripped onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s already erect cock.Yue Zhishi lay on his body, very quietly saying he had.\u201cWhen?\u201d\u201cAfter getting together with you. I really missed you.\u201d Yue Zhishi fidgeted against the side of Song Yu\u2019s neck, looking as though he was a bit shy and embarrassed. He stressed, \u201cOnly once.\u201dThinking he was cute, Song Yu couldn\u2019t help but tease, \u201cYou like me so much, and yet you\u2019ve only done it once?\u201dYue Zhishi was somewhat peeved, lifting his body up and wanting to say something, but Song Yu blocked his mouth and also tightly squeezed below. The slippery fluid oozing from the tip contaminated what Yue Zhishi had once considered the best-looking pair of hands; thumb and fingers circled around him, and the hand pushed and pulled, gliding up and down.When he touched himself, the only things he imagined were Song Yu\u2019s face and his kisses \u2014 Yue Zhishi very rarely imagined Song Yu doing other things, so even his sexual fantasies contained only kisses. He only understood how empty his fantasies were now that he obtained Song Yu in his entirety.He sporadically shared kisses with Song Yu, seeking air from time to time. He subconsciously rocked his hips with Song Yu\u2019s movements, and his butt, still bundled in his pants, ground against Song Yu\u2019s lower body. He could feel something nudging against himself, and that knowledge made him feel both ashamed and satisfied.\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 Gege\u2026\u201dWhenever he begged for mercy, Yue Zhishi\u2019s first impulse was still to call him gege. It was as though he was doing something he shouldn\u2019t be doing, and he shook as he pleaded for him to spare him, soft whimpers and moans interspersed among his pants.He squirmed in Song Yu\u2019s arms, and Song Yu could only endure. He tenderly kissed Yue Zhishi\u2019s cheek and said, \u201cBe good and relax. You\u2019ll feel much better after you come.\u201dOn the verge of losing control, Yue Zhishi received some comfort after asking for a kiss. Their teeth touched, tongues coiled together, and the low and hazy moan changed pitch in the middle of their kiss. Yue Zhishi shot onto Song Yu\u2019s lower belly, his cum dirtying Song Yu\u2019s clean black knit.Yue Zhishi hid in Song Yu\u2019s chest as he heavily breathed, his body completely weak. Lowering his head, he saw the mess; he used a hand to scrub it away, but it wouldn\u2019t disappear.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Yue Zhishi whispered. \u201cI dirtied your clothes.\u201dSong Yu felt his attention was always caught on strange things. He brushed his lips against Yue Zhishi\u2019s ear. \u201cYou can dirty it even more.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s face flushed, but he was a child who was eager to learn. That hand smeared with cum once again shifted downwards, undoing Song Yu\u2019s belt, and tentatively pulled down the border of his underwear. The astoundingly sized cock popped out and pressed against Yue Zhishi\u2019s skinny lower belly.\u201cSo big.\u201d Yue Zhishi looked at his cock, and the desire to compare rose in his heart. Song Yu\u2019s cock was somewhat darker than his, much longer and also curved upwards. But Yue Zhishi very swiftly found a good excuse for himself. \u201cYou\u2019re much taller than me to begin with anyway.\u201dSong Yu still wanted to kiss him, but Yue Zhishi clambered down his body and unexpectedly knelt onto the rug. Pulling open Song Yu\u2019s legs, he slid in. He raised his face, a smile that was the tiniest bit sly hanging on his face, and he declared to Song Yu, \u201cI want to do this. Can I?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to.\u201d Song Yu wanted to tug him back up.\u201cBut I want to try.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand was holding the bottom of his cock, and his lips skimmed against the tip; when his lips moved away, a strand of translucent fluid came away with them, sticking onto his lips.\u201cWhere\u2019d you learn this?\u201dYue Zhishi answered earnestly, \u201cI saw this on a pornographic ad. That time after graduating third year of junior high \u2014 the video I watched was actually a man with another man.\u201dHe opened his mouth and drew in Song Yu\u2019s cock. It was actually much harder than he\u2019d imagined: he essentially could only fit the top half into his mouth, but Song Yu\u2019s breathing had already changed.Yue Zhishi sucked the best he could, knowing very well he was inexperienced. He still wanted to please Song Yu, hoping he could get a bit of praise after, but it was truly too difficult. He originally hadn\u2019t been able to swallow the whole of it, and yet Yue Zhishi could feel Song Yu\u2019s cock swelling in his mouth.He pulled away slightly, took a few breaths and stretched out his tongue, licking up and down. There was no skill in his movements at all, possibly even very clumsy, but just the act alone messed up Song Yu\u2019s long controlled breathing. The person he\u2019d gone to such lengths to protect \u2014 the little brother he watched grow up \u2014 was at this very moment kneeling in front of him and pleasing him.Immoral desire was pleasure\u2019s most effective catalyst.When Yue Zhishi leaned forward again, Song Yu couldn\u2019t hold back his hands from clenching onto the back of Yue Zhishi\u2019s head. He could feel part of himself pressing down on the base of Yue Zhishi\u2019s tongue, and it was even deeper inside than when they kissed. He suddenly had a somewhat abnormal thought: he wanted to heavily thrust into that moist and soft mouth and then shoot inside; he wanted to see him choke and forcefully swallow everything down, coughing until his face turned red. And then he still needed to kiss him.But that could only remain as thoughts. Song Yu wouldn\u2019t risk Yue Zhishi and make him do something like that. He endured, pushing deeply into Yue Zhishi\u2019s throat before withdrawing back again slightly. His cock coupled slowly with the inside of Yue Zhishi\u2019s mouth and his lips, and he took Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand, teaching him how to wrap around his shaft and pleasure him.Yue Zhishi\u2019s mouth was very sore, and a lot of spit trickled down from his mouth. He still licked and sucked seriously, and after an unknown amount of time, Song Yu abruptly hauled himself out and rubbed the front of his cock against Yue Zhishi\u2019s lips. With rapid, short breaths, he came onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s face.Yue Zhishi helplessly closed his eyes as fluid splattered all over his face. He opened his eyes again, just marginally, and subconsciously wiped his face with the back of his hand. He looked at the cum on his hand with a bit of bemusement \u2014 and then he licked it.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Steadying his breathing, Song Yu pulled Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand away.\u201cI wanted to see what you taste like,\u201d Yue Zhishi very honestly replied. He even lowered his head and gave Song Yu\u2019s cock a kiss.\u201cWas it yummy?\u201d Song Yu leaned back against the sofa, so hot he pulled off his shirt with one hand. Stretching out a hand, he tugged Yue Zhishi onto his body.Yue Zhishi circled his arms around Song Yu\u2019s waist, and he shared a suggestive kiss with Song Yu, murmuring\u00a0yes it was\u00a0in reply, murmuring\u00a0I feel so good\u00a0and\u00a0I really like you.Song Yu\u2019s ears burned as he listened, and he pinched Yue Zhishi\u2019s lower waist, plugging up his mouth with his own. With Yue Zhishi straddling him, he lifted him up, carrying him into the bathroom. What they\u2019ve done was far from enough for Song Yu, but he wanted to properly treasure Yue Zhishi; he didn\u2019t want to continue further in a rush without a single shred of preparation and give him an unsatisfactory experience.They cleaned up swiftly, and Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want to leave the warmth of the bathroom. Song Yu couldn\u2019t get him to move, so he could only transport him horizontally into the bedroom and cover him well with the blanket. He cuddled him from the back, forcefully compelling him to sleep before 2:30.\u201cKiss for just one more minute.\u201d Yue Zhishi flipped over, pecking at Song Yu\u2019s face. \u201cPlease?\u201dSong Yu was wholly unsympathetic, his eyes still closed, so Yue Zhishi could only cutely whine, \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday today, and you still haven\u2019t even said happy birthday to me yet. And now you\u2019re\u2026\u201d\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d Song Yu said very briskly and then gave Yue Zhishi a quick smooch.\u201cThat was too half-hearted.\u201d Hooking his hands around Song Yu\u2019s neck, Yue Zhishi gave him a lingering kiss. \u201cI like kisses like this.\u201d But he didn\u2019t get his way at all \u2014 Song Yu speedily pushed him away.\u201cIf you still want to go to your birthday lunch tomorrow, you better sleep now.\u201d Song Yu stared at him, and his voice started to sound a bit threatening. \u201cI can make it so you can\u2019t get out of bed at all.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s heart frantically jumped, and his cheeks blushed. He muttered, \u201cUnderstood, sleeping now sleeping now.\u201dThe bedside lamp switched off, and the room sunk into a layer of soft darkness. After a few minutes of quiet, Yue Zhishi, hidden in Song Yu\u2019s arms, couldn\u2019t help but whisper, \u201cAre you asleep?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201dYue Zhishi shifted a bit higher. \u201cCan you say what you said to me in the car again.\u201d\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d His voice deep, Song Yu asked him on purpose. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t like you\u2019?\u201dYue Zhishi bit his neck. \u201cNot that. The sentence after.\u201dEven though he\u2019d been bitten, Song Yu seemed to be in a good mood. He stroked Yue Zhishi\u2019s back, and a calm and gentle amusement laced through his voice. He used a more peaceful way to tell him, \u201cI love you.\u201dYue Zhishi held onto him in contentment. He didn\u2019t want to say sorry this time. The first day of being nineteen, he too obtained the right to express his love to the person he loved. \u201cI love you too.\u201dFeeling as though it wasn\u2019t enough, he repeated it once again.\u201cI love you, Song Yu.\u201dThe author has something to say:They finally understand each other\u2019s heart~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 67: OvertonesYue Zhishi recovered a bit of consciousness from his heavy slumber when his alarm rang for the second time. Keeping his eyes closed, he stretched out an arm and aimlessly groped around for a long while before he finally found his phone; he poked at the screen multiple times before the alarm turned off.He wasn\u2019t fully conscious yet. He squinted, wanting to see what time it was, and numbly pressed on the power button on the side. It was 9:03am. He\u2019d initially prepared to go back to sleep, but abruptly, he realised the home screen was foreign to him \u2014 he only then realised it was Song Yu\u2019s phone.Their phones were the same model and the same colour, and even their cases were the same. Yue Zhishi had bought his phone copying Song Yu.Only his home screen was of an anime character he liked, while the phone in his hand showed a photo. It was the sun setting across the edges of Lingbo Gate, resplendent shards of gold scattered amongst the gleaming shimmers of the lake.He clearly was barely awake, and yet just that one photo scraped against the soft spot in Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart. It wasn\u2019t the lake he saw, nor the sunset \u2014 but rather Song Yu, as he sat on the bench by the side of the lake, alone.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t dare think about what kind of mood he had been in as he took the photo.Only one thin, pure white curtain was drawn in the room, and the autumn sunlight shone through, filling up the entire space. Yue Zhishi put down the phone and snuggled back under his blanket; Song Yu was lying on his side next to him. His sleeping face was very still, but it was somewhat gentler compared to how he usually looked. Yue Zhishi moved in until they were very close together, and he quietly focused on this face he\u2019d looked up at since he was a child.He\u2019d never thought Song Yu would like him. That option had long been eliminated from his mind through both the ethical rules and common values of being a little brother. But the strange thing was, Yue Zhishi also hadn\u2019t thought Song Yu would end up liking someone else. Born with a cold yet handsome face, he was self-disciplined, outstanding and reserved \u2014 it was expected for others to chase after him, but he would definitely never stop and wait for someone else.And yet that person had waited for him for so many years.Despite saying\u00a0just stay where you are and wait for me, he\u2019d hesitated and not dared to move forward, turning into the actual person who\u2019d stood still and waited.Yue Zhishi half rose, not wanting to wake him up. He very lightly leaned over and kissed Song Yu\u2019s lips; his original plan was to give a brief morning kiss, but because he was reluctant to leave, he stayed for a few more seconds and ended up losing control.He didn\u2019t know when Song Yu\u2019s arm had wrapped around his back. It held down his lower waist and immediately flipped him over, pressing him into the soft mattress as Song Yu deepened their kiss.Song Yu\u2019s other hand caught one of Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrists and pinned it next to his pillow. As Yue Zhishi closed his eyes, Song Yu slid his fingers through the gaps between Yue Zhishi\u2019s fingers, interlacing them together a bit forcefully.Yue Zhishi called out\u00a0gege\u00a0from time to time in the midst of their kiss. His voice was soft and breathy, and his free hand rested on Song Yu\u2019s back, fingers gripping his cotton pyjamas. He really enjoyed the feeling of Song Yu pressing him down with his entire bodyweight; he felt highly secure, so tightly surrounded by him that no one would be able to split them apart.Stopping while he still could, Song Yu retreated just as the kiss deepened to a certain point.Yue Zhishi was breathless. \u201cWhen did you wake up? I didn\u2019t even realise\u2026\u201dSong Yu gave the side of his neck an extremely soft kiss. His voice still slightly scratchy, he said, \u201cWhen the alarm rang.\u201d\u201cYou know how to fake sleep too well.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice carried a touch of complaint, like a child grumbling about being fooled. He pulled his neck away and pushed at Song Yu\u2019s chest. \u201cWere you waiting for me to steal a kiss from you? Do you feel particularly pleased with yourself?\u201dAfter propping himself up, Song Yu caught Yue Zhishi\u2019s face in between his thumb and forefinger, squeezing those cheeks until Yue Zhishi\u2019s lips poked out. He gave him a smooch, truthfully saying, \u201cI wasn\u2019t waiting. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d do something like that.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s heart once again melted into a puddle, and when Song Yu let go of him, he hugged Song Yu\u2019s arm, saying he wasn\u2019t allowed to think like that in the future and asking if he slept well last night.\u201cYes.\u201d Song Yu adjusted the slightly curly hair on Yue Zhishi\u2019s forehead. \u201cI fell asleep really quickly while holding you.\u201dOn his first day of being nineteen years old, Yue Zhishi was very satisfied at Song Yu having had a solid night of sleep. It was as though it was foreshadowing that both he and Song Yu would have great fortune in the upcoming year.But in his heart, he rapidly shoved away that thought. He reorganised his thoughts, and thought it was fine if he wasn\u2019t lucky \u2014 as long as all his luck was given to Song Yu.Yue Zhishi pretty much never lingered in bed unless he was with Song Yu. His habit of always being early was also learned from Song Yu, but whenever they slept together in the same bed, Yue Zhishi especially liked to laze about and idle away some time.Except he\u2019d promised to have lunch together with everyone \u2014 as the birthday boy, there was no way he could be late.After cleaning up, Yue Zhishi took off his shirt and suddenly remembered he\u2019d left his dorm in a fluffy pair of pyjamas. He couldn\u2019t wear it out in public, and so he stood at the side of the bed in a daze. Song Yu saw red spots dotted across his upper body, spreading from his neck to his belly. He\u2019d clearly already held back his strength, and yet he still left behind marks.He shifted his eyes away and pulled out a black button-down shirt and a pair of long pants, giving them to Yue Zhishi.Yue Zhishi had a narrow waist, and Song Yu guessed his pants wouldn\u2019t fit. He went downstairs to grab the belt they\u2019d undone and had chucked on the floor.The living room was more disordered than he\u2019d thought. Clothes were messily scattered everywhere, and his glasses were also left on the rug. If it had been a normal day, Song Yu would\u2019ve never been able to tolerate something like this at all.Picking up his glasses, he placed it on top of the cabinet and started to clean up their clothes. For some reason, he subconsciously cleared his throat when he saw the smears left on his black knit, and then he threw all of the clothes together into the washing machine.He went back upstairs with his belt, and he heard Yue Zhishi quietly humming as he arrived at the door of their room. His two hands were shaking out that large blanket, and he bent over, earnestly straightening out the bed. He was only wearing the black shirt Song Yu gave him earlier, his pair of slender, straight and long legs openly exposed. He was barefoot.Song Yu knocked on the door, and only then did Yue Zhishi sharply turn his head around, immediately breaking into a smile when he saw him.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing pants?\u201d Song Yu pulled his eyes away from his legs and focused on Yue Zhishi\u2019s face.\u201cI was waiting for your belt, or else they\u2019d just fall down.\u201d Finishing with the bed, Yue Zhishi swept out a hand towards him, as though he was a little child in kindergarten waiting for his teacher to praise him for folding his blanket after his afternoon nap. \u201cLook.\u201dSong Yu threw the belt onto the bed, strictly ordering him to put on his clothes. He paused for a moment, and then he asked, \u201cDo you dress like this in your dorm too?\u201dYue Zhishi was sitting on the bed, pulling on his pants. \u201cHow could I? The dorm\u2019s so cold.\u201dWas that the point?Somewhat helplessly, Song Yu went towards his closet and found a cream-coloured woollen sweater Yue Zhishi could wear. He repeated, \u201cYou can\u2019t dress like that outside.\u201d\u201cI knowww,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, dragging out the last syllable. He fastened the belt and promised, \u201cI definitely won\u2019t catch a cold or a fever again.\u201dAs he listened to Yue Zhishi\u2019s entirely oblivious words, Song Yu started to wonder if the person in front of him was the same Yue Zhishi who\u2019d lured him into doing wrong things last night.\u201cBut my throat\u2019s a bit sore this morning. I keep wanting to cough.\u201d Yue Zhishi leaned his head over, rubbing his Adam\u2019s apple. He softly mumbled, \u201cDon\u2019t know why.\u201dSong Yu cleared his throat self-consciously as he remembered something completely unsuitable for the current moment.\u201cDrink more water,\u201d he said, his words completely useless.\u201cThese gold cuff buttons are so pretty.\u201d Yue Zhishi raised his hands and looked at his cuffs. He lowered them, looking at himself in the mirror, and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been so busy since school started. It\u2019s been a long time since I cut my hair \u2014 it\u2019s so long now.\u201dSong Yu gazed at Yue Zhishi\u2019s reflection in the mirror. The wavy brown hair on his forehead was long enough to cover his cheekbones, and he\u2019d pushed half of it behind his right ear. The hair at his neck had also grown out, partly hiding the mole on his nape. With his head half-lowered, Yue Zhishi was buttoning up that loose, comfortable sweater on his body with his pale and slender fingers. His eyelashes cast shadows under his eyes, and the shirt collar was half-open, revealing a faint red mark on his collarbone.Compared to how youthful and spirited he used to look, Yue Zhishi, now wearing Song Yu\u2019s clothes, seemed to have an extra air around him \u2014 it was subtle and languid, created from the aftermath of satisfying desire.He walked over and secured the buttons on Yue Zhishi\u2019s black shirt all the way up to the very top.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to breathe like this.\u201d Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want to cooperate.\u201cYou might start coughing if your throat gets cold,\u201d Song Yu said, having found a more reasonable excuse for his desire to monopolise Yue Zhishi.They were meant to all meet up at 12pm, with Jiang Yufan having booked the restaurant. Serving Hunan-style food, it was a restaurant Yue Zhishi very much enjoyed, and Jiang Yufan had sent Song Yu a message earlier in the morning, even saying Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t returned to their dorm all night.Song Yu replied saying he knew, and drove over with Yue Zhishi.When they arrived below the restaurant, Yue Zhishi detached his seatbelt and was about to hurry out \u2014 but Song Yu didn\u2019t undo the locks in the door. \u201cWait a minute.\u201dHe opened a storage container next to his hands and pulled out a very exquisite, midnight blue gift box covered in velvet. He offered it to Yue Zhishi.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Yue Zhishi took it, eyes gazing at Song Yu.\u201cBirthday present,\u201d Song Yu simply replied.Opening it, Yue Zhishi saw an elegant mechanical watch. It was covered with sapphire glass, and radial waves unfurled across the watch face like water on a lake, a faint, cool blue sheen reflecting under the the sunlight. The indices, hour and minute hands were a silvery white, and the long and slim second hand was a beautiful sea blue.\u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes were glowing. He held up the watch, flipping it over, and realised he knew this brand. He tugged over Song Yu\u2019s hand. \u201cIs this the same brand as the watch I bought for you?\u201dBut the watch Song Yu gave him was clearly much more expensive.\u201cMn.\u201d Taking the watch, Song Yu helped Yue Zhishi put it on; the size of the watch face he\u2019d chosen was just right for Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrist. He looked over it and nodded, as though he was satisfied with the result of what he\u2019d spent many days choosing. \u201cIt really suits you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m now a guy who owns a watch too!\u201d Yue Zhishi held his wrist a bit further away and then looked towards Song Yu. \u201cWas this really expensive?\u201d\u201cIt was okay.\u201d Song Yu asked him if he liked it, and Yue Zhishi excitedly nodded, saying, \u201cOf course.\u201d In reality, even if Song Yu had given him a printed birthday card, he still would\u2019ve happily displayed it on his desk to look at every day.\u201cThis definitely costs more than the one I gave you.\u201d Yue Zhishi pursed his lips. \u201cWait until I start earning some money and then I\u2019ll buy you a better one, okay?\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201dAs though he was afraid Song Yu thought he wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it, Yue Zhishi immediately said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be a lawyer in the future, I\u2019ll definitely be able to earn lots of money.\u201d\u201cI know, little lawyer.\u201d The corners of Song Yu\u2019s mouth lightly curled up. Lowering his eyes, he looked at the watch he\u2019d worn for so many years as it sat on his wrist. \u201cBut this one is already very good.\u201dYue Zhishi drew his wrist over. The watch he\u2019d gifted still looked like new; there were almost no signs of wear as a faint porcelain glow diffused from the black watch face. After nine years, he too received a watch from Song Yu from the same brand \u2014 it was like serious, yet long in coming, answer.\u201cDoes this count as a couple watch?\u201d He beamed, gazing at Song Yu.\u201cYes.\u201d Song Yu stroked his cheek and brought him in.Only very close friends were invited to this birthday lunch, and most of them were also from Wuhan U. Yue Zhishi still needed to go home for dinner later that night. He and Song Yu entered the booked room one after another, and they saw Qin Yan, Jiang Yufan and their girlfriends already sitting inside.Seeing Yue Zhishi, Jiang Yufan said, \u201cLe Le, you\u2019re finally here. Shen Mi and senior Nan Jia just left to buy milk tea. Xiao Cheng said he can\u2019t come, his mom\u2019s sick so he had to rush back to take care of her.\u201dXiao Cheng was the dorm mate Yue Zhishi had gone to buy instant noodles with. Yue Zhishi nodded and asked about their other dorm mate. \u201cWhat about brother Yang?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been called by his instructor to get some work done. Probably won\u2019t be able to come.\u201dQin Yan sighed. \u201cInstructors all love ordering about you new students who still listen to them. It\u2019s fine, it\u2019ll get better once you get past this year.\u201d He looked at Song Yu. \u201cDid you two come together? Your little brother asked you to pick him up?\u201d\u201cMn,\u201d Song Yu vaguely replied, walking over to sit on Qin Yan\u2019s right hand side. Yue Zhishi also followed, sitting close to him, and after they\u2019d finished ordering dishes, Shen Mi and Nan Jia came back with milk tea. The restaurant room instantly came alive.Nan Jia was sitting next to Yue Zhishi. \u201cHere, the green milk tea you like. Half sugar.\u201d\u201cThank you, senior.\u201d Yue Zhishi took it from her, poking through the top with a straw, and drank a large mouthful. Qin Yan\u2019s hand accidentally slipped as he was poking through his own straw, and his drink spilled over the table, dripping a bit onto Song Yu\u2019s pants.\u201cAiyah, sorry sorry, my fault, let me kneel in apology.\u201d Thinking Song Yu might explode with his obsession with cleanliness, Qin Yan kept madly apologising. But surprisingly, Song Yu seemed to be in a good mood, and he only stood up, walking away after he said he was going to clean himself up.\u201cOh, right, Le Le.\u201d Jiang Yufan lifted his head to look at him as he snapped apart a pair of chopsticks for his girlfriend. \u201cWhere\u2019d you run off to last night? You didn\u2019t even bring your phone. When Xiao Cheng said you weren\u2019t coming back after he came back up, I even thought he was joking.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi was nibbling on his straw, his eyes slightly evasive.Qin Yan joked, \u201cLe Le, you wouldn\u2019t have found someone behind your brother\u2019s back, right?\u201d He leaned over Song Yu\u2019s chair and looked at Yue Zhishi. \u201cHurry and tell me, which little lady\u2019s got her hands on you?\u201d\u201cNo one has,\u201d Yue Zhishi immediately denied.\u201cThen where\u2019d you go?\u201d Jiang Yufan worriedly said. \u201cYou guys wouldn\u2019t know this, but he ran out wearing his pyjamas and house slippers.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Nan Jia studied Yue Zhishi\u2019s clothes and shoes, her eyes ending up on the gold buttons on his cuffs. The longer she looked at them, the more they seemed familiar, as though she\u2019d seen them somewhere before.Yue Zhishi was seriously panicking; his ears started to burn as he thought about the things that had happened last night, and his brain promptly went into disarray. He wasn\u2019t good at lying to begin with, and now, he was even more unable to give them an excuse.He didn\u2019t expect Shen Mi to speak. He was smiling, voice careless. \u201cI called him out last night to an internet cafe. We booked a room and played games all night. Didn\u2019t he just finish his preliminary round? I wanted to take him out to relax.\u201dWithout considering why Shen Mi helped rescue him, Yue Zhishi grabbed his excuse like it was a lifeline. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I hung out with him at an internet cafe all night.\u201dJiang Yufan unconsciously helped him patch up his story. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have gone back to the dorm for a change of clothes this morning, would you? The three of us left super early, and we didn\u2019t bump into you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Yue Zhishi nodded his head in agreement like a chicken pecking rice, and he threw a grateful look at Shen Mi, who\u2019d saved him from disaster.\u201cLet\u2019s eat, let\u2019s eat,\u201d Shen Mi called out. He then turned around and asked Nan Jia, \u201cSenior, weren\u2019t you talking about the arts festival\u2019s preliminary round earlier on the way here? How about it, do you have any front line news you can leak out?\u201dNan Jia didn\u2019t seem to be paying much attention. She didn\u2019t hear what Shen Mi had said, and she waited until he repeated his question before nodding. \u201cYes.\u201d She smiled as she looked at Yue Zhishi. \u201cLe Le, I was sorting out the evaluation forms from the judges yesterday, and I saw your score was really high. All the comments were also really good, so you\u2019ll definitely be able to get into the school team.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Yue Zhishi was extremely happy. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic news. Then I can start getting ready for the upcoming competitions.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The results will be announced in the next few days, and then I\u2019ll have a meeting with you and your other teammates.\u201d Nan Jia patted his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re our law school\u2019s new rising star this year. Tell me if you\u2019re lacking anything, I\u2019ll do my best to help you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not lacking anything.\u201d Catching Nan Jia\u2019s hand, Yue Zhishi swung it up and down and didn\u2019t stand on ceremony at all. \u201cBut I really need a beautiful female model. It\u2019d be best if she was beautiful enough to be the school flower, and still be beautiful no matter what kind of clothing she wore.\u201dThe entire table burst into laughter.\u201cI can\u2019t believe the law school\u2019s school flower and school grass bargain like this in private!\u201d\u201cHahahahaha you set yourself up for that, senior Nan Jia.\u201dNan Jia was also laughing so hard she couldn\u2019t sit straight. \u201cFine fine fine, how could I refuse after you begged me? Then you have to design a beautiful dress for me.\u201d\u201cI will I will, I\u2019ll give the best-looking one to you.\u201dSong Yu opened the door to the room, heading back to his seat. He didn\u2019t interrupt, seeing their gleeful chatter, and only poured a cup of hot water for Yue Zhishi to let it cool down.\u201cNot bad, not bad. I\u2019ll wait to watch Le Le at the finals.\u201d Qin Yan grabbed a bit of the cold appetisers for his girlfriend, and then teased again, \u201cSince you\u2019ve passed the preliminary round, then I guess our Le Le didn\u2019t waste last night\u2019s internet cafe room.\u201dFrowning, Song Yu turned his head and looked at Yue Zhishi. \u201cInternet cafe?\u201dQin Yan explained to him, \u201cOh, you didn\u2019t hear yet? Your brother went behind your back last night and stayed overnight at an internet cafe with this Shen Mi here. They played games all night. I didn\u2019t expect him to also be someone addicted to the internet.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Song Yu pushed up the glasses sitting on the bridge of his nose, sounding rather thoughtful.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d Qin Yan thought Song Yu wasn\u2019t happy, and so he went to stand next to Yue Zhishi, speaking for Song Yu. \u201cI think this older brother of yours is so strict he\u2019s almost like a dad. It\u2019s beyond normal for an eighteen, nineteen year old boy to play games somewhere overnight. Someone as obedient as Le Le is ridiculously hard to find. Am I right, Le Le.\u201dWith his face covered with a look that said\u00a0aren\u2019t I so loyal, he raised his chin at Yue Zhishi \u2014 but Yue Zhishi was silently begging him to speak less.Song Yu gazed at Yue Zhishi\u2019s direction, and his voice seemed fairly calm. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m strict?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Yue Zhishi swiftly said without even thinking about it. \u201cMy gege is the kind of good gege that\u2019s ridiculously hard to find.\u201dEveryone around the table chuckled in amusement. \u201cLe Le, how could you be so cute.\u201dSong Yu stared at Yue Zhishi and arched an eyebrow. He inquired, voice deep, \u201cWhat game was so fun to play?\u201dYue Zhishi pressed his lips together, his heart running. With a very light voice, he weakly replied, \u201c\u2026it was just a normal game.\u201dAt this moment, Shen Mi didn\u2019t come out to help him, and he looked entirely like he had no relationship with him at all, knowing nothing except how to drink his milk tea.\u201cLooks like you didn\u2019t enjoy yourself enough.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s hand was gently wrapped around the white porcelain cup, his thumb lightly rubbing against the smooth surface. He spoke with an indifferent voice, clean from any inflection, but only the two of them seemed to be able to understand the words that came out of his mouth.\u201cI, I did\u2026.\u201d Yue Zhishi pretty much couldn\u2019t continue further, his face about to go up in flames.\u201cTake me along next time?\u201d Song Yu curved down his head, gazing into his eyes.Yue Zhishi\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple slid up and down, and he meekly nodded, whispering, \u201cOkay.\u201dThe author has something to say:Refined_rascal_unlockedWithout his previous love rival annoying him, Song Yu wouldn\u2019t have even realised he had the ability to drive a high speed rail train while sitting at the dining tablePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 68: Dark and Gloomy Breeding GroundSong Yu\u2019s provocation having reached that point, he decided to let it go once he saw Yue Zhishi\u2019s red ears.A waiter pushed open the door to the room and placed dishes one after another onto the table, a platter with a large\u00a0steamed fish head\u00a0set into the very middle. An equal mix of chopped spicy red chillies and pickled green peppers were poured over the top, and delicate fish flesh soaked in the sauce along with its translucent layers of gelatine. It was spicy, and yet the sourness of the pickled peppers teased the appetite. Yue Zhishi really liked mixing his rice with the steamed fish head\u2019s sauce, and it would be even better if he could get a mouthful of\u00a0preserved eggs mashed with spicy green peppers\u00a0to eat with it. Mashing the soft, roasted peppers with preserved eggs until everything was crushed together made the entire dish creamy and silky \u2014 and a light, mild milky fragrance could be savoured.He loved the kind of delicious dishes that were made using every day ingredients; they were like the majority of everyone\u2019s lives: everyone was very ordinary, yet there would always be someone who lived their lives filled with pleasure and beauty.Both Qin Yan and Jiang Yufan were the type to really take care of their partners when in a relationship. They were constantly serving food and pouring soup for their girlfriends, and noises of their mutual teasing and nagging, clever jokes or snappy lines, were heard around the table. They made the lunch very lively. Yue Zhishi was watching them while he ate, and he occasionally joined in their chatter with a few words; when he lowered his head, he realised his own bowl suddenly held an extra piece of fish, free of bones with no scallions or minced ginger. There was also a small portion of the fish collar \u2014 something Yue Zhishi enjoyed eating.He looked at Song Yu and quietly said to him, \u201cYou eat it.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t speak. He lowered his head and drank some soup, saying he didn\u2019t like that part.\u201cHow delicious are fish collars, it\u2019s usually super expensive when you buy them grilled,\u201d Qin Yan said.Hearing them talk about fish collars, Jiang Yufan stared at Yue Zhishi\u2019s face for a while from his seat directly across from him. He stared until Yue Zhishi lifted his head and met his eyes, and then he poked in the air with his chopsticks. \u201cLe Le, why do you have a split lip?\u201dShen Mi and Nan Jia also peeked at him.\u201cHuh?\u201d Yue Zhishi subconsciously licked his lip before remembering something. His face madly flushed, and he said, \u201cThe weather\u2019s been a bit dry lately\u2026 My lips have been peeling, and I accidentally split it when I was picking at the skin.\u201dSong Yu pushed a cup of water in front of him as soon as he finished speaking. \u201cDrink.\u201dYue Zhishi glanced at him, but he could only obediently pick up the boiled water he\u2019d been unwilling to drink.\u201cI think it\u2019s been okay. The last few days have been damned humid with it raining every day. We\u2019ve only been able to practice indoors.\u201d Qin Yan stretched. \u201cOnce your arts festival\u2019s over, it\u2019ll be about time for basketball season to start. And then we\u2019ll have to continue training. Brother Song, come over and help with the new kids when you\u2019re free.\u201dSong Yu put down his chopsticks, mildly saying, \u201cWe can talk about it again when I\u2019m back.\u201d\u201cBack?\u201d Jiang Yufan was curious. \u201cSenior, are you heading out for field work again?\u201dYue Zhishi was obviously much more surprised than he was \u2014 he almost choked, and he ended up coughing for a while.\u201cMn.\u201d Song Yu gave him some more water, and the tone of his voice was much gentler than before, sounding as though he was explaining only to him. \u201cI was notified only last night.\u201dNo wonder. They\u2019d met in the middle of the night yesterday, and they hadn\u2019t been able to speak about other things.\u201cThen how long will you be gone? Will you leave the province?\u201d Yue Zhishi hurriedly asked, not bothering with his water.Song Yu dipped his head. \u201cFor around a week.\u201dPressing his lips together, Yue Zhishi very sensibly didn\u2019t continue asking further, but Qin Yan, with his curious heart stirred up, asked a bunch of various questions. \u201cHey, what kind of stuff is this place filled with? Any expensive rock or ore or something? Bring me back some~\u201d\u201cIt has plenty of\u00a0nanmu\u00a0wood.\u201d Song Yu took off his glasses and placed them on the table, closing his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose.\u201cNanmu? Is that really expensive?\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice was filled with doubt, and he took and fiddled with Song Yu\u2019s glasses, perching them on top of his own nose.\u201cYes.\u201d Song Yu raised his eyes. \u201cValuable for coffin making.\u201d\u201cCoffins?\u201d Shen Mi was the first to burst into laughter. \u201cHahahahaha, that\u2019s fantastic!\u201dEveryone around the table howled, and Qin Yan wrapped his arm around Song Yu\u2019s neck, shaking him. \u201cYou little shit, your mouth\u2019s so poisonous!\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t you looking for something expensive.\u201d A slight smile was on Song Yu\u2019s face, and his eyes were directed at Yue Zhishi. He gently told him to take off his glasses, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t wear mine, it\u2019ll be bad for your eyes.\u201dAfter finishing their lunch, Qin Yan was going to bring Nan Jia and Shen Mi back to the basketball team while Jiang Yufan was going to go on a date with his girlfriend. Everyone separated in front of the restaurant. The car park was a bit far; the rest of them stood and waited for Qin Yan and Song Yu to drive their cars over. Yue Zhishi and Nan Jia were standing on the side of the road, watching as Shen Mi and Jiang Yufan pretended to fight and fuss with each other not too far away. The sky was so blue it was clear and transparent, and clouds floated high up \u2014 only the wind was a bit strong, and so Nan Jia gathered her windbreaker around herself tightly. She looked at Yue Zhishi and noticed his wrist.\u201cYour watch\u2019s really nice,\u201d Nan Jia praised very sincerely. Pulling her messy hair behind her ears, she lightly said, \u201cI only noticed just now. I\u2019m truly so slow.\u201dYue Zhishi only heard the first part of her words, and he happily said, \u201cRight? Senior, you think it\u2019s nice?\u201dNan Jia earnestly nodded. \u201cIt must\u2019ve been a birthday present. You can tell someone\u2019s spent a lot of time and effort while choosing it.\u201dBut she didn\u2019t ask who gifted it, and Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t notice anything wrong \u2014 he only nodded in pleasure. Except he was still slightly unused to wearing it, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve never worn a watch before. This looks really expensive, so I keep worrying about knocking it into things. I\u2019m also afraid it doesn\u2019t suit me.\u201d\u201cYou worry way too much.\u201d Nan Jia patted his shoulder and gave him a sweet and pretty smile. \u201cNo one is more suitable than you. And the important thing isn\u2019t the watch \u2014 it\u2019s the feelings behind it. It\u2019ll be fine as long as you make sure to protect and treasure it.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded and helped wrapped the loose half of Nan Jia\u2019s scarf back around her neck. When he heard Qin Yan\u2019s voice, he turned around and saw his and Song Yu\u2019s cars drawing near.Song Yu\u2019s car was the same as his person: matte black, very low key and spotlessly clean. He sat in the driver\u2019s seat, steering without any expression on his face, and occasionally glanced at the mirrors.Jiang Yufan and his girlfriend came over, and he first said Yue Zhishi was wearing too little and then told him to remember to bring him back some yummy things after going home. Yue Zhishi responded to everything, while Jiang Yufan\u2019s girlfriend asked Nan Jia, curious, \u201cSenior, are you currently single?\u201dNan Jia smiled as she nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAre your standards too high?\u201d Jiang Yufan\u2019s girlfriend joked, \u201cOr maybe there are really too few suitable people.\u201d\u201cNot at all,\u201d Nan Jia chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t have a particular ideal in mind. It\u2019ll be fine even if I just liked how the person looked at first glance. I\u2019m just currently missing that tiny bit of fate.\u201dThe other girl also laughed. \u201cThen what about a girl hahahaha.\u201dNan Jia pulled up her hair into a ponytail very handsomely and purposefully winked at her. \u201cWho knows.\u201dJiang Yufan suddenly felt a sense of danger and jumped to stand in between his own girlfriend and Nan Jia. \u201cSenior, not this one. Not this one.\u201dYue Zhishi laughed until his stomach hurt, and he crouched down, propping up his face like a child while he gazed at them. He stayed there until Song Yu arrived in front of him with his car, rolling down his window. Yue Zhishi stood back up, getting into the car and leaving after saying goodbye to everyone.On the drive back, Yue Zhishi had nothing to do. He took Song Yu\u2019s phone and watched some anime, but he didn\u2019t like the newly released sequel. Without even finishing an episode and before they\u2019d even crossed the river, he\u2019d already fallen asleep in the passenger seat, his head curved.They were almost home by the time he woke back up. He noticed his seat was laid flat, and there was a U-shaped pillow supporting his neck \u2014 Song Yu was still in his driver\u2019s seat, focused on driving, as though he\u2019d done nothing at all.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t make a sound and didn\u2019t get up; he lay in his seat, on his back, and reached out, caressing Song Yu\u2019s elbow.\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d Song Yu quickly looked at him from above through his rearview mirror, and then he gave him a bottle of sparkling water. \u201cHave some.\u201dListening to him, Yue Zhishi sat up. His mind was a bit fuzzy from sleep, so after he opened the bottle and drank a large mouthful, he stared at the sky in a daze. It had been only a short while, and yet the sky had already changed \u2014 the world outside the window looked as though it was covered by grey fog, heavy and ugly rain clouds all gathered together to darken the sky.Lin Rong and Song Jin had originally planned to come and have dinner near their university, but Song Jin hadn\u2019t been able to leave work. Coincidentally, since Song Yu needed to head out to the northwest region of China for fieldwork, he wanted to go back home and stay for a night, conveniently packing up a few pieces of thicker clothes.The last time Yue Zhishi had gone home, it\u2019d been by himself. It had been the same as always: he\u2019d eaten and slept, played around with the cat and dog at home, watched dramas with Lin Rong while listening to her gossip \u2014 he hadn\u2019t felt much of a burden. But returning this time with Song Yu, his heart kept feeling vaguely uneasy.They exited the elevator, and Song Yu didn\u2019t look different compared to usual. He silently opened the door to their home, and Yue Zhishi went into the hallway entrance with him, changing his shoes. Their house slippers were already waiting at the doorway, placed neatly and tidily.Cotton Candy immediately rushed out, and he circled around Yue Zhishi and Song Yu\u2019s legs. Picking him up, Yue Zhishi kissed him a few times on his head and closed the door. He heard Lin Rong calling from inside, \u201cAre you boys back?\u201dIn that moment, Yue Zhishi was transported back to secondary school. Every day they\u2019d come home during the midday break, Lin Rong had waited for them, just like this.He made a noise in response and greeted her; he then went in with his slippers, Cotton Candy jumping out of his arms to bother Song Yu. Orange was sleeping on the sofa in the living room, and he raised his head at the noise, lazily swaying his tail like he was giving them a very dignified greeting.A half-finished cashmere sweater was left on the sofa, the other one already completed. The only difference between them was the colour.Yue Zhishi had bought Lin Rong\u2019s favourite ice cream downstairs. Whenever they watched television together, Lin Rong would always fuss and say, \u201cI\u2019ll get fat again after finishing this,\u201d and then devour the entire carton.Song Yu followed behind, only greeting his mom after entering. Lin Rong came out of the kitchen in a dusty pink apron, holding a tomato, and was completely bare-faced; her hair was very loosely tied up behind her head. In Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes, she didn\u2019t look much different compared to ten years ago.\u201cI bought ice cream, I\u2019ll put it into the freezer.\u201d Yue Zhishi headed over to pull open the freezer door.\u201cAiyah, I\u2019ll gain weight again,\u201d Lin Rong\u00a0may have said, but she still went after Yue Zhishi, looking at what flavour he\u2019d bought.\u201cYour dad\u2019s on his way back, he\u2019ll be home soon.\u201d She lifted her head, looked at Song Yu and then frowned. \u201cXiao Yu, have your eyes gotten worse?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re okay.\u201d Song Yu said he only wore them when studying or driving. \u201cThey\u2019re still around 200 degrees.\u201d\u201cMake sure you get them checked on a regular basis, you can\u2019t let them get worse.\u201d Lin Rong smoothened out a wrinkle on his coat before she turned around and went back into the kitchen with her uncut tomato. She chattered, \u201cI hear if your nearsightedness gets to 600 degrees, it\u2019ll be passed onto your next generation. Our family has no history of nearsightedness, so try not to let your little one have bad eyes as soon as they\u2019re born.\u201dYue Zhishi froze for an entire second once he heard what Lin Rong said. A thin, closely woven layer of pain slowly grew on his face \u2014 it felt ice-cold, like it was being pierced by many very narrow, very small needles.He looked over, and just happened to meet Song Yu\u2019s eyes. Song Yu seemed to be extremely sensitive to his reaction; he directly went and caught his arm. He didn\u2019t use much strength, but it felt like his hand pressed onto one of Yue Zhishi\u2019s restlessly beating nerves, giving him some reassurance.\u201cI\u2019m going to rest upstairs for a bit,\u201d Song Yu said, looking at Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes.Lin Rong replied with her back to them, \u201cGo ahead, it\u2019s still early. It\u2019s only 4pm.\u201dBut Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t go up with him \u2014 he stayed in the kitchen, helping Lin Rong get the vegetables ready for cooking.Song Yu stood in place for a while, as if he didn\u2019t want to head upstairs by himself, but his cellphone rang with a call from his advisor. He ended up going upstairs.\u201cYour brother\u2019s so busy,\u201d Lin Rong sighed.Compared to the majority of other mothers, Lin Rong very often gave off the sense of being not too reliable. She didn\u2019t seem to be as steady as many other mothers, let alone appear to be as weary. She was young, beautiful and had a childish heart \u2014 she liked to whine and act spoiled to her husband and son, and sometimes she\u2019d even be talked about by their relatives behind her back.But in reality, Lin Rong took it upon herself to take care of their lives as wholeheartedly and seriously as any other mother. Everyone in her family had their food, clothing, shelter and transportation organised perfectly; Yue Zhishi thought even if she cooked the simplest stir-fried vegetables, the dish she made was better than what anyone else could make.\u201cHow\u2019s school? Any issues with the preliminary round?\u201d Lin Rong made a very shallow cross cut on the top of the tomato and then placed it into boiling water for a few minutes.\u201cNo, there shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Yue Zhishi told her about some of the things that\u2019d happened at school, focusing on only the minor ones \u2014 like the old professor who lectured with an accent, the revolting\u00a0watermelon stir-fried with meat\u00a0in the cafeteria and the osmanthus flowers that\u2019d bloomed across an entire road without anyone plucking them.The sole thing he didn\u2019t dare talk about was his current dating life.\u201cWhat a pity, they could\u2019ve been made into so much osmanthus sugar. Ah, that\u2019s right \u2014 I made some\u00a0tangyuan\u00a0with osmanthus sugar. I left them in the freezer, so have some after dinner.\u201d The skin of the tomato started to curl, and Lin Rong scooped it out, putting it into iced water. She peeled off the skin, placing it to the side, and then pulled out a long stalk of celery; after breaking off the end, she very carefully pulled off the rough strings on the back of the stalk.Yue Zhishi also grabbed another stalk, attempting to help her. But he wasn\u2019t very used to the movements, and Lin Rong taught him how to do it, step by step. \u201cLike this. Pull off the strings from the bottom part. Yes, just like that.\u201dAt one point, she called Yue Zhishi \u2018maomao\u2019. She usually called him Le Le, sometimes called him darling \u2014 maomao was what people in this city called little babies who\u2019d just been born. But Lin Rong often called Yue Zhishi by that nickname, as though he was still a very small child needing to be breastfed.Yue Zhishi was already used to it, and yet when he suddenly heard it come out of her mouth today, his nose started to burn.\u201cThe two of you are honestly so funny. You can\u2019t eat so many things, but you love eating everything except for ginger and goji berries. Your brother\u2019s much more troublesome with how picky he is \u2014 he won\u2019t eat celery with strings still in them or unpeeled tomatoes. And he likes soup.\u201d She set down the peeled celery talks to one side and gave a great sigh. \u201cLuckily he knows how to cook himself, or else I\u2019d be so worried.\u201dKnowing what she would be worried about, Yue Zhishi only said, \u201cGege is really amazing, he can do everything by himself.\u201d\u201cBut he still needs someone to care for him and for him to care for.\u201d Lin Rong chopped the cooled tomato into chunks and put it into the wok that was simmering over the stove. Chunks of beef, braised until soft, were inside. \u201cI actually don\u2019t know how to feel. On one hand, I don\u2019t want you guys to grow up \u2014 either of you \u2014 and whenever I remember the two of you will one day leave me to create your own families, my heart really hurts.\u201dShe stirred the wok with a small spoon. \u201cBut the thing is, I still want you guys to be able to find someone you like. Especially your brother. Every time I think about how lonely he always is, I feel so upset. He clearly has such good qualities, so why has he been single all these years?\u201dYue Zhishi stayed silent. He didn\u2019t know what he should say, so he didn\u2019t add to the conversation at all.\u201cI know he has high standards, and he might not be able to be like other children and immediately find someone he likes. But he can\u2019t keep continuing on like this. I\u2019ll get anxious.\u201d She scooped out some soup, blew on it and held it out for Yue Zhishi. \u201cGive it a try. Does it need more salt?\u201dYue Zhishi obediently sipped it and shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d He touched Lin Rong\u2019s arm, trying to comfort her, but he could only say to her, \u201cDon\u2019t think about stuff like that anymore.\u201d\u201cThen what else can I think about?\u201d Lin Rong set down the spoon. \u201cThe two of you are grown up now. We can only hope for you and your brother to be safe and healthy and to spend each day in happiness. For you to have very blissful lives.\u201d She stroked Yue Zhishi\u2019s face, wrinkling her own nose a bit playfully. \u201cBut you\u2019re still young, don\u2019t rush to get into a relationship. I still want you to stay with me for a few more years.\u201dYue Zhishi smiled. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you rushing me?\u201dCrouching down, Lin Rong checked the chicken wings baking in the oven. She said, voice full of worry, \u201cBecause darling, you\u2019re too innocent. I\u2019m really scared of you getting tricked. It\u2019s already bad enough to have your feelings cheated, but what if someone likes you and you don\u2019t like them back? Or what if they come back for revenge after breaking up? You already have a body different from everyone else. If you end up in some kind of danger, I\u2019ll probably cry myself to death.\u201dYue Zhishi stood in the kitchen, completely still \u2014 he gazed at Aunt Rong, who was crouching right in front of him, and was unable to push a single word out of his mouth. His eyes were stinging, but he restrained his own emotions. For a single moment, he wanted to come clean to Lin Rong: he wanted to tell her that there was a possibility he liked men and didn\u2019t like women.But he looked at the kitchen, brimming with food, and thought about the sweaters sitting in the living room. His thoughts jumped around, and they landed on Song Jin, who was rushing home from work to spend his birthday with him despite being so busy with work.He let go of that reckless thought.At the very least, he didn\u2019t want to shatter the one day everyone was focused on celebrating with him.Yue Zhishi was heartbroken for everyone except himself. The love and warmth, the flavours and smells of life in his home \u2014 they were like a dull knife scraping at his heart, and it made him unable to decide between going forward or moving backwards. In the end, he chose to hide away.\u201cI\u2019ll go feed Orange and Cotton Candy.\u201dLin Rong turned around and lovingly brushed a hand down his back. \u201cSure. I\u2019ve left their food bowls upstairs in the entrance of the corner storage room. Don\u2019t give them too much, Cotton Candy\u2019s stomach hasn\u2019t been too well lately.\u201dGoing upstairs with slow footsteps, Yue Zhishi knelt outside the storage room and poured some dog food for Cotton Candy. He then opened a can of cat food for Orange. Cotton Candy hurtled upstairs as soon as he heard the sound of food, while Orange leisurely made his way. Yue Zhishi sat in front of them, hugging his knees, and quietly watched on as they ate.\u201cDon\u2019t eat so quickly,\u201d he softly said to Cotton Candy. Stroking his back, Yue Zhishi felt like he\u2019d lost weight, and even his breathing had become heavier.Yue Zhishi rose back up and walked down the corridor to open the door to his room. The curtains were pulled open inside, and his room was very dim in the rainy, overcast day. He lifted a hand, wanting to close the door and turn on the lights; abruptly, he felt his arm being caught by a warm hand.The door was pushed shut.He met Song Yu\u2019s eyes as soon as he raised his head. All of a sudden, for no reason at all, Yue Zhishi felt bleak.In the past, if Song Yu had entered his room like this, he would\u2019ve been ridiculously, insanely happy. But Song Yu had never came.His arm lowered. He didn\u2019t want to turn on the lights anymore.Yue Zhishi tilted down his face, and in the shadowy room, he wordlessly wrapped his arms around Song Yu. They leaned on the door \u2014 beyond it lay their bright, warm home.Song Yu raised a hand, massaging Yue Zhishi\u2019s nape. He gently asked, \u201cTired?\u201dStill in his arms, Yue Zhishi shook his head, giving him an answer to a question he didn\u2019t ask. Very, very quietly, he called out,\u00a0Song Yu.\u201cHm?\u201d Song Yu looked down, and his hand slid to his back, lightly caressing.\u201cI love you,\u201d Yue Zhishi very quietly said.Song Yu seemed to understand something \u2014 both of them had extremely keen abilities to sense the changes in each other\u2019s emotions. But Song Yu didn\u2019t ask the reason for his current mood, only lifting up Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t kiss him, as though he was afraid of agitating him, and simply pressed their foreheads lightly together. \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday today. Don\u2019t be sad.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sad.\u201d Yue Zhishi rose on his tiptoes and kissed Song Yu. He didn\u2019t dodge away, squeezing him even tighter.The colour of the sky was edging closely to darkness, and this room was like a breeding ground that could tolerate secrets and mistakes \u2014 even though Yue Zhishi knew one day they needed to turn on the lights.No one could live their entire life in darkness. Especially someone like Song Yu, so outstanding he belonged to a shining and brilliant future.There will be one day where their lies would be laid bare, but he secretly told himself in his heart: when that day really came, he wanted everything to be laid upon himself. Song Yu was someone cautious and thorough, and he had a perfect, orderly life \u2014 he shouldn\u2019t be the one to make mistakes, and it also shouldn\u2019t be him to admit to those mistakes.In his parents\u2019 hearts, in pretty much everyone\u2019s hearts, Song Yu would become an extraordinary man of learning. He\u2019d shine and glow in his chosen field, have a beautiful and kind wife, and then he\u2019d have an adorable child blessed with his excellent genes. His life would be full of joy, and would not have a single blemish.At this thought, Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart started to irrationally hurt; it became hard to breathe.He was so petty \u2014 even imagining something like that gave him pain. If a hopeful, glorious blueprint of life really needed to be shredded, then it should be his.After all, he had been so selfish. He\u2019d snatched away all of Song Yu\u2019s possibilities.To Yue Zhishi, the love Song Yu gave him was like a prize dropped from the sky; it was a beautiful dream he was unwilling to wake from. But Yue Zhishi was very aware \u2014 to him, the familial love Lin Rong and Song Jin gave him was precious and unlike anything else.He had no one else he could call his family.It was highly unlikely he could have both. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t think he would be that fortunate. Greedy people would get nothing at all, so he needed to prepare himself to one day give up one of them.Lost in his thoughts, Yue Zhishi could feel Song Yu drawing him in closer. He called out a single\u00a0Le Le, voice very low, and it made Yue Zhishi feel very, very secure.\u201cI suddenly want to see your parents,\u201d Song Yu said.This was already something that couldn\u2019t be done, but Yue Zhishi still asked, \u201cWhy all of a sudden?\u201dSong Yu spoke very gravely. \u201cI need to thank them for giving birth to you.\u201dYue Zhishi felt even more distressed, but he didn\u2019t want to cry. He continued holding it in.\u201cI hear you were born in the afternoon. I remember my parents receiving a phone call in the afternoon, but it should\u2019ve been morning in England.\u201d Song Yu softly laughed, as though he was laughing at himself for unexpectedly being able to remember something that\u2019d happened when he was three.His chin gently rested on the top of Yue Zhishi\u2019s head. A rarely seen feeling of dependency came from his posture, as if at this moment, Song Yu really needed Yue Zhishi.\u201cI really want to go back to this time nineteen years ago. I want to wait for you to be born in the delivery room, and then hold your hand.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s eyes were burning, stinging very badly, but he was still smiling. \u201cJust my hand?\u201dSong Yu hesitated. \u201cWould they let a three year old child carry you?\u201d\u201cPerhaps, if it were you.\u201d Yue Zhishi felt he was being very strange, acting as though that fantasy was real. \u201cWhat would you do? Steal the baby away?\u201dSong Yu shook his head. \u201cI would carry you to the corner and tell you \u2014 we\u2019ll grow up together. I really like you, and a bit more than a decade later, we\u2019ll be together.\u201d He spoke lightly, airily, and yet his voice was tender, tugging Yue Zhishi out from his suffering and anxiety and giving him warmth.\u201cPlease fall in love with me a bit earlier, okay?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because to him, it was cruel to imagine alternatives to his life; things that were already lost to him remained lost. The more beautiful and peaceful things he imagined, the more cruel reality would be \u2014 which is why he so calmly accepted his reality of not having parents and accepted his own highly allergic body and asthma that made him unable to do so many things. As long as he accepted things easily enough, the less there would be to regret.But as he remained in Song Yu\u2019s embrace, Yue Zhishi really longed for something different \u2014 even if time couldn\u2019t rewind back to before he turned three years old, even if he couldn\u2019t have his own family again, that was fine too. He wouldn\u2019t be greedy; he\u2019d be happy for time to rewind just a little, tiny bit.If he\u2019d learned of Song Yu\u2019s heart just a little earlier, then he wouldn\u2019t have left him standing there by himself for so long.\u201cSay, if we didn\u2019t grow up together, would you still like me?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked, nestled in Song Yu\u2019s arms. He was reluctant to move away.Song Yu nodded. \u201cI would.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t think of many things about him that would move Song Yu\u2019s heart, but he pulled out a few reasons he thought were reasonable. \u201cYou think I have a decent face and have an acceptable personality, right?\u201dSong Yu wasn\u2019t too satisfied with Yue Zhishi\u2019s \u2018decent\u2019 and \u2018acceptable\u2019. He didn\u2019t understand why Yue Zhishi\u2019s understanding of himself never seemed to match up with his true self when he\u2019d grown up being pursued and flattered.\u201cYou are the best-looking person I\u2019ve ever seen, and you have the best personality I\u2019ve ever met. But that\u2019s just a small part of why you shine,\u201d Song Yu said very steadily. The exaggerated praise that left his mouth was unusual, but he said the words heavily and with such strength that they left no room to be questioned. \u201cYou are a child born to be loved by everyone who sees you. It\u2019s natural for me to like you.\u201dAnd besides, no one else would be like Yue Zhishi \u2014 his heart had been given only to him, and he never asked for anything in return as it released light and warmth for Song Yu.He\u2019d clearly held it in for so long, but Yue Zhishi still ended up crying. Tears rolled down his face, but they fell silently, without noise.After growing up and becoming an adult, being able to cry had turned into something of a luxury; it was embarrassing and private, and tears could no longer fall at any moment and at any time. They were meant to fall when alone, so that no one would be able to tell they\u2019d cried. It was a basic rule of being an adult: to not create emotional burdens for anyone else.But to Yue Zhishi, Song Yu was a secret time capsule. In his arms, Yue Zhishi, who was now an adult, could forever be a small child who cried whenever he wanted.By the time Song Jin came back home, Yue Zhishi had already recovered his relatively mature appearance. He poured tea for Song Jin like a well-behaved child, and they sat together and chatted without a single hint of anything wrong. No matter who looked at them, they looked like a pair of father and son who had nothing they couldn\u2019t say to each other.Song Jin had a habit of bringing home presents for his family no matter where he went, and everyone\u2019s gift would be different. It was one of Yue Zhishi\u2019s most favourite activities to have everyone sitting around the living room and opening their presents together.He received a book this time, written by Justice Albie Sachs from the Constitutional Court of South Africa. It talked about how South Africa\u2019s constitution was created and established, providing a view into the country as it transformed into a republic, and explored the concepts of human rights, freedom and equality. Song Jin liked buying books for the two boys, and especially for Yue Zhishi. He would always personally read through a selection of books, pick out the one he thought was worth reading and write, on the title page, three words: \u2018To: Zhishi\u2019. It was like an old-fashioned, traditional blessing.\u201cI\u2019ve already read it, and I think you\u2019d really like it.\u201d Song Jin swallowed some tea. \u201cI used to think you wouldn\u2019t really suit law. Your personality\u2019s too gentle, and you\u2019re too kind. But my previous biases have changed after reading that book \u2014 now, I think you\u2019d really be suited for law. That profession really needs empathy, mercy and justice.\u201d His loving face held a slight hint of delight, as though he was pleased about the change in his own thinking.\u201cReally?\u201d Yue Zhishi was also delighted; it was very important to him to be able to get something similar to fatherly approval from Song Jin.Within Yue Zhishi\u2019s last ten-plus years of growing up, Song Jin had acted like a father figure \u2014 he\u2019d worked and struggled to improve their lives and had given all of them an extremely solid material foundation and emotional support.\u201cYes.\u201d Even though Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t been truly questioning him, Song Jin still gave him a concrete response. He placed down his tea cup and leaned back against the sofa, gazing at the photo hung on the wall. \u201cI sometimes think you\u2019re so gentle and calm because you\u2019ve grown up with me. Our family\u2019s environment has definitely shaped your personality. If you\u2019d grown up with Yue Yi, you might be more open and cheerful; you might even be a little adventurer ready to try anything.\u201dOnly when he was talking about Yue Zhishi\u2019s father would Song Jin\u2019s face reveal a complicated smile. His lips were curled up, but his eyes were in pain.\u201cHe might look down at me for teaching you to be so conventional.\u201d Song Jin smiled as he said, \u201cIf it were him, he might\u2019ve taken you mountain climbing, snorkelling; he would\u2019ve taught you how to ski. But your body\u2019s not too strong, so I would\u2019ve been worried. If he\u2019d wanted to take you to all those things, I definitely would\u2019ve gotten into a big fight with him \u2014 I\u2019d tell him to settle down, to learn how to be a reliable father. I was already talking about it when you were first born. He must\u2019ve been so annoyed with me.\u201dSong Jin fell silent, staring at the crystal clear liquid in his tea cup. He then patted his knees. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it anymore, it\u2019s time for dinner. I\u2019m going to see what kind of delicious things Xiao Rong has made today.\u201dYue Zhishi watched as Song Jin walked away, and he sunk into sadness and melancholy. But it wasn\u2019t for himself.To him, his father had only existed for three years. He hadn\u2019t been able to create a cache of memories and an emotional base for his father as an infant \u2014 but for Song Jin, Yue Zhishi\u2019s father had been the best friend he\u2019d grown up with, an existence as close and as intimate to him as his own hands and feet.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know if his dad had been a reliable father, but he definitely must\u2019ve been an extremely good friend.The dining table remained wreathed in warmth and comfort. Lin Rong made a very large sea salt and Oreo cream cake, and even the Oreos were homemade. All different kinds of berries that Yue Zhishi liked eating rested on the top. The chiffon cake was made from a mixture of rice and almond flour, and it was soft and puffy with a light nutty fragrance.\u201cI\u2019ve tested this recipe four times, you guys will definitely like it. It\u2019s a lot fluffier than the cakes from outside, and the texture\u2019s also really delicate. Quickly try it.\u201d Lin Rong cut out and gave Yue Zhishi the largest slice. \u201cThis birthday is the last year our Le Le will have a number one in front of his age. You have to stay healthy and sound.\u201dSong Jin nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right, next year will be the start of your fragile twenties.\u201dLin Rong smacked him. \u201cDon\u2019t say the word fragile. He\u2019s going to be healthy and strong.\u201d\u201cHealthy is possible.\u201d Song Yu held Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrist and arm that were narrower than his by an entire circle. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know about strong.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m heaps strong, I even have abs.\u201d Yue Zhishi lifted up the bottom of his shirt, wanting to show Song Yu, but he suddenly remembered something and rapidly pulled it back down again. He continued to eat with his ears reddened.\u201cAbs are good, your brother\u2019s abs are quite nice.\u201d After giving everyone a piece of cake, Lin Rong sat back down. \u201cHurry and try it. This rice flour cake should be really good. Once your birthday\u2019s passed, I\u2019m going to make and sell mini versions at Yanghe Qizhe. I\u2019m going to call it \u2018Le Le\u2019s Sea Salt and Oreo Chiffon Cream Cake\u2019.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the name a bit long?\u201d\u201cHahaha true.\u201dYue Zhishi raised his fork, eating his first bite amidst the sound of laughter. Abruptly, he realised something he had never once noticed over the years.To Chinese families, the dining table was a very special, very sacred place. Adults would always say things like \u2018eat first, we\u2019ll talk afterwards\u2019 or \u2018you can\u2019t talk about unhappy things around the dining table\u2019. It didn\u2019t matter how hard life was \u2014 the dining table was a precious utopia. As everyone shared their food, they were also sharing in each other\u2019s lives.And in the Song family\u2019s utopia, wheat did not exist.Only Yue Zhishi was allergic to it, and yet over the last ten-plus years, their entire family of four had eliminated this seemingly essential allergen \u2014 for him.If he hadn\u2019t fallen in love with his own \u2018older brother\u2019, Yue Zhishi would\u2019ve been the happiest child in the entire world.That night, Song Jin watched a basketball match; Lin Rong continued to knit her sweater. Yue Zhishi headed towards the sofa with a cup of warm milk and very docilely leaned against Lin Rong\u2019s shoulder, watching as she used a pair of very thin knitting needles to double knit. Song Yu came over with a book, and he sat on the sofa next to them, reading.\u201cThis is rare.\u201d Lin Rong lifted her eyes and nudged Yue Zhishi with her shoulder. \u201cYour brother\u2019s not shut up by himself today.\u201dYue Zhishi looked over and happened to meet Song Yu\u2019s eyes just as he looked up as well. He felt somewhat guilty, but he felt like having the entire family gathered together was just too blissful.\u201cMaybe gege missed you,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, leaning back onto Lin Rong\u2019s shoulder.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d The string of yarn was hooked around Lin Rong\u2019s pinky. With a look on her face that said she intended to cutely whine, she said, \u201cHow am I supposed to know he missed me if he doesn\u2019t tell me?\u201d She gave Song Yu a meaningful look. \u201cLearn from your dad. Humans are born with mouths in order to speak.\u201dFather Song had been focused on his match, and after being suddenly mentioned, he reached out and squeezed Lin Rong\u2019s shoulders without having a single clue about what was happening. He asked with some confusion, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Xiao Rong?\u201dYue Zhishi and Lin Rong both laughed, and Song Yu grabbed and took a sip of Yue Zhishi\u2019s cup of warm milk, completely acting as though the entire situation had nothing to do with him.\u201cNothing, I was just teasing your son.\u201d She stopped moving her hands and started throwing a bunch of praise at Song Yu. \u201cLook at you. Your looks, your character \u2014 if you had just half of your dad\u2019s gentleness and thoughtfulness, even a goddess would come down from the heavens for you.\u201dYue Zhishi felt a bit shy for no reason at all, and he didn\u2019t dare make a noise. Song Yu, coincidentally drinking some milk, choked on her words and coughed twice before his face straightened out. He looked back down at his book and sedately said, \u201cComrade Song Jin has both looks and character and is gentle, thoughtful and kind. Even he couldn\u2019t get a goddess, so how could I?\u201dLin Rong wasn\u2019t able to respond after hearing what he said; her mind whirled and went\u00a0wait a second, and she placed her two hands in her lap. As soon as Yue Zhishi saw her posture, he immediately went to rub her back, saying, \u201cHe did, he did \u2014 Aunt Rong is the goddess.\u201dLin Rong kicked Song Jin. \u201cYour son\u2019s provoking me every day. Aren\u2019t you going to handle him?\u201dThe match was just about to reach match point, and Song Jin wasn\u2019t able to split his attention both ways. He had only a general idea of what was happening, and he hugged his wife\u2019s shoulders and kissed the top of her head. \u201cI will. You\u2019re the queen mother after all.\u201dLin Rong pushed him away. \u201cWhat does that have to do with anything. Go watch your basketball.\u201dYue Zhishi had fallen over on the sofa from laughing so much, and he peeked a look at Song Yu, seeing the laughter also on his lips. For an instant, he felt like their life together as a family was truly very wonderful \u2014 he really hoped time could stop at this very moment.Seeing that even Song Yu was laughing, Lin Rong was both amused and annoyed, and she ended up releasing a long sigh. \u201cSince my Xiao Yu is so picky, I think he might not even like the goddess even if she came down for him. I wonder what kind of person he might end up liking?\u201dYue Zhishi continued to play dead, and he thought Song Yu would as well. Yet Song Yu unexpectedly opened his mouth, his eyes lowered onto his book, and with a calm and unperturbed face, he said, \u201cForget about the goddess.\u201d\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t mind an angel.\u201dThe author has something to say:This might be the happiest family environment I\u2019ve ever writtenPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The weather remained heavy and gloomy the entire time, but it refused to rain.As he sat in the car, Yue Zhishi closed his eyes to rest. He kept remembering how Lin Rong had looked as she hugged him, reluctant for him to leave. The trunk was stuffed full of the pastries and snacks she\u2019d made; she\u2019d given them so much he didn\u2019t know just how long she\u2019d spent in the kitchen to make them all.He was wearing the knit sweater Lin Rong had made, and placed on his legs was the book Song Jin had bought for him. He\u2019d grown up surrounded with love and freedom \u2014 an extremely safe and stable life was laid out for him to take, and yet he wilfully, stubbornly persisted in heading towards a dead end.On a certain level, he truly was similar to his father.After returning to campus, they didn\u2019t go back to their dorms. Song Yu needed to leave early the next day, so for the first time, he asked for Yue Zhishi to stay \u2014 even though the way he asked remained a vague question.\u201cDo you want to stay overnight at the apartment?\u201dYue Zhishi naturally agreed, and when Song Yu added an extra \u2018we won\u2019t do anything\u2019, he even said to him, \u201cYou can do anything you want.\u201dBut Song Yu really didn\u2019t do anything, and he sat by himself on the floor in their room, mounting a projector, as Yue Zhishi showered. He was very different from a few years ago, when he\u2019d ruthlessly driven Yue Zhishi out of his room. Now, he could have Yue Zhishi leaning against his shoulder and very peacefully stay with him, accompanying him as they watched an anime movie Yue Zhishi liked.Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes were bright, and he earnestly focused on the projection screen. He was like an adorable little animal; whenever there was an exciting moment, he would exuberantly kick his legs within the blanket and then lift his head, wrapping himself around Song Yu\u2019s neck to give his cheek a kiss.They often didn\u2019t need to speak \u2014 just with one simple movement, they would be able to understand what the other person was thinking. Yue Zhishi squirmed against Song Yu\u2019s neck, and Song Yu knew he was sleepy. He took away some of the pillows piled behind Yue Zhishi and told him to lie down.Yue Zhishi fell asleep after desperately fighting to stay awake for the final after-credit scene. Song Yu embraced him from the back, and he gently kissed Yue Zhishi\u2019s fair nape. His hands held onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s arms, and he wrapped him entirely, tightly, into his arms. He was like a safe and warm protective shield, and he was also like a machine falling dormant after connecting to a power supply.They were each other\u2019s solace, and each other\u2019s protection.Most likely because he subconsciously remembered Song Yu needed to leave very early, Yue Zhishi woke before the sky had even started to brighten. Usually fond of sleeping in when next to Song Yu\u2019s side, Yue Zhishi fuzzily moved a hand around, and after realising Song Yu was still next to him, still asleep behind his back, his heart steadied. He got up as quietly and gently as he could, and he copied what Song Yu had done before, stuffing a pillow into his arms to pretend it was him. He then ran downstairs to clean up and to make a simple breakfast.There were only eggs, bacon and rice toast in the kitchen, but he found a bottle of mustard. The ingredients didn\u2019t taste too bad after being put together, and he felt like Song Yu would like it.Song Yu\u2019s footsteps were a bit hurried as he came down, pausing halfway down the stairs when he saw Yue Zhishi coming out of the kitchen with two plates. His steps only then recovered back to their usual slow and leisurely pace.\u201cThe things I make won\u2019t be really delicious.\u201d Yue Zhishi took the chance to lower Song Yu\u2019s expectations. \u201cDon\u2019t be picky, and don\u2019t tell me if it\u2019s not nice.\u201dSong Yu took a bite and then looked at Yue Zhishi who seemed to not care about how it tasted. \u201cIt\u2019s tasty.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Yue Zhishi tried the sandwich he\u2019d personally made. \u201cIt seems okay.\u201dHe felt like Song Yu\u2019s requirements for him always seemed very low. His ability to tolerate him seemed very high, and his attitude towards him seemed extremely mild. He\u2019d only just realised these things now, but after carefully combing through his memories, he realised Song Yu had been like this towards him since a very long time ago.Song Yu left with his previously prepared luggage before 8am. He left in a great hurry, and Yue Zhishi took the elevator down with him, still in his pyjamas and slippers. Without any hesitation, Song Yu kissed his forehead in the elevator and told him to continue sleeping after heading back up since he didn\u2019t have class that morning anyway.The elevator doors slid open, and the cold wind directly slithered itself around Yue Zhishi\u2019s neck and ankles. His eyes followed Song Yu as he entered the car park, gazing at his receding figure. Yue Zhishi was so cold his entire body was numb, and he shuddered.\u201cSong Yu,\u201d he called out, very loudly. He watched as Song Yu turned around, and he initially wanted to run over \u2014 but Song Yu headed back towards with him with large strides until he arrived in front of Yue Zhishi.Yue Zhishi dived into Song Yu\u2019s coat very docilely and wrapped his arms around his waist. \u201cYou have to be careful. Remember to bring me a present, and don\u2019t get sick.\u201dSong Yu nodded. Since there was no one around them, Yue Zhishi rose onto his tiptoes and kissed his chin. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m not that sad anymore.\u201dHe knew Song Yu had been really worried about him over the last two days at home. It was why he hadn\u2019t stayed in his room by himself like he used to, and instead, had stayed with him in the living room and had stayed with him to do many things. Song Yu\u2019s care was silent, without sound \u2014 it flowed like still water, smoothly and deeply.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Song Yu caressed his face.Yue Zhishi shook his head, a firm look in his eyes. \u201cWhenever I think about how you\u2019ve passed so many years like this, I feel so distressed. My heart hurts so much it doesn\u2019t even have room to be afraid.\u201d Very straightforwardly, very honestly, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be worried about me leaving you because I\u2019m afraid either \u2014 I won\u2019t do that. The days where you struggled by yourself won\u2019t come back again.\u201d\u201cDo you remember my fortune stick?\u201d Yue Zhishi tilted his head.Song Yu gave him a very faint smile. \u201cLet nature run its course.\u201dThat fortune was actually his.\u201cYes. We\u2019ll face the future together.\u201dWorried he\u2019d be late, Yue Zhishi retreated from Song Yu\u2019s arms and urged him to leave. But at the very last moment, Song Yu said, \u201cCall me again.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t understand. \u201cSong Yu?\u201d\u201cCall me gege.\u201d Song Yu raised an eyebrow.For some inexplicable reason, Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart sped up. He was all too familiar with those two words, but being asked to say them at this very moment \u2014 there were a very subtle feeling added to those words.\u201cGege\u2026\u201d he said softly, head lowered.Song Yu took ahold of his waist, the buckle on his belt pushing against Yue Zhishi\u2019s lower belly. Their chests pressed together, and Song Yu rewarded him with a kiss full of possessiveness and yearning, as well as rough breathing, damp and hot.\u201cBe good and wait for me to come back.\u201dYue Zhishi blankly stood there for a while, his eyes chasing after Song Yu as he drove out and lingering all the way until he couldn\u2019t see his car anymore. After going back up into the apartment, he couldn\u2019t fall back asleep at all \u2014 so, like a qualified partner in love, he cleaned up the entire place for Song Yu before Nan Jia notified him of a meeting. He then changed his clothes and went to campus.Because of Nan Jia\u2019s help, the law school moved very quickly this year. It announced who passed the preliminary round very early and called up all of the students who would be representing the school in the competition for a meeting. It was very obvious the school hoped for a decent performance this time in order to wipe away its previous history.Even though he\u2019d known in advance that he\u2019d passed the preliminary round, Yue Zhishi was still a bit nervous and excited when he finally arrived at the meeting. He was the last one to arrive, and as expected, the girl who wore a hanfu last time was also present. The two of them greeted each other, and Yue Zhishi noticed she was a particularly introverted lady \u2014 he needed to ask twice before he could clearly hear her name. She was called Xiao Qi.\u201cI\u2019m Yue Zhishi.\u201d He hadn\u2019t said much else before Xiao Qi nodded and said, \u201cI know, you\u2019re quite famous.\u201dThat was strange for Yue Zhishi, because he wasn\u2019t the type of person to have hordes of friends. The other three contestants were also there: one was a girl with short, dusty blue hair in a leather jacket. She was taller than Nan Jia, and she\u2019d come in carrying a black skateboard. She introduced herself with a simple, \u201cI\u2019m Qu Zhi.\u201dThere were two other guys. One was tall and sturdy with a very weak voice, and he seemed to always speak mournfully. His name was very interesting and was as sad as his person \u2014 he was called Zhou Yi. The final contestant was very skinny, and he wore a large orange hoodie that didn\u2019t fit him. \u201cI\u2019m Chen Bi, but everyone calls me Chen Pi.\u201d He chewed on some gum, and as soon as he arrived, he started to praise and flirt with senior Nan Jia.Nan Jia told them to sit down, introducing the arts festival\u2019s clothing design competition rules with another senior sister. \u201cThis year\u2019s event has been slightly changed. Each school\u2019s team has five people. You\u2019ve already met everyone in our team. We\u2019ll been given a relatively long time on the runway, so we\u2019ll need to make actual clothes for our models. We have a pretty long period of time to make those clothes, so there\u2019ll only be one round of competition. Everyone only needs to design one set of clothes for one theme.\u201dThat very cool-looking girl raised her hand. \u201cSenior, will the theme be assigned to us?\u201dNan Jia nodded. \u201cBut not every school will have the same theme. The organisers have drafted up different themes this year, one for each school, and we\u2019ll be given our theme through random lottery.\u201dYue Zhishi frowned. \u201cSo this competition also requires a bit of luck?\u201d\u201cSomething like that. There are definitely going to be both easy and difficult themes to design to.\u201d Nan Jia shrugged. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing we can do about that, some themes are naturally going to be a bit more eye-catching.\u201dThe other senior sister added, \u201cEach theme requires three rounds during the actual runway show. We\u2019ll need everyone to design three sets of clothes, and the designs should have as much creative structure and organisation behind it as possible. It\u2019ll be easier to get high scores that way.\u201dFellow student Zhou Yi sighed, looking very mournful. He sat on his chair like an immovable mountain and said, \u201cBut our school\u2019s not very good at this kind of thing. We only used to get participation awards.\u201dOn the other hand, Chen Pi was quite optimistic as he continued chewing his gum, and he looked more like an experienced competitor than Zhou Yi. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine, we\u2019re mainly here just to stir up the water a bit, right, senior?\u201dNan Jia opened her mouth, but before she could speak, cool girl Qu Zhi spoke first. \u201cIf you want to stir up water, why didn\u2019t you go participate in the rowing competition?\u201dXiao Qi had kept silent the entire time, and she was nervously twisting her fingers together. Yue Zhishi saw that she\u2019d wanted to raise her hand a few times before weakly lowering it back down, so he asked her, \u201cXiao Qi, do you have something you want to ask?\u201dEveryone\u2019s gaze gathered onto Xiao Qi\u2019s thin and frail body, and they only saw her nervously swallow, eyes flickering around. Finally, she looked at Nan Jia. \u201cI\u2026 I want to go to the bathroom.\u201d\u201cAy.\u201d Chen Pi flopped back onto his desk.As the meeting went on, things didn\u2019t go quite as smoothly as Nan Jia had hoped. She was slightly anxious, so when the meeting finished, she stayed at the podium and gathered up all the papers and information she\u2019d placed there. \u201cLe Le, do you have something to do later? Come with me to the university hospital?\u201dYue Zhishi immediately felt worried, and he stood up from his seat. Before he could speak, he saw that girl called Qu Zhi walk up to the front with her skateboard. \u201cSenior, are you not feeling well?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d Nan Jia smiled, putting her papers into her bag. \u201cJust a light flu.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Pulling on his bag, Yue Zhishi prepared to head to the hospital with her. The tip of his tongue had been slightly torn a few days ago, but he hadn\u2019t really felt it; he\u2019d thought only his lip had been split. He\u2019d only realised Song Yu had used a bit too much force last time when he felt an ulcer stinging.\u201cI want to grab some medicine too.\u201d He stood behind them and stuck out the tip of his tongue. He took a photo of it with his phone and magnified it, looking at that tiny white ulcer on his tongue. Then, in the spirit of criticism and reproach, he pulled up WeChat and sent the photo to Song Yu.[Le Le: Look.]Qu Zhi was standing at the podium, and she took out her phone. \u201cSenior, can I add your WeChat?\u201dNaturally, Nan Jia didn\u2019t refuse and also pulled out her phone. \u201cSure.\u201d She opened her WeChat, giving the QR code for Qu Zhi to scan.\u201cYour skateboard\u2019s so cool.\u201d Nan Jia lowered her head to look at the skateboard on the floor. There was a line of words printed at the top, and it looked like Spanish. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to learn how to skate, but I\u2019m a bit scared.\u201d\u201cI can teach you.\u201d Qu Zhi shook her phone. \u201cI\u2019ve added you, so you can look for me any time you want to learn.\u201dThe three of them prepared to leave, and Qu Zhi stepped on one end of the skateboard, the board flipping up. She nimbly caught it with a hand and followed them downstairs. Once they exited the building, she got onto the skateboard, looking entirely like she was about to leave.\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d Yue Zhishi waved a hand at her in goodbye, and she gave him a grin before looking at Nan Jia.She said, \u201cYou can also look for me if you want someone to go with you to the doctor.\u201dNan Jia laughed very cheerfully. \u201cWill you take me there with a skateboard?\u201dQu Zhi also laughed. \u201cWhat about something with an engine? Certificate included.\u201dShe skated away once she finished speaking, her silhouette very fearless. Yue Zhishi watched Qu Zhi\u2019s figure for a little while, head tilted to the side, and then glanced at Nan Jia. He blinked twice. \u201cThere\u2019s something I don\u2019t know if I should say.\u201dRidiculously amused, Nan Jia rushed to speak first. \u201cI also have something to say. You should cut your hair.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look nice like this?\u201d Yue Zhishi grabbed some of his hair. \u201cThey all say I look more like I\u2019m mixed when my hair\u2019s longer.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean like you\u2019re mixed \u2014 you\u2019re mixed to begin with.\u201d Nan Jia covered her face with a mask from her bag and sighed at Yue Zhishi. Maybe it was because she was sick, but for the first time, she exposed some weariness in front of Yue Zhishi. She usually looked like a superwoman. \u201cWhat should we do? I feel like the competition\u2019s not going to be any good this year. Other than you with your good personality and ability, the rest of our team seem to be indifferent, not quite right or hard to work with.\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201d Yue Zhishi had an extremely positive mindset. \u201cSenior, I think this team of ours might actually end up doing fairly well.\u201dNan Jia smiled. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause we\u2019re very similar.\u201d Placing his two hands into his hoodie\u2019s pocket, Yue Zhishi gazed at the golden fallen leaves.\u201cOne mournful, one mischievous. One small loli girl who looks so frail she wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the wind, and one very modern, very unconventional cool girl. Once you add me in, our team is pretty much like one of those dark horse teams in manga \u2014 the ones that have other people looking down at them in the beginning before slapping their faces later. We\u2019re very much that classic example.\u201dWith an extremely carefree and confident look on his face, he patted Nan Jia\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. Trust me.\u201dNan Jia looked at his eyes, focusing on them for a good while, and then she finally shook her head. \u201cI understand now.\u201d\u201cUnderstand what?\u201d\u201cWhy everyone likes you.\u201d Nan Jia\u2019s eyes were like curved moons. \u201cThen I\u2019ll trust you. No problems, right?\u201dYue Zhishi smiled as brightly as the shining sun. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Akagi Haruko-chan.\u201dHis cellphone vibrated \u2014 Song Yu\u2019s reply.[Gege: Is this one of your seduction tactics?]The author has something to say:Song\u2013king of fantasising things with his brain\u2013LSP\u2013YuPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 71: Already TakenEven Yue Zhishi would feel a bit annoyed if he had been misunderstood under normal circumstances.But when it was Song Yu who\u2019d misunderstood him, he was more likely to feel something else \u2014 like his heart speeding up. Trying to explain, he sent Song Yu messages as he continued walking, and Nan Jia had to steer him around with his elbow in her hand, worried he\u2019d bump into someone.[Le Le: That\u2019s the wonderful thing you\u2019ve done. Both my lips and tongue are injured. My lips have scabbed over, but the wound on my tongue has turned into an ulcer.]After two seconds, he sent over another message.[Le Le: It really hurts.]He felt like he may have explained overly seriously, to the point where Song Yu didn\u2019t reply and only gave him a call straightaway. Yue Zhishi was in the doctor\u2019s consultation room with Nan Jia, and so he needed to leave, picking up Song Yu\u2019s phone call in the busy corridor.Hearing Song Yu\u2019s voice, Yue Zhishi completely forgot about how Song Yu had misunderstood him. Song Yu asked him if his tongue really hurt; he said it didn\u2019t, as though he hadn\u2019t actually sent through that message just then at all.\u201cIs it really cold where you are?\u201d Yue Zhishi was talking on the phone while facing the wall, looking like he had been forced to stand there in punishment.\u201cMn.\u201d\u201cThen make sure you don\u2019t get sick. Senior Nan Jia\u2019s already gotten sick.\u201d Yue Zhishi lay his forehead against the wall. \u201cThere\u2019s heaps of people at the hospital.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re with her at the hospital?\u201d The tone of Song Yu\u2019s voice shifted very distinctively.Yue Zhishi nodded, his head still facing the wall. \u201cYes. We just finished a meeting together, and I needed to get some medicine for my mouth ulcer anyway. I don\u2019t like going to the hospital by myself. It\u2019s like eating hotpot alone \u2014 it feels too pitiful.\u201d\u201cDoes it?\u201d Song Yu seemed to release an extremely obvious and extremely abrupt sigh at the phone, but Yue Zhishi was like a little dog, keenly catching notice of it. Before he could ask, Song Yu spoke again, his words now not quite matching up with what they were talking about before. \u201cThe people who welcomed us just said it\u2019ll be very cold here at night.\u201dYue Zhishi frowned. \u201cDoesn\u2019t the northwest region have central heating? Why won\u2019t they turn it on for you?\u201d\u201cNot everyone has central heating yet.\u201d Song Yu then said, on purpose, \u201cHopefully the blankets are thicker.\u201d That kind of wishful words sounded extraordinarily out of place coming out of his mouth.With just a few simple sentences, Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart was stirred up \u2014 he very nervously asked a whole bunch of questions, worrying about this and worrying about that. If someone didn\u2019t know what was happening, they might think Song Yu\u2019d gotten some kind of incurable disease.\u201cYou can pour some hot water into a glass bottle and then leave it under your blankets. You\u2019ll be a lot warmer like that but make sure you don\u2019t burn yourself. Ah, wait, you can\u2019t casually pour hot water into glass bottles, they can shatter really easily and hurt you. Plastic water bottles will warp, but maybe you should buy one\u2026\u201dSong Yu softly chuckled, and Yue Zhishi suddenly froze. He found himself really ridiculous \u2014 Song Yu was clearly someone so independent, and yet he was giving him advice like an elder on how to keep warm.\u201cAre you laughing at me?\u201d Yue Zhishi stared at his feet.\u201cI\u2019m missing you,\u201d Song Yu honestly said. It came out cleanly and straightforwardly, compared to\u00a0 how he\u2019d gone in circular and winding paths earlier just to beg for Yue Zhishi\u2019s care.\u201cYour body temperature seems to be a bit higher than mine,\u201d Song Yu continued to say, as though the previous hypothetical scenario were real. \u201cIf I slept with you in my bed at night, then you might be even more useful than a hot water bottle or a heating pad.\u201d\u201cI think the word \u2018useful\u2019 is too pragmatic, senior Song Yu.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice sounded slightly dissatisfied \u2014 he even changed the way he called Song Yu.\u201cThen let me change it.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s low and deep voice wasn\u2019t cool and indifferent; it carried a faint, seemingly nonexistent amusement. \u201cJunior brother, I want to sleep with you in my arms.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s ears suddenly felt a bit warm. He didn\u2019t know why, but even the innocent greetings of \u2018senior\u2019 and \u2018junior brother\u2019 could make him blush \u2014 even though it was him who said it first.He was quiet for a few seconds, and Song Yu was also very peaceful on his side of the phone. Nan Jia came out from the consultation room, lightly closing the door. Yue Zhishi rapidly said he needed to hang up now, remember to eat and sleep early.But Song Yu seemed to drag things out on purpose, continuing to speak; he was just like a cat who kept batting at him with its paws because it wasn\u2019t willing to let its owner play games.\u201cWhat should I do if I can\u2019t fall asleep?\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t sleep\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi met Nan Jia\u2019s eyes as soon as he raised his head. She seemed to be smiling at him, teasing, and it made him clutch the ends of his hair in some embarrassment.\u201cYou can call me if you can\u2019t sleep.\u201d He lowered the volume of his voice and whispered three words:\u00a0I\u2019ll coax you.Only then did Song Yu stop his little prank. \u201cMn. Go, then.\u201dAfter releasing its paws, the cat haughtily turned away, waving its tail slowly and leisurely.Delicately tutting, Nan Jia came over once Yue Zhishi hung up his phone. Her face was covered by a mask, and with her hands behind her back, she leaned in closely and intentionally asked, \u201cWho are you coaxing?\u201dYue Zhishi guiltily shoved his phone into his pocket and pulled up the hood on his sweatshirt. \u201c\u2026my cat.\u201dNan Jia nodded in deep, meaningful understanding. \u201cSo you\u2019re owned by a cat.\u201d She patted Yue Zhishi\u2019s back and emotionally sighed, \u201cLife is truly difficult. You\u2019re so young, yet you\u2019re already taken.\u201dYue Zhishi also pulled up the zipper for his outer jacket in one motion and took Nan Jia\u2019s arm, tugging her downstairs. \u201cLet\u2019s go get our medicine, senior.\u201d\u2013The competition was truly not as simple as they\u2019d thought.Other than the time he spent in class and finishing his homework, Yue Zhishi spent his days cramming all the knowledge he could find about clothing design. This might be a one-time activity a lot of people thought was important to participate in, but Yue Zhishi still very much wanted to complete it well \u2014 even though some other people thought it was a large waste of time.They all gathered together again for a meeting at midday Wednesday. This time, Nan Jia told them all the news she\u2019d managed to collect. One piece of news was that the number of models needed for this year\u2019s competition was around thirty to fifty, and the models must come from their university and could not be hired professional models. Another news was that their designed clothing could be made through the help of factories.Both those news were not beneficial to them. If models were required to be their fellow students, then that meant they needed to fight over students with good looks. If they were allowed to use external methods, then that meant Xu Lin from the journalism and communications school would have a special advantage.And then the worst piece of news: one of the judges invited to the finals was a classmate of Xu Lin\u2019s mother, and they had a particularly close relationship.\u201cI feel like we\u2019re the cannon fodder for all the cannon fodders.\u201d After finishing their meeting, the team decided to eat lunch together. Zhou Yi was moving slowly through the packed crowds with his tray of food. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if we\u2019ll be able to scrape up a model from somewhere.\u201dChen Pi took a sip of the hot soy milk he\u2019d just bought and sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ll just lower our standards a bit. If other people are looking for someone 180cm tall, then we\u2019ll look for someone 175cm. Right, senior sister.\u201dNan Jia had only ordered a bowl of porridge, her appetite not too well. She brought them around until they found an empty long table and said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. You guys don\u2019t need to worry about the models, I\u2019m the manager for the basketball team. There are plenty of long arms and long legs in there.\u201d\u201cWow.\u201d Chen Pi said in quite an exaggerated manner, \u201cBeing the basketball team\u2019s manager is too cool. I watched Slam Dunk when I was a kid, and I loved Akagi Haruko. Senior, there definitely must be a bunch of people in the team chasing after you, right?\u201dYue Zhishi had just put a piece of watermelon into his mouth, and with his cheek bulging out, he cut in and said, \u201cNot just the basketball team\u2026\u201dQu Zhi suddenly opened her mouth, having kept silent the entire time. She said, \u201cSo senior is currently single and can be pursued.\u201dHer short dusty blue hair was tied up into a simple little ponytail behind her head, and she wore a black baseball cap, the shadow from the brim making the look in her eyes appear even deeper.\u201cYeah.\u201d Nodding, Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t really notice much other meaning to her words and very innocently said something rather cold-hearted. \u201cShe\u2019s so single she needed me to go with her to the doctor.\u201dNan Jia twisted her head over and glared at Yue Zhishi. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t actually want to go with me?\u201d And then after a while, she intentionally put on a look of dawning understanding. \u201cAh, that\u2019s right, since I\u2019m not as cute as a cat.\u201dYue Zhishi almost choked on his watermelon and coughed for a long time.Xiao Qi, who\u2019d been very quiet, stared at Yue Zhishi and Nan Jia with wide eyes. She bit the ends of her chopsticks and abruptly said in a soft voice, \u201cSo you guys don\u2019t have that kind of relationship.\u201dNan Jia broke into laughter. \u201cNo, we\u2019re like brother and sister.\u201dEveryone ate while they continued to chat, but Nan Jia didn\u2019t really eat much of her porridge. Yue Zhishi asked if she wanted to have some of his food; Nan Jia said she wanted to have some hot soup and got up, preparing to go buy some. Qu Zhi, who was sitting across from them, stood up faster. \u201cI\u2019ll go. Is soup with rice noodles okay?\u201d She grabbed the meal card on the table. Yue Zhishi saw that her fingers were very long, skin very pale; her nails were cut very short and looked very clean.\u201cAh, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Nan Jia didn\u2019t really want to bother her. \u201cMaybe I should go myself.\u201d\u201cYou need to rest more if you\u2019re sick.\u201d Qu Zhi stepped over the bench behind her in one smooth move. Her eyes were very beautiful, and her features were bold and fearless. She didn\u2019t have much expressions on her face as she talked, but from beginning to end, she gazed at Nan Jia\u2019s face. \u201cAnything you don\u2019t eat?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Nan Jia was also looking at her.Yue Zhishi felt like he sensed something \u2014 something very profound.Qu Zhi had just strode away when the sound of very exaggerated laughter drifted to them from not too far away. It was getting closer, and as soon as Yue Zhishi looked up, he actually saw Xu Lin from the journalism school.He was still the same as the first time Yue Zhishi saw him, surrounded and escorted by a crowd of people like he was the bright moon circled by a bunch of lesser stars. He wasn\u2019t wearing that ridiculous pair of orange glasses this time, but he wore an extremely conspicuous, red\u00a0duijin\u00a0jacket. His hair was also styled with particular care. Xu Lin saw Yue Zhishi immediately, and then he walked over in his direction with his admirers.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the guy from the journalism school?\u201d Chen Pi glanced at him with his eyes squinted together. \u201cAnyone know him?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve met.\u201d Yue Zhishi had just finished speaking when Xu Lin sat down at their long table.\u201cHi, Mixed Sweetheart,\u201d Xu Lin flamboyantly greeted Yue Zhishi, his two hands in his pockets. \u201cI especially went to look at your school\u2019s list of contestants. Not bad, you actually managed to get in.\u201dThe tone of his voice didn\u2019t sound all that sincere, but to someone like Yue Zhishi who had a high threshold for people, it wasn\u2019t really that annoying. Which is why he very casually nodded and said, \u201cYup. What about you?\u201dIt was like his counter question instantaneously stabbed right into Xu Lin\u2019s lungs. \u201cWait, is there something wrong with you? You\u2019re actually asking\u00a0me?\u201dThe people behind him also released laughter filled with disbelief.\u201cThat was nothing more than a question asked out of courtesy.\u201d Yue Zhishi gave him a very good-looking smile and stretched out a very friendly hand to Xu Lin.Xu Lin was slightly confused by his movement, and he even shifted backwards. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThinking he was a bit stupid, Yue Zhishi took his hand and shook it with his own. \u201cThis is also courtesy. I\u2019m very happy to have become your opponent.\u201dXu Lin started to ponder whether Yue Zhishi was truly happy or whether he\u2019d said it out of courtesy once again. He felt like this person was super strange \u2014 what a waste of that beautiful face and great figure. He cleared his throat. \u201cYou better be happy.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t planning on eating there, so he stood back up, looking back down at Yue Zhishi with some pride. \u201cSince you\u2019re going to lose quite terribly.\u201dThe rest of the people sitting at that table wasn\u2019t happy at his words, but Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t really care \u2014 he felt like being stomped on was how the main character was usually treated.\u201cBut if you change your mind and want to be a model, I wouldn\u2019t mind if you came and begged me.\u201d Xu Lin looked in all four directions a bit stiffly, everywhere except in Yue Zhishi\u2019s direction. \u201cYou should be able to get my WeChat really easily if you ask around.\u201dYue Zhishi couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter.\u201cWhat are you laughing at!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re remarkably interesting.\u201d It took a lot of effort for Yue Zhishi to stop laughing. \u201cSeriously.\u201dXu Lin rushed away, almost knocking into Qu Zhi with her tray of food as soon as he turned around. Qu Zhi was wearing a pair of Doc Martens boots, and she was almost taller than him; she had a very strong aura around her.\u201cWhy is the law school using models as designers, how stupid,\u201d he cursed under his breath, leaving unhappily.Even though Xu Lin appeared very weird, every single person sitting there knew he was a strong opponent with both talent and resources. He could be called the major focus of attention for this year\u2019s competition. Zhou Yi continued to say sad and gloomy things, and he dragged Chen Pi down with him.\u201cI have a good feeling about this \u2014 everything will definitely go smoothly,\u201d Yue Zhishi said.But this time, his \u2018good feeling\u2019 failed again and again.The lottery drawing for the competition was announced for 6pm, and the announcement came about very spontaneously. The time clashed with an elective course for first year law students, and so they could only rush over during the class break. They arrived last, and only one draw remained. It was still technically a random draw, but it didn\u2019t feel very encouraging.Qu Zhi opened the envelope. Her face was calm, but she didn\u2019t look too happy.\u201cRain.\u201d She showed them the slip of paper.\u201cRain?\u201d Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know if this could be considered as a good theme or not. He actively went around, asking the other people in the classroom about what they\u2019d been given; intelligence gathering wasn\u2019t something pleasant to do to begin with, but they let Yue Zhishi see their themes fairly easily because it was him who asked.He learned that a school managed to draw \u2018ocean\u2019 while another had \u2018the future\u2019. And the journalism and communications school they were all afraid of \u2014 in a large stroke of luck, they drew \u2018millennium\u2019. It was an eye-catching theme that innately allowed for innovative designs.After learning of this particular piece of intelligence, their team sunk into an even lower creative state of mind. They even needed to return back to their grand auditorium for class now that they\u2019ve drawn their theme, with the class running until 9:30pm.It was already 11pm by the time he finished showering and cleaning up. Yue Zhishi sat at his desk and opened his laptop, attempting to record some inspiration. At least now that they had their theme, he had a general direction of where to turn his brain.As soon as the word \u2018rain\u2019 appeared in his mind, all the images he envisioned were particularly real: the rainy days he\u2019d gone through as a child while being piggybacked; the small store they\u2019d stayed in to hide from the rain; a transparent umbrella; the borrowed back he\u2019d depended on during thunderous rain. Almost all of them were related to Song Yu.Many, many emotions were born during the rain.And as luck would have it, his phone lit up with a special ringtone. Yue Zhishi opened his phone swiftly and saw a message sent from Song Yu.[Gege: I\u2019ve been outside the whole day today. Frozen stiff.]He sent over a photo of his hands, red from the cold.Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart squeezed. The people in his dorm were still playing games, so he immediately gave him a call.Song Yu\u2019s voice was still very steady, and he told Yue Zhishi he was already under his blankets \u2014 except he couldn\u2019t really fall asleep.\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi hesitated for around five seconds. \u201cI\u2019ll read a book to you.\u201dSong Yu hummed in agreement and then said, \u201cIf it\u2019s criminal legislation, then forget about it.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t recite that stuff.\u201d Yue Zhishi searched through the books on his table with his eyes and felt like there wasn\u2019t anything suitable. He then abruptly remembered \u2014 he crouched down and pulled out a box of stuff he\u2019d packed and brought over that day he\u2019d returned home for his birthday. He searched through the things inside and slid out an old-looking book, yellowed anime stickers plastered all over its cover.He hugged the small book to his chest somewhat self-consciously as he left his dorm, and he crouched down again once he reached the end of his floor. Turning on his phone torch, he aimed it at the diary. Very few people walked through here, and there was no dorm room across from him \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t disturb anyone.Wind came from a hole somewhere, chilling Yue Zhishi\u2019s ankles, but he felt like this kind of temperature was nothing compared to the hardship Song Yu was currently going through.\u201cWhat are you going to read?\u201d Song Yu asked again.\u201cMy diary.\u201d Yue Zhishi flipped open a page and wasn\u2019t too happy when he realised there wasn\u2019t much of a reaction from the other end of the phone. \u201cAren\u2019t you excited? I brought this from home specifically in order to fulfil your request. It\u2019s from third year of elementary school. The diary\u2019s finally useful.\u201dSong Yu laughed. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just a bit surprised.\u201dHow could he have thought Yue Zhishi would\u2019ve taken his request so seriously.Clearing his throat, Yue Zhishi randomly chose a short passage and read it out. \u201cSeptember 12th, rainy. Today I ate a chocolate ice cream. A classmate bought it for me, but gege said I can\u2019t casually eat things other people give me. So I was very scared when I ate it.\u201dHe himself wanted to laugh as he read it, but he held himself back and continued, \u201cAfter I finished sneakily eating it, I waited outside gege\u2019s classroom for him to finish school. But he was unhappy as soon as he saw me and asked me what I ate. How did he know? I only found out after I got home and looked at myself in the mirror. There was chocolate all over my face.\u201dSong Yu chuckled and said, his voice very tender, \u201cToo dumb.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t use your current brain to laugh at a little third year student,\u201d Yue Zhishi solemnly refuted for himself. \u201cThird years don\u2019t understand anything, okay?\u201dHe turned to the next page. The entry was very short, only two lines. Without thinking about it, he recited the opening, \u201cSeptember 13th, sunny\u2026\u201dSong Yu patiently waited for a few seconds after Yue Zhishi abruptly stopped talking. When there was still nothing coming, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cAnd then\u2014\u201d Yue Zhishi stared at the row of characters written in a crooked, childish scrawl. He straightened himself and honestly said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say.\u201d\u201cDo you want me to stay awake the whole night?\u201d Song Yu asked.\u201cAll right.\u201d Yue Zhishi yielded rather unwillingly, and there was a touch of sulkiness in his voice, utterly matching the words he read out.\u201cWhy does everyone in television dramas have a girlfriend? Gege can\u2019t have a girlfriend. Can\u2019t gege like only me?\u201dAfter those words left his mouth, he let out an \u2018ah\u2019 and buried his face into his lap in despair. All of the lights in the corridor were now on.Song Yu lightly laughed; his voice was low and deep, and yet it sounded like it was floating. \u201cThird year prophet, I can.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 72: To Fall Sick from YearningAfter being given their theme, the law school\u2019s design team came together many times to discuss ideas.They pulled together numerous photos that had to do with rain, as well as any related designs and runway shows in the fashion industry. Chen Pi was a particularly attentive and careful person despite all his talk of \u2018stirring up water\u2019 \u2014 he secretly inquired about all the possible judges who could appear and looked up their previous works in order to examine their preferences.\u201cI\u2019ve organised all of our previous inspiration and rough drafts into this little booklet.\u201d Xiao Qi walked over meekly and gave everyone a small book.Yue Zhishi was currently immersed in his thoughts, but he still shot her an appreciative smile as soon as he saw what she was giving him. \u201cYou\u2019re awesome.\u201dEven though Xiao Qi still spoke softly and weakly, she did things more confidently after being encouraged.\u201cI feel like our designs need to lean towards the soft, graceful style. A bit more \u2018celestial heavenly being\u2019.\u201d Zhou Yi shuffled the sketches he had next to him. \u201cYup. Since whenever I think of rain, I always think of the misty, smoky rain in the area south of the Yangtze River.\u201d\u201cThat style\u2019s too outdated now.\u201d Qu Zhi expressed her opinion very straightforwardly. \u201cIf we design to that style, then we\u2019ll bump into the team with the \u2018Chinese traditional wear\u2019 theme.\u201dZhou Yi gloomily said, okay. Xiao Qi then cautiously raised her hand. \u201cThen, what about if we start from fabrics?\u201d\u201cFabrics? Stuff like polyester and nylon?\u201d Chen Pi asked, twirling a pen.Xiao Qi very rapidly sketched a rough design on her drawing paper and showed it to them. It was a long dress, and the bustle was replaced with the\u00a0Chinese pavilions\u00a0usually drawn on ancient Chinese umbrellas. \u201cFor example, we could use oilskin or a similar fabric on the dress as an embellishment\u2026\u201dQu Zhi nodded. \u201cWe could also use nylon or transparent plastic materials to design a raincoat-like suit. It should look pretty fashionable.\u201d\u201cBut if we do that\u2026\u201d Nan Jia pulled out a tiny query. \u201cWouldn\u2019t our theme diverge from rain to umbrella? And I still can\u2019t see a clear structure to our designs. I feel like all of the ideas everyone\u2019s been giving out \u2014 like using the fabric and structure of umbrellas, the colour and texture of rainwater or people\u2019s psychological feelings during the rain \u2014 all of those ideas lean more towards our final presentation of our collection.\u201dZhou Yi scratched his head as well. \u201cThere\u2019s no thread running through them. The ideas are all very scattered around.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Nan Jia pointed out something rather important. \u201cIf the fashion show requires three rounds, then there should be at least three different secondary concepts linked to our main theme. Or else we\u2019ll be really disadvantaged during the actual show.\u201d\u201cOur theme doesn\u2019t have an exact scope to it like the \u2018millennium\u2019 or \u2018Chinese traditional wear\u2019 themes anyway. It\u2019ll be really hard to have a concept for each of the three rounds in our collection.\u201d Releasing a very loud sigh, Chen Pi found their theme more and more troublesome. \u201cAh, I\u2019m so annoyed. Let\u2019s just destroy everything.\u201dYue Zhishi was focused on flipping through that the little booklet, and he stood out for being so quiet during the discussion. He stared at some of the sketches they\u2019d drawn before, and realised both Xiao Qi and Zhou Yi\u2019s designs tended to be rather traditional, presenting the lasting appeal of Chinese culture; their works had elements from water sleeves,\u00a0oiled-paper umbrellas\u00a0and bamboo hats. Chen Pi and Qu Zhi\u2019s works were clearly modern \u2014 perhaps even postmodern \u2014 with their nylon fabrics and elements made out of transparent plastic materials. Qu Zhi was especially so; a large majority of her designs were grey or black, and they were combined with bright, highly contrasted fluorescent green, blue and red colours. Her style was clear and distinctive.\u201cWere you designing to a cyberpunk aesthetic?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked Qu Zhi, holding her sketches.Qu Zhi nodded. \u201cI felt like there was never-ending rain in cyberpunk works, and the rain would always be dark, heavy drizzle.\u201d She then looked at the designs in front of Yue Zhishi \u2014 they were all very disconnected. \u201cIs it hard to integrate everything together? I feel like everyone\u2019s design preferences are too different.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just directly let everyone design to their own styles,\u201d Chen Pi suggested. \u201cLike Qu Zhi can do a cyberpunk set and Xiao Qi can make a gentle, traditional set with Zhou Yi. And then we can just design the last set with something else.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too casual,\u201d Zhou Yi said, his voice low and very soft.\u201cI think so too, but if we really can\u2019t link everything together, then we might as well separate them into three sections. It\u2019ll be fine if there\u2019s some connection among them.\u201dYue Zhishi was reclining on top of his desk, listening to everyone with his eyes closed. The word \u2018rain\u2019 was brought up again and again, and it brought forth his memories again and again, from three years old to nineteen \u2014 from the past to now.Past, present.\u201cWait.\u201d Opening his eyes, Yue Zhishi raised his head, his light-coloured pupils shining under the lights. \u201cI have an idea.\u201dHe stood up as he talked, circling out of his desk to the whiteboard, and stuck everyone\u2019s disorderly rough drafts onto the board with magnets \u2014 from Zhou Yi\u2019s water sleeves and\u00a0straw rain capes\u00a0to Xiao Qi\u2019s bamboo pavilion umbrella dress, his and Chen Pi\u2019s modern style drawings and finally, Qu Zhi\u2019s postmodern cyberpunk.\u201cIsn\u2019t this actually a continuous timeline?\u201d Yue Zhishi turned his face towards the group. \u201cRain runs through all times. To say it differently \u2014 no matter how eras change and transform, rain will always fall.\u201d\u201cThe times of rain!\u201d Pleasant surprise covered Nan Jia\u2019s face. \u201cI think it\u2019s a pretty good idea to have time be the thread running through all these different design styles.\u201d She\u2019d even thought about what kind of background and music they could use during their show. \u201cIf we follow this order, we can use traditional Chinese instruments like\u00a0guzheng\u00a0and\u00a0dizi\u00a0in the beginning, and then transition to futuristic electronic music at the end.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s super cool.\u201d Qu Zhi agreed with her thoughts with a short sentence.Yue Zhishi continued on. \u201cIf we use \u2018time\u2019 in the first round, then in the second round, I think we can use \u2018space\u2019 as a parallel design concept.\u201dXiao Qi timidly asked, \u201cSpace as in different countries?\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t the scope be too narrow if we limit it to countries?\u201d Qu Zhi pressed down the end of her ballpoint pen. \u201cIf we\u2019re using \u2018space\u2019, then we should think larger, more widely.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded very quickly. \u201cYes, I just remembered that when rain falls in different places, it\u2019s never exactly the same.\u201d He tried describing it to everyone. \u201cIf rain falls on a lake, it\u2019ll show up as dotted, spreading ripples. If it falls on car windows, it\u2019ll turn into transparent lines. If it falls onto an umbrella, sometimes it\u2019ll condense into beads of water.\u201d\u201cClouds and lakes, the grasslands and leaf tips seeping with rainwater \u2014 rain will fall on all of them. We can utilise these different places to create rain\u2019s sense of space. We can combine this part with creative uses of fabric materials. If we can simulate \u2018space\u2019 with both our techniques and fabrics, then I think we\u2019ll be able to get extra points in terms of designing.\u201dHe initially didn\u2019t think much of it after saying everything in one go, but when Yue Zhishi realised everyone was staring at him, he was a bit embarrassed. He lifted a hand, ruffling his hair, and turned back to his usual goodnatured self. Very lightly, he released an \u2018ah\u2019 and said, \u201cThat\u2019s just some of my very immature thoughts.\u201dThe words had just left his mouth when Chen Pi started clapping his hands like a seal in an aquarium. \u201cFucking awesome!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not mature? Then my thoughts were in kindergarten,\u201d Zhou Yi forlornly said.Everyone broke into laughter.\u201cTime and space. Both of these focal points are impressive. As expected of you, Le Le, your idea during the preliminary round was also very unique.\u201d Nan Jia recorded down the notes. \u201cLeave the runway design to me \u2014 no matter if it\u2019s the music or the lighting, I\u2019ll do my best for you guys.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still the last round.\u201d After being cheerful for a few moments, a bit of mournfulness leaked out of Zhou Yi once again. \u201cThe first two concepts are both so good; there\u2019s going to be a lot of pressure on the third one.\u201dXiao Qi also slightly nodded. \u201cAnd, and it also needs to elevate the main theme\u2026 So hard, how are we meant to elevate \u2018rain\u2019?\u201dThat truly was something incredibly hard to do.The meeting was temporarily paused since everyone had compulsory classes in the afternoon. It was already a very difficult breakthrough to have confirmed the design concepts for two out of their three fashion show rounds \u2014 at least with those two concepts, a few people on their team could now start their initial drafts.Nan Jia was still sick despite taking some medicine. She even had a fever, but this time, Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t get the opportunity to go to the doctor with her; Qu Zhi went with her instead.But she didn\u2019t bring her motorcycle, and this left Yue Zhishi extremely disappointed \u2014 he\u2019d really wanted to see it.After attending an entire day\u2019s worth of classes, plus the design meeting during the lunch break period, Yue Zhishi felt like his entire body had been hollowed out. He knocked into a corner of the fire extinguisher box in the corridor very carelessly as he came out of his classroom, and his leg only started to ache once he was on Cherry Blossom Avenue.Looking out at this familiar road, he thought of that day he came to Wuhan U to visit Song Yu \u2014 he thought of that little koi fish he\u2019d accidentally stepped on and wondered if it\u2019d managed to return back to its pond.Yue Zhishi hoped it could rain heavily tonight, so that he could stand under it and be given some inspiration. But the rain never fell, and he started to miss Song Yu more as the day went on.Yue Zhishi had a poor appetite as he ate dinner in the cafeteria; he\u2019d only eaten half a bowl of plain porridge before he typed a message to Song Yu.[Le Le: I suggested a very decent idea, and everyone happily accepted it. Now we\u2019ve settled on the design concepts for the first two rounds, and we can now start the next step of our work!]Before he sent it out, he deleted the words \u2018very decent\u2019 and \u2018happily\u2019 \u2014 just so he wouldn\u2019t sound that proud of himself.He felt like he was like a little puppy waiting at home after his owner had left for work, wanting to show off everything he\u2019d done to his owner. If a little puppy could send messages, then it was highly likely to excitedly type out something along the lines of \u2018I ran around in circles three times today with a toy in my mouth\u2019 while wagging its tail.Song Yu was a good owner. He replied to Yue Zhishi very quickly, praising him for being\u00a0so amazing.It was clearly only two words, and yet Yue Zhishi was giddy from happiness. While his face was still warm, he sent over a \u2018missing you\u2019 sticker of a sad little doggy curled outside a window.[Le Le: Can you send me a photo of you?]He knew Song Yu didn\u2019t like to take photos of his face, so Yue Zhishi quickly and deliberately added an extra sentence.[Le Le: It\u2019s fine too even if it\u2019s not a picture of your face. Anything is fine, I just really miss you and want to see you.]After sending that message off, Yue Zhishi put his phone down onto the table, screen down, and started to feel a bit excited. He belatedly realised a girl at a table not too far away seemed to looking at him, so he lowered his head awkwardly and had another spoonful of porridge.His phone vibrated just as he was swallowing. Yue Zhishi eagerly turned on his phone \u2014 Song Yu really did send him a photo.Song Yu truly didn\u2019t take a photo of his face. Instead of the face Yue Zhishi longed to see, the photo sent over was of Song Yu\u2019s hand.In the photo, Song Yu\u2019s thumb was covered by a fair amount of dirt and was unclean. His long, well-defined fingers were resting on a fixed leg of some kind of instrument, his veins faintly sticking out and wrist bones prominent. It obviously was a static photo, but Yue Zhishi felt like he could almost see those muscles and bones rising and falling along with the tugging of his joints underneath that thin layer of skin.The one thing that wasn\u2019t quite the same as usual was that Song Yu\u2019s fingers were slightly wet, not too dry, and were covered by a layer of something shimmering, smooth and greasy looking. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know why, but as he stared and stared, a peculiar feeling surged in his heart.Song Yu sent through another message, explaining the instrument.[Gege: This is a surveyor\u2019s\u00a0level.]Yue Zhishi thought for a moment.[Le Le: What\u2019s on your hand?][Gege: I just applied some lubricant on a few instruments.][Gege: Hand\u2019s a bit dirty. Do I still have time to delete the photo?]Very quickly, Yue Zhishi typed [Don\u2019t delete it], his face slightly flushing.He felt like he was truly being really strange, sitting by himself at the cafeteria and having certain kinds of thoughts about a dirty hand. Having realised this, Yue Zhishi grabbed his unfinished porridge and left \u2014 downloading and saving that photo before doing so.The campus fell bit by bit into the dark fog of night, where people and their thoughts could slowly, gradually become hidden. After returning back to his dorm, Yue Zhishi took his drawing pens and the two sketchbooks Song Yu had previously bought for him and placed them into his schoolbag. And then, just in case, he also brought that diary he\u2019d yet to finish reading.\u201cWhere are you going so late?\u201d Jiang Yufan pushed open the door to their dorm, and just so happened to bump into Yue Zhishi as he was leaving. \u201cOvernight at an internet cafe again?\u201d\u201cMn\u2026 something like that.\u201dSong Yu had given Yue Zhishi the access card to the apartment very early on, telling him he could visit whenever he wanted, but Yue Zhishi had never gone by himself before. The road to the place had always felt quite short every time he sat in the passenger seat since he always arrived very quickly \u2014 but as he walked over, he realised: the journey was actually quite long, and the paths were somewhat winding and confusing. Yue Zhishi walked for almost twenty minutes with his GPS before he finally found the small neighbourhood and arrived at the apartment building.Alone, he swiped the card and entered the elevator. After opening the door to the apartment, Yue Zhishi had the slight misconception that Song Yu would suddenly appear and embrace him in the entrance hallway.There was always a very pleasant smell on Song Yu\u2019s body. It was like a warm cover that completely surrounded Yue Zhishi.So when Song Yu wasn\u2019t around, it was as though one of Yue Zhishi\u2019s outer layers had been peeled off \u2014 he felt alone, and very cold.He turned on the lights and went upstairs to take a hot shower. When he came out, dressed in a robe, Yue Zhishi opened the closet and saw his and Song Yu\u2019s two sets of pyjamas. He hesitated, and then took out Song Yu\u2019s set of black silk, facing the mirror as he pulled it onto his body.The silk was a bit chilly as it touched his skin; it was just like Song Yu\u2019s forever cold fingertips, and it loosely draped down his body. His and Song Yu\u2019s differently sized bodies meant the pyjamas looked strangely unsuited on him \u2014 it no longer looked like a set of pyjamas, but rather more like a large, black cloth used to shroud things. It moved by itself, restlessly sliding down and exposing most of Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulders before he tugged it back up.The buttonholes on these pyjamas were tiny, Yue Zhishi realised, and they made it very hard for him to fasten the buttons. So with his snow-white chest uncovered, he stood in front of the mirror and one by one, slowly, pushed the buttons into those holes \u2014 his fingers shifted downwards inch by inch, until the fastened up shirt completely veiled his lower belly.He suddenly had a thought \u2014 it could be very hard to undo this set of pyjamas if Song Yu was wearing them.His cellphone abruptly vibrated on the desk, the noise echoing, and interrupted Yue Zhishi\u2019s imagination. He walked over to look at it; it was Song Yu.Song Yu had actually sent a message an hour earlier, asking Yue Zhishi to also send him a photo, but Yue Zhishi had been busy packing up and hadn\u2019t replied.So Song Yu sent him another message.[Gege: You\u2019re being very unfair.]Yue Zhishi found Song Yu\u2019s serious side particularly adorable, and it made him think of feeding Orange and Cotton Candy. If he gave Cotton Candy just a tiny bit more food, then Orange would be unhappy. He\u2019d use a paw and bat at Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrist as he was pouring out the dog food.But he didn\u2019t want Song Yu to know he was currently wearing his pyjamas; it was something very weird to do. His thoughts circled around, wondering what he should take a photo of, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s gaze finally settled on the legs he\u2019d yet to cover \u2014 or more precisely, his knee.He\u2019d only lightly bumped into the extinguisher, and it hadn\u2019t particularly hurt \u2014 but he only now realised his knee was already covered by a small bruise, a vague purple colour sweeping over his skin. His shower had also been too hot, so the water had flushed his skin pink.He sat down on the bed, his two pale and long legs bare, and in order to bring his knee closer to the camera, he brought up that specific leg until it was on tiptoes. His flexed calf muscles and pointed toes showed up in the photo as well.After sending off the photo, he didn\u2019t receive a reply for a very long time. Yue Zhishi put on his pyjamas pants and realised it was too long by an entire chunk; he kept stepping on them as he walked.Since Song Yu wasn\u2019t there, Yue Zhishi decided to secretly draw in his bed \u2014 that cleanliness obsessed person wouldn\u2019t know anyway. Yue Zhishi took out his sketchbooks and a pencil from his bag, squirrelling into Song Yu\u2019s blanket, and started to draw as he lay on his stomach.He roughly sketched out a few designs, but without much inspiration, he started to procrastinate. As he dithered around, he ended up flipping open an old sketchbook and looked over each page, the sketchbook filled with Song Yu. He\u2019d never earnestly considered it before, but now that he looked at it, he\u2019d truly drawn Song Yu\u2019s hands many times: his hand as it held a pen, his hands as he rode his bike \u2014 and even his hand carelessly dangling off the edge of his desk as he slept on crossed arms.Yue Zhishi found himself truly like a small dog. If Song Yu really did stretch out a hand to him, his first reaction might be to docilely give him his own.His second reaction would most likely be to lick his palm.He belatedly discovered that he was breathing a bit too hard. He remained cocooned in the blanket, but he pushed his face onto the drawing, his dry lips unconsciously rubbing against the cold paper.The cotton blanket was like a sponge swollen from water, saturated with Song Yu\u2019s scent; it was the familiar fragrance of his skin, as well as some indescribable hormones. Yue Zhishi lay inside, dressed in Song Yu\u2019s pyjamas, and it was as though Song Yu was pressing him down from behind, wrapping him up entirely.An invisible hand seemed to be clenched around his airways \u2014 it became incomparably hard to drag in his usual flow of oxygen. As Song Yu\u2019s face sharpened and became clearer in his mind, Yue Zhishi\u2019s breathing came faster and faster.He couldn\u2019t control his body\u2019s reaction.But Yue Zhishi firmly believed he currently wasn\u2019t hyperventilating from an attack \u2014 it was only his longing for Song Yu. Or perhaps both reasons applied: his yearning made him unable to control both his emotions and his breathing.Song Yu was like a robot with delayed responses. He sent over his reply to the photo of Yue Zhishi\u2019s bruised knee just as it wasn\u2019t convenient for Yue Zhishi to reach out a hand to check his notifications.[Gege: What happened?][Gege: Did you take this kind of photo on purpose?]Yue Zhishi was panting, and after he stretched a hand out of the blanket to look at the messages, he gave up and didn\u2019t reply. He didn\u2019t understand what \u2018this kind of photo\u2019 meant.It was only two, three seconds, and then Song Yu called. Yue Zhishi would never reject it, even though he knew it currently wasn\u2019t an appropriate time.The call had just connected when Song Yu used a relatively calm tone of voice to repeat the question he\u2019d just asked. But Yue Zhishi realised the sound of his breathing was too loud, too urgent, and it almost completely overwhelmed Song Yu\u2019s voice.It was very hot inside the blanket, and he tried to control his breathing a bit, burying his head into the pillow Song Yu had previously slept on \u2014 except it backfired, and a layer of sticky sweat grew on his forehead. Breathy noises came out of Yue Zhishi\u2019s throat, and they were like the whimpering and panting noises of a small animal when sick.At first Song Yu thought something had happened \u2014 but those noises didn\u2019t sound like the noises he was familiar with when Yue Zhishi was sick.And so his voice subtly changed; it deepened, lowered, and it still sounded incredibly domineering despite being separated by space and radio waves.\u201cYue Zhishi, what are you doing?\u201dThe author has something to say:Both the dirty hand and bruised knee are so ( )~ sigh, this long-distance coupleNot sickPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He started to pant even harder after hearing Song Yu\u2019s voice \u2014 he had no way to control it.The tip of his nose was pushed into the soft pillow, and the hot, humid air he exhaled out soaked the cotton fabric of the pillowcase and dampened his eyelashes.Song Yu wasn\u2019t speaking anymore.\u201cGege\u2026\u201dYue Zhishi hazily realised \u2014 whenever he was at his most fragile, he would still subconsciously call out that title. No matter how intentionally he avoided using it normally, his innate dependency on his older brother was unchangeable and irreplaceable.\u201cHm?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice was very low; it sounded steady and safe, the polar opposite of his.Yue Zhishi knew his current state was incredibly embarrassing, yet the lust in his heart only grew as soon as he heard Song Yu\u2019s voice.\u201cCan I hang up the phone\u2026\u201d he very quietly asked, suppressing his desire and gasps for air.\u201cYou want to hang up?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s deep voice resonated beautifully when it arrived at his ear. \u201cWhere are you right now, tell me.\u201dWith great difficulty, Yue Zhishi said the two words of\u00a0the apartment, and then he told him, holding back his pants, \u201cOn your bed.\u201dSong Yu was quiet for a few moments, and it made Yue Zhishi anxious \u2014 he really wanted to hang up the call, but contrarily enough, he also longed to hear Song Yu\u2019s voice. The mixture of pleasure with embarrassment was extraordinarily tormenting.\u201cGege, can I hang up, I really don\u2019t feel well\u2026\u201dAnd yet Song Yu questioned him back very frankly, \u201cAren\u2019t you thinking of me right now as you masturbate?\u201dIt was hard for Yue Zhishi to reply. He had no way to say he had this kind of reaction after seeing a photo of Song Yu\u2019s hand \u2014 it was just that simple, just that casual.\u201cI\u2019ll take your silence as you agreeing.\u201d Song Yu asked again, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to hear my voice?\u201dYue Zhishi was forever unable to lie to Song Yu.\u201cI do\u2026\u201d\u201cTurn on your camera.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice was a command.Yue Zhishi\u2019s pants had still yet to subside, and they came even quicker after Song Yu\u2019s order. \u201cNo, I want to hang up.\u201d\u201cYue Zhishi, you\u2019re not being a good boy.\u201d When Song Yu directly called out his full name, it felt like it was grinding away the last bits of his shame.Faintly, Yue Zhishi could feel a certain feeling hidden in the depths of his heart suddenly collapse. He was like the dead leaves in autumn, crushed to pieces.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be good,\u201d he somewhat sulkily said, pressing the side of his fevered face onto the pillow and wishing the room had some more oxygen. His voice sounded a bit pitiful. \u201cGege, don\u2019t you miss me\u2026\u201dSong Yu was silent for a few seconds, and then his voice turned husky. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dHis voice was always so nice to listen to. Yue Zhishi thought there must be a hole in his heart; the thread cruelly left behind after stitching it up was placed in Song Yu\u2019s hand, and it uncomfortably pulled at his heart with the lightest tug.This felt a bit unfair, as though only he was suffering from lust\u2019s control. He whimpered just like an injured puppy, enveloped in the blanket. \u201cGege, don\u2019t you ever have sexual desires\u2026\u201dSong Yu let loose a soft laugh, and it slid into Yue Zhishi\u2019s ears through his earbuds, goosebumps sprouting all over his back as he shivered.\u201cYue Zhishi, you\u2019re really so innocent.\u201d\u201cAre your meds nearby?\u201d Song Yu suddenly asked.Yue Zhishi glanced at the bedside table. \u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cPay attention to your reactions. Don\u2019t get too excited, or else it\u2019ll be really dangerous.\u201dThat sentence was clearly a reminder that he might suffer an attack, but under these circumstances, it sounded as though they were doing an erotic experiment.Song Yu\u2019s voice once again came through. \u201cDo you need help? Or should I hang up.\u201dYue Zhishi was slightly flustered at his question. \u201cDon\u2019t hang up\u2026\u201d\u201cThen turn on the camera.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice was firm, but he very quickly added, \u201cI only want to see your face.\u201dYue Zhishi yielded \u2014 he was ensnared, and he dizzily pressed the button to turn on the camera. He left his phone on the pillow, the camera turned towards his face.It seemed to be very dark where Song Yu was, as though he was sitting in front of his laptop. He was even fully dressed, a black woollen turtleneck tightly wrapped around him all the way past his Adam\u2019s apple.He didn\u2019t adjust his camera; Yue Zhishi could only see Song Yu\u2019s thin lips and his jaw, as well as his broad shoulders and chest.Yue Zhishi turned his face to the other side in shame, wanting to hide from him.In his screen, Song Yu could see Yue Zhishi\u2019s pale yet flushed nape under his messy, scattered hair \u2014 he could also see that black mole. His body was imperceptibly twisting underneath his blanket.Song Yu was like a cold and indifferent robot, observing and investigating the level of Yue Zhishi\u2019s reactions and sexual behaviours at this very moment. \u201cAre you hard?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d At first, Yue Zhishi was confused, sounding as though he didn\u2019t understand Song Yu\u2019s question, but he soon panted with a response. \u201cYes\u2026\u201dStaring at his neck as it increasingly blushed, Song Yu asked a bit ruthlessly, \u201cWhy did you get hard? Did you watch something you shouldn\u2019t have watched?\u201d\u201cNo, I just saw your hand\u2026\u201d He squirmed against the bedsheets, the back of his neck following along with his movements. \u201cPhoto\u2026\u201dSong Yu paused; Yue Zhishi\u2019s breathing paused with him.\u201cMy hands can get you excited?\u201d\u201cMn\u2026\u201d Releasing a large breath, he started to turn submissive and obedient under Song Yu\u2019s questioning. \u201c\u2026.Yes.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s voice continued to enter his ears. There was no patient, gentle persuasiveness in it, only a cool and impersonal sound. \u201cThen do you react when I touch you?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s breathing quickened, and a single needy noise came out of his nose in reply.\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d Song Yu commanded. \u201cIt won\u2019t be comfortable if it\u2019s too dry. Suck my fingers.\u201d\u201cBut my hand\u2019s really dirty. Do you mind?\u201dHe shook his head in a hurry, saying he didn\u2019t, and then took out a hand from the blanket and put it into his mouth.\u201cTurn around.\u201dYue Zhishi still struggled against this command. \u201cMm\u2026 no\u2026\u201dSong Yu stopped trying to force him. The wet, muffled noises that came from Yue Zhishi\u2019s sucking \u2014 it was also very nice to listen to vague and suggestive sounds.\u201cMake sure you get them very wet. Lick with the tip of your tongue.\u201dHe heard Song Yu remind him, \u201cJust like when you were sucking me. Understand?\u201dThat memory appeared without warning, and a layer of sweat covered Yue Zhishi\u2019s entire body, absorbed by the silk on his skin as though it was sucking clean every single one of his pores. \u201cMm\u2026\u201dSpit trickled down from the corners of his mouth \u2014 his fingers were already completely drenched.\u201cMove your hand down,\u201d Song Yu ordered, his voice calm.His brain muddled, Yue Zhishi did what he was told, and then he heard Song Yu tell him to imagine that it was his hand.\u201cMy hand\u2019s around you now.\u201dSong Yu was like a robot disturbed by hormones: the frequency of his waves started to waver, no longer as steady, and he praised Yue Zhishi through his own slight pants.\u201cYue Zhishi, you\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re also very adorable down there.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s face was incredibly warm, and he could only touch his cock according to Song Yu\u2019s instructions. This was something he\u2019d never been able to imagine before \u2014 he lay on the bed, face turned sideways, and he pulled in large breaths of air with his mouth open. Broken, unimportant words repeatedly spilled from his lips, and the pitch of every single word lilted upwards, faintly quivering; he moaned Song Yu\u2019s name in between his pants, his voice weak yet seductive.\u201cGege\u2026\u201dSong Yu\u2019s voice was somewhat hoarse, as though he too couldn\u2019t get enough air.\u201cYou like calling me gege in bed that much?\u201dEverything he said seemed to step on Yue Zhishi\u2019s ashamed heart. His reason broke apart piece by piece, desire grabbing hold of his entire body \u2014 the face that had refused to turn to the camera was now completely buried into the pillow, slightly suffocated.The sound of Song Yu\u2019s voice attracted him like a magnet. \u201cDoes it feel good to do these kind of things with gege?\u201dHe unknowingly turned his face towards the camera in his search for oxygen. His hair, wet from sweat, was plastered onto his forehead, and his cheeks were damp and crimson \u2014 it was like his entire person was soaked wet.\u201cYes.\u201d His eyes were closed, his thick eyelashes trembling; words of love for Song Yu stumbled from his slightly parted lips, and he kept saying he really liked him, really missed him. His gasps for air became more and more obvious, to the point even the pitch of his voice changed.With a lowered voice, Song Yu asked, \u201cCan I move faster?\u201d\u201cMm, yes.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s body was already slightly arching. \u201cGe, hold me\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Song Yu started to sound a bit breathless. \u201cI\u2019m hugging you from the back.\u201d\u201cCan you kiss me\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s wet lips rubbed against the pillow, and he subconsciously stretched out a small part of his tongue before pulling it back in.\u201cYue Zhishi, you really know how to entice people.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s voice passed verdict on him, nailing him to desire\u2019s pillar of shame. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say before you wanted to be real brothers with me?\u201d\u201cCan you do these things with your true older brother? Yue Zhishi.\u201dEvery time Song Yu called out his entire name, there was an overwhelming sense of oppression. He was about to suffocate, and yet Yue Zhishi lost himself in the boundaries between lust and morality.\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d Song Yu mercilessly lay bare the truth with his hoarse voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know. You\u2019re about to come just by what I\u2019m doing to you.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no difference between the you right now and the you suffering from an attack. You can\u2019t even control your breathing.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s pants came even faster, Song Yu controlling everything he did. He feebly moved his hand on himself, weakly breathing in and breathing out \u2014 his entire body was sticky from sweat like a broken wind box completely dripping with honey.\u201cMedicine\u2026\u201d His thoughts started to tangle, making him think he actually was suffering from an attack.\u201cMedicine\u2019s useless,\u201d Song Yu said to him in a gravelly voice. \u201cOnly I can save you.\u201d\u201cSave me, gege, save me.\u201d\u201cHow do you want me to save you?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice remained cold, but it was blended with the sound of heavy breathing. He used the coldest voice to ask the most straightforward question. \u201cBy fucking you?\u201d\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi sounded disoriented \u2014 he couldn\u2019t think, his mind utterly lost in his rapid, ragged breathing; suffering was accompanied by the pressure of pleasure, and he could only subconsciously repeat, \u201cGege, fuck me\u2026\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t give him a reply, and Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t endure it at all. His nipples were hard, and they grazed against the bedsheet, separated by the damp silk pyjamas. His whole body was almost at its limit \u2014 he could practically reach his peak just by hearing Song Yu\u2019s increasingly heavy breathing. His urgent gasps made him sound like he was hyperventilating, and so the only thing he could do was to open his mouth and drag in large gulps of air, glistening spit leaking from his mouth and slowly drenching the pillow.\u201cHah\u2026 gege\u2026 I can\u2019t, I\u2019m about to come\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi was about to come apart. He marginally cracked open his light-coloured eyes, and they were lost, covered by a layer of moisture. \u201cThe bed\u2019s going to get dirty.\u201dEven at the end, even as he watched Yue Zhishi utterly lose himself in sexual desire, Song Yu continued to act like a tolerant older brother. He gave out his final order.\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Le Le, you\u2019re a very good boy. You can come.\u201dIn the midst of his almost suffocated breaths, he heard Song Yu say\u00a0I love you\u00a0\u2014 and then he came, mind an absolute blank. Like a kite with its string cut through, he was no longer bound; he floated in the sky even though he had no more energy left.Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t someone with a high sex drive; he even rarely touched himself, because he didn\u2019t feel the need to do so. He always looked at his feelings very purely, and the two times he\u2019d masturbated was because he missed Song Yu. He had almost no way of accepting what he\u2019d just done, and so he helplessly lay on the pillow in self defeat, not moving a single bit.Over at the phone, Song Yu saw that he seemed to have finished and was only bonelessly panting on the bed. He used a voice entirely different from before to call his nickname. \u201cLe Le.\u201dHe was very tender at this moment. \u201cDo you still feel unwell?\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head, still on his stomach. He didn\u2019t speak.\u201cI really want to hug you.\u201d Song Yu was no longer acting like earlier, with the attitude that could wilfully control Yue Zhishi. \u201cYou should be really soft right now, and really nice to hold.\u201dHe talked so pragmatically once again, but Yue Zhishi still didn\u2019t want to speak.His reason gradually recovered, and he was practically buried alive in shame. He couldn\u2019t understand why he became like that; he very clearly liked Song Yu in a very pure way.Song Yu keenly sensed the change in his emotions, so he asked what was wrong. \u201cDo you uncomfortable somewhere?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dSong Yu could tell Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice didn\u2019t sound quite right. He queried, \u201cAre you crying?\u201dYue Zhishi was immediately even more embarrassed with his thoughts exposed. The edges of his cheeks and ear that the camera could see were completely flushed red. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me anymore. You should hurry and sleep.\u201d\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d Song Yu didn\u2019t plan on going away. \u201cTell me, or else I won\u2019t be able to sleep.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t want Song Yu to lose sleep because of him, so he still gave up after a bit more struggling.\u201cHow did I turn into this? I wasn\u2019t like this before. It\u2019s all because of you.\u201d Yue Zhishi tearfully said, \u201cI only feel like this when I miss you.\u201dSong Yu let out a sigh in relief and stayed quiet for a few seconds. He guessed Yue Zhishi was currently under too much stress, too busy, and also really missed him \u2014 which is why his emotions were a bit fragile.So he very patiently asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t like it?\u201dYue Zhishi sniffed. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m being really strange. I\u2019m not normally like this.\u201d\u201cYou weren\u2019t being strange at all. Everyone\u2019s like that.\u201d Song Yu said tranquilly, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t feel anything towards me, then I\u2019d actually suspect whether you liked me or not.\u201d\u201cI like you,\u201d Yue Zhishi retorted back as quickly as he could. \u201cI like you the most.\u201dSong Yu softly laughed. \u201cThen can you accept doing stuff like this?\u201d It was as though he was giving him a warning. \u201cWe might do even more excessive things later.\u201d\u201cWhen is \u2018later\u2019?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked.\u201cWhen we\u2019re doing things like this,\u201d Song Yu lowered his voice, \u201cI might even bully you.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s face was warm from being pushed into the pillow. Turning his face over, he looked at the camera \u2014 his red tinted eyes and nose were covered by a layer of moisture. Song Yu thought he was going to ask something, but the train of his thoughts was a bit bizarre. He didn\u2019t care at all about whether he was going to get bullied. Instead, he asked, \u201cThis time didn\u2019t count? Or last time?\u201d\u201cNeither of them count. I was far from bullying you.\u201d Song Yu exposed only the bottom half of his face to his camera, as well as that very ascetic looking black woollen sweater. His thin lips faintly opened and closed, no curve to his lips; he didn\u2019t look very happy.\u201cYou\u2019re already crying from today. Who knows how hard you\u2019re going to end up crying in the future \u2014 maybe we should forget about it.\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t.\u201d Yue Zhishi was a bit anxious from his teasing, dropping a few tears, and even wriggled on the pillow in a fit of pique. \u201cI won\u2019t cry next time.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s straight lips vaguely curved up. He leaned backwards and revealed his entire face \u2014 he was elegantly, immaculately dressed and was even wearing his glasses. Without a single hair out of place, he looked the complete opposite of Yue Zhishi.\u201cGood boy,\u201d he said, giving Yue Zhishi a compliment like a piece of candy.Yue Zhishi gazed at the person in his screen, spellbound, before slowly blinking a few times in confusion. He whispered, \u201cI really miss you.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s eyes softened; he pulled off his glasses and moved his hand in the air, looking as though he was caressing Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair. \u201cI can\u2019t carry you to the shower this time.\u201d\u201cI can go myself.\u201d Yue Zhishi remembered something and tugged at the clothes on his body. He honestly admitted, \u201cBut I\u2019m wearing your sleeping clothes. I also dirtied your bed \u2014 I was even drawing on it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s eyes were warm and gentle as he gazed at him.\u201cBut you really like being clean.\u201d Yue Zhishi felt slightly uneasy.There was a tender look on Song Yu\u2019s face, and his mouth crooked up in a faint smile. \u201cYou\u2019re the cleanest child in the world, no matter what you do.\u201dThat sentence wasn\u2019t some beautiful, romantic speech; it was just a simple reply, and yet it gave Yue Zhishi a burning face and racing heart. He didn\u2019t know what he should say, so he only leaned in closer with a bit of a coquettish whine in his voice. He gave Song Yu a kiss through the camera, as though he was expressing his gratitude.He didn\u2019t know if he saw wrongly, but he kept feeling that there was a shred of apology hidden in Song Yu\u2019s face.A few seconds passed, and then Song Yu spoke. He asked with some hesitation, \u201cWas I too hard on you just then?\u201dYue Zhishi felt a bit shy \u2014 he covered his face with the pillow. \u201cA bit.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be like that next time.\u201d After promising, he then added, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what you liked.\u201dIt was only at this moment that Yue Zhishi suddenly realised: actually, Song Yu had no experience at all as well. Perhaps he\u2019d only subconsciously, unintentionally revealed his desire for control.\u201cNo.\u201d Lowering the pillow a fraction, Yue Zhishi showed off his pair of beautiful eyes. \u201cI liked it when you were being a bit fierce. Especially when you were calling my full name.\u201dAnd before he could feel shy again, he rapidly continued to say, \u201cBut can you not be mean to me usually?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Song Yu nodded. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201dYue Zhishi was still unwilling to hang up the call as he showered and cleaned up. He kept asking Song Yu many questions, like when was he coming back, can he go pick him up, what present was he giving him this time\u2026 He chattered all the way until Song Yu also got into bed, and only then did he slightly quiet down.\u201cDo you still want me to read my diary to you?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked.Song Yu rested inside his very cold blanket, humming in agreement. Slightly surprised, he asked, \u201cYou even brought over your diary?\u201d\u201cYup,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, grabbing the diary from the bedside table and flipping through it, \u201cbecause I was worried you wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep. I thought I\u2019d be able to read it to you whenever you wanted if you asked. At least this way you can sleep well while away.\u201dSong Yu said thank you \u2014 he sounded quite serious, and it made Yue Zhishi feel somewhat shy.Clearing his throat, he carelessly flipped to a random page and read out, \u201cOctober 28th, rain. I\u2019m so happy it\u2019s raining. I won\u2019t bring an umbrella, so I can get gege to\u2026\u201d Halfway through, Yue Zhishi squinted at the words for a long while. \u201cAh, this guy didn\u2019t even know how to write the word \u2018hold\u2019 for \u2018hold the umbrella\u2019.\u201dSong Yu wanted to laugh and asked, \u201cAre you talking about yourself?\u201dYue Zhishi remembered this was actually his diary. He felt a bit awkward, but he continued reading, pretending nothing had happened. \u201c\u2026.so I can get gege to hold the umbrella for me. Gege normally doesn\u2019t like holding my hand, but he\u2019ll let me hold onto him when he\u2019s holding up the umbrella. He gets scared that I\u2019ll step into all the water puddles on the street. Even though he says I\u2019m an idiot, he\u2019s still the absolutely best gege in the entire universe.\u201dAfter finishing, Yue Zhishi could hear the sound of Song Yu trying not to laugh. He was a bit helpless. \u201cWhy is my diary all about you?\u201d\u201cWho knows. Gege this, gege that \u2014 you just didn\u2019t like gege.\u201d\u201cI did like you, I just understood it late\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi weakly argued back. He turned to another page. \u201cNext entry\u2026 raining again. This entry\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s very long.\u201d\u201cOctober 29th, raining today too. My socks got wet, and I wasn\u2019t too happy about it. But when I entered my classroom and realised everyone\u2019s socks were wet, I became happy again. Now I really like it when it rains. Because the teacher will say some very not nice things to the student who tested the worst\u2026\u201d And then, Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but complain about the flow of the passage. \u201cWhat is this writing? There\u2019s no logical flow to it.\u201dSong Yu gave the same evaluation to both his childish writing and current complaint about himself: \u201cVery cute.\u201dYue Zhishi felt somewhat bashful at abruptly being praised, but he forged on. \u201cBecause of his bad grades, the teacher thought he was the one who didn\u2019t turn in his homework. But the teacher was wrong. First place Chen Miaomiao and last place Wang Xiaofeng both didn\u2019t bring umbrellas today, so they both got wet. Both of them got wet the same amount as each other. It looks like rain is fairer than the teacher.\u201dAfter finishing that passage, Yue Zhishi pushed away the diary in mortification and then flopped onto his pillow. \u201cI\u2019m not going to read this anymore in the future, I feel like you\u2019re going to laugh so hard you won\u2019t be able to sleep.\u201dBut Song Yu asked very earnestly, \u201cBut didn\u2019t you write very well? The rain really did treat them more fairly than the teacher. It treats people more equally than many other people do.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t really think about his words, only taking them as Song Yu consoling him; he simply let out a glum \u2018mn\u2019.But then suddenly, a thread of inspiration flashed through his mind \u2014 he wildly lifted up his head and grabbed the diary, carefully rereading that page.\u201cI got it,\u201d he said to Song Yu with exhilaration. \u201cI know what the concept should be for the third round now. It\u2019s \u2018equality\u2019.\u201dSong Yu hummed, and then, with gentleness and sincerity, he encouraged him, saying, \u201cKeep going.\u201d\u201cThe concepts for our first two rounds are \u2018time\u2019 and \u2018space\u2019. Rain will be the thread linking both of them together since it can bridge the distance between time and space. That diary entry just then made me think \u2014 rain treats everyone equally, just like law. No matter if you\u2019re rich or poor, man or woman; it doesn\u2019t matter how old you are or what race you come from. Rain will always fall on them as long as they want it to. No one will be rejected by the rain. Am I right?\u201dSong Yu really wanted to see how Yue Zhishi looked like right at this very moment. He thought he would look extremely, absolutely enchanting.\u201cYou\u2019re right. That\u2019s a very extraordinary idea; it\u2019s particularly clever.\u201dYue Zhishi climbed out of bed, turning on the lamp on the desk. \u201cI have so many thoughts right now, I want to try to sketch them all out.\u201d He then said to Song Yu, \u201cGege, are you sleepy now?\u201d\u201cYou want to abandon me again?\u201d Song Yu intentionally said, \u201cGo. Since I\u2019m already used to being just a tool.\u201dYue Zhishi cutely whined and said he didn\u2019t. \u201cHow about I turn on the camera so you can watch as I draw? You can sleep once you\u2019re tired.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dHe sat in front of the desk, his arms draped around the left leg lifted onto the chair. His face was settled on his knee as he casually drew with his right hand.The light of the lamp blurred that face mixed with both eastern and western features with a golden veil \u2014 it made him look both priceless and beautiful.Song Yu lay in a field of darkness, quietly watching Yue Zhishi in his screen. Once he fell silent, it was truly as though he was a figure found only in relief sculptures and murals; there was no sense of frivolous makeup over his pale, almost transparent skin. He was beautiful without being superficial, and he lured people in without meaning to \u2014 he was clean, holy and pure.If he was marred by possessiveness, wicked thoughts or a desire to destroy, then it would solely be his fault. Yue Zhishi was forever innocent.\u201cYour knee needs to be treated,\u201d Song Yu quietly said.Yue Zhishi docilely nodded. \u201cYou can put some cream on it when you\u2019re back.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Song Yu replied.Yue Zhishi had no idea when Song Yu fell asleep; he\u2019d been too focused on his work. He only realised Song Yu was breathing deeply, eyes closed, when he lifted his head. He stared at his screen for a long, long time, lost in his thoughts, and his finger lightly traced over Song Yu\u2019s nose.Yue Zhishi silently thought, this person was really quite strange. He\u2019d given him commands with such force, even saying he\u2019d bully him in the future \u2014 and yet after everything was done, he\u2019d apologetically asked if he\u2019d gone too far.He thought, there really might not be another person in the world who could move his heart so much.After spending an entire night in the apartment, Yue Zhishi sent a message the next morning to the design team\u2019s group chat on WeChat called [Little Swallow Dressed in Flowery Clothes]. He said he had a new idea, so Nan Jia once again borrowed a classroom at midday for an unplanned team meeting.\u201cI\u2019ll talk quickly so everyone can go back and rest.\u201d Yue Zhishi pulled out the few pieces of paper with his design concept from his bag and gave them to everyone. \u201cI think we can use \u2018rain\u2019s equality\u2019 for the third round of the show.\u201d\u201cEquality?\u201d Chen Pi didn\u2019t understand his meaning. \u201cWhy?\u201dYue Zhishi explained, \u201cBecause rain doesn\u2019t care about your race, your gender or even your social class. As long as you want to be rained on, rain will always fall on everyone, equally.\u201dThis concept surprised everyone.\u201cAnd besides, after going through time and space, our theme will finally return back to humanity. It matches our law school\u2019s philosophy. Everyone is equal in front of the law, just like how rain will pour over the whole of society.\u201dQu Zhi flicked a brow. \u201cI like this idea.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d Nan Jia was recording down Yue Zhishi\u2019s words in a notebook, and she queried, \u201chow are we meant to express this equality?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to talk about next.\u201d Yue Zhishi brought out the rough drafts he created in a rush last night. \u201cI\u2019ve thought of these designs so far. Using different designs, we can represent all the different types of people \u2014 for example, making our clothes look old and putting holes in them can represent \u2018impoverished\u2019. Or using expensive fabrics for \u2018wealthy\u2019.\u201d\u201cI understand now,\u201d Zhou Yi said. \u201cAnd men, women, children and the elderly\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, just like that. We don\u2019t have to confine how our models look like either; they don\u2019t necessarily have to be tall and beautiful \u2014 because rain is equal.\u201d Yue Zhishi pointed at a paper. \u201cFor \u2018rain\u2019, we can use a see through material to make a thin outer coat and to simulate how it feels to have rain fall on someone\u2019s body. I researched some fabrics, and there\u2019s a certain type that\u2019s really thin and really glossy. We might be able to use it to give off that light blue, watery feeling. I\u2019ll look for it after class these next two days.\u201d\u201cIf we really can use it, then we\u2019ll be able to have everyone look like they\u2019re standing under the rain!\u201d Even Chen Pi was excited.\u201cAnd we really can make it rain.\u201d Nan Jia said, \u201cI\u2019ve already talked to the organiser\u2019s stage designers, and they said we can add in a machine for water. We just need to let them know ahead of time for them to organise it.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s great. The entire round should look really good if the stage effects can match.\u201dQu Zhi was a bit impressed with him. \u201cYour brain has a lot of unusual and weird things.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Xiao Qi still spoke very softly, but she now even dared to joke with Yue Zhishi. \u201cWhat inspired you? What good thing happened last night?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s face instantly burned. \u201cNothing, nothing \u2014 I just suddenly thought of it.\u201d\u201cAre you sure? I feel like there\u2019s something not quite right here,\u201d Nan Jia deliberately teased.\u201cReally.\u201d For his own self protection, Yue Zhishi threw out an important subject to change the topic. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019ve thought of an incredible finishing move to end the show. It\u2019ll definitely shock the entire room.\u201d\u201cFinishing move?? What is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d A sly smile appeared on Yue Zhishi\u2019s face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The five of them distributed the responsibility for the three separate concepts among themselves, and new ideas always came bouncing out whenever they held a meeting. They\u2019d originally thought they\u2019d been given an extremely difficult main theme with little to no novelty \u2014 no one expected to be able to have such plentiful, abundant ideas.\u201cI looked around both our school and our university\u2019s basketball teams and managed to find these\u00a0 few people.\u201d Using her iPad, Nan Jia displayed the photos of the models she\u2019d selected and showed them to the team.The photos slid across one by one, and Chen Pi and Zhou Yi were the most excited. \u201cHey, this one\u2019s hot!\u201d\u201cThis one\u2019s not bad either, he\u2019s super muscular.\u201dNan Jia couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cWhy do you guys sound like you\u2019re gay?\u201dChen Pi tapped his nose. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be willing to be born handsome and wear the clothes they\u2019d designed themselves? How awesome would that be. Beautiful ladies are good too, we really need pretty girls.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely have pretty girls. When I went over to the university team, I specifically went to take a look at the cheerleading team and etiquette department.\u201d Nan Jia scrolled down quite a few photos. \u201cLook, aren\u2019t they all really pretty?\u201dYue Zhishi looked at their dazzling collection of model options and couldn\u2019t hold back his emotional sigh, saying, \u201cGood thing senior\u2019s so well-connected with so many resources. You have people willing to help you no matter where you go.\u201dNan Jia deliberately and dramatically brushed back the hair on her shoulders. \u201cWho told me to be so loveable.\u201dQu Zhi had been sitting by the side, focused on her drawings, and now she suddenly looked up and turned her face towards Nan Jia.\u201cDid you change your shampoo?\u201dNan Jia froze for a second, a bit surprised at how observant she was. \u201cAh\u2026 yes. Can\u2019t believe you noticed it.\u201d\u201cIt smells really nice.\u201d Qu Zhi lowered her head again, continuing with her work.Yue Zhishi glanced at Qu Zhi\u2019s paper on purpose \u2014 the model in the drawing may not have clear facial features, but her hairstyle and overall aura were almost exactly the same as Nan Jia\u2019s.\u201cWith these handsome guys and beautiful girls, and the looks of us designers,\u201d Chen Pi shamelessly boasted, \u201cwe\u2019ll immediately blow up the entire room and lay waste to all the other teams. Please award us with the prize for \u2018the team most easy on the eyes\u2019.\u201dXiao Qi also softly agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ve already won with just the basketball team\u2026\u201dBut Nan Jia released a long sigh. \u201cOriginally I thought we\u2019d have another shock factor, but that shock factor\u2019s too cold and indifferent and rejected me.\u201dLifting his head, Yue Zhishi met Nan Jia\u2019s eyes. She nodded at him regretfully and said, \u201cIt\u2019s exactly who you\u2019re thinking. Song Yu.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d Chen Pi slapped his leg. \u201cSenior Song Yu.\u201dYue Zhishi was slightly surprised. \u201cYou know him too?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Chen Pi pointed at Zhou Yi while spinning his chair. \u201cAren\u2019t we second year students? We went to watch the finals for the basketball tournament last year. Good lord \u2014 I\u2019m directly calling him my good lord \u2014 the entire court was screaming out senior Song Yu\u2019s name. I almost went deaf.\u201dZhou Yi nodded and added, \u201cEspecially when senior pulled up his jersey to wipe away the sweat on his face after shooting a ball. All the girls around me shrieked at the same time.\u201dYue Zhishi silently thought, I didn\u2019t even know there was something like that. But it had been the same when Song Yu played in the basketball team during high school \u2014 Yue Zhishi could pretty much imagine the scene.\u201cI\u2019m guessing you guys still don\u2019t know yet.\u201d Nan Jia winked at Yue Zhishi. \u201cOur Le Le has a great relationship with senior Song Yu.\u201dEveryone around the round table looked at Yue Zhishi at the same time, and it flustered him a bit, the pen in his hand dropping onto the table before rolling down to the floor.\u201cWow, what kind of relationship?\u201dQu Zhi watched as he picked his pen back up, his face a bright red.Xiao Qi\u2019s secretly hidden gossipy nature exposed itself, and she very quietly asked, \u201cAre you guys brothers? I heard senior Song Yu got into a fight with one of our school\u2019s seniors just to stop him from forcing you to drink.\u201d\u201cNo no, they didn\u2019t fight,\u201d Yue Zhishi rushed to explain. \u201cJust a small argument.\u201d\u201cAre the genes in your family all squeezed from N\u00fcwa?\u201d Chen Pi was collapsed on his chair. \u201cHow could there be such a large difference between people?\u201dNot wanting to explain further, Yue Zhishi hurriedly changed the topic and asked Nan Jia, \u201cHow did he reject you?\u201dNan Jia supported her chin with a hand and pulled up her chat record with Song Yu. \u201cLet me show you how cold and heartless he was. Look.\u201d Nan Jia held up her phone for Yue Zhishi to see. \u201cI sent him such a long message, telling him this competition was really important and really needed a model who could shock the entire room. I even dragged you in as well, and talked about how hard you\u2019ve been working the last few days just for this. I said we really, really hoped he could help us out \u2014 it would be the icing on the cake.\u201d\u201cBut look at what he said.\u201d Nan Jia\u2019s finger slid downwards.[Song Yu: I don\u2019t want people looking at me. Look for someone else.]\u201cDoesn\u2019t he sound particularly hard-hearted!\u201dYue Zhishi looked at the time of Song Yu\u2019s reply. It was after he\u2019d sent him a photo of his hand.He almost couldn\u2019t imagine it: in front of other people, Song Yu was a cold and ruthless machine that rejected everything, but at the same time, he could cutely complain to Yue Zhishi\u00a0you\u2019re being very unfair\u00a0simply because he didn\u2019t receive a photo from Yue Zhishi in return.It was such a wondrous feeling \u2014 it was like a little cat reaching out its paw and giving Yue Zhishi a very lively scratch despite forever giving other people only its haughty back.\u201cSince he\u2019s your older brother,\u201d Qu Zhi suggested as she looked at him, \u201che might say yes if you ask.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Yue Zhishi thought the idea wouldn\u2019t quite work. \u201cIf senior Song Yu said he didn\u2019t want to be in the spotlight, then even I might not be able to succeed.\u201dNan Jia waved a hand. \u201cNo need, no need. We already have enough models, they just need to practice their runway walking. Song Yu should be fairly busy too, so we may as well not bother him.\u201dXiao Qi\u2019s cellphone suddenly rang as they were speaking. She went outside for a bit, and she looked grim when she came back. Her father operated a store for handmade, custom-designed qipao, which was why she was so familiar with fabrics and had a certain level of resources. She\u2019d been given the jobs of contacting fabric manufacturers and clothing production factories for their designs.\u201cThe, the fabric manufacturer just called me\u2026\u201d Xiao Qi sat down and looked at Yue Zhishi with very anxious looking eyes. \u201cThey said they don\u2019t have that special fabric we need. I asked them to help me double check with other manufacturers, and they said this transparent silk\u2019s about to go out of production and is also really expensive. Very few manufacturers still sell it \u2014 actually, there\u2019s only one left. But, but that manufacturer most likely won\u2019t give it to us.\u201dYue Zhishi frowned. \u201cYou mean, there\u2019s one place left that makes it but they won\u2019t sell it to us?\u201d He felt like that was a problem they could solve. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. At least there\u2019s still a place, we can contact them and ask. Maybe we\u2019ll be lucky and be able to buy it from them.\u201dXiao Qi shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. I already asked my fabric manufacturer to ask that place for me, but they don\u2019t sell fabrics in small quantities. So, so for people like us who are only going to buy enough to make a few sets of clothes, they\u2019re not going to bother with us\u2026\u201dZhou Yi followed along with his own sigh. \u201cRunning into these kinds of things is the worst. We took a long time to find a clothing production factory willing to help us too.\u201dChen Pi was slumped on his desk. \u201cIf it was that journalism guy, he\u2019d definitely be able to get fabrics with his family connections.\u201d He then bumped Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm. \u201cHey, I feel like he quite likes you. Le Le, why don\u2019t you go and ask him?\u201dTo Yue Zhishi, that was a terrible idea.\u201cThis is a competition. Plus we\u2019re competitors \u2014 we can\u2019t ask our competitors for help as soon as we run into a problem. A competition like that wouldn\u2019t be fair and would have no meaning to it.\u201dEven though he usually looked like a good-natured little boy, in certain situations, he would always display extremely strict standards and personal values. \u201cBesides, this isn\u2019t something that definitely won\u2019t succeed. Xiao Qi, give me the contact details for that fabric manufacturer \u2014 I\u2019ll give them a try. If we really can\u2019t get the fabric from them, then we can try to find another similar fabric and process it a bit as a replacement.\u201dNan Jia nodded. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201dAfter their meeting ended, Yue Zhishi specifically walked with Xiao Qi to inquire and understand the current situation. She informed him, very dejectedly, that the current most troublesome thing was that she didn\u2019t have that manufacturer\u2019s contact number.\u201cThe uncle I know doesn\u2019t have a particularly good relationship with that manufacturer, so I only have their specific location\u2026\u201dIt was very cold outside, and Yue Zhishi hunched his shoulders, not having worn a lot of clothing. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, we can head over there. Tomorrow just happens to be the weekend.\u201dXiao Qi nodded and forwarded the address to Yue Zhishi\u2019s phone. \u201cIt\u2019s really far. They\u2019re in Guangzhou.\u201dYue Zhishi hadn\u2019t expected that. He glanced at the message, standing face to face with Xiao Qi underneath the gingko trees. He was just thinking of what he should do when some people started looking in their direction.\u201cWhy don\u2019t I go,\u201d Xiao Qi said, slightly stumbling over her words, \u201cI don\u2019t have to go to my piano lessons on the weekend. I think Qu Zhi\u2019s helping senior sister with some volunteer work, while Chen Pi and Zhou Yi both need to attend party activities on the weekends. They shouldn\u2019t have any time.\u201dPushing his hands into his pockets, Yue Zhishi gave her a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, I can go by myself. How could I get a girl to head so far away? It could be really dangerous.\u201d\u201cThen how about I go with you?\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head, refusing her suggestion. On one hand, he didn\u2019t want Xiao Qi to painfully travel so far, and he felt like it\u2019d be enough with just himself; on the other hand, it wouldn\u2019t be too convenient if they went out together, no matter if it was living in a hotel or taking the plane. Their school\u2019s social circle was small, and any little thing was easily blown up. It would affect Xiao Qi badly if there were any rumours.Besides, he also didn\u2019t want gege to misunderstand.As a true person of action, Yue Zhishi bought a plane ticket that very afternoon after deciding he\u2019d go to Guangzhou for the fabric manufacturer. He bought a ticket for the 8am flight the next morning.This was actually Yue Zhishi\u2019s first time travelling out by himself in his entire life, even though he wasn\u2019t heading out for a holiday but rather carrying a mission on his shoulders. After he bought the plane ticket, the first thing he did was to call Song Yu, but he only received an automated voice.\u201c\u2026We\u2019re sorry, your phone call could not be connected, please try again\u2026\u201dYue Zhishi guessed Song Yu might be busy with something or perhaps in an area with bad cellphone coverage, so he didn\u2019t take it to heart. Jiang Yuan ran over, pulling him into a game to bump up numbers, and once he started playing, Yue Zhishi forgot to send Song Yu a message. He only remembered just as he was about to sleep; he reported his extremely urgent and hasty itinerary to him on WeChat.Very early the next day, Yue Zhishi climbed out of bed, taking a taxi to the airport with his small luggage. The traffic was a mess, and the weather wasn\u2019t good either \u2014 the sky was gloomy and overcast, and it wasn\u2019t clear whether it was fog or haze in the air that was blanketing everything with grey. The taxi driver turned on the radio, and it broadcasted that a light rain was predicted for today.When he arrived at the airport, Yue Zhishi pulled out his phone to pay the driver, only then seeing the message Song Yu had sent at 5am that morning.[Gege: I dropped my phone yesterday, and I wasn\u2019t able to turn it on until after I charged it the whole night. I still don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll die on me.][Gege: Are you at the airport now? I checked the weather, and it looks like it won\u2019t be good weather over there today. Remember to carefully listen to the voice announcements and don\u2019t talk too much with people you don\u2019t know.]Yue Zhishi felt Song Yu was sometimes very amusing \u2014 if someone else saw the message, they might think Yue Zhishi was a six year old child.He exited the taxi after paying and gave Song Yu a call. It was still really early, but Song Yu\u2019s voice sounded like he was already awake. Yue Zhishi collected his plane ticket and went through the usual procedures while he chatted to Song Yu, telling him about the troublesome things he\u2019d encountered and asking him when he\u2019d come back.\u201cPerhaps two days from now.\u201d Song Yu then added, \u201cThat was the original plan.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Lowering his head, Yue Zhishi looked at the plane ticket in his hand and then gazed out at the dark grey sky outside the glass walls of the airport terminal. He\u2019d always had a high level of tolerance to anything \u2014 and yet now, at not being able to see Song Yu earlier, he found it very hard to cover up his regret. He sat down on the cold airport seat, stretched out his legs and said to Song Yu docilely, \u201cThen I\u2019ll come back earlier to see you.\u201dSong Yu said, good. Whenever Song Yu talked on the phone with him, Yue Zhishi always thought he came across gentler \u2014 perhaps it was because they were talking through something, or perhaps it was a matter of one coding and the other decoding the words sent in between, but the Song Yu on the phone made Yue Zhishi miss him more, made Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart stir more.Yue Zhishi quieted down, pondering again, and thought: perhaps in the end, it was because he couldn\u2019t touch him, couldn\u2019t hug him and could only listen to his voice. He could only imagine the look on Song Yu\u2019s face, and so that made him want to see him even more.They hadn\u2019t spoken for too long when the terminal started broadcasting flight information; it just so happened to be Yue Zhishi\u2019s flight. Checking the time, he took a look at the watch Song Yu had given him and got up, preparing to board.\u201cI\u2019m going to hang up now. I need to board.\u201d\u201cWait a moment.\u201d It was rare for Song Yu to hold Yue Zhishi back from doing something. Yue Zhishi\u2019s footsteps halted for two seconds, and Song Yu\u2019s tender, steady voice transmitted through the phone. \u201cI still haven\u2019t praised you yet.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve already become an adult who can take charge of things by yourself. You\u2019re amazing.\u201dYue Zhishi easily found the sweetness hidden in his words, and even felt the tiniest, smallest bit of pride. He knew Song Yu clutched onto him very tightly \u2014 but he himself truly enjoyed how that felt.\u201cWe\u2019ll see each other very soon. Travel safely.\u201dThe single beep noise at the phone call being disconnected was like a magical toggle key, changing Yue Zhishi from a little child exceedingly dependent on his gege to an adult who could independently leave his city. Everything went much smoother than he imagined. His seat was next to a window, and he leaned back into his seat, looking at the drizzle falling outside. In his heart, he silently prayed for a safe arrival.A man around forty years old sat next to him. He was already tired from travelling, but he wanted to find someone to talk to; at first, he was curious about Yue Zhishi\u2019s looks and asked if he was a foreigner. After learning he was mixed, the man was then curious about his family background before starting to complain to Yue Zhishi, saying he\u2019d flown in from Los Angeles and needed to transfer at Jiang city. He\u2019d already had a long journey.Even though Yue Zhishi was a bit sleepy, he still replied to the man very politely.\u201cThis weather\u2019s seriously terrible.\u201d The man looked outside the window. \u201cBut since it hasn\u2019t delayed our flight, it shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded. The rain had already started falling faster, and the sky was too dim for morning \u2014 it looked more like dusk, easing towards nightfall. Without realising it, he reached out a hand and stroked his watch. \u201cI hope so.\u201d\u201cI still need to meet a really important client. Hopefully nothing goes wrong.\u201d The man adjusted his seat, looking as though he was preparing to finish their conversation. Letting out a breath in relief, Yue Zhishi curved his head against the window and closed his eyes.He didn\u2019t get enough sleep last night, so Yue Zhishi fell asleep very quickly. Except he\u2019d never been able to sleep deeply on planes, and this time, he kept drowsing in and out, feeling the plane continuously jolting up and down. He had a really realistic dream \u2014 he dreamed he went to look for Song Yu during a thunderstorm. The thunder outside was loud and ferocious, white lightning flashing across the night sky, and he searched for Song Yu for a very long time while soaked wet and holding back his fear. He finally found Song Yu in an old wooden cabinet.It was very dark inside once he opened the door, very damp; Song Yu was sitting by himself while hugging his knees and didn\u2019t say a single thing, as though he\u2019d already sat there for a very, very long time and had long gotten used to it.He initially wanted to take Song Yu away, but in the end, he squeezed inside and wrapped his arms around him, hiding together inside the cabinet.Yue Zhishi faintly heard the sound of a flight announcement. The cabinet in his dream wouldn\u2019t stop shaking, and he could feel someone pulling and patting him. Yue Zhishi jerked awake and saw an air stewardess busily working in the aisle, and the man next to him was urgently saying to him, \u201cYou\u2019re finally awake. Our flight\u2019s been diverted, hurry and get ready.\u201d\u201cA diversion?\u201d Yue Zhishi frowned in confusion. \u201cWhy are we diverted?\u201d\u201cI think there\u2019s a typhoon. Guangzhou is storming particularly hard right now, and no planes can get in. We need to land in Changsha.\u201dYue Zhishi thought his luck really wasn\u2019t all that good, having met something like this the first time he went out for \u2018work\u2019. He didn\u2019t understand what a flight diversion was, and also didn\u2019t know what their current situation was like. The child in front of them kept crying and fussing, and his mother seemed to be quite impatient as she scolded him loudly. Yue Zhishi organised his tray table and his things, a bit panicked.He remembered an extremely thrilling movie he\u2019d once watched with Song Yu. Before the plane crashed, the flight crew prepared a will for every single person so that they could be given to their family members.Yue Zhishi looked utterly calm, and he rapidly put all his things away, following along with staff orders \u2014 but he kept thinking of that movie.But Yue Zhishi still didn\u2019t need to write a will even by the time the plane landed at the alternate airport.All the people around them were very irritable, annoyed because they couldn\u2019t arrive in Guangzhou as expected. Everyone swarmed out to the airline\u2019s service desk, preparing to create trouble, and the staff at the service desk placated them, telling them they wouldn\u2019t need to wait very long for a new flight.Pushing his luggage, Yue Zhishi looked for a long time before he found and sat down in an empty seat in a corner. The airport was a bit cold, and the light tan cashmere coat Yue Zhishi was wearing wasn\u2019t enough. Rushing travellers filled the terminal lobby; there were people holding others in happiness, and there were also people holding others while dropping tears.As though only he was alone.Yue Zhishi pulled out his phone, turned it on. He seldom called Song Yu straight away, worried he\u2019d disturb his work \u2014 he usually just sent messages through WeChat.[Le Le: I haven\u2019t reached Guangzhou yet. They seem to be in a typhoon at the moment, and our entire flight\u2019s been diverted to Changsha. I hear we\u2019ll need to wait for a few hours before the rain over there gets better. My luck truly is bad. I think getting into something so troublesome the first day I\u2019m out isn\u2019t a good sign.]Once he sent it out, Yue Zhishi thought for a bit and then hurriedly sent another message, afraid his unlucky words would come true.[Le Le: But having the worst thing happen at the beginning means everything else should go much smoother, right?]He didn\u2019t receive a reply from Song Yu immediately and guessed he was currently busy; Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t really mind. He took out his laptop, watching a few episodes of a newly released drama by himself, and then he reached into his bag again to pull out the\u00a0glutinous rice dumplings\u00a0Jiang Yuan had given him earlier to fill his stomach.He hadn\u2019t slept in a good position on the plane, and now that he had to sit and wait multiple hours in a hard chair, every passing second felt like a year. He now was slightly regretful that he didn\u2019t let Xiao Qi come with him; at least then he would\u2019ve had someone to talk to.After waiting for so long, he was now somewhat hungry. He strolled around the airport with his luggage before finally pausing in front of a small store selling pastries. The fragrance drifting out was too strong \u2014 Yue Zhishi pretty much couldn\u2019t move away.It wasn\u2019t a large store, but it was the only store in the airport selling cakes. There was a very large Christmas tree inside that was most likely purchased early; there were no decorations on it at all, and it looked a bit sad and miserable.He thought there might be something he could eat in here, so he walked in, searching for a target in the long row of display counters.Even if it was only an ice cream or a mousse.The cellphone in his hand abruptly vibrated, and Yue Zhishi picked up the call immediately, seeing it was from Song Yu. His eyes were still focused on the sparkling display of cakes.Song Yu spoke much faster than usual, as though he\u2019d just finished rushing through something. \u201cWhere are you right now?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Yue Zhishi thought he didn\u2019t see his message. \u201cAt the airport. I\u2019m a bit hungry right now, and there\u2019s a small pastry shop here. It smelled so delicious I went inside.\u201dAfraid Song Yu would worry, Yue Zhishi made sure to say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t eat random things.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d It sounded like there was someone talking on Song Yu\u2019s side of the phone. Song Yu said a few things to Yue Zhishi, but the store was too noisy \u2014 Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t hear him clearly and wanted to head outside. He turned and bumped directly into a someone carrying two massive bags of flour, and the bags of flour on the man\u2019s shoulder frantically wobbled from the impact.\u201cHey hey hey, watch out!\u201dTwo staff members rushed over to hold up the bags. \u201cThat scared me to death. Good thing the bags didn\u2019t fall.\u201dBut the bags were dusted with a large amount of flour, and Yue Zhishi breathed in the flour that had spread instantly into the air. He supported himself with the display counter and started to violently cough, bent over at the waist.\u201cYue Zhishi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Over the phone, Song Yu\u2019s voice changed. \u201cWhat happened?\u201dHe really wanted to reply, but his ability to do anything was constricted by his lack of air. He didn\u2019t know how, but he accidentally hung up \u2014 he could no longer hear Song Yu\u2019s voice.At first, a staff member thought he was choking and dashed to pour him some water, but Yue Zhishi turned weaker the longer he coughed. He started to wheeze, his breathing coming faster and faster, and his back started to slide down against the counter.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cDo you have asthma?\u201dIt was difficult for him to breathe \u2014 he had no way to give them any sort of response. He painfully tugged at the backpack sitting on top of his luggage, and he scrambled through it, looking for a little bag, before he poured everything inside onto the floor. He flipped through everything in desperation and then found his lifesaving asthma inhaler. He dragged in the medication with large, deep breaths.Hurry \u2014 he didn\u2019t want Song Yu to worry. He needed to quickly call back.A bunch of people surrounded him, and they were all looking at him. Yue Zhishi\u2019s vision was a bit fuzzy, and he could feel himself continuing to sweat. Luckily he had his medication with him; his symptoms slowly faded, and he now at least had the energy to lift his hand and pull down the scarf around his neck.The scarf rested on his legs. Yue Zhishi lay weakly in front of the display counter, and a staff member brought over a cup of water for him, asking if he needed an ambulance.Shaking his head, Yue Zhishi took the water in gratitude \u2014 except he didn\u2019t have the energy to drink it and could only temporarily leave it on the ground.The sudden asthma attack left him breathless, his mind dazed and foggy. He kept pulling in large breaths of air, and he kept thinking again and again of that dream he had on the plane. His negative emotions were like stagnant ponds of water left after the rain, spreading out bit by bit.He sat on the ice-cold floor and took out his phone to call Song Yu. Lifting his head, he made a rather impossible wish towards that unofficial Christmas tree \u2014 but it flashed through his mind very swiftly and disappeared.\u201cThe person you\u2019re calling is currently busy, please try again\u2026\u201dGuessing Song Yu was trying to call him, Yue Zhishi hung up and waited for a little while, but the understanding between them caused trouble right at this moment.\u201cThe person you\u2019re calling\u2026\u201dHe hung up again, and Yue Zhishi lowered his head, dejected. He chose to silently wait; his nose was slightly burning, and he was still steadily trying to adjust his breathing so that he would sound better on the phone.Around two, three seconds later, his darkened phone screen suddenly lit up.A small little light in Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart also ignited. He was just about to pick up the call when abruptly \u2014 he heard that familiar voice he\u2019d yearned to hear.\u201cYue Zhishi.\u201dWhen Song Yu finally arrived at this pastry shop, the first thing he saw was Yue Zhishi sitting against the floor. Yue Zhishi turned his face in Song Yu\u2019s direction; the cool toned lights made his face appear wan and pale, and the small amount of sweat on his forehead was glistening in tiny pieces. His lips were also pale, and he looked like a dried out and faded rose.Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes looked very confused \u2014 he thought he was hearing things and was even having a hallucination after his attack. He didn\u2019t believe what was happening until Song Yu ran over, his eyes so alarmed he didn\u2019t seem real, and hugged him in front of everyone\u2019s eyes. He didn\u2019t believe it until he smelled that pleasant scent that always surrounded Song Yu, until he could bury his face into the dip of Song Yu\u2019s shoulder.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d There was sweat on Song Yu\u2019s forehead, and he looked like he\u2019d run for a very long time. His palm was very hot \u2014 he stroked Yue Zhishi\u2019s face and double checked his heart rate. \u201cDid you just have an asthma attack? You just used your inhaler, right?\u201dYue Zhishi nodded his head a bit blankly. He didn\u2019t know how Song Yu appeared all of a sudden right at this very moment; he\u2019d clearly said he would be back after two days. Yue Zhishi gazed at his face, lost in a small trance.It looked like the dream was flipped \u2014 it was actually him who was found.\u201cSong Yu.\u201d Yue Zhishi called out his name so, so softly. \u201cHow are you here?\u201d He eased over gently to kiss Song Yu\u2019s lips, as though he was dreaming.Even though the Christmas tree was so shabby it didn\u2019t have a single star, it still granted his wish so very generously.The author has something to say:Gege wasn\u2019t at Changsha, he flew over there specifically. Le Le stayed there for a good few hoursThey won\u2019t have their photos taken and spread on the internet, they also won\u2019t be seen by people they know. The probability of that stuff happening is too low hhh (don\u2019t pull out knives for yourselves, okay? Be good and give me the blades in your hands~)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 75: The Status of LoverYue Zhishi thought his brain must\u2019ve been utterly fogged up from his asthma attack to have kissed Song Yu in front of everyone in public.His breathing had still yet to completely even out, and he was still very weak; he looked a bit pitiful when he pulled away. He was still very flustered, so he coughed again a few times, as though he really hoped the people around them didn\u2019t see the foolish thing he\u2019d done. He hoped Song Yu wouldn\u2019t be harassed.But Song Yu hugged him, face to face, and stroked his hand up and down the back of Yue Zhishi\u2019s head and his nape in comfort. \u201cEverything\u2019s okay now.\u201d Reaching out, he picked up the cup of water on the floor and helped Yue Zhishi stand up, supporting him with his arms; he then said to the staff member gawking by the side, \u201cI apologise for my boyfriend\u2019s asthma attack affecting your work. I\u2019d like a cup of hot water with some sugar, please.\u201dThe staff member initially stared at him blankly before immediately nodding. \u201cNo problem. Please take a seat first.\u201dSong Yu supported Yue Zhishi over to a sofa booth and then kissed his forehead. \u201cWait here for me.\u201dHe hurried over to the display counter they were just in front of and knelt down to pick up all of the items Yue Zhishi had spilled over the floor. He checked the medicine Yue Zhishi had brought with him, directly punching out the correct dosage of pills from the aluminium foil, and pushed both Yue Zhishi\u2019s luggage and backpack over to him after packing everything up.Yue Zhishi was resting on top of the table, and he looked very helpless and miserable to Song Yu. He walked over, sat next to Yue Zhishi and tugged him into his arms, smoothing a hand down his back.\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten anything yet. What made you allergic?\u201d Song Yu softly asked.Yue Zhishi pushed his face into Song Yu\u2019s shoulder, feeling Song Yu\u2019s slightly damp coat. \u201cI was very unlucky and accidentally bumped into the man carrying in flour. Actually, only a little bit of flour flew into the air, but I just so happened to breathe it in.\u201d His voice still sounded somewhat weak and breathless, and Song Yu seemed to really notice it \u2014 he hugged him with very gentle arms.\u201cIt\u2019s good you listen and bring your meds with you wherever you go.\u201d Song Yu touched Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair and gave him the pills in his hand. \u201cAny other allergic reactions?\u201d\u201cNot so far.\u201d Yue Zhishi shook his head.Song Yu was wearing a black coat, and Yue Zhishi noticed there were many, almost imperceptible, water droplets on his woollen coat. It looked like he\u2019d gone through a drizzle, and that reminded him \u2014 Song Yu shouldn\u2019t have appeared here right at this very moment.\u201cWeren\u2019t you in the northwest? You said you\u2019d come back two days from now.\u201d\u201cI also said that was the original plan. The rest of the people in the research team wanted to stay and travel for a few days as a group, but I thought I\u2019d better come back earlier. After you later said you were going to Guangzhou and gave me your flight number, I decided to head there as well.\u201d Song Yu was lightly patting his back. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t buy tickets for the earliest flight towards Guangzhou. I was worried something would happen after seeing all the news about the typhoon, so I called the airline. They told me your flight was going to be diverted.\u201d\u201cLuckily enough, it was really easy to buy a plane ticket to Changsha so I flew here directly.\u201dSong Yu spoke in a particularly calm \u2014 even flat \u2014 voice about how he\u2019d made his decision after so many unexpected events. He completely avoided talking about why he\u2019d left his work early and travelled over to Changsha; he looked like he was just here for work, and was much calmer than the other travellers with their journeys delayed.\u201cNo wonder I couldn\u2019t call through to you,\u201d Yue Zhishi said. Song Yu had been on the plane. He leaned on Song Yu\u2019s body and asked in a muffled voice, \u201cWhat if I\u2019d left? You would\u2019ve travelled over for no reason.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have. You temporarily can\u2019t go to Guangzhou, and there was a high probability of you waiting in the airport after the flight was delayed instead of choosing to take another travel method. You\u2019re not in that much of a rush.\u201dHe was like a machine calculating predictions. \u201cAfter the airline company informed everyone of the flight delays, you would\u2019ve stayed in the airport, watched a few episodes of anime, ate something and then continued to wait.\u201dAll correct.Yue Zhishi sniffled, pulling away from Song Yu\u2019s arms, and suddenly noticed the girl sitting at the table diagonally across from them was staring in their direction \u2014 he only then realised his and Song Yu\u2019s actions seemed to be overly intimate. But he didn\u2019t retreat a distance away, only rather obstinately saying to Song Yu, \u201cSo you would rather risk a wasted journey instead of telling me you were coming over.\u201dAfter staying quiet for two seconds, Song Yu revealed a very rarely seen expression: he looked like he couldn\u2019t understand what was happening. The staff member from earlier now came over with a cup of hot sugar water and even gifted them a hot Americano.Yue Zhishi gave her his thanks and also said he\u2019d troubled them. The staff member was very frightened. \u201cNot at all, it was really our fault. Our shop\u2019s being renovated so we couldn\u2019t open the back door. Our delivery person also missed two bags of flour this morning, which is why he was here just then. It was too dangerous.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Yue Zhishi smiled at her.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re okay, I was so scared.\u201d She looked at Song Yu as she spoke and couldn\u2019t help but praise, \u201cYour boyfriend honestly feels so reliable.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d After hiding it for long, Yue Zhishi was very much unused to other people knowing about their relationship. He became a bit bashful, not knowing what to say. \u201c\u2026thank you.\u201d\u201cThe two of you really match each other.\u201d The staff member acted like a young girl, covering half her face with her tray. \u201cI won\u2019t bother you guys anymore, please let me know if you need anything.\u201d\u201cWe will.\u201d Yue Zhishi watched as she left, immersed in the delight of someone praising Song Yu as reliable. He carefully lifted up his cup and drank some water, throwing his pills into his mouth as well.He\u2019d yet to swallow when he heard Song Yu belatedly ask, \u201cYou\u2019d like it more if I told you ahead of time?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d Yue Zhishi had just taken a large sip of water, and his cheeks were puffed up; he widened his eyes and blinked at Song Yu in confusion.\u201cMe suddenly showing up \u2014 you don\u2019t like it?\u201d Song Yu asked again.Yue Zhishi quickly swallowed his pills and then shook his head, worriedly saying not at all. \u201cI just found it strange why you didn\u2019t tell me. What if you arrived and I wasn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Halfway through his words, looking like he\u2019d realised something, he abruptly froze, and he touched Song Yu\u2019s arm with a hand.\u201cGege, did you want to give me a surprise?\u201d Yue Zhishi slanted his head.Song Yu suddenly coughed, turning his head away to drink some water. He still didn\u2019t look at Yue Zhishi even after he put down the cup. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to tell you.\u201dYue Zhishi stared at him for a while and then unexpectedly threw himself into Song Yu\u2019s arms very happily. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cI originally thought there wouldn\u2019t be any issues with me going to Guangzhou by myself. It would\u2019ve been fine if you didn\u2019t come, I would\u2019ve just had to work a bit harder with a lot more small inconveniences.\u201d With his arms around Song Yu, Yue Zhishi raised his head and looked at him with very sincere eyes. \u201cBut now that you\u2019re here, I don\u2019t even mind the small inconveniences.\u201dHe\u2019d thought after his attack eased, he would\u2019ve had to awkwardly clean up his mess, leave the store and then continue to wait, to board his flight \u2014 to head towards an unfamiliar city all by himself.But Song Yu didn\u2019t allow any of that to happen.Even though he was so very clumsy and had no way to admit he\u2019d wanted to surprise him, there was no one else like him who would always immediately arrive at Yue Zhishi\u2019s side.Song Yu hugged him back, his body finally relaxing.He\u2019d only just gotten off his plane when he called Yue Zhishi. He\u2019d thought they would see each other very soon, and his heart had been overflowing with sweet pleasure. He had taken only a few steps when he heard the sound of coughing through the phone.He\u2019d already forgotten how he\u2019d madly, wildly run over \u2014 how he\u2019d desperately and frantically searched for the cake shop Yue Zhishi had mentioned. He must\u2019ve looked so messy and panicked and very unlike himself.\u201cI don\u2019t want any inconveniences. I don\u2019t like them.\u201d Lowering his head, Song Yu kissed the top of his head.They took a short rest, and then the two of them left the airport. Flights were severely affected by the weather, and since Song Yu was worried about flight safety, he bought bullet train tickets from Changsha to Guangzhou for slightly later that day. They went to the hospital near the train station for Yue Zhishi to be given a last minute injection, and they didn\u2019t have enough time to eat. Song Yu busied himself with buying Yue Zhishi some\u00a0rice soaked in meat broth\u00a0and\u00a0sugar oil rice cake, staying next to Yue Zhishi in the hospital injection room as he finished the food.\u201cThis one\u2019s yummy, sticky and chewy. Really sweet.\u201d Yue Zhishi attempted to feed Song Yu, but Song Yu dodged away.\u201cIt\u2019s too sweet.\u201d Song Yu told him to finish all of it by himself.His allergic rash had faded mostly away, but the side effects of his allergy meds left him woozy with some slight chills. But Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t feel sad because of his attack \u2014 in this foreign place, he could keep holding Song Yu\u2019s hand. No one knew how convoluted their relationship was.The typhoon, the torrential rain, the unexpected emergency landing \u2014 all of these accidents weaved together a perfect escape plan, letting him and Song Yu temporarily flee from the title of \u2018brothers\u2019. They could be an uncomplicated pair of lovers, indifferent to the eyes of others.There were a lot of people on the bullet train, and because Song Yu had purchased their tickets so hastily, their two seats weren\u2019t next to each other. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t say anything, and yet Song Yu towed their two luggages to the front and even took the initiative to look for the person meant to sit next to Yue Zhishi. It was a young girl, and while Song Yu had always hated trouble, he asked very mildly if he could switch seats with her.After seeing Song Yu\u2019s face, the girl was slightly awed and somewhat shy. \u201cYou want to sit in my seat?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Song Yu shifted slightly, turning his body sideways so she could see Yue Zhishi. \u201cWe didn\u2019t buy seats next to each other.\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes brightened the moment she saw Yue Zhishi, and she stood up very quickly. \u201cThen your seat is?\u201d\u201c12A, the one next to the window.\u201dTheir seats were actually all in the same row, and she swiftly agreed and moved over, continuously waving her hand in dismissal when Song Yu expressed his gratitude.Song Yu had Yue Zhishi sit down next to the window, and he put away their luggages, taking off his large coat and draping it over Yue Zhishi\u2019s body.\u201cI\u2019ve always been really curious. Why don\u2019t bullet trains have E seats?\u201d Underneath the carriage lights, Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair looked very soft, and it faintly shimmered with gold.\u201cI think they\u2019re meant to be the same as airplane seating.\u201d Song Yu sat down as well. There wasn\u2019t quite enough space in a second class seat, and so his legs couldn\u2019t really stretch out; he was really not used to it.Nodding, Yue Zhishi said in Japanese, \u201cI see.\u201d His hands, hidden under Song Yu\u2019s coat, were sneakily moving around. He pushed away his armrest and then went to look for Song Yu\u2019s, but because he touched Song Yu\u2019s arm first, he conveniently gave that forearm a squeeze.He was just about to push away Song Yu\u2019s armrest as well when the girl from earlier stood up and headed in their direction. Yue Zhishi lifted his eyes, looked at her and saw her press her lips together and say to Song Yu, \u201cUm, excuse me, is it okay if I add your WeChat?\u201dSong Yu only then raised his head to look at her, but the carriage was very noisy \u2014 his whole attention had been on Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand, and he didn\u2019t hear a single thing she\u2019d said. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to add your WeChat.\u201d The girl was a bit embarrassed. \u201cIf I can.\u201dIf he hadn\u2019t just switched seats with her, Song Yu might\u2019ve rejected her as coldly as he usually did. But he was in a bit of a difficult situation right now: he guessed that if he rejected her, there might be a decent chance of her asking to change their seats back.Compared to sitting together with Yue Zhishi, exchanging WeChat details was nothing.Song Yu was just about to take out his phone when Yue Zhishi abruptly tossed away the coat. He spoke neither loudly nor softly, but he said to that girl very frankly, \u201cHe\u2019s my boyfriend.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s first reaction was to cover Yue Zhishi back up with his coat, realising only after what Yue Zhishi had said \u2014 he twisted his face over to look at him with some surprise.Instantly, the look on the girl\u2019s face turned slightly awkward; her eyes swept over Yue Zhishi and Song Yu twice, and she asked, still not quite sure, \u201c\u2026really?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s light-coloured eyes glowed under the lights. The words that came out of his mouth were very blunt, yet they intriguingly left others with no way to refuse them. \u201cCan you not ask him for his WeChat? I\u2019ll get jealous.\u201dSong Yu threw him a glance. \u201cYou will?\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d Yue Zhishi pursed his lips and smiled at him. The corners of Song Yu\u2019s mouth gently curved upwards a bit as well, but he used his formidable strength of will to turn them back down.As she watched them, the girl understood and prepared to leave after saying\u00a0sorry for disturbing you. Yue Zhishi hurriedly called out and gave her the mango mousse he\u2019d bought from the cake store; he felt slightly better only after she started smiling again.\u201cThat was my first time doing something like that.\u201d He pushed away Song Yu\u2019s armrest and leaned against him. He said very quietly, \u201cI hope she won\u2019t be unhappy.\u201dSong Yu simply found him adorable, so he chuckled.\u201cWhat are you laughing about?\u201d\u201cNothing. I just thought you\u2019re really like one of those small dogs who bark and bother other people only when next to their owners.\u201dYue Zhishi wasn\u2019t very satisfied with Song Yu\u2019s description of him; he got up from his shoulder and turned to face Song Yu. \u201cI\u2019m not that bad.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Song Yu caressed Yue Zhishi\u2019s chin.The train started moving, and Yue Zhishi spoke to Song Yu softly, his words going in circles. He stealthily pulled Song Yu\u2019s hand underneath the coat and fiddled with it.\u201cThe staff member from the cake shop said we really match each other,\u201d Yue Zhishi whispered. \u201cDid you hear?\u201dSong Yu shook his head \u2014 at that time, he\u2019d been lost in his frustration at failing to surprise Yue Zhishi and hadn\u2019t heard a single thing.But he quickly said, \u201cBut I agree with her.\u201dYue Zhishi was amused by his serious words and pinched Song Yu\u2019s hand. \u201cWhy do you agree?\u201dIt was just a casual question, and he hadn\u2019t hoped to get any real answer \u2014 but Song Yu actually responded. \u201cAccording to people\u2019s current widespread beliefs, there are a few criteria for whether two people suit each other. Looks, body, education, income and family background.\u201dHe answered as though he was earnestly completing an academic question, strictly analysing each criteria one by one. \u201cLooks and body both belong to aesthetic taste with no standard answer\u2026\u201d\u201cI really like your face,\u201d Yue Zhishi softly interjected.Turning to look at him, Song Yu raised an eyebrow. \u201cOnly my face?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi then said, still softly, \u201cAnd your body.\u201dSong Yu seemed to be a bit more satisfied at that answer. Yue Zhishi shifted back onto Song Yu and asked in a very faint voice, \u201cThen do you think I look nice?\u201dYue Zhishi was very close to him when he asked that question, the fine, soft down on his cheeks visible. His western bone structure mingled well with the smooth, delicate skin of Asian background, and when he blinked, his brown eyes, layered with dense yet long eyelashes, gave him a kind of uncommon innocence.Asking a question like that with that face\u2026\u201cI don\u2019t know if you look nice or not,\u201d Song Yu deliberately said.He laughed when he saw Yue Zhishi\u2019s hurt puppy dog eyes. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know yourself at all.\u201dThat pretty much meant Song Yu thought he was good-looking and liked his looks, so Yue Zhishi cheered up again very quickly.Song Yu continued calculating. \u201cEducation \u2014 we\u2019re from the same schools. Income \u2014 even though you don\u2019t have any right now, you\u2019re going to be a lawyer in the future. Your income should be relatively impressive. And it\u2019s not like my future income won\u2019t be enough to keep you.\u201dYue Zhishi really liked the word \u2018keep\u2019; he stroked Song Yu\u2019s arm with great cheer.\u201cAs for family background\u2026\u201dAt that final criteria, both of them simultaneously fell silent for a few seconds, and then Song Yu chuckled like he was laughing at himself. \u201cIf your father were still around, we would be considered as old family friends. Since your dad\u2019s not here, then our family background is from the same family \u2014 and so on a certain level, we could be considered as having the same status.\u201dYue Zhishi lifted his head, looking at him, and bent his head onto Song Yu\u2019s shoulder with significant emotional attachment.\u201cLooking at it like that, then we truly do suit each other, don\u2019t we?\u201dHe cared more about Song Yu\u2019s feelings than anything else. As for those metrics \u2014 they were just inconsequential fun.This escape, destined to head straight into a wild storm, wasn\u2019t suited for anxious hearts.Streaks of rain once again appeared outside the carriage windows, and in the pitch black night, the strands of rain that landed on the glass shone the brightest. Sleepily, drowsily, Yue Zhishi rested on Song Yu\u2019s shoulder and told him it had also been like this earlier that day on the plane \u2014 it had been raining, and there had been so many people.\u201cThe plane was so bumpy. I was so scared.\u201dSong Yu stroked his face, helping him pull up the coat that had slid down.\u201cI thought about that airplane disaster movie we\u2019d watched together.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that serious,\u201d Song Yu said. \u201cFlight diversion is very common.\u201dYue Zhishi thought about how he\u2019d felt at that time. A lingering fear still remained in his heart \u2014 he knew Song Yu would think he was being very childish, very immature, but Yue Zhishi had an inherent fear of disaster.\u201cI thought the aircrew would give me a will. I\u2019d already thought about what to write.\u201dTo be more precise, he\u2019d already written a rough draft in his phone.Song Yu thought he was really cute, but once he truly thought about it, he felt scared, even somewhat heartbroken \u2014 he didn\u2019t want to come across as caring too much, so he pretended and said in a relatively relaxed voice, \u201cWhat did you want to write?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d In his heart, Yue Zhishi flicked through that very simple will and picked something that didn\u2019t appear all that important. He told Song Yu, \u201cI have over $13,000 RMB savings in total in my phone and bank card. But I still owe $2,000 in monthly payments. Please help me repay that, or else I won\u2019t be able to die in peace. The leftover money should be split into three equal portions and given to you, Aunt Rong and Uncle.\u201d\u201cThe sketchbooks you gave me \u2014 the two of them. Can you burn them for me? Even though I know it\u2019s really superstitious, but I want to have those two things. I don\u2019t have to have anything else.\u201d And then, Yue Zhishi considered a little bit. \u201cI don\u2019t know if those superstitions are believable or not. If I don\u2019t receive them after they\u2019ve been burned, then it would\u2019ve been an utter waste.\u201dAt certain times, Yue Zhishi would always be both innocent and cruel. Song Yu didn\u2019t really want to keep listening, so he didn\u2019t say a single thing.Or maybe he should ask Yue Zhishi \u2014 when he imagined himself possibly dying, did he think about him.Other than money, did he think about leaving anything else to him.And very tacitly, Yue Zhishi stopped speaking as well. He stretched out a hand and wrote the \u2018yu\u2019 character in Song Yu\u2019s name on the glass window before wiping it away with his fingers. The conversation jumped to what they should eat tomorrow, and he told Song Yu he\u2019d read many guides on what to eat in Guangzhou before he\u2019d left; he chattered away, and in the end, he grew tired and fell asleep on Song Yu\u2019s body.Time flowed so slowly after he fell asleep. Underneath the coat, Song Yu clutched Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand tightly, as though he could feel a bit more reassured that way.No one would take something like that seriously, except for Song Yu. He thought he\u2019d long gotten used to the possibility of losing Yue Zhishi at any given moment \u2014 but now he realised, he hadn\u2019t.There was still one more stop until Guangzhou. Yue Zhishi\u2019s phone suddenly vibrated, and he refused to wake up despite it bothering him. Song Yu could only release his hand and go searching for Yue Zhishi\u2019s phone; he finally found it in the pocket of Yue Zhishi\u2019s coat. The screen was lit up \u2014 it was Yue Zhishi\u2019s alarm.He really liked using alarms as a method to remind himself to do something. Song Yu helped him turn it off, but after only thirty seconds, a new alarm rang.He really liked setting multiple alarms one after another.Because of the noise, Yue Zhishi was no longer resting on Song Yu, shifting himself towards the window. Song Yu had no choice but to type in the password and unlock the phone, turning off all five consecutive alarms.When he was swiping back out, he accidentally hit one of the apps running in the background, and it just so happened to be a memo Yue Zhishi had written. Song Yu knew he shouldn\u2019t pry into his privacy, but he still read it.The entire memo wasn\u2019t long, only a few lines. But the title of it was the single word of \u2018will\u2019, and it was entirely something Yue Zhishi would do.Song Yu immediately saw the last few sentences.[I know we\u2019re required to be cremated, but if there are any ashes left, please give them to Mr. Song Yu. I\u2019ve written his phone number at the very top \u2014 you can contact him.I\u2019m not sure about inheritance rules, but I have no immediate family members. He is my lover.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 76: Early InheritanceThey\u2019d taken the last bullet train for the day, and by the time they reached Guangzhou, it was already close to midnight.Yue Zhishi had just woken up when they got off the train, and he was still very woozy, half wrapped in Song Yu\u2019s arms the entire time they were exiting the station.Thinking of sending Jiang Yufan a message, he reached out and groped for his phone. That was strange.He thought his phone had been in his left pocket earlier.People were everywhere in the passageways, scurrying and rushing to where they needed to go. Yue Zhishi lifted his head with bleary eyes and saw a man in front of him with his bag unzipped; a small black pouch inside was about to topple out. Yue Zhishi told Song Yu where he was going and quickly ran over, managing to catch the pouch just in time.\u201cHey.\u201d Yue Zhishi gave the man a pat on the shoulder. He handed the pouch in his hand over to the man once he turned around. \u201cYour stuff fell.\u201dThe man first profusely thanked him, and then a look of surprise covered his face when he looked at Yue Zhishi. \u201cAren\u2019t you that mixed handsome boy from the flight?\u201dYue Zhishi only then realised the man was the same person who\u2019d sat next to him on the plane. He gave him a smile and said, \u201cWhat a coincidence. We even took the same bullet train.\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m so thankful for you, this pouch has all of my identification documents. It would\u2019ve been a mess if I lost it.\u201d The man placed the pouch back into his bag and securely zipped it up. \u201cHandsome guy, is there someone picking you up here? Let me take you to where you need to go.\u201dYue Zhishi subconsciously looked back and saw Song Yu pushing their luggages over. \u201cNo need, no need. You should go do what you\u2019re here for.\u201d\u201cThen please make sure you look for me if you need any help.\u201d The man took out a business card from his pocket and gave it to him, looking quite tired and worn out as he left.\u201cWho was that?\u201d Song Yu spoke mildly, yet he promptly reached out and took away the card in Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand. He lowered his eyes and said, voice appraising, \u201c\u2026Zhou Chengwei from Mingshang Company Ltd. And even a vice president.\u201d\u201cHe was next to me on the plane.\u201d Yue Zhishi caught Song Yu\u2019s arm and said, voice very docile and pliant, \u201cGege, I\u2019m so sleepy.\u201dSong Yu stored the business card in the outer layer of Yue Zhishi\u2019s backpack and took him out of the station.It was raining extremely heavily outside, but it wasn\u2019t cold. The rain fell noisily and loudly, and the stream of people leaving the station was also very chaotic. Song Yu was in the middle of the crowd \u2014 and yet he stood out because of how overly calm and controlled he was.He held open a black umbrella, gathering Yue Zhishi into his arms. They got onto a taxi he\u2019d ordered earlier and headed towards the hotel he\u2019d booked while they were on the bullet train.The rain was so intense it was as though it was being poured onto the car windows. The bright neon lights of the city outside the windows were obscured, blurred into soft glowing circles of brightness. Yue Zhishi gazed out, his hand covering the back of Song Yu\u2019s slightly chilled hand.Using very accented Mandarin, the taxi driver chatted with them, asking if they\u2019d come to Guangzhou to play, and Yue Zhishi occasionally replied to his attempts at conversation. He turned his face over towards Song Yu\u2019s direction and saw dark water stains blotched over the shoulder of Song Yu\u2019s coat.The friendly local driver told them where to go for the best roast goose, what places liked to cheat tourists and even praised the hotel they\u2019d booked as being very decent.Yue Zhishi only understood why the driver said the hotel was very decent after he got off the car, saw the financial centre building with its one hundred-plus floors and followed Song Yu into the elevator. They arrived at the magnificent large lobby of a luxury hotel.\u201cWhy\u2019d you book such an expensive hotel?\u201d Yue Zhishi carried his own luggage towards the steps, but he\u2019d only gone up two of them when Song Yu took his luggage from him.Song Yu said, \u201cYou should ask yourself instead why you didn\u2019t book a hotel when going out of town.\u201d\u201cI just thought there\u2019d be time for me to find one after I arrived.\u201d Yue Zhishi had originally wanted to eat at a very famous local restaurant after his flight landed before considering where to live. He didn\u2019t think his plan would be so ruined.Song Yu didn\u2019t continue speaking and lugged their luggages towards the reception.There were almost no other people in the hotel lobby in the middle of the night. Song Yu took out his and Yue Zhishi\u2019s identification documents and gave them to the female receptionist on duty. Yue Zhishi sat on top of the luggages, first lifting a hand to observe the small water droplets left on his coat, and then raised his head to peer around everywhere. He reached out a hand to touch the small potted plant sitting on the reception desk.Not long after, the revolving door behind them turned again. Two men came in, looking like they\u2019d had some alcohol; they staggered in, supporting each other as they entered. Yue Zhishi spun around on his luggage and looked at them \u2014 he felt they were really like scraps of paper stuck to each other due to static electricity, wobbling here and lurching there and yet unable to come apart.For some reason, the system couldn\u2019t immediately find the room Song Yu had booked. The receptionist asked them to wait and got up to look for her manager, and the other male receptionist attended to the two newly arrived guests.Yue Zhishi watched the two of them with his head tilted sideways. He realised they were wearing matching earrings and necklaces, and even their clothes were very similar. Their lowered arms were left intimately next to each to each other, the backs of their hands grazing; it took some difficulty for their hands to find each other, but they very quickly separated.\u201cDo you have a room with a king bed?\u201d asked one of the men, his head curved onto the other\u2019s shoulder. His words were a bit slurred from the alcohol. \u201cI want one with a window.\u201d\u201cWe do. Please wait.\u201d The male receptionist took their identification documents and rapidly processed them, offering out their room card with both hands.The female receptionist helping Song Yu and Yue Zhishi with their booking finally returned and apologised to them. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, there was something wrong with the system. We can upgrade your booking to a double bed business suite with a balcony for free. It\u2019ll have two rooms.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s hand was resting on the marble desk, and he rejected coldly, \u201cNo need. The previous one\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dThe two young men next to them stumbled towards the elevator, holding each other up. Yue Zhishi was like a small animal who\u2019d had his attention caught, gazing at them as he spun the luggage underneath him in the same direction they walked towards.The male receptionist who\u2019d helped them check-in smiled profoundly and hinted at that couple\u2019s relationship towards his female colleague. \u201cTsk tsk, king size bed.\u201dThe female receptionist was actually helping Song Yu with a room with a king bed at this very moment, and she raised her head a bit awkwardly, meeting Song Yu\u2019s eyes. She then elbowed her colleague very apologetically and offered the room card to Song Yu. \u201cThis is your room card. If there\u2019s anything you need, please let us know. We\u2019ll send up your luggage for you.\u201dYue Zhishi was somewhat lost, his eyes flickering back and forth among the three of them. He saw Song Yu\u2019s cold eyes, and so he stood up in confusion.\u201cDo expensive hotels have a check-in condition that say two men can\u2019t book a room with a king size bed?\u201d Taking the room card, Song Yu looked towards the male receptionist. The look on the man\u2019s face changed, and he went speechless.The female receptionist apologised again. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, there might be a misunderstanding. He wasn\u2019t referring to you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a misunderstanding.\u201d There was no expression on Song Yu\u2019s face. He was immaculately dressed, and he looked both dignified and impersonal \u2014 yet the words that left his mouth left both workers completely stunned.\u201cWe have the same relationship as those two men do.\u201dThe entire way into the elevator, Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t speak. Song Yu looked at him through the reflection on the glass walls, heart slightly hesitant, and finally couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cDo you think I was too harsh?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d It was like Yue Zhishi had to pull himself from somewhere else in his mind. He looked at Song Yu, eyes confused. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dSong Yu took a step towards him, leaning in very closely. \u201cWhat are you zoning out about?\u201dYue Zhishi then stretched out his hands towards him, like a small child who\u2019d accidentally done something wrong and was now admitting his mistake to an adult; he unfolded his palms \u2014 there was a leaf lying in them.\u201cI thought it was a fake plant and accidentally plucked it off,\u201d he said very softly to Song Yu, both his hands holding up that soft and fragile leaf.A laugh burst from Song Yu \u2014 he laughed at the reason for Yue Zhishi being so distracted and laughed at himself for being so oversensitive.\u201cStop laughing at me.\u201d Yue Zhishi asked him, \u201cDo you think that plant was expensive? It shouldn\u2019t be, right.\u201dThe elevator released a light\u00a0ding, and its doors slowly slid open.Song Yu walked out with a faint smile on his face and deliberately teased him, \u201cI think it\u2019s a really rare plant. You should use your savings to pay them back.\u201dYue Zhishi followed behind him, sounding utterly wronged. \u201cNo way, it took me a really long time to save all that money. I didn\u2019t even spend a single cent from last year\u2019s Lunar New Year money\u2026\u201dThey headed down the corridor. When they reached the end, Song Yu used the room card to open the door, taking off his coat and hanging it in the closet at the entrance.Just as Yue Zhishi took a step into the room, all the lights in the entire room lit up at the same time. The room was mainly beige and caramel colours, and once it was illuminated by the warm lighting, it looked homely, warm and comforting.The room was very spacious, roughly around seventy square metres, and there was a glass window stretched from ceiling to floor behind the fluffy and soft-looking large bed. With the window misted by a layer of transparent rainwater, the night view of the Zhujiang River and Canton Tower was hazy yet resplendent \u2014 every single drip of water shimmered with kaleidoscopic colours.\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d Yue Zhishi took off his own coat, and he explored the warm room dressed in his white shirt. He noticed the bathroom had a super large bathtub, and it too had a ceiling to floor window. \u201cI definitely wouldn\u2019t live in a hotel like this by myself.\u201dSong Yu headed towards him, and leaned against the sink in the roomy bathroom. He stood with his two legs relaxed and said something very taunting without any mockery in his voice. \u201cYou can stay here for five days with your savings.\u201dSeeing Yue Zhishi pivot his head around and stare at him with large, shocked eyes, Song Yu found him extremely adorable and opened his arms to him. \u201cCome here.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive,\u201d Yue Zhishi rambled, but he obediently left the bathtub and walked towards Song Yu. He stood in between Song Yu\u2019s legs, his head sweetly lowered, and grabbed Song Yu\u2019s hands. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to stay somewhere so nice. Those family suites we used to stay in when we were travelling were great too.\u201d\u201cYou mean the kind we used to live in with my mom and dad?\u201d Song Yu tipped his head a bit to the side, his mouth crooking up; he pulled Yue Zhishi even closer until he could kiss Yue Zhishi as soon as he lifted his head. \u201cBut they\u2019re not here right now.\u201dThose words weren\u2019t all that suggestive, yet when they were spoken by Song Yu, Yue Zhishi\u2019s face started to heat up, vaguely sensing Song Yu was acting a lot more intimately now compared to during the day.\u201cYes, they\u2019re not here\u2026\u201d He suddenly realised something and blinked. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019re staying in a hotel with just the two of us.\u201dSong Yu nodded at Yue Zhishi\u2019s words. \u201cYes.\u201dWhich was why they needed to stay in the best.Yue Zhishi removed the glasses on Song Yu\u2019s nose and placed them on top of the black marble sink. He then rested his two hands on Song Yu\u2019s neck, very affectionately and lovingly leaning his head onto Song Yu\u2019s forehead. \u201cHow many days did you book? Can I pay for tomorrow?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s hands were holding onto the back of Yue Zhishi\u2019s waist, and he rubbed the tip of his nose against Yue Zhishi\u2019s, inhaling the sweet smell of something like fruit candy.\u201cDon\u2019t use my inheritance so casually.\u201dYue Zhishi was amused by his joke so seriously spoken and gave his face a quick smooch. \u201cIt\u2019s all for you, okay? I\u2019ll use just this little bit.\u201d And then, he dropped his eyes, his eyelashes casting a shadow. \u201cI was originally saving it to buy you a present anyway.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t comprehend and asked him why he needed to buy a present.\u201cIt\u2019s almost your birthday.\u201d Yue Zhishi thought he was almost like an academic machine that had no joy or interest in life, even able to completely forget his own birthday. \u201cNovember 1st.\u201d He then abruptly felt a bit of regret, saying, \u201cShould I have not told you, it would\u2019ve been a surprise that way.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s hands were clasping the sides of Yue Zhishi\u2019s waist, and he didn\u2019t show all that much interest in his birthday surprise. He only said, head lowering, \u201cWe can still celebrate it early.\u201d\u201cYou really like celebrating early.\u201dWhat I like is celebrating with you alone. Song Yu didn\u2019t say it out loud, and then he heard Yue Zhishi say, \u201cA few days ago, I looked at the stars and saw Scorpius\u2019s tail.\u201dHe said to Song Yu quite certainly, \u201cI should\u2019ve seen it correctly, I even took a photo of it and connected the constellation lines. It was Scorpius.\u201d\u201cJiang Yufan said Scorpios are all really cold and heartless, but I don\u2019t think you are.\u201d Yue Zhishi had even spent over an hour online researching the sign. \u201cI later looked it up, and Scorpios are described as really\u2026\u201dHearing his words pause, Song Yu raised his eyes and looked at him. \u201cReally what?\u201d\u201cMysterious, devious, very dominating and strongly possessive, have a strong sense of responsibility, filled with vitality, jealous and\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes fluttered up, suddenly remembering, and said the final thing after meeting Song Yu\u2019s eyes with a bit of embarrassment, \u201c\u2026sexual.\u201dHe felt a hand gliding under his shirt and skimming over his skin. Yue Zhishi found it ticklish, so he dodged a bit away \u2014 but Song Yu kept a firm hold on his waist.\u201cDo you think it\u2019s accurate?\u201d Song Yu asked in a low voice.Yue Zhishi\u2019s back turned slightly numb from Song Yu\u2019s stroking movements. It was like there was a layer of electricity on his back, and even his face started to flush. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty accurate\u2026\u201dAs though he wasn\u2019t doing anything, Song Yu queried, \u201cWhich description\u2019s the most accurate?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re all very accurate.\u201d Yue Zhishi could feel a subtle chemical reaction in his body, but because he was completely surrounded by Song Yu, he had nowhere to escape.He was shocked by Song Yu\u2019s metal watchband, and he evaded away, softly saying, \u201cYour watch\u2019s really cold.\u201dSong Yu then pulled out his hand, still remaining in his position of leaning back against the sink with his legs relaxed, and lifted his wrist, smoothly unfastening the band.After a tiny metal sound, that old watch slid down as fluidly as water and slipped between his fingers \u2014 it was like a button down shirt that had just been peeled off and placed onto a chair.Somehow, Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart suddenly started to run considerably faster. He tried to pull his gaze away from Song Yu\u2019s hand, attempting to calm himself down.\u201cCan I have my inheritance early?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s dark eyes were focused on Yue Zhishi. He brought up his hand to ease his watch into the front pocket of Yue Zhishi\u2019s shirt.\u201cHuh?\u201d Yue Zhishi was in a daze, thinking Song Yu meant his birthday present savings. \u201cOf course you can. It\u2019s all yours.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t answer so quickly. I\u2019m referring to the part you didn\u2019t mention.\u201dSong Yu used one hand to undo the button at the very top of his own shirt once he finished speaking.\u201cYue Zhishi, I know you\u2019re afraid of disasters, but accidents happen very rarely. You won\u2019t leave this world that easily, so don\u2019t keep considering how you should pass on your ashes.\u201dYue Zhishi froze.How did he know\u2026\u201cRather than thinking about that, why don\u2019t you think more about your current self.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t understand what he was saying and blankly asked back, \u201cCurrent self? Why?\u201d\u201cBecause your lover is jealous, strongly possessive, very dominating and is filled with vitality, and he needs a partner who is very much alive.\u201dLifting a hand, Song Yu caught Yue Zhishi\u2019s chin and leaned in very, very closely \u2014 he wanted to kiss him, and yet he didn\u2019t, the distance between them caught on the edge.Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart was about to jump out of his chest, and his fingertips were tingling; all of the skin that Song Yu had touched was burning, trembling.He realised in that moment: he didn\u2019t want to leave behind only a useless handful of dust. He wanted to give to Song Yu the warmth of his body, his flowing, gushing blood and every single inch of his skin.No one knew what would happen tomorrow. But when the person he loved most was standing right in front of his eyes, he didn\u2019t want to have any kind of tragic ending.Their noses met, and Yue Zhishi could pretty much feel Song Yu\u2019s warm breaths. Just a little bit further \u2014 he was waiting for Song Yu to kiss him.But Song Yu didn\u2019t. He lifted his eyes and connected them with Yue Zhishi\u2019s own.\u201cSay, what do you think that couple from earlier are doing right now?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 77: Attack of Heavy RainSong Yu liked teasing Yue Zhishi since they\u2019d been children, because Yue Zhishi was pure, docile and unequivocally believed in him.No matter what he requested Yue Zhishi to do, Yue Zhishi would do it extremely happily and would even think being able to do something for him was an incomparable joy. When Song Yu realised this, he intentionally restrained his desire to ask for more \u2014 even though he truly longed to do so.He frequently worried over Yue Zhishi using such a pure heart to treat just anyone. Whenever he thought of that possibility, Song Yu became irritated, even agonised.Yue Zhishi had been born with a beautiful face that made people willing to get close to him and protect him; it lured you into intriguing, fanciful thoughts, yet it found any such conduct disgraceful. When he had been younger and secretly in love with Yue Zhishi, Song Yu had often felt anxious because of Yue Zhishi\u2019s displayed attachment to his older brother. If there was no way he could possess him, then Song Yu would rather Yue Zhishi never smile at him, never appear in front of him; he would rather they live like two completely unfamiliar strangers \u2014 and leave him a dignified way out.He\u2019d even gone as far to tell himself gloomily during sleepless nights: Yue Zhishi was actually a trap pretending to be innocent. The reliance, desire to please and warmth he displayed weren\u2019t targeted to anyone at all, and anyone who met him could also gain the illusion of being worshipped and loved. Wave after wave, everyone jumped in and was confined, just like him.On one hand, to an insane degree, he wanted to possess him; on the other hand, he kept continuously persuading himself to set Yue Zhishi free. For so many years, Song Yu\u2019s feelings had been so isolated from each other.And Yue Zhishi knew nothing of it.\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi practically breathed out his answer to Song Yu\u2019s question. He didn\u2019t know if his reaction was because he was feeling guilty for lying, or because he was nervous.He was clean like a piece of white paper. Any small movement from Song Yu could ramp up his temperature until he could be set on fire \u2014 the lightest touch, and he\u2019d ignite.Hearing Song Yu\u2019s question, Yue Zhishi inevitably had to think about that intimate couple and think about what they might be doing. But to be honest, he\u2019d already forgotten how they looked \u2014 all of the ardent and feverish visions in his mind contained only his and Song Yu\u2019s figures.They were overly close, the tips of their noses balanced against each other. The clean, pleasant-smelling fragrance on Song Yu\u2019s body bewitched Yue Zhishi and made him lean in closer; it was like a lure that was always guaranteed to succeed. His breathing grew uncontrollably heavier, and having not been able to wait for Song Yu\u2019s kiss, he couldn\u2019t help but press himself against Song Yu, attempting to fit their lips together.But Song Yu backed away.Confusion and the smallest bit of frustration appeared in Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes.\u201cAnswer my question.\u201d Song Yu stared at his eyes, voice exceptionally calm.Understanding that his intentionally vague answer didn\u2019t succeed, Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyelashes lowered before he lifted his eyes to look at Song Yu and said, faltering, \u201c\u2026doing adult things.\u201dThere was some amusement in Song Yu\u2019s deep eyes. He raised a hand, his eyes falling to Yue Zhishi\u2019s lips, and crooked his knuckle to lightly scrape at Yue Zhishi\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple.\u201cWhat about you?\u201dYue Zhishi opened his mouth, his heart about to surge out of his chest. Song Yu\u2019s hand stretched around his throat, the strength of it very light \u2014 the web between his thumb and index finger caught onto the side of his throat, and the pad of his thumb gently rubbed against Yue Zhishi\u2019s soft skin. \u201cDo you want to?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Yue Zhishi frankly admitted his own desire, easing over to press his lips against Song Yu\u2019s; this time, Song Yu didn\u2019t back away. The moment their lips merged together, Yue Zhishi\u2019s body faintly shivered. His hands went around Song Yu\u2019s neck by themselves, and he lowered his head, wanting to press himself even closer.He\u2019d eaten a piece of grapefruit flavoured candy earlier when they were waiting at the front reception desk, and it was now completely melted away. The residual sweet taste and pink colouring stained the tip of his tongue, and he used it to carefully, cautiously lick, trying to enter deeper. He didn\u2019t feel any resistance from Song Yu, so his tongue became a bit braver and touched the tip of Song Yu\u2019s tongue.Waves flowed in at the meeting of soft and damp flesh; the flavour of candy must be shared between lovers.Song Yu allowed Yue Zhishi to unskilfully kiss him and stroked Yue Zhishi\u2019s nape in encouragement. His other hand opened the lower buttons on Yue Zhishi\u2019s shirt, unfastening only three, and reached inside, gently brushing over the side of Yue Zhishi\u2019s delicate and soft waist.\u201cHow is your waist so thin\u2026\u201d Song Yu murmured in between their lips. His voice was low and deep, but his hand kept gliding upwards, pushing that white shirt up to Yue Zhishi\u2019s ribs.Even though he was skinny, Yue Zhishi still felt supple and pliant in his hands \u2014 it was a wonderful sensation.Song Yu\u2019s thumb reached the already hardened nibs on his chest. Yue Zhishi twitched away, releasing a very indistinct moan.Song Yu hadn\u2019t touched this area before. Even during their previous intimacy, he had only pressed kisses into Yue Zhishi\u2019s skin, leaving behind some marks, but Yue Zhishi was even more sensitive than he\u2019d imagined \u2014 he was helpless at these feelings. And yet he wanted to please Song Yu, just like the first time he\u2019d taken Song Yu into his mouth.Yue Zhishi\u2019s kiss became more needy, having gotten used to kissing with his tongue. Except the feeling of suffocation remained, especially when Song Yu\u2019s right hand was still wrapped around his throat as though that was the reason for his lack of air. The arteries in his neck pulsed actively as they kissed, steadily and continuously delivering warm blood under the pounding of his heart. Song Yu grasped it all in his hand.With only the fondling of Song Yu\u2019s hand, Yue Zhishi was already hard.His body started to weaken, and he sporadically called out gege during their long, wet kiss. He pitched entirely into Song Yu\u2019s arms.Song Yu pulled away his lips and tongue and gave him a very affectionate kiss on his nose. He smoothed a hand down Yue Zhishi\u2019s shuddering back like he was comforting him, but his movement had the opposite effect on Yue Zhishi.\u201cGege\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s light-coloured eyes were moist and very wide, and like a small animal\u2019s nose, his nose that\u2019d just been kissed was also damp. He leaned over, rubbing his lips against the corner of Song Yu\u2019s mouth like he was trying to coax him. \u201cCan we do it?\u201dThe answer he received was a dizzying, whirling embrace. Yue Zhishi was picked up, an arm under his legs and another around his back, and the ceiling\u2019s multicoloured sparks of light shined on him the entire way out of the bathroom until he was placed onto a soft bed. His pair of legs were half resting on the windowsill, and he felt faint and giddy from the glare of the room\u2019s overhead light.\u201cI should be asking a question like that.\u201d Song Yu stood by the bed and bent forward, the shadow of his body enveloping Yue Zhishi entirely.His kiss arrived like heavy rain, smooth, wet lips and tongues tangling together. Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t think, and he didn\u2019t know how the buttons on his shirt were undone \u2014 his pale, almost glowing chest was revealed, and Song Yu\u2019s long and slender fingers played with his pink, flushing nipples.He started to find it hard to breathe, letting out uncontainable whimpers as they kissed. Freeing him somewhat, Song Yu allowed Yue Zhishi to smoothly pull in air while he himself lowered his head, his lips caressing from Yue Zhishi\u2019s earlobe to the side of his neck. He continued all the way down to Yue Zhishi\u2019s chest, and everywhere on the pale skin seemed to turn pink.Yue Zhishi had never experienced something like this before, where he was delighted at even unbearable suffering.He hazily raised his chest, as though wanting to feed his nipples into Song Yu\u2019s mouth, but Song Yu didn\u2019t pause for long and trailed downwards until his mouth reached the edge of his pants.Feeling Song Yu was about to do something, Yue Zhishi slightly shrunk backwards onto the bed, but Song Yu grabbed his knees and pulled him back down.\u201cWhy are you running?\u201d Song Yu deftly opened Yue Zhishi\u2019s pants. The white cotton underwear was already stained, and Yue Zhishi reached out a hand to cover it \u2014 but Song Yu forcefully caught his wrist. With his head lowered, he kissed Yue Zhishi\u2019s cock through his underwear and asked as a reminder, \u201cAnd yet you weren\u2019t afraid when you were doing this yourself?\u201dYue Zhishi was panting, and he blocked his eyes with the back of his hands, feeling his underwear being pulled down.The instant his cock was swallowed, his entire body shook; the sensations openly charged straight towards his cerebral cortex, and it made him feel insecure. He reached out, wanting to touch Song Yu, and both of his hands ended up being controlled \u2014 he became a robot that could only import pleasure.\u201cGege\u2026 gege\u2026\u201d The mouth that could always kiss him until he was about to suffocate was currently devouring a part of his body, that moist space extracting out his desire.Yue Zhishi\u2019s scalp tingled every time he felt himself going in deep, but the higher his desire was fanned, the less he was able to be without Song Yu\u2019s embrace. So in the midst of his gasps, he continuously moaned, \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 hold me, I want you to hold me\u2026 please, gege, hold me\u2026\u201dSong Yu was half kneeling on the carpet and wasn\u2019t planning on getting up, but Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice sounded too pitiful \u2014 it was originally a good opportunity to tease him, but in the end, he wasn\u2019t able to harden his heart. Pulling away, he sucked Yue Zhishi\u2019s balls and the skin between them in a particularly lewd way; he left behind a deeply red mark, and then he took off Yue Zhishi\u2019s white canvas shoes for him before standing back up.Yue Zhishi blinked open his eyes in a daze. Song Yu was standing with his back against the light, and he was still clean and orderly in his black shirt and dress pants. It would be believable if someone said he was about to participate in a conference \u2014 but in reality, he was making love, and even extremely aggressively.He came up and pressed onto Yue Zhishi, his left hand seizing Yue Zhishi\u2019s lower jaw. He forced Yue Zhishi to kiss him with an open mouth, his tongue plundering and licking inside like a kiss from a pornographic film. Yue Zhishi was given what he wanted \u2014 he wrapped his arms around Song Yu, his snow white hands leaving behind scratch marks on Song Yu\u2019s shirt. His breathing had only marginally recovered when Song Yu once again caught his cock.Song Yu was kissing him so lustfully, so erotically while moving his hand up and down his cock \u2014 Yue Zhishi nearly drowned under Song Yu\u2019s body, filled with all those sensations.Sometimes, Song Yu really enjoyed how Yue Zhishi looked with his air as thin as a gossamer thread; he enjoyed watching him turn red in the face, on the verge of suffocating, and then rescuing and kissing him like a vulgar hero.\u201cGe\u2026 ge\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi pretty much couldn\u2019t say any continuous words anymore, only able to push out single syllables. His hands tightly clutched onto Song Yu\u2019s back, and his snow white knuckles were touched with pink from using too much force, as if they were going to shred through the black cloth in the next second.But they didn\u2019t. In the next second, his fingers abruptly slackened \u2014 because he came.He came onto Song Yu\u2019s dress pants, his body unable to stop trembling, but Song Yu didn\u2019t stop moving his hand. Song Yu didn\u2019t stop until translucent cum completely trickled over his fingers and hand, and nothing else came out from the opening of that pink flesh.Getting up slightly, he smeared the cum on his hand onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s face, as well as those full lips gently swollen from kissing.\u201cYue Zhishi, you came everywhere.\u201d His voice sounded a bit stern, as though he was blaming him. Those fingers coated with fluid were firmly pushed into Yue Zhishi\u2019s mouth, and they slowly thrust in and out, pressing against Yue Zhishi\u2019s tongue like they were simulating a blowjob. In a commanding voice, Song Yu said, \u201cLick them clean.\u201d\u201cMm\u2026.\u201d Yue Zhishi was extraordinarily docile after coming, and he licked Song Yu\u2019s slender fingers. He sucked them with as much effort as he would a piece of candy, from one finger to two, spit dribbling out of the corner of his mouth without him realising.He didn\u2019t know when Song Yu pulled out his hand, a glittering thread following after it.\u201cStill want to continue?\u201d Even though he could\u2019ve naturally carried on, Song Yu still asked.Torrential rain was once again pouring outside, and raindrops beat onto the ceiling to floor glass so high up in the air. The transparency, the suspension in midair \u2014 it was as though they were committing illicit sexual relations in the rain.\u201cYes.\u201d Yue Zhishi nodded in the midst of his pants. He wasn\u2019t satisfied with this kind of comfort; he needed a deeper union. He knew what that was.Whenever Yue Zhishi touched himself while thinking of Song Yu, he had already done it countless amount of times with Song Yu within his murky imagination.With his consciousness fuzzy from his orgasm, Yue Zhishi was stripped of his clothes. His pale skin dazzled the eyes underneath the lights, but every single joint was a pale pink colour except for a strip of purple on his knee that had yet to fade.Song Yu stared at Yue Zhishi. He was so contradictory \u2014 beautiful yet easily injured, traces from love and sex so effortlessly left behind. It was like he had been born with a human body that needed to be protected, and yet at the same time, it was suited for being cruelly treated.Still dazed, Yue Zhishi felt those fingers he\u2019d just sucked suddenly reach his butt, covered by a slippery paste. He opened his eyes in a bit of a fluster, and he saw an unopened condom in between Song Yu\u2019s teeth.His heart raced.One of Song Yu\u2019s hands was rubbing Yue Zhishi\u2019s entrance, while the other spread and held down his legs.The image simply just didn\u2019t match \u2014 Song Yu did the most obscene thing with his face that looked like it had no connection whatsoever with desire.\u201cGe\u2026 I want a kiss\u2026\u201dSong Yu\u2019s innate nature was no different from Yue Zhishi\u2019s; no matter how aggressive he was, his love for Yue Zhishi forever came first. He had no way of rejecting Yue Zhishi.His teeth opened, and that condom packet fell onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s soft belly, the jagged edges rasping against his skin.Song Yu kissed aggressively, and so were his commands \u2014 but he treated Yue Zhishi with the utmost patience and tenderness. He continuously used his kisses to lull and console Yue Zhishi as his fingers opened him up, telling him to\u00a0relax, don\u2019t be afraid. The fingers inside gradually delved deeper in exploration, searching for the bit that could excite Yue Zhishi.Sexual reliance was still reliance \u2014 Song Yu wanted to possess that as well.At first, Yue Zhishi was very nervous, finding the feeling of being stretched as very strange and breathlessly begged Song Yu to enter. \u201cDon\u2019t do that anymore, just come in, gege\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too tight, you won\u2019t be able to fit me,\u201d Song Yu said, adding in another finger. \u201cThis way it won\u2019t hurt when we do it.\u201dIn reality, Yue Zhishi was willing for Song Yu to hurt him. To him, any feeling Song Yu imposed on him was good.Fingers slid in and out, the white paste melting into soft pink flesh; Yue Zhishi weakly called out Song Yu\u2019s name, called him gege, and reached out a hand to undo Song Yu\u2019s belt with unusual initiative. He pulled out the hard cock that was already bulging with veins, and it jumped in his hand as though it was alive.Song Yu was kissing his neck, and he thrust a few times once he felt Yue Zhishi holding him, as though he was fucking Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand.A layer of sweat covered Yue Zhishi\u2019s back. He held on, not daring to move.\u201cPut the condom on me.\u201d The sound of Song Yu\u2019s authoritative voice hovered around his ear.\u201cCan we not use it?\u201d Yue Zhishi very naively requested, lying underneath Song Yu\u2019s body. It was a request that extremely tested people\u2019s strength of will. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to use it\u2026\u201dSong Yu felt sweat rolling down his back. \u201cNo, we have to use it.\u201dHis voice slightly gentling, he kissed Yue Zhishi\u2019s lower lip. \u201cIt won\u2019t be good for you. Behave.\u201dYue Zhishi lost himself in that too sweet kiss, and he turned obedient, nodding slowly twice before fumbling for the foil on his stomach.Song Yu was holding his own cock, nudging against Yue Zhishi\u2019s entrance with the tip of that large organ already spilling with fluid; it made Yue Zhishi unable to breathe normally, his breaths hitching.It was very difficult for him to tear open the packaging. The lube inside dripped onto his flat belly, flowing along his waist to leak onto the bed. He said a bit weakly, \u201cI\u2019ve opened it\u2026\u201d He then searched for Song Yu\u2019s cock, struggling \u2014 he was very unskilled with the movements, and he tried many times before barely managing to push the condom on. He fell backwards onto the pillows, breathing deeply.He felt like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered, sending himself under the sharp blade.Song Yu curved over and gave him a sweet kiss like a prize. \u201cBe a good boy and stretch out your tongue.\u201dAs Yue Zhishi obediently gave him his tongue in a kiss, Song Yu pushed into that well-stretched entrance. Only his tip had gone in, and yet Yue Zhishi whimpered into his lips, \u201cBig\u2026\u201dSong Yu clutched his inner thighs, pressing in a bit further \u2014 Yue Zhishi was ridiculously tight, and he could feel his cock imperceptibly jerking from the squeeze.\u201cThis is just the start.\u201d His voice had already changed.Yue Zhishi\u2019s legs subconsciously wound themselves around Song Yu\u2019s body, and one of them was caught and placed onto Song Yu\u2019s shoulder. Song Yu pushed inside so slowly, little by little, his hand clenched onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s narrow and pale calf. Turning his face over, he kissed Yue Zhishi\u2019s ankle, his other hand kneading Yue Zhishi\u2019s butt.Once the sting from being entered gradually faded away, another kind of desire took over, and the sounds of Yue Zhishi\u2019s light and weak voice also changed. His head started to tilt backwards, his whole face flushed, and his entire person angled in Song Yu\u2019s direction. The curve of his arched back was mesmerising, and his naked body was utterly destroyed by pleasure, so hot it seemed to be dissolving.He kept whispering Song Yu\u2019s name among his unsteady gasps for air and wasn\u2019t quite willing to say anything else. When Song Yu\u2019s cock pushed into a certain place, Yue Zhishi suddenly called out \u2014 it was a very brief groan, and then he shook his head in distress, saying again and again he didn\u2019t want it.\u201cHere?\u201d As though he was confirming something, Song Yu roughly fucked into that direction.The upper half of Yue Zhishi\u2019s body nearly flew up, and he sounded tearful and very pitiful as he said, \u201cGege, don\u2019t press there\u2026\u201dSong Yu stroked Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. \u201cThat\u2019s your prostate. You\u2019ll feel really good.\u201d And then, he pressed Yue Zhishi\u2019s long legs open and mercilessly rammed into that spot, fucking Yue Zhishi so deeply his body shifted upwards on the bed. Yue Zhishi\u2019s head was practically buried into the pillows, and his voice fragmented from Song Yu\u2019s thrusts, that softened cock bobbing again and again and hitting against Song Yu\u2019s lower belly.It was raining violently outside the windows, stirring up the earth. Yue Zhishi\u2019s most sensitive place was almost smashed into pieces by Song Yu, and Yue Zhishi had an odd delusion in between his sexual pleasure and lack of oxygen. It was as though he was just an overripe persimmon being crushed by Song Yu until he no longer had a form, only a sweet and sticky red juice poured all over Song Yu\u2019s hands.Later, both of his legs were lifted onto Song Yu\u2019s shoulders. His entire body was like a bent folder, compressed underneath Song Yu\u2019s body; there was a pillow under his highly lifted waist, and Song Yu fucked his small, curled up body until Yue Zhishi could no longer speak clearly, heat and liquid gathering in his half-closed eyes.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Song Yu panted, gripping Yue Zhishi\u2019s hips, and forced him to speak.Yue Zhishi was breathless from Song Yu\u2019s thrusts, and he sharply coughed a few times. He felt the strength of Song Yu\u2019s movements slightly decrease, and he struggled to speak clearly. \u201cGege\u2026 do, do you feel good?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s rough pants intermingled with the sound of water, and he lowered his head to kiss Yue Zhishi\u2019s nose and lips. \u201cWhat about you? You\u2019re so tight.\u201d\u201cMn\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair was fluttering from the fierce onslaught; his eyes remained half-closed, and he foolishly smiled, using the most pure facial expression to say the most erotic words. \u201cI feel so good from gege fucking me\u2026\u201dFinding it hot, Song Yu pulled off his shirt and laid down sideways, embracing Yue Zhishi from behind. His arms slipped over to play with Yue Zhishi\u2019s nipples, and then he pushed in again into Yue Zhishi\u2019s body.\u201cGege, I, I can\u2019t, it\u2019s too deep\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t handle it anymore?\u201d Song Yu sucked the mole on his nape. \u201cThen why did my cock slide right in.\u201d\u201cYue Zhishi, don\u2019t lie.\u201dYue Zhishi felt like an entire field of black was right in front of his eyes. His entire body was paralysed, as though it could no longer feel anything; he could only weakly pull in insubstantial air to save himself \u2014 their current sideways position made him feel like Song Yu could completely pierce him through.Song Yu had once used this very position to hug him to sleep, like a dependable and safe bed.But he could also use this position to feed devastating pleasure into his body.Yue Zhishi was all too familiar with the feeling of suffocation. He was used to not having enough air, used to experiencing the most extreme sensations in his body \u2014 even used to dying.But the suffocation Song Yu gave him was safe: there was no need for him to endure and get used to it \u2014 he could indulge himself in it, enjoy it as much as he wanted.\u201cReally, it\u2019s too deep, Song Yu, Song Yu\u2026\u201d\u201cNot calling me gege anymore?\u201d Song Yu bit the small piece of flesh on his neck and somewhat fiercely sucked on it. \u201cYou were such a good boy when you were younger. Do you remember what you used to call me?\u201dUnder Song Yu\u2019s hints, Yue Zhishi thickly called out\u00a0Xiao Yu gege, and he spoke them as though he was actually a child, indistinctly and without any self-control.He was weak and fragile, very easy to control, and it tested and tortured Song Yu even more.\u201cYou said you wanted to be Xiao Yu gege\u2019s girlfriend. Were you speaking truthfully?\u201d Song Yu pressed his lips against Yue Zhishi\u2019s ear, the slap of his hips growing faster. \u201cOr were you lying as well.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t get enough air, arguing back for himself without conscious thought. \u201cI wasn\u2019t lying\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat a good boy. And now you are.\u201d Song Yu grabbed Yue Zhishi\u2019s tightly clenched hand and put it onto his own belly. Separated by a thin layer of skin and flesh, Yue Zhishi could almost feel the cock plunging in, jutting out again and again underneath his stomach. \u201cCan you feel it?\u201d\u201cMn\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi was a bit scared, and he turned his head over in shame, his eyes seeing nothing but a vast expanse. He was practically unable to see Song Yu, yet he yearned to kiss him. \u201cGege, kiss.\u201dThe kiss covered his broken moans, as well as his mind nearly fucked blank by Song Yu. He heard Song Yu\u2019s breathing grow increasingly heavier, and Song Yu fucked him into coming. He couldn\u2019t see anything, faint and dizzy, only sensing the rain outside the window falling harder.He felt Song Yu coming, pressing against his prostate and reluctant to finish. Song Yu left his lips on his nape for a long, long time.Song Yu had yet to completely soften, but Yue Zhishi was truly unable to continue \u2014 his physical strength couldn\u2019t keep up, and he couldn\u2019t do anything except breathe in large gasps of air. The mistaken impression of being once again rescued prior to dying lingered around him, his consciousness breaking away from his flushed and weak body.The rain ambushed the city, dragging the city into darkness. No plant was able to successfully puff for air, having been recklessly assaulted by the fierce rain; the typhoon swept in from the sea with the intention to gobble up everything and engulfed all the life within the dark city.Yue Zhishi liked torrential rain, liked the flavour of upturned soil in the air \u2014 it seemed to hint at nature pulsating with life, taken apart under the violence of the rain before being reborn.He heard phantom echoes under the sound of rain. His ears were surrounded by Song Yu\u2019s voice, the sound of it drifting both closely and far away.\u201cNot calling me gege anymore?\u201dHis voice had been very low, slightly hoarse.\u201cYou were such a good boy when you were younger. Do you remember what you used to call me?\u201dUnder Song Yu\u2019s guidance, Yue Zhishi thickly called out\u00a0Xiao Yu gege, and he spoke them as though he was actually a child, indistinctly and without any self-control.He saw himself as a child with Song Yu holding his hand, shoulders against each other as they walked in water under heavy rain.\u201cYou said you wanted to be Xiao Yu gege\u2019s girlfriend. Were you speaking truthfully?\u201d Song Yu pressed his lips against Yue Zhishi\u2019s ear. \u201cOr were you lying as well.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t get enough air, arguing back for himself without conscious thought. \u201cI wasn\u2019t lying\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat a good boy,\u201d he said, as though he was pronouncing a judgement. \u201cAnd now you are.\u201d\u201cMn\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi turned his head over in shame. He was practically unable to see Song Yu, yet he yearned to kiss him. \u201cGege, kiss.\u201dHe was vaguely aware of being wrapped up in clothing and being picked up. He curled in, hearing water, and felt warm steam clinging to the skin of his ankles. When he entered the water, Yue Zhishi sensed Song Yu calling out his name, tenderly pecking at his lips.\u201cBaobao, you\u2019re such a good boy.\u201dSong Yu called him with an endearment he\u2019d never let out of his mouth, an endearment that he\u2019d perhaps recited many times within his heart.Yue Zhishi\u2019s chest was still heaving, and he said to Song Yu very softly, \u201cI\u2019m not a good boy\u2026 I love you.\u201dHe was too tired, directly falling asleep in the bathtub. Half awake and half dreaming, he let Song Yu clean him, and then he was carried out, cared for and treated like a newborn before being placed under a warm blanket. The rain outside the windows poured like it would never again stop, but Song Yu\u2019s embrace was warm and safe \u2014 it was the sole haven he wanted to go to. He wasn\u2019t scared at all.When the sky was about to brighten, Yue Zhishi woke up in a bit of a stupor. He was slightly dehydrated, mumbling that he wanted some water. Song Yu, who\u2019d always hated being bothered awake, woke up almost instantly; he got up to pour Yue Zhishi a cup of warm water and returned back to him, supporting Yue Zhishi\u2019s neck as he fed him the water.Yue Zhishi burrowed his way into Song Yu\u2019s arms very naturally once they laid back down. His arms went around Song Yu\u2019s waist, fitting their bodies together without a single gap in between as if they had depended on each other, protected each other just like that within their mother\u2019s body.He slept all the way to noon, and Song Yu was no longer by his side when he woke. All by himself in the large and empty bed, Yue Zhishi flipped over \u2014 he realised his whole body was aching like the remnants of a fever. He pressed the back of his hand against his forehead to check his temperature; there was no real difference.Just managing to sit up, Yue Zhishi pushed away the covers. He noticed the marks littered all across his body, as well as the faint bruises spread across his calves and hips that looked like they were left behind from being gripped too hard.\u201cGood thing it\u2019s not summer\u2026\u201d The words had just left his mouth when he realised even his voice was a bit hoarse; he awkwardly coughed twice, clearing his throat, and happened to see Song Yu coming out of the bathroom, dressed in a robe. Song Yu was tall and well built, the lines of his chest muscles still able to be faintly seen.Yue Zhishi\u2019s first reaction was to cover himself with the blanket, exposing only his pair of eyes. A layer of moisture filmed his eyes, and he blinked meekly.\u201cWe still need to head out later this afternoon, and yet you\u2019ve slept to now.\u201d Song Yu walked towards him rather unhurriedly and sat down on the side of the bed.Yue Zhishi held onto the blanket and grumbled, \u201cThat\u2019s not my fault\u2026\u201dHe thought Song Yu would emphatically pull away his blanket, but he was mistaken. Leaning over, Song Yu delicately kissed Yue Zhishi\u2019s frail and slightly reddened and swollen upper eyelids.\u201cI seem to keep forgetting to say,\u201d Song Yu used the pad of his thumb to gently massage Yue Zhishi\u2019s brow bone, \u201cyour eyelashes are really beautiful. Your eyes are, too. They look like amber.\u201dBeing suddenly complimented, Yue Zhishi was somewhat delighted, so he loosened the hand that had been clutching onto the blanket and tumbled into Song Yu\u2019s arms. He squirmed against his neck and said, \u201cMy waist\u2019s really sore, and so are my bones. Do I have a fever?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019ve checked.\u201d Song Yu swept a hand down his back, taking all of the responsibility onto himself. \u201cBlame me.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Yue Zhishi inhaled the delicious scent of aftershave on his body and quietly said, \u201cYou\u2019re really amazing, you\u2019re super amazing. I really like you.\u201dA memory abruptly floated across his brain. Somewhat embarrassed, he hummed a bit and then raised his head to give Song Yu\u2019s chin a peck. Like he was pleading, he said, \u201cGege, can you call me like that again?\u201d\u201cLike how?\u201d Song Yu watched him, an answer already in his heart, yet he deliberately pretended to not know.\u201cLike, like how you did at the end.\u201d Yue Zhishi was slightly impatient, and he shamelessly bumped his forehead into Song Yu\u2019s chin again and again. \u201cSong Yu, hurry, call me.\u201dUnable to resist him, Song Yu could only ease over to his ear, his lips touching the cartilage.His voice was still husky, and it carried a touch of tenderness within its awkwardness.\u201cBaobao.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound as nice as last night.\u201d Yue Zhishi said very critically, pinching Song Yu\u2019s arm. He blinked his eyes, quite a playful expression on his face.Song Yu found him amusing, and he said with a cool voice, \u201cAre you disdaining me?\u201d\u201cNo, no no,\u201d Yue Zhishi denied briskly. His eyes meandered over towards the storm outside the windows, watching the sky that had turned from black to white \u2014 the Canton Tower was still faintly visible within the wild spray of water.One night had already passed.Yue Zhishi came out from Song Yu\u2019s embrace \u2014 or perhaps, it was more like he pushed him away. He groped in all directions for his phone before finally finding it at the head of the bed.Song Yu hauled the blanket over him, worried he\u2019d be cold. \u201cGet back in, don\u2019t get sick.\u201d Seeing Yue Zhishi so focused on his phone, he was slightly dissatisfied and reached out a hand, wanting to tug at his wrist like a cat unhappy at being ignored. \u201cWhat are you so busy with?\u201d\u201cWait, almost done!\u201d Yue Zhishi wrestled with him, unwilling to let go of his phone. That pair of pure and innocent eyes blinked, staring at the lit up screen.Song Yu was about to express his discontentment with Yue Zhishi\u2019s phone addiction when he suddenly heard his own phone vibrate. It was a WeChat message from Yue Zhishi.\u201cWhat are you doing\u2026\u201d He\u2019d yet to finish speaking \u2014 the moment he saw the notification, a vein in his temple furiously throbbed.[Le Le: WeChat transfer 2000 RMB]\u201cIt\u2019s last night\u2019s\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t even have the chance to finish saying the two words of \u2018room fee\u2019 when Song Yu caught his chin.Song Yu\u2019s voice sounded a bit scary.\u201cYue Zhishi, are you taking me for a prostitute?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He frantically waved his hands at him. \u201cAh, no, no\u2026\u201dWhenever he was anxious, he would always go to hug Song Yu, but Song Yu held onto his shoulders this time and pushed him away. \u201cNot allowed to hug me.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Yue Zhishi pouted in dissatisfaction.With a complete poker face, Song Yu said, \u201cI\u2019m allergic to you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d Yue Zhishi wanted to grab one of his arms, but Song Yu caught his arm instead. His other hand held onto the bottom edge of his phone, and he patted Yue Zhishi\u2019s face with it.\u201cYue Zhishi, don\u2019t change the conversation on me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really rich now, are you? Or am I too cheap?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not cheap!\u201d Flustered, Yue Zhishi went to grab at Song Yu, but he accidentally pulled at Song Yu\u2019s bathrobe and revealed more than half of his shoulders. There were still scratch marks on them.Song Yu glanced down at himself and then raised his eyes again. Staring at Yue Zhishi, he said in a deep voice, \u201cWhat, you haven\u2019t had enough?\u201dYue Zhishi choked at that question and started to cough, flushing from his chest to his face. It took some effort to smoothen out his breathing, but then Song Yu pressed him down, hands on his shoulders, until he fell backwards onto the soft and fluffy pillows \u2014 but Song Yu didn\u2019t kiss him.A very mild fragrance of sandalwood blended with citrus diffused from Song Yu\u2019s aftershave. It was originally a very common scent, but it became particularly delicious once attached to Song Yu\u2019s skin. His eyes swept languidly across Yue Zhishi\u2019s face, looking like a danger signal.\u201cHow many rounds can your savings pay for?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s finger trailed down Yue Zhishi\u2019s nose and fiddled with Yue Zhishi\u2019s slightly swollen, faintly glistening lips very lightly. \u201cFour?\u201d\u201cMy lips are a bit sore,\u201d Yue Zhishi mumbled quietly, dodging away from Song Yu\u2019s finger.\u201cWhose fault is that?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s finger poked at a soft corner of his mouth. Sometimes when Yue Zhishi smiled, that place would deepen into a shallow little dimple.Yue Zhishi had nothing to say to that; he really had kept begging for kisses, and they\u2019d ended up kissing the entire time they were having sex. Perhaps he truly was different from other people, deeply needing to be held or to be kissed \u2014 the more he lost himself within Song Yu, the more he needed the confirmation of their intimacy. It would be best if those kisses didn\u2019t stop for a single moment.\u201cYue Zhishi, let\u2019s not look for the fabric anymore this afternoon.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s hand had yet to stop, and it continued downwards, wrapping itself around Yue Zhishi\u2019s neck. The pads of his fingers rubbed against the deep red marks left on his skin. \u201cLet\u2019s finish spending all of your money today in one go. That way we won\u2019t have to do it again in the future.\u201dYue Zhishi immediately shook his head and strained to lift it higher, wanting to kiss Song Yu. But Song Yu evaded away, and so Yue Zhishi could only emphatically say, feeling sorry for himself, \u201cNo, no way.\u201dSong Yu raised his eyebrows and purposefully said, \u201cOr is it more important to look for your fabric?\u201dYue Zhishi dropped his eyes, his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing up and down unconsciously. He forced out another answer. \u201cNo, I meant\u2026 we\u2019ll be doing it again in the future.\u201d His hand slid out from a corner of the blanket, and he\u2019d just put it onto the belt of Song Yu\u2019s bathrobe when Song Yu gripped onto his wrist.\u201cJust look at yourself right now.\u201d Song Yu looked over him and placed Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand back into the blanket. \u201cBehave.\u201d\u201cYou were saying yesterday what a good boy I was, and now you\u2019re saying I\u2019m not behaving.\u201d Yue Zhishi coughed twice, shrinking back into his blanket. \u201cSong Yu, you\u2019re so mean.\u201dAfter standing up, Song Yu towered over him and adjusted his bathrobe. He said, looking down at him from up high, \u201cI\u2019m going to tie you up if you keep talking.\u201dYue Zhishi closed his mouth, but then he reached out an arm again after two seconds, raising it like a little child towards his teacher. \u201cFinal thing. The money I transferred you is for the room. Let me pay for the first day.\u201dSong Yu turned around, saying calmly and leisurely, \u201cI\u2019m going to get a rope.\u201d\u201cHey hey hey, don\u2019t, I\u2019ll stop talking now okay\u2026\u201dWhen Yue Zhishi got off the bed to clean up, he realised his legs were trembling; he\u2019d taken only two steps when he crouched and simply sat down on the carpet, not saying anything or making any noise. Behind him, Song Yu was checking his emails at his laptop, and when he saw Yue Zhishi sitting on the floor, he walked over and asked what was wrong.\u201cIt\u2019s aching a bit\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s ears were red, and he hugged his lower belly, face slightly scrunching up.\u201cWhere?\u201d Song Yu picked him up from the floor, arms sliding behind the back of Yue Zhishi\u2019s knees, and headed towards the bathroom.\u201c\u2026I feel like I\u2019m aching everywhere.\u201d Yue Zhishi touched his chest. \u201cMy throat, lower belly, legs and\u2026\u201d He cleared his throat, vaguely insinuating the rest.\u201cI\u2019ve already put some cream on there for you, it shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue.\u201d Song Yu lowered him in front of the sink, steadying him.At that moment, Yue Zhishi saw the cup readied for him, a toothbrush with a squeeze of toothpaste on it resting on top. He tilted his head and looked at Song Yu. \u201cHow are you so good.\u201dSong Yu stiffly turned his face away. \u201cIt was just convenient.\u201dHearing Yue Zhishi\u2019s still somewhat hoarse voice, Song Yu reached out a hand and very gently touched Yue Zhishi\u2019s lower belly.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t think much of his touch; instead, he suddenly realised he lost one of his slippers when Song Yu picked him up. He nimbly stepped onto Song Yu\u2019s cotton slippers \u2014 this way, Song Yu wouldn\u2019t be able to walk away.\u201cI went too hard on you,\u201d Song Yu said very quietly, sounding much more gentle compared to just then.But Yue Zhishi actually didn\u2019t mind \u2014 he placed his hand onto Song Yu\u2019s, words coming out garbled as he continued brushing his teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m super hard to kill.\u201dThat sentence didn\u2019t sound right no matter how he listened to it. Song Yu didn\u2019t speak, letting Yue Zhishi step on him as he wished, eyes gazing at the Yue Zhishi in the mirror. There was a small hickey on the skin behind Yue Zhishi\u2019s ear, and it faintly peeked out from his hair.The hotel\u2019s room service wasn\u2019t too bad \u2014 Song Yu ordered a lightly flavoured porridge and some small snacks Yue Zhishi could eat, as well as a large plate of fruit.Yue Zhishi\u2019s body was currently lacking in nutrients, and he was extremely hungry; he shovelled in the large bowl of hot porridge and felt much better.But it really was mild and lightly flavoured. Too mild.He pointed at the rain outside, the colour of his voice different from usual. It was a little husky, as though he\u2019d truly matured from being a little child, but the words he spoke were very childish. \u201cDuring weather like this, we should be eating hotpot.\u201dStabbing a fork into an apple slice that\u2019d been cut into the shape of a bunny, Song Yu plugged up his mouth.The rain had lessened slightly by 1:30pm, but the wind was still very strong. Song Yu pulled his own woollen turtleneck sweater over Yue Zhishi\u2019s body with the excuse of keeping his throat warm in order to prevent an asthma attack. He fussed with the neck, covering up all of the leftover marks.They came out of the hotel, and the taxi they\u2019d called earlier was already waiting in front of the financial centre building\u2019s revolving door. Holding up an umbrella, Song Yu kept Yue Zhishi shielded in his arms and took him into the car.The address for the fabric shop wasn\u2019t too far away. The driver was a young man, and he said that place was Guangzhou\u2019s largest, most international fabric wholesale market.When he talked about how international it was, he specifically glanced a few times at Yue Zhishi\u2019s face from his rearview mirror. Yue Zhishi and Song Yu each wore one piece of a pair of bluetooth earbuds, and Yue Zhishi was leaning on Song Yu, head lowered at his phone. The wipers brushed back and forth on the car\u2019s windshield. Song Yu was a bit irritated.\u201cHandsome boy, are you mixed or a foreigner?\u201d the driver finally asked.Yue Zhishi raised his head, not having clearly heard what he\u2019d said. He was about to take off his earbud, but Song Yu pressed down his hand and said, face cold, \u201cChinese and English mixed.\u201dThe driver nodded repeatedly and took the chance to take a few more looks at Yue Zhishi\u2019s face while his head was lifted. \u201cOh, no wonder you look so good. Your eyelashes are longer than some girls\u2026\u201d\u201cThe light\u2019s green now,\u201d Song Yu interrupted, as indifferent and detached as a robot in charge of voice announcements. \u201cThere are higher chances of getting into a traffic accident during the rain. Please focus on driving.\u201dYue Zhishi had no idea at all about what was happening, and so he lowered his head back down and continued reading his manga chapters. A few seconds later, he felt Song Yu loosen his hand; Yue Zhishi grabbed it back, refusing to let Song Yu move away, and massaged Song Yu\u2019s knuckles as he continued to read.\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of ruining your eyes.\u201d Even though he meant to reproach Yue Zhishi with those words, Song Yu\u2019s voice was far too gentle when speaking to him.Without even bothering to lift his head, Yue Zhishi clicked onto the next page. \u201cThey won\u2019t be ruined, this manga is updated monthly. I can only read it once a month.\u201dCompletely not on the same train of thought at all. Song Yu looked out the window, the car now much quieter without the driver\u2019s attempts at chatting Yue Zhishi up. They arrived at the marketplace not much longer later, and Yue Zhishi said thank you to the driver very politely before closing the door and jumping under Song Yu\u2019s umbrella.The overall area of the marketplace was quite large, made from many buildings stuck together. There were many fabric shops inside. Looking at the address Yue Zhishi gave him, Song Yu quickly found that particular fabric shop and took Yue Zhishi over.This particular fabric shop was the largest on its floor, its space broad and roomy. Multiple rows of shelves were installed inside, and they were brimming with all different kinds of fabrics and generally filed according to colour. The name, factory manufacturer and price of each fabric were labelled below. It was an endless, dazzling collection, and yet everything was organised very neatly.\u201cAre you feeling like you\u2019ve arrived in heaven?\u201d Yue Zhishi attempted to interview Song Yu, someone suffering from OCD, but Song Yu wasn\u2019t really interested in the fabrics; he directly walked towards the person who looked most like the shop manager.\u201cHello, I\u2019d like to buy a particular fabric.\u201d Song Yu didn\u2019t bother circling around, bluntly saying what he was after. There wasn\u2019t much expression on his face.The staff member was a middle-aged woman, and she looked at Song Yu in consideration. He was wearing a long classic heather grey\u00a0Chesterfield coat\u00a0with a black cashmere turtleneck. They both looked well made using quality fabrics, and his entire outfit looked expensive. People who worked in fabric manufacturing and clothing production knew how to gauge someone \u2014 a simple glance over your clothes, and they would already have an idea of your potential.She said, a welcoming smile on her face, \u201cWelcome, sir. I manage this store \u2014 my surname is Chen. May I ask which fabric you were after? We\u2019re the largest supplier in this marketplace, and many big businesses specifically fly over to discuss custom fabrics with us.\u201d She looked over and pointed at those never-ending shelves. \u201cThis is only a small selection. We still have many more fabrics in our warehouse.\u201dSong Yu glanced back at Yue Zhishi, who then immediately, cheerfully named the fabric. \u201cHi, Manager Chen. We talked earlier on the phone, and you said this particular fabric was no longer being made. Do you have any stock here?\u201dManager Chen used an iPad to check, and it showed that they did have that particular fabric \u2014 but it was low in stock and was unable to be retrieved. \u201cPlease wait, let me contact the warehouse. We don\u2019t have it here in our shop.\u201dSong Yu faintly dipped his head, his two hands resting in the pockets of his coat, and stood there with an impassive look on his face. Yue Zhishi explored the fabrics nearby and touched them, recording them down on his phone before running back to tug at Song Yu\u2019s sleeve. \u201cThat ash grey silk\u2019s really nice too, we can use it to make the dress Xiao Qi designed.\u201dSong Yu gave him a sideways look, mildly saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not like you don\u2019t have enough money. No need to report back to me.\u201dYue Zhishi immediately pouted, crinkling his nose. \u201cI don\u2019t have any money.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s slender fingers pressed a few times on his phone, and then he pulled up the WeChat transfer record to show Yue Zhishi. He countered, \u201cReally?\u201dHe didn\u2019t accept the transfer, and neither did he reject it, only leaving it hanging in limbo. Yue Zhishi silently grumbled: as expected, this guy did everything the same way, able to fish better than a cat.\u201cI\u2019m really poor,\u201d Yue Zhishi softly said. \u201c2000 each time is too expensive, I can\u2019t play like that.\u201dSong Yu keenly caught his specific wording and flicked an eyebrow. \u201cWho\u2019s playing whom?\u201dAnother worker walked up to them before Yue Zhishi could explain. It was a young lady, and she\u2019d stood not too far away earlier. She knew which fabric Yue Zhishi wanted from them, and she brought over similar fabrics, giving them a polite greeting and asking if any of the ones she was holding could serve as a suitable replacement.Yue Zhishi took the fabrics under the light, seriously looking over them, and then sent photos of them to their group chat. He also took a magnifying glass from the worker, closely examining the fabric textures.He came to the same conclusion as everyone else in the group chat \u2014 none of these fabrics could be used as a replacement. They all lacked that specific glossy, glistening quality, that particular feel of having silver threads running through it without actually using silver threads.\u201cThank you.\u201d Yue Zhishi gave the fabrics back to her and then returned back to Song Yu\u2019s side.The worker said\u00a0you\u2019re welcome, looking over the two of them with her arms wrapped around the stack of fabrics. Her eyes landed on Song Yu, and then after a pause, she couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cSir, did you come specifically to look for fabric materials?\u201dYue Zhishi suddenly thought things didn\u2019t seem quite right \u2014 it felt like the staff had mistaken Song Yu as a representative for some clothing manufacturer. Looking over, he thought Song Yu had dressed very business-like; other than his face being overly young, it would definitely be easy to misconstrue him.Song Yu didn\u2019t reply, and the worker didn\u2019t find it too strange, only turning to Yue Zhishi and asking with a smile, \u201cAre you the assistant? Or secretary? I feel like you\u2019re very young \u2014 you might be even younger than me.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I, I\u2019m actually\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi wanted to explain after being misunderstood, but Song Yu abruptly chuckled and caught his attention.It was as though he was quite interested in the set up of a young director with his little secretary.\u201cOur relationship\u2019s not like that,\u201d Yue Zhishi attempted to say, but Song Yu calmly cut off his words and said, \u201cHe is quite young.\u201dAn understanding look passed over the worker\u2019s face. Yue Zhishi jumped to consult her about other fabrics, chose a few and then decided to purchase them directly from the store.\u201cWe normally don\u2019t take orders for less than 500 metres.\u201d The lady glanced at Song Yu. \u201cIf you head back and think our samples have good results, please return and take care of us.\u201dYue Zhishi thought in his heart, he most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to take care of you \u2014 he might\u2019ve been born with a face meant for commercial dealings, but in reality, he was someone who picked up rocks.Picking around, Yue Zhishi ended up choosing a large bunch of fabrics, and he felt like he didn\u2019t bring enough funds to cover the entire cost. He started to ask the worker if he could have a discount, voice carrying a bit of cute whining, but Song Yu stopped him.\u201cI\u2019ll cover the rest if you don\u2019t have enough.\u201dYue Zhishi wasn\u2019t really happy \u2014 it was his own boyfriend\u2019s wool being sheered off, after all. But his attention was caught by another plank of fabric in the worker\u2019s hand; a slightly velvety type of fabric lay on top, cut into one metre ribbons the width of three fingers, and there were all sorts of colours.\u201cThis is?\u201d\u201cAh, this is our newest product. It\u2019s a satin velvet material that\u2019s extremely soft to the touch \u2014 many famous women clothing designers have already ordered this fabric from us for their high-end clothing lines.\u201d The worker pulled out the black strip, handing it to Yue Zhishi. \u201cHave a feel. It\u2019s very luxurious on the skin, and it won\u2019t whiten no matter how you stroke it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true, it\u2019s so soft and comfortable.\u201dYue Zhishi draped the black ribbon over his pale wrist. Seeing the sharp colour contrast, a certain fantasy popped up in Song Yu\u2019s mind.\u201cLet me gift this to you.\u201d A young girl\u2019s smile emerged on the worker\u2019s face. \u201cI think if your hair grew out a bit longer to your shoulders, you\u2019d look really nice using this as a tie.\u201dYue Zhishi smiled as well, that little dimpled shadow once again appearing next to his mouth. He very cutely grabbed a bit of his not-long-enough hair and said, \u201cReally? Then thank you.\u201dThe worker packed up all the fabrics he\u2019d purchased, and only then did Manager Chen return; Yue Zhishi could tell from the expression on her face that she wasn\u2019t coming back with good news.\u201cI apologise,\u201d Manager Chen said. \u201cWe originally had a sample around 500 metres, and it was our last batch. This particular fabric is expensive to make, and because there wasn\u2019t enough demand for it, we decided to stop producing it. It was left for another clothing manufacturer \u2014 he supposedly likes to collect discontinued fabrics \u2014 and it was taken away just yesterday.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Yue Zhishi was slightly regretful. No wonder the owner of this particular fabric shop kept saying they couldn\u2019t sell it \u2014 someone else had booked it earlier.After seeing the crestfallen look on Yue Zhishi\u2019s face, Song Yu opened his mouth despite not speaking for so long. \u201cCould we get that clothing manufacturer\u2019s contact information?\u201dManager Chen was initially very hesitant to do so, but the young man in front of her gave off a trustworthy feeling of pressure. It was a very strange description, but that was truly what she felt; in the end, she still clarified and said, \u201cYou might not be able to get into contact with him. This particular clothing manufacturer\u2019s a bit troublesome, he nitpicks over the smallest little detail. He\u2019s Vice President Zhou from Mingshang Company.\u201d\u201cMingshang\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s memory was a bit fuzzy, and it was Song Yu who immediately realised.\u201cWhat a coincidence, we have his contact number.\u201dYue Zhishi plucked at his sleeve, asking very softly, \u201cDo we\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, his business card\u2019s in your bag.\u201d Song Yu bid farewell to Manager Chen and took Yue Zhishi away. As they went down in the elevator, Yue Zhishi stared at the business card Song Yu had found so easily, asking, \u201cHow\u2019d you remember this?\u201dI remember every man or woman who tries to chat you up. Song Yu didn\u2019t say that out loud, having found a more appropriate excuse. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be asking yourself instead how you managed to forget everything that happened yesterday?\u201dAs expected, Yue Zhishi was made speechless by his question. He silently pulled out his phone, calling the number; it was still raining, and he stood in front of the glass door on the first floor, dialling the number twice before the other side finally picked up.\u201cIs this Mr. Zhou Chengwei? I\u2019m not sure if you still remember me, I\u2019m the guy who was next to you on the plane and bumped into you on the bullet train\u2026 Yes, yes, the mixed race. Ah, it\u2019s good you still remember me.\u201dSong Yu stood by the side, watching as Yue Zhishi happily talked on the phonewhile doodling on the fogged up glass door. There was almost no difference between him now as an adult and him as a child.At five, six years old, Yue Zhishi had also really liked scribbling characters on glass. He\u2019d particularly loved writing the \u2018yu\u2019 character from Song Yu\u2019s name, but the character had been slightly difficult for him as a child \u2014 which was why every time he\u2019d written their names next to each together, that \u2018yu\u2019 character had always been exceptionally big. Yue Zhishi had been able to justify himself very well: he said that character was the largest because it was the most important one. Xiao Yu gege was his most important person.That small kid with a mouth full of sweet and honeyed words within his memories gradually overlapped with the grown boy in front of his eyes. Song Yu let out a soft laugh, his eyes lowering.Who knew how many people he\u2019d managed to fool with his ability to coax with fake words.Yue Zhishi finished his phone call much faster than he\u2019d thought he would and ran back to Song Yu. He clutched his phone in utter excitement and said, \u201cHe agreed!\u201d\u201cHow\u2019d you coax him?\u201d Song Yu raised an eyebrow.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t notice his tone, only shaking his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t, I just told him my situation. He agreed to send us half of the fabric with one small request. He requested for me to send him one set of the clothes we make using the fabric.\u201dSong Yu carelessly nodded his head. \u201cThen the problem\u2019s solved.\u201d\u201cYes. My waist\u2019s so sore, and I\u2019m so hungry.\u201d Without much regard for the people around them, Yue Zhishi hooked his arms around Song Yu\u2019s neck, his entire upper body leaning against Song Yu. His voice softened, turned docile. \u201cGege, can you take me to eat something delicious? I want to eat roast goose and\u00a0coconut milk pudding.\u201dThinking of how he\u2019d also used that same tone of voice to discuss prices with other people, Song Yu threw him a look and didn\u2019t place his hands on Yue Zhishi\u2019s waist like he usually would. He deliberately said, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll pay for the food with the prostitute fee you gave me.\u201dOne person walked past, and Yue Zhishi flew to cover Song Yu\u2019s mouth. He said, very very softly, \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2026\u201d He stressed again, \u201cThat\u2019s for the room.\u201d\u201cSame thing.\u201dSince Song Yu was still going on about it, Yue Zhishi secretly labelled him with the description of \u2018cute\u2019 in his heart.\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Yue Zhishi said, his voice gentle and breathy. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we stay in hotels every day\u2026\u201d And then, realising it was a bit hard to continue along that topic, he changed tactics and said, \u201cCan you be free? I can\u2019t afford paying that much money.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Song Yu pushed him away, face cold and unfeeling. \u201cI refuse to prostitute for free.\u201dYue Zhishi let out an \u2018oh\u2019. \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to earn lots and lots of money. I\u2019ll have to become a big shot lawyer.\u201dCan you really tell other people that\u2019s your reason to become a big shot lawyer?Song Yu was both annoyed and amused; he lowered his eyes and suddenly saw that gifted ribbon. Half of it had come out of their bag of fabrics, and it was moving, blown by the cold wind drifting in after opening the door. He reached out and pulled it out, carefully inspecting it \u2014 he was once again reminded of a small, trifling thing that had displeased him.\u201cThis really suits you.\u201dWithout waiting for Yue Zhishi to speak, Song Yu caught Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrists and unfastened his watch. He held both of Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrists in one hand, and then he used that black ribbon to bind them up, gripping onto the remaining length.That velvet cloth lightly strangled Yue Zhishi\u2019s pale and thin skin, as though it could obstruct the flow of blood within those blue and green veins. Song Yu tugged, and Yue Zhishi staggered forward a step from the pull while trying to understand what was happening. He almost fell completely into Song Yu\u2019s arms.The people walking past started to look at them, and Yue Zhishi felt somewhat uneasy. He softly called out gege and said, \u201cWhy\u2019d you tie me up?\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t answer, directly exiting out of the main entrance while continuing to tug at Yue Zhishi. The rain outside had temporarily stopped, and there was humidity in the air. The ribbon was the only thing linking him and Song Yu together \u2014 with his pair of hands bound and raised, Song Yu dragged him into the thick fog and into a black car waiting by the side of the road.Once they entered the car, Yue Zhishi felt like he was being stared at by the driver; the closed-off, narrow space made his sense of embarrassment even heavier, and it felt dense and weighty on his body \u2014 he couldn\u2019t move. Song Yu closed the car door, still holding onto that black ribbon.Yue Zhishi turned his head to him, using a knee to nudge at Song Yu\u2019s knees. He leaned over and whispered, \u201cAre we going to go eat like this?\u201dSong Yu pushed up his glasses and leaned back into his seat. \u201cMn.\u201d\u201cIt really won\u2019t be convenient to have my hands tied up, unless you feed me,\u201d Yue Zhishi grumbled very softly.\u201cI can do that,\u201d Song Yu said without any inflection in his voice.\u201cBut I\u2019m not a kid.\u201dSong Yu tugged at his wrists, hauling Yue Zhishi slightly closer, and then seemed to stroke his hair very tenderly from the top of his head to the vaguely curly ends. It was just like what that worker\u2019d said: his hair wasn\u2019t long enough. The length of it was only just enough to obscure his vision with sweat dampened hair during intense activity.The image of Yue Zhishi with his hair tied up appeared in his mind for a moment \u2014 he didn\u2019t want too many people to see it.Song Yu opened his mouth, the sound of his voice very much bewitching and mesmerising.\u201cBaobao, it\u2019s about time for you to cut your hair.\u201dThe author has something to say:Little Desire is truly super S, he was relatively restrained last night ( )Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 79: Lost in the Eye of the StormThat endearment left Yue Zhishi faint and woozy the entire time up until they got off the car, his entire brain feeling warm and flushed. He was originally an obedient child to begin with, and he became even more docile after turning silly and foolish, letting Song Yu tug him forward however he wished.There weren\u2019t that many people on the streets, and so Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t feel too embarrassed. He kept replaying in his mind how Song Yu had looked when he called him\u00a0baobao, like a hamster who\u2019d hidden away nuts in his cheeks, furtively taking them out and savouring them with small nibbles when no one was around.But before they entered the restaurant, Song Yu still ended up untying the ribbon around his hands, slowly and leisurely folding it up and putting it away. The restaurant was packed with people, and there were two, three young men and women waiting for taxis at the entrance. Once they saw Yue Zhishi, they gave him a few more glances.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were going to keep me tied up for dinner?\u201d Yue Zhishi pressed himself against Song Yu\u2019s arm, leaning on him as they went up the steps. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to feed me anymore?\u201dSong Yu looked at the self-satisfaction on Yue Zhishi\u2019s face that he couldn\u2019t quite hide, and his mouth unconsciously curled up several degrees.\u201cThat needs to be paid for, big shot lawyer.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have lots of money in the future, I can afford it.\u201dIt was a large restaurant, decorated according to Chinese customs; it was even slightly decorated according to the style of a\u00a0Lingnan garden. Yue Zhishi only noticed the place was a bit familiar after entering their private room \u2014 he carefully thought about it, and then he realised this was one of the restaurants he saw listed in the Black Pearl Restaurant Guide when he was researching where to eat.\u201cHow\u2019d you know about this place?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked.Song Yu was ordering food with the ease of long practice, and then he closed the menu, handing it to the waiter, before quietly talking to her about allergies, dietary restraints and other things. He waited for the waiter to leave before looking at Yue Zhishi. \u201cYour memory really isn\u2019t all that good.\u201d\u201cHave I talked about this place before?\u201d Yue Zhishi frowned, not remembering.\u201cOn the bullet train,\u201d Song Yu said.Yue Zhishi had a vague impression of doing so. He had likely mentioned it only in passing \u2014 after all, there wasn\u2019t much logical flow in his words when he was mindlessly chattering away.But Song Yu was like a machine able to save memories at any place and at any time. There were some small, trifling things that Yue Zhishi found insignificant and essentially wouldn\u2019t remember at all \u2014 and yet Song Yu would forever be able to clearly point them out, even able to remember the time and place they were first mentioned.He\u2019d thought that was because Song Yu was smart, born with innate ability.The waiter pushed the door and entered, carrying in her hands not only a white porcelain teapot but also a square cushion. Song Yu turned his head to look at her and pointed at Yue Zhishi; the waiter immediately understood and walked over. She asked Yue Zhishi to first get up, and then she placed the cushion onto the chair. \u201cSir, please sit.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s ears were still warm by the time the waiter left and closed the door \u2014 he wanted to say something, but he was too embarrassed to say it. The two of them sat at the ends of the table, separated very far, and Yue Zhishi chucked whatever table manners he had to the side, moving his chair next to Song Yu\u2019s side.Perhaps it was because the Song family\u2019s family upbringing was relatively casual and gentle; whenever everyone ate together, all of them needed to sit together. Even though their house was very large, they all preferred to sit around a small circular dining table.Yue Zhishi was used to sitting next to Song Yu. When he\u2019d first entered elementary school, there was a period of time when he had been required to stay at school for lunch and the afternoon break. Six year old Yue Zhishi had lined up together with his classmates, letting the auntie at the cafeteria place food into his insulated bowl, and had then followed his classmates to sit and eat at a rectangular table.But Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t known different grades needed to be stay separate. He kept refusing to let other children sit next to him, pressing his palm onto that stool as he looked around for Song Yu.He later saw Song Yu appear in another group. Song Yu was carrying his food together with some other people, and he walked towards another seat as far away from Yue Zhishi as two corridors before sitting down. No matter how Yue Zhishi waved or called at him, Song Yu didn\u2019t come over.Yue Zhishi wasn\u2019t a child easily discouraged. He tried to lift and carry away his stool, but after pulling at it for a long time, he realised the stool was attached onto the floor, unable to be moved. So in the end, he carried away only his food and ran through the crowd until he reached Song Yu and placed his bowl of food onto Song Yu\u2019s table with a clatter.At that time, Song Yu had acted just like his other classmates did: he\u2019d lifted his head to look at him in confusion.\u201cWhy are you here? Go back to your class.\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head. \u201cI want to eat with you.\u201dHe had been a very strange child, preferring to stand next to Song Yu instead of going back. He stood there and scooped up his food with his spoon, obediently eating his meal one mouthful at a time.Song Yu saw the teacher on patrol and uselessly urged him to go back several times.\u201cAren\u2019t you tired standing there?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Yue Zhishi vaguely said, conveniently slipping down and pushing his way onto Song Yu\u2019s stool. Except his butt took up only a small sliver, and he continued to eat while hugging his bowl.Song Yu\u2019s classmates teased Song Yu, even saying, \u201cAiyah, just hug your little brother while you eat.\u201d\u201cExactly, he\u2019s so cute.\u201dYue Zhishi even knew to say thank you very politely to the people who praised him for being cute. But as Song Yu hesitated, pondering whether or not he should pick Yue Zhishi up, the teacher on patrol appeared and dragged Yue Zhishi back to his first year class.Just like he usually did, Yue Zhishi cried, but he didn\u2019t wail and bother other people. Tears simply dripped out of his eyes very quietly. He refused to put his bowl on the table and hugged it \u2014 this way he could turn his body around and gaze in Song Yu\u2019s direction. He cried as he ate, stubbornly staring at gege.Yue Zhishi cried every day at noon. Song Yu was already a picky eater, and now it was even harder for him to eat; no matter how he pretended, he still saw Yue Zhishi. Fortunately, their school later removed its requirement of eating lunch at school, and they returned home for lunch together \u2014 only then did their miserable lunch experience end.During elementary school, Song Yu had truly gone through too many experiences ordinary children wouldn\u2019t be able to take. And so he thought, maybe that was why his memories were etched so deeply into him.Watching as Yue Zhishi moved his chair next to him, Song Yu didn\u2019t say anything and only poured him a hot cup of\u00a0flowering tea, pushing the cup and saucer over.\u201cDrink some.\u201dEven though the words were a command, Song Yu\u2019s voice was very gentle. Yue Zhishi docilely raised the cup, took a large sip and then placed it back on the table, wrapping his hand around the cup.\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019ll look good with long hair? Everyone says I\u2019ll look really nice if I grow it out.\u201d Yue Zhishi looked at him with his head tilted sideways, and he gave Song Yu his reason very honestly. \u201cI didn\u2019t cut my hair because I wanted you to see.\u201dAfter hearing that, Song Yu placed down his own cup of tea. His hand covered the back of Yue Zhishi\u2019s pale hand, his fingers sliding over those clearly seen veins. \u201cYou will look good.\u201dHe always looked so warm and gentle when his eyes were lowered. All those emotions that could give people a feeling of oppression were all folded away.\u201cThen don\u2019t cut your hair.\u201d He said, \u201cGrow it out if you want.\u201dYue Zhishi thought Song Yu was truly very strange. Sometimes, he was so unyielding no one could change or block his decisions, acting like an emotionless robot whenever he gave out an order. But sometimes, he was willing to yield and compromise so easily \u2014 as though there was a switch that could swap his attitude at any given time.But thinking of how Song Yu interacted with other people, that switch seemed to be invisible during those times.He was often very quiet, not quite willing to speak, but there would be times he\u2019d continuously and repeatedly bring up something small to Yue Zhishi. He\u2019d mention it with a bit of annoyance, but he wouldn\u2019t come straight out and talk about it \u2014 and it made Yue Zhishi think he was actually really cute.If it were possible, Yue Zhishi wished for that kind of Song Yu to never be found by anyone else. It would be best if other people only saw Song Yu with his shield against strangers, never able to find his hidden away switch.Yue Zhishi treated everyone generously, willing to share everything he had \u2014 except for Song Yu.The food started to arrive, and no matter whether it was the\u00a0roast meat\u00a0or other small dishes, they all matched Yue Zhishi\u2019s tastes very well. He ate whatever Song Yu gave him, and after he drank down a large bowl of\u00a0crab porridge, his whole body started to sweat.The window in their private room wasn\u2019t large, but they were able to see the ash grey sky and humid fog outside. The rain started again, pouring rapidly and substantially, and they could distinctly hear the sounds of rain even while sitting inside.Yue Zhishi took off his duffle coat and wore only his black woollen sweater. Rolling up his sleeves, he exposed a small section of his milky white arms.\u201cDoes your body still hurt?\u201dYue Zhishi had just picked up a piece of coconut milk pudding when he heard Song Yu\u2019s question. He paused, like he was carefully going through what he was feeling in his body. \u201cNot really. But I\u2019m still really sore.\u201d He lightly patted his legs and waist. \u201cJust like the day after running a long distance race. Although I feel a bit better than I imagined I would.\u201d\u201cImagined?\u201d Song Yu caught onto the word. \u201cWhen did you imagine?\u201d\u201cJust\u2026 just earlier.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s cheek puffed up from stuffing in the piece of coconut milk pudding. His large eyes flickered over in Song Yu\u2019s direction, and he said to him softly, \u201cPeople would think about it after getting together, right? Even though I didn\u2019t know when\u2026\u201dHe swallowed the pudding. \u201cI used to be a bit scared, because whenever I thought about that video I accidentally watched, I felt like it would really hurt. It was a bit frightening.\u201dYue Zhishi was very scared of pain. He had been the child crying the hardest whenever he was taken to get his vaccine shots.Song Yu wanted to say\u00a0then why\u2019d you push for it, but he understood Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart \u2014 so he didn\u2019t speak, only using a finger to poke at his inflated cheek.\u201cMmph!\u201d Yue Zhishi widened his eyes, expressing his displeasure. Song Yu enjoyed that reaction of his, and so he propped up his elbow on the table and gazed at him, silently watching him for a good long while before suddenly opening his mouth.\u201cLe Le.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d Swallowing his mouthful of red bean soup, Yue Zhishi raised his head and looked at him.\u201cThank you for trusting me.\u201dYue Zhishi had almost never heard Song Yu say thank you to anyone, seeming to find it hard to express his gratitude \u2014 but right now, he said thank you to him so very solemnly.\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d Yue Zhishi stroked Song Yu\u2019s arm. He didn\u2019t think trusting Song Yu was something worth thanking.\u201cYour first time should\u2019ve been really scary,\u201d Song Yu said.\u201cWasn\u2019t it also the first time for you too?\u201d Yue Zhishi curved his head, smiling at him. \u201cI even transferred you money as soon as I got out of bed.\u201dHe felt like Song Yu had utterly done what he said he would: he truly did treasure him.Seeing Song Yu faintly smile because of his teasing, Yue Zhishi relaxed a fair amount. He then said, \u201cWe\u2019re not quite the same as everyone else. Ever since I was a child, the first time I learned to call someone in Chinese, the first time I went to school, the first time I kissed someone, the first time I swam, the first time my heart moved for someone, the first time I fell in love\u2026 There\u2019s too many. I\u2019ve pretty much given all of my first times to you, because you have forever been by my side. So it shouldn\u2019t be you thanking me for trusting you \u2014 I should be the one thanking you.\u201dThe smile on his face was sincere and beautiful. \u201cThank you for staying with me as I grew up.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s emotions were surging, and he didn\u2019t want them to be noticed; he first turned his face away and heaped a bunch of food onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s plate. After a little while, he then deliberately reached out to touch Yue Zhishi\u2019s chin, to squeeze his face, attempting to shift his emotions.\u201cI ended up eating everything.\u201d Yue Zhishi finished off the last piece of the\u00a0rice noodle rolls\u00a0and collapsed back into his chair. \u201cI\u2019m so stuffed. You didn\u2019t even eat, you were so focused on teasing me.\u201dHaving played enough with his face, Song Yu reached out again to touch Yue Zhishi\u2019s belly. Almost as though he was talking to himself, he said\u00a0so soft.\u201cYeah, why don\u2019t I have abs.\u201d Yue Zhishi flipped up his woollen sweater to look at his stomach. He had two long, shallow lines of muscle stretching downwards, unlike the blocks of muscles Song Yu had. \u201cDo these count?\u201dHis waist was very thin, and the kiss marks on the skin had already darkened. Song Yu pulled his sweater back down, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re trying to find all different kinds of ways to get sick.\u201dWhen they were getting ready to leave, Song Yu fiddled around with something in his pocket. Thinking he wanted to tie him up again, Yue Zhishi proactively stretched out his wrists, placing them together.Song Yu was stunned \u2014 he pulled out Yue Zhishi\u2019s watch from his coat pocket, giving him a puzzled look.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi felt a bit awkward. \u201cOops.\u201dSong Yu lightly chuckled and lowered his head to look at the tiny red residual imprint on his wrists. Picking up one of Yue Zhishi\u2019s hands, he put the watch on him and adjusted the position of the dial. \u201cSince you like being tied up so much, I\u2019ll buy you a pair of handcuffs.\u201d\u201cHuh?!\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes went wide and round, but Song Yu pulled him into his arms and kissed him very softly.The door to their room was suddenly opened; it seemed like someone went into the wrong place. Yue Zhishi just happened to be facing towards the door, and he wanted to pull away, a bit alarmed \u2014 but Song Yu\u2019s hand held onto the back of his head. He didn\u2019t let go until that person apologised in a fluster, closing the door, and until Yue Zhishi started to lose the steady rhythm of his breathing.That kiss was their dessert. Yue Zhishi left the restaurant with Song Yu holding his hand, and he was still thinking about what Song Yu had just said. As they waited for a taxi, he leaned closely into his shoulder and said, \u201cWere you serious?\u201dSong Yu glanced at him, as though not sure what he was talking about. Yue Zhishi stretched out both his hands again, like a meek criminal pleading guilty.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWith your wrists like this,\u201d Song Yu caught his wrist bone in between his thumb and index finger and shook it, \u201cthey\u2019ll break at first impact.\u201dYue Zhishi thought, it\u2019d be best if he wasn\u2019t serious. But he also wished to have a pair of handcuffs himself; one side of it would be cuffed onto Song Yu\u2019s hand so he wouldn\u2019t be able to run away. Song Yu released his hand, and that hand dropped down, bumping into Song Yu\u2019s \u2014 the dials on the two watches lightly, gently collided into each other and released a sound. Silver watchbands twisted around each wrist, as though they truly were a pair of separated handcuffs.Once in the car, the taxi drove along the rainy street, looking like it was heading in no particular direction at all. It was as though they were lost within this city right in the eye of the storm, looping and circulating around in strange and similar-looking roads.And Yue Zhishi hoped he would never be able to get out.The taxi finally stopped at the old quarters of the city, because Yue Zhishi had said before that he wanted to see the architecture in the old quarters. Song Yu held up a heavy, roomy black umbrella. The rain had lessened slightly, but he still shielded Yue Zhishi in his arms, the umbrella forever slanted to a side. He was unwilling to let any rain fall on Yue Zhishi.The weather here wasn\u2019t exactly suitable for a date \u2014 perhaps even too terrible for a date. The wind was harsh, the rain persistently falling; the sky was dim and grey. There were almost no one on the streets, and when there were, they rushed past to wherever they needed to go. Yue Zhishi, living in a part of China far from the coast, kept pondering as he walked whether the typhoon had arrived yet. Was it currently arriving, or had it already arrived?His legs were still slightly sore, so Yue Zhishi kept wanting to pause after walking a short distance. The first time, Song Yu asked him why he stopped; after he explained, Song Yu would proactively come to a halt every time, like an instrument installed with an ability to precisely measure distances.\u201cOh, that\u2019s right.\u201d Yue Zhishi stretched out a hand to him, a cute look on his face. \u201cWhere\u2019s my present?\u201d He thought about Song Yu\u2019s joke at the dinner table. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have really brought back some nanmu, right.\u201d\u201cThat was just to trick Qin Yan. The northwest region doesn\u2019t have any nanmu.\u201d\u201cThen did you bring back a gift this time?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Song Yu nodded. Thinking they\u2019d rested enough, he took a few steps with an arm around Yue Zhishi. \u201cI\u2019ll give it to you once we get back.\u201dWith something to look forward to, Yue Zhishi became cheerful very quickly. They chatted as they walked \u2014 Yue Zhishi described to Song Yu how Nan Jia trained their models, and also told him he had a mock trial the week after next. He told Song Yu the time and place, but he didn\u2019t explicitly invite Song Yu to watch. When he asked Song Yu about his switch in research areas, it felt like he had something to say, but Song Yu didn\u2019t get the chance to organise his thoughts before the cellphone in his pocket vibrated for a long time.Song Yu stared at the screen, and Yue Zhishi stared at him. He felt like Song Yu\u2019s mouth, originally gently curled up, flattened downwards, turning into a straight line. He picked up the call, placing the screen next to his ear.\u201cHey, Dad.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s other hand was still holding up the umbrella, and he replied a few times in a very low voice. At first, Yue Zhishi thought he was going to lie \u2014 in his heart, he\u2019d already helped Song Yu think of excuses and lies. When he had been responding to Lin Rong\u2019s messages yesterday, Yue Zhishi had completely not mentioned Song Yu at all.But faced with his father, Song Yu was much more honest than he\u2019d imagined.\u201cI came to Guangzhou to look for Yue Zhishi. Yes, he\u2019s not too safe by himself.\u201d Song Yu looked off in another direction as he spoke, the lines of his profile appearing even stonier in the rain.\u201cIt\u2019s already done, we\u2019ll head back in two days\u2026 Mn, I know. Be careful on your business trip.\u201dAfter hanging up the call, Song Yu intentionally moved the umbrella to his other hand. He caught Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand, and just like how he would with all his personal belongings, placed it into his coat pocket. It wasn\u2019t clear exactly who he was trying to help feel secure.Song Yu could feel his heart thudding in dull, heavy beats. As though he was suffering from an auditory hallucination, his father\u2019s concerned voice kept echoing in his ear \u2014 but his sense of guilt distorted the words, transforming them.It was as if the words he\u2019d said on the phone weren\u2019t \u2018Le Le doesn\u2019t have a strong body, you need to take care of him, there\u2019s no difference between him and your actual younger brother.\u2019But rather, [I\u2019ve raised you, educated you for so many years \u2014 was it just for you to trick my best friend\u2019s orphan into bed?]His father\u2019s benevolence and righteousness were in front of him. Compared to him, Song Yu knew himself as vulgar \u2014 all the things he cared about came from a small, unimportant love, the result of hormones.He didn\u2019t want to be like that either. No one did.Lost in his thoughts, Song Yu didn\u2019t control his strength, and he only realised he\u2019d held on too tightly when he heard Yue Zhishi very quietly call out in pain.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Song Yu opened his hand, but Yue Zhishi rapidly clutched back at him.\u201cSong Yu, your hand\u2019s so cold,\u201d he said, covering Song Yu\u2019s fingers. \u201cI\u2019ll warm it up for you.\u201dWhat his father didn\u2019t know was: the orphan he\u2019d tricked away was not someone with a shallow and immature mind. Rather, he was a courageous boy ready to accept accidents and death at any given moment, willing to leave behind his ashes to him in a promise in his will.It didn\u2019t matter who else was in his position \u2014 who would be willing to let him go?They reached the corner of the street. In reality, the two of them weren\u2019t really looking at the scenery beyond the umbrella; they were only slowly strolling. Yue Zhishi felt like his words were suddenly emptied out, but he didn\u2019t want them to be so silent. He thought and thought, struggling, but before he could find a suitable topic, they were stopped by a young man.\u201cHi, sorry for disturbing you guys.\u201d There was an apologetic smile on the guy\u2019s face. \u201cCan you take a photo of my girlfriend and me? We\u2019re over there, I\u2019ll need you to come with me for a bit.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t speak, but Yue Zhishi quickly agreed. \u201cSure.\u201d He took the camera from the man\u2019s hand.\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic. There are so few people around today, we had to look around for a long time before seeing someone. Thank you so much.\u201d The young man mocked himself for not knowing how to pick the right timing, having come out to play during such terrible weather.Yue Zhishi kindly comforted him, saying it wasn\u2019t too crowded because of the bad weather.They followed the man for a while and only then realised there was a stunning gothic cathedral with two spires hidden away in the old quarters. Because of the wind and rain, there was no one else here \u2014 the cathedral\u2019s yellow coloured granite walls looked even more solemn and dignified, even slightly desolate, under the dreary sky.A young lady not too far away was holding up a transparent umbrella. She wore a long red knitted dress, and she was the only spot of bright colour in the area. She smiled so very happily, waving towards the man.\u201cYou can just press here. Thank you.\u201d After showing Yue Zhishi how to use the camera, the man swiftly headed towards his girlfriend and smiled at the camera, his arm slipped around her shoulders.In order for them to look nicer in the photo and to include the background, Yue Zhishi knelt down and angled the camera upwards. \u201cDone! How about one more?\u201dThe man loudly said yes and then pulled his girlfriend into his arms \u2014 he asked her if she wanted to kiss in such a special, meaningful place and only dipped his head when she shyly nodded. They shared an embrace and a kiss underneath the cathedral\u2019s\u00a0rose window.Having received a satisfactory photo, the couple left in gratitude. In an instant, only the two of them were left in front of the cathedral, cold and lonely. Yue Zhishi stretched out his head a bit, looking up at the structure, and said to Song Yu, \u201cI hear this is one of the world\u2019s four great cathedrals.\u201dHe thought Song Yu didn\u2019t know; unexpectedly, Song Yu corrected him and said, \u201cIt\u2019s one of the four great gothic cathedrals made completely of granite.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Yue Zhishi nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to visit here before heading back.\u201dHe gazed upwards for a while, not talking. Yue Zhishi\u2019s imagination always worked very quickly \u2014 seeing a beautiful and magnificent cathedral, he imagined white veils, fresh flowers, a loving couple celebrated by everyone and a priest reciting long oaths.The priest announced\u00a0you may now kiss. And so in Yue Zhishi\u2019s fantasy, that couple just then turned into a newly wedded bride and groom, hugging and kissing after exchanging rings. Bright and joyous smiles were on their faces.And he was simply just a spectator, standing beyond the cathedral doors. In this fantasy, he hoped Song Yu wouldn\u2019t stand together with him; he didn\u2019t want him to be barred outside.\u201cGood thing I didn\u2019t grow up in England.\u201d Yue Zhishi looked up at the cross perched on top of the cathedral, as well as the heavy clouds floating behind it.\u201cWhy?\u201d Song Yu was looking only at him.Yue Zhishi\u2019s gaze was still upturned, and he slowly blinked. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you be religious if you grew up there? I hear people who believe in Christianity think homosexual people will go to hell after they die.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to add even more guilt onto Song Yu\u2019s body.\u201cEveryone says God loves the world.\u201d Perplexed, Yue Zhishi studied the cross. \u201cWill God love the people in the world who fall in love with people of their same gender? Or will God punish their souls after they die.\u201dHe belatedly realised he once again spoke about death. Yue Zhishi lowered his head, very lightly saying sorry; he didn\u2019t know if Song Yu could understand why he apologised, and he wondered if he should explain.But he didn\u2019t expect Song Yu to grab his waist. The umbrella sloped to one side, splitting the world in front of his eyes into two \u2014 the oppressive black umbrella concealed the road they\u2019d come from, yet the cathedral in front of them remained complete and upright, witness to everything.Behind the umbrella, in front of the cathedral, Song Yu lowered his head and gave Yue Zhishi a kiss.It was a reverent and profound kiss, as though Song Yu was using his actions as a silent rebellion \u2014 defying faith, defying rules.From the moment he\u2019d widened his eyes in alarm to finally closing them, Yue Zhishi could feel his nose burning. There were no flowers, no crowd of people wishing them well, and even the sky was gloomy and stifling, pouring cold rain. It was as though millions and millions of silver needles were descending from the sky, stabbing directly onto their bodies.He realised he\u2019d changed: he enjoyed this rain, and found comfort in this joy stolen from suffering. The honey licked from the tip of a knife came so difficultly \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t find it sweet?At least this rain wouldn\u2019t shun them.Yue Zhishi opened his eyes only after Song Yu had retreated some distance. Fine droplets of rain stained his eyelashes, and his vision was slightly hazy. He looked up, face turned towards Song Yu, and thought he was like a statue of a god: tall and lofty, filled with taboos yet flawless and perfect.And yet he stood in front of the cathedral and said to Yue Zhishi, voice filled with blasphemy, \u201cI don\u2019t need God to love me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s enough just to have you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 80: The Heart Hiding Away JadeOn the second night of their hotel stay, Yue Zhishi and Song Yu soaked for a very long time in their bathtub with the beautiful ceiling to floor window.It was wildly storming outside, yet the storm contained so many flashing neon lights. Leaning back against Song Yu\u2019s chest, Yue Zhishi gazed out, feeling as though he was observing an exquisite Christmas snow globe \u2014 the scene inside was so very fake.Later, Song Yu moved Yue Zhishi\u2019s chin from the back, gently and silently raising Yue Zhishi\u2019s head, before lowering his own and kissing Yue Zhishi\u2019s forehead. After that, Yue Zhishi felt \u2014 it was them who were fake.They were the ones who were locked away in the snow globe.Before they went to sleep, Song Yu sat on the bed and said he wanted to listen to Yue Zhishi reciting his diary entries. It was nothing more than just random chatter, but Yue Zhishi actually went and brought out his diary \u2014 and not just one.\u201cWhy\u2019d you still bring these even though you were travelling so far away?\u201d Song Yu randomly grabbed one of the diaries from the pile and flipped through it.Yue Zhishi said, looking completely natural as though what he\u2019d done was to be expected, \u201cI thought you were still working outside. What if you couldn\u2019t fall asleep? If you called me, then I could\u2019ve read something out for you.\u201dSeemingly casually, Song Yu asked, \u201cAnd if I didn\u2019t call you?\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi pressed his lips together and then pretended to breezily flip open a page. \u201cThen I\u2019d just carry them all back home. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re heavy.\u201dBefore even two seconds had passed, Yue Zhishi spoke again, insisting, \u201cBut I think you would\u2019ve called me.\u201d He emphasised, not sure if he was persuading himself or Song Yu, \u201cSong Yu, the quality of your sleep is truly very poor.\u201dHe didn\u2019t think Song Yu could argue about something so irrefutable.\u201cI don\u2019t have poor sleep.\u201d\u201cThen why ask me to read my diary to you everyday.\u201dWith his head lowered, Song Yu squeezed Yue Zhishi\u2019s clean and slender fingertips. \u201cThat\u2019s because I really missed you.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be so candid all of a sudden, and for some reason, he started to stammer. \u201cBut, but you were still taking melatonin a while ago.\u201d\u201cSame reason,\u201d Song Yu quietly said.And perhaps the confusion and anxiety towards not knowing how to face the future were included in there as well \u2014 after all, to someone like Song Yu who preferred to take and fulfil every step according to the time and order written in his plans, \u2018not knowing\u2019 was undoubtedly the hardest.An impossible single-sided love wouldn\u2019t create so much pain since it was already established as \u2018impossible\u2019. But what he faced was a love that was \u2018possible\u2019 and full of possibilities, yet would pull each other into the abyss.Yue Zhishi lightly, softly kissed the side of Song Yu\u2019s face. \u201cI really missed you too.\u201dHe said, voice very low, \u201cI\u2019m already used to missing you.\u201dChoosing a diary entry that looked silly, Yue Zhishi started to read it out for Song Yu.\u201cI bumped into Xiao Yu gege\u2019s classmate today at the convenience store. I actually didn\u2019t have any money, I\u2019m really poor, but he wanted me to go with him to buy some\u00a0spicy strips. And then Xiao Yu gege\u2019s classmate said I was cute and even gave me a packet of\u00a0Wangzai milk candy. My own classmate also gave me half a bag of spicy strips.\u201dAs he listened, Song Yu went through the other diary in his hand. It was quite different from the one Yue Zhishi was reading from; this diary seemed to have been written when he was in his first year of junior high. His handwriting was much nicer, no longer crooked and messy, with hints of how it\u2019d look like after growing up.[School started today. The people in my class are all really nice, they even invited me out to drink milk tea with them after school. But I wasn\u2019t very happy.]Yue Zhishi continued reciting, \u201cEven though I don\u2019t have any money, luckily I have gege. I managed to get a free bag of candy.\u201dSong Yu continued reading on.[Why wouldn\u2019t he let me call him gege? I don\u2019t understand. And not letting other people know about our relationship \u2014 does he not want to be my gege that badly?After school ended, Jiang Yufan and I were in front of the milk tea shop and saw gege buying some books in the bookstore. He clearly saw me, but he still walked away. I felt a hole tear into my heart. I clearly drank so much sweet milk tea, but I couldn\u2019t taste it. Maybe it all dribbled out from that hole.It wasn\u2019t sweet at all. It felt both painful and bitter.Want to go back to elementary school.]\u201cThat\u2019s so funny, how could I\u2019ve liked taking things for free since I was a kid.\u201d Yue Zhishi flipped to another page, his mind still on the previous one. \u201cI remember people kept wanting to give me snacks at the park, but I couldn\u2019t eat most of them. I\u2019m so pitiful, the heavens gave me a face that could easily trick people into giving me things to eat and drink, but it took away my ability to casually eat just anything.\u201dSensing Song Yu\u2019s lack of response, Yue Zhishi turned his face over and raised his head to look at him. \u201cAre you listening?\u201dSong Yu let out a \u2018mn\u2019, closing the diary in his hand.\u201cShould I keep reading? Or are we going to sleep.\u201dSong Yu stroked his face. \u201cLet\u2019s sleep. Your voice\u2019s still a bit hoarse, don\u2019t read anymore.\u201dYue Zhishi said sure, and then lay down, prompting Song Yu to turn off the lights. The wind blew loudly outside, so loudly it was a bit exaggerated. It was as though this magnificent high-rise could collapse or be swept away by the wind at any moment, everything in imminent danger.The lights in the room darkened one by one. Song Yu didn\u2019t turn all of them off; he left the warmly yellow bedside lamp and lay down to face Yue Zhishi, silently studying his face. He was always subconsciously deliberating about how they could avoid any risks, avoid any danger \u2014 but in the end, he still wilfully allowed everything to turn into a situation different from what he\u2019d imagined.He really wanted to know what he should do in order to shape Yue Zhishi into a victim in front of his parents. He didn\u2019t want them to punish Yue Zhishi and him, and yet he wanted them to realise they were truly in love with each other and not the result of a one-sided coaxing \u2014 so that they could be forgiven.No matter the result, Song Yu could accept it \u2014 but he didn\u2019t want Yue Zhishi to bear it.He didn\u2019t want to see Yue Zhishi once again write down in his diary, [Want to go back to before we were together].And for this reason, Song Yu started to think,\u00a0what if.\u201cLe Le.\u201dHearing Song Yu call him, Yue Zhishi blinked open his eyes and shifted towards Song Yu\u2019s direction. The sound of his voice came gently, drifting through his nose. \u201cHm?\u201d\u201cIf we weren\u2019t together.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even finish his question.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know what he was going to say, whether it was a hypothesis he\u2019d already thought up or whether he was going to directly ask \u2018what would you do\u2019 \u2014 but to Yue Zhishi, it was all the same.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t speak.It was very rare for him to not answer a question from Song Yu.When he saw Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes turn red, gaze avoiding him and looking towards a different direction, and saw his chest rise and fall from his deep breaths, Song Yu couldn\u2019t continue. Very quickly, he leaned over and wrapped Yue Zhishi into his arms. He circled his ams around him with some strength and said he was just casually asking, there was no further meaning behind his question.But Yue Zhishi still didn\u2019t speak. Because of his silence, Song Yu instantly gave up many of the thoughts floating around in his mind.\u201cI won\u2019t ask such useless questions anymore.\u201d Song Yu kissed Yue Zhishi\u2019s earlobe, his voice very soft, very quiet as he promised, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for us to not be together.\u201dYue Zhishi held onto Song Yu\u2019s waist, burying his face into Song Yu\u2019s collarbones.He no longer had any ability to say lies like [I\u2019d leave all of you behind and live by myself].Song Yu had very repetitive dreams that night. He dreamed of an endless black sea, and he and Yue Zhishi were huddled against each other in an old and worn-out little boat. He liked being able to see what was coming at a glance, and yet he was trapped on the sea, adrift and directionless.After a period of time, Yue Zhishi suddenly stood up from his arms and walked to the edge of the boat, gazing outwards to the world beyond with great expectation. The Song Yu in the dream was a bit flustered, but he realised he couldn\u2019t move at all \u2014 he could only stare and watch as Yue Zhishi stood on the edge.Yue Zhishi fortunately didn\u2019t end up jumping down. He returned back to Song Yu\u2019s side, caressing his arm, and then embraced him.The boat didn\u2019t head towards any particular island, and once it became morning, Song Yu woke up. Yue Zhishi was correct \u2014 he truly did have poor sleep quality.Yue Zhishi was still sleeping next to him, his fingers lightly resting on Song Yu\u2019s arm. His breaths came evenly and deeply, and his curled up sleeping position was very similar to how he\u2019d looked in Song Yu\u2019s dream.Having just woken up, Song Yu\u2019s mind was still slightly cloudy. He wanted to get out of bed and drink some water, but he\u2019d just sat up when he felt something tugging at his hand. He looked over, lifting the caught hand, and saw a long and thin black ribbon tied around his wrist. He didn\u2019t know when it\u2019d been wrapped around him.Following along the line, he found the other side.It was tied around Yue Zhishi\u2019s right hand.\u2013The typhoon left Guangzhou together with them before they each went their own separate paths.The few days in Guangzhou had been like a dream: beautiful yet unrealistic. As he travelled back to his familiar campus, Yue Zhishi thought \u2014 it wasn\u2019t just Guangzhou.Ever since he\u2019d gotten together with Song Yu, every day was like a dream.Yue Zhishi fell asleep again on the bullet train, and when he woke up, he noticed he was holding something in his hand. Song Yu pretended to not know anything, allowing Yue Zhishi to clutch his arm and ask many, many questions, like \u2018is this your present to me?\u2019 or \u2018when\u2019d you put it into my hand?\u2019. He only admitted to it after he felt\u00a0 Yue Zhishi\u2019s chatter was possibly bothering other people, turning his head over and stopping Yue Zhishi\u2019s lips from moving with a kiss.\u201cI didn\u2019t actually find this. It\u2019s a mineral I bought from a local.\u201d Song Yu was extremely honest.\u201cThat\u2019s fine, I feel like you can\u2019t keep finding expensive stones anyway.\u201d Yue Zhishi played with the stone in his hand, a lustrous dark green seen from the cut side. \u201cWhat kind of stone is this?\u201d\u201cTibetan jade.\u201d\u00a0(z\u00e0ng y\u00f9)\u201cZ\u00e0ng?\u201d Yue Zhishi raised his eyes to look at him. \u201cThe z\u00e0ng from Tibet?\u201d\u00a0(x\u012b\u00a0z\u00e0ng)\u201cMn.\u201dYue Zhishi thought of the other way that first character could be pronounced and then suddenly cheered up.\u201cI like its name.\u201d Yue Zhishi held the stone carefully in his hands, treasuring it, and then held it to his chest.\u201cI\u2019m going to hide him away.\u201dHe\u2019d purchased many local snacks when he was in Guangzhou, wanting to bring them back for Lin Rong, but as soon as he got back, he realised he had no time to go home and visit her. Yue Zhishi became busy with his coursework and the mock trial that followed right after, and any leftover time was given to the arts festival.Having obtained their fabrics and, through Xiao Qi, found a clothing production factory willing to work with students, the team held meetings again and again, editing their designs, making their patterns before editing them again. Nan Jia placed all her time onto their models; Yue Zhishi would sometimes run to watch them train, relaxing after being exhausted from constantly modifying their work.\u201cI think you\u2019d really suit heading onstage yourself, probably a lot more suitable than these tall and dumb basketball players.\u201d Nan Jia teased him, \u201cWhat a waste of your small pretty face.\u201dYue Zhishi stretched, sitting crosslegged in front of a row of large mirrors. He was thoroughly pleased with the long legs walking in front of him. \u201cNo way, I want to rely on my skills to earn money for food. Besides, I need to earn lots and lots of money.\u201d\u201cWhy do you suddenly want to earn so much money?\u201d Nan Jia found him adorable.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Thinking he couldn\u2019t really say his reason out loud, Yue Zhishi grabbed at his hair. \u201cI just suddenly understood the importance of money.\u201dNan Jia released a long, long \u2018oh\u2019, before rushing up to fix someone\u2019s questionable stage walk.Yue Zhishi looked over, his gaze revolving around the other people also training their walk. He saw someone that looked very familiar \u2014 to the point he even took that person for someone else.But it wasn\u2019t him.\u201cSenior Nan Jia, that guy,\u201d he pointed at him for Nan Jia to see, \u201ccan you give me his contact details?\u201d\u201cI want him to try on my closing show outfit.\u201dAfter leaving the dance studio used for training, Yue Zhishi fell headfirst once again into his studies and stayed in a self-study classroom until very late. The corridor was very cold when he came out, and he abruptly very much missed Song Yu. Within the last week after returning back to campus, both of them had been so busy they\u2019d only had time to eat together or occasionally see other on the basketball courts. This sudden stretching of social distance between them left Yue Zhishi constantly in a daze, and he frequently thought about those close and intimate days they\u2019d spent in Guangzhou.His feet stopped in front of an automatic coffee vending machine. Yue Zhishi clicked on the screen with some hesitation, wondering if he should get a latte or a macchiato, and when he finally decided and chose one, someone appeared next to him as he was preparing to pull out his phone to pay.Raising his head, Yue Zhishi saw Song Yu stretch out a hand, cancelling the choice on the screen.He placed a glass bottle of warm milk onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand. \u201cDrinking coffee at this time. Are you planning on not sleeping?\u201dA very real sense of heat transmitted onto his skin, and Yue Zhishi only belatedly asked after a good few seconds had passed, \u201cHow are you here?\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t directly answer his question, merely taking off the scarf around his neck and wrapping it around Yue Zhishi\u2019s empty neck. \u201cI heard from Nan Jia that you were still studying in a self-study classroom. I came by on my way from the research lab.\u201dAlmost twenty minutes of walking lay between his research lab and this particular self-study classroom \u2014 there was no \u2018on his way\u2019.A wave of rich, strong sweetness gradually rose in Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart. A pair of girls walked past them, and one of them looked over; Yue Zhishi waited for them to disappear before easing slightly closer, saying to Song Yu with a small smile, \u201cWhat a coincidence you\u2019re here. I was just thinking of you.\u201dFaced with Yue Zhishi\u2019s straightforward expressions of love, Song Yu felt like he might take an entire lifetime and still not be able to get used to them. No matter how many times Yue Zhishi said words of love, Song Yu\u2019s heart would still faintly speed up, and then, like a cat with his tail stroked, lose a bit of his steadiness. Even though he hated losing his superficial calmness, if it was for something like this, he didn\u2019t really mind.He hoped Yue Zhishi would express his love to him for their entire lives.It was the deep of the night, and as they walked along the empty dark roads in the campus, Yue Zhishi would boldly grab Song Yu\u2019s fingers occasionally. His hand was very warm from holding the milk and was very comfortable to hold. Whenever there was any noise, he\u2019d let go in a panic \u2014 before realising it was just a stray cat.Before taking him back to his dorm, Song Yu brought Yue Zhishi through a small grove. It wasn\u2019t considered far from Yue Zhishi\u2019s dormitory building, and whenever he wasn\u2019t in a rush to head to class, he\u2019d sometimes give it a few more looks. Trees he couldn\u2019t name were planted here, and they turned spectacular in autumn, a whole field of gold with old leaves slowly, gently alighting like butterflies.At night, the grove was completely pitch black. There wasn\u2019t anything beautiful to see, and even the fallen leaves were like dark clouds headed onto the wrong paths.The ground, covered with leaves, rustled as they walked. Yue Zhishi held onto Song Yu\u2019s hand until they reached a large tree, and then he trampled on the leaves as he went around it, almost in revenge \u2014 this way, if someone passing by heard the noise, they would be able to guess there was a couple here.But they wouldn\u2019t be able to see them, wouldn\u2019t be able to realise it was Song Yu and him. The dark was their protective umbrella.\u201cHaving fun?\u201d Song Yu asked in low voice.Before he could reply and before he could take lift up his leg to take another step, Yue Zhishi suddenly heard the noise of rustling leaves coming from a different direction.\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming.\u201d Yue Zhishi dragged Song Yu behind the tree. He wanted to hide in Song Yu\u2019s coat, but his coat was all buttoned up; Yue Zhishi very anxiously rushed to undo them, throwing it open, and then slid his way in, the entire string of actions feeling a bit strange no matter how Song Yu looked at it.The grove wasn\u2019t small, and the sounds of footsteps were the scattered, irregular rhythm of two people. Unlike what Yue Zhishi had expected, they seemed to stop at a place not too far away.He stuck closely to Song Yu\u2019s chest, Song Yu leaning against the large tree, and the two of them maintained their silence.But the other couple knew nothing of what was happening, and they hadn\u2019t come to the grove with Yue Zhishi\u2019s pure goal of \u2018stepping on leaves\u2019. They spoke a few times \u2014 the girl\u2019s voice was witty and lively, and she threw out a very loveable joke. The guy pretended to be angry, saying if she continued to talk, he was going to kiss her.\u201cBut I want to\u2026 mmph!\u201dAnd then, Yue Zhishi could only hear the wet and breathy sounds of kissing.It was a bit awkward. Hiding in Song Yu\u2019s arms, he could feel his face burning and heating up a ridiculous amount as though he was drunk \u2014 even though he hadn\u2019t gotten drunk even once. The sounds became all the more distinct, and Yue Zhishi subconsciously wanted to move away from Song Yu\u2019s embrace. His body had just shifted when Song Yu\u2019s arms caged around his waist.He lifted his head; he gazed towards Song Yu\u2019s handsome face, unrealistic in the dark, and met his eyes.Using a voice only the two of them could hear, Song Yu warned, \u201cYou\u2019ll be seen if you move backwards.\u201dCrushed, broken leaves couldn\u2019t hide secrets.Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart was running very quickly. He couldn\u2019t move, yet he needed to try to not listen to other people\u2019s covert intimacy \u2014 he lowered his head in embarrassment, secretly regretting his decision to pull Song Yu here behind the tree.But Song Yu held onto him, the metal buckle on his belt wearing away at Yue Zhishi just like their current situation. Chests tightly pressed against each other, so closely united there was no space in between \u2014 even the cold, pleasant scent on Song Yu\u2019s body turned suggestive and scorching hot.When Song Yu dipped his head, his lips touching the tip of Yue Zhishi\u2019s ear, the fragrance cocooned around his difficult to speak out thoughts like fog.Opening his mouth, he used a tender voice to abduct away Yue Zhishi\u2019s reservations.\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to kiss me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His hands held onto Song Yu\u2019s back under his coat, and they were like two people tightly holding each other for warmth \u2014 and they were also like the backdrop for other people.Flames restlessly itched to rekindle during dry autumn nights, but they were suppressed, not allowed to set the field ablaze.In the forest covered with darkness, there were breathing and sucking noises and the clues of broken leaves. None of them belonged to them.They were only the shadows of that passionate couple.That feeling burned at Yue Zhishi until his consciousness blurred over. He lost strength, and even his initiative was snatched away, Song Yu doing all the things he himself had hesitated and not dared to do. His breathing stuttered.He faintly heard the sounds of clothes chafing against each other. He could also hear the couple murmur something in between their kisses, the words extraordinarily prominent through their needy voices. Words such as \u2018no\u2019, \u2018we can\u2019t\u2019.Slightly cool fingers touched his back, and Song Yu retreated a little, lightly kissing Yue Zhishi\u2019s cheek and earlobe. In a voice as light as air, he deliberately asked, \u201cCan we?\u201dYue Zhishi sincerely experienced how it felt to melt, unable to resist at all. He was entirely controlled by Song Yu \u2014 and suppression always brought about a rebound.He rested his face onto Song Yu\u2019s shoulder, and he could feel his breaths dampening the coat. Song Yu\u2019s voice was right next to his ear, and the sound of his low breaths were infinitely magnified, falling completely into him without any boundaries.The nodding of his head looked more like he was rubbing his face against Song Yu\u2019s shoulder, while Song Yu seemed to take asking for permission as more of a way to tease.It was hot and humid inside the coat; Song Yu turned autumn into the sticky and thick height of summer.While wearing its watch, that right hand gradually stroked up Yue Zhishi\u2019s spine. Trembling pleasure broke through his defences, and when Yue Zhishi was just about to moan, Song Yu\u2019s lips obstructed the possibility of him making any noise. Song Yu\u2019s hand circled around to the front of Yue Zhishi\u2019s body, and the cold watchband \u2014 whether accidentally or intentionally \u2014 passed over the tips of his nipples. His fingers followed closely behind, and they toyed with those stiffened nubs.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want to make any noise, but he couldn\u2019t help it; he bit down on Song Yu\u2019s lips with his blurry consciousness and wasn\u2019t able to control his strength, only feeling Song Yu\u2019s hand become more forceful. It trailed down his waist, exploring what was below.There was already nothing left to hide \u2014 Yue Zhishi had long gotten hard from his kissing. His desire was more honest than he himself was.Song Yu licked him with the tip of his tongue, silently telling Yue Zhishi to relax a bit as he enjoyed this kind of inhibited and restrained amorous love. Separated by underwear, his hand went to touch Yue Zhishi\u2019s hard cock while he used his other hand to pull Yue Zhishi\u2019s soft and warm hand towards his own. Their actions broke rules while they locked themselves under the rule of not being allowed to make a sound; the couple not too far away let out uncontainable moans that could set others on fire.He thought they would do something here, but suddenly, the sound of a phone vibrating travelled over the few metres to them and paused their intimate movements. Like a scared little mouse, Yue Zhishi wrapped himself tightly around Song Yu\u2019s back, not daring to move a single inch.\u201cAh, it\u2019s my dorm mate\u2026\u201d the girl said very quietly. \u201cProbably to ask if I was still coming back tonight.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go back, let\u2019s head out.\u201d The guy\u2019s voice carried an unexpected request, and he seemed to once again lower his head to kiss her face.Yue Zhishi involuntarily waited for her answer. He finally received the sounds of fallen leaves being stepped on, heavy and light footsteps moving away, until only he and Song Yu were left in this field of trees.\u201cI need to head back to my dorm too\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi whispered, begging for mercy, but Song Yu seemed to not plan on backing off at all. He took off his coat and surrounded Yue Zhishi in it, pressing him against the tree. Yue Zhishi\u2019s back was already drenched with sweat, his face flushed, and the white fog of his pants clouded his vision.He couldn\u2019t see clearly \u2014 he only sensed Song Yu kneeling down. He moved downwards in a way that made him look like he was willingly tumbling down from his lofty, high status, his knees supported by the soft and fluffy pile of leaves. Without anything holding it back, the moonlight shined directly onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s face, and it veiled over his naked desire.The moment his cock was swallowed, Yue Zhishi felt like he was going to suffocate. He weakly leaned against the coarse tree trunk, passively accepting the licking and the wet and smooth surface wrapping around him.\u201cMm\u2026\u201d He wanted to call out, and yet he didn\u2019t dare; he could only thread his fingers through Song Yu\u2019s short hair. Song Yu\u2019s hands were firmly pressing his hips down, as though nailing him to this large tree. In his delusion, it wasn\u2019t a tree behind him \u2014 it was a cross, given as capital punishment to those who\u2019d done forbidden things. Odd visions weaved together with extremely intense pleasure, and it was as though Yue Zhishi had taken an aphrodisiac hallucinogen, reaching his peak in the midst of hurried, rapid pants. He originally didn\u2019t want to come inside Song Yu\u2019s mouth, pushing at him, but he ended up being forcefully held in place. In the end, under the torment of sexual passion, he shot wildly into Song Yu\u2019s mouth.Getting up, Song Yu dragged Yue Zhishi into sharing with him an utterly sensual and sticky kiss.\u201cMm, gege\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi coughed a few times, his palms pressing against Song Yu\u2019s chest. The only thing he ended up getting was an even fiercer kiss \u2014 it even carried with it a trace of salty sweetness. He was flipped over and pressed back onto the tree, the coat on his body having fallen off from the embrace and the earlier pushing; the aged skin on the tree trunk scraped against his smooth thighs.\u201cClamp your legs together.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice was very low, the previously calm rhythm of it thrown into disarray from his soft pants. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t know how things had suddenly turned into this: he was pinned on a tree, gasping for air as Song Yu\u2019s cock slid in between his legs. Song Yu\u2019s fingers frequently kneaded at his ass with great strength, and the fluid below made his inner thighs especially messy. The thick and large front tip brushed past his sensitive back entrance and the skin between his legs an uncountable number of times; the tip even shallowly nudged inside, but it didn\u2019t truly enter.He was about to go insane \u2014 all his limbs were numb, and his body started to slide downwards, out of his control. Song Yu was pretty much hoisting him up as he thrust into him, and Yue Zhishi tried to turn his head around, thinking it\u2019d be hard for Song Yu to come like this. Panting, he asked, \u201cGe\u2026 Can I suck you off\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Song Yu soothingly kissed the back of his neck, restraining himself from leaving behind a mark on Yue Zhishi\u2019s body. \u201cBe good.\u201dYue Zhishi turned his head to him again, continuously telling Song Yu he wanted to kiss, he wanted to kiss him; he was softly whimpering like a puppy hungering for love. In this moment, he didn\u2019t want to care anymore if they\u2019d be found, if people would care that their love and sexual activity were incorrect \u2014 he only wanted to sink down into his lover\u2019s arms.What was different between them and that couple?Song Yu\u2019s cold and indifferent voice turned husky. He called him\u00a0baobao, easing over Yue Zhishi\u2019s chin to gently yet suggestively kiss him \u2014 both the tip of his tongue and his cock were the things entering. After having his yearning for kisses satisfied, Yue Zhishi was submerged even further; he imagined himself as the final winter cicada during this autumn night, dying and then coming back alive within Song Yu\u2019s heat and indulgence.He didn\u2019t know how many times Song Yu thrusted into him. His scalp turned numb, and when his legs could almost no longer stand up, he heard Song Yu quietly say again and again he loved him, he really loved him \u2014 and then he came onto his supple butt. The translucent cum flowed down the round and full shape of his ass, gathering on his thighs and the skin between his legs. Worried he\u2019d get cold, Song Yu pulled up Yue Zhishi\u2019s pants and buttoned them up, and then he picked up his coat, folding it over his arm, and embraced Yue Zhishi very tightly from the back.Yue Zhishi felt like he was a piece of cake with a bite already taken out of him. The white chocolate poured on top had yet to even set, still dripping, and someone had already nibbled at him. He had been tasted before being packaged and pushed into the carton, and now he had to pretend to be pure and clean.But having experienced the sweetness of being tasted, he felt like he hadn\u2019t had enough. He flipped over, his back weakly leaning against the trunk, and his hands went up and around Song Yu\u2019s neck like the vines soon to wither in autumn.Yue Zhishi grazed his nose against Song Yu\u2019s. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come in?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d be really painful.\u201d Song Yu stroked up and down his back and enveloped him securely in his coat. \u201cCold?\u201d\u201cHot\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi obediently rested on Song Yu\u2019s shoulders. Song Yu returned back to his usual immaculately dressed self, as though he hadn\u2019t ravaged anyone, hadn\u2019t made immoral love outdoors. But Yue Zhishi could smell his own scent on Song Yu\u2019s body; he even slightly hoped Song Yu would head back to his own dorm like this and have someone discover something.He longed for their secret to be broken apart \u2014 perhaps that was his motive behind trampling on those leaves, trying to attract someone\u2019s attention.And Song Yu seemed to be purposefully and painstakingly abandoning a small dog: he scratched underneath his chin but wouldn\u2019t embrace him, giving him only an incomplete sense of satisfaction.That way, he would long to see his owner even more.\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to head back just then?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice was very low. \u201cI\u2019ll take you.\u201d\u201cRight now?\u201d\u201cRight now.\u201dYue Zhishi impatiently kissed the side of Song Yu\u2019s neck, somewhat disobediently leaving behind a shallow trace, and then clung onto him, saying he wanted to be hugged. Song Yu refused; he once again said to Yue Zhishi, it\u2019s almost midnight, you should head back to your dorm.The air behind Song Yu\u2019s words flowed to the back of his ear \u2014 Yue Zhishi practically started quivering again.Song Yu said he needed to behave, to sleep early, he still had class tomorrow morning, and Yue Zhishi had almost no way to refute his words. He even slightly enjoyed this frustration born from not being given what he wanted.Song Yu took him to the front of his dormitory building, and he even nodded to the dormitory supervisor in polite greeting, gentle and refined. Underneath the supervisor\u2019s focus, he shifted closer and said to Yue Zhishi, \u201cMake sure you clean up well.\u201dYue Zhishi felt his legs twitching.\u201cIt must be nice to have an older brother.\u201d The supervisor auntie gave him a pleased smile after he entered. \u201cSpecifically sending you back despite being so late.\u201d\u201cMn.\u201dTeasing him so much so late at night, and yet not really fucking him.With his head lowered, Yue Zhishi quickened his footsteps, trying to dodge away. Even though his legs felt limp, even though his inner thighs were completely stained with thick and sticky fluid, each and every one of his steps chafed away at his shame. He looked at himself in the building\u2019s public bathroom mirror and did his best to conceal any traces, making himself look like a normal person as he returned back to his room.No one was asleep, his dorm mates all still gaming in fierce battles. Jiang Yufan glanced below his bed and saw Yue Zhishi grab his pyjamas before directly speeding into the bathroom with a red face. His game had just finished, so he came down from his bunk, headed towards the dorm\u2019s private bathroom and said to the closed door, \u201cLe Le, are you okay? Why are you so late?\u201dYue Zhishi had already pulled off his clothes. Realising that his body looked even more sullied than he\u2019d imagined, his cheeks heated up again. The feeling of wanting more after having had a taste was like ants gnawing at his heart.\u201cI\u2019m fine, I came from self-study. I forgot the time.\u201d He took a photo as he firmly and calmly said to his good friend outside the door, \u201cNo need to worry about me, I\u2019m sleeping as soon as I finish cleaning up.\u201dBut he spent a very long time in the shower. After he came out, he sat in front of his desk and stared at the milk bottle Song Yu had given him \u2014 he looked at it for a very long time, too.It was now cold, but he still drank all of it, not leaving behind a single drop.At midnight, Song Yu received a message from Yue Zhishi.[Le Le: Gege, will you sleep well tonight?]As well as the photo he\u2019d taken in the dim bathroom.\u2013For many days afterwards, Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t quite dare pass through that grove of trees.Jiang Yufan would even scoff as they walked past on their way to class, saying there were too many small forests on campus \u2014 the amount of couples in those places could probably string up an entire circle after catching them. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t dare respond.When eating dinner together a few days later, Song Yu\u2019s split lip had already scabbed over. Qin Yan even ridiculed him for it, but he didn\u2019t tell Qin Yan to shut up, only saying his lips had been dry from the weather. He even deliberately glanced at Yue Zhishi after finishing his argument.Like a qualified, good older brother, he advised Yue Zhishi to drink more water.Qin Yan turned his attention onto Yue Zhishi. \u201cLe Le, I hear the model you wanted to close your show is a new member of our basketball team?\u201d\u201cAh? Mn\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi swallowed the food in his mouth, nodding. \u201cYes, a senior in second year. I think he\u2019s quite suitable.\u201d\u201cAfter hearing it from Nan Jia, I even particularly ran over to look at him. I wanted to see which handsome guy it was from our team, and then when I got there \u2014 wow. I almost thought he was someone else.\u201d Qin Yan patted Song Yu as he spoke. \u201cHe looks quite similar to you from the back, and his height\u2019s pretty close too. It\u2019s just that his looks are quite far from yours.\u201dSong Yu completely didn\u2019t know about this, and he lightly arched an eyebrow. \u201cReally?\u201dHe looked at Yue Zhishi. \u201cHow much does he look like me?\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t know why, but he suddenly started to feel guilty. He rushed to explain, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look that much like you, it\u2019s just that his height and body are relatively similar. I didn\u2019t particularly look for him, I just saw him in the midst of all the models senior Nan Jia chose and thought the proportions of his body were relatively suitable\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat, why do you care? Maybe you should go yourself.\u201d Qin Yan laughed. \u201cMy good sir, you refused to go when Nan Jia asked you in so many different ways. It\u2019s no longer up to you now.\u201dAs though he found his words useless, Song Yu coldly laughed. \u201cI won\u2019t go and be a model.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019ll definitely watch the competition, right?\u201d Yue Zhishi finished listening and gave him an extremely pitiful look.\u201cBeg me,\u201d Song Yu said, right in front of Qin Yan\u2019s face.In order to get Song Yu to go, Yue Zhishi pestered him almost every day. He bought all different kinds of snacks for him, and even bought ten-plus cups of milk tea in one go to gift to the seniors in Song Yu\u2019s research lab. He intentionally said things such as \u2018you\u2019ve worked hard taking care of gege\u2019, and thus, everyone now recognised him.Because of his beautiful and exceptional face and easygoing personality, everyone jokingly called him Song Yu\u2019s little angel.The first time he\u2019d gone over, Song Yu even purposefully pretended to not know him, standing at the door and watching Yue Zhishi as he gave\u00a0snowflake crisps\u00a0to the senior sister who worked in the lab next door. With a cold face, Song Yu said, \u201cWho are you?\u201dYue Zhishi raised his head to look at him, and the senior sister who\u2019d just taken snowflake crisps from him also awkwardly stared at Song Yu, swiftly considering what exactly was happening.Wasn\u2019t this his younger brother? He wouldn\u2019t be a fake one, right\u2026.\u201cMy ge has a bad habit.\u201d Unmoved, Yue Zhishi turned back around and gave her a piece of candy. \u201cHe\u2019s liked teasing me since we were kids.\u201cAh\u2026 I see.\u201d The senior sister glanced at the usually ice cold junior brother and didn\u2019t argue back.She secretly thought, she didn\u2019t expect Song Yu to be that kind of person in private.And then, for many, many days after, Yue Zhishi serviced Song Yu with coffee and even said his workspace was really spacious, much warmer than a self-study classroom; he stubbornly insisted on staying in Song Yu\u2019s workspace to do his own coursework, even lying on the table for a nap during the middle of the day.Even though Song Yu kept saying he took up too much space, he still gave Yue Zhishi the comfortable revolving chair and sat in the cold wooden chair himself. When Yue Zhishi lay down in sleep, Song Yu sneakily held his hand, kissing his forehead when no one else was around.Every day as Yue Zhishi left, he would invite Song Yu to watch the show and then, without exception, be rejected.Until later, when Song Yu was caught by the senior sister from the research lab next door. Things went according to the usual plot, and she was truly embarrassed \u2014 but the question that came out of her mouth was\u2026\u201cDoes the mixed race boy who constantly comes to visit you have a girlfriend? I really like him, he\u2019s too cute.\u201dAnd so that very afternoon, Song Yu dragged Yue Zhishi, who\u2019d delivered himself to him, to the corner storeroom and told him to stop coming.But Yue Zhishi only looked at him for a little while, and then he abruptly hooked his arms around Song Yu\u2019s neck.\u201cSong Yu, you\u2019re so awkward.\u201dHe rose up and kissed him, only resulting in Song Yu pressing him down onto the table and kissing him until he couldn\u2019t get enough air.But stubborn Song Yu still ended up finally agreeing. He agreed to Yue Zhishi\u2019s invitation, but the tone of his voice was still very strange and difficult to read.\u201cSure, I\u2019ll go see what kind of nice clothes my substitute\u2019s wearing.\u201dYue Zhishi pulled out his professional occupation and refuted the word \u2018substitute\u2019 with extraordinarily well-founded reasons. Song Yu quietly listened to him finish, and then he once again emphasised \u2014\u201cHe\u2019s my substitute.\u201dHumans can\u2019t reason with cats, Yue Zhishi persuaded himself.The author has something to say:Le Le: been abandoned ( )Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The [Little Swallow Dressed in Flowery Clothes] team members were so busy they almost had no time to sleep, working through the nights to finish their accessories and final adjustments to their outfits. The opening of their show was very important \u2014 it was their first chance at catching everyone\u2019s attention.The first design that would come out was a collaboration between Xiao Qi and Zhou Yi. In order to sufficiently reflect their main theme, they created the \u2018green straw rain cape\u2019 from an ancient poem; a\u00a0sumptuous dress from the peak of the Tang Dynasty\u00a0lay underneath, with both the headdress and accessories all reminiscent of the dynasty. Nan Jia was going to personally model this outfit.But in the end, under the lights of the dress rehearsal, the effect of the outfit wasn\u2019t enough with its straw rain cape. After watching the video replay, Nan Jia thought the green straw rain cape was overly plain and was more suited for the later outfits inspired by martial artists Chen Pi had designed. The effect of it wasn\u2019t enough to immediately catch people\u2019s eyes.Everyone was at a loss, thinking there wasn\u2019t enough time to rectify it, and even Xiao Qi could only suggest using fresh flowers as a decoration for the cape.Nan Jia ended up raising her eyebrows at Yue Zhishi, who\u2019d been silent the entire time. \u201cWhat do you think? Your brain has a bunch of random ideas, quickly think of how we should decorate the cape.\u201dYue Zhishi was reclining on the table, twirling a pen. \u201cWe should give it up.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Nan Jia couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cEven you would give up?\u201d\u201cI mean give up using the straw rain cape in the opening.\u201d Yue Zhishi sat up straight and very earnestly said, \u201cI actually have an idea, but I don\u2019t know if we have enough time. I read through many history books earlier when I was researching, and the\u00a0Book of Sui\u00a0said that\u00a0Emperor Yang\u00a0\u2018met rain while hunting, slipping into oilskins\u2019. This \u2018oilskin\u2019 is actually what rich people used to wear as raincoats back in the ancient days.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea to pull off the straw cape after reaching the end of the T stage, but the model\u2019s outfit inside is actually too splendid \u2014 the status of someone wearing an outfit like that wouldn\u2019t be wearing a green straw rain cape.\u201dZhou Yi frowned. \u201cBut\u2026 how would we make an oilskin? Wouldn\u2019t it be too sticky?\u201dYue Zhishi spun his pen. \u201cIt\u2019s actually not hard, I read in a book that we need to soak silk in\u00a0tung oil. After that, we\u2019ll need to spread a mixture of soil and water over it before drying it out in a well-ventilated and shaded area. The oilskin won\u2019t be sticky that way. We can even spray water over it, it won\u2019t get drenched from the water on the stage. We can try.\u201d He lowered his head to look at his watch. \u201cWe still have time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d Nan Jia agreed. \u201cWe still have a lot of silk, and if it ends up looking good, it\u2019ll look more magnificent than a straw cape.\u201dSince the team had Yue Zhishi, Nan Jia and Qu Zhi, who were all filled with energy and productivity, they started working on the opening\u2019s plan b after confirming there were no other issues with the other rounds. With only twenty hours left until the competition, they dipped their leftover gold silk fabrics into the golden tung oil to produce an oilskin.The process was much harder than they\u2019d thought. Xiao Qi used a sewing machine to tailor the oilskin cape by hand, and then she felt like it didn\u2019t match with the bamboo hats. After Yue Zhishi modified the design, they decided to attach a pale golden veil over the very first bamboo hat in order to tie it in with the gold cape.Once they\u2019d applied three layers of the tung oil, Chen Pi and Zhou Yi brought back some mud taken from the mountains behind campus and mixed it together with water. They then spread it over the cape on a fixed board, drying it with a hair dryer and large electric fan. They waited for a good few hours, and the mud crust had only just dried by the time Nan Jia finished reconfirming their entire show\u2019s background music and timings.Xiao Qi peeled off the mud bit by bit, and when the completed cape fluttered over Nan Jia\u2019s body at 6am in the dressing room, everyone spontaneously cheered.Yue Zhishi could feel himself being covered in goosebumps \u2014 the joy and triumph of group creation exhilarated him.It was already 7:30am by the time they finished cleaning up. They needed to place all of the clothes and their accessories together into sets so that it\u2019d be convenient for the models to change into them. There were thirty sets in total, ten for each round; it was a significant amount of work.\u201cThere\u2019s a rehearsal at noon. We need to take our models over to the stage for practice, and then they\u2019ll need to go through makeup. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have much time to rest until the competition starts.\u201d Nan Jia checked her watch, still wanting to say something, but she couldn\u2019t hold back a yawn.Qu Zhi patted her own shoulder. \u201cRest for a bit?\u201dNan Jia glanced at her and was about to lean down; she curved over halfway and then straightened up again, giving her own face a pat. \u201cI can\u2019t, I\u2019ll end up sleeping really deeply.\u201dYue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cIn order to prevent our beautiful opening model from falling off the stage due to lack of energy, I \u2014 the leader for the Little Swallow Dressed in Flowery Clothes\u2019s team spirit \u2014 will allow you to sleep for a while.\u201d\u201cYeah, me too!\u201d\u201cSenior Nan Jia, sleep.\u201dAfter letting all three girls sleep on the chairs in the dressing room, the remaining three guys busied themselves with creating the outfit sets, and they finally completed them around 10:30am. Yue Zhishi felt like all of his muscles and limbs were cramped, not wanting to move at all, but they still needed to take their models to rehearsal.\u201cAre your parents coming?\u201d\u201cOf course, they have to witness the highlight of my life!\u201d Chen Pi bragged. He elbowed Yue Zhishi. \u201cLe Le, what about you?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Yue Zhishi nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re coming, they asked me for tickets a really long time ago. They might even record the entire thing.\u201d\u201cWow, your mom really loves you.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Even though she wasn\u2019t his true mom.He couldn\u2019t help but send a message to Song Yu, even though he knew Song Yu was in a meeting the entire morning.[Le Le: Your little boyfriend\u2019s about to turn useless from being overworked.]There were a ridiculous amount of people at the rehearsal. Yue Zhishi was already relying on coffee to continue staying alive, and he followed his team over, his heart jittering as soon as he heard the drumbeats of the stage audio. His entire body broke out in a sweat, and it felt like he was suffering from heart palpitations.He was originally standing next to Nan Jia, helping her double check each model, but Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart was truly beating too quickly \u2014 he wanted to find a place far away from the speakers where he could rest.\u201cEh? Where\u2019s the guy closing the show\u2026\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t hear Nan Jia\u2019s muttering to herself, walking away by himself to the door. He saw the long table where they\u2019d be checking tickets and wanted to rest there; unexpectedly, he met the team from the journalism school.Xu Lin was in front, and he immediately saw Yue Zhishi. He arrogantly asked him from very far away, \u201cMixed Sweetheart, why are you alone? Where are your useless underlings?\u201dHis heart palpitations yet to subside, Yue Zhishi barely managed to give him a look and didn\u2019t speak.Xu Lin thought something was strange, seeing his face so pale. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Didn\u2019t eat?\u201d He came closer, the tip of a finger poking Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm. \u201cAre you okay, you\u2019re really pale. Are you naturally this pale, or are you sick?\u201dYue Zhishi thought this guy\u2019s brain wasn\u2019t too normal, but he didn\u2019t want to say it out loud. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cAre you sure? Look, the competition comes second to your body. Let me take you to the hospital.\u201dThe rest of the journalism school\u2019s team behind him wondered at how he could\u2019ve said nonsense like the competition coming second. \u201cWait, Xu Lin, it\u2019s our turn to rehearse soon. You\u2019re not going to watch?\u201d\u201cAre flowers going to bloom with me watching?\u201d Xu Lin took hold of Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm, tugging him two steps towards the door. \u201cAre you going or not. Let me tell you, very few people can sit in my car.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s really no need. I\u2019m fine, I just had too much caffeine.\u201d Pushing off his hand, Yue Zhishi felt his legs weaken \u2014 but someone else caught him. He raised his head, and when he saw Song Yu\u2019s face, he even thought he was hallucinating.\u201cHow are you here?\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice was very soft. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say your meeting was going to run until 12:30?\u201d\u201cI left midway,\u201d Song Yu answered very succinctly, his hand going by itself to touch Yue Zhishi\u2019s forehead. He only looked at Xu Lin once he was sure Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t have a fever, and without any expression on his face, he asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cAh? I\u2026\u201d Xu Lin pulled back his hand a bit awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019m his opponent, the kind who\u2019ll press him onto the floor and fiercely pound at him.\u201dSong Yu frowned, thinking there was something wrong with this guy\u2019s brain, so he directly decided to ignore him. He pulled Yue Zhishi into his arms, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go and eat something first.\u201d\u201cBut I haven\u2019t told senior Nan Jia\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already talked to her. You need to take a rest right now.\u201dThe ignored Xu Lin stood where he was, and as he watched the two of them walk away, he boiled over in anger like a kettle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Song Yu walked just slightly faster, but Yue Zhishi still needed to softly call out to him from behind, saying, \u201cSlower, I\u2019m dizzy.\u201d\u201cWho told you to drink coffee on an empty stomach.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice was reproachful, not gentle.Even though Yue Zhishi had been criticised, he still obediently nodded. \u201cI know, I definitely won\u2019t next time.\u201d And then, he grabbed Song Yu\u2019s hand and put it on his chest, his voice even a bit playful. \u201cIs my heart beating really quickly?\u201dHe was very close to Song Yu \u2014 he could kiss him as soon as he raised his head.Song Yu pulled back his hand somewhat stiffly. He couldn\u2019t quite hold onto his attitude anymore; he was originally going to continue lecturing, but he ended up saying nothing else. He wanted to hug Yue Zhishi whenever he looked at him, but there were too many people.In the end, he slipped an arm around Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulders, something normal friends or brothers would do, and took him to the cafeteria closest to the auditorium. He bought a bowl of\u00a0preserved egg and minced pork porridge, as well as some\u00a0red bean glutinous rice cake.Worried he\u2019d stay outside for too long, Yue Zhishi ate very quickly. But the porridge was too hot; he couldn\u2019t swallow his first spoonful, and he opened his mouth and fanned at it with his hand like he used to.\u201cDo you eat every meal like it\u2019s your last?\u201dEven though he spoke very harshly, Song Yu still pulled Yue Zhishi\u2019s bowl of porridge over to himself and blew at it while he stirred it with a spoon, trying to lower the temperature as quickly as possible.Yue Zhishi swallowed and then stuffed in a triangular piece of red bean glutinous rice cake, his cheeks puffing up. \u201cYou\u2019re not eating?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll get hungry in a bit.\u201d Using chopsticks, Yue Zhishi picked up a piece of the cake and held it to Song Yu\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re staying with me for a long time.\u201dSong Yu lifted his head to look at him, asking, \u201cDid I say that?\u201dYue Zhishi smiled, a bit pleased with himself. \u201cYou coming here means just that. Hurry and eat.\u201d He pushed the cake into Song Yu\u2019s mouth, but Song Yu only ended up taking a bite; Yue Zhishi naturally finished the remaining half.He was very skilled at eating his food at a rapid pace. Since he was hungry to begin with, it took no effort at all for him to fulfil the food intake quota Song Yu had set, and because he also ate some carbs, his body gradually recovered and didn\u2019t feel as weak as it was at the start.\u201cI\u2019m so sleepy. I want to sleep for an entire day after this, good thing tomorrow\u2019s the weekend.\u201dThere were more people in the auditorium than when they\u2019d left after they got back. The models from the journalism school were rehearsing on stage, and Xu Lin, the strange and weird boy, was now coaching them very properly. Yue Zhishi pulled Song Yu to the backstage. It was very messy and very noisy, with sets upon sets of black dust bag covered outfits hanging on rows of portable clothing racks, and each school was separated into individual areas.Having arrived at the law school\u2019s section, Yue Zhishi saw Nan Jia and the rest of the team talking to the hair and makeup stylists. He called out to them, and Nan Jia saw him from far away and said, \u201cYou\u2019re back. Are you all right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Yue Zhishi pulled out the yoghurt and biscuits he\u2019d bought from the little supermarket near the cafeteria and shared them with everyone. He turned around, glancing at Song Yu, before turning back to his team. \u201cI brought in someone from another school, hope you guys don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cOf course we don\u2019t mind!\u201d Chen Pi was grinning as though he saw his idol. \u201cSenior Song Yu! Hello hello.\u201dSong Yu nodded in greeting, but he wasn\u2019t very good at handling people he wasn\u2019t too familiar with \u2014 he hardly spoke, only silently standing behind Yue Zhishi.\u201cIs it our turn after the journalism school?\u201d Yue Zhishi asked.\u201cWe had our rehearsal already,\u201d Nan Jia said. \u201cThere were a few models in the journalism school team who were delayed because of some school matters, so they switched times with us. Don\u2019t worry, the actual competition is still in the order of the initial drawing. We\u2019ll go up after the journalism school as the fourth team.\u201dUnder the stylists\u2019 instructions, Nan Jia sat in front of the vanity mirror. One did her hair, while the other started on her makeup.Zhou Yi double checked once again all of their accessories and then opened the biscuit Yue Zhishi had given them. \u201cChen Yu was almost late. Luckily he\u2019s closing the show, so he just managed to get in on time.\u201dYue Zhishi frowned. A large group of models entered, and the backstage became even more cramped, people pushing against others.After hearing the words \u2018closing the show\u2019, Song Yu\u2019s unflappable face had a bit more expression on it. \u201cChen Yu\u2026\u201d He turned his face sideways and looked at Yue Zhishi, mouthing out the word \u2018substitute\u2019 when their eyes met.Yue Zhishi\u2019s two hands moved into the shape of a large X, and then he pushed Song Yu out of the styling area. \u201cGo have some lunch first, Uncle and Aunt Rong are coming soon.\u201d He grabbed out three tickets from his pocket and stuffed them into Song Yu\u2019s hand. \u201cThese are your tickets, don\u2019t lose them.\u201d\u201cI feel like you guys really need a hand,\u201d Song Yu said, actively offering to help.\u201cNo need.\u201d Thinking of how he\u2019d been in a meeting all morning and had still yet to eat, Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want Song Yu to busy himself here \u2014 it\u2019d be too hard on him. \u201cWe have enough people. And since you\u2019re not familiar with this stuff, you\u2019ll need some time to learn anyway.\u201dYue Zhishi stroked his arm when he saw the reluctant look on Song Yu\u2019s face. He said, his voice tinged with a bit of cute whining, \u201cTruly. Gege, you should go.\u201d\u201cContact me if something happens.\u201d Song Yu held onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm. \u201cYour phone needs to stay contactable.\u201d\u201cNothing\u2019ll happen. Hurry and go rest, my body\u2019s really fine now!\u201d\u201cYue Zhishi.\u201d Song Yu was staring at him, a small team of hair and makeup people rushing past them. He pretended to be like a normal older brother and stretched out his arms. \u201cGive me a hug.\u00a0Jiayou.\u201d And then, he embraced Yue Zhishi.When their bodies were at their closest together, Song Yu said next to his ear, \u201cBoyfriends need to be used, understand?\u201dAfter he was let go, Yue Zhishi felt like Song Yu had taken away half of his heart.\u201cU-understood.\u201dDuring the actual show, both the front of the stage and the backstage needed to coordinate together in real time to prevent any accidents from happening. According to their previous tasks allocations, Yue Zhishi and Qu Zhi were responsible for the front of the stage \u2014 but since he hadn\u2019t been able to participate in the rehearsal earlier, Yue Zhishi immediately went to look for Qu Zhi after sending Song Yu away. He discussed with her the problems that had appeared in the earlier rehearsal as well as the overall process.\u201cThere was a model who walked too quickly earlier, so there was a section in our second round that was completely empty. The background music was still going, but everyone had already finished.\u201d Qu Zhi turned on the rehearsal video for Yue Zhishi to watch. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to be really careful with our timing and be ready to communicate with Chen Pi and everyone else at any time. If we have too much time left, we need to tell them to release the models a bit slower.\u201d\u201cOkay, I understand.\u201d Yue Zhishi then asked, \u201cWe\u2019ll be to the side of the front stage audience, right?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ve had a look at where we\u2019ll be standing, and the view\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s also pretty concealed.\u201dZhou Yi brought over their communication headsets, and after adjusting them, the voices of their team transferred over. Chen Pi was having some fun, joking around like a stand up comedian.All three rounds of their show had female models in the first half and male models in the second half. There were almost thirty seconds of rest time in between each round. If the models walked normally, there usually wouldn\u2019t much of an issue \u2014 at most, they\u2019d fall onstage. Nan Jia had already told each model an uncountable amount of times about what to do in case that happened.Time flew by extraordinarily quickly as they nervously prepared for war. The backstage was filled with the chaos of models getting dressed and made up, plans and designs being loudly yelled out and assistants from each school hurrying and running around.When he went to get their competitor ID cards, Yue Zhishi saw another set of clothing delivered to the journalism school. A skirt peeked out from the dust bag, and it looked excellently made.\u201cLe Le! Hurry, we\u2019re going to the front for a group photo of all the competitors.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t look at the journalism school anymore, preparing to go onstage through the models\u2019 waiting area. There were a bunch of boxes left here for some reason, almost three metres high, and someone had written \u2018equipment\u2019 on them with a marker.He looked at them and faintly felt like they shouldn\u2019t be here. He grabbed a worker who was passing by, an ID card on his chest, and said, \u201cHi, can I ask if these boxes can be moved away? A lot of models are going to gathering here in a bit, and I think it might not be a good idea to have the boxes here.\u201dThe worker inspected the boxes as well and said they were some of the props the stage had used before. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they can be moved away, I\u2019ll have to ask our manager first.\u201dInside Yue Zhishi\u2019s earpiece, Chen Pi was still rushing him to head over for the photo. Yue Zhishi could only ask again and leave it to the worker, and then he ran towards the front stage. All of the competitors from each school were gathered together, quite a large amount of people. Yue Zhishi only realised there truly wasn\u2019t much time left once he came out \u2014 the audience was already starting to trickle in.\u201cLe Le!\u201d\u201cHere.\u201d Yue Zhishi ran to stand behind Nan Jia, caught his breath and gave the camera an old-school peace sign that looked very cute with him doing it.He was getting ready to leave the front after the photos were taken, but then he suddenly heard someone yelling out his name from underneath the stage. It sounded like Jiang Yufan; Yue Zhishi followed the sound of the voice and saw a large group of people. Uncle Song and Lin Rong stood at the very front, and Jiang Yufan, Shen Mi, Qin Yan and Song Yu were behind them.\u201cI\u2019m going to say hi to my family.\u201dYue Zhishi ran down the long T stage to the very end, and Lin Rong and Song Jin also headed towards the front.\u201cYou guys came so early.\u201d Yue Zhishi crouched down, Lin Rong reaching out to stroke his head. Song Jin walked closer as well, and he kept repeating \u2018don\u2019t be nervous, you definitely can\u2019t be nervous\u2019 \u2014 Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t stop smiling.Lin Rong was wearing a pale pink Chanel-style tweed suit. Her makeup was soft and gentle, her hair coiled up low on her neck, and her entire outfit made her look particularly outstanding.\u201cAunt Rong\u2019s so pretty today.\u201d Yue Zhishi held onto her hand, swinging it back and forth. \u201cLike a super rich lady.\u201dLing Rong highly enjoyed his praise. \u201cBut of course. I have to make my darling look good.\u201d She even displayed the limited edition handbag she was carrying as she spoke. \u201cI even brought my most expensive bag. Ah right, Le Le \u2014 are you hungry? I baked some yoghurt bites for you before we came. Have some.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t babies eat those?\u201d Jiang Yufan couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter.She opened her bag and took out a large heap. Song Yu ridiculed in an indifferent voice, \u201cUsing the most expensive bag to carry snacks for the youngest kind of people.\u201d\u201cIf you provoke me again, I\u2019m going kick you out of the family, Song Yu!\u201dYue Zhishi still wanted to stay with them, but the backstage was already urging the people on the stage to clear out. He could only take the small bag of bites Lin Rong handed to him and hurriedly said goodbye to them.The moment he stood up, his eyes crossed over all of those adorable people and briefly connected with Song Yu\u2019s. He was standing at the furthest back. Song Yu\u2019s eyes were bright, and the corners of his mouth were gently curved up \u2014 in the midst of all the confusion and stress of war, he gave Yue Zhishi the most tender, most peaceful strength.Half an hour later, the opening ceremony began.The tickets Yue Zhishi had given were all in the first row. His parents were on Song Yu\u2019s left, and Qin Yan was on his right.Other than his previous debate competitions, this was actually Song Yu\u2019s first time participating in the arts festival. The auditorium was surging with people, many of them taking photos; many of the cameras weren\u2019t actually focused on the stage, but rather, on Song Yu.\u201cS.Yu, you\u2019re too eye-catching.\u201d Qin Yan shook his head.Song Yu kept his face cold, no different from a sculpture sitting in his spot. Qin Yan knew Song Yu very well \u2014 he knew this guy didn\u2019t like places with lots of noise, especially the kind of noise that could deafen ears. But he unexpectedly realised: today, Song Yu actually hadn\u2019t shown any dislike for where he was even though he wasn\u2019t seriously watching the show.\u201cI feel like the designs from the first two teams aren\u2019t very interesting,\u201d Qin Yan said to Song Yu, leaning closely into his ear. \u201cTheir themes were pretty cool, cyberpunk or whatever, but the clothing they made seemed to have just been copied from some movies.\u201dSong Yu wasn\u2019t really interested in the other schools, so he only nodded as though in agreement. He then asked Qin Yan which team was currently on stage.\u201cThis team\u2019s almost finished.\u201d Qin Yan looked at the list in his phone. \u201cNext up is the journalism school \u2014 oh, they\u2019re the ones favoured to win. There\u2019s a kid in their team this time whose mom is a famous designer, he\u2019s super talented. He\u2019s already provoked your brother a good few times already.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Song Yu quickly thought of something and gave out a summarised description. \u201cThat kid with a not quite normal brain.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve seen him?\u201dSong Yu hummed in agreement. \u201cSaw him at midday. He was pushing and pulling at Yue Zhishi, he didn\u2019t look very respectable.\u201d\u201cReally\u2026\u201d Qin Yan felt like it was incredibly insulting for someone to be called \u2018not respectable\u2019 from a respectable person such as Song Yu. But after thinking about it, he thought Xu Lin wasn\u2019t quite that bad.The host\u2019s voice pulled him out of his thoughts. \u201cNext up, our journalism and communication school will be revealing their designs!\u201dThe stage lights immediately dimmed; the large screen was also instantly covered in black.Suddenly, the darkened screen turned into a blue screen, indicating an error.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the WindowsXP blue screen of death?\u201d\u201cNo way, our university\u2019s computers aren\u2019t that old, are they?\u201dIn the next moment, the blue screen disintegrated into spots of light, diffusing out in a set rhythm; it felt like\u00a0lo-fi sci-fi. The background music started, the electronic distortion of a sweet female, barbie-like voice \u2014 it was an extremely retro millennial bubblegum dance song, one that had been popular for a time at the beginning of the century.The model opening the show had beautiful features. Her straight pink hair was pulled back into a high ponytail, and her outfit was made of tight, shiny silver patent leather. She wore a pair of baby blue sunglasses, a toy gun propped on her shoulder.Her stage walk was extremely professional, every step steadily landing on each pulse of the music. Multicoloured lights fell onto her and followed along with the curve of her walk, fully displaying the polarised light of her outfit\u2019s reflective material.The model\u2019s ending pose was to shoot at the sky \u2014 but what came out of the gun were sparkling silver fragments.\u201cNot bad.\u201d Qin Yan sat up straight all at once. \u201cEverything suddenly feels high-quality.\u201dSong Yu also raised his head to watch. It was true; the journalism school\u2019s opening display was gimmicky enough to capture everyone\u2019s attention, and they\u2019d also found a very expressive model to open their show. Several models followed behind her, all of the outfits highly consistent with the previous one and closely related to the main theme of \u2018millennium\u2019. They were way more professional looking compared to the previous two schools.\u201cThe choice of background music\u2019s also fantastic.\u201dJiang Yufan sat in the second row. He was initially following along with everyone\u2019s enthusiasm and enjoyment of the show, but as he continued to have fun, he saw Yue Zhishi in the corner under the front stage. \u201cEh? Le Le\u2019s over there.\u201dSong Yu gazed over as well and saw Yue Zhishi standing under the part of the stage where the models would enter.\u201cThey should be getting ready.\u201dSong Yu looked over from far away and saw Yue Zhishi wearing a white sweater. He\u2019d pushed one side of his hair behind his ear, and he looked particularly pure underneath the candy-coloured stage lights, standing out and out of place. He was absorbed in watching his opponent\u2019s productions, and he was like a child who\u2019d just entered a science museum \u2014 his eyes were glowing, and they would occasionally fill with wonder. He would even nudge Qu Zhi, who was standing next to him, and point at an outfit for her to see.Ever since he noticed Yue Zhishi standing beneath the stage, Song Yu had utterly no idea what designs or models came after. Everyone\u2019s eyes were on the stage, with the exception of Song Yu \u2014 from the beginning to the end, his eyes were focused entirely on the dark, small corner to the side of the stage.\u201cThe closing design for the show\u2019s too cool.\u201d Qin Yan was spellbound, and he patted Song Yu\u2019s arm. \u201cLook.\u201dHis gaze returned back to the stage. The final design was truly very different from the ones that came before; the model was in a massive translucent plastic globe, and it would slightly roll on the floor with each step the model took. The entire orb glittered as it reflected light, very much like the dazzling disco balls of the early 2000s.Once the model arrived at the end of the stage, she broke through the globe from the inside and came out, displaying her transparent latex one piece that looked highly technological.\u201cThis one\u2019s absolutely amazing. It\u2019s a large production, worthy of someone with professional resources.\u201d Qin Yan started applauding with a large part of the audience, and when the final model completed her run, all of the models returned back on stage. The students in the journalism team also came on stage, and they expressed their thanks to the audience together.Standing underneath the stage, Yue Zhishi studied their designs, almost forgetting they were the productions of his competitor. Many girls got onto the stage to gift Xu Lin flowers, and even Yue Zhishi thought they\u2019d deserved it. They had truly unfolded the future retro aesthetics of the millennium to its greatest.\u201cDrawing a good theme is really worth it,\u201d Zhou Yi sighed over the headset.Wearing all black, Qu Zhi held onto her earpiece and looked like a capable and experienced female secret agent. \u201cThe stage\u2019s clear. We\u2019re up next, prepare to start. Nan Jia.\u201d\u201cMn, I\u2019m ready.\u201dThe stage dimmed. Yue Zhishi coordinated with Nan Jia over the headset. \u201cOkay, the music and the screen next. Countdown.\u201d\u201cThree, two, one.\u201dA scroll painting of an ancient beauty wearing a\u00a0flower hairpin\u00a0unfolded apart on the screen, and they\u2019d specifically made it look like it was splashed wet by a bit of rain. The background music began with a peal of\u00a0pipa strings, and a shower of golden top lights fell onto Nan Jia as she opened the show.Rainwater started to descend onto the long, long T stage. Nan Jia strolled down it leisurely, her black hair combed up into a\u00a0high bun\u00a0with\u00a0buyao\u00a0hair ornaments\u00a0and flower hairpins. The\u00a0golden veil on her bamboo hat\u00a0shielded parts of her face, and she wore a\u00a0red, straight-collared chest-high\u00a0ruqun\u00a0embroidered with peonies. A gold silk oilskin lay on top.\u201cGood. There are still five more seconds, you can strike your pose.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes kept flickering between Nan Jia and the stopwatch in his hands.Nan Jia arrived at the very front and tilted her face sideways; a long and thin neck peeked out from the split in the veil. It was incredibly gorgeous.When she turned around, she picked up her dress and swept it high \u2014 the luxurious skirt flew up in a beautiful curve.\u201cThat would definitely be very pretty under slow-motion,\u201d Qu Zhi quietly said, watching Nan Jia.\u201cOkay.\u201d Yue Zhishi started to call out for the next model. \u201cGet ready to go up.\u201dSuddenly, he heard a loud crash from backstage; he immediately questioned Chen Pi, who was on duty in the models\u2019 waiting area. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What happened?\u201d\u201cSomething fell down.\u201dHe glanced at his stopwatch. The second model had yet to arrive at the entrance to the stage, so Yue Zhishi quickly said to Nan Jia, \u201cDo another pose once you get to the end!\u201dNan Jia strode down calmly, steadily and securely walking to the very end before turning around once again. They hadn\u2019t planned on taking off her golden veiled bamboo hat, but she pulled it off and revealed her entire face \u2014 she lifted up her chin lightly and gave the audience a faint smile.Chen Pi\u2019s voice continuously came through, and Yue Zhishi once again asked if something had happened.\u201cWait, someone\u2019s injured \u2014 I\u2019m checking now.\u201d\u201cFucking hell, who placed these steel framed boxes so high!\u201d\u201cOur model got hit because of you guys!\u201d\u201cStop yelling.\u201d Yue Zhishi was a bit flustered, and he walked back and forth in that dark corner a few times. He composed himself and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s injured? How many people? Is the injury serious?\u201d\u201cYour male model for the end of the show got injured! The boxes squashed his leg.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s heart seemed to heavily, fiercely fall. He didn\u2019t even realise he\u2019d actually crouched down; he breathed in deeply twice and then stood back up, flying to the backstage. When he saw that Chen Yu\u2019s leg couldn\u2019t even move at all, Yue Zhishi could still be considered as fairly composed.\u201cFirst change out of the clothes and then go to the hospital.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019ll we do about the closing?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s voice turned loud. \u201cThat\u2019s not as important as the model\u2019s safety!\u201dHe was tense from stress, and in order to prevent his hands from shaking, he tightly fisted them up and took two steps back and forth, his breathing coming short and fast from the clamour of the environment.Abruptly, a voice came through \u2014 Yue Zhishi turned his head around and saw a tall silhouette appear in the backstage, the light shining against it. That body took large steps towards him and pulled off its coat as it walked, throwing it to the side like a soldier preparing to head to the front line at any moment.\u201cSong Yu?\u201dYue Zhishi thought he was seeing things. He was just about to speak when Song Yu directly pulled him into his arms.He stroked Yue Zhishi\u2019s head like a dependable older brother and said some superficial words everyone could hear. \u201cDon\u2019t panic.\u201dSong Yu was as unperturbed as a model long since familiar with the entire process. \u201cI\u2019ll go up for him. Style me up simply, it needs to be fast.\u201dYue Zhishi had still yet to understand. \u201cWhy are you\u2026\u201dSong Yu looked at him, giving him an extremely stable strength.\u201cWeren\u2019t the clothes designed for me anyway?\u201d\u201cYue Zhishi, other people aren\u2019t dependable.\u201d He smiled and then eased closer to say to him \u2014\u201cNo one is as dependable as your boyfriend.\u201dThe author has something to say:Little Jade\u2019s talk of substitute was just him drinking vinegar and purposefully joking with his little brother. Since Le Le didn\u2019t invite him (Le Le thought he wouldn\u2019t want to do it, and Nan Jia wasn\u2019t able to successfully invite him) and directly went to find someone so similar to him that even Qin Yan thought that guy was him, he felt a bit sour. He also didn\u2019t say it in front of the guy and other people, he was just teasing Le Le, don\u2019t misunderstand Little Jade~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nan Jia\u2019s too beautiful.\u201d Qin Yan had been stunned the moment Nan Jia pulled off her bamboo hat during her second pose. He turned his head over, only to realise Song Yu hadn\u2019t been seriously watching the show at all; his head was turned to the side.He shook Song Yu\u2019s arm. \u201cYou really aren\u2019t interested in looks. Our Nan Jia\u2019s so pretty, and yet you\u2019re not even looking?\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t retort back. He said under his breath as though to himself, \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201dWithout waiting for Qin Yan to understand, Song Yu stood up and directly left.\u201cHey!\u201d Lin Rong had been focused on recording the show, and when she noticed her son suddenly getting up, she used a low voice to call out to him, trying to keep her rich lady demeanour. \u201cXiao Yu, what are you doing? Hurry and come back, your brother\u2019s designs are about to come out!\u201dBut Song Yu walked away without even looking back.Qin Yan thought Song Yu was sometimes truly very bizarre, but on second thought, perhaps he really did find the entire thing very boring.How could there be someone so uninteresting who didn\u2019t have a single shred of interest towards the pretty faces and perfect bodies filling up the stage.Just as Qin Yan was inwardly scoffing at Song Yu\u2019s indifference, Song Yu had already appeared in the backstage. When he saw the panic, he grabbed someone and asked what\u2019d happened, learning that the closing model had gotten into an accident.Yue Zhishi was calmly giving out commands. \u201cQu Zhi, you take over. The rhythm of the models going on stage needs to remain stable. Chen Pi, look for volunteers and helpers to clear these boxes and props away.\u201d He felt a bit of self-reproach. \u201cI should\u2019ve made sure they emptied out this area earlier.\u201dChen Pi was still very angry. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault. Blame the staff \u2014 we already told them about it, but they still didn\u2019t do anything. Once the competition\u2019s over, we definitely have to complain and get them to compensate Chen Yu!\u201dThey currently didn\u2019t have the time to think about future matters. Yue Zhishi caught Zhou Yi\u2019s arm and said, \u201cZhou Yi, please help Chen Yu change out of the clothes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d At this moment, Xiao Qi was no longer as delicate as before, coming forward to hold Chen Yu\u2019s arm. \u201cZhou Yi still needs to be responsible for the switching of models backstage. Let me do it.\u201dIn the beginning, everyone had worried about Xiao Qi\u2019s timidity and the possibility of her not daring to speak, and so they\u2019d assigned her to the styling team in consideration. Now that all the models had been dressed up and styled, the backstage truly did need a guy more.Their first round\u2019s runway was already more than half-finished. Qu Zhi was still at the front and was very steadily giving them feedback about the show \u2014 there wasn\u2019t much time left.\u201cAre you sure you can do it?\u201d Chen Pi felt slightly doubtful; after all, Chen Yu was over 180cm. Without even mentioning the fact Xiao Qi needed to support an injured person, her standing next to him was already the most adorable height difference.\u201cI can.\u201d Xiao Qi was very firm. \u201cI already called and asked two other guys in our year to come help.\u201dEverything was so urgent, and so everyone let Xiao Qi support Chen Yu over to change out of his clothes. Chen Pi thought about it after they\u2019d walked off, thinking it didn\u2019t feel quite right.\u201cXiao Qi\u2019s a girl with such extreme social anxiety, and yet she managed to call other people for help just for Chen Yu? And even going to a place like the hospital where there are so many people?\u201dZhou Yi found it strange as well. \u201cI saw Chen Yu constantly approaching Xiao Qi earlier, but she was still a bit afraid of him. Could it be\u2026\u201d\u201cNot bad, getting injured yet winning the loli\u2019s heart. Didn\u2019t get injured for nothing!\u201dYue Zhishi wasn\u2019t able to pay attention to the team\u2019s gossiping; he rushed over to the styling area to look for Song Yu after getting his clothes.There wasn\u2019t much makeup on Song Yu\u2019s face. His hair was combed upwards, exposing his superior features completely, but in order to coordinate with the surprise in the final outfit of the show, the stylists had Song Yu put on a pair of smokey blue contacts.\u201cYou have the clothes?\u201d Song Yu looked towards Yue Zhishi, the deeply blue colour of his eyes underlining the cold and unhurried air about him.\u201cMn.\u201d Yue Zhishi pulled down the clothes from the rack. There was a certain order to the way the clothes needed to be worn, but since Song Yu was only there as an emergency model, he wasn\u2019t sure how to wear them \u2014 and so Yue Zhishi, as the designer, needed to assist.Only the two of them were in the dressing room. Yue Zhishi guided Song Yu through the clothes while he continued communicating with his teammates through his headset.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d He swept his eyes over his watch. \u201cThree minutes are enough.\u201dPulling off the sweater he had on, Song Yu revealed his bare chest. Yue Zhishi accidentally met his eyes as he handed over the clothes, and he lowered his head back down bashfully. \u201cUh, that one goes inside. And the translucent button up raincoat goes outside.\u201dSong Yu saw his pink ears and was just about to tease him about why he was so embarrassed when they hadn\u2019t done anything when the door suddenly opened. Moving on reflex, Yue Zhishi pulled open that shirt meant to be worn on the outside and covered Song Yu up; he swiftly turned his head around and said to the intruding model from another school, \u201cSomeone\u2019s changing.\u201dThe model instantly apologised and closed the door. Yue Zhishi let out a sigh in relief \u2014 and yet Song Yu started to chuckle.\u201cWas that necessary?\u201d He pinched Yue Zhishi\u2019s face and then pointed at the shirt in his hands, ridiculing how Yue Zhishi had done something without thinking. \u201cThe shirt\u2019s transparent.\u201dThat line was so familiar.Yue Zhishi pushed the clothes into his hand, fumbling, and urged as he turned around, \u201cHurry and change.\u201d\u201cLooks like the puppy\u2019s very protective of his food,\u201d Song Yu said, voice casual. He put on the inner blue shirt and then abruptly realised there were some dark red splotches on it \u2014 they looked like intentional embellishments, but they looked even more like bloodstains.Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart was pounding; it had been like that since Song Yu had suddenly appeared. He felt like he still couldn\u2019t understand Song Yu.\u201cHow did you end up here?\u201d Yue Zhishi sniffed. He kept his back to Song Yu as he softly said, \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want everyone looking at you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct, I don\u2019t like it when people do. But how I treat someone depends on who it is. You didn\u2019t ask me.\u201dYue Zhishi spun around without conscious thought and argued to Song Yu\u2019s face, \u201cDidn\u2019t senior Nan Jia look for you?\u201dSong Yu had already changed into the clothes and took the cowboy hat from Yue Zhishi\u2019s hands, hanging it on his waist according to Yue Zhishi\u2019s previous instructions. He repeated his earlier words once again. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me.\u201dYue Zhishi first frowned, and then that pair of large eyes blinked twice before he finally pouted.\u201cHow could there be someone as troublesome as you, I even thought you\u2026\u201d\u201cHow could there be someone as silly as you,\u201d Song Yu said, interrupting his thoughts. \u201cI waited for so long, only to end up waiting for someone very similar to me. You may as well anger me to death.\u201dYue Zhishi was just about to cutely whine, but then Qu Zhi\u2019s voice came through his earpiece. He didn\u2019t stay there for much longer, holding Song Yu\u2019s hand as they ran to the models\u2019 waiting area.Within the congested and chaotic corridors, the person he loved most ran with him towards that bright stage. And the clothes he\u2019d thought would never touch his body: they now emerged openly and honestly towards everyone \u2014 through him.\u201cIt\u2019s the second round\u2019s final outfit right now.\u201d As she stood under the stage, Qu Zhi said to the model, \u201cYou\u2019re going a bit fast, take a few more seconds on your pose.\u201dYue Zhishi and Song Yu arrived at the models\u2019 waiting area, the boxes now already cleared away. Chen Pi\u2019s eyes widened as soon as he saw Song Yu; from the bottom of his heart, he sighed, \u201cHandsome guys will be handsome\u2026. Le Le, would I be able to reincarnate into your family in my next life?\u201d\u201cStop joking around.\u201d Yue Zhishi focused on the monitor screen. The model for the luminous bodysuit Qu Zhi had designed for the second round had already finished, and she was currently heading back inside.The remaining models were ready for the last round. Yue Zhishi told them, \u201cEveryone open your umbrellas, remember you have to head out with them held up.\u201dFaced with such a tense and complicated competition, that small child who had once been only able to follow around behind him was now able to independently take charge. There was a subtle and complicated emotion in Song Yu\u2019s heart \u2014 he really wanted to stroke Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair.Chen Pi started to count down, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart started to race. This final round was their elevation of their \u2018rain\u2019 theme; Yue Zhishi had essentially thought up the conceptual design by himself while the other team members had merely refined and filled it in.If Song Yu hadn\u2019t been standing by his side at this very moment, no matter how nervous he was, Yue Zhishi wouldn\u2019t have displayed it. He would\u2019ve forcefully clenched his hands together and paced back and forth a few times at the very most, but Song Yu was now in a place Yue Zhishi could reach out and touch.He was constantly, continuously being reminded \u2014 he now had someone he could depend on.Yue Zhishi caught Song Yu\u2019s arm and called out gege once, the speed of his words coming very quickly as he said, \u201cMake sure you\u2019re paying attention to your earpiece, we\u2019ll immediately let you know if something\u2019s happening. Oh yes, the pose \u2014 you still remember what I said, right? You can also just walk naturally, and what else is there\u2026 Let me think.\u201dSeeing how nervous he was, Song Yu deliberately asked in order to divert his attention, \u201cWhat reward will you give me for helping you with something so important?\u201dYue Zhishi tilted up his head as soon as he heard the question; his pair of brown eyes slightly widened, but he very quickly accepted Song Yu\u2019s exploitation. \u201cUp to you. I\u2019ll give you whatever you want.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cReally. I\u2019ll give you anything.\u201d Yue Zhishi was as earnest as a little child taking out all of his toys.Song Yu\u2019s mouth lightly curved. He ended up ruffling Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair.The second round\u2019s lights were the highly saturated blue of cyber-culture, and so they darkened during the thirty seconds of transition.\u201cThree, two, one.\u201d Chen Pi commanded the third round\u2019s opening model, \u201cGo!\u201dSeparate rays of platinum lights aimed downwards and lit up the long and narrow T stage, and more rain came from the top of the stage compared to the last two rounds.The first model alighting onstage was particularly tall, wearing a black beret and a black mask. A large black transparent umbrella made out of a soft plastic was held up, and there was a silver chain twined around the handle, snaking all the way to the hand holding the umbrella.\u201cDid you design this outfit too?\u201d Song Yu stared at the model\u2019s stage walk, thinking his steps looked like a female walk.\u201cMn. I designed half of the outfits in this round.\u201dThe outermost layer of the model\u2019s clothes was an ill-fitting, voluminous black suit jacket. There were many white paper seals attached to the jacket, as though he himself was sealed away. Step by step, the model arrived at the halfway point of the T stage, and then Yue Zhishi held onto his headset and told the model, \u201cNow. Move quickly.\u201dHe had just spoken when the model lifted his left hand and tore off the suit jacket on his body, revealing a vividly red one-piece dress. The ill-fitting suit jacket was thrown off the stage, and in the midst of the audience\u2019s cries of surprise, he took off his hat \u2014 long, straight and jet black hair cascaded down. For his pose, he pulled off his mask and revealed striking feminine eye makeup and red lips.Someone below the stage had already realised. \u201cDoes this stand for trans?\u201d\u201cI think so, no wonder they got a male model. The outfit should mean that!\u201d\u201cSo cool!\u201dThe audience\u2019s emotions were already ignited by the third round\u2019s opening. Holding up the umbrella, the model walked away, leaving behind a silhouette that didn\u2019t quite match with the common expectations of the world, and yet was still extremely beautiful.Models headed onstage one by one immediately after. One of them was dressed in numerous fabrics that had been processed to look like the \u2018shabby\u2019 trappings of youth. She undid her buttons for her pose \u2014 a golden heart lay inside.Another model wore an oversized black windbreaker, derogatory words such as \u2018you\u2019re terrible\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019re too ugly\u2019 printed on top. Her mask had a smile on it, and for her pose, she took it off. There was still another mask underneath \u2014 except now, it held lips downturned in the shape of a cry.Other than these, there was also a girl who wore a white dress dotted with rain. The front of it was perfect and gorgeous, and yet the back had been shredded, stained with mud and about to fall apart. A lofty woman, high above others, whose magnificent clothes were stamped with banknotes and flowers and yet held no joy on her face. A lady, specifically made up to look like an old granny, who wore a flowery skirt only a young girl would wear.All of these vastly different models walked towards the audience in the rain. The stamped words on their clothes looked different at first glance, but they were actually all made from the various shapes of the character for \u2018rain\u2019; from\u00a0oracle bone script\u00a0to\u00a0regular script, the evolving fonts came together and became distinct words.There was one similarity among the models. Every single one of them held up a black umbrella \u2014 an umbrella that was wrapped in chains.\u201cIt\u2019s almost your turn.\u201d His heart about to fly out of his chest, Yue Zhishi double checked that the captions on the screen were changing.Compared to the journalism team\u2019s eye-catching production, the law school\u2019s stage background was extremely simple. They used only a shifting screen of rain for their final round, a glass window in front. The glass was faintly fogged up, and there were two rows of English words that looked like they had been written by a finger.The first row had not changed since the beginning.\u00a0Rain is a gift of nature.But the second row would change upon each model\u2019s appearance, corresponding to the ever-changing chemical element of their theme.The caption for the closing of the show was a classic line from a movie:Love is a force of nature.When Song Yu saw the background quote that belonged to him, he realised his suspicion from earlier when he was changing his clothes had now received an answer.And so, in the last few seconds before he walked, Song Yu stood at the entrance to the stage and leaned in closely to Yue Zhishi. In the midst of the music that hid away everything, he said one line.It was also a line from a movie.\u201cI wish I knew how to quit you.\u201dIt was as though an electric current ran through Yue Zhishi\u2019s entire body when he heard, and his clear, light coloured eyes filled with an unforeseen joyful surprise as if in answer to an obscure code word.He was a little too surprised, and before he could say another word, Song Yu had already walked onstage.As he walked out towards everyone\u2019s eyes, Song Yu wore a blue button-up shirt smeared with blood. He was clearly holding up an umbrella like all the other models, but he also wore a dark yellow raincoat on top of his shirt. It was a long, transparent button-up raincoat, reaching down to his calves. Compared to many of the other outfits earlier, this one wasn\u2019t stamped with words and looked extraordinary clean.The two colours overlapped, and the two shirts nested into each other; both the impact and the composition of the design were extremely outstanding. A seemingly mismatched western cowboy hat hung in front of his waist, and it was the largest hint for this entire outfit.And that pair of melancholy blue eyes also came from a male lead within a movie.The rain came down in torrents, and Song Yu strode towards the end of the T stage and then, stood still.Some audience members below had already guessed the name of the movie from the line on the screen and Song Yu\u2019s outfit.\u201cTwo bloody shirts stuck together, as well as a cowboy hat and blue eyes. Is this an homage to\u00a0Brokeback Mountain?\u201d\u201cSo this outfit is hinting at those who identify as homosexual?\u201dFor his pose, Song Yu lowered his right hand that was holding up the umbrella. Different from everyone else before, he gave up on concealment \u2014 he stoically, calmly accepted the rain.And this torrential rain accepted him as well. The rainwater drenched the raincoat he wore on the outside, and the originally transparent fabric, after being doused with water, suddenly revealed different and diverse colours.Little by little, a curved rainbow appeared on his raincoat.\u201cSo your finishing move is this!\u201d Chen Pi sharply smacked Yue Zhishi\u2019s arm. \u201cThat\u2019s too cool, how\u2019d you do it?\u201d\u201cI changed the raincoat fabric using a special process. I added a rainbow pattern onto it using dyes that would change colour after coming into contact with water. You wouldn\u2019t really be able to see it when the fabric\u2019s dry, the pattern\u2019s pretty much completely clear. I experimented so many times just for this \u2014 the dye was also purchased in Guangzhou.\u201d\u201cYour trip to Guangzhou was so worth it, not only did you get fabric for the first two rounds, you even managed to get special dyes. The rainbow\u2019s too beautiful.\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Yue Zhishi looked at the Song Yu displayed on the monitor, and let out a smile.\u201cOnce the skies clear after the rain, shouldn\u2019t there be rainbows?\u201dAfter Song Yu turned around, all of the models once again headed onto the T stage. Except this time, the umbrellas in their hands were no longer black \u2014 but rather, hued with rainbows.Every single model was a distinctive symbol, representing different people. They stood on the rain-soaked stage, and the background music, originally pounding with rhythm, also started to transform. It turned into the classic title song from\u00a0Singin\u2019 in the Rain.When the lyrics \u201cI\u2019m singing in the rain\u201d arrived, the entire mass of models did the same thing as Song Yu: they let go of the umbrellas that concealed yet shackled them and stood next to each other on the long, long stage, shoulder to shoulder. There were no lampposts here for them to dance on, so everyone faced the audience with their shoulders straight and heads high. They raised up their faces under the heavy rain that fell equally for every single person, and like Andy from\u00a0Shawshank Redemption, they opened up their arms towards the sky and torrential rain, unreservedly rejoicing in the gifted equality and freedom.And the words on the screen also changed \u2014 it became a row of beautiful handwriting.[We are so different, but we are all standing in the rain.]The music faded, and the hazy, fogged up glass window was no longer the same. Everything became clear, shadows replaced by sunlight, and the rain left behind a final present: a glorious rainbow.The stage\u2019s rain also stopped, and the stage lights became incredibly bright. The designers headed onstage one by one, gathering together with the models.Thunderous applause rang out, many students even giving them standing ovations. It was as though this was no longer only a clothing exhibition \u2014 but rather, a powerful and brilliant statement.With his own selfish motives, Yue Zhishi stood next to Song Yu as everyone watched on. There was a small rainbow flag on his cheekbone, and with his soft hair and white sweater, he looked like an angel.Just like everyone else on the stage, he openly held Song Yu\u2019s hand underneath the lights and bent over at the waist, giving the audience a deep bow of gratitude.The moment he straightened up, he turned his head; he and Song Yu looked at each other and shared a smile.Xiao Qi managed to rush back for the end, her neck circled by Chen Yu\u2019s scarf. Qu Zhi and Nan Jia were hugging each other; Chen Pi, who had always been their team\u2019s uplifting and humorous heart, had reddened eyes, and Zhou Yi \u2014 always so mournful and uncertain \u2014 finally, in this moment, laughed in happiness and self-assurance.\u201cThank you to the law school for showing us such a spectacular fashion show! Now, let\u2019s have our next school competitors begin their show!\u201dCurtains descended on their dream, and as the group of people walked off stage, Song Yu arrived behind Yue Zhishi within the surging flow of people. He caught his arm and took him away, separating them from the crowded sea of people.They were very close to each other, Yue Zhishi\u2019s back almost leaning on Song Yu\u2019s chest. But Song Yu\u2019s raincoat still had water on it, and he remained a slight distance away, not wanting Yue Zhishi to get wet.Having thought of something, Song Yu couldn\u2019t help but lower his head and ask, easing in, \u201cWhy did you turn the outer shirt into a raincoat?\u201dThe two overlapped shirts were an homage to\u00a0Brokeback Mountain\u2019s tearjerking ending. Ennis had lost Jack forever and was unable to take even his ashes away. It was only when he noticed the postcard and the two shirts hanging together in Jack\u2019s closet that he started to cry in grief, understanding that those items were all that were left of them.They left that cramped passage and entered the relatively spacious backstage. Yue Zhishi slightly retreated, going to Song Yu\u2019s side.\u201cAs I was designing this round, I remembered many things. I thought of the first time I came here to look for you after you distanced yourself away from me once you started university. I was holding a clear umbrella that couldn\u2019t conceal anything. At that time, the feelings in my heart should\u2019ve been completely exposed, and it was just a coincidence that you also lying to yourself. To you, I am forever transparent.\u201d\u201cDid you know?\u201d He tried to recount his memories in a relatively light voice. \u201cBefore I confessed to you while woozy from a fever, there was a period of time I was confused. I remember there was a day that kept pouring. I couldn\u2019t sleep and didn\u2019t dare look for you; I just hid myself away and watched the movie. I also read the short story. There\u2019s a line in the story that goes: \u2018I placed your shirt in mine, thinking I could protect you that way.\u2019\u201dThe backstage was filled with noise, and in order for Song Yu to hear him clearly, Yue Zhishi leaned in so closely that his warm breaths softly puffed onto the side of Song Yu\u2019s face.\u201cThe two shirts represented the two of them. Even if there was nothing left in the end, the shirts were like two inseparable layers of skin, growing together.\u201dSong Yu was silently listening, and he thought of the globe he\u2019d covered up, layer by layer. Retaining a lover\u2019s shirt didn\u2019t quite match Yue Zhishi\u2019s personality, but it was very much something foolish he himself would do.\u201cIt was raining really loudly outside the dorm at that time. The noise was so loud I started to imagine strange things. I imagined that if it were me, I definitely couldn\u2019t be only a cotton shirt worn on the outside, especially on such a rainy day.\u201dHe gazed towards Song Yu\u2019s deep eyes, a pure smile on his face.\u201cI\u2019d be a transparent raincoat \u2014 that way, you wouldn\u2019t get rained on.\u201dThe author has something to say:The night he finished\u00a0Brokeback Mountain, Yue Zhishi decided to leave behind his ashes in his will. But at that time, he had only dared to write: my older brother, Song Yu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85: Romantic DirectionAfter hearing Yue Zhishi\u2019s words, for a moment, Song Yu thought he was the luckiest person in the world.The best child in the world had arrived to his side, had become his lover and had given all of himself to him.There was nothing else worth regretting.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Yue Zhishi rubbed the back of his neck, not quite daring to look at Song Yu\u2019s face after saying so much. \u201cI only just managed to hold back from telling you. Ah, that\u2019s right,\u201d he caught Song Yu\u2019s sleeve and rolled up the cuff of the inner shirt for him to see, \u201cI stitched this.\u201dIt was a row of numbers, and at first glance, it looked like a row of cold and indifferent binary numerals.11011010He revealed a very adorable smile and said to Song Yu in a very quiet voice, \u201cOur birthdays.\u201d\u201cThis could be considered as one of your birthday gifts. Out of all the outfits, I made only this shirt by hand.\u201d He said to Song Yu, \u201cXiao Qi taught me, and it took me a long time to finish it. It\u2019s for you.\u201d\u201cThen why were you prepared to let someone else wear it?\u201d Song Yu made things difficult for him on purpose. \u201cThe shirt\u2019s first time wasn\u2019t even left to me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d Yue Zhishi held his arm. \u201cChen Yu wasn\u2019t wearing this one\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s another one, and that one doesn\u2019t have our birthday numbers on it. That one\u2019s not made by hand. It\u2019s in a box in the changing room, I put it there after Chen Yu took it off. I grabbed this one from my bag \u2014 it was meant to be for you.\u201dSeeing him explain so docilely, Song Yu lifted a hand; he wanted to stroke Yue Zhishi\u2019s face, but with so many people around, he could only ruffle his hair.He was very clear: Yue Zhishi, at nineteen years old, was already very mature and could calmly handle any problems. Even if he hadn\u2019t appeared today, it wasn\u2019t as if Yue Zhishi wouldn\u2019t be able to complete this fashion show; he would\u2019ve had many, many ideas.But when he remembered how Yue Zhishi had looked when struggling to hold back his surprise, when he saw these deeply hidden little heartfelt thoughts, Song Yu felt Yue Zhishi was still the same as when he\u2019d been three years old, when he\u2019d been six years old. In expressing his love, he was forever a pure and simple child, never asking for anything in return.As they walked towards the changing room, Song Yu had his head down, examining the cuff. The numbers had been stitched neatly and carefully, and the remnants of the traced stitching pattern could still be seen. He unexpectedly discovered a dark blue embroidered decoration to the side of numbers \u2014 it looked like a set of Libra scales. There was a scorpion in its left scale, and a love heart in its right.In the past, Song Yu would always sink into a kind of pessimistic anticipation that was very much out of character for himself, thinking that perhaps what Yue Zhishi felt for him was something similar to a nestling who had no way of parting with its childhood companion. He\u2019d thought Yue Zhishi would one day understand what love was, leave him and then run towards the person who had actually stirred his heart.But now, Song Yu understood \u2014 from the beginning to the end, it had simply been himself who had been too arrogant, too conceited.The person he liked was a natural born romantic.No one knew how to love someone better than Yue Zhishi did.\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Yue Zhishi hoped to get a single word of praise, and so he slightly exaggerated as he told Song Yu just how long it\u2019d taken him to make the shirt, just how hard it had been to use the sewing machine.\u201cI failed so many times, but good thing I\u2019m pretty smart. I didn\u2019t prick my hands when embroidering.\u201d\u201cStop talking.\u201dYue Zhishi was a bit startled when he heard those words from Song Yu; he even slightly widened his eyes, thinking he\u2019d said something wrong. But Song Yu lowered his head, shortened the distance between them and told him, in the bustling and crowded backstage \u2014\u201cIf you keep talking, I won\u2019t be able to hold back from kissing you in here.\u201dHis heart leaped out of his control.\u201cYou should hurry and change, your hair\u2019s all wet.\u201dHe was so very cute as he pushed Song Yu away with his head lowered, his soft white sweater faintly rising from the press of his thin shoulder-blades.Thinking of Yue Zhishi\u2019s bare back, Song Yu reached out to touch those blades before heading inside to change his clothes in satisfaction.Yue Zhishi called the injured Chen Yu as he waited for Song Yu. He asked after his injury, and he\u2019d initially thought Chen Yu wouldn\u2019t be in a good mood \u2014 but unexpectedly, Chen Yu was almost floating from happiness, excitedly telling Yue Zhishi he was no longer single.That was fantastic news. After hanging up the phone, Yue Zhishi happily stretched; as soon as he lowered his head, he saw Xu Lin walking towards him. He was still as usual, \u2018Mixed Sweetheart\u2019 coming out of his mouth as soon as he opened it.\u201cStop calling me that.\u201d Yue Zhishi glanced back at the changing room, worried Song Yu would hear.\u201cWhy? Are you worried about me having feelings for you?\u201d Xu Lin crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI do think you look good, but I prefer the tall, handsome, bright and cheerful active type.\u201dYue Zhishi frowned in confusion. \u201cYour description\u2026\u201dHis first reaction was \u2014 he knew someone like that. His second reaction was \u2014 no matter how he thought about it, those words didn\u2019t seem to describe a girl at all.Just as Yue Zhishi was pondering whether he should first introduce a friend to Xu Lin or whether he should first politely ask his sexual orientation, Xu Lin held out a hand to him.\u201cI heard you designed the closing show outfit. It was very well-done. I\u2019m impressed.\u201dIt was probably habit for Yue Zhishi to reach out and hold a hand that\u2019d been stretched out; he only felt something was off after he clasped Xu Lin\u2019s hand in return. \u201cWait, why are you like a different person today? Shouldn\u2019t it be something like, \u2018you guys are too weak, I\u2019ll pound you into the ground\u2019?\u201dThe look on Xu Lin\u2019s face shifted as he saw Yue Zhishi imitating him, quickly pulling back his hand in both awkwardness and embarrassment. \u201cThen what do you want? Should I bow and apologise, and then say I shouldn\u2019t have called the law school useless? That I shouldn\u2019t have asked you to model for me?\u201dYue Zhishi laughed, the memory of their first meeting emerging in front of his eyes. He then went to hold Xu Lin\u2019s hand again and gave it a firm shake. \u201cThank you.\u201dXu Lin froze for a bit. \u201cYou\u2019re so weird\u2026 Why are you thanking me?\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re also someone very talented. I\u2019m very happy at being recognised by you.\u201dAfter finishing their handshake, Xu Lin was a bit lost at where he should put his hand. He wanted to frantically stuff it into his pocket, but he realised his current jacket had no pocket.In handling cats and everything similar to cats, Yue Zhishi was very adept.Song Yu came out of the dressing room and just so happened to see Xu Lin and Yue Zhishi exchanging their WeChats; he stood by the side and watched, arms around his chest.Xu Lin saw him as well. There was still some lingering fear in his heart towards Song Yu, and so he didn\u2019t talk for much longer. \u201cMixed Sweetheart, I\u2019m off.\u201d\u201cI have a name\u2026\u201d Helpless, Yue Zhishi watched as he walked off. He saw the meaningful look on Song Yu\u2019s face as soon as he turned around.Song Yu repeated Xu Lin\u2019s name for Yue Zhishi, each word clearly and distinctively leaving his mouth. \u201cMixed Sweetheart.\u201dYue Zhishi immediately declared his innocence. \u201cHe just said he\u2019s not interested in me.\u201d\u201cHe better not be.\u201dHaving gone through what they\u2019d felt was a war, everyone in the law school team stayed behind to clean up backstage. The event had finished by the name they came out again, and they followed the instructions from the organiser\u2019s workers, arriving at the assigned seating area for all of the competitors. The law school\u2019s seats were at the furthest right in the front row, close to the exit corridor. There was an extra seat there, and so Yue Zhishi implored Song Yu to sit with him.Their hearts that had taken so much effort to calm down once again turned anxious. Even though everyone had consistently comforted each other by saying the results weren\u2019t important, now that they had truly arrived at that moment, there was not a single person who didn\u2019t care.\u201cNext, let\u2019s have one of our judges, Ms Zhang Yunqing, announce the results of our clothing design competition in this year\u2019s arts festival.\u201dChen Pi leaned over to Yue Zhishi. \u201cShe\u2019s that classmate of Xu Lin\u2019s mom. She\u2019s also a designer.\u201d\u201cI hear Xu Lin\u2019s mom ordered a celebration cake for her son a long time ago.\u201dCake\u2026Yue Zhishi tugged Song Yu\u2019s sleeve and looked at him under the dim lights. \u201cI want to eat cake too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make one for you.\u201d Song Yu touched the back of his hand.His heart instantly steadied; Yue Zhishi naturally stopped caring anymore \u2014 no one else\u2019s recognition was worth Song Yu\u2019s.Ms Zhang stood on stage, her demeanour outstanding, and took hold of that sealed envelope, saying a few opening words. The workers called out towards the law school team, and they gathered with the other competitors before heading onstage together, standing in front of the large screen as they waited for the results.Zhang Yunqing opened the envelope, glanced at it and then announced into the microphone the third place winner, a faint smile on her face.Before the first and second place winners were announced, the audience yelled out the teams they supported. The screams for the law school and the journalism school were particularly loud.\u201cBeing the dark horse doesn\u2019t feel too bad,\u201d Qu Zhi said, chewing on some gum. She didn\u2019t really care about their result.\u201cAm I imagining things? I feel like there\u2019s a bit more people yelling out our name?\u201d Zhou Yi continued to speak without much confidence.Qu Zhi shook her head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not imagining it.\u201d\u201cI hope the judges can hear the cries of the common people\u2026\u201d Chen Pi sighed. \u201cBut the other team really is well-connected, people like us with no connections shouldn\u2019t place our hopes too high.\u201dBut Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t agree. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Xu Lin definitely isn\u2019t the type of person to rely on connections. Even though his mother can help him hire the best stylists and clothing production factories, he\u2019s a really dignified and very prideful person. He won\u2019t use his family background to fix the competition.\u201dZhang Yunqing didn\u2019t immediately announce the winner. \u201cI\u2019d like to say a few things. As the judges were deciding between first and second place, there was a small disagreement among us. This competition was honestly very spectacular. Comparatively speaking, the construction of one school\u2019s clothing designs were extremely excellent, and their clothes were also highly fashion-forward. Many of their clothings looked very professional, and if we displayed them to the public, there\u2019s a chance many people wouldn\u2019t believe the clothes were made by students.\u201dShe should be talking about the journalism team. Yue Zhishi admitted that every single outfit from the journalism team\u2019s \u2018millennium\u2019 theme was created very exquisitely \u2014 they looked like they were made from very experienced designers and productions.\u201cBut,\u201d Zhang Yunqing chuckled, \u201cthere was another team today that taught us the significance of design. It doesn\u2019t matter how much professional experience we have, how many master craftsmen we know \u2014 what matters is whether we have creativity. Creativity is the eternal spring of design, its endless source of power, and the battle between these young adults today allowed us to see formidable sparks of inspiration. It gave us a wonderful surprise.\u201d\u201cI must say that the allocation of themes in this competition wasn\u2019t very fair. Some themes were inherently ripe with aesthetic power, while others had no relation to fashion at all. All of us as judges couldn\u2019t imagine that such a common theme based on nature with no link to fashion could actually be developed to this extent. If this theme had been given to me, I myself might not be able to create such designs. And that must be the value behind a design competition.\u201dShe smiled. \u201cEspecially that moment when rainbows appeared after the rain and everyone chose to accept the storm\u2026\u201dWithout waiting for her to finish, the audience started to cheer, shouting out law school\u2019s name exactly like they\u2019d done during their show. The sounds of their joy overwhelmed the auditorium, spreading deeply into the corners of the room.\u201cSo\u2026\u201dShe looked over at the several people sitting in an unremarkable corner. \u201cCongratulations to the law school, winner of this year\u2019s arts festival clothing design competition!\u201dThe entire audience burst into well-deserved screams.Yue Zhishi hugged Song Yu in happiness and also gave Chen Pi, who was sitting on his left, a hug. With those teammates he\u2019d battled shoulder to shoulder with for so many days, they walked together towards the stage to receive their award.\u201cAnd at the same time, congratulations to our journalism and new communications school, second place in this year\u2019s arts festival clothing design competition!\u201d Zhang Yunqing said, \u201cWe also have two special awards: a Best Production Award and a Most Creative Award. The teams in the journalism and law schools are respectively awarded them as well, congratulations to the two of you!\u201dIt was as though they were dreaming. The moment he walked onstage, Yue Zhishi gazed towards Song Yu\u2019s direction. Song Yu was peacefully sitting below, applauding, and a gentle lake seemed to be reflected in his dark eyes. He was Yue Zhishi\u2019s source of inspiration, as well as the direction to which his heart turned.After receiving their award, it was actually Lin Rong who was the happiest; she ran to embrace him as soon as Yue Zhishi came off the stage, excitedly bouncing a good few times on her stiletto heels.\u201cOur darling\u2019s too amazing.\u201d Lin Rong smooched both of Yue Zhishi\u2019s cheeks. He was already used to it, and so he didn\u2019t expect to be teased by the people around him.\u201cAnd our Xiao Yu, such a handsome boy, who gave birth to such a good-looking son\u2026\u201dSensing danger, Song Yu turned sideways and dodged his mother\u2019s kiss attack, circling to the right of Yue Zhishi. He said to Lin Rong, \u201cMs Lin, calm down.\u201dAs Yue Zhishi laughed at them, Song Jin arrived behind him and kept giving him praises. \u201cThe concept for your third round was really quite good. Even though people of our generation would feel the impact of it more than people your age, it could be considered as a breakthrough in perception to a certain extent.\u201dNan Jia joked with Song Jin, \u201cUncle, are you referring to the transgender model when you say you felt a large impact?\u201d\u201cAh, so that\u2019s the correct term.\u201d Song Jin nodded. \u201cNot bad, not bad, I\u2019ve learned a bit more about the world today.\u201dLin Rong thought today was a day that must be celebrated, so she invited the entire team and all the friends who\u2019d come to watch the show to dinner. The large private room was filled to the brim with people, and everyone chatted with great delight.After dinner, Lin Rong and Song Jin prepared to go home \u2014 they told the two of them to come home next week before they left, saying they needed to celebrate gege\u2019s birthday together. The large group of people sent off that pair of adorable parents, and then headed back to campus.Everyone continued to make a fuss on the way back, swiping through their Moments and Qzones to watch the videos many people uploaded of the clothing design competition.\u201cI think senior Song Yu might have more and more people chasing after him in the future.\u201d Chen Pi clicked his tongue a few times and then asked Song Yu in curiosity, \u201cSenior, what\u2019s your type?\u201dYue Zhishi had initially been incredibly sleepy, but his drowsiness disappeared as soon as he heard Chen Pi\u2019s question \u2014 but he was next to Jiang Yufan, and so he didn\u2019t turn around to look at gege.Qin Yan had lots to say. \u201cOh him \u2014 he doesn\u2019t consider anyone worth a second look. He\u2019s going to stay single for his entire life.\u201dNan Jia laughed and said, joking, \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily true, Song Yu might be the kind of tragic guy who\u2019s head over heels in love with someone he can\u2019t get for many, many years.\u201dEveryone cracked up; only Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t dare laugh. Song Yu was someone who very much held grudges, and if he laughed now, who knew when Song Yu might randomly decide to retaliate.Song Yu didn\u2019t answer, an attempt at a smile on his face. Everyone thought his lowering of eyes meant he didn\u2019t want to answer, but actually, he\u2019d been gazing at the shadow of Yue Zhishi on the ground the entire time.Once they\u2019d walked all the girls back to their dorms, Qin Yan could tell Song Yu wasn\u2019t planning on going back to his dorm. \u201cS.Yu, are you going to your apartment?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d\u201cThen Le Le, what about you?\u201d Qin Yan wrapped an arm around Le Le\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you spend some time at your Qin Yan gege\u2019s place. I have lots of games, want to play together?\u201dSong Yu flung Qin Yan\u2019s hand away and said to Yue Zhishi without any expression on his face, \u201cHis apartment\u2019s not nice, it doesn\u2019t have ceiling to floor windows.\u201d\u201cHey! What\u2019s up with you?\u201dSong Yu looked back at Qin Yan. There was no inflection in his voice as he asked, \u201cWhere would he sleep if he went to your place? In between you and your girlfriend?\u201dQin Yan was lost for words, and he agitatedly pointed at Song Yu for a good long while before he turned to Yue Zhishi, deflated. \u201cUh, Le Le, how about next time. We two brothers will have a fun night in the next time my wife\u2019s out.\u201d\u201cWho are you brothers with?\u201d Song Yu icily scoffed.\u201cYou and I are brothers, you two are brothers \u2014 therefore, Le Le and I are also brothers. What kind of university tyrant are you if you can\u2019t even understand a simple calculation like that.\u201d Qin Yan threw down his words. He then saw Le Le following them out of campus and asked, \u201cAre you staying over at your brother\u2019s?\u201dYue Zhishi nodded. \u201cMn.\u201d\u201cNot bad. Even though your brother doesn\u2019t have a good temper, has a dead face and doesn\u2019t know what it means to be gentle and considerate\u201d\u2014Qin Yan took a breath\u2014\u201che still saved you guys today and cared for your brotherly relationship. Give your brother a massage once you\u2019re back, so he won\u2019t threaten you in the future with it like someone extremely petty.\u201dYue Zhishi was just about to retort back and say his ge was gentle and super considerate and knew very well how to take care of someone, but Song Yu responded to Qin Yan with simple and blunt three words.\u201cShut up, you.\u201dThey weren\u2019t in the same building, so the three of them separated after entering the neighbourhood.Now that there were only Song Yu and Yue Zhishi left, everything suddenly turned peaceful, no other noise except their offbeat footsteps. Evergreen trees were planted everywhere in this city, and so there was no such thing as the withering of autumn and winter. In the darkness, underneath the shadows of the lush trees, Yue Zhishi shifted closer to Song Yu and reached out to hold his hand, but Song Yu moved his hand away.Song Yu placed his hands behind his back, his eyes turned towards him. Yue Zhishi thought this was a kind of provocation, so he went this way and went that way, circling around Song Yu without success all the way until they entered the elevator.\u201cI haven\u2019t held your hand all night.\u201dThat sentence truly sounded pitiful. After opening the door to their apartment once they left the elevator, Song Yu held out his hand \u2014 only to have Yue Zhishi smack it, the noise very loud.Seeing Song Yu\u2019s eyes slightly widen from astonishment, Yue Zhishi gave him a sly smile.\u201cYue Zhishi, you\u2019re going to regret that.\u201dBefore he could react, everything around him spun; Song Yu directly plucked him up, his lower belly pressing against Song Yu\u2019s shoulder. Yue Zhishi flopped around like a sad little fish, but none of his movements were of any use at all.His head started to feel a bit woozy from the blood rushing downwards, and his face started to redden. He kept calling out Song Yu\u2019s name, begging him to put him down, and all he saw were the wooden steps as Song Yu climbed up them one by one, as well as the motion sensor lights, now lit up, on the edge of each step. He and Song Yu had knelt on the steps and installed each of them together.The door to their room was pushed open, and the light was also turned on, the carpet on the floor pure white. He was thrown onto the soft bed, and Song Yu pressed down on him like a shower of heavy rain predicted long ago. Closing his eyes, Yue Zhishi thought of the final words Song Yu had said, as well as the kind of punishments that were very likely to happen.But things didn\u2019t happen according to his imagination.There was a light tug on the hair at the top of his head. Yue Zhishi squinted open his eyes uncertainly, and then realised Song Yu had gently taken away a golden\u00a0oriental plane\u00a0leaf from his hair. He held onto that leaf, spinning it around in front of the dimly yellow bedside lamp, before finally placing it down on the white nightstand.With this unexpected movement, it was as though the intense rhythm of before had been thrown into disarray by Song Yu\u2019s subconscious tenderness. Both of them were slightly stunned when their eyes met.Song Yu wasn\u2019t romantic at all, always realistic and orderly in everything he did. In everyone\u2019s eyes, he was someone not affected with strong emotions, but only Yue Zhishi knew \u2014 all of Song Yu\u2019s frenzied and tender feelings of love had solidified into a ray aimed clearly in one direction, the tip of that arrow pointing towards Yue Zhishi himself.No one else could see this kind of Song Yu.Yue Zhishi raised his slender neck, lifting his head to briefly give Song Yu a kiss, and then he smiled, wrapping his hands around his neck. \u201cSong Yu, you really have a vindictive heart. I just smacked you once, it\u2019s not like it hurt.\u201dHe held out a hand. \u201cHere, you can hit me.\u201dSong Yu gave his hand a glance. And then, contrary to Yue Zhishi\u2019s expectations, he lowered his head and kissed the palm Yue Zhishi had willingly opened.But it was just for one moment \u2014 the look on his face quickly changed.\u201cI don\u2019t want to hit your hand anymore.\u201dHe pressed Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrist onto the bed, his other hand moving downwards and opening buttons.\u201cI want to hit somewhere else.\u201dStruggling, Yue Zhishi wriggled around a few times. He didn\u2019t use Song Yu\u2019s name anymore, calling him gege with a whine in his voice. \u201cBut I won an award today. You haven\u2019t even rewarded me yet, you only know how to punish me.\u201dThe cold air of the autumn night flowed through the unclosed window and very quickly attached itself to skin \u2014 but even faster, Song Yu\u2019s dry and broad palm surrounded him, the heat of it opening those fine pores.And his legs.\u201cThere\u2019s not much of a difference,\u201d Song Yu said, arching an eyebrow. \u201cYou can take it as a reward.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing how leisurely you guys lined up in the comments section to get in the car, I honestly didn\u2019t want to play with (?) you guys, so I wrote the first spanking I\u2019ve ever written in my life (ah, a few cuties reminded me, I remember now \u2014 Xiao Pei was also spanked, but it was just twice (?))\u2026 and then the more I wrote, the longer it got\u2026 Song Yu, you\u2019re too much.Even though this is an unplanned car, it\u2019s unexpectedly better than the ones I\u2019ve written before (I\u2019m just praising myself), I feel like there\u2019s a bit more to Xiao Yu\u2019s character now)[Spanking warning, blindfold warning]\u2014\u2014Before Yue Zhishi could understand the meaning behind Song Yu\u2019s words, he was already flipped over.A pair of pale, bare legs were exposed in the cold air.He didn\u2019t resist. Since they\u2019ve returned back to campus, other than the brief intimacy in the grove of trees last time, they\u2019ve rarely even hugged. Yue Zhishi had been stuck in between the two mountains of the competition and the mock trial, and during the most tiring few days, he\u2019d only slept for four hours each night. His chaotic and erratic dreams had all been of Song Yu.Sometimes in his sleep, he would return back to the times when Song Yu had dodged away from him, thinking Yue Zhishi understood nothing, but in those dreams, Song Yu saw through Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart earlier. He would embrace him before Yue Zhishi cried and let him rise up on his toes; they\u2019d kiss long enough to fill an entire dream, like the kind of happy ending a beautiful love story should have.Yue Zhishi truly yearned for Song Yu\u2019s intimacy, and he firmly believed he wanted it more than Song Yu did \u2014 and so he would never reject it. But the shame he felt still made him slightly struggle, only for things to be taken one step further.Song Yu took out the eye mask he used to wear when he slept alone and covered up Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to take it off, or else I won\u2019t hold you or kiss you.\u201dThat was an extremely effective deterrent, towards Yue Zhishi. He utterly craved Song Yu\u2019s embraces and kisses, as though they were necessities required for his survival. And so Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t dare move, only plaintively calling out gege and softly asking him, \u201cAre you really going to hit me? Where are you going to hit?\u201dHe was surrounded by darkness. He didn\u2019t receive Song Yu\u2019s answer before being pulled; he seemed to be dragged into Song Yu\u2019s arms, and he felt both grateful and secure \u2014 his lower belly pressed against Song Yu\u2019s thighs, and he could touch Song Yu\u2019s back.An image appeared in Yue Zhishi\u2019s mind: at this moment, Song Yu should be sitting on the edge of the bed, while he himself was most likely like a meek little dog lying on his owner\u2019s legs, lying in his arms and waiting for his owner to stroke down his downy back.But that wasn\u2019t what happened.What he received was a neither light nor heavy smack from Song Yu, the hit landing on his ass.Caught off-guard, Yue Zhishi cried out; he was somewhat stunned from the impact. When the second slap landed once again on his ass, he was both embarrassed and shocked, and he called out Song Yu\u2019s name, pleading at him to not hit his butt.\u201cYou said I could hit you back. Isn\u2019t it the same anywhere?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s voice always sounded cold, sounding as though it couldn\u2019t be defied.\u201cGege\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s head was buried into the soft blanket, and he could hear the loud sounds of Song Yu\u2019s palm landing on his soft flesh. He\u2019d never been treated like this before, even during childhood \u2014 Yue Zhishi, always so obedient, was \u2018disciplined\u2019 using this method for the first time in his life.His upper body was still completely dressed, his woollen sweater confining his elevated body temperature. Yue Zhishi was burning, was sweating, but his lower body wore only a thin piece of cotton underwear and nothing else. He wasn\u2019t willing to merely lie there, and so he bashfully wriggled on Song Yu\u2019s legs. The insecurity he felt from the darkness made his desire feel hollow and unsatisfied. Song Yu wasn\u2019t actually hitting him all that hard, but there wasn\u2019t a steady pace to them; he didn\u2019t know when the next smack would fall.So every time he received a slap, under the crisp sounds of a hand meeting flesh, Yue Zhishi would cry out with his legs trembling, anxious and fearful.\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to cry out.\u201dYue Zhishi heard Song Yu\u2019s stern command and could feel his palm rubbing against his supple cheeks. His voice sounded closer \u2014 Yue Zhishi thought Song Yu might\u2019ve bent over and leaned over to his ear. In the vast expanse of darkness, a damp, hot breath puffed against the side of his face.\u201cIf I hear anything, I\u2019m going to smack you harder.\u201dYue Zhishi let out a muffled noise very quietly. Sensing Song Yu very close by, he turned his head, wanting to kiss him, but Song Yu caught his chin.\u201cBaobao.\u201d Song Yu\u2019s voice was very low, and was both cold and alluring. \u201cYou\u2019re really not being a good boy.\u201dAnother smack landed on his ass once again, just as Yue Zhishi was completely unprepared.\u201cMm\u2026\u201d Song Yu let go of his chin, but Yue Zhishi\u2019s arms were pulled back to cross behind his back, Song Yu holding down his wrists.Without conscious thought, Yue Zhishi started to plea for mercy; he was soft and pale, like a water snake too slippery to hold. \u201cGege, don\u2019t hit me anymore, I\u2019m a good boy.\u201d\u201cAre you?\u201d Song Yu\u2019s hand brushed across Yue Zhishi\u2019s raised shoulder-blades and moved downwards, slowly gliding over his ribs. People always said flesh caused lust, but he felt even Yue Zhishi\u2019s bones were seductive.\u201cI make sure you eat well every day. But where\u2019s all your flesh gone?\u201dHe was doing the most carnal movements, yet his words were like a parent\u2019s questioning. Yue Zhishi\u2019s shame increased, unable to say anything resembling a complete sentence. \u201cI\u2026\u201dSong Yu\u2019s hand lightly patted Yue Zhishi\u2019s reddening asscheeks, and they jiggled and swayed like soft pudding.\u201cYour flesh ended up all here.\u201d His hand grabbed tightly onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s ass and fiercely squeezed it, kneading it until Yue Zhishi made a noise from the pleasure.\u201cDid you do that on purpose? Hm?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Yue Zhishi found the room too warm, and he felt wronged; Song Yu\u2019s words made no sense at all. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 Why would everything go there?\u201dHe felt Song Yu pull on his small and thin underwear and tug it to the left and to the right, using it to lightly rub against the thin seam between his two plump cheeks. Sensation was incredibly magnified in the dark, and he could almost feel the cotton material wrapped around his cock \u2014 it was slowly dampening, coldly and stickily attaching itself to his skin.Yet another slap came down. Yue Zhishi\u2019s entire body was trembling, everything shivering; the pleasure forced out from the cracks in his bones pushed away those tiny shreds of pain.\u201cSo it\u2019d be great to fuck,\u201d Song Yu said, using a deep voice to say obscene words.This body was outrageous and erotic \u2014 it had only been spanked, and yet fluid was already seeping out of his cock. With his hands held behind his back, Yue Zhishi squirmed impatiently on Song Yu\u2019s legs; he looked like he was struggling, but the nipples on his chest had hardened long ago from rubbing against Song Yu\u2019s legs, separated by the sweater.\u201cYue Zhishi, you\u2019re wet.\u201d Song Yu mercilessly lay bare his arousal. \u201cAnd hard.\u201dYue Zhishi felt like Song Yu was having sex with him just by speaking; he could reach his peak just by listening to Song Yu\u2019s voice. His body had softened, had weakened from the spanking until\u00a0he was an utter mess, and unable to hold back, he begged Song Yu and said he really liked him \u2014 all different kinds of sweet honeyed words were gasped from that pink mouth. Even that faintly visible tip of his tongue was seducing him.\u201cYou like being spanked that much?\u201d\u201cMm\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi curved his head over to reach Song Yu\u2019s body, biting Song Yu\u2019s shirt like a puppy begging for love.\u201cTake it off yourself,\u201d Song Yu commanded, releasing Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrists.Yue Zhishi hazily grabbed at the bottom of his sweater, only for Song Yu to smack him again; his whole body quivered.\u201cUnderwear,\u201d Song Yu said.Yue Zhishi climbed off of Song Yu\u2019s body a bit clumsily, very obediently leaving the eye mask alone. He knelt on the bed while remaining in the dark, and his hands dragged his underwear down his legs. His exposed cock and asscheeks were pink, both the colour and the fluid coming from within his body, and the imprints of Song Yu\u2019s hand were vaguely visible. He wanted to shift a bit closer to Song Yu, but he couldn\u2019t tell he was on the edge of the bed and almost lost his balance. Before he toppled over, Song Yu quickly hauled him in, pulling him onto his body.\u201cWhat a good\u00a0baobao.\u201d Song Yu rewarded him with a kiss, a very clean one pecked onto his cheek, but Yue Zhishi found that far from enough. Since he couldn\u2019t see anything, he couldn\u2019t fit their lips together even though he wanted to, and so he groped around, hand fumbling everywhere until he found Song Yu\u2019s stiffened lower body.Yue Zhishi thought \u2014 perhaps if Song Yu wanted it as much as he did, then maybe he wouldn\u2019t keep torturing him.And so Yue Zhishi bent down, body perpendicular to Song Yu. Under no one\u2019s instructions, he arched his back and raised up his ass, his posture quite similar to earlier when he\u2019d been spanked \u2014 but this time, he wasn\u2019t lying on Song Yu\u2019s legs and waiting for either a punishment or a reward; this time, his head was buried in between Song Yu\u2019s legs. Fumbling, he pulled down Song Yu\u2019s zipper, pulled out his cock and swallowed it into his mouth.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Song Yu grabbed hold of his slightly long hair, not allowing Yue Zhishi to move.Yue Zhishi used that extremely pure face to say the most seductive words. \u201cGege, I want to suck you off.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t too skilled, but he worked hard, lowering his head until Song Yu\u2019s cock was very deep inside. He used the soft flesh inside his mouth and the tip of his tongue to surround him, to tangle with him, and he used his fragile and delicate throat to squeeze and give pleasure. With his innocent yet devoted attitude, he couldn\u2019t tell exactly who was fucking whom. Song Yu quietly panted twice, and then his hand lewdly fondled Yue Zhishi\u2019s upraised ass \u2014 Yue Zhishi felt even more encouraged, and he sucked in Song Yu\u2019s cock until it couldn\u2019t go in anymore. Whimpers and moans fell from his mouth, and he mumbled words like gege\u2019s so big, gege\u2019s getting even bigger now.Yue Zhishi was beautiful and clean, and he treated everyone as though he was an angel. But no one knew how unsatisfied he was no matter how many kisses he was given; no one knew how touch starved he was, insisting on being held while he was getting fucked; no one had seen the look on his reddened face as he asked Song Yu why he didn\u2019t push in.All of those different parts of Yue Zhishi, hidden away \u2014 only Song Yu had the key to them.Suddenly, Yue Zhishi felt something cold and sticky dribble onto his flushed cheeks. Soon after, he felt it trickle onto his entrance. He made a noise, but Song Yu whacked his ass, a finger pushing inside. \u201cSwallow me a bit deeper.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s pessimism would always make him think of the past and the future whenever they were doing the most intimate things. He would remember many, many times when he\u2019d wanted to kiss Yue Zhishi yet hadn\u2019t been able to; he\u2019d wonder just how adorable, how bewitching the innocent Yue Zhishi would become after falling in love with some girl some day.Perhaps he\u2019d also get hurt and would come back, looking for him and crying. But in that moment, he would most likely be begging for a clean, consoling hug, and not a filthy and primitive sexual embrace.Fortunately, those thoughts were stored away in figments of his imagination during all those sleepless nights. Pandora\u2019s box hadn\u2019t been opened, but rather, had been taken away by Yue Zhishi.It was only to Song Yu who Yue Zhishi would say the word \u2018love\u2019. It was only because of him that Yue Zhishi would feel pain, feel suffering \u2014 it was only for him that Yue Zhishi would think of death, again and again.\u201cMm\u2026.\u201dThe lube and Song Yu\u2019s finger were opening up his body, but Yue Zhishi could feel his passage growing slicker; his entire person was wet and sticky, fighting to suck in Song Yu\u2019s finger. In one end, he was getting fucked by Song Yu\u2019s finger, and in the other end, Song Yu was holding down the back of his head and fucking his throat with his cock. Both his top and bottom were releasing embarrassing slurping and pumping noises.\u201cGe\u2026\u201d He pulled his mouth away the tiniest bit. \u201cIt\u2019s too big, I can\u2019t fit it in\u2026\u201dTwo of Song Yu\u2019s fingers were thrusting against his prostate, and his narrow waist was shaking from the pleasure. His cock was dangling on top of Song Yu\u2019s legs, the tip of it grinding against and staining his pants. Yue Zhishi\u2019s imploring moans were all pushed into his throat by Song Yu, unable to come out, and he sounded particularly pitiful. Song Yu was swallowed deeply and tightly by Yue Zhishi\u2019s slender throat, and his eyebrows drew together, his fingers roughly thrusting and pressing against that sensitive spot \u2014 he used his hand to fuck Yue Zhishi into coming.As he climaxed, Yue Zhishi wanted to call out. His throat tightened even further, and it made Song Yu come as well; Yue Zhishi choked on the thick cum, face reddening, and so he pulled away. A long, long string of translucent fluid was connected to his stretched out tongue, and Yue Zhishi subconsciously swallowed it first before he tumbled onto Song Yu\u2019s legs, coughing. Even after coming, Song Yu\u2019s cock was still very large, and it rested on the side of Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. The sticky fluid from the front was still on Yue Zhishi\u2019s mouth, and he looked disorientated, very much not clean and very unkempt.Song Yu stroked down his back tenderly, apologising while Yue Zhishi coughed; it was as though the soul within that handsome skin had been changed from a demon to an angel. He picked up Yue Zhishi, embraced him and gave him a gentle kiss. Their tongues exchanged fluids and saliva, and the gentle kiss turned violent, their tongues writhing with each other until they started to hurt \u2014 they kissed until Yue Zhishi pleaded for him to once again come in.\u201cGege, I want it, hurry\u2026\u201d With his blindfold, Yue Zhishi went ahead and begged Song Yu, his lips red, swollen and glistening. They looked like they\u2019d been completely ravaged.Song Yu wouldn\u2019t let Yue Zhishi hold him; he had Yue Zhishi on his hands and knees, and he gradually pushed his way in from the back, bit by bit. It was as though Yue Zhishi had been born knowing how to do these things \u2014 if Song Yu hadn\u2019t grown up together with him, he might\u2019ve thought Yue Zhishi was a battle-seasoned veteran, knowing to arch his back and lift up his ass as soon as he slid inside. Yue Zhishi displayed his beautiful spine and the dimples at the top of his butt for Song Yu to see, and he called out so enticingly. \u201cGege, it\u2019s so big\u2026 it\u2019s too big, I can\u2019t take it\u2026\u201dThe snaps of his hips became more and more ruthless, and he raised a hand to smack Yue Zhishi\u2019s red and swollen cheeks. \u201cAnd yet you\u2019re squeezing me so tightly.\u201d\u201cI like you, Song Yu\u2026 Song Yu, I really like you.\u201dAs long as Yue Zhishi expressed his love, Song Yu knew: Yue Zhishi was Yue Zhishi, the one who\u2019d loved only him, who\u2019d looked only at him since they were children. In his dreams, he had sorrowfully kissed Yue Zhishi over one hundred times, holding him in his arms and joining with him like this \u2014 he\u2019d possessed Yue Zhishi like so, and had used those dreams to console himself.But this moment was real.\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 Too fast\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s face was hidden in the blanket, his whimpers coming across like cries; the slaps of flesh meeting flesh came again and again, and he couldn\u2019t tell anymore if Song Yu was hitting him, or fucking him.\u201cThen I\u2019ll slow down.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s thrusts came slower, the curved front of his cock grinding again and again at Yue Zhishi\u2019s spot. He watched as Yue Zhishi shuddered, as he moved his hips backwards to follow the retreat of his cock \u2014 of his own volition, Yue Zhishi used his back opening to search for that shaft, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t stand it, hurry\u2026\u201dSong Yu once again couldn\u2019t help but clamp down on his hips. \u201cYue Zhishi, you\u2019re so hard to please.\u201dYue Zhishi fell into a sticky and clinging whirlpool, only able to feel Song Yu\u2019s fierce thrusts and his own body\u2019s rising pleasure in the boundless darkness. His passage and lower belly were both sore and numb, and his sweater was already fully drenched from sweat. He couldn\u2019t stop shaking, and his pleas for Song Yu to go faster turned to pleas for Song Yu to have mercy on him until his words no longer came clearly; he gasped for air with his mind fogged and blurry, and he himself didn\u2019t know what he was saying.\u201cGoing\u2026 Mm\u2026 Gege, Xiao Yu gege\u2026 I, I\u2026 going to die\u2026.\u201dSong Yu pressed down on his body, pounding into him faster and faster as he fucked into that spot. \u201cYue Zhishi, did you think you were going to die like this when you wrote your will? Hm?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s mouth opened and closed, only able to breathe \u2014 there was almost no difference between that mouth and his lower one. An instinctive fear grew in his body from being fucked so hard, and as though seeking survival, he propped up his arms and started to crawl forward in the dark, wanting to drag himself away. But Song Yu cruelly caught hold of his ankles, his waist and hauled him back, firmly and securely nailing himself into Yue Zhishi\u2019s body. He shoved himself in recklessly and without restraint, as though he wanted to plunge into the deepest part of him and become one with Yue Zhishi.\u201cWhy are you running? Are you afraid of me?\u201d Song Yu was licking and kissing his nape, and then he gripped Yue Zhishi\u2019s chin as if to please him, turning his face around to tenderly kiss him. \u201cWhy are you afraid? I love you so much.\u201dThe more tender his kiss, the fiercer he fucked.In this joining with such extreme contrasting feelings, the tidal waves of pleasure surged and flooded over, drowning Yue Zhishi within them; he was surrounded and wrapped up in streaming rivers of sweat, and Song Yu had fucked him into not having enough air and hyperventilating. He\u2019d turned into a pair of bellows damaged from water, being pushed and pulled at someone else\u2019s discretion.Song Yu, having not received a reply, kissed his ear. He drove into him as he asked, \u201cYue Zhishi, do you love gege?\u201dHe\u2019d originally thought Yue Zhishi had already lost his ability to speak, but after being asked that question, he was like the final shining rays of the setting sun, nodding his head in the midst of his pants for air. He rasped, \u201cLove, love gege\u2026\u201dSong Yu kissed his eyes through the mask, and he realised the eye mask was already soaked through; he pulled it off. The sudden light caused Yue Zhishi to frown, and he squinted those eyes completely red from crying. His eyes were unfocused from the pleasure, and yet he was still saying he loved Song Yu.He loved Song Yu \u2014 Yue Zhishi could truly keep saying that until he died.\u201cBaobao, you\u2019re being so good.\u201d Song Yu gently yet ferociously hugged Yue Zhishi from the back as he fucked him, and Yue Zhishi came with painful thin spurts, his pink knuckles and long fingers clenching the blanket. Wildly moaning, he obviously had already came, yet his breathing was still rushed and hurried \u2014 he was saying, mind blank and unaware, \u201cPlease\u2026 No more, ge\u2026.\u201dHaving already came once in his mouth, Song Yu wouldn\u2019t come so easily a second time. He ran his hands over Yue Zhishi\u2019s soft and flat belly and rocked in, hard and fast, thrusting until Yue Zhishi grew needy again. Yue Zhishi\u2019s entire body exuded an obscene scent, and he convulsed against Song Yu\u2019s chest, crying and calling out that he couldn\u2019t anymore, he was coming again \u2014 and yet he didn\u2019t shoot anything out. Finally, Song Yu couldn\u2019t bear it anymore; he panted and gasped on top of Yue Zhishi\u2019s body like a wild beast dressed in human clothes.Yue Zhishi, with his blurred consciousness, sensed that Song Yu was about to come, and so he touched Song Yu\u2019s arms, sobbing anxiously, and begged him with his hoarse voice, \u201cCome inside, gege, I want you inside\u2026\u201dSong Yu had no resistance to his pleas. He roughly fucked into him a good few more times, his engorged cock strangled in that hot and damp passage, until all of that thick and sticky fluid shot into Yue Zhishi\u2019s body.Yue Zhishi\u2019s entire body collapsed, and other than his mouth opened to urgently wheeze for air, there was no inch of his bare skin that wasn\u2019t saturated with the pink of carnal desire. He sensed Song Yu wrapping his arms around his slick self, petting and stroking him, sharing with him the most tender kiss; Song Yu called out his name, as though he was confirming he was truly there and wasn\u2019t just a dream.\u201cYue Zhishi.\u201dYue Zhishi couldn\u2019t open his eyes. \u201c\u2026ge.\u201d He didn\u2019t even have the strength to say repetitive words, feeling fragile enough to shatter at the slightest touch.\u201cI love you.\u201d Song Yu clutched him tightly. \u201cDo you know that?\u201dCurled into his arms, Yue Zhishi nodded.\u201cGood boy.\u201d Song Yu didn\u2019t need a response from him, touching his eyelids and forehead with very careful, cherishing lips.But even though Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t speak, he used his hand that was left on Song Yu\u2019s back and sluggishly yet very stubbornly traced an unsteady love heart. He then kissed Song Yu\u2019s chin, doing his best to give him a reply.Exhausted and deeply deprived of sleep, Yue Zhishi thoroughly fell asleep like the dead.Song Yu carried him to clean up, to bathe; he carried him back out after he changed the bedsheets and linen, spreading some soothing cream over him, and gently pulled Yue Zhishi\u2019s pyjamas over him like he was a small baby before kissing his red cheeks.Song Yu very much found pleasure in this process \u2014 it felt like a kind of decompression, as though he was playing a mission-based game and would feel extremely fulfilled after completing all his tasks.When asleep, Yue Zhishi would have the slightest bit more temper compared to normal, but this temper was a bit better than when he was sick. For most of the time, he was the same as when he was awake, allowing Song Yu to fiddle with him all he wanted, but if he was moved about too much, he would frown, would unconsciously pout his lips and unhappily grumble a few times.This kind of Yue Zhishi was cute and fun to tease, and Song Yu was still reluctant to sleep even by the middle of the night. He played around with Yue Zhishi without making a single noise until he sensed Yue Zhishi had become truly annoyed and was about to wake up \u2014 he only then wrapped Yue Zhishi in his arms, saying\u00a0okay okay okay, and stroked up and down his back, soothing him back to sleep.Yue Zhishi slept for too long, this time around. He woke up sometime in the middle; his eyes were super swollen, and it took a lot of effort for him to open his eyes. It looked like Song Yu was holding him as he watched a movie on mute using the projector.He wanted to get Song Yu to give him a kiss, but he was too tired \u2014 he closed his eyes.But without being prompted or being asked, Song Yu still kissed his face, and so Yue Zhishi fell back asleep, perfectly content.When he truly woke up, it was because he was hungry and thirsty. Unable to open his eyes, he groped around, and this time, he didn\u2019t end up touching an empty blanket; Song Yu directly reached out and clasped his hand.\u201cSlept enough?\u201dSong Yu was sitting up in bed and writing an essay. Yue Zhishi shifted over to his lap, wanting to find a comfortable position.\u201cYou\u2019re still wriggling. Do you want to get out of bed or not?\u201dYue Zhishi suddenly remembered something, and he weakly pulled away his head, fully embarrassed, and placed it back onto his pillow. He even stretched out a hand and adjusted the laptop he\u2019d knocked askew.Song Yu lightly chuckled, his palm drifting over to cover Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re finally frightened. Looks like you\u2019re truly awake now.\u201dHe pulled Yue Zhishi up and told him it was already three in the afternoon. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want to listen, closing his eyes and opening his mouth to say he didn\u2019t want to get up, but as soon as he tried to speak, he scared himself into coughing.\u201cHave some water.\u201d Song Yu placed a cup next to his mouth.Yue Zhishi gulped down the water and then stared blankly into space while holding the empty cup.His stomach growled, startling Yue Zhishi from his daze; he leaned his head onto Song Yu\u2019s collarbones and took his hand, pulling it over to touch his stomach that was empty and deflated from hunger. Instead of using words, he used his actions to say what he wanted.Following his expectations, Song Yu gently caressed his stomach \u2014 and then, what came out of his mouth was, \u201cMn, I felt it.\u201dYue Zhishi frowned in doubt and then raised his eyebrows, lifting his head to look at Song Yu. His eyes asked,\u00a0what did you feel?\u201cOur baby.\u201d Song Yu used a completely serious face to say utter nonsense. \u201cKicking your stomach.\u201dYue Zhishi widened his eyes, revealing an expression of disbelief. He was stunned for three seconds before he reached out both hands and caught Song Yu\u2019s shoulders, trying to shake him awake.Song Yu was as indifferent and emotionless as a robot. \u201cI\u2019ve read that you need to rest quietly during\u00a0the early stages of pregnancy. Yue Zhishi, calm down.\u201dThinking he was too funny and too frustrating, Yue Zhishi breathed out, \u201cYou calm down.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m about to become a dad. I can\u2019t calm down,\u201d Song Yu said, face completely dead.Yue Zhishi fell backwards onto the bed \u2014 there was no saving him.But even though Song Yu really seemed like his head had been drowned in water, he still brought up for Yue Zhishi a tray of delicious food and placed it on the bed. There was a golden chicken soup with gingko nuts and\u00a0egg dumplings,\u00a0steamed pork ribs crusted with rice flour\u00a0that were so fragrant and soft they almost melted in his mouth,\u00a0stir-fried green beans with mince\u00a0and some fluffy,\u00a0scrambled eggs with whitebait fish.Yue Zhishi felt like he really had done well for himself \u2014 he was actually allowed to eat on Song Yu\u2019s bed now.Worried Yue Zhishi wouldn\u2019t be able to swallow it down, Song Yu soaked the rice in the chicken soup until the grains were soft before he handed it over to him.Swallowing truly required a lot of effort. His throat felt like it\u2019d been scraped raw from sandpaper, and Yue Zhishi thought, maybe next time he shouldn\u2019t try doing something so scary.Unless Song Yu begged him.His waist was sore and weak, and he slouched over after eating for a while. Song Yu had only eaten half of his food when his phone rang, the screen showing Professor Zhang.\u201cI\u2019m going to take a call.\u201d He left the room with the phone and also closed the door. Having always been very sensitive to Song Yu\u2019s emotions, Yue Zhishi felt like Song Yu\u2019s mood seemed to abruptly turn for the worse after seeing who called, so he couldn\u2019t quite keep eating anymore. He very slowly took a few sips of the soup and waited until Song Yu returned back to him. Song Yu sat on the edge of the bed, across from him, and Yue Zhishi reached out a leg to poke at him.\u201cDon\u2019t move, the tray\u2019s going to flip,\u201d Song Yu said warmly, catching hold of his toes.Yue Zhishi obediently stopped moving around. Once Song Yu opened his hand, Yue Zhishi stretched out his leg and stuffed his toes into the gap between Song Yu\u2019s knees and the blanket; it felt very secure.\u201cDo you still want cake?\u201d Song Yu had finished eating, and he lifted his eyes to look at him. \u201cI baked a cheesecake when you were sleeping.\u201dYue Zhishi frantically nodded. He finished his bowl of soup and prepared to welcome in his cake.His butt hurting, Yue Zhishi pretty much laid uncomfortably on his stomach the entire day. He watched an episode of an anime, and then he sent Song Yu a message, saying he wanted to go back to his dorm to grab his homework so he could go directly to class on Monday from the apartment. Song Yu was next to him, organising some data, and his glasses made him look particularly refined. He turned his face over to Yue Zhishi and said, face serious and proper \u2014\u201cDon\u2019t go to class anymore. Just take a break from school and take care of your stomach.\u201dFor the first time in his life, Yue Zhishi grabbed a pillow and smashed Song Yu with it \u2014 he even felt very good while doing it.They bumped into Jiang Yufan in front of the dormitory building. He was preparing to head out for dinner, and he recognised Song Yu first before he noticed Yue Zhishi, who was waving at him.\u201cOh, Le Le.\u201d Jiang Yufan\u2019s hands were in his pockets. \u201cI even thought you were someone else when I saw you from far away. Why are you walking so strangely?\u201dWith a reddened face, Yue Zhishi pressed his lips together and didn\u2019t speak.\u201cYou\u2019re not sick, are you?\u201d Jiang Yufan looked at him and then looked at Song Yu. \u201cSenior, why isn\u2019t he talking?\u201d\u201cHe exercised too hard, so now his waist\u2019s sore and legs are aching. And his throat\u2019s inflamed\u2026\u201dDesperately wanting to stop Song Yu from talking, Yue Zhishi kicked at him in a panic, and then for the rest of way, he kept sending [Sorry] messages to Song Yu.Once Jiang Yufan left, Song Yu squeezed his face with one hand, Yue Zhishi\u2019s mouth puckering up.\u201cAre you deliberately looking to be punished? Did you enjoy it that much?\u201dYue Zhishi blinked at him and then lowered his head, sending him another message.[Le Le: No to the first bit, but yes to the second.]Song Yu truly couldn\u2019t handle him.Yue Zhishi essentially lived at Song Yu\u2019s apartment for the entire next week. His excuse of being sick was very useful, and Jiang Yufan even kept sending him messages, asking after his throat. Every time Yue Zhishi replied, he felt very embarrassed.Song Yu\u2019s birthday fell on a Friday, and Lin Rong called them back to Yanghe Qizhe for dinner. For once, Song Jin came back home before they did, and he hung around the restaurant\u2019s kitchen. Feeling as though there was nothing he could do in there, he went out and chatted with the few guests before finally heading to their family\u2019s private room. He had nothing to do, so he counted out twenty-two long and skinny candles for Song Yu, placing them on the table.Yue Zhishi came in with a caramel-coloured, flowering rose, and a few familiar guests greeted him.\u201cLe Le, you\u2019re back? Where\u2019s your brother?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s behind me.\u201d Yue Zhishi called out for Aunt Rong, and then slid into the kitchen, popping a cherry tomato into his mouth.\u201cDarling, wash your hands.\u201d Lin Rong poured some liquid soap onto his hands and pulled him over to the sink. \u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s coming.\u201d The tomato was too juicy, Yue Zhishi almost choking as he spoke. He coughed a few times.\u201cAiyah, eat slowly, we have plenty.\u201dYue Zhishi ran off once he\u2019d washed his hands. He knocked into Song Yu\u2019s chest as soon as he went out, and he retreated backwards two steps before Song Yu hauled him back and wrapped his arms around his waist. Hearing some noise, Lin Rong came out of the kitchen, and when she saw the two of them hugging, she laughed and said, \u201cHow old are you guys to still be hugging each other?\u201dYue Zhishi broke out of Song Yu\u2019s arms swiftly, feeling very guilty. \u201cI almost fell.\u201d\u201cBe careful.\u201d Lin Rong greeted Song Yu, saying, \u201cXiao Yu, come and wash your hands. Try my new soup recipe while you\u2019re here, it\u2019s definitely delicious.\u201dYue Zhishi sneaked away to the family room, and with Song Jin\u2019s help, displayed his newly bought fresh flower.\u201cIf I\u2019d known you were going to buy flowers, I would\u2019ve bought a rose too.\u201d Song Jin was somewhat vexed. \u201cYou should\u2019ve told me, Xiao Lin\u2019s going to yell at me later.\u201dHaving expected this, Yue Zhishi pulled out a red rose from his large schoolbag. \u201cDong dong dong dong! Uncle, I brought this for you. Aunt Rong doesn\u2019t know about it.\u201dSong Jin was extremely happy, and he transferred Yue Zhishi 200 RMB at once \u2014 Yue Zhishi made a tearful, happy profit of 190.Lin Rong was floating with happiness after receiving two flowers, and she kept bragging as they ate; Song Yu once again couldn\u2019t help but ridicule her, lifting his cup and mildly saying, \u201cLet us wish Ms Lin Rong a wonderful twenty-second birthday.\u201d\u201cXiao Yu, how are you always like this!\u201dYue Zhishi laughed so hard he fell over onto Song Jin. Song Jin slipped an arm around his shoulders and patted him like a father.\u201cAh, that\u2019s right, Xiao Yu,\u201d Song Jin suddenly said, \u201cyour Professor Zhang looked for me today. He bought me a cup of coffee.\u201dYue Zhishi gazed towards Song Yu, very keenly sensing that he wasn\u2019t happy again. He sat up straight and silently gave Song Yu a piece of fish.\u201cDid he?\u201d Song Yu looked like he didn\u2019t really care, poking at the fish with his head lowered. He didn\u2019t pick it up.\u201cIt was very much a coincidence.\u201d Song Jin chuckled. \u201cOur company\u2019s recently collaborating with your school on a project, and your supervisor just happened to be in charge. I didn\u2019t know he was your professor in the beginning. He later took me out for dinner, and we only realised we were connected after chatting for a bit.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t speak, but Lin Rong was curious. \u201cWhat did you guys talk about?\u201d\u201cHe talked to me about Xiao Yu\u2019s recent development, and then we later started talking about some things in our lives.\u201d Song Jin looked at Song Yu. \u201cProfessor Zhang said you\u2019re preparing to change the direction of your research?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Song Yu nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve already decided what I want to do for my postgraduate studies a long time ago, so it can\u2019t be considered as changing \u2014 I simply told him ahead of time that I wasn\u2019t going to follow him for postgrad.\u201d\u201cBut Professor Zhang is currently working on matters related to the\u00a0BeiDou System. There\u2019s a good future in it. He told me his only student is currently working in national defence, and he really needs someone.\u201d Song Jin was a traditional and upright person, and he truly cared about his country\u2019s national defence matters, thinking it was an extremely good future. He really hoped Song Yu could contribute to their country with his professional knowledge.Song Yu once again didn\u2019t speak. Lin Rong came out to help smooth the atmosphere, saying, \u201cYou should let the children choose for themselves. You allowed him to make his choices from the beginning, so why are you concerned now, all of a sudden.\u201dYue Zhishi glanced at Song Yu and then glanced at Song Jin. He too wanted to change the conversation, so he said, \u201cUncle, what kind of life stuff did you guys talk about?\u201dSong Jin let out an \u2018oh\u2019, taking a sip of tea. \u201cActually, it wasn\u2019t anything serious. We were just chatting, and we started talking about our children. Professor Zhang mentioned to me that he has a daughter, and that she was arriving back from the United States in two days. He said he couldn\u2019t find the time to pick her up and wanted to ask Xiao Yu for help, since he didn\u2019t trust anyone else.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Your studies are fairly related, and plus the two of you are also similar in age \u2014 you two should have a lot of common topics to talk about. Since your professor\u2019s already asked, you may as well help him with this. You can also take Ms Zhang around Wuhan U and help her get familiar with her new environment.\u201dSong Yu was focused on eating his food rather obstinately, and he waited until his father finished speaking before he abruptly said, \u201cI\u2019m a student, not a professional chauffeur.\u201d\u201cXiao Yu.\u201d Lin Rong reached out and pressed a hand down on his arm. She gave him a look, and then turned her head to Song Jin, her entire heart worried about her son. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea. How awkward would it be \u2014 they don\u2019t know each other, and now he suddenly has to go pick up the girl from the airport? Plus Xiao Yu doesn\u2019t like talking. What would we do if the entire trip turns out uncomfortable? Why don\u2019t have our own driver go.\u201d\u201cHis professor\u2019s already asked for Song Yu. How would it look if we pushed the job to our driver? Song Yu still needs to follow the ways of the world.\u201d Song Jin put down his chopsticks. \u201cI thought this entire thing was improper too, but since his professor\u2019s already opened his mouth and asked, I couldn\u2019t really refuse him. He is our child\u2019s professor, after all. We wouldn\u2019t be giving him any face.\u201dAnd then, he looked towards Song Yu again. \u201cWhile we\u2019re on that topic, Song Yu, you should make more friends. You come and go by yourself everyday \u2014 you may still be a student right now, but one day, you\u2019ll have to leave school and enter society. The way you are now, dad\u2019s always worrying about whether you\u2019ll be disadvantaged in the future.\u201cGege has a lot of friends.\u201d Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t help but retort for Song Yu. \u201cEveryone in the basketball team really good friends with gege, as well as the people in the debate team. The people in his research lab all really like gege too, I\u2019ve gone and met them before. They\u2019re all really nice people. My law school classmates also really adore gege. Uncle, gege\u2019s really good.\u201dSong Jin sighed. \u201cAnd you, protecting your brother every day. You can\u2019t carry him like this your entire life.\u201dYue Zhishi silently thought, of course I can, carrying him my entire life is exactly what I want to do.\u201cNo, everything I said is true.\u201d There was an earnest look on Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. \u201cGege really does have a lot of friends. We always need to book a large private room every time we go out to eat.\u201d\u201cHow about this.\u201d Seeing how Song Yu was refusing to communicate, Lin Rong attempted a compromise. \u201cLe Le and Song Yu can go together. That way, we won\u2019t have to worry about dead silence with Le Le can be there to help ease the atmosphere. The entire matter\u2019s settled once she\u2019s picked up anyway.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d Song Yu was adamant, and he even looked like he was ready to leave the table. Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart felt uncomfortable \u2014 it was his birthday. He didn\u2019t want Song Yu to be unhappy.\u201cI\u2019ll pick her up,\u201d Yue Zhishi suggested. \u201cI\u2019ll say gege\u2019s sick. I should be able to take his place since I\u2019m a Wuhan U student too. I can take older sister around.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s face hadn\u2019t fluctuated much over the entire conversation, but now he immediately frowned and turned his head to stare at Yue Zhishi. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t understand what he was trying to say, simply thinking he could help Song Yu solve something troublesome. He thought what he\u2019d done was very much worth being praised, so he winked at Song Yu.Song Yu sighed, the sound nearly undetectable.\u201cI\u2019ll go together with Yue Zhishi.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s only going to be this one time. I won\u2019t interact further with this Ms Zhang afterwards.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t each much of his birthday cake. He sat in the courtyard filled with fallen leaves, drinking tea and staring into space. Later, Song Jin also went over with a cup of tea, and he sat next to Song Yu. There was a small maple tree in the yard, its red leaves very beautiful.\u201cXiao Yu, how have you been?\u201d\u201cQuite well. I\u2019m really happy every single day,\u201d Song Yu honestly replied, gazing at those maple leaves.Song Jin stilled and then gently said to him, \u201cIt was my fault earlier. It\u2019s your birthday today, I shouldn\u2019t have been such a killjoy.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Song Yu looked at his father. \u201cI know you were doing it for my sake.\u201dSong Jin smiled, the curve of his lips both mature and relaxed. \u201cHonestly, you\u2019ve known what you wanted to do since you were young. You liked making your own choices, but sometimes, you\u2019d deliberately leak some hints to me. You\u2019d let me know what you were doing, but you wouldn\u2019t say it clearly. At those times I would think: this child\u2019s so awkward, why can\u2019t he just openly discuss things with me?\u201d\u201cBut now that you\u2019re turning into more and more of an adult, I\u2019ve realised that you almost never look for me anymore.\u201d Song Jin\u2019s eyes lowered, and he turned to look at that maple tree. \u201cTo children themselves, being independent is definitely a good thing. But to a father, I still find myself a bit sad. I keep wondering if there\u2019s anything I can still do for you.\u201dSong Yu completely understood his father\u2019s heart \u2014 at hearing these words, he even felt a slight sense of loss. Ever since his one-sided love had started during puberty, Song Yu had learned how to hide himself away and not let anyone see him; it had slowly, gradually become a habit, until he almost had no way of revealing his true self to other people.\u201cDad, you\u2019ve already been an extremely good father. I also hope you consider me a good son.\u201dThere was a tinge of melancholy in Song Yu\u2019s voice, and Song Jin couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cOf course you are. For your mother and me, in this lifetime, you are our greatest pride and joy.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s head lowered. He felt like he should smile \u2014 but he couldn\u2019t.Having thought of something, Song Jin asked, \u201cDid you want to change the direction of your research because Professor Zhang wanted to introduce his daughter to you?\u201dProfessor Zhang truly had kept hinting about it to Song Yu, both covertly and openly; he\u2019d even given Song Yu a look at his daughter\u2019s photo, as though he was sure Song Yu would be interested after seeing her and then change his mind, docilely becoming his son-in-law.But Song Yu didn\u2019t say any of those things to his father. \u201cNo, I already knew what I wanted to research when I first decided to study\u00a0geological mapping. I only followed him for my graduation project. The professor in the area I want to research doesn\u2019t take undergraduate students.\u201dSong Jin leaned back into the rocking chair, staring at the sky. \u201cThat\u2019s fine then. It\u2019s simply because Professor Zhang thinks you\u2019re an outstanding student, or else why would he introduce his precious daughter to you? When it comes to something like this, I think we should still have our basic manners as men. If there\u2019s no fate between the two of you, you can still be friends. You might bump into each other in the future for work.\u201d\u201cBut dad\u2019s really super curious. Can you divulge to me what you want to research?\u201dFather and son chatted while Lin Rong and Yue Zhishi sat in front of the glass windows, drinking milk. There was a carton of milk in each person\u2019s hand, and slurping noises came from the straws.\u201cLe Le, do you think your brother likes someone?\u201dLin Rong\u2019s sudden question made Yue Zhishi choke on his drink, and he started violently coughing.\u201cAiyah, what\u2019s wrong with you, why are you always choking? You need to slow down when drinking things\u2026\u201d Lin Rong stroked his back, returning back to her topic. \u201cI hear so much gossip everyday in the restaurant. Guys with worse credentials than your brother have already changed girlfriends multiple times, and yet there hasn\u2019t been any news from your brother. His supervisor likes him enough to want him as his son-in-law, but this guy doesn\u2019t even want to go see her. There\u2019s definitely a problem.\u201dYue Zhishi tentatively asked, \u201cThen what if gege really does like someone. What would you do?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, what would I do?\u201d Lin Rong put down her empty milk carton onto the table. \u201cIt\u2019ll be great if he has someone he likes. I\u2019d only worry if the other person doesn\u2019t like him back.\u201dLin Rong somewhat sorrowfully imagined scenes from an idol drama. \u201cSomeone like your brother, if placed in a television drama, would be the second male lead who belongs to the audience. So many people would have their hearts hurting for him.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi once again tentatively probed, \u201cwhat if that person likes gege too?\u201d\u201cThey should get married.\u201d Lin Rong said, \u201cI already have a recipe for the wedding cake!\u201dAt first, Yue Zhishi laughed \u2014 and then his heart started to hurt, for no reason at all.\u201cAunt Rong, what if you\u2019re not satisfied with the person gege likes?\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019d be satisfied though?\u201d Lin Rong propped up her face with her two hands, gazing out towards her husband and son outside in the courtyard. A smile brimming with happiness was on her face. \u201cSomeone who can make your brother like them must be a very, very good person.\u201dYue Zhishi looked towards the yard, thinking autumn was also about to end.He didn\u2019t know if he was good enough, but he knew he was a choice that didn\u2019t fit expectations.The temperature was quite cold the day they needed to go to the airport. Yue Zhishi had originally worn a cashmere coat, but he was cold the moment he came downstairs. Song Yu ordered him to head back up and change into white, thick cotton-padded clothes.\u201cWe\u2019ll be late.\u201d Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want to change.\u201cWe won\u2019t go if we\u2019re late,\u201d Song Yu said, completely not caring.Having switched out his clothes, Yue Zhishi felt like he was sinking directly into a fluffy piece of cotton candy as soon as he sat down in the car. Song Yu turned on the radio, and he peacefully listened to the broadcast the entire drive. He lifted up Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand when there was a red light, pulled it to his mouth and gave it a kiss; he then wrapped his hand around Yue Zhishi\u2019s pale and slender fingertips, using the pads of his fingers to slowly massage them. He looked as though he was very much cherishing those fingers.Yue Zhishi stared at Song Yu\u2019s fingers. For some reason, he started to imagine \u2014 he imagined a wedding ring on his finger. It should look very beautiful.\u201cI still haven\u2019t bought your birthday present yet,\u201d Yue Zhishi suddenly said. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201dSong Yu knew very well how indecisive he was. \u201cThe shirt\u2019s already really nice. You should save your money.\u201dEven though he\u2019d just been considered poor, Yue Zhishi continued to insist, \u201cNo way, I\u2019ve already thought of what to buy.\u201dSong Yu turned the steering wheel, heading onto the airport expressway. He mildly said, \u201cThen you should settle the payments for the last few times.\u201dYue Zhishi looked at Song Yu in confusion. But Song Yu said, poker-faced, \u201c2000 each time. Did you forget?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSometimes, Yue Zhishi truly found Song Yu very weird. Extremely weird.He took in a deep breath, telling himself to endure and be patient. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten. Wait until I earn\u2026\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s wait until you earn money before we go again,\u201d Song Yu interrupted. He even let out a slight smile that was free of any emotion.Yue Zhishi drew his eyebrows together, a disbelieving look in his puppy dog eyes. \u201cSong Yu, do you not have enough money these days?\u201dSong Yu sighed without any expression on his face. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about it, it\u2019s not easy earning money for milk powder. I only agreed to be a chauffeur this time because of you. According to my usual fees and how much you\u2019ve used me this time, I\u2019ll give you a 90 percent discount. I\u2019ll record 200 in my books.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Yue Zhishi was initially speechless, but then he later realised there was a problem with Song Yu\u2019s logic. \u201cWait, who uses money from the baby\u2019s mother to raise their own kid? You\u2019re too good at exploiting people!\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Song Yu gave him a glance, his final words coming out incomparably calm. \u201cYou finally admit you\u2019re carrying my baby.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s face flushed red, Song Yu\u2019s teasing making him stop talking completely.He silently used some very weak words to sneakily reproach Song Yu: you might have a delusional disorder, you need to get your brain checked.The airport was filled with people, and Yue Zhishi\u2019s annoyance pretty much couldn\u2019t last for even one minute. He forgot all about how he\u2019d been teased as soon as he got off the car and obediently followed behind gege \u2014 he also docilely stood next to Song Yu as they waited in the pick-up area, holding up an A4 piece of paper just like in television dramas. Ms Zhang\u2019s name, Zhang Siyun, was printed on it.He\u2019d printed it last night, worried they wouldn\u2019t be able to find her.After standing there for a while, Yue Zhishi started to get sleepy again; he leaned against Song Yu. Maybe it was because he was dressed in soft and white clothing, and was so very docile, that Song Yu thought he was very similar to a young Cotton Candy \u2014 he reached out and touched Yue Zhishi\u2019s face, lightly pinching it.\u201cYour hand\u2019s so cold,\u201d Yue Zhishi may have said, but he squished Song Yu\u2019s hand in between his face and neck, a sweet smile on his face. \u201cI\u2019ll warm it up for you.\u201dJust as the two of them were in this strange position, Ms Zhang headed towards them, pushing her luggage.\u201cHello, may I ask if you\u2019re Song Yu?\u201dHearing a very pleasant-sounding female voice, Yue Zhishi immediately took half a step back and also released Song Yu\u2019s hand. He realised someone was studying the paper in his hand before looking at him again, and so he shook his head at once. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201dMs Zhang was even prettier than he\u2019d imagined. Her looks weren\u2019t quite the same as Nan Jia\u2019s: she was a classic Chinese-American beauty, different from her traditional scholarly name, and had a friendly, stunning face. She had lightly tan skin, her hair long, black and curly, and the lilac highlight on her cheekbones sparkled and glistened.\u201cI guessed you weren\u2019t, you\u2019re too cute. You\u2019re mixed, right?\u201d She spoke tactfully, and she occasionally mixed in a few English words without realising. She praised him very sincerely, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re the best looking Eurasian I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m really happy to meet you.\u201dYue Zhishi modestly shook his head, saying similar things after introducing himself.Zhang Siyun turned towards Song Yu. \u201cSo you must be Song Yu.\u201dShe stretched out a hand, saying to him in an easy and relaxed manner, \u201cHi. You can call me Monica.\u201dMeeting her gaze, Song Yu didn\u2019t reach a hand out in return. \u201cHello, Ms Zhang. Is this all your luggage?\u201dZhang Siyun pulled back her hand without batting an eyelid and smiled. \u201cYes, I\u2019m a minimalist.\u201dSong Yu nodded. \u201cThen we can head off.\u201dZhang Siyun was quite talkative, expressing her gratitude to them once again before lightly grumbling about her overly doting father. She didn\u2019t let Song Yu take her luggage, pushing it the entire way herself, and she was even prepared to lift it into the trunk herself once Song Yu released the lock. But Song Yu still ended up moving it for her \u2014 even though he never interacted with girls he didn\u2019t know while at school, he didn\u2019t want to look so obviously ungentlemanly.Besides, he thought \u2014 if he\u2019d just stood there and hadn\u2019t done anything, it was very likely Yue Zhishi would\u2019ve reached out and moved it himself.Yue Zhishi pulled open the passenger seat door without thinking when they arrived at the car, but he abruptly paused and looked at Zhang Siyun. He hesitated for a while before he said, \u201cWould you like to sit in the front or in the back?\u201dBrushing her hair away, Zhang Siyun smiled. \u201cWould it look too much like I\u2019m taking you guys as my chauffeurs if I sat in the back? I wouldn\u2019t want it to look like that.\u201dYue Zhishi felt like he understood what she was trying to say. Faltering, he prepared to retreat to the back \u2014 but only he had sat in Song Yu\u2019s passenger seat before. He started to feel somewhat uncomfortable for no reason at all, and thought he was perhaps being overly petty.\u201cYue Zhishi.\u201d Song Yu looked at him as he stood outside the doors. \u201cSit upfront.\u201d He then said to Zhang Siyun, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m originally here as a chauffeur anyway.\u201d\u201cThen, thanks.\u201d Ms Zhang gracefully went to sit in the backseat.Somewhat distracted, Yue Zhishi forgot to put on his seatbelt. Song Yu leaned across, his hand reaching over very naturally to pull over and fasten his seatbelt for him.There was a bit of traffic on the way back, and Zhang Siyun actively started to talk, even frankly bringing up her fairly old-fashioned and bothersome father.\u201cAs you\u2019d know, an established academic like him has a lot of say when it comes to professional matters. He also likes being able to control everything in his private life \u2014 so no matter how much much he loves me, he still wants to hurry and find a good family for me to marry into and start having kids.\u201d She twitched her lips without conscious thought and shrugged. \u201cPerhaps this is a typical example of patriarchy.\u201dYue Zhishi unexpectedly found her a bit pitiful, and as he imagined some scenarios with her father rushing her to get married, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cHas Professor Zhang forced you to go on matchmaking dates?\u201d\u201cNo. After all, I was still out of the country.\u201d Zhang Siyun chuckled. \u201cBut he\u2019d sometimes bring up guys he thought were pretty good, either consciously or not, and the guy who came up the most often was Song Yu.\u201dDespite being named, Song Yu acted as though he hadn\u2019t heard, focused entirely on driving. He didn\u2019t say a single word. It was as though with Yue Zhishi there to converse, he didn\u2019t have to care about a single thing and could be the free-floating, stubborn and unfeeling ice mountain as he used to be.\u201cReally\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi quietly said. \u201cHe really does think highly of Song Yu \u2014 Song Yu is still doing his graduation project, and yet he\u2019s already been pulled into the research lab.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. But my dad\u2019s description of Song Yu was very\u2026\u201d Zhang Siyun paused, \u201c\u2026deficient. He only compliments Song Yu\u2019s academics and never stops going on about them. To the point where my brain only thought of this future academic star as an extreme nerd.\u201dShe started to smile again as she spoke, looking at Song Yu\u2019s strong reflection in the rearview mirror. \u201cToday\u2019s meeting really has been a pleasant surprise. After all, no one dislikes a handsome face. If my dad had given me a photo of you, we might\u2019ve met earlier.\u201dShe displayed her interest towards Song Yu very straightforwardly, and it made Yue Zhishi feel like he was in a particularly awkward position \u2014 he felt like an unnecessary waiter bringing up dishes during a matchmaking session or dinner date, gingerly clutching the small tip given to him so he could go away.Yue Zhishi felt like he\u2019d overestimated his own abilities to think he could ease the atmosphere. This was just the beginning, and yet he already didn\u2019t want to talk anymore.As Song Yu listened to Ms Zhang\u2019s words, he thought of all the various kinds of hints and coercion Professor Zhang had given him and started to feel a bit irritated \u2014 he also didn\u2019t know how he should respond to her \u2018handsome\u2019 and \u2018might\u2019ve met earlier\u2019. Noticing Yue Zhishi\u2019s silence, he asked him, \u201cAre you cold? Do you want to turn on the aircon?\u201dYue Zhishi lifted his head in bewilderment; he shook his head at first, but then he felt like he might have answered too hastily. Turning his face around, he asked Zhang Siyun, \u201cWhat about you?\u201dZhang Siyun shook her head as she smiled. \u201cMy clothes are quite thick, thank you. But the weather here is a bit drier than I expected. My impression of Jiang City was of a low-pressure area with never-ending rain. I didn\u2019t really like it.\u201dIn his heart, Yue Zhishi silently disagreed. He really liked rain, because he\u2019d known from a young age \u2014 whenever it rained, he could get closer to Song Yu. It would be even better if it thundered.\u201cBut Wuhan U should be really beautiful right now with the gingko and maple trees. I remember I used to visit there a lot when I was still in junior high, but after staying overseas for so long, I don\u2019t know what kind of new buildings there are now.\u201d Zhang Siyun extended an invitation especially naturally, but her eyes were looking at Song Yu\u2019s face in the rearview mirror. \u201cWould you guys happen to have the time to take me around? I can also pull out my dusty DSLR to take some scenery photos and not waste the effort.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t speak, so Yue Zhishi said, \u201cIf you need someone to go with you, I can\u2026\u201d\u201cWuhan U\u2019s scenery is actually better suited to be appreciated alone.\u201dSong Yu interrupted Yue Zhishi\u2019s sentence, coolly yet politely advising her, \u201cIf you follow the roads up Luojia Mountain, you can see whatever you want to see. A lot of photography enthusiasts go there as well, so you might be able to meet people with the same hobby as you.\u201dYue Zhishi looked at Zhang Siyun and glanced at Song Yu. He then said to her, a smile on his face, \u201cMn, I really like walking by myself on roads covered with fallen leaves. I\u2019m in a great mood after just a short walk.\u201dEven though she\u2019d been rejected, Zhang Siyun gave them a slight smile very magnanimously. \u201cI really like fallen leaves too. Climbing up a mountain by myself isn\u2019t a bad idea.\u201dThe drive was too unsteady from all the traffic, and so Yue Zhishi started to feel carsick. He cracked open a window for some air, but the wind was too strong, rapidly irritating his throat; he started to cough again.Zhang Siyun leaned over politely to ask if he was okay, but Song Yu had reacted faster: he handed to Yue Zhishi a thermos with its lid already open and even closed his window.\u201cDrink some water. We\u2019ll go home very soon.\u201dHis voice was pitched low and softly, the words most likely spoken only for Yue Zhishi to hear, but Zhang Siyun still heard them.She reclined back into her seat, gaze studying the side of Song Yu\u2019s face. It had turned tender, and a slightly indescribable feeling rose in her heart.It was as though the person who had just suggested to her to climb the mountain alone was someone else entirely.After drinking enough water, Yue Zhishi curved his head onto the window, sniffling. \u201cWill I feel better if I slept a bit?\u201dSong Yu nodded and turned off the music playing in the car. \u201cCover yourself with the blanket.\u201dYue Zhishi remembered slightly awkwardly \u2014 the little blanket he always used seemed to be in the backseat.\u201cThis one?\u201d Zhang Siyun proactively grabbed it and gave to Yue Zhishi. Her fingers were long and slender, nails painted a rose colour, and a pretty rose gold ring was on her index finger.Yue Zhishi wanted to say thank you, but he had been a bit distracted \u2014 and so Zhang Siyun opened her mouth faster than he did.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I keep forgetting to ask.\u201d Her smile was sweet and charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s the relationship between the two of you?\u201dThe author has something to say:Conveniently mentioning that Ms Zhang isn\u2019t a evil female side character (spoiler)She could be considered as an assist for them to come out(/spoiler) PS she\u2019s not wlw either, she\u2019s just a super straightforward person, the kind who\u2019d immediately express her like for you if she likes youSong Yu has always treated people differently depending on who it is, he\u2019s only ever treated Yue Zhishi warmly, from beginning to now. Even to the very familiar Nan Jia, as long as he doesn\u2019t want to do it, he\u2019ll reject her \u2014 let alone this time it\u2019s his professor stubbornly forcing a strange Ms Zhang on him. He really is only here to fulfil chauffeur duties.Nan Jia once again here to complain: the first time I saw Song Yu at the basketball court, this guy immediately threw down his ball and left. He didn\u2019t even give me a single look, such a cold guy (pulling up the past)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Lovely AllergenCH 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88: Approaching WinterYue Zhishi no longer wanted to sleep after hearing that question.Guessing Song Yu wouldn\u2019t answer it, he thought carefully about how he should answer.Up to now, he and Song Yu were still in a secret relationship that couldn\u2019t be exposed. Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t \u2014 and couldn\u2019t \u2014 tell anyone he knew that he was Song Yu\u2019s lover. It would be even more inappropriate to give that answer to a girl who was similar to being a matchmaking partner for Song Yu, especially since that girl was the daughter of Song Yu\u2019s supervisor. It was likely to implicate Song Yu\u2019s studies.\u201cI\u2019ve lived in his home since I was a child.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s answer was a bit overly brief, so Zhang Siyun was naturally curious. \u201cEh? Why?\u201d\u201cBecause my parents have passed away, and\u2026. When my dad was still alive, he and Song Yu\u2019s father were good friends.\u201d\u201cJesus. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to ask that on purpose.\u201dYue Zhishi could see the dismay on Zhang Siyun\u2019s face, as well as a subtle touch of sympathy. There was a complicated mix of feelings in Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s nothing serious. They passed away when I was still very young, so I don\u2019t really remember them anymore.\u201dIn order to reduce someone else\u2019s guilt, he said some dishonest words and did his best to maintain the smile on his face. And yet he also didn\u2019t want to be taken as an adopted younger brother, so he said, \u201cBut I only live with his family, I\u2019m not legally related to them. Song Yu and I, we\u2026 we\u2019re just two people who\u2019ve grown up together.\u201dHis usage of \u2018just\u2019 was targeted towards his first sentence \u2014 he selfishly didn\u2019t want Zhang Siyun to think he truly was Song Yu\u2019s little brother. But the entirety of Yue Zhishi\u2019s answer, to Song Yu\u2019s ears, was as though he was clarifying something unpleasant.Song Yu was gazing out the car. The leaves had all been blown up into the sky from the strong winds, and they were floating, adrift; they couldn\u2019t fall to the ground no matter how they struggled.He didn\u2019t know whether he wanted them to land, or if he hoped for them to remain forever flying.\u201cI see, no wonder he takes care of you so well. I feel like the relationship between you two is particularly close, maybe even closer than some true blood related brothers.\u201d Zhang Siyun smiled after she finished speaking, looking at Song Yu. \u201cThere really is too much traffic. It might be lunchtime by the time we reach the university \u2014 let me treat you guys to lunch, as a thank you.\u201d\u201cNo need,\u201d Song Yu politely declined. \u201cThis was just a small matter.\u201dZhang Siyun didn\u2019t continue insisting on taking them to lunch, only saying very tactfully, \u201cWe can talk about it again later.\u201d\u201cOh yes, my dad told me about your graduation thesis. I hear you\u2019ve pretty much completed it already. I managed to take a look at some of your work thanks to my dad, and I\u2019m pretty interested in your topic too\u2026\u201dShe looked even more charming once she started talking about professional matters; Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t quite understand most of the things she talked about.In the past, Yue Zhishi would get very sleepy whenever he heard things he didn\u2019t understand \u2014 but today, as he sat there, he was completely unable to fall asleep.When faced with academic questions, Song Yu wouldn\u2019t be as silent as when he was given personal questions. He essentially would answer all of them, and Zhang Siyun was someone who knew very well how to ask questions.He didn\u2019t seem to be awkward anymore after a few rounds of questions. Song Yu no longer spread his resentment towards Professor Zhang into the car, and he became polite yet distanced, conversing with Ms Zhang like professional colleagues.Yue Zhishi quietly listened. He wanted to say something but couldn\u2019t \u2014 his major was too different. He could only follow along and praise Song Yu a few times before looking out at the congested bunch of cars; he stared at the car licence right in front of them.\u201cThat\u2019s very valuable,\u201d Zhang Siyun said, not stingy in her praise of Song Yu\u2019s innovation.\u201cSomeone\u2019s done it before,\u201d Song Yu indifferently said. \u201cI was only following what they\u2019ve done.\u201d\u201cIf you complete the later stages of the research with my dad, you\u2019ll definitely get a lot of achievements.\u201d Zhang Siyun leaned back into her seat and sighed, a cute tone in her voice, \u201cAh, as expected, smart men are the sexiest.\u201dAs though some wind had blown in from a secret little hole, Yue Zhishi found himself a bit cold, but he was convinced only he himself felt that way. He could only shrink into his cotton clothes. He rested peacefully for a while, but he still ended up opening his eyes and asking Song Yu, his voice very weak, \u201cCan I watch anime for a bit?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say there wasn\u2019t a new episode?\u201d Song Yu glanced at him. \u201cAnd it\u2019s easy to get car sick if you use your phone in the car.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I want to watch it again.\u201d He pulled out his earbuds and put them in, saying to Zhang Siyun, \u201cYou guys can talk, I\u2019m going to watch something.\u201dYue Zhishi turned back around after seeing Zhang Siyun give him a smile; he watched the video by himself, the sound turned up very loudly.He\u2019d actually watched this episode four times already. There was really nothing in it worth rewatching again, and since it was only twenty minutes long, he\u2019d almost already memorised all the dialogue. It was such a funny, boisterous episode, and yet maybe because he\u2019d watched it too many times, Yue Zhishi had no interest in it at all.With his earbuds in, he could still hear the muffled, vague noises of Zhang Siyun laughing; she seemed very happy. He too wanted to know what they were talking about to make her so happy, but the other half of him put a stop to those thoughts.One episode finished, and so he clicked onto the previous episode, pretending his video had still more to go. But Song Yu stopped the car \u2014 they had arrived.Yue Zhishi took off his earbuds and unfastened his seatbelt. He heard Zhang Siyun suggest, \u201cLook, since we\u2019re already here \u2014 there\u2019s a good western restaurant over there. They\u2019ve been open for many years. Let me treat you guys to a meal.\u201dZhang Siyun smiled as she pointed at her watch. \u201cIt\u2019s already a bit late. It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re hungry, but will you let your little brother go hungry too?\u201dYue Zhishi was thinking of something else, so when he heard them talk about him, he absent-mindedly nodded. \u201cI\u2019m fine with anything.\u201dSong Yu looked at him \u2014 he didn\u2019t want to go, so he still ended up rejecting her.Zhang Siyun didn\u2019t force them, taking her luggage from Song Yu. \u201cSince you\u2019re allowing me to owe you one meal today, I\u2019m definitely going to think of a way to return it back to you next time.\u201dBefore leaving, she brought up exchanging contact information. She was very smart, first adding Yue Zhishi\u2019s details before saying to him, \u201cJust forward your brother\u2019s WeChat to me, my hands are so cold I don\u2019t want to scan anymore.\u201dYue Zhishi hesitated for a very long time after she left. He still ended up mutely forwarding Song Yu\u2019s WeChat to her, locking his phone immediately afterwards.Yue Zhishi thought Zhang Siyun truly was someone who knew very well how to chase after someone. She didn\u2019t cling around when she knew she wasn\u2019t wanted, understanding when to gracefully step away. Her innate self-confidence was also very attractive, as though she\u2019d never lost before in front of others; it was why she was so sure of herself despite encountering Song Yu\u2019s cold personality, so assured she could take things one step at a time.If only he had her speaking skills \u2014 perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have pestered Song Yu for so many years.But in the next second, he consoled himself: Song Yu liked idiots.\u201cAre you hungry? There\u2019s a shopping centre up ahead, there should be a few restaurants in there.\u201dYue Zhishi said he wasn\u2019t hungry, but then he also said sure, let\u2019s go there to eat.They entered a Thai restaurant, and Song Yu ordered as usual \u2014 but this time, Yue Zhishi ate very little and didn\u2019t even touch his dessert and drink.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a good appetite today.\u201dYue Zhishi laughed. \u201cI ate too much in the morning.\u201d He started to list all the things he ate for breakfast.Song Yu quietly listened until he finished, and he raised his eyes to look at him. \u201cAre you unhappy?\u201dLowering his head, Yue Zhishi took a bite of his pudding. \u201cNot at all, I\u2019m just carsick.\u201dSong Yu paused, as if he was very seriously considering what he should say. \u201cThere\u2019s no possibility of Ms Zhang and me going further. This was all decided by themselves without asking.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think there was,\u201d Yue Zhishi said. His voice was so soft; it sounded like it had floated across.He felt like Song Yu had seen through him. Even though he was already used to that happening, he didn\u2019t want Song Yu to think he was someone who couldn\u2019t handle something small yet annoying when it came to something like this.He wasn\u2019t like that anyway \u2014 an uncountable number of people had liked Song Yu since childhood, and he\u2019d continuously heard gossip about Song Yu since junior high. He\u2019d received love letters for him, even passing on confessions; he\u2019d gotten used to it a long time ago.If Zhang Siyun had asked him today to help her pursue Song Yu, Yue Zhishi would\u2019ve still found it difficult to refuse her.Seeing him not continuing to speak, Song Yu stayed silent for a few seconds, thinking of how Yue Zhishi had said they had just been two people who\u2019d grown up together. He couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit disappointed, but he still gently said to Yue Zhishi, \u201cYou actually didn\u2019t need to explain so much to her.\u201dYue Zhishi knew he was referring to the relationship between them. His head remained lowered, as though in a daze, and he only asked in return in a very subdued voice after a long while had passed, \u201cThen what should I have done? Should I have not said anything like you \u2014 or should I have straight up and told her you were my boyfriend, please don\u2019t show interest in you and please also ask your father to not intervene anymore?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not childish enough to make you come out in front of your supervisor just because of my possessiveness.\u201d\u201cLe Le\u2026\u201d Song Yu reached out a hand, laying it on the back of Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand. He didn\u2019t reject it.His unhappiness didn\u2019t last for very long; after hearing Song Yu call out his name, Yue Zhishi suddenly felt he\u2019d been too harsh. What he\u2019d just said must\u2019ve made Song Yu feel uncomfortable \u2014 so very quickly, he let go of his emotions.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, gege.\u201d Yue Zhishi gave him a smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201dHis phone vibrated. Yue Zhishi checked; it was a message from Zhang Siyun.[Monica: Handsome boy~ I just added him, thank you for coming with Song Yu today to pick me up. I\u2019m heading to campus tomorrow, I\u2019ll bring you something tasty!]Yue Zhishi sent back a reply, his head lowered.[Yue Zhishi: It\u2019s okay, I didn\u2019t do anything][Monica: No no, I need to. By the way, what kind of cakes does Song Yu like? I saw he recently had his birthday, so I wanted to give him a belated birthday cake. It should be appropriate.]\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d Song Yu asked. \u201cZhang Siyun?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk to her,\u201d Song Yu said.\u201cIt\u2019s normal to chat a few times after adding someone.\u201d Yue Zhishi kept his head down, giving Zhang Siyun a very succinct suggestion.[Yue Zhishi: He doesn\u2019t eat sweets, perhaps coffee would be more suitable.]After finishing their food, Yue Zhishi said he wanted to head back \u2014 he had a class that afternoon.Song Yu paid and then took Yue Zhishi back to the underground car park, hugging him for a very long time. His father called once they\u2019d gotten into the car.His eyebrows were drawn together the entire time he was on the phone. \u201cWe\u2019ve dropped her off at home. No\u2026\u201dIt was very quiet in the car; it was as though the ability of Yue Zhishi\u2019s ears to hear had been magnified, keenly able to catch some indistinct words. Pieced together, they seemed to be asking about Zhang Siyun\u2019s personality.\u201cYou can\u2019t understand someone\u2019s personality just after one meeting\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d Song Yu explained into the phone, \u201cWe only talked about academic topics.\u201d\u201cMn, I know. I\u2019m driving, I\u2019m going to hang up.\u201dOnce they reached the entrance to their university, Song Yu didn\u2019t open the car doors, as though he was locking Yue Zhishi and himself into the car. He only opened his mouth after a long time had passed, saying, \u201cLe Le, don\u2019t be sad.\u201dThe tone in his voice as he said that sentence made Yue Zhishi think of what Song Yu had said before:\u00a0as long as you don\u2019t get sick, you can lose your temper however you\u2019d like.But he didn\u2019t think he could \u2014 let alone the fact he didn\u2019t have much of a temper to begin with.\u201cI\u2019m not sad. Honest.\u201d Yue Zhishi felt like his current mood couldn\u2019t really be described as \u2018sad\u2019; compared to what he\u2019d felt when he thought Song Yu was going to move in with someone after understanding his own heart, he was feeling much better. After all, he now knew the person Song Yu loved was him \u2014 there was no one else.He noticed Song Yu\u2019s phone lighting up again, Professor Zhang\u2019s name flashing on it, but he didn\u2019t speak. Instead, he felt a bit distressed for Song Yu; it felt like everyone was forcing him to move, step by step, and that included himself.Yue Zhishi touched Song Yu\u2019s arm and then leaned over the armrests in between them, giving him a soft hug. He wanted to give him some comfort.He wanted to say he really liked him, but he hesitated \u2014 he didn\u2019t end up saying it.He placed himself in Song Yu\u2019s position, and thought: if he heard himself saying he liked him right at this very moment, it would most likely be another kind of pressure.When compared to Song Yu being unhappy, the uneasy feeling in Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart seemed to dwindle, turning smaller and smaller until it was almost about to disappear completely. Only a tiny fragment remained.Song Yu calmed down, and his phone also stopped vibrating. He kissed Yue Zhishi\u2019s face, said he really loved him; in the end, he still let go and let Yue Zhishi go to class.Zhang Siyun came to campus the next day and sent Yue Zhishi a scenery photo she\u2019d taken, saying afterwards that she\u2019d bought him a cake. Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t want to tell her about his allergy, so he still went to meet her and pick up the cake, earnestly expressing his gratitude.Waving her hands, Zhang Siyun smiled and told him to not be so polite. When she saw that he\u2019d come out in his woolly home clothes, she suggested taking him back to his dorm, and the two of them walked together for a while, chatting about some things.\u201cHas your brother always been so serious and reserved?\u201d\u201cI suppose so.\u201d Yue Zhishi then softly said, \u201cHe\u2019s not my brother.\u201d\u201cAh yes. I said it without thinking.\u201d Zhang Siyun gave him a smile. \u201cI feel like he and I have a fair bit of things in common to talk about. Maybe it\u2019s because our studies are pretty similar that we can have conversations, but if I use you as a reference, then there\u2019s still a long way to go before we could be considered as getting along.\u201dYue Zhishi remembered their conversation in the car and agreed with her assessment. His ability to think seemed to have grown dull; after a good few seconds, he asked, faltering, \u201cSister Siyun, do you like Song Yu?\u201d\u201cAm I being too obvious?\u201d Zhang Siyun slightly widened her eyes. There was a spring in her voice, and the smile on her face was so adorable. \u201cDo you know? He really is my type. Even though he\u2019s a bit cold, it won\u2019t stop me \u2014 I think he\u2019s the kind of person who\u2019ll be really tender to you after getting into a relationship with you. Seeing how nicely he treats you, he should have a very gentle heart.\u201dYue Zhishi wanted to say, yes, you\u2019re right. But he didn\u2019t.Once they reached his dorm building, Yue Zhishi separated from Zhang Siyun and went up by himself, sharing the expensive-looking cake with his dorm mates.He swiped a finger through some of the cream and tasted it. He couldn\u2019t deny that it really was delicious.Winter came closer and closer, and the wind scraped on faces like the edge of an invisible knife. It rained once again the last few days, and the temperature in the city rapidly dropped. Yue Zhishi really did his best to stay warm, but he still caught a stuffy nose. He was afraid of getting sick, but he realised \u2014 whatever he was afraid of would always arrive.Other than this, he had another very profound realisation: as soon as someone noticed something and took it to heart, he would constantly, consistently, see it.Such as seeing Zhang Siyun and Song Yu in a certain deserted cafe on campus. He saw Song Yu\u2019s back as soon as he walked in; the two of them were sitting at the same table, saying something while face to face. They looked rather well-matched \u2014 Zhang Siyun was beautiful and straight-forward, and there was nothing wrong with the way she chose to interact with Song Yu.Yue Zhishi stood at the door, not taking any further steps. Using the excuse of the cafe not being warm, he pulled Jiang Yufan and Shen Mi away and found another place to study.Later, he saw a Moments post from Song Yu\u2019s senior sister in his research lab. He\u2019d added her earlier when he was giving out snowflake crisps.[Feels like the lofty, unapproachable ice mountain junior brother in my research lab might soon thaw from warmth.]And even later, he received a call from Lin Rong. She somehow saw a video of Zhang Siyun giving a speech, and she shared it with Yue Zhishi. She gave out rare compliments, saying Zhang Siyun was even more outstanding that she\u2019d imagined.\u201cThe daughter of a professor really is different. Right, Le Le?\u201dYue Zhishi agreed. In a bit of self despair, he even said, \u201cShe\u2019s also really nice. She\u2019s really pretty and really smart \u2014 she\u2019s able to talk professional matters with gege.\u201d\u201cThen there\u2019s still a chance. Talk to your brother a bit more, tell him not to be too cold when interacting with girls. Otherwise it\u2019ll be really easy for the girl to feel hurt.\u201dYue Zhishi could very much understand Lin Rong\u2019s words \u2014 after all, he himself had experienced it. But he still asked, refusing to give up, \u201cWhat if gege doesn\u2019t like her?\u201dLin Rong thought Song Yu had told him so. \u201cReally, did your brother say that? Well, I think this girl\u2019s already really nice, but this isn\u2019t something I can interfere with. Who knows, maybe your brother might end up liking her after a while.\u201dYue Zhishi didn\u2019t say anything else.His relationship didn\u2019t stop just because of the sudden appearance of a girl.They sent messages to each other every day, just like usual. They talked to each other, just like usual. They also ate and studied together, and would even hug and kiss each other in the dark corners of the campus \u2014 but Song Yu could still feel the change in Yue Zhishi.He was now even more understanding and obedient than before. He didn\u2019t ask anything about Zhang Siyun, didn\u2019t show any signs of unhappiness; he actively shared with Song Yu any jokes he\u2019d heard or interesting things that had happened to him, and when they were intimate with each other, his actions were as though he was submitting to Song Yu what little energy he had.Song Yu urged him to live in the apartment with him, and Yue Zhishi readily agreed. But he never slept well.Whenever Yue Zhishi was sleeping very deeply, his whole body would be very relaxed; he\u2019d sleep on Song Yu\u2019s arm without a single qualm. But he hadn\u2019t done so, recently \u2014 he would adjust his sleeping position very carefully, his breathing light and delicate.In the mornings, Song Yu would kiss his forehead and ask how he\u2019d slept; Yue Zhishi would purse his lips and smile, his eyes curving, and say with a sincere look on his face that he\u2019d slept very well \u2014 and then he\u2019d hold Song Yu in his arms, as though extremely afraid he\u2019d lose him.Whenever they were around other people and someone made a joke about him and Zhang Siyun, calling her the \u2018newly arrived beautiful lady\u2019, Yue Zhishi would also nod. He\u2019d echo and say she truly was very beautiful. Yet in the empty corners, in the apartment with just the two of them, Yue Zhishi would hold him again and again, unceasingly pressing close to him and even initiating things \u2014 as though hoping he could obtain and prove something through their intimate touches.Since the very start of his adolescence, Song Yu had wanted to have Yue Zhishi. But he hadn\u2019t wanted a Yue Zhishi like this.During a Monday team meeting, Professor Zhang called Song Yu a \u2018family member\u2019 in front of everyone. It made him so very uncomfortable, and he immediately left the meeting, using the excuse of needing the bathroom.He wanted to vomit.All of this made him unable to breathe. It felt like he was captured inside a massive net while Yue Zhishi was stranded outside, lost and fearful. If only Yue Zhishi was a bit more impulsive and either complained or thrown a tantrum at him \u2014 Song Yu wouldn\u2019t have felt distressed even if he did so.Except in reality, on the second time Zhang Siyun had come to campus, Song Yu had already politely yet explicitly expressed to her that he wasn\u2019t planning on getting into a relationship.She\u2019d gone to the research lab her first time on campus; Song Yu couldn\u2019t stop her, since that was her father\u2019s research lab.But there was no way he could put up with forced meetings and forced arrangements.There were some things Song Yu wanted to clear up face to face, but Zhang Siyun felt like they should speak in a place suitable for a conversation \u2014 such as a cafe on campus.\u201cYou speak in such absolutes, as if to you, dating is something that needs to be planned out.\u201d After hearing Song Yu\u2019s words, Zhang Siyun didn\u2019t feel very disappointed. She even chuckled, her fingers wrapped around a silver spoon as she lightly stirred the coffee in front of her. Her eyes, though, were focused on Song Yu, who was sitting across from her.\u201cYou guessed correctly. I really do like you. So you can actually reject me even more frankly \u2014 you don\u2019t look like someone who would speak in such a roundabout way.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Zhang Siyun propped her cheek on a hand, \u201csince you\u2019re single, I should still have a chance to pursue you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not single,\u201d Song Yu calmly said. His voice was firm. \u201cI have a partner, and I love him very much \u2014 I really care about what he thinks.\u201dZhang Siyun\u2019s movements paused, as though considering something. She tried to find a single shred of evidence on Song Yu\u2019s face to prove he was lying, but she couldn\u2019t. Song Yu was as resolute as though he could only see one person for his entire life, his passion unceasing.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d She smiled generously. \u201cThen I\u2019ll temporarily shelve my plans to pursue you and be an honest friend. Even though I\u2019m truly really curious about what kind of girl you like, I feel like you wouldn\u2019t want to talk too much about her.\u201dShe brushed away the long hair on her shoulders, a painted finger lightly tapping on the table. \u201cSong Yu, you wouldn\u2019t be dating a girl your parents wouldn\u2019t like, would you? They should be completely in the dark about your relationship, or how else would I have gotten involved?\u201d\u201cDo you really not plan on laying things out and telling your parents?\u201dSong Yu had wanted to wait until later, or at least until after he\u2019d graduated \u2014 until after he\u2019d confirmed again and again that Yue Zhishi wouldn\u2019t feel regret because of him.But now, he himself started to feel a tinge of regret.He wanted to make themselves known at this very moment, but how should Yue Zhishi handle himself afterwards? Could he trust the person in front of him?It was such an untimely, unwelcome memory, but Song Yu thought of Xu Qichen in the past; he could feel stabbing, stinging pain in his chest.He was afraid of Yue Zhishi receiving even the tiniest, the smallest bit of harm.Seeing him fall silent, Zhang Siyun said with a bit of incomprehension, \u201cIn a secret relationship, your partner will end up hurt no matter what. It doesn\u2019t matter how much you care for them; you can\u2019t prevent your parents from matchmaking. Such as me.\u201dShe recalled how Song Yu had icily called her Ms Zhang the first time they\u2019d met. She found how he\u2019d acted particularly reasonable now \u2014 no man would be willing to put up with his parents and professor forcing him to meet another girl when he had a partner. Especially when that man was someone like Song Yu, a proud and haughty man favoured by the heavens.She couldn\u2019t help but laugh, and then she released a sigh. \u201cSong Yu, someone as excellent as you will always have people chasing after you. After rejecting a Ms Zhang, there might be a Ms Wang, Ms Li or even a Ms Yang. How many rounds of this can your girlfriend endure?\u201dThe author has something to say:After returning to school, Song Yu was forced to see Ms Zhang for a total of two times. The first time, Ms Zhang went to the research lab (he couldn\u2019t avoid her there no matter what), and the second time was when he rejected Ms Zhang at the cafe.Le Le bumped into their second meeting. Actually, the pain and provocation he\u2019s been suffering have mainly been from the people around him, but those people haven\u2019t meant to do so \u2014 they don\u2019t know the truth.My books have never been tagged with the \u2018sweet\u2019 tag. From the side characters getting outed and then being bullied at school in the beginning, to the fashion show in the rain a few chapters ago, everyone should understand that this isn\u2019t a book where homosexuality is openly accepted and treated as normal. It\u2019s similar to our world \u2014 coming out isn\u2019t so simple.Also, I\u2019ve written in the introduction that this book doesn\u2019t have a strong shou. I don\u2019t know why there are still arguments about it by the time we\u2019ve reached this chapter. I really don\u2019t understand.Le Le\u2019s character has never been someone \u2018completely optimist and self-confident\u2019. If you think he is, I think there might be a misunderstanding. He\u2019s very happy on the surface, but he lacks a sense of security. He needs a very strong intimate dependency. He\u2019s clung to gege since he\u2019s been a child and even went to gege\u2019s university to look for him. He had separation anxiety, and he broke down after liking gege. He even is somewhat touch starved at certain times, endlessly demanding gege\u2019s touch. All of these things together is the true Yue Zhishi below the surface. Why is he like that? It\u2019s very simple. Because other than himself, Yue Zhishi has nothing else.Can a foster family keep him his entire life? Can love remain forever? It\u2019s very hard to say.Can someone with so little have the confidence to reject other people whenever he wants? That\u2019s so hard to do \u2014 and so Yue Zhishi is always the one satisfying other people. No matter if it\u2019s his friends, or his lover.He can talk about death so openly because he thinks it\u2019s something very easy to talk about. Accidents are hard to predict; that\u2019s how his parents died. And so he really cherishes the Song family \u2014 they are a treasure that he managed to get, yet they don\u2019t belong to him. The more warmth and love he is given, the more insecure he feels. It would\u2019ve been fine if he didn\u2019t have any to begin with, but as soon as he\u2019s given the smallest amount, he becomes very afraid of losing it.I\u2019ve seen some people say that if his parents hadn\u2019t died, he should\u2019ve been someone as confident as Ms Zhang. Yes, having parents versus not having parents makes a very large difference. If Yue Zhishi had his parents, then he would\u2019ve had particularly outstanding credentials. With his father as a famous journalist and his mother so kind and gentle, he would\u2019ve grown up with love and care, and with his loveable face and personality, his talents and abilities, he would\u2019ve had a very perfect life.But the brutal thing is, he wasn\u2019t able to become such a person. All the things he\u2019s missed out on has left a crack down his life.Sensitive, considering others more than himself, kind and naive, and even sometimes treating himself very cruelly \u2014 that is Yue Zhishi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m not trying to force you.\u201dThe smile on Zhang Siyun\u2019s face slightly faded away. \u201cBut your parents seem to really care about your love life and future marriage. If you don\u2019t tell them, they\u2019ll still think they can introduce suitable girls to you in the future. There\u2019ll only be more and more problems between you and your girlfriend, and once more time has passed, she really might end up leaving you. Do you know how hard it is for a girl when she\u2019s tired? Please \u2014 that shouldn\u2019t be what you want, right?\u201dSeeing Song Yu\u2019s tightly drawn eyebrows, Zhang Siyun held her chin in her hands. \u201cI\u2019m serious. I\u2019m saying all of this from the bottom of my heart.\u201dSong Yu looked at her with some uncertainty as he heard her encouraging him once again. \u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Zhang Siyun blinked. \u201cPlans?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you just say you were temporarily shelving your plans.\u201d Song Yu blandly explained to her, \u201cI\u2019ve liked this person for many years already. I will acknowledge only him in this lifetime.\u201d\u201cI know. Don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t have any more plans.\u201d Zhang Siyun took a sip of her coffee and put the cup back down. \u201cI only said \u2018temporarily shelving\u2019 in order to leave myself some face. It was so rare for me to fall in love at first sight, only for you to already have a girlfriend. I ended up wasting my heart. I\u2019m actually quite hurt, but I care more about how I look than my broken heart. I don\u2019t want to blubber and spill a cup of coffee over you \u2014 how terrible would that look?\u201d\u201cAh yes, saying we could be friends was also to leave some dignity for the both of us since I can\u2019t just disappear after yelling at you. Don\u2019t mention that plan anymore; it was just talk. Don\u2019t take it seriously. I might be dating a new handsome guy next week, and having a friend like you around would only affect my peach blossoms. We\u2019re not the same kind of people. You hold love sacred while me \u2014 I intend on enjoying my life to its fullest.\u201dStanding up, she paid the bill before saying to Song Yu, \u201cHey, I\u2019m being serious. What if your parents end up accepting her if you just try? Someone who could make you like them \u2014 wouldn\u2019t they be the kind of treasure found only in the heavens?\u201d\u201cTrue love is very powerful. You should believe in fairy tales for once in your life, classmate Song Yu.\u201dHe stayed by himself in that cold and deserted cafe for a very long time, thinking.In the few days after, Song Yu submitted his application to change his graduation thesis topic three times, only for them to all be turned down. He was swamped with needing to submit all different kinds of data every day, needing to run back and forth among different offices, and yet he still wasn\u2019t able to get the answer he wanted.When he\u2019d first been guaranteed a spot in the postgraduate program, Song Yu had already looked for Professor He, who was in charge of the research area he liked. But the professor had been too busy \u2014 Song Yu had waited for him outside his office for several days in row. He\u2019d only bumped into him the last day he\u2019d gone, and Professor He had been very surprised to see him.\u201cI know you.\u201d Professor He had hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019re very famous. Why are you thinking of coming to me?\u201dSong Yu had talked to him for a long time, and old Professor He had finally agreed, patting his shoulder. \u201cYoung fellow, our research area here is the most tiring, most bitter kind \u2014 it\u2019s also really dangerous. It\u2019s completely only to serve the people.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cFine, I can see you\u2019ve already decided. Come over once you\u2019ve graduated.\u201dThinking of what Professor He had said, Song Yu held onto his rejected application and knocked on Professor Zhang\u2019s office door.Professor Zhang looked at ease, inviting Song Yu to sit down and chat, but Song Yu rejected his offer.\u201cSong Yu, I\u2019ve said this before. I have no problem with you changing research areas during your postgraduate studies. We can talk about it again when you start postgrad, there\u2019s no rush.\u201d Professor Zhang poured a cup of tea and pushed it in front of Song Yu. \u201cBut why do you want to change your graduation thesis topic now too? That\u2019s not common practice at all. Have you seen anyone else do so?\u201dSong Yu looked at his eyes and said apathetically, \u201cProfessor Zhang, I\u2019ve said before that I don\u2019t want to be forced into a direction by other people. When I first chose you for my research, you\u2019d hoped I would follow you for postgrad. I told you then that my future postgrad research would be in a different area, and you\u2019d said that was fine, no problem. But your later actions didn\u2019t follow what you\u2019d said. There should be boundaries between people. You\u2019ve done too much now, and have also interfered with too much.\u201d\u201cYes, I did say that, but Song Yu \u2014 you yourself know that your best future will be from following me. Your father agrees too; I\u2019ve discussed this with him for a long while, and he\u2019s also really satisfied with the future plans I\u2019ve created for you\u2026\u201d\u201cProfessor Zhang,\u201d Song Yu interrupted him, \u201cmy father is different from you. He might\u2019ve been convinced by what you said, but he will respect my interest. Also\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no possibility between your daughter and me. Please respect me, and please respect her.\u201d\u201cAll of that is stuff to be talked about later, Song Yu.\u201d Professor Zhang crossed his arms. \u201cYou\u2019ve already almost finished the first draft of your thesis, and your research results are also ready to be used. Even if I let you be the first person to change your thesis like this, would you still be able to successfully graduate? Do you not want your previous work anymore? Child, be realistic. You still have a very long road ahead of you.\u201dSong Yu finished listening and then laughed. \u201cProfessor Zhang, I don\u2019t want it anymore. If you\u2019re willing to let me change, I\u2019ll be grateful. If you\u2019re not willing, I can apply for an extension.\u201d\u201cYour postgraduate spot\u2019s already confirmed and yet you\u2019re talking about an extension? Song Yu, is there something wrong with you?\u201d\u201cI can take the entrance exams again. Based on my abilities, there\u2019s no way I won\u2019t be able to get in. Just like you said \u2014 I still have a very long road ahead of me.\u201d The expression of Song Yu\u2019s face was transparent yet cold. \u201cWhy is why I will not be controlled by other people. I will only walk the road I choose.\u201dHe then turned around and left the office, tearing apart and throwing that rejected application into the bin.As he walked downstairs, he received messages from his mother \u2014 many of them.[Ms Lin: Xiao Yu, let mom borrow the computer in your room! I need to urgently edit a menu, but I can\u2019t use photoshop on my laptop anymore.]Song Yu sent her his password as he continued walking.[Xiao Yu: Remember to turn it off for me.]In order to prevent seeing Zhang Siyun again, Song Yu moved out of the research lab. Very fortunately, on the day he was moving things out, Professor He saw him; he was on the same floor, and he allowed Song Yu to follow him into his research lab with his boxes.\u201cYou can sit there.\u201d Opening the door to the research lab, Professor He pointed at an empty spot. \u201cYour senior brother\u2019s gone to an internship and won\u2019t be back until graduation.\u201d He patted Song Yu\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYoung man, work hard. There\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be overcome.\u201dLater, Professor He left, and Song Yu placed his boxes onto the desk. The senior brother next to him swivelled his chair around to him and said, \u201cJunior brother, are you coming to our group?\u201d\u201cI hope I can,\u201d Song Yu briefly said.His phone rang again; it was still messages from Lin Rong.[Ms Lin: So strange, why can\u2019t I find where your photoshop saves files?][Ms Lin: Heavens, I wouldn\u2019t have lost all of my work, would I?][Xiao Yu: You\u2019ll be able to find it if you just search around. There are only so many folders in the computer.]\u201cWe all know about your fall out with Old Zhang. What a terrible person, what kind of person would use his power to pressure a student?\u201d The senior shook his head. \u201cEven Old He\u2019s heard about it. So awkward.\u201dAnother senior sister laughed as she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s so awkward for Old He? He was even laughing the other day in his office, saying if he\u2019d known earlier that such a popular student liked him so much, he would\u2019ve gone and agreed to take the student for his graduation thesis. But he was too busy and ended up missing out on a treasure.\u201d\u201cOld He\u2019s just like a old naughty child. He\u2019s not afraid of Old Zhang.\u201d The senior brother clicked the ballpoint pen in his hand. \u201cGood luck, junior brother.\u201dSong Yu thought, if he really did end up pushing back his graduation, it\u2019d be fine as long as he could still test in. There was no difference in coming in a year earlier or a year later.As he left the classroom building, Song Yu wanted to give Yue Zhishi a call, but a call came through first from Nan Jia. He hesitated for a bit before picking it up.\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Nan Jia said over the phone, \u201cI\u2019ll be succinct. Are you and Le Le arguing? Why did I see him at the hospital to get checked out by himself? I don\u2019t know what happened, it\u2019s also possible that he just didn\u2019t want you to worry. I just saw him at the register on the first floor when I went to get my meds. I wanted to stay with him, but then I thought, he should be needing you more right now.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. You should hurry.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t know how he actually drove to the university hospital \u2014 it felt like his brain was an utter mess. There had been too, too many \u2018last straws\u2019 pressing down on him lately; he honestly couldn\u2019t count nor distinguish them apart anymore.But there was no way he could\u2019ve thought that Yue Zhishi would sneak away to the hospital by himself instead of choosing to rely on him.The hospital was filled with people as it always was, chaotic and messy, and the pale white lighting fell onto many sorrowful and worried faces. The disinfectant solution violently crushed all the complicated smells together and sent the mixture directly into noses, making people uncomfortable. Struggling to maintain his calm exterior, Song Yu searched through each full injection room before finally seeing him at the end of the corridor.Yue Zhishi was wearing a thick, cotton-padded jacket in black, and he was sitting on the bench in the corridor; Song Yu\u2019s checkered grey scarf was around his neck, and a black woollen cap was on his head. His entire face, ghostly pale, was sunken in, and his eyes were wide as he stared at the phone held horizontally in his hands.An IV pole was next to him with only a small bit remaining of the drip. The veins on the back of his lowered hand were sticking out, a needle poked into one of them, but Yue Zhishi had no expression on his face. He looked very docile, not crying nor making a fuss.For a moment, Song Yu\u2019s emotions surged; there was a slight burning in his eyes. He walked towards Yue Zhishi and then crouched down halfway in front of him.There was a tiny freeze in Yue Zhishi\u2019s movements, those large pale-coloured eyes gazing at Song Yu blankly. His dark brown eyelashes trembled; at last, he let go of the phone in his hand and lifted it to touch Song Yu\u2019s forehead.Only then did he say, \u201cHow are you here?\u201dSong Yu couldn\u2019t say a single harsh word now that he was in front of Yue Zhishi. He caught Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand, not really caring that this was the university hospital and someone they\u2019d know might show up \u2014 he held his hand, and kissed the back of it.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were sick?\u201d Song Yu looked at him, his voice very soft. \u201cDo you have a fever?\u201d\u201cA low one, 38 degrees.\u201d Yue Zhishi gave Song Yu a smile and pulled him up, not wanting him to keep crouching. \u201cYou\u2019re so busy. I can come by myself.\u201dIn the corridor filled with people passing by, Song Yu reached out and pulled Yue Zhishi into his arms.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t allowed to see the doctor by themselves when they\u2019re sick.\u201dYue Zhishi had initially felt a bit uncomfortable at how openly they were touching within the university hospital, but after hearing the words come out of Song Yu\u2019s mouth with such certainty, he wanted to laugh. \u201cThere\u2019s no such rule as that.\u201d\u201cWe have that rule in our family.\u201d Song Yu stroked his face and then added, \u201cOur future family.\u201dYue Zhishi wanted to say when did we ever have a family, but he felt like it would be too hurtful \u2014 and so he raised his head and looked at the drip.\u201cI think it\u2019s finished.\u201d He patted Song Yu and reached out to pull out the needle himself, but Song Yu stopped him.Song Yu said, \u201cYou can\u2019t pull it out yourself, have you gone dumb? You also don\u2019t have any cotton for the blood.\u201d But very quickly, his voice gentled. \u201cBe good, I\u2019ll go call a nurse.\u201dSeeing Song Yu\u2019s receding figure, Yue Zhishi felt the entire last few moments hadn\u2019t been quite real. He nudged the needle \u2014 it hurt.He thought of how dizzily he\u2019d left his self-study classroom, lining up at the hospital and then paying his fees; he\u2019d even taken the wrong medicine script and had been scolded by the dispensing doctor. The injection rooms has been full of people, and so he had only been able to sit in the windy, cigarette smoke-filled corridor with his drip.After two hours, Yue Zhishi finally thought his suffering was about to end. It was a large step forward in his personal life, but at the final moment, as everything was about to come to a close, Song Yu still ended up appearing.Yue Zhishi really wanted to learn how Song Yu had mastered the ability of being to find him no matter when and where he was. Perhaps if he could learn it too, then maybe one day, during Song Yu\u2019s most painful moments, he wouldn\u2019t appear so slowly.A nurse took out the needle as he was lost in his thoughts and even told him very gently that he needed to come tomorrow, too. Yue Zhishi thanked her. Song Yu grabbed his hand, pressing a piece of cotton onto it for him, and pulled him outside with their hands linked together. He took him back to the apartment.As he drove, he told Yue Zhishi the good news about Professor He actively letting him into his research lab. Yue Zhishi was very happy, and he kissed him a good few times during red lights.Song Yu didn\u2019t mention anything else.Once back at the apartment, Song Yu turned on the aircon and left it on high, urging Yue Zhishi to take his meds and rest. Yue Zhishi obediently took off his outside clothes and crawled into bed before he suddenly remembered something \u2014 he pulled out a chocolate wafer bar from his jacket, putting it on top of the bedside table.\u201cLet\u2019s check your temperature again.\u201d Holding onto the thermometer, Song Yu sat onto the side of the bed and handed it to Yue Zhishi. He looked at the bar as he did so.\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you since I can\u2019t eat it anyway. I think the inside is made of flour.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019d it come from?\u201d Song Yu grabbed the bar and gave it a look before putting it back down. \u201cSomeone gave you candy again?\u201dYue Zhishi nodded. \u201cThere was originally another four year old boy on the bench where I was sitting. He gave it to me.\u201d A cute look appeared on his face, and his eyes glowed as he described to Song Yu, \u201cHe looked a bit like you. His hair was so black, and so were his eyes. He was a very good-looking child. Plus he was particularly hard to get along with.\u201dSong Yu gave him a perplexed look, but Yue Zhishi continued, holding onto his arm. He even imitated the boy as he repeated his words. \u201cThe kid said,\u00a0you\u2019re so strange-looking, why are your eyes like that?\u00a0His mom told him off, saying he didn\u2019t have any manners, and then he apologised to me really stiffly. He took out a piece of candy from his pocket and gave it to me. He said,\u00a0this candy\u2019s not nice,\u00a0I don\u2019t like it. You can have it.\u201dYue Zhishi started to laugh. \u201cHis mom later told me it was his favourite candy, and he\u2019d never given it away before.\u201dAnd then, he looked at Song Yu. \u201cIsn\u2019t that really similar to you?\u201dSong Yu looked entirely reluctant to admit it.\u201cI wondered then if you were as adorable as that when you were four.\u201d The smile on Yue Zhishi\u2019s face slowly faded away, his eyes losing focus. \u201cGege, you probably really like children, right?\u201dSong Yu frowned. \u201cWhy are you asking?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s voice came lightly. \u201cBecause you keep talking about me having a baby.\u201dThe lights in the room were very warm, and it made even the fine hair on Yue Zhishi\u2019s fair face look soft. He spoke softly, voice drifting, \u201cYou know that, right \u2014 no matter how many times we have sex, we\u2019ll never have a child.\u201dThere were some things that could never come to pass, just like how there were some candies Yue Zhishi could never eat.Song Yu\u2019s heart felt like it\u2019d been brutally yanked by that one sentence.\u201cI was teasing you.\u201dIf he\u2019d known that these things would happen, that there was a possibility of him being forced to marry and create a family, Song Yu definitely wouldn\u2019t have chosen such a poor joke that could give Yue Zhishi pain.It was just that he\u2019d been too happy. Every minute, every second that he\u2019d been with Yue Zhishi, he\u2019d felt so happy, so free. He\u2019d never been able to find those feelings from anyone or anything else. The joy felt a bit foreign to Song Yu; it was why he had been so unsure about what to do after he managed to grab hold of it, only able to move slowly, cautiously; it was why he\u2019d said some absurd and laughable things to amuse his own lover \u2014 in front of Yue Zhishi, he\u2019d turned into an immature child.\u201cI don\u2019t like kids at all. They\u2019re noisy, always crying and making a fuss, and they take up too much energy.\u201d Song Yu truthfully confessed, \u201cI know we won\u2019t have any, which was why I dared to joke about it. To be honest, to me, the significance of having a child is simply obtaining another identity. Such as \u2018your child\u2019s father\u2019, or \u2018your partner\u2019. Wouldn\u2019t it be harder for you to leave me the more identities based on love and duty we have between us?\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019d be best if we don\u2019t have any.\u201d Song Yu even said somewhat spitefully, \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to take away the feelings that belong to me. If you have a baby, you\u2019ll definitely put all your focus on them. I don\u2019t want a child. In our family, we only need two people \u2014 you and me.\u201dYue Zhishi was a bit surprised; he didn\u2019t think Song Yu would answer him like this.He dubiously asked, \u201cYou really don\u2019t like babies?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Song Yu leaned over, touching his lips to Yue Zhishi\u2019s forehead, and caressed his cheek.\u201cBesides, I already have a\u00a0baobao. I want to take care of only him.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s nose suddenly started to burn. His heart hurt, but he didn\u2019t cry. Song Yu held him, soothed him to sleep, told him don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t be sad, he was with him no matter what.He said very tenderly that everything would get better soon \u2014 as soon as Yue Zhishi woke up, everything would\u2019ve gotten much better, they\u2019d feel much more relaxed than now, much freer.The flu medicine gradually started to work, and Yue Zhishi started to feel woozy; he fell asleep in those secure arms.He didn\u2019t know how long he\u2019d slept for, abruptly feeling his heart twist in his dreams. Yue Zhishi blinked open his eyes, and he uneasily called out Song Yu\u2019s name. He could only see the medicine and the milk candy he could eat on the bedside table. There was a note underneath them, and it said, [I\u2019ll be back very soon. I\u2019ll bring you back something delicious, wait for me to come home.]He stared at the note and then looked at the clock on the wall. It was already 11pm, and the anxious, uneasy feeling in his heart dragged at him. For some reason, he remembered Song Yu\u2019s actions in the hospital; he\u2019d not cared about other people\u2019s eyes. He remembered the words Song Yu had said as he\u2019d soothed him to sleep, and it felt like he faintly, indistinctly, found multiple clues.Yue Zhishi grabbed his phone and gave Song Yu a call. No one picked up. He calmed down and called Lin Rong.Once again, no one picked up.His thoughts having been verified, Yue Zhishi ran downstairs. He couldn\u2019t find Song Yu\u2019s car, so he immediately took a taxi and returned back to the Song family\u2019s home.He ran to the elevator, frantically waiting for the doors to open; his hands were trembling as the doors opened. In that moment, he realised he was wearing cotton slippers \u2014 the fever plaster was still on his forehead, and he looked very muddled, very panicked.After taking two seconds to collect himself, he opened the door and heard Father Song\u2019s voice. Ever since he\u2019d arrived at Song Yu\u2019s home at three years old, this was the first time Yue Zhishi had heard Song Jin so angry \u2014 he might not have sounded irrational, but his voice had lost all of its previous gentleness.\u201cSong Yu, as a father, I\u2019ve never asked for anything from you. I\u2019ve never held you back from anything you wanted to learn, and that includes the day you said you wanted to change research directions. You said you wanted to research natural disaster emergency mapping, and even though I really wasn\u2019t willing to let you do it, did I say a single thing to you? Have you ever considered that after all these years, I would still have nightmares at night and think about your Uncle Yue after seeing people dying from disasters on the news?\u201dHis voice was shaking. \u201cYou said you wanted to do something so dangerous because emergency mapping relief could mean there\u2019ll be less children like Le Le in the world. After you said something like that, no matter how fearful or unwilling my heart was, I still agreed and let you do what you wanted.\u201dYue Zhishi froze in place after hearing those words.Song Yu had never told him.\u201cBut you? What have you done? I brought back your Uncle Yue\u2019s only remaining flesh and blood and hoped for him to grow up well. I didn\u2019t bring him back for you to pull him onto such a path and have him suffer! When I die in the future, how can I face your uncle in the afterlife?\u201d\u201cSong Jin, since Xiao Yu came back and told us himself, that means he\u2019s already considered it\u2026\u201dYue Zhishi heard Lin Rong\u2019s voice; it sounded faintly tearful, and suddenly, his heart felt very painful.\u201cConsidered it? He\u2019s admitting that he likes men. If it weren\u2019t for you accidentally seeing that letter, would he have come out and told you the person he\u2019s dating is Yue Zhishi?\u201dLin Rong held back her tears, saying, \u201cThen what would you have your son do? Of course he wouldn\u2019t want things to be like this \u2014 do you really think Xiao Yu is someone who would purposefully influence Le Le? Wasn\u2019t that letter already clear enough? Xiao Yu, he\u2026 he never wanted anything.\u201dSong Jin fell silent for a few seconds.To Yue Zhishi, those seconds passed as though they were years.\u201cSong Yu, you say you like men. There are so many men in this world, so why does it have to be Le Le? He grew up with you, almost exactly like real brothers \u2014 don\u2019t you think that\u2019s strange?\u201dSong Yu\u2019s voice finally appeared. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t like men. I only like Yue Zhishi. Yes, there are so many people in the world, and yes, to fall in love with the little brother I grew up with \u2014 I did find it strange and abnormal. Dad, do you think I didn\u2019t suffer?\u201dAfter a long time, only then did Song Jin open his mouth. The emotions in his voice had changed.\u201cOf course you can say you like Le Le now, that you will accept no one else but him. But what about later? Nowadays, young people break up so easily. What if one day your heart changes and you break up with him and want to be together with someone else? Song Yu, what would you have Yue Zhishi do then? Would he still be able to continue living with us? How would other people look at him \u2014 how would they talk about him?\u201d\u201cHe lost his family at three years old. If a day like that really happened, the two of you wouldn\u2019t be able to go back to being brothers. Do you want him to once again taste how it feels to no longer have a family? Xiao Yu, the path you\u2019re walking on is a path of no return!\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Firmly and unwavering, Song Yu said, \u201cI\u2019ve never thought about turning back.\u201dYue Zhishi stepped forward, walking from the entrance to the living room. It was only a few short metres, yet every step was so difficult.He finally needed to peel away the protective shell of darkness and reveal his true self underneath the light.It was as though Lin Rong\u2019s voice was right next to his ear. \u201cXiao Yu, you\u2019ve never thought about turning back, but what about the other way around?\u201dIf one day, Yue Zhishi wanted to be with someone else.\u201cOther way around\u2026\u201d Song Yu chuckled bleakly. \u201cYue Zhishi can turn back whenever he wants, I\u2019m willing to let him go. But as long as he doesn\u2019t want to leave me, I will definitely not let go.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave him.\u201dYue Zhishi walked out of the entrance corridor, the blinding living room lights falling on his body.The arguing parents looked at him, but Yue Zhishi\u2019s eyes landed onto that printed piece of paper on the floor. He bent over, picking it up.[To a certain someone who\u2019ll appear in the future:I don\u2019t really want to say hello. I don\u2019t even really want you to appear. But I know a day like this will come, and in order for you to take better care of Yue Zhishi, to prevent any danger from happening at the beginning of your relationship, I\u2019ve prepared this ahead of time. I\u2019ve written this \u2018Manual to Dating Yue Zhishi\u2019 \u2014 please read it carefully.Firstly, Yue Zhishi suffers from a very severe wheat allergy. Obviously, he has no fate with anything that has to do with wheat. I hope you won\u2019t let him eat cake just because he asks (he\u2019s very good at whining). Even just the smallest bit could take away his life. His allergy symptoms are extremely dangerous. In mild cases, he\u2019ll get rashes and diarrhoea. In severe cases, his asthma will flare up.This is the second thing I need to tell you. You have to carry his medicine with you at all times, and it\u2019d be best if you could master how to give emergency first aid for asthma. It\u2019s not hard \u2014 if you need, I can send you the videos I used to learn. They\u2019re very useful. Please make sure you appear by his side when he needs you.His parents passed away a long time ago. I hope you won\u2019t bring them up too often. Even though he doesn\u2019t say so, but he really cares about that (and don\u2019t take him to watch too many movies about families, his head will hurt if he cries too much).Also, he\u2019s really scared of thunder, he\u2019s been like that since the first day he came to my family. Please don\u2019t laugh when you see this \u2014 don\u2019t look down on being scared of thunder. He really is afraid, and you have to respect his fear. Overcoming it is actually very simple. You only need to cover one ear for him and sleep next to him at night, it\u2019s fine even if you don\u2019t hold him (of course, you can hug and kiss him, you\u2019re not me).Yue Zhishi really loves sweets and small animals. For breakfast, he likes eating soup buns (you need to eat the skin) and rice noodles. He\u2019s obsessed with anime, please don\u2019t question his hobby. And he\u2019s also really good at drawing and making things by hand \u2014 please treasure his work and don\u2019t carelessly leave them around. He\u2019ll be hurt if he sees. If he gives you stickers that could be used on anything, I sincerely hope you won\u2019t misuse them.Even though all the things above might make you want to retreat, you\u2019re actually really lucky. Yue Zhishi is the world\u2019s kindest, gentlest child. He won\u2019t ask you for too many things, and he doesn\u2019t have a temper either. He actually finds it very hard to reject other people, so I hope you can teach him how to say no \u2014 I also hope you can tolerate his dietary restrictions and can forgive his small temper tantrums when he\u2019s sick (he\u2019s actually really cute when he starts fussing).I ended up writing a lot despite getting rid of a lot of things. If I think of anything new, I\u2019ll add it in. You might think I\u2019m overstepping my boundaries, that I have no right to say anything of this. But if I could\u2019ve received a letter like this when I was six years old, before meeting him, I would\u2019ve been very grateful.Please treat him well. Don\u2019t let Yue Zhishi cry; he really likes crying. If you find him annoying, please send him back or contact me immediately to take him back home. Please don\u2019t leave him by himself.Yue Zhishi\u2019s older brother, Song Yu]What Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t see was \u2014 the document was named [5201010 (manual, draft 4)], saved five years ago.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They answered, yes.After driving home, it was Lin Rong who opened the door. Her eyes were red and teary, looking as if she\u2019d just cried. A bad feeling grew in Song Yu\u2019s heart, but Lin Rong didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cXiao Yu, you\u2019re back.\u201dSong Jin was sitting on the sofa and didn\u2019t look at him, only asking why he was coming over so late.Song Yu first clearly and orderly stated his plans for changing his graduation thesis topic. He was met with Song Jin\u2019s questioning. Song Jin said, \u201cEven if Professor Zhang agrees to you switching topics, it\u2019s already so late. The semester\u2019s about to finish \u2014 are you sure there are still professors who\u2019ll take you?\u201d\u201cWhich is why I can also push back my graduation. I\u2019ve had enough of Professor Zhang using my private life to pressure me and to block me from graduating. Even if I stay in his research group, as long as I don\u2019t agree with his decisions, he still won\u2019t let me successfully graduate. I may as well leave first.\u201dSong Jin was silent for a very long time before saying quietly, \u201cIf you really aren\u2019t interested in Ms Zhang, we won\u2019t force you.\u201d\u201cNot only am I not interested in Ms Zhang, I am not interested in any future Ms Li or Ms Wang that may appear. I may never want to date any girl that everyone thinks is suitable.\u201d Song Yu stood ramrod straight. \u201cDad, Mom, even though you always say I\u2019ve never disappointed you, I actually can\u2019t fulfil the expectations of a son. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve never been able to tell you.\u201d\u201cI like men, and I already have someone I\u2019m dating.\u201d Song Yu openly said, \u201cSo I won\u2019t create a family with a girl. I can\u2019t lie to myself, and I can\u2019t deceive and hurt other people. I know your constant encouragement for me to date isn\u2019t because you really want me to continue the Song family bloodline; it\u2019s just that you think I\u2019m too lonely. But can you guys imagine how painful it would be for a girl to marry someone like me?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t do something like that, so please give up on those thoughts. Even if I have to live by myself in the future, I can still live very well.\u201dHearing his words, Lin Rong finally couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. She cried as she asked, \u201cReally? Do you really think like that?\u201dSong Jin grabbed a paper from the sofa, throwing it to Song Yu. The paper, as thin as the edge of a blade, fluttered and swayed as it sliced through the heavy air. It finally landed next to Song Yu\u2019s legs.He lowered his eyes. Seeing the opening, he understood.Song Jin\u2019s voice was trembling, but Song Yu couldn\u2019t tell if it was because of anger or grief.\u201cSong Yu. Don\u2019t tell me that the person you\u2019re dating\u2026 is your brother.\u201dHe\u2019d thought he wouldn\u2019t feel anything, but cutting open and giving his parents a look at his difficult past as it dripped with blood was truly even more unpleasant than he\u2019d imagined. He was very grateful for his father\u2019s teachings; it was what stopped him from saying things like \u2018don\u2019t you feel disgusted\u2019.\u201cYes,\u201d Song Yu said. \u201cIt\u2019s Yue Zhishi. But he\u2019s not my brother. We have a normal relationship, it doesn\u2019t break any laws.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re boasting like that? Song Yu, what are you thinking? Other than not being related by blood to you, there\u2019s no difference between him and your real younger brother! You watched as I brought him back home!\u201dFaced with rage, Song Yu\u2019s face prickled with pain. He told himself to not feel anything, to go numb, but he knew what he\u2019d said wasn\u2019t so easy to accept. In his parents\u2019 eyes, Yue Zhishi truly was no different from a true born son \u2014 and because he was the orphan of a close friend, they were even more protective of him. He had essentially stepped on his father\u2019s most inviolable bottom line.When he heard his father stand up, shaking, when he saw his father look at him with his eyebrows drawn and say, his voice angry yet weak, \u201cSong Yu, wake up\u201d\u2014\u2014the tranquil look on Song Yu\u2019s face finally splintered.\u201cDad, it\u2019s been so many years. Have I not been sober enough?\u201dHad the manual, hidden in his computer, really been written for Yue Zhishi\u2019s future partner?It hadn\u2019t been. It was simply a warning Song Yu had written to himself during his most lost, most desperate times \u2014 a reminder to himself that someone was definitely going to appear next by Yue Zhishi\u2019s side in the future, a reminder that he needed to remember his status and his boundaries. No matter how well he wrote it, the signature at the end could only be [Yue Zhishi\u2019s older brother].And that person in the future didn\u2019t actually need a \u2018dating manual\u2019; as long as they obtained Yue Zhishi\u2019s love, it would be enough.\u201cHow many times do you think I\u2019ve edited that letter?\u201d Song Yu calmly said, \u201cI have eleven drafts.\u201dHe did his best to control his emotions so that he could appear more composed; after all, it was already in the past.\u201cWhenever I thought I couldn\u2019t endure anymore, I would see Yue Zhishi and think,\u00a0I like him so much \u2014 why can\u2019t it be me?\u00a0Every time that happened, I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep. I\u2019d open that document and edit it, deleting some lines that couldn\u2019t \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t \u2014 be left in there. I\u2019d try my best to make sure that letter would look more like it came from a normal older brother. And then I\u2019d tell myself: this is what I should be doing. All of those feelings were like useless drafts; they shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201dA rueful smile hung on his wan face, and he looked towards his parents.\u201cYou should have looked for all of them and printed them out. You should\u2019ve read it from the first draft to the eleventh \u2014 what a magnificent sight that would\u2019ve been.\u201d\u201cAfter reading through all of them, you would\u2019ve thought \u2014 wow, Song Yu\u2019s so noble.\u201dThe manual filled with various warnings lay soundlessly on the cold floor, colourlessly bearing the weight of Song Yu five years ago after he\u2019d amended his words once again. He\u2019d changed the words that had left a younger him with a face full of tears and a heart full of pain; he\u2019d deleted the hostility he\u2019d felt towards Yue Zhishi\u2019s future partner and the entrustment that had crossed boundaries \u2014 all just so he could learn how to calmly accept the appearance of a him or a her.Over many sleepless nights, he\u2019d learned how to say at the letter\u2019s beginning:\u00a0Hello, I\u2019m very glad to see you. He\u2019d learned how to gift at the ending:\u00a0May the two of you be happy for a very long time.And then, as he edited the letter again and again, he\u2019d learned how to slowly accept the signature at the very end.The printed lines looked the same as Song Yu himself: neat and orderly, calm and free from any emotions. It gave that youthfully ignorant him from the past the dignified and mature shell an adult should have. But all the many Song Yus of all those years passed \u2014 they all seemed to stand here at this moment, staying with him as he weathered through this explosion.And Yue Zhishi, who\u2019d existed in every single draft yet had never been allowed the reading list, was also stunned where he stood. The quarrelling and arguing that had stopped him from moving seemed to be hammering heavily onto his chest, but the letter was the true dagger. It was too sharp, which was why it didn\u2019t hurt the moment it slid in; it was only when he realised, too late, that he felt the piercing pain boring into his heart.Large drops of tears splattered on top, almost enough to blotch those cold and detached printed words; he wanted to peel away the fragile soul hidden within the paper and let him be free.\u201cLe Le, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lin Rong messily wiped away her tears and stood up, looking at him. \u201cWhy did you come over like this? Are you sick?\u201dHearing those words, Yue Zhishi felt even more pain.He struggled to hold himself back from shaking. He composed himself a bit, and then he lowered the hand holding that piece of paper and also rubbed off the tears on his face. He looked at them.\u201cUncle Song, Aunt Rong. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dYue Zhishi thought, if he knelt down right now, it might seem more like a kind of coercion \u2014 and so he gave them a very deep, very formal bow.\u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m sorry to express my apologies. I\u2019m saying it because I truly have let you guys down. I\u2019ve failed to live up to the love and care you\u2019ve given me since childhood. Aunt Rong, do you remember last time when you came to university to visit me because I was sick? It was then. I confessed to Song Yu using my sickness as my excuse.\u201dHe closed his eyes and then opened them again, each word and sentence leaving his mouth full of certainty. \u201cSo this entire matter belongs to me. I started it. If you really want to say there was someone influencing the other, then I was the one who influenced everything Song Yu did. In this relationship, Song Yu has actually been the passive one.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s eyes were red, his lips free of any colour, but his eyes were very bright, steadfast and calm. \u201cI\u2019ve had a very strong separation anxiety towards Song Yu since I was a child. I\u2019d get so anxious to the point it was no longer normal, which was why I did so many improper things growing up. Such as forcing him to sleep on the same bed as me, wanting to hold hands with him, wanting to hold him; even wanting to kiss him back when he was still just my brother. I gave him my so-called confession when I was suffering from a fever and was crying in pain. Tell me \u2014 during a situation like that, how could Song Yu have rejected me?\u201dHe pulled all of the responsibility onto himself. The cause was him, the source was also him; Song Yu had nothing to do with anything.\u201cBecause Song Yu used to keep wanting to keep his distance from me, to stay away from me, my requests towards him are actually slightly pathological.\u201dAs he spoke, he unexpectedly smiled. \u201cJust like an allergy. Doctors say you can\u2019t eat this and you can\u2019t eat that because you\u2019re allergic, you might die if you eat them. Fine, I won\u2019t touch them. Even though I\u2019ve been very obedient the last ten-plus years, sometimes, I actually particularly wanted to eat them. And now that I want to be together with someone, I can\u2019t do that either. I\u2019m almost about to go crazy from wanting to stay by his side.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Liking someone clearly doesn\u2019t make me allergic, but why are there still so many adverse reactions?\u201d\u201cWhen I realised I liked him, I really did suffer. I completely couldn\u2019t think about how I should act if Song Yu one day got together with someone else. But once Song Yu and I became a couple, I was tormented again. I didn\u2019t dare come back to see you, didn\u2019t dare to give you a phone call. Someone like me would be a burden no matter which family I was in \u2014 I was so hard to take care of, and yet I\u2019m still so selfish. You\u2019ve raised me like your own son, and yet I\u2019ve done something like this.\u201dHis hands unconsciously clenched, the paper wrinkling from his grasp.Neither Song Jin and Lin Rong could speak as they watched their perpetually smiling younger son say those words through gritted teeth.\u201cI\u2019ve actually thought about it before.\u201d Yue Zhishi just barely managed to give them a smile, using a relatively relaxed voice to tell them what he\u2019d previously planned. \u201cAt the beginning, I thought Song Yu was forced to agree to my confession, so I thought \u2014 I needed to really, really treasure this period of time with him. And then, when\u2026 when he one day has had enough, I would leave this family. I\u2019d go to a place where no one knows me and do my best to earn money. And then I\u2019d sneakily transfer the money to the family\u2019s bank cards.\u201dLowering his head, Yue Zhishi groped out his phone in a bit of a panic. He searched through it, his words starting to grow messy. \u201cI, I\u2019ve calculated it before, all\u2026 all the money I\u2019ve spent since I was a child. But, but I only started to record it down during third year of junior high. I could only find a general estimate online for the expenses for the years before, but I\u2019ve recorded down all the years after. I, I wanted to multiply that sum several times over and then, once I started to earn money, I\u2019d leave enough for myself to eat and rent a place. Everything else I would send back. Of course, I wouldn\u2019t be able to fully repay all you\u2019ve given me, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to make up for wasting your feelings. But it\u2019s always better to try than to not try at all.\u201dSong Jin sat back on the sofa in a daze after hearing these words. He mutely shook his head.But Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t stop; he pulled out the plan in his phone and lifted it high for them to see as though he was discussing a joyful family holiday trip. \u201cI\u2019ve looked at many suitable places for me to stay \u2014 I have places both inside and outside the country, and I have their house prices, their costs of living, as well as how much it would cost to rent a place to live. I\u2019ve already made plans for all of these things.\u201d\u201cLook, I actually planned it out well, haven\u2019t I? A place like Yunnan would be very nice; Yunnan\u2019s really pretty and is really far away from here. I feel like it\u2019d be a good place to hide myself away. When I\u2019m there, I could rent a small house and raise a cat. Or maybe I\u2019d stay at one place for a period of time and then keep moving around like a secret agent. It\u2019d be so cool, but I might earn less that way, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to pay you back\u2026\u201dThe small dog wandering on the street might not actually be a stray dog. The world was so large, he could take any place for home.It was only after he\u2019d been warmly raised and then had lost that home that he would become a true stray.Every single word and every single sentence that left Yue Zhishi\u2019s mouth stabbed onto the hearts of the two parents. Neither one had thought that within this wonderful and peaceful home, both of their children had been living underneath the weight of a burden that could collapse at any given moment.What they couldn\u2019t have imagined even more was that Yue Zhishi had been calculating the burden he\u2019d brought onto this family every day, hoping there would be a day he could clear away his debt.Lin Rong finally couldn\u2019t keep listening anymore, interrupting him with her face covered with tears. \u201cLe Le! You\u2026 How could you think like that?\u201dYue Zhishi breathed and breathed; he wanted to smile, but it felt like he cried when he eventually smiled.\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to see Song Yu with someone else.\u201d\u201cAunt Rong, I really do particularly love him.\u201d Yue Zhishi stubbornly held back his tears, worried they\u2019d continue rolling down and make him look not sincere or steadfast enough. \u201cAnd it was only after we got together that I understood Song Yu really loves me as well \u2014 he can\u2019t be without me. Did you know? Sometimes when he\u2019s by himself, he can\u2019t fall asleep at all. He\u2019ll eat so many tablets as though he was sick. I\u2019m so afraid.\u201dHe murmured, \u201cI\u2019m truly really afraid,\u201d and kept repeating again and again the two words of \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cUncle, Aunt Rong, I know I\u2019ve committed something really wrong. I really do. But if he could be even the slightest bit happier when he sees me, then I don\u2019t mind not dating as long as I can stay by his side. I don\u2019t care at all about what other people say about me or how they look at me; I\u2019m actually not even afraid of being thrown away. To you, a trust like that might seem very blind, but the only thing I\u2019m afraid of is Song Yu not living well. Of him not being healthy and not being happy.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s mouth and fingers were trembling. He lowered his head, a bit upset about how he hadn\u2019t been able to control his own emotions. He must\u2019ve looked so vulnerable.\u201cHonestly \u2014 there are so many good cities in this world, but I have nowhere to go.\u201d\u201cI only want to stay by Song Yu\u2019s side.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It reported an orphan who\u2019d lost his parents after a disaster, and words such as \u2018good samaritans from all walks of life\u2019, \u2018charity\u2019 and \u2018deeds done from the heart\u2019 kept being said, again and again.At that time, he\u2019d been docilely sitting in front of the television, and yet he\u2019d thought,\u00a0I\u2019m so similar to him.The choice of wording in that piece of news seemed to etch into his heart. Every time he saw anything similar, Yue Zhishi would compare himself to the people within, and then silently whisper in his heart,\u00a0I\u2019m so lucky.Later, he couldn\u2019t help but deem every person who treated him well as a \u2018good samaritan\u2019. He treated the love and care everyone gave him as \u2018charity\u2019, and then did his best to return the heart others had given him. All of those behaviours had already long been carved into his bones and had become part of him, unable to be cut away.But within the multitude of so many kind people, the two people Yue Zhishi wanted to repay the most, yet was most unable to repay, were the Song parents.As he hoped to always be able to offer them happiness and warmth, he also gave them irreversible harm because of his selfish love. The two conflicting desires pushed and pulled at each other, dragging at him until he was almost torn apart.Standing in the living room, Yue Zhishi thought with remorse and anger that he must\u2019ve definitely come across very badly. His illness and panic had thrown his thoughts into chaos, to the point even he himself didn\u2019t know what he was saying.He clearly could\u2019ve been steadier. He clearly could\u2019ve not cried.This living room, to them, was way too familiar. The phantom ghosts of happiness seemed to remain in every single corner. Yue Zhishi and Song Yu sitting in front of their parents\u2019 knees when they were children, building lego blocks; the four of them sitting in front of the television together, fighting to watch different shows; them cuddling up together under the same extra large woollen blanket during winter \u2014 as well as the uncountable amount of times they\u2019d eaten late night snacks, together.Within that same space, they were now separated. Those closely knit together hearts had been divided by cold air, and every single one of them was silent from grief, each second passing as though they were years.He didn\u2019t know how much time had passed. Feeling as though he was hearing things, Yue Zhishi heard Song Jin speak, his voice laboured and hoarse.\u201cIt was all my fault.\u201dShe\u2019d only heard that one sentence, and yet Lin Rong was already choking with sobs.\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart stung. \u201cUncle Song\u2026\u201dSong Jin sat on the sofa, the sight of his back looking as though he\u2019d aged ten years. \u201cI busied myself earning money everyday, hoping for you guys to be able to have a more plentiful life without any burdens. Whenever I came home, I just wanted to spend time with you, to chat. I wanted to be a satisfactory parent, because we actually carry the hopes of two families on our shoulders. I didn\u2019t expect to not actually understand the two children I\u2019ve raised after passing so many years. Sometimes I\u2019d look at the two of you and think,\u00a0not bad. I didn\u2019t have a single regret in this life, with both of my children so outstanding, such good people. I was particularly proud of myself, to the point where I thought that I could\u2026 could stand a bit straighter when I went to see Yue Yi again.\u201dHis voice was slightly shaky, his eyes blank as he gazed at the black television screen. It was as though Yue Yi was standing in front of him, as though he could slip an arm around his shoulders like he used to do in the past. \u201cI could say to him \u2014 look at how well I\u2019ve raised your son. I might\u2019ve raised him even better than you could\u2019ve done.\u201dSong Jin shook his head. \u201cGood thing I was just dreaming. If he really found out I thought that way, he might find me particularly laughable.\u201dHis smile slowly disappeared. \u201cI\u2026 Later, I kept thinking things didn\u2019t feel right. Why didn\u2019t Song Yu come home? Why was he always by himself? With his credentials, it wasn\u2019t like he couldn\u2019t find someone to be with him. He kept insisting he wouldn\u2019t date, and with his cold personality, I had nothing to say. And then, when Le Le started university and stopped coming home too, I became even more confused.\u201dAs she listened, Lin Rong covered her face with her hands.\u201cDo the two of you know? Xiao Rong and I, we look forward to you coming home every weekend. As soon as it\u2019s the weekend, she\u2019d cook and fill the table with food. And then it would just be the two of us, eating face to face and never able to finish all the food. We thought to ourselves, were we not good enough parents? Did we not care enough about you? So we did our best to care more, to plan and worry more for your future.\u201dSong Yu lowered his head, his hands fisting.\u201cBut the few times you guys came back, it looked like you were quite happy. I couldn\u2019t understand it no matter how hard I tried, so I could only tell myself that you\u2019ve grown up, that you have your own lives now. That it\u2019s all normal. Right?\u201d He laughed at himself. \u201cOnly just to have things turn out like this. Who would\u2019ve thought \u2014 my older son ended up liking my \u2018younger son\u2019. Even television dramas wouldn\u2019t dare to do show something like this.\u201dHe nodded to himself and then mumbled to himself, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s better to know early on. It\u2019s better than being kept in the dark. I tried so hard to plan for you guys, but I see there\u2019s no need in the future. We won\u2019t have to waste other girls\u2019 time.\u201d\u201cIf I say now that I can accept you guys, then I\u2019d be lying. No one can accept their own children suddenly being together. Everyone around us knows that you\u2019re brothers \u2014 everyone calls you the two sons of the Song family. Now that you\u2019re together, if you walk outside holding hands, how awkward would it be? People would call you two brothers, and then how would you explain it? If you explain and then walk away, how would everyone talk about you behind your backs? These are all things you can\u2019t hide from.\u201dThey were not pleasant sounding words, but they were all said from the bottom of Song Jin\u2019s heart.\u201cI\u2019m old enough that I don\u2019t care. If they want to say our family\u2019s a mess, that all of this was from Xiao Rong and me, then I have no choice but to accept it. But you guys still have such long lives ahead of you\u2026\u201d He then sunk once again into a long, long silence, as though he\u2019d lost all of his strength.When he opened his mouth again, each word that came out sounded like they\u2019d been gouged and pulled out from his heart, bit by bit, by a dull knife.\u201cWhen you\u2019re walking on the streets, people might call you disgusting. You might be laughed at. No one would care\u2026 no one would care how pure or how good your love is. Prejudiced people will look at you the same way they\u2019d look at mentally ill people.\u201d\u201cSong Jin, don\u2019t talk anymore.\u201d Lin Rong couldn\u2019t keep listening anymore. She went to sit next to him, half leaning on him, and embraced him.\u201cI want to say it.\u201d Song Jin took a deep breath, resolution in his voice. \u201cYou have to make sure they\u2019re clear about what they\u2019re doing. What I say now is nothing compared to what they have to face in the future. If they\u2019re faced with it later on and then regret what they\u2019ve done, thinking they can\u2019t endure it, then this family will truly break apart.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already failed as a father. I don\u2019t want you guys to later have unsuccessful lives.\u201d Song Jin stood up from the sofa, the sight of his back utterly exhausted. The man who\u2019d used to be able to carry Yue Zhishi as an toddler with one hand while carrying Song Yu as a child with another hand was now older \u2014 and yet he was sorrowfully pouring out the confusion and bewilderment he felt towards his two children, the uneasiness he felt towards their future.Song Yu thought \u2014 he made his father age ten years over the span of one night.\u201cI can see that you guys already want to walk down this path until its dark end. Fine, your lives are your own. No matter how much we want to help you, no matter how much we want to lead you towards the bright, wide roads, we\u2019ll just be wasting our time. Let\u2019s just leave it.\u201dHis words finished, Song Jin went around the sofa. He didn\u2019t look at Song Yu and didn\u2019t look at Yue Zhishi, heading towards the entrance to the house.Lin Rong turned around, anxiously calling out to him, \u201cSong Jin, where are you going?\u201dHe put on his coat, opened the door. The cold wind blew straight inside.\u201cI\u2019m going to buy a pack of cigarettes. My heart\u2019s scared. I\u2019ll come back after I\u2019ve had a smoke. If you guys want to head back to campus, go ahead. It\u2019s up to you.\u201dHe took one step forward, then paused.\u201cLe Le.\u201dYue Zhishi looked towards him.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d He sighed. \u201cWhen you thought about leaving, why didn\u2019t you think about me and your Aunt Rong? We\u2019ve raised you for so long, only for you to repay us by separating from our flesh and blood?\u201dThose words stabbed violently into Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart.\u201cForget it. Forget it.\u201dThe door closed, the sound of it very soft.Yue Zhishi remembered something Aunt Rong had said before. She\u2019d said in the beginning, Uncle Song had smoked a ferocious amount due to the stress of his business. But later, when he\u2019d brought Yue Zhishi home and learned he had asthma, he\u2019d stubbornly fought his addiction and gave up smoking. He\u2019d given it up for sixteen years.It didn\u2019t matter if Yue Zhishi was home or not \u2014 he hadn\u2019t touched cigarettes even once.Only the three of them were left in the house. Song Yu\u2019s back was turned, and he couldn\u2019t see his face clearly. Lin Rong had still yet to stop crying. Yue Zhishi was most unwilling to see her cry, and it was like his feet couldn\u2019t be controlled at all as they walked towards Lin Rong.When he stood in front of her, seeing her face covered with tears, Yue Zhishi painfully called out to her, begging her to not cry anymore.\u201cIf you keep crying\u2026 your eyes\u2019ll be swollen tomorrow.\u201dLin Rong hid her face and shook her head weakly. After a few moments, she raised her head and looked at him. \u201cLe Le, is there really no other way?\u201dYue Zhishi really wanted to give her a response as he looked into her eyes.But it was as though he\u2019d lost his voice; he couldn\u2019t say a single word.In the end, Lin Rong was still the one who gave up.Her head was lowered, the sounds of her crying very soft, and she repeatedly asked again and again words such as \u2018why did things turn out like this\u2019 \u2014 perhaps she was asking Yue Zhishi or Song Yu, or perhaps she was asking herself. A long time later, when she finally believed everything that had happened was real, the tears slightly paused at last.\u201cIt\u2019s late now. You won\u2019t be able to get back into your dorms if you head back now.\u201d She sniffled, holding onto the sofa\u2019s armrest as she stood up. She walked towards the staircase, and then she paused, turning back to her two children as she said, \u201cGo clean up. Try to rest early.\u201dAs he heard the sounds of Lin Rong climbing up the stairs, every step seemed to land on Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart.Only he and Song Yu were left in the living room. Ever since Yue Zhishi had come back, standing in the entrance corridor, he\u2019d only heard Song Yu say two sentences. He\u2019d wordlessly stood there, accepting and taking in everything like a criminal silently awaiting his final judgment.Yue Zhishi headed towards him, and when he arrived in front of Song Yu, he didn\u2019t quite dare to hold him. They stood in this home like two people nailed onto their crosses; they were both guilty, yet they had no way of touching each other.\u201cSong Yu\u2026\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t reach out and hold him either. He only lifted a hand, pulled off the fever plaster on his forehead and caressed him.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you put on more clothes when you came out?\u201d he merely asked.Yue Zhishi remembered the pain he\u2019d felt in his dreams. He thought \u2014 maybe he really had joined together with the person in front of him.Even though they weren\u2019t born from the same mother, they were like two trees with their roots and branches gnarled and intertwined together. Even if one of them were cut down, he could still keep living within the other\u2019s veins and roots.\u201cGo clean up.\u201d Song Yu stroked his head. \u201cYou need to sleep earlier to get better faster.\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter how unwilling Yue Zhishi was, he still yielded to Song Yu\u2019s decision and went upstairs by himself, entering his own room. In the dark room, Yue Zhishi leaned against his door, silent. He was a bit dizzy from his low fever, and in the maze of his thoughts, he prayed for Song Jin to no longer feel scared after his smoke; he prayed for Lin Rong to no longer cry for them. He also prayed for Song Yu to finally unload the heavy burden within his heart.Nights were always extraordinarily hard to endure. They were like an aimless, swaying long shot in a film; people would always feel unsettled when watching and want to put an end to it \u2014 yet he didn\u2019t have the ability to do so.As he laid in bed, Yue Zhishi suddenly wondered: could this be one of his nightmares?He used many different ways to determine if this moment was real, but his heavy flu lowered his consciousness and made it hard to think.Abruptly, he heard a knock on the door. He even thought he imagined it, but then in the next second, Lin Rong came in.\u201cAunt Rong\u2026\u201dShe placed the warm cup of water in her hands onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s bedside table and also placed down the flu tablets in her hand.\u201cSleep after you take some meds.\u201d Her eyes were lowered, not looking at Yue Zhishi, and the sound of her voice was also so soft, so light.Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart burned, and his nose unceasingly stung; he struggled to nod, and then he lifted up the water and tablets. He didn\u2019t say anything, only very obediently swallowing down the medicine.Lin Rong sat on the side on the bed, her hands clenching the blanket without her realising. She held back from moving, from talking, until Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t hold back anymore and hugged her \u2014 only then could she no longer endure.\u201cYou little white-eyed wolf, I love you so much and yet you were thinking of leaving me?\u201d She was clearly saying such harsh words, but she had started crying again, her tears falling onto Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulders. She smacked him very lightly, like a young girl complaining about his lack of feelings. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of me having your money if you\u2019re not with me? Why didn\u2019t you think about what I would do if I fell sick by myself at home? Who would go to the hospital with me? Who would help me with the restaurant when I\u2019m too busy?\u201d\u201cI did think about it, I\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi squeezed her tightly, tears also flowing down his face. \u201cI thought about it before, I would secretly come and see you, would secretly look into Yanghe Qizhe from the doors\u2026\u201d\u201cHeartless, you\u2019re so heartless. I treated you as my baby, as my treasure.\u201d Lin Rong couldn\u2019t keep speaking through her tears; she could only shake her head on Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder. She let Yue Zhishi soothe her, coaxing her until she truly stopped crying, and then moved her head up. She touched the soaked patch on Yue Zhishi\u2019s shoulder and took a deep breath \u2014 she gazed at Yue Zhishi\u2019s face for a very long moment, as though he really was going to disappear one day.When she\u2019d finally looked enough and prepared to leave, taking away the cup as she did so, she saw the group photo of their family while on an outing on the mantle of Yue Zhishi\u2019s bed. She stroked it, and then finally stood up, walking towards the door.Opening the door to leave, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from turning back. In a choked voice, she said to Yue Zhishi \u2014\u201cGo sleep with your brother. I\u2019m worried he won\u2019t be able to sleep tonight.\u201dThe author has something to say:[1010 (draft 11)]To Yue Zhishi\u2019s future lover:Hello, I\u2019m very glad to meet you. I\u2019m Yue Zhishi\u2019s older brother. You must be very curious about why you\u2019d receive a letter like this. Don\u2019t be nervous, this is just something I\u2019ve prepared ahead of time. The past me wasn\u2019t familiar with him, and so the first time I met him, I almost committed a grave mistake. In order to prevent something like that from happening to you, I decided to write down this \u2018Manual to Dating Yue Zhishi\u2019 and inform you ahead of time about some things you might need to know.Firstly, Yue Zhishi suffers from a severe wheat allergy. He can\u2019t eat anything with wheat. I hope you can keep an eye on him. I\u2019m really sorry to trouble you, but when you eat together with him, you might also need to have some dietary restrictions. His allergy symptoms are extremely severe. In mild cases, he\u2019ll get rashes and diarrhoea. In severe cases, his asthma will flare up.Which is why, if possible, I hope you can carry his medicine with you at all times. It\u2019s a really small box; it won\u2019t take up too much space. It\u2019s just in case. Because other than his allergy, his asthma might flare up if he exercises too much, catches the flu or if his emotions are affected too much. If he doesn\u2019t take his medicine, he might pass away within a few minutes. But most of the time, he would have his medicine with him. It would be great if you could be willing to learn how to give emergency first aid for asthma \u2014 if you need, I can teach you. It\u2019s very simple and isn\u2019t hard to learn.Sometimes during stormy days, he might find it hard to fall asleep and might affect your sleep. But it\u2019s only because he\u2019s a bit afraid of thunder \u2014 it\u2019s fine as long as there\u2019s someone by his side.The above lines are the things he\u2019s allergic to and afraid of, but other than that, Yue Zhishi almost has no shortcomings. Since the two of you already love each other, I imagine there\u2019s no need for me to talk about his strong points. He treats everyone extremely gently and warmly; I believe he would treat you even more so.Even though his parents passed away a long time ago, he still grew up under the care of everyone in our family. About his original family, you don\u2019t have to worry \u2014 Yue Zhishi has never harmed anyone. He has a gentle and kind heart. The world is so large, and yet he chose you. I believe you must also be someone extremely outstanding.May the two of you be happy for a very long time.Yue Zhishi\u2019s older brother, Song Yu.Saved in the summer four years ago.(Don\u2019t cry anymore, things will slowly recover and then get better, Zhichu doesn\u2019t write BE)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

By the time he came out of his daze, his face was already dripping with tears.Ever since he and Song Yu had gotten together, Yue Zhishi had had many nightmares no one had known about as he slept in Song Yu\u2019s arms. Such as being caught as they\u2019d embraced and kissed each other, Lin Rong and Song Jin exceedingly angry and hysterical from rage. The fanciful, distorted images in his dreams had been tattered and covered in scarlet, filled with crashes, blows and ear-piercing buzzes like a kind of unending warning.What people said was true \u2014 dreams were the opposite of reality.In reality, that pair of parents felt pain and suffering more than anger, panic coming before misunderstanding. Because they loved them too much, they weren\u2019t able to find even a single place to hurt them.Yue Zhishi thought he truly was very cruel, but ever since he\u2019d been a child, he\u2019d known only what it meant to give things in exchange. He\u2019d be deeply grateful after receiving the smallest little thing, and then he\u2019d immediately dig out part of himself to trade.[Thank you. Do you want this? This is mine, I\u2019ll give it you. I can give you many, many things.]To the point where he\u2019d stayed in a hotel room with his lover, and it hadn\u2019t mattered how expensive it was; he wanted to pay for one night, too.He had no way to accept other people\u2019s love with a clear conscience.After possessing Song Yu, it became even more impossible. If he\u2019d been willing, he honestly could\u2019ve enjoyed a whole lifetime of the Song family\u2019s love and care like a family member who truly belonged to the family. But he hadn\u2019t dared.He\u2019d never mentioned it, but Yue Zhishi had always remembered the conversation he\u2019d unintentionally overheard at the hospital. The words \u2018outsider\u2019 and \u2018someone else\u2019 were forever nailed onto his heart.Because no one knew what would happen tomorrow, because no one knew when this love and care would disappear, he\u2019d planned out his future life in spite of himself. He\u2019d planned out what he should do after losing these beautiful dreams, so that if that day really came, he wouldn\u2019t be left with nothing and nowhere to go.No one would be willing to live a whole life by themselves, and neither did he want to leave this family.But he had needed to prepare.The night at 2am was quiet enough to leave people unsettled. Yue Zhishi walked to Song Yu\u2019s room and reached out, attempting to open the door. Just like always, Song Yu hadn\u2019t locked the door. His room was finally no longer that unbroken darkness with the curtains tightly drawn. The sharp, cold rays of the moon penetrated inside, leaving a broken piece of moonlight on the carpet. Part of the blanket bulged upwards, not moving, and looked like a frigid mountain range underneath the dim moon.Stepping onto that soft carpet, Yue Zhishi came closer as quietly as he could. It was an untimely thought, but he remembered himself in the past; he\u2019d thought up all those different kinds of ways and ideas in the hope of being able to stay in Song Yu\u2019s room. Now, he understood: at that time, Song Yu too had yearned for him to stay.The two of them in the past had been separated by an unbreakable barrier. They\u2019d looked like they were extremely close to each other, but they\u2019d had no way to touch skin to skin.After lifting up a corner of the blanket, Yue Zhishi quietly slid inside, finally feeling some sense of warmth as he hugged Song Yu\u2019s back. This embrace felt like it\u2019d taken a long, long time in coming, and Yue Zhishi pushed his face into Song Yu\u2019s back, his arms wrapping tightly around him.\u201cAunt Rong told me to come stay with you,\u201d Yue Zhishi said very softly.With merely a hug, he knew Song Yu wasn\u2019t asleep; he would\u2019ve been able to tell even with just the sound of his breathing. The inside of Song Yu\u2019s blanket was too cold \u2014 Yue Zhishi was actually a bit grateful towards his current low fever. At least during this moment, he could give Song Yu a bit more warmth.His hands smoothed lightly over Song Yu\u2019s arms, as though he was soothing him to sleep. Song Yu lay on his side in front of the moon, a teardrop soundlessly tumbling down from the corner of his eyes. It hid in the soft fibres of his pillow, as if it had never existed.After a few moments, Song Yu flipped over and slid his arms filled with security around Yue Zhishi\u2019s body to embrace him in return. He rested his forehead on top of Yue Zhishi\u2019s and asked, \u201cHow\u2019s your fever?\u201d\u201cDoes your body still ache?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s nose was burning, his eyes swollen and painful. He shook his head and didn\u2019t say a single thing, only holding Song Yu tightly.Song Yu\u2019s voice came out like a sigh, the words leaving his mouth so delicately it felt like they could fade into the night sky at any moment. \u201cWhy wake up so suddenly? How good would it have been to not come.\u201dYue Zhishi froze for a second before understanding that Song Yu meant him. Within Song Yu\u2019s expectations, Yue Zhishi should\u2019ve laid in his warm bed in the apartment and slept all the way to morning. And as he was immersed in his dreams, Song Yu would\u2019ve proactively come clean to his parents, bearing everything himself.He almost didn\u2019t dare imagine that possibility \u2014 because Song Yu would\u2019ve definitely packaged him as a perfect victim, would\u2019ve described their difficult love for each other as a simple count of deceit.\u201cI needed to come.\u201d Yue Zhishi lifted a hand and stroked Song Yu\u2019s face. The moonlight crossed over Song Yu\u2019s shoulders, landing into his pale coloured eyes.\u201cSong Yu, I wouldn\u2019t leave you to face these things by yourself.\u201dThe palm of his hand was very hot, carrying a real and existing warmth.Song Yu fit their lips together, giving Yue Zhishi a peaceful and brief kiss as though it was already all of himself. He gripped Yue Zhishi so tightly it felt like he wanted to absorb him into his body. In the past, Song Yu would\u2019ve never hugged him like this; he\u2019d always been gentle, giving Yue Zhishi an endless sense of security.But tonight, it felt like he\u2019d returned back to four years ago, five years ago \u2014 or maybe even earlier.He turned back into that young boy who\u2019d had his desires cut off from the moment his feelings had begun to sprout. They hadn\u2019t even been given the chance to grow; he\u2019d seen his ending at first glance. The past him and the current him pleaded using the same body, unable to release their arms, unable to let go of the person they loved.Song Yu and Yue Zhishi\u2019s bodies were sealed together with no gaps in between, as though this way, they couldn\u2019t be separated.\u201cWe\u2019ve really been terrible, haven\u2019t we.\u201d Yue Zhishi\u2019s voice was very low, pulling in difficult breaths of air between words. All the things that had happened that night floated in front of his eyes like scenes pushed into his brain from a broken projector, unable to be turned off.Since Song Yu didn\u2019t respond, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cIf you\u2019d known earlier what would happen today, would you still want me to fall in love with you earlier?\u201dThe earlier they loved each other, the earlier they would\u2019ve lied.\u201cYes.\u201d This time, Song Yu gave an answer very quickly.He held Yue Zhishi, voice slightly raspy. \u201cI wanted you so much I almost went crazy.\u201dHearing this response, Yue Zhishi could only feel his heart stinging. He buried his face into Song Yu\u2019s collarbones. \u201cI wish I had too.\u201dSong Yu rubbed his nape, quietly asking him why.\u201cSo you would\u2019ve known earlier that the only person who would\u2019ve received your letter was you.\u201dYue Zhishi weakly laughed. \u201cI would\u2019ve also known earlier that all the plans I created would be wasted. As long as you love me and need me, I won\u2019t be able to leave you.\u201dIn his letter prepared ahead of time, Song Yu had written \u2018please don\u2019t leave him by himself\u2019, yet Yue Zhishi had prepared ahead of time a plan for all the possibilities of him living by himself.If he\u2019d fallen in love earlier, they could\u2019ve destroyed each other\u2019s painful, hidden secrets.Song Yu was most likely the only person in the world who\u2019d been conscious of the shortcomings in Yue Zhishi\u2019s personality, and yet he hadn\u2019t dared to write them into his letter. He even stressed, \u2018he has no shortcomings\u2019.But Yue Zhishi actually did \u2014 he was very afraid of separation, as well as overly keen to please. In order for Song Yu to be happy and satisfied, Yue Zhishi could do anything.He treated everyone else the same way, whether deeply or lightly.\u201cLe Le.\u201d Song Yu raised up Yue Zhishi\u2019s face and met his eyes. That pair of deep and profound eyes seemed to almost pierce through Yue Zhishi\u2019s mask and see clearly into his inner heart. \u201cOther than me, Dad, Mom, your friends, the people who adore you \u2014 there are so many people who love you. And they love you without asking for anything in return.\u201dYue Zhishi focused on him, a shining layer of moisture growing in his eyes. But he was very stubborn; he refused to blink.\u201cBaobao.\u201d Song Yu tenderly stroked his face. \u201cLove doesn\u2019t need to be returned. It\u2019s what you deserve.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not a child without a home. Your home is here. If you really did leave, they might spend their entire lives here waiting and hoping for your return. And just like what Dad said, they would cook so many of the dishes you love, waiting for you to come home and eat.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s eyes remained fixed on him, but his eyelashes were faintly trembling.His stomach felt painful, and so did his throat. So many emotions were surging.Frowning, Yue Zhishi couldn\u2019t hold back from asking, \u201cThen what about you?\u201dSong Yu smiled with his pale face, his palm coming to rest on the side of Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. The pads of his fingers gently rubbed against Yue Zhishi\u2019s drawn eyebrows.\u201cI would go look for you. All of the good cities in this world \u2014 I would look through all of them.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d have a hard time finding me.\u201d Yue Zhishi pressed his lips together, lowering his eyes.The look in Song Yu\u2019s eyes was very tender. \u201cHave you forgotten the hide and seek we used to play as kids?\u201dAs long as Song Yu searched through each room and called out Yue Zhishi\u2019s name once he arrived at where he\u2019d hidden himself, the tiny Yue Zhishi would rush impatiently out to see him, begging for Song Yu to carry him. He\u2019d even say, gege, how are you so amazing, you found me so easily.\u201cIf you missed me, you\u2019d come out.\u201dYue Zhishi knit his eyebrows together, looking as though he was struggling to hold back his emotions. In the end, he couldn\u2019t help but nod and wrap his arms around Song Yu.The small stray dog, having planned to continue living his life well, would be very careful when crossing the road. He\u2019d look for a place to hide when it rained, and would do his best to find things to eat for himself \u2014 because he no longer had food and shelter.Perhaps he would continuously return back to the park he\u2019d used to be taken to and search for the lawn he\u2019d used to run across, secretly sniffing the familiar fragrance of the grass.What was so hard about living by himself?He was only afraid that if his past owner showed up once more, he would forget everything in his joy and run straight into his arms.Song Yu\u2019s arms were forever his safest refuge \u2014 they were the only place to which Yue Zhishi felt like he belonged.There was no need for payment or exchange. He belonged to him.They embraced each other, using each other\u2019s bodies to keep warm. But neither of them dared to ask, dared to think if their parents would accept them \u2014 they could only huddle into each other to pass these dark hours. Yue Zhishi was worried Song Yu wouldn\u2019t sleep well, so he too didn\u2019t sleep well the entire night. Hazily dreaming that Song Yu had left, he startled awake; when he realised Song Yu was still sleeping next to him, a hand on his shoulder, only then did Yue Zhishi release a breath, ease into him and continue sleeping.He did that several times, and when the sky started to lighten, he finally couldn\u2019t keep sleeping anymore. He opened his eyes and stared at Song Yu\u2019s face for a very long time, helping him flatten out those frowning eyebrows. His throat was hurting and he really wanted to cough, but he was worried he\u2019d wake Song Yu \u2014 and so Yue Zhishi got out of bed with light movements and went to the bathroom to cough.His reflection in the mirror looked thin and haggard, his face pale as paper yet his lips were flushed red from his fever. Yue Zhishi cleaned up a bit, his throat still uncomfortable, and felt like it was hard to breathe. But his heart was still anxious and restless; he only wanted to see how Song Jin and Lin Rong were sleeping.But they seemed to have woken up even earlier \u2014 Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t even gotten to the living room after going downstairs when he heard the very low sounds of the news of the television, as well as the sounds of them talking.Yue Zhishi hid behind the staircase and quietly stood there. Lin Rong\u2019s vague voice was the tiniest bit crisp, like the daylight of early morning.\u201cCan you still not tell? The two of them can\u2019t be separated at all. They\u2019re not the same as those young people who\u2019ve just started dating \u2014 their relationship\u2019s already very deep.\u201d\u201cBut what if one day\u2026\u201dTears once again appeared in Lin Rong\u2019s voice. \u201cDon\u2019t say what if anymore\u2026 I was in so much pain last night. I couldn\u2019t sleep, so I went to Xiao Yu\u2019s room to see if they were sleeping. Do you know? They were sleeping with their arms tightly around each other, just like little babies particularly worried about losing each other.\u201d\u201cIf we force them away from each other now for a future we don\u2019t know when will arrive, then I\u2019ll have lost both my sons.\u201dShe softly sobbed, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care what other people think, I just want them to live well, to be happy everyday\u2026 Xiao Yu, he, he\u2019s stifled everything in his heart for so many years. Isn\u2019t it because of this? My son can\u2019t sleep at night, and yet as a mother, I didn\u2019t even know.\u201dYue Zhishi drew in a deep, deep breath, but it felt like he couldn\u2019t quite move his body. All the intense emotions from last night had loaded down his body too much. He felt a bit weak, and he leaned back against the staircase as he listened to their voices.He heard Song Jin say with remorse, \u201cBut I keep feeling very apologetic to Yue Yi. It feels like I haven\u2019t taught our children well, haven\u2019t led them down the right path, which is why they\u2026\u201d\u201cIf Yue Yi really was still alive, he would also want Le Le to be happy. He\u2019d want Le Le to be together with the person he likes. Weren\u2019t we the same back then? My dad didn\u2019t allow us to be together and was determined to force me into marry someone else. Have you forgotten how much you suffered back then?\u201dSeeing Song Jin\u2019s eyebrows tightly drawn together, not speaking, Lin Rong sighed. \u201cI thought all night about why Le Le would want to leave. Maybe it was because he\u2019s felt like he didn\u2019t have a family since he was a child. Even though we treat him well, he still isn\u2019t our true born son \u2014 and later, after he fell in love with Song Yu, he felt like he hadn\u2019t lived up to our care. He was scared of us throwing him out, which was why he kept thinking he should leave first\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s definitely why.\u201d She repeated painfully, \u201cMy Le Le would only want to leave because of that.\u201dThe more she thought about it, the more pain she felt. \u201cDon\u2019t bother them anymore, isn\u2019t it fine just like this? It\u2019s not like they\u2019ve committed some unforgivable crime. They\u2019re not true brothers anyway. If other people want to talk about them, then let them talk. People live for a lifetime \u2014 we don\u2019t live for the sake of other people\u2019s mouths.\u201dSilence for a few seconds, and then Song Jin helplessly sighed. \u201cThen so be it.\u201dHe said again, \u201cWe might not be used to it in the beginning, but we can\u2019t show it. We can\u2019t hurt the children.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2019d you steal what I was going to say,\u201d Lin Rong grumbled before using a tissue to wipe away her tears. \u201cSeriously. Hurry and throw away the cigarettes you haven\u2019t smoked. Don\u2019t smoke anymore, Le Le\u2019s going to cough if he smells it.\u201dThe words had just left her mouth when she thought something didn\u2019t feel quite right \u2014 she felt like she heard the sounds of someone struggling to breathe. She flew off the sofa, followed the sounds of the breathing and found Yue Zhishi collapsed on the floor behind the circular staircase.\u201cLe Le!\u201d Lin Rong half picked up Yue Zhishi, who had his face covered with tears as his asthma flared up. She urgently called out Song Jin\u2019s name, saying, \u201cHurry and bring his inhaler!\u201dSong Yu came downstairs as Yue Zhishi was using the inhaler. When he saw Yue Zhishi on the floor, he immediately rushed down to his side.His fever and overly heightened emotions triggering his asthma, Yue Zhishi remained weak and feeble even after using the inhaler. The entire family brought him to the hospital. Yue Zhishi silently slept on the hospital bed, and the ice-cold IV drip flowed down the plastic tube, trickling into his veins.Lin Rong sat next to him, both her hands wrapped around one of Yue Zhishi\u2019s \u2014 she cried in front of his bed, just like she used to when he\u2019d gotten sick as a child.Song Jin told Song Yu to come outside with him and took him to the window at the very end of the hospital corridor. He didn\u2019t look like the exhausted father from last night, about to grow old over the span of one night \u2014 his emotions had steadied, and with a respectable suit on, he slightly recovered his usual gentle and elegant air.But the question he asked was very direct, very clear, as though he was calculating how big of a mistake his own son had committed.\u201cYou and Le Le \u2014 how far have you guys gone?\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t hide a single thing, honestly saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything.\u201d\u201cDid you ask for it?\u201dSong Yu lowered his eyes. \u201cI asked for it.\u201d\u201cYou, Song Yu\u2026\u201d Song Jin struggled to hold back his emotions. \u201cLe Le\u2019s so young\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take responsibility.\u201d Raising his eyes, Song Yu looked towards him. \u201cDad, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been a bad child after growing up for so many years. But I\u2019ve never promised you anything.\u201dHis gaze was very steady. \u201cBut I can promise you, there\u2019ll be no one else in this world who will love Le Le the way I do. There won\u2019t be.\u201dSong Jin turned his face away, unable to refute Song Yu\u2019s words.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for hiding from you for all these years.\u201d Song Yu used soft words he almost never would use. \u201cI won\u2019t ask for you guys to forgive me or to accept me. I only hope that you won\u2019t blame him. He really does care a lot about your feelings.\u201dSong Jin looked out the window. Cold wind was blowing at the hospital lawn, pushing and shaking off the crumbling tree leaves \u2014 as well as a pair of birds, clinging together.He was silent for a long time, and then he shook his head. In the end, he only said to Song Yu, \u201cTake care of him well. Don\u2019t let down your uncle.\u201dA moment later, Song Yu solemnly nodded. His father spoke again.\u201cLast time when I asked you in Yanghe Qizhe\u2019s courtyard how you\u2019ve been recently, you said you\u2019ve been quite well, that you\u2019ve been really happy everyday. I\u2019ve always remembered it, because it felt like it wasn\u2019t something you would say. I thought you really did come across something good and became really happy. Now that I think about, I can understand why you said what you did.\u201d\u201cSince the two of you are together now, be happy.\u201d He looked at Song Yu. \u201cAs parents, we only wish for your happiness.\u201dAnd then, he said it was cold outside and told Song Yu to head back in and take a leave of absence for Yue Zhishi. He walked downstairs by himself to buy some fruit.After calling the university, Song Yu went back to the hospital room. He saw Lin Rong wrapping her thumb and index finger around Yue Zhishi\u2019s wrist, measuring it, and she frowned in worry at his narrow wrist. When she saw Song Yu come in, she sighed; her tightly pressed lips were quivering slightly.Walking over, Song Yu grabbed a chair and sat next to her. He pulled her into his arms.This pair of mother and son was particularly strange \u2014 Song Yu could think of one hundred different ways to bicker with Lin Rong, but he couldn\u2019t speak to her about the words he\u2019d hidden in his heart. It felt like they were separated by a long distance, yet with just a hug, Lin Rong\u2019s stubbornly cold front would crumble.She pushed and shoved at her son\u2019s embrace, and even reached out to hit him \u2014 but she didn\u2019t dare hit too heavily, and she also didn\u2019t dare to cry out, in case she disturbed Yue Zhishi. She could only shake her head again and again, as though admitting defeat.Hearing Song Yu ask for forgiveness, the pain in her heart rose once again.What was there to forgive? It wasn\u2019t as though he\u2019d actually done something wrong.She sniffled. Not wanting to open her mouth, she could only pull out her phone.Not long after, Song Yu\u2019s phone vibrated.[Ms Lin: You\u2019re not allowed to think and imagine random things anymore. You need to rest and need to come home more often. Or else I\u2019ll take Le Le and leave together.]Song Yu actually smiled, seeing that message.In the tranquil hospital room, their voices turned into written words, but the tone and feelings within them were still accurately and precisely delivered to the other person\u2019s heart.[Xiao Yu: Take me and Dad along too. We\u2019ll carry your bags.]The indicator on the chat screen kept changing, switching from \u2018currently typing\u2019 to nothing and then back again. After many, many cycles, only then did Song Yu receive his mother\u2019s reply.[Ms Lin: You\u2019ll carry them yourself.][Ms Lin: The entire family\u2019s bags.]The author has something to say:Yanghe Qizhe (\u9633\u548c\u542f\u86f0): A metaphor for the end of bad times and the start of a beautiful, smooth-sailing life. Found in the\u00a0History of the Song Dynasty: Annals of Music.(Yes, the real Song Dynasty poetry records)The lines of the original poem described spring: \u201cAnd thus the winds respond, refreshing the seasons and the year. The warmth of spring awakens those hibernating from winter, and everything returns to spring.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After the doctor checked him over, he believed that other than the fever, Yue Zhishi\u2019s asthma had been mainly triggered by depression and anxiety.\u201cHe can\u2019t get so emotional. He\u2019s been ill for so many years, you guys should know this by now.\u201d As he completed Yue Zhishi\u2019s medical notes, the doctor said to Song Jin and Lin Rong, \u201cHis nails were still blue from cyanosis when he arrived, it must\u2019ve been a severe attack. As his parents, you should care more for your child\u2019s psychological health. When it comes to an illness like asthma, having a healthy mind is sometimes even more important than having a healthy body.\u201dThe two of them continuously nodded. At hearing the word \u2018depression\u2019, Lin Rong\u2019s heart squeezed with pain \u2014 no matter how hard she imagined it, she couldn\u2019t link Yue Zhishi together with that word.Yue Zhishi stayed in the hospital, and Lin Rong didn\u2019t open her restaurant over those next few days. She stayed with him every day and almost never went home; she slept on the small pull out bed in his room at night. Whenever Song Yu came by to switch shifts with her, she would rush him back to campus to finish his graduation thesis.It was as though they\u2019d returned back to the past, Yue Zhishi more than familiar with these scenes. Lin Rong would chat to him while steadily slicing up fruit: apples and pears were turned into bunnies, pineapples into small fans, and even pomelos were peeled. She\u2019d fill up a plate of fruit and then place it in front of Yue Zhishi with a tiny fork.Because Lin Rong had been with him, he hadn\u2019t hated living in the hospital as a child. He\u2019d only disliked the smell of it.Lin Rong used to watch anime together with Yue Zhishi in his hospital room, but Yue Zhishi had liked watching shounen series. Lin Rong had kept picking at the emotional storylines, occasionally asking him, this guy and this girl are a couple, right? Do they like each other?And as a child, Yue Zhishi had replied very solemnly, they don\u2019t have the time to date, they need to get stronger.The current Yue Zhishi more often than not would watch television dramas with Lin Rong. She\u2019d gasp and sigh in appreciation like a young girl whenever she saw something exciting, and then she\u2019d say to Yue Zhishi, your Uncle Song\u2019s not so flirty and showy, but he\u2019s still very gentle.For the few days he stayed in the hospital, an idol drama just so happened to be broadcasting. They\u2019d often watch in his room, snacking.When the male lead manufactured a surprise for the female lead, Lin Rong bit a sweet potato fry in half and then held onto the remainder as she asked Yue Zhishi, her eyes focused on the television \u2014\u201cIs your brother romantic?\u201dShe asked that question as naturally as though she was complaining about Uncle Song.But Yue Zhishi froze; they\u2019d cracked open their hearts and had spoken about many things over the last two days, but they\u2019d very tacitly evaded away from the details of Yue Zhishi and Song Yu\u2019s relationship. Yue Zhishi had been scared of hurting Lin Rong.He didn\u2019t expect Lin Rong to suddenly ask about it, and even thought he\u2019d misheard.Seeing there was no response from Yue Zhishi, Lin Rong turned her face around and looked at him, the words\u00a0I knew it\u00a0written over her face. \u201cHe\u2019s not very good at dating, is he?\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s face was somewhat burning, and he started to stammer, \u201cAh, I\u2026 gege, he\u2026\u201dLin Rong chuckled. \u201cLook at how scared you are. Does he bully you? If he does, you have to tell me.\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d Yue Zhishi was so flustered he almost flipped over the plate of fruit on his blanket. He hurriedly caught hold of it, and then he explained to Lin Rong, ears hot, \u201cGege\u2019s really good, he\u2019s particularly tender and really romantic\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Lin Rong looked extremely curious. \u201cI can\u2019t tell at all!\u201dIt was as though Yue Zhishi had received a bit of encouragement when he saw the look on her face, and he hunted for evidence that could convince Lin Rong. \u201cIt\u2019s true, gege\u2019s really romantic. He\u2019ll always bring me back a small gift every time he goes out for field work.\u201d\u201cDoes he?\u201d Lin Rong nodded. \u201cWorthy of being my son. What kind of presents has he given you?\u201d\u201cStones.\u201d Yue Zhishi then added, \u201cVery expensive stones.\u201dLin Rong chortled, finding the whole thing even funnier when she saw Yue Zhishi\u2019s clueless face. \u201cDarling, only you. Anyone else wouldn\u2019t find Song Yu romantic.\u201dYue Zhishi quickly blinked a few times, doing his best to argue. \u201cAunt Rong, the stones he\u2019s given me really are super pretty. He found them himself, I\u2019ll bring them back for you to see next time. He\u2019s also given me sunflowers, and every time I need him, he\u2019s always by my side.\u201d\u201cI think instead of finding stones, he\u2019s found a treasure.\u201d Lin Rong finished the second half of her fry. \u201cWell, to be more precise, his dad found one for him.\u201dAn ad started to play on the television. Lin Rong was about to change the channel when she heard Yue Zhishi say, \u201cAnd there won\u2019t be anyone else like gege who\u2019d write a letter like that\u2026\u201dLin Rong\u2019s hand, holding the remote, paused, and her pain once again stung with pain. She was quiet for a few moments, and then she said, faintly smiling, \u201cThat\u2019s true. Only someone who really loves you would do something like that. Especially someone like your brother, who hadn\u2019t lacked anything since he was born \u2014 it would\u2019ve been very difficult for him to truly want something. But once he did, it would\u2019ve also been very hard for him to let go. He\u2019s already done his best to restrain himself, I know\u2026\u201dShe turned her face to him and stroked Yue Zhishi\u2019s hair. \u201cI must\u2019ve really hurt you in the past when I kept talking about him finding a girlfriend.\u201dYue Zhishi shook his head subconsciously, but Lin Rong wasn\u2019t deceived.\u201cI wasn\u2019t actually hoping for anything to happen, I just thought he was too lonely.\u201d Lin Rong gave him a smile. \u201cBut now, I can relax.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Yue Zhishi said with some difficulty, \u201cWe can\u2019t get married, and we can\u2019t have\u2026\u201dWithout waiting for him to finish, Lin Rong carelessly said, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you get married? We can hold a wedding ceremony in Yanghe Qizhe\u2019s courtyard. And a marriage certificate\u2019s just a piece of paper, back then, your dad and I, ah no\u2026\u201d Her tongue slipped, and so she quickly corrected herself, \u201cYour Uncle Song and I, we ran away and eloped. Your dad drove us to a small park, and it was just the three of us when we got married. He was our witness, and he recited a bunch of random things from a ridiculously wrinkled piece of paper. We even borrowed money from your dad to buy our wedding rings.\u201dLin Rong lowered her head and chuckled. \u201cSeriously, I feared nothing back then either, only knowing to run away with Song Jin. We wanted to register our marriage but didn\u2019t have our household registration booklets, so Yue Yi just wrote us one. When we finally registered our marriage much later, it didn\u2019t feel all that interesting \u2014 I preferred the one your dad wrote.\u201dAs he listened to Lin Rong, Yue Zhishi felt like he could see those scenes. He was wistful, wanting to see how his father had looked like back then.\u201cSo it\u2019s not important.\u201d Lin Rong returned back to their conversation. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t want to take care of children anyway, I\u2019ll become a grandma if you have kids. I don\u2019t want to think about it.\u201d She touched her own face. \u201cI still feel very young. I don\u2019t want to be a grandma.\u201dYue Zhishi laughed at her words.\u201cBut later, when your lives have settled down\u2026\u201d Lin Rong touched his arm. \u201cYou can adopt. There are too many pitiful children in this world. Adopting one can mean saving them.\u201dYue Zhishi dropped his eyes, complicated emotions in his heart. He\u2019d imagined many different kinds of scenarios in the past about what would happen after coming clean to Song Yu\u2019s parents and hadn\u2019t expected many good ones; he had never imagined actually sitting here, listening to Lin Rong\u2019s teasing and comforting \u2014 let alone listening to her as she helped them plan out the rest of their lives.Placing the plate aside, he shifted over and affectionately leaned on Lin Rong\u2019s shoulder. He hugged her, his movements filled with trust. Lin Rong returned his hug, the warm and gentle fragrance of her perfume wrapping around Yue Zhishi; she said to him, her voice full of love, \u201cBe happy together with your brother. He really loves you and can\u2019t be away from you. We know that now.\u201d\u201cWe really love you too, so don\u2019t think about leaving us anymore, okay?\u201dYue Zhishi nodded and said, okay. After a very long time, he said through a block in his throat, \u201cAunt Rong, I can\u2019t be away from you either. I really love you and Uncle, too.\u201dIt was always hard to talk about love between family.On one hand, it felt too serious; on the other hand, it felt too dramatic. It felt like life should be a bit more down to earth, like the steady footsteps continuously moving forward and landing firmly on the ground. But threaded throughout the three meals in a day, the four seasons in a year \u2014 echoes of love were etched into each and every passing moment.Song Yu come over towards nightfall, and since Lin Rong needed to head back to take Cotton Candy and Orange to a physical examination, they changed shifts.There was no one else in the single hospital room. Song Yu came in with a bouquet of flowers, closing the door very lightly, and saw Yue Zhishi sitting on the bed with his earbuds in and completing his coursework on his laptop. The aircon in the room was turned to a very warm temperature, and his wan, slender neck peeked out from his baggy hospital gown. His brown hair, now grown out to his chin, was half tied up behind his head with only wisps of soft hair falling onto his faceHe was typing softly, and his lips were pursed up as he concentrated \u2014 he looked so adorable.Pulling out a\u00a0white avalanche rose, Song Yu threw it onto the bed. It fell right into Yue Zhishi\u2019s arms, and he stared in a bit of confusion at the flower that\u2019d suddenly appeared. Yue Zhishi picked it up and turned to look at the door, puzzled; he only then saw Song Yu, who was wearing a plaid coat with no glasses, a gentle curl to his lips and a large bouquet of white flowers in his hand.Yue Zhishi tilted his head and gave him a smile. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to go to a wedding.\u201dSong Yu walked over to him and gave Yue Zhishi the flowers. As though he was explaining something, he said, \u201cOnly these few flowers looked nice in the shop. I just bought them randomly.\u201dExcept they didn\u2019t look random at all. Light-coloured gauze was wrapped around snow white roses,\u00a0cream Persian buttercups, freesias and\u00a0baby\u2019s-breaths \u2014\u00a0 it looked so much like a wedding bouquet, and it very much matched the white coloured hospital room. Yue Zhishi really liked it, and so he reached out to stroke Song Yu\u2019s wrist, only to have his own hand caught.His head lowered, Song Yu delicately rubbed a finger over the bruise on the back of Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand from the IV needle, and then he interlocked their fingers together.\u201cI have good news and even better news. Which one would you like to hear?\u201d\u201cThe good one,\u201d Yue Zhishi said without a single bit of hesitation. \u201cThe even better one should come last.\u201dHolding his hand, Song Yu said, \u201cI don\u2019t need to push back my graduation anymore. Professor Zhang promised to not block me from graduating because of personal matters and will let me proceed as usual. I also don\u2019t need to work in his research group anymore, I\u2019ve officially moved into Professor He\u2019s group.\u201dYue Zhishi was so happy he threw his arms around Song Yu and then clutched his arms. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic! I\u2019ve been so worried about your graduation. Now everything\u2019s going to be fine, and you won\u2019t have to change your thesis topic either.\u201d But he was still a bit doubtful. \u201cWhy did Professor Zhang suddenly change his mind?\u201d\u201cZhang Siyun helped.\u201d Song Yu smoothed a hand down Yue Zhishi\u2019s back. \u201cShe found him so despicable after hearing Old Zhang was pressuring me with my graduation, so she threatened him by saying she was going to go back to the United States. She also took back her right to date and marry whoever she wants.\u201dYue Zhishi let out a soft \u2018wow\u2019, admiration in his voice. \u201cWhat a woman.\u201d\u201cAnd she found someone new to date at the speed of light.\u201d Song Yu gave a simple description. \u201cAn overseas student from Spain.\u201dYue Zhishi said \u2018wow\u2019 again, his eyes brightening, only to have Song Yu brusquely say, \u201cWhat are you so excited about?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not excited.\u201d\u201cYour eyes are glowing.\u201d Song Yu raised an eyebrow.Yue Zhishi leaned onto his body and then softly explained to him in a voice still slightly clogged up from the flu, \u201cI was just curious about what he looked like\u2026\u201d\u201cNot as good-looking as you, so don\u2019t bother.\u201d Song Yu took the flowers he\u2019d given him and put them onto the table before tugging up Yue Zhishi\u2019s blanket.\u201cAnd the other piece of news?\u201d Yue Zhishi hadn\u2019t forgotten, and he grabbed Song Yu\u2019s sleeve. \u201cThe even better one.\u201dSong Yu also pushed his hand underneath the blanket. The twilight colours of early winter filtered through the glass window and turned Yue Zhishi\u2019s skin almost transparent. The fine, downy hair on his face was faintly visible, while his pair of light brown eyes was like amber, bright and clear.\u201cDad took me yesterday to clean Uncle Yue\u2019s tombstone.\u201dHe may have called it a tombstone, but in reality it was only a cenotaph, an empty tomb. Song Jin had placed Yue Yi and his wife\u2019s tombstones next to the Yue parents who\u2019d passed away much earlier. Worried Yue Zhishi would be distressed, they\u2019d taken him there very rarely, but the Song couple visited at least twice a year and would tell them of any good news. The tombstones were like tree holes, never replying.Yue Zhishi softly hummed, and so Song Yu continued, \u201cDad told Uncle and Auntie about us.\u201dAs a father, Song Jin had represented his own son and apologised to his two deceased friends; he\u2019d also given them a promise, saying he would watch over Song Yu and would make sure Song Yu loved and protected Yue Zhishi well.\u201cDad even reminded Uncle Yue,\u201d Song Yu relayed, \u201csaying that when Olivia was pregnant, Uncle Yue had even joked about doing a childhood betrothal between you and me if you ended up as a girl, that having me as a son-in-law would\u2019ve definitely been something fantastic for him. Dad said to Uncle Yue that perhaps some things hadn\u2019t turned out the way they\u2019d expected, but Xiao Yu was now even more outstanding compared to when he was younger \u2014 and he hoped Uncle Yue could accept me.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s eyes started to burn as he listened, but he also found it slightly funny. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you can say stuff like that with a straight face. You even complimented yourself without finding it embarrassing.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just passing along what Dad said, I didn\u2019t add anything extra.\u201d Song Yu squeezed his hand. \u201cDo you know what I was thinking when Dad was saying that?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Yue Zhishi gazed at him.\u201cWhen you were still in your mom\u2019s stomach, you were already engaged to me.\u201dYue Zhishi said somewhat self-consciously, \u201cYou\u2019re making things up now. Uncle was talking about child betrothal.\u201dSong Yu arched his eyebrows indifferently. \u201cSame thing. In any case, you were already mine when you were just an embryo.\u201dThe words of \u2018shamelessly boasting\u2019 suited Song Yu all too well, Yue Zhishi thought.\u201cI\u2019m starting to think you called this news as \u2018even better\u2019 simply just to praise yourself and exaggerate.\u201dSong Yu shook his head and also pinched Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand. \u201cNo. Since Dad was willing to take me there, that means he\u2019s already accepted us and hopes Uncle and Auntie can accept us too. He said, even though there\u2019s no way to control how other people look at us, at least we can have the blessings of our parents.\u201dAs he spoke, hints of pain appeared on Song Yu\u2019s face. \u201cHe even said, after watching your clothing competition last time, he and Mom went home that night and watched\u00a0Brokeback Mountain. Both of them were so hurt, especially when they later learned about us \u2014 they kept thinking of the final scenes of the movie.\u201dAnd then, he touched the back of Yue Zhishi\u2019s hand with his lips, his kiss landing on the same spot as that broken vein. \u201cWe\u2019re very lucky.\u201dYue Zhishi nodded.Underneath dense and heavy clouds, they\u2019d pulled out unsteady, unreliable sweetness in advance, expecting the arrival of the storm \u2014 only to have ended up waiting for a shower of fine rain, the moisture falling as mutely as their parents\u2019 soundless devotion.What Song Yu didn\u2019t say was, in front of Yue Yi and Olivia\u2019s tombs, he\u2019d selfishly changed the way he called them \u2014 he\u2019d silently called them\u00a0mom\u00a0and\u00a0dad.And because of how much he\u2019d liked the idea of a childhood betrothal, he\u2019d specifically chosen a bouquet that looked like wedding flowers.He had later felt very absurd after doing all those things, and he wasn\u2019t willing to let Yue Zhishi know \u2014 so along with many other small things sealed away, he locked them and placed them to rest in his quiet heart.The day Yue Zhishi left the hospital, the weather was spectacular. Jiang Yufan brought over a hot red bean milk tea.\u201cEh? Didn\u2019t Shen Mi say he was coming too?\u201d Yue Zhishi poked a straw in and drank a large mouthful.\u201cHa, he\u2019s currently being pestered by that journalism guy.\u201d Jiang Yufan shivered from the cold. \u201cThe one who was in the competition with you \u2014 soft skin, baby face, short.\u201dYue Zhishi\u2019s eyes shot wide open. \u201cXu Lin? With Shen Mi??\u201d\u201cYep. I think he watched a basketball game where Shen Mi played especially well, and then he started to look for Shen Mi every day. It\u2019s fine if he was just looking for him, but he\u2019s so haughty, he really knows how to pull out excuses. One moment he\u2019ll have printed out a bunch of news surveys for Shen Mi to answer, and then the next moment he\u2019ll come and ask Shen Mi to do some volunteer work. He comes around every day.\u201dYue Zhishi could imagine it, and he couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cDo you think Xu Lin likes Shen Mi?\u201d Jiang Yufan rubbed a hand over his newly cut hair.A bit surprised, Yue Zhishi asked, \u201cYou\u2026 You can tell?\u201d\u201cMy girlfriend said it, she even said they match pretty well.\u201d Jiang Yufan giggled. \u201cI just think they\u2019re really funny, they have a love-hate relationship. It\u2019ll be so rowdy if they really get together.\u201dJiang Yufan spoke easily, as relaxed as when he\u2019d heard Yue Zhishi explain his vision for his final closing show outfit. He\u2019d only encouraged him without thinking, saying he was amazing, and hadn\u2019t questioned him further.Yue Zhishi suddenly realised: all of the people around him were particularly tolerant.Perhaps after the heavens had snatched away his father whom everyone had loved, they had tried to desperately make it up to him \u2014 using this.And even though gifts couldn\u2019t be used to offset the gap in his life, they each had their own joy and beauty.Once he returned back to school, Yue Zhishi\u2019s days weren\u2019t too different from before. He was busy studying every day, and he would even occasionally bump into Xu Lin during general education classes as he clung around Shen Mi, the name \u2018Mixed Sweetheart\u2019 still falling from his mouth.But what was different from before was that he and Song Yu now went home every weekend. Time and love healed everything, and the small pieces of awkwardness that had existed between everyone after they\u2019d just come out were gradually smoothened out. The changing of identities didn\u2019t bring in a sense of distance \u2014 rather, it meshed them together even tighter. Lin Rong even thought she\u2019d obtained a magical weapon to face Song Yu\u2019s ridicule: Yue Zhishi.\u201cMuch more useful than Song Jin,\u201d Lin Rong said with utter delight as she hugged Yue Zhishi in her arms.But Yue Zhishi\u2019s heart was still pounding slightly from nervousness. To be honest, he was actually still very afraid of Song Yu.Christmas was rapidly arriving, and they\u2019d ordered a massive Christmas tree this year as well as too many decorations. The tree had yet to arrive, so they could only temporarily pause the plan of decorating it with everyone.There was still a very important basketball game before the holidays. Song Jin really wanted to watch it, so he adopted a roundabout tactic and said, \u201cXiao Rong, didn\u2019t you say you were searching for photo albums this afternoon? Let\u2019s look at them together, we haven\u2019t gone through them in years.\u201dLin Rong immediately stood up. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I found one.\u201d Running to the storage room, she grabbed an extremely thick, extremely large old album and sat next to Song Yu and Le Le on the rug. Song Yu was playing games on his phone and so didn\u2019t really look at it, but it caught Yue Zhishi\u2019s attention. He\u2019d originally had his chin on Song Yu\u2019s shoulder as he watched him game, but as soon as Lin Rong sat down, he turned around to face her.\u201cWow, I was too funny as a kid. My hair was so curly.\u201dSong Yu glanced over, the corners of his mouth unconsciously curving up in amusement.\u201cYou were super cute back then, I was always surrounded whenever I took you out.\u201d Focused on showing Yue Zhishi photos, Lin Rong was no longer watching the television, as expected \u2014 Song Jin turned on the livestream to the basketball game in satisfaction, occasionally looking over at the album and providing a few comments.\u201cLook at this!\u201d As though he found a treasure, Yue Zhishi hefted up the album in front of Song Yu and patted his shoulder to ask him to look. \u201cGege, look, you as a kid!\u201dHearing Lin Rong\u2019s uncontrollable laughter, Song Yu knew it wouldn\u2019t be anything good. He threw a glance over in curiosity and only just managed to not roll his eyes.\u201cHow boring.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s boring? You were so cute, that was my favourite lipstick.\u201d Lin Rong sighed with emotion. \u201cYour brother was cuter as a child, wasn\u2019t he, Le Le? You could put makeup on him.\u201dYue Zhishi kept looking at that photo with a young Song Yu wearing lipstick and blue eyeshadow; the more he looked at it, the more he found Song Yu adorable.\u201cI don\u2019t think you should laugh at me.\u201d Song Yu stared at his phone, his character in the game using a magnifying glass from up high to search for enemies. He mildly said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times you were forced into a dress as a child.\u201d\u201cDress??\u201d Yue Zhishi was shocked.Song Yu swiftly downed one enemy, coolly letting out a \u2018mn\u2019. \u201cShe dressed you up as a little princess, the type of princess where Disney would send over a letter from their lawyers if they saw.\u201dWhat kind of description was that, Yue Zhishi silently scoffed.Lin Rong was focused on something else. \u201cWhat do you mean, forced? Le Le cooperated with me so nicely, he was super happy to wear a dress. He didn\u2019t even make a fuss when I was putting wigs on him, and he also really enjoyed wearing shiny lipgloss.\u201dA complicated look was all over Yue Zhishi\u2019s face. \u201cReally\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Lin Rong copied the way he\u2019d spoken as a child as she said, \u201cYou even asked me, Auntie Rong Rong, am I pretty?\u201dSong Yu flicked an eyebrow.Yue Zhishi didn\u2019t believe them, flipping through the photos. \u201cBut there aren\u2019t any photos here, are you guys sure you\u2019re remembering correctly?\u201dLin Rong said, \u201cThere\u2019s one missing from the albums at home. I\u2019ve looked for it before, but I still haven\u2019t found it \u2014 I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s gone even though it should be at home.\u201dThe safe area in Song Yu\u2019s game had now shrunk to its smallest, entering its final moments.\u201cXiao Yu, have you seen it? There\u2019s still one more album, and it has photos of Le Le wearing princess dresses.\u201d\u201cI have it.\u201d Song Yu was fighting fiercely, and the words slipped out before without him realising.\u201cYou have it? When\u2019d you take it, why didn\u2019t I know?\u201dThe matched ended, Song Yu showing Yue Zhishi the celebratory screen of chicken dinner. Cotton Candy jumped into Song Yu\u2019s lap with a small toy in his mouth, and he was a bit confused at what was happening. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhy do you have Le Le\u2019s photo album?\u201dSong Yu fell silent. Cotton Candy kept leaping up towards his face, wanting to lick him, so Song Yu also covered away Cotton Candy\u2019s mouth.Yue Zhishi had entirely no idea; he hugged Song Yu\u2019s arm and softly asked him,\u00a0you really have it?\u00a0Song Yu didn\u2019t speak, his face turning a bit stiff.\u201cGood shot\u2014\u2014\u201d Song Jin yelled at the screen, before he abruptly realised the room was extraordinarily quiet. Peeking over somewhat guiltily, he continued watching his game uneasily.\u201cAh, I know,\u201d Lin Rong deliberately teased. \u201cYour brother must\u2019ve taken it away because he missed you.\u201dSong Yu didn\u2019t want to admit it, so he intentionally said, \u201cI used it to hold down instant noodle cup lids.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Lin Rong gave him a smile, gesturing in the air with her arms. \u201cThe album was thiiiiiiis big. It would\u2019ve fit just nicely in your suitcase. I think even if you used it to hold down the lids for a Manchurian feast, it would\u2019ve been more than enough.\u201dYue Zhishi was laughing so hard he collapsed onto Lin Rong\u2019s shoulders, but he was hauled back up.Seeing Yue Zhishi\u2019s beautiful laughing eyes, Song Yu pinched his cheeks in a bout of revenge. He shook him, and then he focused on those lips, glistening as though they\u2019d actually been covered by a layer of clear gloss. There was a hint of threat in his voice as he said \u2014\u201cIs that so funny? Little princess.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
