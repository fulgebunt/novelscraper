Her hair and clothes were still dripping with water, and a chilling wind sent shivers through her body. As if her current condition wasn\u2019t confusing enough, the phone beside her annoyed her with its persistent vibration.Her mind was still a little dazed when she picked up the phone to take a look. When she saw the caller was labeled \u2018Father\u2019, she instinctively accepted it.The deep voice of a middle-aged man questioned from the other side of the phone, \u201cWhere are you?\u201dConfused, Ji Fanyin took another look at the screen of the phone. It was indeed \u2018Father\u2019.But this isn\u2019t my father\u2019s voice?\u201cXinxin is traveling abroad today. All of our relatives and friends are at the hotel to send her off. As her older sister, how can you be absent for such an important occasion? Do you know that you\u2019re putting her on the spot?\u201d The middle-aged man issued an order sternly, \u201cCome to the hotel right now! You know where it is!\u201dWith a \u2018boop boop\u2019 sound, the other party hung up the phone.The dazed Ji Fanyin continued holding onto the phone as she belatedly remembered a fact. Ah, my father had already died three years ago.\u2026 Is this some sort of new scam?With such thoughts in mind, she took a look at her darkened phone screen, only to see a foreign face staring back at her.That snapped her out of her daze right away. She quickly unlocked the phone and tapped into her camera. When she found herself looking at a face that clearly didn\u2019t belong to her, she immediately fell silent.Even for someone who had experienced many things throughout the course of her life, Ji Fanyin was still shocked by the realization that she had possessed another person\u2019s body. While she was still staring speechlessly at the \u2018her\u2019 inside the phone screen, a notification popped up on the phone.\u3010Installation of the application \u2018Temptation of Home\u2019 has been completed.\u3011\u201c\u2026\u201d Ji Fanyin.She backed out of the camera and tapped into the newly installed application. This application\u2019s function was so sloppily simple that it would have indubitably received negative reviews on the app store. All that could be seen were an empty progress bar and a long string of numbers beneath it.Ji Fanyin quickly counted the digits and found that it added up to 10 billion.She proceeded to tap on the question mark label at the top right, which provided her with an explanation of the application.\u3010A sudden accident has put you into a coma, but congratulations, you have been granted a rare opportunity to revive! As long as you can earn 10 billion in your second life, you\u2019ll be able to return to your original body and come back to life~\u3011As expected of an application named \u2018Temptation of Home\u2019. Its proposition was really moving, but the amount it was asking for was utterly screwed up.It was asking for 10 billion, not just 10 million.Most people in the world would live their life not even earning ten-thousandth of that amount.What was the concept of a billion dollars? Even if a person were to earn 5 million from the lottery every single day, he would have to save every single cent he earned for five years before he could amass that much money.But on second thought, if it was possible for her to swap into another body, the ridiculous proposition on the application might not necessarily be entirely gibberish.\u3010You need not worry about the sum of 10 billion being too much. All of your fixed assets and current assets will automatically contribute to the progress bar, and any Emotion Points you receive will also be quantified and added accordingly.\u3011\u3010Emotion Points refers to the emotions that others have directed toward you. Regardless of whether they are positive or negative, as long as the emotion is directed toward you, it\u2019ll be automatically quantified and added to the progress bar.\u3011Ji Fanyin squeezed the phone in her hand. I get it now.I must get a lot of people to either like me or hate me.\u3010Initiating the transference of memories. Work hard and good luck~\u3011Ji Fanyin exited the explanation tab and stared at the 10 billion progress bar speechlessly once more.A new set of memories was swiftly transmitted into Ji Fanyin\u2019s brain. As if watching a movie, the entire life of the original owner of this body was played right before her eyes.The original owner of this body shared the same name as her, Ji Fanyin, just that she had an additional twin sister named Ji Xinxin. They were identical twins and thus shared similar appearances, but their personalities were vastly different from one another.Ji Xinxin was the little princess of the Ji Family, a bubbly extrovert who was loved by everyone she met. On the other hand, her twin sister, \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019, was a gloomy individual who was often disregarded and treated as if she was transparent.Ji Xinxin was extremely skilled at playing the field, having reeled in many distinguished fishes under her skirt. She led an extremely exciting personal life, and to date, she hadn\u2019t crashed and burned yet.However, after she graduated from university, she decided to explore uncharted territories and venture into the foreign market\u2026 Ah, the technical term should be \u2018studying abroad\u2019.When the fishes reared by Ji Xinxin suddenly lost their oasis and found themselves terribly thirsty, what would they do?Needless to say, they would look for the identical \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 to pass their time.Initially, \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 was still willing to be a substitute for them, for one of them happened to be a man she had a crush on for a very long time, Song Shiyu. However, when Song Shiyu proceeded to introduce her to other men, she swiftly found herself turning into a \u2018publicly used substitute\u2019 who wasn\u2019t even worthy of having her own name. Those men would only call her \u2018Ji Xinxin\u2019.She tried to kill herself numerous times, only to find that she wasn\u2019t even entitled to that. They shackled her up and robbed her of her freedom.It was only when Ji Xinxin finally returned to the country that those men finally dumped her, allowing her to throw herself into the river and end her life.She was only 26 years old when she met her demise.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/100,000/Hour Professional Stand-inCH 1.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs someone who was known for her unruly character by her fans and critics alike, Ji Fanyin expressed her condolences to \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 for her meek and pitiful life. She coolly swept her hands through her dripping hair.I guess that explains why I\u2019m seated all wet by the riverside.Song Shiyu had privately been in contact with \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 over the past year. The two of them would meet each other from time to time, but there was no intimate contact such as kissing between them, let alone sleeping together.But just yesterday, Song Shiyu told her that he wanted to end their relationship. \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 was unable to accept it, so she leaped into the river to end her life.Ji Fanyin stretched her back a little before slowly sitting up. She grabbed her phone and started off by checking her account balance.It was fortunate that the Ji Family was still considered a reputable family. While they didn\u2019t harbor much love for \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019, they weren\u2019t too stingy with her pocket money either. The two bank cards under her name contained a total of 100,000 dollars.After checking on her account balance, she backed out of her bank application to check the \u2018Temptation of Home\u2019 application again. As expected, the progress bar had been updated to reflect -9,999,863,520.00.Well, a hundred thousand dollars was chump change against 10 billion, so there was hardly any movement in the progress bar. Still, any progress was good.Following that, Ji Fanyin checked her contact list and matched the unfamiliar yet familiar names to her memories one by one. After completing this task, she moved on to check on her messages and social media account.There was a message containing a location pin sent by Ji Xinxin several hours ago, saying: \u3010Big sis, I\u2019m sending you this so that you won\u2019t lose your way. We\u2019re having lunch here today. I\u2019ll be heading there with dad and mum first. See you there~\u3011It was followed up with a gif of an adorable cat rolling on the floor.Ji Fanyin tapped on the location pin to find the hotel\u2019s name. She knew that this was the place where Father Ji had urged her to head to through the call earlier, the place where Ji Xinxin\u2019s farewell party was being held.Ji Fanyin looked at her wet and slightly transparent clothes and wondered if there was a store nearby so she could purchase some spare clothes to change into. Then suddenly her phone rang once more.The caller was a person named \u2018Song Shiyu\u2019.Ji Fanyin pondered for a long while before it finally came to her. Ah, it\u2019s the man whom \u2018I\u2019 have a crush on.A smile curled on her lips as she accepted the call with a slide of her finger.\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Song Shiyu dove straight into the main point. \u201cYour younger sister is going abroad; aren\u2019t you going to at least send her off? She has been looking for you for some time now.\u201dDespite his reproachful attitude, his voice still sounded refined and elegant, hinting at a good upbringing. He had the kind of voice that easily won goodwill from others.However, Ji Fanyin had seen far too many handsome men and beautiful women, to the point where it would take a whole lot more than just this to make her heart thump.Completely unfazed by Song Shiyu\u2019s interrogation, she replied with a lazy tone, \u201cWhy should I send her off?\u201dSong Shiyu fell silent for a brief moment before he replied, \u201cJi Fanyin, our affair has nothing to do with Xinxin. You shouldn\u2019t hate your own little sister over this.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t head there even if I wanted to,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin leisurely as she looked for the nearest shopping mall on the map. \u201cI just dirtied my clothes, and I don\u2019t have anything suitable to change into for the farewell party.\u201dSong Shiyu paused for a moment before reminding impassively, \u201cEven if I purchase a gown for you, it won\u2019t change anything between us. There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll get together with you.\u201dJi Fanyin chuckled softly and asked, \u201cSo, do you want me to send her off or not?\u201dIt was silent on the other side before the call was abruptly hung up.Ji Fanyin called for a taxi using her phone before she rose to her feet and walked calmly up the slope. Before the taxi arrived, she suddenly received a message\u2014Song Shiyu had transferred 100,000 dollars to her.Looking at the easily earned 100,000 dollars in her account, Ji Fanyin whistled in delight. She tapped into the \u2018Temptation of Home\u2019 application and saw that the amount had been revised to -9,999,753,520.00. It had reduced by an additional 110,000, and there was a \u2018More Information\u2019 button by the side.Ji Fanyin tapped in to take a look. It displayed a record that showed that the 100,000 was the amount transferred from Song Shiyu whereas the additional 10,000 came from Song Shiyu\u2019s \u2018emotion\u2019.Oh? I barely triggered him with my words, and it stirred 10,000 Emotion Points out of him?Ji Fanyin kept her phone away as a confident smile emerged on her face.She believed that there was no such thing as a path to wealth in the world; it\u2019s sharp-witted humans who pave a way out for themselves.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/100,000/Hour Professional Stand-inCH 1.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEven though she had just received 100,000 dollars from Song Shiyu for free, Ji Fanyin had no intentions of squandering her money on branded goods. She took a taxi to the nearest shopping mall and entered a Uniqlo store. She casually grabbed a shirt, jeans, and high heels that were on discount and went straight to the cashier. All in all, the process took less than ten minutes, and she didn\u2019t even spend 300 dollars in total.Before leaving the store, she walked up to a mirror and pulled her fringe up so as to take a close look at her new face.An oval-shaped face, phoenix eyes, tall nose bridge, dense eyebrows, and fair complexion; Ji Fanyin was definitely not a bad-looking individual.However, one\u2019s disposition affected one\u2019s appearance. \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 was an introverted person who was extremely afraid of strangers, often appearing diffident in public. She was fond of covering her own face with her fringe, which formed a stark contrast against her younger sister, Ji Xinxin.Due to that, most people liked Ji Xinxin more than \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019.Ji Fanyin pulled her still slightly damp hair together and casually tied a ponytail. Following that, she headed to a department store and picked out a lipstick color that was currently in trend from one of the cosmetics booths.She casually walked up to one of the makeup mirrors in the area and started applying the lipstick. Her lips were initially a little pale from the frost, but after they were dyed the color of a cherry tomato, it brought some color back to her face.Staring at her seductive self in the mirror, her eyebrows arched a little.Playing a substitute? What for? Let\u2019s go make some money instead.\u2026After arriving at the hotel, Ji Fanyin was in no rush to proceed in and look for the banquet hall booked by the Ji Family. Instead, she chose to dawdle outside and enjoy the scenery.This hotel was located in the midst of a serene mountain, surrounded by lush greenery. It was a place where the affluent could flaunt their good taste and class to others.Ji Fanyin stood by the roadside as she gazed down at the scenery beneath her with a brooding look on her face.On her way here, she tried looking her past self up on the internet, but there were no results at all. She also noticed that she couldn\u2019t recognize any of the landmarks she could see from the top of the mountain. The evidence was telling her that she had been brought into a parallel world.She couldn\u2019t determine if that mysterious application on her phone was a friend or foe, but it was the only straw of hope she had at the moment. She would have to clutch onto it tightly.Her family, friends, and everything she had worked hard to obtain were all in the other world. For the time being, it looked like she could only take a step at a time and figure out what was going on.At the very least, based on the earlier test, it didn\u2019t seem that difficult for her to earn 10 billion.With a casual shrug, Ji Fanyin was just about to enter the hotel and face that poor excuse of a family she had when she suddenly heard a young voice calling out for her from behind, \u201cBig sis! What are you doing out here?\u201dJi Fanyin turned around, only to be faced with a young man with a haughty look on his face.The young man was taken aback for a moment upon meeting her gaze before his face began warping in revulsion. \u201cIt\u2019s you? I thought that you weren\u2019t coming.\u201dSmelling the faint cigarette scent coming from the young man, Ji Fanyin stared at him contemplatively for a moment before realization struck her. \u201cAh, it\u2019s you.\u201dThe young man had a rather peculiar name\u2014Bai Zhou (Daytime).He was 19 years old and had just entered his second year in university, but in terms of background, he was definitely one of the most eligible ones amongst Ji Xinxin\u2019s suitors. He was the young master of Yandu\u2019s Bai Family, a typical second generation tycoon who had a throne awaiting his succession.Bai Zhou had met Ji Xinxin over his summer break during his high school years, and he went completely head over heels for her ever since then. He even went to the extent of enrolling into a university in this city, where the Ji Family resided, so as to get closer to her.But no matter what he did, it was all futile. Ji Xinxin would simply respond with a \u2018You\u2019re an important little brother to me\u2019.Bai Zhou was completely at a loss as to what to do, but he was unwilling to give up.Who could have known that Ji Xinxin would suddenly choose to study abroad for three years at this juncture? It left him so distressed that he nearly tried to tamper with Ji Xinxin\u2019s visa so as to foil her plans.The rules of this world dictated that anyone who was fond of Ji Xinxin had to abhor Ji Fanyin. This was an ironclad law.Bai Zhou viewed the good-for-nothing older sister of the Ji Family in scorn and disdain. It was like an explosion of firecrackers every time \u2018Ji Fanxin\u2019 met with him, raking up a huge ruckus.\u201cJust go in if you\u2019re already here. Do you expect someone to come out to fetch you when you\u2019re already several hours late? You should have some self-awareness! You aren\u2019t the star of the show today!\u201d Bai Zhou snorted as he dug his hands into his pockets and walked past Ji Fanyin.Ji Fanyin casually began making her way forward too. For a moment there, it looked as if the two of them were traveling together, which immediately caused Bai Zhou\u2019s face to darken.\u201cHas my little sister never told you before?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin with a light tone as she casually started spinning up lies. \u201cShe absolutely hates the scent of smoke. It leaves her nauseated.\u201dBai Zhou was going to flare up when he heard those words and froze up.\u201cI guess not. She probably wouldn\u2019t dare to tell the esteemed young master of the Bai Family that even if she harbors such thoughts in mind,\u201d remarked Ji Fanyin with a sigh, sending yet another dagger into Bai Zhou\u2019s heart. \u201cHow pitiful.\u201dBai Zhou abruptly grabbed Ji Fanyin\u2019s arm and asked, \u201cAre you speaking the truth?\u201d\u201cHave you forgotten that I grew up with her?\u201d Ji Fanyin earnestly duped the young man.Bai Zhou coldly flung her arm off before rushing off in another direction. Barely a few steps later, he irritatedly took off the leather jacket he was wearing, hoping to fan off the smoke stench.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/100,000/Hour Professional Stand-inCH 1.4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMeanwhile, Ji Fanyin casually followed the signs in the hotel\u2019s lobby and headed to the banquet hall.By then, the banquet hall was already crowded with people. There were two large screens that played a photo montage of Ji Xinxin and her parents, be it on a holiday, playing around, dancing, parents\u2019 meeting\u2026 They looked like a harmonious family of three.Where\u2019s the other daughter, you ask? Who cares. She\u2019s nowhere to be seen in those merry photos anyway.Ji Fanyin watched those pictures by the entrance as she clicked her tongue in wonderment.\u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 sure led a tragic life. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong at all, yet she doesn\u2019t have any presence or standing in her family at all.As more and more doubtful gazes were directed toward her, Ji Fanyin finally began making her way toward the frontmost table in the banquet hall.She could hear the confused crowd in the surroundings gossiping about her identity, wondering why she looked so alike to Ji Xinxin. In fact, when Ji Fanyin stood before Father Ji and Mother Ji\u2019s eyes, the duo even looked stunned for a moment.\u201cMy apologies, I was held up by something else,\u201d explained Ji Fanyin before she calmly called a waiter over to bring a chair and prepare an additional set of tableware.They said that everyone was waiting for me, but there\u2019s no seat for me at all. What a load of bullshit.\u201cYinyin?\u201d Mother Ji was the first one to snap out of her daze. She coughed lightly out of awkwardness before saying, \u201cYou\u2019re really late\u2026 Come, have a seat.\u201dBefore she could finish those words, Ji Fanyin had already settled down on the chair brought over by a waiter.On the other hand, Father Ji had an awful look on his face, but he didn\u2019t want to cause a scene here. So, he shot a glare at Ji Fanyin and growled deeply, \u201cJust eat your meal and don\u2019t say a thing at all.\u201dJi Fanyin responded with a lackadaisical murmur as she picked up a piece of steamed pork belly with sugar paste with her chopsticks and placed it into her bowl.For someone who had just attempted suicide, she felt that she ought to console her soul with some sweet food.Her nonchalant attitude made it clear that she wasn\u2019t going to listen to any of her parents\u2019 preaching, and it enraged Father Ji greatly. However, before he could vent his wrath, one of his business partners suddenly walked over, leaving him with no choice but to quickly put on a smile and greet the other party.\u201cThis must be Xinxin, right? She sure grew up fast. She looks even more beautiful in person than in the photos,\u201d remarked the business partner with a smile as he directed his gaze toward Ji Fanyin.Father Ji awkwardly replied, \u201cThis is my other daughter. She\u2019s a bit shy in front of strangers.\u201dThe business partner was stunned for a moment before the two of them burst into laughter in unison to dispel the awkwardness.Meanwhile, Ji Fanyin took a sip of her drink, unbothered by the curious gazes coming from the other tables. As someone who used to make a living in the entertainment industry, she was accustomed to being in the spotlight.Shortly after Father Ji sent off his business partner, Ji Xinxin, who had changed into another gown for the event, finally returned back to the table. She was surprised for a moment to see Ji Fanyin before quickly rushing forward to greet her, \u201cBig sis, you\u2019re here! I thought that you were too busy to attend my farewell banquet. This is wonderful!\u201dJi Xinxin had a slender but shapely figure. Her face and nose were slightly tinged in redness, giving off the tempting allure of youthfulness. Her innocent smile revealed a row of neat charming teeth. She had the stereotypical appearance of what most students\u2019 first crush looked like.Ji Fanyin put her chopsticks down and looked at Ji Xinxin, saying, \u201cMay you have a smooth sailing journey.\u201dJi Xinxin looked a little downcast. She stepped forward to hug Ji Fanyin as she whispered softly into the latter\u2019s ears, \u201cBig sis, do you actually hate me?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for your existence.\u201dIf you weren\u2019t rearing such a huge pond of fishes, how could I possibly find such an easy way to make money?Ji Xinxin\u2019s expression upon hearing those words was so subtly complicated that it deserved a full-blown review by movie critics.After a few rounds of wine, the atmosphere on the tables in the banquet hall grew more light-hearted and lively.It was during this period of time that Bai Zhou finally returned to the banquet hall with a nasty look on her face. He had changed into a new set of clothes, and his hair appeared to be a little damp.A while later, a dashing young man walked over to the main table. Ji Fanyin shot a glance at his face and swiftly recognized him. Oh? Isn\u2019t this Song Shiyu?Looks like he\u2019s here to propose.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/100,000/Hour Professional Stand-inCH 1.5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was quite ironic actually, but \u2018King of the Seas\u2019 Ji Xinxin had never really dated in her whole life. Meaning to say, Song Shiyu, who was about to propose to Ji Xinxin, wasn\u2019t even her boyfriend.Ji Fanyin\u2019s lips curled up as she readied herself to watch a good show.A \u2018King of the Seas\u2019 was only best understood by another \u2018King of the Seas\u2019. Ji Fanyin knew very well that Ji Xinxin wouldn\u2019t accept Song Shiyu\u2019s proposal.When Song Shiyu walked up to Ji Xinxin with a bouquet of roses and got down on a knee, and the girls in the room began screaming in excitement, Ji Fanyin could almost hear the sound of Ji Xinxin\u2019s mental state collapsing.When the \u2018King of the Seas\u2019 reared fishes, the greatest flop that could occur was not the overexpansion of the fishery but a lack of partiality amongst the fishes.Rearing too many fishes at once wasn\u2019t a problem, but showing explicit bias to one would capsize one\u2019s boat.As a highly qualified \u2018King of the Seas\u2019, there was no way Ji Xinxin wouldn\u2019t understand this logic.So, Ji Xinxin had no choice but to reject Song Shiyu\u2019s rose bouquet with a mix of guilt and politeness on her face, apologizing nonstop to him throughout the entire process, as if it was a huge regret for her to turn him down.Song Shiyu was a gentleman, so he wouldn\u2019t make things difficult for the woman he loved even after a failed proposal. He simply turned around and left the banquet hall with a crestfallen look.After such an incident, it was hard for the banquet\u2019s atmosphere to revert back to its previous light-hearted mood. Not too long later, Ji Xinxin departed under the excuse of needing to change her clothes.Once again, she hugged Ji Fanyin and asked sweetly, \u201cBig sis have you finally decided to change your image? I\u2019m really happy for you!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re happy.\u201d Ji Fanyin stroked the other party\u2019s round head and spoke with a trace of anticipation in her voice, \u201cAs for you, there\u2019s no need for you to change at all. You\u2019re wonderful the way you currently are.\u201dContinue rearing more fishes, alright? It\u2019ll become much easier for me to find superior breeds and harvest them out of your fishery.Ji Xinxin shot a deep look at Ji Fanxin before rising to her feet and leaving with Father Ji and Mother Ji.Having eaten her fill and watched her fair share of drama, Ji Fanyin waited for the family of three to depart before rising to her feet too. She remembered that she had a car that she needed to take with her, so she decided to drop by the Ji House to pack her luggage and prepare to move out.However, while she was making her way out of the banquet hall, her phone suddenly vibrated. A message had come in.She tapped on the message and took a look. It was from Song Shiyu, consisting of just four words: \u3010Come to the carpark\u3011Ji Fanyin\u2019s eyebrows arched upward. Instead of deleting the message, she replied: \u3010Isn\u2019t it all over now? Did you think that I\u2019d still rush to your side at your summon?\u3011Song Shiyu didn\u2019t reply.Ji Fanyin hailed a taxi and left the hotel.The Ji Family mansion was a four storey high bungalow. The security system still contained a record of Ji Fanyin\u2019s fingerprint and voiceprint, so she was able to enter it without a hitch to pack her luggage. It took her half an hour to put her stuff together and leave the house.None of the maids and gardeners bothered to spare her a glance at all, let alone ask her why she was dragging such a huge luggage bag with her. Thanks to that, Ji Fanyin was able to leave the Ji House without a fuss.She headed to a realtor to rent a studio apartment for a year, paying a deposit of 10,000 dollars in advance. The good thing was that she was able to move in with her luggage right away.She could have rented a better house with her current financial condition, but she didn't think that there was a need to do so. Someone would soon be delivering one into her hands anyway.It was then that her phone suddenly rang.She grabbed her phone and saw that it was from Song Shiyu.\u201cI\u2019m outside your house.\u201d His voice sounded deeper and more indistinct than it was in the day. \u201cCome out right now.\u201d\u201cHas my little sister gotten on the plane yet?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin with a smile.\u201cJi Fanyin,\u201d Song Shiyu spat out her name menacingly.\u201cHadn\u2019t you made it clear yesterday? Whatever relationship we had comes to an end from today onward.\u201d Ji Fanyin lay down on her sofa and wiggled her toes about. \u201cWhat reason do I have to meet you?\u201dSong Shiyu calmly replied, \u201cBecause you like me, no?\u201d\u201cThat sounds about right. What can I do about that?\u201d replied Ji Fanyin. \u201c\u2026 Just to ask though, Mr Song, do you happen to carry your credit card with you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He simply watched silently as the crimson embers gradually extinguished under the dim lamppost.He had just sent Ji Xinxin off earlier in the afternoon.It was no big deal to him that Ji Xinxin had chosen to study abroad in Paris\u2014it was just a day\u2019s flight away\u2014but farewells were always difficult to handle. As a result, he naturally thought of Ji Fanyin\u2019s existence.He knew that he would be going against his words, since he had already ended his stand-in relationship with Ji Fanyin yesterday, but he was well aware that Ji Fanyin wouldn\u2019t reject him.There was nothing she could do since she fancied him.He thought about Ji Fanyin, who had for once shown her facial features openly during the afternoon farewell party, and the notion slowly became more and more enticing to him.True to his instinct, after making a call to Ji Fanyin, he quickly drove away from the Ji Residence and over to the address she sent over.It was an apartment located at the borders of the first ring road. It was still fairly high-class, as evident from the branded cars scattered all around its underground car park.Moments after Song Shiyu parked his car and lit a smoke, a person walked out from the nearby elevator. He casually raised his head to take a look, only to be bewitched by what he saw.Too similar!It was only once the woman dressed in a white cold shoulder lace dress walked up to him smilingly that he finally snapped out of his daze. \u201cJi Fanyin?\u201dJi Fanyin extended her hand toward him with her palm facing upward.Despite knowing that the person standing before him was not Ji Fanyin but Ji Xinxin, Song Shiyu\u2019s attitude still subconsciously mellowed down a little. \u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m charging by the hour,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin.There was a subtle change from her usual voice, but it somehow made her resemble Ji Xinxin even more.For this reason, Song Shiyu wasn\u2019t angered by Ji Fanyin\u2019s response. He even broke out in a smile as he asked out of curiosity, \u201cAre you that lacking in money?\"\u201cMuch more than you think,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with a nod, not embarrassed to admit it at all. \u201cSomeone as rich as young master Song shouldn\u2019t be lacking in money, right?\u201d\u201cI can give you money.\u201d Song Shiyu stifled his cigarette on the car window, not worried about damaging its expensive glass at all. With a suggestive tone, he asked, \u201cBut are you able to satisfy my needs?\u201d\u201cSince I\u2019m charging for my service, I\u2019ll satisfy any reasonable requests you pose,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin unhurriedly.Were it not for the fact that Song Shiyu had known Ji Fanyin for many years and his knowledge that Ji Xinxin was currently already onboard a plane, he would have really wondered if the person before him was really Ji Fanyin or not.\u201cI want to hear you bark like a dog,\u201d remarked Song Shiyu with a soft chuckle.He had the appearance of a refined gentleman and a scholarly air, such that even as he spoke the crude words, \u2018bark like a dog\u2019, his unhurried but pleasant voice still made it sound reasonable.Ji Fanyin looked at him in surprise. \u201cIs that the impression you have of my younger sister?\u201dSong Shiyu laughed softly before responding disdainfully to Ji Fanyin\u2019s act of comparing herself to her sister, \u201cBut you aren\u2019t your younger sister.\u201d\u201cI refuse,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin firmly. \u201cI only provide a single service, and that\u2019s to play Ji Xinxin\u2019s character. If you are unwilling to accept this condition, I\u2019ll just have to look for other customers.\u201dShe gently tucked her hair backward, revealing her fair ear.\u201cI believe that there would be someone else who is interested in this service.\u201dSong Shiyu looked at the composed Ji Fanyin as he lit up his second smoke with a smile. This time, he took a puff off it before blowing it softly at Ji Fanyin\u2019s face. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll think of it as your compensation for the time you\u2019ve spent with me this far. How much do you charge?\u201dJi Fanyin took out the laptop she was carrying in her bag and spoke with a smile, \u201cI\u2019ve just started my business, so my price list may appear a little sloppy. Just make do with it, alright?\u201dSong Shiyu lowered his head to take a casual look at the list. The list was indeed made quite sloppily, but it was detailed.\u3010Working Hours: Monday to Sunday, 9A.M. to 12A.M. Reservations have to be made ahead of time, and only 1-to-1 service is provided. Last-minute calls will be rejected.\u3011\u3010Details of Service: Other than the standard stand-in service, the client is allowed to make requests during the reserved hours which will be accepted if viewed to be reasonable and appropriate to the context.\u3011\u3010The starting price will be 100,000/hour. Traveling time and miscellaneous delays will be calculated into the service time as well. Should the service duration not come to a full hour, the cost will be rounded-up to the nearest hour. All expenses incurred during the course of the service shall be borne by the client.\u3011\u3010In the case where a reservation can\u2019t be made ahead of time or a request is made for additional service outside of working hours, the client will be charged a premium that ranges from 2 to 10 times of the usual fee. The service will only begin upon the acknowledgment of the terms by both parties\u3011\u3010Payment has to be made in full ahead of time, and all transfer of fees should be labeled clearly.\u3011Song Shiyu burst into laughter upon seeing the terms. \u201c100,000/hour? Ji Fanyin, do you know how much it costs for me to call a celebrity over to accompany me for a drink?\u201d\u201cOh? I\u2019ll have to give it a try myself to find out. Is the price for male celebrities the same as female ones?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin with a smile.This was the first time Song Shiyu saw such an unyielding Ji Fanyin, fiercely guarding the final shreds of her dignity. He tapped on the laptop screen softly and asked mockingly, \u201cJi Fanyin, is this your way of overcoming your heartbreak? Selling your own body?\u201dJi Fanyin looked at him with a \u2018What in the world are you talking about\u2019 expression as she replied, \u201cWhat I\u2019m selling here is my wit and energy. Do you know how tiring it is to act?\u201d\u201cVery well, I shall play along with you in view of the face you share with your younger sister.\u201d Song Shiyu tapped on the laptop and sneered deeply, \u201cTomorrow, 11 to 2, I\u2019ll be reserving you for three hours. However, I want to see \u2018Ji Xinxin\u2019 and not \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019. Are you able to do that?\u201dThe smiling Ji Fanyin turned her laptop over and tabbed over to another application before turning it back toward Song Shiyu. \u201cIn order to ensure the quality of service, I\u2019d need young master Song to finish up a questionnaire.\u201dSong Shiyu: \u201c?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The cigarette which he had only taken a puff from was burning with a crimson light.In a good mood from having secured her first job, Ji Fanyin pressed her floor button before waving Song Shiyu goodnight.The doors of the elevator closed up, sealing off Song Shiyu\u2019s face together with it.Ji Fanyin wasn\u2019t fazed by his nasty attitude earlier. As long as sufficient money was involved, the client\u2019s attitude problem could be wholly disregarded.After reaching her home, she lay down on her sofa and began going through Song Shiyu\u2019s questionnaire intently, making use of every second she had to spare.The questionnaire was rather short as she did it in a rush while Song Shiyu was driving over earlier. Its content was fairly simple too, basically inquiring about the client\u2019s perception of Ji Xinxin\u2019s habits, character, and so on. This was necessary for her to act out the \u2018Ji Xinxin\u2019 Song Shiyu knew.Other than that, it also included some of Song Shiyu\u2019s personal interests.All in all, it was basically just to ensure the service quality so as to convert new customers into loyal ones so that she could better rip them off.Song Shiyu might be an asshole, but at least he was rich.While going through the questionnaire, Ji Fanyin began giving some thought to the other fishes in Ji Xinxin\u2019s pond, wondering if there were any potential customers she could solicit from there.Bai Zhou? I guess he\u2019s pretty rich too.After she was finally done looking through the questionnaire, Ji Fanyin stood up and dragged her feet toward the toilet. She looked at her reflection in the mirror and began adjusting her state of mind.Too bad for the fishes in Ji Xinxin\u2019s pond\u2014or should I say that it\u2019s too good for their own good\u2014I happened to be an A-list actress before my death.It took Ji Fanyin twenty minutes in order to fully grasp Song Shiyu\u2019s \u2018Ji Xinxin\u2019.Maintaining a sweet cheerful smile on her face, she opened the \u2018Temptation of Home\u2019 application to take a look. Song Shiyu\u2019s generous provision of 300,000 dollars and some Emotion Points had pushed her slightly toward her goal. While this was a drop in the ocean of her ultimate goal of 10 billion, the fact that she was able to rake in 400,000 in a single day was still something worth celebrating.I already have half a million in my bank account now.\u201cAs expected of me,\u201d murmured Ji Fanyin proudly as she put down her phone.She headed towards her wardrobe and began carefully picking out the clothes she was going to be wearing for tomorrow\u2019s appointment. After that, she put on a mask and quietly lay down on her bed.Tomorrow is the day that I\u2019ll be imprinting myself deeply on that fish. I have to make sure that I rest up well today, so that I can better rip him off in the future.\u2026Song Shiyu sat in a restaurant\u2019s compartment room as he chatted with Ji Xinxin over text.Ji Xinxin had just landed in Paris and was currently reporting her safety to her friends and family. Despite the awkwardness that occurred between Song Shiyu and her the day before, she didn\u2019t neglect him and sent a voice message over.\u201cI\u2019ve arrived in Paris~ It\u2019s such a beautiful place, and I\u2019m doing well\u2026 What about you? How are you doing?\u201dSong Shiyu sighed softly.All he could do was to put this message aside for a few hours without responding, but he was incapable of remaining angry at Ji Xinxin.He took some time to compose a warm and polite message that conformed to his image, but before he could send it out, a series of knocking suddenly sounded on the compartment\u2019s door.Song Shiyu looked at his watch. It was a minute off eleven.Ji Fanyin sure is punctual.\u201cCome in,\u201d he said nonchalantly.The moment the door was pushed open, a voice that was identical to the one he had just heard from his phone was delivered into his ears. \u201cYou\u2019re early. Have you been waiting long?\u201dSong Shiyu glanced at the doorway in surprise. He subconsciously rose to his feet as he replied, \u201cI just arrived too.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. I was worried that you would be bored out of your mind waiting by yourself. Let\u2019s order something. I\u2019m starving.\u201d Ji Xinxin walked up to Song Shiyu and directed him a sweet smile. \u201cYou said that you\u2019ll be treating me today.\u201dSong Shiyu could even smell the usual perfume that Ji Xinxin used on her, and it made him instinctively nod in response. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s no way I would make you pay. Come, sit down and have a look at the menu, Xin\u2026\u201dHe was just about to speak that name when he suddenly bit down on the final syllabus. An overwhelming outpour of irrepressible shock and anger suddenly crashed down on him.He actually mistook Ji Fanyin for Ji Xinxin for a moment there!He remembered how Ji Fanyin would reveal that detestable hurt expression whenever he mentioned Ji Xinxin in front of her, which made her look extremely un-Ji Xinxin-like.Ji Xinxin was more like\u2026\u201cShiyu, aren\u2019t you going to take a seat too?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin doubtfully.She had already picked up the menu and started looking through it.Song Shiyu stared at her for a brief moment before he finally snapped out of his daze. His lips curled up, but his expression remained incredibly cold. \u201cJi Fanyin, who taught you this move?\u201dDid you think that you can covet what Ji Xinxin has just because you can imitate her?Ji Fanyin blinked her eyes. She unlocked her phone and shook it before Song Shiyu, displaying a timer counting down from 2 hours and 57 minutes.With a \u2018Ji Xinxin\u2019 smile on her face, she answered his question with Ji Xinxin\u2019s voice, \u201cProbably my bank account.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The only bad thing about this was that she could only order the dishes Ji Xinxin liked.I\u2019ll tolerate it since it\u2019s a free meal.Hm\u2026 Let\u2019s go with a Mushroom Soup en Cro\u00fbte, Basil Prawn Balls, and a Slow-cooked Ribeye Steak. As for the beverage, I guess I can go with Ji Xinxin\u2019s taste and try out the Lychee Cherry Soda.After deciding on the dishes to order, Ji Fanyin finally raised her head to look at the conflicted man sitting opposite her and asked worriedly, \u201cAre you alright? You look a little unwell. There\u2019s no need to force it if you\u2019re feeling ill. Shall we head back instead?\u201dOf course, you won\u2019t be getting a refund for ending the service in advance.Song Shiyu\u2019s face remained clouded. He stared at Ji Fanyin deeply, as if trying to peer through the mask she was wearing. \u201cWhen did you start preparing\u2026 Forget it, this isn\u2019t important.\u201d\u201cOf course it isn\u2019t.\u201d Ji Fanyin fiddled with the menu in her hand as she smiled at Song Shiyu. \u201cThe terms of our exchange are simple, so you need not overthink it. You just have to think of me as another person during this period of time. Weren\u2019t you dissatisfied that I don\u2019t resemble her in the past? It should be much better now, no?\u201dSong Shiyu\u2019s eyes narrowed sharply.\u201cWhat I\u2019m proposing here is a straightforward exchange with no strings attached,\u201d Ji Fanyin rested her chin leisurely on her arm as she spoke. \u201cI have no intention of revealing this matter to my younger sister and cause you any trouble, so there\u2019s no need for you to get so apprehensive.\u201dSong Shiyu snorted mockingly in response.\u201cBesides, don\u2019t you wonder about it from time to time?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Wonder about what?\u201d\u201c\u2018If she learns of my true personality, will she hate me?\u2019\u201d replied Ji Fanyin.\u201c\u2026 Ji Fanyin.\u201d Song Shiyu\u2019s body straightened up as he warned her sharply.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be nervous. Like I\u2019ve said, I have no intention of telling her,\u201d said Ji Fanyin with a casual wave of her hand. \u201cI can fulfill your fantasies. You\u2019ll be able to do what you dare not do with her. If that doesn\u2019t work for you, we can end things here.\u201dSong Shiyu was what one would call a two-faced man. He carried himself with grace and tact in social settings, so hardly anyone was aware of just how scummy he was.Someone who masks his true self deep down isn\u2019t worth befriending, though I guess I can at least maintain an amicable relationship with him for the sake of his equally deep pockets.Song Shiyu listened quietly to Ji Fanyin\u2019s words for a while before his lips suddenly crept upward, as if he had suddenly thought things through. His expression visibly relaxed as he said, \u201cJi Fanyin, you\u2019re the one who proposed this deal. Don\u2019t regret it in the future.\u201dJi Fanyin replied with a smile, \u201cRest assured, I won\u2019t.\u201dSong Shiyu turned his gaze away before pressing down on the bell on the table to call the waiter over.He seemed to have tossed away the baggage that was weighing down on his mind, allowing him to act more naturally. He tenderly asked Ji Fanyin what she wanted and placed their orders. Following that, they began sharing their daily life as if they were old friends who had known each other for many years.Ji Fanyin had spent the night trawling through Ji Xinxin\u2019s WeChat\u2019s Moments and Weibo pages, allowing her to smoothly answer any questions from Song Shiyu. But rather than the one talking, most of the time, she was the one listening instead.There could only be one reason behind that.A man\u2019s desire to flaunt before the lady he fancied was simply too great.Song Shiyu casually talked about his work and his life while Ji Fanyin cleanly pulled out the flesh of a mussel with her fork before delivering it onto his plate.Song Shiyu\u2019s words immediately trailed to a halt.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ji Fanyin raised her head in surprise. \u201cI remember that you avoided mussels in restaurants because you found it troublesome to eat, so I took out its meat for you.\u201dSong Shiyu stared at her with such an intense stare that it looked almost as if he was going to bore a hole through her.A few seconds later, he finally replied softly, \u201cNo, I just didn\u2019t expect you to notice it\u2026 Thanks.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for thanks. We\u2019re friends,\u201d said Ji Fanyin as she extracted the meat from two more mussels and placed it on his plate before turning her attention back to her steak.\u201c\u2026 So I\u2019m still a friend even though I asked for your hand in marriage yesterday?\u201d Song Shiyu suddenly asked.Ji Fanyin paused for a moment here as she pondered over the intention behind Song Shiyu\u2019s words.The real Ji Xinxin would surely put on a conflicted expression and reluctantly turn down Song Shiyu once more, but here was where the problem lay.The character whom Ji Fanyin was playing right now was not the real Ji Xinxin but the one Song Shiyu desired. In other words, she wasn\u2019t certain if Song Shiyu wanted the wish fulfillment element to her stand-in service too.It was not beyond her to offer such a service.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019ll talk about this afterward.\u201dSong Shiyu lowered his gaze and murmured, \u201c\u2026 Alright.\u201dJi Fanyin fully enjoyed the thousand dollars Western cuisine she was having, and the knowledge that she didn\u2019t have to pay a dime made it even more delightful.When it was finally time to foot the bill, Song Shiyu received the receipt from the waiter and paid for the meal without any hesitation.Ji Fanyin kept her eyes on him throughout the entire process. She waited patiently for him to finally direct a questioning look at her before remarking with a twinkling smile, \u201cA man looks the most charming when he\u2019s footing the bill.\u201dSong Shiyu\u2019s lips inconspicuously curled up a little. \u201cShall we take a walk? There\u2019s a beautiful lake outside.\u201dJi Fanyin raised three fingers before Song Shiyu, and before his perplexed face, she put them down one by one.Three, two, one.The phone that had never moved throughout the course of the meal suddenly began ringing loudly.The gentle smile on Ji Fanyin\u2019s face vanished right away. She grabbed the vibrating phone on the table and showed the countdown timer to Song Shiyu, saying, \u201cTime\u2019s up.\u201dSong Shiyu looked as if someone had just smacked a baseball bat on his head.Ji Fanyin switched off the alarm before directing a professional smile in Song Shiyu\u2019s direction. \u201cI\u2019ll be looking forward to your next reservation.\u201dShe was certain that Song Shiyu would come back for more. He had already lost himself in the illusion she had created within less than an hour\u2019s time.How could a man who indulged himself in substitutes possibly be worthy of love?Ji Fanyin picked up her bag and began heading out of the compartment room. She was just about to walk through the door when she suddenly halted her footstep. \u201cI nearly forgot. There are two questions I would like to ask you in order to improve the service quality, but if you don\u2019t intend to meet me anymore, I won\u2019t bother asking them. What are your thoughts?\u201dSong Shiyu stared at Ji Fanyin silently, not speaking a word at all.Ji Fanyin\u2019s eyebrows arched upward. \u201cIt looks like there\u2019s no need for that. Shall we blacklist one another to officially terminate this relationship?\u201dWord by word, Song Shiyu squeezed out the answer that Ji Fanyin expected to hear. \u201cI can at least afford that bit of money.\u201d\u201cVery well. Question 1, is it more convenient for you to keep this relationship underground?\u201d Ji Fanyin got straight to the point. \u201cIt might not look good for you if my younger sister hears that you\u2019re often meeting up with me while she\u2019s overseas.\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d replied Song Shiyu right away.He irritably fiddled with the pen he had used to sign the receipt, twisting it from his thumb to his pinky before doing the same backward.\u201cUnderstood. I\u2019ll take note of that when you extend invitations to me to public places, and answer accordingly.\u201d Ji Fanyin paid no heed to Song Shiyu\u2019s expression as she continued asking her questions, \u201cQuestion 2, do you wish for me to play as your lover or just remain friends?\u201dSong Shiyu burst into laughter. \u201cJi Fanyin, are you trying to use her identity to become my lover?\u201d\u201cLet me put it in another way then.\u201d Ji Fanyin didn\u2019t lose her temper despite Song Shiyu\u2019s ridicule. She maintained her professional smile and continued on, \u201cDo you wish for my service to reflect reality or follow your desires? Take the question you asked earlier for example, do you want \u2018Ji Xinxin\u2019 to accept your confession and become your lover? If so, she\u2019ll be your girlfriend from this day onward. Going out on dates, having long calls at night, exchanging words of affection\u2026 All of these can be realized if you want them to.\u201dJi Fanyin\u2019s calm depiction of the possibilities left Song Shiyu in a daze. The pen he was fiddling with slipped through his fingers and fell loudly onto the ground, jolting him out of his thoughts.He clicked his tongue and sneered, \u201cDon\u2019t even bother with your schemes, Ji Fanyin. I\u2019ll never go out with you.\u201d\u201cGot it. The next time such a situation happens, I\u2019ll stick to reality and reject you accordingly.\u201d Ji Fanyin bent down to pick the pen up.For some reason, Song Shiyu found himself reaching out to take the pen from her, but Ji Fanyin placed the pen on the table instead, making Song Shiyu\u2019s outstretched hand look awkward. She made a phone gesture with her hands and said, \u201cSee you. Remember to make a reservation in advance.\u201d\u201cWho else would bother playing along with your games other than me?\u201d scoffed Song Shiyu.\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin earnestly. \u201cThat being said, it\u2019s none of your business whether I expand my list of clients or not.\u201dSong Shiyu\u2019s face immediately darkened.However, Ji Fanyin waved her hand nonchalantly and left the compartment room all by herself. The waiter by the doorway shot a perplexed glance at her, wondering why the two of them weren\u2019t leaving together.Had Song Shiyu not been too engrossed with his flaunting, Ji Fanyin could have accompanied him out of the restaurant. Unfortunately, despite the initial hesitation, he ended up getting too absorbed into the act that he didn't even notice the passing of time. If not for\u2026Ji Fanyin was suddenly trailed to a halt and took out her phone.She subconsciously tapped into the \u2018Temptation of Home\u2019 application to take a look, and she noticed that there were significant changes in the number. Taking a look at the details, she realized that Song Shiyu had contributed an entire 90,000 Emotion Points to her.She couldn\u2019t tell just what kind of intense emotional turmoil Song Shiyu had gone through in the past three hours, but\u2026Golden fish, get\u221aWith affectionate eyes, she created a new group for her contacts labeled \u2018Client\u2019 before dragging Song Shiyu into the group. The settings allowed for the contacts under the \u2018Client\u2019 group to contact her even while her phone was in the \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 mode.She hummed a melody as she made her way to the closest WcDonalds\u2019 dessert stand to buy a vanilla cone. At the same time, she wondered when Song Shiyu would succumb and call her to make the second reservation.It should be pretty soon.After all, his birthday is coming right up, and there\u2019s no way Ji Xinxin would specially return from Paris to celebrate his birthday.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In other words, she was creating a profile for her client.It\u2019ll be Song Shiyu\u2019s birthday three days from now, which means that I\u2019ll be receiving the call latest by the day after tomorrow?After clearing up her work, Ji Fanyin took a glance at her phone and saw that it was already nearing ten. So, she took off her blue light glasses and stretched her back lazily. She was intending to put on a mask and head off to sleep when she suddenly received a video call request on her laptop.It was from Ji Xinxin.Had it been a few seconds later, Ji Fanyin would have already closed her laptop.It was worth noting that, unlike their parents and friends, Ji Xinxin didn\u2019t give Ji Fanyin the cold shoulder. On the contrary, she maintained a close relationship with her.In fact, Ji Fanyin was one of the first few to receive Ji Xinxin\u2019s call when she landed in Paris.Out of consideration of the fact that Ji Xinxin was crucial to her money making plan, she returned to her seat and accepted the video call.Once the connection was established, Ji Xinxin\u2019s face popped out on the screen. She was seated by the window, basked in warm sunlight. Even the gloomy grey shirt she wore seemed to brighten up when it was on her.\u201cSis, are you already heading off to sleep?\u201d said Ji Xinxin with a smile as she adjusted her white earpiece.\u201cI would already be lying on my bed if you were half a minute late.\u201d Ji Fanyin took a sip of water. \u201cThe weather in Paris looks fine.\u201d\u201cIt is.\u201d Ji Xinxin rested her chin on her arm as she pouted her lips slightly. \u201cBut I\u2019m already starting to miss the sunshine back at home.\u201d\u201cThree years is a long time,\u201d remarked Ji Fanyin lazily.Perhaps it was due to her overly calm voice, Ji Xinxin appeared to be surprised for a moment before she asked, \u201cSis, you seem to be in a good mood today. Did something good happen?\u201dJi Fanyin responded with a vague answer, \u201cI finally thought some things through.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Ji Xinxin lowered her eyes contemplatively for a few seconds. \u201cSis, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to ask you. You mustn\u2019t get angry, alright?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI spoke to Shiyu over the phone yesterday, and he told me something about you.\u201d There was a glimmer in Ji Xinxin\u2019s eyes as she pushed the conversation forward carefully. \u201cActually, that\u2019s also the reason why I\u2019m calling you today\u2026 I want to apologize to you. I\u2026 wasn\u2019t aware that you were fond of Shiyu. If only I knew, I should have\u2026\u201dShe paused at this point with a deeply conflicted look on her face, as if unsure of what phrase she ought to use here.\u201c\u2026 But in any case, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t a conflict between me liking him and him liking you,\u201d said Ji Fanyin with composure as she leaned back on the chair. \u201cWhy are you apologizing to me?\u201dPutting aside \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019s\u2019 own weak character and inability to reject others, the main culprits that brought about her tragedy were those despicable men. It was not to say that her unfeeling family who turned a blind eye to her plight were innocent, but they were at least further down on the guilt ladder.Ji Fanyin couldn\u2019t be bothered to figure out the reason why Ji Xinxin was suddenly making this video call to apologize. She wasn\u2019t interested in getting involved in this complex web of relationships as long as none of them interfered with her money making plan.Ji Xinxin patted her chest and exhaled deeply before a smile finally returned to her face. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief that you aren\u2019t bothered by that. I\u2019ll make sure to keep my distance with Shiyu in the future. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll never get together with him.\u201dJi Fanyin responded with a nod, but in her head, she was thinking \u2018How pitiful, Song Shiyu\u2019.\u201cSis, do you still like him?\u201d asked Ji Xinxin.Her tone was so innocent that it sounded no more than a casual question. It was hard to tell whether there was a more duplicitous intent behind it.So, Ji Fanyin also replied with equal casualness too, \u201cThere\u2019s no way feelings can be forgotten that easily.\u201d\u201c\u2026 So you still do like him,\u201d Ji Xinxin repeated contemplatively. \u201cGot it.\u201dIt would appear that she had really called for this matter. After settling this issue, she quickly bade Ji Fanyin goodnight and ended the call.Ji Fanyin shut her laptop before taking off her bluelight glasses once more. She tossed the earlier conversation to the back of her mind, not bothering to think about it at all.------Social media links:Discord: https://discord.gg/ATHVehx Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarveNovels/Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After that, she also made a few more minor contributions.And just yesterday, Song Shiyu and Ji Xinxin contributed two waves of Emotion Points. This suggested that the two of them had talked about her during their usual conversation.It surprised her how she could actually use the logs for detective work.She settled down on her chair and pondered for a moment.I\u2019ve no idea what was going on in Ji Xinxin\u2019s mind during that short video call, but it looks like everyone is quite excitable. It\u2019s no wonder why that darned app has a separate explanation for Emotion Points.Oh well, I guess everyone tends to act all dramatized in such melodramas. What\u2019s melodrama without over-the-top emotions? Such substitution lover plotlines usually make the most dog-blooded melodramas of all.Ji Fanyin stared at Ji Xinxin\u2019s 160,000 Emotion Points for quite a while before finally tapping into her planning document to make some modifications.Mm, it would be good if I could stir some emotions from time to time.Halfway through her edits, her phone suddenly rang, and she stopped typing right away. Her phone was currently in \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 mode, meaning that there was only one group in her list of contacts that could reach her.And in that group, there was only a single contact at the moment.Ji Fanyin flipped over her upside down phone, swiped the accept button, and brought it to her ear. \u201cYes?\u201d\u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll reserve you for the entire day.\u201d Song Shiyu\u2019s voice sounded a little strained.\u201cVery well. My working hours are 9A.M. to 12A.M.,\u201d said Ji Fanyin as she finished up the final edits on her planning document with her other free hand before opening up an internet scheduler. \u201cAre you certain that you wish to make a reservation for 15 hours?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m certain,\u201d replied Song Shiyu deeply. \u201cI\u2019ll send you my requests later on. That\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cRemember to pay the reservation fee in advance,\u201d reminded Ji Fanyin calmly.Song Shiyu hung up without saying anything.A minute later, Ji Fanyin received a notification informing her of a bank transaction from Song Shiyu. For a moment, she thought that she could hear a loud plop from 1,500,000 dollars falling into the water.She liked it when her client was decisive with their money. Thanks to Song Shiyu\u2019s generosity, she now had 2,000,000 dollars in her bank account.While the \u2018Temptation of Home\u2019 app was still reflecting a frightening -9,997,637,851,000, at least she was off to a good start.Ji Fanyin chuckled softly to herself before she turned off \u2018Temptation of Home\u2019 and tapped into her conversation window with Song Shiyu in preparation for receiving his requests.It was clear that Song Shiyu was figuring things out on the spot as his request came one by one, sometimes having a long interval in between even.Ji Fanyin waited patiently till Song Shiyu finally stopped talking for an entire five minutes before responding: \u3010Is that all?\u3011The messaging application reflected \u2018Song Shiyu is currently typing\u2026\u2019 for a long while, but all that came out was just a simple \u3010That\u2019s all\u3011.Ji Fanyin replied with a \u2018Thanks boss\u2019 gif before proceeding to save this conversation into Song Shiyu\u2019s client profile. After that, she began making preparations for tomorrow.All in all, Song Shiyu\u2019s requests weren\u2019t too troublesome.In fact, he even sent the dress, shoes, and accessories he had coordinated the very night to her address such that there was no need for her to fuss over what to wear. When Ji Fanyin heard a knock on her door, she thought that it was a food delivery, but when she saw a female store attendant dressed in a suit standing at her doorstep with a branded box, she immediately figured out what was going on.She didn\u2019t try out the clothes right away after receiving the box. Instead, she took out her phone and checked the \u2018Temptation of Home\u2019 app.It turned out that Song Shiyu\u2019s gift was worth 80,000 dollars.As expected, all assets, regardless of whether it was current or fixed, were all taken into account here.Ji Fanyin casually tossed the expensive dress on her bed and smiled gleefully.It looks like ten billion isn\u2019t that unreachable after all. It just depends on how much I can harvest out of the fish farm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He tossed his phone aside afterward, as if trying to keep it out of his line of sight.Something had gone wrong with him ever since his last meeting with Ji Fanyin.In the past, he only liked Ji Fanyin for her face, thinking how good it was that Ji Xinxin had a twin sister in the world. However, as soon as Ji Fanyin started moving or talking, the difference would be immediately made apparent.He knew logically that Ji Fanyin wasn\u2019t Ji Xinxin, but the three hours he spent together with Ji Fanyin\u2026 it was as if Ji Xinxin was right beside him.After Ji Fanyin walked away that day, he felt so frustrated that he nearly smashed the restaurant\u2019s cup.The following day, he found himself inexplicably reaching for his phone and dialing Ji Xinxin\u2019s number. It took two tries before she finally picked up.Her voice was as cheerful and relaxing as ever. \u201cShiyu, you were looking for me?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d There was a momentary pause from Song Shiyu before he continued on, \u201cThere\u2019s something I have been hiding from you all this while. Your big sister likes me. She confessed to me once before.\u201d\u201cHow could that\u2014\u201d exclaimed Ji Xinxin in horror. A moment later, she murmured in self-reproach, \u201cYou confessed to me that day before I left for Paris\u2026 My big sister must be devastated! If only I knew, I would have\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do anything. She knows that I like you, and she has accepted what I was going to do that day,\u201d Song Shiyu consoled his kind crush. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel guilt-ridden. I just thought that you should know about this after some thought.\u201dJi Xinxin was silent for a while before heaving a long sigh.\u201cSo my older sister likes you,\u201d she muttered softly.\u201cBut you\u2019re the only one I like,\u201d replied Song Shiyu.The moment he said those words, he felt the heaviness that had been weighing down his heart all this while leaving him, as if he had been freed of his burdens.Indeed, the only one I like is Ji Xinxin.Two days later, Song Shiyu received a call from Ji Xinxin.With a choked-up voice, she cried, \u201cI spoke to my big sister. She said that she still likes you\u2026 Shiyu, can you stop liking me? I don\u2019t want my big sister to be unhappy.\u201dSong Shiyu was at a loss for words for a long time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Xinxin. I can fulfill any other requests that you have, but I can\u2019t do that for you.\u201dWhen he finally hung up the call, he felt like he could almost taste a faint metallic smell at the back of his throat, as if someone had pounded his chest with a sledgehammer.I can\u2019t contact Ji Fanyin anymore. Ji Xinxin will get mad if she finds out about it.With such thoughts in mind, Song Shiyu endured for a day.Yes, just one day.\u2026Just one day, for one last time. I\u2019ll really break things off with her after that.It was with such thoughts in mind that he finally dialled Ji Fanyin\u2019s number and said, \u201c\u2026 Tomorrow, I\u2019ll reserve you for the entire day.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ji Fanyin woke up early, did a full routine of skincare, followed by her make-up and hairdo before finally putting on the dress Song Shiyu had sent over last night.Before leaving home, she took a look at herself in a full-body mirror and smiled at the sweet-looking woman staring back at her.It sure is ironic that my impersonation is as fake as Ji Xinxin is. The two of us are putting on an act to dupe the same person. It\u2019s so ridiculous that it\u2019s actually interesting.She got on a cab heading to the location she had agreed on with Song Shiyu and began carefully looking through the list of requests once more.His requests weren\u2019t exactly hard, but they weren\u2019t easy either.To put it simply, Song Shiyu and Ji Xinxin had an argument.How amusing. A \u2018King of the Seas\u2019 like Ji Xinxin shouldn\u2019t have made such a minor mistake. In other words, she was intentionally upsetting Song Shiyu.However, this wasn\u2019t a bad thing for Ji Fanyin. Whenever Song Shiyu was unhappy, his first instinct was to squander his money to lift his mood.The cab finally came to a halt.Ji Fanyin got out of the car and glanced at her phone. There were still ten more minutes until 9 A.M. So, she leisurely made her way to the closest Starbucks to buy two cups of coffee, and one of them was selected based on Song Shiyu\u2019s taste.She was just about to head out of the store when she caught a glimpse of Bai Zhou through the caf\u00e9\u2019s glass.The impatiently frowning young man was surrounded by his peers, but his distinctive facial features and tall stature naturally made him the center of attention.It had barely been a few days since Ji Xinxin had left, so her suitors were all in the worst possible moods now.Bai Zhou was still studying at the moment, so there was no way he could follow Ji Xinxin to Paris. According to what she remembered, his parents were opposed to him getting in a relationship with Ji Xinxin, so they confiscated his passport.Ji Fanyin took a sip from the warm cup of latte as she turned her eyes away from Bai Zhou and began heading toward the caf\u00e9\u2019s back entrance with light footsteps.A mere second after she walked out, Bai Zhou and his companions entered the caf\u00e9 through the front entrance.While his companions were chattering away, Bai Zhou swept at his surroundings, and within less than a second, he noticed a departing silhouette which immediately made him narrow his eyes.There was no way he would ever mistake Ji Xinxin\u2019s profile!He immediately chased after the silhouette, pushing his way through the store\u2019s crowd without a moment\u2019s hesitation.Is she back? Isn\u2019t she supposed to be in Paris?His long legs allowed him to run as fast as the wind, and his height granted him an overview of his surroundings. It didn't take him long to find the familiar silhouette amidst the crowd.As he approached her, he subconsciously slowed his footsteps and asked hesitantly, \u201cBig sis?\u201dThe other party halted her footsteps, turned around, and smiled at him. \u201cThis is the second time you have recognized the wrong person. Are you unable to differentiate between the person you like and the person you hate?\u201dThe tender expression that was on Bai Zhou\u2019s face immediately vanished without a trace. His face began scrunching tightly together as he spat out the other party\u2019s name hatefully, \u201cJi Fanyin.\u201d\u201cYoung master Bai,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with a nod of acknowledgment.\u201cAre you imitating her style?\u201d Bai Zhou stared down at her from above. \u201cDo you think doing this would make Song Shiyu fall in love with you?\u201dToward that snide remark, Ji Fanyin asked curiously, \u201cHow did you know that I was interested in Song Shiyu?\u201d\u201cSong Shiyu has already told everyone about it a long time ago. The only one he hid it from was big sis. He was afraid that she would get upset because of you,\u201d sneered Bai Zhou as he slipped his hands into the pockets of his jackets. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that you\u2019re fond of Song Shiyu. In everyone\u2019s eyes, you\u2019re no more than a toad desperately trying to climb its way up.\u201dHe thought that Ji Fanyin would cry out of embarrassment at his words, but the latter only nodded contemplatively before raising her head to say, \u201cI have to rush to my work now. See you.\u201dBai Zhou: \u201c?\u201dIt was then that he noticed the two cups of coffee in Ji Fanyin\u2019s hands, and a load of vulgarities suddenly flashed across his mind. But for some reason, criticizing Ji Fanyin felt almost as if he was criticizing Ji Xinxin as well, so he quickly erased them from his mind.He watched as Ji Fanyin\u2019s silhouette faded into the distance. Her profile looked beautiful and confident, a vast difference from the diffident woman he knew of.Ji Fanyin has a job? Hasn\u2019t she been unemployed ever since graduating from university?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She knew very well just what kind of person Bai Zhou was. It would be generosity from his part to even remember a person\u2019s name\u2014it was not even a concern that he would get curious about her.Of course, Bai Zhou would also be a good fish to hook onto, but it would take a bit more trouble to reel him in.Ji Fanyin leisurely waited at the agreed location for Song Shiyu before a humble-looking black sedan stopped before her. The passenger door automatically opened for her.Ji Fanyin passed a cup of latte toward Song Shiyu, who was seated in the driver\u2019s seat, and exclaimed with a smile, \u201cHappy birthday! Have you had your breakfast? Here, I got you a cup of coffee.\u201dSong Shiyu looked at her, but it seemed like he hadn\u2019t adjusted his state of mind over yet. He quietly took the cup and placed it in the cup holder between their seats.Ji Fanyin lifted her skirt and got into the car. While putting on her safety belt, she asked, \u201cYou bought a new car? This is the first time I\u2019m seeing you drive this one.\u201dSong Shiyu stepped on the accelerator as he replied distractedly, \u201cMm, I bought it yesterday.\u201dJi Fanyin understood the meaning behind that right away.It\u2019s a clandestine date, so it wouldn\u2019t be good for him to drive his usual cars. It would be bad if someone recognizes him.\u201cAh, I saw Bai Zhou earlier. He was hanging out with his friends,\u201d commented Ji Fanyin with a gleam in her eyes. \u201cHe even greeted me earlier.\u201d\u201cBai Zhou greeted you?\u201d Song Shiyu\u2019s body immediately stiffened up. \u201c\u2026 Did he mistake you for Ji Xinxin as well?\u201dJi Fanyin picked up her cup of coffee and emphasized with a mischievous smile, \u201cWhat do you mean by mistake? I\u2019m Ji Xinxin.\u201dSong Shiyu frowned. \u201cDid you say anything unnecessary to him?\u201d\u201cWhy would I?\u201d Ji Fanyin ended his apprehensions right away. \u201cI\u2019m here to meet you, not him. How could he compare to you?\u201dSong Shiyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t say a word at all, but Ji Fanyin had a feeling that the car had sped up by a bit.While passing by the caf\u00e9 she was in earlier, Ji Fanyin took a peek and saw Bai Zhou standing by the entrance. He was in his usual hands-in-pocket position, and there were three words written on his tightly scrunched face.Don\u2019t disturb me.One of his companions patted his shoulder and made a joking remark, but he shrugged his hand impatiently and turned his head away.\u201cYou\u2019re smiling,\u201d said Song Shiyu. \u201cIs there something interesting outside?\u201dJust another fish for me to reel in, thought Ji Fanyin.She turned to him calmly and replied, \u201cI saw your reflection in the window. Now that I think about it, it has always been your chauffeur driving you around. This is the first time I\u2019m sitting beside you on the passenger seat.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my birthday today. I want to spend it with just you,\u201d murmured Song Shiyu.He seemed to be finally getting into the right state of mind as his tone and attitude became much more natural than before.\u201cSure!\u201d Ji Fanyin had already long entered her role by now. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201dSong Shiyu smiled gently, \u201cThe chocolate factory.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It just doesn\u2019t seem to be in-line with the kind of person he is both on the inside and outside.However, it was not like she couldn\u2019t understand where he was coming from. The pitiful man simply wanted a chocolate with a special meaning behind it from Ji Xinxin.For that, he was willing to spend 1,500,000 dollars, buy a new car, and even book the entire factory for the whole morning.\u201cI\u2019ve never made chocolate before,\u201d said Ji Fanyin with a troubled tone. \u201cWhat if I fail? It might end up tasting awful.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, there\u2019s nothing you can make that I wouldn\u2019t like,\u201d assured Song Shiyu gently.\u201cThat goes without saying! You\u2019re going to be the first person to receive my handmade chocolate. How embarrassing would it be for me if you rejected my chocolate?\u201d said Ji Fanyin indignantly.Those words conveyed a single meaning.You, Song Shiyu, are the first person to receive handmade chocolates from Ji Xinxin.It went without saying that the client was overjoyed to hear that.Ji Fanyin picked up the manual passed to her by a staff member and began reading through it earnestly. It didn\u2019t look too difficult.So, she told Song Shiyu to stand to the side before heading toward the stove, which already had a pot of simmering hot water. She threw a bar of chocolate into a little bowl and placed it into the pot. While the chocolate gradually melted under the heat, she slowly stirred it so as to prevent it from getting burnt.\u201cWhat shape should I go with?\u201d Ji Fanyin looked through the various molds while keenly assessing Song Shiyu\u2019s reaction.Song Shiyu\u2019s eyes swept across the molds before finally stopping on the heart mold.Too predictable, thought Ji Fanyin.\u201cWhich one do you like?\u201d she asked.Song Shiyu coughed softly, \u201cI\u2019m fine with anything.\u201dSo, Ji Fanyin unhesitatingly reached out for the rather exquisitely-made heart mold and said, \u201cI like this one. Let\u2019s go with this.\u201dSong Shiyu responded with a deep \u201cMm\u201d.You\u2019re too easy to read.Ji Fanyin was really tempted to give him an anti-fishing lesson, but on second thoughts, it would be better for her client to remain gullible. She cast the idea out of her head and carefully poured the melted chocolate into the mold, following the instructions carefully as she waited for the chocolate to harden up.While waiting, Song Shiyu suddenly began talking about the past. \u201cI know that my confession that day during the farewell party might have seemed abrupt to you, but it really wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve liked you for a very long time now.\u201dJi Fanyin blinked his eyes as she thought about the requests Song Shiyu had raised the day before.He wanted to hear Ji Xinxin apologize for the things she said two days ago. While she wasn\u2019t sure what they were, there was no need for her to probe too deeply into it either.Song Shiyu was just projecting whatever he couldn\u2019t get from Ji Xinxin onto a substitute to console his own heart. It was nothing more than self-deception.And Ji Fanyin was receiving money in order to fulfill his wishes.\u201cCounting from our university days, we\u2019ve known each other for four years now. During this period of time, I\u2019ve always liked you,\u201d Song Shiyu lowered his head and spoke slowly. \u201cI chose to confess to you on that day because I knew that your world would grow much bigger in France. You\u2019d meet a lot of new people, some whom you might even fall in love with\u2026 I hate that.\u201dJi Fanyin chose to listen to him quietly, not interrupting at all.\u201cI was fine with you rejecting me.\u201d Song Shiyu paused for a brief moment at this point before continuing on, \u201cBut that day, you told me over the phone that you want me to end my feelings for you\u2026 My feelings are not something I can control!\u201dJi Fanyin finally understood what the two had argued about that day.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said softly. Her voice was so sweet and melodious that it sounded like the singing of the Sirens. \u201cI failed to consider your feelings. It was disrespectful of me to say those words to you, and I apologize for that. It\u2019s your birthday today, and I don\u2019t want you to be unhappy. I\u2019ll take back those words, so please don\u2019t be mad at me anymore, alright?\u201dI\u2019ll be counting on you to forgive Ji Xinxin. Please continue being a slave under her skirt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, Ji Fanyin raised her hand even faster than him and patted his hair, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re an important person to me, Shiyu. I don\u2019t wish to lose you.\u201dSong Shiyu obediently lowered his head and replied, \u201c\u2026 That won\u2019t happen.\u201dJi Fanyin maintained her sweet smile as she tousled his hair a little. Her movements were so light that it was almost as if she was touching a cloud. Her hand had already retracted before even touching his scalp.However, Song Shiyu didn\u2019t notice anything amiss with her movements at all. Instead, he lifted his head to look at her with shimmering eyes, clearly in a good mood.From that, Ji Fanyin could tell that she had accomplished her client\u2019s request for the day. Given the satisfactory service she had provided, it shouldn\u2019t be long before the client made his next appointment.After all, a person who had been living in an illusion for too long might never be able to return back to reality.Once the chocolate hardened, Ji Fanyin wrapped it up in a gift box before tying a ribbon around it. Then, before Song Shiyu\u2019s expectant eyes, she handed this wish fulfillment chocolate into his hands.\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cI hope that you\u2019ll be as happy every birthday you have from now on.\u201dI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to earn enough to return home by next year. I guess I can consider converting him into a long-term client.\u201cThanks.\u201d Song Shiyu took the delicate little box. After a moment of thought, he added, \u201cI also hope that I\u2019ll be able to spend every birthday from now on with you.\u201dJi Fanyin placed her hands behind her back and grinned at him. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re willing, your wish can be realized.\u201dSong Shiyu broke into a smile too. He carefully stowed away the box as if it was a precious treasure before asking, \u201cAre you hungry? Let\u2019s grab some lunch.\u201d\u2026They had lunch at a restaurant Song Shiyu fancied, and Ji Fanyin gently ordered some of the dishes he liked in his stead.After that, they headed to a quiet library to do a bit of reading and chat. In those few hours, Ji Fanyin was able to keep him in an euphoric mood.Dinner was at a different restaurant, where they shared a candlelight dinner to a violin accompaniment.Last but not least, they headed to a famous musical which was known for its hard-to-obtain tickets. They were the best seats at that.Ji Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201dWow, what an \u2018affluent\u2019 day I just spent. Thanks for the treat.Fifteen hours passed in a flash, and Song Shiyu took Ji Fanyin back to the Ji Residence.Ji Fanyin noticed that the clock in the car read 11:20P.M., which suggested that Song Shiyu was intending to end this date thirty minutes in advance.He must have gotten deeply traumatized by the alarm clock the previous appointment. It was probably no different from stopping a man at the peak of his climax.The car stopped at the entrance of the Ji Residence. Song Shiyu alighted from the car and glanced at his watch.\u201cThanks for sending me home,\u201d said Ji Fanyin with a smile. \u201cWas your birthday enjoyable?\u201d\u201c\u2026 It was. Thanks to you,\u201d replied Song Shiyu quietly.His long eyelashes seemed to droop a little, covering his eyes. It felt like sorrow was looming over his face. \u201cIt would have been even better if you could like me.\u201dJi Fanyin blinked her eyes.Isn\u2019t that the service you personally rejected?Of course, it would be unprofessional of her to point that out to her client right now since she was still at work. So, she beat around the bush and said, \u201cActually, I prepared another birthday present for you.\u201dSong Shiyu immediately raised his head to look at her. \u201cReally?\u201dJi Fanyin took out an accessory box from her bag that was even smaller than her hand. \u201cYup, I bought it a few days ago.\u201dOf course not. I only got it yesterday.Song Shiyu pursed his lips slightly as he carefully received the present. There was a few seconds of hesitation before he finally opened it. What he saw made his pupils dilate, and he gasped, \u201cIs this\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s a matching pair of bracelets.\u201d Ji Fanyin raised her hand and waved it in front of Song Shiyu.She was currently wearing the bracelet Song Shiyu had given her yesterday, and the one she had just given him was the male version in the same series.In other words, it was a set of couple accessories.It was a little expensive, but Song Shiyu did pay her quite a bit.I\u2019ll just consider it a 1% customer rebate.With a shaky voice brimming with nervousness, she asked, \u201cI bought it because I thought you might like it\u2026 Do you?\u201dSong Shiyu\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed up and down before he finally answered, \u201cI do\u2026 Xinxin, could you put it on for me?\u201dJi Fanyin was the type to carry things out to the end, so she took the bracelet out from the box and put it on Song Shiyu\u2019s wrist.\u201cSo\u2026 I\u2019ll be leaving then?\u201d she asked with a smile.\u201c\u2026 Goodnight.\u201dAs soon as Ji Fanyin stepped out of the car, Song Shiyu drove away without a shred of hesitation. She watched as his car sped away, as if there was a ghost chasing him.By the time his car finally disappeared, Ji Fanyin finally put away her work smile and took out her phone. There was only three minutes left before the timer rang.Men. Tsk tsk.Despite knowing that it\u2019s nothing more than a dream, he still foolishly immerses himself in it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She tapped into a ride-hailing app to catch a ride back to her apartment when she suddenly heard a horn blaring behind her.She turned around and saw Bai Zhou sitting on top of a motorcycle that stood by the side of the road.It was clear that he had seen everything from the start to the end.\u201cYou\u2019re at the wrong place if you\u2019re looking for my younger sister,\u201d Ji Fanyin reminded him out of goodwill.However, Bai Zhou wasn\u2019t about to let her change the topic here. There was a deep frown on his face as he probed, \u201cAre you impersonating her and doing stuff that would soil her reputation?\u201dOh? That\u2019s an imaginative mind he has.Ji Fanyin calmly tucked her long hair behind her shoulders as she replied, \u201cWhat do you mean by soiling her reputation? Didn\u2019t I tell you earlier in the morning? I\u2019m working.\u201d\u201cThat person in the car was a man, right?\u201dBai Zhou began walking toward Ji Fanyin with large strides.\u201cI\u2019m asking you if you\u2019re using Ji Xinxin\u2019s name to go around duping other men! You have never dressed up like that or shown your face in public, but as soon as she\u2019s gone, you suddenly start imitating her style! Isn\u2019t it obvious that you\u2019re trying to impersonate her to deceive others? Do you intend to humiliate her with the atrocities you commit using her identity once she\u2019s back?\u201dJi Fanyin took a while to ruminate over his words before asking curiously, \u201cWhat kind of shows have you been watching recently?\u201dNormal people wouldn\u2019t have come to such a dramatic conclusion.\u201cAre you trying to change the subject?\u201d Bai Zhou stood imposingly before Ji Fanyin, looking like an enraged little lion. \u201cDo you dare tell me who the person in that car was?\u201d\u201cIt's confidential business information,\u201d rejected Ji Fanyin.\u201cDoes selling yourself count as a business too?\u201d sneered Bai Zhou.Ji Fanyin couldn\u2019t be bothered to get angry with this hot-headed child, so she sighed softly and asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you in love with my younger sister?\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d Bai Zhou narrowed his eyes. \u201cJust because I like her doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019ll be forgiving toward you. Besides, you\u2019re going around trying to ruin her reputa\u2014\u201d\u201cDo you think that the person you love is someone whom I can easily pass off as?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin.\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Zhou was stumped by the question. His face reddened in agitation as he exclaimed, \u201cW-who knows what you\u2019re up to! Your face is identical to hers after all!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s put it this way,\u201d Ji Fanyin began to coax him. \u201cEven if I\u2019m impersonating her, shouldn\u2019t someone who loves her\u2014one such as yourself\u2014be able to see through it right away?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d roared Bai Zhou. \u201cYou can copy her all you want, but you\u2019ll never become her!\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t that solve everything then? No one will be duped by me, so I\u2019m nothing more than a clown in everyone\u2019s eyes.\u201d Ji Fanyin clapped her hands to conclude the argument. \u201cThose who are duped by me are just dimwits who don\u2019t love her enough. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201dBai Zhou: \u201c\u2026\u201dIt looked like he was tempted to nod in agreement, but at the same time, he felt as if something was off here.In the end, he spat out a stern warning, \u201cI know that you\u2019re planning something. My eyes are on you! You\u2019d better not let me catch you in the act!\u201dJi Fanyin watched as Bai Zhou zoomed away on his motorcycle before proceeding on to hail a cab on her phone.Youngsters nowadays sure are energetic. You spoke so confidently, but your body still honestly accepted Song Shiyu\u2019s \u2018recommendation\u2019 in the end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thus, this was the first time she was checking on the phone since meeting up with Song Shiyu early in the morning.The first thing she noticed was that Bai Zhou had just provided her with some pocket change. Glancing downward, Ji Fanyin was amazed by the roller coaster of emotions Song Shiyu had gone through over the course of the day. All in all, there were dozens of records.The two largest sums came from their time in the chocolate factory and the unexpected birthday present she had gifted him while parting ways.It was pretty much the same as what she had expected.However, after she washed up and lay down on her bed, she habitually took one last look through the logs, and noticed the addition of another transaction.\u3010Song Shiyu: 100,000 Emotion Points\u3011Ji Fanyin chuckled a little upon seeing this record.To have such intense emotional fluctuation at this hour, it looks like Song Shiyu has finally snapped out of it.Ji Fanyin switched her phone to \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 mode and placed it on her bedside table before closing her eyes and drifting off to sleep.\u2026While Song Shiyu was leaving the Ji Residence, he subconsciously stepped all the way down on the accelerator pedal, as if he was escaping from the countdown of the timer.It was almost as if he thought that this dream would never come to an end as long as that countdown never rang, and the woman, whose eyes were filled with nothing but him, would forever remain as Ji Xinxin.After driving a few hundred meters away, Song Shiyu finally slowed down a little and drove back home.The fifteen hours he had spent with her were sweet and satisfying, but the overwhelming feeling of emptiness when it all came to an end made those fond memories look incomparably ironic.After stopping in the garage, Song Shiyu didn\u2019t alight from the car right away. He remained in the driver\u2019s seat, staring at the bracelet on his wrist in a daze.This is the present that Xinxin bought for me, and she personally put it on me\u2026No, that person is Ji Fanyin!Song Shiyu\u2019s breathing suddenly stifled, and his heart began beating so furiously that it felt like something within him was going to explode. Anger filled his mind as he tore the bracelet away from his wrist, opened the car door, and proceeded to smash it onto the ground.There was a series of clanging sounds.Even after the echoes of those clanging sounds faded, Song Shiyu was still unable to calm his frantic breathing.He gritted his teeth in frustration and smashed his palm down onto the steering wheel. Then, he leaped out of the car and headed to the backseat to grab the chocolate gift box. He forcefully ripped the ribbon off and held the heart-shaped chocolate up high, prepared to smash it into the wall of the garage.But all of a sudden, his violent movements came to a halt.In the end, he didn\u2019t throw the chocolate out.Instead, he reached for his phone and tapped into his WeChat. He searched for Ji Fanyin\u2019s contact and removed her from his friend list without any heads up. It was only then that the suffocating sensation choking up his chest finally alleviated a little.He looked at the heart-shaped chocolate once more, and in the end, he took it out of the garage with him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, this wasn\u2019t of major concern since he would be back eventually.Ji Fanyin\u2019s bank account was currently loaded with money, such that she could make the down payment for a new house right away. It was just that she was in no rush to move out yet, so she leisurely holed herself up in her rented house and watched TV for the entire day.Over the course of the day, Ji Xinxin dropped her a call and talked about her daily life in France.\u201cOh right!\u201d Just as they were about to hang up, Ji Xinxin suddenly recalled something and asked, \u201cI heard from Cheng Lin and the others that they are intending to hold a gathering soon. I won\u2019t be able to make it there, but won\u2019t you consider joining them, sis?\u201dJi Fanyin racked her mind to recall who Cheng Lin was.\u201cSis, have you already forgotten about Cheng Lin?\u201d Ji Xinxin reminded her gently, \u201cShe transferred into our high school during our second year. She was quite famous back then, having quite an illustrious background and a beautiful face. She was also in the same university as us, studying in the English Faculty.\u201dJi Fanyin had no impression of such a person at all, so she figured that the other party was just an unimportant character.However, this showed that the people heading to the gathering were acquainted with both Ji Xinxin and Ji Fanyin. Since they were in the same circle, it was likely that they were from notable backgrounds too\u2026 If so, there were probably some of Ji Xinxin\u2019s fish there too.Perhaps I could expand my client list there.Ji Fanyin flipped through her calendar as she asked casually, \u201cWhen is the gathering?\u201d\u201cThe day after tomorrow. Sis, are you interested?\u201d Ji Xinxin was surprised. \u201cI thought that\u2026 Never mind. I\u2019ll pull you into the group then.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin.After the call was hung up, Ji Xinxin quickly added Ji Fanyin to a new group before bidding them goodnight, saying that it was getting late over on her side.Ji Fanyin took a look at the pinned messages and saw the date, time, and location of the gathering written neatly up there. She quickly copied the details down onto her calendar before scrolling through the list of members in the chat.None of the members in the group were in her friend\u2019s list.But again, Ji Fanyin\u2019s friend\u2019s list had always been limited to a few people. She disliked crowds and socializing, so she didn\u2019t have many friends.After that, she muted the group chat.\u3010Yukki: @Ji Fanyin You are joining the gathering? No way! Did anyone even invite you? Why are you so thick-skinned?\u3011\u3010Lively Ducky: I flipped through the chat records. Xinxin invited her to the group. I\u2019m fine with it. Make sure to dress formally for the gathering @Ji Fanyin\u3011\u3010Dream: Are only those in our batch invited? Can I bring a senior along too?\u3011\u3010Lively Ducky: That would depend on which senior you\u2019re talking about\u3011\u3010Dream: Of course I\u2019m talking about Senior Song Shiyu! I\u2019m still meeting him from time to time, so I can invite him to the gathering too\u3011\u3010Yukki: *rolls eyes emoji* Ji Xinxin isn\u2019t even joining in this time around. Do you think that Senior Song will join us? I bet he\u2019ll run at the very sight of Ji Fanyin!\u3011\u3010Yukki: I shan\u2019t name names, but those who aren\u2019t invited should have some self-awareness\u3011\u3010Sneaky Little Li Bai: Invite him! I have some business-related matters that I wanna ask Senior Song about. It\u2019ll be amazing if he could join us @Dream\u3011\u3010Dream: Alright. He doesn\u2019t like to be added to groups though, so I shan\u2019t add him in. I\u2019ll just relay his answer to you later on\u3011\u3010Lively Ducky: Oh yeah! It\u2019s been so long since I saw my adonis. Hehehe, I wonder if he\u2019s still as handsome as before. Is he seeing anyone yet?\u3011\u3010Yukki: Gosh, why are you all so behind on the news? Haven\u2019t you heard that Senior Song gave Ji Xinxin a bouquet of roses and confessed to her during her farewell party? It was really romantic! It\u2019s such a pity that he was rejected\u3011\u3010Spectator: Awww\u3011\u3010Yukki: Ah, but that doesn\u2019t mean that a certain someone will stand a chance\u3011\u3010Yukki: ...\u3011\u3010Yukki: @Ji Fanyin Are you playing dead?\u3011\u3010Sneaky Little Li Bai: You should cut it out. Xinxin is in this group too. She\u2019ll see your message\u3011\u3010Yukki: Are you joking with me? Do I look like I\u2019d be afraid of Ji Xinxin? You speak as if Ji Xinxin has really stood up for Ji Fanyin before!\u3011\u3010Yukki: @Ji Fanyin Come out! Why join this group if you don\u2019t even dare show your face?\u3011\u3010Yukki: You aren\u2019t replying, huh? Very well. You\u2019d better not show up tomorrow!\u3011\u3010Dream: \u2026 I was going to ask if anyone could call Bai Zhou, but I guess there\u2019s no point.

The organizer had booked the entire place. As soon as the waiter noticed her, he quickly walked over and politely asked her if she was there for the gathering before ushering her in.In the garden they would be dining in, Ji Fanyin saw a few young women dressed in exquisite clothes, chatting with one another. Some were seated and some were standing, but all of them had their own circle to chat in.The few women standing near the entrance swiftly noticed Ji Fanyin\u201cJi Xinxin?!\u201d exclaimed one of them. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be in France?\u201dJi Fanyin shot the person a glance and replied, \u201cI am Ji Fanyin.\u201dThis simple self-introduction created a buzz through the garden. There were even some who gasped aloud and exclaimed, \u201cHow could Ji Fanyin possibly look like that?!\u201d\u201cWhat do you think that Ji Xinxin\u2019s identical twin sister ought to look like?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe crowd widened their eyes in realization.Ji Fanyin was just about to walk past them and take a seat when she heard a waiter behind her saying \u201cThis way please\u201d. She turned around to take a look, curious to see who was the one who timed his arrival even more precisely than her.It was Song Shiyu.He was currently walking with another man who looked to be around his age, patiently listening to the latter with a gentle look on his face. He appeared to be a person of excellent upbringing no matter how one looked at him.Ah, Song Shiyu does have an excellent upbringing. It\u2019s just that his character got twisted along the way.Ji Fanyin was about to move her gaze away after taking a quick nonchalant glance when Song Shiyu coincidentally raised his head at the same time, resulting in the meeting of their eyes.There was a brief pause before Song Shiyu turned his head away. His action looked a little flustered, as if he was avoiding something.Ji Fanyin couldn\u2019t be bothered to pay him any heed. She settled down in her seat and ordered a cup of lemonade.Song Shiyu\u2019s entrance immediately placed him at the center of attention. The crowd warmly walked over to greet him.While playing a mobile game, Ji Fanyin could hear bits and pieces of their conversation that gave her a deeper understanding of the social standing of the attendees.If one were to view upper class society as a hierarchical pyramid, the ones who stood at the very top were Song Shiyu and his group whereas the other attendees were one level beneath him. That would explain their more-than-cordial attitudes.Ji Fanyin didn\u2019t join any of the conversations, but humans were slaves to their sense of vision. Good-looking people had an inherent advantage when it came to socializing.She sat lazily under a parasol and fiddled with her phone, not bothering to look at anyone. Yet, despite her perfunctory attitude, the crowd couldn\u2019t help but turn their eyes in her direction.The brilliant sun cast a small patch of light on her shoulder, looking almost like a gentle kiss of affection from the world.There was one person who couldn\u2019t resist the urge to start a conversation with her.\u201cJi Fanyin? It has been such a long time! You look so different now. How do I put it\u2026 You seem much more confident than before.\u201dJi Fanyin was in the midst of watching a video of a cute cat flopping over on its belly to demand a massage from its owner. Due to that, her expression was much gentler than usual when she raised her head.\u201cIt\u2019s just a change in hairstyle.The male classmate: \u201c\u2026\u201dA change in hairstyle? More like a complete change in soul!\u201cDo you still remember me? We were in the same class in high school. I was the gym class representative back then.\u201dJi Fanyin smiled at him and replied, \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t remember it.\u201d\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry about it! We didn\u2019t speak much back then,\u201d the male classmate replied understandingly. He cleared his throat before introducing himself with a reddened face, \u201cI am Zhao Qi.\u201d\u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d Ji Fanyin offered him her hand with a casual attitude. \u201cShall we consider this our first meeting?\u201dZhao Qi looked almost flattered by her response. He quickly shook her outstretched hand with a smile.After this smooth greeting, Zhao Qi seemed to have gotten into the groove as his attitude became much more natural. He started talking about work-related matters.Ji Fanyin put her phone aside and rested her chin on her hand as she listened to his stories. Her posture was laid-back but not perfunctory, giving off an atmosphere where anyone could tell that she was listening attentively to her conversation partner.It was the kind of atmosphere that made it impossible for a third party to join the conversation.\u2026\u201c\u2026 Senior?\u201dSong Shiyu finally snapped out of his daze and retracted his gaze from the parasol. He put on an apologetic smile and said, \u201cPardon me. I was distracted for a moment.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d One of the classmates scratched his hair and remarked, \u201cI was also surprised when I first saw her. Ji Fanyin\u2019s hair had always been scattered untidily, covering her face. I feel like this is the first time I\u2019m properly seeing her face; she really does look identical to Ji Xinxin.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s only limited to her face. Ji Fanyin isn\u2019t fond of smiling. Anyone can tell the difference between the two sisters with just a few looks. The one senior likes is Ji Xinxin, so there\u2019s no way he would mistake the two of them!\u201dSong Shiyu: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIs Ji Fanyin seeing anyone?\u201d someone asked. \u201cZhao Qi sure made a move quickly there. If only I knew, I would have also\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not too late to join them now,\u201d one of the classmates egged him on.\u201cBut I made fun of her during our school days. It feels wrong to head over now as if nothing has happened at all\u2026\u201dThe young men nudged one another, urging each other to make a move.Song Shiyu interrupted them and asked, \u201cYou mentioned that there was a chat group for such gatherings?\u201d\u201cThere is.\u201d The classmate who was being egged on by his companions nodded. \u201cBut I remembered that you aren\u2019t fond of being added into chat groups, so I didn\u2019t add you.\u201dSong Shiyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dHis silence left the other party confused about his intentions.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, senior? Did I recall wrongly?\u201dSong Shiyu lowered his eyes and took a sip of his drink before replying, \u201c\u2026 No, you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t like being added into chat groups.\u201dThe group quickly moved on to other topics. They continued chatting for a while longer before someone suddenly exclaimed with a suppressed voice, \u201cQuick, look over there!\u201dSong Shiyu subconsciously glanced in the direction where Ji Fanyin was seated.Zhao Qi and Ji Fanyin had taken out their phones to scan each other\u2019s WeChat QR codes. It seemed like they had decided to exchange contacts after hitting it off well.------Social media links:Discord: https://discord.gg/ATHVehx Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarveNovels/Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was all empty beneath that.\u201cI\u2019m not too fond of chatting,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin as she put away her phone. \u201cIs it not apparent?\u201dZhao Qi looked a bit nervous. \u201cAm I being too talkative?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll know if I\u2019m not interested in listening to you.\u201dJi Fanyin felt that Zhao Qi\u2019s frequent bouts of nervousness reminded her of a hamster.\u201cThere are times where I\u2019m terrible at reading the room. If I ever get too naggy, feel free to cut me off whenever you wish,\u201d said Zhao Qi earnestly.Amused by those words, Ji Fanyin chuckled softly. Her response caught Zhao Qi off guard, and his ears began turning red.\u201cI won\u2019t befriend someone I dislike,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with a smile.Zhao Qi\u2019s heart was finally put at ease. He took a look at his watch and exclaimed in surprise, \u201cWoah, we spoke for quite long! It\u2019s almost lunchtime now.\u201dRight after he said those words, a woman walked over and informed everyone that they could head in to have their meal.Ji Fanyin lowered her head slightly as she rose from her seat, and when she finally straightened up her posture, she casually tucked her long hair behind her shoulders.Song Shiyu couldn\u2019t help staring at her\u2014it was almost as if he was seeing Ji Xinxin chatting with someone else. His gaze was so searing that it nearly burned a hole through her.But Ji Fanyin chose to feign ignorance.It was not as if Song Shiyu was paying her now, so she couldn\u2019t be bothered to put on an act for him.As the crowd entered the Western restaurant, Zhao Qi naturally walked alongside Ji Fanyin and continued engaging her in conversation, though he was the one talking most of the time while she simply listened.When Ji Fanyin finally stopped at a random seat along the long table, someone else made use of this opportunity to pull out the chair for her. She shot a glance over and noted that the other party wasn\u2019t a waiter. So, she gave him a slight nod along with a word of thanks before taking the seat.She was too used to receiving such gestures to pay it much heed.Zhao Qi, however, shot a disgruntled look at the man who pulled out the chair for Ji Fanyin. The latter disregarded him and nonchalantly settled down right beside Ji Fanyin.Ji Fanyin was gracefully digging into her smoked salmon salad when she noticed that she was starting to become the most eye-catching figure at the table.It wasn\u2019t just the men at the table. Even the women gathered in their small groups were gossipping about her in a way that they themselves probably thought looked discreet.Ji Fanyin brushed this abnormal atmosphere aside while chewing on her smoked salmon.This is probably Ji Xinxin\u2019s problem. There\u2019s no need for me to get involved.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The serving time was inevitably slow due to the large number of guests.Ji Fanyin took her time with the food, and soon, they were serving the dessert. It was a slice of passion fruit cheesecake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. She took a bite of it and felt satisfaction rippling from the tip of her tongue.Delicious. I should drop by here the next time I have a break.Ji Fanyin was about to have her second bite when the person on her right pushed over an untouched slice of cake. She glanced over, and the man, who hadn\u2019t spoken over the entire course of the meal, said, \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201dJi Fanyin accepted the gift with a smile. \u201cThank you.\u201dZhao Qi quickly learned from example. \u201cIs the cake to your liking? I\u2019m not too fond of sweet stuff, so\u2026\u201d\u201cNo thanks. I\u2019ll feel cloyed if I have a third slice,\u201d Ji Fanyin rejected his goodwill.Zhao Qi shot a sharp glare at the man sitting on Ji Fanyin\u2019s right, only to be ignored once more.It was then that the organizer of this gathering, Cheng Lin, turned to her sisters around her and laughed, \u201cHow hilarious! Nowadays, all it takes is for a person to dress up a little to draw in men with bad eyes.\u201dJi Fanyin continued digging into her cake, not paying her any heed.Cheng Lin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe gritted her teeth and spoke in an even louder voice, \u201cIt sure is nice to have a pretty face.\u201dHer loud remark was met with a questioning look from Ji Fanyin, who seemed to be asking, \u2018Why are you speaking so loudly?\u2019 The expression on her face was so innocent that it looked as if she was truly intrigued by Cheng Lin\u2019s behavior.Cheng Lin couldn\u2019t take it any longer, so she stood up and confronted her, \u201cJi Fanyin, do you really need me to spell out your name?\u201dJi Fanyin blinked her eyes and asked, \u201cMy apologies, but you are\u2026?\u201d\u201cDrop the act!\u201d Cheng Lin slammed her spoon on the table. \u201cYou had the audacity to invite yourself to the gathering I proposed, but you don\u2019t even know who I am?\u201dJi Fanyin widened her eyes in realization. \u201cYou\u2019re the organizer? You have done an excellent job choosing the location. This restaurant has excellent food.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d replied Cheng Lin subconsciously.It took a second before she finally snapped out of it and roared furiously, \u201cWhy are you saying that? I\u2019m scolding you here!\u201dTowards that, Ji Fanyin replied, \u201cDid you scold me? You said that I have a pretty face.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Ji Xinxin\u2019s face!\u201d exclaimed Cheng Lin in displeasure.Ji Fanyin chuckled softly and said, \u201cYes, I do get commonly misrecognized as her.\u201dSong Shiyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dIs she talking about me here?\u201cI probably should mention that I\u2019m actually the older sister here,\u201d Ji Fanyin shook her little dessert spoon as she said. \u201cI\u2019m a day older than Xinxin.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a day older?\u201d asked Zhao Qi curiously.\u201cWe happened to be born around midnight. There was half an hour of difference between our times of birth,\u201d explained Ji Fanyin.The woman sitting opposite Ji Fanyin couldn\u2019t resist the urge to join the conversation, \u201cThat sounds amazing. Doesn\u2019t that mean your family celebrates for two consecutive days during your birthdays?\u201dAll of a sudden, Cheng Lin seemed to lose her presence amidst this discussion.\u201cThat\u2019s not it. We simply celebrate on her birthday,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin.Zhao Qi: \u201c\u2026\u201dCheng Lin: \u201c\u2026\u201dThat single response plunged everyone sitting at the long table into a state of awkwardness. They immediately understood the meaning behind those words. Even Song Shiyu\u2019s eyebrows furrowed together a little.No matter how he looked at it, this was simply too pitiful\u2026Ji Fanyin finished up her first slice of cake with eyes curled in delight before reaching for the second plate. \u201cI\u2019m the older one here after all. It\u2019s only right for me to give in to my younger sister.\u201c\u2026 I-is that how it is?\u201d asked Zhao Qi hesitantly.Cheng Lin slammed the table and shot to her feet, exclaiming, \u201c\u2026 Can\u2019t you learn to stand up for yourself?\u201dWith those words, she tossed her napkin aside and left the restaurant. Everyone looked at her in astonishment.Ji Fanyin watched her departing silhouette contemplatively.Looks like she doesn\u2019t bear any ill-will. She\u2019s just a candid person with a sharp mouth. This kind of people are often used as sacrificial pawns in imperial harem dramas.Cheng Lin\u2019s friends jumped to their feet and chased after her, leaving an awkward atmosphere lingering over the long table.Meanwhile, Ji Fanyin calmly finished her second slice of cake before heading to the cashier to foot the bill.Of course, she was only footing her portion.It was not easy to earn money after all. While spending money didn\u2019t affect the progress of the \u2018Temptation of Home\u2019 app, she wasn\u2019t intending to squander it off either.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Can I come with you?\u201dJi Fanyin pondered for a moment before honestly advising him against it, \u201cThe place where I\u2019m headed might not interest you.\u201dWhile she was researching the Western restaurant, she noticed that there was a video retail shop. With the onset of the Digital Age, video retail shops were disappearing at a frightening rate.As an actress herself, Ji Fanyin had the unsurprising hobby of collecting physical copies of movies. While most people filled their shelves with books, she filled hers with DVDs and tapes that included antiques and exclusives. From a collector\u2019s point of view, what she had was worth quite a sum\u2026\u2026 but of course, that was all in her previous life.She had checked the internet and found that despite both worlds sharing some similarities, this world seemed to have plenty of outstanding films that didn\u2019t exist in her previous world. The realization that there was a treasure trove here waiting to be uncovered filled her with excitement.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, I have a broad range of interests!\u201d declared Zhao Qi. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say whether I\u2019d like it or not without giving it a try.\u201dSeeing that Zhao Qi was going to the extent of abandoning his car by the roadside, Ji Fanyin felt that there was no reason for her to insist on rejecting him. \u201cAlright.\u201dThe video retail shop wasn\u2019t too far away\u2014it was only an overhead bridge and traffic light away\u2014so she made her way there on foot.Just thinking about how she would soon be immersed in an ocean of new films made her footsteps much lighter.But just as she was waiting for the traffic lights to turn green, she received a call from Song Shiyu. Her eyebrows raised a little as she picked up the call. \u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like seeing you dating another man using her face,\u201d said Song Shiyu over the phone. \u201cMeet me in half an hour\u2019s time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s impossible,\u201d Ji Fanyin rejected him right away. \u201cToday\u2019s my break day. You should make a reservation in advance if you wish to meet me.\u201d\u201cDo you really think you\u2019re that popular?\u201d mocked Song Shiyu. \u201cThe one Zhao Qi fancies is Xinxin!\u201dJi Fanyin wasn\u2019t bothered by his remark. She shot a glance at Zhao Qi before remarking with a heavier tone, \u201cDo you think that he would be the same as you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Song Shiyu fell silent, but Ji Fanyin was still able to hear his hastened breathing noises.Ji Fanyin chuckled softly. She reverted back to her original tone and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be putting my phone on silent mode after this call. Feel free to message me on WeChat if there\u2019s anything you need from me. I\u2019ll respond to you when I\u2019m free.\u201dShe politely waited for a few seconds in case Song Shiyu wanted to say anything before hanging up the phone.\u201cIt\u2019s green now, let\u2019s go.\u201d Zhao Qi seemed a little curious about the phone call. \u201cIs it a call from work?\u201dJi Fanyin switched the phone to silent mode before responding to Zhao Qi with a nod. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s from one of my wealthier clients.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Other than occasional calls for delivery, she didn\u2019t contact anyone.After watching all of the movies she had on hand in a single shot, she took a nice long nap before finally checking her phone.Zhao Qi knew that she was watching movies at home, so he dropped a few messages now and then to check if she was done going through them.There was a missed call from Ji Xinxin, who, as usual, left a voice message behind to ask if she was busy and when it would be convenient to call again.Two missed calls from telemarketers too.Song Shiyu had called her on the day of the gathering, but he didn\u2019t follow up with that.Well, that was basically how big Ji Fanyin\u2019s social circle was.She responded to Zhao Qi and Ji Xinxin\u2019s messages before stretching her back lazily to begin a new day.She was a little curious about Song Shiyu\u2019s unexpected silence, so she decided to access the profile page she had made for him to conduct an in-depth analysis.Song Shiyu could be considered as a mild perfectionist. He preferred to and would habitually display his flawless side to others, which made those around him think that he was perfect too.The problem was that there was no such thing as a perfect person in the world.It was normal for adults to socialize with others with a mask on their face, but Song Shiyu\u2019s mask was exceptionally thick. He refused to take it off even before the woman he loved.It was likely that he was afraid of how others would perceive him once they learned of his imperfections, and this feeling was even stronger when it came to Ji Xinxin.However, Ji Fanyin had given him the opportunity to allay his fears and immerse himself in the dream scenario where \u2018Ji Xinxin likes you even if you aren\u2019t perfect\u2019.It should be impossible for Song Shiyu to resist such a temptation.Is he busy with work?Ji Fanyin took a look at her bank balance and decided that it was time for her to expand her sources of income.It just so happened that Zhao Qi responded to her message and began sharing his thoughts on the movies. Quite a few movies that Ji Fanyin bought were recommended by him.After chatting for a while, Zhao Qi told her that a new movie had just reached the silver screen and invited her out to watch it on IMAX.Zhao Qi:\u3010If you don\u2019t mind, it\u2019ll be with a few of my other friends who are film buffs too\u3011Ji Fanyin accepted the offer since she didn\u2019t have any plans for the day.She didn\u2019t bother dolling herself up since it was just a trip to the cinema, putting on just a casual shirt and a pair of jeans before heading out. When she arrived at the cinema, she found that Zhao Qi was the only one there.Zhao Qi waved the four tickets in his hand with an awkward smile. \u201cThe other two said that they won\u2019t be joining us due to some urgent matters. It looks like we\u2019re the only ones here.\u201dJi Fanyin\u2019s eyebrows lifted a little. She was used to such petty tricks.It didn\u2019t really matter to her whether Zhao Qi was staging an act or that his two friends were trying to pair them up.\u201cIt would be a waste to miss the movie when we\u2019re already here,\u201d said Ji Fanyin as she made her way toward the concession stand. \u201cI\u2019ll get the snacks since you\u2019ve already paid for the tickets. What drink do you want?\u201dZhao Qi offered to pay, but he was unable to outtalk Ji Fanyin. In the end, they got a two person combo set.The movie was not bad, and Zhao Qi was a decent film watching partner too.When the credits scene finally rolled, the two of them began making their way out of the theater while amicably chatting about the movie. It was then that Ji Fanyin got a feeling that someone was spying on her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nevertheless, she was still able to fathom a guess about the culprit.There was one person who had declared that he would be \u2018keeping an eye on her\u2019 just a few days ago.Bai Zhou is the most likely suspect here. With his personality, it\u2019s not entirely impossible for him to pull off something like this.\u201cThe restaurant I told you about is just below this cinema. Shall we grab a bite? \u2026 Ji Fanyin?\u201d Zhao Qi called her.Ji Fanyin retracted her gaze and took a quick glance at her phone. Then, she replied, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I don\u2019t have work today anyway. Thanks for recommending this movie to me. I\u2019ll treat you for lunch.\u201dMost self-aware suitors understood the meaning behind a woman outright saying words like \u2018I\u2019ll treat you\u2019 or \u2018Let\u2019s go dutch\u2019.Zhao Qi touched his nose and asked hopefully, \u201cCan I treat you the next time?\u201d\u201cSure, if an opportunity allows.\u201dJi Fanyin didn\u2019t slam the lid entirely. It was not as if she was intending to live as a loner here. It would be good if she could make some friends too.The restaurant Zhao Qi spoke about was a Thai hotpot shop that opened just a few months back. It was extremely popular with many returning customers. Its spicy tom yum goong soup base brought out a nice kick to the seafood.Over the course of the meal, Ji Fanyin was finally able to locate the secret paparazzi with her sharp instincts. It wasn\u2019t Bai Zhou but a middle-aged man who looked average from head to toe.This middle-aged man entered the store alone shortly after the two of them. It was already weird that someone was having hotpot all on their own, but he was barely eating at all. The biggest giveaway though was him discreetly directing his phone in their direction and snapping a few shots.He must be the kind of PI who tracks down adultery.After footing the bill, Ji Fanyin slurped up the last bit of her ice-blended coconut drink before contemplating over what she should do next.\u201cShall I drive you home?\u201d asked Zhao Qi.\u201cI drove here,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin as she dangled her car keys before him.Zhao Qi looked at the logo on the car keys and frowned. \u201cIt might be rude of me to say this, but I\u2019ve been thinking about this ever since you mentioned your birthday in the previous gathering\u2026 I remember that Ji Xinxin drives a Porsche. Aren\u2019t your parents being a little too biased here?\u201d\u201cCars are just four-wheeled vehicles to me.\u201d Ji Fanyin began rising from her seat. \u201cAnything is fine as long as I can drive it around.\u201dAs stingy as Ji Fanyin\u2019s parents were, they still bought her a BMW worth 300,000 dollars sling with insurance. It wasn\u2019t as bad as Zhao Qi was making it out to be.Zhao Qi walked Ji Fanyin over to her car and paid her parking fees before waving her goodbye.Ji Fanyin intentionally drove slowly, and soon enough, she spotted a rundown gray car tailing her from a distance away. It should be safe to assume Bai Zhou was already aware of her meeting with Zhao Qi today by this point.What should I do next?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the end, she used her car\u2019s Bluetooth to call Song Shiyu. \u201cI\u2019m done with my work now. You called me a few days ago. Were you planning to make a reservation?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Song Shiyu\u2019s voice sounded deeper and less clearer than usual. \u201cWhat were you busy with? Flirting with other men?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any need for me to explain my private affairs to you,\u201d said Ji Fanyin as she reversed her car into an empty parking lot along the street. \u201cBut lest you think too much into it, I\u2019ll answer your question. I have no interest in romance at the moment.\u201dSong Shiyu fell silent.\u201cIt\u2019s 9 o\u2019clock,\u201d he said. \u201cMeet me at the bar right now.\u201dJi Fanyin gave the request some thought.Before she could use the same \u2018day off\u2019 excuse as she did the last time, Song Shiyu added, \u201cI\u2019ll pay you twofold.\u201dHe\u2019s offering a raise?Ji Fanyin took a look at the time and replied, \u201cThree hours.\u201d\u201cWhat about after midnight?\u201dJi Fanyin earnestly contemplated this problem and replied, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fivefold from 12 to 3 and tenfold from 3 to 9.\u201dShe needed ample rest, and working overtime ought to be compensated. How else would she find the motivation to work at such ungodly hours?Her extortionist prices convinced Song Shiyu not to extend the service duration.She grabbed her phone and said, \u201cSend me the address. I\u2019ll head over right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Song Shiyu fell silent for yet another brief moment before dropping her the name of a bar. \u201cFind your own way over.\u201dIs it that difficult for you to drop me a location pin?, Ji Fanyin thought.That being said, she still patiently looked up whatever she heard from Song Shiyu\u2019s unclear voice. It took a few tries before she finally found the bar on her GPS. She placed her phone back onto the holder and drove out of her parking spot.While she was making her way over, a message popped up on her phone. She shot it a glance and saw that Song Shiyu had sent the money over.Her eyes then drifted to the rearview mirror. The PI\u2019s rundown gray car was still trailing not too far behind her.She chuckled softly as she wondered how things would develop after this.I\u2019m getting a little excited. Well, life would be boring without a bit of spice every now and then, right?\u2026After parking his car, the PI immediately made a call to his client.\u201cMr Bai, there\u2019s a change in the situation. I reported to you earlier that Miss Ji was driving back to her apartment after parting ways with that man, but she suddenly stopped by the roadside for a few minutes before abruptly changing her path. She\u2019s now heading into a bar. I\u2019ve already sent the images to your inbox.\u201dOn the other end of the call, Bai Zhou had just finished working out. He placed his energy drink on the table and quickly opened his laptop. He clicked into the latest email and browsed through the attached pictures before asking, \u201cShe entered the bar alone?\u201d\u201cYes, but this bar is members exclusive. Based on our investigation, Miss Ji has never been there before. It\u2019s likely that she was invited by someone else.\u201dBai Zhou looked through the pictures once more, this time paying closer attention to the details aside from Ji Fanyin.Soon, his eyes fell upon one of the cars in the background of the parking lot, and he frowned.\u201cThat black Audi car parked in the VIP lot. What\u2019s its license plate number?\u201dThe PI quickly recited the car\u2019s license plate number.Bai Zhou remembered it was the same license plate number as the car that drove Ji Fanyin back to the Ji Residence just a few days ago. He eyed Ji Fanyin\u2019s silhouette in the photo and sneered coldly, \u201cFind out who the owner of the car is.\u201dHe then hung up the call and headed off to take a shower.Of course, there were ways for Bai Zhou to figure out who the owner of the car was, but the PIs had their own channels too. While it would take a bit of money, it would be much more convenient for him if this investigation didn\u2019t alarm anyone around him.Soon, he received a return call from the PI.\u201cMr Zhou, I\u2019ve managed to find the owner of the car.\u201dBai Zhou placed his phone on the table and switched it over to speaker mode before continuing to towel his damp hair. \u201cWho is it?\u201dThe PI sounded a little incredulous at what he had found too. \u201cSong Shiyu.\u201dBai Zhou\u2019s movements froze up. \u201cSomeone with the same name?\u201d\u201c\u2026 No, it\u2019s the Mr Song you know of.\u201dIt took Bai Zhou two seconds before it finally dawned on him what was happening. He spat out a vulgarity before furiously tossing the towel on the table.\u201cI\u2019ll be heading over right now. Keep a close eye on them. Inform me right away if any of them leaves the bar.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was one thing for Ji Fanyin to flirt with Ji Xinxin\u2019s university classmate, but to think that she would actually hook up with Song Shiyu too!This was the very Song Shiyu who had confessed his love to Ji Xinxin not too long ago!Bai Zhou was infuriated by the turn of affairs. Despite his still damp hair, he immediately climbed onto his motorcycle and sped his way toward the address sent to him by the PI. He looked almost like a cuckolded husband rushing to a hotel room to catch his adulterous wife in the act.At the entrance of the bar, a jacked bouncer stepped forward and stopped him. \"We don't allow minors in.\"Bai Zhou frowned. He snapped a shot of the bouncer's work pass and made a call.\"Hey, Hua Zi. Your family owns K+ Bar, right? Get one of your men to bring me in.\"It was not that Bai Zhou couldn't use an even more forceful method to barge in, but that would have been too conspicuous. He didn't want to risk having Song Shiyu and Ji Fanyin learn of his arrival and make an escape in advance. That would render his trip futile.So, he made a call to an acquaintance, a 'young master' whom he remembered was affiliated with this bar, instead.Soon, a manager dressed in a suit walked out to bring him in.The manager welcomed Bai Zhou with a warm smile. \"It's an honor to have you here with us today, young master Bai. Would you like me to prepare a compartment room for you today?\"\"I'm here to find someone,\" said Bai Zhou coldly as he glanced at the intoxicated gents and ladies sitting inside the bar. \"Where's Song Shiyu?\"The manager was a little taken aback by that question. He asked carefully, \"You're here to find Mr Song?\"\"That's right. Did a beautiful lady enter this bar a moment ago to look for him?\" sneered Bai Zhou.Realization struck the manager.Ah, he has been cuckolded and is here to catch the adulterous couple. Looks like money isn\u2019t enough to retain the heart of a woman.With such thoughts in mind, he said, \"Mr Bai, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t divulge our customer\u2019s information to you. Why don\u2019t I get someone to\u2026\u201dBai Zhou was in no mood to listen to his rambles. \u201cI\u2019m already being very patient here. Don\u2019t test me.\u201dThe manager was put on the spot. He hesitated for a moment before saying, \u201cMr Song is someone whom we can\u2019t afford to offend. Why don\u2019t I bring you to the CCTV room to take a look instead? You can talk to Mr Song once they are done with their meeting. What do you think?\u201dBai Zhou was so anxious to see what shady stuff Song Shiyu and Ji Fanyin were up to that he agreed to the plan right away.The manager heaved a sigh of relief before bringing Bai Zhou over to the CCTV room.Humans tended to lose their rationality when drunk, so bars had to be filled with CCTV cameras as a security measure. There was no way a bar as well-known as K+ would slip up on this aspect.The CCTV room was much quieter than the outside. Bai Zhou walked up to the cluster of screens and began browsing through them to look for Song Shiyu and Ji Fanyin.The manager was much more experienced than him. It took him only a brief moment before he pointed to one of the screens and said, \u201cThere.\u201dBai Zhou immediately turned his gaze over. The image was slightly blurry, but he could tell right away that the duo sitting side by side in the compartment room were none other than Ji Fanyin and Song Shiyu.They were really meeting up here!Bai Zhou\u2019s first instinct was to rush into the compartment room and beat them up, but he suddenly thought of something.Since Song Shiyu has demeaned his feelings for big sis by projecting it onto Ji Fanyin instead, that would make him unqualified to court her anymore. Even if he\u2019s just fooling around for the time being, it would still affect big sis\u2019 impression of him once she learns about this.I shouldn\u2019t interrupt them. Instead, I should let them meet up with one another more often and capture more evidence of their affair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was no way Song Shiyu would be able to talk his way out of this with such concrete evidence.The manager stood quietly behind Bai Zhou, pretending as if he couldn\u2019t see anything at all.A while later, Bai Zhou started to feel a little exhausted. He pulled a chair over and took a seat, seemingly resolved to camp it out here. At the same time, he instructed the manager, \u201cBring me something to drink.\u201dThe two of them are likely going to be in there for an hour at minimum. I can\u2019t miss even a single frame of them.The manager quickly brought a few bottles of beer over. Bai Zhou popped one open and began gulping it down while staring intently at the screen.As he looked at the footage, he started feeling a sense of incongruence.Why do Ji Fanyin\u2019s movements and gestures resemble big sis so much?!\u2026\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t drink so much. It\u2019s not good for your body,\u201d Ji Fanyin advised.She could already tell that Song Shiyu was slightly intoxicated over the phone, and it didn\u2019t seem like he had stopped drinking while she was making her way over. Even under the dim lights of the compartment room, it was obvious that his face was reddened.Of course, she wouldn\u2019t mind if Song Shiyu were to knock himself out\u2014that would be extremely convenient for her.It was just that \u2018Ji Xinxin\u2019 would try to stop him.Song Shiyu was currently drinking a bottle of Hennessy. There was a pail filled with ice on the table, but he hadn\u2019t even bothered to touch it at all. He poured the 40% brandy into his cup and downed it over and over again as if it was no more than iced red tea.He was just about to pour his next cup when Ji Fanyin suddenly moved the wine bottle away from him. She asked softly, \u201cIf there\u2019s something on your mind, why don\u2019t you tell me about it? I might not be able to solve your problems, but it\u2019ll at least make you feel better.\u201dWhen Song Shiyu\u2019s outreached hand failed to grab hold of the wine bottle, he raised his head to look at Ji Fanyin. He listened quietly to her words before suddenly asking a seemingly unrelated question, \u201c\u2026 Why did you have to go to France?\u201dNeedless to say, it\u2019s because she\u2019d already had her fair share of fun rearing fishes here, so she decided to expand her fishery business overseas.Ji Fanyin smiled softly. While passing Song Shiyu a glass of water, she circumvented the question and replied, \u201cAren\u2019t I here with you now?\u201dSong Shiyu didn\u2019t accept the glass of water. He obstinately asked the same question again, \u201cWhy did you go to France?\u201dRealizing that he wouldn\u2019t let this matter rest until he received his answer, Ji Fanyin took some time to ponder before answering, \u201cThere are too many incredible people around me. I wish to become as incredible as them\u2026 as incredible as you. I don\u2019t want to be left in the dust. I don\u2019t want to just watch your backs from behind.\u201d\u201c\u2026 But all I can see now is your back.\u201dSong Shiyu snatched the wine bottle over and silently poured himself half a cup. He raised his head and gulped it down.\u201cAren\u2019t I already back now?\u201d Ji Fanyin sighed softly. \u201cAre you unwilling to wait for me?\u201dSong Shiyu raised his head and looked at her with sombreness in his eyes. \u201cWhy should I wait for someone who doesn\u2019t even like me?\u201dHow would I know what you all are thinking of? Even elementary schoolers nowadays know that spare tyres are doomed to end in tragedy!\u201cIf you have feelings for me too, I\u2019m more than willing to wait for you.\u201d Song Shiyu stared at her intently. \u201cBut only if you do.\u201dJi Fanyin met his eyes with an enigmatic smile sitting on her lips. \u201cYou wish for me to reciprocate your feelings?\u201dSong Shiyu twirled the wine cup on the table before finally making up his mind. He nodded affirmatively and said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dHe paused for a moment before adding, \u201cI want Ji Xinxin to like Song Shiyu.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She bit her lips softly for a moment before she finally found the courage to reveal her feelings. \u201c\u2026 I like you too. It\u2019s just that my studies are also important to me. I want to be able to stand alongside you as an equal. Can you forgive me for my selfishness?\u201dSong Shiyu\u2019s slightly intoxicated eyes seemed to gleam even brighter than before.\u201cHow could I possibly stay angry at you?\u201d he said with a deep sigh. \u201cI feel like I\u2019d even forget my own name with just a smile from you.\u201dPerhaps it was because his greatest woe had been temporarily resolved, Song Shiyu soon fell asleep on the sofa.It wasn\u2019t midnight yet, so Ji Fanyin poured herself a cup of water and waited patiently beside Song Shiyu for the strike of midnight.Most people would instinctively reach for their phones when they had nothing to do, but Ji Fanyin quietly swirled the glass of water in her hand, seemingly hatching a devious plan.During this period of time, Song Shiyu mumbled some sleep talk, but Ji Fanyin gently loosened the tight wrinkles on his forehead and whispered softly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry and sleep. I\u2019m right beside you.\u201dThe semi-conscious Song Shiyu tried to grab her hand, but she skillfully dodged it.Soon, the countdown alarm rang.Ji Fanyin quickly took out her phone and silenced the alarm. Thanks to her swift response, Song Shiyu wasn\u2019t jolted awake by the noise.Now that her working hours were finally over, her expression immediately loosened up. She leaned back on to the sofa leisurely and pressed the service button to settle the bill.As a special service for an important client, the least she could do for him was to pay on his behalf first and put it on his tab. Otherwise, she would have to go through the trouble of reaching into his pocket and grabbing his wallet.\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d The waiter was at a loss for words upon realizing that Ji Fanyin was intending to abandon her companion and leave alone. \u201cWhat about Mr Song\u2026\u201d\u201cCall a valet for him. You can put it under his tab; he won\u2019t shirk payment,\u201d said Ji Fanyin. \u201cDo you know where he lives? I can give you his address if you need it.\u201dShe spoke with such natural grace that the waiter went along with her without any hesitation, almost as if it was the most natural thing in the world.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, we do have the addresses of our members in the system\u2026\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Ji Fanyin directed a nod toward the waiter. Before walking out of the compartment room, she shot a meaningful look at the CCTV camera.As soon as she walked out, Bai Zhou charged out of the CCTV room to chase after her. However, he\u2019d had too much to drink and found himself unable to walk straight. In the end, he only managed to stop her right after she got into her car.Ji Fanyin was in the midst of putting on the seatbelt when he knocked on her door. She lowered her car windows and asked calmly, \u201cYoung master Bai, you came here for a drink too?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t put on that innocent act with me,\u201d sneered Bai Zhou. He dangled his phone before her and said, \u201cI\u2019ve already recorded the little tryst you had with Song Shiyu earlier.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Ji Fanyin chuckled softly. \u201cWhat did you manage to get on camera?\u201dBai Zhou clicked his tongue disdainfully. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone as desperate as you to become a substitute. What can Song Shiyu give you? You should know better than anyone that the one he likes isn\u2019t you.\u201d\u201cHe can give me money.\u201d Ji Fanyin was amused by the question from the young lad. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you the other day that I was working?\u201dAfter saying her piece, Ji Fanyin lightly pushed off the arm Bai Zhou was resting on her lowered car window. The latter immediately retracted his arm upon her touch, almost as if he was disgusted by her. This allowed her to roll up her car window.With a smile, she bade him farewell with a wave of her hand, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a breach of my professionalism to compromise the privacy of my client. You should ask Song Shiyu if you\u2019re that curious.\u201dWord-of-mouth advertising from a satisfied customer would be far more effective than a shameless self-promotion, right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He opened his eyes right away, but he was still a little out of it due to the influence of alcohol. He wiped off the water on his face and slicked his wet hair backward before asking instinctively, \u201cWhere\u2019s Xinxin?\u201d\u201cIt goes without saying that big sis is in Paris,\u201d sneered Bai Zhou.Song Shiyu raised his gaze to stare at Bai Zhou, who looked as if he was about to beat him up at any moment, but he remained oddly composed. \u201cYou still found out about it in the end. The rest of you should head out first. I\u2019ll have a private chat with him.\u201dThe latter half of his words were directed at the manager and waiter standing nervously by the doorway, as if worried that a fight would break out between the two of them.The manager quickly ushered the waiter out before closing the door behind them.With that, the only ones left in the compartment room were Song Shiyu and Bai Zhou.Song Shiyu began speaking with a slow cadence, \u201cHumans tend to raise pets when they feel lonely. Similarly, I\u2019m using Ji Fanyin to assuage my yearning for Xinxin while she\u2019s away. You have seen her face too. Identical twins tend to look different once they grow up, but the two of them still remain perfect copies of one another.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s none of my business,\u201d replied Bai Zhou coldly. \u201cI already have evidence in hand. If you know what\u2019s best for you, you\u2019d do well not to show up before big sis ever again!\u201dSong Shiyu looked at Bai Zhou and chuckled. His attitude was reminiscent of a mature adult dealing with someone who had barely come of age. \u201cJi Fanyin is a skilled actor. She\u2019s able to make me feel like Xinxin is right beside me. On top of that, she\u2019s also sharp-witted and knows what I want to hear. Could there possibly be a better pet than that in the world?\u201dSong Shiyu ignored the look on Bai Zhou\u2019s face and gestured welcomingly toward him.\u201cI advise you to give it a try too. You\u2019ll enjoy it. I\u2019ll even keep the secret for you.\u201dBai Zhou looked at Song Shiyu as if he was unrecyclable trash.A few minutes later, the hot-headed youth spat on the ground and stomped out of the room.Song Shiyu didn\u2019t stop him. Instead, he slumped onto the sofa and lit a cigarette. He lifted his head upward and slowly breathed out a long trail of smoke.Since he found out about it, I can drag him down with me and turn him into an accomplice. Otherwise, he might really tell Xinxin about it.\u2026Ji Fanyin felt no guilt whatsoever for abandoning Song Shiyu in the bar. It was not as if the bar would let anything happen to a valuable VIP of theirs, and Bai Zhou was there to \u2018keep him accompanied\u2019 too.Feeling that she had worked hard for the day, she quickly removed her makeup as soon as she reached home before sinking into her bed.The following day, Ji Fanyin realized that her phone had received several calls in its \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 mode. They were all from the same number.She ignored them and headed into the bathroom to wash up. Afterward, she moved into the kitchen to prepare some scrambled eggs for breakfast when she got a call from the same number again. It looked like the caller had no plans of giving it a rest until she finally picked up.While scrambling the eggs with a spatula in one hand, she used her other free hand to grab her phone and accept the call. With a casual voice, she said, \u201cHello?\u201dThe person on the other end of the call hissed in hostility, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201dAh, Bai Zhou.\u201cIt seems like you have gotten the wrong number. Goodbye,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with an unbothered tone.\u201cCut the act!\u201d Bai Zhou wasn\u2019t fooled by her. \u201cI already know about your affair with Song Shiyu!\u201dThose words were spoken like a menacing threat, but they seemed to fall short when it came to Ji Fanyin. \u201cYes, what about it?\u201d\u201cDoes your family know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d\u201cTheir views mean nothing to me.\u201d\u201cWhat about your younger sister?\u201d\u201cTell her if you wish to. I don\u2019t mind.\u201dBai Zhou fell silent after asking a few meaningless questions.

What\u2019s your email? I\u2019ll send the price list to you.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a price list?!\u201d exclaimed Bai Zhou. \u201cJi Fanyin, do you really think that you\u2019re running a business here?\u201d\u201cActing is a perfectly normal job,\u201d Ji Fanyin earnestly corrected his views. \u201cI\u2019m only selling my skills here, not my body.\u201dBai Zhou couldn\u2019t be bothered with Ji Fanyin\u2019s explanation. There was a moment of silence before he said, \u201cI\u2019ve sent you my email.\u201dJi Fanyin switched off the stove and placed her spatula aside. She attached her newly updated price list and client questionnaire onto an email before sending it over to Bai Zhou.Bai Zhou didn\u2019t hang up the phone, so she could hear the notification sound of a newly arrived email coming from his laptop, followed by a click.A few minutes later, he lashed out furiously, \u201c100,000 dollars for an hour? Why don\u2019t you go rob a bank instead? Do you think that you\u2019re worthy of such a price?\u201dJi Fanyin pondered for a moment before offering additional benefits, \u201cI can give you a 10% discount for your first hour.\u201d\u201cNo discounts!\u201d Bai Zhou was almost screaming at the top of his lungs. \u201cAren\u2019t you lowering big sis\u2019 value over here?\u201dJi Fanyin\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cSure.\u201dBai Zhou hesitated for a moment before asking, \u201cWho else other than Song Shiyu has bought you?\u201d\u201cThat would be a breach of privacy for my other clients. I trust that you wouldn\u2019t want me to reveal any of your details to others either,\u201d said Ji Fanyin. \u201cDo you wish to make a reservation for today?\u201dBai Zhou didn\u2019t respond for a long time.Ji Fanyin didn\u2019t rush him. She calmly placed the call on speakerphone and set it aside. She proceeded to finish cooking her scrambled eggs and plated it nicely.It was while she was carrying her breakfast platter and her phone to her dining room that Bai Zhou finally spoke up.\u201cTonight,\u201d he said quickly, \u201c5 to 8. I\u2019ll send you the location. Make sure no one sees you.\u201d\u201cPayment has to be made beforehand in order to confirm the reservation,\u201d reminded Ji Fanyin.Bai Zhou hung up the phone without saying a word.Ji Fanyin saved his number in her contacts and moved it into her \u2018Client\u2019 group. Soon, she received the address for tonight\u2019s reservation and a completed questionnaire.It was a good start to her morning, and she began digging into her breakfast.As expected of the young master of the Bai Family. He does have quite a bit of cash on him despite his young age.Bai Zhou\u2019s hot-headedness was also a huge advantage to her. Rather than money, it was likely that he would be a fountain of endless Emotion Points.As for the reservation later in the night, there was a good chance that Bai Zhou had ulterior motives. He probably wanted to either gather some evidence of her business or pick faults with her.But this was of no importance.The fish has swum over on his own accord to bite onto my hook; how could I possibly let him get away?After finishing up his breakfast, Ji Fanyin placed her plates in the dishwasher. Following that, she spent her remaining morning and half of her afternoon studying up on Bai Zhou.She needed to get a good grasp on her client in order to score a victory, not to mention that Bai Zhou was planning to crash her dojo here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was quite expensive to dine here, but the restaurant did a good job with its privacy measures. Thanks to that, it attracted quite a few celebrities to dine here.Ji Fanyin informed the front reception of the reserved compartment room, and a waiter soon led her in.It was a six person compartment room, but Bai Zhou was the only one in there. He was holding his phone horizontally in his hands, playing a game with his earpiece on. His right leg was crossed over his left one as he shook it casually, making him appear like a delinquent.Even when he heard the sound of the door opening, all he did was to spare a nonchalant glance over.When he caught sight of the person standing by the doorway, he froze up for several seconds right away. The first thing he did upon snapping out of his daze was to put his leg down and call out hesitantly, \u201cBig sis?\u201dHis teammates were shouting at him over the earpiece, but his mind automatically filtered those out. The character he was controlling ended up getting hacked down by his enemies within a few seconds, but he was in no state of mind to bother with that.A split moment later, he threw his phone on the ground and cursed, \u201cYou don\u2019t look like her at all!\u201dThe woman standing by the doorway looked at him doubtfully and asked, \u201cLook like who?\u201dThe truth was that Bai Zhou didn\u2019t believe what Song Shiyu said the previous night. He thought that the latter had simply lost his mind after Ji Xinxin left for Paris.Who doesn\u2019t know what kind of person Ji Fanyin is? There\u2019s no comparing her and my big sis, alright!Bai Zhou had made a reservation with Ji Fanyin with the intention to pick faults at her acting and humiliate her, but within a minute of their meeting, he realized that he wasn\u2019t able to find any faults with her at all.It was as if Ji Xinxin was standing right before him.It\u2019s no wonder why Song Shiyu would\u2026Damn.Bai Zhou suddenly felt a sense of crisis. Unwilling to let Ji Fanyin win, he betrayed his conscience and overthrew everything that he had said earlier. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like her at all! Big sis wouldn\u2019t\u2026 wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201dHe ended up getting stuck because there was simply nothing for him to pick at.Ji Fanyin walked up to Bai Zhou, bent down, and leaned in close to him. The latter was so nervous that he subconsciously held his breath and leaned back a little.\u201cHaven\u2019t I told you many times?\u201d She lightly poked Bai Zhou\u2019s forehead with her finger and sighed softly. \u201cLook at the dark circles around your eyes. Did you stay up late to play games again? You need to sleep early, or else you\u2019ll never grow tall\u2026\u201dBai Zhou subconsciously grumbled in retort, \u201cI\u2019m already a grown-up now! I\u2019m 1.83, an entire head taller than you\u2026\u201dBut his words screeched to a halt halfway through. He closed his eyes tightly before bellowing with utmost frustration, \u201cJi Fanyin!\u201dJi Fanyin didn\u2019t react at all despite having her name called out loud. Instead, she remarked in discontentment, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for us to have a meal together, but you\u2019re only going to talk about someone else to me?\u201dThere were countless vulgarities that Bai Zhou really wanted to utter at this very moment, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to voice them aloud when he saw Ji Fanyin\u2019s face.It feels almost like I\u2019m insulting big sis here!\u201cI\u2019m not going to bother with you anymore if you throw another tantrum,\u201d said Ji Fanyin sternly. \u201cShall I leave right now and let you eat on your own?\u201dBai Zhou raised his head to look at her.It was utterly ridiculous. Be it her appearance, expressions, or even eyes, he couldn\u2019t find any incongruence at all. Had he not paid 300,000 dollars to reserve Ji Fanyin\u2019s time, he would have really thought that Ji Xinxin had specially flown back from Paris to meet him.Despite knowing that this was a show staged by Ji Fanyin\u2026Despite the sheer disgust he felt when he learned that Song Shiyu was seeking Ji Fanyin for comfort\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d said Bai Zhou. \u201cAccompany. Me. For. Dinner.\u201dAs if he was throwing a tantrum at himself, he forcefully dragged the chair beside him out with a loud screeching sound and slammed the menu down on the table.Ji Fanyin finally took a seat and complimented him, \u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter what Ji Xinxin was scheming, her attitude toward Bai Zhou\u2014at least on the surface\u2014was made extremely clear: I view Bai Zhou as my younger brother.This made things convenient for Ji Fanyin. It meant that it was fine for her to berate him whenever he acted out of line since it was normal for an older sister to keep her unruly younger brother in line. Bai Zhou had also grown accustomed to this interaction too. In fact, he even thought that this was how she expressed her concern for him.Bai Zhou was unnaturally quiet throughout the dinner. Ji Fanyin had to bring up the conversation topics to avoid the air growing too awkward while he simply went along with the flow. It was clear that he hadn\u2019t gotten used to this service yet.Ji Fanyin kept piling up food in his bowl, specifically picking out the ones that Bai Zhou liked. He didn\u2019t say anything about it, but he still obediently ate everything that she put in his bowl.It was when he finally put down his chopsticks that he suddenly asked, \u201cIs this how you behave when you\u2019re with Song Shiyu too?\u201dDespite the rude words, Bai Zhou\u2019s attitude was considered friendly compared to how he usually acted.\u201cShiyu?\u201d Ji Fanyin rested her chin on her hand leisurely as she poured a cup of tea for Bai Zhou and pushed it over to his side. \u201cWell\u2026 the two of you are different.\u201d\u201c\u2026 In what ways?\u201d Bai Zhou eyed the cup of tea sitting right before him. The water was clear with only three to four pieces of tea leaves floating around\u2014just the way he liked it.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Ji Fanyin half-jokingly kept him in suspense as she murmured contemplatively. \u201cI wonder how the two of you are different.\u201d\u201cDid Song Shiyu tell you to become his lover?\u201dJi Fanyin sighed softly, almost as if she was dealing with a kid throwing a tantrum here. \u201cYou know that I\u2019ve already rejected him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked!\u201d Bai Zhou glared at Ji Fanyin sharply. \u201cIs this how you act during your meetings with him too?\u201dJi Fanyin chose not to respond to the question. She leaned her head on her arm and looked right into Bai Zhou\u2019s eyes with a gentle smile sitting on her lips.After ten seconds of eye contact, Bai Zhou\u2019s ears began reddening, and his eyes started to swim around nervously.He clenched his jaws in frustration before jerking his head away. \u201cHow did that idiot Song Shiyu get duped by your face? You don\u2019t even hold a candle to big sis at all!\u201dJi Fanyin responded to his remark by patting his head, but the latter smacked her hand away.\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d said Bai Zhou contemptuously. \u201cYou like Song Shiyu. You wish to remain by his side even as a substitute. You put on this facade in order to convince him and yourself that it\u2019s all just business.\u201dJi Fanyin thought that Bai Zhou had a truly imaginative mind.\u201cBut I\u2019m not like Song Shiyu. I know who\u2019s the one I love, and there are no substitutes for her,\u201d declared Bai Zhou. \u201cHowever, I\u2019d more than welcome it if you can really steal Song Shiyu away from big sis. I\u2019d have one less rival to deal with.\u201dThat\u2019s true, Ji Fanyin thought, but that won\u2019t happen.She had no intention of getting together with Song Shiyu. If she really wanted to look for a life partner, she would very much rather go for a boyfriend with a pure heart who didn\u2019t have anyone he fancied yet.\u201cI don\u2019t need you to impersonate big sis and pretend to be her,\u201d said Bai Zhou as he rose to his feet. He impatiently kicked away a chair blocking his way. \u201cIf we ever meet under any setting, you better not try to approach me. You may only talk to me if I talk to you first, do you understand?\u201dJi Fanyin thought that it was much less troublesome that way. She would be spared from having to think up lines on the spot for him, and her pay would still be the same anyway.Nothing lost.So, she nodded with a smile and replied, \u201cSounds good to me.\u201d\u201cGet up.\u201d There was finally a satisfied look on Bai Zhou\u2019s face. \u201cWe still have time left.

Unfortunately, Bai Zhou happened to see it.\u201cCut the crap and do what you\u2019re paid to,\u201d he muttered angrily as he pushed Ji Fanyin into the booth.Ji Fanyin sat dignified on the chair inside and curiously pressed a few buttons.God knows how long it has been since I last touched a neoprint machine.The long-legged Bai Zhou squeezed in right after, but he ended up looking a little awkward as his tall stature left him with hardly any space to place his legs between the chair and the screen.Neoprint booths were known to be cramped, but despite two grown adults stuffing themselves in, they still somehow managed to create two fists worth of awkward space in between them.\u201cHow do you want to take the picture?\u201d Ji Fanyin courteously enquired about her client\u2019s request.Bai Zhou cleared his throat and said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk. Just listen to my instructions.\u201dHe first paid for the machine by scanning its QR code before smacking the buttons haphazardly. What eventually came out was a photo of the two of them sitting rigidly before the camera. The distance between the two of them was too conspicuous to ignore.Bai Zhou looked at the neoprint and frowned in extreme discontentment.\u201cWould you like my help?\u201d Ji Fanyin kindly offered for the second time.She could tell that Bai Zhou was a newbie with neoprint booths.\u201cNo need!\u201d Bai Zhou snapped angrily. \u201cSit closer to me!\u201dJi Fanyin inched over as he had told her to, but before she could get within a fist\u2019s distance of him, he had already started shifting away himself. It was just that there wasn\u2019t much space for him to retreat to. He ended up being awkwardly squeezed to the corner of the seat with a stiff look on his face.Ji Fanyin thought that his reddened face looked rather interesting, so she clicked on the \u2018Snap Photo\u2019 button.It was also at the same time that Bai Zhou couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and pushed Ji Fanyin away from him, whispering fiercely, \u201cDon\u2019t get so close to me!\u201dSo, Ji Fanyin backed away a bit and raised her hands in surrender. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get too close or stay too far. Why don\u2019t you tell me where I should sit instead?\u201dBai Zhou pointed to the camera and grumbled, \u201cYour hand gesture.\u201dJi Fanyin glanced at his posture and was immediately amused by the \u2018V\u2019 hand gesture he was putting up. She copied what he was doing, but it was starting to get hard for her to suppress her laughter anymore.Is this how middle schoolers date?\u201cStop laughing!\u201d roared Bai Zhou.So, Ji Fanyin finally reined in her laughter and looked at the camera.An actor had to be able to bring out different dispositions regardless of the facial features they were born with. Ji Fanyin was able to play Ji Xinxin\u2019s character, but her facial features were actually not the gentle type.Her sharp eyebrows and plump lips made her look cold and lofty whenever she wasn\u2019t smiling.Bai Zhou stared at the screen over and over again, but he simply couldn\u2019t help but feel like something was very wrong here. He was intending to use Ji Fanyin\u2019s face to take a photo of him and Ji Xinxin so that he could stash it away.The problem was that Ji Fanyin felt completely different from Ji Xinxin the moment she dropped her act.What\u2019s the use of taking this photo if the two of them don\u2019t feel like the same person?!Bai Zhou took in a deep breath and said, \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind. Continue your act.\u201dJi Fanyin sighed softly before abruptly placing her arm on Bai Zhou\u2019s shoulder, saying, \u201cLook at me.\u201dBai Zhou\u2019s eyes swam around for a bit before finally looking at Ji Fanyin straight in the face. He stared at her intently, but at the same time, it looked like he was struggling with it too.Ji Fanyin smoothly raised her hand to brush Bai Zhou\u2019s hair to the side while quickly snapping a few consecutive shots. Before Bai Zhou could even process what was going on, everything had already ended.He was just about to blow his top when Ji Fanyin picked up the neoprints and showed it to him, asking, \u201cHow is it?\u201dBai Zhou\u2019s was immediately drawn to the couple reflected in the neoprints. He stared at it for a long moment before abruptly snatching it over and stowing it into his pocket. \u201cSo-so. Let\u2019s continue.\u201dHe seemed to have gotten completely addicted, paying again and again to take more photos.------Yoo hang out with us in our Discord~ Got a neat community there (well, admittedly they are all tyrant readers), but it would be nice to have more people around to chat about professional stand-in too!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She calmly showed him the time on her watch and said, \u201cYour reservation has to come to an end.\u201dIt was now 8 o\u2019clock. Even the most luxurious pumpkin carriage would have to disappear once her service came to an end.Bai Zhou: \u201c\u2026\u201dThere was a nasty look on his face, reminiscent of a kid who got his gaming console confiscated before he could save his progress.Ji Fanyin took out her phone and killed the alarm before turning her body toward Bai Zhou. Her action caused their knees to inevitably knock together in the narrow neoprint booth.Bai Zhou immediately darted backward as if he had gotten something dirty on him, shouting, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cI would appreciate it if you would let me pass,\u201d said Ji Fanyin politely. \u201cI have a facial at eight-thirty. I don\u2019t like to be late for my appointments.\u201dShe gestured toward the doorway of the narrow neoprint booth with a glance.There was only one way out of this neoprint booth, and Bai Zhou was blocking it with his huge body. How was she supposed to leave if he didn\u2019t give way?\u201cOr do you not want me to go?\u201d she casually teased.Those words were effective at provoking Bai Zhou. He shot a vicious glare at Ji Fanyin before rising to his feet and striding out.While walking off, he didn\u2019t forget to turn around and threaten her, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare utter a word about what happened today to anyone else. Otherwise, I\u2019ll let you know what regret is!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I am a professional.\u201d Ji Fanyin was unfazed by Bai Zhou\u2019s threat. She tidied up her slightly messy hair a little before adding on, \u201cNo one will know unless you tell others on your own accord like Song Shiyu.\u201dBai Zhou felt contempt for the false strong front she was putting on. \u201cYou need not put on such an act. There\u2019s no one who doesn\u2019t know that you like Song Shiyu.\u201dJi Fanyin wasn\u2019t too bothered by the rumors, so she replied casually, \u201cTreat it as if I\u2019m defending the final shreds of my dignity then.\u201dBai Zhou harrumphed coldly. He wanted to scorn her, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to voice out the insults lingering at the tip of his tongue. In the end, he turned around and strode off.With a whole stash of cute neoprints he had in his aviator jacket, that was.Ji Fanyin was about to call a cab to head to her facial appointment when she noticed that there was a missed call on her phone. It was from Song Shiyu.The call had only lasted a second, which explained why she didn\u2019t hear it during her appointment with Bai Zhou. When a call was hung up within a second, it could only mean that the caller regretted his decision right away.Ji Fanyin gave the matter some thought before sending him a message to ask him if he had business with her.However, a red exclamation mark appeared beside the message she sent on. Beneath it was a notification stating that they weren\u2019t friends yet and needed to add one another as contacts in order to chat.Ji Fanyin immediately understood why Song Shiyu hadn\u2019t contacted her through WeChat for a while now.She fiddled with her phone for a moment before nonchalantly closing her WeChat, choosing to feign ignorance about this.Since Song Shiyu wasn\u2019t saying anything about it, she couldn\u2019t be bothered to deal with it.Shortly after, a call from Bai Zhou came in.The moment Ji Fanyin picked up the call, the hot-headed youth immediately spoke with a commanding voice, \u201cI forgot to tell you. I want a day of your time tomorrow. I\u2019ll send the money to you later on.\u201dHe hung up right after saying what he wanted.His attitude was horrible, but Ji Fanyin was willing to overlook her client\u2019s awful temper in view of the 1,500,000 dollars that just arrived in her account.Interestingly, just a few seconds later, Song Shiyu\u2019s call came in as well.\u201cDid Bai Zhou look for you?\u201d Song Shiyu got straight to the point.Ji Fanyin stepped onto the escalator as she returned the question with a smile, \u201cWeren\u2019t you the one who told him about it?\u201dSong Shiyu chose not to answer the question. \u201cAccompany me for dinner tomorrow.\u201d\u201cMy apologies. I have just received a reservation,\u201d Ji Fanyin turned him down.Song Shiyu was silent for a few seconds before asking, \u201cWas it Bai Zhou?\u201dJi Fanyin didn\u2019t answer his question, but it didn\u2019t seem like Song Shiyu really needed an answer anyway. He hung up the phone a few seconds after asking that question.Meanwhile, Ji Fanyin slipped her phone back into her pocket as she began considering additions to her business model.If clashes in appointments occur more often in the future, should I consider introducing a bidding system?------Yoo hang out with us in our Discord~ Got a neat community there (well, admittedly they are all tyrant readers), but it would be nice to have more people around to chat about professional stand-in too!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She made it for her facial appointment on time and returned home with a glowing complexion.Out of consideration of the work she had the following day, she didn\u2019t take up treatments that required a healing period, choosing to go with just a simple moisturizing treatment.She could afford to pamper herself a little since whatever she spent on beauty would only amount to a small proportion of her earnings.Before heading to sleep, she took a look at the progress of \u2018Temptation of Home\u2019.Ever since she got involved with Bai Zhou, the amounts that had been coming in became slightly more erratic. After a week of hard work, she managed to earn her first 10,000,000.Most of it came from Emotion Points, but she did manage to earn 4,000,000 dollars of hard cash.It was nothing much compared to the assets Ji Fanyin owned in the past, but considering the short period of time she took to accrue this money\u2026Yeap, it\u2019s still pretty acceptable.It was just that she had to make sure to tread carefully when expanding her client\u2019s list. While it was another person\u2019s pond she was harvesting from here, it would still look awful if she flopped.Earning ten billion in \u2018Temptation of Home\u2019 didn\u2019t seem to be an unreachable target for the time being, not to mention that there was no deadline here.She knew that this stand-in job was only temporary, and it would only last for so long. Nevertheless, as long as she proceeded carefully and lived for another few decades, it was only a matter of time before she raked in the required sum to return back to her original world.She switched her phone to \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 mode and lay down on her pillow. Within minutes, she was already asleep.However, two other people in the same city were turning in their beds, their minds refusing to rest. One of them was Bai Zhou, who thought that someone had cast a spell on him earlier in the day. The other one was Song Shiyu, who was smoking a cigarette in a daze.Nighttime tended to make one overthink things. Thinking about the happiness he felt in the day, Bai Zhou couldn\u2019t help thinking that he was a child being toyed by Ji Fanyin, but on second thoughts, it didn\u2019t seem like there was anything off with what she did.That was indeed how Ji Xinxin interacted with him.But somehow, despite Ji Fanyin\u2019s impeccable feeling, he couldn\u2019t help but feel that something was wrong here.It\u2019s as if\u2026 as if\u2026Unable to find the words to explain his feeling, Bai Zhou spat out a curse as he shot up from his bed, switched on his laptop, and played five rounds of PUBG.Unfortunately, his luck wasn\u2019t good. He kept meeting with bad teammates, resulting in him eventually entering the final ring all alone before finally being wiped out. He didn\u2019t manage to get chicken dinner even once.He angrily tossed his mouse aside and stomped off to the kitchen to grab himself a cup of water, only to realize that a new day was upon him.Stunned, he quickly checked the time on the lower right corner of his laptop screen and saw that there was less than an hour to go for his 9 o\u2019clock appointment with Ji Fanyin.To make things worse, he was initially planning to bring her on a date to Disneyland.He had actually thought about it for a very long time now, but he wasn\u2019t able to find a chance to talk to Ji Xinxin about it in advance. So, he thought that it might be a good idea for him to bring Ji Fanyin over first for practice.However, it was already 8:20 now and he had made zero preparations so far. He had neither booked the plane tickets nor bought the amusement park passes.He could try to make last-minute arrangements here, but the chances were likely that he would screw up in a few places.While he knew that the one he was meeting was Ji Fanyin and there was no need to worry too much about how she felt, he still didn\u2019t want to appear like a child who was incapable of planning ahead before her.He hadn\u2019t paid Ji Fanyin just to get another older sister for himself!He berated his own lack of consideration before grabbing his phone to make a call to Ji Fanyin.She picked up the call pretty quickly. \u201cMorning, young master Bai.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m cancelling today\u2019s reservation. Let\u2019s meet up another day,\u201d said Bai Zhou. \u201cTomorrow.\u201dJi Fanyin replied with an \u2018Ah\u2019 before informing him about the company policy with a sweet voice reminiscent of a customer service staff. \u201cI\u2019ll reserve tomorrow for you then. However, I have to regretfully inform you that you won\u2019t be refunded for the cancellation of today\u2019s appointment.\u201dBai Zhou: \u201c??? Say that again?\u201d\u201cYour money won\u2019t be refunded,\u201d repeated Ji Fanyin with the same professional tone. \u201cHow about this? I\u2019ll give you a discount for tomorrow\u2019s reservation.\u201d\u201cNo discounts allowed!\u201d roared Bai Zhou. He squeezed his forehead and said, \u201cFine. No refunds, right? We\u2019ll proceed with today\u2019s reservation as previously agreed.\u201dJi Fanyin\u2019s voice remained as smooth as ever. \u201cUnderstood, young master Bai.\u201dBai Zhou hung up the phone in a huff.1,500,000 dollars wasn\u2019t a huge sum to him, but he wasn\u2019t willing to just give it away to Ji Fanyin for free.------Yoo hang out with us in our Discord~ Got a neat community there (well, admittedly they are all tyrant readers), but it would be nice to have more people around to chat about professional stand-in too!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That way, she would be able to earn double the sum.However, it turned out that Bai Zhou wasn\u2019t that generous.What a pity.Ji Fanyin put down her phone lamentably. She twisted open the tangerine lip gloss she had chosen earlier and carefully applied it onto her lips. She looked into the mirror and lightly puckered her lips before grabbing her bag.Judging from his voice, he probably spent the night up playing games. I guess he\u2019s going to be late.Nevertheless, she wouldn\u2019t allow herself to be late even if her client was. This was one of the principles she insisted on as a professional.As usual, she arrived at the destination several minutes in advance. Bai Zhou had set the meet-up location to be at a bus stop. She took a look at the time before whipping out her phone to play a puzzle video game she had stumbled upon on the internet by coincidence.Each stage of this puzzle video game had interesting twists to it, and she could stop whenever she wanted to. It was not a bad choice for idling some time away.It was already 9 by the time she cleared a stage. Just as she expected, Bai Zhou was still nowhere to be seen.Since the client was late, Ji Fanyin thought that it was fine for her to continue playing a little longer. So, she proceeded to the next stage, which quickly proved to be challenging.She leaned against the bus stop\u2019s notice board in a natural upright pose which she had been maintaining for a long time now. Unlike most people, her shoulders were naturally pulled backward. Even just by standing there, she looked like a beautiful scenery in itself.A group of young men who had just walked out from the adjacent subway station couldn\u2019t help but stare at her. Soon, they decided to walk over to engage her in a conversation.One of them noticed the game she was playing and nervously cleared his throat before asking, \u201cAre you stuck on the stage? Why don\u2019t I help you take a look?\u201dJi Fanyin looked up from her phone and saw a tall man who looked to be in his early twenties standing before her. She chuckled softly and teased, \u201cBut what if you try to escape with my phone?\u201dThe man\u2019s face reddened at her smile. He fumbled out his phone from his pocket and offered it to her in a fluster, saying, \u201cY-you can take my phone! It\u2019s the newest model! Ah wait, let me unlock it for you first\u2026\u201d\u201cGet lost,\u201d a deep and hoarse musculine voice suddenly sounded.Ji Fanyin turned her head over and saw Bai Zhou sitting coolly on his motorcycle with a leg resting on the bus stop\u2019s platform. He impatiently snapped the helmet\u2019s eye protector up.\u201cShe\u2019s with me.\u201d Bai Zhou directed a deathly cold glare at the man talking to Ji Fanyin. \u201cGet lost.\u201dJi Fanyin poked his arm and criticized disapprovingly, \u201cDon\u2019t be rude.\u201d\u201cAh?!\u201d Bai Zhou\u2019s rage intensified. He violently smacked away Ji Fanyin\u2019s arm and bellowed, \u201cJi Fanyin, what right do you have to preach at me?\u201dJi Fanyin sighed softly. She turned to the man, who was stunned from being abruptly shouted at, and apologized, \u201cThis child spent the entire night up, so his temper is a lot worse than usual. Don\u2019t hold it against him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d the man replied. He glanced at Bai Zhou with a frown before turning his attention back to Ji Fanyin. \u201cCan we exchange\u2026\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to get lost?\u201d Bai Zhou grabbed Ji Fanyin\u2019s arm and tugged her over to his side. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving!\u201dOne of the man\u2019s companions murmured in discontentment, \u201cWhat a fierce boyfriend you have. You should just dump him.\u201dBai Zhou turned over and directed a killer glare at that person.Ji Fanyin quickly tiptoed and pulled Bai Zhou\u2019s eye protector down before covering it with her hands, thereby stopping him from killing an innocent passerby with his glare. With a helpless tone, she said, \u201cAlright alright, let\u2019s go.\u201dThe young men walked away from the bus stop with irritated looks on their faces.Bai Zhou let out a threatening growl, \u201cLet go.\u201dHowever, Ji Fanyin wasn\u2019t afraid of him at all.Bai Zhou wasn\u2019t usually a pushover, but there were times when he was a pushover through and through. One such occasion was when Ji Fanyin spoke to him with Ji Xinxin\u2019s tone.\u201cWhere are we heading today?\u201d Ji Fanyin asked as she casually put down her hands.Bai Zhou pointed in a direction and answered, \u201cArt studio.\u201dAfter saying his piece, he revved up his motorcycle and drove away, leaving Ji Fanyin on the spot.------Yoo hang out with us in our Discord~ Got a neat community there (well, admittedly they are all tyrant readers), but it would be nice to have more people around to chat about professional stand-in too!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just its name was more than enough to hint at its choice of clients.She slowly walked toward the shopping mall and headed to the art studio. There was an employee already waiting for her at the entrance. \u201cMiss Ji? Please come with me.\u201dBai Zhou was already waiting inside one of the rooms. He was currently moving his art supplies, though he suddenly stopped halfway and let out a yawn.Ji Fanyin thought that it was amusing how he was trying to force himself to stay awake despite being utterly exhausted. At the same time, she suddenly remembered that Bai Zhou, despite his violent personality, had started learning drawing from four years old, and he was fairly skilled at sketching and oil painting.His choice of dates are surprisingly innocent.\u201cPlease enter.\u201d The employee stopped at the entrance of the studio and gestured for Ji Fanyin to enter. \u201cThere won\u2019t be anyone else using the room today, so you can be assured that there won\u2019t be any disturbances. If you require any assistance, feel free to ring the bell in the room and we\u2019ll be at your service.\u201dJi Fanyin thanked the employee before entering the room.Without lifting his head, Bai Zhou pointed to the seat in front and said, \u201cSit there.\u201dIt would appear that this art room was not exclusive to Bai Zhou as there were quite a few old paintings hanging on the walls. Ji Fanyin curiously took a look at them while walking past Bai Zhou, and she noticed that they were all nude sketches.Bai Zhou impatiently raised his head and complained, \u201cWhat are you dilly-dallying\u2026\u201dHe caught sight of the sketches hanging on the wall and immediately fell silent. His face began to redden.But before he could blow his top, Ji Fanyin took the pre-emptive strike. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201dBai Zhou clenched his teeth and pointed to the chair at the center of his room once more. \u201cHurry up and get over there. It\u2019s time for you to put on that act of yours!\u201dHe paused for a moment before adding on to his command, \u201cDon\u2019t speak a word at all and stay still. You can do whatever you want; just don\u2019t disturb me!\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Ji Fanyin was fine with it since it spared her from the effort of having to engage him.She settled down on the chair and leaned back leisurely before assessing the interior decor of this room. Soon, she came to a conclusion.This is an art room prepared specifically for the rich. No wonder Bai Zhou appears to be a regular here.His gaze was constantly alternating between Ji Fanyin and the canvas. There was a slight knit between his eyebrows, and he looked highly focused.Ji Fanyin decided to just casually hold onto the book for posture sake and stare directly at him.Ji Xinxin had standards when it came to the fishes she reared. For one, they must be passable in terms of appearances and backgrounds.Without a doubt, Bai Zhou had a face that would have easily made it big in the entertainment industry\u2026 Well, if not for his bad personality and extremely privileged background.\u201cBig sis, you aren\u2019t going to continue reading?\u201d Bai Zhou suddenly asked.He was in the midst of switching pencils when he asked that question. His peaceful tone indicated that it was a casual remark he was making in passing. It seemed like he was slightly out of it after getting too engrossed in his sketching.Before Bai Zhou could snap out of his daze, Ji Fanyin had already responded to his remark with a smile, \u201cOur Zhouzhou looks much more pleasing than any book.\u201dBai Zhou: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe pencil in his hand snapped into two. With an awful look on his face, he quickly grabbed another pencil and continued his drawing. It would appear like he was planning to cover up his earlier mistake by pretending that nothing had happened here.Ji Fanyin and Ji Xinxin are completely different from one another!But somehow, after this mistake, Bai Zhou felt like something was off no matter how he tried to sketch Ji Fanyin\u2019s portrait. Frustration began bottling up inside of him.It was at this moment that a ringtone sounded in the art room.Bai Zhou immediately leaped at this opportunity to vent his wrath, bellowing, \u201cWho\u2019s calling you? Are you asking for a dock in your pay?\u201dThere was a troubled frown on Ji Fanyin\u2019s face as she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s probably Shiyu.\u201dLike a wild beast who had its territory infringed, Bai Zhou charged forward and snatched Ji Fanyin\u2019s phone over.------Yoo hang out with us in our Discord~ Got a neat community there (well, admittedly they are all tyrant readers), but it would be nice to have more people around to chat about professional stand-in too!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The latter took her phone and flipped it over.Obviously, the caller could only be Song Shiyu.Since Bai Zhou was right beside her, he was the only one left who could access her phone while it was still in \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 mode.Bai Zhou didn\u2019t hang up the phone. He stared at Ji Fanyin\u2019s phone screen for two seconds, and surprisingly, he actually picked it up. \u201cSong Shiyu, you\u2019re really getting addicted to this, huh?\u201dJi Fanyin couldn\u2019t hear what Song Shiyu said on the other end, but Bai Zhou\u2019s complexion swiftly darkened. A few seconds later, he quietly hung up the phone.Ji Fanyin raised her eyebrows a little.There were many comebacks one could make to Bai Zhou\u2019s remark. Just a simple \u2018Aren\u2019t you the same too?\u2019 was more than enough to silence him.She was just curious as to how Song Shiyu phrased it.However, what she was the most concerned with was whether Song Shiyu was intending to make another reservation with that call. So, she gently asked Bai Zhou, \u201cWhat did he say?\u201dBai Zhou tossed her phone into her bag with moderate force and replied, \u201cNothing much. It\u2019s all nonsense\u2026 You aren\u2019t allowed to look at me anymore. Read your book instead!\u201dHe stomped back to his seat and sat down. There was a brief pause before he suddenly sneered, \u201cYou actually fell in love with a scum like him?\u201dTo maintain the character she was playing, Ji Fanyin chose not to respond to Bai Zhou\u2019s remark. Deep down, however, she was amazed by the latter\u2019s inability to see the irony of his own words.You\u2019re scorning him despite being in the same position as him? What a remarkable lack of self-awareness.After this small incident, she turned her attention back to the book in her hand. Despite knowing next to nothing about sketching, she still managed to finish it despite the professional jargons filling its pages.When she finally closed the book shut, she noticed that the only sound to be heard in the art room was the light whirring of the air conditioning. There weren't any pencil scratching sounds to be heard.She raised her head and looked in Bai Zhou\u2019s direction, only to see him dozing off on a large comfortable chair. The pencil in his hand was already on the verge of falling to the ground.He might be young, but there\u2019s still a limit to his vitality.Ji Fanyin quietly rose to her feet and walked over to Bai Zhou\u2019s side. She tried tugging the pencil in his hand softly first, and it was only when he failed to respond did she finally pull it out entirely.Bai Zhou groggily opened her eyes. \u201cMmmm\u2026 Big sis?\u201d\u201cYou stayed up all night again?\u201d Ji Fanyin patted his hair which was as unruly as his personality. \u201cGo on and take a nap. I\u2019ll wake you up when it\u2019s time to eat.\u201dShe spoke with a suppressed voice, such that Bai Zhou didn\u2019t suspect a thing at all.\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t go, big sis,\u201d he murmured a few indistinct words.\u201cI won\u2019t go anywhere. I\u2019ll be right by your side,\u201d said Ji Fanyin gently.Bai Zhou returned to sleep with an ease of mind.Ji Fanyin suddenly thought that it wasn\u2019t that bad for her client to have stayed up the previous night either. It sure was a load of burden off her back.Standing beside Bai Zhou, she turned her attention toward the half-done sketch that he had been working on so far. It was a portrait of her\u2014or from the artist\u2019s point of view, Ji Xinxin\u2014reading a book with a lowered head. It had a tranquil vibe that brought serenity to those looking at it.It\u2019s hard to believe that this was drawn by someone of Bai Zhou\u2019s personality.Bai Zhou subconsciously reached for Ji Fanyin\u2019s hand while the latter was still looking at his sketch, but the moment their fingers barely came into contact, she quickly pulled her hand away.In the end, he only managed to grab onto her coat, though he clutched onto it with surprising tenacity, refusing to let go at all.Ji Fanyin lowered her head to look at him and her eyebrows shot up a little.------Yoo hang out with us in our Discord~ Got a neat community there (well, admittedly they are all tyrant readers), but it would be nice to have more people around to chat about professional stand-in too!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He called out to her with a voice that was still a little nasal from having just woken up, \u201cBig sis.\u201d\u201cYou lazy bum.\u201d The other party poked his forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s already after lunchtime. Your tummy is going to start hurting if you don\u2019t wake up soon.\u201dBai Zhou closed his eyes groggily as he mumbled softly, \u201cI want to eat\u2026 the food you make. You said that you would learn some of the local specialties in\u2026 France\u2026!\u201dHis words gradually slowed down, and the final word was literally spoken with a shout. He immediately sat upward as if he had been struck by lightning.Shit! Ji Xinxin is obviously in France! The person beside me in a fake!Bai Zhou glared at Ji Fanyin with a mixture of anger and fright, but the latter simply directed an unfazed smile at him and asked, \u201cAre you finally awake?\u201dHe wanted to burst out cursing, but at the next moment, he belatedly realized that he was holding onto her coat. He immediately flung it off as countless vulgarities flashed across his mind.\u201cLunch? We\u2019ll get delivery!\u201d He vigorously whipped out his phone and tapped into a delivery app. \u201cWe\u2019ll be eating fried chicken!\u201dJi Fanyin sighed softly. \u201cYou\u2019re still young. You shouldn\u2019t eat junk food all the time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business!\u201d shouted Bai Zhou. He was like a volcano that was already on the verge of eruption. \u201cYou aren\u2019t like big sis at all! Do you even know how to cook?!\u201d\u201cI do,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with a smile. \u201cI know a bit of French cuisine. What would you like to eat?\u201dBai Zhou was in the midst of furiously adding spicy chicken into his shopping cart when his finger abruptly came to a halt. \u201c\u2026 Really?\u201d\u201cThe preparation time might be a bit long though, and I don\u2019t have any ingredients at my place.\u201d Ji Fanyin took a look at her watch. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I grab some ingredients later on and cook dinner for you?\u201dBai Zhou stared at her intently as if he was trying to guard against a thief.But in the end, he still caved in and agreed to it. He even passed his phone to her and said, \u201cOrder what you want for lunch.\u201dJi Fanyin scrolled through the menu of the unhealthy fried chicken fast food restaurant, and in the end, she opted for Ji Xinxin\u2019s usual choice of salad and corn.It\u2019s lucky that I ate more for breakfast, she thought.Probably thanks to having rested up well, Bai Zhou was much more effective in the afternoon. He managed to finish two sketches, which he carefully stowed away in a folder as if it was some sort of precious treasure.\u201cYou can go to the supermarket on your own. I won\u2019t be tagging along,\u201d said Bai Zhou as he walked out of the art room. \u201cIt\u2019ll be troublesome if anyone catches the two of us together.\u201dJi Fanyin considered asking him for his bank card, but she decided against breaking her character here.I\u2019ll just report my expenses to him later on. It\u2019s unlikely that he would shirk payment anyway.Ji Fanyin headed to the Hema supermarket at the B1 floor in the shopping mall. She quickly drafted up an ingredient list in her mind and grabbed everything she needed before making payment. (Hema is a major China supermarket chain under Alibaba.)Once she was done, she made a call to Bai Zhou.His voice was as impatient as always. \u201cYou\u2019re done? Send me your address. We\u2019ll head there separately.\u201dJi Fanyin blinked her eyes before replying, \u201cLet\u2019s head to your house instead. You have a larger kitchen. Besides\u2026 I\u2019m worried that you haven\u2019t been taking care of yourself recently. I want to take a look around your apartment.\u201dShe had no intention of giving her address away to her client that easily. Even with Song Shiyu, she chose to meet him in a public parking lot in her neighborhood instead of directly giving him her address.She made a clear distinction between work and private life.Bai Zhou was silent for two seconds. Perhaps it was because he didn\u2019t want to waste his time arguing with Ji Fanyin over this, he soon replied, \u201cI\u2019ll send my address to you. You head there yourself.\u201dHe hung up his phone afterward.------Yoo hang out with us in our Discord~ Got a neat community there (well, admittedly they are all tyrant readers), but it would be nice to have more people around to chat about professional stand-in too!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On top of having the penthouse apartment, he also had a butler who was on standby 24/7.The butler was already waiting at the entrance of the condominium when she arrived. He brought her to the penthouse and opened the door for her before leaving without asking any questions at all.His respect for his employer\u2019s privacy showed his professionalism.Ji Fanyin was unable to find any smaller slippers in the shoe rack, so she had to make do with an oversized one.She was quite passionate about cooking. She lay out her ingredients one by one in the open concept kitchen and began handling them accordingly. Cooking was quite enjoyable to her,such that she soon started humming a tune.Twenty minutes later, Bai Zhou arrived.There was a spirited look on his face when he opened the door. When he noticed an additional pair of slippers by the doorway, he quickly turned to the kitchen and held his finger to his mouth, gesturing for Ji Fanyin not to make a noise.Ji Fanyin quickly swallowed her greetings back in.\u201cRight now? Sure!\u201d replied Bai Zhou over the phone. It was clear that he was in a good mood. \u201c\u2026 Big sis, don\u2019t you have any lessons today?\u201dJi Fanyin immediately got the message.Ah, it\u2019s one of Ji Xinxin\u2019s routine checks.She took a paprika, placed it on the chopping board, and skillfully sliced it into half. She proceeded on to remove its seeds and membrane before cutting it into smaller pieces.\u201cYes, I\u2019m free. I can play with you right now.\u201d Bai Zhou casually placed his motorcycle keys on the table before speed walking to his laptop. \u201cIs it just the two of us? \u2026 Who else will be joining us?\u201dJi Fanyin elegantly sprinkled salt and pepper on the steaks and gently massaged them to rub the flavor in.\u201cYour friend is joining us too? \u2026 Is it a guy or a girl?\u201d Bai Zhou\u2019s voice could be heard through the opened door of his study room. \u201cA girl? Ah okay. I\u2019m switching on my laptop now. I\u2019ll be there right away. Yeah, you should add me into your party.\u201dJi Fanyin stashed the steak and all of the other processed ingredients neatly into the plastic containers provided by the supermarket.Bai Zhou finally walked out from the study room with his phone still in his hand. He said, \u201cJi Fanyin, you may leave now.\u201dHe placed his phone down on a table before heading into the bathroom to wash his face.Meanwhile, Ji Fanyin made use of the next few minutes to clean up the mess in the kitchen.When Bai Zhou walked into the living room with water dripping from his face and saw that Ji Fanyin was still around, he asked with a frown, \u201cWhy are you still here? I don\u2019t need you around anymore. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t ask you for a refund since I\u2019m the one cancelling the reservation now. Make sure to take everything away with you. I don\u2019t need them anymore.\u201dJi Fanyin stacked the containers of freshly handled and marinated ingredients into a plastic bag before turning to Bai Zhou. \u201cWait a moment, young master Bai.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d grumbled Bai Zhou impatiently.Ji Fanyin put on a professional smile and said, \u201cI\u2019ve left the receipt for the expenses I have incurred at the supermarket on your shoe rack. Please remember to reimburse me accordingly.\u201d\u201cJust how poor are you?!\u201d exclaimed Bai Zhou. He waved his hand impatiently and said, \u201cHurry up and leave!\u201dIt\u2019s just some foie gras, steak, red wine, mussels, and stuff. This rich young master wouldn\u2019t be too bothered with just a measly 10,000 dollars.Out of gratitude, Ji Fanyin kindly took away the trash bag in the kitchen with her when she left the penthouse. With a huge bag of high-quality ingredients in hand, she hailed a cab and headed back home.It was only 3 o\u2019clock by the time she got home.I got to leave work nine hours early, and I even got a free Western dinner feast for myself.Yup, he definitely is a VIP client of mine.------Yoo hang out with us in our Discord~ Got a neat community there (well, admittedly they are all tyrant readers), but it would be nice to have more people around to chat about professional stand-in too!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You must have spent the whole of last night playing games, right?\u201d reproached Ji Xinxin. \u201cI really shouldn\u2019t have asked you to play.\u201dBai Zhou immediately justified himself, \u201cI already slept earlier in the afternoon. I feel more refreshed than ever.\u201dWho else would you find to play games with you other than me?\u201cReally?\u201d asked Ji Xinxin skeptically. \u201cIf I hear you yawn even once, I\u2019ll have you get off your computer and rest right away.\u201dBai Zhou made a mental note to cover his mouth before yawning later on.The three of them quickly started a game. Bai Zhou gave the cue for them to leap off and parachute, but they were unlucky to bump into two other squads upon landing. Within two minutes, Ji Xinxin and Kitty suffered tragic deaths, leaving Bai Zhou to fight alone.Bai Zhou: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe could continue playing this match for another twenty more minutes, and perhaps, he might even get a chicken dinner. However, Ji Xinxin would be left to watch his avatar in boredom, unable to enjoy the game herself.So, he decided to conduct a reckless charge and commit suicide so that they could start the next game quickly. At the same time, he consoled Ji Xinxin, \u201cFollow me next round. I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d replied Ji Xinxin.It turned out that bringing two newbies around was extremely exhausting. He slowly grew frustrated after suffering several consecutive defeats, so he chose to divert his attention elsewhere by chatting with Ji Xinxin.Kitty had remained quiet all this while, so Bai Zhou proceeded to ask Ji Xinxin about how she was faring in France.\u201cI\u2019ll pay you a visit in Paris once you settle down. Do you have any food cravings? I\u2019ll bring whatever you want over.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. There\u2019s a Chinatown not too far away from where I live. I can get most of the stuff I want there,\u201d replied Ji Xinxin. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me. Rather, I\u2019m more worried about you. You always end up losing track of time whenever you start gaming.\u201dBai Zhou fiddled with his mouse as he searched for another conversation topic.\u201cBig sis, you have a twin sister, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yeap. Did you meet her?\u201d\u201cMm. I saw her on the streets the other day,\u201d said Bai Zhou. He paused for a moment before asking, \u201cDo you know what she\u2019s working as at the moment?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s still unemployed. She was much better than me back in school, but now\u2026\u201d Ji Xinxin sighed softly. \u201cI know that you detest people with her personality, but at least on the account that she\u2019s my older sister, don\u2019t fight with her, alright?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Mm,\u201d Bai Zhou grumbled out a response. \u201cWhy is there such a vast difference in your personalities despite being twins?\u201dJi Xinxin was quiet for a moment before she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I fell gravely ill in my younger years and ended up spending a few years in the hospital. My parents devoted their attention to taking care of me, but this resulted in my older sister being neglected. By the time I recovered from my illness, her academic results had already fallen drastically\u2026\u201dBai Zhou frowned in frustration, thinking that Ji Fanyin only had herself to blame for being so needy. He spat, \u201cIt\u2019s her own responsibility to focus on her studies. Who can she blame for her lack of drive?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d Ji Xinxin ended the topic there, not wanting to delve deeper into it. \u201c\u2014So, when do we jump?\u201dBai Zhou randomly selected a location and led Ji Xinxin and Kitty off the plane.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She lit a scented candle to accentuate the atmosphere before popping a 1996 Lafite.Of course, all of these were generously sponsored by Bai Zhou.After having her fill of food. Ji Fanyin switched on her phone but there wasn\u2019t any messages from her clients.Bai Zhou should still be gaming right now. As for Song Shiyu\u2026Ji Fanyin sent him a message, and the latter soon replied with an address. He was reserving her for lunch tomorrow.Ji Fanyin replied with an \u2018OK\u2019 emoji, and she soon received a text message indicating she had received the money.She then loaded the dishes into the dishwasher and stretched her back lazily.With this, I have a job secured for tomorrow too. Since I got off work early today, should I watch some films, play a game, or do my homework and head to sleep early?Ji Fanyin casually scrolled through her WeChat\u2019s Moments page as she pondered about her plans for the night.\u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 had never posted anything about herself on social media, so her Moments\u2019 page was completely empty. However, she did have a few friends on WeChat who were rather active.One of them was Ji Xinxin. It was clear from browsing through her feed that she was an elegant young lady born with a silver spoon.Just half an hour ago, Ji Xinxin posted a screenshot of her gaming record accompanied with a crying emoji.Ji Fanyin tapped into screenshot and saw a column of ten consecutive losses, and in three of them they were pretty much instant KO-ed.It looks like even a Grandmaster would find it hard to carry two Bronze playersJust thinking about how frustrated and hungry Bai Zhou must be right now brought a gloating smile to her lips.Ah, there\u2019s no saying that Bai Zhou might be enjoying this too. There are so many people in the world who want to game with Ji Fanyin that they could probably form a long queue down the streets.In the end, Ji Fanyin decided to pop in one of the Blu-ray movies she had recently bought and started enjoying her night off.\u2026On the other side of the city, Song Shiyu placed his phone down after wiring the money to Ji Fanyin.\u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d asked Mrs Song with a deep sigh. \u201cI know that you already have someone in your heart, but there\u2019s no point forcing things if the two of you aren\u2019t meant to be. To be frank, that young miss from the Ji Family doesn\u2019t give me good vibes, and you aren\u2019t young anymore. You shouldn\u2019t waste your time on her.\u201d\u201cMum, I\u2019m still young,\u201d replied Song Shiyu with a frown. \u201cAnd Xinxin isn\u2019t a bad person either. There are just too many jealous people out there who badmouth her.\u201dMrs Song was exasperated. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t bother saying anything if you\u2019d managed to woo her, but she\u2019s already rejected your confession. Listen to your mum, there are lots of outstanding women out there in the world who are interested in you. She isn\u2019t the only one for you. Why are you so fixated on one who doesn\u2019t like you back?\u201dSong Shiyu looked downward with a steely expression on his face, choosing not to say a word. His attitude clearly showed his resistance.\u201c\u2026 Alright alright, I\u2019ll stop nagging or else you\u2019re going to start arguing with me again.\u201d The exhausted Mrs Song ended the conversation there. \u201cAre you eating at home tomorrow?\u201d\u201cI have a lunch appointment with my colleagues,\u201d replied Song Shiyu with a shake of his head. \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving early tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cMake sure you don\u2019t grab junk food just to save some time. Your complexion looks so much worse than before!\u201d said Mrs Song worriedly.\u201cIt\u2019s not junk food. I\u2019m visiting the restaurant which I brought you to last time,\u201d reassured Song Shiyu. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m paying close attention to my health. You and dad shouldn\u2019t forget about your health checkup next month either.\u201dMrs Song responded with a nod before grabbing her phone to check on the restaurant Song Shiyu had mentioned. After confirming it, she secretly sent the address to someone else.Meanwhile, Song Shiyu finished up his dinner before handling his remaining work. Before heading to bed, he picked up his phone and scrolled through Ji Xinxin\u2019s Moments\u2019 page, where he saw the screenshot containing her tragic gaming record and Bai Zhou\u2019s very recognizable username.He had a feeling that Ji Xinxin\u2019s attitude toward him had turned cold ever since he confessed to her that day. She always said that she was new to Paris and had a lot of things to familiarize herself with\u2026 but somehow she still managed to find time to play games with Bai Zhou.Song Shiyu stared at his phone with narrowed eyes before calling Ji Xinxin\u2019s number.She didn\u2019t pick up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As the clock approached lunchtime, he quickly cleared up whatever he was handling before heading to the restaurant he had agreed on with Ji Fanyin.He arrived fifteen minutes ahead of time.While he was still looking through his email, he received a call from his mother.Thinking that he might have left something behind in his parents\u2019 house, he picked up the call. But before he could say anything, his mother got straight to the point and asked, \u201cShiyu, it\u2019s going to be lunchtime soon. Have you arrived at the restaurant yet?\u201d\u201cI am already there,\u201d replied Song Shiyu as he glanced at his watch.Ten more minutes to go.\u201cGood, good,\u201d replied Mrs Song happily. \u201cI\u2019ll have Miss Chen meet you there. She\u2019s a wonderful young lady. You can have lunch with her and your colleagues. Make sure not to make things too awkward for her, alright?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Mom, I\u2019m already eating with my colleagues,\u201d protested Song Shiyu.\u201cAren\u2019t they all your subordinates?\u201d Mrs Song thought nothing about it. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal for you to bring a friend along with you for a social gathering. She should be arriving soon. Make sure to treat her well, you hear me?\u201dMrs Song hung up right away, not giving Song Shiyu any chance to turn down the meeting. Song Shiyu tried to call her back, but the line was busy.At this rate, that Miss Chen or something is going to bump into Ji Fanyin.Song Shiyu quickly rose to his feet and began making his way to the front reception. While walking, he took out his phone and swiftly browsed through his list of contacts to look for Ji Fanyin\u2019s phone number.But before he could press the \u2018Call\u2019 button, the front receptionist suddenly brought a demure young lady over.The lady seemed to recognize Song Shiyu as she directed a graceful smile toward him and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Mr Song.\u201dSong Shiyu\u2019s finger froze in place. He quickly put on his usual elegant smile and returned the greeting, \u201cYes, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you too. I\u2019ve just received an urgent call from my company, so I\u2019ll have to excuse myself for a moment. Do feel free to enter the compartment room first and wait for me there. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d the lady replied with a slightly flushed face. \u201cWork should take precedence. Go ahead and do whatever you need to.\u201dSong Shiyu tilted his body sideward so as to create some room for them to pass by him. After that, he continued heading out with his phone in hand.But just as he was about to call Ji Fanyin to inform her that she didn\u2019t have to come anymore, he suddenly spotted her at the end of the corridor.She was standing there with her hands behind her back and a gentle smile on her face. It was clear that she had witnessed everything that had happened earlier, but she still met his eyes clearly without any fluctuations in her emotions.Song Shiyu\u2019s footsteps froze for a brief moment before he continued striding toward her, until he was finally standing before her.\u201cShiyu,\u201d Ji Fanyin called out with her head tilted in confusion. \u201cYou invited another woman to have lunch with us?\u201dSong Shiyu couldn\u2019t see any anger or sorrow on her face. He was silent for a few seconds before asking, \u201cJi Fanyin\u2026 is there nothing else you want to say?\u201dIsn\u2019t Ji Fanyin supposed to be in love with me? Why isn\u2019t she reacting at all?\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Ji Fanyin pondered for a moment before switching over to her professional smile. \u201cDoes this mean a paid break for me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her nonchalance sure looks convincing. She must treasure her dignity a lot.Song Shiyu snorted at Ji Fanyin\u2019s pretense and said, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault for not managing my schedule properly. You can head back now. I\u2019ll call you again.\u201d\u201cThere won\u2019t be any refunds,\u201d reminded Ji Fanyin.Song Shiyu looked at her pitifully and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just 200,000 dollars. I won\u2019t go to the extent of asking you to refund me.\u201dOne quality which Ji Fanyin demanded from her clients was generosity, and Song Shiyu and Bai Zhou at least qualified on that aspect.After receiving Song Shiyu\u2019s promise not to pursue a refund, Ji Fanyin\u2019s smile grew more sincere. \u201cAlright, I shan\u2019t get in your way anymore. See you, young master Song.\u201dShe turned her back on Song Shiyu and joyfully made her way home.What could be better than skipping work for two consecutive days without any repercussions?Ji Fanyin was planning on heading home to continue her movie marathon till nightfall, but while she was traveling down an escalator, she noticed a poster advertising a recently released film.It was a niche mystery thriller, and she noticed that the director was someone whose works she had watched over the last few days and had a favorable impression of.Today was the first day of the movie\u2019s screening.The moment she arrived at the end of the escalator, she turned around, headed back up, and rushed for the cinema.It was a weekday, so the cinema was unsurprisingly deserted.To her delight, the next screening happened to be ten minutes later, so she quickly bought her soda and popcorn before heading into the theater.She went in expecting to watch a simple mystery thriller, but to her surprise, the movie highlighted human altruism amidst a cesspool of evil. It was filmed in a way that emulated a phone recorded video, taking the angle of an innocent child. Be it the writing, directing, or acting, everything was on the dot. The film was overflowing with feelings, but at the same time, it spurred deeper contemplations about society too.It\u2019s a rare masterpiece.Ji Fanyin always entered movie theaters with a serious attitude. By the time she left with an empty popcorn tub in her hands, her eyes had already turned red.As she tossed the popcorn tub and the soda cup into the rubbish bin, she decided to buy herself some spicy food to drive off the heavy feeling in her heart.While she was queuing up for a bon bon chicken in the shopping mall\u2019s B1 Gourmet Street, she took out her phone and tapped into her Weibo. She logged onto an account she had recently created to post movie reviews and began penning down her impression of the mystery thriller. (Weibo is a microblog website/application that\u2019s one of the go-to social media platforms in China.)She was a professional in the film industry in her previous life, so writing reviews weren\u2019t a challenge to her. She was able to keenly pick out the key points of the movie and encapsulate them with in a concise and interesting way. Due to that, she was able to accrue over a thousand fans within less than a week.The movie she had just watched earlier in the day was newly released and in a niche genre, so there were hardly any professional reviews yet.It was precisely due to her passion in films that she was extremely careful whenever she wrote a paragraph in the review. She edited it again and again, and all that was left in the end were two key sentences.\u201c4237!\u201dHearing a call from the counter, Ji Fanyin took a look at her receipt before walking over to collect her food. To her surprise, there were familiar faces standing near the counter too\u2014Bai Zhou and his little buddies.Bai Zhou noticed her too and frowned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her gaze swept across Bai Zhou as if he was a mere stranger, and she walked away right after collecting her Chili Oil Bon Bon Chicken.But barely after taking a couple of steps, Bai Zhou suddenly caught up with her and asked with a suppressed voice, \u201cAre you going to meet Song Shiyu?\u201dJi Fanyin blinked her eyes.Her dress style was considerably different from Ji Xinxin, so it wasn\u2019t really surprising that Bai Zhou would deduce so.Bai Zhou shot a glance at Ji Fanyin\u2019s phone screen, which was still on the review she had meticulously edited, and saw a line of words: It has been long since I felt such deep sorrow over a single remark.It was immediately made apparent to him that she had suffered some grievances over at Song Shiyu\u2019s side, and he snorted in disdain.Under Bai Zhou\u2019s intent stare, Ji Fanyin calmly switched off her phone screen and slipped it into her pocket. \u201cSame as yesterday, I got off work in advance because my client has something up.\u201dBai Zhou slipped his hands into his pockets and sneered, \u201cSo, you cried because Song Shiyu dumped you?\u201dJi Fanyin knew that he was having a major misunderstanding here, but she really couldn\u2019t really be bothered to clarify it\u2014provided that he was willing to listen at all.\u201cDo you like him that much? If that\u2019s the case, why don\u2019t you find a way to snatch him over?\u201d said Bai Zhou.Ji Fanyin understood right away that Bai Zhou was intending to use her to get rid of one of his love rivals. She gave it some thought before replying with a strained tone, \u201cHe\u2019d have already fallen in love with me if that was possible.\u201dBai Zhou was exasperated by her lack of motivation.Ji Fanyin calmly took out the cheapest seaweed skewer and offered it to him. \u201cIt\u2019s a coincidence that we met here. A special benefit for a returning customer, I\u2019ll share one with you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d Bai Zhou rejected her offer coldly.Ji Fanyin couldn\u2019t be bothered to ask again out of politeness, so she retracted her hand and bade him farewell. \u201cAlright. See you then.\u201dShe walked away while chewing on the seaweed skewer.\u201c\u2015Bai Zhou, who is that? I didn\u2019t see her face, but she looks a little familiar\u2026?\u201dBai Zhou turned around impatiently and replied perfunctorily, \u201cIt\u2019s no one. I got the wrong person.\u201dJi Fanyin carefully finished her box of bon bon chicken, making sure not to splatter any chili oil on her clothes. After that, she headed for the bubble tea store to get herself a drink.While she was queuing up to make her order, she suddenly received a call from Song Shiyu.\u201cDid you return home safely?\u201d asked Song Shiyu.Despite his words of concern, it sounded more like a meaningless conversation starter due to what he said afterward.\u201cAccompany me for dinner now.\u201dJi Fanyin was in the midst of tapping on the ordering machine when she heard those words and decisively chose to walk away.Why should I spend my own money when someone else is treating me?She began making her way back to the restaurant she had previously agreed to meet Song Shiyu at, but along the way, she just so happened to bump into Bai Zhou yet again.Ji Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201dWhat kind of fate is this? Is this a sign that I\u2019m going to get a reservation from him?Bai Zhou was standing in front of a popular restaurant that was trending on social media at the moment, though he wasn\u2019t accompanied with his buddies. He leaned against the wall with a hand in the pocket and the other one fiddling with his phone. Despite the sour look on his face, there were still many women who couldn\u2019t help but sneak peeks at him while passing by\u2026\u2026 though there was one who looked at him openly.Ji Fanyin thought about it for a moment, but she decided to prioritize her current reservation. So, she ignored Bai Zhou and walked past him.\u201cHey.\u201d Almost as if he had eyes on the top of his head, Bai Zhou called out to her while she was passing him by. \u201cAre you intentionally loitering around me?\u201dJi Fanyin stopped and turned to look at him. \u201cI have an appointment right now over at that direction. Young master Bai, do you want to make a reservation too?\u201dBai Zhou glanced at the direction Ji Fanyin was walking toward and asked, \u201cSong Shiyu called you over?\u201dJi Fanyin responded with a silent smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His expression spoke louder than words: You\u2019re a bootlicker.Then, he lowered his head and turned his attention back to his mobile game.Ji Fanyin was just about to walk away when her phone rang\u2015it was Song Shiyu.She picked up the phone while walking, \u201cMr Song. Yes\u2026 I\u2019m currently heading in your direction. I should reach in ten minutes\u2019 time.\u201dBai Zhou heard those words loud and clear, and he raised his head to look at Ji Fanyin\u2019s silhouette.What\u2019s the use of her feigning composure before Song Shiyu? Everyone knows about her one-sided love for Song Shiyu even though he has never even spared a proper glance at her before.It was then that Bai Zhou\u2019s buddies finally emerged from the end of the long queue. Holding a cake shaped like a dog\u2019s head in his hand, he introduced it to Bai Zhou, saying, \u201cThis is their newest product. It\u2019s called Bootlicker.\u201dBai Zhou scoffed in disdain, \u201cWhat lousy name is that?\u201dHis friend burst into laughter and remarked, \u201cIsn\u2019t it? Hahaha!\u201d\u2026Ji Fanyin\u2019s sense of time was spot-on. She arrived sharply in ten minutes\u2019 time, and by then, she had already gotten into work mode.The table Song Shiyu was sitting at had been cleaned, evidenced by the two fresh sets of cutleries sitting on it.Before Ji Fanyin could greet him, Song Shiyu asked without raising his head, \u201cXinxin, you like me too, right?\u201dJi Fanyin hung her bag on the rack by the side as she replied in a natural tone, \u201cAre we going to start with a confession every single time we meet from now onward?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Song Shiyu didn\u2019t respond to her teasing. The atmosphere around him was so heavy that it was hard to bear.It was just a pity that the person before him was none other than Ji Fanyin. She had once played a psychopathic serial killer that scared all of the youngsters on the set to the point that they burst into tears. Someone of Song Shiyu\u2019s caliber couldn\u2019t possibly hope to intimidate her.She walked up to the table and bent forward to look him in the eye. With a particularly earnest look on her face, she professed her feelings to him, \u201cI like you too.\u201dThe two of them traded gazes for a while before Song Shiyu\u2019s body finally relaxed a little. He gestured her to take a seat.Ji Fanyin chuckled a little at his response.Instead of sitting down right away, she topped up his half-empty cup with more hot tea and pushed it to him. At the same time, she asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t eat much earlier, right? Let\u2019s order some food. You can tell me frankly if you aren\u2019t in a good mood. I\u2019ll listen to your complaints.\u201d\u201cAre you willing to marry me?\u201d Song Shiyu asked out of the blue.Realization struck Ji Fanyin.The lady he had met earlier was clearly someone from a wealthy household. Most likely, his family was trying to matchmake the two of them.In other words, Song Shiyu was currently being pressured by his family to get married.But there was no way Ji Fanyin could agree to Song Shiyu\u2019s proposal.She took some time to ponder over the question while walking around the table to get to her seat. After settling down, she directed a smile at Song Shiyu and said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t even started dating yet. Are you going to talk that far ahead now?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Then when can we start talking about it?\u201d asked Song Shiyu with a deep voice. \u201cWill that day even come?\u201dJi Fanyin shyly fiddled her hands resting on the table and replied, \u201cI-if everything goes well, of course we\u2019ll get m-married.\u201dHer cheeks started to redden along with the change in the atmosphere, and her eyes began to swim around nervously. It was almost as if she was too embarrassed to look Song Shiyu in the eye.Song Shiyu sighed deeply and said, \u201cXinxin, I like you.\u201d\u201cI like you too,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with a timid voice.There was one concern floating in her mind while she was playing the role of a shy young lady.How can I give out empty cheques during service hours without stirring future conflicts?Hmm\u2026 I guess it boils down to dragging things out and playing it vague.\u201cShiyu, you know that I\u2019m still in school right now. We can sit down together and seriously discuss our future plans after I graduate. What do you think?\u201d she proposed meekly.Three years would be more than enough for me to earn my keep anyway\u2026 unless Ji Xinxin decides to further her studies and not return home. That would be a different story.At least from the current looks of it, it seems like this stand-in business of mine is going to close down within three years.Song Shiyu stared at her as his eyes slowly mellowed down tenderly. \u201c\u2026 Alright. Let\u2019s continue dating until then.\u201dThe embarrassed Ji Fanyin raised the menu to cover her face before murmuring softly in response, \u201cMm. Alright.\u201dIn her heart, she held a second of silence for Song Shiyu and his wallet.Quenching your thirst with poison will only bankrupt you.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She decided to visit this restaurant alone when she had time in the future.Over the course of the meal, she skillfully responded to Song Shiyu\u2019s remarks too.When Song Shiyu mentioned that he had returned home not too long ago, she went along with the flow and asked how his parents were faring, just like any girlfriend in a relationship would.When Song Shiyu said that the temperature was going to plummet over the next few days, she caringly reminded him to dress thicker and bring an umbrella around with him so that he wouldn\u2019t fall ill.So on and so forth.She wisely chose not to poke at any potential landmines either.For one, as long as Song Shiyu refused to talk about the woman he was being matchmaked with earlier, she wouldn\u2019t raise the topic on her own accord too.There was no point making the client uncomfortable during the service.The waiter soon served their final dish, Sea Cucumber Rice. While Ji Fanyin was pouring the rich soup into a smaller bowl for him, Song Shiyu asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask me about what you saw here earlier?\u201d(It\u2019s a dish containing of a thick flavorful soup stock made out of sea cucumber, sea cucumber, and specially processed rice.)Ji Fanyin raised her head to look at Song Shiyu. She spent a second to ponder about his intent behind this question.Is he hoping for \u2018Ji Xinxin\u2019 to be jealous, or is he aiming for something else?She mixed the rich soup with rice and pushed it toward Song Shiyu before answering his question with a smile, \u201cI\u2019ll listen to your explanation whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201dShe chose to kick the ball back to Song Shiyu.Song Shiyu was silent for a moment before speaking up, \u201c\u2026 It was something my mother did on her own accord. I was unaware of it. I\u2019ve already properly turned her down.\u201dJi Fanyin immediately got it upon hearing those words.Her gaze drooped slightly. She started mixing her own bowl of rice with the rich soup as she replied softly, \u201cWhile I knew that you wouldn\u2019t fall for another woman\u2026 I was still very worried before your explanation.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have explained it to you earlier,\u201d said Song Shiyu.\u201cIt isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Ji Fanyin raised her head and revealed a relieved smile. \u201cYour willingness to explain it to me shows that my trust in you isn\u2019t unfounded.\u201dOn the other side of the table, Song Shiyu finally broke into a smile, \u201cThank you for your trust.\u201dYou\u2019re welcome, though I trust your wallet a lot more, Ji Fanyin thought sardonically. Yeap, this Sea Cucumber Rice is delicious too.Sogn Shiyu footed the bill when they left the restaurant.Ji Fanyin glanced at the receipt and saw that the two meals actually cost 4000 dollars.As expected of a restaurant chosen by the rich. But still, it isn\u2019t as expensive as the meal sponsored by Bai Zhou\u2026 Hm?Her train of thought reminded her of something important.I don\u2019t think that he has paid me back for those ingredients yet, right? That\u2019s more than ten thousand dollars!. I can\u2019t just shrug it off.I shan\u2019t allow him to make any reservations until he pays for it.\u201cWhat are you doing after this?\u201d Song Shiyu stowed away his phone as he asked. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you.\u201dJi Fanyin snapped out of her thoughts and glanced at the clock on the wall. There were still a few minutes before the end of the service, so she went along with Song Shiyu\u2019s suggestion with a smile.The lift was located not too far away from the restaurant. The waiters respectfully walked them out of the store and even politely pressed the lift button for them. With a deep bow, they said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be waiting forward to your next visit.\u201dAs someone working in the service industry as well, Ji Fanyin deeply sympathized with them.It sure is hard to earn money.They soon arrived at the car park, but Ji Fanyin didn\u2019t get into his car. They were walking their way over when her alarm clock suddenly started ringing loudly.Song Shiyu\u2019s movements jerked to a halt, and Ji Fanyin also calmly stopped as well. She waved her hand at him and said, \u201cGoodbye.\u201dThere was a smile still lingering on her lips, but her disposition was somehow vastly different from before. Even her wave felt a little perfunctory.Song Shiyu had probably built up an immunity after the last few experiences he had, so he didn\u2019t reveal a \u2018my dreams are all shattered\u2019 expression. He stared at Ji Fanyin for a few good seconds, as if trying to peer through her.Ji Fanyin tilted her head in response, choosing not to say a word either. Her expression was casual, conforming to the typical response a person would have upon being stared at someone else on the streets.She was currently pondering whether she should agree to it if Song Shiyu requested for an extension of service.\u201cYour eyes were red when you came in earlier. Did you cry?\u201d asked Song Shiyu.Realization struck Ji Fanyin. She replied, \u201cI did.\u201dBecause of the movie.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you look for another boyfriend?\u201d asked Song Shiyu as he lit a smoke. \u201cThe best way to forget about a past relationship is to start a new one.\u201dToward that, Ji Fanyin replied affirmatively, \u201cI will.\u201dOnce I earn enough money from this stand-in job.Her hands full dealing with two lovelorn men to date anyone else now.Song Shiyu stared at her with eyes so complicated that Movie Reviewer Ji Fanyin was almost tempted to attempt deciphering and interpreting his expression, just that she couldn\u2019t care less about what Song Shiyu was thinking after service hours.So, she gestured toward his car with her chin and asked, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to leave?\u201dSong Shiyu was speechless for a second before getting into his driver\u2019s seat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was then that she suddenly heard a nervous greeting coming from behind her.\u201cErm\u2026 Hello?\u201dWondering if she was standing in someone else\u2019s way, Ji Fanyin turned around to take a look, only to realize that the person who had approached her looked a little familiar.She jogged her memory a little and recalled the other party to be one of the young men she had met at the bus stop while waiting for Bai Zhou the other day.The other party had a laptop bag hanging off his right shoulder, typical of a usual university student. He clutched onto the straps of his laptop bag nervously as he spoke with a hint of surprise and anticipation in his voice, \u201cBig sis, do you still remember me?\u201dJi Fanyin chuckled in response. She quickly finished composing her message for Bai Zhou and sent it over as she replied, \u201cIt happens that I haven\u2019t cleared that stage yet.\u201dThe young man\u2019s eyes lit up right away. \u201cI\u2019ll give it a try!\u201dRight after saying those words, he quickly took out his own phone, unlocked it, and handed it to Ji Fanyin. \u201cHere, take my phone first\u2026 and my laptop too! This way, you don\u2019t have to worry about me running away with your phone.\u201dJust like that, the two of them began earnestly looking into how the stage could be cleared beside a pillar in the car park.The young man failed his first attempt, and he hurriedly explained, \u201cG-give me a bit more time! I think I get the tempo now. I should be able to clear it in the next try! I\u2019m really not trying to scam you here.\u201dJi Fanyin was amused by his response. \u201cI never said that you were a scammer.\u201dHe did manage to clear the stage in his second try, and he heaved a long sigh of relief. He passed the phone back to Ji Fanyin and looked at her excitedly, as if fishing for compliments. \u201cI\u2019ve cleared the stage for you.\u201dJi Fanyin received her phone from him and thanked him for his help.\u201cAs a reward for clearing the stage\u2026 may I ask you a question?\u201d the young man asked.Ji Fanyin closed the game tab and replied casually, \u201cSure.\u201dShe didn\u2019t have to guess what he was going to ask. The question was literally written all over his face.As expected, the young man licked his lips nervously and asked, \u201cYou were walking out with another man earlier\u2026 Is he your boyfriend?\u201d\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d Ji Fanyin waved her phone in front of him. \u201cIf I had a boyfriend, I wouldn\u2019t have responded to any strangers chatting me up.\u201dThe young man exhaled deeply upon hearing those words. His face burst into a joyful smile as he exclaimed, \u201cSo, the two of you are just friends? That\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cWe aren\u2019t friends,\u201d Ji Fanyin refuted Song Shiyu\u2019s standing in her heart. \u201cHe\u2019s just a client.\u201d\u201cAre you done with work now?\u201d the young man asked a little awkwardly. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a coincidence that we met one another again here, so why don\u2019t we have a meal together? I\u2019ll treat you.\u201dThey\u2019re both of the same age, but this child is so much cuter than Bai Zhou, Ji Fanyin thought.\u201cI\u2019ll treat you instead,\u201d she said. \u201cI passed by an ice cream shop earlier that I was interested in.\u201dThat ice cream shop was having a promotion for its new flavors, offering half price for every second ice cream cone bought. Ji Fanyin didn\u2019t want to be eating two ice cream cones by herself, so she could only regrettably give up on the deal. But now that she had someone with her, it was time to make full use of the deal.\u201cSounds good!\u201d The delighted young man accepted the offer right away.According to the young man, he was a third year student studying in the same university as Bai Zhou. Interestingly, the two of them were around the same height too.\u201cYou\u2019re from Lakeside University?\u201d remarked Ji Fanyin as she scanned a QR code to pay for the ice cream. \u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201d\u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 also graduated from that school.\u201cArre you my senior by any chance?\u201d\u201cWell, I know quite a few people from your school. We had a gathering not too long ago,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin.\u201cThat\u2019s the most famous school in our province after all. Are those people still studying there right now? There might be a few whom I know of.\u201dJi Fanyin received the two light blue ice cream cones from the staff and passed one over to the young man. \u201cThere\u2019s one you probably have heard of.\u201dBai Zhou.\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d asked the young man curiously.Speak of the devil. Just as Ji Fanyin was about to reveal his name, the person she was talking about suddenly approached them on the street with his buddies.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did we just see something we weren\u2019t supposed to? Hehehe\u2026\u201d\u201cAiyoo, I actually thought that Senior Chen was still a single dog. It looks like my news is lagging behind!\u201dThe young man standing beside Ji Fanyin waved his hands around in a fluster as he tried to explain, \u201cNo, this is a misunderstanding! We aren\u2019t in that kind of relationship\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy would two people who aren\u2019t in that kind of relationship share a couple ice cream cone?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d someone remarked doubtfully. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve seen Senior\u2019s girlfriend somewhere before.\u201d\u201cAh! Isn\u2019t she Senior Ji Xinxin who went to further her studies in France not too long ago?\u201dLooking at the youngsters chattering away and that sour look on Bai Zhou\u2019s face, Ji Fanyin thought that she should at least clarify the misunderstanding here, so she said, \u201cJi Xinxin is my younger sister.\u201d\u201cAre the two of you twins? You really look alike!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, we\u2019re twins,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin casually. She pointed at the ice cream store behind her and asked, \u201cHave you all eaten yet? I\u2019ll treat you.\u201dUniversity students had a black hole in their stomach. Whether it was to mooch off Ji Fanyin or to immerse themselves in this exciting gossip, they unhesitatingly accepted Ji Fanyin\u2019s offer and headed into the ice cream shop.However, the one who said that Ji Fanyin looked familiar was still brooding over it, murmuring, \u201cNo, I feel like I\u2019ve seen her somewhere else today\u2026\u201dIt was just that no one was bothering with him, so he scratched his head in confusion and hurriedly caught up with the others.The crowd surrounded around the young man who already had an ice cream cone in his hand and \u2018escorted\u2019 him off the counter to make their orders while grilling him for the details.As a result, the only ones left behind were Bai Zhou, whom no one dared to drag along, and Ji Fanyin, who gave off an imposing air.Once everyone was out of earshot, Bai Zhou finally remarked disdainfully, \u201cYou sure are busy. I didn\u2019t think that you would have another appointment after dealing with Song Shiyu.\u201dJi Fanyin\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember him?\u201d\u201cWhy would I remember him?\u201d replied Bai Zhou with a matter-of-factly tone.Ji Fanyin thought about it for a moment and thought that it made sense.Well, there\u2019s no way someone as arrogant as Bai Zhou would bother remembering the appearance of the ones who talked to her at the bus stop the other day.However, she also had no reason to explain it to Bai Zhou, so she continued licking her ice cream while remarking nonchalantly, \u201cI\u2019m off work right now.\u201dShe would never buy an ice cream cone for her clients during working hours, not even at half price.With those words behind, she began making her way back to the ice cream shop, only to suddenly remember something important. She turned around to look at him.Bai Zhou looked back at her with an impatient expression and grumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s too late to apologize now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to reimburse me for yesterday\u2019s ingredients.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You didn\u2019t even leave anything behind for me when you left yesterday! I was so hungry in the middle of the night that I had to call for delivery!\u201d\u201cYou were the one who asked me to take everything away with me when I left.\u201d Ji Fanyin paused for a moment before asking doubtfully, \u201cIf you wanted me to buy you something, why did you reject my offer to treat you to an ice cream cone earlier?\u201d\u201cWhen did I ever say that I want you to buy me anything?\u201d Bai Zhou immediately refuted with a disgusted look on his face. \u201cJi Fanyin, don\u2019t be so narcissistic.\u201d\u201cYoung master Bai, I know that this bit of money is no more than pocket change to you, so I am certain that you have only forgotten to reimburse me. There is no chance that you\u2019d be intentionally delaying the reimbursement, right?\u201d said Ji Fanyin.Feeling like his integrity was being questioned, Bai Zhou clenched his jaws. He angrily whipped out his phone and transferred the money to Ji Fanyin on the spot to prove his innocence.He only remembered that the amount was five digits and the first digit was \u20181\u2019, so he decided to round up the figure.In less than a minute\u2019s time, 20,000 dollars was transferred from one bank account to another.\u201cI assume that the extra amount you sent over is a tip for my service?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin as she looked at the message she received from the bank. Not intending to return the extra amount, she quickly added, \u201cThanks, young master Bai.\u201dShe bit down on her waffle cone and headed into the ice cream store, not sparing a glance at Bai Zhou at all.Compared to an entire set of high-class French cuisine ingredients, buying a couple of university students some ice cream cones wasn\u2019t expensive at all.By the time everyone had a uniquely colored ice cream cone in their hands, Bai Zhou muttered with a glum face that he was going to head back.Bai Zhou\u2019s buddies glanced at one another with conflicted looks on their faces. While they were determined to get to the bottom of this peculiar relationship between a senior and an alumnus of their school, they weren\u2019t so vicious as to actually ruin their date.After a brief moment of hesitation, they decided to leave with Bai Zhou.Ji Fanyin didn\u2019t stay for too long either. Her mind was still fixated on the movie review that she wasn\u2019t done with yet.So, she politely exchanged contact numbers with the young man before heading home.By the time she finally finished crafting the entire movie review\u2014she was so serious that one would have thought that she was writing a thesis\u2014it was already nightfall.Ji Fanyin took off her blue light glasses and headed to the fridge to look through the ingredients she had left from yesterday. While pondering about what to make for dinner, her phone suddenly rang.She cast a glance over, and her eyebrows shot up.She had already deleted most of her contact numbers ever since she moved out of the Ji Family a week ago, and the only ones who had called and messaged her during this period of time were her two clients.As for Ji Xinxin, they communicated via a video call application since she was overseas.The caller this time around was another number that was already stored in her contact, but it wasn\u2019t either of her two clients. Looking at the word \u2018Father\u2019 on the phone screen, she couldn\u2019t help but feel the irony of this situation.It had been little more than a week since she had moved out from the Ji Family. No matter how blind Father Ji and Mother Ji were, they should have noticed that someone was missing from their house, not to mention that Ji Fanyin even dropped them a message on WeChat to inform them of the matter in view of their blood ties.But ever since that day, neither Father Ji nor Mother Ji had dropped a call or asked how she was faring. It looked like they couldn\u2019t care less if she was alive or dead.Ji Fanyin casually accepted the call and put it on speakerphone before turning her attention back to the fridge. She greeted Father Ji with a casual \u201cHey\u201d.Her perfunctory greeting immediately brought about an outburst from Father Ji.\u201cHey what hey? You aren\u2019t going to call me father? You\u2019re really getting out of hand now! Go and learn a thing or two from your younger sister on how you should speak to your elders!\u201dJi Fanyin didn\u2019t have much respect for Father Ji since she wasn\u2019t \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019.Her attention remained focused on picking out two of the most beautiful bell peppers while asking nonchalantly, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dFather Ji lashed out angrily, \u201cWatch your tone! Do you still take me as your father?!\u201dJi Fanyin decided to clear away two of the nicer bell peppers today. So, she grabbed her ingredients, closed the fridge door, and swiped her finger across her phone screen, hanging up the call from Father Ji.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But around ten minutes later, while Ji Fanyin was busy working in the kitchen, Mother Ji dropped a call.Her tone was much more amicable compared to Father Ji\u2019s. She started off by calling Ji Fanyin by her nickname, saying, \u201cYinyin, are you doing well outside? If you don\u2019t have enough money on hand, feel free to ask us for more.\u201dJi Fanyin continued chopping her asparagus. She disregarded Mother Ji\u2019s hypocritical load of useless padding and repeated what she had told Father Ji earlier, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dMother Ji coughed awkwardly at Ji Fanyin\u2019s candidness, but she managed to keep her calm as if she was mentally prepared for this. Instead, she asked, \u201cWhere are you living at the moment?\u201d\u201cAre you planning to visit me?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin.Mother Ji hesitated for a long while before finally coming out clean, \u201cYour father and I\u2026 we\u2019re worried about you. Someone told your father that he saw you at a place where women with proper upbringing shouldn\u2019t be. Yinyin, be honest with me. Did you make any bad friends and visit inappropriate places with them?\u201dJi Fanyin thought about the places she had been to thus far and deduced that the place they were talking about was the bar she met Song Shiyu at the other night.\u201cIs there a problem with an adult visiting a bar?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin nonchalantly.Mother Ji immediately got agitated and exclaimed, \u201cOf course there is! How can a demure lady visit that kind of place? Think about how our family\u2019s friends would think of us if they were to find out about it!\u201dJi Fanyin turned on the tap and washed the knife as she asked calmly, \u201cYou called me for this?\u201d\u201cHow can you say that? Don\u2019t you know how serious this matter is? We\u2019re nagging you for your own good, or else\u2026\u201dThis means that there\u2019s nothing else.Ji Fanyin wiped her hands using a soft cloth before hanging up the phone once more. After that, she switched her phone to \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 mode. With this, the only ones who could contact her were her clients.It was only after she was done cooking, eating, and clearing the dishes that she checked her phone once more. By then, several hours had already passed.There were several missed calls from Mother Ji. She seemed to have noticed at some point that Ji Fanyin wasn\u2019t going to pick up her calls, so she decided to write long paragraphs in her WeChat instead.Ji Fanyin took a brief glance at them. The crux was basically that her actions had shamed her family, and that since she wasn\u2019t young anymore and wasn\u2019t planning to further her studies like Ji Xinxin, she should think about getting married, and that she had prepared a candidate for her, so on and so forth.Mother Ji appeared to have delved deeper into the background of the person she wanted to matchmake her with, but Ji Fanyin didn\u2019t bother to skim on.Why do rich people like matchmaking that much? First Song Shiyu, and now me.Ji Fanyin wasn\u2019t as patient as Song Shiyu as to bother sparing a meal\u2019s time to satisfy them.However, Father Ji and Mother Ji clearly weren\u2019t planning on giving up easily. If they ever uncovered her address, she would probably face some trouble from them.She took a sip of water as she thought about this issue, but she eventually decided that it was no big deal and tossed it to the back of her head.She was someone who had weathered through storms worse than this. Why should she get worried over something as minor as this?The world was huge. There were plenty of jobs and houses out there for her to pick from anyway.Other than that, she also received some messages from Ji Xinxin and the young man she had added to her WeChat\u2019s friend list earlier in the day.Ji Xinxin\u2019s message looked the same as usual, though she seemed to have casually mentioned Bai Zhou in it.As for the young man, he sent a particularly formal self-introduction, saying that his name was Chen Yunsheng, followed by a great deal of personal information like his age, hobbies, and hometown. He started off by asking if she had reached home, and an hour later, he timidly added: \u3010Are you still busy with work?\u3011Ji Fanyin ignored the former. She slipped a new disc into her player and started watching it while occasionally responding to the latter. By the time the movie came to an end, she said goodbye to him with a \u2018Good night\u2019.Chen Yunsheng was a decent and earnest person, so the hour she spent chatting with him while watching the movie was actually quite relaxing and enjoyable.When she put down her phone, she suddenly recalled that Zhao Qi hadn\u2019t contacted her for quite a while.Hmm\u2026 Forget it. It\u2019s normal for friends not to contact one another for a month or so.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were all tagged under \u2018Emotion Points\u2019, and they only started appearing earlier this afternoon.Ji Fanyin pondered for a moment before checking her Weibo in uncertainty.Just as she had expected, the movie review she had sent earlier in the afternoon had gone viral. It had been reposted more than 10,000 times, and the likes were severalfold of that\u2014and it wasn\u2019t showing any signs of losing steam yet.There were quite a lot of impassioned responses in the comments and reposts, some positive and some negative\u2026 but that didn\u2019t matter to Ji Fanyin.She casually checked the reposts calmly and soon determined the source of this abrupt explosion of popularity. It appeared that a celebrity had liked her movie review and hadn\u2019t unliked it yet.So, Ji Fanyin went to look up the celebrity, only to realize that he was a familiar face. Given that she had done a marathon of the movies in this world, it went without saying that she would recognize the influential four-time \u2018Best Actor\u2019 award winner, He Shen.Even from the perspective of an industry insider, Ji Fanyin felt that his acting skills were on the dot. He was definitely worthy of being called an artist.What was even rarer was that he was good-looking too.She would be happy to collaborate with him if she was still in the entertainment industry, but for now, probably not.In view that he had contributed so many Emotion Points to her, Ji Fanyin decided to \u2018Follow\u2019 him on Weibo, and the app immediately reflected that there was a mutual following between them.Ji Fanyin\u2019s eyebrows shot up.Celebrity accounts on Weibo were usually managed by professionals, and the celebrities themselves wouldn\u2019t be involved in the content posted, liked, or users followed.Even if the celebrity had a true passion for Weibo, they would secretly create a side account to play with.After all, the slightest mistake made by an official account could easily stir a riot, not to mention that celebrities usually had their schedule so completely jam-packed that they wouldn\u2019t have time to personally manage their accounts.Given He Shen\u2019s standing in the film industry, his Weibo account should be managed by a team\u2026\u2026 but He Shen wasn\u2019t in the film though?Ji Fanyin checked her Weibo messages, and she didn\u2019t receive any collaboration requests from He Shen\u2019s studio. In the end, she decided to close her Weibo and go to sleep.She had seen more than enough celebrities in her past life anyway. Interacting with a \u2018film emperor\u2019 was no big deal.\u2026The collaboration request from He Shen\u2019s studio belatedly arrived the following day.Ji Fanyin browsed through the message while brushing her teeth. The request was written formally, starting off with showering compliments on the sharpness and uniqueness of her review before extending an invitation for her to attend the premiere of He Shen\u2019s newest movie. Of course, she was expected to compose and post a review at the end of it.It was pretty normal for newly released films to employ an Internet Water Army to garner some good reviews on social media.(Internet Water Army refers to internet ghostwriters paid to post online comments with particular content.)But even so, it seemed odd that they went to the extent of following her with He Shen\u2019s official Weibo account. On top of that, they were only offering an invitation without any mention of money, which hinted that they weren\u2019t intending to buy good reviews from her.That being said, the amount of Emotion Points she received last night was really substantial. Unlike the usual ones she received from Song Shiyu and the others, a viral Weibo post continuously brought in more Emotion Points as long as it remained there as new readers were constantly stumbling upon the post.The amount earned from each individual might be small, but it was still something. There was no reason for her to turn it down, especially since it was something she liked doing and didn\u2019t take up too much of her time.After coming to a decision, she gargled her mouth before responding to the message with her address.The other party replied extremely quickly. They started off by sending her the time and location before informing her that the invitation letter would be sent to her home very soon.Ji Fanyin stared at the reply, and somehow, she felt that something was off with the tone.The first message was extremely formal, but the following ones were oddly casual, almost as if it was someone else.But when she looked at the message she had sent over, which contained only a cold and lofty address\u2026Yup, I\u2019m also pretty casual myself. I\u2019m in no position to talk about them.While walking out of her bathroom, she decided to give He Shen\u2019s studio a clear heads up first: \u3010I\u2019m honest with my reviews.\u3011I\u2019m not going to betray my conscience for you if you show me crap.The other party replied immediately:\u3010No problem, that\u2019s what we want too.\u3011Regardless of whether it was just a formality or not, Ji Fanyin felt more at ease after receiving their assurance. She noted down the date of the movie premiere in her schedule lest it accidentally clashed schedules with a client\u2019s reservation.If a clash really occurs\u2026 Well, that would depend on how much the client is willing to pay.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The movie premiere was the day after that.Song Shiyu didn\u2019t attempt to make any reservations this time around, but Bai Zhou did.\u201cI need a full-day reservation,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to practice visiting the amusement park\u201d\u201cTomorrow won\u2019t do,\u201d Ji Fanyin looked through her calendar and replied. \u201cHow about the day after tomorrow?\u201dThe location of the movie premiere was quite some distance away, so she should be able to finish up the review while returning home. With that, she should be able to sleep early and prepare herself for any appointments the next day.\u201cTomorrow won\u2019t do?\u201d Bai Zhou snorted in annoyance. \u201cYou sure have a packed schedule. Even bidding for classes isn\u2019t as troublesome as this.\u201dIt was a snide remark, but it did bring some inspiration to Ji Fanyin.Why don\u2019t I develop a simple application to make my schedule semi-public? With this, the clients wouldn\u2019t have to call me to make a reservation anymore. All they have to do is to check the application and pick out a convenient time.Ahhh, technology sure makes life easier.Ji Fanyin earnestly wrote down her idea into her book and decided to give more thought to its implementation when she had time.As convenient as automation sounded, she needed her clients to be willing to adopt it.Other than that, it was also time for her to start thinking about further increasing her clientele.Song Shiyu was running a company whereas Bai Zhou was still a student; the two of them wouldn\u2019t be enough to sufficiently occupy her time. In other words, it was time to find Fish No. 3.As a fellow \u2018King of the Seas\u2019, Ji Fanyin had a good idea of what was running through Ji Xinxin\u2019s mind.To Ji Xinxin, rearing fishes was probably a way for her to validate her charms. She wasn\u2019t limiting herself just to romantic involvements with her fishes. There were other varieties too, such as kinship, friendship, admiration, respect\u2026Ji Fanyin wasn\u2019t certain of the reason just yet, but she could tell that Ji Xinxin was obsessed with it, working under the notion that \u2018more is better\u2019.This resulted in the fishes in Ji Xinxin\u2019s pond being of varying quality.Based on her own memories, Ji Fanyin wrote down the names of all of the people she knew of that harbored significant goodwill toward Ji Xinxin and conducted a simple categorization.The first category were the ones introduced by the \u2018future\u2019 Song Shiyu; those who treated \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 as Ji Xinxin\u2019s substitute in order to alleviate their loneliness.She could remember six other people in this category, and throwing Song Shiyu and Bai Zhou into the mix as well, they added up to an auspicious eight.The second category was those whom she had to do her homework on carefully in order to filter out eligible candidates.Firstly, those who weren\u2019t sufficiently wealthy were out of the question since it wouldn\u2019t be as profitable. Secondly, the individual had to be sufficiently generous. She wouldn\u2019t be able to take it if her clients suddenly started haggling with her.Last but not least, as a person who valued appearances, she wanted clients who were decently good-looking.Her professionalism allowed her to be gentle and caring to anyone without losing her patience, but a good-looking client could still raise her tolerance level by a bit.Both Song Shiyu and Bai Zhou were lookers in their own rights.Whenever something infuriating occurred, just by looking at the other party\u2019s face, her anger level would subside from 100 to\u2026 around 90, perhaps.Last but not least, the other party must be willing to bite onto her hook.Ji Fanyin\u2019s conscience didn\u2019t ache at all from earning money off Song Shiyu and Bai Zhou, but the same didn\u2019t necessarily apply to the others.Filtering the list down to those who fulfilled all three criteria\u2026Oh? There are still quite a few people to choose from. It looks like her fishery is bigger than I thought.The next step would be to approach and probe potential clients to gauge their level of interest. \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 was acquainted with Song Shiyu and Bai Zhou right from the start, making it easier for her to take them down as compared to a complete stranger.If it was a stranger, she would have to start from the very first step of socializing\u2014getting to know one another.So, she began crafting out a mindmap to brainstorm and plan her next move.Theoretically speaking, it was likely that she might bump into some of the candidates at the movie premiere tomorrow afternoon. She remembered Ji Xinxin had a fish that received the prestigious \u2018Best New Director Award\u2019 right after graduation, and he had a good face too.On top of that, he even tried to kidnap Ji Xinxin and force himself on her.His obsession made him a potential client.After Ji Fanyin finished her homework for the movie premiere, she took one last look at the ticket and flicked it lightly with her finger.This is a schedule where I can get a lot of things done at once. There\u2019s no way I can miss it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Invitation tickets were only offered to those in the same industry and family members. Even the reporters were only invited to the press conference; they couldn\u2019t enter the theater to enjoy the movie.Ji Fanyin was planning to just watch the movie and head home to write her review, so she didn\u2019t bother dressing up. She wore light casual wear and a pair of glasses for her slight astigmatism.(Astigmatism is a vision problem that causes light to look a bit fuzzy)But when she arrived at the entrance of the venue, she found herself faced with an army of reporters who were ready to interview anyone who tried to head in.Those with invitation letters in their hands weren\u2019t exactly dressed in high fashion, but they were at least wearing suits and gowns.Only Ji Fanyin was wearing a loose sweater and a pair of jeans with her hair scattered casually down her shoulder. She gave off the impression of an arts student who was dressed casually for town.Most people in her position would head home to change their clothes, but Ji Fanyin calmly put on her glasses and proceeded into the venue.There were two individuals ahead of her who were stopped by the reporters and were in the midst of their interview, and Ji Fanyin walked past them from behind. She ignored all of the reporters who tried to shove their microphones toward her.It was not just once or twice that she had gotten onto the news for putting on airs, and the people in her previous world were already all used to it.The young lady welcoming the guests at the entrance bowed to Ji Fanyin and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to have you here. May I have your invitation letter?\u201dJi Fanyin passed her invitation letter over and waited for the other party to verify it before entering the venue.It was shortly after she walked in that she belatedly realized that the two individuals who were being interviewed earlier looked a little familiar.Where have I seen them?She turned around to take a look, only to see a couple walking in with linked arms. Just like that, the three of them met gazes with one another.Of the couple, the man immediately glared at Ji Fanyin furiously.Ji Fanyin: \u201c\u2026?\u201dWho are you?The woman quickly unlinked her arm from her husband\u2019s and hurried over to Ji Fanyin. With a hushed tone, she exclaimed, \u201cHow did you get in here?!\u201dJi Fanyin shot a glance at the female receptionist at the entrance before turning to look at the woman standing before her. She thought that the woman\u2019s head might not be working too well, so she replied, \u201cI passed through the walls to get in here.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of nonsense are you spouting! You\u2026 Did you sneak in here to meet Shiyu because you knew that he\u2019ll be here today?\u201d the woman asked furiously.It was only upon hearing those words that realization struck Ji Fanyin. She took another good look at the couple in front of her.Ah, they are \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019s\u2019 parents. It has been so long that I nearly forgot about them.\u201cIs Song Shiyu coming?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin nonchalantly. \u201cThat has nothing to do with me. I\u2019m here for work.\u201dMother Ji immediately shut her down angrily, \u201cYou nearly failed your graduation, so what kind of work could you possibly have? Stop embarrassing yourself here. I\u2019ll have security drag you out right now. You really are getting out of hand!\u201dShe reached forth to grab Ji Fanyin\u2019s arm, but the latter dodged it easily.Ji Fanyin shook the invitation letter in her hand and said with a smile, \u201cAre you sure that the two of you, who value your reputation so much, really want to humiliate yourself by having an argument here over whether my invitation letter is real or not?\u201dOf course, neither Father Ji nor Mother Ji would be willing to do anything that risked sullying their reputation, so they could only try to stifle their anger as they watched Ji Fanyin walk away.The venue was decorated to resemble a mini theater, and every invitation letter was tagged to a seat.There were some who made use of the time before the movie premiere to socialize. Ji Fanyin was intending to head straight to her seat and settle down, but the earlier confrontation with Father Ji and Mother Ji changed her mind.They won\u2019t give up that easily. I should find a way to resolve this once and for all so as to avoid further trouble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Such women gave off an imposing disposition even through their strides, and they were in the limelight no matter what kind of social occasion they were in.\u201cAre you Miss \u2018FeatureYin Films\u2019?\u201d The confident woman offered her hand forth. \u201cI am He Shen\u2019s manager, Zhang Ning. May I know how I should address you?\u201d\u201cI am Ji Fanyin,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin as she shook the other party\u2019s hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to address me formally.\u201dZhang Ning chuckled softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be so young.\u201dJi Fanyin felt that Zhang Ning was driving at something here.\u201cHe Shen has something to deal with so he isn\u2019t here yet, so he got me to greet you in his place. He says that he hopes to receive your earnest movie review.\u201d Zhang Ning gestured to the resting lounge next to the reception area. \u201cThere\u2019s still some time before the premiere, so would you like to take a seat and rest there first?\u201dJi Fanyin was even more perplexed by this abrupt offer.She pondered for a moment before nodding. \u201cAlright.\u201dIs He Shen one of Ji Xinxin\u2019s fishes too?That doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s impossible that no one would know of it if Ji Xinxin managed to snag someone as outstanding as that.\u201cI\u2019ll walk you there,\u201d said Zhang Ning as she began leading the way. \u201cI was still worried that you\u2019d feel uncomfortable being put in such an environment, but it looks like you\u2019re already used to it.\u201d\u201cYou mean chatting with others?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin with a smile. \u201cThose two are my parents. They didn\u2019t know that I\u2019d be coming.\u201dZhang Ning revealed a look of surprise. She turned around to take a glance at Father Ji and Mother Ji.Ji Fanyin also halted her footsteps. She turned her head around and saw Father Ji and Mother Ji staring at her too.She was standing right in front of a room with a sign labeled \u2018VIP Lounge\u2019, which explained why their faces were practically written with looks that said \u2018How are you able to go in there?\u2019Ji Fanyin directed a faint smile at the biased couple before making her way into the lounge.Children were like mirrors. They reflected whatever one showed them.When parents refuted everything about their children, it was inevitable that their children would think that they were utterly useless.Bias wasn\u2019t something that was formed overnight. \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 had slowly lost her confidence and pride bit by bit over many years.Even if it wasn\u2019t Father Ji and Mother Ji\u2019s intention to drive \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 to her death, there was no doubt that they had to take some blame for her eventual suicide. To make things worse, they didn\u2019t think that they had done anything wrong at all.Ji Fanyin couldn\u2019t think of a reason why she should even accord them respect.------Yoo hang out with us in our Discord~ Got a neat community there!Mission 1 (\u0e07\ufe21'-'\ufe20)\u0e078/10 unique commenters on a chapter (Just a bit more @@)Reward: 1 bonus chapterI recently started a Patreon (\uff61\uff65\uff65\uff61)If you have spare cash and you don't know where to spend it on, do consider supporting me a little in exchange for reading a couple of chapters in advance \u25cf\ufe4f\u25cf)Advanced chapters link:\u00a0https://100kpsi.schk.co/Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Unable to take it anymore, he grabbed Mother Ji\u2019s hand and marched over to the VIP Lounge.\u201cPlease show me your invitation letter.\u201dThe security guards stationed in front of the VIP Lounge did their job and stopped them.\u201cLad, do you not recognize who I am?\u201d asked Father Ji lividly.The security guard replied with a tone that was neither humble nor disrespectful, \u201cI am new here, so I\u2019m afraid that I don\u2019t recognize the two of you. I\u2019d appreciate it if you could show me your invitation letters so that I could verify if you have access to the VIP Lounge.\u201dMother Ji gently consoled Father Ji while reaching into her bag to take out their invitation letters.The security guard quickly scanned the QR code on the invitation letters before turning back to the couple with a troubled look on his face, saying, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the two of you aren't on the VIP list.\u201d\u201cThe woman who entered earlier is our daughter. Why is she able to access the VIP Lounge?\u201d asked Father Ji with a voice of suppressed rage.\u201cAre you referring to the one who entered with Miss Zhang Ning earlier?\u201d asked the security guard.\u201c\u2026 The one who walked in with her earlier is Zhang Ning?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d the security guard replied with a perplexed look on his face. \u201cPardon me, but\u2026 is it possible that you don\u2019t recognize the organizer of today\u2019s event?\u201dFather Ji\u2019s complexion turned awful.The Ji Family was in the middle class. They were still a hurdle away from reaching the \u2018capitalist\u2019 class in each industry.Father Ji and Mother Ji thought that there was a chance for them to reach that level thanks to Ji Xinxin\u2019s halo, but who could have thought that Ji Fanyin would actually reach upper society ahead of them?It was then that Zhang Ning walked over with Ji Fanyin.\u201cAh, you\u2019re from the Ji Family! I believe that they were invited here by Song Shiyu,\u201d she said. She then turned to Ji Fanyin and added, \u201cWe can invite them into the lounge as well if you like.\u201dJi Fanyin couldn\u2019t even be bothered to figure out whether Zhang Ning was trying to sound her out, so she replied curtly, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201dI want my peace.\u201cThe drinks are there, and we have Japanese food and dessert around too. Feel free to get anything you like,\u201d Zhang Ning roughly introduced the layout of the resting room to her. \u201cYou should feel much more comfortable here if you don\u2019t wish to socialize with others.\u201dBetween Zhang Ning and Ji Fanyin, one was dressed flamboyantly whereas the other was wearing casual clothes. This created a striking contrast that made them quite eye-catching.Nevertheless, of the few people in the lounge, none showed any intention of approaching them for a conversation.Ji Fanyin preferred social settings where everyone was cold and proud. It was less tiring that way.\u201cI still have matters to attend to. Will you be alright here by yourself?\u201d Zhang Ning led Ji Fanyin to one of the tables to take a seat. \u201cI believe that He Shen would like to meet you once he arrives.\u201dInstead of leaving right away, Zhang Ning blinked her eyes suggestively at Ji Fanyin, as if trying to encourage her curiosity.Ji Fanyin decided to play along with her. \u201cWhy?\u201dZhang Ning smiled in satisfaction and said, \u201cHe Shen fell in love with your reviews at first sight. He sees you as his soulmate, saying that the points you focused on in your film evaluations are the same as his. He was the one who insisted on having me invite you to his movie premiere.\u201dJi Fanyin\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cHe was the one who followed my Weibo account?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201d Zhang Ning winked mischievously. \u201cHe even grumbled to me that you have only watched three of his movies, and none of them was the one which he was the most satisfied with\u2026 Cough, don\u2019t tell He Shen that I told you all of this, alright?\u201dJi Fanyin couldn\u2019t figure out Zhang Ning\u2019s rationale for revealing all of this to her, so she decided to keep up her guard and respond formally, \u201cI\u2019m flattered by Mr He\u2019s high opinion of me. I hope that this collaboration between us will be a delightful one.\u201dZhang Ning sent Ji Fanyin a flying kiss before strutting out of the VIP Lounge.There was still fifteen minutes before the movie premiere, so Ji Fanyin headed to the drinks station to get herself a cup of juice.Unlike the ladies dressed in gowns, Ji Fanyin was able to have her fill of drinks without having to worry about her stomach sticking out.While Ji Fanyin was drinking her juice using the straws provided, a few more people entered the resting room. She could sense their gazes casually sweeping past her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a message from Chen Yunsheng.He had sent her a photo of him beside a basketball court. His hair was drenched with sweat, and he was holding a bottle of water in his hand. He had a bright smile on his face that revealed his white teeth, making him appear like the typical handsome second lead in romance dramas.Ji Fanyin felt like she had returned to her youthful years just by looking at the photo.Chen Yunsheng: \u3010We had the semifinals for an inter-school basketball competition today. It was a close one, but our team won in the end! >AJi Fanyin looked at the \u2018>ABefore she could reply, Chen Yunsheng had already followed up with another message: \u3010The finals are on next Sunday.

Her long eyelashes drooped a little as she added, \u201cDid you mistake me for her?\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d The man coughed lightly to conceal his earlier rudeness. \u201cI was just thinking that\u2026 the two of you really look alike.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re twins,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin. She gestured to the seat beside her and asked, \u201cWould you like to take a seat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard about you from Xinxin,\u201d the man said as he took a seat. He stared intently at Ji Fanyin\u2019s face for a moment before finally continuing on, \u201cBut you\u2019re very different from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d remarked Ji Fanyin. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve changed quite a bit in recent days. I\u2019m Ji Fanyin. How should I address you?\u201d\u201cAh,\u201d exclaimed the man awkwardly. \u201cI am Cen Xiangyang.\u201dJi Fanyin also let out an \u201cAh\u201d.He\u2019s here, the rising director-cum-future kidnapper-cum-attempted rapist Cen Xiangyang.Cen Xiangyang\u2019s eyes lit up in anticipation as he asked, \u201cYou\u2019ve heard about me from Xinxin?\u201dJi Fanyin chose to respond in a roundabout manner, \u201cXinxin and I don\u2019t really talk about such stuff.\u201dCen Xiangyang lowered his gaze in disappointment.He had a \u2018salt type face\u2019 which was considered trendy nowadays. He didn\u2019t have pronounced facial features that made him stand out amidst a crowd. Instead, he looked more like an artistic young man. Paired with his gold-rimmed glasses, he had a decent, refined appearance.It\u2019s impossible to tell that he\u2019s a criminal in the making just by his appearance and the way he talks.Now that I think about it, Song Shiyu isn\u2019t any better than him either.Cen Xiangyang soon snapped out of his disappointment and said, \u201cXinxin seems to be really busy after arriving in France. We weren\u2019t able to talk to each other as much as before. Does she still call home often? How is she doing now?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think that she\u2019ll be able to adapt well to any environment?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin in response.\u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d Cen Xiangyang chuckled softly. \u201cBut while I trust her capability, I still can\u2019t help but worry about all sorts of things when she\u2019s not in my line of sight. I really wish that she could stay by my side forever, never having to part ways.\u201dJi Fanyin looked at him quietly.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have said all of that to you.\u201d Cen Xiangyang snapped out of his trance and apologized sheepishly. \u201cI\u2019m a director. What about you?\u201dIt was then that a few more individuals appeared at the lounge\u2019s entrance.Ji Fanyin casually shot a glance over and saw Song Shiyu bringing Father Ji and Mother Ji in. Song Shiyu cast a casual sweeping glance across the room and immediately met her gaze. His complexion immediately darkened a little in displeasure.Not at work at the moment, Ji Fanyin raised her cup of juice and directed a faint smile in Song Shiyu\u2019s direction before turning her head back to answer Cen Xiangyang\u2019s question.\u201cIf I were to put it in my own words, I\u2019m a dream weaver,\u201d she replied.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ll be heading out to take my seat. What about you?\u201dFather Ji and Mother Ji, who had entered the VIP Lounge, were currently heading her way.Cen Xiangyang also rose to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you. What\u2019s your seat number?\u201dThe two of them quickly compared their seat numbers. One of them was a slightly known director whereas the other was a humble movie reviewer. Needless to say, their seats were far away from one another.\u201cLet\u2019s talk after the movie premiere.\u201d Cen Xiangyang took out his phone. \u201cYou\u2019re working in the film industry too since you were able to get an invitation here, right? Shall we exchange contacts?\u201dHe spoke in such a natural manner that it didn\u2019t feel like he was flirting at all, more like two individuals exchanging contacts for work.It happened that Ji Fanyin viewed him as potential Fish No. 3, so she accepted his offer and took out her phone. However, this exchange was put to a halt by Song Shiyu.The approaching Song Shiyu first directed a nod toward Cen Xiangyang before he turned to Ji Fanyin and said, \u201cJi Fanyin, your parents are worried about you.\u201dJi Fanyin couldn\u2019t help but notice that Song Shiyu\u2019s gaze had lingered on her phone screen for a little too long, as if there was something on it that was of interest to him.\u201cI\u2019ve already greeted them earlier.\u201d Ji Fanyin couldn\u2019t be bothered to hold a conversation with Song Shiyu outside service hours, so she decided to take her leave. \u201cIf you may excuse me.\u201dShe bade Cen Xiangyang farewell before walking out of the VIP Lounge, leaving the two men behind.She knew that it didn\u2019t matter whether they exchanged contacts here or not. Cen Xiangyang wouldn\u2019t give up that easily.\u201cMr Song, are you acquainted with Miss Ji too?\u201d asked Cen Xiangyang. \u201cAh, she is Xinxin\u2019s older sister after all. I guess it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that you\u2019re acquainted with both sisters given the close ties you have with the Ji Family. I must say, the two sisters really resemble one another. If Miss Ji could just change her disposition a little, she would completely be able to stand in as her younger sister.\u201dThe words \u2018stand in\u2019 stabbed into Song Shiyu\u2019s heart like a sharp thorn, making him frown in discomfort.It was a fact that he thought of Ji Fanyin as Ji Xinxin\u2019s substitute.\u201cSpeaking of which, Mr Song, you have Miss Ji\u2019s contact number, right? Could you forward it to me?\u201dSong Shiyu: \u201c\u2026\u201d I\u2019ve deleted it and haven\u2019t added her back yet.\u201cDon\u2019t mess with her,\u201d Song Shiyu said as he rubbed his temples to alleviate the throbbing pain in his head. \u201cNo matter what, she is Xinxin\u2019s older sister.\u201dCen Xiangyang was stunned for a moment before laughing heartily, \u201cOh? What do you mean by \u2018mess with her\u2019? All I want to do is to befriend her. Mr Song, don\u2019t you think that you\u2019re overstepping your boundaries here? In what capacity are you warning me? Xinxin\u2019s boyfriend? Or an ordinary friend?\u201dDespite being too busy to attend Ji Xinxin\u2019s farewell banquet, Cen Xiangyan was still aware of the events that transpired that day.Compared to the others who had yet to confess to Ji Xinxin, Song Shiyu, who had been rejected by Ji Xinxin, was clearly out of the race.\u201cEven if I\u2019m just an ordinary friend, I\u2019m still closer to her than you are,\u201d replied Song Shiyu with a graceful smile. \u201cJi Fanyin isn\u2019t as easy to deal with as you think, Cen Xiangyang.\u201dThe old Ji Fanyin was a passive person who quietly accepted what others dished out to her, but the current Ji Fanyin was capable of hiding her own feelings in order to protect herself\u2026\u2026 though in Song Shiyu\u2019s view, her disguise was still far too vulnerable.Often, he thought how wonderful it would be if he could just place Ji Fanyin\u2019s affection for him into Ji Xinxin. If he could, the three of them wouldn\u2019t have to suffer like this.Cen Xiangyang shrugged off Song Shiyu\u2019s warning with a smile and replied half-jokingly, \u201cMr Song, your words are really misleading. I almost thought that the one you love isn\u2019t Xinxin but her older sister.\u201dSong Shiyu smiled in response to that remark, but on the inside, he was sneering.If I really had feelings for Ji Fanyin, I would have long gotten together with her given her devotion toward me. It\u2019s simply impossible to force a person\u2019s feelings.Seeing that Song Shiyu wasn\u2019t bothering to reply anymore, Cen Xiangyang chose not to harp on the topic either. He gracefully gestured Song Shiyu outward to make their way to their seats.Along the way, he noticed that Song Shiyu\u2019s complexion looked a little awful and asked concernedly, \u201cMr Song, are you feeling unwell? You should head home if you\u2019re ill. You shouldn\u2019t push yourself too much.\u201dSong Shiyu shot Cen Xiangyang a glance and said, \u201cThanks for your concern, but I\u2019m fine.\u201dIt was in the midst of summer, but several days of consecutive flash rains had caused the weather to turn a little chilly. It was easy to catch a cold under such conditions and Song Shiyu was, unfortunately, one of the victims.However, he turned a blind eye to his cold and remained focused on his work.For some reason, he had started to think that earning money was of utmost importance. As long as he had enough money on hand, he could even buy love that was just like the real one.All he needed was an endless stream of cash.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was so focused on the movie that she didn\u2019t even notice that the person sitting next to her had swapped with someone else halfway through the movie.It was only when the ending credits started rolling that Ji Fanyin finally let out a deep breath.It was a movie filled with tension. The male lead had weaved an elaborate scheme that felt like it could unravel at the slightest bit of carelessness and bring him to his death, almost as if he was walking on a tightrope. Ji Fanyin found herself sitting on the edge of her seat throughout the movie.\u201cHow was the movie?\u201d the person beside her asked softly.\u201cIt was exquisite,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin subconsciously. \u201cFrom the camera shots, the meticulous attention to details regarding the scheme, to the gradual change in the mindsets of the key characters, everything is harmoniously weaved together to relay an impactful story. I believe that this film has a shot at winning film festivals.\u201d\u201cWhat about He Shen\u2019s acting?\u201dThere was no hesitation in Ji Fanyin\u2019s voice as she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. He seems to be the kind of actor who fully immerses himself in the characters he\u2019s portraying. With how deep he has gone for this film, it might be hard for him to recover from it.\u201dShe naturally got more chatty when talking about films.After offering her evaluation, Ji Fanyin raised her head to look at the person beside her and asked, \u201cWhat about you?\u201dThe dim lighting made it hard for her to see the other party\u2019s expression, so all she could hear was his indistinct chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m of the same view as you.\u201dHe stood up after that\u2014he was surprisingly tall\u2014and started walking away.JI Fanyin: \u201c\u2026?\u201d Does he urgently need the loo?After the credits scene finished rolling, the lights turned on, and everyone rose to their feet and started applauding.Ji Fanyin subconsciously glanced at the seat beside her. It was empty.Following that was the interview for the film crew.Ji Fanyin had no intention of asking any questions, but she took out the notebook and pen she had prepared beforehand anyway since the perspective taken by the film crew could be vastly different from that of the audience. In order to write a proper review, it was important for her to be thorough in her understanding.The Q&amp;A session proceeded smoothly under the host\u2019s lead.Ji Fanyin noted down a few important details. She already had a rough idea as to how she was going to write the movie review.Soon, the premiere was officially concluded, and the crowd in the theater started to take their leave. Ji Fanyin also rose from her seat and prepared to head home.It was already getting late, and she still had work the next morning.While she was walking out, she noticed Cen Xiangyang making his way toward her from the front row seats. However, he was soon stopped by Song Shiyu, and the two of them began chatting with smiles on their faces.Ji Fanyin attributed it to mutual attraction between perverts allowing them to get along with one another.In any case, she decided to turn a blind eye to it and continued walking her way, but she still ended up getting halted by someone else.\u201cJi Fanyin, wait a moment!\u201d Zhang Ning shouted while rushing over. With a relieved smile from having caught up with her, she said, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t in a rush, I\u2019d like to introduce you to a few people.\u201dJi Fanyin was intrigued. \u201cYou intend to introduce me to others?\u201dIt went without saying that networking was much easier if someone was willing to introduce one into a circle, but this privilege was usually granted only to those in a close relationship, such as mentors and mentees, family members, or working partners.There was no such relationship between her and Zhang Ning to justify such an act of generosity.\u201cOf course! Since you\u2019re going to write a review for us, it\u2019s only right for you to meet our film crew, right?\u201d said Zhang Ning as she dragged Ji Fanyin along with her.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d remarked Ji Fanyin. \u201cI thought that you were going to bring me over to meet Mr He.\u201dZhang Ning\u2019s smile froze up for a brief moment before she laughed off the remark. \u201cHe had to leave early because he has another schedule. You should be able to meet him next time.\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with a deep smile. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d\u201cHow was the movie? Did you enjoy it?\u201d Zhang Ning changed the subject.\u201cI love it.\u201d Ji Fanyin did a quick internal evaluation before adding, \u201cIt\u2019s in my top three.\u201dZhang Ning wasn\u2019t satisfied with the evaluation. She pouted like a little girl and complained, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it your top one?\u201dJi Fanyin responded with a polite smile. It went without saying that her favorite movie was her own.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Some of them even took the initiative to propose exchanging contacts, saying that they could collaborate together on projects if the opportunity ever arose.By the end of it, Ji Fanyin had quite a few new names in her friend list.From their interactions, it soon became apparent to Ji Fanyin that Zhang Ning was not just an ordinary manager. There was something more to her background.\u201cHow did you get here? Shall I get someone to drive you home?\u201d asked Zhang Ning.\u201cI took a cab,\u201d said Ji Fanyin as she waved her phone. \u201cIt\u2019ll only take an hour and a half.\u201dCab fare was expensive in the city, but it was definitely within Ji Fanyin\u2019s means to pay for.\u201cI think it\u2019ll be better if I get someone to drive you. It just so happens that He Shen drove off by himself, so we have two idle assistants on standby,\u201d Zhang Ning insisted.Ji Fanyin pondered over it a little, but she decided not to turn down the other party\u2019s goodwill. After bidding farewell to Zhang Ning, she left with the two assistants from He Shen\u2019s studio via the side entrance and got into a low profile van.After giving the assistants her address, she whipped out her phone and began drafting her movie review.When the car left the parking lot and was driving by the entrance of the venue, Ji Fanyin took a look outside and saw Father Ji and Mother Ji lingering around the entrance. Song Shiyu was with them, but he was clutching his forehead in discomfort.Is he sick? A person is usually the most vulnerable when he\u2019s ill\u2026Such a thought arose in Ji Fanyin\u2019s mind, but the van gradually sped up and tossed Song Shiyu and the others out of her sight and mind.Forget it, there\u2019s no need for unnecessary interaction with my clients outside of working hours. I don\u2019t want any misunderstanding here. If the client has a need for me, he\u2019ll naturally drop me a call.\u2026\u201cAhhh, she\u2019s gone,\u201d remarked Cen Xiangyang lamentingly. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten her contact yet.\u201dSong Shiyu ignored him.\u201cXinxin doesn\u2019t seem to be interested in dating at the moment, so Ji Fanyin would be good for a pastime. It\u2019s better to have an imitation than nothing at all, don\u2019t you agree, Mr Song?\u201d asked Cen Xiangyang. \u201cThere\u2019s bound to be someone who knows her. Even if you refuse to give me her contact, I\u2019ll still be able to obtain it by asking around.\u201dHis voice was suppressed so that only Song Shiyu was able to hear it.\u201cCourt her if you want,\u201d replied Song Shiyu casually. \u201cI wish you all the best.\u201d\u201cYou seem quite confident that I\u2019d fail,\u201d said Cen Xiangyang as he stroked his chin. \u201cIs it because Ji Fanyin isn\u2019t interested in dating, or do you know her type? \u2026 Oh, wait a moment. I think I get it.\u201dCen Xiangyang suddenly looked at Song Shiyu with peculiar eyes.\u201cCould it be that Ji Fanyin likes you?\u201dSong Shiyu casually placed his hands into his coat before turning over to look at Cen Xiangyang with curled lips. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Ji Fanyin likes me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All that was left to do was for her to quickly polish it up one last time later on.Upon reaching their destination, the two assistants insisted on seeing her off to her apartment building before finally driving off.The first thing Ji Fanyin did upon reaching home was to wash up before quickly editing her movie review. Once everything was satisfactory, she posted it before heading off to bed. It was only slightly past eleven-thirty.There was some hype surrounding the movie due to its pre-release promotion, so Ji Fanyin\u2019s review swiftly drew a great deal of attention. It didn\u2019t take long for it to become one of the trending posts.It was no easy feat to write an immersive movie review without spoiling the movie itself, just like how it was difficult for a web novel to reach the top place. However, Ji Fanyin\u2019s review stirred excitement and suspense, almost as if she was creating another separate piece of artwork on top of the movie.Many netizens felt great anticipation for the movie after reading her review.That very night, the presale tickets for the movie, \u2018Beneath the Waters\u2019, starring He Shen broke through the ten million hurdle.The following morning, when the meritorious Ji Fanyin checked on the \u2018Temptation of Home\u2019 app and saw the massive influx of Emotion Points, she felt like she was floating amidst fluffy clouds.Not even the naggy instructions Bai Zhou sent her were able to ruin her good mood.After dressing up in accordance with the client\u2019s pedantic demands, Ji Fanyin quickly finished her make-up and headed out to meet Bai Zhou while humming a joyful melody.Thanks to Bai Zhou, she got to experience a hardcore motorcycle ride during a date to the amusement park.Who in the world would choose a motorcycle as a choice of vehicle to drive a lady wearing a dress for a date at Disneyland?Ah yes, Bai Zhou would.It was fortunate that Ji Fanyin had taken Bai Zhou\u2019s unusual brain wiring into account when making preparations, so she opted to wear a culotte instead of a skirt and brought a coat along as well.When they arrived at the destination, Ji Fanyin took off her helmet and demurely tidied up her long hair that had been messed up by the furious wind resistance.If this darned kid were to treat Ji Xinxin in the same manner, he would definitely be blacklisted from her list of date-able candidates.Of course, Ji Fanyin wouldn\u2019t say such words aloud.When Bai Zhou excitedly asked her if the wind from cruising down the expressway was refreshing, Ji Fanyin scratched her cheeks shyly and replied, \u201cIt was refreshing, but a little scary too. There were a few times while we were heading downward that I nearly wanted to wrap my hands around your waist out of fear.\u201dBai Zhou was taken aback for a brief moment before the tips of his ears started to furiously redden. He quickly took out the entrance tickets and started heading in. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dBarely a few steps later, he suddenly turned his head around vigilantly and instructed, \u201cWait. Take out your phone and turn it off first.\u201dJi Fanyin obediently took out her phone from her bag.Bai Zhou unhesitatingly snatched it over and switched it off. He even double-checked it before finally returning it to Ji Fanyin.Ji Fanyin figured that he might have been traumatized by Song Shiyu\u2019s unexpected phone call while they were in the art room the other day.It doesn\u2019t really matter anyway. I reckon Song Shiyu is still ill at the moment anyway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had gone through tougher times back in her acting days, so a mere day at Disneyland was not an issue at all.The two of them ended up walking around the amusement park and playing till nightfall.To Ji Fanyin\u2019s surprise, it seemed like Bai Zhou had earnestly done his homework to make the best out of their time. He knew the roads that minimized traveling time, the order to visit the rides in so as to reduce waiting time, as well as the existence of \u2018Fastpass\u2019.He also brought her to the more famous activities and tourist spots that had been promoted by famous influencers.It might have been normal for other people, but for the self-centered Bai Zhou, this was nothing short of a miracle.\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to come here since my younger years,\u201d said Bai Zhou as he tugged at the string attached to a helium balloon in his hand.This helium balloon consisted of two layers. The outer layer was a transparent sphere whereas the inside was a yellow Mickey Mouse.\u201cYou had such childhood days too?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin.At this very moment, she was earnestly thinking that this balloon was too goddamned expensive.\u201c\u2026 Mm. When this place first opened, many of my classmates came here with their parents,\u201d said Bai Zhou with crestfallen eyes. \u201cAll of them talked about how fun this place was, and it made me really envious.\u201dJi Fanyin took a moment to recollect Bai Zhou\u2019s background.His parents are in a marriage of convenience, promising not to interfere in each other\u2019s private life as long as they didn\u2019t bring in illegitimate children. Due to that, he grew up in a house filled with nannies and bodyguards.\u201cI came here by myself later on,\u201d said Bai Zhou coldly, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t fun at all.\u201dJi Fanyin tugged the balloon out of Bai Zhou\u2019s hand before gently tying it on his wrist. \u201cThen was it fun to come here with me today?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Zhou looked at the knot tied around his wrist before raising his eyes to look at Ji Fanyin. \u201c\u2026 Everything is interesting as long as I\u2019m with big sis. What interests me isn\u2019t the place but being with you.\u201d\u201cGood boy,\u201d said Ji Fanyin with a smile as she patted Bai Zhou\u2019s head. \u201cWhere are we heading to next?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Fireworks.\u201dEven before the sun fully set, the crowd had already started making their way toward the best spot to catch the fireworks. Not too far away from the castle was a fountain that provided a good view of the fireworks, so there was a crowd gathered there.Bai Zhou wasn\u2019t nervous at all to see the area fully occupied. With the sheer power of money, he managed to secure two spots for them.The couple who accepted his offer happily left hand-in-hand while the others felt envious at the small fortune they had earned so easily.That being said, the two spots weren\u2019t exactly spacious, such that any couple sitting there would have to bump bums. Ji Fanyin sat down on where the lady was sitting earlier and patted on the empty seat beside her, saying, \u201cBai Zhou, come over.\u201dBai Zhou hesitated for a moment before awkwardly walking over and squeezing into the remaining space.There was still some time before the fireworks show, so the youths gathered around the fountain got into their own conversations.Amongst them, a woman complained coyly to her boyfriend, \u201cMy legs hurt.\u201dHer boyfriend, who was holding two huge bags, sighed helplessly and said, \u201cI already told you not to wear a pair of new shoes here.\u201d\u201cBut these shoes are pretty!\u201d exclaimed the woman indignantly. \u201cOf course I have to wear the nicest shoes and skirt for our date!\u201dHow could the boyfriend possibly complain when she had already put it in such a manner? He raised his hands in resignation and said, \u201cAlright, alright. Let me take a look at your feet.\u201dHe half-kneeled onto the ground and carefully took off her exquisite leather shoes, only to see that her ankles were already bleeding.The boyfriend: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe woman quickly took this initiative to explain herself and garner some sympathy before her boyfriend could scold her, \u201cI also didn\u2019t expect the back of the shoes to be so rough. It hurts, wuuuuuu.\u201dThe boyfriend sighed yet again before asking those around them, \u201cSorry, do you have any plaster?\u201dOne of them happened to have it.The boyfriend placed the woman\u2019s leg on his own thigh and carefully placed the plaster on her wound before putting her shoes back on. His movements were so gentle that it looked as if he was handling something fragile.The woman shyly covered her face and said, \u201cQuick. Everyone is staring\u2026\u201d\u201cMake sure to wear a more comfortable pair of shoes next time if you know that it\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d said the boyfriend.Ji Fanyin looked at the bickering couple with her chin resting on her arm, a heartened smile on her face.------Yoo hang out with us in our Discord~ Got a neat community there!Mission 1 (\u0e07\ufe21'-'\ufe20)\u0e0710/10 unique commenters on a chapter (Just a bit more @@)Reward: 1 bonus chapter (Cleared, coming up at 8 June 3PM +8GMT)I recently started a Patreon (\uff61\uff65\uff65\uff61)If you have spare cash and you don't know where to spend it on, do consider supporting me a little in exchange for reading a couple of chapters in advance \u25cf\ufe4f\u25cf)Advanced chapters link: https://100kpsi.schk.co/Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He averted his gaze right away when he realized that Ji Fanyin was staring at him, but he wasn\u2019t about to fool anyone here.Ji Fanyin asked, \u201cWhy? Are you interested in\u2026\u201dIt was then that the first firework whizzed into the air and exploded.Like everyone else, Ji Fanyin\u2019s gaze was immediately drawn to the spectacular fireworks show in the sky, causing her to forget about what she was thinking a moment ago. She was also oblivious to how Bai Zhou\u2019s gaze kept drifting toward her ankles.After the fireworks show came to an end, the couples reluctantly left the area with comments like \u2018We have to watch the fireworks again\u2019 and \u2018Let\u2019s come here again for my birthday\u2019.Perhaps it was due to the lack of rose-tinted glasses, Ji Fanyin thought that the fireworks show was so-so with nothing particularly impressive. If anything really stood out, it was just the castle in the background.The castle does look great, but too bad I can\u2019t afford it.\u201cAre we heading to the float parade next?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin.Bai Zhou nodded, but he frowned in hesitation right after. Then, he quickly shook his head and said, \u201cLet\u2019s just wait for the float parade to pass by here.\u201dJi Fanyin replied with a smile, \u201cAlright.\u201dFloats tended to travel extremely slowly, and most of them were based on recent movies that most guests didn\u2019t recognize. Most people were there to immerse themselves in the festive atmosphere.The two of them were standing right next to the main road, granting them a good view of the parade.Ji Fanyin usually wasn\u2019t too interested in this kind of stuff, but perhaps due to the influence of the atmosphere, she somehow thought that it was pretty interesting.The staff members around each float were dedicated to their performance, and all of them had brilliant smiles on their faces. There was even one float that went around scattering flower petals over the audience.Now that I think about it, I\u2019m actually in the same trade as Disneyland. We\u2019re all in the business of selling dreams, Ji Fanyin thought.She shot a glance at Bai Zhou and noticed that a flower petal had landed on top of his head. She tiptoed over and brushed the flower petal off for him, but just as she was about to retract her hand, he suddenly grabbed it.He stared at her for a few seconds before deeply shouting to her, \u201cBig sis!\u201dJi Fanyin replied with a tilt of her head, but there was no follow-up afterward.It was soon the closing time for the amusement park. As they followed the crowd out, Ji Fanyin noticed that Bai Zhou appeared a little lethargic, giving off an unhappy brooding vibe.She lightly tugged the knot on Bai Zhou\u2019s wrist and asked, \u201cIs there anywhere else we\u2019re heading to before going home?\u201dBai Zhou glanced at her shoes and replied, \u201c\u2026 Nowhere. We\u2019re going straight home.\u201dHe began striding toward the car park, and Ji Fanyin followed him in confusion.It was good news for her to be able to get off work early, but it felt unnerving when it was happening a little too often.\u201cIs the person you like Song Shiyu?\u201d Bai Zhou suddenly stopped and asked. \u201cWhat do you hope to gain by putting on this act with me? Are you hoping to steal your younger sister\u2019s love?\u201dJi Fanyin simply tilted her head in response. She felt no obligation to respond to a non-work-related question during working hours.\u201cSpeak!\u201dJi Fanyin sighed softly and asked, \u201cIs that all for today?\u201dBai Zhou replied with a darkened face, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Can you answer the question now?\u201dSo, Ji Fanyin graciously offered him the answer to his question, \u201cYoungsters like you should stop being so obsessed with love. It isn\u2019t everything in life.

Her heels were a little red, but they were fortunately not bleeding.While leisurely making her way out of the amusement park along with the crowd, she reached for her phone in her bag and switched it on.She was intending to hail a cab, but she noticed that she had quite a few missed calls from Song Shiyu.Three of them were made at around 8 P.M., and the most recent one was just ten minutes ago.It was unusual for Song Shiyu to drop her so many calls, so she decided to return the call to check on him. After all, it was important to maintain good ties with loyal customers.Song Shiyu didn\u2019t pick up the call right away, so Ji Fanyin patiently waited and waited. It was when she thought that the call was going to be automatically hung up that Song Shiyu\u2019s hoarse voice finally sounded through the speaker, \u201cHello?\u201d\u201cYou called?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin.There was a long pause before he finally said, \u201c\u2026 I\u2019m ill.\u201d\u201cDo you need me to call an ambulance for you? Or should I relay your condition to Ji Xinxin?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin.His fever must be really getting to him for him to actually call me.Song Shiyu mumbled something, but Ji Fanyin wasn\u2019t able to hear him clearly. However, the rustling of bedsheets coming from the other side clued her in that he had been lying on a bed and was just getting up.Only the last few words from him were comprehensible. \u201cCome over.\u201dQuestion marks popped up in Ji Fanyin\u2019s head. \u201cSong Shiyu, do you know who you are calling?\u201d\u201cYou are Ji Fanyin.\u201d Even though Song Shiyu sounded a little out of it, it seemed like he wasn\u2019t delirious yet. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to come over right now to take care of me.\u201dThere was suddenly a loud clang on the other side. It sounded like something heavy had fallen to the ground.It was also with this that the call ended.Ji Fanyin: \u201c\u2026?\u201dStaring at her phone screen, she hesitated for a single second before tossing Song Shiyu to the back of her head. However, shortly after she got into a cab, she suddenly received a money transfer from Song Shiyu.She looked at the sum she received and thought that she could at least spare a bit of her free time to him in view of his sincerity.So, she changed her destination and began heading for Song Shiyu\u2019s home.\u2026Song Shiyu thought that he could easily tank a small cold, but his condition only ended up worsening with time. The day after he returned from the movie premiere, he was down with a high fever.His assistant was particularly vulnerable to catching colds, usually being the first one to get infected and the last one to recover. Understandably, upon hearing that Song Shiyu was sick, he immediately began begging and crying and threatening him with his life. It took a great deal of effort before he finally convinced Song Shiyu not to come to work.His assistant did get some medicine for Song Shiyu, but the latter refused to eat it. He fell asleep at noon and woke up with a growling stomach.He should have called his assistant to get him to deliver food over, but he found himself dialing Ji Xinxin\u2019s number instead.Ji Xinxin declined his call but sent him a message: \u3010Sorry, Shiyu! I\u2019m in the middle of a class right now >With a groggy mind, he slowly typed out a response to Ji Xinxin\u2019s message: \u3010It\u2019s nothing much. I\u2019m ill. I just wanted to hear your voice.\u3011Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her tone sounded worried and anxious.Song Shiyu\u2019s vision was a little blurry under the effects of his illness, so the speed of his typing was affected as well.He couldn\u2019t help but smile at the messages that were pouring out from her. It was only after she dropped a series of questions and emojis that he finally managed to type out his response: \u3010It\u2019s just a common cold. It would really be great if you could come over to see me.\u3011Ji Xinxin sent a sighing emoji, followed by a hugging emoji.Then, she asked: \u3010Are you not eating your medicine again? You can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t rush over to keep an eye on you right now, but you need to take care of yourself.\u3011Song Shiyu circumvented the medicine question and asked: \u3010When is your break? Will you be coming back?\u3011Ji Xinxin\u2019s response was a little slower this time around: \u3010I was intending to come back during the winter holidays, but I might drop by earlier before Christmas. I have some matters to attend to.\u3011Song Shiyu quickly did a quick mental calculation. There were just a few more months before Christmas.\u3010We\u2019ll be able to meet each other very soon.\u3011 He typed the message out word by word. \u3010I miss you.\u3011\u3010I also hope to see you as soon as possible!\u3011 Ji Xinxin sent a head patting emoji. \u3010I need to rush for my next class now. I\u2019ll check on you later on, so make sure to eat your medicine!\u3011Sogn Shiyu exhaled deeply before turning over on the bed.Ji Xinxin wasn\u2019t his girlfriend, but even if she was, he couldn\u2019t possibly ask her to fly across half the globe to visit him over a mere cold.But there\u2019s someone else who is at my beck and call.He fiddled with his phone, which was starting to heat up under his body temperature, but his rationality eventually stopped him from sending a message to Ji Fanyin. Instead, he called his assistant to prepare some food for him.His assistant couldn\u2019t cook and had his hands full from having to take over Song Shiyu\u2019s work at the last moment. He only had time to help Song Shiyu order a porridge delivery.Song Shiyu ate a few mouthfuls and popped a couple of pills into his mouth before returning to bed. At some point, he drifted off to sleep yet again.It wasn\u2019t a good sleep. In his dream, there was a beautiful glowing light drawing him in, but some sort of force was holding onto him from behind, stopping him from approaching the light. He tried everything he could, scrambling with all four of his limbs to fight against that mysterious force.He ended up waking up not feeling like he had gotten an ounce of rest at all. His body was aching all over, as if he had just been fished out of water.Song Shiyu was still clear-headed at that moment. He tried feeling his own forehead with the back of his hand, and it felt searing. He was still burning up.He exerted all his might to flip over and look at the clock on the bedside table, only to find that it was already eight at night. The entire day had somehow passed him by amidst grogginess.He grabbed his phone to take a look, but there were no messages from Ji Xinxin at all. She seemed to have forgotten her earlier promise to keep an eye on him to ensure that he took his medicine.He continued lying in his bed for a while, but his fever showed no signs of subsiding. Even moving a finger felt tiring to him. A while later, he still ended up dialing the number that was almost like a taboo in his contact list.The other party\u2019s phone was switched off. Thrice he tried, but there was no difference in the result.Song Shiyu sneered.He figured that Ji Fanyin might have managed to hook onto Cen Xiangyang after yesterday\u2019s meeting. Otherwise, she might be with Bai Zhou too.She was usually quite contactable outside of working hours.\u2026 Feigning as if she doesn\u2019t care for me at all!Song Shiyu angrily threw his phone at the wall, which then fell onto the ground with a large \u2018bam\u2019. Just doing this sapped him of almost half of his remaining energy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His stomach had started growling in protest of its mistreatment.He turned and flipped on his bed for a long time, as if he was throwing a tantrum at himself. It took an entire hour before he finally rose from the bed to retrieve his phone.The screen was cracked and had a few problems, but the call function was still working properly. He tapped into his contacts, and once again, the name \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 appeared on his phone screen.However, her phone was still turned off even though it was nearing ten.Song Shiyu took a look at the time as he began to maliciously wonder how far Ji Fanyin would go for money despite her claims that she \u2018sold her skills and not her body\u2019.Doesn\u2019t she offer nighttime accompaniment service too?Song Shiyu stared at his phone in a daze as his mind turned a little sluggish. He felt like his mind wasn\u2019t processing anything at all, but at the same time, it felt like it was overloaded with lots of thoughts too.His phone suddenly vibrated, and Ji Fanyin\u2019s name appeared on the screen.Song Shiyu stared at the screen in a daze, his finger hovering above the \u2018Accept\u2019 button but somehow not pressing it.He wasn\u2019t certain whether he really wanted to hear Ji Fanyin\u2019s voice right now.Maybe\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have made those four calls.But he still picked it up in the end.\u201cYou called?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin.She didn\u2019t use Ji Xinxin\u2019s voice, but Song Shiyu was relieved by that.At least Ji Fanyin is always waiting for me at the same spot.So, he replied, \u201cCome over.\u201dTo be safe, he even sent money into Ji Fanyin\u2019s bank account.So be it. If Ji Fanyin has chosen to use money to conceal her feelings and protect her dignity, I\u2019ll go along with her, Song Shiyu thought as he fiddled with his phone.Her accompaniment deserved his reward.Ji Fanyin should have known the address of his apartment, but he was still ready to send a message on WeChat to remind her. But it suddenly struck him when he tapped into his WeChat app\u2014he had deleted her from his friend list a while ago.But just yesterday, while Ji Fanyin was exchanging contact numbers with Cen Xiangyang, Song Shiyu took a look at her phone and took down her WeChat ID.He rubbed his blurry eyes and added Ji Fanyin back into his friend list before proceeding to send her his address and the passcode for his door.He didn\u2019t understand why either, but he felt a surge of relaxation after doing all of these. He placed his phone back on his bedside table and heaved a long sigh of relief.He curled himself into a ball on the bed and felt a much greater sense of security than before.Some time later, he heard footsteps, followed by a flick of a switch. A delicate figure was slowly making her way to him.\u201c\u2026 Ji Fanyin?\u201d mumbled Song Shiyu.The other party bent down to feel his forehead before sighing with a soft and gentle voice.Despite his high fever, Song Shiyu once again affirmed his speculation.No matter how Ji Fanyin tried to conceal it with her actions or words, she was still unable to hide her feelings for him.For the first time in his life, the knowledge of the fact that \u2018Ji Fanyin likes me\u2019 spurred a hint of glee in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ji Fanyin was able to enter his house without any problem using the passcode he had sent her. It was just that being in a seemingly empty house devoid of light in the middle of the night was a little chilling.So, the first thing she did upon entering the house was to start feeling the walls for the light switches.Once the lights were on, she started looking around the room. The first thing she spotted was two geckos sitting not too far away from the doorway.Ji Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201dI nearly forgot that Song Shiyu raised lizards. I guess even a cold-blooded man like him feels kinship toward his cold-blooded brethren.She decided to make her first stop at the crystal oven, prioritizing the feeding of the two ugly yet weirdly adorable geckos over Song Shiyu.She remembered that these two geckos were of noble bloodline, costing quite a fortune to buy.Don\u2019t die of hunger. Song Shiyu won\u2019t die for missing a meal or two, but the same can\u2019t be said about these geckos.After she was done feeding the geckos, Ji Fanyin switched on the lights to the living room and familiarized herself with the surroundings.To be frank, this was not the first time she had visited Song Shiyu\u2019s apartment, or to be more exact, \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 had been here before.\u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 had been with Song Shiyu for quite a while before her transmigration to this world. The two of them would frequently meet here, but there was hardly any conversation or physical contact between them.\u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 was a painting to Song Shiyu, no more no less.She would rush to whatever destination he designated at a phone call from him, only to later leave at a wave of his hands. Her attitude could be almost said to be subservient.This was the present Ji Fanyin\u2019s first time visiting this place, so she took her time strolling around the living room to examine the surroundings.There were a few boxes of medicine and a bowl of porridge lying on the living room table. The porridge had barely been touched, but he had taken quite a bit of medicine.It was just that Song Shiyu lacked the common sense to not eat different variations of the same medicine at once. All four boxes of medicine had signs of being eaten.JI Fanyin took a look at the receipt for the medicine, and her eyebrows shot up. After that, she began making her way toward Song Shiyu\u2019s bedroom.She stopped right in front of the room and listened quietly for any activity inside before finally pushing the door open and heading in. It was pitch-black inside. Even the light from the corridor was insufficient to light up the area around the bed.Nevertheless, the person lying on the bed still curled up even tighter, as if protesting at the disturbance.Ji Fanyin unsympathetically switched on the lights in the bedroom before walking over to gaze down at him.The outwardly gentlemanly but inwardly cold-blooded young master Song was completely drenched in sweat. His cheeks were flushed and his eyes looked delirious, making him appear extremely pitiful.\u201cJi Fanyin?\u201d he murmured.It was surprising that he got it right this time around.Ji Fanyin bent down and touched his forehead. It was burning hot.The fever must have burned away quite a few of his brain cells. I guess two negatives do make a positive after all; that\u2019s why he was able to identify me correctly.In view that there might be nothing in Song Shiyu\u2019s house, Ji Fanyin had dropped by the pharmacy to get some stuff before heading over. It was time to put them to good use.Ji Fanyin wouldn\u2019t spend additional bucks for the more expensive ear thermometer for Song Shiyu, so what she had in her bag of items was just a basic five-dollar mouth thermometer.Song Shiyu should be thankful that she was at least conscientious enough to wipe it with an alcohol swab before coaxing him to put it inside his mouth. She waited for a while before pulling it out from the clutches of his teeth. \u201cOpen your mouth. Stop biting on it.\u201dSong Shiyu obeyed her orders so well that it felt a little unnerving.Ji Fanyin had to check on the thermometer twice in order to verify that she wasn\u2019t seeing things: 39.5\u2103.High fever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Impressed by her own handiwork, she felt an urge to snap a photo for commemoration.It should qualify as a dark history for Song Shiyu.\u201cJi Fanyin,\u201d Song Shiyu called out once more.\u201cMy big sis isn\u2019t here. Shiyu, it looks like your fever is getting to you. I\u2019m really going to get angry if you mistake me for big sis once more,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin gently as she began reading the dosage instruction of the fever medicine.\u201cJi Fanyin, you won\u2019t be as caring toward others as you are to me, right?\u201d Song Shiyu continued speaking insistently, acting as if he hadn\u2019t heard her.Ji Fanyin shot a glance at him, baffled as to what in the world he was talking about. But soon, it clicked.Ah, this must be the famous mentality of \u2018Even if it\u2019s something I don\u2019t want, I won\u2019t let anyone else take it away\u2019.So, Ji Fanyin used Ji Xinxin\u2019s tone to question him, \u201cWhen did you get so close with my big sis? I remember that the two of you weren\u2019t even on talking terms.\u201dThe Song Shiyu with a fever patch on his forehead fell silent.He seemed to have trouble processing his thoughts, and it took a moment before he finally replied slowly, \u201cI don\u2019t want Ji Xinxin today. I want Ji Fanyin.\u201dJi Fanyin\u2019s movements jerked to a halt.That would render things meaningless.\u201cMy big sis doesn\u2019t want to be with you,\u201d she replied with a casual tone as she took out two pills from the packaging. \u201cThe only one you can be with now is Ji Xinxin.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Song Shiyu was determined to get to the bottom of this.Ji Fanyin opened a bottle of mineral water and passed it to him, saying, \u201cTake your medicine first.\u201dSong Shiyu swallowed the two pills down before staring intently at Ji Fanyin, awaiting her reply.Ji Fanyin placed the cap back onto the mineral water before directing a smile toward him, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a secret. You mustn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201dSong Shiyu nodded in response.\u201cMy big sis doesn\u2019t like Song Shiyu anymore,\u201d whispered Ji Fanyin.Right after she said those words, Song Shiyu burst out with a rebuttal, \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d\u201cHow could it be a lie when it\u2019s coming right out of my mouth?\u201d Ji Fanyin rested her arm on the bedside table as she looked at Song Shiyu with a gentle smile.Song Shiyu glared at her sharply, struggling to find words to refute her.Ji Fanyin thought that this development was pretty interesting regardless of whether Song Shiyu remembered this conversation or not after his fever subsided.She took a look at her time and saw that her fourfold salary service hours were nearly over. Based on the amount of money Song Shiyu had sent over earlier\u2026 there were forty more minutes to go.\u201cLet\u2019s have you change into a fresh set of clothes,\u201d Ji Fanyin coaxed Song Shiyu patiently. \u201cIt won\u2019t be comfortable for you to sleep in such a state.\u201dSong Shiyu obediently moved at each of her instructions. His reaction was a little delayed, but he still managed to take off his pajamas.Ji Fanyin looked through his wardrobe for another set of pajamas, only to spot a bracelet lying by the corner.This bracelet looked a little shabby compared to Song Shiyu\u2019s elegant wardrobe. Its many marks showed the mistreatment it had been through, possibly having scraped against a rough surface. It was to the point where the bracelet looked out of shape.Ji Fanyin had to examine it closely before she could identify it as the \u2018birthday present\u2019 she had given to Song Shiyu the other day.It looks like Song Shiyu doesn\u2019t treasure much. Look at how roughly he has treated it.Ji Fanyin pondered for a moment before slipping the bracelet into her pocket.Song Shiyu doesn\u2019t want it anyway, and this bracelet came right out of my pocket. I\u2019ll think of it as recycling my goods. There might just be someone in the secondhand market who\u2019s willing to take it home.------Yoo hang out with us in our Discord~ Got a neat community there!Mission 2 (\u0e07\ufe21'-'\ufe20)\u0e072/15 unique commenters on a chapterReward: 1 bonus chapterI recently started a Patreon (\uff61\uff65\uff65\uff61)Do consider supporting me a little in exchange for reading a couple of chapters in advance \u25cf\ufe4f\u25cf)Advanced chapters link: https://100kpsi.schk.co/Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was just about to head to the kitchen to prepare some food when he suddenly asked, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cYou barely touched the porridge on the table outside. Aren\u2019t you hungry?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin.\u201c\u2026 Are you going to cook for me?\u201dJi Fanyin had to ponder for a moment before giving her response.Ji Xinxin did cook at times though she isn\u2019t good at it, so it should be fine to accept his request.Paying him a visit \u2192 Showing concern \u2192 Making food. This should be the standard \u2018taking care of an ill acquaintance\u2019 procedure, right?\u201cOf course. You don\u2019t trust my cooking skills?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin.\u201c\u2026 No.\u201d Song Shiyu was quiet for a moment before he asked awkwardly, \u201cWill you come back after you\u2019re done cooking?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d Ji Fanyin lied.With those words, Song Shiyu returned to bed at ease.Ji Fanyin had to ransack the barren kitchen in order to gather sufficient ingredients for a pot of egg congee with spring onions. By the time the aroma of porridge started wafting from the electric pot, Song Shiyu\u2019s service hours were nearly up.By then, he had already fallen into deep sleep under the influence of medicine.So, Ji Fanyin switched the electric pot to \u2018Heating\u2019 mode lest her porridge turned cold. She took one last look at the clock and saw that there was another minute to go. She used this time to enter his bedroom and meticulously took out the next dosage of medicine for him so that he wouldn\u2019t get it wrong again.With that, her job was done. She walked out of Song Shiyu\u2019s house coolly.Will you come back after you\u2019re done cooking?Of course\u2026 not.Words that are spoken in the midst of a dream\u2014ah no, it should be service hours\u2014can\u2019t be trusted at all.\u2026Song Shiyu woke up at six the following morning. The sky was already starting to brighten up. There was no one else in his room, but the lit lamp and the pills sitting on his bedside table were evidence that someone had dropped by to visit him.Possibly because he had finally eaten the medicine correctly this time around, he felt much more clear-headed than he was yesterday.He pressed his hand against his forehead, which was still throbbing in pain, as he called out, \u201cJi Fanyin?\u201dThere was no response.He slowly sat up. There was a post-it note on the bedside table, and he quickly tore it off and read it: Remember to take your medicine after breakfast! Also, make sure that you take your temperature to check if your fever has gone down. If not, you\u2019ll have to head to the hospital.The message was written in Ji Xinxin\u2019s handwriting, and it was signed off with Ji Xinxin\u2019s name too.Song Shiyu read the message a few times before he finally rose to his feet and headed out with a frown. Barely after he took a few steps, he suddenly turned around to grab the thermometer on the bedside table and place it into his mouth before leaving his bedroom.The moment he opened his door, he was welcomed by the aroma of food.Despite thinking that he didn\u2019t have much of an appetite, Song Shiyu\u2019s stomach started growling loudly. So, he made his way into the kitchen with pursed lips.There was no one in the kitchen too, but steam was rising from an electric pot.He lifted the lid and saw warm congee inside. His frown slowly loosened up.He served himself a bowl of congee before heading back to his bedroom to grab his phone. There were two seconds of hesitation for a moment there, but he decided to send a message to Ji Fanyin nevertheless: \u3010You accompanied me for the entire night? Thanks. My fever has subsided. \u3011Ji Fanyin\u2019s reply came a few hours later: \u3010I\u2019d ask you for overtime wages if I stayed with you that long.\u3011Song Shiyu, who was already in the company by that point, couldn\u2019t help but chuckle to himself. He was starting to think that Ji Fanyin\u2019s claim that she no longer liked him was nothing more than a lie.Despite saying such words, she still can\u2019t help but worry about me.Ji Fanyin: \u3010Would you like to make a reservation? If not, I\u2019ll be meeting other clients.\u3011Song Shiyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe\u2019s just acting\u2026 right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It wasn\u2019t her usual clients from her stand-in job but from the connections she had recently made from the film industry.This new world she had transmigrated into had a different cinematic culture from the world she had come from, but she was still able to bridge the gap through her deep knowledge of films.When her previous review went viral, she received a call from Zhang Ning, who remarked in astonishment that she didn\u2019t think that their collaboration would actually produce such amazing synergy, and that this was beyond her expectations.That very day, Zhang Ning asked her out for a meeting and tried to persuade her to sign a long-term contract with them, but Ji Fanyin rejected the offer after some thought.She thought that it would be hard for her to balance two jobs, and she valued the greater freedom from being a freelancer too. She would be able to watch any movie and write any review she wanted.As long as she chose her content wisely, she would be able to obtain a decent amount of Emotion Points through this regardless of whether she went professional or not.Signing a contract with Zhang Ning would grant her access to greater resources, such as invitations to movie premieres, but she thought that those were just nice-to-haves. Ultimately, it all boiled down to the quality of the review.She knew of reviewers who specifically chose to tackle lousy films but were still able to get their audience clutching their stomachs in laughter through their glib tongue. It was the typical example of \u2018the review being more interesting than the movie\u2019, and such reviews had the potential to go viral too.Alternatively, there were also reviewers who accepted bribes to fling mud on certain films so as to sully their reputation. She could earn negative Emotion Points through that too.If she were to sign a contract with Zhang Ning, her freedom would be greatly affected, especially when it came to films related to He Shen\u2019s studio.It was with these considerations in mind that she rejected Zhang Ning\u2019s invitation, though she expressed interest in having more of such collaborations in the future.\u201cI\u2019m fond of He Shen\u2019s movie,\u201d said Ji Fanyin, \u201cand I\u2019m not just saying this out of politeness. I earnestly hope that his studio will be able to maintain this high standard in selecting new scripts.\u201dZhang Ning laughed in response, saying, \u201cNo problem, I\u2019ll relay your words to them. Speaking of which, a junior in the industry has been asking me for your contact number. Should I give it to him?\u201dJi Fanyin had a good idea who this \u2018junior\u2019 was, but she still asked anyway just to be sure.As expected, Zhang Ning replied, \u201cCen Xiangyang.\u201dIt went without saying that Ji Fanyin accepted the offer.Cen Xiangyang appeared to be the kind who was fond of playing mind games. It was only several hours after she dropped him a message that he finally sent her a friend request, saying that he had been busy earlier.Ji Fanyin laughed upon seeing his message. She decided to leave him hanging for a few hours and focus on her work.Cen Xiangyang\u2019s situation was different from Bai Zhou\u2019s.Bai Zhou had bumped into Ji Fanyin and Song Shiyu in the middle of their \u2018date\u2019, so Song Shiyu was compelled to help her convert Bai Zhou into one of her clients so as to drag him down. However, it would be hard to employ the same script on Cen Xiangyang.Song Shiyu was not a fool. He wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake twice.Interestingly, in the future Ji Fanyin had gotten a glimpse of when she first transmigrated over, she remembered that Song Shiyu was the one who introduced Cen Xiangyang to her.After Ji Xinxin flew off to Paris, Song Shiyu\u2019s obsession and demands began to grow out of hand. He viewed \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 as an ornament that he could go around boasting about. Due to the attitude he had taken, it didn\u2019t take long before \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 became known in their little fishery.Naturally, the twisted Cen Xiangyang joined the circle too.That being said, there was already a divergence from the present and the \u2018future\u2019 Ji Fanyin had seen even though she was still in the stand-in business, and the most notable one was likely the barrier to entry.In the \u2018future\u2019, Song Shiyu had no requirements as to who he allowed to join his little circle. He was just about willing to lend \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 out to anyone as long as he was in a good mood.Due to \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019s\u2019 feelings for Song Shiyu and her weak temperament, she always ended up obeying his orders no matter how reluctant she was.But things were different now.One, Song Shiyu didn\u2019t have the power to control her. Two, Ji Fanyin was the one deciding on the barrier to entry now.For one, her charge of 100,000 dollars per hour was already more than enough to filter out those who weren\u2019t ultra-wealthy. The average man wouldn\u2019t be able to afford her service.It would appear that Cen Xiangyang and Song Shiyu are already acquainted with one another based on their interactions at the movie premiere. As long as I slowly reel him in and let out some \u2018unintentional\u2019 clues about Fish No. 1, the latter would probably take the initiative to pull him in, right?Ji Fanyin thought that it was feasible to give it a try.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I thought that you were busy so I put my phone aside and went to work. Zhang Ning told me that you were looking for me?\u3011She didn\u2019t mind having a game of patience with Cen Xiangyang if the latter wanted to continue playing hard to get. She would just respond to him with insignificant things once every few hours just to let him know that she was still breathing, a \u2018time zone difference conversation\u2019.However, it looked like Cen Xiangyang had decided to abandon his previous strategy. He replied within two minutes: \u3010Is it the dream weaver job you spoke about? When will I get a chance to experience it for myself?\u3011Ji Fanyin took a sip of water while typing with just one hand: \u3010If an opportunity arises\u3011It would depend on when Song Shiyu was willing to let Cen Xiangyang join the fishery.She noticed that Cen Xiangyang had neglected to answer the other question she had asked, but she magnanimously decided not to pursue it.After exchanging a few messages, Ji Fanyin used dinner preparation as an excuse to end the conversation.She intended to send a post in her Moments page later on so as to give Cen Xiangyang an excuse to strike up a conversation with her, but barely as she got up from her seat, Cen Xiangyang suddenly sent her a picture, asking: \u3010Guess who I just met here\u3011Ji Fanyin tapped into the photo to take a look. It was a selfie of Cen Xiangyang dressed in casual formal, and the background suggested that he was in some sort of gathering or banquet.There were only so many common acquaintances between them, so the answer was pretty clear.\u3010Song Shiyu?\u3011 Ji Fanyin asked.\u3010Bingo! I thought that you would guess him too. However, there\u2019s another person here whom you might also recognize\u2026\u3011Cen Xiangyang sent another picture over.Ji Fanyin tapped into the picture, magnified it, and looked around for a bit before she finally spotted Bai Zhou standing amidst a group of people.Standing beside a middle-aged man, he was dressed in a shirt and long pants, which was unusual for him. He had an irritated frown that pushed others away from him.Oh? Bai Zhou is attending a networking banquet despite hating this kind of social occasion with a passion? It must be tough on him.Ji Fanyin chuckled sardonically.It was interesting that Song Shiyu, Bai Zhou, and Cen Xiangyang were actually gathered at one location. Today might just be the day that she would get introduced to Fish No. 3.Before she could type out a reply, Cen Xiangyang had already followed up with a couple more messages.\u3010Aiya, they started fighting\u3011He said with a leisurely tone.\u3010Looks like there\u2019ll be something interesting to see\u3011\u2026Bai Zhou had made an agreement to game with Ji Xinxin tonight.It was curious why Ji Xinxin would suddenly show such a great passion for games despite never being interested in them, but she had been inviting Bai Zhou to game with her over the last few days.Bai Zhou was happy to accompany her, but Ji Xinxin\u2019s skills in the game were improving at a snail\u2019s pace. Rather than playing the game, it felt like they were frolicking around.Of course, for Bai Zhou, the important thing here wasn\u2019t to play the game. What was more important was that he was spending time with Ji Xinxin.As long as Ji Xinxin gave the call, he would come online within half an hour.He had already made an agreement with Ji Xinxin to play together tonight, but his father\u2019s secretary suddenly came over and told him to attend a small-scale banquet.Bai Zhou protested, but it was futile. He was forced to change into another set of clothes before being brought into the car.\u201cI\u2019ll return your phone to you once the banquet is over. Before then, please allow me to take care of it on your behalf,\u201d the secretary said as he confiscated Bai Zhou\u2019s phone.Bai Zhou impatiently leaned back onto the car\u2019s leather seat and crossed his legs arrogantly, saying, \u201cJust what kind of banquet needs me around? Is that old man there too?\u201d\u201cMr Bai would like you to meet two people.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201dSomeone who managed to climb his way to become the chief secretary of Bai Zhou\u2019s father naturally wouldn\u2019t give information away easily. \u201cYou\u2019ll know once you meet them.\u201dBai Zhou rolled his eyes. He made up his mind to leave right away after meeting the two people his father wanted him to meet.Who cares about what he\u2019s up to? I\u2019ll just do what I want.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were only three meters between them when the two of them met eyes.\u201cYoung master Song,\u201d the chief secretary greeted Song Shiyu politely. \u201cHow is Mr Song and Mrs Song?\u201dSong Shiyu clasped his watch on his wrist as he replied, \u201cThey are doing fine. Please relay my regards to Uncle Bai too.\u201d\u201cMr Bai often mentions you, saying that you\u2019re an outstanding young man,\u201d the chief secretary said with a smile. \u201cHe hopes that his son can learn from your example.\u201dBai Zhou was in the midst of taking off his smartwatch for the security check when he heard the conversation between the two and snorted in disdain, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to learn from him?\u201dThe chief secretary passed through the metal detector without any fluctuation in his emotions at all, as if he hadn\u2019t heard Bai Zhou\u2019s words. He directed a nod toward Song Shiyu and said, \u201cI still have some matters to attend to, so I\u2019ll be taking my leave first. Pardon me.\u201dBefore leaving, he didn\u2019t forget to wave the phone he had just confiscated toward Bai Zhou.Bai Zhou: \u201c\u2026 Scram!\u201dAfter Bai Zhou passed through the metal detector, he shot a glance at Song Shiyu and let out a provocative sneer.\u201cYou were the one with her earlier?\u201d Song Shiyu suddenly asked.\u201cI\u2019ll still be able to play with big sis if I rush back, so don\u2019t even think about it,\u201d replied Bai Zhou without any hesitation.Song Shiyu paused for a moment before clarifying, \u201cI\u2019m referring to Ji Fanyin.\u201dBai Zhou turned to look at Song Shiyu in bewilderment, doubting what he had just heard. \u201cYou\u2019re asking about Ji Fanyin?\u201dHe exchanged gazes with Song Shiyu before clicking his tongue in annoyance, saying, \u201cNot today.\u201d\u201cSo you were with her yesterday?\u201d asked Song Shiyu.Bai Zhou took his time to ponder about the significance of the question before remarking, \u201cSo you really did call her yesterday. Your call couldn\u2019t get through, right?\u201dBai Zhou\u2019s response provided Song Shiyu the answer he was looking for, as well as an additional piece of information: Bai Zhou was the one who switched off Ji Fanyin\u2019s phone.This left him with deep thoughts.Ji Fanyin had told him earlier in the afternoon that she was going to meet a client. If the client she spoke of wasn\u2019t Bai Zhou, the only one left was\u2026 Cen Xiangyang.Realization also dawned upon Bai Zhou. He snorted sarcastically and taunted, \u201cAre you feeling uncomfortable because the woman who said that she likes you is meeting other men? You must feel like your toy is being taken away from you.\u201dSong Shiyu glanced at Bai Zhou before turning away.He had to pull Bai Zhou down together with him because there was no other choice back then, but when it came to Cen Xiangyang\u2026 he wanted Ji Fanyin to avoid him.Of course, that was out of concern of Cen Xiangyang\u2019s personality problems and not because he was biased toward Ji Fanyin or anything.\u201cEveryone says that Ji Fanyin likes you, but it doesn\u2019t look like it at all,\u201d remarked Bai Zhou leisurely. \u201cWhy would she meet other men if she really liked you? It was me yesterday and someone else today. Who will she meet tomorrow?\u201dIt was no secret that they were love rivals, and their family backgrounds were on par with one another. On top of that, Bai Zhou\u2019s father would often lecture Bai Zhou by comparing him to Song Shiyu, which bred hostility between the two of them.This was a rare opportunity for Bai Zhou to get back at Song Shiyu. Even though he noticed the irony of him saying those words himself at some point, he wasn\u2019t willing to give up on this chance to put Song Shiyu down.Song Shiyu stared at Bai Zhou quietly for two seconds before suddenly revealing a triumphant smile.\u201cI was ill yesterday night. She spent the entire night taking care of me at my home,\u201d said Song Shiyu. He paused for a moment before adding for emphasis, \u201cNo charge at all.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He sneered, \u201cHow would you not know the whereabouts of someone who took care of you for an entire night?\u201dThe two of them met eyes once more. One had a fake smile and the other a look of contempt. With this, the two of them parted ways.Bai Zhou grabbed a cup of champagne before finding a place to camp till his father\u2019s chief secretary returned. It was just that someone of his identity was bound to be in the center of attention. Eyes were on him from the moment he made an entrance.While Bai Zhou was irritatedly dealing with them one by one, Song Shiyu was not faring any better.It was at this moment that Cen Xiangyang made his entrance.Bai Zhou didn\u2019t notice him at the start. It was only when a woman beside him asked \u201cIs that young man snapping our photos\u201d that he casually turned his head to take a look.The arrogant young master Bai of course didn\u2019t recognize Cen Xiangyang.Cen Xiangyang\u2019s fringe drooped a little as he tilted his head down to type on his phone. His neat features and cleanly shaven lower jaws gave him a mild appearance. He looked like the typical good student, the type which Bai Zhou was completely uninterested in.Bai Zhou was about to turn his gaze away when the latter suddenly finished typing and raised his head.Upon noticing Bai Zhou\u2019s gaze, Cen Xiangyang smiled at him.Bai Zhou couldn\u2019t really describe what was wrong with that smile, but he suddenly felt a strong feeling of discomfort, nearly shuddering even. However, his pride forced him to keep his poise, and he responded with a provocative smile.Cen Xiangyang innocently tilted his head before turning his eyes in Song Shiyu\u2019s direction.Bai Zhou subconsciously directed his gaze over too, only to find that Song Shiyu was staring at Cen Xiangyang.This queer interaction brought an epiphany to Bai Zhou: He must be the man whom Ji Fanyin was with earlier.Bai Zhou assessed Cen Xiangyang from head to toe and came to an evaluation: A weakling, just like Song Shiyu. Ji Fanyin\u2019s has horrible taste in man.\u201cYoung master Bai.\u201d The elusive chief secretary finally made his appearance. \u201cPlease come with me.\u201dBai Zhou tore his attention away from Cen Xiangyang and asked impatiently, \u201cCan I leave after meeting those two?\u201dTo him, Cen Xiangyang and Song Shiyu were of secondary concern here. His priority was to quickly finish up whatever he had to do here so that he could rush home to game with Ji Xinxin.\u201cYes, you\u2019re free to leave afterward,\u201d replied the chief secretary with a smile. He gestured for Bai Zhou to follow him to a more private location.Bai Zhou followed the chief secretary\u2019s lead with his hands in his pocket. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder: Just who am I meeting that requires such secrecy\u2026It was then that the chief secretary came to a halt and pushed a door open.In the room were a woman and a teenage boy, who appeared to be a high schooler. They were sitting side-by-side on a sofa.Bai Zhou recognized the woman right away.She was his father\u2019s mistress\u2026 one of them.This clue made it easy for him to figure out the identity of the teenage boy too.Bai Zhou\u2019s footsteps screeched to a halt. He turned to the chief secretary and bellowed, \u201cMy father told you to bring me here in order to meet them? What does he mean by this?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a meeting,\u201d replied the chief secretary as he calmly propped his glasses up. \u201cThere are too many people out here. Let\u2019s talk inside.\u201dBai Zhou threw him a nasty \u2018I\u2019ve nothing to say to them\u2019 expression and stomped off.The chief secretary raised his hand to block Bai Zhou\u2019s path and said, \u201cYoung master Bai, you have nothing to worry about. You\u2019re the only successor to the Bai Family.\u201dThe infuriated Bai Zhou threw a punch into the chief secretary\u2019s face without any warning, sending the latter\u2019s glasses flying across the room.It stirred a huge commotion, drawing many eyes over.Bai Zhou shot a deathly glare at the mother and son inside the room before striding off, not paying any heed to the chief secretary.\u201cYoung master Bai,\u201d the chief secretary quickly called out to him. \u201cThis is your father\u2019s will.\u201dBai Zhou turned his head around and sneered coldly, \u201cI\u2019ll call my mother to see what she thinks about this.\u201d\u201cYour mother has already given her consent,\u201d the chief secretary said with a hushed voice.Bai Zhou\u2019s face immediately froze up.\u201cIt\u2019s a mutually beneficial exchange. You should try to understand it too.\u201dBai Zhou slowly turned his eyes back into the room. The two people inside had stood up at some point and were currently walking to the doorway.Bai Zhou didn\u2019t even want to look at the woman\u2019s face, but he could see the teenage boy standing in front of his mother protectively, warily staring at him like a young beast.The chief secretary raised his hand to stop the mother and son from walking any further, \u201cYou have to stay inside.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Exchange, you said? That means that my mother also\u2026\u201d murmured Bai Zhou.The chief secretary didn\u2019t refute Bai Zhou\u2019s guess. \u201cThis will not affect your inheritance. The two of them have already agreed on it.\u201dThe term, \u2018mutually beneficial exchange\u2019, left Bai Zhou feeling indescribably queasy. It felt even more disgusting than Cen Xiangyang\u2019s smile.He quietly raised his arm toward the chief secretary.The chief secretary hesitated for a moment before handing Bai Zhou\u2019s phone back to him. \u201cPlease calm down a little before you call your parents to talk to them about this matter.\u201d\u201cTalk to them about this matter?\u201d sneered Bai Zhou. \u201cI reckon that they\u2019re too busy with their \u2018mutually beneficial exchange\u2019 to even talk about this! I\u2019ll find someone else who will come at my beck and call instead.\u201dHe tapped into his contacts and scrolled down. He stopped at Ji Xinxin\u2019s name for a moment, but in the end, he still chose the name directly above it\u2014Ji Fanyin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was worried that Ji Fanyin\u2019s phone was switched off or that another man would accept the call.But a few seconds later, Ji Fanyin\u2019s seemingly unreal voice sounded through the phone, \u201cYes?\u201dBai Zhou was so overwhelmed that he didn\u2019t even realize that he had heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cCan we meet now? I\u2019ll find you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t accept last-minute reservations,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin heartlessly.Bai Zhou: \u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll pay you extra.\u201dJi Fanyin chuckled softly. \u201cEven if it costs tenfold?\u201dBy then, Bai Zhou was already approaching the entrance of the venue, on the verge of leaving the banquet. He halted his footsteps, turned around, and took a look. The door had been closed, but the chief secretary was still standing there, staring at him.Yes, the only one here was the chief secretary. His father and mother were nowhere in sight.He thought about the chief secretary\u2019s earlier words\u2014\u2018This will not affect your inheritance\u2019\u2014and it brought out a cold sneer from him. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll pay for it.\u201dNot too far away, Song Shiyu heard those words and turned his gaze over, to which Bai Zhou responded with a contemptuous look.Ji Fanyin was openly obsessed with money. Only an idiot Song Shiyu would believe that Ji Fanyin was still in love with him.In Bai Zhou\u2019s view, this was probably one of the wisest decisions Ji Fanyin had made in her life.Is there even anything good about Song Shiyu?\u2026Ji Fanyin agreed to meet Bai Zhou at his place. After hanging up the call, she received another message from Cen Xiangyang.\u3010He stomped off angrily\u3011Cen Xiangyang was doing a live telecast for her. \u3010I think he called someone while leaving the venue\u3011Ji Fanyin pondered for a moment before replying: \u3010Yeah, he called me\u3011Cen Xiangyang replied with an ellipsis followed by a question mark.\u3010Where are you all?\u3011Ji Fanyin chose not to satisfy his curiosity.Cen Xiangyang sent her a location pin before probing on: \u3010What do you mean? Are you actually close with Bai Zhou?\u3011For a long while after that, the app reflected that he was in the midst of typing something, but he didn\u2019t send his message. It was impossible to guess what he was writing and deleting over and over again.Ji Fanyin quickly checked the location pin sent over and saw that it would take around 40 minutes for Bai Zhou to get back to his penthouse. Considering that she had to dress up and put on some makeup, time was a little tight.As if determined to join in the commotion, her phone vibrated at this moment. A notification indicating that He Shen had liked her newly posted review popped up.Ji Fanyin quickly swiped off the notification before heading back to her room to check her wardrobe.Her wardrobe was divided into two segments\u2014work and personal. Both sides were stuffed to the brim.She was pretty wealthy after all, so there was no need for her to hold back when it came to minor expenses such as clothes. She never hesitated to whip out her card whenever she saw something that she fancied.Half an hour later, she received a call from Bai Zhou. He was panting a little. \u201cI\u2019ve arrived.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve just headed out,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with her phone sandwiched between her ear and her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll be arriving in around twenty minutes\u2019 time.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Alright.\u201d Bai Zhou\u2019s voice sounded a little lifeless. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you.\u201dIn truth, Ji Fanyin was already on the ground floor of Bai Zhou\u2019s apartment. She was standing by the corner amidst a couple of trees, which granted her full vision of Bai Zhou, who was leaning against his motorcycle with a phone in hand.He had thick black eyebrows which converged sharply at the tips, giving him an imposing appearance whenever he frowned\u2014which he often did.So, when he stood beneath the streetlamp with his face concealed amidst shadows, he surprisingly looked much more approachable than usual.Of course, a 1.85 meters tall man standing with his motorcycle in the middle of the night could only look so much more approachable.\u201cI\u2019ll call you when I arrive,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin before hanging up the call. There were still three minutes to go before the next hour, so she decided to wait till then.After she hung up the phone, she noticed that Bai Zhou didn\u2019t head upstairs right away. He continued waiting beside his motorcycle while fiddling with his phone.Twenty seconds later, he raised his hand to check his watch,Ji Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201dJust what kind of devastating trauma did the boy suffer to be in such urgent need of Ji Xinxin\u2019s consolation? It looks like seconds are passing as slowly as years to him.Another thirty seconds later, Bai Zhou checked his watch yet again before unhappily stomping his feet.It was such an interesting scene that Ji Fanyin decided to spectate a while longer.If it really comes down to it, I\u2019ll just add a few more minutes to his allotted time. That isn\u2019t a problem at all.A few minutes later, Bai Zhou\u2019s phone rang.He already had his phone in his hand, but he hesitated for a long while before picking it up.Ji Fanyin clearly heard him call out \u201cbig sis\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was quietly listening to the other party\u2019s words, only occasionally squeaking out a response.Ji Fanyin stroked her chin contemplatively.Did the two of them get into an argument? Even if Bai Zhou was in a bad mood, his spirits would usually be quickly raised with a call from Ji Xinxin.This doesn\u2019t make sense. I must have missed out on some clues or developments.The call ended while Ji Fanyin was still deep in thought. He stared at his phone intently before fiddling with it a little.Ji Fanyin waited in anticipation for him to call her and say \u2018You need not come anymore\u2019. To her disappointment, Bai Zhou locked his screen and slipped his phone into his pocket.Ji Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201d Fine, I was being too optimistic.She took two steps back from the corner before casually making her way toward Bai Zhou. She stopped right in front of him and asked, \u201cIn a bad mood?\u201dBai Zhou had already raised his head to look at her while she was still several steps away, but he appeared to be a little out of it.Upon hearing the question, he lowered his head and said, \u201c\u2026 I want to talk with you, big sis.\u201d\u201cHere?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin with her hands behind her back. \u201cI guess I can accompany you while you smoke a few cigarettes.\u201dBai Zhou took off his helmet and spoke with a hint of anxiety in his voice, \u201cI won\u2019t smoke. Don\u2019t you hate the smell of cigarettes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a special privilege just for you,\u201d coaxed Ji Fanyin.Bai Zhou looked at her, but he shook his head in the end. He took out his key and stood upright, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s talk upstairs.\u201dIn truth, Ji Fanyin carried a bottle of pepper spray wherever she went. She had also placed the local police station on her phone\u2019s quick dial too.While she did know a bit of martial arts and would be able to protect herself even if her client suddenly went on a rampage, it was still better to be prepared.For the time being, Bai Zhou still seemed to be in a normal state.While walking over to the lift, Ji Fanyin rummaged through her bag and took out a fruit candy. \u201cGive me your hand.\u201dBai Zhou was waiting for the lift with his hands in his pockets. His body stiffened for a moment from the abrupt request before he obediently stretched his hand forth. He tilted his head sideward with a reluctant look on his face as he grumbled, \u201c\u2026 What do you want?\u201dJi Fanyin placed the sweet on his palm and said, \u201cI want to give you a sweet.\u201dBai Zhou could feel a slight prick from the sweet wrapper on his hand. He clenched his fist tightly together and roared angrily, \u201cI\u2019m already 19 years old!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? Even people in their nineties eat sweets,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin doubtfully. \u201cGive it back if you don\u2019t want it.\u201dBai Zhou hurriedly unwrapped the sweet and popped the candy right into his mouth before harrumphing, \u201cNope!\u201dJi Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201d Is Bai Zhou the kind of person whose mental maturity plummets whenever he gets angry?There was a \u2018ding\u2019, and the lift arrived. Bai Zhou strode into the lift with such a forceful demeanor that it looked almost as if he was going to tear the place down.Ji Fanyin followed him in as she took out her phone to search for something.The lift was bright and spacious, and there were mirrors on both sides. While Ji Fanyin was searching for an application, she noticed Bai Zhou staring at her with a displeased look on his face.So, before the client could start complaining, Ji Fanyin took the initiative to ask first, \u201cHave you eaten yet?\u201dBai Zhou: \u201c\u2026\u201dWhatever words that he was intending to say earlier ended up being stifled in his throat. It was a while before he finally muttered, \u201cNot yet.\u201dJi Fanyin had also figured as much.It just so happened that she hadn\u2019t eaten yet, so she could reasonably freeload off him for dinner.\u201cWhat do you want to eat? I\u2019ll get some ingredients and cook for you.\u201d Ji Fanyin tapped into the supermarket delivery application and browsed through the ingredients available. \u201cIs it still French cuisine like last time or\u2026\u201d\u201cI want usual home-cooked meals,\u201d replied Bai Zhou firmly.Ji Fanyin regretfully removed the premium steak cut from her shopping cart.What a pity.------Yoo hang out with us in our Discord~ Got a neat community there!Mission 2 (\u0e07\ufe21'-'\ufe20)\u0e072/15 unique commenters on a chapterReward: 1 bonus chapterI recently started a Patreon (\uff61\uff65\uff65\uff61)Do consider supporting me a little in exchange for reading a couple of chapters in advance \u25cf\ufe4f\u25cf)Advanced chapters link: https://100kpsi.schk.co/Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was simply nothing in Bai Zhou\u2019s kitchen at all that she had to get even the bare necessities. She did manage to fill his kitchen with condiments such as oil, salt, soya sauce, and vinegar the last time she was here, but there was more to consider if she wanted to cook usual home cooked meals this time around.For one, it was certain that he wouldn\u2019t have common ingredients like rice and onion in his kitchen.She subconsciously followed Bai Zhou\u2019s footsteps while adding everything she needed into her shopping cart.Bai Zhou suddenly stopped without any warning, and she nearly bumped right into him. It was fortunate that there was some distance between them, allowing her to stop in time.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.Did he change his mind and decide to play with Ji Xinxin instead?Bai Zhou turned around and assessed the distance between them with his eyes before clicking his tongue in annoyance. Then, without saying anything at all, he began walking forward once more.Weirdly, he didn\u2019t do anything at all despite the abrupt halt. It was almost as if he was just experimenting to see if she would bump into him.Ji Fanyin: \u201c\u2026?\u201d Just how much did his mental maturity regress by?The brooding Bai Zhou unlocked his door using facial recognition technology before haphazardly tossing his leather shoes aside. He slipped into a pair of slippers and headed into the house.Ji Fanyin looked through the shoe rack, but just like before, there were only men-sized slippers. So, she put on the same ones she wore the last time she was here. While shutting the door, she asked, \u201cI remember that you aren\u2019t fond of food with strong flavors or odors?\u201dBai Zhou replied with a lackadaisical \u201cMm\u201d.Ji Fanyin took one last look through the shopping cart and ensured that there was enough food for two. With that, she confirmed the order.It would probably take thirty to forty minutes for the groceries to be delivered to their doorsteps. Ji Fanyin finally stowed her phone away and raised her gaze, only to see that Bai Zhou was nowhere to be seen. So, she tried calling his name.A slightly muffled voice sounded from the bedroom, \u201cI\u2019m changing my clothes\u2026 Don\u2019t come in!\u201dJi Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201d You were still playing with mud when I was touching world-class models with perfect abs during magazine shoots.She opened the fridge to take a look, and just as she expected\u2026How should I put this? It\u2019s almost shouting to me that \u2018This is the fridge of a young man living by himself\u2019.Ji Fanyin shouted over, \u201cBai Zhou, what do you want to drink?\u201d\u201cBeer.\u201dJi Fanyin glanced at the boxes of beers inside the fridge before heading to the water dispenser to get him a glass of warm water.When Bai Zhou walked out of his room in a white T-shirt and comfortable long pants and saw the glass of warm water on the bar counter: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s even more so when you\u2019re in a bad mood that you shouldn\u2019t vent your emotions through alcohol. It\u2019s not good for your body,\u201d said Ji Fanyin as she pushed the cup of warm water toward him. \u201cBig sis is doing this for your own good.\u201dBai Zhou maintained a \u2018\u2026\u2019 look on his face as he picked up the glass and obediently took a sip.Bai Zhou\u2019s penthouse was renovated with a modern design. It had an open concept kitchen that was linked with the living room, making the area look exceptionally spacious. There was a bar counter with stools on both sides that resembled a small office space.There was hardly anything on the bar counter though. There was only a speaker and a drawer box filled with chargers.Bai Zhou and Ji Fanyin stood opposite to one another with only half a meter between them. They could easily touch one another just by stretching their hands forward.Bai Zhou took a seat on one of the stools with the glass of water in his hand. He stroked the uneven edges of the glass with his fingers, seemingly deep in thought.His behavior was typical of a person who had many things bottled up in his heart and needed someone to confide in, so Ji Fanyin rested her head on her arm and waited patiently for him.Whatever happened at that banquet earlier today must have dealt a heavy blow to Bai Zhou for someone as arrogant as him to be in such low spirits.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did you just find out about it today?\u201d\u201cHe isn\u2019t much younger than me,\u201d sneered Bai Zhou. \u201cHe does look like the old man. Secretary Li told me that the old man wanted me to meet two people today, so I thought that they were someone important. Turns out they were his mistress and illegitimate son.\u201dJi Fanyin: The aristocratic circle sure is complicated.\u201cHe said that I\u2019d remain as the only successor\u2026\u201d Bai Zhou scoffed. \u201cJust his private properties are more than enough for those two to live comfortably for the rest of their lives.\u201dJi Fanyin wasn\u2019t surprised at all.When a couple like Bai Zhou\u2019s parents made an agreement to turn a blind eye to each other\u2019s extramarital affairs, the chances were that one of them would eventually end up having an illegitimate child.It would be a blessing if the illegitimate children had no interest in the family fortune, but most eventually choose to compete for the family fortune. Ji Fanyin had seen plenty of that in her previous world.\u201cHe even brought them over to introduce them to me. Does he expect me to call them \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018little brother\u2019?\u201d Bai Zhou gripped the cup tightly. \u201cIf he had appeared before me today, I\u2019d have sunk my fist into his face!\u201dCrime solved. This is the reason why Bai Zhou got into a fight today.Ji Fanyin sighed in her heart.Had it been her, she would have long come to terms with his disappointing parents and washed her hands out of their private affairs. It would just be a waste of time and effort anyway.However, Bai Zhou wasn\u2019t as unfeeling as she was. From a certain perspective, he was actually quite hot-blooded.\u201cAre you going to have a talk with your father?\u201d she asked gently. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t willing to meet those two, why don\u2019t you relay your thoughts to him properly?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear his voice now,\u201d Bai Zhou rejected the suggestion irritatedly.\u201cThen\u2026 what about your mother?\u201d Ji Fanyin decided to approach this problem from another perspective. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to it, right?\u201dBai Zhou fell silent once again.Ji Fanyin couldn\u2019t help but notice the increasing grip strength on the glass he was holding. She felt like that innocent glass was going to shatter very soon.\u201cShe already knows,\u201d said Bai Zhou hoarsely. \u201cShe also\u2026\u201dUnable to speak any further, he grabbed his own forehead out of distress and took in a deep breath. His sharp eyebrows furrowed into a pained frown.Ji Fanyin caught on right away.The chances were likely that both of Bai Zhou\u2019s parents had an illegitimate child each. Thanks to that, the scales of balance were able to easily reach another equilibrium when they finally came clean with one another.This was something for their respective factions to rejoice over since they would be spared from unnecessary discord\u2026 though the same couldn\u2019t be said about their family members.Ahhh, the aristocratic circle sure is complicated!Ji Fanyin gently ruffled Bai Zhou\u2019s hair and said, \u201cWhat is it that upset you the most? Is it because they are different from how you expected them to be?\u201d\u201c\u2026 No, they were exactly the same as I expected them to be. It was just that I thought that I was already underestimating their shamelessness, but they still managed to exceed my expectations in the end.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s actually a simple way you can prove to them that they\u2019ve done wrong,\u201d said Ji Fanyin.Bai Zhou raised his head to look at her. \u201cHow?\u201dJi Fanyin looked at him with a smile and said, \u201cAll you have to do is to make sure that you don\u2019t stoop to their level and do the same things as they did.\u201dWhat a pity that you, Bai Zhou, have already stooped down to their level. You have already disrespected your own feelings and others.The two of them stared at one another for a few seconds, neither of them saying a word at all.Ji Fanyin maintained her gentle smile whereas Bai Zhou\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed up and down in unease.This awkwardness was broken by the intercom call coming from downstairs.\u201cIt must be the delivery man,\u201d said Ji Fanyin as she rose to her feet. She patted Bai Zhou\u2019s head lightly as she said, \u201cYou must be starving. I\u2019ll go get the ingredients.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To be more exact, Bai Zhou couldn\u2019t even recall a single instance of that happening.It was either the three of them dining at a huge table with many outsiders or him eating all alone.The Bai Family was probably the farthest away from what one would deem a typical ordinary household.Bai Zhou subconsciously shut down his brain, avoiding the important question of who the person hard at work in the kitchen was. Instead, he stared at her with a glass that was as empty as his mind in his hand, choosing to immerse himself in this moment of peace.Is this the kind of peaceful warmth that ordinary people feel when they return home exhausted from work?Bai Zhou had taken in far too much information today that he wanted to put a lid on his mind and not think anymore. However, a question that had been circling in his head for the last few days refused to grant him rest.It was getting increasingly difficult for him to endure not posing the question to the person before him.He tried his best to hold himself back, but when Ji Fanyin placed a pot of Pork Rib Lotus Soup on the dining table, he finally caved in.\u201cThe person who has been playing with us for the past few days, is she really a woman?\u201dThe accumulation of emotions that had stifled his heart all this while was released along with the voicing of that question, leaving him feeling much lighter than before.Ji Fanyin halted for an instant upon hearing that question. She turned to look at Bai Zhou with a smile and asked, \u201cAre you doubting me?\u201dBai Zhou pursed his lips tightly.This doubt had been floating in his head since a few days ago.No, to be more accurate, he had stumbled upon an important piece of evidence just a few days ago.Whenever he was playing with Ji Xinxin and Kitty, Kitty\u2019s mic was always switched off and she would never talk. He asked Ji Xinxin about this, and she said that Kitty couldn\u2019t speak Chinese and was a little shy around strangers, so she decided not to turn on her mic.Bai Zhou trusted those words, but he simply couldn\u2019t help but notice some problems as they played together a few more times.For one, Ji Xinxin\u2019s responses throughout the voice chat were oddly delayed at times. Sometimes, it took a long while after he asked a question before she finally responded, and her answer was off at times. It was like she was distracted by something else.Another anomaly he noticed was Ji Xinxin abruptly turning off her mic at times.Kitty\u2019s actions in the game were also rather unusual.It was common knowledge in PUBG that giving out good equipment and determinedly defending a weaker teammate from dying were gestures of affection, and that was how Bai Zhou treated Ji Xinxin in the game.But Kitty\u2019s actions were identical to his. In fact, the two of them would often bump into one another while trying to save Ji Xinxin.All of these anomalies were so apparent that Bai Zhou couldn\u2019t help but think deeper into them.He did raise his suspicions at the start, giving Ji Xinxin the chance to dispel his concerns. However, two days ago, when Ji Xinxin excused herself to pick a call, Bai Zhou happened to overhear her chatting with another man using French.The phone call itself wasn\u2019t an issue; the problem lay in the fact that he overheard the conversation through not Ji Xinxin\u2019s but Kitty\u2019s mic.There were only two possibilities. Either Kitty was currently in the same room with Ji Xinxin and another man happened to be with them at the moment, or that Kitty wasn\u2019t a man in the first place and that Ji Xinxin had been lying to him.\u2026 Of course, Bai Zhou knew deep down that the person standing before him couldn\u2019t possibly answer his question. He wasn\u2019t really expecting an answer anyway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you ever feel uncomfortable, make sure to tell me right away. You\u2019ll at least feel better once you confide in me.\u201dBai Zhou didn\u2019t expect Ji Fanyin to suddenly hit him.

Everyone else is of secondary concern here, do you understand?\u201dBai Zhou frowned. \u201cBut you told me that\u2026\u201d\u201cIt doesn't matter. Be it that person\u2019s gender, appearances, country of origin, or background, none of those matter at all.\u201d Ji Fanyin interjected right in and spoke with a forceful tone that allowed no room for no doubts. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t waste your time on people who can\u2019t even be compared to you.\u201dBai Zhou: \u201c\u2026\u201dHis face began to redden bit by bit. He slowly picked up his chopsticks and reached for the nearest dish before hurriedly stuffing some into his mouth.\u2026Ji Fanyin was glad that she had managed to beguile Bai Zhou.Bai Zhou\u2019s words were unclear, but it wasn\u2019t too difficult to figure out what had happened.Ji Xinxin most likely got overconfident and tried to hook two fishes at once, only to end up giving herself away.Ji Fanyin might have managed to placate Bai Zhou for the time being, but that didn\u2019t solve the root of the problem. Ultimately, the only one who could resolve this issue was Ji Xinxin herself.Ji Xinxin should stop expanding her fishery for the time being and focus on stability instead. It\u2019s not hard to expand the fishery, but sustaining it does take quite a bit of effort once it gets too large.Ji Fanyin began digging into the food as she wondered if Ji Xinxin had realized that Bai Zhou was already onto her.To be honest, this didn\u2019t really have anything to do with her since she was nothing more than a hired actor. It would suffice to leave the headache for Ji Xinxin to deal with.Ji Fanyin raised her head to take a look at Bai Zhou, only to realize that her earlier remark about how others couldn\u2019t be compared with him was a little too potent.They were several minutes into the meal by now, but Bai Zhou\u2019s head still remained lowered. He continued to tackle that single dish placed in front of him, as if he was going to stuff himself full with that one dish.Ji Fanyin heaved a deep sigh before topping up her foolish client\u2019s plate with the other dishes. \u201cHere, try this fish. Do you want a bowl of soup?\u201dBai Zhou quietly passed his bowl to her, and Ji Fanyin took the bowl, stood up, and began serving soup for him.It was then that a ringtone sounded. Bai Zhou\u2019s phone, which was placed by the side of the table, lit up, revealing a display picture that familiar Ji Fanyin was familiar with.Ji Xinxin.Bai Zhou leisurely glanced at his phone when he first heard the ringtone, but when he saw whom the call was from, he put down his chopsticks and anxiously reached forth to grab it.His vigorous movement caused a huge ruckus as bowls and plates were shoved around.However, Bai Zhou was hardly in the mood to care about the state on the table. His complexion as he grabbed his phone was awful, almost as if he was a scum caught cheating by his girlfriend.Ji Fanyin calmly put down the ladle and wickedly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Aren\u2019t you going to pick up the call?\u201dBai Zhou looked at the phone in his hand with a deep frown before raising his head to look at Ji Fanyin. He hesitated for a moment as to whether he ought to excuse himself, but in the end, he decided to pick up the call on the spot.\u201cBig sister? Mm\u2026 I have something up today, so I won\u2019t be joining you for the game. Have fun.\u201dMeanwhile, Ji Fanyin quietly pushed the bowl of soup in front of Bai Zhou. She even specially made her way over to a drawer to grab him a soup spoon.God knows how difficult it is to find all of these crockeries and eating utensils in Bai Zhou\u2019s home.

He spoke with an almost displeased tone, \u201c\u2026 Who told you about the affairs that happened tonight? Song Shiyu?\u201dJi Fanyin pondered about the question over the meal.Would Song Shiyu tell Ji Xinxin about the happenings during the banquet earlier on? Hmm\u2026 I think his motive is lacking.At least for the time being, it doesn\u2019t seem like the involvement of illegitimate children would affect Bai Zhou\u2019s future, let alone his place in Ji Xinxin\u2019s heart. Besides, snitching is at odds with the kind of refined gentlemanly character Song Shiyu had chosen to play. He stands to lose more by trying to gossip behind others.The culprit should be someone else.The intuition to process and evaluate information was extremely important to a \u2018King of the Seas\u2019. While Ji Fanyin was still making logical deductions on the situation, Bai Zhou\u2019s conversation had already moved on to the next phase.\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Bai Zhou\u2019s finger moved around the table nervously. \u201c\u2026 My account has been banned. I might not be able to join you for the next few days. I\u2019ll call you when my account is finally unbanned.\u201dJi Fanyin was so free that she even started to help Bai Zhou keep count .Three lies so far, and each is smoother than the previous.\u201cSee you, big sister.\u201d It seemed like the conversation had ended there, but Bai Zhou didn\u2019t put down his phone right away. Instead, he hesitantly asked, \u201cBig sister, there\u2019s something I want to ask you\u2026\u201dHe paused for several seconds here before continuing on, \u201c\u2026 Never mind, it\u2019s nothing much. Make sure to take care of yourself.\u201dJi Fanyin thought that it was quite fascinating. It interested her to watch as a person\u2019s feelings slowly changed in nature due to the complications of their own mind.However, it was best for her major clients not to have a change of heart till she finally decided to do away with this job. So, when she saw that Bai Zhou had hung up her phone and was just about to say something, she cut right in and said, \u201cCareful, the soup is still hot.\u201dBai Zhou clicked his tongue. Almost as if he was venting his anger at himself, he lifted the bowl and gulped it down in a single mouthful.Ji Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201dYoungsters. What\u2019s the point?She stayed at Bai Zhou\u2019s house for two hours in total. She made sure to clean up the bar counter and kitchen properly after the meal. Just as she was about to leave, Bai Zhou, who was leaning against the walls of the entryway with crossed arms, suddenly stopped her with a question.\u201cSong Shiyu looked for you last night?\u201d he asked.Ji Fanyin was in the midst of putting on her heels when she turned over to look at him.As service time was already over, Ji Fanyin\u2019s attitude had reverted back to her usual lackadaisical self. \u201cMmhm. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cFor free?\u201d\u201cFor free?\u201d Ji Fanyin repeated before refuting it with a chuckle. \u201cHow\u2019s that possible?\u201dAfter putting on her heels, she rose to her feet. As her heels were fairly tall, Bai Zhou naturally reached out to support her in case she lost her balance, but she subconsciously avoided his touch.This set of actions surprised the two of them.Bai Zhou clicked his tongue and retracted his hand unhappily, and Ji Fanyin didn\u2019t bother explaining her avoidance of his touch. She calmly bade him farewell as if nothing had happened and walked out of the house.\u201cHey,\u201d Bai Zhou suddenly called out to her. \u201cAren\u2019t you curious why I asked you that?\u201d\u201cI have no interest in my client\u2019s personal life,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin as she rubbed her fingers together, a gesture for money. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me divulging whatever that has happened today to anyone else.\u201dThat\u2019s why, my esteemed customer, please don\u2019t fall for me that easily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was quite busy for the entire week, so she was only able to make time for it on the weekend.Her old bank account was applied for by Father Ji and Mother Ji, but those two had been spamming her phone with calls ever since the movie screening.She would still pick up their calls at the start, but when they kept asking meaningless questions like \u2018How have you been?\u2019, she started to simply leave the phone on the table and continue whatever she was doing.KInship was nowhere near the top in her list of priorities at the moment. Making a fortune was far more important.That was also why she applied for a new bank account.She dropped by the bank in the late afternoon to finish up the procedures and transfer all of the money she had into it. Following that, she dropped her two clients a message to inform them about the change in her bank account number.She didn\u2019t forget to close her old bank account too.The bank manager tried to retain her, but Ji Fanyin insisted on it.The sun was already showing signs of setting by the time she left the bank. She happened to be near a university, so there were many youthful university students on the streets.She couldn\u2019t help but notice an advertisement poster plastered around about a varsity basketball competition finals that were going to be held today at 4 P.M.She took a look at her watch and noted that it was 3:30 P.M.This is really too much of a coincidence. It feels like the world is dropping me a hint.Well, I guess that I don\u2019t have anything important today anyway.After a moment of consideration, Ji Fanyin tapped into her conversation window with Chen Yunsheng and confirmed that she was indeed near the location of the basketball finals.\u2026 Should I take a look?Ji Fanyin headed to the nearest convenience shop and bought some sports drinks, energy bars, and fruits before making her way to the match location. Along the way, she began messaging Chen Yunsheng.\u2026There was a huge crowd on the basketball court.Youth, sweat, hunks, and basketball\u2014these four words fit perfectly here.There was still half an hour to the commencement of the match, but the audience had already settled into their seats. Some of them had even brought decent-looking cheering banners with them.Both teams were already on the court. Some of them were warming up whereas the others were listening to their coach\u2019s pep talk.\u2026 There was also one cool guy who snuck over to the bench to grab his phone.\u201c\u2015Chen Yunsheng!\u201d the coach shouted. \u201cLook at the time! Why are you still looking at your phone?!\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m just taking a glance.\u201d Chen Yunsheng expectantly picked up his phone which had vibrated earlier and took a look at it. His face brightened up right away. \u201cCoach, I need to head out for a moment.\u201dThe volume of the coach\u2019s voice was really no joke. \u201cRight now? I\u2019ll bloody smack your head off!\u201dOne of Chen Yunsheng\u2019s teammates that had insider news remarked teasingly, \u201cHeh! Judging from your reaction, that big sister whom you met outside must have sent you a message, right?\u201d\u201cOh? Is it the legendary big sister whom our faculty hunk invited to the competition but still hasn\u2019t received a proper response yet?\u201d\u201cCoach, you should also understand where he\u2019s coming from. Let him fetch her here. As the saying goes, \u2018it\u2019s better to tear down ten temples than to ruin a good marriage\u2019!\u201dThe coach glanced at his watch before snorting impatiently, \u201cI\u2019ll give you eight minutes!\u201dNot wasting even a second, Chen Yunsheng grabbed his jacket and phone before taking flight.\u201cBrat, slow down a little!

I\u2019m coming over to fetch you right now. The place is a little confusing so it\u2019s very easy for you to get lost.\u201dJi Fanyin quickly sent him a photo.Chen Yunsheng took a quick look at the photo before grabbing a nearby student to ask, \u201cHey, do you know where this place is?\u201dThe student propped up his black-rimmed glasses and nonchalantly pointed in a direction, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s right under that building over there.\u201d\u201cThanks!\u201d Chen Yunsheng put on his jacket and dashed over. It was as if he had an eternal spring of youthful energy inside of him, and it took him only two minutes to rush over to the opposite building.It didn\u2019t take him long before he caught sight of Ji Fanyin under a distinct logo.She was wearing a mask, and her face was lowered toward her phone, but Chen Yunsheng was certain that he had gotten the right person.His footsteps immediately screeched to a halt. He took a brief moment to calm his breathing before heading over to greet her, but he didn\u2019t try to intentionally conceal the joyful tone in his voice, \u201cBig sister!\u201dThe woman standing there raised her head. She pulled down her mask and smiled at him, \u201cHi.\u201d\u201cI thought that you\u2019d be too busy with work to watch the competition.\u201d Chen Yunsheng was a little nervous. \u201cWhat are you holding? Is it heavy? I\u2019ll carry it for you.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help but secretly take a good look at Ji Fanyin as he asked.Ah, she\u2019s dressed casually today without any make-up. She looks beautiful in a different way.\u2026 How should I put it? Both her outfit and her disposition feel quite different.\u201cI got them at a convenience shop earlier on. I don\u2019t know if these are appropriate.\u201d Ji Fanyin showed the contents of the plastic bag to Chen Yunsheng. \u201cI recall that basketball players would usually get a bit of time to replenish their energy off-court, so I got some sports drinks, fruits, and energy bars. It would be great if these can be of any help.\u201d\u201cOf course they are!\u201d Chen Yunsheng happily took the heavy plastic bag from her hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how gluttonous those guys can get. There are even times when everything is gone before I could even grab anything. Eesh!\u201dHe chose to put on a pitiful front.He read on the internet that going for a pitiful but cute impression could do wonders when trying to court confident women, so he unhesitatingly cast his pride aside!\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin as she put her mask back on. She took a look at her watch and asked, \u201cHow long is the match going to be?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll only take a little more than an hour!\u201d replied Chen Yunsheng nervously. \u201cDo you have something up afterward?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any work lined up,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with a shake of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the match is a little shorter than I expected\u2026 Did you sneak out of the court?\u201d\u201cMy coach gave me eight minutes,\u201d Chen Yunsheng quickly clarified with a pitiful look on his face. \u201cShall we head over? I\u2019ll get you a front-row seat at the basketball court.\u201dHe figured that if there were no more front row seats, he would place Ji Fanyin at the closest seats commonly dubbed as the \u2018family seats\u2019. There was bound to be space there.As long as he explained it carefully, it was unlikely that the other party would mind it too much given her easygoing personality.Chen Yunsheng happily accompanied Ji Fanyin toward the basketball court with the bag of goodies in his hands. He felt like he was drifting amidst clouds, but fortunately, he was still able to retain a bit of invaluable rationality to hold a conversation, \u201cBig sister, did you happen to have some work to do in the vicinity?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Ji Fanyin pointed to the advertisement posters that were plastered all around the campus and said, \u201cI happened to see one of those while walking around the streets so I thought that I could head over to take a look. It sure is a coincidence, isn\u2019t it?\u201dChen Yunsheng clenched his fists tightly: I\u2019ll have to treat those in the publicity department to a meal to thank them.It took Chen Yunsheng two minutes to run to where Ji Fanyin was, so it only took them a few minutes to walk over to the basketball court too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Upon seeing Chen Yunsheng, he quickly grabbed him and exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s already been ten minutes! Hurry up and return to the court!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get someone to bring you to your seat\u2026\u201d Chen Yunsheng was still dilly-dallying, but three other tall and brawny teammates ran over at that moment and dragged him away.Ji Fanyin waved at Chen Yunsheng with a smile and mouthed to him: All the best.Chen Yunsheng barely stood his ground against his teammates by grabbing the edge of the door and said, \u201cBig sister, you must make sure to only look at me later on!\u201dWith that, he was dragged off as pitifully as one could imagine.His teammates couldn\u2019t help but retort, \u201cIt\u2019s really terrifying when a cold-faced hunk like you suddenly undergoes a 180-degree twist in personality\u2026\u201dJi Fanyin chuckled at their banter. She leisurely entered the basketball court after them and took a brief look around the area.There was naturally an audience stand, but it appeared to be completely filled at the moment.Surprisingly, she found a familiar face amongst the audience\u2015Song Shiyu.He was probably invited because he was a renowned alumnus who had now become a successful entrepreneur.Ji Fanyin disinterestedly looked away. It was then that a young lady jogged over to her side.\u201cNice to meet you, Miss Ji? Chen Yunsheng told me to help you look for a seat.\u201d The young lady sounded a little nervous.Ji Fanyin pulled down her mask and said, \u201cI\u2019m Ji Fanyin.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d The young lady looked at her in confusion and asked doubtfully, \u201cYou\u2019re Senior Ji Xinxin\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s my younger sister.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d The young lady didn\u2019t think too much into it and began leading Ji Fanyin toward the sides. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many seats left at the moment. Are you fine with the seats near the coach\u2019s bench? It\u2019ll be hard to find another seat, and you wouldn\u2019t get as good of a view of the match too. However, I think it\u2019ll be better if I tell you in advance\u2026\u201dShe paused hesitantly for a moment before continuing on.\u201cThose seats are commonly known as the \u2018family seats\u2019. There are no explicit rules about it, but those who sit there are usually either esteemed guests or the players\u2019 family members and girlfriends. Big sister\u2026 i-is that okay with you?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re calling me big sister too?\u201d Ji Fanyin glanced at the seat the young lady was pointing out. \u201cIs it that row over there?\u201d\u201cY-yes.\u201dJi Fanyin comforted her and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ve troubled you all by coming in at the last moment. You don\u2019t need to walk me there; I can head there by myself. You probably have a lot on your hands right now since the match is about to begin, right?\u201d\u201cA-ah. Then\u2026 I\u2019ll get going?\u201d The young lady gestured toward the seat before walking away stiffly with uncoordinated hands and legs.Ji Fanyin touched her own face and wondered if she really looked that frightening.Under the curious gaze of the nearby crowd, she calmly made her way through a special passageway that led toward the \u2018family seats\u2019. She settled down on the first empty seat she saw.The young lady sitting on the adjacent seat turned toward her and greeted her amicably, \u201cHello, I\u2019m Chen Yunshan. You can think of it as a woman\u2019s sixth sense, but by any chance, is it possible that you\u2019re acquainted with my younger brother, Chen Yunsheng? I saw him running out earlier, and the two of you arrived one after another not too long later. So, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder about it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve long heard that the more gorgeous a woman is, the sharper her sixth sense is. It looks like there\u2019s some truth to that claim,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m Ji Fanyin. Nice to meet you.\u201dOddly enough, this wasn\u2019t the first time Ji Fanyin met Chen Yunshan. The last time they met, she was accompanied by another man who happened to be present here too.\u201cI came here with a friend. He used to be from Yunsheng\u2019s school.\u201d Chen Yunshan turned to the side and began introducing her male companion to Ji Fanyin. \u201cThis is Song Shiyu. Ah, you probably already know him if you graduated from the same school.\u201dJi Fanyin looked at Song Shiyu and said with a smile, \u201cWe\u2019ve met before, but we aren\u2019t that close to one another.\u201d------Discord || Twitter || Advanced Chapter for Patreon SupportersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, she ignored his gaze and focused her attention on the competition.It was the finals after all. The match was so intense that it spurred deafening cheers from the supporters of both teams in the indoor basketball court.The match concluded with the victory of Chen Yunsheng\u2019s team. There was roaring applause from the crowd, and Chen Yunshan hopped to her feet excitedly.Ji Fanyin clapped along with the crowd as she began thinking about what she should have for dinner.The award ceremony was pretty decent too. The third place and fourth place were decided by another match that happened simultaneously with the finals, and the third-place team joined them in the award presentation ceremony too.As soon as the award ceremony came to an end, Chen Yunsheng ran to the audience stand with his medal and frantically waved his hand to catch Ji Fanyin\u2019s attention, \u201cBig sister, big sister!\u201dJi Fanyin subconsciously stood up, but she quickly glanced toward Chen Yunshan.\u201cAh no, I\u2019m his cousin. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re quite close to one another so we address each other directly by our names,\u201d Chen Yunshan quickly clarified. She giggled under the cover of her hand and said, \u201cYou should quickly head over. Look how anxious he is.\u201dSo, Ji Fanyin walked toward the railing and looked downward at Chen Yunsheng, saying, \u201cCongratulations.\u201dChen Yunsheng tiptoed a little. With his long limbs, he was able to hang the gleaming medal around her neck.Ji Fanyin could immediately feel the weight on her neck. The medal swayed freely beneath her eyes.\u201c\u2026 Are you giving it to me?\u201d\u201cYup!\u201d Chen Yunsheng warily took a step back and said, \u201cI don\u2019t accept any refunds.\u201dHe cheekily waved his hand at her before running off.But before he could make his escape, his teammates swarmed him and dragged him back toward the audience stand where Ji Fanyin was.Ji Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe touched the medal hanging around her neck as she looked at Chen Yunsheng with a slightly helpless look.To be honest, I shouldn\u2019t be accepting this gift. It\u2019s scalding to the touch.Chen Yunsheng stared at Ji Fanyin with glistening, fawning eyes.\u201cAccept him! Accept him!\u201d Chen Yunsheng\u2019s teammates began cheering loudly.Chen Yunsheng frowned upon hearing their cheers. He quickly turned to them and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t confessed yet. Stop messing around.\u201dHe chased off his teammates with a fierce look on his face, but the commotion had already drawn half of the eyes in the indoor basketball court.Chen Yunsheng snuck a peek at Ji Fanyin before slowly inching his way toward her. He leaned against the railing and apologized, \u201cBig sister, sorry about that. They don\u2019t mean anything bad. I\u2019ll teach them a lesson later. They won\u2019t dare to do it anymore in the future.\u201dJi Fanyin remarked contemplatively, \u201cAnd I thought that you were that cute in front of everyone.\u201dBut it turns out that he only acts cute in front of her. Doesn\u2019t that make him even cuter?Chen Yunsheng\u2019s face reddened. He protested softly, \u201cA man can\u2019t be called cute, but since it\u2019s coming from big sister\u2026 it\u2019s fine.\u201dJi Fanyin asked him, \u201cYou won\u2019t regret giving me this medal?\u201d\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d Chen Yunsheng replied affirmatively. He placed his chin on the railing and said, \u201cI\u2019m only giving it to you because it\u2019s something I cherish a lot.\u201d\u201cJust because you cherish something doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019ll see value in it too,\u201d someone suddenly interjected.Ji Fanyin glanced at Song Shiyu, who was currently gazing down on Chen Yunsheng beside her.Chen Yunsheng nonchalantly turned to Song Shiyu and replied, \u201cBig risk, big return. I can\u2019t possibly not do anything just because I\u2019m afraid of failure, right?\u201dHe even turned to Ji Fanyin right after to seek her acknowledgment, \u201cAm I right, big sister?\u201dJi Fanyin burst into laughter.

Then, do you have anyone you like at the moment?\u201dSong Shiyu\u2019s intervention brought a frown to Chen Yunshan\u2019s face, compelling her to pull him away. He just so happened to be walking behind Ji Fanyin when Chen Yunsheng asked his question, allowing him to hear it loud and clear.He didn\u2019t even notice that his footsteps had stalled to a halt in wait for the answer.He felt that he already had the answer to that question, but despite so\u2026 he wanted to hear a direct confirmation from her mouth.It felt like a long time had passed before he finally heard her voice.She chuckled softly before saying, \u201cAnyone I like? Hmm\u2026 No one at the moment.\u201dChen Yunsheng\u2019s eyes lit up right away. Just as he was about to let out a soft celebratory cheer, a loud excited male voice boomed across the indoor basketball court through the speakers.\u201cEveryone heard that? She says that she doesn\u2019t have anyone she likes at the moment!\u201dThe spectating crowd was weirdly riled up about that. \u201cOooooooh!!!!\u201dChen Yunsheng\u2019s face darkened.He turned his head around coldly. The man who was eavesdropping behind him with a microphone in hand caught a whiff of danger and immediately made his escape. He was so agile that one could mistake him for a core member of the track and field club.Chen Yunsheng chased after him furiously.Ji Fanyin looked upon the bustle as she touched the medal hanging in front of her chest. Perhaps it was the influence from the lively atmosphere, the edges of her lips curled up a little.She took a look at her watch before turning around, only to see Song Shiyu standing behind her. He was staring at her intently.\u201cMr Song?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin. \u201cIs there any problem?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Song Shiyu gritted his teeth tightly.Ji Fanyin had a good idea what he was going to ask, but she didn\u2019t think that she was obliged to give in to him outside of service hours.So, she directed a nod toward Song Shiyu and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be heading off first if there\u2019s no issue. See you, Miss Chen.\u201dIt looks like their matchmaking is going pretty well. If the two of them are confirmed to be dating, I\u2019ll have to strike Song Shiyu off my list of clients.Ji Fanyin had completely no interest in getting caught up in some depraved love scandal.While making her way out, she took out her phone and sent a message to Chen Yunsheng, congratulating him once more for clinching the champion\u2019s seat.Chen Yunsheng was still busy chasing his teammate, so he didn\u2019t reply right away.Ji Fanyin headed all the way to the main road outside the campus and hailed a cab. She didn\u2019t see any hint of Song Shiyu along the way.They were in a public place after all. He wouldn\u2019t want to be seen by anyone else and get caught up in some rumor with her.\u2026\u201cShe has a good personality. My uncle\u2019s family will be fond of her,\u201d said Chen Yunshan full of envy. \u201cIf only I was as confident and open-hearted as her.\u201dShe turned to look at Song Shiyu, only to see that his attention was wandering somewhere else.\u201c\u2026 Mr Song?\u201dSong Shiyu snapped out of his daze and turned to her with a smile, saying, \u201cSorry, I was thinking about work\u2026 It really is a coincidence for us to bump into each other here. Miss Chen, what are your plans for the day? Shall I drive you home, or are you returning with your younger brother?\u201dChen Yunshan looked a little disappointed. She lowered her head and fidgeted with her feet as she replied, \u201cI drove here. You should get going if you have matters to attend to. You don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d\u201cAt least allow me to walk you to the parking lot.\u201d Song Shiyu maintained his gentlemanly demeanor.After seeing Chen Yunshan off, Song Shiyu walked over to his car and took out his phone, only to put it down after several seconds of hesitation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The heart-shaped chocolate and the gift wrapper were still in there, untouched.In truth, he didn\u2019t like chocolate that much.After staring at it for a moment, he slowly made his way into his room and opened his wardrobe.Song Shiyu had a mild obsessive-compulsive disorder. He liked to classify items and place them in specific locations, so it never took him long to find his stuff.However, he didn\u2019t find the item he was looking for at its designated spot this time around.The tattered bracelet that should have been in the topmost accessories drawer wasn\u2019t where it was supposed to be.He quickly pulled open the second and third drawers, but it wasn\u2019t there either.He started to get a little anxious. He bent down to look through his ties, watches, belts\u2026 He even recalled the clothes he wore that day and searched through their pockets, but he couldn\u2019t find the bracelet Ji Fanyin had given to him that day as a birthday present.I clearly retrieved it from the parking lot that day and placed it here. Why is it not here?It was just like how Ji Fanyin told him that she liked him at the underground parking lot the other day, only to tell another man that she didn\u2019t have anyone that she liked shortly after.Song Shiyu angrily slammed the drawers back in.He paced around the spot like an irritated beast. In the end, he decided to conduct an all-out search.It\u2019s not in the bedroom.It\u2019s not in the toilet.It\u2019s not in the living room.It\u2019s not in the parking lotWhen could I have possibly lost it?The apartment has designated housekeepers who would drop by from time to time in order to clean the place up, but they are professionals who wouldn\u2019t touch any of the residents\u2019 private possessions. I also didn\u2019t have any guests during this period of time either\u2026Song Shiyu\u2019s footsteps suddenly screeched to a halt.\u2026 No, there\u2019s one person who dropped by recently.With a livid look on his face, Song Shiyu grabbed his phone and dialed Ji Fanyin\u2019s number. But barely a second after the phone rang, he hung up the call.Even if it was really Ji Fanyin who took the bracelet away, what reason do I have to get her to give it back? Rather, why should I demand her to return a broken bracelet?Why should I be concerned whether Ji Fanyin still likes me or not?\u2026Ji Fanyin was preparing her dinner when she received Song Shiyu\u2019s call.She continued stirring the pot with a single hand while picking up the call with her free hand. \u201cHello?\u201d\u201cDid you touch my personal possessions without my permission while you were at my house?\u201d Song Shiyu questioned.Ji Fanyin gave his question some thought before replying, \u201cI only took away trash with me. Is there something important amongst them?\u201dSong Shiyu: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Ji Fanyin sealed off all of his routes with ease. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I checked the items beforehand before tossing them away. I\u2019m certain that they are things that you would have thrown away.\u201dShe could tell that Song Shiyu was really angry that day from how damaged the bracelet was. What really surprised her was him keeping it instead of throwing it away.Song Shiyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dJi Fanyin kindly reminded him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what it is? I might be able to recall it.\u201dIf you\u2019re able to put down your pride and mention it, that is.Song Shiyu hung up the call.Ji Fanyin put her phone down and continued stirring her pot. Shortly after, she received yet another call.\u201cHello, Mr Cen\u2026 Lunch tomorrow? Alright, send the address to me.\u201dAhh, so much work is coming in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was also oddly determined to stop him from obtaining Ji Fanyin\u2019s contact number.Through his constant harassment of Song Shiyu over the last few days, Cen Xiangyang felt that he had finally gotten to the bottom of this matter.Most likely, there\u2019s some sort of dirty deal between Song Shiyu and Ji Fanyin.Cen Xiangyang had actually never heard of Ji Fanyin prior to this. He was one of Ji Xinxin\u2019s suitors, but all along, he thought that she was the only daughter of the Ji Family.Not once had Ji Xinxin mentioned the existence of her twin sister to him.So, he spent some time visiting his juniors in Lakeside University and was surprised to learn that the Ji Fanyin he had met that day was very different from the \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 they knew of.They said that \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 was a gloomy reclusive, but Cen Xiangyang couldn\u2019t see how those two words could be applied to the Ji Fanyin he met at the movie premiere.They said that \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 was extremely ugly and dared not show her own face, but Cen Xiangyang felt his heart pounding in excitement just thinking about the Ji Fanyin he met.They said that \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 liked Song Shiyu, but Cen Xiangyang couldn\u2019t sense any affection from her attitude toward Song Shiyu. He could only conclude that she was able to hide her emotions well.The results made him feel like he had collected a bunch of false intelligence. In fact, he felt a little regretful that Ji Fanyin wasn\u2019t a social recluse. Someone like that would have been much easier to control.It looks like I can only count on my verbal skills to entice this thorny rose into making a deal with me.Cen Xiangyang spent some time making thorough preparations to ensure that everything would go his way before finally dropping her a call. It was already a few days later by then, but he was confident that his mixture of threats and baits would be enough to make her accept his deal.Sitting in the book caf\u00e9 they had agreed to meet at, Cen Xiangyang picked out a book named \u2018The Lucifer Effect\u2019 in a good mood while waiting for Ji Fanyin\u2019s arrival. He took a look at the time as he flipped open the book.I guess I can magnanimously forgive her even if she\u2019s late. It won\u2019t be long before she\u2019s mine anyway.Three minutes before the agreed meeting time, Ji Fanyin arrived at the restaurant.She walked toward the table under a waiter\u2019s lead. She took a glance at the cover of Cen Xiangyang\u2019s book and remarked with a smile, \u201cThe Stanford prison experiment. Who are you hoping to change?\u201dWords that directly pointed out the origin of the book meant that she wasn\u2019t just flaunting her knowledge here. Cen Xiangyang was about to rise to his feet when those words caused him to freeze up for a brief moment.\u2018The Lucifer Effect\u2019 and the Stanford prison experiment weren\u2019t exactly obscure topics, but very few of those who didn\u2019t dabble in related fields knew about them.\u201cIt caught my eye when I was looking through the bookshelves earlier. I\u2019ve only just started on it.\u201d Cen Xiangyang was able to quickly adjust his state and reply with an innocent smile. \u201cI\u2019ve only taken a brief look, but I must say that the notion that a person could be easily changed by their environment is quite an intriguing one.\u201dJi Fanyin didn\u2019t bother further discussing this topic with him. She responded with a casual nod and took her seat. \u201cI must have kept you waiting.\u201d\u201cNah, I\u2019ve also just arrived not too long ago,\u201d replied Cen Xiangyang. He passed the menu to Ji Fanyin and said, \u201cThere\u2019s something that I\u2019d like to talk to you about today\u2026 Shall we first order some food? I\u2019ll treat you.\u201dJi Fanyin\u2019s eyebrows shot up. She decisively picked out two expensive dishes and a freshly-squeezed beverage that had an artsy but incomprehensible name.After the waiter confirmed the orders and took his leave, Cen Xiangyang picked up the teapot and poured Ji Fanyin a cup of barley tea. \u201cI\u2019ve been quite busy ever since that day, so I wasn\u2019t able to ask you out till today.\u201dJi Fanyin received the cup of barley and thanked him. \u201cBusy with your new movie?\u201d\u201cYeah. There\u2019s a great deal of preparation work to be done before filming\u2026 Just like the ancient saying, \u2018the rations move before the army.\u2019\u201d Cen Xiangyang placed the teapot aside and carefully pushed the conversation toward the direction he wanted.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting how the concept of the movie I\u2019ve decided on half a month ago happens to be about a pair of twins too. Don\u2019t you think that it\u2019s a coincidence?\u201d he asked with a casual tone that made it sound like a passing remark.Ji Fanyin raised her eyebrows in interest, a signal for him to continue speaking.Cen Xiangyang felt a little peeved by her expression. It wasn\u2019t one that he thought would ever appear on Ji Xinxin\u2019s face. It was too casual and perfunctory.Ji Xinxin should be more\u2026 elegant, pure, and innocent.\u201c\u2026 The story is about a pair of estranged twin brothers who have never met one another before. The older brother is a respected cop whereas the younger brother is an idle vagrant. One day, the younger brother witnessed his older brother getting murdered by his enemies. He coveted his older brother\u2019s standing and lover, so he stole his identification documents and headed to his home. He wanted to take over his position.\u201dJi Fanyin calmly listened to his story with the cup of barley tea in her hands. She even chuckled softly in response to his words at one point in time.This chuckle looks a little like Ji Xinxin, Cen Xiangyang thought. Now I really want to hurry up and make her mine.Ji Fanyin waited for Cen Xiangyang to finish his story before asking, \u201cWas the younger brother exposed in the end?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait for the movie to hit the theaters in order to find out,\u201d Cen Xiangyang reined in his thoughts and replied in a half-joking manner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are the two of you able to act as one another impeccably to the point where it\u2019s impossible to tell the two of you apart?\u201dHe didn\u2019t receive an answer right away because the waiter served their first dish then.It was only after the waiter left that Ji Fanyin finally answered his question, \u201cI\u2019m quite curious about that too, but we have never tried that before.\u201d\u201cI thought that twins would put their identical appearances to full use and swap places with one another,\u201d Cen Xiangyang replied with a regretful sigh.He was indeed feeling a little regretful as Ji Fanyin was turning out to be a difficult catch, just as he had expected. However, he had no plans on giving up. He was determined to reel her in by hook or by crook.So, he decided to take a step back and attack from another angle. \u201cSong Shiyu told me about your affairs the other day\u2026 I heard that your parents are a little biased?\u201dThe earnestly eating Ji Fanyin stopped what she was doing.She raised her head, looked at Cen Xiangyang, and said with a smile, \u201cDirector Cen, don\u2019t you think that your roundabout way of speaking is a waste of time for adults?\u201dCen Xiangyang was choked up by her straightforward rebuttal for two seconds before he was able to slowly reply, \u201cIt looks like you\u2019re a smart person too. I\u2019ve already heard about your affairs from people who know you. Your parents only dote on Xinxin, making you an invisible person in the household. It\u2019s almost like they only have a single daughter\u2026 Is that true?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s true,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with a distracted nod.Cen Xiangyang realized that Ji Fanyin had just taken away the most tender piece of meat from the torched marble goby fish: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe paused for a moment before proceeding with his script, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to become Ji Xinxin and be as loved as she is?\u201dJi Fanyin raised her head to present a surprised look and said, \u201cNo, I want to enter the Forbes\u2019 wealthiest people ranking. I don\u2019t expect too much, just ten billion\u2026 No, 9.8 billion would suffice.Cen Xiangyang narrowed his eyes and asked slowly, \u201cYou\u2019re denying it, but isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re doing with Song Shiyu? Or are you trying to say that\u2026 it\u2019s fine with Song Shiyu but not with anyone else?\u201d\u201cAnyone else?\u201d\u201cWith me.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t any hint of surprise on Ji Fanyin\u2019s face at all. She rested her chin on her hand and said, \u201cCarry on.\u201d\u201cThis is a good thing for both you and me,\u201d said Cen Xiangyang confidently. \u201cWe can both get what we want. You\u2019ll obtain your younger sister\u2019s happiness, and I\u2019ll attain the sense of satisfaction I seek.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d Ji Fanyin shook her head. \u201cThe order should be reversed. I can give you the sense of satisfaction you want, and I\u2019ll obtain what I\u2019m seeking.\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s that any different?\u201d Cen Xiangyang was unbothered by her seemingly meaningless argument on semantics.\u201cWhat I want is not the happiness of others,\u201d said Ji Fanyin. \u201cWhat I\u2019m looking for is something simpler and far more practical.\u201dCen Xiangyang sensed that he was gradually losing power over the flow of the conversation, and the loss of control made him feel a little anxious. \u201c\u2026 What is it?\u201d\u201cDirector Cen, don\u2019t you pay the actors who work for you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Cen Xiangyang was silent for a few seconds before he finally grasped what Ji Fanyin was getting at. He stared at her in disbelief and exclaimed, \u201cYou want money?\u201dNo. No no no no! How could my Ji Xinxin possibly be obsessed with dirty money?\u201cIs there a problem with that?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin.Cen Xiangyang suddenly thought that Song Shiyu was very pitiful. \u201c\u2026 Song Shiyu paid you as well?\u201dJi Fanyin crossed her hands and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t answer that question.\u201dCen Xiangyang: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe conversation had gone down a different direction from what he had expected, but the endpoint looked to be the same. At least they did manage to exchange their views and expressed their interest to proceed with this transaction.Things still looked optimistic thus far.It was just that Cen Xiangyang couldn\u2019t help but feel like something was wrong as he paid for the meal.It was only till he walked out of the restaurant and saw a couple of people giving out flyers about a gym membership that it finally struck him.She\u2019s really viewing this as a business? It feels like she\u2019ll be even more vicious than gym memberships when ripping off her clients.Ji Fanyin put on her coat as she asked him, \u201cWould you like to have a look at the fee structure?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Cen Xiangyang felt like he was just like a plump lamb who had caught the eye of a wolf.But he was the one who first raised the suggestion, and he did want to entertain himself with this imitation while Ji Xinxin was away.So, Cen Xiangyang\u2019s eyes curled into a smile, and he said, \u201c\u2026 It\u2019ll be fine as long as you ensure that it\u2019s value for money.\u201d\u2026Not too long after the two of them parted ways, Cen Xiangyang received the so-called fee structure from Ji Fanyin. He checked the document\u2019s last edit and noted that it had just been reviewed not too long ago.What would lead to her reviewing her fee structure in recent days?With this thought in his mind, Cen Xiangyang opened the document and was immediately met with a series of detailed rules. It really looked like the fee structure of a legitimate company.On top of that, the most important part was placed obediently in the middle of the document, almost like a wolf hiding amidst a pack of sheep.When Cen Xiangyang saw that the prices started from 100,000 dollars per hour: \u201c\u2026\u201dThis is almost on par with top-tier celebrities! Is Song Shiyu really paying her this sum or compensating her through his body?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve to think of a way to expand my client base myself.Song Shiyu wasn\u2019t working as hard as she expected him to. So far, he had only introduced Bai Zhou to her.He should have already introduced the fourth one to me by now according to the \u2018future\u2019. Haaa, men really can\u2019t be counted on.While shaking her head, Ji Fanyin shut the laptop and settled down on the comfortable sofa to enjoy another movie. She penned down her review and posted it online before heading off to sleep.The money she had earned thus far was already enough for her not to worry about her income anymore.While raking in more money would indeed contribute to the progress of the \u2018Temptation of Home\u2019 app, over the past few weeks, she noticed that the key earner was still Emotion Points.Be it strangers or acquaintances, anyone who felt a sliver of emotion toward Ji Fanyin would be taken into account by the app.She had built up a fair presence in the social media thus far, resulting in a constant stream of Emotion Points coming in from places she knew not of.Other than that, she also occasionally received Emotion Points from her clients even outside of service hours. They were simply too self-conscious about their relationship to not have her on their minds.Ji Fanyin tapped into the \u2018Temptation of Home\u2019 app\u2019s logs and scrolled down. It didn\u2019t take her too long to spot Cen Xiangyang\u2019s name.There was a fair sum of Emotion Points coming in from him, though it was still nowhere on par with Song Shiyu.Just looking at the logs relating to Song Shiyu was enough for her to imagine the intense melodrama going on in his mind. To be honest, she didn\u2019t expect that he would be so shaken by her clearly expressing her lack of feelings toward him.She was even kind enough to make it a gradual process for him.Ji Fanyin looked through her day\u2019s income before checking the progress bar.So far, she had accumulated 200 million of the 10 billion goal. It was already possible to see a slight bit of green on the long progress bar, a representation of hope.My efforts are paying off. It looks like 10 billion isn\u2019t that far away anymore.Ji Fanyin put down her phone, intending to head off to sleep, but she suddenly received a call from Ji Xinxin.To be frank, Ji Fanyin was having difficulties trying to understand Ji Xinxin\u2019s insistence on calling her once every three days. It was almost as if Ji Xinxin had jotted it down on her calendar schedule. She had never forgotten about it, not even once.There were times when Ji Fanyin didn\u2019t pick up, and Ji Xinxin didn\u2019t show any particular reaction to it either. The latter would simply send a couple of messages instead and call her again three days later.Just what could her motive be?Ji Fanyin accepted the call with a slide of her finger. \u201cYes?\u201d\u201cBig sis.\u201d Ji Xinxin\u2019s voice sounded from the other side. \u201cI\u2019m standing on top of the Eiffel Tower. The scenery here is gorgeous! I want to show it to you too!\u201dJi Fanyin let out a yawn and said, \u201cPost it on your Moments page. I\u2019ll check it when I wake up tomorrow morning and give you a like.\u201d\u201cHow have you been doing?\u201d Ji Xinxin dropped her usual question. \u201cI heard from mum that you have gotten a job. What kind of job is it?\u201d\u201cRelationship counselor.\u201dJi Xinxin was stunned by the unexpected answer. \u201cAh\u2026 Is it something you\u2019re interested in?\u201d\u201cSo-so. The clients are hard to deal with, but that\u2019s just how work is like. At least I don\u2019t have to deal with them outside of working hours.\u201dJi Fanyin honestly didn\u2019t think that it was anything much.She didn\u2019t think that she would be stuck with her clients for too long. Who knows? Perhaps she might be able to wring them dry soon.Ji Xinxin continued asking a few casual questions while sharing what she had been up to the last few days, reminiscent of old friends catching up with one another. At some point, she casually asked, \u201cBig sis, did you meet Shiyu recently? I feel like he hasn\u2019t been in a good mood recently, but after all that has happened\u2026 I don\u2019t think that it\u2019ll be appropriate for me to ask him directly either.\u201dHer voice sounded a little awkward.\u201cYeah, I met him,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin leisurely. \u201cIsn\u2019t it normal for someone of his age to have his own secrets?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried about him\u2026\u201d Ji Xinxin sighed softly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m too far away at the moment. That\u2019s why I wanted to ask you to see if you know anything.\u201dJi Fanyin let out an \u201cAh\u201d as she wondered if she should let Ji Xinxin in about her \u2018severance of feelings\u2019 for Song Shiyu.Lest she keep talking about Song Shiyu before me. It\u2019s annoying.Every single wage slave shared a common dream: Please don\u2019t let me hear anything related to work outside of working hours.And to Ji Fanyin, \u2018Song Shiyu\u2019 was work.\u201cI\u2019m no longer interested in Song Shiyu,\u201d said Ji Fanyin. \u201cI have no idea how he\u2019s doing.\u201dJi Xinxin was quiet for a very long while. The whistling of wind and French mumbles could be heard from her side.\u201cYou\u2019re no longer interested in him?\u201d Ji Xinxin finally spoke up. \u201cIs it because of me? Is it because Song Shiyu confessed to me, that\u2019s why you feel that\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d Ji Fanyin sharply interjected to refute her deduction. \u201cFeelings of attraction come and go at a whim. I liked Song Shiyu before, but that doesn\u2019t mean that my feelings for him will remain forever.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Then,\u201d asked Ji Xinxin, \u201cwho are you interested in now?\u201d\u201cRight now, I just want to focus on my work and earn money.\u201d Ji Fanyin couldn\u2019t be bothered to analyze Ji Xinxin\u2019s words to figure out her intention. It was too troublesome. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it after my career kicks off.\u201dI should at least fulfill my little goal of 10 billion before thinking about dating anyone. After that\u2026 I guess I\u2019ll see how I can return to my original world before making further plans.\u201cI see,\u201d remarked Ji Xinxin with a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m relieved to hear that you aren\u2019t upset about it. Did you make new friends recently? I\u2019m curious to know what you\u2019ve been doing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not as if I\u2019ve fallen out of love, so why would I need the comfort of friends?\u201d Ji Fanyin took a glance at the time. \u201cI need to sleep soon.\u201d\u201cAlright. Goodnight, big sis.\u201d There was a slight pause before Ji Xinxin continued on, \u201cI\u2019ll be coming back in two months\u2019 time. My term break starts around Christmas, and I\u2019ll be staying for a fortnight over the New Years. Is there anything you want? I\u2019ll lug it back for you.\u201d\u201cNah, there isn\u2019t anything much I want now. Just make sure you have fun in France.\u201d And if possible, add a few new fishes to your fishery too. Who knows? I might just need them.\u201c\u2026 Alright!\u201dBefore hanging up, Ji Xinxin remarked, \u201cI feel like you have changed a lot ever since I left the country. I really want to come back as soon as possible to catch up with you.\u201dJi Fanyin replied with a perfunctory \u201cMm\u201d before hanging up. She placed her phone on the wireless charger on her bedside table, put on her steam eye mask, and drifted off into a sweet sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ji Fanyin had suddenly changed so much that her leading words didn\u2019t seem to work on her anymore.On top of that, ever since she left for France, she felt that she was gradually losing control over many things.The number of contacts she had had increased by twofold within a short period of time. The effort required to keep up with so many connections was really no joke. Even a skilled time manager like her was having trouble coping.Not to mention, problems kept cropping up one after another.For one, Bai Zhou was suddenly unwilling to play games with her anymore.Ji Xinxin wondered if his change of attitude came from him discovering that she had been bringing a spare tyre with her on their \u2018online dates\u2019. There was no doubt that she was making a risky maneuver here, but she had been careful to ensure that she wouldn\u2019t be exposed.Her explanation to her French spare tyre was that Bai Zhou was her younger brother, and that she wanted to play together with him.She would be seated alongside the French spare tyre whenever they played, so there was no need for the latter to use the voice chat. On top of that, she had changed her voice chat settings to \u2018Push-to-talk\u2019 so that Bai Zhou wouldn\u2019t hear her conversation with the French spare tyre.It just so happened that the very day Bai Zhou\u2019s attitude toward her changed, Ji Xinxin received a message from Cen Xiangyang informing her of a scandal relating to the Bai Family. This led her to deduce that Bai Zhou\u2019s anomalous behavior was caused by a conflict he had with his family.So, she had been devoting great effort to console Bai Zhou over the last few days lest she lost one of the biggest fishes in her fishery due to a moment of carelessness.Putting all things aside, she was actually quite fond of Bai Zhou.Bai Zhou\u2019s appearance checked off her boxes, though she thought that it would be wonderful if she could swap his personality with Song Shiyu\u2019s.\u2026 Ah, of course she was referring to Song Shiyu\u2019s superficial personality.And speaking of Song Shiyu, he was the one who had changed the most during this period of time.She rejected Song Shiyu shortly before going abroad, so it was understandable that he would be down in the dumps. Ji Xinxin also consciously gave him the cold shoulders for a prolonged period of time in case he attempted anything extreme.But as she dragged things out, she couldn\u2019t help noticing that Song Shiyu\u2019s attention was moving on from her to something else. His mind seemed to be all around the place during their recent voice calls, such that he wasn\u2019t able to respond to her as quickly as before.Yet, whenever she tried to sound him out, he would always shrug off the question and change the topic.It was not as if Ji Xinxin was a fool. She immediately realized that something had happened, just that Song Shiyu adamantly refused to tell her what it was.Last of all was Ji Fanyin\u2019s abrupt and massive change in personality.It wasn\u2019t just once or twice that Mother Ji called Ji Xinxin to grumble about Ji Fanyin\u2019s rebellious descent into depravity. While consoling Mother Ji that everything was fine, she also agreed that this was completely unlike the meek and cowardly Ji Fanyin she knew of.Ji Xinxin\u2019s insistence on calling Ji Fanyin once every three days was a habit she had inculcated over the years, but at the same time, it served the purpose of keeping tabs on the latter.The unexpected changes in these three people convinced Ji Xinxin to make a trip back to the country as soon as possible.She was concerned about what had happened, and she knew that she had to see what was going on with her own eyes in order to come up with a countermeasure.\u201cI pray that it\u2019s not the worst-case scenario,\u201d murmured Ji Xinxin as she booked her plane ticket and marked the day of her departure on her calendar.She took a look at the time and decided to send a message to Song Shiyu: \u3010Shiyu, are you asleep? The brand you like has recently announced the release of a new accessory, and it\u2019ll be hitting its flagship store in France first. Shall I get it for you and send it over?\u3011\u2026Song Shiyu was lying on his bed, struggling to fall asleep when he suddenly heard his ringtone.He subconsciously grabbed his phone to take a look. It was a notification that he had received a message from Ji Xinxin.He exhaled deeply, surprised at his own lack of enthusiasm.He tapped into the notification to check the message before falling silent. He didn\u2019t respond right away like he usually would.The brand that Ji Xinxin mentioned was indeed one which he deeply fancied. He would receive a message from their marketing staff whenever they released anything new.\u2026 The damaged bracelet that had vanished from his cupboard also came from the same brand.Due to that, whenever he heard the brand name, he would be immediately reminded of the words Ji Fanyin said that day\u2014\u201cAnyone I like? Hmm\u2026 No one at the moment.\u201d\u2014and inexplicable anger and frustration would gush out from his heart.Ji Xinxin: \u3010This newly-released bracelet has a casual business look. I think it\u2019ll look good on your wrist, and it\u2019s not expensive either. Why don\u2019t I buy one for you? Think of it as my apology gift to you\u3011Song Shiyu sat up from his bed. With a hand clutching his forehead in frustration, he typed out a message and edited it over and over again before finally sending it: \u3010Don\u2019t bother. I\u2019m not into any wrist accessories other than watches at the moment.\u3011For the first time, he turned down Ji Xinxin\u2019s suggestion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had neglected to ask Bai Zhou about his perception of Ji Xinxin\u2019s gaming skills.She led the two of them to a beautiful chicken dinner using Bai Zhou\u2019s smurf account, only for Bai Zhou to fall silent at their victory.\u201cThat\u2019s not how big sis plays,\u201d he said.It was only then that realization struck Ji Fanyin.Knowing how to let a fish show off his skills in a game is equally important as well. Otherwise, where is he going to get his sense of satisfaction from?Ji Fanyin realized that she had made a fatal error here, so she decided to compensate him by charging him half the usual price\u2026 For the duration of just this single round, of course.Recently, Bai Zhou had receded from an outgoing youth to a shut-in gamer. Their meetings were now all at his house, playing games, preparing meals, and eating together.The previous few appointments had Bai Zhou playing games and Ji Fanyin preparing the meal; this was the first time the two of them were playing together.Ji Fanyin felt like she had become an e-girl companion playing the role of a damsel in distress who needed her client\u2019s protection. Yes, an e-girl who offered additional cooking service.In any case, everything was fine as long as the client paid up.After yet another round of \u201cZhouzhou, someone is shooting me!\u201d, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d, \u201cI also don\u2019t know where I am!!!\u201d kind of gaming experience, Ji Fanyin was just about to take out the trash and leave when Bai Zhou suddenly stopped her.He had made the next appointment right after service hours ended the last few times, so Ji Fanyin thought that it was the same this time too. She replied, \u201cYes?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I want to go on a trip. The day after tomorrow,\u201d said Bai Zhou.Ji Fanyin responded with a questioning tilt of her head. She gathered two possible meanings from his words.He was either telling her that he wouldn\u2019t be contacting her for a period of time or that it was time for her to go on a business trip.A business trip\u2026 That sounds so troublesome.Ji Fanyin was tempted to turn down the reservation.\u201cAccompany me. It\u2019ll be a week.\u201d Bai Zhou paused for a moment before strongly emphasizing, \u201cWe\u2019ll be living in separate rooms.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do. My tropical fishes need to be fed every day,\u201d Ji Fanyin found a random excuse to reject him.Bai Zhou: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe stared at Ji Fanyin for a moment before saying, \u201c500,000 dollars per day. You won\u2019t have to fork out even a single cent.\u201dIt was a tempting offer, but Ji Fanyin had to seriously consider whether she would get eyed by Bai Zhou\u2019s family members if she accepted his offer.Bai Zhou had been squandering a frightening amount of money in recent days that the word \u2018extravagant\u2019 was starting to feel insufficient when describing him.\u201cThey think that money is the most important thing in the world anyway,\u201d remarked Bai Zhou with a shrug. \u201cSince money is the only thing they can give me, why can\u2019t I spend it as I like? They wouldn\u2019t care about this bit of money anyway.\u201dJi Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe began mentally calculating the price before haggling, \u201c800,000 dollars per day.\u201d\u201cDeal.\u201d Bai Zhou accepted the offer without any hesitation. \u201cHowever, this trip must be kept confidential. No one should know that you\u2019re going to the same place as me.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d Ji Fanyin gave him an \u2018okay\u2019 gesture. She was just about to head out when she looked through the doorway and realized that it had started raining.It was fortunate that the rain wasn\u2019t too heavy. She wouldn\u2019t have to walk too far in the rain in order to get into a cab anyway.So, she picked up the trash and started heading out. Bai Zhou looked out of the doorway and remarked, \u201cHey! It\u2019s raining.\u201dJi Fanyin suddenly remembered that there was indeed one thing she had forgotten, so she turned around and reminded him, \u201cRight, the windows of the study room are still open. Remember to close them.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll send you home,\u201d said Bai Zhou as he took an umbrella from the stand beside the doorway.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that,\u201d Ji Fanyin refused the offer coolly with a wave of her hand. She pressed the button for the lift. \u201cI\u2019m not heading home yet.\u201dBai Zhou froze up. \u201cWhere are you heading to?\u201dJi Fanyin glanced at her phone as she replied, \u201cRushing to my next appointment.\u201dAn hour should be enough for me to rush to the meeting location with Song Shiyu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Without waiting for his response, she had already lowered her head to hail a cab on her phone.She reckoned that there weren\u2019t too many residents living in this apartment. Most of the buyers probably bought the property for investment purposes, or else the lift wouldn\u2019t arrive so quickly every single time.The apartment caretaker, whose desk was located on the bottom floor, was already familiar with Ji Fanyin by this point. Upon seeing her walking out of the elevator, she quickly walked over with an umbrella in hand. \u201cHeading back?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Ji Fanyin stowed her phone into her pocket and thanked her. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. The cab will be driving in.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to toss your trash away?\u201d The caretaker pointed to the bags Ji Fanyin was carrying as she asked with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you over. It\u2019s just a short distance away anyway.\u201dThe caretaker\u2019s black umbrella was large enough to shelter the two of them from the rain. Ji Fanyin\u2019s shoulders didn\u2019t get drenched in the least.By the time she returned, her cab was already waiting by the entrance.The caretaker escorted Ji Fanyin to the car and bowed slightly. \u201cBye bye.\u201d\u201cBye bye.\u201d Ji Fanyin figured that the caretaker\u2019s salary must have been quite substantial.Before she closed the car doors, she sensed a gaze on her and glanced upward at the apartment, but she couldn\u2019t spot anyone at all.The cab drove out of the condominium. Ji Fanyin relaxedly leaned back on the leather seat and started checking her phone notifications.Ever since their trip to Disneyland, Bai Zhou\u2019s first reaction upon meeting Ji Fanyin was to power off her phone. His expression looked a little gleeful whenever he did it.It was just a single call, and Bai Zhou continues holding a grudge toward Song Shiyu to this day.There was a recommendation from her bank\u2019s finance manager, a reminder from her video streaming application that a new movie was about to hit the theaters, a call from a telemarketer\u2026 as well as a call from Cen Xiangyang.Ji Fanyin raised her eyebrows as she returned the call. \u201cDirector Cen.\u201d\u201cBusy?\u201d Cen Xiangyang\u2019s voice sounded a little amorous. A woman\u2019s chuckle could vaguely be heard in the background.\u201cQuite,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin candidly. \u201cI would appreciate it if you could get straight to the point.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve looked through what you sent me,\u201d said Cen Xiangyang. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can\u2019t afford your prices, but what\u2019s more important is whether you\u2019re worth the price or not. I have something on tomorrow, so what do you think about meeting the day after tomorrow?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not free the day after tomorrow.\u201d\u201cFriday?\u201d\u201cFriday too.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Sunday?\u201d\u201cSunday is also not convenient for me.\u201d Ji Fanyin decided to get straight to the point. \u201cI won\u2019t be free for the whole of next week. Why don\u2019t you make a reservation after I come back?\u201dCen Xiangyang laughed with a deep voice and asked, \u201cDo you still want to do this business or not, Ji Fanyin?\u201dHe spoke her name with slurred pronunciation, seemingly not wanting his company to hear it. Ji Fanyin wouldn\u2019t have understood it if not for the fact that it was her own name.Ji Fanyin looked at the receding scenery outside the car windows as she returned the question to him, \u201cCen Xiangyang, the real question here is whether you still want to do this business or not.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d Cen Xiangyang didn\u2019t sound too angered by Ji Fanyin\u2019s response. \u201cI\u2019ll transfer the money to your account as an advance reservation. Call me once you\u2019re done with your work. This should be fine, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll send you the questionnaire shortly later.\u2019\u201c\u2026 Questionnaire?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s very important in ensuring service quality, so make sure that you answer it carefully.\u201dJi Fanyin felt that Cen Xiangyang wasn\u2019t a good customer. She had to repeat every instruction twice for him.Forget it, it\u2019ll be more troublesome if I receive a complaint. While I reserve the right of final interpretation, it\u2019ll still be a hassle to deal with it.Cen Xiangyang was still in a state of disbelief. \u201cYou have a questionnaire?\u201d\u201cI do. It\u2019s extremely important. You\u2019ll understand once you see it.\u201dIt would be far more efficient to show him it instead of trying to explain it to him over the phone, so she hung up the call and sent the questionnaire to his email.Cen Xiangyang quickly checked on it before sending her an ellipsis: \u3010\u2026\u3011Ji Fanyin replied to his expression of speechlessness: \u3010Make sure you answer the questions earnestly\u3011She proceeded to pull Cen Xiangyang into her \u2018Client\u2019 contact group. Then, she glanced at the GPS and saw that she was 28 minutes away from her destination.So, she leaned back on the leather seat once more and tried to gather everything she knew about Cen Xiangyang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was showcased in an overseas film festival and received the Best Newcomer Award.Cen Xiangyang\u2019s family was actually strongly opposed to him studying filmmaking. They even went to the extent of cutting off financial support so as to pressure him.However, Cen Xiangyang refused to give in. Through his effort, he managed to make a place for himself in the filmmaking scene as a director. He was currently in the midst of preparing for his first commercial film, and many investors bore great expectations for him.If possible, Ji Fanyin would want to invest in Cen Xiangyang\u2019s movie too.She did know which of his movies were a big hit, after all.The only problem was that he was so hot at the moment that it was unlikely that he would suffer from a lack of funds.As for Cen Xiangyang\u2019s character, Ji Fanyin did try to analyze it before.If Bai Zhou and Song Shiyu\u2019s personalities were the results of their upbringing, Cen Xiangyang was the direct opposite. He was born with his twisted nature.Even his love was twisted and incomprehensible.To make an analogy, when an average person saw a beautiful blooming flower on the streetside, he might snap a photo to remember it or water it. But Cen Xiangyang would uproot the entire flower and plant it in his own home. If the flower were to accidentally die due to his violent treatment of it, he would simply shrug it off and look for a new one.I really wonder what Ji Xinxin was thinking when she decided to date this psychopath. Taming wild beasts might be an exciting challenge, but it\u2019s not something that just anyone can take on.Ji Fanyin was quite curious about the answers in Cen Xiangyang\u2019s questionnaire.Most of the questions there were about the client\u2019s impressions and expectations of Ji Xinxin so that Ji Fanyin could tailor her acting to suit the client\u2019s needs.Through Cen Xiangyang\u2019s questionnaire, Ji Fanyin would be able to get an insight into the kind of mask that Ji Xinxin wore before him.While Ji Fanyin\u2019s mind was still occupied with all sorts of miscellaneous thoughts, the vibration from her phone\u2019s GPS reminded her that she was already in the vicinity of her destination. She snapped out of her thoughts and opened her eyes.Song Shiyu had made his reservation at a bar located on the first floor of an upscale shopping mall. The bar had classy decor with music playing off a turntable. It had dim yellowish lighting that only allowed one to see the faces of those sharing a table, granting its customers a high level of confidentiality.No wonder Song Shiyu would choose this place.After reporting the table number, the waiter led Ji Fanyin to a table, where Song Shiyu had already started drinking.A woman dressed in a black bareback dress was currently chatting him up with a wine glass in hand. They were so close that it looked like their silhouettes were stuck together.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m waiting for someone,\u201d Song Shiyu politely turned down the woman\u2019s advancement. He happened to catch sight of the approaching Ji Fanyin, and his expression immediately loosened up. He raised his hand to gesture her over. \u201cOver here.\u201dJi Fanyin walked over. She smiled at the woman, who was visibly leaning toward Song Shiyu, and said, \u201cThere are a lot of men here, so why don\u2019t you pick another one? There\u2019s already someone living in the heart of this man.\u201dThe woman replied with a smile, \u201cPardon me, I thought he was single\u2026 I won\u2019t interrupt the two of you any longer.\u201dShe picked up her own wine glass and strutted away. Her eyes brushed across Ji Fanyin with a meaningful gleam in her eyes, carrying a hint of intoxication and provocative seduction.Her intent was not lost on Ji Fanyin, but the latter held it in due to her professionalism.\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d Song Shiyu subconsciously glanced at his watch before slightly frowning. \u201c\u2026 What were you busy with earlier?\u201d\u201cSome minor stuff. The traffic wasn\u2019t too good either. Have you been waiting long for me?\u201d Ji Fanyin skillfully dodged his question.Song Shiyu had only reserved two hours this time around, but every cent counts. When she realized that she could make it for this appointment, she thought that she might as well go for it since she was already outside, so she agreed to it.She thought that Song Shiyu had something to say to her, but the two hours ended up passing them by amidst casual chatter and light sips of wine.It was only when Song Shiyu got the bill and Ji Fanyin rose to her feet that she finally heard a question that he seemed to have been building up for a very long time. \u201cWhen did you start liking me?\u201dThe countdown timer hadn\u2019t rung yet.Ji Fanyin pondered for a moment before answering skillfully, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you have been by my side all along. It was at some point in time that I suddenly realized that my feelings for you are different, just that I didn\u2019t think that it was love back then.\u201dSong Shiyu picked up his coat and quietly looked at Ji Fanyin, not saying a word at all.After a ten seconds exchange of gazes, the countdown timer finally rang.Ji Fanyin reined in her sweet business smile as she raised her phone to switch off the timer.Song Shiyu posed the same question for the second time, \u201cJi Fanyin, when did you start liking me? Why did you like me?\u201dJi Fanyin swiped her finger across the screen to silence the timer before glancing at Song Shiyu. \u201cYou seem very concerned about it?\u201dShe started chuckling without waiting for Song Shiyu\u2019s response.\u201cBut is there any meaning in knowing the answer? My feelings for you are already a thing of the past.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019 you want to talk to is already dead.\u201dShe really is. The current Ji Fanyin has never felt even the slightest ounce of attraction toward Song Shiyu.\u201cWhat do you want to talk about? Why I liked you? When I liked you? How I liked you?\u201d Ji Fanyin shook her head before continuing on, \u201cThat\u2019s no more than a whimsical turn of fate. What comes on a whim goes on a whim. Is it that surprising that my feelings for you have moved on?\u201dThose words were spoken so lightly, yet they viciously plunged into Song Shiyu\u2019s chest like razor-sharp blades.\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re trying to tell me that you have moved on to Bai Zhou or that basketball brat?\u201d asked Song Shiyu with a deep voice. \u201cYour feelings sure are cheap.\u201dUnfazed by Song Shiyu\u2019s evaluation, she laughed softly and replied, \u201cThey sure are. That\u2019s just how heartless women are at times.\u201dWith a casual wave of goodbye, she turned around and was just about to take her leave when she was reminded of another issue. So, she turned back to Song Shiyu and said, \u201cOh right, there\u2019s one more thing.\u201dSong Shiyu looked at her with eyes that looked even deeper than the abyss, quietly waiting for her to continue.\u201cYou should inform me in advance if you\u2019re going to get a fianc\u00e9e,\u201d reminded Ji Fanyin. \u201cOtherwise, it might result in your loss.\u201dShe wouldn\u2019t want to continue this business transaction if the blind date between Song Shiyu and Chen Yunshan went well and the two of them moved on to talks of marriage. There was a vast difference between Chen Yunshan and Ji Xinxin here.After hearing Ji Fanyin\u2019s words, Song Shiyu suddenly burst into laughter and said, \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s just the jealousy speaking in the end.\u201dJi Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201dMen can be more delusional than women at times.Song Shiyu\u2019s mood visibly lifted within moments. He draped his coat on his arm and began making his way out of the bar. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll send you home.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother. I\u2019ll grab a cab,\u201d Ji Fanyin rejected him without any hesitation.She could tell from Song Shiyu\u2019s smile that he was intending to say something more, so she decided to shut him up with a change of topic. \u201cMy little sister is coming back around Christmas.\u201dAs expected, the smile on Song Shiyu\u2019s face immediately froze up.Ji Fanyin perfunctorily waved her hand at him and said, \u201cRather than wasting your time on meaningless questions like whether I like you or not, why don\u2019t you put more thought into dealing with your love rivals?\u201dYou do know that there\u2019ll be more rivals for you to deal with after her expansion project in France, right? She might even bring someone back with her.On her way home, Ji Fanyin rested her chin on her arm and pondered over this issue. On second thought, she thought that the likelihood of that happening was low.In her memories of the \u2018future\u2019, Ji Xinxin had only returned to the country twice while she was studying abroad, and those were during the longer summer break. She shouldn\u2019t have returned for this winter break.But again, considering the massive changes that had occurred in \u2018Ji Fanyin\u2019, it was only normal for the future to be changed too. After all, Ji Fanyin had no intention of being imprisoned and dying because of some non-recyclable trash.\u2026Song Shiyu thought that Ji Fanyin was just putting on a strong front.But somehow, he didn\u2019t think that her strong front was off putting. On the contrary, it gave him a gratifying sense of superiority.Ji Fanyin had become more charming, confident, and competent than before, but she was still concerned about how his matchmaking with someone else went.He took a puff of smoke as he watched Ji Fanyin getting into a cab. Her slender silhouette and powerful disposition made her stand out right away in a crowd, reminiscent of a swan among ducks.Song Shiyu put out the cigarette before dropping a call to his chauffeur, who was already waiting on standby in the vicinity.Upon getting into the car, the chauffeur asked him if he was returning straight to his apartment. Song Shiyu shook his head and replied, \u201cDrive me to Cartier first.\u201dMost high-end luxury brands provided private customization service, but it was usually limited to only their VIP customers. The average customer would only be able to purchase their standard products.However, Song Shiyu had been frequently meeting with the designers of renowned brands thanks to his mother, so he had a deep understanding of the various brands. When he came of age and developed his own preferences, those brands would occasionally contact him and offer delivery-to-doorstep services.In fact, even with the new line of upcoming accessories that Ji Xinxin told him about the other day, he had already received an internal catalogue on it quite some time ago. If he really wanted any of them, he would have already placed an order and had it delivered straight to his place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He directed a nod at her before walking into the store. \u201cI wanted to get a replacement for a bracelet I misplaced, as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cIt might be difficult to find a replacement for a custom made or limited edition accessory right away,\u201d replied the store manager worriedly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d replied Song Shiyu as he looked around for the bracelet display counter. \u201cThere was a woman\u2019s set that I bought from your store a while back that came with a bracelet, I believe?\u201d\u201cYes, I was the one who put together the set.\u201d The store manager heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cDid the lady misplace the bracelet? Fortunately, we still have stock left. I\u2019ll bring it over now.\u201d\u201cI want the matching couple bracelet for that,\u201d said Song Shiyu.The store manager was surprised to hear that. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have made that purchase\u2026\u201d\u201cSomeone else gave it to me,\u201d replied Song Shiyu with a smile. \u201cIt was a heartfelt gift, so it\u2019s a little embarrassing for me to have lost it.\u201dThe store manager nodded understandingly. \u201cPlease wait here. I\u2019ll retrieve it for you.\u201dIt didn\u2019t take her long to return with a felted accessory box containing a new bracelet that looked identical to the one Song Shiyu had smashed and lost.It had an elegant and toned-down design that didn\u2019t look too out of place even on a man\u2019s wrist.Song Shiyu had no plans of wearing it, but he still happily footed the bill for it.The store manager placed the accessory box into a bag and handed it into Song Shiyu\u2019s hands with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful gift. She has definitely put a lot of thought into it.\u201dSong Shiyu\u2019s movement jerked to a halt. \u201cShe did?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this a return gift from the woman who received your bracelet? She took the trouble to buy the matching couple bracelet for you,\u201d replied the store manager.\u201c\u2026\u201d Song Shiyu lowered his head and fell silent for a while. By the time he raised his head once more, there was already an impeccable smile on his face. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right. She has truly put a lot of thought into this gift.\u201d\u2026Ji Fanyin was intending to give herself a day off to catch up on her movies and pack her luggage the day before the business trip.My reservation with Cen Xiangyang has been postponed to a week later, Song Shiyu has just gotten his pride wounded, and there\u2019s no reason for Bai Zhou to make a reservation when we\u2019re going on a trip for an entire week soon\u2026Her thoughts were cut short by her ringtone.Ji Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe picked up her phone to take a look. It was from Bai Zhou.She picked up the call, and Bai Zhou immediately spoke up, \u201cGive me your passport number.\u201dJi Fanyin thought that the trip would be within the country, so she was taken aback when he mentioned the word \u2018passport\u2019. \u201cWhere are we going tomorrow?\u201d\u201cGreece,\u201d replied Bai Zhou with a matter-of-factly tone.Ji Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI can handle the visa myself.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to make it in time. I can deal with it faster.\u201dAs a moderner who was no stranger to all sorts of fraud tactics, Ji Fanyin was extremely reluctant to entrust an important document to the hands of someone whom she couldn\u2019t trust.She quickly got onto her laptop and looked up the information she needed to apply for a visa and the additional price required to hasten the process. \u201cI\u2019ll call you back.\u201d\u201cHey\u2015\u201dJi Fanyin hung up the phone. She quickly found a tourist agency online and called them up to request for a 24-hours quick processing service.Luckily it\u2019s still early in the morning, so 24 hours should be more than enough.After receiving a guarantee that she would receive her visa within 24 hours, Ji Fanyin heaved a sigh of relief and called Bai Zhou back. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there tomorrow with my visa..\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Bai Zhou was stunned for a moment before cursing out angrily. \u201cWhat do you mean by that? You can\u2019t even trust me with your passport?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s one reason.\u201d Ji Fanyin began thinking on the spot to weave up an excuse. \u201cI don\u2019t want to show anyone my ugly passport photo. Besides, weren\u2019t you the one who doesn\u2019t want anyone to know that we\u2019re going abroad together?\u201dBai Zhou thought that her excuse sounded reasonable. He snorted in irritation and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t make it in time\u2026\u201d\u201cThe liability will be on me. I\u2019ll refund you,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with an anguished heart.Bai Zhou sneered, \u201cDo I look like I lack money?\u201dWith that, the proud young master Bai hung up Ji Fanyin\u2019s call.Glad to have this matter out of the way, Ji Fanyin was about to grab her passport and snap a photo of it when she suddenly received a message.It was from Bai Zhou. He had sent a picture over.Tapping into it, she was immediately confronted by a picture of Bai Zhou\u2019s passport.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe had snapped the picture rather casually, such that his finger could be seen at the very bottom. All of the crucial personal information on his passport was exposed in the photo.It was quickly followed up with a message: \u3010The passport photo only looks ugly when the person is ugly\u3011To put it nicely, \u2018men retain their inner child till death\u2019, though Ji Fanyin thought that it would be more fitting to say that he had the EQ of a three-year-old.It\u2019s a waste of life to argue with him over such things.WIth a sigh, Ji Fanyin flipped open her passport to snap photos of it, only to notice something.Oh? It looks like my birthday is three days from now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was usually her assistant who helped her pack her luggage, but she did learn a thing or two from watching her. It didn\u2019t take her long to fill up her suitcase with a week\u2019s worth of luggage and a small pouch of necessities.On top of the usual emergency medicine, she didn\u2019t forget to pack her pepper spray and self-protection tools.The following morning, Ji Fanyin took a cab to the tourist agency to collect her visa. When she arrived at the airport, she thought that she would have to find her way around with her boarding pass, but to her surprise, Bai Zhou called her and told her to head to Gate 13.She thought that there would be an assistant or butler there to guide her around, but after waiting there for several minutes and rejecting two kind-hearted people who offered to guide her, she found herself faced with an armored \u2018low-profile individual\u2019.When he first walked over, she thought that it was another person who had come to offer his help and was going to turn him down, but she quickly noticed that his eyes looked a little familiar.His face was covered with a black baseball cap and a black mask. There was a black duffel bag slung over his shoulder. With his tall and proportionate stature, he looked like a celebrity who was sneaking off somewhere.Who else could it be other than Bai Zhou?Ji Fanyin calmly propped up her sunglasses and said, \u201cI can get there myself.\u201dBai Zhou pretended like he couldn\u2019t hear her words. He gestured with his chin and said, \u201cFollow me.\u201dHe started walking off, and the direction he was heading to didn\u2019t seem to be where the self check-in machines were.Ji Fanyin followed him with her suitcase in hand, making sure to keep a distance of several meters between them so as to give off the impression that they were two strangers who happened to be heading in the same direction.As they walked on and on, Bai Zhou suddenly stopped and turned around to look at her.The distance between them was enough to stuff an average bus in.Even from several meters away, Ji Fanyin could clearly hear Bai Zhou\u2019s annoyed tongue click.However, he didn\u2019t say a single word. He maneuvered his way through the busy crowd in the airport and finally arrived at a remote entrance.Ji Fanyin glanced at the signpost beside the entrance. It was the VIP gate that was reserved for a privileged few.While Bai Zhou was walking through the gate, he gestured toward Ji Fanyin with his chin and told the air stewardess, \u201cShe\u2019s with me.\u201dJi Fanyin was starting to doubt her own memory, so she spent two seconds recalling the conversation she had two days back.She was certain that Bai Zhou had told her that this trip was to be kept confidential, and no one should find out about it.Given how \u2018secretive\u2019 he\u2019s being, I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t be long before the whole world finds out about it. I guess I should be relieved that there are no paparazzi keeping a constant eye on young master Bai\u2019s movements.As Ji Fanyin walked through the VIP gate, she noticed that the air stewardess was staring intently at her, so she turned her head over quizzically. The air stewardess realized that she had been staring too hard, so she smiled in embarrassment and explained, \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve made you feel uncomfortable. I\u2019m just a little surprised since this is the first time that Mr Bai is bringing someone onto his private jet.\u201dPrivate jet.Ji Fanyin knew that the Bai Family and Bai Zhou were extremely wealthy\u2014it was clear from the branded motorcycles he rode and the exorbitant penthouse he lived in. However, she was only starting to get a grasp on just how rich they were.Well, it\u2019s normal for the ultra wealthy to have a private jet or two, right?This wasn\u2019t the first time Ji Fanyin was riding on a private jet, so she didn\u2019t make a fuss about it. Once she settled into her seat, she whipped out her phone and began scrolling through Weibo to pass time.I can slack off a little since it isn\u2019t working hours yet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He harrumphed disdainfully. \u201cWeibo? So you\u2019re the kind of person who talks to herself online?\u201dHe tapped into Ji Fanyin\u2019s main page, only to fall silent upon seeing her nearly seven-figure followers.\u201cYou could say that,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with a mocking smile.Bai Zhou fiddled with Ji Fanyin\u2019s phone for a while longer before he powered it off and tossed it back to her.When Ji Fanyin received her phone back, it was already counting down to the shutdown. She noticed that there was an additional post on her Weibo page, saying: \u3010Going into seclusion. Do not disturb\u3011Her number of \u2018following\u2019 also appeared to have increased by one.Ji Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe made up her mind to unfollow Bai Zhou once she had time to herself later at night.\u201cWhat? Is there a problem?\u201d Bai Zhou saw Ji Fanyin\u2019s expression and lashed out angrily, \u201cI am your client! Can\u2019t I request anything from you?\u201d\u201cYou can make requests of me, but I have the right to reject them too,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin calmly. \u201cI draw a clear line between my work and my personal life. I\u2019ve told you that before, do you remember?\u201dBai Zhou was stifled by her response. He shot a piercing glance at the clock.However, Ji Fanyin was even faster than him. \u201cTwo more minutes. You don\u2019t need to remind me.\u201dBai Zhou was silent for a while before a gleeful smile formed on his lips, seemingly having found another angle to launch a counterattack. \u201cDoes that mean that you\u2019ll accept my request as long as it\u2019s work related?\u201d\u201cYou can say so,\u201d Ji Fanyin calmly replied with a nod. \u201cI\u2019ll try to realize it as long as your request is reasonable and the two of us have mutual understanding on it.\u201dBai Zhou crossed his arms and said, \u201cI want to see you cry.\u201dJi Fanyin lowered her head contemplatively for a moment before earnestly asking him, \u201cDo you have sadistic inclinations?\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d Bai Zhou roared furiously in response. \u201cI\u2019m not a pervert!\u201dJi Fanyin nodded in agreement. \u201cYes, you aren\u2019t the perverted one.\u201dThe perverted one is Cen Xiangyang.\u201c\u2026 You take on perverted clients too?\u201d asked Bai Zhou incredulously. \u201cFirst, Song Shiyu, and now a sadist. Ji Fanyin, don\u2019t you think that there\u2019s a huge problem with your choice of clients?\u201dJi Fanyin looked at the completely self-unaware Client No.2 and remarked, \u201cI do. You left out \u2018grump\u2019.\u201dBai Zhou\u2019s face darkened. \u201cRepeat that again.\u201dThe clock happened to strike twelve then.Ji Fanyin\u2019s transformation was instantaneous. A gentle smile formed on her face as she said, \u201cI said that our Zhouzhou is adorable.\u201dBai Zhou: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe subconsciously glanced at the clock.\u201cThere\u2019s no one more adorable than you. Adorable, but suave at the same time,\u201d Ji Fanyin flattered Bai Zhou without the slightest hint of awkwardness in her voice. \u201cOne of a kind. No one can compare with you.\u201d\u201cEven Song Shiyu?\u201d Bai Zhou wanted to put her in a spot.Ji Fanyin burst into laughter. \u201cSong Shiyu is nothing more than a friend to me. He\u2019s nowhere close to being as important as you are to me, alright?\u201dBai Zhou turned his head quietly. He slipped his hands into his pocket as if he was trying to hide his own emotions.

Nevertheless, the weather was wonderful and the change of pace from being in a foreign land felt refreshing.\u2026 if only I wasn\u2019t here for work.They weren\u2019t staying in a hotel but a vacation villa of the Bai Family. There were housekeepers here that carefully maintained the villa while they were away so that they could visit it once in a blue moon to take a break.This was extravagance at its finest, but to some, it was no more than their daily life.Bai Zhou seemed to have forgotten about all of the unhappiness that had transpired in the plane the moment he set foot on Greek soil. As soon as they arrived at the villa, he tossed his luggage aside and exclaimed with an excited smile, \u201cBig sis, follow me! I\u2019ll show you somewhere cool!\u201dJi Fanyin took a look around the villa as she asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep a wink on the plane earlier. Don\u2019t you want to rest first?\u201dConsidering how it was barely dawn when they landed, they ought to have a good sleep first to adjust to the jetlag.\u201cI\u2019m not tired.\u201d Bai Zhou excitedly grabbed the bundle of keys atop the shoe rack and urged Ji Fanyin energetically, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll show you why I love this place.\u201dTo be honest, Ji Fanyin was exhausted at the moment. She wasn\u2019t good with planes.However, there was no other choice since her client was so energetic. She pushed her luggage into the villa and followed Bai Zhou outside with a helpless smile.She was welcomed with a sea breeze the moment she walked out of the door. October\u2019s Santorini was usually around 20\u00b0C or so, the perfect temperature for her.Bai Zhou\u2019s villa was located at the highest point of the island, granting them a good view of the city and the deep blue Aegean Sea. It was just a pity that the scenery was impeded by the mist lingering above the sea.Bai Zhou did a quick search around the doorway before pulling out a bicycle that someone else had prepared beforehand. He patted the back seat and said, \u201cI\u2019ll cycle you there.\u201dJi Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201dI think that it has been a decade since the last time I rode on the back of someone else\u2019s bike.\u201cHurry up!\u201d Bai Zhou got onto the front seat and hurried her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be late.\u201dJi Fanyin lifted her skirt slightly and settled down on the bicycle\u2019s back seat. With a gentle but helpless tone, she reminded him, \u201cDon\u2019t go too fast.\u201dSantorini was not a place suited for large vehicles due to its rugged terrain and multitude of alleys. It was much easier to get around on a bicycle, though there was also a clear downside to it: bumpiness.Bai Zhou stepped on the pedal as he said, \u201cBig sis, if you\u2019re afraid, you can h-hold onto me tightly.\u201dHe dared not to turn around to look at her, and he even stuttered a little halfway through his words.Ji Fanyin took this opportunity to tease him, \u201cOh? Is our Zhouzhou shy?\u201dPerhaps wanting to distract himself from the embarrassment of his little slip-up, he started pedalling hard, causing the bicycle to rocket forward.It caught Ji Fanyin off guard. She had to grab the front seat tightly before she was barely able to catch her balance.\u2026 You can be certain that I\u2019ll demand compensation if I fall off this bike.Pavement in the winding alleys was uneven with small steps up and down along the way. Bai Zhou zealously charged straight ahead regardless of the obstacles that stood in his way, reminiscent of a hot-blooded protagonist.On the back seat, Ji Fanyin felt like she was sitting in a 4D movie theater, experiencing a Hollywood action movie with her own body.Two minutes was all it took for her stomach to start protesting against this act of violence.Feeling queasy, Ji Fanyin couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cHow much longer before we arrive?\u201dBai Zhou was too immersed in the liberating ride to hear her.Ji Fanyin tugged on Bai Zhou\u2019s shirt and called out, \u201cZhouzhou.\u201dBai Zhou let out an \u201cAh?\u201d as he turned around to look at her. The moment their eyes met, he suddenly pulled the brake tightly, causing the bike to screech to a halt.The force of inertia caused Ji Fanyin to lurch forward and bump into Bai Zhou\u2019s back.It was not a light bump at all. She grabbed her forehead as her eyes started to heat up and moisten due to the impact.Bai Zhou: \u201c\u2026\u201dJi Fanyin sniffled a little as she massaged her nose to alleviate the pain. \u201cI was asking you how long it\u2019d take for us to reach our destination. Why did you suddenly stop?\u201dBai Zhou\u2019s eyes swam around the place, determined not to look at Ji Fanyin\u2019s face. He murmured meekly in response, \u201cSoon.\u201d\u201cCan we go a little slower?\u201d Ji Fanyin blinked off the tears welling up in her eyes as she asked softly. \u201cI don\u2019t feel very well when we go too fast.\u201d\u201cA-alright, I\u2019ll cycle slower,\u201d replied Bai Zhou with a light cough.They resumed their journey after this short interception, but this time around, Bai Zhou cycled so slowly that it felt like they were a pair of elders hiking up a mountain. It was common sense that it was harder to maintain one\u2019s balance on a bike when cycling too slowly.The incredibly shaky ride left Ji Fanyin so vexed that she silently gave Driver Bai a 1-star review in her head.Unless absolutely necessary, I\u2019ll never ride any vehicle from this driver ever again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Within a few minutes, they arrived at a tall observation platform.The observation platform was constructed near the sea, allowing one to immerse themselves in the expansive scenery of the open sea.It wasn\u2019t hard for Ji Fanyin to figure out why Bai Zhou brought her here, considering the current time on her watch, but she still asked him about it anyway, \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d\u201cA place to watch the beginning of a new day.\u201d Bai Zhou casually parked his bicycle by the side. \u201cI used to always come here to draw whenever I vacation in Santorini. There are many places where we can watch the sunrise from, but Santorini\u2019s sunrise is the dreamiest one I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\u201cSo, you anxiously pulled me here because you wanted to share the sunrise you love with me?\u201d asked Ji Fanyin smilingly.Bai Zhou looked at her for a moment before his eyes timidly drifted away. \u201c\u2026 Mm. I hope that you\u2019ll like it too.\u201dJi Fanyin sat down on one of the benches on the observation platform and patted the empty space next to her. \u201cCome here.\u201dBai Zhou hesitantly walked over and sat down next to her. His sitting posture was restrained, unlike his usual arrogant demeanor.\u201cThere\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t like it,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with a soft chuckle. \u201cYou shared your valuable treasure with me. I\u2019ll cherish it as dearly as you do.\u201dShe figured that Ji Xinxin would also say such words when put in the same position.Bai Zhou\u2019s expression visibly relaxed upon hearing those words. He rested his back on the bench and said, \u201cWe were still a family of three when we came here for the first time, but in less than a day, the two of them had already started arguing. While they were shouting at each other, I snuck out and found this place. It happened to be sunrise then.\u201dJi Fanyin tilted her head toward him and earnestly listened to his story.\u201c\u2026 I prayed to the rising sun that they would have stopped fighting by the time I returned.\u201d Bai Zhou stared intently at the expansive sea before him as he spoke. \u201cThey really stopped fighting when I went back. They were anxiously looking for me, afraid that I'd gone missing. That was the only time I recall the two of them feeling like parents to me.\u201dJi Fanyin had never known about this, but she wasn\u2019t too surprised either.How could he be so blind as to be fooled by a woman who didn\u2019t cherish him if he hadn\u2019t suffered any trauma in his childhood?Bai Zhou should have been smart enough to see through Ji Xinxin\u2019s ploys, but Ji Xinxin was still able to blindside him.The tricks used by pickup artists could hardly be called ingenious, and they could be easily used by anyone. Whether the tricks worked or not depended not on the pickup artists themselves but their targets.A golden boundary had started forming at the distant sea horizon, a sign that the sun was about to emerge.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t need their love anyway,\u201d murmured Bai Zhou. \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone else as long as big sis is around.\u201dJi Fanyin looked at Bai Zhou and said, \u201cThe wish you made with the rising sun the other day came true, right?\u201d\u201cMm,\u201d replied Bai Zhou with a self-deprecating smile. \u201cBut I know that it\u2019s just a coincidence. I\u2019m no longer the child who believes in such things.\u201d\u201cBut I believe in it.\u201d Ji Fanyin flicked Bai Zhou\u2019s cap lightly. \u201cI also have a wish to make.\u201dWhen the first crack of sunlight shone upon the surface of the sea, imprinting a beautiful shimmer on it, Ji Fanyin clasped her hands together and began earnestly making a wish.5 billion in three years, 10 billion in five years! I\u2019ll live a carefree life once I earn enough and return home whenever I want to!When she opened her eyes, she heard Bai Zhou grumbling beside her, \u201cYou should tell me your wish instead. I\u2019ll help you realize it. I should at least be more reliable than that central air-conditioning up there\u2026\u201dJi Fanyin turned her head over and asked with a smile, \u201cYou mean it?\u201dBai Zhou was briefly stunned before he quickly nodded in response, \u201cOf course! There\u2019s no way I\u2019d lie to you, big sis.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you my wish.\u201d Ji Fanyin\u2019s eyes curled into tender crescents. \u201cI asked the sun if he could bring the young Bai Zhou, who was overjoyed when he found that his wish had been realized, to me and have him smile at me.\u201dBai Zhou\u2019s eyes dilated.With a chuckle, Ji Fanyin took off the cap that was covering half of Bai Zhou\u2019s face and ruffled his hair.\u201cSometimes, I feel like I\u2019m not doing enough for you. I can\u2019t even make you smile when you\u2019re right beside me,\u201d she said.\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d Bai Zhou blurted out.\u201cCan my wish be realized then?\u201dBai Zhou turned his head away out of awkwardness and embarrassment. There was a few seconds of silence before he cleared his throat and said, \u201cThe young Bai Zhou says \u2018Thank you, big sis\u2019.\u201dJi Fanyin: \u201c\u2026\u201dJust this once, this doltish Bai Zhou actually feels doltishly cute.\u201cI hope that I\u2019ll be able to come here every year with big sis to watch the sunrise,\u201d Bai Zhou said out of the blue.Ji Fanyin felt that his abrupt outburst reeked of a desperate attempt to change the topic, but a professional like her wouldn\u2019t be so tactless as to point it out.Ji Xinxin was supposed to be a caring and considerate person.\u201cI\u2019ll accompany you here whenever you want.\u201dIf I have spare time on hand and you pay me enough.It felt like a moment ago that they sat down next to one another on the bench, but the sun was already halfway up the sky.Ji Fanyin was starting to regret not bringing her sunglasses out with her when Bai Zhou suddenly asked, \u201cThere\u2019s one thing that I\u2019d like to ask big sis.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cBig sis, you rejected Song Shiyu because you don\u2019t like him, right?\u201d asked Bai Zhou.\u201cYou were there that day too,\u201d replied Ji Fanyin with a helpless sigh. \u201cShiyu is just a friend to me.\u201dBai Zhou turned his head over and stared at her intently. \u201cI want big sis to become my girlfriend.\u201dJi Fanyin turned her head over in astonishment, causing their eyes to meet one another. The rising sun cast a golden glow on Bai Zhou\u2019s cheek.\u201cI\u2019ve made my wish to the rising sun\u2026 Is there any chance that my wish can be realized?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
