    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1Early in the morning, at the back mountain of the Profound Sword Sect.4Xuan Yi\u2019s white robe fluttered in the wind as he stood at the peak of the mountain. His long black hair fluttered in the wind as he stared at the mountain in front of him. Covered by the fog, it looked like a fairyland.5White cranes soared above his head and the chirping of flying insects could be heard. Everything was covered in white fog.3\u201cIt\u2019s been three years\u2026 It\u2019s been three years since I came to the Tian Xuan Land! It\u2019s time for the Profound Sword Sect to start the Sword Worship Assembly again.\u201d4Xuan Yi raised his head to look at the sky and recalled the time when he first came to the Tian Xuan Land.3He had transmigrated from Earth and came to a xianxia world where demon beasts ran rampant, sects stood in great numbers, and all races mixed together.6This was a xianxia world called the Tian Xuan Land.6It was a xianxia world where cultivators sought immortality; hot-blooded and unfettered, they stepped on lotuses and waves to cleanse their mortal bones and cultivate their holy souls!1There were cultivators who traveled in the sky on long swords!2There were huge demon beasts that were as tall as mountains and could wipe out an entire city in the blink of an eye!2There were also countless powerful sects guarding the habitat of the human race!3Countless geniuses sought immortality in this world.1Powerful masters guarded and protected the land.1Xuan Yi\u2019s Profound Sword sect was one of the top 100 sects in the southern domain of the Tian Xuan Land. It was also known as the Sect of Slaughter!4The Profound Sword Sect controlled nearly a thousand cities in the southern domain! It had a population of over ten billion people.Of these ten billion people, all of them fought to join the Profound Sword Sect.Every time there was news of the sect recruiting disciples, it would cause a huge commotion.There were even some important figures in the cities who were willing to offer countless treasures just to get a spot in the sect.In this chaotic world, everyone longed to enter a powerful sect and find a way to become stronger! They longed to walk the path of immortality!Joining the Profound Sword Sect was undoubtedly the best option, because the sect had thousands of years of history and had a powerful background.The Sword Worship Assembly was held every three years to select outstanding disciples for special training.And he, Xuan Yi\u2026Three years ago, when he had just transmigrated, he was still a servant disciple of the Profound Sword Sect. He was only a disciple of the sixth level of the Qi Condensation Realm.17In the Tian Xuan Land, the Qi Condensation Realm was the lowest level of cultivation, barely stepping on the path of immortal cultivation.Above it was the Foundation Establishment Realm. Only those who had stepped into this realm could be considered true immortal cultivators.After the Foundation Establishment Realm, there were the Golden Core Realm, the Divine Power Realm, the Law Enforcement Realm, and the Sect Master Realm\u202617Further up were the levels of great masters. They were as rare as phoenix feathers or qilin horns.3Initially, Xuan Yi, who was at the sixth level of the Qi Condensation Realm, was basically a cannon fodder in the last Sword Worship Assembly of the Profound Sword Sect.However, he later transmigrated and awakened the system!2As a transmigrator, Xuan Yi had awakened a system called Becoming Stronger after Taking in Disciples.3Right from the start, he got the strength of the first level of the Law Enforcement Realm.4In the end, Xuan Yi\u2019s strength shocked the entire Profound Sword Sect. A servant disciple actually had the strength of the Law Enforcement Realm?The sect master immediately made Xuan Yi the Law Enforcement Elder of the sect!3From then on, the legend of Xuan Yi spread throughout the Profound Sword Sect.He was the number one genius of the sect!What was even more exciting was that Xuan Yi, less than 20 years old, became the youngest Law Enforcement Elder in the sect history.One had to know that the sect elders, even those with outstanding talent, didn\u2019t break through to the Law Enforcement Realm until they were in their sixties.1Three years had passed, and Xuan Yi had completely understood the functions of the system.6It was mainly divided into two parts.First: as long as he took in disciples, his strength would increase! The more talented the disciples were, the higher strength he\u2019d get!4Second: after completing the mission given by the system, he could obtain natural treasures, immortal cultivation techniques, elixirs and miraculous medicines\u20263Back then, when he transmigrated here, he displayed the cultivation strength that the system had rewarded to him at the last Sword Worship Assembly.In the last three years, he had taken in two disciples with decent aptitude and completed some missions. His strength had improved accordingly.2Xuan Yi calmed his mind and a virtual interface appeared in his mind.Host: Xuan YiRealm: second level of the Law Enforcement RealmAptitude: ? ? (not stable, changes with the number of disciples)Identity: Profound Sword Sect\u2019s Law Enforcement ElderDisciple: Lin Yingxue [ realm: eighth level of the Foundation Establishment Realm, aptitude: 68] , Lin Hu [ realm: seventh level of the Qi Condensation Realm, aptitude: 17]12Items: Thousand-year Ice Armor, Seven Star Sword\u2026Side mission: a disciple reaching the Golden Core Realm. Mission reward: the Star Picking Technique ]1Main mission: three disciples reaching at least the Foundation Establishment Realm; mission reward: cultivation level advanced to the fifth level of the Law Enforcement Realm!The mission rewards in the mission pane were very generous.The Star Picking Technique was a divine power technique created by a super genius in the Divine Power Realm. It had a total of ten levels. After mastering it, one could pluck stars with one hand!2It was said that the super master who had created the Star Picking Technique once fought with several demon beast kings and killed them all! At this point, the Star Picking Technique occupied the nineteenth position on the Divine Power List of the Tian Xuan Land.5Any divine power or technique on the Divine Power List was craved by cultivators! Many cultivators were willing to fight to death to get a divine power.\u201cAfter training a disciple to the Golden Core Realm, I\u2019ll get the divine power Star Picking Technique. It seems that I have to work harder.\u201dHe glanced at Lin Yingxue on the attribute panel. She was the first disciple he had taken in, and her aptitude was quite good. If no one taught her, she could also advance to the Golden Core Realm by self cultivation, but at a slower pace.But now, there was a reward beckoning towards Xuan Yi. Would he sit idly by and do nothing?Just as Xuan Yi decided to pour all cultivation resources into this disciple, a woman ran over. She panted and said, \u201cMaster, the Sword Worship Assembly is about to begin. Do you want to go and take a look?\u201dXuan Yi turned his head and saw that it was his disciple, Lin Yingxue.Right now, her eyes were evasive, and her cheeks were pink.She didn\u2019t dare to look at Xuan Yi. Her master\u2019s strength was so powerful that she didn\u2019t dare to meet his eyes.2\u201cI got it. I\u2019ll be there right away,\u201d Xuan Yi replied softly.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Today was the Profound Sword Sect\u2019s triennial Sword Worship Assembly. The sect would invite all the important figures of the top 100 sects of the southern domain to come and watch.The so-called Sword Worship Assembly was, on one hand, to display the Profound Sword Sect\u2019s strength, so as to better recruit outstanding disciples into the sect.On the other hand, it was a method to select outstanding disciples inside the sect and let the Law Enforcement Elders give tips to these disciples.For these disciples, this was a grand occasion.Every time it was held, basically all the inner and outer disciples of the sect would attend.Apart from the chance to get the elders\u2019 tips, there was also a chance to gain the elders\u2019 favor and become their personal disciples.One had to know that the lowest level that the elders in the sect had was the Law Enforcement Realm.And it was the Law Enforcement Realm for sword cultivators.In the cultivation world, everyone knew that among the cultivators with the same level of cultivation strength, sword cultivators\u2019 attacking techniques were unparalleled!8If they could become the personal disciples of the sect elders, they would achieve much higher levels in the future.After all, who didn\u2019t want to ride a sword and fly all over the world?5Therefore, every Sword Worship Assembly would attract many disciples, especially the outer sect disciples since this was the only chance they could change their fate.1They hoped that the elders would take a liking to them and change their lives.Of course, most of the time, the elders would select from the inner sect disciples.But even so, for the outer sect disciples, even if there was only a sliver of a chance, it was enough to make these people extremely excited.And at this moment, the outer sect disciples were all waiting in excitement for the Sword Worship Assembly.However, there was a quarrel coming from a corner.\u201cHey, you trash, what are you looking at?\u201d A rough man with a long face shouted.4Judging from the yellow sackcloth they were wearing, one could see they were outer sect disciples.\u201cIsn\u2019t this Ma Liang? Why is he always bullying this girl?\u201d An outer sect disciple asked.\u201cDon\u2019t you know? That girl is called Bai Weiwei. She comes from the Bai Clan of New Moon City, which is under the control of the Profound Sword Sect.\u201d1\u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cHave you forgotten where Ma Liang comes from? The Earth Rock Sect.\u201d\u201cThe Earth Rock Sect and the Bai Clan are two of the three major forces in New Moon City. These two forces are enemies. It would be a miracle if these two people could get along.\u201d\u2026People began to whisper. Many of them looked as if they were enjoying a show.However, their words did not cause the slightest ripple in Bai Weiwei\u2019s eyes.Meanwhile, her friends began to worry.\u201cWeiwei, let\u2019s go, okay? If we can\u2019t afford to offend him, we can go,\u201d the round-faced girl grabbed her hand and said.Bai Weiwei stroked the girl\u2019s small hand and smiled at her. She gave the latter a reassuring smile, but a trace of worry flashed through her eyes.She had been a genius. When she entered the Profound Sword Sect five years ago, she was already at the ninth level of the Qi Condensation Realm.Although she was still half a step away from the Foundation Establishment Realm, she was already an inner sect disciple.However, three years ago, an Elder Ma appeared out of thin air in the sect and assigned a mission to her. He promised to give her a Foundation Establishment Pill after the mission ended, allowing her to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.After the mission ended, Elder Ma did give her a pill, but it wasn\u2019t a real Foundation Establishment Pill.3This was because ever since Bai Weiwei took the pill, her cultivation progress had stopped, and her level began to drop.This made her extremely anxious, but because there was no evidence to prove that it was Elder Ma\u2019s doing, she could only swallow this bitter fruit.Thus, right now, her cultivation strength was only at the fifth level of the Qi Condensation Realm.The decline in her strength also reduced her from an inner sect disciple to an outer sect disciple.She knew that if the problem of her cultivation dropping was not solved, she would not be able to cultivate.Bai Weiwei glanced at Ma Liang, who had joined the sect at the same time as she did, and a sense of powerlessness rose in her heart because she could no longer read Ma Liang\u2019s cultivation level.1And she had also received a letter from her family recently.The Earth Rock Sect and the White Bones Sect had joined forces to suppress the Bai Clan. Now, the pressure on her family was immense. She hoped that she could find a strong backer for her family in the Profound Sword Sect.15Thinking of this, Bai Weiwei felt extremely upset.1That was because even if she could cultivate, she would still be ridiculed and suppressed by Ma Liang in the outer sect. How could she find an elder to be her master?She wasn\u2019t as calm as she looked.However, Bai Weiwei\u2019s eyes lit up as she saw the four big words in front of her \u2014 the Sword Worship Assembly.That\u2019s right, this assembly was her life-saving straw.As long as she could obtain the approval of an elder, all her problems would be solved.Thus, she only said, \u201cScram!\u201dMa Liang was stunned with disbelief. Then, the look in his eyes turned into mocking.Ever since his cultivation strength had reached the ninth level of the Qi Condensation Realm, no outer sect disciples had ever dared to question him. But now Bai Weiwei actually dared to contradict him.1Ma Liang released his aura of the ninth level of the Qi Condensation Realm without holding back.The invisible aura suppressed Bai Weiwei until she couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201cHa, you piece of trash. Even the weakest elder of the sect wouldn\u2019t spare you a look. You even f*cking dare to put on airs in front of me. Do you still think you\u2019re a genius?\u201dThe outer sect disciples felt Ma Liang\u2019s aura and were shocked.\u201cOh my God, this is the aura of the peak of the ninth level of Qi Condensation Realm\u2026 could it be that the rumors about senior brother Ma are all true?\u201d\u201cWhat rumors?\u201d\u201cIt says that Ma Liang is half a step into the Foundation Establishment Realm and he is now learning from Elder Ma. He has just been appointed as his personal disciple by the elder.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really envious that he can learn from an elder. I\u2019d be happy if I could be a servant disciple of an elder.\u201d\u2026Bai Weiwei felt strangled, but she had a strong will and wouldn\u2019t show it.Her gaze was firm as she gritted her teeth and moved forward.When Ma Liang saw this, he knew that she was a stubborn woman. No matter how he suppressed her, she just wouldn\u2019t give in.He withdrew his aura and said indifferently, \u201cForget it. After I become the elder\u2019s disciple, the Earth Rock Sect\u2019s status in New Moon City will rise. Your Bai Clan will submit to us. When that time comes, let\u2019s see how arrogant you are.\u201d1Bai Weiwei was upset.2She had come out to study for years, but her strength had declined instead of rising. She had let her family down.Instead of accompanying her parents as a good daughter, she had brought enemies to her family.1Her eyes were red, and her body was trembling. However, she controlled herself and held back her tears.At this moment, several white-robed elders arrived following the sect master.The once-in-a-decade Sword Worship Assembly of the Profound Sword Sect officially began!2Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Profound Sword Sect\u2019s martial arts practice field!As the higher-ups of the sect arrived one by one, each elder caused quite a stir among the disciples.And the last figure that floated down attracted the attention of the disciples.\u201cLook, look, who is that?\u201d A disciple pointed at the white-clothed Xuan Yi and shouted.\u201cOh my God, he\u2019s so handsome. His chiseled handsome face almost blinded my eyes.\u201d\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t dare to look at him directly.\u201d\u201cWow, he\u2019s really handsome. I really want to make babies with him.\u201d A female disciple was infatuated and her eyes were full of stars.14As they exclaimed, many young girls looked at Xuan Yi with infatuation in their eyes.Seeing Xuan Yi steal the limelight, some disciples were displeased and thought that he was just a disciple who had nothing but good looks to recommend him.However, when they saw the small golden sword badge on Xuan Yi\u2019s chest, they swallowed their words, because this badge showed that the wearer was a Law Enforcement Elder.\u201cYou\u2019re new here, so you don\u2019t know Elder Xuan Yi. After all, Elder Xuan Yi usually stays in the back mountain and doesn\u2019t mind the sect\u2019s affairs. He only shows up in important occasions\u2026\u201dA senior disciple talked about Xuan Yi with respect and worship on his face.He explained, \u201cHe\u2019s the youngest elder in the history of our sect! In the last Sword Worship Assembly, he was still an outer sect disciple but displayed the power of the Law Enforcement Realm. He was directly promoted to the position of Law Enforcement Elder by the sect master!\u201d\u201cFrom an outer sect disciple to a Law Enforcement Elder? He\u2019s so awesome.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even know Elder Xuan? He\u2019s an influential figure in our sect, a genius who broke through to the Law Enforcement Realm at the age of 20!\u201d\u201cOh my God, I think this elder is probably younger than me, but he\u2019s entered the Law Enforcement Realm.\u201d\u201cElder Xuan is also very generous to his disciples. Moreover, he doesn\u2019t care you are an outer or inner sect disciple when selecting his disciples.\u201d\u201cHow do you know that? You\u2019re not Elder Xuan\u2019s disciple.\u201d\u201cAlthough I\u2019m not his disciple, during the last Sword Worship Assembly, Elder Xuan took in two outer sect disciples in a row. Moreover, he even gave one of the disciples a bottle of Foundation Establishment Pills,\u201d the pockmarked disciple said enviously, \u201cI\u2019m not spouting nonsense. I heard it from his disciple, Lin Yingxue, when she broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.\u201dHiss!People gasped.Foundation Establishment Pills! As others fought over resources, Xuan Yi had actually given such a precious item to his disciple, and it was a full bottle of it!One had to know that this Foundation Establishment Pill was not an ordinary pill.This kind of pill could increase the probability of a cultivator breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm from the Qi Condensation Realm. It was a best-seller everywhere.While other elders treated the pills like a treasure, Elder Xuan gave his disciple a bottle of them as if he was giving out snacks.\u201cReally? That\u2019s incredible.\u201d Many disciples looked at Xuan Yi with admiration.After all, in the cultivation world, good resources would speed up the cultivation leveling.Who wouldn\u2019t want learn from a generous master?However, there were also disciples who were doubtful.\u201cSo generous? Could Elder Xuan be the son of the sect master?\u201d A disciple asked suspiciously.\u201cImpossible! Elder Xuan is a legend in our outer sect. You should not spread lies!\u201d A disciple\u2019s eyes were filled with madness. She clenched her fists and looked as if she would start a fight.\u201cYes, that\u2019s absolutely impossible. Our sect master has already lived for hundreds of years. How could he have such a young and powerful son? Even a genetic mutation can\u2019t explain it,\u201d a female disciple said gently, \u201cI\u2019d die to have the opportunity to learn from Elder Xuan.\u201d5\u201cHumph, Elder Xuan is mine. Don\u2019t fight with me if you cherish our friendship.\u201d\u201cAh, Elder Xuan looked at me just now. I can\u2019t take it anymore. I think I\u2019m falling in love\u2026\u201d\u2026Xuan Yi sat quietly in the armchair. He didn\u2019t know that his casual glance just now had caused a bunch of female disciples to crazily argue.Of course, his casual glance had allowed him to discover a good disciple.\u201cEh? Not bad. She\u2019s actually got the Supreme Yin Physique. In the entire southern domain, it\u2019s an extremely rare but excellent physique for cultivation. However, she\u2019s injured and thus can not bring out the power of the Supreme Yin Physique. I can think of a way to resolve it. However\u2026 let\u2019s wait and see\u2026\u201d6Xuan Yi did not immediately take in the disciple. After all, he must find out the disciple\u2019s character before taking her in.6If a disciple\u2019s character was not good and had done something to hurt people, Xuan Yi would kill her without hesitation!7And at this moment, the Sword Worship Assembly was about to begin!Sitting beside Xuan Yi was the master of the Profound Sword Sect, Qing Xuzi.Dressed in a silver-white long robe, Qing Xuzi was looking at the void not far away with a smile.After a while, he stood up and said to the void, \u201cSince my old friend from the Heaven Array Sect is here, let\u2019s have a chat!\u201d\u201cHahaha, you\u2019re indeed the unrivalled sect master of sword cultivators. My small void teleportation technique can\u2019t escape your eyes.\u201d2A voice came from the void.Everyone was shocked as the void was torn apart bit by bit.A middle-aged man in a black robe walked out. He stood in the sky above the martial arts practice field, and the array patterns under his feet were continuously condensing!The person was the sect master of the Heaven Array Sect, Li Changqing.Behind him was a young girl. The young girl\u2019s eyes were cold with arrogance. After all, being the personal disciple of the sect master of the Heaven Array Sect was the proudest thing for her.\u201cSect Master Li, you\u2019re too modest. Who doesn\u2019t know that your array techniques are incomparable? Back then, when you were still at the Foundation Establishment Realm, you could already conceal yourself among the Golden Core Realm masters. After so many years, I\u2019m afraid that your strength has become even more powerful,\u201d Qing Xuzi flattered Li Changqing.\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201dHearing the flattery, Li Changqing was very pleased.Although his cultivation level was at the peak stage of the ninth level of the Law Enforcement Realm, which was slightly lower than that of Qing Xuzi\u2019s Sect Leader Realm, he could make up for the difference with his array skills.2Therefore, the two of them were almost equal in cultivation strength.3Xuan Yi did not pay much attention to the flatteries between the two of them.Just as Xuan Yi closed his eyes to check if there were any other disciples with good aptitude, a clear voice came from underground.\u201cHumph! Old Ghost Li, if I didn\u2019t see an interesting demonic beast and fight with it for a moment, I would have arrived earlier than you did!\u201dThen, there was a bang.A five-meter-wide hole appeared in the ground.A dark-faced man sat on a green python which was dozens of meters long. He had an orange-yellow demonic core in his hand.What was shocking was that this man called Wang Ye was half step into the Sect Master Realm!6The spirit python beneath him even had the strength of the first level of Law Enforcement Realm!After landing on the ground, the dark-faced man silently handed the demonic core to the young man behind him.Although the young man had been smiling as he looked at his surroundings, he did not conceal his arrogance.2After all, he was the personal disciple of the Myriad Beast Sect Master and could communicate with the spirit python beneath his feet temporarily through a secret technique and a high grade demonic core.When Li Changqing heard this person\u2019s words, not only was he not angry, but he even laughed and said, \u201cDaoist brother, your strength has improved again? That demonic core came from a great demon at the fifth level of the Law Enforcement Realm, right?\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Wang Ye laughed heartily. Although he did not reply, his hearty laughter gave the affirmative answer.\u201cFellow Daoist Qing Xuzi! I\u2019m not late, am I?\u201d Outside the martial arts practice field, the sect master of the Pill Sect flew over in the form of a streak of light.1Before Qing Xuzi could reply, several more streaks of light flew across the sky from afar!They were all powerful forces from the top 100 sects of the southern domain, including the Black-white College and the Hundred Flower Valley\u20262When Qing Xuzi saw that the people who came were all sect masters and their outstanding disciples, he frowned slightly.Like the Profound Sword Sect, these great sects were among the top 100 great sects of the southern domain.Why do they come to my Sword Worship Assembly with their best disciples? Do they think my sect can\u2019t train disciples and come to allure the disciples from my Profound Sword Sect?If that is the case, it will reflect badly on the sword sects.However\u2026 If they think so little of my Profound Sword Sect, they will get a big surprise!Qing Xuzi glanced at Xuan Yi who was leisurely looking around sitting in the armchair.Xuan Yi was in his early twenties but had the strength of the Law Enforcement Realm!Such a genius was very rare in the entire Tian Xuan Land!2Qing Xuzi slowly walked up to Xuan Yi.He said, \u201cElder Xuan Yi, I\u2019ll have to trouble you to preside over the Sword Worship Assembly.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s too much trouble for me,\u201d Xuan Yi refused bluntly.3HMM? ? ? ?1The other sect masters were surprised when they saw that Xuan Yi, a mere elder, was so rude to his sect master in front of so many people.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4This guy was only at the Law Enforcement Realm, and he dared to be so rude to his sect master.Could it be that he had some sort of big background?What surprised Wang Ye the most was that Qing Xuzi\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change at all.If it was in the Myriad Beast Sect, an elder didn\u2019t even dare to breathe heavily when facing his sect master.Li Changqing was also surprised.He did not think that his old friend had a good temper. One had to know that Qing Xuzi had been an extremely bold guy in his early years.Any young man who dared to be so arrogant in front of Qing Xuzi would be severely reprimanded.But what happened after that shocked them.Instead of reprimanding the young man, Qing Xuzi cupped his hands and bowed respectfully to Xuan Yi.Qing Xuzi quickly explained to the sect masters present, \u201cAhem, sect masters, this is the most powerful elder of Profound Sword Sect, Xuan Yi. Elder Xuan also presides over the Sword Worship Assembly.\u201dThen, he sent a voice transmission to Xuan Yi, \u201cElder Xuan, this assembly concerns the reputation of our sect. This time, even the old guys who hadn\u2019t come out for years have arrived, and they even brought their best disciples. Our sect can only rely on you to solve the crisis.\u201dAs the most fierce sect master of the south domain, Qing Xuzi was actually rejected by one of his own elders at such a big occasion.He couldn\u2019t help but laugh bitterly in his heart.However, with Xuan Yi\u2019s peerless talent at his age, his future prospects would definitely far surpass all people in his sect and even the entire south domain!Therefore, even though Xuan Yi was rude to him, Qing Xuzi didn\u2019t dare to say anything.Elder Xuan?Wang Ye got impatient.A genius elder? He was nothing but a junior at the second level of the Law Enforcement Realm.His Myriad Beast Sect could summon spirit beasts to fight alongside with them.He was confident that he could kill enemies with higher level of strength than his.Countless geniuses had been killed by the green python beneath his feet.A genius? Hehe, it was just food for his spirit beast.2On one side, Li Changqing\u2019s eyes flickered, and circles of ripples appeared in his eyes.This was the Heaven Array Sect\u2019s technique, the Eye of the Void.Eh? Bone age was 20, but his strength was at the second level of the Law Enforcement Realm.The guy\u2019s strength was unexpectedly high. He was a genius that was hard to come by in a hundred years and had broken through to the Law Enforcement Realm at the age of 20!In contrast, his beloved disciple standing behind him, with the help of the sect\u2019s Spirit Gathering Array, had just reached the ninth level of the Golden Core Realm at the age of 17!It would be quite difficult for him to break through to the Law Enforcement Realm at the age of 20!1With this thought in mind, he looked at Xuan Yi with some appreciation.However, if Li Changqing knew that Xuan Yi had broken through from zero to the Law Enforcement Realm in one year\u2019s time, he would be shocked!Most importantly, Xuan Yi\u2019s breakthrough didn\u2019t rely on array techniques. The spirit energy obtained through array techniques was the most ordinary kind. Instead, Xuan Yi obtained the incomparably pure spirit energy from the system. These two energies were completely two different categories.At this moment, Xuan Yi saw people glancing at them, either astonished or disdainful.Although he wasn\u2019t a person who liked to show off, he didn\u2019t liked to be seen as a joke. Moreover, the sect master had begged him for help.1Hence, he stood up and said gently, \u201cFine. Since the sect master asked, I will host the Sword Worship Assembly. I now announce the official start of this assembly.\u201cNext, I will tell you guys the criteria for recruiting disciples during this assembly. There are three assessments involved. Firstly, test talent. Secondly, test the purity of the spirit energy. Thirdly, test the combat ability.\u201cDo you see the black stone tablet in the center of the practice field? This is the seven-colored profound jade tablet, which is also a testing tool.\u201cThe process for testing one\u2019s talent is as follows. First, fuse your spirit energy into the stone tablet. It will give you a grade based on your cultivation level and age. There are ten levels in total, and each level corresponds to a grade. If your age is young and your cultivation strength is high, then it is possible that you are above the fifth level. If you\u2019re old in age and your cultivation strength is low, then it is possible that you are around the first level. In short, a high cultivation level does not mean that you are talented. It also depends on your age.10\u201cIf the stone tablet shows that you are at the third level or above, then the next step was to test the purity of your spirit energy.\u201cThis process is very simple. Use your most powerful move and hit the stone tablet to make it glow. This seven-colored profound jade tablet will emit seven colors of the rainbow. Red means the lowest and\u00a0purple means the best.\u201cThe third test is to assess you combat ability. The sect will set up a mystic realm for the disciples who have passed the second test to enter. They will hunt demonic beasts in it, and those who kill the most demonic beasts with higher cultivation level than their own are the outstanding disciples, The sect elders will take them in as disciples.\u201cOf course, I will also take in disciples who perform excellently in the tests.\u201dAs soon as Xuan Yi finished speaking, the tens of thousands of disciples present were in an uproar.It wasn\u2019t because this process was difficult, but that he would personally take in disciples.One had to know that the last disciple Xuan Yi had taken in, Lin Yingxue, had been only a ninth level of Qi Condensation Realm disciple, but after she was taken in by Elder Xuan, she had reached the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment Realm in a very short time.And Wang Hu, who was taken in before Lin Yingxue was even luckier. He had been just a mortal, but under Elder Xuan\u2019s guidance, he had become a cultivator and was now close to the Foundation Establishment Realm.6Most importantly, these two disciples had been outer sect disciples which were as lowly as ants in people\u2019s eyes before being taken in by Elder Xuan. Now, they were personal disciples of the most talented Elder Xuan.They were like carp which had leaped over the Dragon Gate!So this announcement made everyone crazy!The disciples of the Profound Sword Sect were all rubbing their hands, ready to do their best in the tests.As the disciples infused their spirit energy into the stone tablet, the pockmarked elder standing beside the stone tablet said indifferently, \u201cWang Tian, seventh level of the Qi Condensation Realm, age 17, talent: second level, failed.\u201cLiu Hai, fourth level of the Qi Condensation Realm, age 20, talent: first level, failed.\u201cShi Hao, seventh level of the Qi Condensation Realm, age 16, third level, passed.\u201d\u2026Some passed, and some didn\u2019t.Those who had passed were happy while others were sad.Seeing this, Bai Weiwei felt extremely nervous.She had been half a step into the Foundation Establishment Realm, but now she had fallen back to the fifth level of the Qi Condensation realm. She didn\u2019t know what level would the stone tablet show.Moreover, even if she passed the first test, the subsequent tests would still be fraught with difficulties.Seeing Bai Weiwei\u2019s anxious expression, Ma Liang came up to her and said mockingly, \u201cBai Weiwei, if you agree to be my maidservant and persuade your Bai Clan to submit to my Ma Clan, I will persuade my father to go easy on your Bai Clan. Otherwise, your family will become a river of blood.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Upon hearing Ma Liang\u2019s words, Bai Weiwei became even more determined to become stronger.Her father had said that the more difficult the situation was, the braver she must be. So long as she charged forward without fear, she\u2019d have a long path of immortal cultivation before her.Thus, when it was her turn to test, she looked very calm.She strode forward and took a deep breath.Then, she mobilized her spirit energy and injected it into the stone tablet.A number slowly rose from the stone tablet.As Bai Weiwei waited nervously, the stone tablet finally gave a number.\u201cBai Weiwei, the fifth level of the Qi Condensation Realm, age 15, third level, passed.\u201dBai Weiwei widened her eyes as she looked at the number in front of her.There wasn\u2019t any joy after hearing that she had passed. She only felt endless disappointment.Back then, she had been a genius who was half a step into the Foundation Establishment Realm at the age of ten and was the focus of everyone\u2019s attention. Now she was fifteen years old but her cultivation strength had dropped to the fifth level of the Qi Condensation Realm.Fortunately, she had gradually accepted the reality over the years.\u201cTsk, you just have the advantage of young age. Don\u2019t forget that there are two more tests after this,\u201d Ma Liang mocked her.Most of the outer sect disciples were at the fifth level of the Qi Condensation Realm at the age of fifteen.Bai Weiwei was able to pass because she was young.If she was still at the fifth level of the Qi Condensation Realm at the age of twenty, she would be kicked out of the sect.After that, it was Ma Liang\u2019s turn to test his talent.After Ma Liang injected his spirit energy into the stone tablet, a trace of emotion appeared in the pockmarked elder\u2019s calm eyes.He smiled and said, \u201cMa Liang, the peak of the ninth level of the Qi Condensation Realm, age 18, fourth level, passed!\u201dInstantly, other disciples cast envious and admiring gazes at him.The first test was half way through, and although Ma Liang wasn\u2019t the most talented disciple, he was in the top tire.6He was only behind Yang Mu, who was at the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment Realm, and He Long, who was at the eighth level of the Foundation Establishment Realm, but both of them were inner sect disciples after all.Among the outer sect disciples, Ma Liang was the best.\u201cWell, how come he\u2019s so much more talented than us?\u201d\u201cYeah, some people are born geniuses. We must do better in the second test.\u201d\u2026Bai Weiwei discovered that these people had all passed the first test.Disciples like her who relied on the advantage of age to past the first test would face the tests of spirt energy purity and combat ability with their own cultivation strength.How could she pass those two tests with weak cultivation strength?Thinking of this, the joy of passing the first test vanished completely.Bai Weiwei looked around and realized that there were about one thousand people who had passed the first test. But there were more than 30,000 disciples participating in the Sword Worship Assembly.It did not mean that those eliminated disciples were not strong enough. Many of them were powerful inner sect disciples. However, they failed either because of age or other reasons. In short, their talent was not good enough.It showed how much the cultivation world valued talent.3The first test soon ended, and it was time for the second test.Under the guidance of the pockmarked elder, the disciples formed a long line and began the next test.A solemn-looking inner sect disciple was holding a black sword in his hand, trying to show off.He shouted, \u201cRainbow Piercing the Sun!\u201dA red sword light shot towards the seven-colored black stone tablet.Just when everyone thought that the stone tablet would be cut in half, it let out a buzzing sound.Absorbing the energy from the sword, the black stone tablet slowly turned scarlet.A trace of disappointment flashed in the pockmarked elder\u2019s eyes. Although this guy was an inner sect disciple, his spirit energy was not pure enough. He was not as good as he looked.The elder shook his head and shouted, \u201cWang Yun, the spirit energy purity is at level one. You failed. The red color or level three is the passing line. Next!\u201dThe elder\u2019s words caused a huge uproar among the disciples.This was an inner sect disciple and he got only level one, but they must get a level three or above to pass the test. In other words, only the red, green, blue, and purple colors could be considered as passing.1For a moment, the disciples were deep in thought.Not long after, the pockmarked elder\u2019s voice sounded once again. This time, it sounded a little surprised.\u201cYang Mu, blue, sixth level of spiritual energy purity, passed!\u201dEveryone looked at the youth in the center. He raised his head arrogantly, as if he was the king of the world.He enjoyed the admiration of the audience.Then He Long also passed the test, and the purity of his spirit energy was actually on par with Yang Mu\u2019s.After more than half of the disciples finished testing, it was finally Bai Weiwei\u2019s turn.She had already mentally prepared herself for this moment before the assembly began.She had changed the black sword to the Spirit Nurturing Pill.3She knew her cultivation strength was not stable. She only hoped to slow down her cultivation strength decline.However, reality slapped her in the face. Without the black sword, the strength of her sword energy would be greatly reduced.And the sword in her hand was the wooden sword that she had used when she was little.No one would lower the threshold because of her hard work.Bai Weiwei walked up to the stone tablet with her head lowered.The moment she took out the wooden sword, it caused quite a stir.After all those who dared to use a wooden sword were either extremely confident in their own strength, or fools who overestimated themselves.When Ma Liang saw this, he was amused.He shouted, \u201cHahaha, look here. Isn\u2019t she the genius Bai Weiwei? As a Qi Condensation Realm disciple, she dares to bring a wooden sword to do the test. She\u2019s really amazing.\u201d1Hearing Ma Liang\u2019s ridicule, those who didn\u2019t pass and those who had passed but looked down on her joined the mocking team.\u201cDo you still think you\u2019re a genius?\u201d\u201cThis girl was kicked by a donkey in the head, right? Or is she just a donkey?\u201d\u201cHehe, if she can pass, I\u2019ll stand on my head and eat sh*t!\u201d1\u2026Hearing the mocking words, she remembered her parents\u2019 expectations for her. On the stage, people from other sects were waiting to enjoy the show.Bai Weiwei had no way out.Hence, she smiled resolutely.It was just a test, nothing much!At the elder\u2019s nod, she raised the wooden sword.White spirit energy covered the wooden sword, resonating with it.Her eyes gradually became firm.Bai Weiwei squeezed out every bit of the spirit energy in her body, adding it to the sword again and again.It was as if she couldn\u2019t feel the depletion of the spirit energy in her body.Towards the end, she still crazily squeezed out the spirit energy from her body.However, it was far from enough!She formed a seal in the void and tapped it on her chest.She forced out a mouthful of blood from her heart!\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d The pockmarked elder shouted angrily.He knew this secret technique. The blood essence would increase the strength of the spirit energy in the sword.And this disciple in front of him actually forced out the blood from her heart.1If she wasn\u2019t careful, she would be crippled at best and die on the spot at worst!Just as the elder was about to stop her from doing something stupid, a cool voice sounded in his head.Then, the pockmarked elder stopped.He looked in Xuan Yi\u2019s direction with a puzzled expression.\u201cHuh? Why does Elder Xuan want me to leave the disciple be? If she died, it would be a disgrace in front of the other sect masters.\u201d1Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6The pockmarked elder did not dare to question Xuan Yi because this Sword Worship Assembly was hosted by Xuan Yi. But even if Xuan Yi was not the person in charge of this assembly, he did not dare to question him!After all, a genius master had the final say! How could someone weaker than him question his decision?Hence, the elder stopped immediately.He looked at the young girl in front of him, feeling a little regretful.He believed that the young girl had offended Xuan Yi, which was why she was left to fend for herself.Even if she survived, she would become the laughing stock of the sect.However, Bai Weiwei, who was fully focused on the test, was oblivious of everything around her.She only wanted to use the wooden sword in her hand to fight for her dao and create a future for herself.She opened her mouth and spat out a ball of blood essence onto the wooden sword in her hand.The white light on the wooden sword was dyed red, and the trembling of the sword intensified, as if it was saying goodbye to its mistress.This was a lonely battle, and no one could help her!To Bai Weiwei, the stone tablet in front of her was as unshakable as a mountain.But the sword in her hand also carried her dao heart, and her dao heart was as resplendent as a shooting star!Although the shooting star was short-lived, it could still emit a resplendent light.I, Bai Weiwei, will make my life worthwhile.Go!With a low shout from her, the wooden sword in her hand let out a mournful cry!It turned into a streak of red light and shot straight towards the stone tablet.However, the instant the wooden sword touched the stone tablet, the sword exploded. Bai Weiwei was hit by the huge rebound force, and a mouthful of blood surged up into her mouth.Then, she spat it out.The stone tablet in front of her was still black, and there was no change.Her eyes dimmed, and she said in a daze, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 really\u2026 failed?\u201dMa Liang was very happy at the sight.He laughed silently and thought, \u201cHahaha, Bai Weiwei, you are now a piece of trash. You really deserve it.\u201dThe higher-ups on the stage had seen everything that had happened.Qing Xuzi glanced at Bai Weiwei, but quickly looked away because the girl\u2019s strength was too weak. She couldn\u2019t even activate the lowest level of red on the stone tablet.\u201cAlthough this disciple\u2019s will is strong, her strength is too low. She didn\u2019t even manage to trigger an reaction from the stone tablet with her blood essence,\u201d the First Elder shook his head and said.\u201cMoreover, this sword technique is the most basic sword move of our Profound Sword Sect. She couldn\u2019t even launch the sword move with enough strength. It\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d the Third Elder frowned and said in a low voice.At this moment, the Second Elder voiced his opinion.\u201cAlthough this girl\u2019s talent is not good, her dao heart is strong. Sigh, what a pity.\u201d\u201cHehe, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a pity.\u201d Wang Ye\u2019s eyes flickered as he said indifferently, \u201cI\u2019m not surprised to see such weak disciples here. The Profound Sword Sect has obviously declined.\u201d\u201cHehe\u2026 trash\u2026\u201d Li Changqing\u2019s personal disciple sneered, not caring to hide his disdain.Hearing these comments, the other sect masters of the south domain all wanted to laugh, but didn\u2019t dare to.Obviously, once they returned to their sects, the Profound Sword Sect and its disciples would become the laughingstock of the entire region.Qing Xuzi\u2019s face fell, but there was nothing he could do. Bai Weiwei used to be very talented, but she had mistakenly entered a forbidden zone. To restore her talent would take a lot of resources. But it wasn\u2019t a good deal to put so many resources into a might-be genius.3Qing Xuzi could only close his eyes, so he wouldn\u2019t see the depressing sight.However, Xuan Yi had a look of appreciation on his face and nodded his head in approval from time to time.However, no one thought that the genius Elder Xuan Yi would approve of the disciple who could not even activate the stone tablet.\u2026Bai Weiwei didn\u2019t know that her failure just now had attracted the attention of the higher-ups on the stage.She was thinking about what she had gone through over the past few years.It had already been ten years since she started practicing sword at the age of five. But it seemed that she had no memory of the past ten years of practicing the sword. The only happy thing was that she joined the Profound Sword Sect, but this place was full of geniuses.Ever since her talent was suppressed, she could only rely on her own efforts bit by bit. She got up early and went to bed late, spending all her time on cultivation. However, she still failed.Right at this moment, Elder Ma, who was sitting at the outermost edge of the stage, suddenly landed in front of Bai Weiwei.1He shouted, \u201cBai Weiwei, you violated the sect\u2019s rules. Admit your mistake!\u201d3\u201cAdmit mistake? What mistake did I make?\u201d\u201cHehe, there is no rule to say that you can use blood essence to strengthen sword moves in the test. Humph! Think about it, if you can use blood essence, how unfair would it be to the other disciples?\u201d Ma Wuliang shouted.1\u201cBut\u2026 But\u2026 the sect did not say that we can not use blood essence, right?\u201d Bai Weiwei\u2019s face was pale, too weak to defend herself.Seeing that she still dared to refute, Ma Wuliang narrowed his eyes and angrily shouted, \u201cHumph! You still dare to talk back! You couldn\u2019t activate the stone tablet even after using the blood essence. You\u2019re really trash. Do you know how much humiliation you\u2019ve caused the sect? Today, I will expel you from the sect.\u201dHearing his words, Ma Liang sneered. He glanced at Elder Ma and felt smug.Other disciples also expressed their agreement one after another.Meanwhile, Qing Xuzi closed his eyes and pretended that he had seen nothing.Even the sect master wasn\u2019t willing to interfere, no to mention the elders. After all, they\u2019d get nothing for defending a disciple with ordinary talent.Without waiting for Bai Weiwei\u2019s reaction, Ma Wuliang directly hit her abdomen with his palm, intending to destroy her cultivation strength!1But his palm seemed to meet an invisible barrier three inches away from Bai Weiwei. It couldn\u2019t move forward.Just as he was feeling astonished, Xuan Yi\u2019s faint voice came from behind.\u201cI want this girl!\u201d1Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7What?Elder Xuan actually wanted this trash who couldn\u2019t even activate the stone tablet?The disciples present were extremely shocked.If Elder Xuan was a divine figure from the heavens, then Bai Weiwei was an ant on the ground.The difference between the two was so great that it was impossible for people to connect them together.However, such a thing had indeed happened. Moreover, Elder Xuan had said it in front of everyone.They were astonished. Some female disciples were crazy with jealousy.Yeah, jealousy!Why on earth could Bai Weiwei gain elder Xuan\u2019s favor? Her strength was so low and her talent was mediocre. How was she worthy of Elder Xuan Yi\u2019s approval?But the disciples did not dare to question the elder.The higher-ups on the stage were confused, especially Qing Xuzi. He had asked Xuan Yi to host this assembly because he valued Xuan Yi\u2019s great talent. However, the assessment had not ended yet, and he was already recruiting disciples so arbitrarily. Furthermore, he had taken in an ordinary disciple with such low talent and strength.1What puzzled him even more was that Xuan Yi had actually taken in this disciple in front of the great sect masters of the south domain. It would be like telling everyone that the Profound Sword Sect was blind in selecting disciples and there would be no future for the sect.Hence, he immediately opened his eyes and frowned, \u201cElder Xuan, what\u2026 what do you mean by this?\u201dXuan Yi said calmly, \u201cSect master, you have already handed over the leadership of this assembly to me. If you believe me, then you have nothing to worry about.\u201dSeeing Xuan Yi so calm, the sect master felt a bit better.However, there was still worry in his eyes.At this moment, Ma Liang and Elder Ma got worried.If Xuan Yi insisted on taking Bai Weiwei in, then their plan of getting rid of Bai Weiwei would fall through.They could only brace themselves and face Xuan Yi.\u201cElder Xuan, you are a Law Enforcement Elder. Why did you stop me from enforcing the law? Are you going to stop the assembly from going on?\u201d Elder Ma said in a grave voice.\u201cStop the assembly from going on? The sect master has placed the authority of the assembly in my hands. Elder Ma, aren\u2019t you going too far?\u201d Xuan Yi looked indifferent, and so was his voice.Seeing that the two elders of the Profound Sword Sect were arguing, people from the other sects became interested. They loved to see a good show.After all, if there was an internal conflict in the Profound Sword Sect, it would be a great thing for the other sects.\u201cElder Xuan, this disciple is not only weak, but she also dared to cheat in front of everyone. We can\u2019t ignore such a thing.\u201d After being rebuked, Ma Wuliang\u2019s tone became unfriendly.\u201cThis kind of cheating behavior is unacceptable in any sect. If she is not punished, then our sect will become a joke among the top 100 sects of the south domain.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes, Elder Ma is right.\u201dMa Liang quickly added, \u201cBai Weiwei used her blood essence to activate the secret technique. It was cheating. This is unfair to the other disciples! Elder Ma is impartial. He directly pointed out her inappropriate behavior. He set a role model for us. We\u2019ll learn from Elder Ma, so that everyone in our sect will be fair and just.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t expected that Xuan Yi would suddenly take in Bai Weiwei as his disciple, but if he could mobilize other disciples to pressure Elder Xuan, Elder Ma could definitely destroy Bai Weiwei\u2019s cultivation strength.Hearing his words, even though Xuan Yi had a high status among the disciples, a few disciples began to question Xuan Yi.\u201cYes, this is unfair to us.\u201d\u201cElder Xuan, you are fair and just. You must not let the cheater get away with it.\u201d\u201cI hope that Elder Xuan will think twice and follow the rules of the sect.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I support Elder Ma to kill this useless woman.\u201d\u201cI also support it.\u201d\u2026More and more disciples began to protest.Seeing the atmosphere was right for his plan, Ma Wuliang injected spirit energy into his voice and shouted, \u201cElder Xuan, the Profound Sword Sect has come a long way by following the rules and punishing those who are in the wrong. It has a history of more than three thousand years and its rules can not be violated just because of this insignificant disciple. If we don\u2019t punish her, it will affect the foundation of our sect. Think about it, if a thousand-year-old sect loses its soul, how can it stand in the world?!\u201dMa Wuliang\u2019s voice was not loud, but infused with spirit energy, it could be heard by everyone present.The elders and higher-ups on the stage were moved by his words.They were even more confused by Xuan Yi\u2019s action.\u201cElder Xuan, it\u2019s not a decision you can make by yourself. All of us have a say in it,\u201d the First Elder said in a grave voice.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Elder Xuan. We all know that it\u2019s difficult to advance to the next level from the Law Enforcement Realm. Only when we work together can we make a difference. So you can\u2019t act so impulsively.\u201d The Second Elder also agreed with Elder Ma.\u201cI say, Elder Xuan, the sect master handed the leadership to you because he hoped that you would select a peerless genius instead of a useless disciple who can\u2019t even activate the stone tablet with her blood essence. It\u2019s still not too late for you to take back your words. I believe that the sect master won\u2019t blame you,\u201d the Third Elder said with a frown.However, even though so many people were questioning Xuan Yi, his expression did not change at all.He had a faint but calm smile on his lips.A gentle breeze blew at the hem of his robe, and his black hair danced freely in it.Xuan Yi flew down from the stage and landed beside Bai Weiwei.His elegance fascinated Bai Weiwei as she lay on the ground of the martial arts practice field.He was a peerless genius, and he had a style that no one could copy.Bai Weiwei knew that she was finished, so she did not dare to hope that Xuan Yi would violate the sect\u2019s rules for her.She coughed lightly, and blood spilled out from a corner of her mouth. She said weakly, \u201cElder Xuan, I thank you for your mercy, but I\u2019m done\u2026 Please don\u2019t\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish, Xuan Yi bent down and lifted Bai Weiwei up into his arms.2His voice was extremely gentle as he asked, \u201cAre you willing to become my disciple?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Xuan Yi floated down from the stage and lifted Bai Weiwei up.By doing so, he ignored the opinions of the people in his sect in front of outsiders.It was no less than slapping their faces.Seeing this, the elders on the stage looked gloomy. They were extremely unhappy with Xuan Yi.\u201cHehe, so this is the genius elder of your Profound Sword Sect? He\u2019s just so so.\u201d Wang Ye smiled faintly. His eyes were filled with ridicule.Li Changqing, who was sitting next to him, shook his head and said with contempt, \u201cThe Profound Sword Sect is in the decline. I\u2019m afraid that in a few years, they will probably be ranked at the bottom of the top 100 sects in the south domain.\u201d1\u201cAt the bottom? Sect Master Li, you\u2019re too kind. I think it will be removed from the list,\u201d Wang Ye said immediately.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dHearing the ridiculing words from the sect masters of the Myriad Beasts Sect and the Heaven Array Sect, many people from the top 100 sects laughed out loud.Obviously, they did not take the fierce sword sect seriously.Qing Xuzi frowned and his expression changed from puzzled to hesitant and then doubtful.He was beginning to wonder if handing over the leadership of the convention to Xuan Yi was the right decision.1Seeing the doubt on the face of the sect master, Elder Ma became excited.Just now, Xuan Yi had ignored him and went to Bai Weiwei\u2019s side. In front of him, Xuan Yi lifted up Bai Weiwei, whose family were enemies with Elder Ma.He was angered by Xuan Yi\u2019s ignorance!When he saw that even the sect master did not understand Xuan Yi\u2019s action, he decided to add fuel to the fire.\u201cElder Xuan, I advise you not to interfere. This kind of responsibility is not something that you can shoulder. You can ignore me and others. But do you have no respect for the sect master? You should know that the sect\u2019s interests are above anything else, right?\u201dMa Wuliang\u2019s words did not stir up any emotions in Xuan Yi because to him, Ma Wuliang was like a fly. If this fly annoyed him, he did not mind teaching it a lesson.Xuan Yi released a powerful aura which contained all his cultivation strength.With Xuan Yi as the center, a strong wind swirled and spread out.The powerful aura made everyone present unable to breathe, especially Ma Wuliang, who was closest to Xuan Yi; he even felt suffocated.He had thought that his cultivation strength at the first level of the Law Enforcement Realm was not much different from Xuan Yi\u2019s. Even if there was some difference, he thought he had enough strength to protect himself. However, facing this kind of pressure, he could do nothing but submit!One had to know that Xuan Yi\u2019s cultivation strength was only one level higher than his, but he felt the other party\u2019s power was no less than the sect leader\u2019s.This person was so powerful. Oh, no! To be able to make him feel this way despite the fact that they were in the same realm meant that Xuan Yi\u2019s talent far exceeded his.This person definitely had the ability to fight people with higher cultivation levels than his own!He had known all along that Xuan Yi was highly talented in cultivation. After all, there were only a few twenty-year-old Law Enforcement Realm cultivators in the entire south domain!2However, he felt that he had still underestimated Xuan Yi. No wonder the sect master placed so much importance on him.Ma Wuliang was filled with regret.\u201cElder\u2026 Elder Xuan! It\u2019s unfair to the other disciples! Any of them is better than Bai Weiwei!\u201d Elder Ma braced himself and said.\u201cIf Elder Xuan still wants to waste the resources of the sect on such a weakling, it\u2019s unfair to the others!\u201cIf you don\u2019t give us an explanation, I\u2019m sure the other disciples will be dissatisfied.\u201dImmediately, the disciples of the Black Sword Sect looked at Elder Ma with respect.In their eyes, Elder Ma\u2019s righteous words made him a real Law Enforcement Elder.On the other hand, Xuan Yi\u2019s behavior was just hard to understand!Xuan Yi stood in the middle of the martial arts practice field. His white clothes rustled in the wind, and his eyes flashed with cold light.\u201cI don\u2019t need to explain my actions to anyone!\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s words were firm and decisive.His invisible aura soared again, and Ma Wuliang broke out in cold sweat.Ma Liang was even more miserable, lying on the ground like a dead dog, not moving at all.Xuan Yi didn\u2019t want to kill him on the spot, otherwise, he would have been crushed into minced meat.\u201cElder Xuan\u2026 Elder Xuan, please\u2026stop\u2026\u201d Ma Wuliang could not hold on any longer and begged for mercy.\u201cHumph!\u201dXuan Yi snorted coldly and a huge spirit pressure was exerted on Ma Wuliang, injuring him immediately. Clearly, he had got serious internal injuries.Xuan Yi could see the sinister look in the latter\u2019s eyes. He wouldn\u2019t kill Ma Wuliang right here because he didn\u2019t want to reveal his true strength in front of the other sect masters.They were enemies now. This time, Xuan Yi only collected some interest.On the stage, Qing Xuzi felt this powerful pressure, and the doubt in his eyes disappeared.The reason was very simple. Three months ago, Qing Xuzi had seen that Xuan Yi was only at the first level of the Law Enforcement Realm.But three months later, he broke through to the second level!One had to know that every level of the Law Enforcement Realm required a long time to cultivate and accumulate. There were tens of thousands of cultivators in the world, and the vast majority of them were stuck in the Law Enforcement Realm for hundreds of years until they died of old age, unable to make a single step forward!But Xuan Yi\u2019s talent far surpassed his! He was an absolute genius!With Xuan Yi\u2019s talent, how could he be wrong? He must knew what he was doing.3Qing Xuzi\u2019s face lit up with joy, and he knew his decision was right.What he did not know was that Xuan Yi\u00a0had just entered the Law Enforcement Realm when he stood out from the last Sword Worship Assembly.But after taking in Lin Yingxue as his disciple, he had soared by one level. After taking in Lin Hu, he had soared by another level.4Cultivation? Not at all. He only grew fish, flowers, and plants in the back mountain every day and became stronger whenever taking in a disciple\u2026At this moment\u2026The young girl in Xuan Yi\u2019s arms stared at him without blinking. Her brain was short of oxygen, and she felt as if she was in a dream.Her beautiful eyes instantly turned red-brimmed.No one knew how hard the ten years of cultivation had been for her.In her memories, she had always cultivated alone.She had relied on her determination and strong will to stagger all the way to this day.And now, when she was the weakest and most in need of protection, this strong and majestic man appeared by her side.He had defended her and solved all her problems.The obsession in her heart instantly disappeared because today she got all the rewards for her previous hard work.When Xuan Yi saw Bai Weiwei looking at him with a burning gaze, he said in a gentle voice, \u201cAm I good-looking?\u201d\u201cUh, Elder Xuan is\u2026good-looking\u2026\u201d Bai Weiwei blushed and said without thinking.\u201cOh? You still call me elder,\u201d Xuan Yi said.2\u201cAh, master\u2026 Master\u2026\u201dBai Weiwei\u2019s body stiffened as she realized that she was in Xuan Yi\u2019s arms. She felt blood surge up into her brain.Now that she had let go of her obsession, she began to feel the fatigue due to the energy depletion. As her blood surged up into her head, she fainted in Xuan Yi\u2019s arms, feeling relieved.Looking at the young girl in his arms, Xuan Yi felt somewhat helpless.Now that he had taken in a disciple, there was no need for him to remain here.He turned around and said to Qing Xuzi, \u201cSect master, if the sect objects to me taking in Bai Weiwei as my disciple, the sect can remove me from the Law Enforcement Elders!\u201dAfter saying this, he did not care about what others thought of him and rushed towards the back of the mountain with Bai Weiwei in his arms.The corners of Qing Xuzi\u2019s mouth twitched as he stood on the stage.How could he do that? If he did not treasure the great genius and drove him out of the sect, then who\u2019d help the sect rise up in the world?A long-awaited voice came in Xuan Yi\u2019s mind.[ Ding Dong, congratulations to the host for successfully taking in a disciple! ][ Ding Dong, congratulations to the host for raising his cultivation strength to the fifth level of the Law Enforcement Realm. ]2[ Ding Dong, congratulations to the host for obtaining the holy elixir: Life Creation Pill. ]2[ Ding Dong, congratulations to the host for obtaining a supreme-grade spirit sword. ][ Ding Dong, congratulations to the host for obtaining the Imperial Scripture: Supreme Yin Scripture ]9Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9After Xuan Yi took Bai Weiwei to the back mountain, the people at the assembly had different expressions on their faces.Most of them looked envious.Among them, He Long and Yang Mu looked especially shocked and disappointed.The two of them had come to this assembly in the hope of becoming personal disciples of Elder Xuan. Now, they could only watch helplessly as an outer sect disciple whose strength was far inferior to theirs became Xuan Yi\u2019s personal disciple. How could they not be disappointed?The female disciples felt especially jealous of Bai Weiwei.This was because Elder Xuan Yi had carried Bai Weiwei away in his arms, and she had actually fainted.This kind of scene was something that they did not even dare to dream about. However, it had happened before their eyes. Moreover, Bai Weiwei\u2019s strength and talent were ranked at the bottom. How could they not be jealous?On the practice field, Ma Wuliang stood there in fury. However, he could not show it.Just now, he had been suppressed by Xuan Yi\u2019s aura and got severe internal injuries. Moreover, in front of so many people, he could not even resist Xuan Yi\u2019s aura. He would definitely become a joke in the entire south domain.The sect master just smiled and shook his head helplessly. After all, it wasn\u2019t the first time that Xuan Yi did such an outrageous thing. What ability did he have to stop Xuan Yi? He could only let him be.After Xuan Yi\u2019s departure, the third test progressed very quickly.After all, everyone had come here in the hope of becoming Elder Xuan\u2019s personal disciple.Now that Elder Xuan was no longer around, it was better to end it quickly.It was better to go back and cultivate hard, waiting for the next time when Elder Xuan took in a disciple.After the third test, the Sword Worship Assembly ended.He Long and Yang Mu became the personal disciples of two elders of the sect, while Ma Liang became the personal disciple of Elder Ma.When the assembly ended, Li Changqing and Wang Ye exchanged a glance, with a smile in their eyes.After all, the disciples of the Profound Sword Sect this year were all very ordinary. It was a great thing for what they were going to say next.They said to Qing Xuzi, \u201cWe\u2019re filled with admiration after watching the Sword Worship Assembly. I wonder if you are ready to open the Sage Mystic Realm.\u201d\u201cYes, Old Qing, we agreed on it a few years ago and you can\u2019t go back on your words. None of us can open this mystic realm, even if we work together, unless we have the approval of your Profound Sword Sect.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, fellow Daoist Qing Xuzi. We already missed the opportunity to open the mystic realm last time. This time, don\u2019t try to shirk your responsibility,\u201d said the sect masters of the other great sects.Although Qing Xuzi had guessed their purpose, he was still displeased.How could he not know about this Sage Mystic Realm?The origin of this mystic realm was closely related to the Profound Sword Sect.In the past, the Profound Sword Sect had produced a master of the Noble King Realm. His name was Li Wendao, and he was the founder of the Profound Sword Sect. Unlike Qing Xuzi, Li Wendao had incredible talent. At his peak, he reached the peak of the ninth level of the Noble King Realm!6With this strength, he was unrivalled in the south domain of that time.The entire south domain was in his control back then. No one in the region dared to challenge the Profound Sword Sect or disobey its orders.However, because Li Wendao\u2019s heart was set on the Dao, his goal wasn\u2019t the southern domain. Instead, he wanted to break through to a higher realm. So he went to a larger region.Unfortunately, when Li Wendao returned to the south domain, not only did he fail to break through, he was on the verge of death.Because he had been gone for hundreds of years, the Profound Sword Sect was no longer the same as it had been when he had left.Different cultivation methods, different forces, and different beliefs had long divided the sect into countless smaller sects.The foundation that he had worked so hard to build was destroyed just like that.He was not pleased.Therefore, before he died, he made a dying wish.Whoever could obtain his inheritance and pass the test he set up would be the leader of the south region.In the mystic realm he left behind, other than countless treasures, there was one thing that all the sect leaders coveted. That was his notes of how to enter the Noble King Realm. There were also rumors that Li Wendao had long found the secret to advance from the Noble King Realm, given enough time, he would be able to reach the Sage Realm. However, he was pursued by his enemies, so he did not have time to cultivate. He could only leave it behind as his inheritance.People named this mystic realm after Sage Li, the respectful title people gave to him.It was commonly known as the Sage Mystic Realm!In order for the person who received his inheritance to gain people\u2019s recognition, Li Wendao had set up a rule.This mystic realm could only be entered by young geniuses under the age of 30.2After all, the purpose was to select the highest ruler of the south domain.If a person had to make up for the lack of talent with cultivation, then he was not qualified to be the ruler.In the Sage Mystic Realm, there were countless divine weapons, peerless elixirs, powerful cultivation techniques, and even the notes of how to reach the Noble King Realm!One had to know that there were only a few Noble King Realm masters in the entire south domain. Every one of them was a leader of the south domain and a power to block the myriad alien races from the outer region!This secret of reaching the noble king realm was coveted by many sect masters in the south domain.This was because they had been stuck in the Sect Master Realm for God knows how many years.If their strength could not improve, they would die. How could they not be anxious?Not to mention the biggest temptation: the leadership of the entire south domain.Therefore, every time a peerless genius appeared in one of the top 100 sects, it would definitely cause a stir in the entire south domain.This time, when the Heaven Array Sect and the Myriad Beast Sect heard about the Sword Worship Assembly, they brought their disciples over to take a look at the situation.In the end, they found the Profound Sword Sect\u2019s disciples under the age of 30 were a bunch of trash.2This made them extremely excited.How could Qing Xuzi not know the purpose of these top 100 sects?This was also the reason why he placed so much importance on Xuan Yi. He hoped that he could choose a disciple with excellent talent to participate in this mystic realm expedition.1But in the end\u2026Qing Xuzi frowned, feeling extremely frustrated.He had stayed in the Sect Master Realm for too long, and his heart yearned for the Noble King Realm.More importantly, after Li Wendao\u2019s death, the Profound Sword Sect was nothing more than a shell. Only after obtaining the inheritance of the founder would it be a truly powerful and unified sect.As the sect master, how could Qing Xuzi not want the Profound Sword Sect to regain its glory?He had refused these two people last time. But these two old geezers had told all the top 100 sects about this mystic realm and they were exerting pressure on him together.It seemed like he had to agree this time.Just as he was feeling extremely depressed, a white-robed figure with incredible talent suddenly appeared in his mind.That\u2019s right, this person was Xuan Yi!When he thought of Xuan Yi, Qing Xuzi\u2019s gaze became firm.He said calmly, \u201cAlright, my Profound Sword Sect has no objection.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10The next morning, in a quiet and elegant room at the back mountain of the Profound Sword Sect.A beautiful girl was lying on a large sandalwood bed engraved with dragon patterns.Her breathing was steady, and the saliva at one corner of her mouth indicated that she was sleeping soundly.The man beside her had sword-shaped eyebrows, bright eyes and a graceful bearing.1He was dressed in white and looked like an immortal.This man was Xuan Yi, and the girl on the bed was Bai Weiwei.This room was also Xuan Yi\u2019s place of cultivation.Yesterday, Bai Weiwei had kept calling his name and holding on to him tightly like a frightened bird.1After all, she had worked hard for so long, and it was time for her to rest.Hence, Xuan Yi decided to put her in his bed. After all, no one dared to come to this place without his permission.2Moreover, he still had some things to explain to Bai Weiwei.Glancing at the girl on the bed, Xuan Yi rubbed his nose helplessly.This girl was really\u2026Yesterday, in order to treat Bai Weiwei\u2019s injuries, he had gone through a lot of trouble.It wasn\u2019t that her injuries were difficult to treat. Due to her special physique, he had to be very careful, or she would really become a wastrel.At this moment, the young girl on the bed frowned slightly and slowly opened her eyes.At first, she looked confused, then she suddenly thought of something and her expression turned to shock. Finally, she saw Xuan Yi looking at with a mild expression on his face.Bai Weiwei\u2019s face suddenly turned red and the blush even spread to her ears.Because she had guessed that this was her master\u2019s room.\u201cMas\u2026 mas\u2026 mas.\u201d2Bai Weiwei quickly lowered her head, her face as red as a child who had done something wrong. She stammered as she tried to talk.\u201cYes,\u201d Xuan Yi replied softly.\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d He asked.Bai Weiwei quickly checked herself.Then, she took a deep breath and muttered to herself, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, it\u2019s alright. My Yuan Yin is still there\u2026\u201dYuan Yin, the symbol of a maid\u202610Xuan Yi: \u2026Bai Weiwei: \u2026The air seemed to have frozen.\u201cAhem. I was asking about your injuries. What were you thinking about?\u201d Xuan Yi reminded her.\u201cOh! Injuries.\u201d Bai Weiwei understood this time and immediately checked.The result surprised her, no, it astonished her.She found that her previous injuries had all healed. More importantly,\u00a0she was actually at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm but she had lost almost all of her cultivation strength only yesterday!But the result was not surprising to Xuan Yi. Although the girl\u2019s talent had been suppressed for five years and her realm had declined, the past five years of continuous cultivation had made her foundation very solid.The most important thing was that she had his help. He was worried that her foundation would be unstable if her level increased too fast, otherwise he\u2019d help her break through to the Golden Core Realm.However, how could Bai Weiwei know about this? She was shocked by the change, but more than that, she was grateful.To her, this change was almost like a rebirth. He had given her a new life.Bai Weiwei hurriedly got up from the bed and knelt down.\u201cMaster, I\u2019ll never forget your great kindness.\u201d Bai Weiwei\u2019s eyes were misty, but she forced back her tears because she didn\u2019t want her master to think that she was weak.Xuan Yi nodded and said indifferently, \u201cAlright, since you call me master, you should accept these things.\u201dWith a flash of white light, a few things appeared in front of Bai Weiwei, including a supreme-grade spirit sword and an ancient cultivation scroll with the words Supreme Yin Scripture written on the cover. She looked at the scroll with great interest. There was also a bottle of fragrant pills that looked quite extraordinary.\u201cOh my God, this is\u2026\u201d Bai Weiwei\u2019s beautiful eyes widened, and she covered her mouth with a hand.\u201cMaster, these things are really too valuable for me to accept.\u201d\u201cToo valuable for you? Why is that? As my disciple, there\u2019s nothing too valuable for you!\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 Then I\u2019ll take this spirit sword. I lost my sword.\u201d Bai Weiwei pointed at the spirit sword, looking expectant.Exasperated, Xuan Yi said, \u201cOf these three things, you\u2019ve chosen the least valuable sword. It seems that I didn\u2019t heal your brain just now. Come, let me take a good look at you again.\u201d1Hearing her master\u2019s tease words, Bai Weiwei\u2019s face turned red.Without waiting for her to speak, Xuan Yi explained, \u201cThis bottle of pill is a holy medicine. It\u2019s called the Life Creation Pill. Not only can it grow flesh on bones, but it can also improve one\u2019s strength and help one break through to higher levels. And this scroll is an imperial scripture called the Supreme Yin Scripture. If you cultivate it well, with your current foundation, you\u2019ll easily surpass the sect master.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Bai Weiwei was shocked, but most of all she was full of disbelief.Of course, she didn\u2019t think that these items were fake. She just didn\u2019t believe that she, a mediocre disciple who had been stuck at the Foundation Establishment Realm, could surpass the sect master.Xuan Yi saw her doubt and asked, \u201cWhy, you don\u2019t believe me? As long as you cultivate hard with me, you future is bright!\u201dBai Weiwei hurriedly stood up and explained, \u201cI. . .\u00a0Of course I believe in you, Master, but\u2026\u201d\u201cBut what?\u201dBai Weiwei told him everything about her family. Finally, she expressed her wish to return to her family and solve the family\u2019s problems before coming back to cultivate with him.Xuan Yi frowned and thought for a moment. He thought that she would be unable to cultivate well with him and her progress would be much slower with such worries on her mind. So he agreed.However, for the sake of her safety, Xuan Yi injected a stream of sword energy into her spirit sword to protect her.\u201cRemember, this sword contains one of my sword moves. If someone attacks you, activate the sword energy in the spirit sword. Those below the fifth level of Law Enforcement Realm are not your match!\u201d Xuan Yi instructed her.After he took in Bai Wei Wei as his disciple, the system had rewarded him by increasing his cultivation level to the fifth level of Law Enforcement Realm.1Xuan Yi was unrivalled among those of the same level!He could even kill enemies who were one or two levels higher than his.3\u201cOkay.\u201d Bai Wei Wei was deeply touched.After she accepted the things given by her master, she only had one thought in her mind, which was to quickly settle the family issues and then return to her master\u2019s side to cultivate.Then, she left the mountain.When she came to the outer sect to pack up her stuff, to her surprise, a large group of disciples surrounded her with envy in their eyes.\u201cMy God, isn\u2019t this Bai Weiwei? Her aura\u2026 how could it be! ! ! She actually recovered! She\u2019s even stronger than Ma Liang who has reached the peak of the Qi Condensation Realm!\u201d\u201cYeah, and look at the sword in her hand. That\u2019s a spirit sword.\u201d\u201cYeah, and it\u2019s a supreme-grade spirit sword. Elder Xuan is as generous as ever.\u201d\u201cHumph, she\u2019s just relying on Elder Xuan. She\u2019d never afford it with her own abilities.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m furious. Why is she so lucky?\u201d\u201cShush, keep your voice down. She is now Elder Xuan\u2019s personal disciple. She\u2019d be fine even if she killed you. If you want to die, don\u2019t drag me with you.\u201d\u201cThat day at the Sword Worship Assembly, Elder Xuan confronted the sect master in front of so many masters because of her. He said that if the sect master didn\u2019t agree for him to take in Bai Weiwei as a disciple, he\u2019d quit from his position as a Law Enforcement Elder.\u201d\u2026Some disciples feared her while others disdained her. However, all of them had intense envy in their eyes when they looked at her.When Bai Weiwei heard these comments, she was stunned since she had fainted and thus did not hear Xuan Yi\u2019s words to the sect master. Now that she heard it from the outer sect disciples, she was extremely shocked.\u201cIn order to take me in as a disciple, my master has actually done so much\u2026 I can not let him down!\u201dThen Bai Weiwei packed a few things and left the Profound Sword Sect.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Five days later. Bai Weiwei, who was at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm, flew toward home on her supreme-grade spirt sword at a speed no less than that of a Golden Core Realm master.3After traveling for five days, she finally arrived at the New Moon City that she had not seen for a long time.As she got close to the home that she had not seen for five years, she could not help but feel a myriad of emotions and she was eager to see her parents.Meanwhile, the people of the Bai Clan were wishing time would stop.Today was the last day that Ma Clan of the Earth Rock Sect and White Bones Clan gave Bai Clan to surrender. The entire Bai Clan was under siege and they couldn\u2019t get out even if they had wings.1A man with a resolute expression paced back and forth in the courtyard. He looked anxious, as if he was waiting for something.At this time, a middle-aged woman walked over. Her name was Liu Yan, and she was Bai Weiwei\u2019s mother.Bai Shuangxiong saw his wife walking over and immediately asked, \u201cHow is it? Is there any news about Weiwei?\u201dLiu Yan shook her head, after thinking for a moment, she asked, \u201cShuangxiong, do you really intend to fight with them? We don\u2019t have the slightest chance of winning. The Earth Rock Sect has a Golden Core Realm master, and they also has a clansman who is an elder in the Profound Sword Sect.\u201d\u201cHahaha, Mrs. Liu, you are right. Today is the last day of your Bai Clan. You better think carefully. Will you surrender and join our Earth Rock Sect, or do you want me to slaughter your entire family?\u201d In the sky above the Bai Clan, the sect master of the Earth Rock Sect, Ma Hongliang, shouted.And beside him stood a gloomy-looking man. His body emitted a gloomy and cold aura. Clearly, he was an external aid from the White Bones Sect.Moreover, behind the two of them was a large group of masters of Qi Condensation Realm and Foundation Establishment Realm! There were more than thirty of them, all of whom were elites of the Earth Rock Sect and the White Bones Sect!Hearing his words, Bai Shuangxiong, the head of the Bai Clan, shouted with bloodshot eyes, \u201cMa Hongliang, you despicable and shameless villain, do you know that my daughter has been chosen by an elder? Aren\u2019t you afraid that my daughter will inform the sect and have your son kicked out of the Profound Sword Sect?\u201dHearing Bai Shuangxiong use the Profound Sword Sect to suppress him, Ma Hongliang couldn\u2019t help but ridicule.\u201cHehe, you fool, you\u2019re really stupid. Your daughter has got her strength destroyed long ago, yet you\u2019re still boasting shamelessly!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dBai Shuangxiong and Liu Yan were extremely shocked. However, seeing Ma Hongliang\u2019s cockiness, they began to wonder. There was no news from Weiwei in the past few days; did she really\u2026\u201cWhat are you talking about, you bastard? My daughter, Bai Weiwei, is a genius of the Bai Clan. She has been obedient and sensible since she was little. Furthermore, she sent us the message that she was about to become a personal disciple of an elder. How could something happen to her in the Profound Sword Sect?\u201d\u201cHahaha, personal disciple, how laughable. Since you are about to die anyway, I\u2019m not afraid to tell you that the elder of my clan in the Profound Sword Sect already destroyed your genius daughter\u2019s cultivation strength five years ago.\u201cThe personal disciple mission that your daughter did was planned by Elder Ma. After the mission was over, she lost her cultivation strength long ago.\u201cIn the past few years, your daughter has already been reduced to an outer sect disciple in the Profound Sword Sect. I\u2019m afraid that she would be kicked out after this year\u2019s Sword Worship Assembly. She didn\u2019t tell you? Hahaha. It\u2019s no wonder. From a genius to a wastrel, I guess she feels too humiliated to tell you.\u201dHearing this, Bai Shuangxiong was dumbfounded. His eyes were filled with disbelief.\u201cNo! It\u2019s absolutely impossible!\u201d\u201cHehe, impossible? If your daughter was still a genius, she would have long become a disciple of an elder of the Profound Sword Sect. How would we dare to lay our hands on your Bai Clan? Now, you don\u2019t even have anyone to speak to in the Profound Sword Sect. So we have nothing to be afraid of. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here!\u201d Ma Hongliang said with a sneer.1\u201cAh! my daughter! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Bai Shuangxiong\u2019s heart sank. He was smart and realized that something was wrong.No matter what the truth was, he condensed his spirit energy and charged forward.The black-clothed old man at the side narrowed his eyes, ready to kill.Right at this moment, Bai Weiwei arrived and shouted from afar, \u201cStop! !\u201dWhat?This was Bai Weiwei\u2019s voice.Everyone stopped and looked at the young girl at the gate, their faces filled with shock.Bai Weiwei\u2019s appearance surprised them. More importantly, she actually had a supreme grade spirit sword in her hand!\u201cWeiwei! You\u2019re fine, that\u2019s so great.\u201d Bai Shuangxiong laughed loudly,\u201cNo, Weiwei, why are you here? It\u2019s very dangerous here. Go.\u201d Liu Yan\u2019s face was full of anxiety.Bai Weiwei shook her head. Immediately, she displayed her strength at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm, shocking everyone present.\u201cWhat? Weiwei, I can\u2019t read your realm. You must have already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm,\u201d Liu Yan said with a smile.2Bai Weiwei also smiled as she said, \u201cMother, I\u2019m already half a step into the Golden Core Realm.\u201dWhat?!Ma Hongliang was stunned. How could he knew nothing about it?The black-clothed man at the side also frowned. He was also shocked by her strength and sensed that something was wrong.The Ma Clan disciples were even more frightened.\u201cAt fifteen-year-old, she is half a step into the Golden Core Realm! How is this possible!\u201dAfter Bai Weiwei talked to her parents, she held the spirit sword and shouted at Ma Hongliang and the others, \u201cHow do you want to die?\u201dJust now, she had heard very clearly at the door that these people were not only ungrateful, but also had repeatedly harmed her family.This time, the new and old grudges would be settled together.Bai Weiwei had wanted to kill them long ago.\u201cHahaha, little girl, you are just bluffing. It\u2019s laughable to hear such arrogant words from a girl of such a young age.\u201cYou\u2019re indeed a genius but many geniuses died before they grew up!\u201dAlthough the black-clothed man was shocked by Bai Weiwei\u2019s talent, he wasn\u2019t afraid since his strength was at the seventh level of the Golden Core Realm, far surpassing Bai Weiwei\u2019s half step into the Golden Core Realm.1As he released a powerful pressure, the people present felt suffocated.However, Bai Weiwei was not afraid at all. With the supreme-grade spirit sword given by Xuan Yi and the spirit energy that Xuan Yi had injected into it, the opponent\u2019s pressure had no effect on her.\u201cDie.\u201dBai Weiwei instantly activated the sword move that Xuan Yi had stored in the spirit sword.1A long sword energy dragon shot out, bringing with it a powerful wave of air.Wherever the sword energy passed, everything was annihilated!\u201cWhat! ! The power of Law Enforcement Realm! How is this possible?!\u201d Ma Hongliang and the black-clothed man from the White Bones Sect turned pale with fright!2They wanted to run immediately!Those below the Law Enforcement Realm were all ants, not to mention that her opponent was just at the seventh level of the Golden Core Realm. Being slashed by the sword energy, he died immediately.The sword move killed not only him, but also the elites of the Earth Rock Sect and White Bones Sect.Such a destructive power stunned the people in the Bai Clan.\u201cDaughter, this power is\u2026\u201d Bai Shuangxiong asked with a trembling voice. The powerful strength of the Law Enforcement Realm made it hard for him to breathe.\u201cIt\u2019s the protective sword energy that my master gave me!\u201dBai Weiwei smiled and told her parents everything that had happened.She didn\u2019t tell them how she had suffered in the past five years because she did not want her parents to worry.If Xuan Yi knew her filial piety, he would be pleased with his decision of taking Bai Weiwei as his disciple. She had a kind heart and was a devoted daughter!When Bai Shuangxiong and his wife found out that their daughter had become the disciple of the youngest genius elder in the sect, their smiles were as bright as a blooming chrysanthemum.\u201cFather! I can\u2019t stay for long. Now that the elites of the Earth Rock Sect and the White Bones Sect have all been eliminated\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have a way to deal with the rest of them!\u201d Bai Shuangxiong stroked his beard and said.1Being able to reunite with her family after five years, Bai Weiwei was grateful to Xuan Yi.If it wasn\u2019t for Xuan Yi, she would have died in the Profound Sword Sect\u2019s martial arts practice field that day.She cherished the time with her parents, but she missed her master even more.7After staying with her family for a few days and eliminating the remaining resistance of the Earth Rock Sect and the White Bones Sect, she embarked on the return journey to the sect with eagerness in her heart.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Bai Weiwei was eager to return.At this moment, she wished she had wings. She wanted to fly back to the Profound Sword Sect and hear Xuan Yi\u2019s teachings.She put all her strength into the flying sword and finally returned to the sect three days later.Before she could go to the back mountain, two women in silver plain robes walked from the opposite direction. Looking at their clothes, she knew they were inner sect disciples.\u201cHey, did you know? A mystic realm is about to open in our south domain,\u201d a female disciple with a ponytail said to her companion.\u201cOh? Are you talking about the Sage Mystic Realm?\u201d Her companion had freckles on her face. She looked bored and did not seem to care.\u201cYes, yes, yes, that\u2019s it. This is the most important thing in the southern domain now. We must prepare for it.\u201d The ponytail female disciple looked expectant.\u201cForget it. I heard about this mystic realm a few years ago. Our sect master said that this mystic realm is related to the treasures of our sect. It will never be opened. Otherwise, if it is seized by other sects of the southern domain, we will be the sinner of the sect,\u201d the freckled woman said indifferently.\u201cThat\u2019s old news. The opening of the mystic realm was discussed during the Sword Worship Assembly. It was only confirmed the day before yesterday. I\u2019ve heard that the sect master not only agreed to let the top 100 sects of the south domain to explore it, but that he has appointed Elder Xuan as the leader of this expedition,\u201d the ponytailed girl said excitedly, \u201cElder Xuan is powerful and extremely talented. You must know that among these elders, only Elder Xuan has the qualification to enter it. After all, this mystic realm only allows people under the age of 30 to enter.\u201d\u201cWhat! !\u201dAfter learning that Xuan Yi was going to lead a team to explore the mystic realm, the freckled girl widened her eyes. She said in admiration, \u201cNo wonder. So it\u2019s Elder Xuan who is leading the team. How did you know?\u201d\u201cHave you forgotten that my uncle is an elder of the sect? The news hasn\u2019t been announced yet. I only tell you.\u201d1Then, the disciple with a ponytail seemed to have thought of something. She grabbed her companion\u2019s hand and said in a low voice, \u201cThen\u2026 then we have to hurry up and apply. Otherwise, all the slots will be snatched by those sluts. Elder Xuan will be in great danger if that happens.\u201d2\u201cRight, right, right. Let\u2019s hurry up and apply. Elder Xuan needs us.\u201dBai Weiwei heard the disciples discussing some mystic realm as soon as she arrived at the sect.Of course, she didn\u2019t care about the mystic realm. However, when she heard that her master was going to lead the expedition, she got interested.\u201cHello, Senior Sisters.\u201d Bai Weiwei stepped forward and called out to them respectfully, \u201cI\u2019m Bai Weiwei. I want to ask you about the mystic realm you mentioned just now. What is it?\u201dThe two disciples were about to leave when they heard someone calling to them from behind. They were a little unhappy at the interruption. However, when they turned around, they saw that it was Bai Weiwei.Bai Weiwei was a famous figure now. Just the fact that she had been carried by Xuan Yi was enough to make many female disciples jealous.With this resentment in heart, how could they answer her question?The freckled girl\u2019s mouth twisted in anger as she shouted, \u201cCoquettish fox!\u201d.3Fortunately, her companions still remembered that the sect forbad private fights and stopped her, otherwise a fight would have started.Bai Weiwei was a little exasperated, but she was also pleased. Their jealousy showed that her master was very attractive. If they found out that she had slept in her master\u2019s bed, they would be furious.However, she remembered that when she was unconscious after the Sword Worship Assembly, there was a stream of strong and hot spirit energy running wildly in her body. Her heart had been beating so fast because that was her master\u2019s spirit energy, and it had her master\u2019s smell.8Recalling this, she blushed despite herself.The two inner disciples glanced at Bai Weiwei, then, they ignored her and said to themselves, \u201cLooks like she\u2019s thinking of men. We have nothing to say to her. Let\u2019s go. The sect master said that as long as we could defeat anyone who was chosen to go to the Sage Mystic Realm, we could replace him. Let\u2019s go to the Underground Palace to join in the fun.\u201d1\u201cYes, yes! I heard that Elder Xuan has gone into the forbidden zone of our sect to obtain important information about the Sage Mystic Realm. I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be able to see Elder Xuan for the next two days.\u201d\u201cWhat? You plan to challenge Elder Xuan? He\u2019s in the Law Enforcement Realm! In the entire sect, the most talented disciple under the age of thirty is only at the peak of Golden Core Realm.\u201d\u201cHehe, I just want to see Elder Xuan. As long as we can enter the Sage Mystic Realm with Elder Xuan, we\u2019ll get lots of benefits.\u201dThe two inner disciples left as they talked.Bai Weiwei watched them leave and fell into deep thought.Master is in the sect\u2019s forbidden zone?Sage Mystic Realm?Underground Palace competition?Bai Weiwei had planned to ask Xuan Yi how she could enter the mystic realm with him.But she quickly abandoned this idea.If she asked her master, perhaps her master would give a spot to her.But from what she had just heard, many disciples had been questioning her abilities due to her performance in the Sword Worship Assembly.It didn\u2019t matter if they questioned her, but she wouldn\u2019t allow it to impact her master\u2019s reputation!Bai Weiwei\u2019s eyes became firm.She thought to herself, \u201cI\u2019ll show everyone in the sect that I, Bai Weiwei, have the right to enter this mystic realm. I won\u2019t let them say that I get the spot because of my master!\u201dAt this moment, a majestic voice came from the sky. The owner of this voice was the sect master of the Profound Sword sect, Qing Xuzi.\u201cDisciples, I believe that everyone knows that the Sage Mystic Realm is about to open. This matter concerns the reputation and future of our sect. I hope that everyone takes it seriously.2\u201cAll the top 100 great sects of the south domain will participate in the exploration of the Mystic Realm this time. However, the quotas of each sect are different. Our sect has ten spots. The sect has already selected ten disciples from the last Sword Worship Assembly.\u201cHowever, considering that there will be some disciples who are not convinced by our selection, we have set up a competition in the Underground Palace for disciples to challenge the participants we have chosen! Anyone, either inner or outer sect disciples, can replace them as long as they can defeat the ten participants!1\u201cAlso, this mystic realm is restricted to those below the age of 30. People who do not meet the requirement must not attend the competition.\u201dAll the disciples of the sect, except for Xuan Yi who had yet to come back from the forbidden zone, heard the sect master\u2019s announcement.Although the news had been spreading all over the sect in the past two days, it was finally confirmed by the sect master. Immediately, many disciples registered for the competition.However, most of them were outer sect disciples of either Foundation Establishment Realm or Qi Condensation Realm because they wanted to take this opportunity to soar to the sky.Even though they might encounter life-threatening danger in the mystic realm, they would not hesitate to do so!After all, if cultivators couldn\u2019t face difficulties head-on, they had no right to be called cultivators!On the other hand, the outstanding disciples who had access to the cultivation resources in the sect weren\u2019t that enthusiastic.1The Saint Mystic Realm was tempting but it was very dangerous. They had the resources they needed, so why would they risk their lives to obtain more cultivation resources?Seeing the lack of interest in the outstanding disciples, Qing Xuzi felt bitter.Then, his eyes lit up and he said, \u201cAhem, this time, Xuan Yi will lead the expedition.\u201dHis voice was not loud, but when people heard it, it was like a drop of cold water falling into hot oil.The crowd immediately erupted.\u201cWhat? Elder Xuan is going too?\u201d\u201cF*ck, sect master, you should have told us earlier. If Elder Xuan is going, then the trip is like a garden tour, right?\u201d4\u201cOh my God, I\u2019ll go and register for the competition. I want to have a baby with Elder Xuan.\u201d\u201cOnly those under 30 years old can enter. No wonder Elder Xuan has to go. He is only in his early 20s, but he has broken through to the Law Enforcement Realm. I guess his talent is as good as Sage Li\u2019s, or even higher.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, elder Xuan is famous for his generosity. Even if we get nothing in the mystic realm, Elder Xuan will not let us return empty-handed. This is a sure win.\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201d\u2026Disciples swarmed to the entrance of the Underground Palace.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13With so many people going to register for the competition, Bai Weiwei naturally wouldn\u2019t fall behind.However, since she had just come back, she took some time to ask around and finally understood what the Sage Mystic Realm was. So, when she went to register, most of the disciples had finished the process.But it was still not too late.When Bai Weiwei came to the entrance of the Underground Palace, she saw only an inner sect senior, who was in charge of the registration. He was tidying up his things at the registration counter.Bai Weiwei said politely, \u201cHello, senior brother. I\u2019m here to register.\u201d\u201cOh? Come and register.\u201d Senior brother Liu from the inner sect didn\u2019t look up because he had already lost count of the number of people who had come to register recently. He was very busy!Thus, he pointed at a wooden tablet and gestured for her to write down her name.Bai Weiwei wrote her name and handed it over to him.When he saw the name Bai Weiwei on the wooden tablet, he looked up in surprise.He frowned and said, \u201cBai Weiwei?\u201dSenior brother Liu thought for a moment and decided he\u2019d stop her from signing up!The reason was very simple. After the Sword Worship Assembly, everyone in the sect knew Bai Weiwei and what she had done.Many people were shocked by the news that Elder Xuan had become her master.They were worried that after Bai Weiwei registered, Xuan Yi would privately take this disciple of his to explore the realm. After all, he had done this with Wang Hu and Lin Yingxue in the past, so they had a good reason to be worried.The Sage Mystic Realm was so important and they didn\u2019t want Bai Weiwei, a wastrel who couldn\u2019t even activate the seven-colored stone tablet, to steal a precious spot from them.Everyone who had signed up gave senior brother Liu a low-grade spirit stone. Although low-grade spirit stones weren\u2019t important to inner sect disciples, with so many people signing up, he had received a considerable amount of wealth in the last couple of days.To repay those disciples, he wouldn\u2019t let Bai Weiwei sign up for the competition!1In addition, he knew that Elder Xuan was currently in the sect\u2019s forbidden zone making preparations for the trip to the mystic realm.Thinking of this, Liu Yun knew what to do.\u201cAhem, Bai Weiwei, you\u2019d better wait until tomorrow to sign up. Moreover, with your strength, you\u2019d better not join in the fun. If you get hurt, you\u2019d complain to Elder Xuan!\u201d Liu Yun said expressionlessly.\u201cTomorrow? According to sect master\u2019s words, the deadline is today. Tomorrow is the Underground Palace Competition!\u201d Bai Weiwei said with a frown.Liu Yun was displeased when he saw Bai Weiwei was so stubborn, but he still said calmly, \u201cI\u2019m doing this for your own good. You\u2019re still young, so you should focus on building a good foundation. This expedition is very dangerous. If you get hurt, you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d\u201cSenior brother, you are wrong. We sword cultivators must first cultivate our heart and make it fearless. Only in this way can we follow the Sword Dao and make progress!\u201d Bai Weiwei said firmly.These words deeply stung Liu Yun.He was an inner sect disciple and had never believed in the sword in his hand. During a fight, he injured his foundation, and his cultivation strength stopped at the first level of the Golden Core Realm. After that, the sect gave him a good job considering that he had served the sect for dozens of years. Now, he had stopped seeking Dao, and spent all his time on earning spirt stones.Now, Bai Weiwei was talking about the Dao heart in front of him, which hurt his feelings.In his view, Bai Weiwei was just a lucky outer sect disciple. She did not have any background and her talent was not recognized by the seven-colored profound stone tablet. Her life changed just because she had a good master. Now, she actually dared to lecture him.Obviously, she had no respect for her seniors. This was simply outrageous!He angrily shouted, \u201cHumph! I said you can\u2019t register today.\u201dBai Weiwei got suspicious and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause, I\u2019m in charge of this. I have the final say!\u201d Liu Yun released the pressure of the first level of Golden Core Realm, trying to suppress her.He was not afraid. After all, Xuan Yi was in closed door cultivation, and the other sect elders would not stand up for a puny disciple at the\u00a0fifth level of Qi Condensation Realm.1More importantly, even if Elder Xuan was to hold him accountable, he would say that Bai Weiwei\u2019s strength was weak, and it would be a waste of the sect\u2019s resources to let her register. After all, no one would think a disciple at the fifth level of Qi Condensation Realm was a genius.1But what surprised him was that Bai Weiwei, at the fifth level of Qi Condensation Realm, was actually able to withstand his pressure.It must be known that even a Foundation Establishment Realm disciple wouldn\u2019t dare to face the imposing pressure of a Golden Core Realm cultivator.Then, Liu Yun saw the spirit sword in Bai Weiwei\u2019s hand. It was a supreme grade sword, which further confirmed his previous conjecture.This girl was merely relying on Elder Xuan. If not for this spirit sword, she would have spewed blood and died under his pressure.Bai Weiwei did not know what he was thinking.This bit of pressure from him felt like a breeze as she activated the Supreme Yin Scripture. She felt no pressure at all.However, she didn\u2019t want to argue with him. Since he didn\u2019t let her register, then she wouldn\u2019t register.In any case, according to the sect master, she only needed to defeat one of the ten participants to get a spot.1Tomorrow morning, powerful inner sect disciples would come and challenge the participants in the Underground Palace.She would just wait and defeat one of them.She didn\u2019t believe that with the supreme cultivation technique and the supreme-grade spirit sword that her master gave her, she couldn\u2019t defeat a few inner sect disciples.Although Bai Weiwei had been busy with her own matters these past few days, she had never stopped cultivating.In her opinion, the Supreme Yin Scripture was very powerful. Every time she cultivated it, she would gain deeper understanding of it, as if it was a cultivation technique specially designed for her.4Her master had chose this wonderful cultivation technique for her. She was grateful to her master\u2019s consideration and hoped that she would not let him down.Although she did not care about her own reputation, she cherished her master\u2019s reputation especially after he had helped her so much. As a disciple, she could only use her abilities to show everyone that her master was right.Therefore, she turned around and walked to the entrance of the Underground Palace with the sword in her hand.She stood there with her eyes closed, waiting for other disciples to come and attend the competition in the Underground Palace!Liu Yun shook his head and said with a chuckle, \u201cWhat a joke. You wouldn\u2019t pass the Underground Palace test just because you come early. Although you are the personal disciple of an elder, your strength is too weak to fight with the inner sect disciples.\u201cMoreover, without the registration nameplate, you don\u2019t even have the qualification to challenge!\u201dHowever, Bai Weiwei, stood there in a white robe, didn\u2019t hear him. At this moment, she was practicing the Supreme Yin Scripture again and again, preparing for the big battle tomorrow.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14At the entrance of the Underground Palace, the scenery was beautiful and the surroundings were very quiet. Under the bright moon, everything looked poetic and picturesque.However, Liu Yun was a little depressed. His job was to register the disciples and arrange the disciples who had registered to compete with the disciples who had been selected to enter the Mystic Realm!However, Bai Weiwei was blocking the entrance of the Underground Palace without a nameplate, which made it difficult for him to carry on with his work.At this moment, the sky had brightened and the assessment would begin.Bai Weiwei did not know if Liu Yun had a nameplate or not, but when he came close, she immediately drew her sword and charged forward.The blade flashed with a cold light and dominating sword energy.In an instant, it arrived in front of Liu Yun.When Liu Yun saw this, his eyes were filled with disdain. He drew his sword to block it.Bang! !The sword aura followed the sword heart. Bai Weiwei\u2019s swordsmanship was superb, and her sword heart was strong.Even though Liu Yun was at the first level of Golden Core Realm, he had not honed his swordsmanship for many years, and his cultivation had long been lax. How could he be her match?After the sparks settled down, the result was obvious.She pressed the ice-cold sword blade at Liu Yun\u2019s neck.Liu Yun swallowed, not daring to look at the girl.At this moment, he felt nothing but fear.He had only seen a resplendent sword light and didn\u2019t even see how she moved.Moreover, this sword light was cold and pure without a trace of spiritual energy in it. In just a single exchange, she had defeated him. How could he not be afraid?She had defeated him with her superb sword technique. Moreover, he had been rude to her yesterday. If she wanted, she could behead him immediately!However, Bai Weiwei was not a bloodthirsty person, nor was she a killing maniac.Her plan was very simple.Didn\u2019t he say that she could not participate in the competition? Then she would fight with other disciples and take nameplates from them. Then they would take her seriously!\u201cAccording to the sect master\u2019s announcement, those who are incapable are not allowed to participate in the Underground Palace competition. You have already lost. Please hand over your nameplate. Otherwise, you will bear the consequences!\u201d Bai Weiwei said indifferently.\u201cI, don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t have a nameplate.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Bai Weiwei frowned and knocked him out.You, at the first level of Golden Core Realm, came here without a nameplate. You asked for it.And at this time, disciples began to arrived each with an emerald green jade plate with their names engraved on it.Without a word, Bai Weiwei picked up her spirit sword and walked towards the next disciple.Very soon, one disciple after another was mercilessly challenged by Bai Weiwei. Her sword technique was outstanding, and her sword heart was unbreakable. With the support of the Supreme Yin Scripture, it wasn\u2019t difficult for her to fight against someone of a higher level than hers. Moreover, these disciples were all in the Foundation Establishment Realm, so defeating them was a piece of cake for her.\u2026In less than half an hour, Bai Weiwei had taken dozens of nameplates from disciples of Foundation Establishment Realm.And the news began to spread in the sect.\u201cHave you heard? There\u2019s a senior sister guarding the entrance of the Underground Palace. Any disciple who tried to get close to the Underground Palace was defeated by her exquisite sword technique. No one can enter! Now she has dozens of nameplates.\u201d\u201cYeah, He Long and Yang Mu were both defeated by her. They didn\u2019t last three moves!\u201d\u201cWhat? Yang Mu is the First Elder\u2019s disciple, and He Long\u2019s master is the Second Elder. Although they are at the Foundation Establishment Realm, they have the ability to kill enemies of a higher level. Who can defeat these two in a row?\u201d A disciple asked.\u201cTCH, they are just a group of Foundation Establishment Realm trash. She has dozens of nameplates in her hands, huh? I\u2019ll take them from her,\u201d a disciple at the first level of Golden Core Realm said disdainfully.\u201cHehe, what a joke. Don\u2019t embarrass yourself with your first level of Golden Core Realm cultivation. She\u2019d beat you with one finger. Do you know whom this senior sister fought in the first battle? Liu Yun! Liu Yun has been at the first level of Golden Core Realm for dozens of years, yet he couldn\u2019t even withstand a single move from the girl! She is simply a killing machine!\u201d A disciple explained.\u201cWhat! When do we have such an awesome person in our sect? Who on earth is she?\u201d The disciple, who had been confident that he could defeat Bai Weiwei, panicked.\u201cBai Weiwei.\u201dHearing this name, everyone present gasped, widening their eyes in shock.After the Sword Worship Assembly, everyone knew Bai Weiwei\u2019s name. Not only was she not able to activate the seven-colored profound stone tablet, she did not even participate in the third test. But now, she had defeated two genius disciples in a row, and was even able to defeat people of a higher level!How could this not shock them!One had to know that Bai Weiwei had been only at the fifth level of the Qi Condensation Realm. Only a few days had passed, and she was already half a step into the Golden Core Realm.It was really infuriating.But when they remembered that Bai Weiwei\u2019s master was Xuan Yi, they didn\u2019t find it surprising.After all, Elder Xuan was a genius who was even more talented than Bai Weiwei. No wonder Bai Weiwei was so powerful; she had an even more powerful master.In fact, they\u2019d be surprised if Bai Weiwei couldn\u2019t defeat these disciples.It was just that they couldn\u2019t accept the fact that a wastrel had become a genius in a few days.\u201cBut why is she blocking the entrance to the Underground Palace?\u201d A disciple asked in puzzlement.Other disciples had the same question. No one knew what this girl was up to.\u201cLet\u2019s go and take a look.\u201dA group of disciples who loved to watch a good show headed to the Underground Palace.In front of the Underground Palace, Bai Weiwei stood there dressed in her white robe. Her black hair danced wildly in the wind and her eyes were closed.During the battles, her spirit energy had been tempering her meridians. At this moment, her body was in the state of soothing qi and transforming it into spirit energy, and there were signs of a breakthrough.Then, she opened her eyes, and a fierce sword intent flashed in her eyes. A large amount of spirit energy moved around her and then surged into her body.She was on the verge of breaking through to the Golden Core Realm!Previously, Xuan Yi had had guided her meridians and activated her Supreme Yin physique. After cultivating the wondrous Supreme Yin Scripture, she had advanced to this stage.Bai Weiwei was pleased, knowing that she was just a few days away from breaking through to the Golden Core Realm.She was even more in awe and admiration of her master, determined to follow her master all her life.She looked at the nameplates she had obtained. There were eighty-two of them, and most of them were from the disciples of the Foundation Establishment Realm.Bai Weiwei glanced at her fellow disciples who had rushed over and said coolly, \u201cOne at a time is too troublesome. I\u2019ll fight all ten of you at the same time.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The inner sect disciples asked in disbelief.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Bai Weiwei said it not because she got arrogant after gaining her great strength.It was because the majority of the inner sect disciples present were below the age of thirty years old, and most of them were only at the first or second level of the Golden Core Realm. Those who were at the intermediate or even high stage of the Golden core Realm were all over thirty years old, thus they had not been chosen to enter the Sage Mystic Realm.As for the other Golden Core Realm cultivators who were over the age of thirty, they naturally would not challenge them.However, when the proud inner sect disciples heard Bai Weiwei\u2019s words, they thought differently.They thought that Bai Weiwei had broken through by taking the secret medicine that Elder Xuan had bestowed upon her. Now, her cultivation level wasn\u2019t stable yet, but she was so arrogant, even boasting that she\u2019d challenge ten inner sect disciples at the same time.Did she really think that she was a genius? Those below thirty years old who could reach the Golden Core Realm were highly talented. How could they bow to a girl?However, most of the disciples present were at the Foundation Establishment Realm. In addition, the scene of Bai Weiwei defeating Liu Yun with one sword strike was still vivid in their minds. They didn\u2019t dare to say anything despite their anger.At this time, a man appeared.\u201cI haven\u2019t been out for a long time and it seems that anyone can bluff openly in the sect.\u201d A man dressed in black and looked to be about 23 years old walked out.What attracted people\u2019s attention was that this person carried a two-meter-long giant sword on his back. It looked very fierce.\u201cThis\u2026 is the Beheading Great Sword. Could it be that he is Long Tian, the Ghost Hand? My God, why did this fierce person come here?\u201d1\u201cWho is Long Tian the Ghost Hand? Is he very powerful?\u201d3\u201cYou don\u2019t know Long Tian the Ghost Hand? He is a genius appearing as the same time as Elder Xuan. However, he was defeated by Elder Xuan in the grand competition. He got rid of his original cultivation strength and began to cultivate again, just make a new start! Don\u2019t underestimate him just because he is only at the first level of Golden Core Realm. Lots of geniuses have died under his Beheading Great Sword,\u201d a disciple quickly explained to others in a low voice.\u201cHehe, Ghost Hand, she is mine. If you know what\u2019s good for you, quickly get out of the way. Otherwise, you\u2019ll get another taste of thunder from me.\u201d A mocking voice came from the sky.Although they only heard the voice, no one present dared to say anything! Not even Long Tian the Ghost Hand!It was because the person was Murong Lei the Thunder Sword! His cultivation was at the second level of the Golden Core Realm!What made people fearful was not his cultivation strength, but his background.It was said that Murong Lei\u2019s spirit energy contained a trace of lightning. When he broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, he he was struck by lightning and almost died. Elder Xuan cherished his talent and saved his life, intending to take him in as his eldest disciple. However, Murong Lei was proud and refused Xuan Yi\u2019s offer; he even said that he would one day surpass Xuan Yi, so he didn\u2019t need to become anyone\u2019s disciple!In the following years, Murong Lei revealed his talent, but he was still not as good as Xuan Yi.Later on, he knew that the higher the cultivation level, the more difficult it would be and he began to admire Xuan Yi.Although Murong Lei did not have any outstanding battle achievements, he was the first disciple that Elder Xuan had intended to take in, which was enough to make him proud!2Although he regretted missing out on becoming Xuan Yi\u2019s disciple, as proud as he was, he would never say it out loud.After the recent leveling up, what he wanted to do the most now was to defeat all of Xuan Yi\u2019s disciples to prove himself!When the disciples saw that it was Murong Lei, they were extremely excited, especially those who knew of his relationship with Bai Weiwei. They were all looking forward to this big battle.Murong Lei glanced at Bai Weiwei and said with contempt, \u201cJudging from the way you hold your sword, I can tell that you are not good at swordsmanship. Tsk! Tsk! It turns out Xuan Yi\u2019s disciples are so useless, huh? He even took in someone who knows nothing about swordsmanship. What a joke.\u201dThese words were extremely harsh to Bai Weiwei\u2019s ears. She was displeased not for her own sake but because of his contempt for her master!He actually dared to call her master by his name!Bai Weiwei\u2019s eyes were filled with a shocking chill!She\u2019d cripple anyone who dared to disrespect her master!2\u201cLet\u2019s begin!\u201d Bai Weiwei said firmly.Without holding back, she released her spirit energy and poured it into the supreme-grade spirit sword.She compressed the spirit energy as much as she could, condensing it into a resplendent white light!She made a slash, and a long rainbow of sword energy shot out!Like a long dragon, it shot straight towards Murong Lei.Seeing this exquisite sword attack, Murong Lei\u2019s pupils expanded with fear and excitement.He was afraid because he knew he could not dodge this attack at all. He was excited because he saw from this sword technique a sword intent that he would never be able to comprehend in his entire life!This sword intent was naturally not Bai Weiwei\u2019s. It was left behind by Xuan Yi when he was treating her injuries. He hoped that Bai Weiwei would be able to understand it as soon as possible.Murong Lei knew that this sword intent belonged to Xuan Yi. However, he was astonished that there was actually someone in this world who could directly pass on a sword intent to others.At this moment, his face turned pale with great regret.What he regretted was not that his skills were inferior, but that he had refused to become Xuan Yi\u2019s disciple.3This regret had turned into a great pain.At the second level of the Golden Core Realm, he couldn\u2019t even withstand a single sword attack from Xuan Yi\u2019s new disciple.How the f*ck could he continue his cultivation?!Murong Lei felt extremely bitter.Seeing this scene, Long Tian the Ghost Hand was so scared that his eyeballs almost popped out.1After all, his strength was not much different from Murong Lei\u2019s. Just now, he had boasted shamelessly, saying that Bai Weiwei was a nobody. But her strength was frightening.He hurriedly threw down his nameplate. When the others saw this, they did the same. So Bai Weiwei got all of the one hundred nameplates.Standing in the crowd, Ma Liang saw what had happened.At this moment, he was a little afraid of Bai Weiwei, but he didn\u2019t conceal the deep hatred in his eyes.Not long ago, he received a letter from his family which said that more than half of the elites of the Earth Rock Sect and the White Bone Sect had been slaughtered by her.How could he not hate her! !\u201cBai Weiwei, you dare to kill people of my clan. So don\u2019t blame me for doing this!\u201dHe immediately injected spirit energy into his voice transmission stone.\u201cElder Ma, I found Bai Weiwei. She is currently at the Underground Palace. Elder Ma, please display your strength and kill her to avenge my clan!\u201d Ma Liang gritted his teeth and said.\u201cHumph! The b*tch actually dared to kill my junior brother. I\u2019ll make her pay with her life! !\u201d A furious shout came from the voice transmission stone.3Then, a white shadow flew toward the Underground Palace.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16In the Underground Palace, Bai Weiwei\u2019s heart skipped a beat as she felt a strong killing aura enveloping her.What was going on?Who would dare to release such a strong killing aura in the sect?She looked toward the killing aura and saw that it was from Ma Liang.As the saying went, when enemies meet, their eyes turn red with hatred.Ma Liang\u2019s eyes were as red as a devil from Hell.\u201cBai Weiwei! You killed my clansmen and my parents. Do you know the sect protects all its disciples and their families? You violated the sect rule by doing this!\u201d Ma Liang shouted. He knew that he was not her match, so he could only use this method to restrain her until Elder Ma came.Bai Weiwei narrowed her eyes. When she returned home this time, she knew that Ma Liang and Ma Wuliang had set her up. The decline in her strength was caused by them. If it were not for her master, she would have become a wastrel long ago.This kind of hatred was irreconcilable, so she didn\u2019t waste her time to reason with him!She\u00a0pulled out the spirit sword and shouted, \u201cIn that case, the grudge between you and me will be settled here! Let\u2019s fight until one of us dies!\u201dMa Liang was covered in sweat. He had just seen Bai Weiwei defeat Murong Lei with one sword move, so he didn\u2019t dare to fight Bai Weiwei.\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026\u201d Ma Liang was so nervous that he was at a loss for what to do. Step by step, he retreated. Thinking quickly, he hurriedly said, \u201cYou are powerful because of the supreme-grade spirit sword given by your master. If you are really good, then have a life and death battle with me without using the spirit sword!\u201cIt\u2019s not a fair fight if you use the powerful spirit sword!\u201d Ma Liang rolled his eyes and hurriedly added.\u201cIf you\u2019re really good, then fight me only with cultivation strength!\u201dWhen the disciples heard this, they were astonished.They felt that there must be some old grudge between these two, otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t propose a life-and-death battle.It was a battle taken on the Profound Sword Sect\u2019s fighting arena, and the two parties would go on fighting until one of them died!If people had a life-and-death grudge, they would resolved it at the fighting arena. Such things happened rarely and the arena opened only once in a few years.\u2026Those disciples who had been defeated by Bai Weiwei began to shout that their lost because of her powerful weapon.Bai Weiwei didn\u2019t want them to slander her master, so she said, \u201cAs you wish. I won\u2019t use the spirit sword.\u201dWithout waiting for an answer, Bai Weiwei moved forward and arrived in front of Ma Liang instantly.Then, she struck straight at him with her palm.The move wasn\u2019t fast, but Ma Liang froze in astonishment because he found that he couldn\u2019t move.No matter how much spirit energy he injected into his legs, they just couldn\u2019t move an inch.At this moment, he realized how big the difference between his and Bai Weiwei\u2019s strength was.Bai Weiwei didn\u2019t need any external help to defeat him.At this moment, a powerful voice came, \u201cBastard! You dare to commit murder inside the sect? You\u2019re so vicious and heartless. I\u2019ll teach you a lesson on behalf of your master!\u201dThe speaker was Ma Wuliang.He instantly appeared in the air above the Underground Palace and threw a palm strike at Bai Weiwei.The vast palm force made people suspect that this palm was really meant to kill Bai Weiwei instead of teaching her a lesson.His sudden appearance stunned everyone present.Before they could figure out what was happening, Elder Ma had struck out furiously.Just as everyone thought that Bai Weiwei was about to die, an even more powerful pressure swept over.Ma Wuliang\u2019s palm force instantly disappeared under this immense pressure.Bai Weiwei heaved a sigh of relief.She knew that her master had made a move.\u201cAre you worthy of teaching my disciple a lesson?\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s voice exploded in front of the huge Underground Palace.\u201cWhat\u2026 What\u2019s going on? Why is this pressure so terrifying?\u201dSome of the weaker disciples almost knelt down under the pressure.What kind of pressure was this?Under this pressure, even their breathing became shallow.One had to know that Xuan Yi wasn\u2019t present. If he was here personally, then they wouldn\u2019t even be able to breathe.If Ma Wuliang\u2019s pressure was like the light of a firefly, then Xuan Yi\u2019s terrifying pressure was like the bright light from the moon!4The two were simply not on the same level!On the arena, Ma Wuliang\u2019s eyes widened as he looked at Bai Weiwei\u2019 spirit sword in disbelief.It turned out that Xuan Yi had engraved his own spirit energy imprint on the supreme-grade spirit sword that he had given to Bai Weiwei. Through this imprint, he was able to transport such a terrifyingly powerful strength from the sword.If he personally arrived, he could kill Ma Wuliang with a single strike!Heavens, it had only been a few days since they last met, but Xuan Yi\u2019s strength had actually increased to such a terrifying height!He was truly the number one genius of the Profound Sword Sect!At this moment, Ma Wuliang was not in the mood to admire Xuan Yi\u2019s genius because they had become enemies!Ma Wuliang\u2019s mind raced and he knew that he couldn\u2019t kill Bai Weiwei right now. He\u2019d find another opportunity to do it.1He glanced at Ma Liang, who was so frightened that he had wet his pants. Seeing this, he was even more resentful.If it wasn\u2019t for this bastard, he wouldn\u2019t have offended such a powerful master!He could only bite the bullet and say to the spirit sword, \u201cElder Xuan, it\u2019s a misunderstanding. It\u2019s a misunderstanding\u2026\u201dXuan Yi was speechless. How could it be a misunderstanding? If not for his precautions, his good disciple would have been killed by Ma Wuliang.There was no need to say anything!He shook his head and used his mind to control the spirit sword.The spirit sword stood up in the air and flew to Bai Weiwei\u2019s side.He transmitted his voice to her, \u201cWeiwei, as a sword cultivator, you should never let go of your sword.\u201dBai Weiwei\u2019s face turned red, feeling ashamed, but when she heard what Xuan Yi said next, she was thrilled.\u201cMy disciples always avenge themselves. Pick up the spirit sword to avenge yourself and your master will help you!\u201dThe spirit sword came before Bai Weiwei, and she took it with red-rimmed eyes.At this moment, she felt her master\u2019s powerful strength and monstrous sword intent!When she slashed, and a sword aura that was hundreds of meters long appeared out of thin air.Ma Wuliang and Ma Liang watched it in shock and hatred until it shattered the two of them into pieces.Bai Weiwei\u2019s eyes were moist. Not only did Xuan Yi give her a chance to kill her enemies, he had also taught her how to use her spirit energy to launch the sword move.Deeply touched, she worshipped Xuan Yi even more.The many disciples present were dumbstruck by what they saw.Elder Xuan\u2019s sword intent had killed Elder Ma, who was also in the Law Enforcement Realm. How could this not shock them? More importantly, to protect Bai Weiwei, a disciple he had just taken in, Xuan Yi had attached a wisp of his soul to her spirit sword.A powerful master had the final say in any issue, and Xuan Yi undoubtedly had the most powerful battle strength in the entire sect.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Ma Liang and Ma Wuliang were instantly killed.The air was filled with the smell of blood, adding a sense of solemnity to the quietness before the Underground Palace.The screams of Ma Liang and Ma Wuliang before they died and the final explosion attracted the attention of most of the people in the sect.The disciples in the Underground Palace were wide-eyed and dumbstruck. Their eyes were filled with not only shock but infinite fear as well.A disciple had killed inside the sect, and the person who was killed was actually an elder of the sect.Even though Elder Xuan Yi had helped, Bai Weiwei was the one who launched the sword move.How could this not make them panic?!They only saw Bai Weiwei slash her sword and kill Elder Ma.And life-and-death fight inside the sect was a great crime, not to mention killing an elder.At best, her cultivation would be removed, and at worst, she would be executed!Qing Xuzi also flew over to the site.He was thinking about the matter of the Sage Mystic Realm when he felt a strong spirit energy fluctuation inside the sect.He thought it was caused by a genius disciple, but soon he was furious because Elder Ma\u2019s soul lamp went out.The sect was already in a life-and-death crisis, and now they had internal fights.It was not only a challenge to his authority, it had also reduced the number of Law Enforcement Realm masters in the sect.They\u2026 They had absolutely no regard for the sect rules.Qing Xuzi\u2019s white hair and long beard stood up as he released an aura of the Sect Master Realm and people under this pressure found it difficult to breathe.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on!?\u201d Qing Xuzi\u2019s imposing voice was very cold.He believed that some disciples had colluded with their enemy. Otherwise, who would be able to kill Elder Ma right under his nose with only one move?The disciples looked at each other, trembling but didn\u2019t dare to say anything. It was obvious that they were scared. However, the disciples who didn\u2019t like Bai Weiwei yelled, \u201cSect Master, Elder Ma was killed by Bai Weiwei. I suspect that she is a spy from another sect. She violated our sect\u2019s rules with the protection move given to her by Elder Xuan!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Sect Master. She even crippled Murong Lei just now. She must be a spy. You know how talented senior brother Murong is.\u201d1\u201cThat\u2019s right! She must have come to slaughter the geniuses of our Profound Sword Sect since the Sage Mystic Realm is about to open.\u201d\u2026A group of indignant disciples began to complain to the sect. Some even hoped that the sect master would kill Bai Weiwei on the spot.Qing Xuzi\u2019s eyes turned gloomy.He was furious that such a thing had happened. However, considering that Bai Weiwei was Xuan Yi\u2019s new disciple and that he needed Xuan Yi\u2019s help with the Sage Mystic Realm, he could only ask, \u201cBai Weiwei, did you kill Ma Wuliang and Ma Liang?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Bai Weiwei answered without thinking.She didn\u2019t want to make things difficult for her master, so she took the responsibility.Hearing Bai Weiwei\u2019s quick admission, Qing Xuzi was even more displeased. At the same time, he was also greatly disappointed with Xuan Yi.Even though Bai Weiwei had advanced to half-step Golden Core Realm in a few days, he felt that this girl\u2019s character was not good. He thought that Xuan Yi hadn\u2019t tested her character before taking her as a disciple, which was why he was disappointed with Xuan Yi.Just as he was thinking about how to deal with her, Bai Weiwei said in a grave voice, \u201cSect Master, this person has a great enmity with me, and has repeatedly set me up. I had to kill him!\u201d\u201cBullsh*t, Elder Ma is highly respected, how could he harm a young girl like you? You\u2019re lying!\u201d\u201cYes, Elder Ma is dead and can\u2019t speak for himself. Sect Master, you can\u2019t believe her words. This woman is lying!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We must torture her and dig out the forces behind her. She killed one of our elders and we must kill her!\u201d\u2026The disciples began to issue judgement before Qing Xuzi could speak.However, Qing Xuzi raised his hand and gestured them to be quiet.With a determined gaze, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a chance to prove your innocence. Speak.\u201dThus, Bai Weiwei told them how Ma Liang had targeted her all these years, how Ma Wuliang had harmed her, how her family had been suppressed, why she had blocked the entrance to the Underground Palace and defeated many of her senior and junior brothers\u2026She told him everything except her master Xuan Yi\u2019s role in it.Qing Xuzi was a very smart person. After hearing her story and what he knew of Elder Ma\u2019s background, he believed most of what she said.He was even more shocked, though!The disciple with the Supreme Yin Physique had her physique destroyed after entering the extreme Yang forbidden zone, but she could still recover her previous physique!Qing Xuzi believed most of of her words, but the disciples didn\u2019t want to believe it, especially those who had been defeated by Bai Weiwei. They just wanted her dead.\u201cSect Master, her story is one-sided and you can\u2019t believe it. Her strength must be removed for violating the sect rules!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. If she gets away with it, it\u2019s unfair to the other disciples! It will be a disgrace to our sect which has a history of thousands of years!\u201d\u201cSect Master, please punish her severely. Remove her cultivation, chop off her limbs, and kick her out of the sect!\u201d3\u2026Sensing the fury of the disciples, Qing Xuzi also realized that the ones who shouted the loudest were the disciples who had been defeated by Bai Weiwei.Moreover, he sensed a familiar spirit aura in the air and knew that this was Xuan Yi\u2019s doing.On one side was the sect genius that he valued, and on the other side were the sect\u2019s disciples. If this issue wasn\u2019t handled properly, it would be detrimental to the sect\u2019s development.Therefore, he thought of a compromise.\u201cBai Weiwei, you just said that some people tried to stop you from registering for the mystic realm assessment, so you blocked the entrance to the Underground Palace.\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard to gain your current strength. If Elder Ma and Ma Liang really attacked you first, it\u2019s not your fault that they died.\u201cNow, I\u2019ll give you a chance. If you can challenge the remaining nine disciples and defeat them, then I will let bygones be bygones. How about it?\u201dBai Weiwei was stunned at first, then she said firmly, \u201cI, Bai Weiwei, accept the challenge!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Hearing Bai Weiwei\u2019s firm reply, Qing Xuzi said loudly, \u201cYou better think carefully. The remaining nine disciples are all outstanding disciples in the sect. If you get hurt, don\u2019t regret your decision.\u201dOf course, he wasn\u2019t concerned about Bai Weiwei. He had said those words for Xuan Yi to hear. After all, if Bai Weiwei got hurt, with Xuan Yi\u2019s protectiveness of his disciples, he would definitely hold Qing Xuzi accountable.\u201cOf course. If my skills are not good enough, it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault that I get injured,\u201d Bai Weiwei said lightly.However, her calm reply displeased some disciples.The disciples who were selected to enter the Sage Mystic Realm were all outstanding disciples of the Profound Sword Sect. And the candidates she had defeated before were mostly outstanding outer sect disciples, not inner sect disciples.1The nine disciples were outstanding inner sect cultivators, not some small fry from the outer sect!Three of them were even the direct disciples of the elders. All of them were extremely talented and could easily defeat a mere half-step Golden Core Realm disciple.\u201cHahaha, this is hilarious. This girl actually dared to agree, what a joke!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, one at the fourth level of the Golden Core Realm, two at the third level of the Golden Core Realm, five at the second level of the Golden Core Realm, and one at the first level of the Golden Core Realm. These top disciples all have the ability to fight people with levels higher than theirs. Where does she get her confidence?\u201d\u201cRight, Xia Hanning, the senior sister who\u2019s at the fourth level of the Golden Core Realm, is especially good. She is the strongest disciple among those under thirty years old. She\u2019s the Second Elder\u2019s personal disciple. I guess Bai Weiwei can\u2019t last three moves when she fights against Xia Hanning.\u201d\u201cThree moves? You think too highly of her. At most, one move. Senior sister Xia\u2019s swordsmanship is extraordinary. She killed enemies of her level every ten steps in the Demon Sect. This time, senior sister Xia won\u2019t need three moves to defeat this fake golden core disciple.\u201d4\u201cTsk, I think senior sister Xia doesn\u2019t need to make a move. Look at the cultivator of the third level of Golden Core Realm beside her. His name is Murong Tian, Murong Lei\u2019s elder brother. He will avenge his younger brother who had been crippled by Bai Weiwei! You have to know that the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique that the two of them practice together is invincible. They even have the strength to fight against senior sister Xia. Perhaps, he will slash Bai Weiwei\u2019s throat with one sword move!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think the scenes you guys just described will happen. Look at that the senior brother at the first level of Golden Core Realm. He looks lazy but he\u2019s actually extraordinary. His name is Di Si. He was born with double pupils. Not long ago, he awakened his dao and seems to have the potential to become a super master. Now, the First Elder has taken him in as a personal disciple. The First Eder said that this guy\u2019s talent is even higher than Elder Xuan\u2019s.\u201d2\u201cIs he really that strong?\u201d\u201cOf course, he has inherited from the Blood Sword Emperor. Bai Weiwei will challenge him when she sees his relatively lower cultivation level and then there will definitely be a big battle. Moreover, the First Elder doesn\u2019t like Elder Xuan. If Bai Weiwei loses this battle, then Elder Xuan will probably be impeached by the Council of Elders!\u201d\u2026With a frown, Qing Xuzi announced the start of the challenge under everyone\u2019s expectant eyes.\u201cBai Weiwei, since you\u2019re the challenger, you can choose an opponent.\u201dBai Weiwei glanced at the nine people. Some had powerful auras, some looked indifferent, and some looked disdainful. However, They all looked extremely confident. Obviously, they had absolute confidence in their own strengths!The disciples in the audience had mocking expressions on their faces, as if they were watching a show.A fake Golden Core Realm cultivator against nine strong cultivators. They thought she couldn\u2019t fight even one of them, not to mention nine. No one thought Bai Weiwei would win.\u201cHMPH! B*tch, you dared to cripple my younger brother. If you dare, come and fight with your grandpa Murong,\u201d Murong Tian roared, hoping that she would challenge him so that he could kill her to avenge his brother!\u201cYour younger brother Murong Lei is a good-for-nothing and a fool. He couldn\u2019t even defeat a fake Golden Core Realm cultivator. He\u2019s really trash. He\u2019s a waste of resources. It\u2019s better not to have him,\u201d Di Si mocked lazily.Hearing Di Si\u2019s words, Murong Tian didn\u2019t dare to say anything.Although Di Si\u2019s cultivation strength was inferior to Murong Tian\u2019s, he had greater combat strength. More importantly, he was the disciple that the elders thought could replace Elder Xuan. How dared he talk back to Di Si?\u201cDi Si, watch your words. The sect needs to be united to get through this crisis. Don\u2019t talk nonsense,\u201d Senior Sister Xia said in a deep voice.\u201cHehe, watch my words? What a joke. I have the potential to become a great emperor and will become the leader of the sect. You dare to lecture me? Humph! I\u2019m not afraid even if her master Xuan Yi is here!\u201dA powerful aura rushed over, suppressing Xia Hanning. Her heart hurt at this great pressure.At this moment, Bai Weiwei pointed her sword at Di Si and said, \u201cDid you just call my master by his name?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Di Si glanced from the corner of his eye. The girl actually dared to lecture him, which roused his interest.\u201cHehe, call him by his name? So what? I\u2019m a personal disciple of an elder, and I\u2019m destined to lead the sect to rise in the future!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll defeat you with only one sword strike!\u201dHearing these words, everyone present gasped.They were both geniuses. If this confrontation was not handled well, there might be casualties, which would be a great loss to the sect.Qing Xuzi felt his head began to ache.\u201cAhem, Bai Weiwei, are you sure? Are you really going to challenge Di Si?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Bai Weiwei said indifferently, \u201cOnly the weak challenges the strong.\u201cI\u2019m giving him a chance to challenge me!\u201dImmediately, the whole place was in an uproar.This girl simply didn\u2019t know how to spell the word \u2018death\u2019.How could anyone call Di Si weak? Even senior sister Xia didn\u2019t dare to offend him just now. It was obvious that her battle strength wasn\u2019t as high as Di Si\u2019s.Bai Weiwei actually dared to speak in such a manner. She had offended all nine of them.Di Si\u2019s eyes turned red and his killing intent began to condense. It was obvious that he was in a state of rampage.At this moment, a handsome man was stunned and put down the scroll he had been reading.He was Xuan Yi. He was in the mysterious forbidden zone of the sect, looking up information about the Sage Mystic Realm.Although he was busy, his mind had never left Bai Weiwei.When he saw that his disciple was going to fight against nine Golden Core Realm genius disciples, he could not help but shake his head and laugh. \u201cThis girl is not bad. Like me, she is fearless before dangers. I wonder if she has mastered the Tai Yin scripture or not and what her potential is. Well, I\u2019ll put aside the matter of the mystic realm for the moment. I\u2019ll see how she deals with the situation.\u201dTherefore, he put down the scroll and focused all his awareness on the Underground Palace.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Di Si said with a ferocious expression, \u201cThe weak challenges the strong! Well said. Little wastrel, I\u2019ll let you see what a really strong person looks like.\u201dHe shot out toward Bai Weiwei, leaving behind a string of blood-colored afterimages.So strong!Xia Hanning and the others\u2019 hearts jumped. They had never regarded him as an ordinary cultivator of the first level of the Golden Core Realm, but they still underestimated him. The talent of a great emperor master was indeed extraordinary!Murong Lei even had a trace of fear in his eyes as he realized that his and Murong Lei\u2019s Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique could not even catch up to his shadow!However, Bai Weiwei condensed her cultivation strength and faced him head-on!The audience had only one word on their minds.Stupid!Di Si\u2019s greatest strength was not his cultivation level or even his speed, but the extremely powerful condensation of spirit energy.One had to know that he had inherited the Blood Sword Emperor\u2019s cultivation technique. Although there was only a small trace of emperor energy in his spirit energy, it was not something that a fake Golden Core Realm cultivator like Bai Weiwei could withstand.When Di Si\u2019s Blood Sword slashed towards Bai Weiwei, everyone thought she\u2019d be cut in half.However, something unexpected happened.A trace of black spirit energy appeared on Bai Weiwei\u2019s spirit sword.And this spirit energy was as strong as, or even far stronger than Di Si\u2019s.It was astonishing.\u201cOh? Little wastrel, you actually blocked it, but that\u2019s all you can do!\u201d Di Si licked his dry lips and released even more spirit energy.Bai Weiwei was not afraid at all, and the more she fought, the braver she became.For a moment, sword energy and spirit energy energy surged around the place with blood-red and black colors interweaving chaotically.At the same time, a large number of spiderweb-like cracks appeared on the floor, and the Underground Palace began to shatter.This\u2026 Was this really the kind of damage that two Golden Core Realm cultivators could cause?Everyone present was stunned.They were not surprised at Di Si\u2019s power, but they were shocked that Bai Weiwei not only resisted Di Si, she also seemed to be gaining the upper hand.One had to know that Bai Weiwei was only at the fifth level of the Qi Condensation Realm at the Sword Worship Assembly. But now she was able to exchange blows with the most talented disciple of the sect. They just couldn\u2019t understand it.Everyone was dumbfounded wondering how a fake Golden Core Realm cultivator could be so powerful.Bai Weiwei being able to resist his attack made Di Si even more impatient.His spirit energy shook, and a blood sword appeared in his hand!This blood sword was four feet long and blood-red in color. It was the sword that the Blood Sword Emperor had once used when he was young. It contained a trace of the aura of an Emperor Realm powerhouse. Although it had only the strength of a supreme-grade spirit sword, it was very fierce!It was bound to break any ordinary sword in the world.\u201cYou should be proud of yourself to be defeated by my blood sword!\u201d Di Si shouted and his entire body emitted blood-red light.\u201cBlood Battle in the Wild!\u201dEndless blood-colored sword energy flew over.When Bai Weiwei saw this, she used her spirit sword to block it.A series of explosions and booming sounds rang out.Bai Weiwei\u2019s heart sank a bit because she discovered that her opponent\u2019s blood-colored sword energy could extinguish her spirit energy.If she didn\u2019t solve this problem, it wouldn\u2019t be long before her spirit sword lost all its spirit energy!\u201cHaha, when your spirit sword loses all its energy, you will lose!\u201d Di Si\u2019s eyes were blood-red, looking crazy.Bai Weiwei began to feel exhausted and she couldn\u2019t hold on for long.Right at this moment, with a crack, the spirit sword in her hand was broken by Di Si.This\u2026Alas, it turned out that Di Si was more powerful. No matter how powerful Elder Xuan was, he wasn\u2019t an Emperor Realm master, but Di Si had already got the inheritance from an Emperor Realm master.2This was what Qing Xuzi and the disciples present were thinking.They all thought that Bai Weiwei would lose.Seeing her spirit sword broken, Bai Weiwei was stunned.She looked at the spirit sword in her hand, feeling extremely sad.This sword was not only the first gift from her master, it also carried her indestructible Dao Heart!I\u2019m supposed to cut through thorns with this sword for my master. How can I fall here?!No!Since this sword is broken, I will become my master\u2019s sword!Her eyes became brighter as she held the broken sword in her hand tightly.At this moment, the sky darkened and dark clouds began to gather. If one looked carefully, it seemed that there was a black dragon hidden in the clouds.This\u2026 This is\u2026 ! It\u2019s Heaven and Earth Phenomenon of the Supreme Yin Heavenly Dragon!Qing Xuzi was so shocked as if a huge wave surged in his head!Those who could summon the Heaven and Earth Phenomenon were all extremely talented cultivators.According to records, the one who had caused such a phenomenon in the Profound Sword Sect was Li Wendao. But this time, it was Bai Weiwei. How could he not be shocked.It must be noted that the Heaven and Earth Phenomenon that appeared when Di Si accidentally acquired the inheritance of the Blood Sword Emperor was caused by the Blood Sword Emperor, not Di Si.No wonder Elder Xuan had chosen her as his disciple.Qing Xuzi began to recall the phenomenon that Xuan Yi had caused when he broke through. There did not seem to be anything special about it.Suddenly, his eyes widened as he remembered that there hadn\u2019t been any phenomenon at all! ! ! !At the last Sword Worship Assembly, when Xuan Yi appeared before the sect elders, he was only an outer sect disciple of the Qi Condensation Realm. He was about to be kicked out of the sect.But in the tests, Xuan Yi actually displayed the power of the Law Enforcement Realm!It happened without any warning!How could anyone enter the Law Enforcement Realm from the Qi Condensation Realm without causing the slightest fluctuation in the air?Only a master who had been above this realm could do that! And he was just taking back his own cultivation level.\u201cCould it be\u2026 that Elder Xuan is the reincarnation of some ancient sage?\u201d Qing xuzi guessed, thinking he was close to the truth!If that was the case, then Elder Xuan was an extraordinary existence!He swallowed with a bitter taste in his mouth, regretting that he had doubted Xuan Yi.Standing in the underground palace, Bai Weiwei didn\u2019t know about the Heaven and Earth Phenomenon she had caused. She didn\u2019t even know that she was in the middle of a breakthrough.However, she was circulating the Supreme Yin Scripture despite the great pressure she was underAt this moment, she was in an extremely wondrous moment.Many black characters appeared on the Supreme Yin Scripture in her body. Then, they leaped out and arranged themselves in the void.Bai Weiwei was actually about to break through to the Golden Core Realm while she was in a battle.Ho!\u201cCondense!\u201dAn ice-cold black golden core condensed in Bai Weiwei\u2019s body!Golden Core Realm!But Bai Weiwei did not stop at here. Her beautiful eyes turned sharp as she extended two fingers. All her spirit energy was compressed into these two fingers.She was going to use the imperial-level secret technique recorded in the Supreme Yin Scripture!1Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20Chapter 20: Imperial-level Divine Power, Star Picking TechniqueWith an afterimage, Bai Weiwei\u2019s resplendent sword aura instantly arrived in front of Di Si.The sword aura seemed to be able to slice open the sky!Di Si was alarmed.Under his incredulous gaze, his blood sword was annihilated the instant it touched that imperial-level secret technique.Following that, the sword aura shot out like a dragon, heavily injuring him!\u201cPhew!\u201d Di Si was sent flying and spat out a mouthful of blood. He looked at himself in disbelief.He\u2026 had lost?\u201cSince you are from the same sect as me, I won\u2019t kill you! If there is a next time\u2026 I can\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll live!\u201dBai Weiwei\u2019s white robes rustled as she stood in the middle the Underground Palace. Her voice was incomparably cold.However, her face was quite pale. After using the secret technique of the Supreme Yin Scripture with her full strength, she was fatigued.She was just barely standing, but her eyes were brighter than ever.And at this time, Xuan Yi, who was far away in the forbidden zone, heard a familiar voice in his mind.[ Ding Dong, congratulations to the host for having a Golden Core Realm disciple. The side mission is completed. You have obtained the divine power: Star Picking Technique ]\u2018Hmm?\u2019Xuan Yi smiled. It seemed that his disciple had brought him a rather good divine power.\u201cHer talent is not bad. She\u2019s only fifteen years old and has entered the Golden Core Realm! Given a few more years, she might reach my current realm.\u201dThe cultivation talent of the Supreme Yin Physique was indeed great This was a physique that Xuan Yi would never have.However, he did not need any such great physiques.After all, he didn\u2019t need a special physique to cultivate, right?Wasn\u2019t the system better than anything?Then Xuan Yi began to study the Star Picking Technique.The Star Picking Technique was ranked among the top divine powers.Star Emperor, the once No.1 cultivator in this continent, had created the embryonic form of this divine power at the Divine Power Realm. He continued to perfect this power which eventually became the Star Picking Technique famous throughout the continent.After one reached the peak level of the technique, one could even pluck stars from the sky and crush them into dust!\u201cNot bad\u2026\u201dXuan Yi took a quick look at the divine power and found he could learn it himself.\u201cDing Dong! Congratulations to the host for mastering the imperial-level divine power Star Picking Technique!\u201dWith the system around, he could master any skills in an instant.Apart from the fact that he could not cultivate himself and could only level up relying on his disciples, everything was perfect.Just as he was immersed in the power of the Star Picking Technique, another battle was about to begin in the Underground Palace.\u201cYou b*tch! You actually dared to injure Di Si. Don\u2019t you know that he is the direct disciple of the First Elder?!\u201d Murong Tian emphasized the two words \u201cFirst Elder\u201d as he spoke.\u201cIn the Underground Palace battles, anyone could be hurt\u2026\u201d Bai Weiwei was a little weak, but her voice was still loud and clear.Murong Tian was terrified.He could see that Bai Weiwei was exhausted, but he still did not dare to challenge her.His younger brother was crippled, and Di Si was seriously injured right in front of his eyes. And they were defeated because they had spoken disrespectfully about Xuan Yi.If he said a wrong word, she would definitely fight to the death with him.However, the hatred in his eyes did not diminish. As long as the test continued, he would definitely find an opportunity to slash her with a sword!Xia Hanning knew she had underestimated Bai Weiwei, but she still took the latter as an enemy because she was a proud genius. More importantly, she was the personal disciple of the Second Elder. Her master did not like Xuan Yi, so she disliked Bai Weiwei.However, Qing Xuzi appreciated Bai Weiwei\u2019s talent because the sect needed talented disciples. As for Di Si who was severely injured, Qing Xuzi would just give him some medicinal pills to heal his injuries. That was all.Even if the First Elder was unhappy, he could do nothing about it.After this matter was over, he would pour resources on her so she\u2019d grow stronger.With that thought in mind, Qing Xuzi said in a deep voice, \u201cBai Weiwei, you have already proven your talent by defeating Di Si, but now your spirit energy is exhausted. As long as you admit defeat, this matter will be dropped.\u201d He thought he had made a suggestion that would satisfy both sides.However, Bai Weiwei smiled faintly and said, \u201cAdmit defeat? That\u2019s impossible!\u201d\u201cWhy? Do you know that you\u2019ve just broken through and need time to stabilize your realm? If you continue to fight like this, you\u2019ll hurt yourself!\u201d Qing Xuzi\u2019s voice was very serious.\u201cI want to follow my master no matter if it\u2019s to the mystic realm or anywhere else!\u201d Bai Weiwei said resolutely.For this one goal, she was willing to give up everything!Qing Xuzi shook his head in disapproval.She was a rare genius, but she did not listen to him, the sect master. This depressed him very much.\u201cAlright, since you are so persistent, then I\u2019ll see how you will fight,\u201d Qing Xuzi said in a deep voice, but he had condensed a ball of green spirit energy in his hands. If Bai Weiwei was in danger, he would help her.Facing the powerful auras of the remaining eight cultivators, Bai Weiwei was also uncertain.At this moment, a gentle voice sounded in her mind, \u201cDisciple, if your fight right after the breakthrough, it will make your realm unstable. I\u2019ll give you anything that you might find in the mystic realm. There\u2019s no need to continue\u2026\u201d Xuan Yi tried to persuade her to give up the fight since he did not his highly talented disciple to have an unstable realm.Although he could find natural treasures to heal her, he hoped she would stop and not damage her foundation.\u201cNo, Master! Please let me continue! I want to go with you to the Sage Mystic Realm! I\u2019ll do anything! Don\u2019t leave me behind\u2026\u201d Bai Weiwei\u2019s tone was determined. This was the first time she disobeyed Xuan Yi\u2019s order.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Xuan Yi sighed. He didn\u2019t know what to say to her.This disciple had a strong will, which was both good and bad. She was just a bit too stubborn\u2026In the end, Xuan Yi didn\u2019t force her and said, \u201cAlright! After the assessment ends, come and see me. I\u2019ll help you stabilize your realm! In addition, I will teach you a divine power named the Star Picking Technique! Listen carefully!\u201dXuan Yi transmitted the imperial- level divine power to Bai Weiwei\u2019s mind.Since his disciple was so brave, as her master, he shouldn\u2019t be stingy, right?So he gave her the biggest reward at the moment.Hearing her master\u2019s words, Bai Weiwei was thrilled. She murmured to herself, \u201cDivine power? This is actually a divine power!\u201dHer excitement quickly turned into joy.\u201cIt turns out that my master has been watching over me, and he even taught me such a powerful divine power!\u201cI will not let him down!\u201dAfter obtaining this divine power, Bai Weiwei was stunned.It must be noted that one could only cultivate divine powers at the Divine Power Realm, which was right after her current realm. But she she found she could cultivate it at the Golden Core Realm. What a pleasant surprise!After mastering this imperial-level divine power, Bai Weiwei turned her head to look at the remaining eight people.She said calmly, \u201cAll of you come and fight me at the same time!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Chapter 21: Blinding My Eyes!Xia Hanning: ? ? ?Murong Tian: ? ? ?The disciples present: ? ? ?When Bai Weiwei said this, everyone was baffled, thinking that she didn\u2019t know what was good for her.One had to know that the strength of these eight geniuses were all greater than hers. Moreover, they all had the ability to fight enemies with higher levels than their own.Was she so arrogant that she really thought she was unrivalled in the Golden Core Realm?It was ridiculous that a cultivator who had just stepped into the Golden Core Realm thought she could fight eight sect geniuses of the Golden Core Realm.Qing Xuzi also felt that Bai Weiwei was overly confident, but there was some anticipation in his heart, wondering if she could create a miracle.This was absolutely impossible. Even though she was a genius disciple, it was impossible for her to challenge eight masters of the same level at the same time when she had just stepped into the Golden Core Realm.Only someone like Xuan Yi could be able to suppress several geniuses of the same level as his, right?The goal for sword cultivators was breaking ten thousand techniques with a single sword move. The most important things for them were sword techniques, spirit energy, and weapons.Bai Weiwei had just stepped into the Golden Core Realm, and her spirit energy was unstable, so the only thing she could rely on was sword techniques!Sword techniques were not something that could be cultivated in a few days. Among the eight disciples, the one with the best sword techniques was Xia Hanning. Even Murong Tian was more proficient with his Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique than Bai Weiwei was with her sword techniques.She had no chance of winning at all, unless she could cultivate the most orthodox sword technique of the Profound Sword Sect, but unfortunately, the current sect did not have it.Qing Xuzi sighed deeply.Sigh, if Bai Weiwei could cultivate Sage Li\u2019s sword techniques, then she might have a chance. Unfortunately, her master was not Saint Li.Bai Weiwei did not know what the sect master was thinking.She said confidently, \u201cCome on!\u201dXia Hanning and the others were stunned. Of course, they were not frightened by Bai Weiwei, but they suspected that they had heard it wrong.\u201cYou are so young, yet you speak such arrogant words. I\u2019ll show you that you\u2019re nothing before us!\u201d Murong Tian shouted.\u201cBai Weiwei, I admit that your sword move just now was very stunning, but in terms of exquisite swordsmanship, you are nothing compared with senior sister Xia,\u201d a second level of Golden Core Realm disciple said indifferently.Xia Hanning shook her head and said, \u201cHumph, you are truly ignorant and arrogant for someone who has just entered the Golden Core Realm. You\u2019re like a frog looking up from the depth of a well. I\u2019ll show you what a real genius looks like!\u201dWith a resolute expression, she charged toward Bai Weiwei with a series of afterimages, intending to knock her off the stage with one strike.At the same time, the remaining seven powerful Golden Core Realm disciples attacked Bai Weiwei from other directions, blocking her exits.However, Bai Weiwei was not afraid at all. Instead, she was even a little excited!With a cold light in her eyes, she emitted star lights which swirled around and engulfed her entire body.At this time, an indifferent voice came from the void, \u201cHold the sun and the moon in hand and pluck stars from the sky!\u201dHearing the majestic voice, Qing Xuzi was amazed, feeling the urge to kneel down and worship it.This\u2026 This was the pressure of an Emperor Realm master. Although there was only a trace of it, the suppression of the realm made him feel fear.Even the sect master felt a little pressured, let alone the disciples.In the air above the disciples, a hand as huge as an ocean appeared, radiant with shining star lights.As Qing Xuzi watched in shock, the huge hand smashed down onto the eight genius disciples as if they were flies.But this divine power required a large amount of spirit energy and Bai Weiwei was too tired to maintain the move for long.Furthermore, she didn\u2019t want to kill them. Otherwise, these disciples would have been seriously injured.At this moment, the eight geniuses were lying on the ground looking pale. They were so disheveled and scared that they no longer looked like proud geniuses.Qing Xuzi was shocked, but he was also pleasantly surprised.\u201cHahaha, Elder Xuan, you did a good job finding such a talented disciple for our sect. Well done!\u201dEveryone gasped in extreme astonishment.They had never thought that the seemingly fragile girl would have such a terrifying battle prowess.After beating up these disciples, Bai Weiwei\u2019s face did not show the slightest bit of surprise. She only wanted to return to her master.\u201cSect Master! Please keep your end of the bargain!\u201d Bai Weiwei cupped her hands and bowed to Sect Master Qing Xuzi respectfully.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Qing Xuzi was still thinking about the incomparably mysterious divine power. When he heard Bai Weiwei\u2019s words, he smiled awkwardly and said, \u201cOf course! After the Underground Palace Competition, Bai Weiwei has won a spot in the expedition team! The challenge for the remaining eight spots will continue!\u201dThe last sentence was directed to all the other disciples in the sect.Hearing his words, the nine disciples who had been selected to enter the Sage Mystic Realm were stunned.Bai Weiwei\u2019s attack just now had rendered them powerless.If someone came up to challenge them now, they\u2019d certainly lose, right?However, Bai Weiwei didn\u2019t care about their fates. She wanted to see Xuan Yi as soon as possible. So she smiled and thanked the sect master Qing Xuzi, \u201cThank you, Sect Master!\u201dWith that, she left the Underground Palace, leaving the terrified disciples behind.This Bai Weiwei\u2026 was so strong!\u2026In the back mountain of the Profound Sword Sect, the place where Xuan Yi cultivated.Xuan Yi had already returned to his residence from the sect\u2019s forbidden zone.There was another woman in this room and she was Xuan Yi\u2019s eldest disciple, Lin Yingxue.She was currently naked soaking in water in a huge wooden bucket with only her small head above the water.Her eyes were watery as she looked at the man in front of her.This was the seventh time. She was happy that she could be with her master every time she took a medicinal bath.Mm, my master is so handsome.Just now, my master touched my head again. His palm is so warm.Xuan Yi did not know what his eldest disciple was thinking.He was filled with puzzlement: This is strange. It has been a long time but Lin Yingxue still can\u2019t activate her Ice Physique. Why is that?It seemed that the Ice Spirit Flower was her only cure. This spirit herb was extremely rare and he hoped that he could find it in the mystic realm.Thinking of this, he patted Lin Yingxue\u2019s head and said gently, \u201cYingxue, I won\u2019t take you to the mystic realm this time. Your Ice Physique hasn\u2019t been activated yet, and you haven\u2019t cultivated the Nine Frost Sutra, so the trip is too dangerous for you. Besides, Wang Hu\u2019s Tiger Demon Physique hasn\u2019t reached the late stage yet. You must supervise his cultivation.\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201d Lin Yingxue obediently replied, but she felt a little disappointed. The cultivation technique her master gave her was excellent, but it was a pity that she couldn\u2019t cultivate it. As the eldest disciple, she was still at the seventh level of the Foundation Establishment Realm and she felt a little ashamed. One had to know that Wang Hu had reached the first level of the Tiger Demon Body Refining Technique.And at this moment, a white-robed girl barged in.She was Bai Weiwei. With joy on her face, she walked in to see her master, but to her surprise, she saw such a scene.Oh My God, it was senior sister Lin Yingxue! ! !This\u2026 This was so embarrassing.So the master liked this type of girls?Bai Weiwei\u2019s face was pink as she touched her own high chest. The first thought she had was running out of the room.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Chapter 22: Let\u2019s GoXuan Yi saw the girl in white at the door and said slowly, \u201cWeiwei, you\u2019re here. Come, let me take a good look of you.\u201dBai Weiwei was stunned for a moment, then her face flushed red. She lowered her head and walked into Xuan Yi\u2019s room.Her eyes were tightly shut, and her face looked like it was on fire. However, a hint of shy smile appeared on her lips.The master\u2019s words\u2026 Well\u2026she could do it.She began to disrobe and her white robe floated to the floor like a butterfly. She took off her clothes, revealing her exquisite collarbone and swan-like neck, until she was clad only in the undergarment covering her breasts and belly.Wait, what is this girl doing?Xuan Yi was astonished.Maybe she thought that I wanted to examine her body.Xuan Yi swallowed. He had been dry-mouthed with Lin Yingxue naked in the room. Now, another girl came in and disrobed herself\u2026Do they think I\u2019m a\u2026\u201cAhem,\u201d Xuan Yi coughed dryly and said faintly, \u201cWeiwei, you don\u2019t need to take off your clothes to stabilize your realm.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d Bai Weiwei cried out in surprise.Her cheeks seemed to have been smeared with a layer of rouge. Her beautiful eyes were filled with panic, looking extremely bright and charming.\u2018Oh, my master must think I\u2019m slutty, this\u2026\u2019.It was no wonder that Bai Weiwei had misunderstood. After all, she had seen a beautiful naked woman in her master\u2019s room.On the other hand, Bai Weiwei was a competitive girl and wanted to show her master that her figure was no less beautiful than Lin Yingxue\u2019s.In the end, she misunderstood him and embarrassed herself.\u201cMaster, I\u2026\u201dBai Weiwei looked down, and her face was burning.However, very soon, she felt a familiar spirit energy was injected into her body and circulated all over her meridians.\u201cWell, fortunately, your physique isn\u2019t damaged. In the next few days, you must circulate your spirit energy as I showed you and your Gold Core Realm will be stable,\u201d Xuan Yi said coolly.\u201cOkay. Thank you, Master.\u201dHearing Xuan Yi\u2019s words, Lin Yingxue, who was in the medicinal bath, was astonished.Golden Core Realm!As Xuan Yi\u2019s eldest disciple, she was only at the seventh level of the Foundation Establishment Realm, far inferior to his third disciple. She was upset with herself.The disciples that her master took in were all talented.Although Wang Hu didn\u2019t walk the path of Dao, he was a genius in body refining. His true combat strength wasn\u2019t inferior to that of his senior sister.Bai Weiwei had entered the sect later than her, but her cultivation was much higher than hers.How could this not shock her.But very quickly, Lin Yingxue made a decision.Her master\u2019s going to the mystic realm was an opportunity for her, because she felt restless whenever she saw her master and couldn\u2019t calm down to cultivate.However, the Nine Frost Sutra that she cultivated required she to keep a clear and calm head.Up until now, she couldn\u2019t enter the first level of the sutra yet.If she could enter the first level, she was confidence that she could catch up with Bai Weiwei.After my master leaves, I will focus on the cultivation, and my master will see me in a new light.\u201cAhem\u2026 I have to return to the forbidden zone. I\u2019m going now\u2026\u201d Xuan Yi looked at the alluring girls in the room and tried hard to suppress his arousal.When he left, he reminded himself that they were his disciples\u2026his disciples\u2026\u2026A few days later, the ringing sounds of the Heavenly Dao Bell reverberated in the entire Profound Sword Sect.Every time the Heavenly Dao Bell rang, it meant that the sect had an important matter to attend to.Today the Sage Mystic Realm would open.Qing Xuzi stood in the center of the training hall with ten people standing on his right, including Xuan Yi, Bai Weiwei, and the others.On his left were the elders of the sect.Before them were the disciples of the entire sect. They stood in a big crowd.Their expressions were solemn, and their eyes were resolute.Qing Suzi said slowly, \u201cToday is the opening day of the Sage Mystic Realm. This matter concerns the entire southern domain.\u201cThis time, I will personally send Elder Xuan and his team into the mystic realm.\u201cSo I leave the sect matters to the First Elder.\u201d\u201cYes, Sect Master,\u201d the First Elder said in a deep voice.Qing Xuzi was expressionless and no one knew what he was thinking.He waved his hand and a ball of green spirit energy engulfed Xuan Yi and the others.The spirit light swirled around them and instantly, they turned into a ray of light and shot into the sky.\u2026The Sage Mystic Realm was located in the Great Abyss forbidden zone in the south domain.The Great Abyss was full of broken rules and Dao laws. Even those in the Law Enforcement Realm found it difficult to set foot in this place.Swoosh!More than ten rays of light streaked across the sky outside the Sage Mystic Realm\u2026Xuan Yi and the others arrived at the the Saint Pagoda, which was the barrier of the Saint Secret Realm!This Saint Pagoda was a barrier set up by the top 100 sects of the south domain. It was a forbidden entrance protected by arrays left behind by Sage Li.Now, a large group of people had gathered at the Saint Pagoda. They were from the top 100 sects of the south domain.\u201cYou\u2019re finally here. I thought the Profound Sword Sect was going to withdraw at the last minute,\u201d Wang Ye, the sect master of the Myriad Beasts Sect, said sinisterly.There were more than a dozen disciples behind him, and Wang Xuan, who had accompanied him to the Sword Worship Assembly, was among them.\u201cHehe, fellow Daoist Qing Xuzi is not some sneaky person. After all, he\u2019s the master of one of our top 100 sects in the south domain,\u201d Li Changqing said coolly. There were more than a dozen disciples behind him; in the center of the group was a girl.She was Li Xinyan, who had gone to the Sword Worship Assembly with Li Changqing. She had recently broken through to the Divine Power Realm with the aid of the arrays set up by the sect master. A 20-year-old Divine Power Realm cultivator was considered a genius among geniuses in the entire south domain.She said disdainfully, \u201cWell, we\u2019ve seen how weak the Profound Sword Sect is during the last Sword Worship Assembly. This time, it is a suicidal move for them to come to the Sage Mystic Realm.\u201d\u201cXinyan, that\u2019s not right. The Sage Mystic Realm is their treasure and it\u2019s generous of them to share it with us. They are not suicidal but magnanimous,\u201d an old woman said lightly.She had different flowers tattooed on her body. As the sect master of the White Flower Sect, she had always appeared mild, but in this mystic realm expedition, her ambition was revealed.\u201cHehe, Woman Kong, why are you here in the Sage Mystic Realm instead of staying in the White Flower Valley?\u201d A white-haired man shouted loudly.\u201cOld Ghost He, people from your Medicine God Valley are supposed to be refining pills. You said you\u2019d always be neutral in the southern domain, but now you\u2019re here, too. Does it mean that you lied?\u201d Kong Yue retorted mercilessly.\u201cHahaha, that\u2019s because our Medicine God Valley didn\u2019t intend to contend for hegemony in the southern domain. But now we have a genius disciple, so we decided to give it a try.\u201dAt this moment, people noticed the young girl standing behind He Baicao.Unlike the dull disciples of the Medicine God Valley, she had long red hair, a quiet gaze, and faint dimples on her cheeks. Obviously, she was a cute and smart girl.But the odd thing was that she carried a huge sword on her back!Xuan Yi was surprised by the pure fire spirit energy emitting from her body.This\u2026 was actually the Heavenly Flame Sword Physique!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23Chapter 23: New Mission\u201cFellow Daoist Qing Xuzi, I\u2019m surprised that both you and your genius Elder Xuan have personally brought your disciples here.\u201dLi Changqing laughed lightly and felt contempt for Qing Xuzi, thinking that no matter how many people Qing Xuzi brought here, it couldn\u2019t conceal the decline of their sect.Qing xuzi said indifferently, \u201cFellow Daoist Li, you\u2019re wrong. Unlike me, Elder Xuan will also enter the mystic realm this time.\u201dHearing his words, everyone\u2019s eyes were filled with astonishment.There was actually an elder who could enter the Sage Mystic Realm?Did the Profound Sword Sect had some secret technique that could allow an elder to enter the Sage Mystic Realm?One had to know that the elders of the big sects were all quite old in age.This was because they had higher realm than others and few people could challenge their authority.For some reason, the cultivators present felt a bit worried.However, they soon remembered that no matter what method they used, it could not change the fact that cultivators over the age of thirty would die if they tried to enter the mystic realm.They calmed down a little.Humph! This old man was very evil. His people would all die after entering the mystic realm, but he was trying to unsettle them with such a trick.Sect Master Kong of the Hundred Flowers Sect said coolly, \u201cFellow Daoist Qing Xuzi, perhaps you\u2019ve been too busy recently. Don\u2019t you know that elders can\u2019t enter the mystic realm? Don\u2019t you know that your elder will be immediately annihilated by the pressure in the realm?\u201cAlso, that Elder Xuan you spoke of is even more daring. It seems that he hasn\u2019t even done the most basic research about the mystic realm.\u201cAlas, the Profound Sword Sect was once so powerful, but now you guys are acting so outrageously.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Xuan Yi. Sect Master Kong, what do you mean by this?\u201d Xuan Yi said indifferently.Following that, a faint spirit energy fluctuation appeared, shocking everyone present.\u201cThis\u2026 This is actually the fifth level of the Law Enforcement Realm!\u201dThe sect masters felt stifled, especially Kong Yue, who was directly facing Xuan Yi.She found it difficult to breath. As the master of the Hundred Flower Sect which was one of the top 100 great sects, she was half a step into the Sect Master Realm.During the last Sword Worship Assembly, Xuan Yi did not show his strong strength when he faced Ma Wuliang, so she did not pay much attention to him. In addition, her strength was stronger than Ma Wuliang\u2019s, so she was not impressed by that confrontation. However, now that she was facing Xuan Yi who had broken through to a higher level, she was stunned.How could a cultivator at the fifth level of the Law Enforcement Realm release such a great pressure?This person was very powerful!\u201cUh\u2026 I just wanted to tell Elder Xuan that this mystic realm has an extremely strong restriction. Any cultivator over the age of 30 will die after entering the mystic realm.\u201dNoticing Xuan Yi\u2019s extraordinary strength, He Baicao injected a used a Dao technique into his eyes.This secret technique was the Medicine God Valley\u2019s special way to observe people.He was shocked when he saw the result.\u201cThis\u2026 Elder Xuan\u2019s bone age is actually only 22 years old\u2026\u201dHiss!Everyone present gaspedThey were astonished by Xuan Yi\u2019s talent.However, this mystic realm had another feature. The higher the realm one had, the greater the suppression one would feel. So they valued actual combat ability more than cultivation strength.Thinking of this, they felt a little better as they remembered that their disciples were geniuses with more years spent in real combats than Xuan Yi. Besides, they carried the sects\u2019 trump cards.However, He Baicao was not so confident about this trip to the mystic realm. He turned to the red-haired girl beside him and instructed her,\u201cMy good disciple, listen up. After entering, don\u2019t fight with people and don\u2019t cause trouble. You\u2019re my only precious disciple.\u201d\u201cTsk, old man, I haven\u2019t agreed to be your disciple yet.\u201d Song Qingxin\u2019s pretty face turned away with disdain.\u201cDidn\u2019t you\u2026 didn\u2019t you say that you would become a disciple of the Medicine God Valley?\u201d He Baicao hurriedly said.\u201cWho said that? I went to the Medicine God Valley because I agreed to help you add some spirit essence when you were refining pills and you\u2019d give me some pills as a payment. I\u2019m your partner, not your disciple,\u201d Song Qingxin said indifferently.Hearing her words, He Baicao got anxious.This young girl\u2019s spirit energy contained pure fire essence. Refining pills with this kind of spirit energy not only increased the success rate but also the the quality of the pillsTo the Medicine God Valley, this young girl was a great treasure.\u201cThen, how can I make you join the Medicine God Valley?\u201d He Baicao spread out his hands.Song Qingxin clenched her small fists and said excitedly, \u201cHehe, it\u2019s very easy. If you can defeat me, I\u2019ll be your disciple. Your cultivation level is so high, yet you can\u2019t defeat me. How embarrassing. If you had Elder Xuan\u2019s talent and strength, or if you were thirty percent as handsome as he is, I\u2019ll consider to be your disciple.\u201dA sly look appeared in her eyes.Being dressed down by a young girl in front of so many people, He Baicao\u2019s face turned red.He quickly said, \u201cAhem, guys, time is almost up. Let\u2019s open the mystic realm.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s time to open the mystic realm,\u201d the others agreed in unison.Under the combined efforts of the sect masters of the Myriad Beasts Sect, the Heavenly Array Sect, and the Profound Sword Sect, a purple light appeared in the Saint Pagoda.Then, a huge door appeared out of thin air within the purple light.It was pitch-black inside, and no one could see what was going on inside the door.After that, disciples from different sects entered the huge door and disappeared behind it.Looking at the mysterious door, Xuan Yi had a bad premonition.It seemed that this trip to the mystic realm was a little dangerous.His heart sank a bit and he said to the disciples beside him, \u201cAfter entering the mystic realm, you must follow me closely. Don\u2019t wander around.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Bai Weiwei and the others hurriedly replied.At this time, the familiar system voice sounded in Xuan Yi\u2019s mind.[ Ding Dong, a new mission has been triggered!

    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Chapter 24: Yin Corpse SectAfter the world stopped swirling around them, Xuan Yi and the others came into the Sage Mystic Realm.He looked around and was a bit surprised when he saw that it looked different from the descriptions in the scrolls left behind by Li Wendao in the sect\u2019s forbidden zone.It was recorded that there was a powerful cultivation suppression in the mystic realm. This suppression was more obvious to the cultivators with higher cultivation. However, he found that there was no such restriction in here.He didn\u2019t think that there would be any mistakes in the mystic realm that Li Wendao had set up before his death. After all, it was the handiwork of a sage.Moreover, it was recorded in the forbidden zone that the mystic realm was brimming with spirit energy and natural treasures. However, right now, he felt an extremely strong aura of death in the thick fog around him!Most importantly, this strong aura of death actually made him feel a bit of fear.The visibility of the surroundings was not very high, and they could only see things within fifty meters.Engulfed in this dense fog, they couldn\u2019t feel things with their awareness and couldn\u2019t only observe the surroundings with their eyes.Xuan Yi whispered to the disciples beside him, \u201cWe are separated from the other sects. Don\u2019t wander around. Be careful of the situation around you.\u201d\u201cYes, Master,\u201d Bai Weiwei quickly replied.Xia Hanning and the others, on the other hand, looked exhausted and dragged their feet as they walked.\u201cEh? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Xuan Yi asked them.\u201cElder Xuan\u2026 Elder Xuan, this damn place is so\u2026weird.\u201d Murong Tian\u2019s face was pale and he looked weak and dispirited.\u201cYes, after taking a few steps, I found that my spirit energy is dissipating bit by bit. Moreover, I feel weaker with every step I take\u2026\u201d Xia Hanning and the others said with a trembling voice.This was odd.Xuan Yi glanced at Bai Weiwei. Seeing her lively and vigorous steps, he was puzzled.\u201cWeiwei, how do you feel?\u201d Xuan Yi asked.\u201cI felt a little uncomfortable, but I\u2019m better after circulating the cultivation technique once,\u201d Bai Weiwei said lightly.\u201cI see.\u201d Xuan Yi thought for a moment, and then nodded in understanding.Bai Weiwei was the youngest of the nine people and had outstanding talent and powerful cultivation technique, so this restriction could not suppress her.His bone age was only twenty-two, but his strength had already reached the Law Enforcement Realm and he could mater any technique with the help of the system. This kind of talent was unprecedented.So he felt nothing of the restriction.What puzzled Xuan Yi was that lots of the things in the place were not as recorded in the scrolls in the sect.One had to know that Li Wendao had created the mystic realm according to the plan stored in the sect. From what he had seen in the mystic realm, many places were the same as the records in the sect described.Then why did he make these changes during the process?Xuan Yi was puzzled.Could it be that Li Wendao was looking for something at that time?Boom!A series of rumbling sounds came from ahead, interrupting Xuan Yi\u2019s thoughts.\u201cBai Weiwei, stay here and look after the others. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dXuan Yi left a spirit energy mark in her body, so he\u2019d know it if she was in danger.Before Bai Weiwei could respond, he turned into a stream of light and flew forward.He arrived at the place where the big commotion was\u2026Xuan Yi recognized the group of people.Eh? The red-haired girl was among them.This girl\u2019s talent was no less than Bai Weiwei\u2019s, but he did not know what kind of person she was.Xuan Yi concealed himself in a large tree and began to observe.\u201cI\u2019ve already told you not to listen to your master. You guys did nothing but make pills in the sect and didn\u2019t do any exercises. You\u2019ve only run a few steps now, and you\u2019re already so tired that you can\u2019t even walk?\u201d The red-haired girl with the large sword was lecturing the green-robed disciples.These disciples had the word \u201cMedicine\u201d embroidered on the chests of their green robes. They were from the Medicine God Valley.\u201cJunior sister Song, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to walk. It\u2019s just we feel extremely uncomfortable in this place. My\u2026 my legs are as soft as jelly. I just have no strength to walk,\u201d He Song said.\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. You just need some exercises. I can cure your soft legs with a few more beams of sword energy. What happened just now proved that I\u2019m right. You did run faster. Now let me help you.\u201d With that said, Song Qingxin raised her great sword and smashed it at the others.He Song and the others were terrified.Good heavens, they had just entered the mystic realm, and they did not even find a single medicinal herb yet. Were they going to die just like this?Moreover, they would die at the hands of their own bodyguard instead of an enemy. What was going on?However, the scorching sword energy did not come.When the scarlet great sword was close to their heads, Song Qingxin slightly adjusted the direction of the sword and cut off a large pine tree beside her.\u201cSince you\u2019ve already arrived, why don\u2019t show yourself?\u201d Song Qingxin asked in a grave voice.HMM?Xuan Yi touched his nose in puzzlement. He was surprised that this red-haired girl could see him.Then, he thought of something and looked at the destroyed pine tree.The remnant flames on it were burning the life of this pine tree.However, the moment the pine tree was destroyed, he had sensed the aura of a rotting corpse.\u201cI underestimated you guys from the Medicine God Valley. I didn\u2019t expect to be discovered by a girl. You are still wet behind the ears. If you know what\u2019s good for you, scram. Otherwise, I will refine you into a Yin corpse as well.\u201dA gloomy-looking man flew out from the shade of the trees. There were seven rotten corpses standing beside him, emitting a dark aura.Xuan Yi was slightly stunned when he saw the word \u2018Yin\u2019 on the man\u2019s robe.People from the Yin Corpse Sect?He was surprised to see cultivators from the west domain in the Sage Mystic Realm. Furthermore, they were people of the Yin Corpse Sect.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Chapter 25: The Girl Who Tell into the TrapThe Yin Corpse Sect!This sect was extremely secretive. The way they cultivated were different from other cultivators. They dug graves and refined corpses but usually didn\u2019t appear in the public.However, if they appeared in the public, it meant they were looking for some special treasure or digging the graves of other people\u2019s ancestors.Cultivators from this demonic sect were despised everywhere.This demonic sect cultivator was at the second level of the Golden Core Realm, but one of the rotten corpses beside him was at the second level of the Golden Core Realm. The other six Yin corpses were at the first level of the Golden Core Realm.Although the Yin corpses could only release 50% of their strengths they had before death, the Yin Corpse Sect cultivators could fight against people of a higher level with their Yin corpses.Xuan Yi wondered if they were drawn here by something.Also, how did they enter?Xuan Yi frowned slightly, but he did not show himself.\u201cRefine into a Yin corpse? Junior sister Song, you must protect me well. I\u2026I don\u2019t want to be refined into a rotten corpse.\u201d He Song trembled as he crawled towards Song Qingxin.Song Qingxin shook her head and rolled her eyes at him in contempt.You\u2019re just a medicine maker. When faced with a life and death crisis, all you think is hiding.After the initial shock, she quickly calmed down and began to analyze the situation.The demonic cultivator was obviously at the same cultivation level as hers. They were both at the second level of the Golden Core Realm, but his opponent looked like a fish in water in this place while she needed to take these Medicine God Valley disciples with her.The situation was not good to her. If she wanted to successfully retreat, she must end the battle as soon as possible!Moreover, she must kill the leader first, which was the key to solve the crisis.After making the battle strategy, she immediately took action.Without a word, she flew up with the big sword in her hand.\u201cHumph! You\u2019re courting death!\u201d The gloomy-looking man shouted in a deep voice.All the Yin corpses beside him flew up and pounced on Song Qingxin.\u201cVery good.\u201d Song Qingxin was not afraid. Instead, she was happy and went up to meet them with a ball of fire bursting out from the big sword.Hiss!Boom!The fire burned the corpse aura, and the sounds of spirit auras colliding with each and explosions could be heard continuously.\u201cHahaha, it\u2019s useless. With your strength, you will become food for my Yin corpses!\u201d The shady man laughed as he directed the Yin corpses to attack her.Surrounded by them, Song Qingxin, looked to be overwhelmed.\u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s over. Junior sister Song is going to be eaten by them.\u201d\u201cSigh, we\u2019re really going to be refined into Yin corpses. What should we do?\u201d\u2026He Song and the others were panicked when they saw that Song Qingxin was in the disadvantage.Just as the Yin corpses all went up from behind the gloomy-looking man, a huge red sword flew out from the burning pine tree behind him.This huge sword stabbed straight into the man.He looked incredulous because he didn\u2019t know how the sword came close to him.Song Qingxin smiled slightly. \u201cWell, you\u2019re too careless. This Scarlet Flame Sword can pass through flames. Don\u2019t take the flames behind you lightly.\u201d\u201cCough cough, so that\u2019s how it is. Scarlet Flame Sword. Are you\u2026 from the Middle Land\u2019s Black Fire Pavilion\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh? You are quite perceptive\u2026 much better than those from the Medicine God Valley. However, you still can\u2019t live!\u201d Song Qingxin chuckled.\u201cHumph! Do you think you are the winner? Funny, just now when you swung your big sword, you were hit by my Yin corpse. You have been poisoned by the corpse spot poison. In a few days, you will come down to accompany me. Haha\u2026\u201dSpitting out a few large mouthfuls of blood, the Yin Corpse Sect cultivator fell to the ground.Hearing his words, Song Qingxin\u2019s heart sank, and she immediately looked at her arm.Sure enough, there was a black injury on her white and tender wrist, and black gas rose from the wound which was gradually spreading upwards.This\u2026 This was corpse poison!Song Qingxin panicked but it was too late to cut off the wrist. With the circulation of spirit energy, the poison had already entered her body. Now she could do nothing but wait for the poison to take effect and die.Xuan Yi took a look at her wound. One Life Creating Pill could detoxify the poison.This girl had outstanding talent. Unfortunately, she did not have a deep understanding of the world and was a bit impulsive even though she was wary of others.However, in the face of a strong enemy, she was very brave. Instead of abandoning her companions, she fought fearlessly and killed her enemy.She had good talent, but her character needed some polish\u2026\u201cShe is only sixteen years old, but her cultivation strength has reached the second level of the Golden Core Realm, slightly higher even than Weiwei,\u201d Xuan Yi thought.He was considering taking her in as his disciple.However, before Xuan Yi could move, the situation had changed again.\u201cHahaha, that Yin Corpse Sect cultivator is dead. Junior Sister Song is amazing!\u201d The Medicine God Valley cultivators shouted cheerfully.Hearing the shout of his fellow cultivators, He Song, who had been hiding in a tree hole, immediately came out.He sneakily glanced at the gloomy-looking cultivator\u2019s body and hurriedly moved away.\u201cHe\u2026 is dead. Junior sister Song, don\u2019t worry.\u201d He Song forced himself to calm down.\u201cI know. You are the son of Sect Master He of the Medicine God Valley. You should have an antidote pill on you\u2026\u201d Song Qingxin\u2019s mind was in chaos, and a trace of confusion appeared in her eyes.He Song smiled calmly, and a trace of perversity flashed in his eyes.\u201cOf course. Come on, eat it. It can detoxify any poison.\u201d He Song took out a pink pill from his storage ring.He looked at the pill, and his body trembled a little, but he quickly steadied his voice.\u201cA pill that can detoxify any poison? If your Medicine God Valley had this ability, you wouldn\u2019t have asked me help you guys make pills, right?\u201d Song Qingxin held her head and said in puzzlement.\u201cAi, junior sister Song, this kind of pill is incomparably precious. It was passed down from our ancestors.\u201d He Song hurriedly placed the pill in front of her eyes and said, \u201cWe are in the mystic realm and it\u2019s very dangerous here. We should work together to overcome the difficulties. I\u2019m not lying to you. Now eat it.\u201dSong Qingxin hesitated for a moment, but she thought that in a place like this, the people from the Medicine God Valley couldn\u2019t live without her, so they wouldn\u2019t dare to give her poison.Thinking of this, she swallowed the pill.However, very soon, her face turned so hot that she felt her ears were burning.

    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Chapter 26: The Medicine God Valley\u2019s Evil Side\u201cUH\u2026 I. . . I. . . Why do I feel so hot?\u201d Song Qingxin\u2019s face was flushed as she panted out the words.\u201cHahaha, the heat means that the medicinal is taking effect. Junior sister, your spirit energy is also recovering.\u201d He Song did not hold back and revealed his lusty nature.The other disciples were shocked.Having refined many medicines, they knew the grade of a medicinal pill.The medicinal pill in his hand was extraordinary. Although they did not know the exact grade, they were certain that this medicinal pill was an aphrodisiac pill.A senior disciple recognized it and blurted out, \u201cThis medicinal pill is a dual cultivation treasure pill, the Beautiful Woman Evil Yin Pill.\u201d\u201cWhat? Isn\u2019t the Beautiful Woman Evil Yin Pill a medicinal pill of the Joyous Union Sect? How can our Medicine God Valley have it?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re new, right? Our Medicine God Valley was founded by an alchemist from the ancient Joyous Union Sect, which is why we have this pill. However, our Medicine God Valley intends to surpass the Joyous Union Sect and we have always disdained the pills and cultivation techniques of the Joyous Union Sect. We even regard this kind of evil pill as a forbidden pill. Why is this pill out here?\u201d\u2026After hearing their conversation, Song Qingxin understood everything despite her befuddled mind.What did this bastard feed her?!\u201cYou! Without me, you won\u2019t be able to walk out of this mystic realm!\u201d Song Qingxin\u2019s eyes were spitting fire. She wished that she could kill him. However, she didn\u2019t have any strength let in her, let alone spirit energy.He Song didn\u2019t look worried. He smiled lewdly at her but didn\u2019t reply.Song Qingxin slowly moved away from him. A trace of panic appeared in her eyes as she shouted angrily, \u201cHe Song, I saved your life just now. You\u2026 didn\u2019t your Medicine God Valley say that saving someone\u2019s life is better than building a seven-storied pagoda? Is this how you repay me?!\u201dHe Song only laughed.\u201cOf course I will repay you. To eliminate the effects of this pill, you must have dual cultivation with me. Don\u2019t worry, I will make you happy\u2026\u201dSong Qingxin took out a jade pendant and said in a panic, \u201cI can communicate with your father with this jade pendant. Aren\u2019t you afraid that your father will punish you?\u201dShe held onto the jade pendant tightly. This voice transmission jade pendant seemed to be her last straw of hope.Seeing Song Qingxin turn from an arrogant woman into the current cute girl, He Song had a perverted sense of pleasure.\u201cHahaha, Song Qingxin, shall I tell you the truth? Do you think my father would have given me this forbidden pill if he didn\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do? After we have dual cultivation, all of your fire element cultivation strength will belong to me. My father will be happy and might even reward me.\u201dHe Song\u2019s face was full of lust since he had coveted not only her talent but her gorgeous body as well. But the pill needed some time to take effect, so he had to wait a little more.When Song Qingxin heard his words, her heart sank to the bottom of her stomach.However, she looked calm and said said, \u201cHe Song, there\u2019s a flaw in your plan. The Joyous Union Sect is a Mid Land sect, and I am from the Mid Land, so I know about their dual cultivation method. As far as I know, if the man is weaker than the woman in cultivation strength, his body will explode during the dual cultivation!\u201dSong Qingxin tried to calm down. This was the only way she could think of to scare away the man.Hearing her words, He Song paused since he had thought of this possibility.Song Qingxin\u2019s strength was at the second level of the Golden Core Realm, while his strength was only at the third level of the Foundation Establishment Realm. The gap is very big. He had studied the dual cultivation forbidden book for a while. Considering that Song Qingxin had taken many medicinal pills from the Medicine God Valley and thus her body had already developed a trace of resistance, he had used the ancestral forbidden pill on her to overcome this gap. However, no one knew exactly how effective this pill was.At this moment, a disciple beside He Song jumped out.This person was Wang Er, the gatekeeper of the Medicine God Valley\u2019s Treasure Pavilion and He Song\u2019s minion. He had stolen these forbidden pills and dual cultivation forbidden book for He Song.Wang Er chuckled. \u201cYoung master He, don\u2019t worry. I once read a secret scroll on dual cultivation techniques in the Treasure Pavilion. The solution to this situation is to let multiple men to cultivate with the woman, so there will be more vessels to absorb her cultivation strength. Young master, you see, the eight of us are all at the Foundation Establishment Realm, while junior sister Song is at the second level of the Golden Core Realm. If we do it together, then not only would we be safe, but our sect would have a few more genius cultivators. Wouldn\u2019t that be great?\u201dHearing this, He Song\u2019s eyes lit up, and he revealed a smile that any man could understand as he said, \u201cWonderful.\u201dThe other disciples of the Medicine God Valley had felt frightened when they heard He Song\u2019s plan, thinking they\u2019d die after seeing this scandal.But if they became participants, they would not only live but have a bright future as well. How could they refuse?They immediately knelt down. \u201cWe swear to die for the Young Master!\u201d\u201cHahaha, wonderful! Since that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s have a good time together!\u201d\u201cYoung master is awesome,\u201d the seven cultivators shouted.Under the greedy and lustful gazes of the eight people, Song Qingxin looked like a frightened kitten.She felt dead inside after her final resistance got her even worse humiliation.She felt extremely bitter in her heart.If she were still in the Mystic Fire Pavilion, she would have taken over her father\u2019s position and become the Young Pavilion Master.If she had not heard the prophecy of the Oracle Granny from the Tianshu Courtyard, she would not have secretly come to the south domain.According to the prophecy, if she came to the south domain, she would meet a sword Dao master.How could she ignore this prophecy?Her plan was very simple. Since she did not know who the sword Dao master was, she went to a well-connected sect\u2013the Medicine God Valley to find information about the famous sword Dao geniuses in the south domain.However, she had never imagined the Medicine God Valley would repay her in this way for what she had done for it!The father and son were so greedy. One coveted her talent, while the other lusted after her body.Her body became hotter and hotter, and her mind gradually lost its clarity.In the end, tears gushed out of her eyes.Oracle Granny, your prophecies are always accurate. Before I die of humiliation, please let me see that peerless genius. One glance is enough for me.She was about to close her eyes when an extremely resplendent sword light slashed through the air.This astonishing sword energy seemed to be able to tear open the sky! !Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Chapter 27: Gentlemanly DemeanorThis exquisite sword light carried a monstrous sword intent as it slashed across the space.The powerful sword intent caused ripples to appear in the void.It even shattered the void and shook the earth!The sword energy had the power to annihilate all living things in this place!\u201cWho dares to\u2026\u201dBefore He Song could finish his words, the vast sword intent engulfed him.Then, before the terrified eyes of the other disciples of the Medicine God Valley, a bloody slash appeared on his neck.With a grunt, He Song\u2019s head was separated from his body. His eyes were filled with disbelief and bewilderment.He didn\u2019t know who killed him and couldn\u2019t figure out who\u2019d mess with the Medicine God Valley.\u201cAhhhh, there\u2019s a ghost\u2026\u201d Wang Er\u2019s voice trembled. His legs shook so hard that he couldn\u2019t move.\u201cThis mystic realm is weird! There must be some powerful demonic beast guarding the mystic realm! Otherwise, who could kill the senior brother with one slash?\u201dThe other Medicine God Valley disciples felt the same.Scared and nervous, they looked around but couldn\u2019t see where their enemy. They were terrified.However, Xuan Yi didn\u2019t give them time to panic.He never showed mercy to the kind of people who pretended to be kind but in reality heartless.Powerful sword intent continued to spread and engulfed the other Medicine God Valley disciples.They watched in terror as their bodies were slashed into pieces and turned into puddles of blood and flesh.They died in a flash!Song Qingxin was in a sate of hallucination and her entire body was burning, but she still maintained her vigilance towards her surroundings.She was astonished by the mysterious deaths of the Medicine God Valley cultivators.Then her dazed eyes saw a white-robed man with an otherworldly aura. This person was Xuan Yi.\u201cOh no, the medicine is about to\u2026 it\u2019s about to take effect\u2026\u201dSong Qingxin had a bad feeling in her heart.She said in a low voice, \u201cYou\u2026 Don\u2019t come over, I\u2026 I\u2026\u201dSong Qingxin moved backward instinctively until her back was pressed against a large tree.Xuan Yi glanced at the dead bodies and searched their storage rings.Other than some spirit herbs, there were also some books on dual cultivation in their storage rings. There was no antidote for this aphrodisiac pill.He frowned slightly and sat down opposite Song Qingxin.Her eyes were filled with desire. Under her scarlet clothes, her fair calves were covered with a pink luster.It seemed that the aphrodisiac pill that this woman had taken was of a high grade.Perhaps as those people had said, the pill was left behind by the ancient Joyous Union Sect.In this continent, the grade of a medicinal pill was very important for its effectsGenerally speaking, medicinal pills were divided into nine grades. The first grade was the lowest, and the ninth grade was the highest.However, there were still saint grade above the ninth grade\u2026The effects of medicinal pills above the saint grade would continue to strengthen as time passed.But the effects of a pill under the saint grade would decrease with time. In the end, its effects would be totally gone.It was obvious that the medicinal pill that Song Qingxin had consumed was at the saint-grade or above.Xuan Yi had noticed this.If the pill effect wasn\u2019t removed, it would affect her constitution and make her body crave for dual cultivation, thus crippling her talent in the sword Dao.He frowned slightly and hesitated. Finally, he still said slowly, \u201cThe medicinal pill you consumed is a saint grade pill. However, because this medicinal pill is from the antient time, it is difficult for you to refine it. You can only guide it out and can not suppress it.\u201d\u201cGuide it out and not suppress it?\u201dSong Qingxin had been wary of Xuan Yi, and his words made him a villain who wanted to advantage of her.\u201cIf I don\u2019t suppress it, then the pill will take effect and I will become\u2026 Humph! You just want my body, you villain.\u201d Song Qingxin\u2019s pretty face was pink as she looked at him warily.Xuan Yi was speechless. He had no interest in a little girl. He just wanted her to be his disciple.\u201cDon\u2019t you realize that the more you suppress it, the greater the drug effect is?\u201dSong Qingxin knew this, but if she didn\u2019t suppress it, the drug effect would overwhelm her. However, if she continued to suppress it, the drug would take over her rationality and she would give in to lust.Song Qingxin felt torn.Agitatedly, she asked, \u201cIf I don\u2019t suppress it, what should I do?\u201d\u201cFortify your spirit core and maintain a clear mind. Then, use your fire element cultivation technique to wrap the medicinal pill. First, do seven small cycles to refine it into your four limbs. Then, use the spirit energy and medicinal strength to counteract the corpse poison in your body. After the corpse poison is removed, do another large cycle to refine it into your Dantian and absorb the medicinal effect bit by bit, converting it into your own cultivation strength.\u201dXuan Yi had a better method to solve this problem, but in the current situation, this method was the most feasible.Song Qingxin knew he was right, but she was still conflicted.If she were to refine this thing, then she had to be very careful and couldn\u2019t be disturbed during the process.Since cultivated fire element technique, this aphrodisiac pill activated the burning fire in her body, adding fuel to fire!If she made a tiny mistake in the process, she didn\u2019t know what would happen to her.Song Qingxin\u2019s beautiful eyes glanced over and saw the platinum-colored small sword embroidered on Xuan Yi\u2019s chest. She felt a little better.He was a sword cultivator and had a handsome face, clear eyes and a calm expression. He didn\u2019t look like someone who\u2019d take advantage of others.Just as she was hesitating, Xuan Yi stood up and turned around.He said lightly, \u201cI\u2019ll stay and guard you, so you can focus on the refining.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Chapter 28: Mysterious ArrayHearing his words, Song Qingxin finally let down her guard.She exhaled deeply and looked deeply at Xuan Yi\u2019s back. She opened her mouth and said, \u201cThank you.\u201dSong Qingxin also knew that she was not Xuan Yi\u2019s match if she fought with him.If he wanted to take advantage of her, she would definitely not be able to resist.Hence, when she saw Xuan Yi turning his back, she remembered Oracle Granny\u2019s prophecy.A powerful sword Dao genius?The man in front of her was so young and graceful\u2026 Was he the person in the prophecy?She couldn\u2019t think about it anymore since her body was getting hotter!Song Qingxin shook her head vigorously, throwing all the distracting thoughts out of her mind.Without a word, she sat up and began to refine the pill.A fiery luster came out of her body, circulating in her limbs.Wisps of pure fire spirit energy began to fluctuate in the air.Xuan Yi scanned the air with his spiritual sense and felt the energy fluctuations in the air. He nodded slightly.This girl was suffering from corpse poison and aphrodisiac, but she was able to calm down and keep a clear head. Her state of mind was pretty good.However, at this moment, an extremely pure aura of death came from all directions.HMM?What exactly was this faintly aura of death?Moreover, it was sometimes strong and sometimes weak. It was really strange.Before Xuan Yi could react, a huge array suddenly appeared on the ground under their feet.The array was engraved with extremely mysterious ancient seal characters which emitted an extremely gloomy aura of death.Boom! ! !A huge fluctuation appeared in the air.A large cave dwelling exploded from the ground and stood in front of Xuan Yi.This\u2026Xuan Yi was shocked because he hadn\u2019t read any records about this mysterious cave dwelling. Most importantly, there was not a trace of spirit energy fluctuation when it appeared. He didn\u2019t even recognize the materials that were used to build the cave dwelling.It was indeed something made by a half-step Sage Realm cultivator.Few sects in the entire south domain could achieve such a feat.However, before Xuan Yi could react, a powerful force suddenly came from the mysterious cave abode and sucked him and Song Qingxin into it.Then the surrounding changed and Xuan Yi and Song Qingxin fell directly into the cave abode.In this dark space, Xuan Yi found himself was wrapped by a fiery body.It was Song Qingxin.At this moment, Song Qingxin\u2019s beautiful eyes were full of lust!When she was circulating her cultivation technique to remove the corpse poison and the aphrodisiac, her cultivation went wrong due to the sudden disturbance.Now, the spirit energy in her body was running wildly, and she wanted to vent it out!Her powerful fire element spirit energy had burned off most of her clothes, leaving only a scarlet undergarment. If it wasn\u2019t for the fire attribute of this undergarment, she would have been completely naked.However, even though she had a undergarment, her beautiful body was on display.Her shoulders and chest were exposed before Xuan Yi.Her eyes were misty, as if there was a pool of spring water in them. Her small mouth was slightly open, and the fragrance breath brushed his face. The fair skin on her back was as smooth as milk.She wrapped her arms around Xuan Yi\u2019s neck and her legs clamped tightly around his waist like an octopus.\u201cUH\u2026 uh\u2026\u201dSong Qingxin moaned and rubbed her head against Xuan Yi\u2019s chest with all her might.Suddenly, Xuan Yi\u2019s lips felt something soft.Wu.Before Xuan Yi could react, a silky suction force came from her mouth. Her small tongue even wandered into his mouth.This\u2026 this girl\u2026 actually dares to take liberties with me.Xuan Yi\u2019s eyes widened. He felt a little helpless and a bit aroused, too.Song Qingxin\u2019s figure was gorgeous and she cultivated fire element technique, so she felt like a small furnace, constantly emitting fatal heat from her body.Even though Xuan Yi was great in self-discipline, his mouth felt dry.He shook his head and calmed down, trying to push her away.The cave abode was something he hadn\u2019t expected.The information he had obtained in the sect\u2019s forbidden zone said nothing about this cave abode. Furthermore, it was a taboo for cultivators to let down their guard in an unfamiliar environment.Therefore, he did not dare to let down his guard.However, Song Qingxin was in the control of her lust and wouldn\u2019t let him go.She began to unbuttoned Xuan Yi\u2019s clothes and even reached down as if she wanted to grab something.Xuan Yi\u2019s fingers moved like butterflies and sealed her Taiyin acupoint, Tianshu acupoint, Zhongkui acupoint.\u201cPhew, this girl is too\u2026reckless.\u201d Xuan Yi heaved out a sigh of relief.He had immobilized her and temporarily stabilized the energies in her body.And at this moment, just as Xuan Yi was thinking what to do next, a refreshing fragrance came into his nose.\u201cEh? It\u2019s actually the scent of the Ice-cold Grass.\u201dThe corners of his mouth curled up slightly.Where there was Ice-cold Grass, there usually was the Ice Spirit Fruit, which was the key to activating the Ice Physique for his eldest disciple, Lin Yingxue.This was his goal for this trip. Even if he couldn\u2019t find the Ice Spirit Fruit, the Ice-cold Grass was very effective in treating corpse poison.The reason why the aphrodisiac had such a strong effect on Song Qingxin was that she had corpse poison in her body.The faster she circulated her cultivation technique, the deeper the corpse poison spread, which in turn increased the strength of the aphrodisiac.If Song Qingxin\u2019s corpse poison was removed, then she could force out the aphrodisiac by herself.With this thought in mind, Xuan Yi quickly walked towards the direction of the Icy-cold Grass with Song Qingxin in his arms. Right now, she was resting motionless in his arms with her eyes closed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Chapter 29: Enchanting Spring SceneryXuan Yi\u2019s heart was filled with joy when he looked over, but then a trace of worry entered his eyes.He was delighted to discover that there was a large patch of Ice-cold Grass here, but the deeper he walked into the abode, the stronger the suppression on his cultivation strength grew, which worried him.\u201cCould it be that this place is Li Wendao\u2019s core region? Maybe that\u2019s why my cultivation strength is suppressed to the third level from the fifth level of Law Enforcement Realm.\u201dXuan Yi calmed himself down and tried to figure out what was happening.When he was outside the cave abode, there was only a suppression on talent. Now, in this cave abode, it was a suppression of one\u2019s strength. It seemed to be telling people that they\u2019d lose their lives if they wanted to enter this place.Xuan Yi stopped and was about to pick the grass when he saw a huge footprint on the ground.This footprint was about half a meter long and more than twenty centimeters wide. It was the footprint of a demonic ape.Xuan Yi recognized that it was a demonic ape footprint according to the information he had gathered previously.The spirit herbs were usually guarded by powerful demonic beasts. He could see that the owner of this footprint was an adult ape.\u201cWell, this place is very odd. Although there might be better herbs further into the abode, I\u2019d better heal this girl now, so she won\u2019t hinder my progress.\u201dXuan Yi waved his hand, and a white spirit light appeared on his hand and then spread over the medicinal herbs on the ground.Under the guidance of his spirit energy, the Ice-cold Grass rose and gathered in Xuan Yi\u2019s hand.Xuan Yi condensed his spirit energy and dissolved the grass in his hand, turning it into an extremely pure medicinal aura. Then he turned the medicinal essence into invisible needles.At this moment, Song Qingxin\u2019s eyes were tightly shut and her spirit energy circulation was paused by Xuan Yi. The corpse poison on her arm continued to spread and had reached her chest.Seeing this, Xuan Yi pause.\u201cLittle girl, I\u2019m sorry, but anyway this is not the first time that I see you body.\u201dAfter saying that, he pulled up her red undergarment.Song Qingxin was as beautiful as a fairy and her figure was gorgeous.Under the effects of the aphrodisiac pill, she let out small moaning sounds, which made her look even more seductive. The sight of her smooth and delicate lower abdomen and high breasts could ignite any man\u2019s primal desire.Xuan Yi swallowed at the sight but he quickly suppressed his arousal.To heal her, he needed to inject the drug essence into her and let her spirit energy circulate it in her body.So, he needed to unseal her acupoints and allow her spiritual energy to circulate freely to completely get rid of the corpse poison from her body.After Xuan Yi unsealed her acupoints, Song Qingxin instantly pounced on him in a daze.Xuan Yi\u2019s lips felt the familiar softness. He opened his mouth slightly, and a small, moist tongue made its way in.As their tongues intertwined together, Xuan Yi\u2019s eyes opened abruptly. He stiffened as if he had been struck by lightning.This was the second time\u2026But before Xuan Yi could react, Song Qingxin got more aggressive, colliding with Xuan Yi\u2019s body with force.The two tongues continued to entangle with each other. The wonderful pleasure washed over Xuan Yi\u2019s mind, and his hands became bolder, as if he wanted to become one with her.As the fire of desire rose, Xuan Yi\u2019s mind went blank as he grabbed Song Qingxin\u2019s willowy waist, and slowly moved up to her breasts.The soft and elastic feel of her flesh woke him up.This\u2026 This was not right!Previously, he was able to maintain a clear head outside the cave dwelling. However, after entering the cave dwelling, everything felt unreal.Xuan Yi stood up and pressed Song Qingxin to the ground. Immediately, he formed a seal with his right hand and the invisible medicinal energy in his palm entered her body through the acupuncture points in her lower abdomen, neck, arms, and buttocks.His hands moved back and forth on her body, finding every acupuncture point that contained the poisonous gas. Then, he used the medicinal energy to force all the poisonous gas out of her body.Slowly, the medicinal energy spread and forced the poisonous gas out of Song Qingxin\u2019s body.The black poisonous gas on her chest dissipated gradually, and her breathing became steady while her skin turned pink.Xuan Yi calmed himself down and covered her with his outer robe.After all, Song Qingxin was naked and her skin was so fair that she looked like a light bulb in this dark place. it might attracted the attention of the demonic beasts.Xuan Yi checked her breathing and pulse and found they were normal.He planned to go and look for the Ice Spirit Fruit. Since there was a big field of Ice-cold Grass, there must be some Ice Spirit Fruits nearby.Just as Xuan Yi was about to leave, Song Qingxin opened her misty eyes.Their eyes met.Then, Song Qingxin feel that there was a mysterious aura of another cultivator in her body. Her face paled in fear.She shouted, \u201cAh! You\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish, a warm hand covered her mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t talk. It\u2019s very dangerous here,\u201d Xuan Yi whispered to her.But song Qingxin didn\u2019t care. With her mouth covered, she began to shed tears. Then, she gritted her teeth and bit on Xuan Yi\u2019s thumb.Xuan Yi was exasperated.This girl had talent, looks, and a good figure. However, she wasn\u2019t very smart.It seemed that she was a pampered girl who did not have any survival skills.Of course, Xuan Yi was not worried that she would hurt him. With her weak strength, she wouldn\u2019t make a dent in his thumb. However, the aura of an unknown demonic beast floated over from the darkness, making him a little worried.\u201cStop it. Do you want to draw the demonic ape over to us?\u201d Xuan Yi said coolly.\u201cDemonic ape?\u201d Song Qingxin loosened her teeth and said absent-mindedly.Her eyes were filled with fear and disgust.If there was a demonic beast that the cultivators of the Cang Xuan Land hated the most, then this demonic man ape would bear the brunt of it.This demon beast was not only cruel, but most importantly, it would rape cultivators, regardless of gender.When the cultivators were tortured to the point of death, it would eat them.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Chapter 30: The Demon Ape\u201cThen why are you treating me like this? You\u2019re no different than the demon apes\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m doing this to save your life. Didn\u2019t you notice that the corpse poison in your body is gone?\u201dSong Qingxin carefully examined her body and was surprised that the corpse poison was really gone.A wave of gratitude rose in her heart, but in the next second, she felt his taste in her mouth, and her pretty face quickly turned dark red.\u201cThen\u2026 then did you need to\u2026 need to use your mouth to save my life?\u201d Song Qingxin lowered her head. She sneaked a glance at him and found that Xuan Yi had sword-like eyebrows and bright eyes. He was a very handsome man.She lamented silently: Oh My God, he\u2019s actually so handsome, eh\u2026 He\u2019s different from those rough men at home who forge iron and weapons every day. It seems that it wasn\u2019t a bad deal to be kissed by him.\u201cUse my mouth? If it wasn\u2019t to remove your corpse poison, how could I let you have your way?\u201d\u201cLet me have my way? You mean\u2026\u201d Song Qingxin began to recall. Although she wasn\u2019t herself before, her body remembered how it felt. After recalling carefully, she would know who had taken the initiative.After a while, her face turned as red as an apple.Uh\u2026 it turned she had taken the initiative.However, she found that her body like what he did to her.Song Qingxin\u2019s face was flushed red, and her body shook slightly at the discovery.When Xuan Yi saw this, he thought that aphrodisiac pill was torturing her again.He said coolly, \u201cAlthough your cultivation strength is currently suppressed, if you use the method I taught you to refine the pill, your cultivation strength will increase instead of decreasing.\u201dWhen Song Qingxin heard this, she quickly covered her petite body with Xuan Yi\u2019s outer robe and began refining the pill with Xuan Yi\u2019s method.She glanced over and saw the small black sword on Xuan Yi\u2019s plain-colored robe.Eh?Sword\u2026 sword cultivator! ?Could it be that he was the peerless swordsman in Oracle Granny\u2019s prophecy?Was he the peerless genius who would teach her the supreme sword Dao?As these thoughts raced in her mind, Xuan Yi\u2019s faint voice sounded in her ears.\u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d\u201cOh? He\u2019s here? What\u2019s here?\u201dSong Qingxin was a little dumbfounded. She had been using all her spirit energy to suppress the pill in her body, so she couldn\u2019t detect disturbances around them.Boom!A huge figure appeared in front of them. It was the demonic ape.The demonic ape in front of them was over 30 meters tall. Its entire body was pitch-black, but its eyes were bloodthirsty scarlet. Its entire body was covered in thick black fur, and its limbs were strong and powerful. It exuded the cultivation aura of the first level of the Golden Core realm. It was obvious that it could kill an opponent of the same level with a single punch.Song Qingxin\u2019s eyes widened, and the blush on her pretty face faded in fear.One had to know that even if she went all out to deal with such a demonic beast, she might not be able to defeat it, let alone now that her cultivation was suppressed.What should she do?At this time, Song Qingxin\u2019s mind was blank.She was a prodigy in the Mid Land and the young mistress of the Mystic Fire Pavilion, but the Mystic Fire Pavilion\u2019s main strength was forging powerful artifacts.Only by combining her cultivation strength with her spirit sword in her hand could she have powerful battle strength.But now she couldn\u2019t do it.Moreover, as the young mistress of her family, she was used to doing things her own way. She simply didn\u2019t take her father\u2019s words to heart. Instead of inheriting the family power, she had run away from home to pursue the sword Dao.She just had no experience combating such a terrifying and disgusting demonic beast.Actually, she was quite brave that she hadn\u2019t fainted.At this moment, the demonic ape sniffed and seemed to have sensed a delicious smell. Its scarlet eyes swept over.It stared straight at Song Qingxin. If she was captured, she would be tortured to death by it.Song Qingxin\u2019s heart sank to the bottom of her stomach. Her mind was filled with fear, but her body still instinctively leaned towards Xuan Yi.\u201cHumph! Hairy beast, get out of my sight immediately, or you\u2019ll die!\u201d Xuan Yi raised his two fingers and pointed at it like a sword with intense sword intent in his eyes.The demonic ape felt Xuan Yi\u2019s powerful aura and was a little afraid. However, Song Qingxin was a tempting toy in its eyes and it didn\u2019t want to give up so easily.It had been in this place for hundreds of years. In this area with abundant spirit energy, it had tremendous combat strength and had never met an opponent who could defeat it.Therefore, it roared furiously and charged forward, intending to break through Xuan Yi\u2019s defense and grab Song Qingxin. Then, it would escape relying on its powerful physical body and its familiarity with this area.However, it had overestimated its own strength and underestimated Xuan Yi\u2019s perception.\u201cRidiculous hairy beast, you dare to you act impudently in front of me!\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s two fingers pointed at it, and a vast stream of sword energy broke through the sky and the void!Hiss!A huge stream of sword energy slashed towards the demonic ape and cut off its right hand.Blood splattered all over the ground, and its smell was very foul.However, Xuan Yi did not kill it because he found a trace of ice attribute in the spirit energy in this demonic ape\u2019s body. It was obvious that this demonic beast was from this area of Ice-cold Grass.If he could make the demonic ape submit to him, he might be able to find the Ice Spirit Fruit.This item was the goal of this trip. He must find it.The demonic ape was stunned by Xuan Yi\u2019s powerful strength. For a moment, he did not dare to move.\u201cLet me ask you, do you know if there is an Ice Spirit Fruit nearby?\u201d Xuan Yi said in a harsh voice.Having reached the Golden Core Realm, the demonic beast understood simple words.Its face distorted in fear, the demonic ape immediately knelt down and begged for mercy.It spoke in an extremely obscure beast language, but the meaning was simple and clear.It nodded desperately, and used its remaining arm to point into the distance.All of this indicated that the object that Xuan Yi mentioned was somewhere ahead of them.\u201cWell, lead the way. If what you said is true, I\u2019ll reward you. Otherwise, you\u2019ll lose the other arm.\u201dHearing Xuan Yi\u2019s words, the demonic ape kneeling on the ground looked extremely conflicted.It shook its head desperately, as if there was a great danger ahead.\u201cHumph! Do you want to die?\u201d Xuan Yi\u2019s aura expanded.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Chapter 31: Song Qingxin\u2019s WorriesHowever, no matter how Xuan Yi strengthened his aura on the demonic ape, it just lay on the ground and did not get up.Crack!The demonic ape felt a huge pain in its body as all its the bones were crushed by Xuan Yi.Although this kind of injury wasn\u2019t fatal and the demonic ape had a strong recovery ability, it would still need some time to recover.Xuan Yi was not a bloodthirsty person. He was just worried that after he left, the Demonic Ape would harm Song Qingxin.Fine, now I can go and get the Ice Spirit Fruit.Xuan Yi made up his mind and stood up.Just as he was about to leave, Song Qingxin stood up, too.\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting\u2026 It\u2019s still thinking about those dirty things.\u201d Song Qingxin looked at the fallen demonic beast with disdain.\u201cDon\u2019t leave me behind\u2026 I want to go with you.\u201d She staggered to her feet and hurriedly followed Xuan Yi. She did not want to stay with this ugly demonic ape, even though it was able to move.\u201cOh?\u201d Xuan Yi glanced at Song Qingxin.\u201cUH\u2026 This, I\u2026\u201dSong Qingxin was a little embarrassed and said with a red face, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will not drag you down. If you leave me here, I\u2019ll be very afraid\u2026\u201dXuan Yi was not worried that she would drag him down. He found that she could actually do other things while refining pills.Could it be that she was telepathic?Telepathic was a divine ability. Among the top 500 divine ability ranking, it was at the bottom because this divine ability couldn\u2019t give its owner combat strength and could not be learned. It was a natural-born talent. It explained why it was at the bottom of the list.However, no one would underestimate this divine ability. With this divine ability, one could multitask in the early stage, and at the later stage, one could read thoughts of other people and even the thoughts of spirit things, such as spirit swords.It must be known that in the Cang Xuan Land, there were many strange races with different mentalities, which caused many unnecessary disputes. So people with this divine ability could easily communicate with other races and travel across the land conveniently.If he had a disciple with this divine ability, when her strength was great, he might be able to obtain this ability with help of the system.One had to know that such an ability was natural-born and couldn\u2019t be obtained by learning.\u201cWe are in the mystical realm\u2019s spiritual medicine region now. The more abundant the spirit energy is, the more powerful the guarding demonic beasts are. Even Ice-cold Grass is guarded by a powerful demonic ape, which means there are many dangers out there. Do you still want to go with me?\u201dXuan Yi did not refuse her, nor did he agree. He just looked at her with a steady gaze.He had long discovered the biggest problem with this girl. It was not that her talent was not good or her strength was not great, but that she did not think carefully before she acted, which was why she had fallen into the trap.If she did not change her reckless way of doing things, it was only a matter of time before she died.Thinking of this, Xuan Yi calmed down a little. Even if this young girl was not even sixteen years old, and her cultivation was at the second level of the Golden Core Realm, he didn\u2019t want to take her in as a disciple.After all, she couldn\u2019t even protect herself. How could such a person be his disciple?\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026don\u2019t know\u2026\u201dSong Qingxin lowered her head, like a child who had done something wrong.\u201cSince I was little, I have always been alone. Father devotes all this time and energy in making artifacts, and he wants to create the world\u2019s most powerful spirit sword, so naturally, he doesn\u2019t have time to accompany me. When I was five years old, I wanted to study swordsmanship and travel the world. Father only said that I should stay at home and inherit the family business, and not wander around randomly. He said after I created a powerful spirit sword, I would be able to do whatever I wanted in the world. I believed it, but\u2026\u201d. Song Qingxin\u2019s eyes reddened, she paused for a moment and slowly said, \u201cBut nothing changed. The only happy moment for me was when I broke through to the Golden Core Realm. My father and I were happy for it. Except for that, I don\u2019t seem to have any memories about my life.\u201dXuan Yi said indifferently, \u201cI have no interest in your life story. Answer my question: There are many dangers ahead; do you still want to go with me?\u201dSong Qingxin\u2019s body trembled. She clenched her fists and said hesitantly, \u201cI\u2026\u201dShe stammered and did not know what to say. It was obvious that she was frightened by this unfamiliar environment.Xuan Yi exhaled and said seriously, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll ask you another question.\u201d\u201cWhat is your dream?\u201dMy dream?Song Qingxin\u2019s heart trembled and her body shook.This question made her recall the time when she was five years old. She was practicing sword techniques under the setting sun with a wooden sword with her mother.\u201cQingxin, why do you study the swordsmanship?\u201d\u201cBecause I want to be like Mother and become a swordswoman to save the world.\u201d\u201cAhem, like Mother? But I\u2019m no longer a swordswoman.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Little Song Qingxin asked.Her mother smiled but did not say anything. She patted little Song Qingxin\u2019s head and said lightly, \u201cBecause I have already abandoned the sword in my heart.\u201dAbandoned the sword in the heart?Why was there a sword in her heart? And why did she abandon it?Little Song Qingxin did not understand it, but after hearing Xuan Yi\u2019s question, she understood now.I have long since abandoned the sword in my heart. Hehe, I don\u2019t even know where the sword in my hand has gone.Song Qingxin laughed at herself and said, \u201cMy dream\u2026 My dream is to become a swordswoman like my mother.\u201dThis answer naturally didn\u2019t satisfy Xuan Yi.\u201cLive under your mother\u2019s shadow? How sad! Just stay where you are and wait for me. After the expedition ends, I will take you out of here.\u201dAfter saying that, Xuan Yi left.At this time, Song Qingxin felt empty inside. It was not because of Xuan Yi\u2019s departure, but because of Xuan Yi\u2019s words just now. She had lived her whole life in her mother\u2019s shadow.She began to think.\u201cDoes he mean that I should live for himself? Yes, it must be so. I wasn\u2019t really happy even when I broke through to the Golden Core Realm at the age of fifteen. I just did it for my father. I want to live for myself.\u201dThinking of this, song Qingxin\u2019s eyes became firm. She quickly stood up and then shouted as she ran, \u201cI understand now. I want to live for myself. I want to live for my own sword Dao. I\u2019m not looking for a powerful swordsman because I want to become a peerless swordswoman myself. I want to protect the weak, kill the evil, and shine in the world!\u201dHowever, the corridor was empty. There was no sound at all.Just when she thought that Xuan Yi had gone, his gentle voice came,\u201cIt seems that you have found your direction. Come then.\u201dA gentle wave of spirit energy carried her to Xuan Yi\u2019s side.However, at this moment, the scent of a powerful demon beast floated to Xuan Yi\u2019s nose.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Chapter 32: Chapter 32:\u201cWhat a strong demonic aura.\u201d Xuan Yi frowned slightly and walked toward the direction of the demonic aura.This corridor was extremely winding and dark, which made this corridor seem very deep.Most importantly, his cultivation was suppressed even more with every step he took as if there was a mysterious thing in the corridor that didn\u2019t want them to touch it.Right now, Xuan Yi\u2019s cultivation strength was suppressed to the third level of the Law Enforcement Realm. Song Qingxin\u2019s cultivation strength was also suppressed.\u201cStrange, it\u2019s cold here,\u201d Song Qingxin said.She had Heavenly Flame Physique and thus was very sensitive to the chill.Right at this moment, an extremely violent aura swept toward themHiss!A ten-meter-long python was coiling in a field of medicinal herbs. Its two vertical pupils were filled with a biting cold aura. Its entire body was covered in azure-colored shining scales that emitted a chilly aura.This great demon stuck out its tongue with its eyes staring fixedly at a light blue flower in the field.It was the Ice Spirit Fruit.\u201cOh my God\u2026 that is\u2026'song Qingxin\u2019s beautiful eyes widened and covered her mouth with her left hand. She pointed at the huge blue demon beast in front of them with her right hand and cried out involuntarily.\u201cIce Crystal Black Python,\u201d Xuan Yi said indifferently.Ice Crystal Black Python was a spirit beast.There was a fundamental difference between a spirit beast and a demon beast. All spirit beasts were born from the spirit energy between the heaven and the earth, and they were extremely powerful. Some special spirit beasts were born with peak level of strength.In contrast, ordinary beasts could only gain strength through continuous cultivation and opportunities. Moreover, due to the limit in their physiques, their strength might stop growing after reaching a certain level.Although this Ice Crystal black Python was not a top-grade spirit beast, it was a powerful one in the Tian Xuan Land.This kind of demonic beast was born with a strength at the fifth level of the Golden Core Realm. After it became an adult, it could reach the Super Power Realm with ease. If it was lucky, it could even reach the Law Enforcement Realm.The Ice Crystal Black Python in front of them was only ten meters long. Obviously, it was a young one with the cultivation strength of the seventh level of the Golden Core Realm.Song Qingxin\u2019s heart raced in fear, but she quickly calmed down.\u201cOh my God, you\u2026 Are you going to fight with it for this spirit herb?\u201d Song Qingxin asked when she saw that Xuan Yi was staring at the Ice Spirit Fruit.She thought Xuan Yi\u2019s cultivation strength was the same as hers, probably at the Golden Core Realm since he was so young.\u201cYes,\u201d Xuan Yi said lightly.He found that the Ice Spirit Fruit was about to ripen, and his attention was focused on the light blue spirit herb. Obviously, the Ice Crystal Black Python was also waiting for the Ice Spirit Fruit to ripen.Seeing Xuan Yi\u2019s quick reply, Song Qingxin was even more panicked.\u201cAccording to the records, the Ice Crystal Black Python is a spirit beast. I can\u2019t see through the spiritual energy fluctuations coming from its body, but obviously it\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d Song Qingxin kindly reminded Xuan Yi.\u201cSo what? It\u2019s just a beast. If it dares to fight me, I\u2019ll kill it with a single sword slash!\u201d Xuan Yi said lightly.What?Kill it with a single sword slash?You couldn\u2019t even kill a demonic ape. Now, you\u2019re facing a spirit beast that\u2019s much stronger than it. You\u2019re actually saying you\u2019ll kill it with a single sword slash?Song Qingxin\u2019s mind was filled with doubts. Right now, she wasn\u2019t thinking about how Xuan Yi could kill this black python. Instead, she was thinking about whether or not he could break its scales.At this moment, the light blue grass emitted a dark blue light, showing that the Ice Spirit Fruit was ripe.The Ice Crystal Black Python began to swallow and spit its tongue at a faster rate. It was excited.However, at this critical moment, a man wearing blue clothes appeared.There was a pattern of blue cloud embroidered on his chest.He was from the Ice Cloud Palace, one of top 100 sects of the south domain.\u201cHumph! Evil creature, you dare to covet this natural treasure!\u201d The man shouted loudly with violent spirit energy emitting from his hand.The blue spirit energy fluctuations showed that his cultivation strength was at the eighth level of the Golden Core Realm.\u201cCome on, senior brother Liu, this beast is only at the seventh level of the Golden Core Realm. You can kill it with just one palm strike!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, you are a genius of our Ice Cloud Palace. Fighting above your level is easy for you, let alone killing this beast.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, senior brother Liu Yun is ranked 891st on our south domain\u2019s prodigy list. Among the countless cultivators in the top 100 great sects, there are only a thousand people on the prodigy list. Everyone on the list is a genius cultivator.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m sure senior brother Liu can kill this demon with a single palm strike.\u201d A cultivator from the Ice Cloud Palace patted his chest and said flatteringly.\u2026Hearing their words, Xuan Yi was a bit stunned because the senior brother Liu in their mouths and the other cultivators had unstable realms, but they did not have the kind of suppression that Xuan Yi was under.Xuan Yi was puzzled.Could it be that the outer region of the mystic realm had suppression for those with poor talent, while the inner area of the mystic realm had a suppression for the highly talented cultivators?If that was the case, then these people from the Ice Cloud Palace had been accidentally teleported into this cave abode.And this spiritual beast was obviously talented. It was a natural product of this kind of environment. Not to mention its cultivation strength, its physical strength alone was much greater than that of an ordinary demon beast of the same cultivation level.However, senior brother Liu, who was hovering in the air, clearly did not know it.The smile around his mouth and the spirit light shining in his palm indicated that he was extremely confident.\u201cAttack!\u201d\u201cIce Cloud Palm! !\u201dUnder everyone\u2019s expectant gazes, he launched his strongest killing move.Bang! ! !With the huge sound, and a large amount of dust blocked everyone\u2019s view.Liu Yun smiled faintly. No ice-element creature could survive under his Ice Cloud Palm.That\u2019s right, it was any ice-type creature.In the Cang Xuan Land, cultivation techniques of different attributes could restrain each other. For example, this Ice Crystal Black Python\u2019s strength was higher than Song Qingxin\u2019s; since their techniques had different attributes, the python\u2019s techniques would have a restraining effect on hers.If it was a clash between two opponents of the same attributes, the one with greater strength would have a restraining effect on the weaker one.And Liu Yun\u2019s strength was higher than this demon beast, so in theory, this demon beast was not his match.Of course, this was only Liu Yun\u2019s idea.However, the reality was that the Ice Crystal Black Python\u2019s scales were shining since it had absorbed Liu Yun\u2019s ice attribute cultivation strength.\u201cWhat?\u201d Liu Yun was full of disbelief.His companions from the Ice Cloud Palace had the same expression on their faces.\u201cThis\u2026 This is impossible. Senior brother Liu Yun is at the eighth level of the Golden Core Realm, how could he not defeat a seventh level Golden Core Demonic demon beast?\u201d\u201cI know the reason. It\u2019s because our cultivation technique is not strong enough.\u201d\u201cBullshit! The Ice Cloud Palm that senior brother Liu used was the most powerful palm technique of our Ice Cloud Palace. It is a high-grade cultivation technique and can defeat cultivators of the same level. In the last south domain genius ranking battle, he has gained his ranking with this cultivation technique.\u201dIn the Tian Xuan Land, cultivation techniques were categorized according to their quality. They were divided into four levels: heaven, earth, black, and yellow. As for those above the heaven grade, the people of Tian Xuan did not know about them.However, even a low-grade black grade technique was considered a sect treasure in the top 100 sects of the south domain.At this moment, a square-faced male cultivator said in a deep voice, \u201cLiu Yun, quickly retreat. You can\u2019t defeat this demon!\u201d\u201cHumph! Yue Zhan, I was the one who saw the Ice Spirit Fruit first. You want me to retreat so you can take this opportunity to seize the spirit fruit, right? Fortunately, the Ice Cloud Palace has obtained the Ice Emperor\u2019s inheritance. Don\u2019t even think about it!\u201d Liu Yun ridiculed.\u201cAlthough the Ice Spirit Fruit can refine the body, it can only be activated by a spirit physique. It is not as simple as you think. In addition, the Ice Emperor\u2019s inheritance can only be inherited by the holy son of the sect,\u201d Yue Zhan said calmly.\u201cRidiculous! Stay out of my business!\u201d Liu Yun laughed arrogantly. \u201cIt\u2019s just a seventh level Golden Core Realm demon beast. Watch carefully. I\u2019ll kill it today.\u201dYue Zhan was thirty years old this year, and he was the strongest among the disciples of the Ice Cloud Palace. Now, he was at the ninth level of the Golden Core Realm, and he was sent here by the sect master to protect these disciples.Yue Zhan frowned. Although he didn\u2019t like unruly Liu Yun, he had to admit that Liu Yun was indeed the number one genius of the Ice Cloud Palace.At the age of twenty-three, he had broken through to the eighth level of the Golden Core Realm. He was the most understanding disciple in the Ice Cloud Palace except for the holy son of the Ice Cloud Palace.\u201cEvil creature, prepare to die.\u201d Liu Yun emitted an even more powerful ice spirit energy, forming a body armor covering his entire body. He actually intended to fight head-on with the Ice Crystal Black Python.Xuan Yi shook his head when he saw this. The most powerful thing about the python was not its cultivation strength, but its incomparably powerful physical body.And Liu Yun decided to engage in a physical battle with a demonic beast, which indicated that this person had little battle experience. The correct method was to use the advantage of his higher cultivation strength level to engage in a lengthy battle with the demonic beast until it died\u2026However, Liu Yun had chosen the most foolish method.Sure enough, Liu Yun was soon struck by the demonic beast\u2019s tail, his face was as pale as a piece of white paper as he spat out blood.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll lend you a hand.\u201d Seeing that Liu Yun was no match for the demon beast, Yue Zhan released his spirit energy and strode forward.On the battlefield, after Yuan Zhan entered the fray, the python gradually retreated covered in blood.Just as they were locked in a stalemate, Song Qingxin\u2019s nose twitched and she found that the spirit energy of the Ice Spirit Fruit had the effect of suppressing the aphrodisiac pill in her body. Moreover, she had noticed that Xuan Yi was waiting for this fruit to ripen.She immediately moved to the side of the Ice Spirit Fruit.\u201cHa, I got it.\u201d Song Qingxin was delighted. She looked at the fruit in her hand and rushed back to Xuan Yi\u2019s side.\u201cWho are you? How dared you take things from our Ice Cloud Palace? Are you tired of living?!\u201d Liu Yun shouted.Although he was seriously injured, his aura grew even stronger.Yue Zhan also frowned.While they were fighting fiercely with the demon beasts, a stranger had taken the opportunity to snatch the fruit, which made them very angry.Liu Yun saw that Xuan Yi and Song Qingxin were only two people and Song Qingxin\u2019s cultivation strength was weak, as if her strength was suppressed by something. Liu Yun got bolder.\u201cHumph! You have the guts to steal from our Ice Cloud Palace? We\u2019ll hunt you down!\u201d A cold light flashed in Liu Yun\u2019s hand and killed the Ice Crystal Black Python which had been on the verge of death.\u201cIf you hand over the Ice Spirit Fruit, I can let bygones be bygones,\u201d Yue Zhan said in a grave voice.\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. You thieves just stole it while senior brother Yue fought against the Ice Crystal Black Python. You\u2019re cowards!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, you\u2019re trash. We\u2019ll beat you every time we see you in the south domain.\u201dXuan Yi narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, \u201cThief? The Sage Mystic realm was created by the ancestor of Our Profound Sword Sect. Logically speaking, all the items in here belong to our Profound Sword Sect. How can you call me a thief?\u201d\u201cAre you from the Profound Sword Sect?\u201d Yue Zhan\u2019s mind spun rapidly, wondering which genius cultivator of the Profound Sword Sect this person was.However, Xuan Yi had never participated in the genius ranking battle in the south domain, so Yue Zhan had never seen him.\u201cThe Profound Sword Sect? It has long declined. Right now, it only holds the title of the top 100 in the south domain. When the holy son of our Ice Cloud Palace obtains the Ice Emperor\u2019s inheritance, he will naturally take the first place in this southern domain\u2019s genius ranking. When that time comes, your Profound Sword Sect might not even exist,\u201d Liu Yun said disdainfully.\u201cMy friend from the Profound Sword Sect, you\u2019d better hand it over now and I\u2019ll make sure that my junior brothers won\u2019t make things difficult for you. Otherwise\u2026\u201d Yue Zhan had quickly reviewed in his mind the geniuses from the Profound Sword Sect. Thinking that Xuan Yi wasn\u2019t on the genius list, his voice became harsher.Xuan Yi\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. The faint demonic aura in the surroundings grew stronger and stronger.He hadn\u2019t made a move yet because there was a big fellow underground and he had to protect Song Qingxin. If he made a move, he was afraid that something would happen to this area.\u201cHumph! Otherwise what?\u201d Song Qingxin placed her hands on her hips and yelled from behind Xuan Yi.\u201cOtherwise, even immortals can\u2019t save you two ! !\u201dLiu Yun took a Spirit Energy Restoration Pill and spoke threateningly.However, as he spoke, an Ice Crystal Black Python that was even more powerful than the previous one broke out from the underground!It swallowed Liu Yun in one gulp!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Chapter 33: The Star Picking TechniqueRoar! ! ! !The earth-shaking roar shook people\u2019s hearts, and raging flames burst out!\u201cMy God, there\u2019s actually another Ice Crystal Black Python here!\u201d\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s fifty meters long, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s an adult?\u201d\u201cWho can defeat such a terrifying demonic beast?\u201d\u201cSenior brother Liu Yun was instantly killed. His strength of the seventh level of Golden Core Realm is puny in front of this python.\u201d\u201cSuch great power. I\u2019m afraid the python has reached the Divine Power Realm.\u201d\u201cOh my God, can anyone help me?\u201d\u2026The disciples of the Ice Cloud Palace were panicked. When they thought that they would follow in the footsteps of Liu Yun, the Ice Crystal Black Python turned around and attacked Xuan Yi and Song Qinxin.This python at the Divine Power Realm was the mother of the Golden Core Realm Black python. Its child was killed by Liu Yun, so how could it let him live? and the Ice Spirit Fruit was a treasure that helped its child to cultivate. Seeing that it was taken by Xuan Yi and Song Qinxin, it would not let them leave with it.It opened its nearly five-meter wide bloody mouth to swallow them alive.A fishy smell assailed her nostrils. Song Qingxin was so scared that she was drenched in cold sweat. Her small face was deathly pale. Her small hand held tightly onto Xuan Yi\u2019s robe, her heart filled with regret.It was over. If she had known the consequence, she would not have picked this spirit fruit. Now, the python would kill not only her but Xuan Yi.\u201cHMPH, with your skills, you dare to be impudent in front of me!\u201d Xuan Yi grabbed at the air with his hand.It was the Emperor Level divine ability, Star Picking Technique!A big hand instantly materialized in the air. The hand was shining with starlight and engulfed in a river of stars.It grabbed this great demon of the Divine Power Realm. With a light squeeze of the hand, the python exploded!The Ice Crystal Black Python, which was fierce and awe-inspiring just a moment ago, had disappeared. Not even a trace of flesh and blood was left. Only a blue demonic core was left in its place.Gulp.The sound of swallowing came from the disciples of the Ice Cloud Palace. They eyes were wide open and their bodies were drenched in cold sweat.To use a word to describe it, they were dumbstruck. They did not utter a single sound, or rather, they did not dare to make a sound.My God, this\u2026 Was this something that a human could do?Such a large demonic beast was gone just like that?Not even a bit of dregs was left?They had been thinking that the body of the Golden Core Realm black python could be used to refine good spirit weapons. In the end, Xuan Yi had crushed a Divine Power Realm demon beast to death. His palm was even more powerful than a spirit weapon.Yue Zhan was even more stunned than the others, knowing that the technique Xuan Yi had launched was a divine ability!The person in front of him was at least a master of the Divine Power Realm. Furthermore, he had used a divine ability to crush a demon beast of the Divine Power Realm to death.One had to know that the divine ability of this Ice Crystal Black Python was on its physical body. To be able to instantly kill it like this, his power\u2026was simply too terrifying.Moreover, that big hand with shining starlight had shaken his heart. He only had one thought on his mind: blocking the sky with one hand!To be able to kill an ice crystal black python so easily, there were only two explanations for it.Either his realm was extremely high, or his cultivation level was extremely high, or more terrifyingly, both.Yue Zhan smiled bitterly.Before meeting Xuan Yi, Yue Zhan had thought that Liu Yun was a genius since the latter could leave his name in the genius list, but after meeting Xuan Yi and seeing him use such a violent technique, he knew that Liu Yun was nothing compared to this fierce man in front of him.If Liu Yun, was a genius, then this fierce man would be a divine dragon from the heavens!It turned out that what the sect master said was right. In the south domain, one couldn\u2019t simply look at genius list. Many peerless geniuses chose to conceal their talents.However, when Yue Zhan thought about how he had shamelessly threatened Xuan Yi, fear immediately surged in his heart.With his strength, he had actually dared to be so arrogant. He was simply seeking his death.It turned out that the more powerful a cultivator was, the more low keyed he was. Today, he had learnt a lesson.Yue Zhan was drenched in cold sweat and kept his head lowered, not daring to look in Xuan Yi\u2019s direction. He didn\u2019t even dare to take a deep breath, hoping that Xuan Yi wouldn\u2019t notice him.As all of this happened in a flash, Song Qingxin still looked dazed.Xuan Yi patted her head with his left hand, which calmed her down.Her eyes were filled with panic at first, but the panic quickly turned into disbelief, then shock, and finally, ecstasy.Xuan Yi had solved the greatest crisis with a casual attack. How could she not be ecstatic?Her beautiful eyes sparkled as she looked at Xuan Yi with a burning gaze. She became more and more attached to Xuan Yi.It seemed that as long as Xuan Yi was around, she would always be safe.\u201cRight, repeat what you just said. Or else what?\u201d Xuan Yi said indifferently to Yue Zhan who stood with other cultivators of the Ice Cloud Palace.Xuan Yi\u2019s words were like a heavy hammer, not only hitting Yue Zhan\u2019s chest, but also hitting the hearts of the other cultivators from the Ice Cloud Palace.Xuan Yi had not wanted to make things difficult for these people. Firstly, they were all cultivators of the south domain. Secondly, in this mysterious Sage Secret Realm, everything looked weird. Even the people of the Yin Corpse Sect of the west domain had come here.So he was cautious and didn\u2019t want to make enemies.However, these people from the Ice Cloud Palace were arrogant and rude and even belittled the Profound Sword Sect. As an elder of the Profound Sword Sect, he must teach them a lesson.\u201cSenior\u2026 Senior\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for my rudeness\u2026 It was my fault. I apologize to you.\u201d Yue Zhan cupped his fists at Xuan Yi and then bowed. He actually knelt down.Then, he stood up and turned to leave.The other cultivators of the Ice Cloud Palace followed him.\u201cDid I let you go?\u201d Xuan Yi demanded in a deep voice.Hearing this, the cultivators of the Ice Cloud Palace paused, their faces grim.Yue Zhan had no choice but turn around slowly, stammering, \u201cSenior\u2026 What we do for you?\u201d\u201cTell me about the Ice Emperor\u2019s inheritance that you mentioned earlier,\u201d Xuan Yi asked in a low voice.In the records that Xuan Yi had read in the sect\u2019s forbidden zone, Li Wendao mentioned the Ice Emperor\u2019s Inheritance, but the information about it was very little. Having heard the people of the Ice Cloud Palace talk about it, he got curious.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Yue Zhan was panicked. The Ice Emperor\u2019s inheritance was a big secret of the sect. How could he tell it to an outsider?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Chapter 34: Ice Emperor\u2019s InheritanceHearing that, Yue Zhan\u2019s breathing became heavier.\u201cAhem, senior\u2026 This matter concerns the life and death of the Ice Cloud Palace. I hope you can understand\u2026\u201d Yue Zhan stammered. Although his tone was weak, his eyes were firm.Eh?Xuan Yi\u2019s eyes turned sharp, as if a sword light flashed in them.\u201cDon\u2019t try my patience. If you don\u2019t tell me, you\u2019ll die!\u201d Xuan Yi\u2019s voice was indifferent, but in the ears of the Ice Cloud Palace cultivators, it was like a demon\u2019s whisper.The vast sword energy wrapped around Yue Zhan. With just a thought from Xuan Yi, Yue Zhan would be crushed into pieces.Yue Zhan was shocked by Xuan Yi\u2019s sword energy. His heart sank, and he wondered who on earth was this guy from the south domain\u2019s Profound Sword Sect.He now truly realized how powerful Xuan Yi was. He also discovered that the gap between their realms was as insurmountable as the Heavenly Abyss!If Xuan Yi was a cultivator slightly stronger than him, Yue Zhan would fight to death together with his companions.However, before this powerful cultivator, he didn\u2019t have a single thought to resist.Moreover, in the boundless sword energy that attacked him, he felt the breath of death that made even his soul tremble.He looked at the terrified disciples beside him and smiled bitterly in his heart. These disciples were the most talented people in the Ice Cloud Palace. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have participated in the Sage Mystic Realm this time.If they couldn\u2019t even protect themselves, how could protect the secret of the inheritance of the sect.He shook his head and smiled bitterly. \u201cSenior, maybe you don\u2019t know it, but a thousand years ago, the Ice Cloud Palace and the Profound Sword Sect had the same origin.\u201cSage Li and the founding patriarch of my sect had both visited an ancient holy land. Sage Li got the inheritance of sword cultivation, while the first Master of the Ice Cloud Palace, Leng Tianhan, understood a trace of the Ice Emperor\u2019s inheritance.\u201dJust a trace of the Ice Emperor\u2019s inheritance had created the Ice Cloud palace, one of the top 100 sects in the south domain, which showed how powerful the inheritance of the Ice Emperor was.Listening to him, Xuan Yi\u2019s brows gradually relaxed.According to his research in the forbidden area of the Profound Sword Sect, he knew Yue Zhan told the truth. It was just that the forbidden area only had information about the establishment of the Ice Cloud Palace and did not have the inheritance of the Ice Emperor.Thus, he asked, \u201cTell me everything you know about the Ice Emperor\u2019s inheritance. If you dare to lie to me, I\u2019ll kill all the cultivators from the Ice Cloud Palace in this place.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes. How dare I lie to you?\u201d Yue Zhan\u2019s face was pale and his mouth was dry. He said helplessly, \u201cBefore Palace Master Leng died, he knew that he couldn\u2019t absorb all of the trace of the Ice Emperor\u2019s inheritance, so he sealed it in the forbidden zone of the palace. He hoped that some outstanding disciples of the sect could inherit it and recreate the glory of the ancient emperor.\u201cHowever, the Ice Emperor\u2019s inheritance requires a strong bloodline to inherit it. That\u2019s why we wanted the Ice Spirit Fruit so much. Otherwise, if I knew that this item was what senior needed, I wouldn\u2019t have dared to covet it.\u201dXuan Yi frowned slightly, mulling over Yue Zhan\u2019s words.\u201cHumph! Do you think you can fool me?\u201dThe Ice Spirit Fruit could strengthen one\u2019s physique, but it couldn\u2019t remodeling it, nor could it activate the Ice Emperor\u2019s inheritance.If this thing was so good, then the Ice Cloud Palace wouldn\u2019t have waited for thousands of years to absorb the ice emperor\u2019s inheritance.\u201cNo, no. Everything I said is true.\u201d Sensing the sword energy around him became stronger, Yue Zhan hurriedly knelt down and said with a trembling voice, \u201cThis\u2026 The palace master once said that the holy son must take the Ice Spirit Fruit to have a chance of inheriting it.\u201dXuan Yi narrowed his eyes. His disciple Lin Yingxue was born with an ice physique, but in order to improve her qi and blood power, she had used countless medicinal baths. Only when she had a foundation could she use the Ice Spirit Fruit.With this in mind, Xuan Yi decided to make a trip to the Ice Cloud Palace after the expedition was over.At this moment, Song Qingxin tugged at his robe and pointed at a cultivator in the distance, saying, \u201cLook over there.\u201dXuan Yi looked over and found the spirit energy in that place was very dense. There was a kind of array formation that was gathering spirit energy!If his guess was right, Li Wandao\u2019s medicinal garden was nearby.This cave abode had been in concealment for a thousand years, so it was likely that there were many good items hidden in here. Nourished by such rich spirit energy, there might be some top grade spirit herbs.He nodded and engulfed Song Qingxin with his spirit energy. Then he flew over with her.As he flew, law symbols flickered around his body continuously.\u201cThose are\u2026! ! Law symbols\u2026 ! He\u2019s a master of the Law Enforcement Realm!\u201d\u201cHe has reached Law Enforcement Realm at such a young age. It\u2019s truly terrifying!\u201d\u2026Hearing the discussions of the sect disciples, Yue Zhan looked over and saw the law symbols around Xuan Yi flickering continuously. He was stunned.His eyes were wide open. Previously, he had already raised Xuan Yi\u2019s strength to a terrifying height in his heart, but he had still underestimated it.He felt depressed at first but then felt lucky.They were extremely lucky to be able to survive under the pressure of a Law Enforcement Realm cultivator. When they saw Xuan Yi heading towards the spirit herb zone, they didn\u2019t dare to follow him and decided to go out to try their luck.Song Qingxin, who was flying together with Xuan Yi, was also amazed.Her beautiful eyes were bright with amazement.Previously, when she was in the outer area, she had thought that Xuan Yi was a high level Golden Core cultivator. However, after he killed the Ice Crystal Black Python with a divine ability, she thought he was a Divine Power Realm cultivator. Now that he took her flying through the void and displayed the strength of the Law Enforcement Realm, she was dumbfounded.She swallowed with difficulty and asked, \u201cYou\u2026 What exactly is your realm?\u201d\u201cFifth level of the Law Enforcement Realm,\u201d Xuan Yi said lightly.Song Qingxin was so shocked that she did not dare to hold Xuan Yi\u2019s hand anymore.The fifth level of the Law Enforcement Realm was enough to make him an elder in a sect.Her amazement grew stronger. She had thought that even if Xuan Yi was in the Law Enforcement Realm, he should be at the first to third level of the realm. However, Xuan Yi\u2019s strength was actually at the fifth level, which was the middle level of the realm!He looked only a few years older than her, but his talent was so unbelievable. She had entered the Mid Land genius list after reaching the Golden Core Realm at 16. The so-called geniuses on the Tian Xuan Land would probably be ashamed of their inferiority when they faced Xuan Yi.They soon arrived at the spirit herb garden. The rich herbal fragrance made him happy, but then he frowned.He discovered that the suppression on his cultivation strength had grown stronger in this place, and he was now at the peak stage of the Divine Power Realm.It was obvious Li Wendao had put special attention on this place. The powerful restriction not only suppressed Xuan Yi\u2019s cultivation strength, but it also kept demon beasts from entering this zone which was thousands of miles wide.Xuan Yi sized up this place, and was incomparably amazed by Li Wendao\u2019s abilities.This spirit herb garden was incomparably vast. One couldn\u2019t see the end of it.The most important thing was that herbs with different and even contradictory attributes could grow together in here.Not only did they not counteract each other\u2019s medicinal effects, but they grew better due to the competitive atmosphere. Such a thing was against the laws of nature.Xuan Yi walked in the herb garden and studied the herbs, looking overjoyed.Fire Cloud Grass, Yin Essence Flower, Demon Cave Vine, Sky Spirit Fruit, Spirit Welcoming Flower, Xuan Green Vine, Purple Jade Gourd Tree, Heavenly Thunder Wood, Ice Frost Grass, Life Fruit\u2026Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Chapter 35: Chapter 35:These medicinal herbs were rarely seen in the outside world, but here they were growing like weeds. How could people not be envious?\u201cThis is fourth-grade Fire Cloud Grass, and it\u2019s more than 1,000 years old. Hahaha, with it, my cultivation technique will improve further.\u201d\u201cThird-grade Heavenly Thunder Wood! My God, am I dreaming? This is a good thing to cultivate the thunder technique.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 is simply a paradise filled with heavenly materials and earthly treasures. If I can get my hands on one spirit herb, no, even a weed, people outside would kill to get it.\u201d\u201cThis is mine. You can\u2019t snatch it from me, or I\u2019ll teach you a lesson!\u201d\u2026At first, many cultivators were desperately gathering spirit herbs. Then, they began to fight.Song Qingxin also had greed in her eyes. Even though she was the young mistress of the Mysterious Fire Pavilion in Mid Land and had spent some time in the Medicine God Valley, she had never seen so many precious herbs.\u201cThis is the Fire Cloud Grass!\u201d Song Qingxin was very happy. She cultivated fire-type technique, so she was familiar with fire-type herbs.\u201cDon\u2019t touch it!\u201d Xuan Yi said in a grave voice.One should never act rashly in an unfamiliar place, not to mention that this was the place where Sage Li had entered the Sage Realm. No one could take his things with ease.After hearing Xuan Yi\u2019s warning, Song Qingxin returned to his side and watched the others collect the spirit herbs with envious eyes.Xuan Yi had discovered the moment he arrived that this place was somewhat different from what was recorded in the sect\u2019s forbidden area.One had to know that Sage Li had set up a spirit gathering array here to guide the spirit energy mines underground into this herbal garden. However, Xuan Yi had just discovered that the spirit energy in this spirit mine had long been absorbed. How did these spirit herbs grow?This was also the reason why Xuan Yi stopped Song Qingxin from gathering the herbs.Xuan Yi frowned slightly. He discovered that the higher the grade of the herb, the more severely it was suppressed, just like the cultivators.Eh?Dragon Tiger Tyrant Flower!This was a saint-grade spirit herb above the ninth level. There was actually one here.One had to know that for cultivators who already had a spiritual body, especially those who cultivated bodies, this item could increase the level of their physique, turning them from an ordinary mortal body to a spiritual body, or even a saint body! For those who didn\u2019t cultivate their bodies, it could increase the probability of turning into a spiritual body.This kind of herb was extremely valuable even in ancient times.It was extremely difficult to find one such herb.And beside it, there was actually a black Illusion Heart Grass.This grass was an eighth-grade spirit herb. Although its grade wasn\u2019t as high as that of the Dragon Tiger Tyrant Flower, it was still very extraordinary.In particular, its mysterious effect could create illusions in people\u2019s minds. If it was refined, this item would become a top-grade pill that could help cultivators break through a major realm, overcoming the he inner demon that was created when one broke through to the next realm.However, strangely the luster of this Dragon Tiger Tyrant Flower was dim. It looked like it didn\u2019t have enough medicinal strength. It seemed to be inferior to the eighth-grade Illusion Heart Grass beside it.Although Xuan Yi was wary, he still wanted to take these two herbs since they were truly rare.\u201cAH, help!\u201d A man covered in blood shouted.\u201cWith your weak strength, you dare to fight with me over such precious herbs? Are you courting death?\u201d\u201cHahaha, they\u2019re all mine. I\u2019m rich.\u201d\u2026A large number of cultivators were fighting and killing each other. It was chaotic.They had been drawn to this place from separated spots in the Sage Secret Realm by an array formation. This method was extremely terrifying.Even the sect master of the Heaven Array Sect couldn\u2019t do it in a short time.Only a Sage Realm cultivator had this ability!It was very powerful.Xuan Yi didn\u2019t bother to warn them. After all, one had to obtain one\u2019s own opportunities and got ready to die after entering the mystic realm. Moreover, he didn\u2019t know these people and there was no reason for him to help them.At this moment, a man with bulging muscles and a black-clothed gloomy-looking man came to Xuan Yi\u2019s side. Their target was the Illusion Heart Grass.\u201cScram!\u201d The black-clothed man shouted angrily.With this explosive shout, the pressure of a third level of Divine Power Realm descended. The muscular man spat out a mouthful of blood, and his face was as pale as paper. Immediately, he turned around and left.Xuan Yi\u2019s expression did not change as he stood there.He looked at the black-robed man and said calmly, \u201cIf you don\u2019t scram within three seconds, you\u2019ll die.\u201d\u201cHMPH! You\u2019re brave, huh?\u201d The black-robed man did not want to damage the spirt herb with his spiritual energy fluctuation, so he didn\u2019t shout again.He did not think that Xuan Yi was his match. Besides, he had a powerful elder protecting him, which meant that no one could harm him.If Xuan Yi didn\u2019t retreat, he\u2019d kill him.He released the pressure of the third level of the Divine Power Realm. Immediately, everyone present was went quiet.\u201cMy God, that\u2019s the young master of the Yin Qi Sect of the south domain, Li Yin. I\u2019m surprised to see him here.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Although the Yin Qi sect is one of the top 100 sects of the south domain, Li Yin is a mysterious cultivator from the west domain. I heard that the Yin Qi Sect is a branch of the Yin Corpse Sect, the number one sect in the west domain. There\u2019s also a saying that these two sects are actually branches of a great ancient power which is extremely terrifying.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s really the case, then this young man is doomed.\u201d\u2026Everyone\u2019s gazes were fixed on the black-robed man. As for the white-robed young man, they didn\u2019t think much of him at all.\u201cWho do you think you are? How dare you threaten me so shamelessly? Do you know who I am?Boom!Before the black-robed man could react, a towering pressure instantly descended.This was Xuan Yi\u2019s aura. Even though his strength had been suppressed to the peak stage of the Divine Power Realm in this mystic realm, no one present was his match.If Li Yin\u2019s aura was like a lake, then the aura from the white-robed young man was like an ocean, incomparably vast.\u201cThis\u2026 this must be the peak stage of Divine Power Realm, very close to the Law Enforcement Realm.\u201d\u201cStrong, so strong. I didn\u2019t think that there would be such a powerful cultivator in this mystic realm.\u201d\u201cLi Yin is finished.\u201dEveryone was shocked, knowing that this aura was more than the Divine Power Realm.Moreover, they felt a strong killing intent in this vast pressure.Li Yin was so scared that he almost went his pants.However, he quickly made the right decision.He immediately crushed the Flee Jade Talisman in his hand.With a swoosh, he fled into the distance.But Xuan Yi wouldn\u2019t let him go. Streaks of astonishing sword energy appeared in the space and gradually gathered to form a huge sword!Boom!The huge sword smashed onto the ground and exploded with powerful spirit energy.Pu!Li Yin spat out a mouthful of blood. He had already been injured from burning his blood essence earlier. Now that he was injured by the spirit energy fluctuations, his injuries got even worse.\u201cElder, Elder, help me!\u201d Li Yin shouted.He fled frantically. His eyes were filled with panic and his entire body was dripping with blood. He looked extremely miserable.\u201cHMPH, you actually dared to touch my people. How do you want to die?\u201d A gray-clothed young man said with a frown.He looked to be no older than fifteen years, but his face was pale, and his eyes were filled with chaotic energy.Bang!\u201cOh? Your soul is at the Law Enforcement Realm? Yin Qi Sect actually used such a secret technique and has no regard for its disciples\u2019 lives,\u201d Xuan Yi saw through the cultivator\u2019s condition with a single glance and said with a cold smile.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Chapter 36: Spatial Spirit Seizing ArrayThe person did not care that he was seen through. He only laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that my soul is at the Law Enforcement Realm but my body can only release the power of the Divine Power Realm\u2026\u201dThe others were greatly shaken when they heard it.\u201cThis\u2026 He actually has a Law Enforcement Realm soul!\u201d\u201cHeavens, the people of the Yin Qi sect can actually use such a method to bring the soul of a powerful cultivator into the Sage Mystic Realm!\u201d\u201cHe used a secret technique to transfer his cultivation strength and soul into a young disciple\u2019s body before he entered this place. He deceived everyone and the restrictions of Sage Mystic Realm.\u201d\u201cWhat? There\u2019s such a secret technique? Then it\u2019s even stronger than possession?\u201d\u201cNo, if it\u2019s possession, although his cultivation can not be transferred over, his soul is actually fused with the host\u2019s physical body. And although this person has the strength of the Law Enforcement Realm, his soul is clearly unstable.\u201d\u201cYes, most importantly, since his soul is unstable, his physical body will easily be damaged. Once his physical body is damaged, his soul will also dissipate.\u201d\u201cI see. No wonder this person wanted to snatch this Illusion Heart Grass. He wants to stabilize his soul.\u201d\u201cSigh, although I don\u2019t want to say it, this white-clothed young man is in trouble. You know that the people of the Yin Corpse Sect are extremely arrogant and cruel. He offended them by attacking that guy so severely. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll be refined into an unconscious yin corpse.\u201dHearing these words, everyone shook their heads and thought Xuan Yi would end badly.Xuan Yi was not even the slightest bit worried.Although his strength was also suppressed to the Divine Power Realm, he was still stronger than other cultivators of the same realm!Furthermore, his opponent\u2019s strength was extremely weak. Once the host\u2019s physical body was destroyed and his soul had nowhere to hide, his physical body in the outside world would also be destroyed!Xuan Yi did not say a word, but his eyes turned cold, and killing intent could be seen within them.\u2026Meanwhile, the black-robed young man was charging toward Xuan Yi!\u201cBaleful Wind Palm!\u201dA wave of black killing aura condensed into a powerful hand in the air, and it crashed down toward Xuan Yi.However, faced with this overwhelming palm strike, Xuan Yi actually froze on the spot, not moving at all.The audience watched him, thinking he\u2019d be killed instantly.Xuan Yi raised his eyebrows and looked at the black-clothed youth.Before the people present could react, he waved his hands, and a streak of resplendent sword energy slashed towards the sky.The sword was like a dragon, heading straight for the black palm in the sky.Rumble!It wasn\u2019t as evenly matched as they had imagined. The sword energy penetrated the palm which melted like snow flakes falling into a pot of hot oil.No!So strong!This person was dangerous!This was the only thought in the black-clothed young man\u2019s mind.This person was not weaker than him. In fact, he was slightly stronger than him!He was so young and even stronger than him! His strength exceeded the first level of the Law Enforcement Realm?How was it possible! ! !\u201cCould it be that there\u2019s another soul in your body?\u201d The black-clothed young man looked aghast.When Song Qingxin heard this, her beautiful eyes stared at Xuan Yi. She was also doubtful that a cultivator in his early twenties could reach the Law Enforcement Realm!Since when had such a monster appeared in the south domain?However, Xuan Yi ignored the black-robed young man\u2019s question.He slashed out with his sword!The spirit energy was extremely pure and extremely terrifying.The black-robed young man could feel death beckoning at him from within this vast sword energy.This meant that this sword attack was able to kill him.Facing such a sword cultivator, he only wanted to run!However, how could Xuan Yi let him go? The vast sword energy was like a force of nature, directly sealing off the black-robed young man\u2019s path of retreat.The black-clothed youth watched in a daze as the terrifying sword energy slashed towards him.That palm strike was already his strongest attack.He had defeated countless masters of the same level with this palm technique.He had thought that once he launched this technique, it would at least injure him if not kill him.Now, it seemed that he had overestimated himself and underestimated Xuan Yi.The sword energy engulfed the black-clothed young man and slashed towards the boundary of the barrier before it slowly dissipated.At the same time, the black-clothed young man from the Yin Corpse Sect also dissipated.Gulp\u2026All the cultivators present swallowed at the same time.Although the cultivation strength of the cultivator\u2019s first level Law Enforcement Realm was suppressed due to the restriction of his physical body, he was still a powerful Law Enforcement Realm cultivator!But he had been killed by a sword slash instantly.How shocking it was!\u201cDon\u2019t kill me, don\u2019t kill me please\u2026\u201d Li Yin, who was still in the ground, was scared silly. He was buried in the ground, and his greatest protector had been killed. How could he not be afraid?Just when everyone thought that Xuan Yi would kill him with a single sword strike, something strange happened.They found Li Yin\u2019s body was actually covered with spirit herbs which he had picked from the spirit herb garden.Crack! Crack! Crack!The sounds of the formation being activated came from the space.\u201cThis is the Spirit Seizing Array!\u201d Xuan Yi said in astonishment.\u201cSpirit Seizing Array? What does it mean?\u201d Song Qingxin asked.\u201cIt is a very weird formation. Once the formation is activated, it will forcibly seize the pure spirit from the human body. It is an extremely aggressive formation.\u201dXuan Yi had read this information in the forbidden zone of the sect. However, he did not know where Sage Li had set it up. It turned out the array was here.\u201cAh, why is there a spirit herb growing on my hand?!\u201d\u201cAh, I can\u2019t see.\u201d A blood-colored spirit herb suddenly appeared in the eye socket of a gray-clothed man.\u201cNo, this damned place. I want to leave here. It\u2019s too scary.\u201d\u201cNo! The spirit herb garden has already closed,\u201d a cultivator shouted.The thousands of disciples inside the cave were in a chaos.Spirit energy flowed from their bodies and entered the spirit herbs growing on their bodies, feeding the spirit herbs.The cultivators who had become the herb nutrient were those who had collected the spirit herbs.Seeing this, Song Qing was alarmed. She would have collected some spirit herbs if Xuan Yi hadn\u2019t stopped her. If she did, she\u2019d be like those cultivators and become nutrient for the spirit herbs.At this thought, she admired Xuan Yi even more.However, at this moment, Xuan Yi was alarmed.Once the Spirit Seizing Array was activated, it wouldn\u2019t stop until it refined all the people in this place. Only then would the restriction on this herbal garden be removed.In other words, everyone would die here.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Chapter 37: Bai Weiwei Is in DangerFortunately, Xuan Yi had prepared for this situation and had a countermeasure in mind. He immediately began to break the array.\u201cOh no, the Spirit Seizing Array set up by Sage Li is not an ordinary array. Although the array has lost most of its spirituality with the passage of time, it is not something that can be broken in a short period of time. Moreover, if we don\u2019t know where the array eye is, it is impossible to break it.\u201dAlarmed, Xuan Yi immediately observed the herbs in the garden.Under the nourishment of the spiritual energy from thousands of cultivators, these spirit herbs began to flourish.Although the herbs in the garden were exuding a charming luster, everyone felt chilled inside.The most dazzling one was the Dragon Tiger Tyrant Flower. It was as if all the other flowers were feeding it.Xuan Yi naturally noticed it and thought this flower must be the eye of the Spirit Seizing Array.If he refined this flower, the array would be broken.Xuan Yi calmed his mind and began to refine it.\u2026On a meadow in the outer range of the Saint Mystic Ream.This was the gathering place of the people of the Black Sword Sect.\u201cJunior sister Bai, Elder Xuan has been away for a long time. I wonder if something happened to him,\u201d a disciple asked.\u201cImpossible. Master is very powerful. How could anything happen to him?\u201d A white-robed woman who had been pacing back and forth stopped in her tracks and frowned.\u201cJunior sister Bai, this is the Sage Mystic Realm. It was set up by Li Wendao, the founder of the Profound Sword Sect. No sect leader in the south domain would dare to act recklessly in such a dangerous place,\u201d Murong Tian said coolly.\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense. Elder Xuan knows what\u2019s he\u2019s doing. Murong Tian, don\u2019t sound false alarm,\u201d Xia Han said seriously.\u201cHumph! In mystic realms, the more powerful one is, the more likely one\u2019d explore dangerous places. Many of them died like this.\u201d Murong Tian raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cIf we explore the outer area properly, we might have a good harvest.\u201dDuring this period of time, many cultivators from other sects had obtained good stuff in this area, such as spirit herbs and rare treasures. Of course, there were also killings and looting.However, Xuan Yi had ordered them to stay where they were.In the Saint Mystic Realm, there were many opportunities, treasures, and even the inheritance of the saint.The Sage Mystic Realm would be open for only a month. During this month, all the cultivators who came here were frantically searching for treasures. No one cultivated here, and no one stayed put.However, because of Xuan Yi\u2019s order, they stayed put for five days.Naturally, they were dissatisfied with him.When Bai Weiwei heard their words, even though she was very confident in Xuan Yi\u2019s strength, she was still worried.This was because the Sage Mystic Realm was very weird. Under the shroud of this dense fog, five of the nine disciples of the Profound Sword Sect had started to show signs of suppression. They did not dare to walk around freely.In this outer area, naturally, the weaker the cultivator, the stronger the suppression.\u201cI don\u2019t care. I want to go and find treasures. If I don\u2019t go now, this mystic realm will be emptied out by other cultivators.\u201d Murong Tian stood up.As soon as he said this, some other disciples immediately agreed.\u201cSenior brother Murong, I\u2019m going too.\u201d Two disciples at the first level of Golden Core Realm quickly agreed.Xia Hanning was tempted, but her cultivation strength of the third level of the Golden Core Realm was suppressed to the first level of the Golden Core Realm. She felt wary of this place and didn\u2019t dare to act recklessly.\u201cAre you really going to leave?\u201d Bai Weiwei asked with a slight frown. If they went their different ways, it would be very difficult to gather together.\u201cHumph! Don\u2019t come with us if you\u2019re afraid. Just wait here for your master.\u201dHe had not forgotten Bai Weiwei had crippled his younger brother. How could he have a good impression of her? After saying that, he turned around and left.Three other disciples went with him.Boom! !A powerful spirit energy fluctuation spread over. This was the sound of an explosion caused by a battle between cultivators.\u201cHahaha, I didn\u2019t expect to meet guys from the Profound Sword Sect here. It\u2019s fate,\u201d a man said indifferently.A pair of emerald-green vertical pupils appeared in the smoke. It was actually a giant snake at the first level of the Divine Power Realm. This man\u2019s body was covered by wounds. It was obvious that he had experienced a great battle. However, he stood on the head of the green python in high spirits.\u201cLiu Mo, if you don\u2019t want to die, then get out of the way. I saw them first,\u201d a woman with a pale face said indifferently with an unquestionable tone.\u201cHehe, He Huanyuan, don\u2019t think that I\u2019m afraid of you just because you\u2019re at the first level of Divine Power Realm. Aren\u2019t you afraid of being buried in the snake\u2019s belly?\u201d Although Liu Mo\u2019s cultivation strength was suppressed to the ninth level of the Golden Core Realm, he was still arrogant.\u201cYour strength only relies on a beast. How dare you be so arrogant in front of me? Don\u2019t tell me you want to be destroyed by my killing array?\u201d He Huanyuan\u2019s body released golden light, and her aura was menacing.At this moment, Murong Tian and the other two were trapped in an array which emitted shining golden lights. Immobilized, they were scared silly by the huge green python that was fifteen meters long.\u201cAh, so you are friends from the Heaven Array Sect and the Myriad Beast Sect. I am the Profound Sword Sect\u2019s genius Murong Tian. Is there some misunderstanding between us?\u201d Murong Tian smiled apologetically.\u201cMisunderstanding?\u201d Liu Mo\u2019s eyes were filled with disdain as he said, \u201cWith your strength, do you think you are worthy of making me misunderstand?\u201d\u201cHMPH, I was looking for people from Profound Sword Sect. I didn\u2019t expect that you guys would deliver yourselves to my door. It saves me lots of efforts,\u201d He Huanyuan said indifferently.\u201cAH? Seniors, I wonder why you are looking for me. If I can help, I will go through fire and water for you. I will do anything!\u201d Murong Tian patted his chest and promised. He didn\u2019t dare to anger them, afraid they\u2019d kill him immediately.\u201cHahaha, this is indeed a genius from the Profound Sword Sect. My big snake likes geniuses like you.\u201d Liu Mo laughed loudly.\u201cDon\u2019t, I will do anything for you, seniors.\u201d Murong Tian\u2019s body trembled as he hurriedly knelt down.\u201cLet me ask you a question. If you dare to lie, I will directly activate the killing formation and turn you into ashes,\u201d He Huanyuan said coldly.\u201cSenior, I will tell you everything I know,\u201d Murong Tian said in fear.\u201cThe Sag Mystic Realm was created by the founder of your Profound Sword Sect, Li Wendao. You should know a lot about this place, right?\u201d Liu Mo asked.\u201cI know little\u2026\u201d Murong Tian quickly nodded.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thus, he immediately said, \u201cYes, there is. The sect has a map of this mystic realm.\u201dAt this moment, the other disciples hurriedly stopped him and said, \u201cSenior brother Murong, this important matter concerns the fate of our sect. Be careful with your you say!\u201d One of the sword sect disciples said.\u201cYes, these people from the top 100 sects of the south domain not only forget their roots, but now they actually dare to covet our sect\u2019s legacy. We must not tell them,\u201d another loyal disciple said.\u201cThis matter concerns the life and death of the sect. We can\u2019t divulge any secrets!\u201dThese three disciples didn\u2019t know if Murong Tian knew about this secret or not. However, under the current circumstances, they would rather think that he did.Seeing the three people\u2019s expressions, Liu Mo and the other two began to believe Murong Tian\u2019s claim despite their doubts.\u201cAh! !\u201dThe huge green python swallowed the three disciples.This was naturally Liu Mo\u2019s handiwork.\u201cWhere is the map?\u201d He Huanyuan and Liu Mo asked in unison.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Murong Tian\u2019s head was covered in sweat. He was extremely scared.These two people were like demon cultivators. If his answer didn\u2019t satisfy them, he\u2019d also be swallowed by the huge snake.He turned his eyes and seemed to have thought of something. He quickly said, \u201cSeniors, I know who has the map.\u201d\u201cWho has it?\u201d\u201cTell us now!\u201d\u201cXuan Yi!\u201d Murong Tian said calmly.\u201cWhat! Xuan Yi is actually here?\u201d Shock and fear appeared in He Huanyuan and Liu Mo\u2019s eyes.\u201cAre you trying to trick me? Do you think that just because you mentioned the name of a sect elder, I will not dare to kill you?\u201d Liu Mo shouted and the green python behind him stuck out its tongue.He Huanyuan also had a murderous look on her face.\u201cNo, seniors, you\u2019ve misunderstood. Xuan Yi went to explore the mystic realm alone after entering. He didn\u2019t allow the disciples of the sect to move around. There must be something that he didn\u2019t want others to know. Xuan Yi must have a map. He might be exploring the mystic realm right now.\u201d\u201cGet to the point! ! !\u201dLiu Mo looked at him with an unfriendly look, but he believed his words.They knew that Xuan Yi was an elder of the Profound Sword Sect, so they believed Murong Tian\u2019s claim that Xuan Yi had come to the mystic realm with a map.After all, these disciples of the Profound Sword Sect were so weak and their sect master Qing Xuzi wouldn\u2019t let them come here to take the risk all by themselves.\u201cXuan Yi\u2019s absence means that he has a secret, but his personal disciple, Bai Weiwei, is here. She must know something. I know where she is now. I will bring you over, and we can\u2026\u201dMurong Tian did not continue, but his meaning very clear. He wanted to get rid of her.Liu Mo and he Huan Yuan looked at each other and said slowly, \u201cFine. If that\u2019s the case, then we can explore the trial tower.\u201d\u201cBring Bai Weiwei over and let her enter the trial tower. As the personal disciple of an elder, she must know something. Even if she doesn\u2019t, she can help us avoid some dangers.\u201dHe Huanyuan and Liu Mo\u2019s faces were disheveled because they had encountered a trial tower.This trial tower was the mysterious trial ground of the Sage Mystic Realm. Not only did it contain supreme cultivation techniques, there were also many mechanisms. They had tried many times and could not break the restrictions of the mystic realm, let alone obtain the cultivation techniques inside. They might even die in there.Now that they had an opportunity to change this situation, they were happy to do it.As long as they could pass the trial tower, they would be able to obtain Sage Li\u2019s supreme techniques!\u201cThen hurry up and lead the way!\u201d Liu Mo shouted.\u201cYes, yes, yes. I will lead the way\u2026\u201d Murong Tian quickly got up.The three of them headed in the direction of Bai Weiwei.At this moment, Bai Weiwei was still worried about Xuan Yi\u2019s safety.Rumble!A powerful sound came from the ground.Bai Weiwei and the others were alarmed.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Xia Hanning stood up. As the eldest disciple of this operation, her first priority was to protect the other disciples.\u201cWho\u2019s Bai Weiwei?\u201d He Huanyuan shouted.The disciples saw the two disheveled people but didn\u2019t not dare to answer because they could not sense the new comers\u2019 cultivation levels. The only explanation was that the new comers\u2019 cultivation levels were higher than their own.Seeing He Huanyuan and Liu Mo\u2019s attires, Xia Hanning frowned and said, \u201cYou guys are from the Heaven Array Sect and the Myriad Beast Sect.\u201dHearing her words, He Huanyuan attacked Xia Haning with a trapping formation and subdued her.\u201cLooks like you\u2019re Bai Weiwei. Come with me obediently, or else I\u2019ll make you suffer,\u201d He Huanyuan threatened.\u201cLet go of senior sister Xia!\u201d The other three inner disciples shouted.\u201cBe quiet!\u201d Liu Mo said disdainfully. He formed a spell with both hands and summoned the green python to attack. With a sweep of his tail, the snake sent the three people flying.The three inner disciples flew backwards and spat out blood.\u201cWrong, she\u2019s not Bai Weiwei. That woman is!\u201d Murong Tian poked his head out from behind and pointed at the young girl on the side.Huh?He Huanyuan glanced at Xia Hanning before throwing her away like a piece of trash.Bang!Xia Hanning fell heavily to the ground and spat out blood.\u201cSenior sister!\u201d Bai Weiwei stepped forward to help her up.Although the two of them had competed in the underground palace, they were fellow disciples now that they were outside of the sect.She could not just stand by and watch.\u201cI\u2019m okay\u2026 They are very powerful! I\u2019m afraid we are no match for them!\u201d Xia Hanning\u2019s aura was weak as she said cautiously.\u201cTheir eyes are good despite their weak cultivation strength\u2026\u201dThe woman laughed coldly.Then, she exploded. Golden light emitted from her body, and extremely mysterious inscriptions came out from her body as she rushed towards Bai Weiwei.She intended to subdue Bai Weiwei immediately.\u201cHMPH!

Then, it condensed into a void hand which attacked the golden inscriptions in all directions.Divine ability!\u201cWhat! ! ! !\u201d He Huanyuan\u2019s expression changed.A Golden Core Realm cultivator was actually performing a divine ability!And judging from the great force of the attack, it was a very powerful one!How was that possible?Boom!The starlight hand collided with the golden inscriptions, causing a huge spirit energy explosion.Because Bai Weiwei was one big realm lower than her opponent, she found it difficult to block the attack even with the imperial-level divine ability.After all, the power of a divine ability depended on the user\u2019s cultivation realm.Bai Weiwei was shaken by the air waves and retreated ten steps, panting.He Huanyuan was full of disbelief. As a Divine Power Realm cultivator, she had launched her most powerful move but failed to defeat the opponent. This was unbelievable.Xia Hanning was also full of disbelief.Bai Weiwei could actually compete with He Huanyuan?She was a Divine Power Realm cultivator!At this time, Liu Mo laughed disdainfully and said, \u201cHahaha, he Huanyuan, you can\u2019t even instant-kill a first level Golden Core Realm cultivator. You really embarrassed your sect. It\u2019s still up to my Myriad Beast Sect. Let me do it!\u201d\u201cHumph! Although I didn\u2019t kill her, I weakened her!\u201d He Huanyuan said coldly.Liu Mo flew up, and the green python under his feet emitted an aura of the first level of the Divine Power Realm. Combined with his own strength of the ninth level of the Golden Core Realm, he could fight a cultivator of the second level of the Divine Power Realm.The green python swept its powerful tail toward Bai Weiwei.This green python was tamed by a great elder of the sect, and its strength was extremely powerful!Even though Bai Weiwei used the Supreme Yin Scripture and the Star Picking Technique in her spirit energy, she was still no match for her opponent.Pu!A large mouthful of blood spurted out, and Bai Weiwei flew backward like a kite with its string cut.She was heavily injured now, and her face was as white as a sheet of paper, but she still struggled up.She muttered to herself weakly, \u201cHis realm is too high for me\u2026 I lost lots of spirit energy when I fought with He Huanyuan.\u201cBut\u2026 he\u2019s no better than me!\u201dBai Weiwei stared coldly at the genius disciples of the two sects in front of her, and she looked determined.\u201cThis girl\u2019s strength is quite strong\u2026 we must be careful!\u201d He Huanyuan and Liu Mo looked grim as they began to take her seriously.\u201cDon\u2019t hold back. Bring her into the trial tower as soon as possible. Then, we\u2019ll work separately!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dAs the two of them conversed, they decided to use their full strength.\u2026At the same time.In the spirit herb garden of the Sage Mystic Realm.A white-clothed young man was concentrating on refining a spirit herb that was about to break through to the saint grade. Beside him, a red-haired girl was looking at him with worry in her eyes.They were Xuan Yi and Song Qingxin.Unlike them, the cultivators around them were in a state that was worse than death.\u201cOhhh\u2026\u201d\u201cHelp\u2026help\u2026me.\u201d\u201cWho can stab me with a sword? Please kill me.\u201d\u201cMy blood essence\u2026 my cultivation\u2026 I can\u2019t accept this\u2026\u201d\u2026Thousands of cultivators wailed in low voices. They had lost their mind.Their bodies were covered in spirit herbs, and their vitality and cultivation strength had been completely sucked dry by the spirit herbs. If not for their clothes left on the ground, no one would have they had been here.\u201cWill I also become the food for the spirit herbs like these cultivators?\u201dSong Qingxin paced back and forth beside Xuan Yi, panicking.Would she die here? She had yet to find a powerful sword cultivator master.Thinking of this, she stopped and glanced at Xuan Yi.Now, she could only rely on him and didn\u2019t dare to do anything to disturb him.Song Qingxin realized that the spirit energy in her body was gradually dissipating, but she didn\u2019t dare to say anything to distract Xuan Yi.Xuan Yi increased the speed of the spell forming with his hands, intending to refine the Dragon Tiger Tyrant Flower quickly. But strangely, the faster he tried, the more difficult it was to control the spirit herb.\u201cEh? Could it be\u2026\u201dXuan Yi looked at the Illusion Heart Grass beside the Dragon Tiger Tyrant Flower in puzzlement.The Illusion Heart Grass was constantly emitting an undetectable spirit energy fluctuation, distracting cultivators\u2019 mind.It brought strong emotions to people. The more emotional one got, the more aggressive the Dragon Tiger Tyrant Flower was, and the more powerful the Spirit Seizing Array was.No wonder he had felt the drawing power of a mysterious mind-deceiving force when he entered the cave abode .The key to breaking the array was the Dragon Tiger Tyrant Flower. It was the core of the array, but if he could not get rid of the Illusion Heart Grass next to it, then the array could only be stopped after all the cultivators present were refined.Sage Li\u2019s handiwork was indeed powerful. Even though he had read the records in the sect, he almost fell for it.However, although Li Wendao\u2019s methods were excellent and his thoughts were meticulous, there was still a defect in the array.After all, Xuan Yi had Song Qingxin with him. If she refined the Illusion Heart Grass while he refined the Dragon Tiger Tyrant Flower, then the Spirit Seizing Array would be broken.After figuring out what to do, Xuan Yi immediately carried it out.\u201cDisrobe,\u201d Xuan Yi said to Song Qingxin in a low voice.\u201cAh?\u201dSong Qingxin was confused, but she still obediently went up to Xuan Yi and proceeded to help him take off his clothes.\u201cI meant, disrobe yourself,\u201d Xuan Yi hurriedly said.HMM?When Song Qingxin heard Xuan Yi\u2019s words, her beautiful eyes widened, full of disbelief.What shameless words did he say? How could he ask her to do such a thing in such a situation?Could it be that he felt that he couldn\u2019t leave this place alive and wanted to do it with her at the last moment of his life\u2026Song Qingxin\u2019s face was flushed red as if she had applied a layer of rouge.She recalled the intimate moment with Xuan Yi and the feeling of his strong arms around her.Although Xuan Yi did not know what the girl was thinking about, he saw from her gaze that she had misunderstood him. So he shook his head and said, \u201cCough, you need to disrobe to refine this spirit grass. If you can refine it, not only can we leave this place, but you can also dissolve the aphrodisiac pill in your body and even develop you own divine ability.\u201d\u201cWhy should I disrobe? Can\u2019t I do it with my clothes on?\u201d Song Qingxin\u2019s face was red.\u201cYour clothes are spirit garment, right? They have spirit energy fluctuations. If you don\u2019t want to suffer any accidents during the refinement process, you can leave them on.\u201d Xuan Yi glanced at her.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026 Alright then.\u201dSong Qingxin bit her lower lip and agreed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: FallChapter 40: FallHowever, her bright eyes quickly dimmed.Although she knew that there was a chance of obtaining a divine ability, she was still a little disappointed that she couldn\u2019t feel the familiar warmth of his body.\u201cLater, I will disintegrate the grass and inject it into your body. At that time, you will enter an illusionary world. If you can break this illusion, we will be able to leave this place. If not, our fate will be no different from those cultivators.\u201cThe reason why I want you to disrobe is that I don\u2019t want you to be hindered by anything. The robe that I gave you is a spirit garment. It contains a huge amount of spirit energy. When you enter the illusionary world, you might lose control. It is for the sake of safety.\u201dSong Qingxin was surprised. The robe that Xuan Yi gave her was a powerful spirit device?What was wrong with this guy?Did he treat spiritual devices as cheap cabbages?Although she was the young mistress of the Mystic Fire Pavilion in the Mid Land, she would not be so generous.Song Qingxin felt that Xuan Yi was someone she could rely on, so she nodded firmly.\u201cYes! ! !\u201dHua\u2026Song Qingxin waved her small hand, and the robe that belonged to Xuan Yi floated off her body. Her exquisite figure was once again displayed in front of Xuan Yi.Her flushed face was extremely delicate, and her watery eyes were very lively. Her beautiful shoulder-length black hair was emitting a refreshing fragrance.On her delicate chest, her breasts which Xuan Yi had touched accidently stood proudly.Her slender and beautiful legs were soft and smooth.Although she was still young, she was already a stunning beauty.Fortunately, there was no one else here.All the other cultivators had died in the herbal garden. Other than her and Xuan Yi, there was no one else.Therefore, Song Qingxin was not very shy.In any case, Xuan Yi had already seen her body, so it was not a big deal to let him see her again\u2026Under Xuan Yi\u2019s guidance, a pure medicinal energy entered Song Qingxin\u2019s body.\u201cWu\u2026\u201dThe young girl closed her eyes and moaned lightly.This moan, under the effects of the Illusion Heart Grass, was mesmerizing, heating Xuan Yi\u2019s blood.It was obvious that Song Qingxin had entered a chance at this moment, arriving in the world that she yearned for the most in her heart.Wu!Entranced, Song Qingxin moved to Xuan Yi\u2019s side and kissed his lips and then threw herself into his embrace.Her eyelashes fluttered and a faint pink appeared in her cheeks\u2026Xuan Yi\u2019s breathing stopped for a second and then became extremely heavy.Their previous embrace was the result of the aphrodisiac pill and Song Qingxin had been a little frantic with her moves. However, this time, she had the unique charm of a young girl and revealed her deep attachment to Xuan Yi.\u201cNot good, this is an illusion created by the Illusion Heart Grass\u2026\u201dThe two tongues intertwined tightly together, and the effects of the Illusion Heart Grass was actually transferred from Song Qingxin\u2019s body into Xuan Yi\u2019s.Under the effects of the Illusion Heart Grass, Xuan Yi lost his mind instantly.Xuan Yi felt that his blood was boiling, and he forgot everything except the girl in his arms. Suddenly, he moved forward and kissed her cheeks, lips, and neck with force, and his hands caressed her delicate and smooth body frantically\u2026Song Qingxin\u2019s eyes were hazy like water, and she panted softly. Her breath was like the orchid fragrance, and her skin was as soft as snow. Her body trembled lightly, and she didn\u2019t resist his caresses. Instead, she closed her eyes and frowned slightly, like a blooming rose. Her delicate and smooth legs also shook involuntarily, as if telling the man beside her that she was ready to fly to the unknown world with him.This sensual sight made Xuan Yi\u2019s heart burn even more.Beep! !At this moment, a sound came in Xuan Yi\u2019s mind.\u201cOh no, Weiwei\u2019s in danger!\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s mind instantly cleared up, and the flames in his body were suppressed.The sound just now was the imprint he had left in Bai Weiwei\u2019s body.This imprint would only be activated when she was in danger.And now, not only was it activated, but it sounded very urgent. It meant that Weiwei was in great danger.As her master, he couldn\u2019t allow himself to indulge in physical desire while his disciple was in danger.Xuan Yi got up and put Song Qingxin to the side.She was in an illusion now. While she was trying to break out of it, he should take the time to break the Spirit Seizing Array.He immediately calmed down and attacked the array.Crack, crack, crack!Half an hour later, Xuan Yi\u2019s eyes shone brightly.The array in the herbal garden was finally opened.However, at this time, no cultivator showed the ecstasy of surviving a disaster because, other than Xuan Yi and Song Qingxin, all the cultivators in the garden had turned into the spirit herbs\u2019 food.He glanced at the precious herbs that made countless people envious, and a chill welled up in his heart.If it weren\u2019t for Song Qingxin, it would be hard to say if he could leave this place.As to these spiritual herbs, Xuan Yi naturally wouldn\u2019t leave without them.With a wave of his hand, a white spiritual light enveloped each spiritual herb and stored them in his storage ring.As to the most precious saint-grade Dragon Tiger Tyrant Flower, he stored it in a jade box.After he had collected all the spirit herbs in the Sage Mystical Realm, a dark path appeared in front of him.This was the path leading to the outside.Xuan Yi probed it slightly.Overjoyed, he bundled the unconscious Song Qingxin with his robe and stepped onto the path with her in his arms.Song Qingxin was still in the illusionary world. Her body was emotionless, her spirit mind was trying to break out from the illusion.She was on her own now. He would find a way to help her when he had time.The most important thing now was Bai Weiwei\u2019s safety.The imprint left in her body had been activated for some time, which meant that Bai Weiwei had been in danger for some time.He\u2019d kill anyone who dared to mess with his disciple!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Trial TowerChapter 41: Trial TowerThe trial tower was located at the very center of the mystic realm. Bai Weiwei and the others were brought to the trial tower.Everyone felt a powerful pressure coming from the sky. Even the air gave them a suffocating feeling. This was the most terrifying part of the Saint Mystic Realm. Some felt weak in the knees under the pressure.Bai Weiwei looked up and saw a magnificent ancient tower. On the top of the tower were two majestic words\u2013Trial Tower. Her breathing quickened and she could not help but feel worried. In such a dangerous place, people from the Profound Sword Sect would definitely be thrown in to explore. If that happened, their situation would be even worse. As she thought about it, she looked around, hoping desperately for the arrival of her master, but she knew her master\u2019s situation was probably also very dangerous and he couldn\u2019t come to the trial tower to help them.He Huanyuan panted heavily, her high chest heaving up and down. \u201cIs this the mysterious trial tower in the mystic realm? The suppression is so powerful that there must be great treasures inside!\u201d\u201cOf course, according to legends, this is a mystic realm with an imperial-level inheritance.\u201dThe trial tower was the most mysterious place in the mystic realm. It was said that before Li Wendao established the Saint Mystic Realm, this trial tower had already existed. It was as old as the few sect master realm cultivators in the continent.There was also a rumor that this place hadn\u2019t had a name until Li Wendao named it Trial Tower when he established the Saint Mystic Realm. The price he paid was that his dao heart was damaged. Of course, all of this was just a rumor. Only an existence like Li Wendao could find out its real origin.\u201cImperial level inheritance! It\u2019s something that only exists in legends!\u201dEveryone present was stunned when they heard about the imperial level inheritance.What kind of existence was that? If a mortal obtained an imperial level inheritance, he or she would be more powerful than most geniuses.It was rumored that whoever could past the tests in the trial tower would obtain the imperial level inheritance. However, no one present believed it. They had only read about such inheritances in ancient books. In reality, they had never seen or even heard of them.Of course, even if there was no such inheritance in the trial tower, they could still get great treasures if they could pass the tests in the tower. The treasures were holy items that people would kill for.They would risk their lives to get such hotly items.However, in the face of this pressure, their hearts sank. Even the pressure at the entrance of the trial tower was so great; how great it would be inside the tower?\u201cLook at the stone tablet!\u201dOn this stone tablet they saw the name of Lin Jian, the genius they were familiar with!Upon seeing this name, everyone was stunned. Lin Jian was an extremely talented sword cultivator. He had entered the Dao through slaughter, and whenever he drew his sword, someone would die. More than ten years ago, he had challenged and killed countless geniuses in the South Domain. No one knew his actual strength, but many faint-hearted cultivators would be scared out of their wits at the mention of his name.Other than Lin Jian, there were many other names on the stone tablet. All of them were terrifying geniuses. Looking at these familiar names, Liu Mo\u2019s expression changed slightly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be easy to break their records and put our own names on it.\u201dHe Huanyuan laughed mockingly. \u201cYou want to put your own name on it?\u201dLiu Mo had gradually got used to this pressure. Bai Weiwei did, too. Severely injured, she could only allow herself to be dragged to the trial tower. Looking at the stone tablet in front of her, she felt despaired.\u201cYou people from the Profound Sword Sect lead the way.\u201d Although they had already learned a lot about the trial tower from the ancient books, Liu Mo and He Huanyuan were happy to have other people lead the way.Bai Weiwei\u2019s face was pale.On the first level of the trial tower, their cultivation strength was suppressed to the Foundation Establishment Realm. There were all kinds of dangers in the tower; if she wasn\u2019t careful, she might die on the first level.After the group of people from the Profound Sword Sect entered the tower, Bai Weiwei spat out a mouthful of blood. Because she was already injured and her cultivation level was suppressed, she was unable to withstand the pressure. The others didn\u2019t fare any better. Murong Tian smirked behind her and winked at He Huanyuan. His meaning was very obvious, hoping to seduce this genius from the Sky Array Sect with his good looks. Their senior sister Xia saw this and felt disgusted. If he were Elder Xuan, He Huanyuan would be attracted by him. However, Murong Tian\u2019s looks were not good enough to charm her.\u201cYou guys walk before us. Remember not to play any tricks!\u201d Liu Mo said fiercely. Although everyone here was in the foundation Establishment Realm, the people from the Profound Sword Sect were weak in strength and their senior sister was severely injured, so they did not have any strength to fight back. If they disobeyed Liu Mo, they would be fed to the beasts!Bai Weiwei felt humiliated, but she resolutely walked before the others. As Xuan Yi\u2019s disciple, she didn\u2019t want to act like a coward and tarnish her master\u2019s reputation.\u201cSenior sister!\u201dIn the dark and creepy tunnel, several streaks of fierce sword energy suddenly shot toward themBai Weiwei was shocked, but she was severely injured and had no strength to dodge. Her eyes widened slightly, and her pupils contracted drastically.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: : Breaking InChapter 42: Breaking InAfter walking out of the passage, Xuan Yi came to the trial tower without stopping. There was a dark red flowing in front of the stone tablet, mixed with soil. It was a shocking sight.Song Qingxin\u2019s entire body went soft as she felt her body being wrapped up. A wave of warmth came from a pair of large hands, and she unconsciously flushed red. Her body twisted a few times uncontrollably, and her face became redder and redder. In the illusion, she only felt the heat.At this moment, she did not know the urgency Xuan Yi felt inside him. The aura from this pool of blood came from Bai Weiwei. Bai Weiwei was still alive, but she was severely injured!If they did not hurry, Bai Weiwei\u2019s life would not be guaranteed. This was a disciple that he had taken in with great difficulty. Moreover, after spending some time together, it would be a lie to say that they did not have a master-disciple relationship.The aura coming from the trial tower indicated that Bai Weiwei was inside the tower.Feeling the twisting of his body, Xuan Yi stopped his steps and looked down. Song Qingxin was constantly twisting her body.\u201cWhat did she experience in the illusion?\u201dHe shook his head with a bitter smile and stepped into the trial tower. In an instant, he felt that his cultivation had suddenly dropped and barely stopped until he reached the third level of the foundation phase.Xuan Yi had heard a little about this trial tower. It was rumored that it was extremely dangerous to enter it with a slim chance of survival. However, if one could kill their way out of it, they would also receive a very generous reward, the genius named Lin Jian on the stone tablet was a sword cultivator whose strength had improved a lot after leaving this place. He had also created a powerful cultivation technique of the gate-killing sword.At this moment, Song Qingxin opened her eyes slightly.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why am I at my foundation!\u201d She was shocked. Cultivation was what cultivators cared about the most. How could she not be surprised.\u201cThis is the trial tower. Our cultivation will be suppressed to the our foundation.\u201d\u201cI see. The trial tower is the final forbidden area of the saint\u2019s Secret Realm. It\u2019s extremely dangerous. It\u2019s not too late for us to go out and make preparations before coming in.\u201dSong Qingxin thought for a moment and felt that it was too abrupt. The elders in her family had told her about the trial tower. There were countless powerful traps on the first floor, after her cultivation was suppressed to the her foundation, it would be difficult to withstand these terrifying traps without the help of some heavenly treasures. Moreover, there were many geniuses who did not die here. Those geniuses were all arrogant and people who looked down on the trial tower, as for Xuan Yi\u2019s current appearance, no emotions could be seen. Song Qingxin was worried that he would be the same as those arrogant cultivators who looked down on the trial tower.After all, the trial tower was an existence that was highly valued by the elders in her family.\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201dSong Qingxin wanted to say something but stopped herself in the end. She shook her head and planned in her heart that if she was in danger, she would use her trump card. Although Xuan Yi had not known her for a long time, he had saved her chastity. To a certain extent, however, something more precious than a woman\u2019s life, how could she treat it as if nothing had happened? Especially when she thought of what had happened before, her face became extremely hot.After making up her mind, the two of them walked side by side on the narrow path. The illusion on the first floor was very complicated. Many of the paths were like mountain paths, and the surroundings were either fire or water. There was also a small path beside which green poison was bubbling, if they were to accidentally stick to it, losing their cultivation would be considered light. If it was serious, the poison would cause the body to die on the spot. Just from this, one could see the danger of the first floor. Song Qingxin\u2019s face was pale. Even though she was already very brave, she could not help but to feel worried. It was not only her, Xuan Yi who was walking in front, felt so too.However, Xuan Yi was calmer. He walked beside the paths that were filled with poisonous liquid with a calm expression. This made song qingxin feel much more at ease.\u201cBe careful!\u201d.A voice pulled back Song Qingxin\u2019s thoughts. She reacted and saw a tiny spiritual snake charging towards her.She dodged in a panic and was about to counter attack the poisonous snake when a palm print flew out from Xuan Yi\u2019s hand. The poisonous snake turned into a puff of green smoke.\u201cXuanling poisonous snake\u2026\u201dSong Qingxin knew this poisonous snake very well. She remembered that there was an elder in her family who was attacked by the Xuanling poisonous snake. Although he was rescued in the end, his cultivation was also reduced because of it. When her elder was bitten, the elder was already half a step into the magic realm. If this poisonous snake bit a cultivator below the golden elixir phase, one would be almost impossible to rescue. While she was still frightened, she could not help but to feel much more at ease as she looked at Xuan Yi\u2019s back as he walked forward.\u201cThere are traces of blood here!\u201dXuan Yi walked along a small path that was like a half-canyon. The walls on both sides were full of sword energy. There were also some white bones under the walls.\u201cIt looks very dangerous here.\u201d Xuan Yi kicked away the skull and took a look at the traces of the sword energy marks on the wall. Judging from the depth and the remaining aura, the power of this sword energy was probably no less than the full-strength attack of a cultivator at the golden elixir phase!There was a pool of blood on the ground and Bai Weiwei\u2019s headband.Xuan Yi remembered that Bai Weiwei treasured this headband very much because it was given to her by Xuan Yi. No one was allowed to feel it or touch it. Bai Weiwei was even unwilling to take it off when it was bed time. But now, this headband was thrown here.\u201cThis is?\u201dSong Qingxin saw Xuan Yi pick up the headband, and her expression was confused.\u201cIt belongs to my disciple!\u201d Xuan Yi said coldly. Song Qingxin felt a chill, but at the same time, she had some other emotions in her heart.She whispered, \u201cDisciple? Is it a female disciple?\u201dShe felt a little uncomfortable because the disciple that worried Xuan Yi was not her.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: No InjuriesChapter 43: No InjuriesAs they went deeper and deeper, more and more traps were designed. Song Qingxin pouted and said, \u201cCan\u2019t you wait for me? After all, I am\u2026\u201dThe valley of sword energy!The trial tower was very big, but Xuan Yi did not expect there to have a valley.\u201cI know, I know!\u201d\u201cThis is the most difficult part on the first floor of the trial tower. My elders have said that it is impossible to pass this place by relying on the potential of one\u2019s foundation phase. Unless there is a heavenly treasure, because there is no sword energy here that has the power of a cultivator at the golden elixir phase. And the center, there will be nearly a hundred sword energy forming a sword energy vortex.\u201d As she spoke, she took out a key with flames from her storage bag.\u201cThis is the burning heart. It can block out a portion of the overflowing sword energy.\u201dSensing the aura contained in the key, Xuan Yi frowned slightly. He could guess that this was definitely a trump card given to her by the elders in Song Qingxin\u2019s family. However, in the trial tower, such behavior would be considered cheating. Even if she passed the level, it would not be carved on the stone tablet.Just as Song Qingxin was about to hand it over, Xuan Yi approached the valley. In an instant, several sword energy attacked. Xuan Yi moved gracefully and dodged them one by one. When Song Qingxin saw how relaxed Xuan Yi was, she was so shocked with her jaw dropping.This, this, this\u2026Why was it different from what the elders in the family had said!Was it that easy?She could not believe and charged in. Suddenly, the sword energy struck. Faced with such a terrifying attack, Song Qingxin could not help shaking her teeth, and she rushed back without hesitation.Such a terrifying attack, let alone dodging it, even normal walking would not be able to do it!Looking at Xuan Yi\u2019s actions, she felt that Xuan Yi was not simple. The so-called danger that the elders of her family was as if nothing to him. Looking at his relaxed posture, it seemed like he had not used his full strength.In a short while, Xuan Yi walked into the central area, which was also the area where the sword energy was the fiercest.Song Qingxin\u2019s small mouth slightly curled up. Let\u2019s see how you can dodge this time.But just as this thought arose, she could not help but to worry again.\u201cCome back quickly! Why are you so impulsive! The sword energy vortex is much more terrifying than here. If you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019ll lose your life!\u201dXuan Yi did not seem to have heard her shout. He plunged into the sword energy vortex was quiet again!This time, Song Qingxin was completely flustered. She kept shouting for Xuan Yi at the entrance, but there was no response.Recalling the incident where Xuan Yi saved her virginity, Song Qingxin had the urge to cry, but there was no response.Yes, she liked to be mischievous, she liked to be unreasonable, but after all she was only a young girl. When she really lost someone who was very important to her, she finally cried out, but it was useless to cry for a while.She put away her cowardice, tied up her red hair, and resolutely walked in.Just like when her chastity was about to be taken away, Xuan Yi walked towards her in the same posture. He was determined, passionate, neither fast nor slow, but exceptionally firm.\u201cStep, step\u201d\u201cShoo, shoo, shoo\u201dThree streams of sword energy attacked her. She focused her gaze, and when the sword energy attacked, she quickly dodged to the side. The exposed part of her sleeve was cut into a ditch, but she continued to walk forward again as if nothing had happened, facing the incomparably sharp sword energy, step by step.\u201cShoo, shoo, shoo\u2026\u201dStreaks of sword energy came at her one after another. In a short while, more than half of Song Qingxin\u2019s outer clothes were torn, revealing her skin that was extremely tender and fragrant, but there was blood flowing on it.Soon, she arrived in front of the sword energy vortex. This was something that she did not even dare to think about. She did not rely on any magic treasures and reached the place step by step. However, at this moment, she was not in the mood to be happy, a hint of fear flashed through her eyes as she stared at the vortex. However, it was quickly replaced by the five wavering firmness.She took a step forward and the sword energy attacked.Song Qingxin gritted her teeth and shouted. However, there was still no response.If she was shouting from outside, it was reasonable to say that nothing could be heard from within the vortex. However, as she walked in, she realized that the vortex was not long. It was only a few feet. With her voice enhanced by spiritual energy, it was impossible for Xuan Yi not to hear it. Still, there was no response.Did this mean\u2026Impossible!He would definitely not die!Although she kept denying, tears kept flowing out of her eyes.Impossible\u2026It was just that no matter how she lied to herself in the current situation, the outcome was obvious, but she could not accept it.Human beings only knew how precious things were every time they lost it. At this moment, Song Qingxin understood, but there was no turning back.Therefore, she held back her tears and looked up at the incoming sword energy.Deep in the vortex, Xuan Yi touched the tip of his nose. He originally wanted to use this matter to let Song Qingxin grow, but he unexpectedly, Song Qingxin faded away from her immature and youthful exterior. She had a strong personality. This caused Xuan Yi to be slightly moved, just this little bit of character was enough to become his disciple. Moreover, her talent was also very high.\u201cStupid!\u201dThat familiar voice sounded in her ears. Song Qingxin was stunned on the spot. She hurriedly looked around, but she couldn\u2019t find that figure.\u201cThe sword energy vortex is not a dead end. You only have to find the pattern of the falling point of the sword energy, and you can walk out without injury.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: How is this possible!Chapter 44: How is this possible!Song Qingxin was extremely excited when she found out that Xuan Yi was still alive. However, when she heard Xuan Yi\u2019s words, her expression froze once again.\u201cFind the pattern and walk out without an injury??\u201dHow was this possible!Although this was her first time coming to the trial tower, her understanding of the trial tower was still very thorough. Not to mention the elders in her family, even Lin Jian who managed to break out of the trial with the best results, would not dare to say that he was unscathed!Lin Jian was one of the top super geniuses in the southern region! The number one existence in the trial tower!She increasingly felt that she could not see through Xuan Yi. If Xuan Yi\u2019s words were true, then how mysterious would he be? His identity as an elder could be stronger than many sect masters!Song Qingxin did not think too much. Instead, she followed Xuan Yi\u2019s words and began to look for the pattern. Xuan Yi would definitely not harm her. Then, whether these words were nonsense or the truth, she just had to try and find out.The sword energy continued to fall. She first retreated out of the vortex to dodge the sword energy while observing where was the falling point. After a stick of incense passed, Song Qingxin gritted her teeth slightly.She did not find any pattern. In other words, the sword energy in the vortex did not have any pattern at all.He was lying to her!\u201cBastard, you stupid bastard. I didn\u2019t let you get away with it! I only looked down on you before coming in! Do you have to fool me like that!\u201dThe more Song Qingxin said, the angrier she got. \u201cStupid man, there is no pattern!\u201dXuan Yi didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. He never expected Song Qingxin\u2019s little temper to be so weird, so he said again, \u201cTake three steps forward, one step back, and then five steps to the left.\u201dSong Qingxin felt suspicious, but without making any fuss, she followed Xuan Yi\u2019s steps and walked into the vortex.Then, she was overjoyed because not a single sword energy attacked her. As she made her moves, the seemingly sharp sword energy fell and tore a small ditch on the ground.\u201cYou didn\u2019t lie to me! Indeed unharmed! But why didn\u2019t I notice just now?\u201dAfter Xuan Yi gave her some pointers, Song Qingxin found the trick and skipped across the Sword Valley.And all of this was not as terrifying as the elders in her family had said!Also, all of this was just a few pointers from Xuan Yi. Song Qingxin was extremely shocked. What was Xuan Yi\u2019s background? So many geniuses felt helpless in the Sword Valley, yet he passed it so easily.The trial tower was definitely not just the two of them. Song Qingxin knew this when she was at the Sword Valley, she saw a few fresh corpses inside.Their clothes were very messy. From this, it could be seen that the rest of the people who came to the trial tower had more or less paid a price.On the other hand, Xuan Yi seemed to be in his own backyard. This made Song Qingxin feel very fortunate. Not only was her chastity saved by him, but she also got to rely on such a mysterious and powerful figure!Xuan Yi naturally saw the few corpses in the Sword Valley. Therefore, after crossing the Sword Valley, the two of them continued to forward without stopping. The more they walked, the more corpses there were. The battlefield became more and more intense. From this, it could be seen that this was not only the danger brought by the trial tower, but also the battlefield left behind by the cultivators.\u201cNo wonder there were no treasures along the way, not even spiritual herbs. It seems that the cultivators in front took all these things away, and there was also a battle.\u201dAfter eating the pills given by Xuan Yi, Song Qingxin returned to her lively self. However, this time, the young lady\u2019s clothes were partially visible, and her bare skin was exposed under the tattered clothes. It was not that she did not want to change, but her storage magic tools were all shattered in the Sword Valley, and Xuan Yi only had male clothings.In order to not let herself be exposed, she had no choice but to wear Xuan Yi\u2019s clothes.Seeing the clothes that were exactly the same for the two, she suddenly remembered the so-called double cultivation attires by the outside world were also exactly the same, and this made her face flushed.\u2026At the entrance of the second level of the trial tower.Bai Weiwei was covered in wounds. In the Sword Valley, the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect were thrown to the front to scout the way, and Bai Weiwei was the first to bear the brunt. It was because of her powerful comprehension ability that she actually managed to comprehend a trace of the pattern without the guidance of Xuan Yi, as a result, many casualties were reduced. But even so, the Xuan Sword sect still suffered heavy casualties. The ones who remained were either lucky or powerful. On the other hand, the Myraid Beast sect and the Tianzhen sect, avoided many deaths because of the Xuan Sword sect took the lead. The two sects also plundered the treasures along the way.When they arrived at the entrance of the second floor, there was no one left in the Xuan Sword sect who still had any fighting strength. Bai Weiwei was furious, she had no choice but to listen to them.The disciples behind Liu Mo kept glancing at Bai Weiwei\u2019s body. \u201cSenior Liu, after this little girl is useless, can I have some fun with her?\u201dLiu Mo glanced and said, \u201cI also want to have some fun with her!\u201d\u201cHehe, well, when you\u2019re done, it\u2019ll be my turn!\u201dListening to the disgusting conversation behind her, Bai Weiwei felt humiliated.In this world, the only man who did not covet her body was probably her master!Standing at the entrance of the second floor, Bai Weiwei was in despair. If this continued, there would only be two outcomes for her. She would either die in the trial tower, or she would walk out alive and die after being defiled.She felt reluctant and even wanted to give up her life a few times in exchange for her innocence.However, when she thought that she hadn\u2019t repaid her master\u2019s kindness, she knew that she could not die yet. If she died like this, her master would be very disappointed. Her master\u2019s painstaking efforts would be wasted.At this moment.A few black shadows suddenly appeared at the entrance. This group of people was eerie and engulfed in a thick black fog, followed by many corpses.The appearance of these people instantly made Liu Mo and the others, who were originally relaxed, tensed up.\u201cThe Yin Corpse sect! Why are they here!\u201dThen, a figure scuttled out at the back of Liu Mo. He took off his coat, revealing a pale and gloomy face.\u201cThe people from the Yin Corpse sect sneaked in, and none realized, really useless.\u201dHe Huanyuan frowned and kept thinking about countermeasures.The people from the Yin corpse sect were not easy to deal with, and since they chose to appear at this time instead of when they were seriously injured, it proved that they had full confidence.The disciples of the Xuan Sword sect became even more desperate. They had entered the tiger\u2019s den before they could leave their dangerous circumstances.They looked at Bai Weiwei, and Bai Weiwei looked back at them.Although they didn\u2019t say it out loud, they instantly understood what each other meant.If only elder Xuan were here.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: Elder Xuan!Chapter 45: Elder Xuan!\u201cSince you all know us, let\u2019s cut the crap. I want all the treasures you\u2019ve plundered on this floor!\u201d The leader of the Yin Corpse Sect said coldly. \u201cThen, look at Bai Weiwei. It\u2019s such a pity to refine such a beauty into a dry corspe!\u201d\u201cBrothers of the Yin Corpse Sect, the things you want are all in the hands of the Xuan Sword sect!\u201d He Huanyuan said resolutely,\u2026After leaving the Sword Valley, the two of them didn\u2019t encounter any danger. Some small traps were solved by Song Qingxin without Xuan Yi\u2019s help.At this point of time, she had already determined Xuan Yi\u2019s strength and couldn\u2019t wait to impress Xuan Yi to gain his liking.\u201cWait\u201dXuan Yi stretched out his hand. The first floor was too narrow to fly. Naturally, he couldn\u2019t see far, but sounds could be spread far way. From a distance, he heard a sound of fighting.\u201cWeiwei?\u201dSong Qing was puzzled. Who was Weiwei?She could not help being jealous of this woman named Weiwei, making him care so much.Xuan Yi\u2019s heart tightened, and he quickly rushed to the place where the screams came from.At the exit of the first floor, which was also the entrance of the second floor, a few people from the Xuan Sword sect were lying on the ground. Some of them had already lost their breath, and some were still wailing. And around these people stood a few people whose bodies were surrounded by black fog.The Yin corpse sect did not rely solely on their cultivation. Their powerful means was to produce Yin corpses. The stronger the Yin corpse was, the stronger its attack would be. Their cultivation were suppressed here, but the Yin corpse did not.\u201cYour Xuan Sword sect is really full of trash!\u201dStep!A long-haired man\u2019s eyes were emitting black fog. His eyes were emotionless and full of holes. As the person stepped forward, the arm of a Xuan Sword sect disciple broke on the spot. Blood splattered everywhere, and sparse flesh fell to the ground, the disciple wailed in pain and rolled continuously.The people from the Xuan Sword sect, Tianzhen Sect, and Myriad Beast sect all disappeared.\u201cSpit, blood splattered all over my mouth. Yin Yuan, you\u2019ve made these people into such a state. How am I supposed to train my corpses?\u201d\u201cTrash, even if I train them, they\u2019ll still be trash.\u201dThe person beside him wiped his mouth and grinned, \u201cDon\u2019t argue with me!\u201dJust as they were about to clean up the people on the ground, Xuan Yi arrived.Dust rose and Xuan Yi stood up, his hair falling slowly.He said softly, \u201cWhere is Weiwei?\u201dThis was his beloved disciple, an extremely talented beloved disciple, a beloved disciple that he had taken in with difficulties!Realizing that someone had arrived, the people from the Yin corpse sect all looked over.\u201cEh? Another trash from the Xuan Sword sect has arrived.\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s gaze swept over the conscious Xuan Sword sect disciples, \u201cWhere\u2019s Bai Weiwei?\u201dThe Xuan Sword sect disciples were originally in despair, but after hearing Xuan Yi\u2019s voice, they all looked at him in surprise.\u201cElder Xuan!\u201d\u201cElder Xuan!\u201d\u201cElder Xuan is here! It\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t see wrongly!\u201dAfter being crushed by the people from the Yin corpse sect, they all held a breath of resentment in their hearts. When they saw Xuan Yi\u2019s arrival, each of them was more excited than the other.One after another voice sounded, one of the disciples was about to pass unconscious, but after seeing Xuan Yi, he forced himself to stand up and bowed to Xuan Yi.\u201cElder Xuan, I\u2019ve embarrassed the Xuan Sword sect! Please punish me!\u201dWith his actions, the other disciples followed suit and half-knelt on the ground.\u201cPlease punish me, Elder Xuan!\u201dXuan Yi glanced around and didn\u2019t really care about the people from the Yin Corpse sect. Instead, he asked emotionlessly, \u201cWhere\u2019s Bai Weiwei?\u201dThe Xuan Sword sect wasn\u2019t united internally. In fact, the internal strife was very serious. However, when facing outsiders, the Xuan Sword sect was like a condensed and unparalleled sharp sword. There was only the possibility of breaking, not the possibility of scattering.Of course, no matter how united the sect was, it was inevitable that people like Murong Tian would appear.\u201cElder Xuan, senior sister Weiwei has been brought to the second floor by He Huanyuan and Liu Mo. Murong Tian has become a traitor!\u201d\u201cAt the entrance, our group met the people from the Yin Corpse sect.\u201d At the mention of the Yin Corpse sect, this disciple glanced at the gloomy-faced people beside him, and his tone trembled slightly, he continued, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t defeat these Yin corpse cultivators, but when we were preparing to escape, He Huanyuan and the others rushed into the second floor first, leaving us behind to cover the rear. Other people, Liu Mo, Murong Tian took way all the holy items and treasures.\u201dXuan Yi nodded slightly. Bai Weiwei\u2019s current situation was hard to say, but she was still alive.\u201cAbout the punishment, we\u2019ll talk about it when we return to the sect.\u201d Xuan Yi threw out some pills.\u201cThis is a raw meat pill!\u201d\u201cRaw meat pill! This is a pill that can regrow a severed arm after eating it!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always heard about Elder Xuan\u2019s generosity, but this time I finally got to experience it myself! This casual offer is even more precious than what my master gave me in a year!\u201d\u201cThank you, Elder Xuan, for the pill.\u201dThe disciples thanked him respectfully.Yin Yuan did not hide his displeasure. \u201cWho is this kid? Does he think we don\u2019t exist?\u201dThe rest of the disciples agreed, but one of them thought slightly, as if thinking of something, his expression changed slightly, \u201cThis is an elder from the Xuan sword sect, Xuan Yi!\u201dYin Yuan looked at him with disdain. \u201cXuan Yi? I\u2019m even Yin Er! I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s an elder or not, everyone here is at the foundation phase, but our Yin corpse sect can use the corpse at the golden elixir phase!\u201d\u201cSenior brother Yin Yuan, Xuan Yi is mysterious and unpredictable. It\u2019s better for us to be cautious. We might as well leave first.\u201d If the holy item had already been obtained, Yin Yuan might have retreated, but now that nothing was in hands, he was even teased by He Huanyuan and the others. He couldn\u2019t accept the fact that he had fought with the Xuan Sword sect without any gains, yet He Huanyuan and the others had already escaped to the second floor. He could only shift all of his anger onto the Xuan Sword sect. Under such circumstances, how could he be willing to retreat.\u201cBastard, retreat? If this gets out, won\u2019t it sound like the Yin Corpse Sect is afraid of the Xuan Sword sect? Or are you willing to bear the name of retreating without a fight?\u201dSince Yin Yuan said so, that person did not say anything else, but continued to stare at Xuan Yi vigilantly.\u201cAiya, Senior brother Yin Ke, you are too nervous. We have the golden elixir corpse soldiers. No matter how strong he is, can he still contend with the trial tower? He is just a cultivator at his foundation phase. I don\u2019t think Senior brother Yin Yuan needs to use his natal corpse soldier. Let\u2019s just wait for a good show!\u201dYin Ke thought for a moment and felt that it made sense. However, to be on the safe side, he was prepared to launch a sneak attack. He would not hold back and use his strongest killer move to kill Xuan Yi.As for the Xuan Sword sect, they naturally heard their conversation. Their originally relaxed hearts could not help but come wary.That\u2019s right! Elder Xuan was indeed powerful, but in here, he was only a cultivator at his foundation phase!\u201cWe\u2019re done!\u201d\u201cI thought that Elder Xuan would be able to lead us to live, but now it seems that Elder Xuan can\u2019t even protect himself.\u201dThey looked at each other, and once again fell into despair.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: Blood Ignited by an accidentChapter 46: Blood Ignited by an accident\u201cAre you confident?\u201d Song Qingxin\u2019s face was full of worry, but she knew clearly that no matter how worried she was, she couldn\u2019t solve the problem in front of her. It would be alright for her if she encountered the Yin Corpse sect outside, but in here, it was equivalent to a beginner fighting an expert. How could she fight, with the footwork that he taught her in the Sword Valley?It was useless. The people from the Yin Corpse sect and the sword energy that no one controlled were different things. How was it possible for them to escape in the face of several corpse soldiers which were in their golden elixir phase.\u201cNo problem.\u201d Xuan Yi waved his hand lightly and looked at the few terrifying Yin soldiers. He did not show a single expression, yet felt a little strange in the heart. In the trial tower, any human\u2019s cultivation would be suppressed. Although these corpse soldiers could not be considered as humans, but their bodies also contained extremely powerful spiritual energy fluctuations. Could it be that the trial tower could not detect it? Or was there some other reason?With this thought, Xuan Yi turned into a streak of light and charged out. Several powerful Yin soldiers also charged out. Their cold auras and rigid limbs that did not move at all, their attacks were so powerful that even aurous cultivators in their golden elixir phase would have to dodge them. Xuan Yi did not face these Yin soldiers head-on, as he dodged the powerful attacks of the corpse soldiers, he looked for an opportunity to use his limbs to touch these Yin soldiers.\u201cSystem, check on the corpse soldiers.\u201d\u201cNone.\u201d\u201cContinue checking.\u201d\u201cNone.\u201dAfter a few attempts, Xuan Yi finally detected one.\u201cYin soldiers, puppets full of resentment. There is powerful spiritual energy in their bodies. Other than that: unknown.\u201d\u201cAs long as they are not human, does the trial tower not suppress their cultivation?\u201dSince he did not get the answer he was expecting, Xuan Yi prepared to try a few more times. If not, he would directly kill all the Yin soldiers and their controllers.Yin Yuan\u2019s face was sullen. At this time, he figured that Xuan Yi was not powerful at all. It was all flattery. Otherwise, why didn\u2019t he go up and fight? Instead, he kept dodging.\u201cHe is definitely not as powerful as the legends say. Look at his current behaviour. It seems that he dodged all the attacks of the Yin corpses, but in fact, he just barely dodged them. Otherwise, why would he always brush past the Yin corpses?\u201d He did not know that Xuan Yi was trying to find out information about the Yin soldiers.\u201cWhat if he is looking for the weaknesses of the Yin Soldiers?\u201dYin Yuan laughed, \u201cThe Yin soldiers have no weaknesses. Unless they are directly annihilated, they will get up and continue fighting even if their limbs are broken. After all, these are the corpse soldiers that I have used a special method to refine.\u201dHe felt relieved. If Xuan Yi only had these, then today\u2019s ending was already clear!And Xuan Yi\u2019s behaviour was different in the eyes of the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect.\u201cElder Xuan knew that he couldn\u2019t win, but he still stood up for us\u2026\u201d\u201cI actually thought of escaping just now. Elder Xuan\u2019s boldness\u2026 really makes me ashamed!\u201dAt this time, Xuan Yi happened to investigate a corpse soldier and didn\u2019t notice the attack from the corpse soldier next to him. He was scratched a little.\u201cOh no, Elder Xuan can\u2019t hold on any longer!\u201dA disciple was filled with tears, \u201cI have never thought that someone would disregard his own life for the sake of our lives. I\u2019m afraid that some masters would run even faster than me if they were in danger! But today, Elder Xuan\u2019s realm! Truly makes me admire him! This is the debt. This is the elder of our Xuan Sword sect!\u201d\u201cCut the crap, I want to advance and retreat together with Elder Xuan. Even if I die, I want to die in front of Elder Xuan!\u201dThese words immediately aroused the blood of the Xuan Sword sect disciples. Having them hiding behind and watched as the Elder was beaten to death in front of them\u2026They could not bear to watch!Hence.They took out their longswords!\u201cI am willing to die for Elder Xuan!\u201d\u201cWe are willing to die in front of Elder Xuan!\u201d\u201cUse my blood to cast Elder Xuan into immortality!\u201dTheir voices were deafening. After eating the pills that Xuan Yi gave them, they had all recovered a lot. Their auras were extremely sharp, like a sharp knife that was shining with cold light.Some of them were expressionless, some looked ferocious, and some were even moved to tears by Xuan Yi\u2019s actions. However, no matter what their expressions were, there was only one thing in their hearts at this moment \u2014 to die in front of Elder Xuan!Song Qingxin also walked up, her small face covered in frost. Then, she gritted her teeth and looked at Xuan Yi\u2019s back, \u201cYou bastard!\u201dIn the arena, Xuan Yi had a puzzled look on his face.\u201c???\u201dThis group of disciples had gone crazy for some unknown reason, and some even started to cry on the spot. These behaviours made him confused. It was one thing if only one of them acting this way, but why did they all go crazy together? In the time it took to be stunned, the Yin soldiers attacked again, but Xuan Yi did not dodge, he was hit and flew dozens of meters on the spot.\u201cElder Xuan! Elder Xuan!\u201dThe hearts of the disciples were aroused.They were worried and angry.Song Qingxin held back her tears and took out her weapon. She looked straight at the Yin Yuan. Her eyes were filled with the ruthlessness.After Xuan Yi regained his senses, he did not have the mood to investigate the Yin soldiers anymore.His mouth moved slightly. \u201cStar constellation technique.\u201dUsually light with his words, however, brought an extremely terrifying aura!The trial tower shook slightly and dimmed down as if it was covering the sky and the moon. The light was completely covered and bloomed in Xuan Yi\u2019s hand again.\u201cRumble\u2026\u201dThe trial tower shook non-stop. Thick smoke filled the air and lasted for the time half an incense stick takes to burn.The first floor of the trial tower gradually returned to peace. Yin Yuan and the others completely disappeared, leaving layers of ashes on the spot.Other than that, there were also many mouths open, each of which seemed to be able to fit an egg.\u201cWhat\u2026 are we doing here?\u201d\u201cI remember that it seems like we are going to die in front of Elder Xuan.\u201dHaving said that, they all looked embarrassed. How could Elder Xuan need them!It seemed that they were overestimating themselves just now. With this kind of attack, not to mention Yin Yuan and the others, even if the sect master came, he would probably have to retreat three miles!They glanced at Xuan Yi with some hidden bitterness.Xuan Yi felt that something was wrong with their gazes and thought to himself that the power might be too powerful.He was a little uncertain before, worrying that his foundation phase cultivation was not enough to release his divine ability, so he specially burned his blood and essence. Unexpectedly, the commotion was too big.\u201cAre you guys okay?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: The Gathering of the sectsChapter 47: The Gathering of the sectsOn the second floor of the trial tower, Liu Mo and the others stood on the ground with great difficulty. Unlike the traps on the first floor, the second floor was completely suppressed. After entering, they were not much different from ordinary people. Not only that, the second floor also had an extremely strong gravitational force.The entire second floor had a long flight of steps. If one wanted to pass through the second floor, they could only walk up these steps. However, the more they walked, the stronger the gravitational force. Basically, if they walked halfway, the gravitational force they would have to endure would be ten times stronger than their own bodies, at this point, the group of people was at the beginning. They were walking slowly while their knees were feeling weak. At this moment, the trial tower shook and the group of people directly fell to the ground.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cDamn it, this powerful attack, could it be that a master level expert attacked the trial tower?\u201d\u201cHow is that possible, who dares to provoke this tower?\u201dHe Huan Yuan\u2019s words were not groundless. There had been rumours before that a disciple of a reclusive expert had entered the trial tower. However, because the disciple did not have much experience, he almost died miserably in the trial tower. The reclusive expert tried to break through the trial tower to save his disciple, but he never expected that the counter-attack of the trial tower would almost kill him.\u201cSo, someone is attacking inside the trial tower!\u201dLiu Mo was shocked. What kind of person could release such terrifying power?!\u201cIt\u2019s best that we don\u2019t meet such a person.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go quickly. We\u2019re halfway there.\u201dBai Weiwei, who was walking at the front, looked pale, but she felt a sense of joy in her heart because she had smelled a familiar scent from the violent aura just now.It must be master, that\u2019s right!Master had come to save her!This made her, who was in despair, felt a glimmer of hope in her heart.\u201cOh no, the gravity in front is getting stronger.\u201dBai Weiwei spat out a mouthful of blood as her blood and energy boiled.Liu Mo and the others stopped in place.\u2026At the entrance of the second floor, Xuan Yi kept all the treasures in his storage bag. This made the disciples envious. They had seen with their own eyes the treasures that Liu Mo and the others from the Myraid Beast sect had plundered. Among them, there was no lack of treasures like holy items, take one of the sky bright pills for example. If a cultivator at one\u2019s foundation phase ate it, the cultivator would be able to unleash the power of an aurous cultivator in the golden elixir phase. However, this was only an ordinary item among them.While they were envious, they wanted these holy items very much. Even if Elder Xuan threw out two of the items casually, it would a precious existence to them. However, they could only watch as Xuan Yi kept all these items, he had no intention of sharing with them.Elder Xuan, all these were things that they had exchanged their lives for!Later, they remembered that their lives were saved by Elder Xuan, and they felt much more balanced.The group of disciples followed behind Xuan Yi. They were all well-behaved. Now, they were already jealous of Bai Weiwei. Not only did she have a powerful master, but she also was being doted on so much. If it were their own master, they might not be able to do this.\u201cFor the next stage, you have to follow me. If anything happens, I might not be able to take care of everyone.\u201d\u201cI understand!\u201dWith such a powerful elder, who would be willing to leave? They all wanted to get as close as possible.As they stepped into the second floor, a wave of gravity hit them.They saw a flight of stairs that extended all the way to the depths. They could not see the end at all. The surroundings were quiet. On the stairs, there were many white bones. Some of them were almost dried into powder. A light touch would turn them into ashes.\u201cElder Xuan\u2026\u201dThe disciples present began to swallow their saliva.They had not even stepped onto the stairs yet they already felt a sense of suffocation. In addition, they had no cultivation at all. In such a state, they were like mortals. How could they pass.From this floor onwards, there would be a record of the rankings. The fastest to pass the level could be ranked on the stone tablet. The fastest to pass the level now was Lin Jian. They did not think that they could surpass that monster Lin Jian, after all, they were not cultivators of the same level.However, if they could leave their names on the stone tablet, this was also a way to prove their strength. At least after leaving their names on the stone tablet, their status in the sect would increase.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Although you have no cultivation, your bodies have been baptized by spiritual energy for a long time. You are already different from mortals. In other words, as long as your willpower is strong enough, you can pass this level. The stronger your willpower is, the faster you can pass the level.\u201d\u201cI see. Thank you very much, Elder Xuan.\u201dOutside the Saint Mystic Realm, countless sect elders stood at the top of the mountain. The trial tower was not far in front of them.\u201cIt seems that all of our disciples have entered the trial tower. We old geezers should go and take a look too.\u201d The leader, Wang Ye, who was from the Myraid Beast sect, was looking forward to the ranking of the trial tower, he hoped that some of his disciples could enter the stone tablet ranking.Other than the elders from the Myraid Beast sect, there were many other sects, including the Xuan Sword sect, the Tianzhen sect, and even evil sects like the Yin Corpse sect.These people were without exception, all of them were elders waiting for the trial tower\u2019s ranking.If their disciples could enter the stone tablet ranking, it would be an honor for them. Furthermore, they would have more choices when it came to recruiting disciples in the future.At that moment, a sword descended from the sky!The people waiting in front of the stone tablet were no small characters. They all frowned at the situation.\u201cWho dares to act so presumptuously in front of the southern region\u2019s major sects!\u201d The sect master of Tianzhen sect shouted sternly. His entire body began to emit an intense pressure. The formation diagram on his body flickered, and golden light swirled around him. If one were to look closely, he or she would be able to see that the golden light flowed back and forth in a regular pattern. It just so happened to gather into a formation diagram, and the core of the formation was his body.This place had gathered the elders of most sects in the southern region, and yet someone actually dared to insert a sword here. If it was unintentional, the elders of these sects would not have pursued the matter in order to show their magnanimity, however, this sword was clearly aimed at them. It directly inserted itself in front of the group of people. This was either a provocation or a threat.Who was so bold?\u201cHmm? This sword looks familiar to me.\u201d Wang Ye rode on a jade-colored qilin. He walked up and took a closer look, and his expression suddenly changed.The others didn\u2019t understand, but when they noticed Wang Ye\u2019s change, they put away their displeasure and had different thoughts.\u201cSect master Wang, do you know this sword?\u201d Qing Xuzi asked. He scanned the surrounding environment and didn\u2019t feel any spiritual energy fluctuations.This sword that came from the sky did not have any spiritual energy fluctuation. How did it come down? Could the owner of this sword be in the sky?The sect master of the Yin Corpse sect chuckled. \u201cYou noble sects are really timid. Just a sword and it has scared you into this state!\u201dThe words from the sect master of the Yin Corpse sect caused a burst of laughter from the evil sects.They were originally enemies with a sect like the Xuan Sword sect. They were not afraid of offending them at all.On the other hand, Li Changqing of the Tianzhen sect couldn\u2019t hold it anymore.\u201cYin Jiu, have you forgotten that you\u2019ve been trapped in our sect and haven\u2019t come out for a year?\u201dYin Jiu glanced at him, not making a mockery anymore.\u201cThe Tianzhen sect is indeed worthy of being a great formation sect. The moment a speech is made, these evil sects go speechless.\u201dAt this moment, a sedan chair came from afar. This attracted their attention and what shocked them even more was that the eight people carrying the sedan chair were all at their golden elixir phase!The group of sect masters and elders couldn\u2019t help but breathed in cold air.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: Genius Lin Jian\u201cSure enough, it\u2019s him.\u201d Li Changqing looked shocked.These sect masters were not the most important figures in the southern region. However, despite their high status, they had never made such a big fuss. They did not even have many followers.\u201cWho is this?\u201dOther than Li Changqing, there were also a few people made the same expression showing that how everything explained itself.\u201cLin Jian!\u201d\u201cThis person is Lin Jian.\u201dLin Jian was an extremely monstrous figure in the southern region. Although he did not belong to any force, no sect had looked down on him. This was because when Lin Jian was at his most powerful period, he had once challenged all the sects in the southern region, he had single-handedly challenged the sect leader of a large sect. Although he had lost several times, this also proved that his strength was not to be underestimated. If it was an ordinary person, forget challenging the entire southern region, any sect would be able to crush him.Lin Jian not only did it, but also survived.Li Changqing was one of those who had been defeated by him. Hence, he was very familiar with Lin Jian\u2019s sword.\u201cIt\u2019s Lin Jian, that kid.\u201dQing xuzi stroked his beard. Lin Jian and him had fought before, but Lin Jian was defeated. However, Lin Jian had injuries on his body at that point of time, and Qing Xuzi would have been in a period of complete victory. Although he had won, it was an unfair victory. Qing Xuzi had a very high opinion of Lin Jian, he was a sword genius with extremely monstrous talent. At that time, Qing Xuzi had wanted to take Lin Jian in as his disciple, but Lin Jian rejected him.All these years, the only person he encountered who was almost as talented as Lin Jian was Xuan Yi.\u201cI\u2019m afraid, in terms of talent, only Elder Xuan in our sect can match him!\u201d Qing Xuzi said slowly.Xuan Yi and the others had seen him before and knew his mysteriousness. However, they still felt that it was a little exaggerating when compared Xuan Yi and Lin Jian. Xuan Yi was indeed powerful, but Lin Jian was the one they were truly afraid. This person had entered the path by killing, he had challenged countless sects for ten years, and he had occupied first place on the trial tower\u2019s stone tablet for ten years. Was Xuan Yi a genius? Of course, but Xuan Yi did not have the strength to challenge all the sects in the southern region. He might not even be able to defeat the sect leader of the Xuan Sword sect.Furthermore, in these ten years, the southern region had produced many geniuses, yet Lin Jian was still ranked first on the stone tablet.The Tianzhen sect\u2019s reincarnated genius five years ago, only ranked tenth.The Myriad Beast Sect\u2019s reincarnated beast emperor was only ranked sixth.And the Xuan Sword sect\u2019s strongest was only ranked outside of the 100th.Every time Qing Xuzi thought of this, he would not even have the mood to go into seclusion.In the past thousands of years, who knew how many people had passed through the trial tower, but not a single person from the Xuan Sword sect was able to enter the top 100.From this, it could be seen that Lin Jian was indeed a monster. After all, not only did he make it impossible for the later generations to defeat him, he had also trampled all those peerless geniuses and monsters under his feet in the past thousands of years.The sedan chair was getting closer and closer. The sect masters of the various sects all looked over at the same time.\u201cTramp\u201dThe sedan chair landed on the ground. The curtain of Lin Jian\u2019s sedan chair was lifted, revealing a face that was filled with an evil aura.\u201cEveryone is here?\u201dHearing Lin Jian\u2019s voice, the various sect masters turned their heads. These were the people who had been defeated by Lin Jian.There were also some who did not like to talk to Lin Jian. Lin Jian was a genius, so he was naturally domineering and did not think these sect masters mattered. Once he said something that was not overboard, then these sect masters would be fighting back, as if they did not have any magnanimity, however, if they did not fight back, they would be angry by Lin Jian\u2019s Qi again.\u201cLin Jian, what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m here for the imperial level inheritance.\u201d Lin Jian yawned lazily.\u201cImperial level inheritance? That is a legendary existence. It\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t entered this trial tower before. If there is an imperial level inheritance inside, didn\u2019t you already get it long time ago?\u201d The eyes of the Tianzhen sect\u2019s sect master lit up, Li Changqing\u2019s heart was filled with pride. Back then, when he lost to Lin Jian, he was very unconvinced. However, if there was an imperial level inheritance, then defeating Lin Jian could be said to be an easy feat.Lin Jian stared at the trial tower. \u201cI did pass through the trial tower, but every time, I was sent out before I could enter the third floor.\u201dQing Xuzi frowned. \u201cSo, you think there\u2019s an imperial level inheritance on the third floor?\u201d\u201cOf course, no one has been able to enter the third floor for thousands of years!\u201dThe sect masters were very familiar with the trial tower. The first floor tested the disciples\u2019 reactions, and the second floor tested their willpower. Over the years, no one had stepped into the third floor. They didn\u2019t even believe that there was a third floor.\u201cThe third floor?\u201d Yin Xuan stroked the small skull hanging by his waist, and a gleam of light flashed in his eyes.If there really was such a so-called imperial level inheritance, then their Yin Corpse sect could almost become the number one sect in the southern region. Such a legendary existence was similar to the legendary ancient great gods. He could imagine that if they had an imperial level inheritance, how much of an improvement would it bring to a sect? Even if it didn\u2019t fall into the hands of the Yin Corpse sect, then they definitely couldn\u2019t let other sects obtain it. Otherwise, the Yin Corpse Sect, as an evil sect, would definitely be the first to be wiped out.\u201cOf course, I\u2019m just guessing, whether there is an imperial level inheritance or not, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Lin Jian said with a smile.Qing Xuzi frowned. Lin Jian\u2019s words were a bit strange. First, he threw out the imperial level inheritance, then he said he didn\u2019t know if there was one. What was his purpose? If there really was one, then he didn\u2019t need to mention it. It would be great if he could get the imperial level inheritance by himself, so there was only one possibility, there was a high probability that there was an imperial level inheritance in there, but Lin Jian could not obtain it by himself. Therefore, he wanted to use this method to get the help of these old geezer, or to make use of these old freaks.He subconsciously touched his beard. If that was the case, then these old freaks might not be able to resist the temptation of the imperial level inheritance and might be used by Lin Jian. However, Qing Xuzi did not say anything, this was because he was also very interested in this imperial level inheritance. He signalled to the few elders behind him. The few elders did not understand, but they were still alerted by Qing Xuzi\u2019s action.\u201cThen why are you here? Are you going to enter the trial tower?\u201dLin Jian smiled slightly, \u201cThat\u2019s right. When the people in the trial tower come out, see if there are any with good talent. Take a disciple, go in and see if there is a possibility to enter the third floor.\u201dTake a disciple?Didn\u2019t Lin Jian know that all the disciples in the trial tower were disciples of the major sects?Trying to snatch their disciples right in their faces? Moreover, depending on their talents.This was a bit too arrogant.Lin Jian\u2019s arrogance made the people of the various sects snort.In front of the stone tablet, Lin Jian looked at the first place and said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s been ten years. It seems that there aren\u2019t many talented people in the various sects.\u201dTen years ago, Lin Jian was only half way through his golden elixir phase. But now, he was unpredictable for many sect masters. This was then a true genius, a monster.After ten years, no one could still break Lin Jian\u2019s record. This made the people from the various sects lose face.Especially when Lin Jian was such an arrogant person. Every word he said was very unpleasant to hear.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to take in a disciple this time.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Taking in a discipleChapter 49: Taking in a discipleIn the past ten years, no one had broken the record. This made everyone unable to refute, because no one under the sects had the talent to outface Lin Jian.Li Changqing\u2019s eyes rolled, and he suddenly said, \u201cXuan Yi from the Xuan Sword sect is also inside. I think this genius might be able to break the ranking of the stone tablet. However, this person is an elder of the Xuan Sword sect. Fellow mate Lin Jian, I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t take him in as a disciple.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t take him in, then so be it. But\u2026 do you think he can break my record?\u201d Lin Jian asked in return, then, he laughed loudly and said, \u201cHahahaha\u2026 it\u2019s not that I\u2019m arrogant. I\u2019ve already challenged this trial tower many times. It\u2019s impossible for anyone in the southern region to break my record on the first try!\u201dHearing upon this, everyone present felt that he was right. The trial tower itself was a very complicated place. Entering it for the first time and entering it many times naturally weren\u2019t the same concept. Xuan Yi\u2019s talent was indeed shocking, reaching a realm that many people could not reach in their entire lives at the age of 20, but this was only in terms of cultivation. And in a dangerous place like the trial tower, his experience was completely different from Lin Jian\u2019s 40 years of life and death experience.\u201cXuan Yi, in your eyes, is a genius. In my eyes, he is only mediocre.\u201dIt was not groundless for him to say so. He was a cultivator with average talent, and now his efforts accounted for the majority of his achievement. If he was given enough talent, he was confident that he could reach the sec master phase at the age of 20, instead of being stuck in the half-step of sect master at the age of 40.Under such circumstances, a genius in his 20s was only enforcing the law, which made him somewhat disdainful.Behind Qing Xuzi, Wang Hu was originally not qualified to come here, but because he was worried about the safety of his master, Xuan Yi, and his junior sister, Bai Weiwei, he specifically asked Qing Xuzi to come here. He had the lowest accomplishments here, just in the condensing phase, it could be said that anyone here could crush him with a stretch of a finger. As the most untalented disciple under Xuan Yi, he was very clear that with his talent, it was almost impossible for him to enter the inner sect, let alone the abundant cultivation resources.At this moment, hearing that someone was looking down on his master, he couldn\u2019t help but stand out.\u201cMaster\u2019s techniques are sky-high, who do you think you are!\u201dEveryone present was shocked.Was this a cultivator in the condensing phase?He must be out of his mind!In front of him was the existence of a half-step sect master. To kill him, the master only needed to lift a finger. While they were shocked, they also had new admiration for him. They couldn\u2019t help but to think that if they were the ones being slandered outside, then would their disciples have the courage to stand out like Wang Hu? They asked themselves once, but the answer they got was impossible!No matter how much their disciples respected them, their disciples would not take their lives as a joke.Xuan Yi, having such a disciple, made them a little envious.Being insulted by a junior in the energy condensation phase, Lin Jian was rare to not get angry. He sized up Wang Hu and said, \u201cLittle guy, you are like me back then, and even your talent is about the same as mine.\u201dLooking at Wang Hu, he felt as if he had seen himself many years ago. He had the same determination and firmness. Judging from the sword marks on his body, he must have been a very hard-working maniac.This was simply what he was twenty years ago!Without talent, no one would take him in. In this dangerous southern region, he fought and trained.\u201cKid, are you interested in becoming my disciple?\u201dThe sect leaders were all shocked on the spot!What?Take him in as a disciple?If they weren\u2019t blind, this Wang Hu was an extremely poor talented existence. Let alone taking him in as a disciple, some people were so arrogant that they wouldn\u2019t even let him enter the sect.Qing Xuzi frowned slightly. Could it be that there was something special about Wang Hu? Otherwise, why would Xuan Yi take him in as a disciple? Right now, even Lin Jian had taken a liking to him. If it was just a genius who had taken a liking to him, he could have ended it by making a mistake. However, if he had taken a liking to two geniuses in a row, it couldn\u2019t be explained in that way.He used his spiritual sense to scan, but he did not find anything special about Wang Hu. His innate talent was also very poor.But even so, he still made up his mind. He could not let Wang Hu be taken away by Lin Jian!But before he could speak, Wang Hu said sternly, \u201cMy master is only Xuan Yi!\u201dLin Jian smiled disdainfully. It was reasonable for a child to be deceived by some small characters at such a young age. As long as he showed more strength than his master later, he would beg Lin Jian to take him in as a disciple.After making up his mind, Lin Jian did not say anything else and looked at the ranking on the stone tablet.After reaching the second level, the disciples inside would be recorded by the stone tablet with every few steps they took. At this moment, there were also some changes in the ranking.The most obvious one was Bai Weiwei from the Xuan Sword sect. The people outside did not know what was happening inside, but Bai Weiwei\u2019s ranking kept rising. Soon, she arrived outside of the 100th place.\u201cBai Weiwei, 63rd step!\u201dA wave of exclamations sounded, and the disciples behind the various sects looked shocked.They had heard about this flight of stairs from their senior brothers who had challenged the trial tower.Every step of gravity would increase, and those who were geniuses in their eyes had only walked a dozen steps, but this was already very powerful. Before that, no one from the Xuan Sword sect had even reached twenty steps.\u201cThe Xuan Sword sect has produced a genius disciple!\u201dThose who could enter the mystic realm were all the best chosen by the various sects, and geniuses were naturally divided into levels. Those like Bai Weiwei who had reached the 63rd step could basically be classified as super geniuses, even Lin Jian had only reached the 100th step when he first entered the mystic realm. After that, he could not hold on any longer and retreated.Qing Xuzi was overjoyed. He knew very well that before Bai Weiwei became Xuan Yi\u2019s disciple, she was still a useless existence. How long had it been before she had already reached such a level!If all of this was Bai Weiwei\u2019s own efforts, he definitely would not believe it, the greatest credit would definitely go to master Xuan Yi.He took a deep breath, and thought that he found a treasure!\u201cSenior sister Bai Weiwei! This is my senior sister!\u201dWang Hu was a young man after all. He could not help but boast to everyone. When Lin Jian heard his words, Lin Jian glanced at him and was slightly surprised. This was Xuan Yi\u2019s disciple? However, he immediately regained his calmness. Even if it was, he, Xuan Yi, was probably just lucky.The sect master of the Tianzhen sect, Li Changqing, said unhappily, \u201cThis is just the beginning. He Huanyuan in our sect is a genius with excellent innate ability and has reached the 60th step. I believe that she will soon catch up with Bai Weiwei from the Xuan Sword sect!\u201dWang Ye sighed in his heart. For many years, no disciple from the Xuan Sword sect had entered the top 100 of the leaderboard, while the Tianzhen sect had one every year. When the Tianzhen sect and the Xuan Sword sect began to compare, they had already lost.Wang Ye had some impression of this disciple. He clearly remembered that this disciple did not have any outstanding points at that time, one with average talent or even a little poor. How long had it been since then, and the disciple could actually achieve a level that so many geniuses could not reach, the mystery of Xuan Yi was magnified in his eyes once again.He still had confidence in Liu Mo. Although Liu Mo was a little distance away from Bai Weiwei, the smart her quickly thought that Bai Weiwei might have been coerced by them to explore the way.There were not many people who could reach the end of the second floor, and they did not know what kind of danger they would encounter after a hundred steps. Therefore, Bai Weiwei\u2019s lead might be fake.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: Disperse your cultivationChapter 50: Disperse your cultivationIn the secret realm of the sage, dark clouds covered the place, forming a mountain of clouds above the secret realm. Light rain drizzled down from the sky.Compared to the rainy days outside, the second floor of the trial tower was completely sealed off. The disciples of the Xuan Sword sect gasped for breath one after another. However, they did not exercise intensely. They only stood at the entrance of the second floor, it was as if they were carrying a huge mountain on their shoulders.Xuan Yi could feel Bai Weiwei\u2019s aura here. In other words, Bai Weiwei was also here. Xuan Yi felt much more relaxed here.He took a step forward and suddenly, gravity struck him. However, he quickly adapted to it.The disciples looked at Elder Xuan\u2019s face and saw that even he was acting like this, then they themselves definitely would not be able to walk far.After another disciple stepped in, his legs started to weaken before walking two steps.However, he knew that although the second floor was hard to pass, as long as they were inside walking, the further they walked and the longer they stayed, the more helpful it would be for them.Soon, all the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect walked up the steps.After getting used to it for a while, Xuan Yi used the system to analyze and found that this was a place similar to gravity. It wasn\u2019t difficult to walk further and faster, as long as they dispersed their cultivation. This was because the stronger the spiritual power, the greater the gravity, although they had all been suppressed to the foundation phase, the gravity from the foundation phase was not something they could withstand. Especially inside, the gravity was doubled.However, dispersing one\u2019s cultivation was not something that everyone dared to think about.What were they here for? Wasn\u2019t it for the cultivation?If they dispersed their cultivation, what was the point of coming here?Xuan Yi stood at his original spot for a while. He could disperse his cultivation. After all, there was the system\u2019s existence.However, this group of disciples was a problem, how to convince them to disperse their cultivation as well?A few disciples walked out a few steps and they were already covered in sweat. Turning around, they found that Xuan Yi was still standing at his original spot, not moving.One of them whispered, \u201cIt seems that Elder Xuan is not as omnipotent as we imagined.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. How can we imagine that we can walk faster than Elder Xuan when we are outside?\u201d\u201cIn the trial tower is a life-and-death situation. There is only a slim chance of survival on the second floor. I, Chen Hai, am not exaggerating. I am half a body length ahead of Elder Xuan in this situation!\u201d\u201cWhat? Only half a body length? I am three steps ahead of Elder Xuan!\u201d\u201cAll of you are trash. I\u2019ll just wait for Elder Xuan on the spot.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll slow down. I\u2019m afraid that Elder Xuan won\u2019t be able to see my back.\u201dThe group of disciples shouted. This excitement was even happier than when they had obtained a treasure!Song Qingxin was also jumping around Xuan Yi happily, \u201cAiya, I didn\u2019t expect that you have today.\u201dThinking of Xuan Yi\u2019s previous actions, she felt a sense of revenge now.\u201cSystem, temporarily absorb my cultivation.\u201dAs his spiritual energy was sucked dry, Xuan Yi felt the pressure on his body disappeared completely. He took two steps forward, but only to feel the weight of a brick on his shoulder. For his body which had been baptized by the spiritual energy, this degree of gravity was almost the same as nothing.Soon, he passed Song Qingxin and walked forward as if he was walking on flat ground. In just a few breaths\u2019 time, Xuan Yi had reached the front of the group.The few people who were mocking him earlier suddenly opened their mouths wide and stood still on the spot like pillars.\u201cIs Elder Xuan telling us that only by working hard, we can definitely go further than others?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s telling us that a trash is a trash after all. No matter how hardworking one is, one can only follow behind a genius.\u201dXuan Yi didn\u2019t leave after he walked to the front. Instead, he turned around and faced the group of people. His white robe quietly floated down, giving off an otherworldly aura.\u201cAs long as you disperse your cultivation, you can walk as if on flat ground.\u201dThese words immediately shocked all the disciples that were present.\u201cDisperse your cultivation!\u201dRegardless of the shocked gazes given by the disciples, Xuan Yi said lazily, \u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong, if you disperse your cultivation at this time, when you reach the end, your cultivation will return. This stage tests not only willpower, but also the determination and boldness of cultivators.\u201dAfter saying this, Xuan Yi took a step and left. His steps were light, extremely light.At this moment, two groups of people suddenly entered the entrance.Song Qingxin recognized the clothes of one of them. They were the clothes of the Divine Medicine Valley.However, she was not familiar with these people. After experiencing the previous events, she had completely given up on the Divine Medicine Valley and was prepared to leave it. If it was really impossible, she would ask the elders of her family to find another alchemy sect for her, she couldn\u2019t help but look at Xuan Yi\u2019s back. She wondered if he knew how to refine pills?The clothes of the other party were somewhat similar to the Divine Medicine Valley, except that the rust on their clothes was the pattern of weapons.Very quickly, the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect recognized them. The Divine Medicine Valley and the weapon sect.Regardless of whether it was refining pills or weapons, the status of the southern region was much higher than that of the ordinary disciples.After coming here and seeing the people from the Xuan Sword sect, one raised his head and asked, \u201cYou can\u2019t walk with just this little distance? I\u2019m afraid your Xuan Sword sect will be at the bottom again this year.\u201dThe person who spoke wore a golden robe. His status in the weapon sect was obviously not low, the man beside him continued, \u201cFortunately, I didn\u2019t join the Xuan Sword sect at that time. Otherwise, I would be with this group of trash now. I might not even have broken through to the condensing phase.\u201d\u201cSenior, the people from the Divine Medicine Valley are also here. It seems that we have an opponent this time.\u201dThe people from the weapon sect didn\u2019t think that the Xuan Sword sect mattered at all. Even the people from the Divine Medicine Valley looked down the Xuan Sword sect, and put all their attention on the weapon sect.In the eyes of both sides, the weak Xuan Sword sect was not qualified to compare with them.However, their actions made the Xuanjian sect members furious.What was this.Despise?Contempt?Utter disdain!If it was before they met Elder Xuan, they would have tolerated it. However, after they met Elder Xuan, although he did not teach them anything, Elder Xuan\u2019s domineering attitude made them feel extremely happy!Why must our Xuan Sword sect keep the heads down and tolerated, even if being despised by others?One of the disciples gritted his teeth and dispersed all of his cultivation without leaving a trace.An explosion sounded from within his body and he spat out a mouthful of blood.When the people from the Divine Medicine Valley saw this scene, they all laughed with disdain, \u201cIt\u2019s just a few steps, and you\u2019re already spitting out blood?\u201dQi Ling, the leader of the weapon sect, smirked and said, \u201cYou Xuan Sword sect, it\u2019s better for you to retreat. If you stay any longer, I\u2019m afraid you will lose your life!\u201dWith that said, they rushed out, in a fast speed, almost surpassing the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect in a few breaths.One side had elixir, and the other side had weapons to support them. They would naturally be much faster than the Xuan Sword sect.Looking at the crowd that had surpassed them, the disciple who had lost his cultivation stepped out. For a moment, there was actually no gravity, which made him ecstatic.\u201cElder Xuan is right!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: Elder Xuan put in a lot of effortThe disciples started to follow suit. Soon, all the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect lost their cultivation.Song Qingxin was going crazy.How much courage did it take to lose their cultivation.Just one sentence from Xuan Yi and they actually dared to do it.This requires much trust.Of course, what she didn\u2019t know was that the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect trusted Xuan Yi because they didn\u2019t want to tolerate anymore.Especially after seeing Xuan Yi\u2019s dominance.Moreover, this wasn\u2019t considered a risk. Elder Xuan clearly said that their cultivation would return after clearing the level. Since that was the case, then surpass them and crush them!At the top of the stone tablet ranking.The group of sect experts watched as the ranking kept changing.Bai Weiwei was still in the lead, but Liu Mo and He Huanyuan followed closely behind.What really caught the attention was Xuan Yi.Initially, when Xuan Yi and the rest entered the second floor, their names were displayed on the stone tablet, merely ranked a few thousand places away.However, it didn\u2019t take long for Xuan Yi to break into the top 1,000, and his ranking continued to rise. It was normal for him to rise, but this speed shocked them.One by one, he surpassed them without stopping at all.\u201cHiss!\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t this person need to recover?\u201d\u201cI observed him. He surpassed the top 1,000, and he used the same time to surpass the top 800. This means that he didn\u2019t rest at all!\u201dAnyone who challenged the trial tower, even an existence like Lin Jian, had to recover their bodies. Otherwise, how could they continue to go deeper and endure such an exhausting trial.\u201cIs this Elder Xuan from the Xuan Sword sect? He is indeed powerful!\u201dThen, the people from the Divine Medicine Valley and the weapon sect also caught up. However, their rankings rose very slowly, and each time they rose, it took longer than the previous one.Behind them were the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect.The elder of the Divine Medicine Valley laughed lightly, \u201cSect Master Qing, it seems that other than Xuan Yi, the other disciples of your Xuan Sword sect are all very ordinary! Is this the genius of your sect?\u201dFaced with the ridicule of the Divine Medicine Valley, Qing Xuzi\u2019s expression was somewhat ugly, but he was unable to make any retort. After all, the Divine Medicine Valley was indeed ahead of their Xuan Sword sect, and the ranking of the Xuan Sword sect did not fluctuate much.The person from the weapon sect laughed and said, \u201cThe Xuan Sword sect has always been at the bottom for so many years. Now that Xuan Yi has appeared, it\u2019s already a breakthrough.\u201dQing Xuzi\u2019s face turned black as he glared fiercely.\u201cI think it\u2019s better for the Xuan Sword sect to come out. It saves the disciples from suffering casualties inside. These are all geniuses chosen by the Xuan Sword sect. If one of them dies, it would be a loss!\u201dNot only Qing Xuzi, even the elders behind him could not help having faces turn black.However, the truth was that their disciples were indeed inferior to the people from the Divine Medicine Valley and the weapon sect. They entered later than the Xuan Sword sect, but they had already surpassed the Xuan Sword sect.Right at this moment, Qing Xuzi and the others heard a cry of surprise!\u201cLook, the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect are moving at a fast speed.\u201dThe ranking on the stone tablet dropped rapidly, and almost all the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect were rapidly increasing their rankings.The experts of the various sects felt as if their throats had been choked, they could not make any sound.\u201cImpossible, this is fake!\u201d\u201cYour Xuan Sword sect definitely cheated!\u201dQing Xuzi\u2019s face was full of astonishment. He had never thought that this group of disciples would give him such a big surprise. However, he was very clear about the standards of this group of disciples. How could they possibly improve so quickly?At this moment, he suddenly thought of Xuan Yi. Only Xuan Yi could make so many disciples improve so quickly. But on second thought, he felt reluctant. Xuan Yi was indeed mysterious, but such thing was too shocking. Qing Xuzi could understand that Xuan Yi himself improved so quickly, but allowing everyone to prompt quickly, Qing Xuzi could not think of it, no one could do it.\u201cIs your Xuan Sword sect already so despicable now?\u201d Yin Jiu stroked the tip of the brows. \u201cIt seems that evil sects like us are more upright than righteous sects like you. At least we can afford to lose and won\u2019t win by cheating!\u201dQing Xuzi snorted coldly. \u201cThe trial tower is a mystic realm passed down from the ancient times. Not to mention the disciples inside, even if we go in, we may not have the ability to cheat. I think some people are afraid of being suppressed by our Xuan Sword sect and are unhappy, right?\u201d\u201cStop arguing. When they come out, we will know.\u201d\u2026Inside the trial tower, the Divine Medicine Valley and the weapon sect were standing one after the other. Some of them were swallowing pills, while others were using specially forged spirit armor, only to determine who was better.However, the deeper they went, the harder it was to walk. It was as if they had to rest for dozens of breaths every step they took.Just as the two sides were fighting to rush forward, the people from the Xuan Sword sect appeared, almost in a running posture, catching up all the way. Both sides watched helplessly as the Xuan Sword sect caught up, then levelled up, and then surpassed.The golden-robed man was stunned. He was one of the top geniuses in the weapon sect, and the person who was on the same step as him was also a genius disciple of the Divine Medicine Valley. He had always thought that this person was his opponent.However.What was the situation now.\u201c???\u201d\u201cAm I f*cking seeing things!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cHow did this group of people catch up!\u201dThe people from the weapon sect kept rubbing their eyes, thinking that it was just an illusion. However, they actually passed by them.Crazy! Crazy!If it was just one person who surpassed them, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to accept.But it was all the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect!Your Xuan Sword sect is all monsters??Qi Ling and Yue Yao looked at each other, their eyes were full of shock.\u201cAre we geniuses?\u201d Yue Yao said in a daze.Qi Ling stuttered, \u201cI think so?\u201d\u201cBut how did the Xuan Sword sect surpass us?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe, probably, is an illusion?\u201dUntil all the disciples from the Xuan Sword sect surpassed them, these people still didn\u2019t come back to their senses. They stood at their spots in daze for a long time.Some of them even vomited blood because their faith were unstable.For what reason, they worked so hard, still being crushed by the Xuan Sword sect and they were even being blessed with external items.Not just being crushed by one, but by all!Could it be that the Xuan Sword sect didn\u2019t have any ordinary disciples?After the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect surpassed the others, they all let out a breath of resentment. They were so delighted that they were sweating all over.In the past, they didn\u2019t dare to fight against these geniuses. But now, with Elder Xuan\u2019s guidance, not only did they fight against them, but they crushed them!How satisfying!\u201cSenior brother, do you know that when I was passing Qi Ling just now, he was so shocked that his jaw almost fell off! This is one of the top geniuses in the weapon sect!\u201dThis senior brother reprimanded, \u201cElder Xuan guided us, definitely didn\u2019t want us to be proud, but instead, he wants us to learn from the experience and mature.\u201dHe was a little puzzled. Elder Xuan had taught them, but he did not say that they could not be proud!Seeing his confusion, the senior brother continued, \u201cElder Xuan knew that he could pass through this place easily, but why didn\u2019t he make a move at the entrance in the beginning?\u201dThe disciple\u2019s eyes flashed, \u201cI get it! Elder Xuan wants to use this behavior to tell us that there are always people better than us. We shouldn\u2019t be proud, or else, it will be ourselves who will lose face in the end, like those people behind us!\u201dThe senior brother nodded heavily, \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cI understand. Elder Xuan has put in a lot of effort for us!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: The appearance of Xuan YiChapter 52: The appearance of Xuan YiOutside the trial tower, the more everyone looked, the more shocked they became.\u201cCheating!\u201d\u201cThis is definitely cheating!\u201dThe Xuan Sword sect had already surpassed the people from the weapon sect and the Divine Medicine Valley.The Divine Medicine Valley and the weapon sect were also top notch in the entire southern region. How many years had it been since their Xuan Sword sect had produced a peerless genius? How could so many of them appear all at once?All of them were peerless geniuses?This was absolutely impossible!\u201c\u201dUp to now, what else do you Xuan Sword sect have to say! I suggest canceling the rank of Xuan Sword sect and capture all their disciples.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Does your Xuan Sword sect want to punish yourself or we help to punish? I think it will be enough to disable their cultivation, but leave them living.\u201d\u201cBut we can\u2019t let the elder leading the team live.\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s speed was already very amazing. Xuan Yi could be explained as a genius, but the disciples could not.Moreover, after seeing all the members of the Xuan Sword sect rushing through the tower, they had already concluded that Xuan Yi must have cheated too!Not only did he cheat, but he also taught his disciples how to cheat.Qing Xuzi lost his confidence for the moment. He could not think of a reason how his disciples could succeed.Could it really be cheating? And Xuan Yi was the one who took the lead to cheat!If that was the case, it would not be easy to deal with.Even though he was guessing in his heart, he still said stubbornly, \u201cHmph, whether it\u2019s cheating or not, we will know when they come out. If that is really the case, I, Qing Xuzi, will give everyone an explanation. But what if it\u2019s not cheating? I think you all are afraid that my Xuan Sword sect will reach the deepest and take away the holy items on the second floor!\u201dLi Changqing smiled and said, \u201cSince Sect Master Qing has said so, then there is no harm for us to wait for them to come out. I only hope that Sect Master Qing will not go back on his words and cover up his disciples!\u201dQing Xuzi was anxious and kept thinking of countermeasures, as he snorted coldly, \u201cLet\u2019s just wait and see!\u201d\u201cMy master will not cheat! We shall wait and see!\u201dEveryone ignored Wang Hu\u2019s words.Lin Jian was originally very disdainful of Xuan Yi, but he had entered the trial tower many times. It was impossible to cheat in there, especially on the second floor.There was almost no possibility of cheating. Then how could Xuan Yi be so fast, and even let the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect be so fast?He lazily got off the sedan chair and walked towards the stone tablet. He paid a little more attention to Xuan Yi\u2019s name.But only a little more attention.He was the number one on the ranking list of the stone tablet, Xuan Yi\u2026 perhaps was lucky enough to discover something that he did not notice, but no matter what, Xuan Yi was still an ant in his eyes. He was just an ant with a little bit of brain.\u2026Xuan Yi walked for a while, soon arrived not far away from He Huanyuan and the others through following the bloodstains. They had already walked nearly two hundred steps and had reached the second stage, where the gravity was ten times stronger than the first stage. Due to the blurry vision that Xuan Yi had, he could not see the circumstances in front of him. There were some changes in the second stage. There was not only one flight of steps. There were the spirit-cleansing steps, the body-forging path, and the spirit-soul path. The three paths corresponded to different directions of suppression.Of course, if they could walk out of these paths, it would be of great help to the challengers.Sensing Bai Weiwei\u2019s aura, Xuan Yi chose the spirit-washing path at the front and dived in.In the depths of the spirit-cleansing path, Bai Weiwei sprawled on the ground, not able to make a single move, even climbing was exceptionally difficult.Behind, Liu Mo and the others were no different. After their cultivation was suppressed, they could not even use their spirit weapons. They could only rely on gravity to continuously moving.\u201cHoo\u2026\u201d Liu Mo had countless bloody wounds on his skin. This was the characteristic of the spirit-cleansing path. As long as it was a living creature, entering this place would not only require gravity, but also there would be a lot of violent spiritual energy attacking the body.He looked at Bai Weiwei\u2019s body, a hint of greed flashed in his eyes.\u201cDamn it, if I had known earlier, I would have her as mine first before coming in!\u201dHe Huanyuan was disgusted. Under such circumstances, Liu Mo was still able to have such dirty thoughts, that could be seen what kind of person he was. However, she did not say much and stared at Bai Weiwei\u2019s back, \u201cShe has great perseverance, till now she has yet said anything about the map!\u201d\u201cDo you still need to think? It must be on the master.\u201dHe Huanyuan was a little worried because she saw a stubbornness in Bai Weiwei. The master of such a person must be even more powerful. Otherwise, one wouldn\u2019t be able to control this disciple. Liu Mo seemed to have guessed her worry and said casually, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Everyone here is the same, our cultivation level is almost at zero. There are so many of us, Bai Weiwei\u2019s master is only one person. As for the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect, I think they have been killed by Yin Yuan and his people.\u201dAfter Liu Mo\u2019s comfort, He Huanyuan felt much more relaxed.Liu Mo swallowed a mouthful of saliva and sized up Bai Weiwei\u2019s body. Her snow-white chest became irregular under the pressure of gravity. There were also many bloodstains on parts of her body where her snow-white skin was exposed, this gave Liu Mo a different kind of excitement.\u201cBai Weiwei, do you often let your master watch you like this? Seeing how you twist your body so skillfully, I\u2019m afraid you have been lingering with your master a lot!\u201d Liu Mo felt a wave of jealousy towards Bai Weiwei\u2019s master, Xuan Yi.Bai Weiwei\u2019s heart was suddenly filled with anger. It was fine to insult her innocence, or to humiliate her, but one should never insult her master.With the incomparable humiliation in her heart, she wanted to stand up, and then defended Master Xuan Yi, but due to gravity, she could only lie on the ground and endure Liu Mo\u2019s words.\u201cSenior brother, we made a deal. After we get out, we\u2019ll take the map first, then we\u2019ll play with her!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, after I\u2019m done, I will definitely not forget to let you guys have some fun too. Looking at this figure, it\u2019s really tempting.\u201d He licked his lips, the greed in his eyes was undisguised.Bai Weiwei was indeed beautiful. She had a miserly temperament wherever she went. Any man who had the desire to conquer, would be attracted to her. In addition to her sexy and tall figure, she had an unlimited imagination for men. At present, her clothes were wet with sweat and blood, sticking onto her, highlighting her tight body.\u201cDamn, I can\u2019t hold it in any longer.\u201dHe Huanyuan shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s finish the business at hand first. There is a holy item at the end of the second floor. Compared to the holy item, what is Bai Weiwei?\u201dAfter comparing Bai Weiwei with the holy item, Liu Mo chose the latter.He could have a woman anywhere, but the chance to get the holy item was rare.\u201cHow do we split the holy item after getting it?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll see who needs it the most. Then, the other party will give the holy item half of its value.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201dLiu Mo agreed, but in his heart, he did not want to split.Why should I share such a precious thing?Why shouldn\u2019t I take and keep it for myself?On the other hand, He Huanyuan thought the same too.At this moment, they heard a voice.\u201cWho is it that compared my disciple to the holy item?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: Holy ObjectsChapter 53: Holy ObjectsThe voice was distant.Everyone turned around and saw Xuan Yi standing there.He was dressed in a white robe and looked like an otherworldly immortal.The calmness in his eyes made him stood out to the extreme.Was Xuan Yi angry?He was furious when he saw Bai Weiwei, but he didn\u2019t show it.Even so, Bai Weiwei couldn\u2019t help but to cry when she saw Xuan Yi.Master had finally arrived!\u201cWho was it that compared my beloved disciple to those lifeless holy items?\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s aura surged, and the spirit-cleansing path exploded with a gust of strong wind.And after his cultivation recovered, the gravitational force attacked. Xuan Yi pushed against the boundless gravitational force and walked over step by step.\u201cDo you know, this is my beloved disciple.\u201d\u201cHow dare you humiliate her like this, have you thought about how you\u2019re going to die?\u201d\u201cShoo, shoo\u201dThe countless violent spiritual energies around him were like sharp swords. As Xuan Yi arrived in front of the disciples of the Myraid Beast Sect, the spiritual energies suddenly attacked and killed the person closest to him.A spiritual sword came out from his sleeve.In two breaths\u2019 time, other than He Huanyuan and Liu Mo, all the other disciples had died.The spiritual sword returned to his sleeve, and the scene was silent.\u201cHow can it be! How can you have cultivation!\u201dLiu Mo was extremely shocked. He simply couldn\u2019t figure out how Xuan Yi could get rid of the restrictions here.He Huanyuan was stunned on the spot, and she quickly reacted, \u201cThis fellow mate, all of this is a threat from Liu Mo. I have to help him, or else he will kill me!\u201dLiu Mo\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cYou!\u201d\u201cSwoosh!\u201dHe Huanyuan died.Liu Mo stared at the falling head and froze in place.He was not a coward. In this dangerous southern region, being timid would not allow one to live longer.However, no one was unafraid of death. Liu Mo was no exception. He was afraid of death like most people, but he had a high degree of choice and a strong ability to adapt. After a short moment of thought, he knelt on the ground with a thud, \u201cSir, let me go.\u201dXuan Yi did not look at him. He turned his body and walked towards Bai Weiwei. Before Liu Mo could get excited, a long sword flew past. His expression completely froze.\u201cWeiwei, are you alright?\u201dBai Weiwei forced herself to kneel on the ground, \u201cMaster.\u201dThen, Bai Weiwei burst into tears.\u201cI\u2019ll take you out.\u201dAlthough Xuan Yi\u2019s words did not have any emotional fluctuations, Bai Weiwei was still more excited and at ease.Xuan Yi threw her a pill and then sent her back to the Xuan Sword sect.After Xuan Yi left, Song Qingxin could not help looking at this woman. She was indeed good-looking, her figure was very good, and her temperament was also attractive to men. She looked at Bai Weiwei\u2019s chest, then at her own, and pouted.A few Xuan Sword sect disciples followed Xuan Yi\u2019s instructions to escort Bai Weiwei to the first floor. Xuan Yi did not wait for these disciples and went deeper into the second floor alone. His cultivation had just recovered, and he forcefully attacked, causing him to suffer some minor injuries. He should have recuperated first, but he felt a powerful aura on the second floor, which was very likely to be a holy item.Xuan Yi did not know that what he had just done had already caused an uproar in the outside world.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on! My sect\u2019s disciple, Liu Mo\u2019s life command token has no aura!\u201d Wang Ye. the master of Myraid Thousand sect, stared at the ranking on the stone tablet.\u201cEven his ranking has disappeared!\u201dThat being said, Liu Mo was already dead.The same went to the Tianzhen sect.\u201cWhat the hell is going on! Who killed my sect\u2019s genius!\u201d Li Changqing glared angrily. He knew very well that He Huanyuan had more than one trump card for her to escape, but none was used and she died right away.This was a genius that the sect had spent a lot of effort to nurture.\u201cIt must be your Xuan Sword sect. Just when Xuan Yi reached their ranking, they died one after another!\u201d\u201cNot only did your Xuan Sword sect cheat, but you also killed the genius that we worked so hard to nurture!\u201d.Qing Xuzi felt more and more that his brain was not enough. There were so many changes in this trial that his brain couldn\u2019t keep up directly.However, he was good at sophistry, \u201cWhy do you say that it was our sect who killed them? If that\u2019s the case, could it be that the cultivators who died in the southern region were all killed by our Xuan Sword sect?\u201d\u201cThe second floor of the trial tower has been suppressed to the realm of a mortal. It\u2019s a competition of physical strength. For your Xuan Sword sect to catch up with them so quickly, they must have cheated to recover their cultivation.\u201dQing Xuzi could not withstand the group attack, he kept silent with a gloomy face, allowing them to insult him. However, a wave of displeasure rose in his heart against Xuan Yi. He already believed that Xuan Yi had cheated.Otherwise, there was no way to explain this situation.Seeing that Qing Xuzi was no longer quibbling, everyone was even more certain that Xuan Yi had cheated.\u201cThe elder of the Xuan Sword sect took the lead to cheat. This has really broadened the horizons of our evil sect.\u201d\u201cYou guys are really interesting!\u201dLin Jian said lazily as he walked in front of everyone.His words made everyone feel puzzled.Interesting?You were not the one who was cheated. No, according to this situation, it was only a matter of time before Lin Jian was surpassed.\u201cLin Jian, what do you mean by this?\u201d\u201cIt means that you guys are too stupid.\u201dThe entire place was in an uproar. Each of them was extremely angry, but because of Lin Jian\u2019s identity, they were forced not to fight.Lin Jian was silent for three breaths before he slowly said, \u201cFor a secret realm like the trial tower, let alone an elder, even someone of our standard must follow the rules of the trial tower. What are you guys thinking? Everyone can cheat in the trial tower?\u201dLi Changqing said unwillingly, \u201cWho knows what Xuan Yi did in there? His mysteriousness is something even his sect master can\u2019t understand!\u201d\u201cHahaha, what a joke. No matter how mysterious a person is, can he be stronger than the sage? As far as I know, none of the seniors who created this secret realm have the means to cheat in the trial tower.\u201d Lin Jian stood in front of the stone tablet.Cheat?If it was a sage level expert, he would probably believe it. However, a magic realm elder was not enough to cheat in this place.The trial tower was passed down from ancient times. How could anyone cheat in it.Especially after Lin Jian had experienced the terror of the trial tower many times, he did not believe that anyone could cheat in it. It was possible to just violate the rules, and one would be kicked out of the trial tower, even if it did not reach the stage of being kicked out, one would still be whipped by the lightning of the trial tower.In the trial tower, when he could not hold on anymore, he was tempted to cheat. However, without exception, all of them were discovered by the trial tower and directly brought up.And these people from the different sects actually said that he was cheating. From this, one could see their ignorance.At this point, Lin Jian had already begun to look forward to Xuan Yi\u2019s appearance, because Xuan Yi had definitely discovered the things that he had overlooked in the trial tower.And the thing that he had overlooked might be the key to entering the third floor.No one questioned Lin Jian\u2019s words. After all, he had entered many times and had absolute right to speak. However, not many people believed him. They were all waiting. As long as the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect came out, everything would be clear.When the time arrived, even if the sages and powerful were present, they could not prove that the Xuan Sword sect had not cheated!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: 54In the trial tower, Xuan Yi quickly arrived at the end of the second floor. As expected, there was a key flashing.The key was emitting a red light. Xuan Yi could feel an intense aura from within.This was clearly the holy item that Xuan Yi had been sensing. What kind of existence did a holy item have? If it was thrown into the southern region, it would be an existence that many people would fight over. Even the various large sects might not have many holy items. And now, there was one floating in front of Xuan Yi, from the aura that this holy item emitted, it was most likely not a low-grade holy item.However, under normal circumstances, a holy item would carry a powerful offensive aura, and it would be very difficult for ordinary people to obtain it. This was because some holy items were so old that they were almost sentient.However, this holy item did not have any sentient aura, let alone offensive power. There was only one possibility for such a holy item, and that was a consumable type holy item.Xuan Yi walked forward and used his spiritual sense to probe it. He discovered that it was a key.\u201cAs expected.\u201dBut what was the use of this key?There was a door behind the holy item. Xuan Yi thought for a moment, then took the holy item down and inserted it into the door.Rumble. With a series of explosions, the door slowly opened.\u201cThe third floor.\u201dIt was not that Lin Jian had never come to the end of the second floor, but he always brazenly and recklessly entered. He did not dissipate his cultivation like Xuan Yi did. Moreover, every time he only felt the aura of the holy item, he had never seen a holy item before.If Lin Jian were here, he would definitely be shocked speechlessly.Because the appearance of the holy item depended on whether the method of the challenger was correct.Once the method was wrong, then it did not matter whether one could walk to the end, the holy item would not appear.If Lin Jian knew that it was so easy to enter the third floor that he had been longing for, he would probably vomit blood out of anger.After all, he had been challenging the trial tower for many years, but he ended up failing every time.At the entrance of the third floor, a terrifying aura came upfront.Xuan Yi only felt that there was an unshakable thing standing in front of him.It was like the entire world, and more like all the rules.\u201cThis aura!\u201d\u201cSo terrifying!\u201dXuan Yi had never felt such an oppressive feeling in front of those sect masters and experts.In other words, even the powerful cultivators had to submit to the thing on the third floor?Could it be the sage?!Xuan Yi had only heard of the sage cultivators in legends. In reality, even expert cultivators were rarely seen, let alone sage cultivators who were even more powerful than the expert cultivators.The third floor was a large hall, with inflammation flowing on the ground.The magma gathered on the ground from all directions. It was curved and orderly, but it was not the pattern of the formation. It was like a ghost drawing a talisman. At first glance, there was nothing strange about it, but after Xuan Yi took a closer look, he found that it contained an extremely terrifying taoism intent, but this was not all. The most terrifying thing was that Xuan Yi felt an aura of the law of heaven and earth in it, the taoism intent was like nine iron chains that tightly bound this wisp of the laws of heaven and earth.And in the center of this irregular flowing magma, there was a table and two chairs.Xuan Yi was slightly shocked, because these table and chairs were holy items.The key to open the door was a holy item, even the table and chairs were holy items!What a place for a terrifying expert!On the table, there was a chessboard.This chessboard was also a holy item, and it had an even more powerful aura than a normal holy item.After Xuan Yi was shocked, he quickly came to his senses.He walked forward and slowly sat on the edge of the chessboard.If he guessed correctly, this should be where the spiritual sense of the entire trial tower was located.After many years of settling down, it was not difficult to understand that the trial tower had a spiritual sense. It seemed that if one wanted to obtain the third floor of the trial tower\u2019s treasure, one only needed to win this game.And Xuan Yi\u2019s opponent should be the spiritual sense of the trial tower. Xuan Yi thought so. Otherwise, there was no one here, so who would place a game of chess here.At the entrance of the third floor, a group of Xuan Sword sect disciples stood.When they stepped out of the second floor, the cultivation that had dispersed earlier was like a bird returning to its nest, all returned to them.\u201cElder Xuan didn\u2019t lie to us! Elder Xuan really didn\u2019t lie to us!\u201d\u201cMy cultivation has returned!\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d A disciple was overjoyed. \u201cNot only has my cultivation returned, my strength has also improved a lot!\u201dAt this moment, the aura of a disciple beside him soared. In just three breaths, he said with an excited expression, \u201cI broke through! I broke through! I\u2019ve been stuck at a bottleneck for three years. I\u2019ve finally broken through!\u201dAll thanks to Elder Xuan. Now, they no longer simply admired Xuan Yi. They idolized, respected, and even worshipped him.Why? Because cultivation was originally a tough training. There might not be many people who could reach a high position. Then, there came a person who could allow you to reduce your tough training, but gain more strength or cultivation!How could this not be exciting? It could be said that even if they did not obtain any treasures this time, the surge in their cultivation was already worth it!\u201cElder Xuan is like a great emperor!\u201dIt was rumored that the Heavenly Emperor was an imperial tutor in the ancient times. The worst disciples under him were all sages. The disciples he taught were all top-notch existences in the continent.This disciple compared Xuan Yi to the Heavenly Emperor. Naturally, it was a lot of exaggeration. However, no one refuted him because Xuan Yi was still young.The Heavenly Emperor had taught for many years before he pushed his disciples to the peak of the continent. However, Bai Weiwei had only learned from Xuan Yi for a short period of time. It was not an exaggeration to say that she had improved very quickly. One had to know that Bai Weiwei was a piece of trash before this!\u201cPerhaps, given Elder Xuan some time, it\u2019s not impossible for him to surpass the Heavenly Emperor!\u201dEveryone was shocked by the words.An ancient god like the Heavenly Emperor was a legendary existence.Elder Xuan was able to reach the level of a legend created by an ancient god?!The disciple seemed to realize that his words were too exaggerated, so he smiled sheepishly and waved his hand. \u201cI\u2019m just joking. Let\u2019s enter the third floor first!\u201dThey had some understanding of the first two floors of the trial tower, but no one had ever entered the third floor. No one had ever entered for thousands of years.At this moment, the door to the third floor was right in front of them.Needless to say, it must have been opened by Elder Xuan!This made many disciples feel some anticipation for what they had just said.If Elder Xuan could unlock the third floor that no one had been able to for thousands of years, could it be possible for him to reach the level of the ancient god Heavenly Emperor?They were all shocked by the guess in their hearts and repeatedly denied it.\u201cCan you all feel it?\u201dStanding behind the door, they were trembling all over. They stared at the door as if they were staring at a ferocious beast.Terrifying.Suffocating.There was also that kind of strength that they couldn\u2019t fight against at all!One had to know that at this moment, they had already recovered their cultivation and the suppression had disappeared.Even though they had recovered their cultivation, they still felt an invincible aura in front of the door.If this aura attacked them, they had no chance to escape.\u201cIs this the deepest part of the trial tower?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: 55Chapter 55: The TruthJust the aura alone was enough to suffocate them.If they went in, wouldn\u2019t they be crushed?Some of the disciples wanted to retreat, but when they thought about how no one had been able to enter the third floor for thousands of years, they held back their thoughts.\u2026In front of the stone tablet.The old monsters all felt a strong aura.However, they didn\u2019t know where this aura came from.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on!\u201dCountless spiritual senses swept over, but no one\u2019s spiritual sense could enter the trial tower. Some weaker cultivators were treated as having their spiritual senses injured.\u201cIt\u2019s changed!\u201d\u201cQuick, look at the ranking of the stone tablet!\u201dWhen everyone heard the voice, they looked over and found that Lin Jian, who was originally ranked first on the stone tablet, had been pushed down. It had become Xuan Yi\u2019s name!The crowd gasped in shock. Even Lin Jian\u2019s breathing become much heavier.The first place that had dominated the list for years had been replaced!Countless people looked at Lin Jian. This was because he had just said that Xuan Yi did not have the ability to cheat in the trial tower.If what he had said was true, then didn\u2019t that mean that Xuan Yi had used his strength to push him down!The first place on the stone tablet, not to mention the southern region, was not a small achievement even in the entire continent!At this moment, Lin Jian\u2019s limelight was stolen away. He looked as if like a deflated rubber ball. He stood rooted to the ground, unable to speak for a long time.Following that, a wave of hostility rose in his heart, hostility towards Xuan Yi.There was only one way for him to regain his stolen limelight, and that was to defeat Xuan Yi!At this moment, a few disciples walked out of the trial tower.These disciples were asked by Xuan Yi to protect Bai Weiwei. However, after the third floor opened, the entire trial tower shook non-stop. They were worried that something might happen, so they brought Bai Weiwei out of the trial tower.And the trial tower was the only transit point in the entire saint\u2019s mystic realm that connected to the outside world.After entering the trial tower and coming out, they would be outside the mystic realm.\u201cThose are the disciples from the Xuan Sword sect!\u201dAfter Li Changqing discovered them, he stepped out of the formation ripples. In the next moment, a black hole appeared beside these disciples. A pair of hands reached out from the black hole and grabbed them all in.When they reacted, they were all stunned on the spot.They were surrounded by experts with terrifying auras. Of course, this was not the main reason why they were frozen on the spot.This was because the gazes of these experts were locked onto them. It was as if they were chained to the spot, unable to move.\u201cLet me ask you, how did the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect move so quickly on the second floor?\u201d The mixed-blood qilin under Wang Ye roared, scaring the few of them so much that they trembled. Let alone the experts of the different sects, they could not even defeat the pets of these experts.And if it was the ancient divine beast qilin, just a drop of blood could easily make the sage submit.The few disciples looked at Qing Xuzi as if they had grabbed onto a life-saving straw. They kept begging with their eyes. At this moment, they had no idea what had happened and why these experts were targeting them.Qing Xuzi\u2019s face darkened. He had wanted to help, but under the gazes of so many experts, it was hard him to protect them at all. He could only say, \u201cTell us what happened inside.\u201dWang Ye added, \u201cIf you dare to lie, I\u2019ll feed you all to the beasts!\u201dThe few disciples were so scared that they couldn\u2019t speak.At this time, Bai Weiwei stood up and told them what had happened inside, but she didn\u2019t mention about their speed.\u201cI\u2019m asking you, why are you all improving so fast!\u201dA disciple stood up and said with a trembling voice, \u201cIt was Elder Xuan who taught us.\u201dThe moment these words were said, the entire place was in an uproar.\u201cHmph! As expected!\u201d\u201cSect Master Qing, what else do you have to say!\u201dQing Xuzi\u2019s face alternated between red and white. It was confirmed that they were cheating. Not only was Xuan Yi\u2019s safety at stake, even the entire Xuan Sword sect would be criticized.\u201cB*stards, how did Xuan Yi teach you all!\u201d Qing Xuzi had no way to defend himself, so he had to choose the dumbest way, to stall!If nothing could be think of, then stalled until something was being popped out.Lin Jian was also very puzzled. Since the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect had admitted to cheating, but he could not think of a way to cheat, \u201cHow did your Elder Xuan teach you?\u201dThe disciple lowered his head, \u201cHe told us to disperse our cultivation, saying that the second floor was not only willpower, but also determination and courage.\u201dThe experts were stunned.Disperse their cultivation!?What did the cultivators spend their whole lives for? The answer was cultivation.It could be said that cultivation was as important as the lives of the cultivators.\u201cAnd you all followed his words?\u201d\u201cYes, then we moved very quickly as we were on the second floor of the trial tower. We could obviously feel the improvement of our physical bodies. Our bodies were a lot more solid.\u201dThe scene went silent.It was already very terrifying to lose their cultivation, but Xuan Yi actually told all the disciples to lose their cultivation!What was even more unacceptable was that they actually listened and did it!Suddenly, an elder from the Myraid Beast sect asked, \u201cThen why do your cultivation still exist?\u201dThe disciple explained, \u201cElder Xuan originally said that when we reached the end of the second floor, our cultivation would automatically recover. But in order to send senior sister Bai Weiwei out, we didn\u2019t go to the second floor. When we returned to the first floor, our cultivation returned.\u201dHe thought for a moment and said, \u201cI think that Elder Xuan was worried about us retreating, so he told us that as long as we reached the end, our cultivation would recover. In fact, we can also recover if we leave.\u201dSpeaking of this, he felt more and more that Elder Xuan was well-intentioned, was there any master in the world who was so considerate of his disciples?These words came out of his mouth calmly, but in the ears of this group of experts, it was as shocking as a raging wave!In other words, it was very likely that Xuan Yi did not cheat, but indeed mastered the real rules, and used them to create a scene where all the members of the Xuan Sword sect rose rapidly!The entire place was in an uproar.He actually did not cheat!Lin Jian also came to a realization at this moment. He finally understood why he had not unlocked the third floor after entering the trial tower so many times. It turned out that he had been using the stupidest method, but in reality, it was not the case.Did that mean that Xuan Yi had already opened the third floor!Lin Jian\u2019s breathing became short.He no longer cared whether Xuan Yi had cheated or not. What he cared about was the treasure on the third floor!\u201cThat being said, Xuan Yi did not cheat!?\u201dQing Xuzi was flushed red, \u201cHmph! My disciples can never do such a despicable thing! Everyone please, don\u2019t throw dirty water on our Xuan Sword sect!\u201d\u201cBut, Xua Yi has killed the disciples from the Myraid Beast sect and Tianzhen sect, how are you going to deal with this matter?\u201d\u201cHow are we going to deal with this matter? We\u2019re not going to deal with it! Everyone, don\u2019t forget that it was those two sects who first held my disciples hostage! And Xuanyi, only wanted to help the disciples. Is there anything wrong with that?\u201d\u201cHmph! Right now, only your disciples of the Xuan Sword sect are still alive. It\u2019s hard to say what things are like!\u201dThe atmosphere was heated. Suddenly, Lin Jian\u2019s words drew everyone\u2019s attention back.\u201cEveryone, I think now is not the time to argue about this. Xuan Yi has entered the third floor.\u201dAlthough everyone did not know what exactly was on the third floor, it was undeniable that there were extremely holy treasures.Imperial class inheritance!It was also possible to exist!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: 56Chapter 56: Gathering at the entranceAt the thought of this, their breathing quickened. Although their age and strength had already passed the most suitable period for the imperial class inheritance, they still had disciples. If they obtained the imperial class inheritance and passed on to their disciples, then another monstrous genius would appear in the southern region. At the very least, none would not be lower than Lin Jian\u2019s standard!The Myraid Beast sect and the Tianzhen sect originally wanted the Xuan Sword sect to give them an explanation. However, when they saw that everyone\u2019s attention was no longer on them, they forced themselves to endure it. These disciples who had died were all geniuses that the sects had painstakingly nurtured, and if one died, there would be one less. The average strength of the sect would be slightly weaker. In such a situation, how could they treat it as if nothing had happened? Li Changqing and Wang Ye looked at each other and saw a trace of coldness in each other\u2019s eyes.As for the experts of the other sects, they did not hide the greed in their eyes at all. They each took out their own spirit weapons and quickly rushed into the trial tower.The one leading was Lin Jian. As Lin Jian was too familiar with the trial tower, he almost rushed into the first level with a shot.Qing Xuzi instructed the elder behind him, \u201cRemember, protect Xuan Yi after you enter. The treasure must be with him. We can\u2019t let the other sects get first.\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201dThe trial tower was located in the saint mystic realm, but it was not affected by the rules of the saint mystic realm.Originally, these masters and experts were not allowed to enter. The opening of the saint mystic realm was only for the disciples to undergo trials. Other than the elder leading the team, cultivators above the golden elixir phase were not allowed to participate. This was the rule set by many sects in the southern region, even Lin Jian waited for the disciples from the sects to come out before entering the tower.But now, everyone had violated the rules that they had set themselves, the appeal of the imperial class inheritance was too great. The treasures on the third floor were like naked women, and they were the perverts who had not touched a woman for decades.The disciples of the Xuan Sword sect were stunned on the spot.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this group of terrifying big shots?\u201dBai Weiwei frowned, \u201cMaster is in danger.\u201dWith that, the group of people rushed back again.This time, the group of disciples did not retreat. Xuan Yi had completely brought them into submission in the trial tower.When they heard that Elder Xuan was in danger, they rushed back without hesitation.However, their speed was obviously not as fast as the experts of the major sects. When they arrived at the entrance of the trial tower, the group of people had already disappeared.\u2026On the third floor, when the group of Xuan Sword sect disciples arrived, they were suffocated by the pressure inside.\u201cLook, Elder Xuan is inside.\u201dIn the center of the hall, Xuan Yi was sitting in front of a stone table, closing his eyes, resting.He knew that this opponent would be a very powerful existence.This game was equivalent to a killing.These disciples didn\u2019t attract Xuan Yi\u2019s attention when they came here.\u201cElder Xuan is going to play the chess?\u201d\u201cIt seems so.\u201d\u201cBut, no one is here. Who is he playing with?\u201dOne of the disciples wanted to walk in, but found that he was blocked by a layer of restriction. Seeing this, he hurriedly told the other disciples.In the end, they found that they were all blocked outside.They could only watch Xuan Yi from afar in the center of the magma.\u201cFortunately, we are only outside. If there is no restriction, if we walk in directly, I\u2019m afraid we will be crushed by this terrifying pressure.\u201dAs they thought of this, they were extremely amazed at Xuan Yi\u2019s strength.Was this really just a law enforcer?Looking at his indifferent appearance, even some sect masters did not have such an aura.\u201cElder Xuan, his strength is unfathomable!\u201d\u201cWho exactly is he playing chess with?\u201dThey were extremely depressed and could only wait quietly outside. If they guessed correctly, only Xuan Yi could win this game, then the treasures inside would be obtained by Xuan Yi.They no longer hoped that they could obtain the treasures. After all, the first two levels had already given them a bountiful harvest.At this moment, they were all looking at Xuan Yi with extreme seriousness. They rarely saw Xuan Yi make a move. However, almost every time he made a move, he could let them learn something, without doubt, this time too. Every gaze was fixed on Xuan Yi, afraid of missing out every move he made.Just when they were thinking about who was Xuan Yi\u2019s chess opponent, the people from the Divine Medicine Valley and the weapon sect arrived.However, their appearance was somewhat miserable. Moreover, with their use of time, they could only get into the top fifty of the stone tablet ranking.For this, they had also paid a great price. When they saw the people from the Xuan Sword sect, they all lowered their heads.It was originally an insignificant sect, but it had directly crushed them. How could they be proud of this.However, what they didn\u2019t know was that the reason why the disciples of theXuan Sword sect could crush them was because of Xuan Yi, who was sitting in the middle of the third floor.\u201cThis person is an elder of the Xuan Sword sect, right?\u201d\u201cJudging from his clothes, he should be.\u201d\u201cWhat is he doing? Who is he playing chess with?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. It looks like he is about to play the chess, but there is no one on the other side. Could it be that he is playing chess with air?\u201dThe disciples of the two sects discussed animatedly. When they realized that they could not enter, they wanted to break through forcefully. In the end, one of the disciples was hit by the restriction and was seriously injured. This time, they became obedient and stood outside the restriction like the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect.At the entrance of the second floor, a group of old monsters stopped. Everything was smooth-sailing until now, the second floor was different. Here, their cultivation were all suppressed to the level of mortals.If they walked in, it would probably be as difficult as for those disciples. Of course, with their strength, they would definitely be much faster than the disciples.However, with such speed, Xuan Yi would have already taken away the treasures on the third floor. Moreover, if their speed was not as fast as the disciples, the ranking on the stone tablet would show, how would they teach their disciples in the future?Just as they were hesitating, they suddenly remembered what the disciples of the Xuan Sword sect had said earlier.If they dispersed all their cultivation, it would be as if they were walking on flat ground.They were very tempted, but they did not dare to gamble.At this moment, Lin Jian stood out and said with an evil smile, \u201cIndecisive, how can you walk on the path of immortal cultivation for a long time?\u201dWith that, his aura plummeted. In less than three breaths\u2019 time, all the cultivation in his body had dissipated, and he had truly become a mortal.He walked in step by step, and indeed, there was nothing unusual.This time, the cultivators from the major sects began to follow suit.As expected, after becoming mortals, they really felt like they were walking on flat ground. They only felt a little pressure on their shoulders.Soon, the group of people rushed to the entrance of the third floor.The third floor had the view of the second floor. A disciple on the third floor inadvertently saw the group of people rushing over, so he repeatedly let the others watch.\u201cIndeed, the elders of our weapon sect, look at their speed!\u201d\u201cRun! They are running! The elders of our Divine Medicine Valley are not inferior to your weapon sect.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: 57There were also some disciples from other sects who had found their sect elders and sect masters in the crowd.Originally, other than the elders who led the group, the sect masters and elders would usually not interfere. At most, they would only look at the rankings at the entrance.They had vaguely guessed the purpose of their sect\u2019s experts coming here.Of course, what made them most excited was that their sect\u2019s seniors were actually so terrifying. They knew better than anyone else how terrifying the second floor was. However, this group of elders and seniors could actually walk at such a speed. It was simply awesome!And when those experts saw the disciples\u2019 envious gazes, they also understood why.But in reality, having such speeds was not their piece of work. Instead, they had plagiarized Xuan Yi\u2019s method.At this moment, they had already deeply understood that this test was not just about willpower.And Xuan Yi\u2019s method was the real way to pass the test.After coming to the third floor, all their scattered cultivation returned. This time, they were even more convinced that this was the real way to pass the test. Disciples below the golden elixir phase could gain a lot from this.Looking at the disciples\u2019 envious gazes, their faces turned red.However, they did not explain anything and allowed the disciples to misunderstand.\u201cElder!\u201d\u201cSect master!\u201dThe disciples bowed one after another and stood behind their respective sects.After this group of people came to the third floor, they immediately noticed Xuan Yi sitting in front of the chessboard.Lin Jian\u2019s envious gaze flashed. He was attracted by the aura inside.\u201cThe aura of the heaven!\u201dOther than Lin Jian, the others were similarly shocked.They were a group of old monsters who had cultivated for numerous years. Among them, some even had experienced many tribulations.And here, they felt a familiar aura.That was the aura of the lightning tribulation, or to put it another way, the aura of the Heaven.Every cultivator who had experienced the lightning tribulation could feel a trace of this aura. If they could feel the law of the heaven from it, it would be a powerful upgrade for those who were undergoing the tribulation. It would also be of great help to those who would ascend to immortality in the future.However, that was only a trace, and this place was very dense.They couldn\u2019t help but look inside the restriction, and they had a guess. Moreover, they were all shocked by the guess in their hearts.Could it be that this was the heaven!The heaven was a supreme rule that controlled the life and death of the entire continent.Many cultivators would swear on the heaven when they were forced to gamble their lives. If these cultivators didn\u2019t abide by the oath, the heaven would send down lightning tribulation to take their lives.In other words, the heaven was the most powerful rule in the world. Even immortals had to abide by this rule.In this place, the rich aura of the heaven shocked them all.\u201cCould it be that Xuan Yi \u2018s chess opponent is the heaven?\u201dThese words shocked everyone!The heaven.These two words represented infinite control.Playing chess with the heaven would be a terrifying thing!They didn\u2019t even dare to think about it.And now, Elder Xuan was sitting quietly and waiting.The eyes of the experts focused, especially Lin Jian. He drew out his natal spirit sword and was about to break the restriction. In an instant, wind and sand flew wildly. The disciples on the third floor all felt an intense sword energy.\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t sword energy! This is the consciousness of the sword!\u201dThe pitch-black sword condensed an infinite and violent power. The elders didn\u2019t dare to guarantee whether they could dodge this sword full of sword consciousness.Terrifying!Was this the strength of a half-step sect master?Many disciples believed that this sword could easily split open a huge mountain.However, even though he had already reached the half-step sect master phase and even a sect master expert had to retreat from this sword, when it hit the restriction, it was like a drop of water hanging in the ocean and did not cause the slightest ripple.In the next breath, the restriction suddenly rebounded and a powerful attack was sent directly into his body. Lin Jian was blown hundreds of feet away on the spot.His body, which he was proud of, could almost withstand ordinary attacks of the same standard, and it was full of holes.It directly beat him into a serious injury.He stood up, full of unwillingness, but he didn\u2019t rush up. He took a precious pill and slowly repaired his body.After Lin Jian being attacked, the group of masters and experts from the different sects also suppressed their desire to forcefully break the restriction.That was an existence at the half-step sect master expert phase, yet he was seriously injured by the backlash. Many of them hadn\u2019t reached the half-step sect master expert phase. Of course, there were also some experts who had reached the sect master phase, such as the sect master of the Yin Corpse sect. However, he was very clear that, even he himself was unable to break the restriction.Suddenly.A change occurred in the arena.A terrifying aura was emitted from within the restriction.\u201cSnapped\u201dA white chess piece was held by an invisible hand and flew onto the chessboard.\u201cIt\u2019s here!\u201dXuan Yi opened his eyes and a bright light shot out.He held the chess piece and slowly placed it down.The chess piece stirred up a cloud of dust.Immediately after, the formless hand placed another piece down.Xuan Yi frowned slightly.Xuan Yi did not know who was playing the chess with him and thought it was the spiritual sense of the trial tower. However, this move was filled with dominance.\u201cYou want to control the whole game?\u201dXuan Yi curled the corner of his mouth slightly and put down the white chess piece.The people outside the restriction held their breaths. This was the consciousness of the heaven, and Xuan Yi was playing this way.Was he going to fight head-on with the heaven?Could it be that he did not know the terror of the heaven? He was seeking his own death!Playing chess against the heaven, one could comprehend a trace of the energy of the heaven in any case. It would be of great help to one\u2019s future ascension.If it was a defensive stance, one could live longer. However, Xuan Yi\u2019s actions were clearly going to clash head-on with the heaven.The experts were extremely shocked.Xuan Yi, was he crazy?In the arena, the formless hand seemed to be extremely surprised. It paused for a second before flying over with an even sharper aura.\u201cThis kid is really want to die. He angered the heaven and will die without even knowing how!\u201dXuan Yi stared at the chessboard with a strange expression.It seemed like the trial tower\u2019s spiritual sense had a bad temper.Just one move against and there came an even fiercer attack.Did the little trial tower\u2019s spiritual sense want to defy the heaven?Xuan Yi continued to play, but his moves were getting pressurising.Every time Xuan Yi took a step, everyone outside the restriction became nervous.Because Xuan Yi didn\u2019t defend at all, all the chess pieces were used to attack the heaven!That was very arrogant.This was the heaven. Weren\u2019t you afraid that the heaven would be furious and send down a lightning tribulation to strike you into pieces?Of course, Xuan Yi didn\u2019t know who Bai Zi was.And after playing for so long, there was still no winner.Thud.Xuan Yi threw the chess piece on the chessboard.He slowly stood up.\u201cDid Elder Xuan lose?\u201dA disciple said slowly.\u201cThis kid finally lost!\u201d\u201cI was worried that he would anger the heaven.\u201dAt this time, the Yin corpse sect master who was quite proficient in chess slowly shouted, \u201cWait!\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t lose.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: 58Chapter 58: Imperial level inheritance\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Li Changqing asked in confusion.\u201cLook, it looks like Xuan Yi is at a disadvantage in the chess game. He\u2019ll be defeated in just two moves, but if he place his chess piece there\u2026\u201dHe pointed forward as he spoke.Everyone immediately reacted.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t lost yet!\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then the outcome is uncertain!\u201d Qing Xuzi stroked his beard.Xuan Yi had already stood up. No one knew whether he would win or lose.However, what happened next shocked them.The chessboard collapsed. Under the chessboard, the entire trial tower shook continuously.Soon, a dazzling light flashed out and shot out from the place where the chessboard collapsed.\u201cThis is the aura of a holy item!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! This is the aura of a holy item.\u201dThis group of old monsters were still able to restrain themselves, but they quickly realized that this wasn\u2019t just the aura of a holy item.\u201cWait, does a holy item have such a terrifying aura?\u201dWhoosh!The trial tower shook non-stop, and everyone couldn\u2019t stand steadily. A wave of thick smoke rose.\u201cThis is poisonous smoke!\u201dThe group of masters and experts from the various sects took out their weapons and began to resist the poisonous smoke.The poisonous smoke came and went off quickly, and soon, it was almost gone.Some people were lying on the ground, and some were standing, but without exception, they were all poisoned.However, this poison was not too fierce. As long as they did not use their spiritual power, it would not accelerate the time for the poison to take effect.\u201cWho put the poison in!\u201d\u201cIt was the trial tower itself,\u201d Li Changqing said leisurely.As the poison smoke dispersed, the treasure was exposed in everyone\u2019s sight.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cThe imperial class inheritance!\u201dAt first, they thought it was just a holy item, but they never thought that there was really an imperial class inheritance!One had to know that this item was a legendary existence. It was something that even a sage expert would be jealous of.Only with this inheritance, for such a long time, it was almost equivalent to an expert way above the sect master expert phase.Even if a mortal obtained this inheritance, he could still reach the sect master expert phase, which was the lowest!How could such a thing not make people jealous.However, they were currently poisoned. It would be fine if they didn\u2019t use their spiritual power, but once they used it, it would speed up the poison effect.\u201cDamn it, why did the trial tower suddenly release the poison!\u201dThey watched helplessly as Xuan Yi put the armor-like imperial class inheritance into his bag.Then, Xuan Yi slowly walked out.This caused countless people\u2019s eyes to turn red, but there was nothing they could do.Unless they did not want their lives, they could only watch as Xuan Yi took the treasure away.At this time, Bai Weiwei, Wang Hu, and the others also arrived.Lin Jian was very angry. Not only was he the first to be defeated by Xuan Yi, even the imperial class inheritance was stolen, and the disciple he fancied was also Xuan Yi\u2019s. How could he not be angry.Hence, Lin Jian stood up and pointed his sword at Xuan Yi, \u201cXuan Yi, I want to challenge you!\u201dXuan Yi glanced at him and said lazily, \u201cI don\u2019t have the time.\u201dThey were already poisoned. Xuan Yi did not have the intention to fight them. If he won, it would not be a pure victory. Furthermore, Xuan Yi really did not have the time to fight him.Lin Jian\u2019s face darkened. \u201cIt\u2019s fine even if you don\u2019t fight. Then, which disciple of yours will you give to me?\u201d\u201cWhich disciple?\u201d Xuan Yi was a little puzzled. Could it be Bai Weiwei?But no matter who it was, Xuan Yi had no intention of giving to Lin Jian.Instead, it was Lin Jian who actually wanted to snatch his disciple away from him.\u201cWang Hu, give him to me.\u201dXuan Yi shook his head. It was another person who treated his disciple as an item. He said calmly, \u201cSince you want what you want, then come and snatch.\u201d\u201cMaster, we are late. Please punish us!\u201dXuan Yi gestured for them to stand up. Then, he looked at his disciple with the worst talent, Wang Hu.This disciple had been taken in for a long time. However, because his talent was really bad, mainly because he had yet opened up the potential in his body, his cultivation had not made any significant progress.\u201cTake this thing and cultivate well.\u201dXuan Yi casually threw the imperial class inheritance away.This scene simply shocked everyone present.\u201cThis\u2026 This is an imperial class inheritance!\u201d\u201cHiss\u2026\u201d\u201cHe gave it away just like that, as if he was giving away cabbages!\u201d\u201cThe main point is that he actually gave it to his disciple with the worst talent. If this was given to Senior sister Wei Wei, I\u2019m afraid that it wouldn\u2019t take long for a sect master expert to appear!\u201dHearing the surrounding voices, Wang Hu half knelt on the ground, not daring to receive the armor that Xuan Yi handed over.This was the imperial class inheritance, this terrifying aura.Wang Hu\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t move away, but he still didn\u2019t accept it.He suddenly thought of the past scenes.\u2026\u201cAre you willing to be my disciple?\u201d\u201cDisciple Wang Hu greets Master!\u201d\u2026\u201cSuch trash is still staying in the Xuan Sword sect. I wonder who his master is and how he managed to produce such a trash disciple.\u201d\u201cQuick, let\u2019s stay far away from such trash so that we won\u2019t be stuck with the aura of trash!\u201d\u2026\u201cDisciple, your talent is indeed bad, but with enough effort, you can still reach a level that many people have never reached. Don\u2019t let those words make you lose your faith.\u201d\u201cMaster, I understand!\u201d\u2026\u201cTrash, get out of the Xuan Sword sect!\u201d\u201cHurry up and stop embarrassing your master!\u201d\u201cSomeone like you won\u2019t be able to reach the foundation phase in your entire life. You should just stay as a mortal!\u201d\u2026Scenes flashed through his mind quickly, and finally settled on Xuan Yi.Xuan Yi had never given up on him.With his talent, he would have been expelled from the Xuan Sword sect a long time ago. But now, not only did that not happen, his status was also gradually rising.Slowly, he became respected by others. All of this was given to him by Xuan Yi.And now, not only that, even the imperial class inheritance had to be given to him!If this was said that he was Xuan Yi\u2019s illegitimate child, many people would believe it.Wang Hu was touched, but he was a person who did not know how to express himself. He trembled as he received the imperial class inheritance. Wang Hu kowtowed and thanked him.\u201cDon\u2019t ever be arrogant and complacent.\u201d\u201cThank you, Master, for your teachings. I will remember it in my heart!\u201dWang Hu held back his tears and kowtowed again.Xuan Yi glanced at Lin Jian and said calmly, \u201cSince you want to challenge me, then you should defeat my disciple first.\u201dAs soon as these words were said, the entire place was in an uproar.What did this mean? He actually wanted Lin Jian to challenge his disciple.This was a little too much to look down on people!Lin Jian felt humiliated, but he still asked sternly, \u201cIs that so? I\u2019ll defeat him now, and then the two of us will fight again!\u201dThe image of Xuan Yi falling at his feet had already appeared in his mind, and he couldn\u2019t help but become excited.If it was a real fight, he did not believe that he would lose. Xuan Yi was only in the law enforcement phase, and he had long reached the half-step sect master expert phase. However, in terms of realm, he had already crushed Xuan Yi.Even Xuan Yi could not defeat him. He could not understand why Xuan Yi would say that he should defeat his disciple first.\u201cThree months later.\u201d Xuan Yi paused for a moment and continued, \u201cIf you defeat Wang Hu, and I will fight you.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: 59Chapter 59: Seeking a master at the foot of the celestial sect of wondersThe moment these words were said, the entire place fell silent.In three months, he defeated Lin Jian?They all thought that they had heard wrongly.Wang Hu was only in the energy condensation phase.And Lin Jian was a half-step sect master expert. Even some sect masters might not be in that phase!Was Xuan Yi crazy?He actually allowed a disciple in the energy condensation stage to fight a half-step sect master expert in three months.Although Wang Hu had been bestowed with the imperial class inheritance by Xuan Yi, there was no way that he could defeat Lin Jian, a famous sword cultivator.They were not exaggerating at all. Let alone three months, even if it was three years, Wang Hu would still be an existence that Lin Jian could easily crush to death!\u201cMaster?\u201d Wang Hu\u2019s face was full of confusion. He also did not expect that the person who was going to fight with Lin Jian would be him, Xuan Yi\u2019s disciple with the worst talent.Xuan Yi smiled and said, \u201cDo you dare?\u201dWang Hu was stunned. He nodded his head heavily at the look of trust in Xuan Yi\u2019s eyes.Lin Jian\u2019s face was gloomy. At this moment, he did not hesitate to think that Xuan Yi was worried about not beating him and was delaying time.However, he still accepted it.Because he was confident that three months later, no matter how much Xuan Yi had grown, he would still be defeated by him.As for Wang Hu, he did not care about him at all. What could one at condensation stage do?The final secret of the saint mystic realm was concluded with Xuan Yi\u2019s disciple Wang Hu obtaining the imperial class inheritance. Without the imperial class inheritance, the saint mystic realm was no longer attractive to others.\u2026Half a month passed in the blink of an eye. During this half a month, almost all the sects quieted down.After Xuan Yi returned to the Xuan Sword sect, he originally wanted to take Song Qingxin in as his disciple, and Song Qingxin had agreed. She then said that she wanted to go home and inform the elders in her family before she would be back in half a month\u2019s time at most.These days, after the turmoil in the mystic realm, the old and quiet Xuan Sword sect had once again stirred up a wave.However, this time, it was not a crisis.The sun shone on the Xuan sword sect. Early in the morning, the mountain cliff of Xuan Yi was filled with disciples.\u201cDisciple pleads with Elder Xuan to accept me as a disciple!\u201dA loud shout startled countless birds.Elder Xuan\u2019s fame had long spread throughout the Xuan Sword sect. Previously, with the trip to the mystic realm, Xuan Yi had obtained all the disciples\u2019 admiration and all of them wished they could become Xuan Yi\u2019s disciples.After all, Xuan Yi did not even care about the half-step sect master experts. Furthermore, in the mystic realm, they had personally witnessed how much Xuan Yi doted on his disciples.That was an imperial class inheritance!It was difficult to say that the entire southern region had an imperial class inheritance. Yet, he had given it to his disciple, the disciple with the worst talent!It was not that there were no people with poor talent among them. Without exception, they would not be noticed by their masters. They would even be bullied by their senior brothers and sisters. On the other hand, Xuan Yi, not only had disciples with poor talents, but also gave them attention. He even gave his disciple the imperial class inheritance.How could they not be jealous.Thus.On this day, thousands of disciples stood under Xuan Yi\u2019s mountain gate and begged him to take in a disciple.Of course, what they did was equivalent to abandoning their masters. However, in order to stay under Xuan Yi, they couldn\u2019t care too much.\u201cElder Xuan, please accept me as your disciple!\u201d\u201cElder Xuan, I know how to wash clothes, cook, and warm the bed!\u201d\u201cBastard, shouldn\u2019t the matter of warming the bed be left to the female disciples?\u201dThe group of female disciples furiously cursed at the group of male disciples.There were even some female disciples who were dressed in very revealing clothes, revealing their snow-white thighs and shoulders. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that these clothes would mesmerize those ordinary people in the secular world.\u201cElder Xuan, not only can I be a disciple, I can do other things as well!\u201dSome of the bold female disciples directly began to talk flirtatiously in front of the mountain gate. Many people believed that, perhaps, at the order of Elder Xuan, the group of female disciples would fight to warm Elder Xuan\u2019s bed.\u201cDon\u2019t be shy, Elder Xuan. As long as you take me in, my sister and I will be yours!\u201d\u201cIf Elder Xuan doesn\u2019t accept me as a disciple, then I will kneel here forever!\u201dCompared with the hustle and bustle at the mountain gate, inside of the mountain gate was silent.In the Spirit Beast garden, Lin Yingxue was feeding the spirit beast that her junior brother had just caught. She naturally heard the voices at the mountain gate, but wasn\u2019t sure what was going on.\u201cSenior sister.\u201d Bai Weiwei appeared behind her.\u201cThere are many disciples at the foot of the mountain who want Master to take them in.\u201dLin Yingxue was slightly surprised before a sense of crisis arose. Originally, Xuan Yi only had a few disciples, and he doted on them very much. But if there were too many disciples, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have the energy to care about them.\u201cLet\u2019s quickly go and ask our Master!\u201dThe two of them, one following, arrived at Xuan Yi\u2019s mountain residence.The landscape was picturesque, and birds were hovering in the air. The two of them were not attracted by the beautiful scenery, but walked into Xuan Yi\u2019s residence.At this moment, Xuan Yi was sorting out the treasures he had obtained from the mystic realm and categorizing them. After the two of them entered, surprise flashed across their eyes.What was all this!They could actually smell the aura of a few holy items among them.Holy items were very powerful. Any one of them would be an eye-catching item in the sect. There were at least five or six of them in front of Xuan Yi.Was this master\u2019s treasures?\u201cMaster!\u201dThe two of them suppressed the shock in their hearts and bowed slightly.\u201cGet up. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cThere are many other disciples at the mountain gate wanting to be Master\u2019s disciples. I wonder what master means?\u201dXuan Yi waved his hand. \u201cSend them away.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe two of them were pleasantly surprised. As long as master did not have many disciples, his love for them would not be taken away.It was not that Xuan Yi did not want to take in disciples. He was really disdainful of taking in disciples because the disciples outside the sect were less talented than each other. It was meaningless to take in such disciples.Xuan Yi wanted talented disciples.The more talented the disciple was, the faster his cultivation level would increase.In the trial tower, Xuan Yi did not increase his cultivation standard. However, because Wang Hu had obtained the imperial class inheritance, his cultivation standard increased rapidly. In addition to Lin Yingxue\u2019s breakthrough, it brought Xuan Yi a realm increase.He put these treasures into his storage bag and thought that Song Qingxin should be back by now. With Song Qingxin\u2019s talent, she should be able to increase her cultivation standard by at least one realm.At the foot of the mountain gate, Lin Yingxue and Bai Weiwei descended from the sky. Their appearances caused the disciples to shut their mouths. Soon, the entire scene fell silent.Then, the silence only lasted for a moment before a wave of exclamations came from the crowd.\u201cSenior sister Lin has actually broken through to the golden elixir phase!\u201dA single sentence stirred up a thousand waves. How could they not know that a month ago, Lin Yingxue was still at the foundation phase? How long had it been since then, and she had actually stepped into the golden elixir phase!They felt as if their throats were stuck, and it was difficult for them to breathe.That bottleneck didn\u2019t exist under Elder Xuan?How could there be such a terrifying master in the world! !This time, they were even more determined to have Xuan Yi to take them in.\u201cMaster said that he doesn\u2019t want to accept any disciples for the time being. You guys can go back first!\u201dThe group of disciples shouted one after another, \u201cNo! We must acknowledge Elder Xuan as our master!\u201dBai Weiwei raised her eyebrows, and a smile appeared on her heroic face. In the next moment, a sharp sword energy shot out, and her aura soared, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to become his disciple, but you have to defeat me first.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: 60Chapter 60: The battle between two geniusesWhen the sword struck out, everyone was stunned.This aura!Bai Weiwei\u2019s cultivation had improved again after coming out of the trial tower!Was this the growth of a genius teacher?Although Bai Weiwei\u2019s strength had improved a lot, she was only stronger than some of the disciples here.But looking at Bai Weiwei\u2019s aura, did she want to take on all of them by herself?Soon, an empty space was formed in the middle of the crowd.\u201cI\u2019ll go first!\u201dA disciple flew out and rushed towards Bai Weiwei at a high speed.Bai Weiwei\u2019s expression was the same as usual as she drew her sword and struck out.Rumble, this disciple was shot and flew out, and flew upside down over a hundred feet and embedded into a mountain.The entire place was silent.This was the strength of a golden elixir phase cultivator?They knew this disciple. Although his talent wasn\u2019t very high, he had already reached the second level of the golden elixir phase!But didn\u2019t Bai Weiwei just step into the golden elixir phase?Just this one move!Looking at Bai Weiwei\u2019s relaxed appearance, it was likely that she hadn\u2019t even used her full strength. It was as if she had casually defeated a disciple at the second level of golden elixir phase, with just one strike strike.It was not difficult for them to imagine if Bai Weiwei had used her full strength, this disciple would have been directly killed.But even so, no one retreated.There was only one thought in their hearts, and that was to defeat Bai Weiwei and become the disciple of Elder Xuan.Another person flew out, but just like the previous one, he did not endure a few moves and was defeated with just one sword strike.Bai Weiwei had a lunar body, so her physique was extremely strong. It wasn\u2019t difficult for her to fight against someone of a higher level, let alone someone of the same level.\u201cSenior brother, are you confident?\u201dA disciple in the crowd asked the person beside him.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, when Bai Weiwei was victorious, I naturally wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat her. But as long as she consumes a few more rounds, then defeating her will be easy.\u201dThere were people around who recognized this person. He was the Great Elder\u2019s disciple, Li Feng, whose talent was not bad.This person had even revealed a small part of himself during the meeting back then and was chosen by the Great Elder. However, he did not receive much attention under the Great Elder\u2019s tutelage later on. Even so, he had also relied on his own efforts to reach the golden elixir phase. In the entire inner sect, everyone who had reached this stage was a favored disciple. With his talent, he should have received much attention. However, it was rumored that he had once angered the Great Elder, in the end, to the point where his talent was buried.However, even though he was not valued by the Great Elder, his strength was still an existence that could not be underestimated in the inner sect.Not to mention Bai Weiwei, after a few rounds of battle, even during her period of complete victory, many disciples thought that she would not be able to defeat Li Feng.The reason why Li Feng was waiting at the back was because he wanted to make his victory more assured.After a few rounds, Bai Weiwei\u2019s aura was a little messy. Her tall chest was bulging, attracting the attention of countless male disciples. Her graceful figure was coveted by countless men, but they only dared to look at her. They did not dare to have any other thoughts.This was Elder Xuan\u2019s beloved disciple.Who would dare to think about it.One of them would probably be permanently blacklisted by Elder Xuan.Even if she wasn\u2019t Elder Xuan\u2019s beloved disciple, just Bai Weiwei\u2019s current appearance alone was enough to make many people stop in their tracks. Her entire body was filled with killing intent, and the tip of her sword was dripping with fresh blood.With this appearance, the group of male disciples didn\u2019t think that they could control her.And beside Bai Weiwei stood Lin Yingxue, whose figure was even hotter.They couldn\u2019t help but think that Elder Xuan took disciples based on their looks too.Otherwise, how could the disciples under him be better looking than the others.\u201cWho else is there?\u201dBai Weiwei stood on the spot with a determined look in her eyes.A loud shout caused the hearts of countless disciples to tremble.\u201cWho else is there!\u201d\u201cMe!\u201dLi Feng squeezed out of the crowd. He didn\u2019t fly but walked out step by step.Against Bai Weiwei, he had mustered all his energy and didn\u2019t dare to waste even a trace of spiritual essence.He believed that as long as he was cautious, it would not be difficult to defeat Bai Weiwei.His imposing manner soared, and the surrounding fallen leaves danced in the air. Lin Feng held his sword, and his fingers were dripping with sweat.Countless disciples held their breaths. Such a battle team was rare for them. If they looked carefully, they might be able to obtain a great harvest. However, when they saw the spiritual weapon in Li Feng\u2019s hand, they were all slightly shocked.High-grade spiritual weapon.Although it was inferior to Bai Weiwei\u2019s supreme-grade spiritual weapon, it was still a high-grade spiritual weapon. Even the genius disciples in the inner sect might not have a high-grade spiritual weapon.Bai Weiwei knew this Li Feng. He was the disciple of the Great Elder. He could be said to be a very strong existence.At least half a month ago, Bai Weiwei couldn\u2019t defeat him. But now, Bai Weiwei was very confident.Standing in the crowd, Bai Weiwei\u2019s breathing was slightly hurried.She suddenly remembered the moment when she was sneered at by countless disciples not long ago.And now, it was not an exaggeration to say that she was admired by countless disciples.All of this was given by Xuan Yi.So today, no matter what, she couldn\u2019t lose her master\u2019s face.Both of them unleashed their auras and charged at each other.Bai Weiwei did not hold back at all and directly activated her strongest skill, bringing with it a gust of wind that swept towards Li Feng like a vortex. The sand and dust around his body formed a storm. Her fair fingers held onto the sword and directly aimed at Li Feng\u2019s chest. If this one hit, even if Li Feng did not die, he would still be heavily injured.Facing this sharp sword, Li Feng\u2019s gaze focused. He did not expect Bai Weiwei to use her killer move and did not dare to clash head-on. Li Feng quickly but barely dodged this sword. After that, he did not hesitate to raise his hand and thrust his sword towards Bai Weiwei, this sword didn\u2019t use any martial skills. He was testing Bai Weiwei\u2019s reaction ability.A bolt of lightning exploded from Bai Weiwei\u2019s hand. She blocked it with lightning speed, and then she used another killing move.Soon, the fight was going back and forth, and the air exploded with sounds from time to time.They left afterimages, and some of the disciples with low cultivation couldn\u2019t even see their figures clearly.\u201cIt seems that Bai Weiwei is at a disadvantage,\u201d a few disciples with higher cultivation discussed.\u201cAccording to this trend, Bai Weiwei will lose sooner or later.\u201d\u201cLook, Bai Weiwei\u2019s aura.\u201dIn the blink of an eye, Bai Weiwei\u2019s aura suddenly became terrifying, and a sharp sword aura burst out from the body.The incomparably violent sword energy directly forced the disciples who were closer to her back a few steps.Countless people were shocked.\u201cThis terrifying aura, it\u2019s probably her killer move.\u201dOn the other side, Li Feng\u2019s aura also suddenly erupted.This was the two people who had finished probing and were preparing to use their killer moves.The battle in front had only lasted for a few dozen breaths, and it was clear that the two people did not look down on each other. After understanding the opponent\u2019s approximate strength, they did not hold back.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say who will win this time.\u201d\u201cNot necessarily. I think Li Feng has a higher chance of winning. You can see it from his aura.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: 61Chapter 61: Victory!\u201cLi Feng\u2019s aura is indeed a little more terrifying.\u201dHowever, Bai Weiwei was not weak either. The main reason why they thought that Bai Weiwei would lose was that Bai Weiwei had almost used up all of her spiritual energy. Moreover, the injuries on her body were even more severe than those on Li Feng\u2019s body.Objectively speaking, Li Feng\u2019s chances of winning were indeed great.While everyone was discussing, the two of them moved. They rushed towards each other at high speed, and the aura that they created directly blocked the sunlight.Rumble\u2026A storm blew everyone\u2019s hair into a mess. However, their eyes did not have any intention of leaving the battlefield. They stared fixedly at the battlefield.The thick smoke slowly dispersed. Countless disciples\u2019 eyes were wide open.This was because the impact of this scene was too great for them.Li Feng and Bai Weiwei fell to the ground.In the middle of the battlefield, there was a huge pit that was dozens of feet deep.\u201cIs this a tie?\u201d.\u201cIt should be considered a tie, right?\u201dThey stood stiffly on the spot.This kind of damage was not something that could be caused by an aurous core stage cultivator. Perhaps only an abhijna stage cultivator could cause such high damage. From this, it could be seen how terrifying the power of their strongest killing move was.\u201cIt\u2019s a tie. Then how does this count?\u201d\u201cCan he be taken in as a disciple?\u201d\u201cWait, look quickly.\u201dA disciple pointed at the big pit, his eyes filled with shock.Everyone followed his gaze and saw Bai Weiwei standing up shakily.She stabbed her sword into the ground to support her body that was dripping with blood. The corners of her mouth curled up into a smile.\u201cWho else is there?\u201dHer tone was calm and indifferent. When it rang in the ears of the disciples, it sounded like thunder.Li Feng had actually lost. The terrifying Li Feng had actually lost.Others might not know, but as disciples of the mysterious sword sect, they were very clear that Li Feng was an existence that many inner sect disciples were not a match for.And Bai Weiwei had only joined the inner sect a few days ago.If Bai Weiwei had defeated them previously, they would only think that Bai Weiwei was a little stronger, but defeating Li Feng was not something that could be done just by being a little stronger.Moreover, other than Xuan Yi, there was probably no other possibility for her to achieve such tremendous growth in a short period of time.The entire place was silent.Lin Yingxue came to Bai Weiwei\u2019s side and supported her.\u201cSince there\u2019s no one else, all of you can go back. Our master doesn\u2019t like it to be noisy.\u201dThe group of disciples still did not leave but did not refute. They watched the two of them leave in a daze.\u2026After learning about what had happened at the bottom of the cliff, Xuan Yi did not ask about it. He was waiting for Song Qingxin\u2019s arrival, but after waiting for a while, Song Qingxin\u2019s figure was still nowhere to be seen.A few days passed.Song Qingxin still had not arrived.This made Xuan Yi a little anxious. Song Qingxin\u2019s talent was not bad. This was his walking cultivation.Because Song Qingxin had left behind a strand of spiritual sense, her safety was certain. However, there was still no sign of her. Xuan Yi remembered what Song Qingxin had said about the instability of her family\u2019s power.According to Song Qingxin, she was from an aristocratic family in the central of the continent. Other than that family, there were many other big families. There were many open and hidden conflicts between the big families.Song Qingxin\u2019s family was neither big nor small, but they were also in deep trouble. Xuan Yi could not help but suspect that Song Qingxin was delayed by the family\u2019s matters, right?Should he going to make a trip personally?However, if he didn\u2019t, she would be an extremely talented disciple, it would be a pity to give up.After thinking for a while, Xuan Yi prepared to pack up his things and head to the central of the continent to take a look.At the same time, he could also bring Wang Hu along for a round of training.In two months, Wang Hu would have to battle with the southern region\u2019s genius, Lin Jian. If he only raised his cultivation and did not train his battle awareness between life and death, it would be very difficult for him to defeat Lin Jian, the extremely experienced genius.After calling Wang Hu over, Xuan Yi checked his aptitude.His aptitude, which was originally only a little over ten points, had now broken through to a hundred.This was all thanks to the imperial class inheritance.Xuan Yi could not help but think that since the imperial class inheritance was so amazingly terrifying, it seemed that if there was a chance, it was better to get more.If that was the case, he would not even need to look for genius disciples. He would directly pull a group of mortals to bestow the imperial class inheritance. This would be extremely terrifying.Of course, if a genius possessed an imperial class inheritance, their future achievements would naturally be incomparable to that of ordinary people.The central region of the continent was known as the Middle East region. It was much more powerful than the southern region. In comparison, the Middle East was like a town while the southern region was like a suburb.Xuan Yi had made a lot of preparations for this trip to the Middle East.After he was done with his preparations, he brought Wang Hu and bid farewell to Bai Weiwei and Lin Yingxue. When they left, the two girls cried a lot.\u201cMaster, on our trip to the Middle East, can we go back to my home first?\u201d\u201cIs your home in the Middle East?\u201dXuan Yi was slightly surprised.\u201cNo, it\u2019s on our way to the Middle East. It\u2019s in a small mountain village.\u201dXuan Yi nodded his head, \u201cSure.\u201dA sedan chair with a dragon picture embroidered on it, rose up. Wang Hu rode a stallion. This was a level three demonic beast. Its strength was comparable to a golden elixir phase, and its speed was extremely fast.Along the way, Wang Hu was riding a stallion, and Xuan Yi was sitting inside the sedan chair.Flying in mid-air, the crowd of mortals was shocked and envious.Although they were not immortals yet, and were only cultivators seeking immortality, this was enough to make them envious.After half a day, Wang Hu did not stop along the way. He arrived at the first small village among the mountains.Originally, the people in the village were surprised to see horses in the sky. They called out to their neighbours to go out and check. However, they did not expect that this luxurious carriage would land in their village.This was not their biggest surprise. What was even more surprising was the person who got off the horse.Wasn\u2019t this Wang Hu who had left home for a few years in search of immortality?Looking at it now, Wang Hu had long lost the naivety he had when he left. Instead, he was mature, steady, and had an aura that surpassed everything else.At that time, they did not believe that Wang Hu could successfully pursue immortality and taoism. How could a young man who had left a small mountain village become a disciple of a sect that was like a celestial being.However, Wang Hu\u2019s status was clearly different from before.Not only was he dressed like this, he seemed to be doing quite well.\u201cWang Hu.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really you.\u201dHe thought that the young man who was about the same age as Wang Hu had rushed out and was pleasantly surprised. This was Wang Hu\u2019s childhood playmate.Wang Hu glanced at him and smiled.Looking at these familiar faces, he knew that he was no longer the same as them.This was not because Wang Hu had changed, but because the rules of this world were like this.Of course, the villagers also had this feeling.A long robe, full of immortal energy, and that terrifying aura all reminded them that Wang Hu was no longer the same Wang Hu from before.They were slightly afraid and did not dare to come forward.Which of Wang Hu\u2019s playmates was called Wang Yue, his originally pleasantly surprised expression froze on the spot, and then he took two steps back, his posture becoming respectful.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: 62Chapter 62: Wang Hu\u2019s angerWang Hu clearly remembered that Wang Yue often bullied him when he was young. However, now that he had become stronger, he did not care about the things that happened when he was young. However, seeing Wang Yue\u2019s respectful attitude still made him feel a little pleased, recalling his master\u2019s teachings, he quickly buried this emotion in the bottom of his heart.\u201cImmortal Master Wang\u2026\u201dThe villagers that he was familiar with in the past knelt down respectfully towards Wang Hu.Wang Hu naturally would not be uncomfortable with their bows. Many of these people had bullied him in the past.Wang Hu swept his calm gaze over and his mouth moved slightly. \u201cGet up.\u201dNo one dared to disobey him.He looked around and asked softly, \u201cWhere is Wang Juan?\u201dWang Juan was a girl that Wang Hu had liked since he was young. Because Wang Hu\u2019s father passed away since he was young, only left his mother who had painstakingly raised him up. The Wang Juan family did not agree on their marriage. Moreover, they were still young at that time, the two of them had only made a promise to become husband and wife when they grew up.However, in the eyes of adults, that was just a child\u2019s joke and could not be taken seriously.However, Wang Hu had always remembered his promise. This was also one of the reasons why he persisted in cultivating despite his extremely poor talent. Now that he had returned from cultivating, he naturally had to fulfil his promise.When they heard the name Wang Juan, they naturally thought of the things that happened when Wang Hu and Wang Juan were young. Initially, they had thought that the promise would be forgotten when they grew up. However, they didn\u2019t expect that Wang Hu would still remember it.If it had been three days ago, they might have been very happy about it. After all, Wang Hu was an immortal in their eyes, but now it is different, because Wang Juan had just married.The reason why each of them did not dare to answer Wang Hu\u2019s question was mainly because they were worried that Wang Hu\u2019s temperament had changed greatly over the years. In his fury, he would snatch and kill them all.For cultivators, killing them was just a matter of a snap of the fingers.Seeing that everyone was stammering and didn\u2019t dare to answer, Wang Hu realized that something was wrong. He slightly frowned and said, \u201cI\u2019m asking you all a question.\u201dThese angry words scared everyone to the point that they knelt on the ground and continuously trembled.\u201cWang Yue, you speak.\u201dWang Hu gently pointed.Wang Yue\u2019s entire body trembled, as he said with a trembling voice, \u201cWang\u2026 Wang\u2026\u201d\u201cQuickly say it.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Wang Juan just got married three days ago. She married to the Ye family in town\u2026\u201dWang Hu was stunned. Wang Juan had broken her promise?He felt a big stone pressing on his heart.Wang Yue seemed to have read Wang Hu\u2019s mind, he continued to explain, \u201cWang Juan didn\u2019t take the initiative. Because there was a cultivator in the Ye family who had stepped into the path of cultivation, the hedonistic disciple of the Ye family took a fancy to Wang Juan and married her into the family. However, Wang Juan was not the first wife, but only a concubine. But because of the cultivator of the Ye family, the Wang Juan family didn\u2019t dare to oppose\u2026 \u201dHe stopped here. An extremely powerful murderous aura caused his voice to become softer and softer until it disappeared.Hearing this, Wang Hu also understood.Wang Juan was forced. Because the Ye family was powerful, she had no choice but to marry into the Ye family.Therefore, Wang Juan didn\u2019t break her promise. It was just that the external factors made her have no choice but to break it.Wang Hu\u2019s face was gloomy. Not only did he forcefully marry Wang Juan into the family, but he also made her his concubine.This matter caused his blood boiled to the maximum.\u201cB*stard. You all are like Wang Juan\u2019s family, yet just watched her being forcefully married?\u201dWang Yue quickly explained, \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to stop it, but we really have no choice. The cultivator of the Ye family is a disciple of the Crossing Immortal sect? If we dare to interfere, I\u2019m afraid they would wipe out the entire village.\u201dWang Hu knew this Crossing Immortal sect. When he went out to seek immortality, the first place he went to was the Crossing Immortal sect. At that time, he was even humiliated by the disciples of the sect.He frowned and said coldly, \u201cIf Wang Juan is safe, then everything will be fine. If she is hurt, then don\u2019t blame me for taking out my anger on everyone here.\u201dAt this time, a voice came from the sedan chair, \u201cLittle Hu, don\u2019t mess up your faith in Taoism. These are just innocent people.\u201dWang Hu paused for a moment, then respectfully replied, \u201cYes. I will remember it in my heart.\u201dThis scene shocked the villagers. They originally thought that Wang Hu was strong enough, but he was so respectful to the person in the sedan chair. From the way he addressed, it seemed like it was his master.In an instant, a white-haired old man appeared in their minds.As a disciple, Wang Hu was already so powerful. Then as his master, how terrifying must he be.Although they didn\u2019t know Wang Hu\u2019s true realm, but from his aura, he was much more terrifying than that Ye family cultivator.\u201cWang Yue, take me to the Ye family. The others, get lost.\u201dWang Yue immediately panicked when he heard this. He didn\u2019t want to get involved in this mess, but he swallowed his refusal when he saw Wang Hu\u2019s expression.\u201cGood, good\u2026\u201dWang Yue scrambled to his feet and walked in front of Wang Hu. Meanwhile, the villagers swarmed away, afraid that Wang Hu would vent his anger on them.\u201cMaster, I have some matters to attend to, and it might take some time.\u201dXuan Yi didn\u2019t force to leave this village. He knew that this was the heart tribulation of this disciple of his, and this matter definitely couldn\u2019t be delayed.He just so happened to want to see if there were any talented disciples along the way, as well as some treasures. This little bit of time was not considered a delay to him.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You just have to settle your matters in peace.\u201dHearing Xuan Yi\u2019s words, Wang Hu was reassured because Xuan Yi\u2019s subsequent words were \u201cJust settle your matters in peace.\u201d This also meant that Xuan Yi was in favor of him, and when encountering difficulties, Xuan Yi was also very likely to help him.This time, he felt even more confident.Town, Ye family.Wang Hu followed Wang Yue on his stallion. Along the way, they attracted the attention of countless people.It wasn\u2019t until they arrived at the Ye family\u2019s entrance that the onlookers gathered around.Ye family, Ye Xiu.He was a man close to sixty years old. However, due to his poor talent, he hadn\u2019t stepped onto the path of cultivation. He could only be considered an expert in the secular world.Originally, the Ye family should only be able to barely survive in the secular world. After all, they were not the only family in the secular world. However, who would have thought that the Ye family would actually produce a clansman with excellent talent.He had already stepped into the energy condensation stage when he was at twelve years old. Such talent was one of the best even in the various large sects. However, his talent was quickly picked up by the Crossing Immortal sect. The sect elder directly took him in as a disciple, this caused the entire Ye family to become much stronger. Relying on the Crossing Immortal sect, they quickly rose to prominence.They became the most powerful family within a radius of a few miles. Of course, all of this had to do with the gifted disciple.After so many years, that disciple had long become the inner sect\u2019s eldest senior brother. Wherever he went, he was respected by countless people.Under such a background, the younger generation of the Ye family\u2019s disciples slowly became unbridled.Forced marriage, evil.Almost all the evil things that could be thought of had been done by them.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: 63Chapter 63: Ye familyAlthough the local people did not have a good impression of the Ye family, they did not dare to disobey them. Most of them avoided the people of the Ye family and were very afraid.The reputation of the Ye family gradually became terrifying in this area.Everything related to the Ye family, regardless of whether it was right or wrong, had to be said by the Ye family. Otherwise, they would suffer the revenge of the Ye family.Wang Hu\u2019s sudden appearance made them want to watch the show. However, it wasn\u2019t the Ye family that was the show, but Wang Hu.\u201cWhich ignorant brat doesn\u2019t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth and wants to mess up with the Ye family?\u201dAt this moment, Wang Hu withdrew all of his aura. Other than the stallion under his butt that could tell that he was extraordinary, he was almost like an ordinary person.However, there were also some people who had good eyesight who stared at the sedan chair. \u201cLooking at the sedan chair, it doesn\u2019t seem like an ordinary family.\u201dTheir words immediately caused a group of people to retort, \u201cNo matter how extraordinary it is, can it still be as powerful as the Ye Family?\u201dThey were very clear about the genius disciples of the Ye family. Not to mention in this town, even in the Crossing Immortal sect, the Ye family was an existence that no one dared to provoke.Dark clouds covered the sky, and soon, a heavy rain came.Wang Hu came to the Ye family expressionlessly and shouted softly, \u201cIs the Master of the Ye family in?\u201dOriginally, he was not prepared to be so polite, but when he thought of Xuan Yi\u2019s teachings, he put away the anger in his heart and tried to solve this matter in a gentle way. If only Wang Juan was safe, he would be willing to not pursue the sins of the Ye family.However, his words did not make the surrounding villagers think that he was very polite. Instead, they were shocked by his actions.What kind of existence was the Ye family? Even the Crossing Immortal sect would take them seriously. However, they did not expect that this teenager actually dared to directly call the Ye family\u2019s patriarch. Did he not know how powerful the Ye family was?The Ye family\u2019s patriarch was the father of that genius. Not to mention Wang Hu, even the elders of the Crossing Immortal sect would give face to the Ye family\u2019s patriarch.\u201cIs this person crazy? He actually directly called out the family\u2019s patriarch and didn\u2019t even report.\u201d\u201cI can already imagine the scene of him being beaten until he vomits blood and begs for mercy.\u201dThe Ye family\u2019s patriarch wasn\u2019t strong, only slightly stronger than some mortals in the secular world. However, not many people dared to fight against him. It was very simple. They were all afraid of the revenge from the genius.Coincidentally, this genius disciple happened to be at home today.This time, the crowd became even more lively. They all guessed what would happen to Wang Hu later.At the very least, he would lose his life. At the very most, he would become a cripple.These were the two most likely outcomes they could think of.This loud shout not only shocked the surrounding crowd, but also the entire Ye family.\u201cWho the f*ck is so bold?\u201d A dandy arrogantly cursed. He raised a long knife and was about to walk out.In reality, the only person in the Ye family who could cultivate was that genius. The others were experts in the secular world. The reason why they could act so arrogantly in the entire town was because of the support of the genius disciple.A large hand stopped this dandy, \u201cCousin Ye Chen, why is your temper still so bad?\u201dYe Chen stopped. The person who stopped him was the genius who had returned home. He was also his cousin, Ye Wuji.He might not have listened to the family patriarch, but he did not dare to disobey his cousin\u2019s words no matter what.This was because he had run amok for many years and had countless strong women. Later, he was once again bumped into Ye Wuji and was directly beaten into crippled. In the end, it was the family patriarch who pleaded for mercy and allowed Ye Wuji to heal his legs.\u201cI heard that you married another wife?\u201dYe Chen paused for a moment and did not dare to make a sound.In the family clan hall, many elders were silent. As long as Ye Wuji was at home, they had to stand aside for many matters and obediently wait for Ye Wuji\u2019s orders.From this, it could be seen that Ye Wuji had extremely high prestige in the Ye family.Ye Wuji glared at him and then said in a deep voice, \u201cWhen did our Ye family fall to such a state?\u201dA circle of people did not speak.\u201cAny Tom, Dick, or Harry dares to offend the dignity of our Ye family.\u201dYe Wuji was not a very bad person, but he was definitely a domineering person.The halo of genius over the years had allowed him to cultivate a character where everyone had to listen to him.If anyone dared to disobey, it would make him feel that his dignity had been violated and thus, he would not be respected.These people generally had not experienced any storms and waves. They always felt that the world revolved around them. If you obeyed them, it would be expected. If you did not obey them, they would think that you were wrong, and then they would use their own methods to help you correct it.Some people thought that they had a personality, but in reality, they were not mature.At this moment, Wang Hu\u2019s loud shout had offended Wuji\u2019s reverse scale.From what he knew, the patriarch of the Ye family was his father, and he was a genius of the Crossing Immortal sect. How could someone dare to be so rude to his father? If that was the case, wouldn\u2019t a genius like him be looked down upon?Hence.\u201cLooks like I have to let them reacquaint themselves with the Ye family.\u201dAs Ye Wuji walked out, this group of elders also followed.They also wanted to see who was so daring to be so rude to the Ye family in front of their house. They also wanted to know how Ye Wuji would deal with this person.A group of people walked out in a grand manner.At the door, Wang Yue was so scared that he almost peed his pants. He never thought that Wang Hu would be so bold. This was the Ye family.He had already begun to look for an opportunity to escape.This was because when the Ye family members came out later, if they were to vent their anger on him, eight lives would not be enough to kill them.What they were afraid of came true. Just as Wang Yue was looking for an opportunity to escape, the Ye family members walked out in an imposing manner.\u201cWho is so rude in front of my Ye family\u2019s door?\u201dYe Wuji\u2019s voice was heard even before he arrived.One could hear that there was anger in his voice.His appearance caused the people around him to take a few steps back. They subconsciously stayed away from Wang Hu, afraid that they would be hurt.Wang Hu could naturally hear the anger in Ye Wuji\u2019s tone, but Wang Hu was not afraid. He just used a calm tone and said slowly, \u201cLet the eldest of the Ye family come. I have something to ask him.\u201dWhat!Didn\u2019t he know that this was a genius disciple of the Crossing Immortal sect?He actually dared to be so arrogant!Everyone present was shocked on the spot.A voice sounded in their minds.This kid is dead for sure!Ye Wuji was already extremely angry. After all, Wang Hu\u2019s words implied that he wasn\u2019t the one who could speak with authority. However, as he was angry, he suddenly laughed out of anger.\u201cA mere energy condensation phase cultivator actually dares to be so arrogant. Do you think that you\u2019re invincible after stepping on the path of cultivation?\u201d Ye Wuji probed for a while and said with a chuckle.\u201cIt seems that you\u2019re the one who has the highest authority to in the Ye family. Let me ask you, if Wang Juan is in your Ye family. Let her go, and I\u2019ll let your Ye family live.\u201dAs soon as these words were said, the entire place was in an uproar.They felt that their brains were short of oxygen.Was this person really not afraid of death?He actually said that he would let the Ye family live\u2026Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: 64Chapter 64: Ye Wuji was shocked!How arrogant and ignorant was this.Many people were so shocked that their mouths were half-open, and they stood rooted to the ground.Ye Wuji smiled and walked forward lightly, \u201cDo you not know how the word \u2018death\u2019 is written?\u201dThe power of Wang Zhen was not complicated. There were only a few secular families, but in the entire Qingfeng County, there were many cultivator powers. The Crossing Immortal sect was one of them, and it was the most powerful sect. There were many elders who were at their golden elixir phase in the sect, moreover, the sect master was a third level law enforcement stage cultivator. Such a lineup could be considered a pretty good sect in the southern region.Ye Wuji could not help but suspect that this brat was a disciple of another sect. However, after learning about his cultivation, he dismissed this thought. This was because even if he was a cultivator from another great sect, with his cultivation at his age, he probably wouldn\u2019t be taken seriously.Since that was the case, he had nothing to worry about.\u201cB*stard, what are you talking about? You actually don\u2019t take the Ye family seriously. Who are you? !\u201dYe Chen\u2019s temper flared up. His eyes were filled with anger, then rushed out aggressively, but was stopped by Ye Wuji.\u201cThis is a cultivator. You can\u2019t win him.\u201dYe Chen immediately retreated after hearing this.\u201cEveryone, where is the woman called Wang Juan in your residence?\u201dWang Juan was the concubine that Ye Chen had just married. He was displeased when he heard this. This person was obviously here for his concubine. As the dignified second young master of the Ye family, how could he not be angry when someone had his eyes fixed on his woman and chased to his door.Moreover, this concubine was especially fierce. She had been married to the family for three days, but he still hadn\u2019t succeeded sharing a room together. If he used force, she would threaten him with death.This already made him very angry. In addition, Wang Hu\u2019s appearance made him feel humiliated. Thus, he stood behind and secretly called out to a servant, \u201cGo and find the patriarch. Tell him that someone is looking for trouble with the Ye family.\u201dHe said the word \u2018trouble\u2019 very deeply. If he told the patriarch about the current situation, then he definitely wouldn\u2019t care. After all, what kind of storm could a small character stir up? But if he said that someone was looking for trouble, then the patriarch would guess.Was it a person, a group, or a power.In this way, the patriarch would attach importance to the Ye family\u2019s reputation.From this, it could be seen that Ye Chen wasn\u2019t a fool. He knew his father very well.In this way, there was another point. Ye Wuji was a disciple of the Crossing Immortal sect. Under normal circumstances, for the sake of his own reputation and status, he wouldn\u2019t have the intention to kill. After defeating this person, in order to show his magnanimity, he would at most cripple this person.However, if it was the patriarch, then this person\u2019s life would be in danger.After being domineering for so many years, Ye Chen already had the intention to kill Wang Hu.Although Ye Wuji was also very angry, he did not act like Ye Chen. Instead, he observed the sedan chair behind Wang Hu. There was an aura within it. Although he could not sense its depth, it was definitely much stronger than Wang Hu\u2019s.Ye Wuji was a very cautious person. Otherwise, he would have made his move as soon as he came out. He would not have waited so long.After learning that there was a person with a higher cultivation than Wang Hu sitting on the sedan chair, he calmed his mind and called out to his master, Taoist Duxian, with the token of the Crossing Immortal sect.At this point, he finally felt at ease.\u201cI\u2019m asking you. Is Wang Juan in your residence?\u201dWang Hu became more and more impatient. If it wasn\u2019t for Xuan Yi\u2019s order not to act openly, he would have already made his move.\u201cDo you know who you\u2019re talking to?\u201dIn fact, Wang Hu had hidden his cultivation.After obtaining the imperial class inheritance, his cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds.He had fought all the way until he reached the half-step golden elixir phase. If he wasn\u2019t worried that his cultivation would grow too fast that might cause his faith for taoism would be unstable, he could have reached a higher level. His current cultivation was already the result of him deliberately suppressing it.In the past, he did not even dare to think about it. Within a month, he had reached the half-step golden elixir phase in the energy condensation stage! What a terrifying talent.Moreover, in the imperial class inheritance, he had also activated the bloodline atavism in his body and obtained the Thunder White Tiger physique, one of the four great divine beasts of the ancient times.This physique was an extremely monstrous physique. It was the derivative physique of one of the ten great divine beasts of the ancient times. As long as he grew up, he could fight against the sage!According to the ancient books, this physique had appeared a few times. The most recent time was a few hundred years ago. A powerhouse called the heavenly tiger, whose cultivation was only at the master expert phase, had fought against the sage for three hundred rounds and was still not defeated.One had to know that the lower the cultivation, the easier it was to leapfrog, and ffter reaching the law enforcement stage, it was a very difficult thing to leapfrog, not to mention a terrifying existence like the master expert phase and the sage phase.There was almost no possibility of challenging someone of a higher cultivation. However, the Thunder White Tiger physique could narrow the gap. The more dangerous the situation was, the stronger the opponent would be, the Thunder White Tiger Physique would be able to unleash greater power. This was the so-called saying that when facing a strong opponent, one would be stronger.In addition, Xuan Yi had not given him a weapon yet. If he were to casually throw him a holy item, he would be invincible under the law enforcement stage!With such strength, Wang Hu was very confident.\u201cWhich sect are you from?\u201dYe Wuji also wanted to know Wang Hu\u2019s background, but because he sounded a little afraid when he asked, he did not say anything. He did not expect Ye Chen to ask on his behalf.\u201cTrash, you don\u2019t deserve to know my sect.\u201dWang Hu said calmly. He had already seen that if he wanted to discuss with them, he would definitely not be able to save Wang Juan, so he could not endure it anymore.\u201cVile creature, how dare you look down on my Ye family!\u201dYe Wuji no longer waited. He took a step forward and rushed out. A gust of wind flew past, leaving behind several afterimages.Seeing this, the members of the Ye family were all shocked. This speed had increased again.\u201cIt seems that brother Wuji\u2019s cultivation has improved quite a bit,\u201d Ye Chen said lightly.This time, he was even more confident. In his mind, he could already picture Wang Hu kneeling on the ground and begging for mercy.However, what happened next shocked him to the spot.What was going on.He saw that Wang Hu did not move at all. He gently grabbed Ye Wuji\u2019s long sword with one hand.The genius disciple of the Crossing Immortal sect was caught by a nameless junior with his bare hands!This time, the entire place was in an uproar.In their world, although the Ye family was not the strongest existence, it was still extremely terrifying, especially Ye Wuji. Even in the various sects, he was a disciple with pretty good talent, but now, this incomparably sharp sword was firmly caught. They had personally witnessed the power of this sword.They had already thought about the scene of Wang Hu lying in a pool of blood. This kind of contrast made it hard for them to believe. If Wang Hu had a little difficulty to catch it, they might not have been so surprised. But now, it was very casual and very relaxed.It was just like an adult facing a child\u2019s fist.\u201cYou!\u201dYe Wuji\u2019s eyes were round. He stared at Wang Hu, whose cultivation had skyrocketed, in disbelief.First level of energy condensation\u2026 Second level\u2026 Third level\u2026 Fourth Level\u2026 Fifth level\u2026 Sixth level\u2026 First level of foundation\u2026 Second level\u2026 He only stopped when he reached the level of half-step golden elixir stage.\u201cWhat!\u201dYe Wuji was shocked!If it was an old man, an elder, a person about the same age as his master, he might not be surprised, but the person in front of him was even younger than him!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: 65Chapter 65: Battle!An existence younger than him, yet his cultivation was close to his.This was something that Ye Wuji, who had been a genius for many years, could not accept.\u201cB*stard, how dare you hide your cultivation!\u201dWang Hu was especially puzzled when he heard this.In this world that was filled with dangers, wasn\u2019t hiding one\u2019s cultivation a very common method?It seemed that this Ye Wuji\u2019s cultivation was only high, he lacked tempering. Then, just like him, he had led his master all the way, killed demonic beasts, and experienced many dangerous battles. His battle instincts had long surpassed those of the past, the Ye Wuji in front of him was even worse than his own experience back then.\u201cBang\u201dThe spirit sword was broken. Wang Hu pinched the tip of the sword and said calmly, \u201cYou are not my opponent. Let Wang Juan go. If Wang Juan doesn\u2019t pursue your sins, I will naturally let your Ye family go.\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201dYe Wuji appeared calm on the surface, but his heart had already stirred up a storm.This was a low-grade spirit sword. How could it be crushed just like that?Ye Wuji withdrew his contempt and took a few steps back. Soon after, his cultivation began to soar. He only stopped when he broke through to the second level of the golden elixir phase.Did he also hide his cultivation?But that wasn\u2019t right. Wang Hu clearly detected that he was only at the initial stage of the golden elixir phase. He didn\u2019t hide it at all.As Wang Hu thought about this, a voice suddenly sounded in his mind.\u201cThere is a forbidden medicine in this person\u2019s mouth. Eating it will allow his cultivation to soar in a short period of time, but the aftereffects will be extremely strong.\u201d So that was how it was! Wang Hu replied telepathically, \u201cI understand. Thank you for your explanation, Master.\u201dIf it was his junior sister who was at the second level of the golden elixir phase, he probably would not dare to fight. This was because even though Bai Weiwei\u2019s cultivation did not increase much after coming out of the mystic realm, her strength had increased by more than a degree.Once again, he fought with Bai Weiwei and was defeated in only three moves, and that was the result of Bai Weiwei giving way to him. However, he had great confidence in replacing Bai Weiwei with Ye Wuji.\u201cHowl!\u201dA sound like a tiger\u2019s roar came out from Wang Hu\u2019s mouth. Some mortals with weak physiques spurted blood from their mouths and noses on the spot.\u201cToo terrifying!\u201dLooking at Wang Hu, they seemed to see a tiger that had gone mad. It was fierce and brutal. With no other choice, these people retreated wildly, directly forming a clear zone in the field.\u201cCome on!\u201dYe Wuji shouted angrily, and then a burst of explosive sound appeared under his feet. He rushed toward Wang Hu, who was running toward him. Without the spirit sword, he did not use his weapon.\u201cHeart piercing palm!\u201dA terrifying aura came out from his hand.\u201cSixth move! Tiger Roar and Thunder!\u201dThe two palms met, directly bursting out a wave of air.The two people took three steps back. Ye Wuji waved his hand, bent his body, and then sidestepped to avoid Wang Hu, who was attacking again. In a place where Wang Hu was not paying attention, he reached out his hand to grab the side of his waist.\u201cBlack bereavement finger!\u201dHis fingers began to turn black and pierced into Wang Hu\u2019s ribs, leaving behind a ditch. The usual ditch soon cuased the surrounding skin black. Wang Hu realized that this was a technique with poison, he didn\u2019t panic. Instead, he turned his hand and created a ripple in the air, he directly attacked Ye Wuji.\u201cThe eighth move!\u201d\u201c!\u201dAn intense aura pressed down on Ye Wuji until he couldn\u2019t breathe. Judging from the aura, he already knew that if this attack was firm and strong, he would lose half of his life even if he didn\u2019t die.\u201cSwallow-folding step.\u201dAs soon as his voice fell, his body suddenly floated up. Wang Hu could not tell which one was him for a moment. After looking for no results, he suddenly aimed at a shadow and struck down, but unexpectedly, this shadow had disappeared.\u201cWrong attack!\u201dYe Wuji was overjoyed. Taking advantage of Wang Hu\u2019s carelessness, he once again grabbed at his chest. His ribs and chest were not in the same place. If he had grabbed the golden elixir in his chest, Wang Hu would very likely be killed by this attack.A few breaths after the start of the battle, Wang Hu knew his weakness. It was that he had too few battle techniques, and Ye Wuji\u2019s methods were strange and despicable.\u201cIt\u2019s coming.\u201dYe Wuji thought that he had found Wang Hu\u2019s weakness, but he did not expect that just as his hand grabbed out, a sharp axe came at him and directly knocked him back. It was just a little bit more.Ye Wuji was annoyed, but he did not linger in the battle and quickly retreated. At this moment, he naturally knew that this weakness was deliberately left by Wang Hu. If he did not retreat, the axe would hit his face.Panting heavily, Ye Wuji looked at Wang Hu with a gloomy gaze.One had to know that at this moment, he had taken a forbidden medicine, but even so, he still could not gain any advantage.Wang Hu used spiritual energy to force out the black poison from his body. His gaze was frivolous, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.Just now, he was testing Ye Wuji\u2019s strength, but now he had basically figured everything out.\u201cThunder!\u201dWang Hu\u2019s axe weighed hundreds of pounds, and its length was almost the same as an adult\u2019s height.At this moment, thunder exploded on the axe, and tiny bolts of lightning twined around it. In almost an instant, he rushed in front of Ye Wuji.\u201cThunder! Divine Flame! Abyss-free!\u201dChant after chant came out of his mouth.Ye Wuji panicked. He felt that he was trapped on the spot and could not move. Faced with such a terrifying attack, Ye Wuji was afraid. His gaze became ruthless as he took out the forbidden medicine and swallowed two more.The reason why the forbidden medicine was called a forbidden medicine was because it would harm the user\u2019s body. As for Ye Wuji, if he only took one, he would at most fall into a weakened state. However, if he took three in a row, his cultivation would drop drastically by two levels after the effects of the medicine ended.It could even seriously affect his talent.Unless it was a life and death situation, it was impossible for a cultivator to do such a thing.After the forbidden medicine entered his stomach, Ye Wuji\u2019s eyes shot out a bright light. Then, his eyes gradually turned blood-red.A powerful aura came from his body.Wang Hu immediately retreated.He was very familiar with this powerful aura. Only an expert close to the law enforcement realm would have such a terrifying aura.Ye Wuji had forcefully raised his golden elixir cultivation to the law enforcement realm through the use of the forbidden medicine. This was something that Wang Hu had not expected. In this way, regardless of whether he won or lost, when the effects of the drug ended, it would cause great damage to Ye Wuji\u2019s body.It was not difficult to see how competitive Ye Wuji was.He would not rest until one of them died!Four words flashed through Wang Hu\u2019s mind.In that case, let\u2019s fight!The aura of his huge axe rose steadily. The violent aura swept up countless air waves. The curtains of the sedan chair fluttered slightly. Xuan Yi stuck his head out to take a look before continuing to close his eyes to recuperate.\u201cHulala\u201dThe crowd retreated once again.\u201cAre these two not planning to leave their trump cards?\u201d\u201cWhat a powerful aura!\u201d\u201cTerrifying!\u201dEveryone from the Ye family was also very surprised.They knew Ye Wuji\u2019s strength. To be able to force him to take the forbidden medicine, it was clear how powerful this youth was. They could not help but suck in a cold breath.If Ye Wuji was a genius, then what was this youth?A genius amongst geniuses!If Wang Hu heard these words, he would definitely laugh in disdain.Because his talent was the worst and had nothing to do with geniuses. The reason why he was here today was all because of Xuan Yi.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: 66Chapter 66: The powerful Wang HuThe sky was gloomy. It was unknown whether it was because of the battle or it was going to rain.Ye Wuji rushed over with incomparable ferocity.He directly unleashed his strongest killer move.\u201cSky Slayer! Heaven and Earth Divine Might!\u201dWang Hu\u2019s determined gaze looked over. He did not dodge and directly faced him with an explosive shout.\u201cMonarch style!\u201dThere was a martial technique within the imperial clss inheritance. After a period of trial and error, he had not fully mastered it, only learned its form. However, just by the form itself, the power was already not something that even Ye Wuji could withstand.The collision in the field exploded into a terrifying wave of air.In an instant, the sky turned dark.Wang Zhen shook entirely, and about ten breaths passed.Wang Hu walked out in large strides. Along with his footsteps, the thick smoke slowly dispersed.On the ground, Ye Wuji\u2019s aura was weak. At this time, he probably could not even defeat a mortal.This result shocked everyone present. Perhaps they didn\u2019t know, but the whole town and the Ye family knew very well how strong Ye Wuji was.He was an existence that could even fight with the elders of the Crossing Immortal sect. Even Ye Wuji\u2019s master might not be able to defeat Ye Wuji if he didn\u2019t treat him seriously.\u201cHe lost\u2026\u201d\u201cHe actually lost\u2026\u201dThey didn\u2019t expect that the talented Ye Wuji would actually lose.Wang Hu stood in front of the sedan chair and said respectfully, \u201cMaster, sorry I\u2019ve frightened You.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201dHe turned his head, \u201cYe family.\u201dThe calm words came out of his mouth, startling the Ye family members and causing them to shiver.At this moment, Wang Hu was covered in blood and filled with a murderous aura. He was like a death god!Even the strongest Ye Wuji had lost to him. Who else could the Ye family have?How could this not make them afraid.\u201cYoung man\u2026 Young Man\u2026\u201d\u201cLet me ask you, where is Wang Juan?\u201dWang Hu\u2019s eyes suddenly turned fierce, and the Ye family members who were directly scared slumped on the ground.\u201cYoung hero, please wait. I will send Wang Juan out now.\u201dAt this moment, Ye Chen was somewhat unhappy.Although he knew that Wang Hu was powerful, his many years of being a dandy made him very arrogant. He also did not know what it meant to lower his head. Therefore, after the Ye family member said this, he lied and said, \u201cNo matter how beautiful she is, she is still a piece of trash that I have played with before. Do I really want her?\u201dHe said these words with no intention of angering Wang Hu. It was just that earlier when Wang Hu came at his door, he totally ignored the Ye family. This made him very uncomfortable in his heart. He said these words just to find a way out for the Ye family\u2019s compromise.Didn\u2019t you want her?Here, take it.But I\u2019ve played with her.She\u2019s a piece of trash!Do you still want it or not!Yes, she\u2019ll always be a piece of trash that other had played with.Was Ye Chen Stupid? He wasn\u2019t stupid. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have thought of using this method to regain face.But he was also stupid because he had neglected Wang Hu\u2019s temper.After hearing these words, Wang Hu didn\u2019t hesitate at all. He directly flew up and beheaded the mortal Ye Chen.In an instant, the scene fell silent.Many members of the Ye family were stunned.Why did he say such things? He should have just thrown Wang Juan to Wang Hu, but now, the son of the Ye family was killed.This scene caused many mortals who had never seen blood, to vomit.\u201cI\u2019ll give you three minutes to bring Wang Juan here. If Wang Juan loses even a hair, your Ye family will be buried with him.\u201dThe Ye family didn\u2019t dare to refute. They ran back to the Ye family in a panic, afraid that Wang Juan would have any mishaps. But at this moment, the Master of the Ye family came.He didn\u2019t know the cause and effect. He only heard Ye Chen say that someone was looking for trouble with the Ye family.And as soon as he arrived, he heard Wang Hu\u2019s last words.Immediately, his face darkened.What kind of arrogant person was this? He actually dared to say such outrageous words in the town.Didn\u2019t he know that the Ye family was the biggest force in the entire town?\u201cVile creature, who said that the Ye family would be buried together!\u201dOnce the patriarch arrived, the Ye family\u2019s people calmed down quite a bit.Although the Ye patriarch\u2019s influence wasn\u2019t strong, but he was the person with the most authority in the entire town. He had many friends, and one of them was the city lord of Qingfeng City. The city lord\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t low. According to rumors, he had already reached the half-step law enforcement phase.What\u2019s more, the patriarch of the Ye family, Ye Xiu, had a direct connection with the Crossing Immortal sect. If everything didn\u2019t work out, he might as well directly bring out the Crossing Immortal sect.If the Ye family was compared to an egg, then the Crossing Immortal sect was like a diamond.This youth had the ability to defeat the Ye family, but he definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat the powerful Crossing Immortal sect.When Wang Hu saw the arriving man, he lightly frowned.His initial thought was to save Wang Juan from the Ye family. He had never thought that he would have a conflict with the Ye family, even though Wang Juan had suffered a lot.After his status had already reached a high level, Wang Hu couldn\u2019t be bothered with these secular sects, because his status was high enough that he didn\u2019t care about anything in the secular world.But now, he felt very helpless. It was as if if he didn\u2019t destroy them, they wouldn\u2019t know what fear was.The arrival of the patriarch of the Ye family makes Wang Hu\u2019s calm mood more irritable. He looked at Ye Xiu blandly and said, \u201cWhy are you unhappy if Ye family doesn\u2019t die out?\u201dAt this moment, he already had the desire to kill.If Xuan Yi wasn\u2019t here, he would have already started killing!Wang Hu wasn\u2019t as good-tempered as Bai Weiwei. He was someone who had been bullied all year round and his inner anger was built up. That was to say, Xuan Yi suppressed his personality. Otherwise, with his personality, he would have made his move long ago.How could he slowly communicate with this group of people like he was now.\u201cDo you know that this is the Ye family!\u201dYe Xiu was an old man with white hair. With one look, one could tell that he was old, but his spirit was very strong, especially his eyes. There wasn\u2019t any turbid feeling in them. On the contrary, they were extremely clear-headed.When he saw the situation on the field, he suddenly froze.He stared at Ye Wuji, who was lying in a pool of blood, without moving.He originally thought that Ye Wuji wouldn\u2019t care about fighting against ordinary humans. However, he never expected that Ye Wuji had already fallen to the ground!This scene shocked him.Based on his understanding of Ye Wuji, in the entire town, in the entire Qingfeng city, other than the city lord, there probably wasn\u2019t anyone who could be his opponent.And now, it looked like he had been defeated by this youth in front of him!What terrifying strength was this!He looked like he was much younger than Ye Wuji.Ye Xiu sized up Wang Hu\u2019s clothes again, looking very ordinary. Because of the battle, his clothes were already tattered beyond recognition.His gaze passed Wang Hu and looked at the sedan chair behind Wang Hu. His expression immediately changed.He had once gone out with the city lord of Qingfeng City and had been lucky enough to see such a sedan chair. Back then, even the city lord had been extremely respectful to the people in this sedan chair.Although the person in this sedan chair was not the one they had seen that day, but just from the status alone, it was definitely not to be underestimated.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: 67Chapter 67: Someone from the crossing immortal sectWhen he thought of Ye Wuji lying on the ground, he immediately made a judgment.This person couldn\u2019t be provoked.\u201cYou\u2019re the Ye family\u2019s patriarch, right?\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dYe Xiu\u2019s face turned a hundred and eighty degrees. This shocked the surrounding people to the ground.This plot wasn\u2019t right!Shouldn\u2019t you be furious after coming over and fight this youth to the death?The person lying on the ground was your Ye family\u2019s genius!It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that the Ye family had come to this status because of Ye Wuji, but now that Ye Wuji was lying on the ground, Ye Xiu had lower his attitude that he didn\u2019t even mention revenge.This was something that they didn\u2019t dare to believe.However, there were also some people who discovered some clues because Ye Xiu\u2019s attitude had changed after seeing the sedan chair.This couldn\u2019t help but make them curious about the sedan chair.Was it because of the sedan chair, or was it because of the person in the sedan chair that Ye Xiu was so afraid?The Ye family had been in the town for a long time, but this had never happened before!\u201cYoung hero, I\u2019ll give you the person you want, and this matter will be over, okay?\u201dWhen these words came out, the entire crowd went into an uproar!Not only did Ye Xiu lower his attitude, he actually gave in!Who dared to believe it.If this was in the past, Wang Hu would have died for sure.Countless people looked at the sedan chair.They were shocked!Who was actually inside?Not even a single person had appeared, just the sedan chair alone was already enough to make Ye Xiu so afraid!\u201cHand over Wang Juan, and deal with your Ye family\u2019s matters on your own.\u201dWang Hu said coldly.He had originally thought that Ye Xiu would be a bit arrogant, that would give him a reason to teach the Ye family a lesson, but he had never thought that this old man Ye Xiu would be so shrewd.Seeing his master\u2019s sedan chair, he no longer dared to be impudent.This way, he would have no reason to cause trouble for the Ye family.That was fine too. As long as Wang Juan was fine, then everything would be fine.Even though Wang Hu and Wang Juan didn\u2019t depend on each other when they were young, but they had spent time together for a long time. Their feelings for each other were extremely deep. Now that he was about to meet his childhood playmate, he was quite excited.However, while Wang Juan was being brought here\u2026An unforeseen event once again occurred!The people from the Crossing Immortal sect had arrived.They were one of the strongest forces in Qingfeng city.Moreover, the person that came wasn\u2019t a small fry, he was the Great Elder of the Crossing Immortal sect.\u201cB*stard, who beat up my beloved disciple to such a state?\u201dWang Hu raised his head and looked over.An old man with a sage-like demeanor and a slightly wretched appearance, especially those small and gloomy eyes.He stared at Wang Hu darkly, like a poisonous snake waiting for an opportunity to launch a sneak attack.He believed that if Wang Hu wasn\u2019t cautious, he might succeed in his sneak attack and kill Wang Hu.\u201cThis is going to be a good show!\u201d\u201cEven the people from the Crossing Immortal sect were alarmed, and it\u2019s the Great Elder!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid this time, it won\u2019t end up easy for this kid!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for sure. Trust me, this kid is almost certain to die!\u201dThe person who spoke had personally witnessed this Great Elder making a move. He could move mountains and destroy seas with a snap of his fingers.He had also seen Wang Hu\u2019s battle just now. Of course, he did not believe that Wang Hu could defeat this Great Elder.\u201cI bet ten copper coins! This kid will definitely die today!\u201d\u201cGood fellow, you have the nerve to take out this bit of money to bet!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take out all of my assets and bet on the Great Elder of the Crossing Immortal sect winning!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so shameless. How much money do you have now?\u201dThe clamor continued.Wang Hu looked over gloomily.The strength of this Great Elder was indeed not something he could deal with at the moment.Originally, this was only a divine ability realm elder. If Wang Hu had a saint weapon, he would not be afraid of him.However, this elder had some dog shit good luck. He was stuck in the divine ability realm for many years, but he loosened up and directly stepped into the law enforcement realm.This was the law enforcement realm!In the entire Qingfeng city, only the city lord had reached this realm.Even the sect master of the Crossing Immortal sect was only at the second level of the law enforcement realm.Now that the Great Elder had reached this realm.It would be a lie to say that he didn\u2019t inflated.However, after he inflated, he fell into deep thought. After reaching his realm, what else was there for him to care about?He had fame and reputation.His status was infinitely close to the city lord of Qingfeng city.He knew that as long as he stayed within the boundaries of Qingfeng city, he would basically be at the top of the pyramid.This kind of life was not what he wanted.Therefore, he began to focus on training his disciples.This was because after his talent reached the law enforcement realm, it was already very powerful. If he wanted to break through again, it was almost impossible!But his disciple was different. His disciple\u2019s talent were high!He was practically the most talented cultivator in the entire Qingfeng city.In the Qingfeng city, the satisfaction that the Great Elder could obtain was already enough.He couldn\u2019t help but think that by nurturing his disciple into a big shot, his disciple would be able to break through to a higher level and stand on a bigger stage.Southern region.This was a bigger stage.If his disciple was doing well in the southern region, then his status as his master would naturally rise again.Just thinking about it, countless people were shocked that this monster was actually his disciple!Just thinking about it made him extremely excited.But, today!Today!His beloved disciple was actually severely injured.Lying on the ground, he was breathing weakly.This was not what he was most angry about.Ye Wuji\u2019s talent was what he valued the most. However, Ye Wuji had taken quite a few forbidden pills, that being said, his talent would be affected by the backlash of the forbidden pills, affecting his future cultivation.This was what he did not wish to see.And all of this was because of this youth in front of him.For the Great Elder to be able to reach his status, he was definitely not stupid. However, because his beloved disciple had become like this, he had lost his rationality. Without thinking much, he directly charged towards Wang Hu.A great battle was about to start.Wang Hu frowned and dodged backwards.After that, he suddenly jumped up and pulled Xuan Yi\u2019s sedan chair to the side.Such a battle could easily affect Xuan Yi.But in reality, he was worrying too much.Because unless Xuan Yi left this place, he would definitely be affected. It was just that Xuan Yi would not suffer any harm.\u201cWhy did I encounter a bunch of brainless idiots today!\u201dWang Hu cursed angrily. Anyone with eyes could tell from looking at the stallion that pulled the sedan chair was a golden elixir phase demon beast. What right did they have to be so impudent in front of his master again and again.The appearance of the Great Elder gave Ye Xiu a glimmer of hope.After all, the Crossing Immortal sect was definitely stronger than the Ye family.But seeing the Great Elder directly make a move, it was as if his heart was in his throat again.He was a ruthless person, a ruthless person who would leave almost no way for his enemies to survive.But he was also a smart person. It was very clear that this sedan chair, this youth, couldn\u2019t be provoked!But, he had no way to stop it. He could only sulk and wait for the result.At this moment, the youth who had already been provoked would definitely not be like before, directly settling things with everyone.If the young man won in the end, he would vent his anger on the Ye family.Then, what should he do?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: 68In a moment of desperation, he ordered his servants not to let Wang Juan go.After all, this was his only trump card.If he handed her over, Wang Hu would still have to blame the Ye family.Even if he had eight lives, it wouldn\u2019t be enough for Wang Hu to kill.At this moment, Ye Xiu looked at Wang Hu\u2019s expression and suddenly felt a sense of familiarity.He vaguely remembered that this kid was a youth from the Wang family village. His talent was extremely poor. Back then, he seemed to want to be a servant of the Ye family, but they didn\u2019t take him in. He didn\u2019t expect that.It had only been a short while.He was extremely shocked in his heart!He subconsciously looked at the sedan chair and could not help but associate Wang Hu\u2019s current situation with the sedan chair.He immediately felt that it was difficult to breathe.If Wang Hu\u2019s current situation was caused by the person in the sedan chair.Then, just how terrifying would the person in the sedan chair be?!In the arena, the power of law enforcement expert was very great. Many people had already left far away. They were afraid that it would affect their safety, so there was a clear zone of a few miles in the center.Wang Hu stood in front of the sedan chair and rushed out to meet the Great Elder.In fact, Xuan Yi did not think that Wang Hu could defeat the law enforcEment Great Elder.The reason why he did not care about it was that he wanted to temper Wang Hu. His cultivation had improved too quickly, but his actual strength had not kept up. Taking advantage of this opportunity to temper Wang Hu, it would be very beneficial for him to fight Lin Jian who was in the sect master expert stage in the future.\u201cMonarch Style!\u201dWang Hu didn\u2019t hold back at all. He attacked with a killer move.An extremely brilliant light burst out from the huge axe in his hand, causing it to tremble. This was a low-grade spirit weapon, and it couldn\u2019t withstand Wang Hu\u2019s spiritual energy.\u201cHa!\u201dThe air stopped!The Great Elder and Wang Hu collided. Wang Hu took a step back and resisted the Great Elder\u2019s attack.With just this attack, he knew that he could not defeat the Great Elder.After all, the Great Elder was able to withstand his strongest attack without changing his expression and continued to suppress his aura.In fact, it was very likely that the Great Elder had not released his strongest strength yet.\u201cSpit\u201dA mouthful of blood spurted out from Wang Hu\u2019s mouth.He gritted his teeth and casually took out a medicinal pill.This was the raw meat pill that Xuan Yi had given him.The living dead, the raw white meat!Once the pill was taken down, a stream of air circulated within his body.Unexpectedly, the Great Elder pulled out his other hand.\u201cSky-destroying thunder!\u201dA terrifying thunder energy was emitted from his hand and ruthlessly struck the direction of Wang Hu\u2019s forehead.Wang Hu could not dodge in time and could only take the blow head-on. He was sent flying on the spot. He was dozens of feet away and crashed into a few houses.Was this the law enforcement realm?Outside the arena, there was complete silence.Countless of them thought that this youth would probably die today.However, they couldn\u2019t be happy.Because as the backing of the Ye family, the Crossing Immortal sect didn\u2019t have a good reputation.They didn\u2019t have a good impression of the Crossing Immortal sect.At this moment, when they saw the Great Elder being so arrogant and ruthless, they all broke out in a cold sweat for Wang Hu.One had to know that the Great Elder was an elder, an old monster who was many years older than Wang Hu. However, he did not hold back when facing Wang Hu.It was true that his disciple had been defeated by Wang Hu, but Wang Hu had relied on his own strength.His current actions could be described as overbearing and unreasonable.\u201cTrash!\u201d\u201cDo you now know that my Crossing Immortal sect is not a place that trash like you can get your hands on!\u201d\u201cTell me, who is your master? How could he have taught such a trash disciple!\u201d\u201cTo be able to teach such trash like you, I\u2019m afraid your master is also trash!\u201dCountless people were shocked!This person was too shameless!His disciple had clearly been defeated by the other party, yet he still called the other party a trash, and even called the other party\u2019s master a trash!If the master and disciple were trash, he would probably be worse than a trash, right?\u201cHulala\u201dWang Hu staggered out from the collapsed house. Dust was all over the place. He lowered his head and walked step by step.However.His steps were a little erratic.His body swayed.It was as if he was drunk.If he was not careful, he might fall to the ground.However, he was still walking.He muttered.\u201cTo humiliate my master\u2026 Die!\u201d\u201cTo humiliate my master\u2026 Burn into ashes!\u201d\u201cTo humiliate my master\u2026 Dismember his body, dismember his head, and crush him!\u201dThe Great Elder was also shocked.Others might not know, but he was very clear that he had used all his strength in that attack just now. Not to mention a cultivator at the golden elixir phase, even a law enforcement phase expert would not dare to say that he could stand up after taking it.However, it was true that Wang Hu had stood up, but his aura was also very weak.Only then did the Great Elder heave a sigh of relief. To be honest, this youth\u2019s tenacity was an existence that even he was afraid of. If he was given a few more years, he might not be able to defeat him.The Great Elder laughed disdainfully, \u201cA trash like you still want to protect your master\u2019s dignity? Teaching a trash like you is probably the most disgraceful thing!\u201d\u201cSince you want to protect your master\u2019s dignity, suicide is the best way!\u201dThis time, not only Wang Hu, but even the people outside the arena were furious.It was one thing to bully the weak, but he even insulted, slandered, and lastly persuaded Wang Hu to commit suicide!Was this a human thing?Wang Hu continued to walk, and his body suddenly moved.\u201cHumiliate my master, kill without mercy!\u201dThe axe had long been thrown to an unknown place by him. He rushed toward the Great Elder with his bare hands, and the spiritual energy fluctuations in his body became more and more intense.This was the effect of triggering the bloodline constitution.The Great Elder was shocked. Only now did he see that Wang Hu\u2019s constitution actually had the shadow of one of the four great ancient divine beasts!This was the legendary constitution!And not only did he not have any fear, but he even became excited.Ye Wuji\u2019s talent had suffered a heavy blow, but if this person\u2019s physique was extracted and sent into Ye Wuji\u2019s body, not only would it allow Ye Wuji\u2019s talent to recover, it might even allow Ye Wuji to reach a higher level!\u201cDivine Beast Physique! It would be a waste to put such a physique on you. Why don\u2019t I take it for you and give it to someone who needs him more!\u201dTo extract one\u2019s physique and bloodline was something that required one to pay with their life. From this, it could be seen that the Great Elder\u2019s heart was as venomous as a snake and a scorpion.At this moment, the sedan chair that Xuan Yi was in made a slight movement.A gentle breeze blew past and the curtains swayed.Xuan Yi\u2019s tender face was revealed. It was as white as snow.The Great Elder glanced at it and did not pay much attention to it.However, in the next moment, Xuan Yi who was in the sedan chair disappeared.He was suddenly shocked. By the time he regained his senses, Xuan Yi had already appeared in front of him.In an instant, he felt as if he was facing a huge mountain.\u201cRumble\u201dWith a palm strike, the Great Elder knelt on the ground on the spot, blood oozing out of his seven orifices.His gaze was dull as he rooted to the ground.\u201cHiss\u201dThe entire crowd was shocked!Who was this person? He was so strong!More importantly, he was actually so young!!They didn\u2019t even see how Xuan Yi attacked. In just an instant, they saw the Great Elder kneeling on the ground, blood splattering all over his body. Although he didn\u2019t die, but he had lost the ability to fight.By the time they regained their senses, Xuan Yi\u2019s figure had already disappeared.Some of the slower ones didn\u2019t even see what was happening.At this moment, countless people were staring at the Great Elder, screaming in their hearts.Aren\u2019t you crazy!Aren\u2019t you arrogant!Now, continue to be crazy!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: 69Chapter 69: Each person chooses a sectCountless people shouted in their hearts.At the same time, they became even more curious about the mysterious person in the sedan.That was the Great Elder of the Crossing Immortal sect.He was an existence whose power was only below the sect master of the Crossing Immortal sect.However, it was only one attack. They didn\u2019t even see how Xuan Yi attacked.\u201cHe\u2019s too strong! Come On!\u201d\u201cDid you guys see it clearly just now?\u201d\u201cIt seemed to have passed in an instant. I did not see the wall, but the person in the sedan chair is too strong.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if I will be taken in as a disciple. The last time I tested my talent, I was told that my talent is too high. No one dare to take me in. I don\u2019t know if this expert will dare to.\u201d\u201cWhat a shameless person. This expert wants to take in a expert like me.\u201dThe group of people argued non-stop, but without exception, they all wanted to acknowledge Xuan Yi as their master.But one had to know that Xuan Yi valued talent very much when taking in disciples. For ordinary people, even with Ye Wuji\u2019s talent, Xuan Yi would not take a liking to him.Wang Hu came to the front of Xuan Yi\u2019s sedan chair and lowered his head. \u201cThank you, master, for your help.\u201d\u201cYou continue to do your thing.\u201dWang Hu nodded his head respectfully. He looked at the Ye family with a gloomy gaze.At this moment, he had received his master\u2019s words and wasn\u2019t planning on holding back any longer. He wanted to resolve this matter as soon as possible, and the fastest way was to use violence.Ye Xiu seemed to have thought of this as well. He hurriedly stood up and nervously said: \u201cDon\u2019t even think about touching my Ye family. I\u2019ve already sent the person you want to the Crossing Immortal sect. If you dare to touch my Ye family, don\u2019t even think about seeing that woman again!\u201dWang Hu didn\u2019t think that Ye Xiu would use such a move. After so many times, he couldn\u2019t take it anymore.As a result.The tiger aura erupted from his body. In an instant, he rushed in front of Ye Xiu. Because he had already thrown his big axe into the collapsed house, he used both hands to directly snap Ye Xiu\u2019s neck.Even though Ye Xiu was a martial artist, he was only an existence stronger than an ordinary person. There was no way he could block Wang Hu\u2019s attack.A round head rolled to the ground. He angrily tore Ye Xiu into pieces.This scene scared the Ye family members to the ground. It looked like Wang Hu had gone crazy.He had gone crazy from killing.This was the Ye family\u2019s patriarch!He killed as he wished.It wasn\u2019t hard for them to imagine. If he dared to kill the Ye family\u2019s patriarch, then Wang Hu definitely wouldn\u2019t go easy on them.Run!At this moment, this thought appeared in their hearts.Even the Crossing Immortal sect was not a matter, so what right did they have to let Wang Hu be feared.However, they were all mortals, so how could they possibly outrun Wang Hu.Wang Hu\u2019s blood soared almost wherever he went at a fast speed!The people who had been oppressed by the Ye family all these years were all extremely happy.\u201cGood kill!\u201d\u201cThis is too satisfying!\u201d\u201cThe Ye family has been doing evil for so many years, and they were finally eliminated by the young hero!\u201d\u201cThe patriarch of the Ye family said that the person that the young hero was looking for was sent to the Crossing Immortal sect! What should we do!\u201dThey were very grateful that Wang Hu had helped them to get rid of the Ye family, but at the same time, they couldn\u2019t help but worry for Wang Hu.\u201cLook, this person is too strong!\u201d\u201cThe Crossing Immortal sect might not be a match for him!\u201dWhen these words were said, not many people believed them.They had been shocked enough today. They had become much more accepting of the impossible.However, they still didn\u2019t believe that these two people could defeat the Crossing Immortal sect. After all, the Crossing Immortal sect was not one person, but an entire sect.There were many cultivators among them. It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that each person could drown Wang Hu with a single spit.Very quickly, Wang Hu caught up to Ye Chen.This incomparably arrogant dandy made a very spineless move when facing life and death. He knelt on the ground and said, \u201cGrandfather, let me go!\u201dThe group of blood-thirsty disciples all felt contempt for Ye Chen\u2019s action. After all, the Ye family\u2019s patriarch had just died at his hands. Ye Chen kneeling and begging for mercy was truly spineless to the extreme. After all, that was his father!But even so, Wang Hu did not show any mercy and directly broke Ye Chen\u2019s neck.His methods were brutal, and this was also because Wang Hu had suppressed enough viciousness.As Wang Hu\u2019s figure continuously flickered, the members of the Ye family fell one after another.In a short while, the entire floor of the Ye family was covered with corpses.Wang Hu was full of viciousness as he walked out of the Ye family step by step. His entire body was covered in blood, and his wet hair was slowly dripping with blood.He was like a death god.Everyone was stunned when they saw him, and they shouted at the end.\u201cGood!\u201d\u201cYoung Hero is mighty!\u201d\u201cThis is so satisfying!\u201dCountless people cheered for Wang Hu.Standing in the middle of the crowd, Wang Hu\u2019s expression was normal, without showing his inner joy.As a young man who had walked out of a small mountain village, when had he ever received such a scene of people crowding around him? He felt like he had been reborn.He looked at the sedan chair. Within it, sat the person whom he greatly respected.It could be said that without Xuan Yi, he would not have been able to achieve what he had today.The constitution that he possessed in the imperial class inheritance had a very strong recovery ability. After a few battles, Wang Hu basically did not have much spiritual energy left. However, it had only been a short while before he had recovered half of his spiritual energy.The terror of the imperial class inheritance was more and more experienced by Wang Hu, and such a terrifying inheritance, Xuan Yi had casually given it to him. This made him extremely shocked.Every time he thought about it, he found it hard to believe.He felt that the luckiest thing in his life was to become Xuan Yi\u2019s disciple.\u201cMaster!\u201d\u201cIs it settled?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Master\u2026 There\u2019s one more thing\u2026\u201dWang Hu was somewhat hesitant. The so-called thing he was talking about was naturally Wang Juan, who had been sent to the Crossing Immortal sect.This was the love of his life. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to get this opportunity, so how could he let go.However, he was afraid that Xuan Yi would find it troublesome and delaying, that he was unwilling to go to the Crossing Immortal sect.That was why he hesitated when mentioning this matter.How could Xuan Yi not understand his thoughts.The sedan chair was silent for a few breaths, \u201cGo to the Crossing Immortal sect, Master will accompany you!\u201dWhen he heard this, Wang Hu was overjoyed!\u201cThank you, Master!\u201d\u201cThank you, Master!\u201dFor the sake of a woman, if Xuan Yi did not help Wang Hu eliminate his inner demons this time, he might plant seeds in the future and affect his cultivation.If Wang Hu could not improve on his cultivation, it was naturally difficult for Xuan Yi\u2019s cultivation to improve.Therefore, Xuan Yi was prepared to accompany him this time.The sedan chair rose and Wang Hu rode the stallion, flying directly into the sky.The mortals looked up.They were both happy and looked forward to this celestial-like method!Let\u2019s talk about the Crossing Immortal sect.After hearing the news, they were all extremely shocked.And the first thing they realized was that they had offended someone they shouldn\u2019t have!\u201cSect master Ku Du, don\u2019t panic.\u201dThe person who was a guest at the Crossing Immortal sect comforted him.Ku Du shook his head with a bitter smile: \u201cI\u2019m not nervous! I\u2019m just regretful that all the genius elders and genius disciples under my sect have died!\u201d\u201cThis person seems to have a high cultivation, but he probably should be someone easy to handle. If I step out, I think I can solve this problem.\u201dThe person who spoke was an elder from the Yin corpse sect, and he had some connections with the sect master of the Crossing Immortal sect.Ku Du wasn\u2019t too worried in the first place, but he felt regretful. However, now that he heard that the elder of the Yin Corpse sect wanted to help him, he felt even more confident.At this time.\u201cYou little rascals from the Crossing Immortal sect!\u201d\u201cYour Lord Hu is here! Hurry up and come out to welcome!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70: 70Chapter 70: Cursing ArrayThis angry roar spread throughout the entire Crossing Immortal sect.Countless cultivators and disciples couldn\u2019t believe their ears. Who was this person?Was he out of his mind?He actually dared to shout like this in front of the Crossing Immortal sect.They all felt that they had heard wrongly.Not to mention in front of the doors of the Crossing Immortal sect, even the disciples of the Crossing Immortal sect were very respected outside.\u201cWhat\u2019s that sound?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Has someone gone crazy?\u201d\u201cI suspect that I might have heard it wrong.\u201d\u201cNo need to suspect, it must be wrong!\u201dOn the martial arts practice field, countless disciples of the Crossing Immortal sect were discussing the sound just now.They didn\u2019t know anything about the Ye family, nor did they know that the Ye family had been exterminated. They also didn\u2019t know that even their Great Elder had been killed by the owner of the sound.\u201cHey, let\u2019s just continue practicing.\u201d\u201cCrossing Immortal sect, come out and face your death!\u201dWang Hu shouted again in front of the Immortal sect.This time, it spread throughout the martial arts practice field. They looked at each other, their eyes were full of doubt.\u201cDid I hear wrongly again!\u201d\u201cI really want to hear someone say that my mother should go out and face her death.\u201d\u201cReally? Why do I think I heard someone saying that we should go out and kneel?\u201d\u201cNo, no, I think I heard someone asking me to drink.\u201d\u201cWhat drink? There are people shouting outside the door.\u201dOutside the door, Wang Hu shouted twice but there was no response. He couldn\u2019t help but scratch his head. Was it because his voice was too soft?Xuan Yi said, \u201cYou can\u2019t do this. I\u2019ll teach you.\u201dThen, Xuan Yi taught him a telepathic voice transmission technique that was comparable to the Buddhist heavenly sound technique! It was so powerful that even a foundation phase cultivator would be stunned.Wang Hu was overjoyed on the spot. Then, he took a deep breath and poured out all the resentment in his heart with his spiritual voice.\u201cYou bunch of trash. All of you can\u2019t find a female cultivator to be your life partner. If you find one, you still won\u2019t be able to have a child. The child your life partner gives birth to isn\u2019t your biological child. Even if it is your biological child, their talent is very poor. They have no potential at all. They will be a trash for the rest of their lives!!!\u201dWhen he shouted this, Wang Hu was overjoyed. He couldn\u2019t help but look at Xuan Yi\u2019s sedan chair.In the martial arts practice field, countless male cultivators directly broke through their defences.\u201cWhat vicious words!\u201d\u201cWhy do these words keep reverberating in my mind? Who is this person trying to play tricks?\u201d\u201cListen, who could have said such things?\u201d\u201cMy born child isn\u2019t even your own, I\u2019ll spit out blood!\u201d\u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t have talent, he\u2019s still trash!!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of person would think of such vicious words!\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that a normal person can think of!\u201d\u201cToo vicious, I remember it all. In the future, if I see anyone I\u2019m not happy with, I\u2019ll scold him like this!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dThe group of disciples rushed out aggressively.Outside the door, Wang Hu did not expect the effect to be so good.He had just shouted for a long time, but there was no response. However, the strength of the telepathic voice transmission technique was that they couldn\u2019t care less.This made Wang Hu\u2019s admiration for Xuan Yi deepen.Not only the disciples, even the elders of the Crossing Immortal sect were shocked by this curse.One of them was an elder who was in seclusion to break through.\u201cWho dares to preach at the Crossing Immortal sect!\u201d\u201cI was in closed-door cultivation, and I actually heard someone say that I couldn\u2019t find a female cultivator!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. I also heard someone say that my born child wasn\u2019t my own!\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t know who said such abusive words. These words forcefully pulled me out of my closed-door cultivation.\u201dWhen this elder heard this, his blood pressure immediately rose. He didn\u2019t even have the mood to continue the closed-door cultivation.\u201cI want to see who dares to insult our Crossing Immortal sect.\u201dHe emphasised the words \u2018Crossing Immortal sect\u2019 extremely heavily. After all, they were the elders of the Crossing Immortal sect, so they had a strong sense of belonging. They even felt that the Crossing Immortal sect being insulted was equivalent to them being insulted.A group of people rushed out aggressively.Outside the gate of the immortal sect, there was a youth and a carriage.They took a look and then shifted their gaze to another place.\u201cWho is it! Who dares to insult our Crossing Immortal sect? Come out and face your death!\u201dThey very casually ignored Wang Hu.Although Wang Hu\u2019s body was still stained with blood, he really didn\u2019t seem like someone who dared to insult their Crossing Immortal sect.Why.Because this young man was too ordinary.So ordinary that other than the bloodstains on his body, he didn\u2019t attract their attention at all.And the carriage behind was even more ordinary.There were still people riding in the carriage now?Didn\u2019t the cultivator fly?There were actually still cultivators who rode carriage?Because they didn\u2019t want to attract too much attention, the aura of the stallion was also concealed by Xuan Yi.Therefore, at this moment, they were like ordinary mortals, the only extraordinary thing was the bloodstains on their bodies.Although the carriage was very luxurious, but in the eyes of these cultivators, it was just an ordinary thing. It didn\u2019t attract their attention at all, even if it was just a glance.\u201cDid he run away?\u201d\u201cYour guess is possible.\u201d\u201cCoward!\u201dCountless disciples of the Crossing Immortal sect cursed one after another.The elders also lost interest, regretting why they couldn\u2019t help but come out of seclusion just now.When Wang Hu saw that they were about to leave, he opened his mouth and shouted, \u201cWait!\u201dEveryone completely ignored him.Wang Hu became anxious and did not know how to stop them for a moment.Wang Hu immediately opened his mouth and shouted, \u201cYou all are also trash!\u201d\u201cSwoosh!\u201dThey all turned their heads around.\u201cHiss!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d\u201cQuickly catch him, don\u2019t let him escape!\u201dWang Hu was still a little flustered after being stared at by so many gazes.\u201cLittle b*stard, you\u2019re going to heaven!\u201dSuddenly, a voice shouted at them.\u201cStop!\u201d\u201cThe sect master is here, it\u2019s the sect master.\u201dKu Du had a head of white hair, and his body carried an aged aura.He knew that the person who could control the telepathic voice transmission was either an expert or someone with a profound background. No matter which one it was, this matter wouldn\u2019t be so easy to resolve, so he personally went out.No one dared to underestimate his strength.A law enforcement realm expert, the top notch of the entire crossing immortal sect!His appearance attracted the attention of all the disciples.There was another person who appeared with Ku Du. This person\u2019s aura was gloomy, and it was obvious that he was not from a reputable sect.He kept a low profile and stood behind Ku Du.Moreover, later on, he planned to put on a show and use the Yin Corpse Sect\u2019s reputation to scare off the people who came to find trouble.Thinking of the countless disciples\u2019 shocked scenes, he was filled with great anticipation.However, looking at the youth in front of the carriage, he suddenly felt a bit familiar, as if he had seen him somewhere before, but he couldn\u2019t recall where.\u201cAre you the sect master of the Crossing Immortal Sect?\u201dWang Hu pulled out his big axe, held it horizontally, and glared at him.\u201cHand over Wang Juan!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: 71The members of the Crossing Immortal sect didn\u2019t know who Wang Juan was. They were all clamoring to teach Wang Hu a lesson.Ku Du was very clear in his heart.At this moment, Wang Juan was in the sect. Ku Du didn\u2019t know how to deal with this matter.This was because Great Elder and ye Wuji, this pair of genius master and disciple, had been killed by Wang Hu.Since they had been killed, there was no point in taking revenge at this moment. There was simply no way to recover the losses. Moreover, once a great battle started, it would inevitably result in casualties. The Crossing Immortal sect didn\u2019t have many disciples to begin with.He didn\u2019t want to fight with Wang Hu again.However, as the biggest force in Qingfeng City, Wang Hu came here to challenge them, and he let Wang Juan go, it wouldn\u2019t be good for his reputation. It was as if a random small character came to the Crossing Immortal sect, then he appeared to be extremely afraid. Who would be willing to join in the future?Therefore, Ku Du was very clear in his heart.He could let her go.But before letting her go, he had to regain the face of the Crossing Immortal sect.This was also the reason why he brought an elder of the Yin corpse sect here.Because he had guessed that Wang Hu\u2019s background must be extraordinary. He was probably from one of the big sects in the southern region. Otherwise, he would not have such strength, and the Yin Corpse sect was even more famous. If Wang Hu was not stupid, he would obediently submit.Then, Ku du once again could show his righteousness and let Wang Juan go.He not only saved face, but also resolved this matter.Ku Du was very confident because the Yin Corpse sect was indeed famous. It was one of the top existences in the entire southern region. Of course, the most terrifying thing was the Yin Corpse Sect\u2019s skills and methods. They refined people into corpses to fight for them.This method was too cruel, so very few people were willing to become enemies with the Yin Corpse sect. It was fine if they won, but if they lost, they would face the fate of being refined into corpses. They couldn\u2019t even be able to die.Although the Yin Corpse sect was only an elder, Ku Du was very clear that this elder\u2019s strength was an existence that even he couldn\u2019t compare to.He dared to conclude that as long as the Yin Corpse Sect\u2019s elder announced his identity, there was no need for him to make a move at all, and this youth would obediently submit.It wasn\u2019t just the Yin Corpse Sect\u2019s elder who thought this way.Thus, Ku Du pressed his hand down, indicating for the disciples to calm down.He then stood out and casually asked, \u201cYoung man, do you know that the two people you killed, one was our genius elder, and the other was our genius disciple!\u201dKu Du asked sternly, the gloominess in his eyes was not concealed at all.However, as long as he knew that there was no point in taking revenge now, everything he did was just to save face for the Crossing Immortal sect.However, Wang Hu did not think so. He felt that since he was here to save his person, then Ku Du should hand her out first so that they could have a chance to talk. Otherwise, they could only fight.\u201cI don\u2019t know, but to be honest, those two people are a little too weak! Are they the geniuses of your Crossing Immortal Sect?\u201dWang Hu\u2019s wave of mockery made Ku Du\u2019s gaze turn colder.They were still fine. After all, they already knew the whole story.But the disciples did not know.At this moment, when the disciples heard these contents, they were all shocked on the spot!What\u2026what\u2026The Great Elder and Ye Wuji died?They couldn\u2019t believe their ears.These were the two strongest people in their sect. They were the most talented and the strongest. The Great Elder even had a chance to surpass the sect master.These two experts died?!Furthermore, from what they heard, they died in the hands of this young man.And this young man even said that they were too weak?Shocking!Everyone was shocked!Great Elder and Ye Wuji\u2019s talent were the top notch of the Crossing Immortal sect!They had actually been killed by this young man!They could not imagine how terrifying this young man was!In fact, they did not believe it at all!How was it possible? They were clear of Great Elder\u2019s strength!\u201cThe death of Great Elder and Ye Wuji is irreparable. However, I take into account that you are a youth and do not know your limits. As long as you kneel down and admit your mistake, I will forgive you.\u201dKu Du said this.These words made countless disciples of the Crossing Immortal sect unable to understand.At this moment, they believed in the death of the Great Elder and Ye Wuji. However, it was clearly the Great Elder and Ye Wuji who were killed. As the sect master of the Crossing Immortal Sect, shouldn\u2019t you stand up for the dead and fight to the death with this young man?Most likely, even killing the young man would be a light punishment.But what did the sect master say now?He actually wanted to forgive this young man.As long as he kneeled down and admitted his mistake.This made them very puzzled.Of course, there were also some smart disciples who guessed a little.They felt that the background of this young man was definitely not ordinary. Otherwise, Ku Du would not have dealt with him in this way.And the reason for doing so was probably just to retain some of the face of the Crossing Immortal sect.Now they had no choice but to take it seriously.However, there were also many disciples who were not convinced. Since the Great Elder had died at the hands of the young man Wang Hu, then they should let Wang Hu pay with his life.\u201cSect master, isn\u2019t it too light to kneel and admit his mistake?\u201d\u201cYeah, just what he said just now was enough to make him die!\u201d\u201cSect master, we can\u2019t leave this person alive!\u201d\u201cKill him! Kill him!\u201d\u201cSect master has the heart of a Bodhisattva, then let me kill him!\u201dAn elder rushed out, but before he could reach Wang Hu, a sword light flashed in front of him.Then, he froze on the spot.Terrifying!Incomparably terrifying!It was as if there was a pair of eyes in the sky staring at him.It was also as if there was a mystery in the abyss.He only felt that his entire body was drenched in cold sweat.If he had not dodged that attack quickly, he would have died.However, this attack did not have the intention of killing him. Otherwise, his head would have already been separated from his body. That attack just now was to threaten their entire Crossing Immortal sect.If you dare to act recklessly, your entire sect will be destroyed.The sword energy flew past and sliced the Crossing Immortal sect\u2019s plaque in half.The entire place was silent!Because no one saw how this attack had appeared!This proved that the person who had attacked was so powerful that it was unfathomable!And to slice apart the plaque in front of Ku Du was an undisguised threat.The person who had attacked did not even put the people from the Crossing Immortal sect in his eyes.Even Ku Du was an existence that he looked down on.How terrifying!They searched everywhere, but didn\u2019t feel any spiritual energy fluctuations, and there wasn\u2019t anyone around.In the end, their gazes fell on the sedan chair behind Wang Hu.They couldn\u2019t help but suspect that this sword attack was made by the person in the sedan chair, but after thinking about it, they shook their heads.How could it be? If it was the person in the sedan chair, then there must have been spiritual energy fluctuations.Ku Du was so angry that his lips began to tremble.Contempt!He was completely looked down upon.As long as the person who made the move paid any attention to him, he would not cut the Crossing Immortal sect\u2019s signboard into half in front of him.He forcefully suppressed the anger in his heart. \u201cAll of you, stand down!\u201dAt this time, all the elders and disciples also realized that the Crossing Immortal sect was in trouble.It was a trouble that even a sect master had to admit to.\u201cYou killed an elder of my sect and also a disciple of my sect. Is there anything wrong with me asking you to kneel down and admit your mistake?\u201d Ku du said word by word with anger.Wang Hu said coldly, \u201cLet Wang Juan go and I will leave some lives for the Crossing Immortal sect.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: 72Chapter 72: Jian WutianWhat Wang Hu meant was to leave some people alive, not to be easy on the Crossing Immortal sect. This meant that regardless of whether to released or not, a battle would occur. According to Wang Hu\u2019s meaning, he wanted to kill, but not exterminate.What did he mean by leaving a few stalks of grass for revenge?Did he not know that the spring breeze would blow and grow again?A few small saplings could also grow into towering trees.However, from these words, it was not difficult to see that Wang Hu was very confident!Where did this confidence come from?Xuan Yi!He believed that as long as he was good enough to learn from Xuan Yi, then no genius could increase his cultivation faster than him.Moreover, after Ku Du heard these words, he continued to endure his anger. He knew that this matter would be difficult to resolve with words. The only way was to defeat Wang Hu.However, this defeat was not a group attack. This was not because he was noble, but because only by letting his disciple defeat Wang Hu would he be able to cut off his edge and obediently do as he said.\u201cHow about this? I\u2019ll let a disciple compete with you, then if you lose, follow my instructions, kneel down and kowtow to admit your mistake, and then I\u2019ll let Wang Juan go.\u201d\u201cWhat if you lose?\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d Ku Du smiled. Just as he was about to speak, a loud shout came from afar. \u201cIf I lose, then I\u2019ll kneel down and kowtow to admit my mistake. I\u2019ll also let the so-called Wang Juan go.\u201dA figure flew over from afar.All the disciples cheered when they saw this figure.This was an existence that was on par with Ye Wuji. In fact, he was even stronger than Ye Wuji, Xiao Ke!There were also quite a number of disciples who revealed puzzled expressions. This was because this Xiao Ke did not often appear in the sect. As the only personal disciple of the sect master, he hid outside to train.This time, he coincidentally returned to the sect and encountered such a matter.Ku Du naturally had the same intention.He did not want to have a big battle with Wang Hu. If he won big, others would definitely say that he was bullying the weak. Moreover, if all the disciples went up, people would say that they were attacking in a group. Therefore, it was only fair to use one disciple to defeat Wang Hu.Of course, this was the only way to motivate Wang Hu to agree to the bet.If Xiao Ke was not in the sect, he would never say such words.Because, other than Xiao Ke, he really did not believe that any disciple in the sect could beat Wang Hu.Just now, he had already checked Wang Hu\u2019s cultivation.Golden elixir phase.Xiao Ke had been in the golden elixir phase for many years. Compared to Wang Hu, who just entered the golden elixir phase, Xiao Ke was definitely much stronger.Once Xiao Ke won, then this matter would be easily resolved. He would have face, but he also appeared magnanimous.The reason why Ku Du didn\u2019t dare to do anything to Wang Hu was entirely because his worry about Wang Hu\u2019s background.That sword attack just now was very terrifying!This made him subconsciously take a look at the sedan chair and scan it with his spiritual sense, but he didn\u2019t find anything. From this, it could be seen that the person in the sedan chair was definitely not ordinary.\u201cGood! I\u2019ll take It!\u201d\u201cClang Clang Clang\u201dA supreme-grade spirit sword was thrown out from the sedan chair.\u201cUse the weapon you\u2019re good at.\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201dWang Hu was not good at axes, but axes were more reckless. He liked to be clean and neat.And now that Xuan Yi threw out a sword, this meant that this opponent was not weak.Moreover, he also held a supreme-grade spirit weapon in his hand. Presumably, it was for the sake of fairness.Wang Hu received the sword. In an instant, a strong sense of confidence surged up. He dared to say that this person could not withstand three of his sword strikes. If he used his full strength, this person would not even be able to withstand one sword strike.\u201cWhat, a supreme-grade spirit weapon!\u201d\u201cIt was just casually thrown to the ground!\u201dWang Hu said calmly, \u201cAdmit defeat! You can\u2019t beat me!\u201dThe disciples had not yet recovered from the shock of this supreme-grade spirit weapon that was casually thrown out, yet they were once again shocked by this sentence.Why?This was Ku Du\u2019s disciple, his only personal disciple!They believed that even if Xiao Ke fought the elder now, he might not lose!With such strength, why did Wang Hu say that Xiao Ke could not beat him?\u201cHmph! Arrogant!\u201dXiao Ke used all his energy to fly away, in mid-air.Wang Hu drew his sword and slashed out. In an instant, a powerful sword intent locked onto Xiao Ke.His forehead was instantly covered in cold sweat.This terrifying aura!The embryonic form of sword intent!He was also a sword cultivator, so he naturally knew that the most powerful part of a sword cultivator was sword intent. However, in the past hundreds of years, very few people had comprehended sword intent. Just the embryonic form of sword intent was something that many geniuses could not comprehend. Even the number one person in the entire Crossing Immortal sect, had not comprehended the embryonic form of sword intent.A powerful sword intent attacked. Xiao Ke\u2019s eyes were round and he could not believe it. Under the powerful lock of the sword intent, he had no way of dodging.Therefore, he brought out all the treasures on him.\u201cBoom\u201dA fiery light exploded in the sky.Xiao Ke landed on the ground and his body kept twitching.His head gradually became dizzy. Just as he was about to faint, a voice sounded in his mind, fortunately. Fortunately, he had enough treasures on him. Otherwise, this sword alone would have been enough to take his life.Terrifying!He did not dare to imagine what would have happened to him if he had been careless just now. Just thinking about it made him shudder.The sword struck out, and the entire place was silent.Was this\u2026 a strong person?Was this a monster?No, it should be said that he was a monster among monsters!Compared to him, senior brother Xiao Ke was simply trash!Even Ku Du was stunned on the spot. He never thought that his disciple, whom he was proud of, could not even withstand a single blow from Wang Hu.He looked gloomily at Xiao Ke on the ground. His face was dark as he planned how to deal with this matter and how to end it.Just as he was about to bring the Yin Corpse sect out, a strange sound came from the sky.In the sky, sword cultivator, Jian Wutian!This was a famous sword cultivator in the southern region. It was rumored that he had once comprehended the embryonic form of sword intent.He was very talented. Coupled with his unconventional personality, he often traveled around the southern region. Therefore, there were many people in the entire southern region who knew of him.Jian Wutian was flying on his sword, lazily lying on it, drinking wine.Suddenly, a powerful sword intent shot into the sky, making his originally lazy body tense up.Others only knew that he traveled around the southern region, but they did not know that his travels were just a cover. In fact, he was looking for a disciple with great talent.This powerful sword intent instantly made him more energetic.\u201cJian Wutian!\u201dKu Du frowned and prepared to not bring out the Yin corpse sect\u2019s name for now.\u201cAy, tsk tsk, not bad, not bad.\u201dJian Wutian flew down from the sky and instantly arrived in front of Wang Hu.Wang Hu\u2019s talent made him very satisfied. Although he didn\u2019t notice that Wang Hu\u2019s physique was special, just the embryonic form of the sword intent just now already proved Wang Hu\u2019s talent.He nodded in satisfaction. \u201cKid, I\u2019m Jian Wutian. Are you interested in being my disciple?\u201dA confident smile hung on his face. Jian Wutian\u2019s name was still very well-known in the southern region.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: 73Chapter 73: \u201cYou are not worthy to be my master!\u201d!Jian Wutian\u2019s cultivation was very strong. He had already reached the first level of the law enforcement realm. This was an extremely terrifying talent in the entire southern region. He could become an elder in any sect.His talent was far more than that. The most powerful talent was his sword principle.He had comprehended sword intent at the age of 30. Although it was only the beginning, Lin Jian\u2019s strength, which was comparable to that of a sect master expert, had only comprehended a trace of sword intent.From this, it could be seen that Jian Wutian was extraordinarily talented.When Ku Du heard his words, his expression changed slightly.If Wang Hu accepted Jian Wutian as his master, then he wouldn\u2019t be able to make Wang Hu kneel down.However, Wang Hu\u2019s next words made him overjoyed.\u201cJian Wutian? Who is it? You are not worthy to be my master.\u201dJian Wutian was displeased on the spot, but in order to accept Wang Hu, a disciple with terrifying talent, he had to endure it, he continued to induce, \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you haven\u2019t heard of me, but I see that you are a sword cultivator, and I am also a sword cultivator. I can teach you how to condense sword intent. Secondly, do you know my background? I dare say that in the entire southern region, there aren\u2019t many who have more treasures than me. Don\u2019t you understand? Becoming my disciple will have a bright future for you.\u201dWang Hu still shook his head.At this moment, a powerful sword intent suddenly rushed out of the sedan chair.In an instant, the sky turned dark.Jian Wutian felt his legs go weak.\u201cPlop\u201dJian Wutian could not bear the pressure and knelt on the ground.This scene shocked most people.The disciples of the Crossing Immortal sect were stunned speechless,others might not know, but Ku Du did!Jian Wutian was an existence in the law enforcement realm. If he fought, he would be able to contend against the sect master of the Crossing Immortal sect!He knew that the person in the sedan chair was very strong, but he only felt that he was on the same level as him, or even weaker than him.But he was wrong, extremely wrong.The person in the sedan chair forced Jian Wutian, who was in the first level of the law enforcement realm, to kneel on the ground with just a wave of pressure. What kind of strength was this!An elder of the Yin Corpse sect was also shocked. Such a terrifying expert was hidden in the sedan chair!He had never heard of such an expert in the southern region!The disciples of the Crossing Immortal sect who recognized Jian Wutian were even more dumbfounded.They knew how strong Jian Wutian was, and he was the idol of many sword cultivators.Yet he couldn\u2019t withstand a single wave of pressure.He didn\u2019t even make a single move!Just a wave of pressure was enough to make this famous sword cultivator unable to stand up.\u201cSenior, please calm down! Jian Wutian doesn\u2019t have any ill intentions!\u201dAfter the overwhelming pressure dissipated, Jian Wutian only felt that the huge pressure had disappeared, and the terrifying power had finally disappeared. His face was filled with shock, and he secretly heaved a few sighs of relief.Fortunately, he had submitted early!Otherwise, he really did not know if he would be able to keep his life!His clothes were drenched in sweat, and he stood up trembling. He breathed in the fresh air, and his eyes were filled with fear and dread as he looked at the sedan chair!This was the first time since he was born, especially after he stepped into the law enforcement realm, that he had encountered such a crushing force without any resistance!Xuan Yi in the sedan chair did not want to kill him. He just wanted to teach him a lesson.At this moment, Jian Wutian\u2019s gaze was no longer arrogant. He had already realized that the person in the sedan chair was probably Wang Hu\u2019s master. No wonder Wang Hu did not want to acknowledge him as his master.It turned out that his master was truly powerful.It was not that Jian Wutian had never seen powerful sword cultivators. Lin Jian and Qing Xuzi were both famous sword cultivators in the southern region. However, he did not feel the terrifying aura of Xuan Yi from either of them.It was likely that the people in the sedan chair had long surpassed Lin Jian and Qing Xuzi!Unintentionally, the curtains moved slightly and Xuan Yi\u2019s fair face was revealed.Jian Wutian just happened to catch this scene.The shock in his heart was self-evident\u2026He looked like he was only 20 years old!He had actually reached such a terrifying level at such a young age!As for those so-called favored ones, compared to Xuan Yi\u2026It was better not to compare. The two were completely incomparable.Such talent would probably be among the top geniuses in the entire continent!Jian Wutian only felt that Wang Hu would be better if Xuan Yi taught him. The confidence that he had cultivated for many years completely collapsed when he met Xuan Yi!After being taught a lesson, Jian Wutian was obviously much more obedient. He did not mention the matter of taking in disciples anymore. Instead, he stood respectfully not far from the sedan chair.He did not know what was happening in front of him, but when he noticed the black figure behind Ku Du, he frowned slightly.Why were the people from the Yin Corpse sect here.It seemed that the people from the Yin Corpse sect were on Ku Du\u2019s side. If that was the case, then the situation of the young man was not good.After all, the existence of the Yin Corpse sect was something that many people in the southern region did not dare to provoke!\u201cSect master Ku, are you going to raise your sect against a young man?\u201d Jian Wutian laughed.Ku Du laughed, \u201cWhat are you talking about? It\u2019s just that this young man has some grudges with our Crossing Immortal Sect.\u201dWang Hu\u2019s face darkened, \u201cDoes sect master Ku Du\u2019s words still stand?\u201d\u201cOf course! I just released Wang Juan, but the elders of the Yin Corpse sect took a liking to her physique and captured her.\u201dAs soon as these words were said, Wang Hu\u2019s eyes turned completely cold.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Wang Juan\u2019s physique is indeed the best material to refine corpse soldiers.\u201dWang Hu\u2019s tiger eyes became fierce when he heard those words.\u201cKu Du and I have been good friends for many years. I think about what happened today, as long as you admit your mistake, I will release Wang Juan.\u201dHe and Ku Du had already reached a consensus long ago. They only asked Wang Hu to admit his mistake and would release Wang Juan.In fact, this was to let Ku du preserve a bit of face.It really didn\u2019t matter if he let Wang Juan go or not.But if he let her go just like that, others would say that there was no one in their Crossing Immortal sect and that they were scared by a young man.But they also knew how terrifying the person in the sedan chair was, so they changed the kneeling to admitting their mistake.Yin Ling, an elder of the Yin Corpse Sect, was sure that as long as releasing the name of the Yin Corpse sect, Wang Hu would admit his mistake. After all, the Yin Corpse Sect\u2019s name was still very strong.However, he never expected that Wang Hu would not recognize the Yin Corpse sect. Instead, he smiled disdainfully.\u201cYin Corpse Sect?\u201d\u201cA despicable sect with despicable means. They actually dare to say it in public.\u201dYin Ling had a feeling that he had seen this young man somewhere before, but he could not remember for a moment.At this moment, seeing that the name of the Yin Corpse sect still did not make Wang Hu yield, he was slightly surprised.The Yin Corpse sect was a synonym for death in the entire southern region.This kid had big ambitious, or had eaten a leopard\u2019s guts to actually ignore the Yin Corpse sect!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74: 74Chapter 74: Xuan Yi\u2019s methodsYin Ling raised his head and glared at Wang Hu.Not only was Yin Ling shocked by Wang Hu\u2019s words, even the surrounding disciples were shocked.They could accept Wang Hu\u2019s rejection of Jian Wutian. After all, Jian Wutian did not belong to any sect and did not have any background. However, Yin Ling had the Yin Corpse sect behind him!Yin Ling was ready to teach this young man a lesson.However, he had just taken a step forward when he froze on the spot.This was because Xuan Yi had walked down from the sedan chair.He was indifferent, calm, and did not show any emotions on his face.In fact, with just a casual glance, he had stunned everyone present.He was handsome.What shocked them even more was his age.They thought that the person who could suppress Jian Wutian to the point that he could not stand should be an old man.However, they did not expect Xuan Yi to be so young.He looked to be only in his twenties, even younger than Xiao Ke from their sect.He had a disciple already?He became a master at such an age?Not only that, even Jian Wutian, who had been famous for a long time, was suppressed by his suppression. This meant that this person was very strong.However, they could not guess how strong he was.The moment Xuan Yi appeared, Yin Ling was stunned on the spot.He finally remembered when he had met Wang Hu. It was in the mystic realm some time ago.Wang Hu had directly received the imperial class inheritance, and all the disciples of the Yin Corpse Sect had died in battle.At that time, he had witnessed the entire process in the mystic realm.He knew how terrifying Xuan Yi was.Not only that, after returning from the mystic realm, the sect master of the Yin Corpse sect had ordered down the sect not to become enemies with Xuan Yi. Even if Xuan Yi was in the wrong first, he had to endure it.At that time, Yin Ling didn\u2019t dare to believe that such words came from the sect master\u2019s mouth.One had to know that the Yin Corpse sect had always been like that. Regardless of right or wrong, they must not be at a disadvantage and must fight to the end with other cultivators.Overbearing and despicable, these were the principles of their Yin Corpse sect.However, this time, the sect master had ordered not to provoke Xuan Yi.What did this mean? It meant that the sect master was very wary of Xuan Yi!He did not know much about Xuan Yi. He only knew that he was a genius who had given away the imperial class inheritance at will. However, he knew his sect master very well. He had never seen his sect master gave such serious instructions.This proved that Xuan Yi was not to be trifled with.\u201cSo it\u2019s Elder Xuan!\u201dYin Ling was quick-witted. He cupped his hands humbly.\u201cYou want to attack my disciple?\u201dXuan Yi looked at him calmly.Yin Ling\u2019s body trembled. Then, he chuckled, \u201cElder Xuan, you misunderstood. Why would I attack your beloved disciple? It\u2019s just that your disciple said something unpleasant just now, so I corrected him a little.\u201dYin Ling was already panicking, but with so many eyes looking at him, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to admit defeat.Even so, his aura was still much weaker.This scene surprised Ku Du and the disciples of the Crossing Immortal sect.\u201cWho is this person!\u201d\u201cHow could he make such an elder of the Yin Corpse Sect so afraid?\u201dXuan Yi spoke again, \u201cDo I need you to correct my disciple\u2019s actions?\u201dThen, a flying sword flew out at such a fast speed that countless disciples couldn\u2019t see the blade of the sword. All they could see was an afterimage flying past.In the next breath, Yin Ling\u2019s arm was cut off by the sword energy.One arm fell to the ground.Yin Ling\u2019s left shoulder was empty.\u201cHiss!\u201dCutting off another person\u2019s arm at the slightest disagreement!How overbearing was this!Just as everyone was shocked by Xuan Yi\u2019s methods, only Ku Du saw something different.He knew very well what level Yin Ling was at.But now, his arm had actually been cut off without even dodging.It was not hard to imagine how terrifying this young looking Elder Xuan\u2019s strength had reached!Yin Ling was shocked, but he did not show any anger. He only glared fiercely at Xuan Yi and continued, \u201cElder Xuan, I was wrong. I admit my mistake. I really don\u2019t know how many enemies Elder Xuan will provoke by doing this. Elder Xuan, when you travel in the southern region in the future, you have to be more careful!\u201dThat\u2019s right, Yin Ling had given in.He had shamelessly given in to the powerful Xuan Yi.But before he left, he left a threatening tone.Of course, it could also be understood that he said this to save some face. In fact, Xuan Yi\u2019s strength was not something he could touch!Even the sect master of the Yin Corpse Sect was afraid of him, so how could he dare to touch him.What made him extremely regretful was that he should not have gotten involved in this mess. Not only did he offend Xuan Yi, but he also lost half of his arm. The problem was that he had yet to gain any benefits.After Yin Ling left, Ku Du also understood that he would definitely not be able to retain his face today. Thus, he directly bent down and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that Elder Xuan was here. Please forgive me for my shortcomings!\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s Wang Juan?\u201d\u201cRelease her immediately. I guarantee that she is unharmed!\u201dAs he spoke, he gestured for the elder behind him to bring Wang Juan over.Very soon, a woman dressed in rustic clothes was brought out.Wang Hu was overjoyed when he saw her. The two of them hugged each other.\u201cElder Xuan\u2026\u201dSeeing that Xuan Yi was still standing in the same spot, Ku Du did not understand Xuan Yi\u2019s intentions.Since she was released, then quickly leave!Why still standing there!Xuan Yi said softly, \u201cKneel down, admit your mistakes, and I will let your Crossing Immortal sect alive!\u201dWhen he said this, the entire place was in an uproar!Wasn\u2019t this person too overbearing!After letting Wang Juan go, it was fine if he didn\u2019t leave, but he still wanted their sect master to kneel down!Overbearing!This word flashed through countless people\u2019s minds.But while being overbearing, being ignorance and arrogance at the same time!He, sect master Ku du, might not be able to defeat Xuan Yi, but which sect didn\u2019t have some trump cards?Was Xuan Yi forcing sect master Ku Du to use his trump cards?\u201cI say it again, kneel down and admit your mistake, and let your Crossing Immortal sect alive!\u201dKu Du\u2019s gaze turned ruthless, \u201cDon\u2019t go too far!\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s lips curled up slightly, \u201cLooks like you\u2019re not willing to kneel!\u201dThen, a sword intent came from the sky, and the entire Crossing Immortal sect was enveloped by this aura.Countless sword energies were like a huge net, attacking in all directions. Many disciples didn\u2019t even close their eyes when they died.Xuan Yi kept waving the holy sword in his hand.This sword was brought out from the mystic realm. It was a holy item!An extremely terrifying aura was emitted from it.Each sword strike took a life.The blood dyed the entire Crossing Immortal sect red. Looking at the people whose lives were taken by the sword light, Jian Wutian felt a stifling feeling in his heart. This method was really fierce!Even he, who had seen many killings, could not help but feel a chill down his spine.No matter how much the disciples of the Crossing Immortal sect begged for mercy, the sword light did not have any intention of stopping.At this moment, everyone understood.It was not that Xuan Yi did not do nothing at first, but felt that the matter could be solved with gentle means.But Ku Du did not cherish it!\u201cElder Xuan, you!\u201d\u201cI kneel!\u201d\u201cI kneel!\u201dKu Du shouted loudly, but no matter how he shouted, Xuan Yi acted as if he did not hear him.Ku Du understood!Today, Xuan Yi was going to wipe out his entire family!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: 75Chapter 75: sect exterminationHe was afraid, but no one would stop him. Xuan Yi had no intention of stopping.The Crossing Immortal sect was stained with blood.Overnight, the entire Crossing Immortal sect evaporated into thin air.From then on, the Crossing Immortal sect no longer existed in the world.And this day was the bloodiest scene Jian Wutian had ever seen since he was born.He was extremely glad that he did not confront Xuan Yi head-on. Otherwise, his ending would not be any better than the Crossing Immortal sect\u2019s.On the first day, the news spread throughout the entire Qingfeng city.The extermination of the Crossing Immortal sect caused countless people to be shocked!After the shock, they deeply remembered a sentence.That was, don\u2019t provoke a horse rider in the Qingfeng city, much less a sedan chair.After this incident happened, no one sat in a sedan chair in the Qingfeng city for many years.Moreover, when they saw a sedan chair walking on the street, they hid far away.Then there was Xuan Yi.After settling the matter of the Crossing Immortal sect, the master and disciple set off on the journey to the Middle East.Wang Juan was sent to the Xuan Sword sect by Wang Hu for cultivation.Wang Juan\u2019s physique was very poor, so Xuan Yi did not take her in as a disciple.Wang Hu begged for a long time, Xuan Yi then recommended Wang Juan to an elder of the Xuan Sword sect.A few days later.At this moment, in the wild forest.Wang Hu was carrying a huge demonic beast.The fire qilin python.This was a level two demonic beast, and its strength was equivalent to that of a human cultivator at the foundation phase.Xuan Yi sat on the sedan chair and closed his eyes to rest.Wang Hu set a fire on the side and placed the fire qilin python that had been divided into many parts on it.There were many demonic beasts in the wild forest.Among them, there were some powerful demonic beasts. This fire qilin python was only considered a medium existence here.Moreover, it was a demonic beast that had already given birth to a demonic core.Demonic cores were the essence of demonic beasts. Not only could they be used as medicinal ingredients for medicinal pills, but there were also some powerful demonic cores that could be directly swallowed. It was extremely helpful to the cultivation of cultivators.There were even some demonic cores that contained the demonic skills of demonic beasts when they were alive.This was the same existence as the martial skills of human cultivators, but it was even more terrifying than the martial skills of human cultivators.The demonic core in the body of this fire qilin python didn\u2019t have any demonic skills.It only contained a decent amount of spiritual energy.Wang Hu casually threw the demonic core into his storage bag.\u201cTrash.\u201dEven Wang Hu thought that it was trash, So Xuan Yi naturally looked down on it even more.\u201cMaster, the meat of this demonic beast is very fragrant. It\u2019s much more tender than the green bull demonic meat we ate yesterday.\u201dIn fact, both of their cultivations had already reached the point where they didn\u2019t need to eat, which was the same as fasting.However, in order to train Wang Hu for battles, they fought a lot of demonic beasts, and the meat of the demonic beasts would go bad after a long time. Thus, Xuan Yi taught Wang Hu how to barbecue.After eating this meat, it was good for a cultivator\u2019s body and was very helpful.Soon, the smell of barbecue permeated the air.\u201cMaster, How was my barbecue this time?\u201dXuan Yi shook his head lightly. \u201cIt was average.\u201dHowever, he still picked it up and took a bite. To be honest, it was average for Xuan Yi. However, for Wang Hu, who had never studied cooking, it could be said to be a delicacy in the world.Xuan Yi only ate a few mouthfuls before throwing the fire qilin python\u2019s meat to the side.\u201cMaster, I think it\u2019s not bad!\u201dWang Hu Wolfed down a lot of pieces.The fragrance made him drool. As he bit into his mouth, it was like a flower bud blooming in his mouth. The fragrance of the meat filled his entire brain.\u201cIt\u2019s too fragrant.\u201dWang Hu chewed on a few pieces of the fire qilin python\u2019s meat until his stomach could no longer hold it. Then, he stopped.He closed his eyes and digested it. After a while, he opened his eyes and a bright light burst out.\u201cMaster, I\u2019ve broken through!\u201dThe meats of demonic beasts were very helpful to cultivators. After eating the meats of demonic beasts for a few days, Wang Hu\u2019s cultivation advanced by leaps and bounds and he soon broke through to the second level of the golden elixir phase.Xuan Yi nodded his head. At this rate, Wang Hu would probably be able to advance to the law enforcement realm in no time. At that time, his chances of winning the battle with Lin Jian would be even greater.Wang Hu was also looking forward to it. He wanted to see if he, this trash, would be able to stun the entire crowd.This battle was a battle that everyone was watching. If he lost, Xuan Yi\u2019s halo would disappear.Xuan Yi would no longer be the most talented master. He might even lose face.Therefore, Wang Hu cultivated desperately because he was worried that he would lose the battle with Lin Jian.In the depths of the wild forest.Two women and two men were running wildly.And behind them was an extremely ferocious tiger.This tiger had a single horn on its forehead, and there were several wounds on its face.Its body was much bigger than an ordinary tiger, and its color was black.If someone with a better understanding of demonic beasts saw it, they would definitely be shocked. This was because it was a three-eyed tiger, and its aura was extremely powerful.The three-eyed tiger was born as a level one demonic beast. When it was young, it was already a level two demonic beast, and when it matured, it reached a terrifying level three.Following behind these people was an adult three-eyed tiger.\u201cPrincess, I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be able to escape this time!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll protect you all!\u201d One of the men said.Their cultivations weren\u2019t strong, and the highest one was only an old man at the foundation phase.One of the other three was a princess, who was only at the fifth level of the energy condensation stage.Her servant\u2019s cultivation was even lower.As for the other young cultivator, his cultivation was about the same as the one who was called the princess.The situation was extremely critical, and the oldest elder\u2019s aura surged. He said with a solemn face, \u201cPrincess, you guys go first. I will block a few breaths for you!\u201dA third level was equivalent to a human\u2019s golden elixir phase. This was not something that a foundation phase old man could block.The princess\u2019s face was filled with anxiety. This was the servant who had served her since she was young. Their relationship was as deep as that of a family member.Even though the situation was critical, she was still unwilling to let this \u201cfamily member\u201d die.However, there was no other way.\u201cYou guys go first!\u201dThe old man\u2019s aura soared. It could be seen that he had already erupted with the blood essence in his body.\u201cYiyi, let\u2019s go quickly!\u201dThe life-risking man pulled at the princess.The princess called Yiyi had a tense expression, but she didn\u2019t insist. If they didn\u2019t leave, they would all stay here.\u201cPrincess, leave quickly!\u201dWith these words, the old man charged at the enormous three-eyed tiger. With just a collision, the old man was knocked out by the ferocious three-eyed tiger. Then, the three-eyed tiger didn\u2019t chase after the three people.Instead, it turned around and rushed towards the old man.In its eyes, this was just food.Following the old man who was sent flying backwards, the three-eyed tiger opened its mouth and spat out a mouthful of food.Princess Yiyi did not dare to continue watching. She endured the tears and ran in another direction.At this moment, their danger had not been resolved.After the old man was eaten, the three-eyed tiger would continue to chase after them. After all, the three-eyed tiger had a huge appetite!With tears in her eyes, Jiang Yiyi continued to run wildly.At this moment, she no longer looked like a princess. Instead, she was a weak woman who had fled in panic.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76: 76Chapter 76: three-eyed tigerThe three-eyed tiger\u2019s bite was right behind them.Hearing this voice, all three of them felt their hair stand on end.As for that man, his name was Yan Qing. He was a disciple of a clan in the Beifeng country.The Beifeng country was located at the very edge of the southern region. Its environment was extremely harsh, and it was very close to the Middle East. As a result, it was a very chaotic country with all sorts of people.The reason why he had accompanied Jiang Yiyi on this trip was not purely for protection. The other reason was his family wanted him to marry into the Jiang family.In the entire Beifeng country, the Jiang family could be said to be the strongest, and had the most abundant resources.Putting all that aside, even Jiang Yiyi\u2019s appearance was one of the best in the entire Beifeng country.Countless admirers were chasing after the wind.But Jiang Yiyi\u2019s thoughts were not here.Her mother had a serious and strange illness.Her body was weak all the time, and the imperial physician had once diagnosed that she did not have long to live.In order to treat this harem master\u2019s illness, they had traveled all over the Beifeng country, but without exception, they could not find any reason.In the end, it was a disciple of an alchemy sect in the Middle East who gave them an idea.The Fire Alchemy sect.There were many alchemy cultivators here. The so-called alchemy cultivators used some materials to refine medicinal pills with different uses.Although Jiang Yiyi\u2019s mother\u2019s illness could not be diagnosed, it could be treated with one type of medicinal pill.That was the limitless pill.This was a multi-functional medicinal pill. Its medicinal effects were very powerful. Regardless of whether it was a poison or a hidden illness, as long as one ate the limitless pill, the medicinal pill would basically enter one\u2019s stomach and one\u2019s body would be healthy.However, such a powerful medicinal pill was not something that could be obtained just like that. It required a lot of precious ingredients.The Beifeng King\u2019s financial resources were naturally extremely rich. Hence, in less than half a month, he had already prepared most of the ingredients.However, there was one medicinal pill that was extremely difficult to obtain.That was the demonic pill of the three-eyed tiger.Although there were no demonic cores among the three-eyed tiger\u2019s cubs, the three-eyed tiger was an existence that was not to be trifled with when it reached adulthood.The Beifeng King had spent a huge amount of money to issue a bounty, but there was no response. The reason was that the three-eyed tiger\u2019s strength was simply too strong, and was not something an ordinary person could deal with.Moreover, not all three-eyed tigers had demonic cores.Hence, the bounty was just left there.The powerful ones did not care about the small bounty offered by the Beifeng King, and the weak ones could not defeat the three-eyed tiger at all.Mother\u2019s time was running out, so Jiang Yiyi sneaked out to try and find the three-eyed tiger.After all, the wilderness was so big, and the three-eyed tiger could not be seen everywhere.At first, no matter how she looked around, she still could not find anything.But when she found one, she began to run away again.\u201cYiyi, I\u2019ve said it before, why don\u2019t we just put a bounty on the three-eyed tiger\u2019s demon core? It\u2019s much easier to buy it from others than to take it ourselves.\u201dHow could Jiang Yiyi not know this logic? But if she could put a bounty on one, why would she take the risk to come here.\u201cStop talking, Young Master Han, the three-eyed tiger is catching up.\u201dThe dead old man was only enough for the three-eyed tiger to stuff between its teeth.The hungry three-eyed tiger quickly caught up.\u201cWhat should we do, Princess!\u201dA trace of despair flashed through Jiang Yiyi\u2019s eyes.Was she really going to die here?At this moment, Yan Han, who had been complaining non-stop, suddenly looked at the servant girl and then turned his head to look at the three-eyed tiger. His gaze slightly focused.If this continued, the three of them would become the three-eyed tiger\u2019s food.Just as he was about to push the servant girl to the back.Suddenly.A voice attracted his gaze.\u201cThree-eyed tiger! A big fellow has come, it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve eaten the three-eyed tiger\u2019s meat!\u201dWha\u2026 What!Eaten the three-eyed tiger\u2019s meat?Did he hear wrongly?Wang Hu was carrying a wide sword. Due to the fact that he had been fighting all day, his figure was extremely sturdy.He had been eating the meat of the fire qilin python, but mystic one had told him that there was a battle going on, and that there was also the aura of a powerful demonic beast.Wang Hu immediately rushed over.It just so happened that he had a stomach full of meat and had no place to digest it.Wang Hu\u2019s appearance caused a glimmer of hope to rise in Jiang Yiyi\u2019s heart.But it was quickly dispelled.Because although this young man\u2019s aura was fierce, his age was really too young.In the entire Beifeng country, those that were about the same age as him, with the best talent was only at the foundation establishment phase.But this three-eyed tiger was a demonic beast at the third level. Even an ordinary golden elixir phase cultivator would not be a match for it.How could this young man possibly defeat it.His tone was not small.However, a shocking scene appeared.Wang Hu leaped, leaping several feets, and directly flew over their heads. Then, he slashed his broadsword at the three-eyed tiger. A powerful aura was emitted from the broadsword. The three-eyed tiger was running wildly, facing Wang Hu. It felt that humans were simply too stupid.However, in the next breath, Wang Hu directly forced the three-eyed tiger back a few steps.\u201cRoar!!\u201dThe three-eyed tiger\u2019s eyes flashed with a light of disbelief.It had never thought that this young man would actually be so powerful.And this scene shocked Jiang Yiyi and the other two.At the same time, a glimmer of hope rose in their hearts.Wang Hu\u2019s attack succeeded, and his face was filled with excitement.It had been a long time since he had encountered such a strong demonic beast. Those weak demonic beasts were not enough for him to practice. He placed the broadsword in the sword case on his back, then pounced on the three-eyed tiger\u2019s head. He grabbed the single horn, and his feet stepped on his huge head.How could the three-eyed tiger endure such humiliation? It frantically shook its head, but Wang Hu\u2019s grip was very tight, and he did not let go at all. Taking advantage of the moment when he was playing with the three-eyed tiger, Wang Hu directly pulled out the broadsword on his back and stabbed it into his head.This exchange caused the three-eyed tiger to howl in pain.\u201cRoar roar!!\u201dFollowing that, it shook its head even more frantically.Wang Hu was accidentally thrown out, causing Jiang Yiyi\u2019s heart to tighten.One man, one demon.Facing each other, Wang Hu smiled.The three-eyed tiger\u2019s eyes were scarlet red.A battle erupted once again in the arena. The three-eyed tiger\u2019s huge body quickly rushed out, making an action that was extremely incompatible with its body size. Meanwhile, Wang Hu also moved. This time, he still aimed at the three-eyed tiger\u2019s forehead, but this time, the three-eyed tiger was obviously smarter.It tilted its head slightly to the right to avoid Wang Hu\u2019s attack. Then, it bit Wang Hu\u2019s body.On the other hand, when faced with such a dangerous situation, not only was Wang Hu not afraid, he even laughed.The three-eyed tiger was stunned for a moment. Suddenly, it felt an intense spiritual energy being emitted from Wang Hu\u2019s broadsword. It realized that it had been tricked, and frantically fled back. But it was too late. The intense sword energy directly blasted its huge body into the air.Wang Hu did not stop. He held the broadsword and leaped up onto the three-eyed tiger\u2019s forehead in midair. Then, the broadsword stabbed into it again, and a stream of blood splattered.Wang Hu reached his hand in and directly dug out the demonic core.The three-eyed tiger\u2019s painful roar came from below. Wang Hu jumped down with a happy expression on his face.This demonic core was very precious. He casually put it away.In the air, he focused his eyes!\u201cTiger! One sword attack!\u201d\u201cRumble\u201dA terrifying sword energy swept through.Then, the sword energy shot out fiercely. Before the three-eyed tiger\u2019s body landed on the ground, it was directly cut into two halves.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: 77Chapter 77: The Black Region sect snatches itThe three of them were shocked on the spot.What kind of strength was this? One had to know that the old man was a foundation establishment phase expert, and only had a few opponents, but it was torn apart without the three-eyed tiger being able to remember it.It could be seen that the three-eyed tiger\u2019s strength was not something that a foundation establishment phase cultivator could withstand. It was likely that even a golden elixir phase cultivator would not be a match for it.But what did they see? This young man had actually used only a few moves to kill this level three-eyed tiger.That was a level three demonic beast!They looked at the young man in shock, not daring to believe it at all.\u201cThis three-eyed tiger is too weak! I haven\u2019t even started to show off yet.\u201dWang Hu commented. He did not say these words to show off, but he really felt that the three-eyed tiger was very weak.But when Jiang Yiyi and the others heard it, they were even more shocked.Hadn\u2019t even begun to show off yet?If he really showed off, then perhaps, he could even fight a level four demonic beast, right?Wang Hu walked over, his posture relaxed, \u201cWhat are you guys here for?\u201d\u201cTo look for the three-eyed tiger!\u201dJiang Yiyi blurted out.Her gaze kept shifting to Wang Hu\u2019s expression. The main reason was that Wang Hu had a three-eyed tiger\u2019s demonic core on his face. This was one of the main ingredients for refining the limitless pill.Jiang Yiyi immediately had an idea.\u201cYoung hero, are you selling this three-eyed tiger\u2019s demon core? I can buy it at a high price!\u201dWang Hu shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m not selling it.\u201d\u201cMy master has been talking about the soup made from the three-eyed tiger\u2019s meat for a long time. This three-eyed tiger demon core is the main ingredient.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dJiang Yiyi originally thought that Wang Hu was not selling it for some important reason. She did not expect that it was to make meat soup for his master.At that moment, she was a little annoyed by the master that Wang Hu was talking about.Just as the few of them were talking, a few figures walked out from the dark forest in the distance.They were wearing the same clothes, so they were obviously from the same sect.\u201cThree-eyed tiger! Not bad, not bad.\u201d\u201cThis young man\u2019s strength is really not bad!\u201d\u201cBut since we have met him, then this three-eyed tiger will be accepted by us.\u201dThe wilderness forest was connected to the Middle East. As a result, many disciples from the Middle East\u2019s aristocratic families came to the wilderness forest to train.Although the Beifeng country and the wilderness forest were adjacent, the resources in the Middle East were much more abundant. Hence, their overall strength was very high. Any random disciple from an aristocratic family would be much stronger than the geniuses of the Beifeng Country.And the group of people that appeared in front of them was a relatively powerful sect in the Middle East.They were disciples of the Dark Region sect.They were not from a reputable sect, nor were they purely from the dark forces. They were just people with dirty means.The most generous thing to do was to snatch the fruits of others\u2019 victory.In this wild forest, great battles occurred frequently. Without exception, it was all between humans and demonic beasts. What they had to do every day was to snatch.When the human cultivators and demonic beasts were almost done fighting, they would attack and snatch the spoils of war.If the humans won, they would definitely not have much strength left after the great battle. If the demonic beasts won, they would definitely be injured.Therefore, no matter who won, as long as they attacked now, they would be able to obtain a very rich harvest. Moreover, they would not need to expend too much strength.Even if the winner wasn\u2019t injured, they wouldn\u2019t be afraid.Because there were many experts in the Black Region sect.For example, among this group of Black Region sect disciples, the strongest one had already reached the third level of the divine ability realm!This was a character that couldn\u2019t be looked down upon in the large sects of the southern region.And in the Black Region sect, he was just a senior leading a team. He wasn\u2019t even considered an elder.When Jiang Yiyi saw them appear, her face immediately turned ashen.This was great. Not to mention the demonic core, it was still unknown whether they could survive.She did not expect that just taking a demonic core could cause so many twists and turns.Yan Qing\u2019s face also sank. Wang Hu\u2019s appearance had already made him very unhappy. Now, people from the Dark Region sect had appeared.The Black Region sect was an existence that was not to be trifled with. Their Yan clan provided many treasures to the Black Region sect every year.\u201cSeniors of the Black Region sect, I am a disciple of the Yan clan of the Beifeng country. I hope that seniors can show mercy!\u201dWhen the few people heard this, they laughed and said, \u201cSo it\u2019s the Yan clan. You can leave first then!\u201dYan Qing nodded and wanted to bring Jiang Yiyi away. However, when he looked at the people from the Black Region sect, he dispelled this thought.\u201cThe rest, hand over all the treasures and I\u2019ll let you live.\u201dHei Ya walked around the three-eyed tiger\u2019s body and then nodded with satisfaction, \u201cI\u2019m afraid this meat is enough for us to eat for a month!\u201d\u201cAlthough our cultivation doesn\u2019t need us to eat anymore, who would be to refuse to eat the delicious meat of the three-eyed tiger?\u201dThe three-eyed tiger could be said to be full of treasures.The bones could be used to refine and increase the toughness of spirit weapons. It was also one of the necessary materials for refining many high-level spirit weapons.Internal organs, eyes, and a single horn could be used to refine pills. The most precious thing was its demonic core.The meat could also be eaten, which allowed the user to speed up their cultivation.\u201cEh? Why is the demonic core of the three-eyed tiger gone?\u201dUntil they appeared, Wang Hu did not have any reaction. He was so calm that no one could guess what he was thinking.However, those who were familiar with him knew that Wang Hu had the intention to kill.\u201cCan\u2019t you hear what I said? Quickly hand out everything on your body, or else, die!\u201dHei Ya narrowed his eyes and said darkly.As he spoke, his aura burst forth, causing Jiang Yiyi and the servant girl to spit out a mouthful of blood.\u201cDivine ability realm\u2026\u201dJiang Yiyi\u2019s face turned pale. Divine ability realm experts were not existences that they could contend against. It was not an exaggeration to say that there might not be many divine ability realm experts in the entire Beifeng country. As long as one was a divine ability realm expert, they would basically be at the level of imperial preceptor.That was an existence that they looked up to.This was also because Jiang Yiyi was more knowledgeable. Otherwise, with her foundation establishment phase cultivation, she would not be able to see through Hei Ya\u2019s cultivation level.Wang Hu\u2019s expression remained the same, not even changing. This caused Hei Ya to be slightly shocked.Just now, he had released the pressure of the Divine ability realm. With Wang Hu\u2019s golden elixir phase cultivation level, not to mention spitting out blood, it should be difficult for him to resist.But what was going on now? It was as if nothing had happened.Could it be that this kid had concealed his cultivation?Wang Hu did not feel any discomfort. This was not because his cultivation was high, but because of Xuan Yi\u2019s teachings. Many times in a battle, Xuan Yi would let him carry on fighting with the pressure. One had to know that Xuan Yi\u2019s pressure was many times stronger than Hei Ya\u2019s.Over time, Wang Hu could even adapt to the pressure of Xuan Yi which was like a vast ocean, not to mention Hei Ya\u2019s which was like small lake.\u201cYou want to snatch this three-eyed tiger?\u201dWang Hu smiled playfully.At this moment, he felt that Xuan Yi was rushing over, so he smiled even more confidently.\u201cAre you sure you want to snatch this three-eyed tiger?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78: 78Chapter 78: Jiang Yiyi\u2019s illnessHei Ya rushed in front of Wang Hu and said coldly, \u201cDo you know what my realm is?\u201dWang Hu frowned slightly, \u201cIt\u2019s just a divine ability realm!\u201dThese words made everyone somewhat confused.Aren\u2019t you just a golden elixir realm?The divine ability realm is much higher than yours.\u201cHmph, how dare you look down on our Black Region sect! Die!\u201dHei Ya didn\u2019t waste any words and directly unleashed his strongest killing move.The strongest attack of a divine ability realm expert wasn\u2019t something that Jiang Yiyi and the others at the foundation establishment phase could withstand. Just the pressure alone made Jiang Yiyi unable to stand straight. Half of her chest was slightly exposed, but at this moment, no one was appreciating the scenery.Wang Hu was a little anxious. Although he could resist this attack with all his might, Jiang Yiyi and the others were in danger.Just as Wang Hu was thinking about how to deal with the matter in front of him, a light voice sounded, \u201cYou want to make a move on my disciple!\u201dXuan Yi took a step forward and lightly received this attack.\u201cKneel!\u201dThe pressure that was like the vast ocean pounced over, and Hei ya directly knelt on the ground.Like him, there was also a group of disciples behind him.This time, it was Hei Ya and the others turn to be shocked.What kind of strength was this expert!Hei Ya would only feel this suffocation when facing the sect master.\u201cLaw enforcement\u2026 law enforcement realm?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you guys who want to snatch my disciple\u2019s spoils of war?\u201d\u201cSenior!!\u201dCold sweat covered Hei Ya\u2019s forehead, and he forcefully suppressed the fear in his heart. \u201cSenior, I didn\u2019t know he was your disciple!\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201dThe sword light shot out, and Hei Ya died on the spot.The remaining disciples of the Black Region gate all looked terrified.A divine ability realm expert was killed just like that.And it was a single strike. They didn\u2019t dare to imagine how terrifying this person\u2019s casual strike was.\u201cSenior, senior, let us go!\u201dIt was as if Xuan Yi didn\u2019t hear their words. He casually killed all these people with a single strike.The higher the realm, the more difficult it was to cross realms. In other words, the gap between the first and second levels of the law enforcement realm was a gap that was very difficult to bridge.Moreover, these people were one realm different from Xuan Yi, or even two realms.This was the second time Wang Hu had seen Xuan Yi make a move.He was even more shocked at the strength of his master.After all, even he could not defeat an existence at the high level of the divine ability realm.But now, they were killed by Xuan Yi in an instant.This involuntarily made him feel a sense of powerlessness.Not only did he feel powerless in the face of Xuan Yi, but also in the battle with Lin Jian not long after.That was the half-step sect master expert realm, and he had not even reached the divine ability realm yet.There was still a gap of three major realms between them, so how could he not feel despair.However, Xuan Yi was very confident, which made him feel a little more at ease.As long as he cultivated well with Xuan Yi, he might really be able to defeat Lin Jian who was at the half-step sect master expert phase .However, what he didn\u2019t know was that Xuan Yi didn\u2019t have any confidence either.The reason why he put down that bet was actually to stall for time.In the arena.There was complete silence.Both Jiang Yiyi and her servant were shocked by Xuan Yi\u2019s methods.Without saying a word, he directly attacked with a killing move.With a raise of his hand, several lives were taken.In fact, many of those disciples died before they could even make a sound.With such a method, was he not afraid of the Black Region sect\u2019s revenge?Although the black region sect was only a small sect in the Middle East, but they still had law enforcement experts.Divine ability experts were considered the strongest in the entire Beifeng country. Law enforcement experts did not even dare to think about it.And before Hei Ya died, he said the words \u2018law enforcement expert\u2019.This caused Jiang Yi to be incomparably shocked.She could not see through Xuan Yi\u2019s strength. But if Hei Ya\u2019s words were true, then this young man in front of her was actually a law enforcement expert?!She couldn\u2019t imagine how terrible the law enforcement situation was, but just now Xuanyi\u2019s method told her directly that it was only a sword to kill dozens of golden elixirs with his fingers.Her mother had told her from a young age that it was not necessary to find a good-looking man, but it was necessary to find a strong one.The stronger one was, the more manly he would be.He could also protect his wife and children well.Women were born to be creatures who admired the strong. Not all women were as independent and strong as Bai Weiwei.Jiang Yiyi was such a woman who liked to rely on the strong. Her eyes were full of spring, and there was a gentleness that contained everything on her body. It rippled the malevolence and arrogance of the world, using her own softness to give men an extremely stable harbor.Such a woman was very attractive to men, because while she was gentle, she could also arouse the desire of men to protect her. At this moment, when she saw how powerful Xuan Yi was, her entire body went limp. This was a disease that she had when she was facing the strong.At that time, her mother also knew about her condition, but only told her that there was no cure for this disease, and that she could only dual cultivate with the strong.When she thought of the two words \u2018dual cultivation\u2019 and looked at Xuan Yi\u2019s appearance, she became even more limp. She couldn\u2019t help but blush. He was so strong and good looking, her body couldn\u2019t help but tremble, and her lower body was even flooded.The servant at the side noticed the princess\u2019 abnormality and hurriedly supported the limp Jiang Yiyi.\u201cPrincess, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dJiang Yiyi\u2019s clothes had long been soaked in sweat and stuck to her body. The clothes on her chest area had been torn apart due to the battle, revealing a patch of snow-white skin. She wrapped her clothes, but because her clothes were torn in several places, wrapping her chest and exposing her waist, the skin on her waist looked particularly smooth and tender under the support of the sweat.Noticing that Xuan Yi and Wang Hu were looking over, her face was flushed red, as if blood was about to drip out.Wang Hu glanced over and turned his head away, because he only had Wang Juan in his heart. No matter how good-looking other women were, he could not arouse any interest in them.Xuan Yi, on the other hand, kept sizing her up.Jiang Yiyi\u2019s legs went weak from the unreasonable gaze, just when she could not stand the gaze and wanted to stop Xuan Yi looking at her.When she raised her head, she realized that Xuan Yi\u2019s gaze was clear. There was no trace of evil or greed.At this moment, Xuan Yi opened his mouth and said, \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with your body.\u201dJiang Yiyi immediately froze.Only then did she react.Xuan Yi wasn\u2019t trying to take advantage of her, but that there was something wrong about her body.But this time, her face turned even redder. Because of the special nature of her body, it was very difficult for her to say it out loud.However, Xuan Yi didn\u2019t say it out loud. He just smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a small problem. If there\u2019s a chance, I can help you treat it, but I need your cooperation.\u201dJiang Yiyi was puzzled. Cooperation? How could she cooperate?Could it be?Thinking of this, she wished she could find a hole to hide in.\u201cAh Hu, tidy up their storage bags. Then, I want to eat the three-eyed tiger\u2019s meat.\u201dWang Hu nodded respectfully. \u201cYes, Master!\u201dAfter rummaging through the storage bags of the corpses, Wang Hu directly cut the three-eyed tiger into several pieces.The barbecue began.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79: 79Chapter 79: Using the body to exchange for the demonic core?Wang Hu quickly made his preparations.The three-eyed tiger\u2019s body was very big, so Wang Hu cut a few of the more tender parts, such as the chest, thighs, and other places where the meat was firm.Jiang Yiyi was still thinking about how to get the demonic core of the three-eyed tiger from Wang Hu when she was suddenly attracted by the smell of meat.She only felt that the meat in front of her had become extremely attractive, and could not help but want to take a bite.As a member of the Beifeng country\u2019s royal family, Jiang Yiyi had eaten all kinds of delicious food before, but she had never smelled such delicious food before.The meat juice was burnt tender and yellow, and the texture of the meat gave off a crisp sound.Following that was an extremely rich fragrance, causing her gaze to be unable to shift away.She could not help but sigh. Not only was this Wang Hu\u2019s strength extraordinary, even his culinary skills were so amazing. He was even better than the chefs from the imperial kitchen. It was just that she had never smelled such a fragrance before, she only felt that her brain had entered a state of extreme enjoyment.Wang Hu enjoyed Jiang Yiyi\u2019s reaction very much.However, he knew in his heart that when Xuan Yi had taught him back then, his reaction was not much better than the two of them.Moreover, he had only learned one-tenth of Xuan Yi\u2019s standard. If they were to really smell Xuan Yi\u2019s barbecued meat, they would have already pounced on him by now.\u201cIt smells so good!\u201d\u201cYoung hero, you have great skills!\u201dJiang Yiyi stared at the three-eyed tiger\u2019s meat with a serious and undisguised eagerness.This is not bad?If I really let you eat a bite of master\u2019s barbecued meat, wouldn\u2019t you directly ascend to heaven!Wang Hu thought about it with a wicked interest and then distributed the barbecued meat to everyone.At this moment, he took out the three-eyed tiger\u2019s demonic core.\u201cMaster, didn\u2019t you want to cook the soup with the demonic core a few days ago?\u201d\u201cMm, cook it for me to try and see if your culinary skills have improved.\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201dWang Hu was extremely happy. Every time Xuan Yi said that he would help him see if there was any improvement, he would always find some of his shortcomings. Not only in terms of cultivation, but also in life.This made him even more determined to become Xuan Yi\u2019s disciple.When he thought of how Wang Juan would look at him with starry eyes when she saw his cooking in the future, he could not help but become excited.\u201cWait\u2026\u201dEven though these barbecued meat attracted most of Jiang Yiyi\u2019s attention, she still forcefully stopped eating. Instead, she looked at the demonic pill in Wang Hu\u2019s hand with a face full of anticipation.Boiling a demonic core?A demonic core was not a medicinal pill, but the essence of a demonic beast. Its hardness was not inferior to diamond. Could it be boiled?Moreover, it was too wasteful!The demonic core had so many uses. It would be such a waste to boil it into soup!\u201cSenior, my mother at home desperately needs the medicinal pill refined from the demonic core at this moment to save her life. I wonder if senior can part with it\u2026\u201dJiang Yiyi said softly. When she was facing Xuan Yi, her eyes would constantly avoid him. She even lowered her voice, like a mosquito.\u201cSenior!\u201dXuan Yi glanced sideways. The demonic core had many uses, but it was not of much help to Xuan Yi. Whether it was medicinal pills or refining materials, he had a lot on him. Especially after coming out of the mystic realm, he did not lack treasures.Therefore, his need for the demonic core was just to drink a unique soup. The demonic core was the core of the demonic beast. The soup that was brewed would be very delicious and couldn\u2019t be brewed with ordinary materials.\u201cWhat illness is your mother suffering from?\u201dJiang Yiyi shook her head. She didn\u2019t know what illness her mother was suffering from. She only heard from the alchemy sect that she could be treated with the limitless pill. Moreover, not only did she spend a lot of effort on the materials, even when she was done gathering all the materials, she also needed to give the alchemy sect some wealth before they were willing to help her refine the pills.After hearing what she said, Xuan Yi suddenly felt that having a disciple who could refine pills was not bad. After all, it was very expensive to buy pills, and it would also cost money to get someone to help refine the pills.If he had a disciple who could refine pills, then he, Xuan Yi, would not lack the ingredients. At that time, the pills would be nothing more than snacks.As he thought about it, Xuan Yi had already gone astray. When his thoughts returned to reality, he shook his head gently.\u201cYour mother\u2019s illness has nothing to do with me. I don\u2019t lack money. Why should I sell it to you?\u201dIt was not that Xuan Yi was not merciful enough. It was just that being merciful in this era was a sin.After Xuan Yi finished speaking, he gestured for Wang Hu to continue brewing.When Jiang Yiyi saw this, she also understood that Xuan Yi did not lack money. Hence, she was silent for three breaths. Her gaze became ruthless as she gritted her teeth and said, \u201cAs long as senior sells the demonic core to me, I am willing\u2026 willing to offer my body to senior!\u201dXuan Yi waved his hand and motioned for Wang Hu to stop.The emotions in Jiang Yiyi\u2019s eyes were very complicated. She was pleasantly surprised and uneasy at the same time. Just now, she only said such words in a moment of impatience. Now, her face was red and she regretted what she said just now. However, when she thought about how she could save her mother.., she became determined again.Then, she looked at Xuan Yi with a somewhat complicated gaze.Sure enough, all men were the same.Just a moment ago, she thought that Xuan Yi was a gentleman, but now, when he heard that he could have her body, he stopped. This made Jiang Yiyi very disdainful.Jiang Yiyi\u2019s figure was very sexy. She was tall and slender, with a curvy back and front. She was wearing a tight nightwear that tightly wrapped around his honey butt, only revealing his outline. Her slender thighs also appeared round under the wrap of the tights.Xuan Yi looked her up and down. He was not really interested in Jiang Yiyi\u2019s body, but the stubbornness on Jiang Yiyi\u2019s body was somewhat similar to Bai Weiwei\u2019s.\u201cDo you think that your body can be exchanged for a demonic core with me?\u201dXuan Yi said calmly, but his gaze did not look at her anymore. Instead, he was focused on eating the tiger meat in his hands. His actions were meticulous and clean, making it easy for people to have a favorable impression of him.However, due to Jiang Yiyi\u2019s misunderstanding of Xuan Yi, no matter how she looked at him, she felt that Xuan Yi was a little pretentious. \u201cThat\u2019s right. As long as senior gives me the demonic core, my body will belong to senior.\u201dJiang Yiyi said expressionlessly, her expression was filled with disappointment.She originally thought that Xuan Yi was different from other men, but she did not expect that all men were the same.When she heard that she could get her own body, even the speed of eating meat increased!Hmph!Stinky Man!\u201cI\u2019m not interested in your body.\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s words interrupted the curse in her heart.For a moment, she thought that she had heard wrongly.\u201cNot interested?\u201dThen why did you interrupt your disciple\u2019s cooking of the demonic core?Xuan Yi threw away a bone and wiped his mouth with water.\u201cBut your thoughts are very touching.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Senior.\u201dJiang Yiyi always felt that caliing Xuan Yi a senior was a bit awkward. After all, their ages were not much different. \u201cSenior, what you mean is\u2026\u201d\u201cNothing much.\u201dXuan Yi pointed at Wang Hu. \u201cI\u2019m thirsty, hurry up and cook.\u201d\u201cYes, Master!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80: 80Chapter 80: Master, it\u2019s TOO DEEP!This time, Jiang Yiyi was completely frozen.This was\u2026This meant that her body was not as attractive to him as the demonic core soup!Jiang Yiyi looked at Xuan Yi in disbelief.Very soon, the demonic core soup was ready. Because the demonic core was very strong, Wang Hu used a special flame, a kind of flame that was taken from the body of a demonic beast.Looking at the pot of soup in front of her.Jiang Yiyi swallowed her saliva, the despair in her heart became stronger and stronger.This was the demonic core of the three-eyed tiger!If it was thrown to the outside world, it could attract many powerful experts to fight for it. Even if it was sold, it could be sold for a good price. Now, it directly turned into a pot of soup\u2026The effect was that the taste was more delicious.It was indeed delicious. Just smelling the smell of the soup, Jiang Yiyi felt a burst of hunger in her stomach. After all, he had just eaten several pieces of the three-eyed tiger\u2019s meat.The reason for her despair was very simple. The three-eyed tiger was a very rare demonic beast to begin with. If her luck was bad, she might not even be able to encounter one in the wild forest in a year. Now that she had finally encountered one, the meat was eaten and the demonic core was stewed into soup.Then how was she going to treat her mother\u2019s illness?The limitless pill lacked one of the main medicinal ingredients and could not be refined at all.\u201cSenior\u2026\u201dJiang Yiyi was completely helpless against Xuan Yi. He did not like her body, nor did he lack money or treasures. Facing such a man, Jiang Yiyi felt a sense of helplessness.\u201cI don\u2019t want your body, but I want you to help me open up a path in the Beifeng country, and directly enter the Middle East.\u201dXuan Yi said calmly.Jiang Yiyi was puzzled, \u201cSenior\u2026 now that the demonic core is gone, why are you still talking about this? Are you trying to threaten the imperial family of the Beifeng Country?\u201dThe Beifeng country had been in war for many years and often fought with several neighbouring countries. The reason why they chose the difficult path of the wild forest was firstly to let Wang Hu gain some experiences here, secondly, it could prevent them from fighting head-on with other countries.Because of the agreement between the Middle East and the southern region, any cultivator who wanted to cross the two regions could not fly.This also prevented Xuan Yi from entering the Middle East by flying.Although the war between Beifeng country and its neighbouring countries was similar to a child\u2019s fight in front of Xuan Yi, it could not withstand the large number of people. If they encountered such a war on land, it would affect Xuan Yi\u2019s traveling speed.But now, Wang Hu\u2019s experience in the wilderness forest was almost done. In addition to having a carriage from Beifeng country, Xuan Yi quickly thought of using the Beifeng country\u2019s name to cross the battlefield.Xuan Yi drank a mouthful of soup and nodded slightly, \u201cNot bad, the fire is a little too big.\u201dAfter saying that, Xuan Yi looked at Jiang Yiyi, he said softly, \u201cI deeply admire your heart of saving your mother, so I can make a special trip to Beifeng country to treat your mother. Of course, as a reward, your Beifeng country has to help sending the two of us into the Middle East.\u201dAt the side, Wang Hu was stunned.How could he not know Xuan Yi\u2019s thoughts.What did he mean by making a special trip to the Beifeng country? It was obviously on the way!He was even moved by the heart of saving her mother, and even admired her!He, Wang Hu, had never seen Xuan Yi admire anyone before.It was nothing more than Xuan Yi asking for the Beifeng country\u2019s help, it did not make sense, after all, he had drunk the other party\u2019s life-saving straw.His words were so righteous that Jiang Yiyi was on the verge of tears!However, only Wang Hu was clear that Xuan Yi was only doing these things for the sake of convenience. The true purpose was to let Beifeng country to send the two of them into the Middle East.Otherwise, Xuan Yi would not even helped to save them.Too deep, too deep!Wang Hu could not help but exclaim in his heart!After drinking the demonic core that could save a life, Xuan Yi then asked the other party to send them to the Middle East. In the end, it was only for the sake of saving the mother\u2019s life. As for whether they would be able to save her life or not, he did not give a definite answer.This wave of master\u2019s was too high!Jiang Yiyi was pleasantly surprised. Xuan Yi actually said that he could help save her mother.Although she did not know Xuan Yi\u2019s exact strength, she still felt a glimmer of hope.And this price was actually just to escort them into the Middle East!This person was probably not a god descending to the mortal world!After saving her mother, she believed that even if they wanted half of their Beifeng country\u2019s wealth, she and the others would still be able to agree!Tall and mighty!Jiang Yiyi\u2019s gaze when she looked at Xuan Yi could not help but change.He did not want money or fame.In fact, he was even able to reject the temptation of her body!Moreover, as long as she extended a helping hand and helped them a little.That was all!This cultivation realm was simply too high!Jiang Yiyi felt that compared to Xuan Yi, she was an extremely vulgar person.To think that she was thinking of trading her body for a demonic core just a moment ago. It turned out that Xuan Yi did not care about her body at all!\u201cJiang Yiyi admires Elder Xuan\u2019s realm!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been taught a lesson!\u201dWang Hu was almost going crazy watching from the side.What realm???Why was she admiring him!!!What\u2019s with that look of admiration on your face!You\u2019ve been taught a lesson?Did my master teach you anything?He was dumbfounded on the spot, but he wasn\u2019t a fool. He quickly realized why Jiang Yiyi had such a reaction. After he understood, his admiration for Xuan Yi deepened.What was this.He hadn\u2019t suffered any losses, and he even made the losing party be grateful to him.If this was in a war, it would definitely be at the level of the National Master!He only knew that Xuan Yi\u2019s strength was deep, but he didn\u2019t expect that even his shrewdness was so deep.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Although saving people will cause my body to feel a little tired, it\u2019s just tiredness. To save people, this is nothing.\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s spirit instantly rose a few notches in Jiang Yiyi\u2019s eyes.Could the tiredness that senior mentioned be just tiredness?It would probably consume a lot of spirit!She was directly moved by Xuan Yi\u2019s actions.Just as she was about to speak, Yan Qing jumped out of nowhere.When he encountered the Black Region sect, he had been running for his life alone. Now that he suddenly jumped out, he said something that was neither yin nor yang, \u201cSaving people? I don\u2019t think he has such ability.\u201d\u201cWhy did you come back?\u201dJiang Yiyi said unhappily. Regarding the matter of him running away alone, Jiang Yiyi could barely convince herself. After all, no one wanted to die.But the moment he came out, he started to deny Xuan Yi. This made her extremely unhappy.\u201cThe illness that the Holy Mother is suffering from is something that even the alchemy sect members can\u2019t do anything about. Only an all-purpose medicinal pill like the limitless pill, could help. What right do you have to say that you can treat her?\u201d\u201cI think he\u2019s just a swindler. All he wants to do is to step on this convenient ship of the Beifeng country.\u201d\u201cYiyi, don\u2019t be deceived by him!\u201dJiang Yiyi\u2019s gaze gradually turned cold.This was her mother\u2019s only chance!Jiang Yiyi was afraid that Yan Han would say something outrageous that would make Xuan Yi unhappy, that would lead him stop treating her mother.In fact, Xuan Yi\u2019s majestic spirit was being questioned by Yan Han, causing her to feel that more worldly cold towards Yan Han. He was simply incomparable to Xuan Yi.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81: 81Chapter 81: Beifeng country! The capital!The alchemy sect was an extremely large sect in the Middle East, and their strength was not weaker than the Divine Medicine Valley in the southern region.In fact, they were even stronger than the Divine Medicine Valley. If such a sect could not even diagnose her mother\u2019s illness, then what right did Xuan Yi have to say that he could do it?Yan Qing\u2019s thoughts were not without reason. Judging from the long history of seeking medical treatments, the illness of the Queen of the Beifeng country was indeed very difficult to treat. It was as if they had searched through the entire Middle East for famous doctors, but without a doubt, none was unable to diagnose it.That Xuan Yi was only slightly stronger, but when it came to treatment, he might not necessarily be as powerful as the people from those small medical shops.Jiang Yiyi retorted, \u201cSince you\u2019re so sure that senior can\u2019t treat her, why don\u2019t you treat her?\u201dYan Han was instantly rendered speechless.But he had already made up his mind. When he reached the Beifeng country, if Xuan Yi could not cure the Queen, he would wait and see how he could expose Xuan Yi!Xuan Yi did not feel much towards his denial. If he could not help, then so be it. Could Yan Han still kill him?Seeing that Yan Han knew this princess, Xuan Yi did not say anything more.On the other hand, when Xuan Yi was questioned, Wang Hu\u2019s face was filled with displeasure.But when he received Xuan Yi\u2019s gaze, he did not say anything.After finishing all the precious medicinal soup, the group set off on their way to Beifeng country.The wilderness forest was very close to the Beifeng country, and was close to the border of the Beifeng country.As soon as they exited the wilderness forest, everyone could smell the stench of blood.It could be seen that a huge battle had just occurred here.The ground was covered in blood, but there were rarely any corpses. Even if there were corpses, they would only be rotten corpses that stank.The rest were basically eaten up by demonic beasts.When Jiang Yiyi saw this, her heart could not help but wail in sorrow.The Beifeng country had been embroiled in war with the surrounding countries for many years, and the commoners were the ones who suffered the most.But because of the size of the country, the war had never been reduced in the slightest because of the survival of the people.Along the way, they saw countless bloody scenes, and very quickly, they reached the nearest courier station.There were all kinds of faces in the courier station. There were women in the dust, heroes in the chaotic world, merchants, and so on.After resting for a while, the group continued on their journey.After traveling for several days, they finally arrived at the capital of the Beifeng country.The northern capital.This city was different from the ones they had seen along the way, be it in terms of attire or the degree of luxury, it was much more prosperous than the cities they had seen along the way.High walls, vendors, and a solemn army.Jiang Yiyi had her special princess token. The journey was smooth as she arrived at the imperial city.Xuan Yi and Wang Hu were arranged to wait in the side hall.\u201cMaster, are you confident that you can cure her mother\u2019s illness?\u201dIt was Wang Hu\u2019s first time coming to such a luxurious place, but he did not feel uncomfortable at all. This was mainly in the southern region\u2019s Xuan Sword sect, Xuan Yi\u2019s residence was much more luxurious than this one.This room was filled with some gold and silver treasures, emitting a golden light.However, other than gold and silver treasures, there was nothing special.However, what was placed in Xuan Yi\u2019s residence were not these. Those were treasures, pills, spirit tools and weapons, and even some holy items that would cause countless people to fight over if they were casually thrown out!It could be said that any of the treasures in Xuan Yi\u2019s residence could easily replaced this room full of gold and silver treasures.Hence, Wang Hu\u2019s attention was not on the luxurious room at all. In fact, he even felt that it was a little rustic.However, the eunuch who was waiting in the side hall did not think so.When he saw that Xuan Yi and Wang Hu were unmoved by the luxurious room, he was secretly surprised. What kind of background did these two have to be so calm.He knew that not to mention ordinary people, even some of the rich and powerful would be slightly surprised when they came to the side hall. The room was simply too luxurious, as if it was made out of a pile of jewels.This was also something that the king had intentionally done.The side hall was a place that the royal family used to entertain guests, so they naturally could not lose face. This way of dressing could reveal a little bit of the Beifeng country\u2019s wealth and foundation, and intimidate the guests. After all, the guests received here were usually envoys from other countries.The eunuch was surprised, and could not help but size up Xuan Yi and Wang Hu.Their auras were indifferent and their expressions were calm.He had been here for many years and had never seen anyone with such an aura. He even had a feeling that the luxurious side hall was not worthy of the two of them.Xuan Yi said calmly, \u201cWithout seeing the patient, how would I know if the illness can be cured?\u201dWang Hu smiled awkwardly, \u201cMaster, I\u2019ll make you some tea.\u201d\u2026In the main hall, the King, Jiang Zhan, had a dark expression on his face.Jiang Yiyi had already told him everything, including the matter of exchanging her body for the demonic core. This made Jiang Zhan felt extremely humiliated. However, Jiang Yiyi said that the person did not accept it, which made Jiang Zhan sigh in relief.However, that person said that he could cure the Queen.He could not believe it, and even felt that Jiang Yiyi had been deceived.In addition, Yan Han had added some embellishments on the side, which made Jiang Zhan even more skeptical of Jiang Yiyi.\u201cNonsense!\u201dJiang Zhan shouted loudly.\u201cIt\u2019s nonsense to go to the wilderness forest. Now, you even brought this unknown person to the imperial capital. It\u2019s even more nonsense in the midst of nonsense.\u201d\u201cDo you know that the imperial capital is the lifeblood of the entire Beifeng country? If the person you brought here had other intentions, it would be a disaster for the entire Beifeng country!\u201d\u201cA trip to the wilderness forest and the death of the foundation establishment phase Elder Kui, you still haven\u2019t come to your senses!\u201d\u201cHurry up and face the wall!\u201dTo save the Queen, Jiang Zhan had been running around for a long time. How could he not know the difficulty.Now, Jiang Yiyi brought two people with unknown origins. Jiang Zhan didn\u2019t believe that they could cure the Queen.\u201cWhat I said is true. He really can cure the mother!\u201d\u201cHmph! Bring the princess away and lock her up! Chase away those two people with unknown origins!\u201dJiang Yiyi was extremely anxious, but no matter what he said, it was unable to change Jiang Zhan\u2019s mind.Right at this moment, Yan Han suddenly said, \u201cKing, why don\u2019t we let them try?\u201dJiang Zhan\u2019s brows furrowed, \u201cWhy? Do you also think that they can save the Queen?\u201dYan Han hurriedly knelt down and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not the case. King, if we chase them away now, wouldn\u2019t it be a bad reputation?\u201dThe King understood Yan Han\u2019s meaning after thinking for a moment. Although they knew that these two people of unknown origins would not be able to save the Queen, but the common people did not know that.Chasing them away like this would seem very ungracious.It would be better to let them give it a try. Not only would they leave behind the impression that the King was friendly to the common people, but also be able to let the two of them go when they were unable to cure the Queen. That way, the entire Beifeng country would naturally admire the King\u2019s magnanimity.In the end, even if they killed two people of unknown origins, no one would say anything. After all, they were the ones who had lied to them first.If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the cultivation of these two people was not low, Jiang Zhan would have long had the intention to kill them.But if they were allowed to cure the Queen, and there would be a lot of room for maneuvering.Jiang Zhan waved his hand, gesturing for the soldiers who were pulling Jiang Yiyi to leave, \u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82: 82Chapter 82: The Queen of the country!Then, the King brought a few guards to the side hall.Xuan Yi was sitting on a golden chair with his eyes closed and resting.\u201cTwo distinguished guests, are you the seniors that my daughter brought back?\u201dJiang Zhan said with a smile. There was no displeasure on his face, which was completely different from Jiang Zhan\u2019s face in the main hall. It could be seen that he was also a very shrewd person to be able to sit on the position of the King of a country.Xuan Yi nodded slightly and said modestly, \u201cThat\u2019s right. A senior can\u2019t be called.\u201d\u201cIn that case, let\u2019s go and check out the Queen\u2019s body.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe group left the main hall and headed to the back palace, the Pear Blossom Hall.This was the Queen\u2019s residence, designed very comfortably and was all green to the eye.Soon, they arrived at the hall.A gauze curtain covered a graceful body.\u201cMay I know your name?\u201d\u201cXuan Yi.\u201dXuan Yi did not have the habit of hiding his name. After all, he had not done anything shameful, and he was not afraid of enemies coming to find him. So, he simply told them his real name.\u201cSenior Xuan, please take a look.\u201dThe King walked over and lifted the curtain.A seductive body was revealed.Although the Queen was only forty years old, she did not look very old due to her cultivation. She looked like she was less than thirty years old. Her shoulders were half exposed, and her jade-like feet were curled up on the bed. Most of her snow-white skin was covered by the blanket.Even her appearance was very beautiful. She was even more beautiful than Jiang Yiyi. There was more charm in her. Other than a hint of paleness between her brows, there was still a hint of charm.This erotic scene made Wang Hu\u2019s mouth dry. However, he quickly steadied his mind and noticed a unique spot on the Queen\u2019s chest.There was a black spot the size of a baby on her chest. If one did not look carefully, it looked like a black fog had gathered on his chest.\u201cThis is the strange illness that has been plaguing the Queen. Even many famous doctors do not know where this black spot came from.\u201dThe King\u2019s mood was gloomy.\u201cOh, I wonder if the Queen had been to any places before this?\u201d Xuan Yi asked.The King thought for a moment,, \u201cShe seems to have been to the wild forest before this, but didn\u2019t encounter any danger.\u201dXuan Yi nodded, \u201cAlright, you guys go out first.\u201dWhen he said this, the King frowned slightly.But when he thought that the doctors didn\u2019t care about men or women, he relaxed.Soon, the people in the room dispersed, leaving Xuan Yi behind.Outside the door, the King looked troubled.Although he was certain that Xuan Yi wouldn\u2019t be able to save the Queen, but he became nervous every time a doctor entered the room. As time passed, he developed a habit and even a natural reaction.\u201cKing, if Xuan Yi can\u2019t cure the Queen later, how should we deal with him?\u201dJiang Zhan\u2019s face was gloomy. He thought for a long time before he slowly said, \u201cThe crime of deceiving the King should have been executed. However, since he was eager to save the Queen, I spared his life.\u201dHe was not being soft-hearted.There were two benefits to doing so.First, he did not have to fight with Xuan Yi. He was on the side of morality. In fact, he did not necessarily think that the experts that Jiang Yiyi mentioned could be killed just to save face.Secondly, by doing so, he could show his magnanimity to the people.However, no matter what he did, it was difficult to hide his disappointment.Over the years, disappointment after disappointment had long made him lose his usual vigor.After the Queen was her first official wife, who had accompanied him through countless hardships. Step by step, they had gotten to where they were today. They had an incomparably luxurious life, but she had contracted a serious illness.Not only could she not enjoy everything that she had worked hard for, but she also had to endure the torment of her illness.This was something Jiang Zhan really did not want to see.Jiang Yiyi suddenly said, \u201cHe\u2019ll definitely be able to cure mother!\u201dJiang Zhan glared at her, he wanted to scold her loudly, but noticing that Wang Hu was still at the side, he restrained himself a little and said, \u201cShut Up!\u201dThere was still something in his heart that he had not said. The Beifeng country had already been plagued with internal and external problems, and now she had brought two people of unknown origins to add to the troubles.If these two people had any ill intentions, the situation in their Beifeng country would become even more troublesome.\u201cBastard, shut up!\u201dThe more Jiang Zhan thought about it, the angrier he got. He only calmed down a little after reprimanding harshly.Cured?He was even a little worried that Xuan Yi was plotting something against the Queen inside. But because the aura of choosing one was very refined, he did not think too much about it.Let\u2019s talk about the room.The Queen had already woken up.She was half lying on the bed, her fair and tender skin half revealing, giving people unlimited space to daydream.If one were to talk about the Queen, she was already several decades old, but her skin was maintained very well. But from the color of her skin, it was simply the best in the world. In addition to that plump and charming body, it made Xuan Yi praise the beauty of the world.After adjusting his mind, Xuan Yi looked at the black fog on her chest again.\u201cAre you a doctor who came to diagnose me?\u201dXuan Yi nodded slightly, \u201cI\u2019m here to treat you, but I\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dThe Queen slowly sat up. The quilt covering her body fell on the bed, and she was only wearing clothes that covered her private parts and a thin gauze coat.Seeing this scene, Xuan Yi\u2019s mind immediately became clearer.Stockings?An adjective popped up in Xuan Yi\u2019s mind.In fact, she was not wearing stockings, but they were somewhat similar. The thin gauze coat was close to her thigh, snow-white and tight. The flesh on her thigh was squeezed out by the gauze coat and was slightly red.She did not seem to care about being looked at like that. Perhaps she was not guarded against doctors.\u201cYou came to treat me, but you are not a doctor?\u201d She seemed to be a little curious. Her pair of beautiful eyes constantly moved around Xuan Yi\u2019s hand. This pair of extremely alluring eyes made Xuan Yi involuntarily look over. Light eye shadow, there was a ripple in her eyes, her long eyelashes fluttered.Not knowing if it was the air in this room or her breathing, Xuan Yi smelled a faint fragrance. It swept past the tip of his nose, flowed into his mouth, and finally spiraled in his chest.\u201cIt smells so good.\u201dIt seemed that this was not the first time the Queen had seen such a reaction. She smiled lightly and said, \u201cThis is a body fragrance that I was born with. Yiyi also has this body fragrance like me.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dXuan Yi was no longer distracted by her body. He focused on staring at her chest.This time, it was the Queen who felt a little uncomfortable. Although she had been seen by many doctors, she still felt a little shy. Moreover, this was a fair and clean young man in front of her. His clear eyes made her feel much more at ease.As the two of them were relatively close to each other, she could even hear each other\u2019s breathing. The heat that Xuan Yi spat out onto her face made the Queen feel itchy all over.After all, she had not done that kind of thing for a long time during these years of illness.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83: 83Along with the hot air.The Queen unconsciously twisted her plump body.She was trying hard to restrain herself.At this moment, Xuan Yi suddenly said, \u201cTake off your shirt, I want to see it more carefully.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dThe Queen slightly cried out in surprise.Before this, every doctor who came did not cower in fear and did not dare to come forward.This kid was really daring. Not only was he so close, he even made her take off her shirt.Did he not know that she was the Queen?The Queen\u2019s name was Yue Yan.She was not a conservative person, but she was still shocked by Xuan Yi\u2019s bold words.She was stunned for a moment and did not move.\u201cQueen, I need you to take off your shirt so that I can judge more accurately.\u201dJudge?Could it be that he saw through the problem in his body?In fact, Xuan Yi really had a guess, but he wasn\u2019t too sure. The problem in Yue Yan\u2019s body was very similar to the legendary poison.Purple Flower Poison!It was a poison that was born with, which meant that her parents had such a poison in their bodies.\u201cQueen, I wonder if your parents are still alive?\u201d\u201cThey died in the war a long time ago.\u201d Yue Yan\u2019s mood was slightly gloomy.As she spoke, she slowly took off her top, revealing a pair of snow-white jade mountains. Even though she was already forty years old, those jade mountains were still firm and proud. The two grapes were more like the unique pink color of a young girl.She shyly turned her back, but she quickly turned around for Xuan Yi to take a closer look.Xuan Yi could not remain calm. He had asked Yue Yan to take off her clothes, but he had not asked her to take them off completely!Xuan Yi forced himself to calm down and took a closer look.Between the pair of jade mountains and between the ditches, there was a cluster of black fog that did not seem to have any shape. However, if one took a closer look, one would discover that this cluster of black fog was in the shape of a plum blossom.This was exactly the same as the purple flower poison that Xuan Yi had guessed.The most terrifying aspect of the purple flower poison was that it was a strange poison that was born with it. There would not be any abnormal conditions before the age of thirty. However, after the age of thirty, the poison could flare up at any time. After that, the symptoms would be similar to that of Yue Yan, one\u2019s entire body would be limp and without strength. Furthermore, it would be very difficult to cure. This was because there was currently no way to detoxify the poison.There were records in ancient books that people who were afflicted with this poison basically had no chance of detoxifying. The only way was to fight poison with poison. Moreover, this kind of method of fighting poison with poison was very rare, and that was dual cultivation.And that dual cultivation person didn\u2019t mean that just anyone could do it.It had to be someone who had eaten another strange poison, then engaged in dual cultivation with her. Only then could the strange poison in her body be countered and completely detoxified.This was because the purple flower poison did not stay in one place all the time. Instead, it would dodge and even hide in the most private places of women. Hence, it could only be used to attack the body with another strange poison, and it was a poison that was on par with the purple flower poison.After confirming that the poison in Yue Yan\u2019s body was the purple flower poison, Xuan Yi retracted his gaze. \u201cQueen, put on your clothes.\u201dYue Yan\u2019s face was flushed red as she slowly put on her clothes. She did not know if it was because her jade mountain was too strong or because her body was weak, but when she put on her clothes, it took a lot of effort. The two snow-white meatballs were squeezed into various shapes, however, she had not put on her clothes yet.Feeling helpless, she was about to call for a servant girl to help. However, it was only then that she realized that there were no servant girls in the room. All of them were sent out by Xuan Yi. At this moment, there were only two people in the room. Her face was flushed red as if blood was about to drip out. Even though she was experienced in human affairs, she could not help but feel shy.The main thing was that Xuan Yi had a very strong charm that made her feel as if she wanted to go limp.She could not put on her clothes. If she were to call out for a servant girl, it would definitely attract the attention of many people outside. With the emperor\u2019s quick temper, he would definitely rush in immediately. When he saw this scene, it would really be hard to explain.However, if she did not call out, there would only be the two of them in the room.Helpless, Yue Yan could only look at Xuan Yi for help.Let me wear it for her?Xuan Yi was silent for three seconds. Then, he stepped forward and stretched out his hand. Due to the tight clothes, he accidentally slipped and his entire hand pressed on Yue Yan\u2019s chest.It was soft, very soft, but very firm and full.With a whole hand, Xuan Yi grabbed half of it.Yue Yan was stunned on the spot, and the redness quickly climbed onto her face.Her pale face had never been so ruddy before, and even her fair neck was red.She thought to herself that this rascal actually dared to take advantage of her. However, Xuan Yi still looked young and did not go too far, so she endured it.Xuan Yi retracted his hand and reached out again. This time, he grabbed very seriously. He pinched her clothes and lifted them up. The two snow-white jade mountains had changed shape, but he finally put them on. Suddenly, he retracted his strength and her chest bounced back a few times.Yue Yan lay weakly on the bed.\u201cQueen, I already know the solution to your strange illness. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dYue Yan nodded her head weakly. It was unknown if she was too embarrassed or too itchy.Xuan Yi slowly retreated out.Outside the door, the King had an anxious look on his face.\u201cHow is it?\u201dXuan Yi smiled slightly, \u201cKing, I already know the illness of the Queen. I also know how to deal with it.\u201d\u201cOh? What illness is it!\u201d The King asked anxiously.\u201cPurple flower poison, a strange poison.\u201dThe King was puzzled. He had never heard of the purple flower poison. \u201cBut we have tried many antidotes, but none of them had any effect.\u201d\u201cThis is a strange poison. Ordinary antidotes naturally have no effect. You need a special method to detoxify it.\u201dJust as Xuan Yi\u2019s words fell, a doubtful voice was heard.\u201cCould it be that you can\u2019t diagnose the illness and are making it up here?\u201dXuan Yi ignored his words, he continued, \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to detoxify the poison, and that is to require the King to consume another strange poison and have sex with the Queen. This way, the two poisons can be mixed together, and when they collide, the purple flower poison in the Queen\u2019s body can be detoxified. This is the so-called fighting poison with poison.\u201dAs soon as he said this, everyone was stunned on the spot.Putting aside why this method was so unique, just the fact that the King consumed poison was a very dangerous thing.And he had to consume the strange poison.The so-called strange poison was not easy to detoxify, or even impossible to detoxify.What if the poison in the Queen of the country was not detoxified and the King was infected with the strange poison? That would be interesting.Yan Han did not speak at this moment because he knew that Xuan Yi who proposed this method would definitely attract the opposition of countless people. There was no need for him to stoop to the side.As expected, the first person who stood out to oppose was the eunuch who had been listening for a long time.\u201cBastard! The King\u2019s body is that of a heavenly dragon. How can he do such a dangerous thing?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84: 84Chapter 84: Dual CultivationAs expected, the eunuch\u2019s words attracted a lot of retorts.Even the King\u2019s face darkened a little. He did not believe Xuan Yi\u2019s words at all.If he were to take poison and then engage in dual cultivation, how would he know whether the final result would be a deep cure for the poison in the two substitutes or an even more violent poison?Such a thing could not even be attempted.But this was the only method he had heard of for many years.He wasn\u2019t particularly willing to give up.What if it was effective?Hence, he pondered for a long time before slowly saying, \u201cSenior Xuan, are you lying in any way?\u201dXuan Yi shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in the Beifeng country. I\u2019m only here to use the path.\u201dXuan Yi did not show any signs of lying as he nodded his head slowly.\u201cIn that case, since it\u2019s effective, why don\u2019t Senior Xuan help me treat it?\u201dXuan Yi was stunned. He did not understand what Jiang Zhan was trying to say.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that I\u2019ll consume a strange poison to help you and the Queen cultivate together?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThis time, it was not just Xuan Yi. Everyone present was stunned.\u201cWhat?\u201dJiang Zhan narrowed his eyes slightly, \u201cSaving the Queen, this is a very sacred thing.\u201dEveryone understood Jiang Zhan\u2019s meaning, but they still felt that it was strange.Xuan Yi, on the other hand, nodded slightly, \u201cSince the King is so magnanimous, I\u2019ll give it a try.\u201dAs he spoke, Xuan Yi took out a strange poison from his storage bag.Hundred insect poison.This was a strange poison that was refined by gathering countless poisonous insects. In fact, when they were in the mystic realm, Xuan Yi had released this poison to control the entire scene.\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201dXuan Yi swallowed the poison, and his body immediately emitted a burst of black fog.\u201cSenior Xuan, you\u2019ve worked hard.\u201dNo one but Xuan Yi could do such a thing.If it was anyone else, they might not dare. Only outsiders like Xuan Yi had the courage to do such a thing. Although Wang Hu was also considered an outsider, Wang Hu only had Wang Juan in his heart. He could not be hard on other women at all.After Xuan Yi finished speaking, he slowly retreated back into the room.Unexpectedly, the Queen was currently caressing her body.It turned out that Xuan Yi\u2019s actions just now had already stirred up her flames of passion.Xuan Yi did not say a word. He directly went to the bed and hugged the Queen\u2019s delicate body.Then, he lowered his head and slowly approached her. Their four lips met. It was smooth but soft. The tender red color caused people to have endless fantasies. His tongue knocked open her sworn teeth and entwined them together. Yue Yan let out a soft moan. She seemed to think that this was a dream, her entire body trembled violently.He slowly flattened her. Xuan Yi lifted the gauze on her body, revealing her round and solid thighs. Her beautiful buttocks were big and round. They were pink and supple, long and smooth. Her body was so voluptuous and smooth that it made one lose one\u2019s soul. She was so beautiful that it reached a certain realm.He touched the inner part of her thighs and the bulge between them through the silk underwear. His hand gently caressed it. Yue Yan\u2019s bulge became even softer. Xuan Yi slowly removed her white underwear from her jade-like legs.His left hand, which was holding Yue Yan\u2019s waist, began to slide down. Her waist, buttocks, and then her thigh.Then, in the middle, it went up. His other hand was not idle either. Yue Yan felt Xuan Yi\u2019s hand continuously moving on her body.Xuan Yi used his lips to gently kiss Yue Yan\u2019s fleshy lips. He felt a suffocating pleasure spread throughout his entire body.\u201cMoo moo\u201dWith a soft moan, Xuan Yi\u2019s hand touched Yue Yan\u2019s snowy peak.Instantly, she felt the doctor\u2019s softness and fullness. His two fingers held the pink bean and continuously rubbed it. Sometimes it was gentle, and sometimes it was rough. It made her whole body tremble uncontrollably, and her delicate body went soft.At this moment, the other hand stopped. Yue Yan felt a little finger gently caressing her private area, making her moan so much that even her other fingers unconsciously started to caress her body.Feeling the touch on her buttocks, she felt an electric current pass through her body.\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 Don\u2019t do it where\u2026 It\u2019s so weird\u2026 it feels so weird\u2026\u201dYue Yan did not know any dual cultivation method. Her life with Jiang Zhan was just a casual matter. She had never experienced Xuan Yi\u2019s skilled technique. For a moment, she could not stand it. Her entire body trembled non-stop, and her face turned red.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201dXuan Yi said seriously, \u201cOnly when your body is excited enough to growl can we dual cultivate to detoxify the poison. Otherwise, if the poison is hidden, not only can it not be detoxified, both of us will be in danger.\u201dYue Yan could not hear Xuan Yi\u2019s words at all.After Xuan Yi said that, he kissed her tender lips again, and the hand that was holding on to her breast slowly slid down. Yue Yan felt a hand slide to her lower abdomen, and it stopped at her lower body.His big hand kept caressing and playing with this private area. A finger was secretly inserted into it, but before it could enter, it made her whole body quiver.Water kept spurting out from the guidance, which made Yue Yan extremely excited. It had been a long time since she felt so good. After the tidal blow, Yue Yan\u2019s delicate body once again softened.She opened her eyes with a dry mouth and tongue and found that Xuan Yi was lying on her body. When she was shocked, she was just about to speak when she was pressed down by a gentle big hand again.\u201cAh\u2026 Ah\u2026\u201dUnder Xuan Yi\u2019s flirtatious attack, Yue Yan had completely relaxed. Her body and mind were completely dominated by lust.Xuan Yi carefully observed the mature body of the human character in front of him. He could not help but exclaim in surprise. This was simply a perfect picture scroll. The alluring beauty filled Xuan Yi\u2019s eyes.Yue Yan was like a gentle little lamb, curled up and even trembling from time to time.Her pretty face was flushed red, and her beautiful eyes were closed shyly. At this moment, she was clear, but she did not dare to open her eyes. She was like an ivory statue of a goddess, sweating profusely, and her entire body was limp.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect the Queen\u2019s body to be so sensitive. It seems that it won\u2019t be long before we can start dual cultivation.\u201dThese words caused Yue Yan\u2019s beautiful face to be as red as fire. Her amorous and pure eyes were closed shyly, and her long and black eyelashes covered her pair of beautiful eyes that were trembling slightly.Her fair and delicate shoulders were straight and soft under her neck. In the center of the snow-white dazzling area was a pair of jade-like smooth and plump jade peaks.Her crystal-like snow-white waist that was almost transparent could only be held in one hand. It was extremely soft and beautiful. Her snow-white and smooth feet were soft, so as her lower abdomen. Her long and delicate snow-white legs were clamped tightly together shyly at this moment. She had a pair of pink and round feet that were like raindrops, her soft and innocent round ankles.Xuan Yi\u2019s finger gently slid across Yue Yan\u2019s inner thigh. \u201cQueen, you\u2019re wet.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 oh\u2026 Don\u2019t be like this. Quickly stop. This kind of thing is not allowed\u2026 Ah, what are you doing\u2026 you can\u2019t poke there\u2026\u201dXuan Yi said as if to himself, \u201cQueen, your body is almost excited enough. You can start now.\u201dXuan Yi calmly took off his clothes, as well as all of the clothes on Yue Yan also took off.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: 85Chapter 85: Hedge!!Yue Yan exclaimed, \u201cWhy is yours so big? Can it go in?\u201dXuan Yi replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s alright.\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026 Alright then\u2026 then you\u2026 must\u2026 must\u2026 be a little gentler\u2026 oh\u2026\u201dYue Yan continued to speak in fear. In the language of Xuan Yi, he kissed all the way from Yue Yan\u2019s lips to her lower body, lay on her lower body, and hugged her legs.His lips kissed her private parts. His tongue stuck in and spun around inside, making Yue Yan gasp for breath. \u201cOh\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 mmm\u2026 so comfortable\u2026 so beautiful\u2026 Oh\u2026 I don\u2019t want to\u2026 take it out quickly\u2026 oh\u2026\u201dAfter a long chant, Yue Yan spurted out another wave of Yin water. Her delicate body became limp again. Xuan Yi slowly got up and looked at Yue Yan who was like a sleeping beauty. He slowly aimed at her.The huge hard object slowly approached Yue Yan\u2019s small acupoint, and the huge hard object gently pushed against it.Puchi!Yue Yan let out a soft gasp. \u201cAh\u2026\u201dAs she had just been caressed by Xuan Yi until her entire body was weak, she could only spread her legs and lie there.\u201cPain!\u201dYue Yan suddenly shouted.Even though it was already very smooth, she was still not used to Xuan Yi\u2019s huge size. She was stuffed full by this huge hard object, and it was as if she was suffocating. Soon after, there was pain, waves of tearing pain, it came from her lower body and spread throughout her body.However, the pain came and went quickly. Soon, Yue Yan adapted to Xuan Yi\u2019s size, and a wave of pleasure came from her lower body.Xuan Yi felt a little tired, so he lay down and let Yue Yan sit up.Just for a moment, Yue Yan\u2019s expression was slightly painful, and then she moved up and down a few times before she slowly adapted.Xuan Yi was not really tired, but he wanted to do detoxification.The spiritual energy in her body circulated slightly. Yue Yan only felt a strong suction force coming from her lower body, causing her body to tremble uncontrollably.Very soon, a warm spiritual energy entered her body. She was so excited that she kept gasping.\u201cPuchi\u201dYue Yan\u2019s entire body was limp as she lay on Xuan Yi\u2019s body. Her entire body was as soft as a ball of cotton.Xuan Yi flipped his body and pressed down. At this moment, it was the time to neutralize the poison. How could he stop? Thus, he crazily attacked Yue Yan\u2019s body while circulating his spiritual energy. Very soon, he felt the poison in his body flowing towards Yue Yan\u2019s body.And there was also a wave of poison flowing towards Xuan Yi\u2019s body.The sound of the collision became faster and faster. The two balls of poison also met at their private parts.\u201cAhhh\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 Don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cFaster!!\u201dA huge hard object kept moving forward, going in and out of Yue Yan\u2019s honey cave. On the bed, Yue Yan\u2019s honey left a large area. She arched her jade-like body and constantly panted, her voice tingling.The two of them hugged each other, and their lips soon intertwined. Xuan Yi sucked on her fragrance that was even sweeter than the immortal juice. Their two tongues curled together, and the large palm on the jade peak exerted even more force.She only felt that every time Xuan Yi exerted force, it was as if her body was about to be torn apart.It was painful, but more of it was excitement and enjoyment.As the speed gradually increased, Yue Yan\u2019s body slowly became numb. But Xuan Yi did not have the slightest intention of stopping.A wave of pleasure slowly rose up from her numb body. She felt that her soul was floating in midair.Following that, she panted non-stop, followed by a wave of frenzied trembling.After twitching for more than a thousand times, Xuan Yi\u2019s hard object was so swollen that it seemed like it was about to explode.Yue Yan panted continuously. She had already enjoyed herself to the fullest, but Xuan Yi had let her discover a new world. It turned out that the enjoyment after excitement was even more exhilarating!Yue Yan\u2019s eyes were tightly shut. \u201cAh, it\u2019s so swollen, so comfortable! Oh, you\u2019re really amazing. Hurry up, use more strength!\u201d\u201cAh Ah, I\u2019m finishing! Insert faster! It feels so good\u2026\u201dXuan Yi sped up again. It was not because he heard Yue Yan\u2019s request, but because he could feel that the poison in Yue Yan\u2019s body was about to come out.Yue Yan endured the thrill of trembling and suddenly drained her strength. She could not remember how many orgasms this was, but at this moment, her entire body was covered in sweat. A wave of hot honey suddenly sprayed onto the sensitive dragon\u2019s head, causing Xuan Yi to tremble.\u201cSoon!\u201dXuan Yi couldn\u2019t help but say.The poison slowly gathered, and Xuan Yi tightly hugged Yue Yan\u2019s body, which was covered in sweat. Yue Yan was aroused by this strong feeling again, and her body unconsciously began to cater to it.\u201cNow.\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s dragon head instantly expanded, and Xuan Yi\u2019s hot liquid sprayed into Yue Yan\u2019s honey hole.\u201cSo hot!\u201dUnder Xuan Yi\u2019s shot, Yue Yan tugged at the heart of the flower and spewed out a stream of Yin honey essence again.The two of them stopped and hugged each other, panting.At this moment, the plum blossom black fog that was on Yue Yan\u2019s chest had already faded a lot, but it had not completely disappeared.The poison in Xuan Yi\u2019s body had already completely dissipated.Xuan Yi frowned slightly, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t it completely disappeared? It looks like the poison in your body has already existed for too long, and it\u2019s very difficult to eradicate it all at once.\u201dYue Yan\u2019s face turned rosy. \u201cThen what should we do?\u201dXuan Yi put on his clothes. \u201cLet\u2019s do it a few more times. However, the Queen is already tired after today. We\u2019ll wait for the day to cure the poison.\u201dYue Yan blushed and nodded her head shyly in agreement.After they left, Jiang Zhan came up to them immediately.\u201cHow is it?\u201d\u201cKing, the poison in Queen\u2019s body has already seeped into her bone marrow. It\u2019s basically impossible to remove it all at once. We still need to do it a few more times before it can be completely removed.\u201dThe King nodded his head without being able to see the expression on his face. It seemed that he did not particularly believe it. He hurriedly walked into the room.Very soon, a voice of praise came from inside the room. \u201cGood!\u201dAs soon as he entered the room, he saw that the Queen was tidying up the bed after putting on her clothes. Her face was ruddy, and there was no trace of her former weakness.Not only that, the cultivation of the Queen, who was originally at the first level of the golden elixir phase, had actually become much more solid.\u201cSenior Xuan, I should reward you!\u201dYue Yan\u2019s face turned red, \u201cYour Majesty, please don\u2019t blame me.\u201d\u201cHahaha, no, Yan \u2018er\u2019s body is the most important thing!\u201d\u201cThank you your Majesty\u2019s, for your tolerance!\u201d\u201cQuickly get up, quickly get up, let me take a good look!\u201dOutside the door, Xuan Yi wiped the sweat off his forehead.This Yue Yan looked fierce, but he did not expect that when it came to actual combat, she was even more fierce than she looked!If Wang Hu couldn\u2019t get the poison to flow into the honey, it would be a waste.\u201cI\u2019m tired. I\u2019ll go rest first.\u201dXuan Yi didn\u2019t care about the reward Jiang Zhan mentioned.To be honest, he wasn\u2019t interested in the things here, let alone the reward.Even Jiang Zhan\u2019s position was disdained by Xuan Yi.\u201cMaster, how many more days do we need to stay here?\u201d\u201cAbout three days.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86: 86Chapter 86: Middle EastA few days passed in a flash.During this period, Xuan Yi and Yue Yan had a few more dual cultivation sessions.Yesterday, the poison in Yue Yan\u2019s body was completely removed.The king, Jiang Zhan, was extremely grateful for this. However, Xuan Yi did not make any requests. He said that he needed their help to send him to the Middle East.Today, Jiang Yiyi and the others sent Xuan Yi and Yue Yan into the Middle East.Along the way, they encountered many battlefields full of corpses and blood stains.\u201cSenior, you said that you would help me treat my illness?\u201d asked Jiang Yiyi with a red face.Xuan Yi shook his head helplessly. \u201cThe illness in your body is probably the same as your mother\u2019s. However, the poison has not erupted yet and there is no way to eradicate it. After the poison erupts, you can ask your mother and you will know how to cure it.\u201dJiang Yiyi blushed as she nodded, for she already knew how to solve this problem.\u2026Half a month passed in the blink of an eye in the Middle East.At this time, Xuan Yi had some understanding of the Middle East.\u201cMaster, we are still a distance away from junior sister song\u2019s family. I heard that there is a big competition in the Middle East recently.\u201dThe Heaven Roll competition.This was similar to the sword reverence assembly, but their levels were vastly different.The sword reverence assembly chose disciples, but the Heaven Roll competition chose geniuses.It wasn\u2019t just the geniuses of the Middle East. It also included the geniuses of the Southern Region, the demon region, the Azure region, and many other regions.In fact, this wasn\u2019t just a place for Wang Hu to temper himself, it was also a place for Xuan Yi to temper himself and fight.In the southern region, Xuan Yi had almost no opponents, but he could find many opponents in this competition.The system had issued another mission. Defeating a cult master level powerhouse would give him a powerhouse\u2019s card, which was Bing Yu.As a legendary figure, her strength had even reached the sage realm.Although this reward was only for the trial use of Bing Yu, Xuan Yi still bore great expectations.The Heaven Roll competition was about to start soon.The place of the competition was very close to Xuan Yi, so the two of them directly turned around and headed towards the Heaven Roll competition. As for taking in song Qingxin as a disciple, it had already been delayed for half a month, so they didn\u2019t care about it.The Heaven Roll competition.It was held every three years and was a gathering of countless geniuses of the Azure region.At that time, almost all of the Peerless Geniuses on the regional leaderboards would be present.And they would be ranked on the heaven roll.Not only that, those hidden geniuses who originally had terrifying talent, but didn\u2019t have the heart to compete for the Heaven Roll, would also appear.They couldn\u2019t not compete for first place, because even if they did, so what?It was just a matter of name, there were no actual rewards.In the past, close to one-third of the top rankers of the heaven roll were not from the Middle East!The location of the Heaven Roll was a great city located in the center of the middle sea, which was also the eastern royal city.In fact, the eastern royal city was not only a city, for it was also a power, and was one of the ten great powers of the Middle East.In other words, it was on par with the great powers like the Wu Heaven Sword sect and the Brightmoon aristocrat clan.The city Lord\u2019s name was Donghuang, an expert at the peak of the early stage of the Sage realm.These heaven\u2019s favorites did not have no intention of competing for the first place on the Heaven Roll, which was why they came for the reward after this grand competition.The first place would receive a holy item of a high grade!The second place would receive an immortal item!The third place would receive a Super Holy Pill.They did not want to compete for the first place, but this reward was something they could not refuse.Of course, this was not enough to make the geniuses jealous. What attracted them more was that after the competition was explained, the top 10 could explore the deep sea mystic realm.Besides, they could also bring along their friends or disciples.Frankly speaking, the deep sea mystic realm was the reason why they were eager to participate in this competition.The Saint Mystic realm was only one of the more mysterious mystic realms in the southern region. However, this deep sea mystic realm was different. It was very loud throughout the entire continent. Every time it was opened, the people who entered were all the top forces in the large regions.At the Heaven Roll competition venue.The venue was so vast that it could fit tens of thousands of people. In the middle of the venue was a large circular arena that looked like a cage of beasts.There was a virtual projection in front of the door.\u201cThis should be the ranking of the Heaven Roll, right?\u201d\u201cNot really. This is the ranking of the secret realms in the large regions, which is all the secret realms. The results of the disciples in these secret realms will be sorted and sent to the deep sea secret realm via the deep sea screen.\u201d\u201cBut why are there so few people on this list?\u201d\u201cNot only that, but the people on the list are not very high. Mingyue Xue, over 90,000. Gui Yiyi, over 50,000. It\u2019s a disgrace to the people of the southern region.\u201d\u201cXuan Yi is not bad. He has made the people of the southern region proud. Not only is he on the main list, he is also ranked 16th.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. There aren\u2019t many people on the master list, but soon, there will be more. Maybe the top 12 will all be taken by the people of the South.\u201d\u201cThis time, there are many top-tier geniuses. Even Huang Tiansheng and Cai Lianyi are here. By the way, fairy Cai is still as beautiful as ever.\u201dAs the crowd discussed, they didn\u2019t know how strong the ranking was. After all, they had never entered a secret realm before, and those who were ranked on the ranking were ranked at the top of the secret realms.Nonetheless, after the unification of the deep-sea Mystic Realms, the base of the ranking was magnified.As for the top heaven\u2019s favorites like the Heavenly Saint Son and Fairy Cai, although their rankings weren\u2019t high, it would be easy for them to reach the top after the heavenly ranking competition began.But was that really the case?Of course not.That was because there were more geniuses from other regions standing in front of them.Everyone intended to fight for the top ten positions through the Heaven Roll competition, but the geniuses were far from just the top ten. They were in the hundreds or even the thousands.Even the black sword sect\u2019s Qing Xuzi brought people from the sect.Among them were Bai Weiwei and Lin Yingxue.When Xuan Yi noticed them, he gave them a big hug.\u201cMaster! Master!\u201d\u201cThe sect master said that he would bring us to see the world. I didn\u2019t expect you to be here too.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s on the way.\u201d\u201cAre you going to participate in the Heaven Roll competition too?\u201d\u201cHahaha, Elder Xuan, long time no see!\u201dA man in a yellow robe walked up.Xuan Yi didn\u2019t know this person, but after the incident in the Saint Mystic Realm, Xuan Yi\u2019s name had already spread throughout the entire southern region. It was not strange that someone knew him.\u201cEighth Prince.\u201d\u201cNo need to bow.\u201dAfter the trip to the Mystic Realm, the eighth Prince\u2019s father wanted the third prince to interact with Bai Weiwei more.Of course, he knew his father\u2019s intentions and wanted to interact with Bai Weiwei, who rarely left the sect and did not have the opportunity.Now, the opportunity seemed to have arrived.\u201cOh right, where is Miss Bai Going?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s having her meal now.\u201d\u201cI am hungry too, so why don\u2019t we go together? I happen to have some cultivation problems with the Guan King, and I would like to explore it with Miss Gui.\u201d The eighth prince was very enthusiastic.\u201cNo, I prefer to be alone.\u201dBai Weiwei shook her head, after which she followed behind Xuan Yi.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: 87Chapter 87: Heavenly Ranking Tournament!It was impossible that she would not like him. The real reason was that she did not want to interact with the eighth prince.In these few months. Bai Weiwei had followed Xuan Yi and experienced many things. She was no longer that little girl who did not know anything.How could she not understand the eighth Prince\u2019s thoughts.Moreover, she had met many similar people in these few months.\u201cAlright, take care, Miss Bai.\u201dThe eighth prince then rubbed his nose and left awkwardly.\u201cOh, our eighth prince was actually rejected. Who is so proud that he dares to reject the invitation of a prince like You?\u201dAt this moment, another three people walked towards the eighth prince. They were two men and one woman. The one who spoke was the handsome young man in the lead.The three of them were not very old and were about the same age as the eighth prince. The handsome young man in the lead was called Wu Heng, and the two people behind him were called Lin Tao and Zhou Xue.The three of them had quite a big background, especially the handsome young man in the lead, who was also Wu Heng. He came from a family that had a divine ability realm as their leader. Not only did he have a strong background, but his strength was also much stronger than the eighth prince.\u201cHehe, he\u2019s just a friend. Brother Wu, don\u2019t make fun of me.\u201d\u201cIt seems that the eighth Prince\u2019s charm is still not enough.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go and study the Heaven Roll first. It\u2019s said that many powerful geniuses have come this time. I wonder if we can make it onto the Heaven Roll.\u201dThey did not dare to dream of making it into the top ten. They had come here just to gain some experience and see the world.\u2026In the eastern royal city, fighting was not allowed. However, there was a publicly recognized place for sparring, and that was the martial arts stage.The martial arts stage was about fifty meters tall and was built of sturdy green granite. Even law enforcement experts would find it difficult to destroy it.There was also a layer of defensive formation protecting the surroundings of the martial arts stage, preventing the aftershocks of the battle from injuring the people outside.In fact, there were many such martial arts stages in the eastern royal city. Usually, it was relatively quiet, but now, it was already filled to the brim.The Heaven ranking competition was about to begin, and there were countless geniuses from all over the world. Who wasn\u2019t a competitive person? There were many times more challenges than usual.When Xuan Yi arrived here, a battle was breaking out.There were many spectators because this was a battle between geniuses.Chen Hao, who was ranked 932nd on the heaven ranking, challenged Li Tao, who was ranked 936th on the heaven rankingBoth of them were at the seventh level of the Divine Ability Realm and their rankings were about the same. Initially, they thought that they would be evenly matched.Unfortunately, the truth was that it was a one-sided battle.\u201cChen Hao is stronger than before. Li Tao is going to lose.\u201d\u201cIn the previous battle, after Li Tao defeated Chen Hao, he was severely humiliated. Now, Chen Hao can be considered to have completely regained his dignity. I wonder where Li Tao\u2019s face will go after he loses.\u201dAt this moment, a muffled sound rang out from the dueling platform.Indeed, just as the people around had said, after Li Tao was struck by Chen Hao\u2019s ferocious punch, his body flew backwards and rolled to the edge of the dueling platform.\u201cLi Tao has lost!\u201d\u201cChen Hao has grown too fast. In the previous battle, he did not even have the strength to retaliate when facing Li Tao.\u201d\u201cTrash!\u201dLooking at the disheveled Li Tao who was struggling to stand up, Chen Hao mocked without any hesitation.You!This defeat made it hard for Li Tao to accept. He could have easily crushed him last month.But now, he had lost so miserably.He was already humiliated, but after hearing Chen Hao call him trash, his anger burned and he spat out a mouthful of blood,\u201cHahaha.\u201d\u201cThis Li Tao\u2019s mental endurance is too poor. With just one sentence, he made him spit out blood. Outside the arena, Xuan Yi who saw this scene also laughed.To think that this Li Tao was a heaven\u2019s chosen on the Heaven Roll. This bit of endurance was indeed not good.\u201cIs it very funny?\u201dWith bloodshot eyes, Li Tao swept his gaze around the arena and finally fixed on Xuan Yi.A question mark slowly appeared in Xuan Yi\u2019s heart.He only laughed once. Besides, there were so many people around him, and he wasn\u2019t the only one who laughed. The others laughed even louder than him.\u201cIt\u2019s quite funny.\u201dHe knew that Li Tao, who had been defeated and humiliated by the other party, would definitely feel very uncomfortable at this moment.Nonetheless, Xuan Yi would not spoil him.\u201cLaughing at your mother\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his words, a wave of sword intent came from his face. Li Tao only felt that everything in front of him was starting to turn upside down. In the end, the other side of his face fiercely crashed into the floor with a muffled sound.At some point in time, Xuan Yi\u2019s figure had already disappeared from where he stood. He appeared on one of the battle platforms with one foot, fiercely stepping on Li Tao\u2019s face.\u201cWhat? Aren\u2019t you being a little too controlling?\u201d\u201cFurthermore, I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s laughing, yet you\u2019re looking at me. Do I look like I\u2019m easy to bully?\u201d\u201cJust now, you wanted to scold me, right?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re so capable, why don\u2019t you repeat what you didn\u2019t finish just now?\u201dSilence.The surroundings of the stage were exceptionally quiet at this moment.Everyone\u2019s eyes were wide open as they watched this scene in shock.No one saw when Xuan Yi moved. By the time they reacted, Li Tao had already been stomped on the ground by Xuan Yi.Li Tao had lost to Chen Hao in the battle earlier and appeared to be in a sorry state, but his strength wasn\u2019t affected much.Under such circumstances, he had been killed by Xuan Yi in an instant.No one could see when Xuan Yi had made his move, including Chen Hao on the dueling platform.This meant that the young man who had stepped on Li Tao was much stronger than all of them present!The horrified Li Tao looked at Xuan Yi in disbelief, but he didn\u2019t dare to make a sound.Clearly, he had been frightened by Xuan Yi\u2019s strength.He could understand why Li Tao had been defeated by his former subordinate and humiliated. He must have felt extremely angry and uncomfortable, but he shouldn\u2019t have. He shouldn\u2019t have targeted him.If this wasn\u2019t courting death, then what was that?Xuan Yi didn\u2019t kill Li Tao. After all, killing wasn\u2019t allowed in the royal capital. If he did, it would break the rules of the royal capital, and the royal capital would definitely make a move against him.In order to kill this little Li Tao, it was not worth it to go up against the forces of the eastern royal city.He just needed to teach them a lesson.Xuan Yi was not in the mood to continue strolling around the eastern royal city. Instead, he went straight back to his residence.All the disciples were going to participate in the Heaven Roll Battle, so they all went to cultivate.Three days later, the Heaven Roll competition officially began.Many geniuses from various regions had gathered here.\u201cWelcome to the Eastern Royal City!\u201dThe resources of the Middle East were much more abundant than those of the southern region.At this moment, the city lord of the eastern royal city stood on a floating platform.With a single step, his voice resounded throughout the entire city.Everyone was shocked.This was the city lord of the Eastern Royal City, and one of the experts of the ten regions.No one knew his strength because no one could see through him.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88: 88Chapter 88: The Grand CompetitionThe appearance of the Governor of the eastern royal city attracted a lot of attention.Following that, he waved his large hand and created a virtual environment.\u201cDomain!\u201dAt the moment, a series of gasps could be heard from below the stage.\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean that the governor of the eastern royal city is an expert of the Sage Realm!\u201d\u201cHiss! This is the legendary realm!\u201dMany people were astounded.The Sage realm was simply terrifying!Many of them had rarely heard of the Sage realm, and they didn\u2019t expect to see one today.\u201cThe Heaven Roll competition is divided into four rounds.\u201d\u201cIn the first round, all disciples will enter the territory set by the city lord. Each of them will have a token with a bit of spirit source within it. The time limit is three days. After the period, those who have a lot of spirit source will be able to advance. Other than the token, there are also demonic beasts. They also have a lot of spirit source in their bodies.\u201dAfter the city Lord finished speaking, he waved his hand and brought all the disciples into his domain.Hundreds of thousands of cultivators were all admitted into the domain. Just this method alone was already very terrifying.Not everyone in this domain was in one place. There were also many small worlds.There were numbers written on them.At the same time, a huge screen appeared in the domain world. On it were the names of all the participants present, as well as the numbers of the small worlds they were going to enter.With a little token perception, one could know one\u2019s next small world.\u201cThe 35th Small World is too good, this small world, no heaven\u2019s chosen one!\u201d\u201cI am in 886 Small World. It\u2019s too bad\u2026\u201dAfter the random assignment, there was an explosion of noise in the field.While some people wailed, others were delighted.Looking up, Xuan Yi also saw which small world he was in.\u201cNumber 936.\u201dAs for Bai Weiwei and the others\u2019 names, Xuan Yi also saw number 132. As Xuan Yi didn\u2019t know much about these prodigies, he didn\u2019t know if the group of his disciples was good or not.He only hoped that they could enter the top ten of their small worlds as the system had just issued a side mission.Disciples entering the top ten would be rewarded with a set of alchemy techniques.Alchemy techniques were very rare existences. Even in the Middle East, there were very few alchemy techniques that were spread out. Only alchemy grandmasters might have some, but they were also very precious treasures that wouldn\u2019t be released for the world to learn.\u201cYou Are Xuan Yi?\u201dAt the entrance of the Small World, Xuan Yi was thinking about entering the space when a faint voice sounded.Xuan Yi did not know who this person was, so he nodded lightly and asked, \u201cYes, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI am Situ Bei.\u201dSitu Bei?.Who was that?Xuan Yi raised his head to take a look and realized that this situ bei seemed to be quite famous.He was ranked 46th on the Heaven Roll, but Xuan Yi obviously didn\u2019t know him and didn\u2019t know why he was here.\u201cIn the future, stay away from fairy Cai!\u201dSitu Bei said fiercely.Fairy Cai?Xuan Yi was even more confusedHe didn\u2019t even know who this fairy Cai was.Was there something wrong with this person?Xuan Yi inquired, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201dActually, it wasn\u2019t Xuan Yi\u2019s fault. It was just that Situ Bei only found out about this matter from time to time.He was originally going to talk to fairy Cai, but coincidentally, he bumped into her chatting with the people from her sect. He accidentally revealed that he was very interested in this person called Xuan Yi.Thus, Situ Bei, who adored fairy Cai, couldn\u2019t take it anymore and wanted to find trouble with Xuan Yi.Unfortunately, Xuan Yi did not know about this at all.He was extremely disdainful of Situ Bei\u2019s threat.If it were not for the fact that the entrance did not allow the battle, Xuan Yi would have sent him flying with a single palm strike. There was no need for him to waste his energy talking to that person.\u201cStay away from fairy Cai! Otherwise, you will bear the consequences!\u201dXuan Yi did not know who fairy Cai was at all, but he still said coldly, \u201cWho do you think you are!\u201d\u201cB*stard!\u201d Situ bei cursed. Then ye realized that they could not fight here. Just the conversation between the two had attracted a lot of attention.However, they could fight in the Small World. After all, they still wanted to snatch the source of spirit. Situ Bei suppressed the anger in his heart and suddenly smiled because he and Xuan Yi belonged to the same small world. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you inside.\u201dXuan Yi was even more unafraid. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll wait for you too.\u201dThe cultivators gradually approached the small world.There were also some cultivators who stood at the entrance in despair. This was because there were too many experts on the heaven roll in this small world, and it would be very difficult for them to achieve anything if they were assigned to this small world.\u201c46th on the Heaven Roll, Situ Bei.\u201d\u201c30th on the Heaven Roll, Jian Dongyuan!\u201d\u201c80th on the Heaven Roll, Deji!\u201d\u201c72nd on the Heaven Roll, Goddess of Flowers!\u201dThe group of cultivators wailed non-stop.The more heaven\u2019s favorites they were in the Small World, the less likely they were to enter the next round.Being assigned to this round, strength was very important, and luck was also very important.Xuan Yi entered, and very quickly, he took in a large amount of the surrounding environment.It was similar to a forest, but it wasn\u2019t just a forest. There were many regions, valleys, deserts, and in short, extremely harsh environments. This small world was formed from such environments.Not long after entering, mystic one heard many shouts.The locations of entering the bar world were randomly assigned. It didn\u2019t mean that everyone entered the same place.\u201cFourth-level Demon Beast!\u201d\u201cFourth-level Demon Beast, heaven-dominating boa!\u201d\u201cRun!\u201d\u201cWe just came in and already encountered such a powerful demon beast. Why are we still playing?\u201dXuan Yi casually stopped the two and asked, \u201cWhat are you running for?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a fourth-level Demon Beast!\u201dAfter the two casually said that, they ran in the opposite direction.\u201cFourth-level?\u201dThere were some differences between the power levels of demonic beasts and human cultivators. Level four was similar to the law-enforcing realm, and some level four demonic beasts were even stronger than the law-enforcing realm.This was also the reason why they fled. Many cultivators had only reached the Abhijna realm, and there were even many aurous core stage cultivators. Because there was no cultivation restriction in the heaven roll competition, other than foundation establishment stage cultivators, there were basically all kinds of cultivation levels.However, after this round of selection, the remaining ones were all powerful cultivators.\u201cFourth level\u2026\u201dThere should be a lot of spirit sources, right?With this thought in mind, Xuan Yi ran in the opposite direction of the escaping people.This scene shocked those who stood rooted to the ground and looked at Xuan Yi\u2019s back in disbelief.\u201cIs this kid crazy?\u201d\u201cHe can\u2019t be a fool, right?\u201d\u201cI think he\u2019s crazy about obtaining the source of spirit!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s courting death. Let\u2019s ignore him.\u201dAt this moment, a different voice sounded. \u201cWhy do I feel like he\u2019s an expert ranked on the Heaven Roll!\u201d\u201cIt seems like he really is Xuan Yi!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s him!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89: 89Chapter 89: Rank 4 Demonic Beast!Let\u2019s talk about Xuan Yi.With a glance, he saw this terrifying rank 4 demonic beast.It was a tyrant heaven boa.It was indeed worthy of being the product of a small world created by a sage expert. Its strength was probably much stronger than an ordinary rank 4 demonic beast.However, no matter how strong it was, it was still not Xuan Yi\u2019s match.\u201cUse Star Plucking Technique!\u201dA terrifying pressure brought with it waves of Thunderbolts. Many stars exploded from Xuan Yi\u2019s hand.Following a loud rumbling sound, a wave of smoke dispersed.The Tyrant Heaven Python\u2019s body lay quietly on the ground.The entire place was silent!Soon after that, countless disciples fled in all directions like the wind.\u201cToo terrifying!\u201d\u201cQuickly run, don\u2019t let him target you!\u201dThe crowd quickly dispersed. After all, the contestants here could also snatch the source of spirit, and those who were snatched were eliminated. They didn\u2019t dare to face a terrifying existence like Xuan Yi from the start.Outside the Small World, the city lord of the sage expert frowned slightly.He muttered, \u201cThere\u2019s actually such a terrifying divine ability. Who Is It?\u201dThe deputy city Lord admitted, \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s in the top few of the Heaven Roll.\u201dFollowing that, the city lord nodded. \u201cOnly those in the top few of the heaven roll can create such power.\u201dA Rank 4 demonic beast was too powerful, and it attracted a lot of attention. Xuan Yi was about to step forward to collect the source of spirit, but at this moment, a figure suddenly rushed out.\u201cBr*t, get lost quickly, or you\u2019ll die!\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s face turned cold.\u201cWho are you? How dare you come and steal my things!\u201dAt this time, the surrounding cultivators suddenly increased in number,but they were all very far away.Obviously, they saw someone fighting with Xuan Yi, so they wanted to watch from the side and see who won and who lost. Maybe they could get some spirit source.\u201cThis is Wang Qiang, Liu Ziquan.\u201d\u201cHiss, isn\u2019t this the expert ranked on the Heaven Roll?\u201d\u201cWith the two of them fighting, I\u2019m afraid this person is in danger.\u201d\u201cHowever, these two experts on the Heaven Roll are really shameless. They waited for the other party to finish the battle before fighting to snatch it.\u201d\u201cWell, the weak are prey to the strong. This is the rule.\u201dVery soon, the two of them charged towards Xuan Yi, attempting to strike first.How could Xuan Yi allow them to act so presumptuously in his own house? As he unsheathed his long sword, he charged at the two of them with an extremely terrifying sword qi. Even Xuan Yi himself did not move at all.Sword Rays shot out.Their eyes were filled with disbelief.Blood splattered everywhere.\u201cYou want to snatch my things? Hmph!\u201dWith one move, the two of them were eliminated.They were filled with regret, but the result had already appeared.When the two of them were sent out, they were still in a daze.It took them a long time to realize that they had already been eliminated.And at this moment, a wave of lingering fear rose in their hearts.Fortunately, they were in the Small World.If they had encountered such a terrifying opponent like Xuan Yi in the real world, the two of them would probably have died by now.They looked at each other, and their eyes were filled with lingering fear.Moreover, in the small world, after Xuan Yi used lightning techniques to eliminate the two of them, the surrounding people were all shocked on the spot.Following that, they scattered and fled.Xuan Yi did not chase after these cultivators. To be honest, the amount of spirit source these cultivators could obtain might not be as high as this fourth level demonic beast.Upon collecting the spirit source of this demonic beast, Xuan Yi headed into the depths of the forest again.Along the way, he encountered quite a few low-level demonic beasts. However, Xuan Yi was too lazy to kill these demonic beasts. Killing a hundred of them like this was not even comparable to the spiritual essence given by a high-level demonic beast.At this moment, the sound of a battle suddenly came from the front.A small world would be said to be a few famous cultivators. The Small World itself was not particularly big, and was equivalent to the size of a city. For this reason, it was understandable that danger lurked everywhere. Other than the danger of the demonic beasts, it was more of an ambush between cultivators.Since the rules of the first round allowed the killing of other participants, it was normal to ambush other cultivators.\u201cMadman!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s simply a madman!\u201d\u201cIf you have the ability, go kill the Demon Beast. Why do you want to attack us!\u201dSeveral cultivators cursed while running wildly.And behind them, there was a black-clothed swordsman.Obviously, this black-clothed swordsman was the person they were cursing.\u201cThe rule is that you can hunt contestants. If you can\u2019t beat me, then it\u2019s because you don\u2019t have the ability!\u201dIn this area, under the black-clothed Swordsman\u2019s reaping, there were no more demon beasts and cultivators.At this time, the contestant who was frantically hunting contestants seemed to have sensed something and suddenly looked in Xuan Yi\u2019s direction.In the end, his interest was piqued.This was because Xuan Yi did not run away like the others. Instead, he stood where he was and kept sizing him up.\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid of Me!\u201d The black-clothed swordsman said with a laugh.If it were not for the fact that his body was covered in blood, this smile would be very infectious.\u201cWhy should I be afraid of You?\u201d Xuan Yi asked with a question mark on his head.\u201cI\u2019m in the top 50 of the Heaven Roll. Aren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d\u201cWhy should I be afraid of that?\u201dThe swordsman in Black was immediately interested. He decided not to chase after the cultivators who had fled in all directions. Instead, he stood opposite Xuan Yi.Xuan Yi held his long sword and prepared for a fierce battle.Then, at this moment, a woman with Immortal Qi walked out from the depths of the forest.\u201cGu Qingyi, that\u2019s enough!\u201dSeeing that the situation had happened, Xuan Yi withdrew his aura and planned to take a look first.Because after this woman appeared, the black-clothed swordsman, Gu Qingyi, also withdrew his killing intent.\u201cFairy Cai, why did you come here instead of snatching the Spirit Essence?\u201dFairy Cai?Xuan Yi suddenly remembered that Situ Bei had mentioned a woman called Fairy Cai before?It seemed that this woman and Situ Bei were talking about the same person.Xuan Yi looked over. She had delicate features, a faint fragrance, and exquisite facial features. Unquestionably, she was very beautiful, and the most amazing thing was her figure. Xuan Yi had never seen a figure as beautiful and enchanting as her.Although she was always called Fairy Cai, she was more like a courtesan in a brothel instead of a fairy.Her voice was as pleasant as the chirping of birds in the forest, clear and melodious.\u201cDo I need you to care about what I do?\u201d Fairy Cai said fiercely, then, she continued, \u201cThe Small World is not big to begin with. Other than the experts on our heaven roll, there are also many disciples with average talent. Do you want to eliminate all the disciples with poor talent?\u201dThere were thousands of cultivators in this elimination round, and there were nearly a thousand spots for advancement. Although the fighting was very cruel, as long as a portion of the cultivators were lucky enough, they could steadily advance. For example, the black-clothed swordsman Gu Qingyi\u2019s killing technique, then even a hundred spots would be very difficult to advance.Fairy Cai\u2019s meaning was very simple. He couldn\u2019t bear to watch Gu Qingyi\u2019s actions anymore.Xuan Yi was lucky to be rescued by Fairy Cai.However, what she did not know is, Xuan Yi did not need her help at all.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90: 90Chapter 90: Let Me Do It!\u201cGu Qingyi, don\u2019t force me to do it.\u201dWhile the two were chatting, Xuan Yi checked the spiritual essence on his body, which had already exceeded the level of seven million.Most of it was obtained from some powerful demonic beasts.It was only three days in total. Xuan Yi wasn\u2019t sure if this spiritual essence point could get a good ranking. If the other heaven\u2019s favorites hunted other cultivators like Gu Qingyi, there might be more spiritual essence points.Therefore, Xuan Yi didn\u2019t plan to stay for long. He was pressed for time, so he had to snatch more spirit source points before he woke up.Because the demonic beasts in this place were limited, the cultivators would definitely snatch each other\u2019s spirit source points.While Xuan Yi was thinking about the issue, the two of them finally broke down.\u201cIt\u2019s not my turn to stop the person I, Gu Qingyi, want to snatch!\u201dAlthough Fairy Cai\u2019s ranking on the Heaven Roll was much higher than Gu Qingyi\u2019s, Gu Qingyi wasn\u2019t afraid of her if they really fought. After all, they were both in the small world, so they wouldn\u2019t die. Moreover, if Fairy Cai didn\u2019t have the strength to crush Gu Qingyi, then there would definitely be a lot of consumption, and any consumption in this place was very precious. Without enough spirit source, these heaven\u2019s favorites wouldn\u2019t make a move.Fairy Cai was furious, her small face was covered with frost. Then, she pulled out a piece of colored satin, \u201cHmph! Gu Qingyou, I\u2019ll let you experience what it means to be a heaven\u2019s favorite\u2019s pride today.\u201dRight at this moment, a voice interrupted the two.\u201cYou stand to the side first, I\u2019ll fight him.\u201dAt this moment, Xuan Yi\u2019s voice.However, upon hearing this, the two of them were stunned on the spot.Fairy Cai thought that Xuan Yi had said this because he wanted to act tough in front of her. Hence, she said somewhat angrily, \u201cYou can beat him. He is an existence on the Heaven Roll!\u201dXuan Yi scratched his head. \u201cI should be able to.\u201dXuan Yi did not feel anything when he was looked down upon by a woman. However, being protected by a woman made Xuan Yi feel very strange.On the other side, Gu Qingyi laughed out loud, \u201cHahaha, this kid actually said that he wants to fight with me. Don\u2019t tell me that because you\u2019re being protected by a woman, you feel embarrassed, so you\u2019re deliberately trying to be strong?\u201dFairy Cai then whispered, \u201cYou step back and bring me back to fight with him so that you can find an opportunity to escape.\u201dAfter hearing Gu Qingyi\u2019s words, he was now certain that Xuan Yi wanted to lose face and look for face.However, this was Gu Qingyi, a character with an extremely high ranking on the Heaven Roll. How could he be Xuan Yi\u2019s opponent to look for face?He would be eliminated if he didn\u2019t do a good job. How could this be a joke?In spite of that, Xuan Yi didn\u2019t care about what they thought. He continued to stand in front of Fairy Cai, \u201cWhether we fight or not, we have to admit that time is limited. Let\u2019s defeat them quickly and end everything.\u201dFaced with Xuan Yi\u2019s stubbornness, Fairy Cai was also angry.Therefore, she stood behind Xuan Yi in a fit of pique and pretended that she didn\u2019t want to get involved in this matter anymore.However, the kindness in her heart told her that when Xuan Yi couldn\u2019t hold on any longer, she would help him.Gu Qingyi stopped laughing wildly and said disdainfully, \u201cSince you\u2019re courting death, I\u2019ll fulfill your wish.\u201dHe unsheathed his longsword!Gu Qingyi was also a sword cultivator, so he unsheathed his two sharp swords and attacked his opponent.Originally, Gu Qingyi was very confident that he could eliminate Xuan Yi with one strike. However, as the pressure of sword intent came, his expression changed drastically.\u201cWhat!!!\u201d\u201cSword Intent?\u201dSword intent could be comprehended by a sword cultivator many years ago. It could be said that being able to comprehend sword intent was the greatest pride of a sword cultivator.He, Gu Qingyi, had been a sword cultivator for nearly a hundred years, but he had only touched the embryonic form of sword intent.This man in front of him had actually released sword intent!What was even more unexpected was that in the next moment, the two streams of sword intent collided. In an instant, he felt as if a huge mountain had been loaded onto him, and he was sent flying without any ability to resist.When he heard this, he realized that the only reason he could fly further was because there were more trees in the forest, which acted as a resistance. Otherwise, he would have been able to fly even further.Terrifying!He felt a terrifying pressure from this sword attack.It was a feeling that he could not resist.He only felt this way when he was facing an expert who was much higher in level than him.Nonetheless, Xuan Yi was an existence that was similar to him!In such a situation, not only could he not win, but he did not have any strength to fight back!One had to know that Xuan Yi\u2019s sword attack was only to test Gu Qingyi\u2019s strength. He did not use his full strength. If he used his full strength, Gu Qingyi would be eliminated instantly.In an instant, Gu Qingyi was awakened by this powerful sword intent. In the next breath, he stood up and prepared to escape.However, Xuan Yi did not give him the chance. As he took a step forward and directly came to his side, he slashed out with his sword, causing the mountains and rivers to tremble.Gu Qing\u2019s face was filled with fear. \u201cLet Go\u2026\u201dJust then, this sword strike caused the entire small world to tremble non-stop.In the distance, Wu He, who was ranked 18 on the Heaven Roll, and Lin Xuan, who was ranked 21st on the Heaven Roll, had solemn expressions on their faces as they looked at each other.\u201cWhose work is this? It\u2019s actually so powerful!\u201d\u201cThere are many experts on the heaven roll in our Small World. It might be that expert on the Heaven Roll!\u201dNo matter who it was, this matter shocked them to the core.Yuan Yin was very simple. As an existence ranked in the top 30 on the Heaven Roll, they felt that they did not have the ability to shake this small world. This was the domain of a sage expert!What kind of terrifying strike could shake the domain of a sage expert!They could not help but think of what would happen if this strike struck their bodies.Outside the Small World.Donghuang frowned slightly. Even the deputy city lord beside him had a frown on his face.They had naturally felt that attack earlier.However, they had thought that the attack they had felt earlier was already very strong. They had not expected another attack that was even stronger than the previous one.The main point was that this had happened in the same world. It was very likely that the two attacks had been launched by the same person!In fact, no one knew better than Donghuang how sturdy his small world was!That was a world that even law enforcers could not deny, and the degree of confinement was not inferior to some holy objects!What kind of person could shake a small world twice!This made him unable to help but channel more spiritual energy into the king\u2019s Small World to consolidate it.This was because he was very afraid that if such an attack were to be launched a few more times, it would break the Small World.\u201cCity Lord, I felt a very strong sword intent from that attack just now.\u201dDonghuang nodded. \u201cMe too.\u201d\u201cThis kid is absolutely terrifying, especially this attack. I\u2019m afraid that even I have to take it seriously.\u201dThe Vice City Lord was an expert at the law enforcement realm, and that terrifying attack just now made his heart palpitate.\u201cIt seems that this heaven roll competition will be very interesting!\u201dAfter the city Lord finished speaking, he continued, \u201cFind out who this person is and see if there\u2019s a chance to recruit him into our East Emperor City.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91: 91Chapter 91: Fairy Cai\u2019s Shock!Inside the Small World, Fairy Cai stood rooted to the ground with her beautiful eyes wide open.As her small mouth opened slightly, her face was full of surprise.\u201cY-You\u2026\u201dXuan Yi waved his hand, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me\u2026\u201dFairy Cai was so shocked that she couldn\u2019t speak.\u201cSo you\u2019re so powerful!\u201d She remembered her actions just now and blushed. It turned out that the other party didn\u2019t need her help at all. Fairy Cai was very clear about Gu Qingyi\u2019s strength, and it seemed that Xuan Yi\u2019s Zhang Tai hadn\u2019t used his full strength yet.How could this person be so terrifying?\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me. Just now, I suddenly felt that someone had possessed my body.\u201dFairy Cai was stunned. \u201cOh?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I don\u2019t know who it was, but it was probably my family\u2019s ancestor who had died hundreds of years ago. He saw that I was in danger, so he helped me.\u201dFairy Cai shook her lips and asked with a question mark on her face, \u201cYour ancestor?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dUpon saying that, Xuan Yi didn\u2019t want to stay any longer. He turned around and went to other places to collect spirit essence. This Hu Qingyi was indeed a genius on the heaven roll. He had millions of spirit essence on him. It seemed that many cultivators had been eliminated by him.This also made Xuan Yi understand one thing, which was that killing cultivators was faster and more direct than killing demonic beasts. With a few more talents like Gu Qingyi, Xuan Yi was confident that he could break the 100 million spirit essence.After all, Gu Qingyi alone had brought him three million spirit essence.And this Fairy Cai probably had a lot of spirit essence, but Xuan Yi had no intention of making a move. This Fairy Cai was too naive, and she had just wanted to help Xuan Yi, which made it impossible for Xuan Yi to make a move on Cai Fairy, one of the reasons was that she was so cute.Facing such a cute girl, how could that man have the heart to kill her?\u201cYour old ancestor is still powerful.\u201dAfter Cai Fairy finished speaking, she continued, \u201cYour old ancestor even knows how to collect spirit essence!\u201dWith a faint smile, Xuan Yi said, \u201cHe might have been protecting me in the sky.\u201dCai Fairy didn\u2019t know that Xuan Yi was talking nonsense.But she didn\u2019t expose him. Instead, she said a few more words to Xuan Yi and then said goodbye.Fairy Cai\u2019s aptitude was not bad. Just now, Xuan Yi had checked her aptitude and it had directly increased to 300.Among the group of disciples, there was still no one with more than 300 aptitude!At this moment, the system also presented them with a mission.\u201cSide mission: take in Cai Lianyi as a disciple, obtain a grade one holy pill, reward the host with an increase of three realms!\u201dThree Realms?Xuan Yi was instantly stunned.Currently, he was at level five of the law enforcement realm, and taking in song Qingxin would reward him with two realms, while this Cai Xian would reward him with three realms. Wouldn\u2019t that mean that he would be able to reach the cult master realm very soon?However, Song Qingxin had yet to successfully take in a disciple, and since this Cai Xian had given him a reward of three realms, it would definitely not be so easy to take in a disciple. After all, Cai Xian had her own sect.Temporarily, Xuan Yi put these things aside a the most important thing now was to obtain a good result in the heaven roll competition.After leaving this place, Xuan Yi came to a jungle. This place was very good at hiding.Sure enough, he had only taken two steps when Xuan Yi felt a different scent.He stood on the spot and did not move. He said to the bush next to him, \u201cCome out.\u201dXuan Yi did not make a move directly because there was a familiar aura in the bushes.There was no movement inside.With that, Xuan Yi continued, \u201cDo you want to come out by yourself, or do you want me to chop you and the bushes together?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d the person behind the bushes screamed.\u201cA woman?\u201dThen, a woman walked out.Xuan Yi took a closer look and felt that she looked familiar, but he could not recall where he had seen her before.After searching carefully in his mind, he remembered that she was a disciple of the black sword sect that he had met with Qing Xuzi and the others before.She was a pretty female disciple, who looked very nervous.When she noticed Xuan Yi, she immediately shouted happily, \u201cElder Xuan!\u201d\u201cSenior Sister Weiwei and the others have been talking about you. If I knew it was you, I wouldn\u2019t have hidden.\u201dXuan Yi added, \u201cI thought you guys were here to play and not participate in the competition.\u201dIn fact, even if she did participate, she wouldn\u2019t be able to get a good ranking.\u201cThe important thing is to participate, and what if you get a good ranking?\u201dAs she uttered that, she took out her token and showed it off in front of Xuan Yi. \u201cLook, it\u2019s more than three hundred spirit sources!\u201d\u201cWhat about you? I heard from senior sister Weiwei that you\u2019re her master. You should have gotten quite a lot of spirit essence, right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll scare you.\u201d\u201cHmph, it\u2019s definitely too little, so you\u2019re embarrassed to show it to me, right?\u201dCasually, Xuan Yi threw the token out.Linlin took Xuan Yi\u2019s token and looked at it. Immediately, she was stunned on the spot.\u201cAm I seeing things?!\u201dLinlin\u2019s mouth started to tremble.This was a number that she had not calculated. She looked at it and was shocked because this number was many times more than her!\u201cI said I would scare you.\u201dThen, mystic one took the token and left.Time was tight, Xuan Yi didn\u2019t want to waste his time here.\u201cHey, don\u2019t go yet.\u201dXuan Yi turned around and asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSince you have so many spirit sources, you must be very powerful. This way, I know a place where there are many demonic beasts. Although I don\u2019t know how powerful they are, many powerful people don\u2019t dare to get close to them. Do you dare to go there?\u201dInitially, Xuan Yi had planned to find some cultivators to snatch the spirit sources, but after going to Bantan, she still didn\u2019t find many cultivators. This was because as time passed, there would be fewer and fewer cultivators.Since it wasn\u2019t easy to find human cultivators, and the place Lin Lin mentioned sounded very good.\u201cTake me there. As you mentioned, if there are really many demonic beasts there, I\u2019ll take you through the first round.\u201dXuan Yi did not want to care about him at first, but since she knew about this place, and she was also a disciple of the black sword sect, helping her through the first round was already very benevolent. Moreover, helping her was not a difficult thing at all, it was just a casual move.Upon saying that, Xuan Yi directly stepped into the air.This time, Lin Lin\u2019s mouth opened even wider.\u201cA-Are you a law enforcement stage powerhouse?\u201dLinlin estimated that she had just joined the black sword sect not long ago and had not heard of Xuan Yi\u2019s story. She had only heard from Bai Weiwei that Xuan Yi was very powerful. However, she did not expect that Xuan Yi was actually a law enforcement stage powerhouse.\u201cStop talking nonsense, use all your strength. Do you still want to advance?\u201dMany participants wanted to pass the first round. In fact, there would be some rewards if they could not pass the first round. The higher the rank, the better the rewards.Linlin was naturally no exception.With Linlin leading the way, Xuan Yi soon arrived at a canyon.There were a large number of demon beasts at the bottom of the canyon.In fact, these demon beasts were all high-level demon beasts without exception. There were even quite a number of fourth-level demon beasts.It must be known that fourth-level demon beasts were comparable to the existence of law enforcement experts.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92: 92Chapter 92: Super Powerful OpponentFrom here, one could see several rank 4 demonic beasts.\u201cWait for me here.\u201dUpon saying this, Xuan Yi threw Linlin onto the canyon and flew down alone.Xuan Yi\u2019s appearance quickly alerted the demonic beasts in the canyon.Countless demonic beasts crazily pounced at Xuan Yi.\u201cGood timing!\u201d\u201cControl the huge sword!\u201dJust then, a huge spiritual sword appeared in the canyon, and with Xuan Yi\u2019s shout, the huge sword furiously slashed down!Under Linlin\u2019s shocked light, countless demonic beasts, including those fourth rank demonic beasts, all turned into spiritual source points under Xuan Yi\u2019s sword and crazily rushed into Xuan Yi\u2019s token.\u201cEven the sect master can\u2019t do it, right?\u201dShe was fortunate enough to witness the sect master\u2019s strength, but even though the sect master had already reached the half-step sect master realm, he might not be faster than Xuan Yi when killing demonic beasts.Having seen the old sect master\u2019s strength before, she couldn\u2019t help but compare the sect master Qing Xuzi with Xuan Yi.The result made her heart jump.Although Linlin was only at the second layer of the foundation establishment realm, it didn\u2019t mean that she couldn\u2019t sense the power of those demonic beasts, especially a few of them. She had only felt the power from the sect master Qing Xuzi. Without a doubt, those were fourth rank demonic beasts, and they weren\u2019t ordinary level four demonic beasts. At that time, they were level four demonic beasts that had been strengthened by a sage expert.But in front of Xuan Yi, these level four demonic beasts appeared so weak.Now, she finally knew where Xuan Yi\u2019s terrifying spirit source points came fromIn the arena, spirit source points frantically poured into Xuan Yi\u2019s token.12 million\u202613 million\u202614 million\u202618 million\u202620 million! ! !After reaching 20 million, the spirit source points stil continued to rise!The number finally stopped at 29 million.\u201cNow, the number one shouldn\u2019t be a problem at all.\u201dAlthough he didn\u2019t know how many green source points those prodigies in other small worlds could get, Xuan Yi was sure that they weren\u2019t as high as him.Xuan Yi didn\u2019t kill all the demonic beasts in the valley. Instead, he left ten heavily injured high-level third rank demonic beasts and threw them to Lin Lin.Xuan Yi promised to help him advance, \u201cThese are enough for you to advance to the second round.\u201d\u201cThank you, Senior!\u201dUnknowingly, Lin Lin\u2019s attitude towards Xuan Yi had changed greatly. Even her address had changed to senior.Xuan Yi wasn\u2019t looking for demonic beasts either, for these points should be enough to secure his first place.However, Xuan Yi didn\u2019t know that after the two of them left.A few cultivators came to the canyon.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dIf someone were here, they would definitely realize that they were experts ranked higher on the Heaven Roll.18 Wu he on the Heaven Roll, 21st Lin Xuan on the Heaven Roll!The rest were people from their respective sects.They had been to this canyon before, but because there were too many demonic beasts, even though there were two heaven roll geniuses in the team, they were still unable to defeat these demonic beasts. Only when they left did they go to move people.In the end, they had only left for a short while, and when they returned, all the demonic beasts had died.In fact, these were demonic beasts whose strength was comparable to law enforcement realm experts!But they had all died!\u201cWho was it!\u201d\u201cThey actually have such a method!\u201d\u201cLooking at the state of these Demonic Beasts\u2019 deaths, they were almost all killed with a single sword strike. Even high-level fourth rank demonic beasts were killed with a single sword strike! It\u2019s too terrifying!\u201dIn that situation, they could not help but think that if they were to face these demonic beasts, there was no doubt that it would be impossible for them to kill all of these demonic beasts so quickly.One of the members of the team remarked, \u201cLooking at the situation, I\u2019m afraid that it was done by one person, not a group.\u201d\u201cHhave you ever thought that even law-enforcers among them would not be able to kill these demonic beasts so easily?\u201dLin Xuan frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cA trump card!\u201d\u201cLook at the way these demonic beasts died. The time of their death is almost the same. Let me ask you, do law-enforcers have such a method?\u201dIn response, Lin Xuan and the rest shook their heads.\u201cThat\u2019s right, law enforcement experts don\u2019t have such means. Then this person must have used his trump card. Moreover, this trump card must have been used very quickly. It might be a divine ability like a forbidden technique!\u201d\u201cAs you know, such divine abilities usually have very big aftereffects!\u201dUpon hearing that, Lin Xuan stepped forward and touched the Demonic Beast\u2019s corpse. \u201cThat\u2019s why he left in such a hurry. He even left the Demonic Beast\u2019s corpse here. This is not a small fortune!\u201dAt this point, they all understood what was going on.The person who killed the demonic beast wasn\u2019t very strong. In fact, it was very likely that he used a forbidden technique.If that was really the case, then this person definitely hadn\u2019t gone far.\u201cChase them now!\u201dInstantly, the group of people looked for a direction and flew out.It could be seen that these people were all law enforcement experts.As for Xuan Yi, he really didn\u2019t go far.His thoughts were similar to those of the cultivators.The reason why he didn\u2019t collect all the corpses of those demonic beasts was firstly to catch some demonic beasts. After all, such a strong smell of blood would easily attract some powerful demonic beasts.When that time came, it would be a considerable income.Secondly, it would attract some human cultivators.Humans died for money. When some cultivators saw the corpses of so many demonic beasts, they would certainly come to get them. After all, they were all money!As for the cultivators who were still in the Small World, which one of them wasn\u2019t filthy rich? When they killed two of them, their spirit source points would increase explosively.However, Xuan Yi didn\u2019t expect that the fish didn\u2019t catch, but it attracted the covetous eyes of a group of cultivators.Xuan Yi, who was sleeping on a tree, suddenly heard a voice.\u201cThe trace disappeared here. How could that be possible? Be careful, he might be nearby.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 He can\u2019t have gone far. He\u2019s here. I think he\u2019s in a weakened state.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s split up!\u201dXuan Yi said that as he hid his aura so that they didn\u2019t notice him immediately.However, when he realized that they were looking for him, the mystic man suddenly smiled.Currently, no one was doing business that was losing money, but there were plenty of people who dared to do business that did not care about their lives!The mystic person stealthily followed a cultivator, pulled out a sword, and stealthily touched it.Now that they had already separated, it just so happened that the mystic man had a chance to break through one by one, so he did not have to face the group attack.It was not that Xuan Yi was worried that he would not be able to defeat the group attack, but the group attack was too chaotic. Xuan Yi did not have the confidence to kill all of them. If they ran, there would always be one or two smart people who could escape. If any of them escaped, it would be a loss.After sneaking up, Xuan Yi did not dare to release too strong an attack. Instead, he condensed his spiritual power onto the tip of his sword and stabbed the opponent directly. In the Small World, if one received a fatal attack, they would be definitely eliminated.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: 93Chapter 93: Mission AccomplishedThe cultivator was searching for something when he suddenly noticed a spiritual fluctuation behind him. However, before he could turn around, he had already exited the small world.\u201cAm I disqualified?\u201d\u201cWhat happened? !\u201dHe was dumbfounded as he looked at his surroundings in a daze.After a while, he realized, \u201cD*mn it, I was tricked! Who is so despicable?!\u201dIf Xuan Yi heard his words, he would definitely laugh out loud.Despicable?It was just the law of the jungle!Soon, Xuan Yi reached behind the other person. Just like the last time, he killed the other person before they could react.When this cultivator came out, he was just like the previous one, dumbfounded.Then, when he reacted, the two of them said in unison, \u201cYou were also ambushed?\u201d\u201cYou are too despicable!\u201dJust like that, Xuan Yi quickly eliminated most of the members of the team. Without exception, they did not add Xuan Yi\u2019s true appearance.Meanwhile, Xuan Yi\u2019s spirit source was also rising rapidly. Soon, it broke through the 50 million mark.If Xuan Yi was not sure that he could not get first place before, now he could confirm that the first place belonged to him!In the end, this person was more vigilant.After finding no results, he wanted to meet up with the members of the team. However, no matter how hard he tried, he could not find the liveliness in the team. He could not even sense the aura.Therefore, he gradually realized that something was wrong.At this moment, he suddenly felt a spiritual energy fluctuation behind him.If Lin Xuan was not a heaven\u2019s chosen on the Heaven Roll, he would have reacted quickly by running away from his current position and then looking back. If she had turned her head to look behind her at the first moment just now, then his result would be no different from the ones before him.As their eyes met, the air was silent.\u201cSneak attack?\u201dLin Xuan raised his eyebrows.Putting away his long sword, Xuan Yi casually took out a broadsword.This sneak attack was enough. As expected, it was still not enough. There would always be times when he would miss. However, he was the only one left. Xuan Yi had nothing to worry about. He took out his huge broadsword and pushed it out.Lin Xuan did not realize the seriousness of the problem. He was prepared to fight Xuan Yi with his palm, but before he could make a move, he was eliminated by Xuan Yi.Even after he exited the small world, he was still in a daze.At this moment, many disciples were waiting on the stage, including those who had been eliminated. They were all waiting for the birth of the first place.However, with so many people gathered, there were naturally many people who recognized Lin Xuan.After all, he was an expert on the Heaven Roll.\u201cLin Xuan has been eliminated!\u201d\u201cWhat?! Is there a big shot in their Small World?\u201d\u201cWho knows? In the other small worlds, there aren\u2019t many heaven\u2019s pride experts who have been eliminated.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of powerhouse actually eliminated all these heaven\u2019s favorites? I know that this Lin Xuan doesn\u2019t have any opponents in the sect. Even the law enforcement elder was defeated by him, yet he was actually eliminated!\u201d\u201cWu He is also the successor of the sect, yet he was still eliminated. In my opinion, the waters are too deep and there are too many powerhouses in this heaven roll competition!\u201dAfter Lin Xuan was eliminated, Xuan Yi\u2019s spirit source points had already broken through 60 million!This number was extremely terrifying. Now, Xuan Yi was completely at ease.In the blink of an eye, three days passed.Xuan Yi also exited the small world.Not far away, Situ Bei was also sent out.He was not worried about his first round results. He had also encountered many opportunities in the small world. After obtaining a sum of spirit source, it was definitely not a problem for him to advance to the first round.The only thing he was displeased about was that he did not meet Xuan Yi in the Small World. He attributed this reason to Xuan Yi intentionally hiding from him. After all, he had already circled the small world once and did not discover Xuan Yi\u2019s figure. Since Xuan Yi was not eliminated, then he must be in the Small World. Since that was the case, why didn\u2019t he meet her?Then the answer was obvious. Hide from him.A loud sound came from the sky.A huge screen appeared in midair, where everyone could see it.Donghuang stood at the top of the venue, next to the screen.Many people were very happy when they saw the rankings on the screen.\u201cI\u2019ve advanced!\u201d\u201cHahaha, I\u2019ve advanced!\u201d\u201cJust a little bit more, just a little bit more!\u201d\u201cIf there had been one more, even if it was just a rank 2 demonic beast, I would have advanced!\u201dAt this moment, everyone was paying attention to their rankings and did not look up at the top few.After the rankings were released, some people were happy, while others were sad.Those who were excited were naturally those who had advanced to the first round, while those who were just a little bit more away from advancing were more miserable than anyone else.Xuan Yi glanced at the list. The few disciples did not disappoint him. The three Ming disciples had all advanced.Although they were not ranked high on the list, they had still advanced.\u201cDing! Congratulations to the host for completing the side mission. You have received a reward to increase your cultivation by one level.\u201d\u201cBang!\u201dThe spiritual energy in his body surged. Following that, Xuan Yi felt that his cultivation had increased quite a bit.\u201cComprehension: Void Sword Domain!\u201dAs expected, not long after the list was published, the system had completed the mission. Although it was a side mission, the reward was still very generous, and it allowed Xuan Yi to comprehend the sword domain!One had to know that anyone who touched the word \u2018domain\u2019 was something that only a cult master realm expert could touch.And although the void sword domain could not compare to a cult master realm expert\u2019s domain, it could still be considered an extremely powerful killing move.This was something that only a sect leader could comprehend!Xuan Yi knew that his strength had increased by more than a little. Now that he had the sword domain, he was confident that he could fight against a sect leader!Sword Domain.Putting everything else aside, other than the sage-level Donghuang, none of the sect leader experts that Xuan Yi had met before actually possessed a domain!There was not a single one in the entire southern region. Even Qing Xuzi had not comprehended a domain.Who said that law enforcers and sect leader-level experts could not fight? This rule would be broken by me!Just as Xuan Yi was getting excited, a clamor suddenly broke out in his surroundings.It turned out that the first round\u2019s top 10 rankings were about to be revealed.Previously, those who had listed the 11th to 10,000 rankings had been curious as to why their names had not been found.Now, it was time to reveal the top 10.Many people held their breaths while staring at the screen.As the sound of the gong sounded, the 10th place slowly appeared.Tan Ji: 10th placeSpirit source points: 1564456!\u201cIs this the genius of the Tan Family? He actually only reached the 10th place.\u201dThis Tan Ji was quite renowned. When he was 10 years old, he had already reached the Golden Elixir realm. This was the first case in the entire Middle East which shocked many experts. He could be said to be a true genius!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Many people were looking forward to who would be in the first nine places.Such a result was already considered very good. After all, it was a competition among the genius disciples of the ten great regions. However, it was not particularly outstanding for Tan Ji.After the tenth place, the ninth place slowly appeared.Kong Sheng!Ninth place in the first round!Spirit source points: 1652,856!This individual\u2019s ranking on the Heaven Board was not high. He was ranked outside of the fiftieth place.\u201cKong Sheng actually gained the ninth place in the first round!\u201dMany people were shocked.\u201cThis Kong Sheng is probably going to become the Dark Horse of this year\u2019s Azure Region Grand Competition!\u201dKong Sheng didn\u2019t come from any of the top ten powers. He didn\u2019t even come from any major sect.In the entire sect, there was only one master, Old Man Kong Shan, and a few fellow disciples.\u201cOld Man Kong Shan, Congratulations. Your disciple is not bad.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be so good at teaching disciples.\u201dIn the Eastern Royal City, Old Man Kong Shan listened to the praises of the people around him, and his face was filled with pride,His heart was already bursting with joy.After ninth place was eighth place.It was Qin Yuan.He was ranked in the top ten on the Heaven Roll, but he was ranked eighth in the first round this time. He could be considered a regular existence.Seventh Place: Ning Xue 1856556Sixth Place: Ming Lanyue Shu 2015413Fifth Place: Duan Changkong 2541565Fourth place: Shen Yueyang 2886453The announcement was made one point at a time.The Governor of the eastern royal city continued to shout, \u201cNext is the top three in the first round, and the final winner of this competition!\u201d!During the announcement of the first few rounds, the disciples of the Black Sword sect were also eagerly looking at the rankings.Linlin was even more excited because he had seen his name in the top 10,000, which meant that he had successfully advanced, and the pills that were rewarded for advancement were existences that even the senior brothers of the supernatural state coveted.On the other hand, the other black sword sect disciples beside him were in a very low mood.Because they hadn\u2019t advanced. Besides Bai Weiwei and elder Xuan\u2019s disciples, only Linlin had advanced.Hearing Lin Lin\u2019s words, all of them cast curious gazes.They even suspected that they had heard wrongly.They were clear about Linlin\u2019s cultivation. Even they couldn\u2019t beat her, so how could she advance?Foundation establishment stage, a level that couldn\u2019t even be considered as cannon fodder, could she advance?What a joke!Many of them were golden elixir realm experts. They couldn\u2019t even be ranked in the top one million, yet Linlin could actually be ranked in the previous night?How could it be possible!This was, Qing Xuzi also said sternly, \u201cLinlin, I brought you here to let you see the world. There are many people who let you come here to learn how to deceive people.\u201dQing Xuzi believed that Bai Weiwei and the others could advance, but he didn\u2019t believe that Linlin could advance. He was very clear about Linlin\u2019s cultivation level.Hurriedly, Linlin said, \u201cLook over there, it\u2019s a few thousand six hundred and sixty! Is it me? !\u201dShe was a little unconvinced.They followed his gaze and, as expected, Linlin\u2019s name was hanging on it.At this moment, question marks appeared on their heads.Wasn\u2019t this the same name?How did he do it?As there was a possibility of having the same name in the competition, they simply wrote down the background of the participants in the rankings. Behind Lin Lin\u2019s name was written the name of the mysterious sword sect.This couldn\u2019t be wrong!They couldn\u2019t believe that they hadn\u2019t even succeeded in advancing. Compared to their strength, wasn\u2019t this Lin Lin thousands of miles away?What a joke!\u201cHow did you advance to the next rank? How did you get so many spirit sources?\u201dAfter realizing that something was wrong, Qing Xuzi immediately asked.\u201cHehe! Of course, I didn\u2019t do it by myself! I met an acquaintance in the small world. I helped him, and he helped me advance.\u201dQing Xuzi and the others frowned slightly.\u201cLook, he\u2019s going to be the next first place.\u201dEveryone looked up at the top three who hadn\u2019t been announced yet.The others were a little confused, thinking that Linlin had sold her looks in exchange for a chance to advance.Only Qing Xuzi looked at the screen that didn\u2019t pick a name as if he had guessed something.\u201cJunior Sister Linlin, the first place hasn\u2019t been announced yet. How Do You Know Who\u2019s first?\u201d\u201cOf course I know. It must be him.\u201dOn the other side, the Tian family.This was a reclusive family.And at this moment, at the residence where the Tian family was located.An old man stood in front of the door and said softly to the inside, \u201cElder Tian.\u201dTheir family wasn\u2019t considered a small family. It was just that they usually kept a low profile. In fact, their true strength wasn\u2019t low.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dFollowing a brief hesitation, that person said, \u201cI saw the young Miss\u2019s name on the advancement list.\u201d\u201cThis joke isn\u2019t funny.\u201dHow could he not know the strength of his clan\u2019s young miss? Not to mention the advancement list, to be able to bid for within one million places was already considered burning incense!The possibility of advancing was very low. Participating in this first round was just to join in the fun.The newcomer continued, \u201cI\u2019m really not joking. If you don\u2019t believe me, Look!\u201dElder Tian raised his head. As expected, he saw Tian Linlin\u2019s name on the 9000-plus seats.He couldn\u2019t help but fall into a deep doubt.When did the young miss become so strong?He was so shocked that he shouted in disbelief, which shocked his colleagues.So, could it be that Tian Linlin was a genius herself?It seemed that it was right to let him join a sect to train!\u201cQuick, call Miss Back Home!\u201d\u201cWait!\u201dHe hesitated again. Could it be that Tian Linlin only had such results in the Black Sword sect? If she turned into trash after leaving the black sword sect, then it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t, let him continue to stay in the mystic sword sect to train.\u201dEven so, he still laughed out loud happily.\u201cI have thought that a member of my mu family would be able to rank in the top 10,000 in the Heaven Region One day! What a great honor! This is something that no one in the Tian family\u2019s genealogy has ever done before!\u201dThe top three rankings were about to be revealed.Everyone held their breaths.The people from the black sword sect were the same.They were all very curious as to who this expert who let Linlin advance was!Was it the person they had guessed in their hearts.On the other side, Fairy Cai was also incomparably excited.Her ranking was somewhat different from others. Her source of spirit wasn\u2019t snatched, nor was it killed by demonic beasts. Instead, it was given to her by someone else.After countless male cultivators saw her, they directly gave her spirit source to him and then withdrew. Just like that, they directly sent her into the top three.From this, it could be seen that Fairy Cai\u2019s charm had reached a terrifying level.And she was also very confident about this first place.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95: 95Chapter 95: The Result Was Questioned?Soon, the third place was revealed.Cai Lianyi.Spirit source: 3464564What?!It was only the third place!Many people were dumbfounded.Fairy Cai had only obtained the third place!She had gathered the spirit source of countless male cultivators, but only managed to obtain the third place.Did the remaining two mean that there were more than the number of male cultivators combined?Soon, the second place was revealed.Jian Chen.Spirit source: 4564623This terrifying number shocked many people.More than four million spirit source! !But even so, it still made countless people dumbfounded.Undoubtedly, Jian Chen was a genius of the supreme sword sect in the Middle East.He was known as the strongest monster of the Supreme Sword sect in thousands of years! !Four million spirit source points were sufficient to prove how strong he was. It was close to a million more than fairy Cai\u2019s battle!However, this genius of the Supreme Sword sect.The Genius of one of the largest sects in the Middle East was only ranked second?Even Jian Chen himself was very surprised.However, this result was already his limit. At least, it had already surpassed the previous result!\u201cFirst place, who is it?\u201dCountless people racked their brains trying to figure out who the first place was.Who else was stronger than a monster like fairy Cai and Jian Chen?First Place: Xuan YiSpirit source: 52648923\u201cI know this mystic one. She still needs to be ranked in the tenth place on the Heaven Roll. She is a well-deserved genius.\u201d\u201cMore than five million spirit source points, how terrifying!\u201d\u201cIndeed, to be able to crush this Jian Chen, he is really awesome!\u201d\u201cHey, wait! !\u201d\u201cTen million, ten million\u2026 ten million! ! !\u201d\u201cNo, not less than five million, but more than 50 million spirit source points! !\u201dThe person who spoke almost roared out in disbelief.More than 50 million spirit source points, what a terrifying number!In the Black Sword Sect, Qing Xuzi\u2019s face was flushed red. \u201cGood!!\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s result had directly crushed all the geniuses, and this made his heart rise with boundless pride!With such an elder, why worry about the sect not spreading its glory!!It was simply a long face!Now that the Black Sword sect\u2019s name was on the map, if it were to be heard, it would really be the Middle East!Certainly, the most resounding name was still Xuan Yi.Because he did not simply surpass the second and third place, but directly crushed them!He surpassed them by tens of millions of spirit source points! !Terrifying!Countless people were boiling with excitement.They counted again and again, afraid that they had counted wrongly.But after counting back and forth several times, they still did not make a mistake!\u201cI\u2019m blind!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also blind!\u201d\u201cIs this person a devil?\u201d\u201cHe actually exceeded tens of millions of spirit source points!\u201dCountless people from the large sects were shocked.This was a situation that had never happened since the appearance of the Heaven Roll Competition!Of course, there was a huge gap between the first and second place, but it was not as terrifying as this!The Supreme Sword Sect\u2019s sect master looked at Xuan Yi\u2019s ranking and quickly said to the people behind him, \u201cInvestigate, investigate his background!\u201dAt the same time, countless sect masters had the same reaction.With such a genius appearing, it was impossible not to investigate him thoroughly.At this time, Linlin also said to the people of the mystic sword sect, \u201cJust him, just him, you guys don\u2019t know. Back in the canyon, with a wide sword, he could directly kill dozens of demonic beasts with one slash! There are quite a number of level four demonic beasts in there!\u201dFairy Cai also stared at the first place and felt a little lost. He knew about Xuan Yi and had heard a lot about him, but he had never seen Xuan Yi before. and at this moment, Xuan Yi\u2019s face was hanging beside the first place.Looking carefully, wasn\u2019t this the person she saved?No, no, she wanted to save him, but in fact, he didn\u2019t need her to save him.\u201cSo it\u2019s him. He\u2019s Xuan Yi.\u201d\u201cH-He\u2019s so strong\u2026 I even said I\u2019d protect him.\u201dOn the other side of the venue, Situ Bei\u2019s face was gloomy and his body was trembling slightly.He looked at the name at the top of the list in disbelief.Xuan Yi was actually number one!And he had surpassed number one by so much. Situ Bei couldn\u2019t believe it for a moment, so he suddenly thought of something and barked, \u201cIt\u2019s fake! He must be cheating!\u201dThis sentence caused many people to agree!Xuan Yi had surpassed the second place by too much, which was an impossible period, and the only explanation was that Xuan Yi had cheated.Although they did not know how he had cheated, he must have cheated.People always liked to hear the answer they wanted, not the truth.Therefore, Situ Bei\u2019s doubts did not get refuted by others. Instead, they agreed even more strongly!\u201cCheating!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s cheating!\u201dAs more and more people shouted, the public also believed that Xuan Yi was cheating.Some people did not even know what had happened and began shouting as well.For a moment, the noise was so loud that the entire venue was as noisy as a market town.These voices also attracted the attention of a large sect.\u201cDid he cheat?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Who can cheat in the domain of a sage?\u201d\u201cIndeed, what cheating method can fool the Sage\u2019s eyes?\u201d\u201cBut, how do you explain the fact that he has so many spirit sources?\u201dUpon hearing what the person next to him said, he started to hesitate.\u201cMaybe he really has a method that can fool the sage.\u201dAs one\u2019s voice grew louder and louder, even the Eastern Emperor City Lord began to suspect something.This was because within a small world, the total number of spirit source points was less than 100 million.At the moment, nearly half of the spirit source points were in the hands of mystic one.How was this possible?However, he was confident in his own small world. Not to mention Xuan Yi who was a law enforcer, even a cult master level expert would not be able to cheat in it!Therefore, he stretched out his hand and said in a loud voice, \u201cSince everyone has doubts about this matter, I will check Xuan Yi\u2019s image and release everything about his manager in the Small World.\u201dHowever, Xuan Yi did not care at all. In any case, they could say whatever they wanted, for Xuan Yi knew very well that he did not cheat at all.\u201cXuan Yi, do you have any objections?\u201d\u201cNo, but since we\u2019re going to check it out, how about some gambling?\u201dThe eastern Royal City Lord nodded. After all, he was doubting Xuan Yi. He didn\u2019t even have any evidence and yet he wanted to check the other party\u2019s image. One had to know that this was related to battle techniques, hidden cards and other secrets: \u201cThen, if you cheated, your cultivation will be abolished. If you didn\u2019t cheat, I\u2019ll represent everyone and compensate you with a holy artifact. How about that?\u201dXuan Yi nodded: \u201cOkay!\u201dThen, an image slowly appeared in the middle of the big screen, and the person on it was Xuan Yi.The picture had been flashing since Xuan Yi entered the Small World.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: 96Chapter 96: Demon Realm, Chess Palace!!As the screen kept flashing, countless people perked up and carefully looked at the cheating parts. However, the more they looked, the more shocked they became. They were shocked by Xuan Yi\u2019s terrifying methods.They could feel the power of those few swords just by looking at the screen.Because there were three days in the small world, this screen did not play little by little. Instead, it was sped up many times.This also caused many people to miss out on many of Xuan Yi\u2019s attacks.Until the Demon Beast Canyon, countless people were shocked.Was this a one-sided slaughter? One had to know that there were many level four demonic beasts here. What kind of existence was a level four demonic beast? It was an existence comparable to a law enforcement realm expert!They were all harvested just like chives?!Countless people were so shocked by the scene in front of them that they were speechless.\u201cIf it were me, I\u2019m afraid that I would be torn to shreds by these demonic beasts, let alone killing them.\u201d The person who spoke was a divine ability realm cultivator.Divine ability realm was considered an expert in some clans. However, when faced with countless demonic beasts like this, they were still somewhat afraid. It could be seen just how terrifying these demonic beasts were.\u201cNot to mention the divine ability realm, even law enforcement cultivators would lose a layer of skin if they went in!\u201d\u201cXuan Yi is very terrifying. He is also a law enforcement realm expert, but he can actually kill these demonic beasts in an instant!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t see through his strength!\u201dThe scene froze.Everyone in the venue held their breaths.This was because no one could find any evidence of Xuan Yi cheating in these scenes.What else was there to say?There was nothing!They stood rooted to the ground in a daze.At this moment, Donghuang stood out and took out a holy item. At this moment, a holy item shaped like a cup appeared, \u201cThis holy item can produce an endless amount of purple spirit holy water. It will be of great help to cultivators in their cultivation.\u201d\u201cAs everyone can see, Xuan Yi did not cheat. Since this is the case, then this matter is settled.\u201dXuan Yi was not too interested in this holy item, but he took it over, prepared to see which disciple needed it before throwing it to another disciple.Just as Donghuang\u2019s voice fell, Xuan Yi suddenly flipped over and flew out.\u201cSettled?\u201dAs his figure flew into the venue, a disciple suddenly let out a scream.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dXuan Yi did not stop and continued flying in the venue. There were bound to be a few screams along the ropeway.Donghuang watched all of this as he stroked his chin with one hand.Very soon, Xuan Yi flew back to his original spot.The cultivation bases of countless disciples in the places he had been to, were crippled.These were the people who had been clamoring earlier.Xuan Yi did not think that this matter was over. Those who had been clamoring earlier had their cultivation bases crippled by him.This was the outcome of framing him.As the Master of the heaven ranking competition, Donghuang naturally could not allow Xuan Yi to do such a thing. Hence, just as he was about to do some punishment, a burst of thunder suddenly rang out in the sky. Following that, a huge black hole was torn open in midair.A few figures slowly walked out from the crack.These people seemed to have come with ill intentions!\u201cWho are they?\u201dLooking at the sudden arrival of more than ten people, countless exclamations sounded out.\u201cChess King, what do you mean!\u201dA majestic voice, mixed with anger, spread throughout the entire eastern royal city.Just now, Donghuang had already suppressed his anger, but the sudden appearance of a few people had clearly crossed his bottom line, and had even affected the heaven ranking competition.\u201cHahaha, there\u2019s no meaning to this. I heard that your Middle East is holding a heaven ranking competition, so they brought a few brats from my Chess Palace to join in the fun. Donghuang won\u2019t not welcome them, right?\u201dIn the crowd, the black-robed old man in the lead was indifferent to Donghuang\u2019s anger.\u201cChess Palace?\u201dThe moment the black-robed old man spoke, there were some who were puzzled, but at the same time, there were also some who were shocked.The ones who were puzzled were naturally the people who did not know what faction this Chess Palace belonged to.And the ones who were shocked were obviously the people who knew the origins of this Chess Palace.\u201cThe Chess Palace is the overlord-level strength of the demon region. There is no one like it. For example, in the Middle East, there are ten major factions, but only the demon region has overlord-level strength. That is the Chess Palace!\u201d!The Chess Palace unified the entire demon region. Among them, there were dozens of law enforcement experts, and even a few sect master-level. Although their seven palaces do not have any sage experts, just the sect master-level was already comparable to all the factions in the Middle East.\u201dIt was still unknown. When someone explained it, these people were somewhat speechless when they found out.The ten magnates of the Middle East, as well as the forces in the ten regions, had already been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. And this Chess Palace did not belong to the ten regions.When they found out that even the ten magnates of the Middle East could not compare to the Chess Palace, how could they not be shocked!The reason why they did not know about the Chess Palace was mainly because the Chess Palace had been destroyed once before.Hundreds of years ago, the experts of the ten regions had joined hands to destroy the Chess Palace. The main reason was that the Chess Palace was too powerful and arrogant. Its actions were too presumptuous and had angered many factions. As a result, several large factions of the ten regions had joined hands to destroy the Chess Palace.Of course, the factions that had joined hands had also suffered heavy losses.However, after only two years, the Chess Palace had once again made a comeback and quickly regained its former glory. The factions that had once tried to make a move on him had not recovered as quickly as he had.However, in one night, these large factions and sects had all evaporated.All that was left was a pile of ruins.After that, many factions were dissatisfied with the Chess Palace\u2019s actions and went against it.However, without exception, all suffered a crushing defeat and disappeared.Just like that, a long time passed. It was as though the Chess Palace had suddenly changed. It did not leave the demon region nor did it offend any other factions.However, the sudden appearance of the Chess Palace\u2019s people caused many people to have a thought.The appearance of the Chess Palace made them feel extremely uneasy.Donghuang said mercilessly, \u201cYou are not welcome here! You can take your people and leave.\u201d\u201cThe ten people behind me are the ten most outstanding disciples of our Chess Palace. Among the younger generation of the Middle East, as long as you can defeat the ten of them, I will take my people and leave.\u201dAfter saying this, before Donghuang could reply.One of the ten chess palace disciples behind him walked out.\u201cMy name is Mo Qi. I\u2019m ranked 10th on the demonic rankings in the northern region. Who among the trash of the Middle East dares to come up and fight me?\u201dThe Middle East had the heaven rankings, and the demon region naturally had their own genius rankings, and that was the demon rankings!Mo Qi\u2019s provocation caused the anger of many heaven\u2019s favourites to soar to the sky.The Heaven region was too competitive, and it was obvious that they could no longer continue.Even if they had to continue, they had to solve the problem in front of them.Immediately, the Heaven\u2019s list geniuses walked out.\u201c17th on the Heaven\u2019s list, Jian Kong!\u201d\u201cJian Kong, you can do it!!!\u201d\u201cGo up and teach him a lesson. Let these monsters know how powerful our Heaven\u2019s list geniuses are!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: 97Chapter 97: One Strike!!! Death!!!\u201cJian Kong, kill him and tell him that this is the Middle East, not a place where they can act wantonly.\u201dThere were also some people who felt that it was not Jian Kong\u2019s turn to make a move against a mere existence ranked tenth on the demonic rankings.\u201cMake your move. Remember, the person who defeated you, Jian Kong!\u201dJian Kong was an expert in the law enforcement realm. There were also some people who felt that a mere tenth on the demonic rankings did not need Jian Kong to make a move.In the eastern royal city, countless people cheered for the surveillance cameras.Jian Kong\u2019s weapon was an agile longsword. He was a powerful sword cultivator. Although his realm wasn\u2019t the highest, he was still considered an extremely powerful existence. He was also an expert who had comprehended the embryonic form of sword intent.Although his realm was only at the first level of the law enforcement realm, if they were to really fight, his strength was comparable to the second level of the law enforcement realm.One had to know that the higher the level, the higher the possibility of skipping level.And this Mo Qi was an existence of the same level as him.But the cultivation of the cultivators of the demon region had never been regular.\u201cDefeat me?\u201dAs soon as Mo Qi finished speaking, Jian Kong made his move.The first move was a sure-kill.\u201cGod-exterminating sword!\u201dThe long spear condensed with spiritual power shot out fiercely at Mo Qi.\u201cGod-exterminating sword!\u201d\u201cIs this a top-grade secret technique of the sword sect?\u201d\u201cThe first move is a killing move. It seems that Jian Kong intends to use it to establish his power.\u201dThe long sword shot toward Mo Qi with lightning.Then, faced with this powerful attack, Mo Qi sneered and shook his arms. Black spiritual energy, which was like black silk, came out from his body and wrapped around his arms. Mo Qi didn\u2019t have a weapon, so his fists were his weapons.He punched out.Countless narrow black holes appeared in the air, and the void shook.Under the gaze of countless people, the long sword was sent flying.Jian Kong was controlling the flying sword, but this attack caused him to suffer an extremely powerful backlash. He spat out blood and flew out as a bandit.Silence!A deathly silence!Jian Kong was defeated with just one attack!This made all the Middle Eastern cultivators present find it hard to accept.Looking at Mo Qi, who was slowly withdrawing his fists, everyone felt their scalps go numb.Instant Kill!What kind of concept was this!The Heaven\u2019s favourites ranked in the top ten on the Heaven list were instantly killed!The arrogant words from before seemed very pale at this moment. There were even quite a number of cultivators who gritted their teeth and didn\u2019t say a word.They had nothing to say. After all, they were the ones who had been the most arrogant earlier. However, Jian Kong hadn\u2019t even been able to withstand a single move. What else was there to say? Let others ridicule him!\u201cThis person\u2019s strength isn\u2019t below mine.\u201dSecond place, Jian Chen was also a heaven\u2019s favourite of the sword sect, and this Jian Kong who had been sent flying was none other than his junior brother.At this moment, even Jian Chen, who was ranked second, felt his heart sink.He had defeated Jian Kong with a single punch. With his strength, he would probably be ranked in the top three on the Heaven list.And this was only the weakest disciple of the other party\u2026The gap between the ten regions of the Middle East and the demon region was actually so huge!In mid-air, Donghuang\u2019s expression was somewhat unsightly.Although he had only lost one round, this round had dealt a huge blow to the momentum of the entire Middle East.Not only had he lost, he had also suffered a crushing defeat!At this moment, the entire eastern royal city was completely silent.\u201cIs this the expert on your Heaven list? I think he is only so-so! He couldn\u2019t even take a single move from me, yet he still dares to say that he isn\u2019t trash!\u201dMo Qi laughed loudly and mocked loudly.His words caused the expressions of all the cultivators in eastern royal city to become even uglier.But no one refuted him.Why? Because they couldn\u2019t beat him!\u201cWho else dares to fight me!\u201dAt this time, people from the Middle East didn\u2019t dare to let the cultivators fight blindly. After all, if they lost again, it would be extremely embarrassing.Thus, no one in the entire Middle East dared to accept the challenge.\u201cThen this group of trash doesn\u2019t dare to accept the challenge? Are they afraid that I\u2019ll beat them to death? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll show mercy!\u201dCountless people were angered by his words until their faces turned red. However, no one accepted the challenge. Among them, a few hot-blooded youths couldn\u2019t stand his ridicule and wanted to fight. However, they were all stopped by the people beside them.There was no other reason. Even the experts on the Heaven list weren\u2019t a match for this person. If ordinary cultivators like them were to go up, they would simply be sending food to the table!\u201cYou people on the Heaven list are cowards. You\u2019re really something!\u201d\u201cB*stard!\u201dA person rushed out from the crowd.\u201cI, Zhao Ying, am here to accept the challenge!\u201dAfter saying this, this cultivator called Zhao Ying directly flew out. However, just as he flew into the air, he suddenly saw Mo Qi\u2019s figure in a daze. Then, Mo Qi\u2019s figure suddenly disappeared and instantly appeared behind him.Zhao Ying\u2019s expression changed. He did not expect Mo Qi to be so fast. In an instant, he had arrived in front of him.By the time he reacted, Mo Qi\u2019s fist had already landed, bringing with it a series of air-piercing sounds. Sensing the vigorous aura, Zhao Ying hurriedly dodged. However, because Mo Qi\u2019s speed was several times faster than his, he failed to dodge, he was directly sent flying by the fist.He landed on the ground, creating a large crater.When the thick smoke dispersed, they discovered that Zhao Ying had already died!He was dead!He had directly killed the cultivator of the Middle East in front of so many of them!At this time, Mo Qi suddenly smiled, \u201cAiya, I\u2019m really sorry. I didn\u2019t control my strength and directly killed your genius. I apologize, I apologize.\u201dAlthough he was apologizing, his tone didn\u2019t have any intention of apologizing. In fact, there was even a hint of stifled laughter and ridicule.The Middle Eastern cultivators weren\u2019t stupid. How could they not see that he was doing it on purpose?However, even though they were angry, they couldn\u2019t say anything. Because swords had no eyes, there were bound to be casualties in the battle. The other party had just turned his intention into unintentional.No one could say anything in such a situation.It was not that one did not want to say it, but they had nothing to say!\u201cIs there anyone else? I will definitely be gentler this time. All of you geniuses from the Middle East are so fragile. I will try my best to spare your lives!\u201dMo Qi might have been deliberately released by the Chess sect to provoke the Middle East. His words were strange and made people very disgusted, especially his face when he said that he had not used any strength, but so many geniuses had been killed by him, people couldn\u2019t help but want to blow his head off.Mo Qi looked around again and found that no one accepted the challenge, so he looked at Jian Chen from the sword sect.The top three on the Heaven list!And it was the result of the second place in the first round.The reason why he didn\u2019t choose Xuan Yi was that Mo Qi didn\u2019t know the result of the first round. Otherwise, he would have passed Jian Chen and challenged Xuan Yi directly.\u201cI want to challenge you. Come out and face your death!\u201dCountless gazes turned to Jian Chen. He was a monster ranked in the top three of the Heaven list.If Jian Chen lost again\u2026When they thought of this, a layer of haze appeared in everyone\u2019s hearts.This made many of them pessimistic. Even if Jian Chen won, so what? There were still nine geniuses from the demon region in front of Mo Qi!Mo QI was just a bottom-ranking existence!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: 98\u201cPatriarch, Can Jian Chen defeat him?\u201dA few people had appeared in the vicinity of Donghuang. If anyone saw them, they would be able to recognize them. They were the patriarch of the sword sect, the sect leader of the alchemy sect, and many old monsters who rarely showed their faces.Not only them, but all the elders of the ten great powers were present.The Chess Palace of the demon region had come with ill intentions, so they had no choice but to pay attention to it.In the Nalan clan, Nalan Xue seemed to have thought of something as she laughed lightly, \u201cWith Jian Chen around, the younger generation of the Heaven list will not be defeated, nor will they lose.\u201dOn the other side, fairy sect, from the Heaven Immortal Pavilion, also did the same, \u201cJian Chen\u2019s strength is already close to the half-step sect master realm. It\u2019s impossible for him to lose!\u201dIn their eyes, Jian Chen was the number one person among the younger generation. Not to mention the younger generation, even some old monsters were not his match.Half-step sect master realm, how terrifying was his cultivation base.If he also lost, then no one in the Middle East, or even the entire ten great regions, would be able to defeat him.In the arena, Jian Chen naturally had no reason to retreat after being named.He carried a sword on his back and his white robe fluttered in the wind. He took a step forward and arrived 30 feet away from Mo Qi.This time, Mo Qi was slightly surprised, but only slightly surprised. He could do it with such speed.Jian Chen\u2019s face was expressionless, and he was not as angry as those disciples. He only said softly, \u201cI\u2019ll defeat you with one strike.\u201dHis calm words stirred up a thousand waves.\u201cAs expected of my Middle East genius, Monster!\u201d\u201cOverbearing! Too overbearing!\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to call senior brother Jian Chen the strongest!\u201dMo Qi\u2019s lips curled up slightly, \u201cI hope you\u2019re not bragging!\u201dThe two moved.Mo Qi flew rapidly towards Jian Chen.After all, his weapons were his fists. If he did not get close, he would not be able to attack.However, Jian Chen was different. His long sword was like a spirit snake, slithering around his body and forming a sword energy barrier.\u201cWhat is senior brother Jian Chen doing?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why isn\u2019t he attacking?\u201dThen, they knew why Jian Chen was doing this.He did not attack immediately. Instead, he used the sword energy barrier to block a few punches.To put it bluntly, he was allowing Mo Qi to make three moves in advance.Then, while Mo Qi was shocked, Jian Chen directly slashed out.In an instant, the Heaven and Earth changed colour. Then, an extremely powerful force swept towards Mo Qi.Mo Qi\u2019s expression changed drastically. Then, before he could react, he was directly forced back by this powerful aura.However, before he could react, this terrifying sword energy directly exploded.Countless black holes were torn open in the air.When everything was calm, the entire venue was silent.Mo Qi had lost.And it was just as Jian Chen had said.He had defeated him with one strike.After a few breaths of silence, the entire venue was in an uproar.\u201cJian Chen is awesome!\u201d\u201cA heaven\u2019s favourite, I only admire Jian Chen!\u201d\u201cJian Chen, Jian Chen!\u201dCountless people shouted Jian Chen\u2019s name.Jian Chen\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. He continued to calmly look at the people of the Chess Palace and said softly, \u201cNext.\u201dThe calmer he was, the stronger his aura was.Jian Chen\u2019s words were very accurate.This time, the expressions of the Chess Palace\u2019s people were extremely ugly.They didn\u2019t seem to have expected Jian Chen to be so powerful. However, it was only slightly ugly because they still had nine disciples who hadn\u2019t participated in the battle.A person walked out from the Chess Palace. This person\u2019s aura was not as strong as Mo Qi\u2019s, but his eyes were filled with gloom.\u201cI\u2019m Chi Mo, please enlighten me!\u201dThis person was also unarmed like Mo Qi.Then, the two did not say any more nonsense.Chi Mo flew forward. The veins on his arms bulged, and dark red blood slowly flowed. Suddenly, his arms expanded several times, and his punch brought with it an aura that could destroy the world.Jian Chen was not weak at all. He directly pulled out his sword and stabbed forward.\u201cTelepathic sword!\u201d\u201cChi Mo Fist!\u201dThe two roared, and then two terrifying auras exploded in the center of the hall.Chi Mo retreated, and was struck back by Jian Chen\u2019s sword.\u201cSword spirit body, sword intent, peak of the dimensional form! This is Jian Chen, the number one genius among the younger generation!\u201dCountless people cheered for him. At this moment, they had even forgotten that Chi Mo was only ninth on the demon list.Just ranked ninth, there were eight more terrifying people above him.\u201cEven Chen\u2019er isn\u2019t his match.\u201dIn the air, the sword master of the sword sect muttered.\u201cJian Chen is going to lose.\u201dQing Yu, Snow King and the others sighed.As the saying went, outsiders would watch the show, while experts would see the truth. In the eyes of everyone, Jian Chen had defeated Chi Mo with a single strike and gained the upper hand.However, those at the sect master realm saw it clearly.Yes, Chi Mo had been defeated by Jian Chen\u2019s sword, and he had even suffered some serious injuries. However, Jian Chen\u2019s injuries were even more serious than Chi Mo!It was just that he had suffered internal injuries, and ordinary people wouldn\u2019t be able to tell.Under Chi Mo\u2019s terrifying punch, Jian Chen\u2019s current internal condition was extremely terrible.\u201cYou were able to injure my body. Not bad, but you have lost.\u201dChi Mo stood with his hands behind his back, staring at Jian Chen from afar with the posture of a victor.This appearance caused many people in the city to be puzzled.What did Chi Mo mean by this?Why did he have the posture of a victor, and even said that Jian Chen had lost?\u201cI haven\u2019t lost!\u201dJian Chen\u2019s voice was slightly cold. He wanted to rush out, but the injuries in his body didn\u2019t allow him to.He only took one step forward, and he felt a sweet taste in his throat. He spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, \u201cChen \u2018er, come back.\u201dThe sword sect\u2019s sword master called out softly, and his voice spread throughout the entire venue.The sword master couldn\u2019t help but sigh.Chi Mo\u2019s strength had exceeded everyone\u2019s imagination, and naturally, this included him as well.Even with his sword spirit body and sword intent at the peak of the embryonic form, he was still defeated.What was even more terrifying was that Chi Mo\u2019s realm was the same as Jian Chen\u2019s. Both of them were at the peak of level four of the law enforcement realm!All along, Jian Chen was known as the number one person in the same realm. Many of the older generation\u2019s experts were also far inferior to Jian Chen in the same realm.In the minds of countless people, Jian Chen was an invincible existence in the same realm!Now that he was invincible, he had finally met an even more invincible person.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cEven Jian Chen was defeated?\u201dCountless people cried out in surprise, and countless people fell silent.At this moment, they finally understood something. Chi Mo had external injuries, but Jian Chen had internal injuries. Although Jian Chen could still stand at this moment, it was only a matter of time before he lost.If they continued to fight, it was more likely that Jian Chen\u2019s life would be threatened.Those who thought that Jian Chen could turn the tide, were disillusioned.Not only did they fail to save face, they might even lose more face.The number one person in the younger generation could not even defeat the number nine, and it did not even exceed three moves!Jian Chen lost!He lost completely.\u201cHehe, the Heaven list is really disappointing. Did they say the strongest person on the Heaven list?\u201dIn mid-air, a graceful woman laughed softly, \u201cIt\u2019s really disappointing.\u201dThe corner of the cold-looking young man\u2019s mouth curled up slightly, \u201cI thought it would be a very intense battle. I didn\u2019t expect that I wouldn\u2019t even need to appear.\u201dAt this moment.The Chess Palace, Chess King said, \u201cHeaven list, defeated! Middle East, defeated!\u201dCountless cultivators\u2019 eyes were red!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: 99Chapter 99: Take Me as a disciple? Are You Worthy?Allowing the humiliation of the demon region to happen had aroused the blood in the hearts of countless disciples.Many people were shouting that they wanted to fight.But everyone knew that no one on the heaven list could beat the cultivators of the demon region.Fairy Cai\u2019s small face was flushed red from anxiety, and she was also very resentful in her heart.Especially when Chess King shouted these words, she finally couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and rushed out, because she was the only one left in the younger generation.If she did not rush out now, if the entire Middle East was humiliated, it would be her inner demon in the future.\u201cNo, the Middle East has not been defeated! The Heaven list has not been defeated either.\u201dThis voice attracted the attention of countless people.They looked up and realized that the person who spoke was Donghuang.At this moment, Donghuang\u2019s gaze swept down to a white-clothed young man.Xuan Yi.Xuan Yi did not wait for Donghuang to speak, he was voiced out, \u201cI can make a move, but I want the reward of first place in the Heaven list competition.\u201dHe could make a move, but he could not do so for nothing.\u201cIf you can defeat these cultivators from the demon region, then you are worthy of being first. The first place on the heaven list naturally belongs to you.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dXuan Yi stood up and took a step forward to stand in front of fairy Cai, who was in midair.Of course, he knew fairy Cai\u2019s intentions.Hence, he said forcefully, \u201cLet me do this.\u201dIn fact, even without Donghuang, Xuan Yi would still make a move.Just now, because of the appearance of the demon region, the mission issued by the system had changed.Defeat all the cultivators of the demon region, raise one level of cultivation, and add two levels of sword intent.Fairy Xuan Yi\u2019s sword intent had only reached the first level, and it was already so terrifying. If he completed this mission and reached the third level of sword intent, even Xuan Yi couldn\u2019t imagine how strong he would be.Fairy Cai stared blankly at Xuan Yi\u2019s back, and then her small face blushed, followed by deep worry.\u201cBoom!\u201dFlying into the air, Xuan Yi\u2019s law enforcement realm aura was unleashed.Like a vast ocean, a long sword was unsheathed and a sword intent pierced through the sky.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to go through so much trouble. All of you go ahead.\u201dHiss!Countless gasps sounded in the center of the venue.Xuan Yi\u2019s words were extremely arrogant.\u201cAll of you, come and see if you can block my sword!\u201dBeing looked down upon like this, the faces of the people from the Chess Palace of the demon region turned extremely ugly.However, no one dared to make a sound.This was because they were f*cking shocked by the terrifying fluctuations that Xuan Yi\u2019s body emitted.The pressure of a law enforcement realm contained the pressure of sword intent.Everyone felt that there was a sharp sword hanging on their hearts. As long as it was used, it would be able to take their life.In the venue, countless cultivators were also standing with their mouths agape, shocked on the spot.They had seen Xuan Yi\u2019s battle. When they had questioned Xuan Yi for cheating, they had looked at Xuan Yi\u2019s battle very carefully. However, that was only on the screen and they had not seen it with their own eyes.Moreover, Xuan Yi had not used his full strength when he was inside.No one in the entire chess palace, or rather, all the geniuses of the demon region, dared to stand out. The reason was that the strength that Xuan Yi had displayed was no longer something they could contend against. Perhaps even sect master realm experts would have to retreat!\u201cSince when did such a freak appear in the Middle East!\u201d\u201cThis is sword intent! He has actually comprehended sword intent!\u201dEven the freak Jian Chen had only comprehended the embryonic form of sword intent, but this Xuan Yi had actually comprehended sword intent!Even Chess King was shocked by the strength Xuan Yi displayed!Now he finally understood what Donghuang had said earlier.Their Heaven list had not been defeated! The Middle East had not been defeated, and the ten regions had not been defeated either!With such a freak around, how could they possibly lose?Seeing that no one stood up, Xuan Yi swept his gaze towards the few people who had just appeared to mock them.\u201cWhy are all of you not saying anything? Didn\u2019t you say that you wanted to stretch your muscles and bones, but there\u2019s no one on the Heaven list? Get out here!\u201d\u201cAnd you, didn\u2019t you say that the Heaven list had disappointed you? Get out here too!\u201d\u201cSince all of you are not trash, then do you dare to take a step forward!\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s words were harsh, and those who were called out by Xuan Yi all had angry faces.But still, no one dared to step forward.Because they knew that if they charged forward, they would definitely lose.They might even die.Xuan Yi\u2019s words spread throughout the entire venue, and throughout the entire eastern royal city.Countless people saw this scene, and their hearts trembled, and their blood boiled.Those who could not see the Middle East clearly previously and looked down on the heaven list were now standing there like women, and no one dared to step forward at all.Aren\u2019t you guys quite arrogant?Aren\u2019t you very presumptuous?Aren\u2019t you mocking us Middle East people as trash?Why don\u2019t you dare to stand out now?Why are you all mute?If we are trash, then who do you think you are!Many people widened their eyes. The few heaven list experts who were eliminated by Xuan Yi in the small world looked at each other.\u201cWe didn\u2019t lose unjustly.\u201dIt was true that Xuan Yi alone could sweep the entire scene in the face of such a terrifying existence. However, if it were them, they might not even be able to defeat one of them.Meanwhile, Situ Bei, who had been provoking Xuan Yi previously, felt a faint fear in his heart at this moment.Now, he was thinking about how ridiculous and ignorant he was when he faced Xuan Yi\u2019s threat previously.No wonder Xuan Yi didn\u2019t respond to his threat. It turned out that he couldn\u2019t be bothered.It wasn\u2019t that Xuan Yi was really afraid, but that he was disdainful.Because the two of them were on completely different levels.The so-called threat was just a joke.Would the strong be afraid of the weak?At this time, Chess King suddenly opened his mouth and said, \u201cKid, your talent is top-notch in all the continents. Let me ask you, are you willing to join my Chess Palace and become my disciple?\u201dChess King was silent for a long time. The moment he opened his mouth, it was as though thunder had struck the ground, angering the old monsters present.Before Xuan Yi could reply, Donghuang said, \u201cChess King, you\u2019ve gone too far.\u201d\u201cTake me as your disciple?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. As long as you nod your head, I can forget about your actions just now.\u201dHowever, Xuan Yi\u2019s next words caused the expression of this sect master realm expert to change drastically.\u201cAre you worthy?\u201dFacing this sect master realm expert, Xuan Yi was still as arrogant as ever.Wasn\u2019t this courage a little too big!Everyone broke out in cold sweat on behalf of Xuan Yi.Chess King\u2019s expression was gloomy, \u201cVery good, since that\u2019s the case, then go and die!\u201dWith a palm strike, the vast spiritual energy instantly transformed into a huge virtual hand!Its might was like the wrath of God.The clouds danced wildly as the palm struck directly at Xuan Yi.\u201cChess King, you\u2019re being impudent.\u201dHow could those old freaks on the scene allow the Chess King to kill their monstrous genius Xuan Yi.Donghuang raised his hand to meet the attack. Just as he was about to make his move.Suddenly, a spatial tear appeared in front of him.A figure instantly appeared.Tearing apart the void, without a doubt, this black figure was at least a sect master realm expert.\u201cDonghuang, your opponent is me.\u201d\u201cSage expert!!!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: 100Chapter 100: Void Sword Domain!!!\u201cIt\u2019s actually a sage expert!\u201dInitially, they were very confident. After all, Donghuang was a sage expert on their side. However, it was hard to say now. After all, a sage expert had also come from the demon region. Although there was not much of a difference in strength between the two, however, it was clear that this sage expert from the demon region did not wish to fight to the death with Donghuang. He only wanted to pin down Donghuang.His goal was to get Chess King to kill Xuan Yi.The strength that Xuan Yi had displayed had already caused them to feel a sense of danger.If this child did not die, it would definitely lead to a great disaster in the future.If he was given time to grow, there would be nothing that the demon region could do against him.Such an uncertain factor was something that the demon region did not want to see.\u201cOld monster Donghuang, your opponent is me!\u201d\u201cDevil King!\u201dDonghuang\u2019s expression changed slightly. With a single glance, he knew who this person was.After the Devil King appeared, he charged at Donghuang in a circle.With a bang, Donghuang took a few steps back. At the same time, a spatial crack appeared behind Donghuang, and his entire body fell into it.The Devil King tried his best to create as many cracks as possible in an instant.This was the domain of the Devil King, the space element.Seeing this, Chess King\u2019s huge palm was about to land.Several old monsters from the ten regions also moved.But a familiar scene appeared again. Countless space cracks were torn open, and many experts from the demon region walked out.And without exception, they were all at the sect master realm!\u201cHeaven splitting king.\u201d\u201cBlack Demon!\u201d\u201cBewitching King!\u201d\u201cHell Ambassador!\u201dThe people from the ten regions were familiar with these people.These were all famous devils from the demon region, and they were all from the Chess Palace.After these people appeared, like which Devil King, they entangled the experts from the ten domains.They forcefully pulled them into the spatial rift.Fortunately, before Qing Xuzi was pulled into the spatial rift, he used all his strength to block this terrifying attack for Xuan Yi.At this moment, in the venue of the Norda Conference, all the money had been pulled into the spatial rift.Other than the disciples of the ten regions, there was only Chess King, a sect master realm expert.Countless people\u2019s heads were covered with a layer of frost.If this Chess King went on a killing spree, then not many of them would be able to escape.This was a sect master realm expert. Killing these favourites of heaven was as easy as chopping melons and vegetables.Although there were many half-step sect master experts here, once they reached the sect master level, the gap between each level was like a heavenly canal that could not be crossed.Chess King, a sect master level expert, could sweep through the entire scene.Dead silence!Silence!Everyone looked at Chess King who was at the sect master level in the sky and their hearts were filled with a haze.\u201cThe few of you, the Yue family, the sword sect and the supreme sword sect, these reclusive sect master level experts are already on their way here. As long as we can hold them off for a while, we will be able to escape this calamity!\u201dThe one who spoke was the deputy governor of the eastern royal city. He tried to persuade these half-step sect masters to fight together with them.But before he could finish his words, many shook their heads repeatedly.A few half-step sect masters were able to hold off a sect master?He probably didn\u2019t want to believe these words!How was this possible!Even if they could hold them off, they would probably only be able to hold him off for a breath, or maybe two breaths?What was the use of that?Chess King smiled and said, \u201cThose few hermit experts, they couldn\u2019t even save their own lives, yet they still come to save you all?\u201dWhat he said was true. Since the demon region had sent so many experts, then they must have wanted to take down the ten regions. It was impossible for them to ignore the sect master realm experts.It was estimated that all the sect master realm experts and above in the ten regions had been ambushed by the people of the demon region.\u201cNow, let\u2019s see who can protect you!\u201dThis was a charming woman behind Chess King who walked out. \u201cHehehe, little brother was really fierce just now. You scared big sister. Didn\u2019t you tell big sister to get out? Fairy big sister has already come out. What can you do to me?\u201dThe enchanting woman who originally did not dare to come out under Xuan Yi\u2019s might, now jumped out as the situation changed greatly.\u201cSwoosh!!!\u201dA sword light flashed and the vast sword intent directly locked onto this woman.\u201cIn front of me, you still dare to touch my Chess Palace\u2019s disciple. Who gave you the courage?!\u201dChess King naturally would not let Xuan Yi succeed. He struck out with his palm and directly blasted Xuan Yi\u2019s sword light into nothingness.\u201cAiya, it\u2019s so scary! It scared my heart\u2026\u201dSeeing that Xuan Yi wanted to kill her but couldn\u2019t, the enchanting woman became even more proud.\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, I can only kill you first.\u201dXuan Yi gave up on killing the enchanting woman and looked at Chess King instead!Holding the sword in one hand, standing in the air, four words slowly came out of Xuan Yi\u2019s mouth.\u201cVoid Sword Domain!\u201dBuzz!!!As Xuan Yi\u2019s voice fell, a black force field spread out in all directions with Xuan Yi as the center.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dCountless people were shocked!Looking at the black domain that suddenly appeared and enveloped everyone, endless doubts rose in their hearts.These people were only golden elixir phase cultivators. There were even many foundation establishment phase cultivators. Not to mention them, even divine ability realm cultivators might not understand the domain.This was too far away for them.And no one could recognize it except for one person.That was Chess King.As a sect master stage cultivator, it was impossible for him not to know about domains.It was precisely because he knew this that he felt incredulous, so much so that his voice began to tremble.\u201cThis\u2026 This is a domain?\u201dA domain could only be comprehended when one reached the sect master realm. However, it did not mean that any sect master realm cultivator had the talent to comprehend a domain.His voice was filled with astonishment.It could not be wrong!This was a domain!What did he see? A law enforcement realm cultivator actually comprehended a domain that many sect master realm experts had not comprehended!How was this possible? He kept shouting in his heart.He, Chess King, could understand that a law enforcement realm cultivator had comprehended sword intent in his twenties. However, he could not understand that a law enforcement realm cultivator had comprehended a domain!\u201cWind and Thunder Sword!\u201dA sharp sword ray instantly rushed in front of Chess King.Under the enhancement of the domain, not only did its power increase greatly, but its speed also increased exponentially! Before using the domain, even if Xuan Yi had comprehended the second level of sword intent, he would not be able to cause any harm to Chess King. However, under the enhancement of the domain, just the first level of sword intent had caused Chess King\u2019s expression to change drastically.Chess king naturally realized this, so he didn\u2019t plan to receive Xuan Yi\u2019s sword attack at all. The speed of a sect master realm instantly exploded, and in an instant, he retreated several feets away from the point where the sword ray landed.Countless people witnessed this scene and were so shocked that they were speechless.A sect master expert actually retreated when facing a law enforcement realm cultivator!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
