You\u2026 Why are you here!?!\u201dStartled, the stranger started sizing Jordan up.Jordan was of a medium build and was very good-looking. He was donning a yellow takeout deliveryman\u2019s uniform.The stranger smiled and said, \u201cHailey, so your husband is a delivery man, huh? Hah, if I had known earlier, I would have called for room service instead of takeout.\u201dDespite running into Hailey\u2019s husband, it did not fluster the man at all!It was because he knew Jordan was a live-in son-in-law!He had an inferior status among the Camdens!Jordan looked at Hailey furiously.\u201cHailey, I\u2019ve been married to you for three years! I\u2019ve prepared all of your meals and took care of your dog and cat with no complaints. I did not let you down!\u201d\u201cFor the past three years, you didn\u2019t even let me touch your hand! I always thought you were a woman of principle, but today, you\u2026 Why did you do this!?!\u201dThe fair-skinned and beautiful Hailey became horrified, but soon she turned arrogant.She walked towards the door and said, \u201cBut what? Jordan, don\u2019t spout nonsense. The consequences are heavy.\u201d\u201cDo you know who he is? He is the boss of an investment firm and the scion of a top family in Orlando, Tyler Collins!\u201d\u201cTyler is here to discuss a business deal with me. If you don\u2019t believe it, I can show you the contract, but will you understand what the contract is about?\u201dJordan was a deliveryman, and in Hailey\u2019s opinion, he was incompetent and wouldn\u2019t understand business matters.Tyler smiled without giving an explanation.Glancing at the split takeout on the floor, he said, \u201cAt first, I was going to lodge a complaint against you for dropping my chicken soup. However, on account that you\u2019re Hailey\u2019s husband, I shall give you a five-star rating. Only if you apologize to me with sincerity. How does that sound?\u201dTyler wore a sinister smile while acting as if he was the victim.Not only did he not explain or apologize to Jordan, he even wanted the latter to apologize to him.Jordan thought that Hailey would stop Tyler\u2019s shameless behavior, but to his surprise, Hailey said, \u201cApologize to Tyler. He\u2019s not someone whom you can offend.\u201dJordan got enraged.\u2018You two are being such bullies! Not only are you not apologizing to me, you even want me to apologize to you instead, huh?\u2019\u2018That doesn\u2019t make sense!\u2019Jordan clenched his fist, feeling an urge to teach that beast a lesson!However, just as Jordan took a step forward, Tyler took three steps backward in shock.Hailey stood in front of him to shield him while yelling at Jordan.\u201cJordan! Look how shabby you look. You\u2019re not fit to step into a guest room of a five-star hotel. Get out! Otherwise, I\u2019ll call security!\u201dJordan looked at Hailey and lowered his fist a little.\u201cHailey, I hope there won\u2019t be a day you regret this!\u201dWith that, Jordan turned around and left.Staring at Jordan\u2019s back, Hailey hollered, \u201cMarrying a loser like you is my greatest regret!\u201dHailey\u2019s pleasant and melodious voice resounded in the hotel\u2019s corridor, but it was getting softer and softer. However, her voice was becoming heavier in Jordan\u2019s heart.Jordan mounted the motorcycle the delivery service provided him as soon as he exited the hotel. All of a sudden, his phone started ringing.\u201cHello, hello, this is Ubereats.\u201dJordan answered with professionalism.An old voice on the other end of the line answered,\u201cSir, your three-year character development experience as a live-in son-in-law of the Camdens officially ends today.\u201d\u201cYour next task is to build experience in business management. Mr. Steele Senior has already bought the Ace Corporation and arranged for you to be the chairman of Ace Corporation.\u201d\u201cOkay, I know.\u201d Jordan answered with indifference.Any other deliveryman would become ecstatic if he suddenly became the chairman of a company overnight.However, Jordan remained composed.The caller said, \u201cMr. Steele Senior wants to know how you are getting along with your wife. Do you want to officially let her join the Steeles and become one of the inheritors?\u201dJordan sneered and exclaimed, \u201cLet Hailey Camden inherit my family\u2019s assets that are worth billions? Hah, no need for that. She\u2019s not worthy!\u201dJordan hung up then gripped the steering wheel while flooring the accelerator to speed through the heavy traffic on the streets.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The world only knew of mysterious families like the Rothschild, DuPont and Morgan families.However, no one knew that the most mysterious family of them all was actually the Steeles.The Steeles\u2019 assets amounted to more than 100 billion dollars, but they kept an extremely low profile and their family was not even listed on the list of tycoons.They also educated their descendants differently from others.Jordan\u2019s grandfather paid great attention to the nurturing and education of children of his family.For example, Jordan had been learning martial arts at the same time as instruments like the piano and violin since the age of five.At eighteen, he had already completed a four-year business school course at an Ivy League university.In order to train Jordan\u2019s character, Jordan\u2019s grandfather arranged for him to become the live-in son-in-law of the Camdens, a second-tier family in Orlando!The Camdens had humiliated Jordan for the past three years, but he endured and bore with it to finish the three-year test!He thought he would go home tonight and tell his wife the truth about him being a billionaire but unfortunately\u2026\u201cHah, Hailey Camden, I wonder how you\u2019d react when you find out my true identity one day!\u201dJordan was looking forward to it!On the ninth floor of an apartment building in the residential area of Orlando\u2026At eight o\u2019clock in the evening, Jordan returned home after wrapping up for the day.\u201cYou\u2019re home? You don\u2019t have to cook tonight. I ordered takeout. Come over and eat.\u201dHailey had come home in advance, and she had even prepared dinner for Jordan, which was rare.In the past, Jordan prepared every meal.Jordan changed into slippers and said, \u201cNah, I\u2019m back to pack my things.\u201dAs he spoke, he walked towards his bedroom.Jordan and Hailey lived in separate rooms. Although the two of them were married in name, they had never shared the same room in the past three years.Hailey was obviously enraged as she walked in with her hands on her slender waist.\u201cWhat? You want to run away from home? Must you do this over a trivial matter?\u201dStuffing his clothes into his suitcase, Jordan retorted, \u201cA trivial matter? Do you think adultery is a trivial matter?\u201dHailey did not explain this time, knowing that Jordan wouldn\u2019t believe her, regardless of her explanation.Hence, she barked, \u201cSo what!?! Do you expect me to apologize to you? You\u2019ve been sponging off me and even if I really did something wrong to let you down, you have to put up with it!\u201dJordan closed the suitcase with force and said,\u201cI\u2019ve put up with your family for three years! I\u2019ve been serving you like you\u2019re a princess, but for the past three years, you\u2019ve never looked me in the eye!\u201d\u201cYour mother, Sylvie Parker, humiliated me and beat me in public countless times, but I\u2019ve never talked back to her!\u201d\u201cYour father, Benedict Camden, takes me for free labor and makes me do all the arduous and filthy tasks which caused me to be injured several times. All the hard-earned money that I spent on my medical expenses, I earned by delivering takeout!\u201d\u201cYour uncle and his cousin bullied me, but all of you turned a blind eye to their behavior!\u201d\u201cFrom today onwards, I don\u2019t want to put up with it anymore! Hailey, let\u2019s get a divorce!\u201dHailey was shocked when she heard Jordan mention divorce, but she soon laughed aloud.\u201cHaha, how dare you mention divorce to me? Don\u2019t blame me for not reminding you, but after the divorce, you won\u2019t be able to live in a large apartment that has a floor area of several hundred square meters or drive an Audi!\u201dJordan sneered with disdain. \u201cHah, large apartment? Audi? I don\u2019t need it!\u201dHailey answered, \u201cSure, I\u2019ve wanted to divorce you for a long time, and I don\u2019t know what kind of folly my grandfather was in to have made me marry a good-for-nothing like you!\u201d\u201cThe Camdens are at least set to become a first-tier family and our assets amount to more than a hundred million. A penniless man like you is not fit to be my husband at all!\u201dJordan packed up his things and cut her off, no longer wanting to hear her continue to insult him.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the lawyer\u2019s office tomorrow morning to get a divorce.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t make it tomorrow,\u201d Hailey refuted instantly. \u201cIt\u2019s my grandmother\u2019s 80th birthday tomorrow and we all have to gather at her home before 10 am. Besides, I have to discuss this with my family too.\u201dHailey\u2019s elders arranged their marriage.Three years ago, Hailey had no right to refuse the marriage arranged by her family.Today, she likewise had no right to dissolve the marriage arranged by her family.This was the life of most members of wealthy families. There were many things that were beyond their control.Jordan knew Hailey couldn\u2019t decide for herself.\u201cDiscuss with your family as soon as possible. I\u2019ll wait for your call.\u201dAfter that, Jordan left, lugging his suitcase along.\u201cScoundrel! Good-for-nothing! You\u2019ll definitely regret divorcing me! In a few days, you\u2019ll be back on your knees and begging me to reconcile with you!\u201dHailey cursed Jordan incessantly, even until he had reached the elevator, but he simply ignored her.The reason being he knew how ridiculous Hailey\u2019s words were!Why would a tycoon with a net worth of more than a hundred billion kneel to someone from a family who were merely multi-millionaires?\u2018Hailey, you\u2019re thinking too much!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The birthday banquet would be held at the best hotel in Orlando.Prior to the celebration, Old Mrs. Camden had asked everyone to gather at the villa where she lived.\u201cHappy birthday, Grandma!\u201d\u201cMom, I wish you longevity and live to the age of 200!\u201dThere was a large group of people in the villa, and they were all the children and grandchildren of Old Mrs. Camden.Old Mrs. Camden had two sons, the elder being Herman Camden and the younger being Benedict Camden, who was also Hailey\u2019s father.Herman had a son named Drew and a daughter named Elle, both of whom were about the same age as Hailey.Old Mrs. Camden held the power to make decisions for the family business and had the final say on the assets, which were worth more than one hundred million dollars.Thus, Herman and Benedict were trying their best to please Old Mrs. Camden and get into her good books, so that they would receive a greater share of the inheritance.Old Mrs. Camden sat in the middle of the living room on a mahogany chair worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, holding a poodle and looking at the gifts she had received from her children and grandchildren. She nodded happily as she listened to their birthday wishes.Suddenly, she saw a pile of poop excreted by the poodle under the chair.\u201cWhere is that good-for-nothing son-in-law?\u201d Old Mrs. Camden asked. \u201cGet him here to clean this up.\u201dThe good-for-nothing son-in-law who Old Mrs. Camden referred to was Jordan.Jordan had been picking up the poodle\u2019s feces for the past three years.Herman looked at the room and remarked in puzzlement, \u201cHuh? That good-for-nothing Jordan seems to be absent.\u201dOld Mrs. Camden got furious. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s my 80th birthday today. How dare he not show up? Hailey, what\u2019s going on?\u201dHailey answered respectfully, \u201cHe might have gone to work\u2026\u201d\u201cWork? To deliver takeout? Hahaha, that\u2019s hilarious.\u201d Elle gibed.Drew began mocking too, \u201cHe\u2019s such a disgrace to the Camdens! I ran into him once when I was driving around in my Maserati, but I didn\u2019t even dare to tell my friends that he\u2019s a member of our family!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden\u2019s eyes burned as she yelled, \u201cGet him to come back here now! He doesn\u2019t know how to follow the basic rules at all!\u201dWhen she saw how angry her grandmother had become, she had no choice but to tell the truth.\u201cGrandma, he didn\u2019t come today because we\u2019re getting a divorce.\u201d\u201cDivorce? Who gave you permission to get a divorce? Don\u2019t you know that your marriage was decided by your late grandfather?\u201d Old Mrs. Camden rebuked.Hailey dared not be disrespectful and knelt down on the spot while weeping.\u201cGrandma, I don\u2019t dare to go against Grandpa\u2019s wishes, but Jordan \u2026 he\u2019s too much of a bully!\u201dFeeling a heartache when she saw Hailey bawling her eyes out, Old Mrs. Camden walked over to help her up.\u201cHailey, stop crying, you\u2019re my granddaughter, and he\u2019s just a live-in son-in-law. Tell me how he bullied you. I\u2019ll teach him a lesson on your behalf!\u201dHailey wiped the tears that she had forced herself to shed and then said to everyone, \u201cJordan has an affair with another woman!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dOld Mrs. Camden\u2019s body trembled as she heard Hailey\u2019s accusation. Fortunately, Herman reacted right away and came over to hold her.Old Mrs. Camden blew her top. \u201cHe\u2019s a beast! For the past three years, we let him stay in a luxury apartment and gave him a luxury car to drive, and he didn\u2019t even devote himself to you and stay loyal to you. How dare he get involved in an affair!?\u201dHailey chose to play the blame game and falsely accused Jordan of cheating on her. Thus, she was easily able to gain Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s trust.The reason being Hailey knew how to hide her true colors well and had always acted like a good girl in front of her family.If not for the fact that he had run into her at the hotel and witnessed everything with his own eyes, Jordan would have continued to think that Hailey was a pure and kind girl, even though she was slightly arrogant.Hailey\u2019s parents, who had also been deceived by their daughter, scolded Jordan angrily.In contrast, Herman and his children had the opposite reaction.Elle gloated, \u201cHailey, aren\u2019t you known as the number one beauty in Orlando? You\u2019ve got a great figure and a pretty face. Why would you be inferior to other women?\u201dElle had an impressive figure. She received more than 100 million likes and more than 10 million fans when her back was revealed in a video on a short clip-sharing platform.Among all the hosts who chose not to reveal their faces, she was the one with the most fans.However, her looks were average and too ordinary compared to Hailey. Thus, she always viewed Hailey with jealousy.Drew smiled and chimed in, \u201cHailey, don\u2019t blame me for criticizing you, but you have a part to blame. You refused to let him get intimate with you in the three years of your marriage. Even if you\u2019re pretty, it\u2019s pointless if he can\u2019t have you. No wonder Jordan has an affair, hahaha.\u201dAt this point, Hailey\u2019s mother, Sylvie, stood up for her.\u201cDrew, that\u2019s wrong of you. Hailey\u2019s status is superior to Jordan\u2019s. If she had consummated her marriage with that good-for-nothing, wouldn\u2019t it be an insult to her? It would mar her body too.\u201dDrew humphed in disdain. \u201cYou guys are just thinking of keeping her chaste so that she can marry a rich man after finding an opportunity to get rid of Jordan, aren\u2019t you?\u201dSylvie said, \u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough, stop arguing!\u201d Old Mrs. Camden hollered. \u201cEven if Hailey is like that, he has no reason to have an affair! What does he take our family for? Get that beast to come here now. I have to punish him with the family rules!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She put down the phone and said to her grandmother, \u201cHe\u2019s not coming.\u201dSeeing how awkward the situation was, Sylvie frantically said,\u201cMom, it\u2019s your 80th birthday celebration today. Let\u2019s get busy with the celebration and ignore that good-for-nothing.\u201dHowever, Old Mrs. Camden was stubborn.\u201cAs long as it is something that the Camdens provided for, he has to be here, regardless if he\u2019s human or a dog!\u201dAfter saying that, she looked at Drew. \u201cDrew, bring him over!\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dDrew cracked his fingers. He often bullied Jordan and thought that this would be an excellent chance to move his limbs.After Drew left, Old Mrs. Camden returned to the mahogany chair and stroked her poodle. Only then did her feelings get placated.After that, Old Mrs. Camden said, \u201cI called you all to come over early today because I have something to tell you.\u201dHerman, Benedict and the others all sat upright and listened to what Old Mrs. Camden had to say.Old Mrs. Camden said, \u201cYesterday, someone who appeared out of nowhere was appointed as the new chairman of the Ace Corporation. No one knows what his name is or where he comes from.\u201d\u201cAs you are aware, Landmark Realty and the Ace Corporation have been in a cooperative relationship and are currently negotiating a 70 million dollar financing deal. The contract hasn\u2019t been signed yet, so the most important thing to do now is to form a good relationship with the newly appointed chairman of the Ace Corporation!\u201dLandmark Realty belonged to the Camdens, who developed the New City residential estate that Hailey lived in.Landmark Realty, however, recently faced some issues with their funds, and they urgently needed the Ace Corporation to invest 70 million dollars in their company.After Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s words, it was clear that whoever could negotiate the 70 million dollar investment issue with the newly appointed chairman of Ace Corporation would be rewarded.The reward might be a promotion in the family business or something related to the final authority over the business or inheritance!Benedict was the first to speak up. \u201cMom, leave this matter to me. I will do everything I can to pave good relations with the new chairman of Ace Corporation!\u201dHerman gibed, \u201cWhat right do you have to be in charge? I\u2019ve always been in charge of the financing, Drew and I will take care of this!\u201dSeeing that both of them were willing to contribute, Old Mrs. Camden smiled.\u201cIt\u2019s my 80th birthday today. The guests arriving to celebrate my birthday are all distinguished figures of high status and authority in Orlando. Ask them about the new president while entertaining the guests. I\u2019ll leave the matter up to the first person who finds out.\u201d\u201cYes, Mom!\u201d Herman and Benedict chorused.\u2026Drew left the villa and drove his Maserati over onto the freshly paved tarmac road.Drew smoked a cigarette and dialed Jordan\u2019s phone number.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Jordan asked.When Drew heard Jordan\u2019s voice, he laughed and said,\u201cHaha, Jordan, Hailey just told us all about what\u2019s going on between you two. I didn\u2019t expect you to have the guts to do that!\u201dJordan was a bit surprised to hear that. \u201cDid Hailey\u2026 tell you guys everything?\u201dDrew answered, \u201cYes, she has. She was weeping in a distraught manner. Actually, I think the fault lies with her. What is she acting all chaste and lofty for? She\u2019s just a pretty face, isn\u2019t she? She\u2019s not even as good as Elle. What\u2019s wrong with sleeping with you for a night?\u201dJordan thought Hailey had cried because she felt guilty and thus sighed. \u201cLet bygones be bygones.\u201dDrew suddenly asked, \u201cWhere are you? Let\u2019s talk.\u201dJordan answered, \u201cI\u2019m delivering takeout in Green Park residential estate.\u201dDrew said, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll be right there, wait for me.\u201dDrew stepped hard on the accelerator and arrived at the estate entrance within minutes, just in time to see Jordan exiting on his motorbike.Drew did not get out of the car and instead rolled down the window on the passenger side.\u201cHop in. Grandma wants to see you.\u201dJordan thought that the Old Mrs. Camden wanted to see him because she wanted to plead for her granddaughter.With steel in his voice, Jordan said, \u201cEven if your grandmother pleads for Hailey, it\u2019d be pointless. I will definitely divorce her!\u201dWith a look of puzzlement, Drew exclaimed, \u201cRascal, what are you thinking? You think my grandmother wants to plead with you? She wants to punish you according to the family rules!\u201dIt was hard for Jordan to open his eyes due to the glare of the sunlight.However, he was shocked. \u201cPunish me according to the family rules? On what grounds?\u201dDrew hollered, \u201cOn what grounds? You have an extramarital affair, and you have the cheek to ask that question?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m pleased to see the miserable state Hailey is in now, but no matter what, she\u2019s a Camden and since you\u2019ve let us down, you deserve to die!\u201dJordan froze.\u201cI have an extramarital affair? Is that what Hailey said?\u201dJordan never thought that Hailey would turn the tables and falsely accuse him of cheating when she was the one who made him a cuckold!\u2018This shameless woman!\u2019\u2018Even if you want to bully others, you must know your limits!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We will entertain the guests in the hotel first. We\u2019ll punish you after the birthday banquet is over. You can then explain to Grandma about your divorce.\u201dWith a murderous gaze in his eyes, Jordan hollered, \u201cI said, I will not go!\u201dDrew was furious, too. \u201cYou wastrel, you must be itching for a beating again huh?\u201dAs he said that, Drew opened the car door, stepped out of the car, and dashed towards Jordan, who was mounted on his motorbike. He then kicked Jordan!To his surprise, Jordan caught him off guard by moving the motorbike backward, successfully dodging Drew\u2019s kick.After that, Jordan got off the motorbike, dashed towards Drew, and kicked him hard in the gut!Boom!Drew was a playboy with multiple girlfriends and a weak body due to his overactive sex life. Thus, Jordan\u2019s kick quickly sent him flying.\u201cYou\u2026 you good-for-nothing, how dare you fight back!?!\u201dDrew was shocked. In the past three years, Drew had bullied Jordan on several occasions.Even when Jordan was bullied in front of Hailey\u2019s family, Jordan never dared to retaliate.Yet today, Jordan, the live-in son-in-law, actually beat up the future successor of the Camdens!Drew got up on his feet and took out a fruit knife from the trunk of the Maserati.He barked in exasperation, \u201cI\u2019m going to punish you on behalf of Grandma. I\u2019ll stab you to death!\u201dWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Drew rushed towards Jordan and slashed him thrice, but the latter dodged the attacks effortlessly.Jordan started training in martial arts when he was five years old and never stopped doing so in over ten years. He was taught by the best martial artists in both the local and international communities.Drew and his fruit knife can\u2019t hurt Jordan at all!Jordan\u2019s hand was as fast as lightning, and with a loud smack, he hit Drew\u2019s wrist, causing him to drop the fruit knife onto the ground.At the same time, Jordan punched Drew in the face, using several Wing-Chun moves before Drew could pick up the knife again.Smack-smack.Drew fell to the ground, not daring to strike at Jordan again.Jordan looked at Drew from above and warned, \u201cTell Old Mrs. Camden that I\u2019m no longer your family\u2019s dog who will come and go as you please. Unless I\u2019m willing, no one can try to threaten me!\u201dAfter saying that, Jordan rode his motorbike away to deliver the next takeout order.Drew was already bruised and swollen, but he did not go to the hospital since he felt it was an excellent opportunity to win his grandmother\u2019s sympathy.Battered with bruises, he drove back to the mountain villa. Old Mrs. Camden and the others came out of the villa at the same time, all ready to go to the hotel to receive the guests.\u201cDrew, you\u2019re back.\u201dDrew\u2019s mother, Adeline Walter, saw the familiar yellow Maserati driving forth and pointed at it in front of Old Mrs. Camden.Old Mrs. Camden smiled and nodded. \u201cDrew is still the most efficient after all.\u201dEveryone thought Drew had brought Jordan back but Drew alighted from the car alone with his face covered in wounds to their surprise!Old Mrs. Camden was incredibly heartbroken. Drew was the only male descendant of the third generation, so it would be the end of the Camdens\u2019 line of succession if anything happened to him!\u201cMy dear grandson, how did you get beaten up like this? Who beat you up?\u201d Old Mrs. Camden asked anxiously.Drew cried and complained, \u201cGrandma, it was Hailey\u2019s loser husband who hit me!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Herman was furious and pointed at Benedict and his family. \u201cYou good-for-nothings, how dare you hit Drew!?! You must give me an explanation for this matter!\u201dBenedict and Sylvie also panicked. Since Jordan was their son-in-law, they would definitely have to take the blame.\u201cAll this good-for-nothing does is create trouble for us. When I see him, I have to slap his mouth!\u201d Sylvie remarked viciously.\u201cShould we call the police? Grandma?\u201d Drew asked Old Mrs. Camden.Old Mrs. Camden disliked dealing with the police.\u201cThis is a family matter, don\u2019t worry, I will make sure he gets the punishment he deserves!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden then looked at Herman.\u201cHerman, I know you know some friends in the triads. Ask them to teach that beast a hard lesson and bring him back to me!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLooking at the wounds on his son\u2019s face, Herman wished he could skin Jordan alive. Hence. he immediately called a friend who was a triad member.Half an hour later, at the stairway of a residential estate.It was a multi-story building with no elevator. Jordan had just delivered takeout and was ready to go downstairs.A pair of brawny tattooed men who were over 1.85 meters tall and weighed around 100 kilograms each appeared suddenly.\u201cYou\u2019re Jordan, right? Come with us.\u201dOne of the tattooed men asked.Jordan looked at the two men and knew that the Camdens had sent them.Jordan said, \u201cToday is my last day of working as a takeout delivery man. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201dJordan was the type to complete what he started. Having been appointed as the new chairman of Ace Corporation, today was actually his last day as a delivery man.All jobs are to be respected. Hence, he wanted to end his delivery career after completing it to satisfaction.\u201cSeems like you want to do this the hard way!\u201dThe two brawny men immediately attacked without any nonsense!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He then kicked one of them in his face.\u201cDamn! This bastard\u2019s kick hurts so much!\u201dThe person who had been kicked immediately started bleeding from his nose.Jordan smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m a fourth-degree black belt.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a ninth-degree black belt!\u201dJordan\u2019s attacker became angry and tried to kick him as well.Jordan leaped down from the railing, and he punched again before shaking his head and mocking the other party.Jordan was indeed a fourth-degree black belt. The average age of fourth-degree black-belt-holders was at least 55 years old and above. Clearly, he didn\u2019t know about that.Jordan had been practicing martial arts for many years, and Taekwondo was not the only sport he learned.Bang!Jordan beat his opponents up to the point of vomiting acid with Bruce-Lee-style punches.Boom!With an over-the-shoulder throw, Jordan slammed him hard on the ground!The two professional fighters were trounced by Jordan!\u2026At Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s birthday banquet in Orlando\u2019s Marriott Hotel\u2026Herman said to Old Mrs. Camden with a look of embarrassment, \u201cMom, the professional fighters I hired got crippled by Jordan!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dEveryone was shocked. \u2018Is this wastrel a professional fighter too?\u2019\u201cIsn\u2019t there anyone who can deal with this beast!?!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden slapped the table furiously.At this moment, Ryan Dunn, the general agent of Ubereats, came over with a birthday gift for Old Mrs. Camden.Upon sight of Ryan, Herman suddenly smiled.Ryan was a nobody in Orlando. A few years ago, when takeout delivery services were not well-received, he spent only 30,000 dollars to become the general agent of Ubereats for Orlando.It would probably be hard to do that now even if the price was increased by ten times.Ever since he earned a reasonable sum of money from Ubereats, Ryan had been trying to blend in with the upper-class society of Orlando.As it was Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s 80th birthday today, Ryan decided to take the opportunity to become acquainted with the Camdens.\u201cMr. Dunn, welcome, welcome, have you been well lately?\u201dHerman walked up to greet him with a smile.Ryan held onto a bottle of red wine with one hand and shook Herman\u2019s hand with the other. \u201cThank you for your concern, Mr. Camden. I\u2019m doing very well.\u201dHe then walked towards Old Mrs. Camden and handed the bottle of red wine over to her.\u201cOld Mrs. Camden, I heard you enjoy drinking. This is a bottle of 1990 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti wine. I wish you a happy birthday and longevity!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden got up and thanked him, \u201cThank you, Mr. Dunn, that\u2019s very thoughtful of you.\u201dAfter that, Ryan asked, \u201cHow have you been, Old Mrs. Camden?\u201dOld Mrs. Camden sighed.Seeing this, Ryan immediately asked Herman, \u201cMr. Camden, Old Mrs. Camden doesn\u2019t seem to be in a good mood.\u201dHerman sighed and said, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of being mocked by you, but we\u2019re really unlucky! Do you still remember that live-in son-in-law of mine, Jordan Steele?\u201dRyan nodded. Three years ago, Hailey, known for her stunning beauty in Orlando, married a mediocre man. Her marriage caused quite a stir in Orlando.Back then, Ryan also wished he was in Jordan\u2019s place!Just like Jordan, he was a nobody who came from a humble background. He wanted to marry a wealthy girl too!Herman said, \u201cNot only did that bastard cheat, he even hit my son. You saw how my son got beaten up!\u201dOnly then did Ryan notice the injury on Drew\u2019s face.However, at this moment, Ryan was also put in a tough spot.He was just a nobody. How could he be fit to meddle in the family affairs of others?Ryan said, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that I don\u2019t have any connections in Orlando. If you can\u2019t solve the matter, Mr. Camden, I doubt I can help you either. Otherwise, I\u2019d definitely teach this ungrateful good-for-nothing a lesson!\u201dHerman patted Ryan\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cMr. Dunn, you\u2019re too modest. You\u2019re indeed able to help me with this.\u201d\u201cThat punk is your employee. He delivers takeout under Ubereats!\u201d Drew couldn\u2019t help but speak up.Hearing his words, Ryan was immediately overjoyed. \u201cJordan is an employee of Ubereats? Mr. Camden, leave it to me to handle this!\u201dRyan was the general agent of Ubereats in Orlando and had the absolute authority to fire Jordan. In fact, he was also thoroughly informed of Jordan\u2019s whereabouts.Ryan immediately made a phone call to someone. \u201cHello, Claire. Check up on Jordan Steele\u2019s employee number and his current location.\u201d\u201cOkay, assign an order to Jordan now, make him deliver it to Marriott Hotel.\u201dAfter making the call, Ryan said to Old Mrs. Camden respectfully,\u201cOld Mrs. Camden, that sponger will be here right away. I\u2019ll stand up for you later!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden, Herman, and Drew all started grinning.Fifteen minutes later, Jordan arrived at the entrance of the Marriott Hotel on his motorbike.Jordan dialed the customer\u2019s phone number and said, \u201cMr. Dunn, your takeout has arrived. I\u2019m at the entrance of the Marriott Hotel. Please come out to collect it.\u201dRyan was chatting with Old Mrs. Camden and the others in the hotel\u2019s lobby.Ryan ordered, \u201cSend it in!\u201dJordan looked up at the luxurious banner at the hotel entrance, which read, \u201cHappy 80th Birthday, Old Mrs. Camden.\u201dBesides, Marriott Hotel was the best hotel in Orlando for birthday banquets. Hence, he reckoned Hailey\u2019s family was there.Jordan said, \u201cTakeout deliveries are not allowed to enter the hotel. Please come out to collect it.\u201dRyan covered the microphone of the cell phone and asked for instructions from Old Mrs. Camden, \u201cAlright, wait for me at the door!\u201dTwo minutes later, Ryan and the Camdens walked out!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you know who he is? He is your boss! He\u2019s Ryan Dunn, the general agent of Ubereats in Orlando!\u201dRyan humphed coldly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, I\u2019ll get the manager, Claire, to call you.\u201dSoon, Claire called Jordan.\u201cJordan, what did you do to provoke Mr. Dunn? He has already fired you!\u201dJordan sneered, as he didn\u2019t expect his career as a takeout deliverer to end like that.To be honest, he enjoyed delivering takeout as it allowed him to meet people from all walks of life and train one\u2019s temper and character.He wanted to end his career as a takeout deliverer perfectly, but that bastard Ryan ruined his plan!Ryan started hollering at Jordan, \u201cHurry up and remove your clothes! I have already fired you!\u201dHis clothes, hat, and motorbike all belonged to Ubereats. Since Jordan had been fired, he was no longer qualified to use them.\u201cSure.\u201dWith a grim expression, he removed the yellow takeout deliverer\u2019s uniform in front of everyone.\u201cHahahaha, he\u2019s just like a dog!\u201d Drew laughed and leaned backward.Herman hollered, \u201cGood-for-nothing! Weren\u2019t you very arrogant just now? You even had the guts to hit my son! Try doing that now!\u201dJordan was Ryan\u2019s employee now and had no choice but to obey him.He took off his uniform and tossed it onto the motorbike.\u201cMr. Dunn, I heard that your proxy for Ubereats ends this year, right?\u201dRyan was stunned for a moment as he asked, \u201cWhat does that have to do with you?\u201dJordan chuckled and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go to the capital to discuss the contract renewal anymore. You will no longer be the general agent.\u201dJordan remembered who the owner of Ubereats was. Jordan\u2019s grandfather had rejected his attempt to get acquainted with the Steeles a few years ago.With a single call from Jordan, Ryan would vanish in Orlando!Ryan still hoped to earn more money as the general agent, so he got furious.\u201cWho do you think you are!?! Am I going to stop being the proxy agent just because you said so? Do you know how close I am to the boss of Ubereats?\u201d\u201cBack then, no one was optimistic about takeout delivery, but I forked over the cash to save him! This time, I\u2019m going to spend a million dollars!\u201dJordan sneered and said, \u201cNo matter how much money you fork out, you can\u2019t become the general agent anymore. You can try if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201dRyan said, \u201cYou\u2026\u201dAt this point, Old Mrs. Camden suddenly spoke up.\u201cJordan, you good-for-nothing, don\u2019t brag!\u201d\u201cYou first cheated on Hailey, and then you beat up my grandson. Today, I\u2019m going to punish you by using the family rules!\u201d\u201cDo you dare come in!?!\u201dJordan humphed. \u201cWhy not!?!\u201dJordan glanced at the Marriott Hotel\u2019s entrance.Apart from the prestigious Camdens, there were many other guests who were there to attend the banquet.Jordan knew those guests were all distinguished figures in Orlando!They were all government officials, mafia bosses, businessmen, and artists whose strength was unimaginable to ordinary people!However, Jordan did not feel the slightest fear in the face of these bigwigs!They were only so in the tiny Orlando city!Those who lose their advantages or power will be belittled!Jordan followed the Camdens to the lobby of the hotel at a steady gait.They had booked the entire hotel for Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s birthday banquet, and hence, there were no outsiders in the lobby except for the servers.After Jordan entered, even the servers avoided them.Old Mrs. Camden was sitting in a chair in the middle of the living room. Despite her height of 1.6 meters, she looked dignified and majestic!\u201cBastard! Kneel right now!\u201dJordan looked around and asked, \u201cWhy should I do that?\u201dOld Mrs. Camden asked, \u201cThree years ago, when you became a son-in-law of the Camdens. You promised you would be punished according to our family\u2019s laws once you let us down. Does that promise still stand?\u201dJordan straightened his back and exclaimed, \u201cOf course it does!\u201d\u201cOkay, bring my Dragon Ruler here!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden ordered, and Herman immediately handed over the \u201cDragon Ruler\u201d he had prepared long ago.The metal Dragon Ruler, which was left behind by the ancestors of the Camdens, was larger than an ordinary ruler.In the beginning, it was used as a measuring tool, but later it became a tool for enforcing family punishment.After being hit by the ruler, the pain would last for at least three days.Grasping the giant Dragon Ruler, Old Mrs. Camden said, \u201cGood that you admit to it. Someone, slap him twenty times!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHerman had long wanted to stand up for his son and hence was the first to walk forward.However, Benedict snatched the Dragon Ruler from him with one hand.\u201cMom, I failed to take my son-in-law in hand, so I\u2019ll teach him a lesson myself!\u201dAs soon as Benedict held onto the ruler, Sylvie snatched it from him.\u201cI\u2019ve always been the one to slap him. Let me do it!\u201dThe few of them vied to hit Jordan.Jordan, however, did not expect Hailey to speak up as well.\u201cHe\u2019s my husband. I\u2019ll do it!\u201dHailey picked up the Dragon Ruler with her slender hand that Jordan had never held in the past three years.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now, you even want to slap me? You\u2019re such a good wife. I\u2019ve married a rare gem!\u201dJordan could not be more exasperated!To everyone\u2019s surprise, Drew snatched the giant Dragon Ruler and dashed towards Jordan.\u201cDog, how dare you hit me? I\u2019m going to destroy your face!\u201dDrew then tried to swing the Dragon Ruler at Jordan\u2019s face!Jordan stood rooted to the ground without dodging. He grabbed Drew\u2019s arm with his left hand and then twisted it, causing him to slap himself with the giant Dragon Ruler instead.Smack!Drew was struck hard in the face by the giant Dragon Ruler in his hand.That made his face, which was already gruesome, look even worse.Everyone was astounded!How dare a live-in son-in-law hit the heir of the Camdens?!Old Mrs. Camden stood up and hollered, \u201cScoundrel! How dare you act like a brat and cause such a scene here!?! Do you know how many government officials there are here!?! They can arrest you now and put you behind bars!\u201dJordan believed that Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s words were true. Often, the wealthy were acquainted with high-ranking government officials, such as the Camdens. They had ties with distinguished figures of power and stature.However, Jordan looked at the guests and said, \u201cI think the officials should have seen clearly that Drew was the one who tried to hit me with the weapon first, and I was just defending myself.\u201dAll the guests wore ordinary clothing instead of work uniforms. However, one of them, who was tall and bespectacled suddenly spoke up.\u201cHowever, you just said you will accept the punishment according to the family law. Yet, you went back on your word when it was time to exact the punishment. Do you think that\u2019s something a man should do?\u201dAfter that person finished speaking, the crowd chimed in. It was evident that he had a high status.Upon hearing the words of the crowd, Old Mrs. Camden smiled too.Jordan said, \u201cI\u2019m willing to accept the punishment according to the Camden Family\u2019s law but only if I have done something wrong.\u201dOld Mrs. Camden hollered, \u201cYou had an extramarital affair behind Hailey\u2019s back and even hit my grandson. Is that not enough!?\u201dJordan curled his lips in disgust and said, \u201cFor the past three years, I\u2019ve loved Hailey wholeheartedly, and I have never had a change of heart!\u201d\u201cIt was your granddaughter who cheated on me! She checked into a room with Tyler in the Splendor Hotel yesterday. You can go check!\u201dAs soon as she said that, the hall became lively as the guests exchanged pleasantries.\u201cTyler? Do you mean Tyler Collins? The scion of the Collins family?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve long heard that the Camdens intend to let the scion of the Collins marry Hailey. Seems like it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cThe Camdens and the Collins are indeed compatible, but Hailey can just remarry after getting a divorce. It doesn\u2019t seem right for her to have an extramarital affair, does it?\u201d\u201cIt seems that the legendary most beautiful woman of Orlando is not so pure as she\u2019s made out to be.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dUpon hearing the whispers of the crowd, Hailey blushed and bowed her head in embarrassment.\u201cGrandma, everyone, don\u2019t believe his nonsense. I met Tyler yesterday to talk about business. As you are aware, Landmark Realty has been trying to rope in some investors lately, so I met Tyler for that matter.\u201dJordan laughed and gibed, \u201cMust you talk about business in a hotel room, dressed in a bathrobe? Do you take everyone here for fools!?!\u201dAt this moment, a familiar person walked into the hall.Speak of the devil. It was Hailey\u2019s lover, Tyler!\u201cHey, everyone\u2019s here.\u201dTyler had an eye-catching hairstyle and was dressed in expensive clothes with some gifts in his hands. When he saw the commotion in the lobby, he was a little startled.Hailey pulled Tyler over as soon as she saw him.\u201cTyler, this live-in son-in-law of our family insists that I\u2019m in an extramarital affair with you. Quick, tell everyone that I went to see you yesterday for business.\u201dTyler froze, finally realizing why everyone was looking at him with a peculiar gaze.Tyler glared at Jordan and thought to himself, \u2018How dare this good-for-nothing who sponges off his wife expose my affair with Hailey in front of so many people!\u2019It was common for upper-class members to engage in sordid acts. Still, the most critical difference between them and hooligans was that, despite their misdeeds, they built a positive image for themselves.Tyler said, \u201cEveryone, don\u2019t listen to what this good-for-nothing Jordan just said. Hailey and I are innocent. She came to see me yesterday, just to deliver a document to me.\u201d\u201cJordan, you said that Hailey was cheating on you with me, but do you have any proof, like videos or photos?\u201dTyler questioned Jordan instead.Tyler knew that Jordan did not take out his cell phone to take any photos or videos at the hotel yesterday.The only video that could prove Hailey\u2019s stay in the hotel room was also deleted by Tyler, who had managed to do so by using his connections.Tyler just had to deny vehemently now.Seeing that Jordan could not produce any evidence, Tyler laughed and said,\u201cEveryone, the reason why Jordan slandered me is because of another matter.\u201d\u201cMaybe all of you don\u2019t know this, but this live-in son-in-law also works as a part-time deliveryman. I ordered takeout yesterday, and it happened to be delivered by him.\u201d\u201cYet, he had a horrible attitude just because he had the Camdens as his backer, and he even tossed the takeout I ordered onto the ground.\u201d\u201cHence, I gave him a one-star rating.\u201d\u201cIt just so happens that Mr. Dunn, the general agent of Ubereats, is also here.

He only needed to enter the employee number into the app to check the takeout orders that Jordan had recently delivered.After checking, Ryan nodded and said, \u201cTyler is right. He received a one-star rating yesterday! The reason for the bad rating is a poor attitude and throwing the takeout onto the ground, exactly like what Tyler said!\u201dPublic opinion also shifted at this point, and the crowd began to believe Ryan and Hailey.Jordan looked at Hailey and said, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to explain why I dropped the takeout on the ground?\u201dHailey folded her arms, accentuating her figure while pretending to be innocent. \u201cYou weren\u2019t attentive at work, and you have poor tolerance!\u201d\u201cHahaha, well said!\u201dJordan wanted to applaud Hailey.\u2018How can she have the cheek to say that!?!\u2019\u2018Her husband dropped the things in his hands when he saw his wife in a room with another man and yet, she blamed it on him for having a poor tolerance!\u2019\u2018Am I supposed to pretend not to see it and hand the takeout over to your lover before getting down on my knees to beg you to give me a five-star rating!?!\u2019\u201cPunk, you were the one who made a mistake at work. Yet, you maligned Tyler and Hailey.\u201d\u201cShut up if you can\u2019t produce the evidence!\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if she cheated on you. You have no right to make a scene because you are just a live-in son-in-law!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHailey was a famous heiress of a wealthy family in Orlando, while Jordan was a live-in son-in-law whom everyone despised.No one spoke up for Jordan as they all stood on Hailey\u2019s side.\u201cHaha, it really is a world where only the rich have a say.\u201dJordan did not explain much, as he felt it was pointless. He simply looked at Old Mrs. Camden.\u201cYou guys said I had an extramarital affair. Do you have proof?\u201dOld Mrs. Camden looked at Hailey, who shook her head.Old Mrs. Camden said, \u201cSince none of you have any evidence against each other, we\u2019ll drop this matter.\u201d\u201cHowever, the fact you beat Drew up cannot just be forgotten.\u201dJordan looked at Drew and said, \u201cHe cut me with a knife at the entrance of Green Park Estate. There are surveillance cameras everywhere in the estate, and the estate security officers can testify that I was defending myself.\u201d\u201cIf you have to pursue this matter, we\u2019ll call the police. If I get detained, I promise Drew won\u2019t be able to escape either!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden, Herman, and the others were all flustered.They knew the law. Jordan fought with his bare hands while Drew had a knife with him. Drew would face a heavier sentence.Old Mrs. Camden pointed her finger at Jordan and said scornfully, \u201cGreat, you\u2019ve been sponging off us, and now you\u2019re very capable, huh? You\u2019ve just hit my grandson. Do you want to hit me now!?!\u201dJordan said respectfully, \u201cGrand\u2026 Old Mrs. Camden, I\u2019ve always been respectful towards you for the past three years, and I\u2019ve been serving you wholeheartedly too.\u201d\u201cI promise you, as long as Drew does not provoke me in the future, I won\u2019t do anything to him.\u201d\u201cI only have one request. I hope you will agree to Hailey getting a divorce with me!\u201dJordan had taken care of Old Mrs. Camden for the past three years, more than Drew had ever done in his entire life.However, Jordan was a live-in grandson-in-law of hers, after all. Regardless of how much effort he put in, he would never compare to Drew.Old Mrs. Camden looked at the crowd and said,\u201cEveryone, as you all know, three years ago, the Camdens accepted a live-in son-in-law because of a marriage agreement that my late husband set. Many of you here were the close friends and business partners of my late husband for decades!\u201d\u201cIn the past three years, Hailey has been unhappy, but for the sake of fulfilling my late husband\u2019s wishes, Hailey\u2019s parents have mentioned a divorce to me several times, but I\u2019ve turned down all their requests!\u201d\u201cEveryone in town loves my granddaughter Hailey, and most of you refer to her as the most beautiful woman in Orlando, so there is no need for me to tell you which is the more unworthy person.\u201d\u201cToday, Jordan beat up my grandson and maligned my granddaughter and Tyler. So, I\u2019ve decided not to abide by my late husband\u2019s wishes!\u201d\u201cI declare that Jordan will no longer be a live-in-son-in-law of the Camdens, and he will be kicked out of the Camden Family with immediate effect!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden\u2019s voice was loud and authoritative.Hearing Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s words, the crowd all raised their wine glasses.\u201cCongratulations, Old Mrs. Camden, congratulations, Hailey!\u201d\u201cCongratulations, we\u2019ve gotten rid of a good-for-nothing. We can now finally find a better man who\u2019s compatible with Hailey!\u201dSylvie also raised her glass happily and clinked glasses with the guests, unable to contain the joy that was showing on her face.\u201cThank you, everyone. I now reveal a piece of information to you. Hailey and Jordan have always slept in separate rooms for the past three years, and he has never even touched Hailey\u2019s hand before. Hailey\u2026 is still a virgin!\u201dAfter hearing Sylvie\u2019s words, many of the bachelors present ogled at Hailey with great interest.Hailey also began chiding Sylvie coquettishly.\u201cMom, why are you talking about this in front of so many people? It\u2019s making me shy.\u201dHailey\u2019s words delighted the guests.The Camdens had finally agreed to let Hailey and Jordan get a divorce. However, at this moment, they were all rejoicing and celebrating.That made Jordan disgruntled.\u201cAre you guys so happy to get rid of me? Hailey, if you find out my true identity, I wonder if you\u2019d still be able to laugh!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had always been high up in the air, like a queen in front of Jordan.However, the humble and lowly servant, Jordan, has rebelled today!Feeling aggrieved, Hailey dashed towards Old Mrs. Camden and hugged onto one of the latter\u2019s arms with both hands.\u201cGrandma, we\u2019re taking it too easy on him by letting him go just like that!\u201dDrew, who was also on the same side as Hailey, walked over.\u201cHailey is right. We must teach him a lesson!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden crossed her aged hands and patted her grandchildren while comforting them.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let others bully my family members!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden then walked towards the guests and said, \u201cEveryone, Jordan wasted three precious years of my granddaughter\u2019s life and even beat up my grandson. The Camden family has been famous and dignified in Orlando for the past few decades. If we let the matter go just like that, I\u2019m afraid that in the future, there will be more people who will not take us seriously!\u201dEveryone fell silent, thinking to themselves that Old Mrs. Camden was definitely planning to punish Jordan!Jordan put down his glass and listened to what they had to say. He was waiting to see how the Camden family planned to deal with him!Old Mrs. Camden continued, \u201cEveryone here is a bigwig in all industries in Orlando. I implore all of you to help me make sure Jordan doesn\u2019t have a way out in the future!\u201dMake sure Jordan doesn\u2019t have a way out!The most important thing to a person is their source of income. The Camden family was out to cut off Jordan\u2019s means of livelihood in Orlando!The guests were discussing incessantly, but no one responded for a while.They were examining the situation and estimating the consequences.Those who are in business are the most intelligent.After all, cutting off one\u2019s means of livelihood is akin to killing their parents. No one would be willing to offend others unless it was their last resort.At this juncture, Tyler was the first to stand up.\u201cI\u2019m willing to stand in solidarity with the Camdens on behalf of the Collins!\u201d\u201cEveryone, let me introduce myself. I\u2019m Tyler, and my family is involved in many industries like hospitality, investments, and many others.\u201d\u201cFrom today onwards, I guarantee that Jordan will not be granted a stay in all hotels and inns below four stars in Orlando!\u201d\u201cYou are only worthy of sleeping on the streets!\u201dAt first, some people did not know who Tyler was. After all, he was very young, and many of the guests present were in their forties or fifties.However, after his introduction, everyone learned of his identity.\u201cSo it\u2019s the scion of the Collins, huh? I heard that 70% of the hotels in Orlando are owned by them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not all. The Collins owns shares in various renowned brands like Hyatt and Marriott!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s over for Jordan. He can\u2019t even get a room for some hanky panky business with women in the future. Haha.\u201dJordan couldn\u2019t help but feel an urge to laugh. \u2018I\u2019m the scion of the Steeles. Why would I have to stay in hotels that are four stars and below?\u2019Tyler took the lead, and because Jordan was just a live-in son-in-law in Orlando who did not have extensive connections, everyone started bullying him too.Soon another man stood out.That man, who was in his forties, glared at Jordan before saying,\u201cEveryone, I am Zack Ward, the owner of Supreme Restaurant. I\u2019ve been in the F&B business for two decades.\u201d\u201cI am willing to stand in solidarity with the Camdens to cut off Jordan\u2019s future means of a livelihood!\u201d\u201cWith my connections in the F&B industry, I believe Jordan will never be able to work in any restaurant in Orlando in the future!\u201dThe members of the Camden family thanked them.Ryan stepped up, too. \u201cI, Ryan Dunn, am the general agent of Ubereats of Orlando, and I also stand in solidarity with the Camdens to cut off Jordan\u2019s future means of livelihood!\u201d\u201cJordan, you can forget about continuing to deliver takeout in the future. You won\u2019t be able to work for Ubereats or other companies!\u201dJordan could not help but burst into laughter. He felt as if he were the protagonist of an action novel being cornered into desperation by a bunch of antagonists.However, the people in front of him were much more foolish than the villains of those novels.Jordan said, \u201cI\u2019ll be boycotted in the hotel and takeout delivery industries. What else?\u201dAnother person stood out and said, \u201cI\u2019m the boss of Goldmine Karaoke. You won\u2019t be able to get a job as a server in all karaoke joints and bars in the future!\u201d\u201cHahaha, great, any more?\u201d Jordan continued to ask.Soon, two more people came forward, but the jobs they listed were all low-skilled jobs.In their opinion, Jordan was poorly educated and lacked job experience. Hence, to them, he was only worthy of those low-level labor jobs.As long as his means of livelihood were cut off, he would have no way to survive in Orlando.Seeing that Jordan did not seem to be panicking, Drew suddenly interjected, \u201cJordan, this punk is so good at fighting. Will he apply for a job as a bodyguard?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Whom among you can cut off his potential career path as a bodyguard?\u201dEveryone fell silent. In Orlando, there were too many wealthy people, and no one dared claim that they knew them all or even had the right to speak in front of them.At this moment, a woman who had been seated quietly for a long time suddenly laughed charmingly.Everyone followed the voice, only to see a woman wearing a red business suit seated with her legs crossed and was incredibly alluring!The woman seemed to be in her early thirties, but she had the charm of a mature woman.She had fair skin and sexy red lips. Dressed in a skin-tight short skirt, she made the imagination of many people run wild.\u201cHey, Miss Clarke, when did you arrive? Sorry for not welcoming you earlier. Please forgive me!\u201dAfter noticing that woman, Herman walked over excitedly.Looking at the woman lustfully, Ryan patted Herman on his shoulder and asked,\u201cMr. Camden, who is this beauty? Introduce her.\u201dHerman looked at Ryan with contempt and thought, \u2018Ryan really doesn\u2019t fit in with the upper-class circle in Orlando. He doesn\u2019t even know who this woman is!\u2019Herman said, \u201cShe\u2019s the deputy president of Ace Corporation, Miss Victoria Clarke!\u201d\u201cWhat? The deputy president of Ace Corporation?\u201dRyan and the others were stunned. They knew how influential the Ace Corporation was in Orlando.To be able to reach the position of deputy president, she was definitely extraordinary.The fact that Victoria managed to reach the deputy president of Ace Corporation at such a young age made everyone wonder if she had used any connections.Jordan suddenly frowned, carefully looked at Victoria, and said with surprise, \u201cShe\u2019s from our company\u2026\u201d\u201cThere are many wealthy people in Orlando, and the Camdens have wide connections, but we only know about two-thirds of them.\u201d Herman laughed.\u201cHowever, if there is one person who knows all the wealthy people in Orlando and has a good relationship with them all\u2026\u201d\u201cI believe there is only one person in Orlando, and she is Miss Clarke!\u201dHearing Herman\u2019s words, Ryan also decided to curry favor. \u201cMiss Clarke is such a ravishing beauty. I\u2019m afraid all the rich people in Orlando would want to get to know her!\u201dVictoria frowned and said, \u201cYou guys are making it sound like all the rich people in Orlando are in an affair with me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, my bad.\u201dRyan hurriedly bowed and kept his eyes fixed on Victoria\u2019s stilettos. He couldn\u2019t help but swallow his saliva.Herman looked at Victoria and said, \u201cMiss Clarke, please intervene and leave Jordan with no way out!\u201dSince Victoria appeared at Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s birthday banquet, it proved that she had some ties with the Camdens.The Camden family had recently given Victoria many benefits to receive 70 million dollars from the Ace Corporation.If Ace Corporation had not suddenly had a change of president, Victoria would have long granted the investment of 70 million dollars to the Camdens\u2019 family company.However, Victoria had her own way of doing things and would not obey Herman\u2019s orders.In the upper-class circle in Orlando, many people were aware that Victoria was the one who had rich men wrapped around her finger and not the other way around.Victoria did not reply and instead took out an elegant-looking box of CAPRI ladies\u2019 cigarettes from her pink Chanel bag before pulling out a cigarette from the box.Just like Victoria, the CAPRI ladies\u2019 cigarettes were slender and exuded a feminine tenderness and sultriness.Those cigarettes could only be purchased abroad and hence, were extremely expensive. However, Jordan had once smoked it abroad.\u2018These cigarettes taste cool and refreshing. Does Victoria taste the same?\u2019Jordan actually couldn\u2019t help but harbor designs on Victoria too. She was indeed incredibly charming!Victoria was seated cross-legged with the cigarette in her right hand while the men around her all pulled out their lighters and were ready to light her cigarette for her!They were Ryan, Zack, Herman, and Benedict!Seeing this scene, Jordan smiled. It was so similar to the scene in the film, Mal\u00e8na!However, Victoria was probably sexier and even more feminine than Monica Bellucci!However, Victoria did not choose any of the men around her.She looked at Jordan and curled her finger at him. \u201cCome here.\u201dEveryone was hollering at Jordan furiously, but Victoria spoke to Jordan with great tenderness.\u2018This woman is not simple. No wonder she can become the deputy president of Ace Corporation.\u2019Jordan thought to himself. Since he was interested in her too, Jordan decided to walk over.Victoria looked at Jordan with a charming smile and said, \u201cYou, light my cigarette.\u201dThe surrounding men who were holding various expensive lighters all froze in astonishment!\u201cMiss Clarke actually let that good-for-nothing light her cigarette!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t get it. What right does that good-for-nothing have!?!\u201dTo the upper-class men of Orlando, lighting a cigarette for a woman was actually an honor.Jordan answered right away, \u201cI don\u2019t have a lighter!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She placed the cigarette that was already in her mouth back into the cigarette case.She then got up from her seat and walked towards Jordan.Victoria was tall and slender. After putting on her stilettos, she was actually about the same height as Jordan.She scanned Jordan from head to toe and was pleased to find that Jordan was rather handsome.Victoria said condescendingly, \u201cName.\u201dJordan asked in confusion, \u201cWhat name?\u201dVictoria said, \u201cYour name.\u201dJordan asked, \u201cAre you deaf? Didn\u2019t Herman just say that my name is Jordan Steele?\u201d\u201cScoundrel! Don\u2019t be rude to Miss Clarke!\u201d Herman berated Jordan loudly.Victoria waved her hand indifferently and said, \u201cJordan, on account that you share the same surname as the new president of Ace Corporation, I\u2019d like to give you a way out.\u201dThe crowd was shocked, especially the Camden family, whose focus was not on the last sentence but the one before it.The new president of Ace Corporation was surnamed Steele too!\u201cI finally know the surname of the new president of Ace Corporation,\u201d Old Mrs. Camden said, feeling much more joyous.\u2018How can an insignificant Jordan be as important as a huge deal of 70 million dollars?\u2019Benedict hurriedly stepped forward and asked, \u201cMiss Clarke, what is Mr. Steele\u2019s full name?\u201dVictoria smiled and replied, \u201cMr. Steele doesn\u2019t want too many people to know about him for now. I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t tell you yet.\u201dIn fact, Victoria did not know his full name either. All she knew was that he was surnamed Steele and was of a young age.Jordan guessed that Victoria definitely did not know that he was the president of Ace Corporation. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have asked him to light her cigarette.Jordan smiled and asked, \u201cMiss Clarke, how do you plan to give me a way out?\u201dVictoria said, \u201cAs long as you bow and scrape while apologizing to Old Mrs. Camden, Drew, and your wife, I\u2019ll be willing to mediate the situation.\u201d\u201cAfterwards, I will also hire you to be my personal bodyguard with an annual salary of 30,000 dollars.\u201dAfter she said that, everyone got into an uproar.\u201cMiss Clarke is trying to protect that punk Jordan! Why!?!\u201d\u201cAs long as he kneels and admits to his mistake, he will not be boycotted. He can even become the bodyguard of the beautiful Miss Clarke. This punk would definitely agree to it!\u201dVictoria looked at Jordan with some ambiguity in her gaze, and somehow, jealousy arose in Hailey\u2019s heart!Hailey grabbed Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s arm aggrievedly and said, \u201cGrandma, Miss Clarke is going against you.\u201dDrew said softly, \u201cYes, we can\u2019t let Jordan have a way out. Isn\u2019t Miss Clarke usually on good terms with us? Why isn\u2019t she helping us?\u201dDrew could not figure it out at all. To Drew, Jordan was just a live-in son-in-law who had no background but had received at least a million benefits from the Camden family!Old Mrs. Camden patted the hands of her grandchildren and said softly, \u201cKids, learn from her. Miss Clarke is brilliant.\u201d\u201cWhy did she become the deputy president at such a young age?\u201d\u201cWhy is she able to effortlessly be acquainted with every wealthy person?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because she never offends anyone easily and can make any man infatuated with her and grateful towards her.\u201d\u201cHailey, you have to work hard to become a woman like Victoria.\u201dHailey looked at Victoria while biting her lip, overwhelmed with jealousy.The Camden family began sighing. Since Victoria had pleaded for Jordan, there was no way they could force him to a dead end.However, they did not expect\u2026\u201cI refuse.\u201dJordan said slowly!Jordan actually turned down the great favor that Victoria had offered him!Everyone didn\u2019t understand why Jordan would do that!They felt that it would not be embarrassing for Jordan, the live-in son-in-law of the Camden family, to bow and scrape to them and admit his mistakes.Besides, he could work for a ravishing beauty like Victoria and draw a high annual salary.Even a fool would know which option to choose!Yet Jordan actually\u2026 turned her down.Victoria was in disbelief, too. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dJordan looked at Victoria and said, \u201cI said, I refuse.\u201dVictoria looked a little furious. \u201cRepeat yourself!\u201dJordan gently pinched Victoria\u2019s ear with his right hand and shouted into her ear, \u201cI refuse!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dVictoria was flustered, and she retreated continuously, her ears tickled by Jordan\u2019s voice.\u201cHow dare you attack Miss Clarke!?!\u201dHerman yelled, but he dared not go forward.Jordan spread his hands and said, \u201cSorry, Miss Clarke, I thought you had a bad sense of hearing, and I was scared that you couldn\u2019t hear me, so I yelled into your ear.\u201d\u201cVery well, Jordan, you have guts!\u201dVictoria didn\u2019t expect this live-in son-in-law to be so disrespectful to her.In that case, she felt that there was no need for her to defend him anymore!\u201cOld Mrs. Camden, I, Victoria, the deputy president of Ace Corporation, am willing to stand in solidarity with the Camden family and leave Jordan with no future.\u201d She stated respectfully.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the future, there will be no chance for you to survive in Orlando anymore. Hahaha!\u201dDrew guffawed loudly.Though Hailey took pity on Jordan, she nevertheless raised her head arrogantly and secretly thought,\u2018This is all your fault! You should just put up with everything that I\u2019ve done to you!\u2019However, Jordan remained calm and collected.He asked Victoria, \u201cMiss Clarke, may I ask if your words just now represent you as an individual or the Ace Corporation?\u201dVictoria folded her arms and said, \u201cOf course I represent both.\u201dJordan continued to ask, \u201cYou\u2019re the deputy president of the Ace Corporation, not the president. What right do you have to represent the entire Ace Corporation?\u201dJordan\u2019s questioning made Victoria feel embarrassed.Although everyone recognized Victoria\u2019s power, she was indeed not the highest authority in Ace Corporation. By right, she should not be making a stand on behalf of the corporation\u2019s president.She could only do so if she and the president were in a very close relationship, such as husband and wife.Victoria paused for a moment before continuing, \u201cAlright, I didn\u2019t want to say it at first, but since you want to know the reason for your death, I will tell you guys.\u201d\u201cActually, the new president of Ace Corporation, Mr. Steele, is my lover!\u201dHer words caused a massive uproar in the entire event location of the birthday banquet.\u201cWhat? The mysterious Mr. Steele is actually Miss Clarke\u2019s boyfriend? No wonder he managed to become the president out of nowhere!\u201d\u201cThe person who can be compatible and worthy of Miss Clarke must be a domineering president like Mr. Steele. They\u2019re a match made in heaven.\u201d\u201cGood-for-nothing Jordan. They\u2019re a couple in a romantic relationship. They even sleep together. Of course she can represent Mr. Steele and the entire Ace Corporation!\u201d\u201cYeah, how dare he question the ability and authority of Miss Clarke? He has a death wish!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThis time, it was Jordan\u2019s turn to freeze in shock.\u2018Damn it, since when did I become your lover, Victoria?\u2019\u2018Aren\u2019t you embarrassed to call me your boyfriend in front of me!?!\u2019At this moment, the Camdens were the most excited.Herman said excitedly, \u201cMiss Clarke, why didn\u2019t you reveal sooner that the new president Mr. Steele is your lover? Since he\u2019s your boyfriend, we\u2019re relieved now!\u201dBenedict also came over and said, \u201cYeah, Miss Clarke, you must talk to Mr. Steele about the contract.\u201dThe Camdens had already bribed Victoria. Since the president, Mr. Steele, was Victoria\u2019s lover, they reckoned that the 70 million dollar investment would be a sure bet.Victoria said, \u201cMy boyfriend is very attentive and serious when it comes to working. He has always drawn a clear line between work and personal life. He doesn\u2019t like bringing romance into the office.\u201d\u201cSo, I hope that you can help me keep this a secret.\u201dJordan couldn\u2019t help but feel an urge to laugh. \u2018You found such a lame excuse after you\u2019re done bragging because you\u2019re scared that others might leak this.\u2019After saying that, Victoria looked at Jordan and questioned, \u201cWhat else do you have to say?\u201dNot willing to expose her, Jordan held his laughter in and asked, \u201cI heard that Mr. Steele not only has a massive amount of wealth but is also extremely handsome, even more so than celebrities. He\u2019s also proficient in music, chess, literature, and art. Miss Clarke, you might be beautiful, but I doubt Mr. Steele would take a fancy to you.\u201dVictoria humphed coldly. \u201cOutstanding people are always attracted to each other! Mr. Steele also fell in love with me at first sight. He even booked an entire island in Southeast Asia and set up a grand ceremony to confess to me and ask me to be his girlfriend!\u201dThe girls in the room were all green with envy when they heard that.Dumbfounded, Jordan stared at Victoria, thinking to himself, \u2018This woman is really good at making things up!\u2019Jordan smiled and shook his head. \u201cMs. Clarke, since you\u2019re so close to Mr. Steele, I have nothing to say.\u201dOld Mrs. Camden smiled and said, \u201cThank you, thank you all for doing us this favor on my behalf!\u201dDrew walked towards Orlando again. \u201cHaha, good-for-nothing, you will no longer have a foothold in Orlando from now on.

The time was 12 o\u2019clock.Old Mrs. Camden said, \u201cIt\u2019s exactly 12 noon. The birthday banquet has officially started. Eat something before you go.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Hailey knew that Old Mrs. Camden was a very traditional person. Hence, she couldn\u2019t go anywhere because it was time to eat.Besides, it was Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s 80th birthday banquet, and hence, they had to follow the rules.Drew pointed to the hall entrance and said, \u201cJordan, get lost and wait outside. Hailey will go to the lawyer\u2019s office with you after she\u2019s done eating.\u201dHowever, at this moment, Old Mrs. Camden suddenly said, \u201cJordan, you can stay and eat together with us.\u201dDrew exclaimed in shock, \u201cGrandma, why are you letting him stay? He\u2019s not worthy!\u201dJordan was also a little surprised.Old Mrs. Camden said, \u201cSince the divorce has not been finalized yet, he is still a member of the Camdens, and hence, I am obliged to feed him!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Still, Old Mrs. Camden preferred the banquet to be lively and arranged for it to be in the grand hall.Drew looked at Jordan, who was seated beside him and was incredibly furious.\u201cJordan, this meal is the last meal you can have in Orlando. You\u2019d better eat more while you can because you might not even be able to afford steamed buns in the future. Hahaha!\u201dDrew\u2019s younger sister, Elle, also chimed in, \u201cBrother, you\u2019re exaggerating. How can he not even afford steamed buns? He can just become a beggar.\u201dDrew guffawed loudly. \u201cMy sister is right. You can become a beggar. We\u2019ll allow you to become a beggar, hahaha.\u201dJordan had long gotten used to Drew\u2019s mockery and hence, didn\u2019t feel much at this moment.However, Elle\u2019s sudden interjection made Jordan glance at her.Elle was Jordan\u2019s cousin-in-law. Although she was not as pretty as Hailey, she was known for her fantastic figure in Orlando.Due to the animosity between Hailey and Elle, Jordan seldom interacted with Elle.Seeing that Jordan was silent after he mocked him, Drew picked up a glass of wine and walked towards Ryan seated beside him.\u201cMr. Dunn, thank you so much for what you\u2019ve done today. The scene of you making Jordan undress out there is too classic. It was as if you were disciplining a dog!\u201dRyan smiled and clinked glasses with Drew. \u201cMr. Camden, you\u2019re too polite. If I had known earlier, I would have asked you to take a video in advance. When you\u2019re bored, you can watch it and unwind a little.\u201d\u201cHahaha, Mr. Dunn, you\u2019re right. We really should have recorded that scene.\u201dDrew said while laughing loudly as if he was scared that Jordan would not hear him.Jordan glanced at Ryan, who noticed him and then immediately snapped.\u201cWhat are you looking at!?! If you dare to apply for a job in my delivery company in the future, I\u2019ll break your legs!\u201dJordan\u2019s eyes were full of murderous intent. He felt he had to get rid of Ryan immediately.Jordan picked up the phone and called the butler of the Steele family, Butler Frank.Jordan\u2019s grandfather specially arranged for Butler Frank to assist Jordan in his mission.Previously, he was the one who had informed Jordan that the mission of being a live-in son-in-law had ended and he could assume the role of president of Ace Corporation.\u201cSir!\u201d Butler Frank quickly answered the call.Jordan said, \u201cThere\u2019s a takeout delivery business owner who always wants to invite my grandfather to dinner. What\u2019s his name?\u201dButler Frank answered, \u201cYou mean James Willis, the CEO of Ubereats Delivery?\u201dOrlando said, \u201cYes, him. Contact him and tell him to revoke the Orlando proxy of Ubereats Delivery.\u201dHailey and Elle, who sat at the same table as Jordan and Ryan, Victoria, and the others at the following table were all stunned when they heard his words.Butler Frank said, \u201cOkay, he has always wanted to get to know Mr. Steele Senior. It would definitely please him to carry out your instructions. Actually, he is now worth over 10 billion dollars and is qualified to have a meal with Mr. Steele Senior.\u201dJordan said, \u201cYes, this kid has been developing well in the past few years. Arrange for him to meet me someday. I\u2019ll treat him to a meal.\u201dAfter saying that, Jordan hung up the phone.There was a moment of silence at the venue.A moment later\u2026\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201dDrew laughed so hard that the injuries on his face seemed to have expanded.\u201cHahahaha\u2026 What a joke, Jordan. What are you pretending for? Revoke the proxy of Mr. Dunn? Who do you think you are!?!\u201dRyan laughed and asked, \u201cPunk, you should consider the time and place, even if you want to blow your trumpet. What\u2019s the point of pretending here? Who would be fooled by a country bumpkin like you?\u201d\u201cYour grandfather is a farmer while Mr. Willis is worth billions. Why would he invite your grandfather to dinner? You\u2019re living in a dream!\u201dWith a look of disgust, Hailey gibed, \u201cHow revolting. If you\u2019re incompetent, so be it. Why do you have to pretend?\u201dVictoria was the only one looking at Jordan with a stern expression.Without saying anything, Jordan picked up his chopsticks and helped himself to some appetizers.After about six minutes or so, Ryan\u2019s cell phone started ringing.Looking at the incoming call alert, Ryan excitedly put down his crockery, wiped his hands, and answered the call.\u201cHello, Mr. Willis!\u201dUpon hearing that it was Mr. Willis who called, the Camdens and Victoria, and the others looked over and told everyone to stay silent.In recent years, the takeout industry has been booming. James Willis had also become an upstart worth more than 10 billion dollars.The people present were all wealthy figures of Orlando who wanted to use Ryan to become friends with James.Ryan said excitedly, \u201cMr. Willis, I was just planning to call you in the next two days to discuss the renewal of the contract.\u201dJames said, \u201cI specially called to inform you that your proxy in Orlando has been revoked!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I can\u2019t let them notice anything fishy!\u2019Ryan forced a smile and said, \u201cHaha, thank you Mr. Willis. I told you we have a good relationship and we\u2019d definitely continue with the cooperation. I\u2019ve already prepared the renewal fee for this round. I\u2019ve prepared a million dollars!\u201dJames said over the phone, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Dunn, our company has sent someone from the headquarters to take over Ubereats Delivery in Orlando. We don\u2019t need a general agent anymore.\u201dRyan\u2019s heart was filled with despair, but he was still laughing out loud. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, no problem, we must drink to our heart\u2019s content when we meet!\u201dJames was somewhat confused. He said, \u201cDid you actually hear what I said? You are no longer the agent, and no amount of money you spend will matter!\u201dRyan said, \u201cOkay, okay, Mr. Willis, rest assured, we will definitely have a joyous cooperation in the future!\u201dJames said, \u201cYou must be out of your mind. You\u2019re not replying to what I said! Anyway, when the agency contract expires next month, the headquarters will send someone over to take over. That\u2019s all I have to say, bye.\u201dRyan exclaimed, \u201cOkay, Mr. Willis, let\u2019s meet again!\u201dRyan smiled and hung up.Jordan frowned in puzzlement. \u2018Could it be that Butler Frank hasn\u2019t informed James yet?\u2019\u2018Why did Ryan have such a happy chat with James?\u2019The others could only hear Ryan talking, but they could not listen to what he was saying over the phone.Drew was the first one to walk over. \u201cMr. Dunn, based on what you mentioned just now, I assume that the contract renewal has been settled?\u201dRyan smiled and said, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s going to be a pleasant cooperation!\u201dDrew hurriedly raised his glass and said, \u201cCome on, Mr. Dunn, let me toast to you. I wish you boundless prosperity!\u201d\u201cThank you, Mr. Camden.\u201d Ryan said as he raised his glass of white wine and chugged it in one go!Drew exclaimed in surprise, \u201cWow, you\u2019re really straightforward, Mr. Dunn, you chugged it all!\u201dVictoria also picked up her glass and said, \u201cMr. Dunn, I can tell that you\u2019re very close to Mr. Willis.\u201dAfter chugging that glass of wine, Ryan felt a little upset because of the melancholy within him. However, he soon filled his glass to the brim again.Victoria\u2019s charming face gradually became blurred in Ryan\u2019s vision.Ryan said, \u201cOf course, Mr. Willis and I have been through thick and thin!\u201dVictoria said, \u201cI shall toast to you too, Mr. Dunn. I wish you a prosperous business, and I hope that we\u2019ll have the chance to get to know Mr. Willis through you.\u201dRyan clinked glasses with Victoria and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a minor matter. Let me arrange it.\u201dRyan drank another glass of wine, and the people around him cheered incessantly.\u201cMr. Dunn, you can really hold your liquor well!\u201d\u201cYou seem to be in great spirits. Now that the renewal contract has been signed, Mr. Dunn. You\u2019re in the mood to drink, aren\u2019t you?\u201dHowever, after less than two minutes, the crowd suddenly realized that Ryan was crying while drinking.His tears landed on the colorless white wine and mixed with it.\u201cMr. Dunn, why are you crying? Are you alright?\u201d Victoria hurriedly asked.At this juncture, Jordan shook his head and said helplessly,\u201cRyan, stop trying to hang on if you can\u2019t. Even if you want to boast, there is a time and place to do so. Is there a point in pretending? Who can\u2019t tell that you are pretending? Why do you not dare to tell everyone that you have been removed as an agent?\u201dJordan said to Ryan the exact words that the latter had said to him!In fact, Victoria and the others had long since sensed that there was something wrong with Ryan. If he had really clinched the contract renewal, he would not be behaving in such an extreme manner.He should only behave that way if the contract renewal had fallen through.Ryan knew that he did not have a strong background or business empire. He only managed to mix into the upper-class circle of Orlando a few years ago and become the general agent of Ubereats Delivery, all thanks to luck.Once he was no longer the agent, he would not be fit to chat and laugh with the people in this room!Hence, he had to pretend!However, Jordan had now mercilessly exposed him!In a drunken stupor, Ryan slapped the table and then walked towards Jordan.\u201cSo what if my license has been revoked!?! Only because Ubereats Delivery wants to take over personally and will no longer need an agent did I get removed. It\u2019s not because of you, loser!\u201dJordan smiled calmly and sipped on some tea. \u201cInteresting, you clearly saw me making a call, and now you\u2019re taking the initiative to clear my name.\u201d\u201cHaha, since you think I didn\u2019t do it, fine, I can\u2019t be bothered to have another enemy either.\u201dThe guests were all discussing and speculating if Ryan\u2019s agent license revocation had anything to do with Jordan.Most of the people there had just declared solidarity with the Camdens to cut off Jordan\u2019s future!If Jordan was really that powerful, they would be unable to bear the consequences!Seeing this, Benedict hurriedly stood up and said, \u201cEveryone, don\u2019t panic. This definitely has nothing to do with our family\u2019s loser of a son-in-law. His grandfather is a farmer, and he definitely wouldn\u2019t know Mr. Willis who is in the capital!\u201dSylvie also got up and said, \u201cYes, this good-for-nothing has been our son-in-law for three years, and he has always obeyed all our instructions. If he really knows such a powerful figure, how could he be willing to be our dog for three years?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Abandoned Husband DominatesCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter hearing Benedict and Syvie\u2019s words, the guests who were all tensed up and nervous, significantly relaxed.Indeed, wealthy scions were all spoiled rotten from a young age and enjoyed all kinds of privileges. They could not stand being mistreated at all, so how could a scion be willing to become a live-in son-in-law for three years?Everyone felt that the removal of Ryan as the general agent had nothing to do with Jordan.Maybe it was just a coincidence that Jordan happened to be making the call and pretending to be authoritative, or maybe Jordan had learned the news before the call.However, no matter what, Ryan\u2019s career was on the verge of destruction, and that was a fact set in stone.Old Mrs. Camden winked at Herman, who immediately understood, grabbed the red wine that Ryan had just given them, and then walked over.\u201cRyan, take this bottle of wine back. My mother has had a change of preferences lately, and she doesn\u2019t like drinking red wine anymore.\u201dAfter finding out that Ryan had been removed as a general agent, Herman changed the way he addressed Ryan.He was addressing him as \u2018Mr. Dunn\u2019 just now, but now, he was calling him by name!He even returned Ryan\u2019s gift!He clearly didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with Ryan!Ryan frantically said, \u201cMr. Camden, keep the wine for yourself. If Old Mrs. Camden doesn\u2019t drink red wine, you guys can drink it instead.\u201dHerman insisted on returning the wine to Ryan and said, \u201cWe understand your goodwill, but we don\u2019t like drinking either.\u201dRyan took the bottle of wine with a look of embarrassment as he hurriedly returned to his table and got ready to give it away to someone else.\u201cMiss Clarke, Mr. Zack, it took me a lot of effort to buy this bottle of 1990 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti. I\u2019m going to open it now. Let\u2019s finish it!\u201dRyan did not even call the waiter and opened the bottle of wine himself.However, no one was willing to drink the bottle of expensive wine after it was opened.\u201cMiss Clarke, I\u2019ll pour it for you. Please try it.\u201d Ryan said as he walked towards Victoria.Victoria politely refused, \u201cSorry, I drove here. I can\u2019t drink.\u201d\u2018You can\u2019t drink?\u2019Ryan clearly remembered that just now, Victoria had taken the initiative to toast to him!Ryan walked towards Zack, who similarly refuted, \u201cI only drink white wine.\u201dThe other people at the table took the opportunity to pick up their glasses and go to Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s table in a bid to toast to her and wish her a happy birthday.Victoria was the only one left at the table that was lively a while ago.\u201cA poor fellow in a pragmatic society.\u201dSeeing the sorry plight that Ryan was in, Jordan couldn\u2019t help but shake his head.The Camdens and the upper echelons in this circle were all too pragmatic. It was no wonder that Hailey would be unfaithful to her husband for the sake of money.When Ryan saw that Victoria was the only one left at the table, he thought Victoria was still willing to be his friend.Ryan went forth and asked, \u201cMiss Clarke, can we exchange numbers? I\u2019d like to ask Mr. Willis out for a meal if there\u2019s an opportunity in the future.\u201dVictoria took a sip of tea and said, \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t have my cell phone with me.\u201d\u201cOh, alright.\u201dRyan looked highly embarrassed. As a man, the most miserable and agonizing thing was not being beaten up but being despised and looked down on by others.Jordan had already given Ryan the punishment he deserved!Ryan was standing still alone with the bottle of red wine in his hand while the others laughed and chatted merrily among themselves.Seeing that Ryan was in such a miserable state, Jordan took sympathy on him and decided to give him another chance.\u201cRyan.\u201dJordan suddenly called out to Ryan and then took out an empty wine glass.\u201cIf you sincerely apologize to me now, I will allow you to pour me a glass of wine, and then I will tell James Willis that you may renew the contract for another year.\u201dJordan did not state it very clearly, but if he drank the wine Ryan poured, it would mean that he had forgiven Ryan.None of the people whom Ryan poured wine for was willing to drink it, so Jordan was actually doing him a favor.However, Ryan felt that Jordan was taking advantage of him!Ryan said, \u201cThis bottle of wine costs more than a few hundred thousand. If you really want to drink it, just say so. Why are you acting like a big boss?\u201d\u201cYou want me to apologize to you, a good-for-nothing live-in son-in-law? Isn\u2019t that akin to making everyone here look down on me even more? How can I still continue being a part of this circle then!?!\u201dJordan shook his head and said, \u201cIndeed, a pitiful person must have a detestable flaw. In this case, I\u2019ll leave you to fend for yourself!\u201dPreviously, Jordan had some sympathy for Ryan, perhaps because his grandfather raised him to be a kind person.Jordan\u2019s grandfather said that those who are kind are more likely to be happy.Since Ryan did not cherish the opportunity Jordan gave him, the latter no longer had any pity for Ryan.Ryan quickly picked up the red wine and left the banquet awkwardly.After Ryan left, Jordan looked at his despondent back and secretly thought,\u2018I wonder if I will meet this guy again in the future. He will probably be full of regret when he learns that I\u2019m the CEO of Ace Corporation in the future, huh?\u2019While thinking about it, Jordan scooped some soup for himself with the spoon.To his surprise, Elle, seated opposite him, wanted to drink the soup too, and hence, their spoons touched.Clang.\u201cAh, how annoying, my spoon touched the spoon of that good-for-nothing. My spoon is now filthy\u2026\u201dElle immediately sobbed and lamented in repulsion.Drew hurriedly spoke for his sister, \u201cJordan, of all dishes, you just had to vie with my sister. Is this what you wanted?\u201dIn fact, Jordan was just thinking about some matters and did not bother to pay attention to what he wanted to eat.When he took a closer look, he realized it was papaya soup with red dates and lotus seeds.\u201cPapaya\u2026\u201dJordan took a look at Elle\u2019s voluptuous figure and immediately felt awkward.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She then stood still, almost pressing her body close against Jordan.When Jordan looked up, he felt like he was looking at mountain peaks\u2026Elle questioned furiously, \u201cJordan, what do you mean by that just now? Why don\u2019t I need to eat papaya anymore?\u201dJordan was Elle\u2019s cousin-in-law and hence could not state things too explicitly.Jordan said, \u201cForget it, take it that I didn\u2019t say anything. I\u2019ll bring the soup over to you. You can drink it by yourself.\u201dHowever, even after Jordan took the initiative to bring the soup to Elle, the latter still wasn\u2019t appeased.She walked over to Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s table and complained.\u201cGrandma, don\u2019t let Jordan stay for lunch. He didn\u2019t even prepare a birthday gift. Why should he be allowed to eat at your birthday banquet?\u201d\u201cIn the past three years, Uncle and Aunt have wanted to get rid of Jordan. Grandma, if you hadn\u2019t kept him around, how could he stay in our family for three years?\u201d\u201cWhat an ingrate. We may have mistreated him, but we\u2019ve at least let him stay in a luxury apartment and drive an expensive car. Yet, he didn\u2019t even prepare a gift for your 80th birthday.\u201dAlthough Elle was nitpicking on Jordan, she did make some sense.Jordan\u2019s task was to be a live-in son-in-law for three years. If he quit, he would have been considered to have failed, and his grandfather would punish him accordingly.If not for Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s insistence on not letting Hailey divorce Jordan for three years, Jordan\u2019s mission would have failed long ago.Besides, the Camdens had provided for Jordan for three years. Today, he was officially going to leave the Camdens. Moreover, it happened to be Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s 80th birthday, so he ought to have brought her a gift.Jordan thought about it, picked up his cell phone, and then called Butler Frank again.\u201cHey, prepare a birthday gift on my behalf and send it to the Marriott Hotel.\u201dAfter hearing his words, Elle said in disdain, \u201cPsht, have you finally come to your senses? However, we Camdens won\u2019t accept the garbage you send!\u201dDrew also chimed in, \u201cJordan, don\u2019t be an embarrassment. Don\u2019t bring all sorts of garbage to the birthday banquet. Look at all the gifts here. Each one is worth at least 30,000 dollars.\u201dHailey did not want Jordan to embarrass himself and her, either. After all, they were not officially divorced yet, and he would be bringing shame to Hailey and her family.Hailey said, \u201cCall and return your gift. If you insist on giving Grandma a birthday gift, I\u2019ll get someone to prepare one on your behalf.\u201dJordan continued to eat his food and ignored the three of them.Indeed, he did not tell Butler Frank how expensive the gift had to be.However, he knew that the Steeles would never give any cheap gifts!Only ten minutes had passed.A deliveryman suddenly appeared at the entrance of the hotel lobby.The hotel attendant immediately stopped him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s birthday banquet today. No one is allowed to go in.\u201dThe delivery man said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m here to deliver the birthday gift.\u201dAs he spoke, the delivery man took out an exquisite box that was obviously exorbitant.Hence, the attendant let him enter.The delivery man walked inside and asked, \u201cMay I ask whose birthday is it today?\u201dDrew was furious at the sight of the deliveryman\u2019s uniform, and he stood up to rebuke,\u201cIt\u2019s my grandmother\u2019s birthday banquet. Who let you in!?!\u201dThe delivery man explained, \u201cI just met a Rolls Royce owner on East Central Boulevard, and he may not be able to get here right now due to heavy traffic.\u201d\u201cSo, he gave me 50 dollars and asked me to bring this gift to Marriott Hotel.\u201dHearing the mention of the \u201cRolls-Royce owner\u201d, Drew\u2019s attitude immediately changed.\u201cOh, so it\u2019s a birthday gift for my Grandma. Pass the gift to me.\u201dAfter taking the gift box, Drew curiously opened it, only to be astonished.It was an emerald jadeite bracelet!Old Mrs. Camden was also rather curious. \u201cDrew, what gift is it?\u201dDrew hurriedly ran over and said, \u201cGrandma, look, it\u2019s a jadeite bracelet that seems really expensive!\u201dAfter seeing it, Old Mrs. Camden grabbed it excitedly and tried to feel its texture while appreciating its color. She became highly agitated!\u201cWhat an exquisite emerald jadeite! Does anyone here have a rich knowledge of jadeite? Can you give me an estimated price for this bracelet?\u201dAt this moment, a middle-aged man who owned a jewelry store came over.\u201cOld Mrs. Camden, let me take a look for you.\u201dWhile looking at it, the man said, \u201cThis is a type of glass jadeite that has a pure, bright, and even color. There is not a single flaw, and it should be expensive.\u201dAlmost drooling, Hailey asked, \u201cCan you tell me exactly how much it\u2019s worth?\u201dTo observe the jadeite\u2019s translucence under the sunlight, the man walked to a window in the hall entrance where sunlight was streaming in.After looking at it, the man said excitedly: \u201cIt\u2019s not translucent, but completely transparent! This is the best quality of jade! This bracelet is worth at least 1 million dollars!\u201dEveryone was astonished.How could a delivery man just send over something worth 1 million dollars?!Who is this tycoon!?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s so generous! You have to introduce us to him later.\u201dThe crowd came forward and asked Old Mrs. Camden.In fact, Old Mrs. Camden was also at a loss, as she could not imagine who the 1 million dollars gift was from.\u201cThat\u2019s strange. All the families who have ties with the Camdens are present today. We didn\u2019t miss anyone out, so who is this bracelet from?\u201dThe Camdens looked at each other.Elle looked at the bracelet that was worth one million dollars and really wanted to touch it.She suddenly asked, \u201cCould it be from my suitor?\u201dHer words immediately made everyone speculate and start making guesses.Elle had a voluptuous figure which would leave any man who looked at her sleepless at night.Now, she is only 20 years old and single. Many wealthy scions wanted to date her.Herman laughed and said, \u201cThat\u2019s likely! My daughter is so beautiful and has millions of followers on the internet. The gift is likely from a wealthy scion who fancies Elle.\u201dVictoria glanced at Elle. Being a woman who also had an excellent figure, she agreed Elle was indeed very attractive in that aspect.Victoria said, \u201cIn this case, congratulations in advance, Mr. Camden. Your future son-in-law is really generous to have sent a gift that\u2019s worth one million dollars.\u201dHerman said gleefully, \u201cYou flatter me, Miss Clarke.\u201dHailey was incredibly smug too. Seeing that Elle could marry a wealthy man, Hailey was green with envy. She was also looking at Jordan with resentment in her eyes.Jordan was somewhat speechless with the Camdens. He had clearly called someone to send a gift over in front of everyone there.However, no one thought that the gift was from Jordan after it arrived.They would rather believe that it was from Elle\u2019s suitor, which ultimately didn\u2019t make sense!Jordan put down his bowl and cutlery and then asked Hailey, \u201cHailey, have you finished eating?\u201dHailey glowered at Jordan in disdain before asking, \u201cYes, I have. What do you want?\u201dJordan got up from the table and said, \u201cSince we\u2019ve eaten and I\u2019ve already given my gift, let\u2019s go to the lawyer\u2019s office to get a divorce now.\u201d\u201cWait, what did you say? You\u2019ve given the gift? When did you do so?\u201dHailey questioned Jordan.She was just being disgruntled about Jordan\u2019s incompetence because of the matter regarding the gift because even Elle\u2019s suitor had sent a gift worth 1 million dollars.Jordan had at least been the son-in-law of the Camdens for three years, yet he didn\u2019t even prepare a gift.Jordan pointed to the jadeite bracelet on Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s hand and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the gift.\u201dAfter hearing his words, Herman slapped the table furiously and stood up. \u201cJordan! You\u2019re so shameless! How dare you say that this bracelet is a gift from you? It\u2019s worth one million dollars, a massive amount that you will never be able to earn in several lifetimes!\u201dElle was furious, too. \u201cHailey, can you get your wastrel of a husband to stop embarrassing himself? This is clearly a gift from my suitor.\u201dDrew mocked, \u201cYour family of four doesn\u2019t have the ability to send a decent birthday gift, so you claimed someone else\u2019s gift to be yours. You\u2019re such an embarrassment to the Camdens!\u201dFeeling awkward and embarrassed, Hailey barked at Jordan,\u201cLet\u2019s hurry up and go to the lawyer\u2019s office. I don\u2019t want to be your wife any longer, not even for a second!\u201dHailey picked up her bag and strode towards the door.\u201cHailey, let me send you!\u201dTyler hurriedly chased after her, looking rather elated.Jordan turned around and said to Old Mrs. Camden, \u201cFor the past three years, there had been good and bad times, but we used to be a family after all. This bracelet is for you. Happy birthday.\u201dJordan\u2019s mother-in-law, Sylvie, rebuked in annoyance, \u201cOkay, enough, drop the act, hurry up, and get lost. Stop bragging!\u201dDrew touched the wound on his face and said resentfully, \u201cJordan, after you get a divorce, take the train and get lost from Orlando immediately! I don\u2019t want to see you in Orlando again! Do you hear me?\u201dJordan chuckled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s my freedom to decide if I want to leave Orlando or not. You have no right to interfere.\u201dAfter saying that, Jordan also walked out of the door.Just as he stepped out of the Marriott Hotel, a BMW 7-series pulled up while the passenger seat window was slowly rolled down.Tyler and Hailey were inside the car.Tyler said, \u201cPunk, Hailey said you don\u2019t deserve to sit in a BMW, so you\u2019d better ride a public-sharing bike. We\u2019ll wait for you in front of the lawyer\u2019s office.\u201dAfter saying that, Tyler stepped on the accelerator, and the BMW sped off quickly.Jordan casually hailed a cab that passed by and followed closely behind the BMW.They arrived at the entrance of the lawyer\u2019s office, one after another.As soon as they arrived at the lawyer\u2019s office, they pulled out the household register, marriage certificate, and divorce agreement, which they had already prepared.Soon, the two of them were done with the divorce procedure.The lawyer\u2019s office gave each of them a purple divorce certificate.It was officially declared that their marriage had been dissolved, and they were no longer husband and wife!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It felt as if all his pent-up frustration and disgruntlement for the past three years had dissipated.\u201cI\u2019m finally no longer a live-in son-in-law.\u201dJordan walked out of the lawyer\u2019s office and couldn\u2019t help but be emotional.His next experience would be a business endeavor, so he had to devote himself to his career!At this moment, Hailey mocked, \u201cRight, you\u2019re no longer a live-in son-in-law, but an abandoned one! That\u2019s even more embarrassing than a live-in son-in-law!\u201d\u2018An abandoned son-in-law?\u2019\u2018A live-in son-in-law whose wife divorced him?\u2019\u2018It\u2019s up to you to say whatever you want!\u2019Jordan no longer wanted to say anything to the pragmatic woman who only loved money. He hailed a cab casually and left.Hailey was indignant. Although she was the one at fault, she still felt that she hadn\u2019t scolded her husband enough.Hailey got into Tyler\u2019s car and said, \u201cTail him and see if he leaves Orlando.\u201dTyler stepped on the accelerator pedal to catch up to the cab that Jordan was in.He smiled and said, \u201cHe must be leaving Orlando by train. He can no longer make a living in Orlando, and he has no savings either. If he doesn\u2019t leave, he won\u2019t be able to survive in Orlando.\u201dHailey also felt that Jordan would probably choose to leave, but because of the gaze in Jordan\u2019s eyes, she had a vague feeling that things were not that simple.While driving, Tyler glanced at the divorce certificate in Hailey\u2019s hand and laughed.\u201cWhy is the divorce certificate purple? I thought it was green.\u201dHailey nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s now purple. That\u2019s not too bad. Well, divorce is a joyous occasion for us, isn\u2019t it?\u201dTyler chuckled and said, \u201cYes, we should give Jordan a reminder that he\u2019s been made a cuckold. Haha.\u201dHailey laughed and lightly punched Tyler playfully. \u201cYou\u2019re so mean.\u201dAfter a few minutes, Tyler suddenly said in puzzlement, \u201cThis is not the way to the train station.\u201dHailey also became doubtful. \u201cIs it the way to the airport?\u201dTyler shook his head and said, \u201cNo, he\u2019s heading to the West Lake area.\u201dHailey gently pinched her hair and asked. \u201cIs he not planning to leave Orlando?\u201dTyler humphed coldly. \u201cHe\u2019s probably going to check into a hotel room. Don\u2019t worry, with our family\u2019s connections in the hotel industry, I guarantee that he won\u2019t be able to stay in any hotel below four stars!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Hailey just wanted her loser former husband to quickly disappear from Orlando.After a few more minutes, the cab that Jordan was in finally stopped.However, the car surprisingly stopped at the most luxurious five-star hotel in Orlando City, the Four Seasons Hotel at West Lake.However, Tyler and Hailey watched as Jordan alighted from the cab and entered the hotel.\u201cDamn it! That punk Jordan is here to apply for a job as a waiter!\u201dTyler was so furious that he slapped the steering wheel of the BMW.Hailey was infuriated. \u201cDuring the banquet just now, we clearly told everyone that we wanted to cut off his means of a livelihood, and yet, he\u2019s here for an interview. He clearly doesn\u2019t take the Camden family seriously!\u201dTyler said in exasperation, \u201cDoes this kid not believe in my abilities!?! Just you wait, I\u2019ll make a call.\u201dTyler took out his cell phone, scrolled through the contacts for a while before making a call.\u201cHey, Daniel, are you still working as a manager at West Lake Hotel? I have some instructions for you. A punk named Jordan Steele has gone to your hotel to apply for a job, don\u2019t accept him. That\u2019s all.\u201dAfter hanging up the phone, Tyler patted his chest and assured, \u201cI\u2019m done giving out instructions. That good-for-nothing Jordan will scramble out immediately.\u201dHailey praised happily, \u201cYou have such a wide network of connections. You know everyone.\u201dTyler said proudly, \u201cThey\u2019re just my underlings. They have to thank me for ordering them to do something.\u201dFive minutes later, Tyler decided to call the hotel manager again because Jordan hadn\u2019t come out yet.\u201cHey, Daniel, how is the matter I told you to handle? Why haven\u2019t you chased Jordan out yet? Call the security officers! Oh, if not, call the police!\u201dDaniel said on the other end of the phone, \u201cMr. Collins, no one has applied for a job at our hotel. I\u2019ve asked several colleagues, and they all said so.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Tyler was confused.If Jordan did not apply for a job at the West Lake Hotel, what would he go there for?\u201cSurely Jordan is not\u2026 checking into a room, right!?!\u201d Tyler\u2019s expression changed immediately.Hailey was also taken aback. \u201cImpossible! The West Lake Hotel charges at least 1,000 dollars a night, and I\u2019ve confiscated his bank cards. He only has a few hundred dollars in cash and about 2,000 mobile payment credits.\u201dTyler said, \u201cLet\u2019s go in and take a look.\u201dThe two of them alighted and walked to the lobby of the West Lake Hotel.\u201cHello Sir and Miss, do you need a place to stay?\u201d the attendant at the front desk asked with a smile.Tyler asked, \u201cDid a person named Jordan Steele check into a room here just now?\u201dThe attendant answered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this concerns the guest\u2019s privacy. We can\u2019t disclose it.\u201d\u201cDamn it.\u201d Tyler was so infuriated that he yelled in the lobby, \u201cDaniel! Daniel! Get your ass here!\u201dDaniel, the hotel lobby manager, walked over soon after.\u201cMr. Collins.\u201d Daniel greeted respectfully.Tyler said impatiently, \u201cFind out immediately if Jordan Steele is staying here!\u201dDaniel winked at the attendant, who then finally gave in. \u201cYes.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Has he secretly stashed away any money behind your back for the past three years?\u201dHailey shook her head and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2026 maybe he did.\u201dTyler pursed his lips and remarked, \u201cJordan is quite gutsy. I said that he can forget about staying in any hotel that\u2019s four stars and below, and yet, this guy paid so much to check into a five-star hotel!\u201dTyler thought Jordan was afraid of his power and hence, bore with the pinch and checked into a five-star hotel.Little did he know that Jordan had always only stayed in five-star hotels.Hailey asked, \u201cDo you have a way to make him unable to continue staying here?\u201dBeing put in a spot, Tyler said, \u201cThat\u2019s indeed a bit troublesome.\u201dThe owners of five-star hotels were all big bosses whom Tyler could not afford to provoke. Besides, reputation was important for five-star hotels.Despite his status and connections, Tyler would not be able to handle the consequences if the public ever found out that a guest of West Lake Hotel was chased out due to him.Feeling a little ashamed and guilty, Tyler whispered, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just let him stay here for one night? Even if he has a secret stash of savings, he can at most afford to stay for only one night.\u201dHailey was obviously a little displeased because just now, Tyler had confidently declared that he would make Jordan sleep on the streets, but now there was nothing he could do to Jordan.Seeing that Hailey was angry, Tyler got a little anxious and looked at the service staff.\u201cIs Jordan staying here for a night?\u201dThe front desk attendant had just finished processing Jordan\u2019s check-in administrative procedure. Hence, there was no need for him to check at all.He simply answered, \u201cMr. Jordan has paid for a seven-night stay.\u201d\u201cSeven nights?\u201d Tyler was a bit surprised. \u201cThis punk is pretty relentless. Each night costs about 1,000 dollars, and seven nights would cost 7,000 dollars. Hailey, he has saved quite a lot of money in his secret stash!\u201dHailey was so furious that she stomped her feet and exclaimed in disgruntlement, \u201cHe must have siphoned some of the money that was going to be spent on groceries, dog food, and daily necessities. He\u2019s so greedy!\u201dThe Camden family was a second-rate wealthy family in Orlando with high living expenses. Jordan was usually the one who did the shopping.It wasn\u2019t impossible for him to take a few thousand dollars from the money that was meant to be spent on daily expenses.However, at this moment, the front desk attendant said, \u201cUm\u2026 Mr. Jordan did not check into an ordinary room but a presidential suite.\u201d\u201cWhat!?!\u201dTyler and Hailey were so frightened that they were about to leap up!\u2018Presidential suite?\u2019\u2018He\u2019s going to stay in it for a week?\u2019\u2018The presidential suite of the West Lake Hotel costs 10,000 dollars a night!\u2019\u2018The cost for a week is 70,000 dollars!\u2019\u201c70,000 dollars! Did Jordan just pay 70,000 dollars?\u201d Tyler asked the attendant, looking at her in horror.The beautiful female attendant nodded and said shyly, \u201cYes, he even gave me a 1,000 dollars tip\u2026\u201dUpon hearing her words and seeing how beautiful the front desk attendant was, Hailey suddenly felt jealous.She rebuked furiously, \u201cWho said you could take his tip!?! That\u2019s my family\u2019s money!\u201dTyler didn\u2019t want Hailey to cause a scene in the five-star hotel, so he pulled her aside and said,\u201cHailey, don\u2019t bother about the tip for now. Where did he get so much money? It\u2019s impossible to get 70,000 dollars by pocketing some of the money meant for daily necessities and groceries for the past three years.\u201dAfter thinking about it, Hailey felt that he made sense. Although the Camden family had given him monthly allowances, they wouldn\u2019t add up to that much after three years.Hailey suddenly thought of something as she pondered. In a concerned tone, she asked, \u201cHe used to go to my grandmother\u2019s place often and take care of her dog. She has many antiques at home. Could he have stolen one or two and sold them?\u201dTyler knew how powerful Old Mrs. Camden was and was aware that she would receive many expensive gifts on her birthday each year.Those gifts were enough to form a massive pile at home.Jordan just needed to steal one or two pieces, and he could sell them for a hundred grand or two.Tyler exclaimed, \u201cThis must be the case, quickly inform your family and ask them to check if something is missing!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHailey frantically picked up her phone and called her mother, Sylvie.\u2026At this time, in the Marriott Hotel.Jordan and Hailey had been away for over forty minutes, and the guests at the birthday banquet were all full and had drunk to their hearts\u2019 content.Usually, the busy bosses would have long gone back to their companies to make money.However, today, none of them were eager to leave.They were all waiting for one person, and that was the mysterious person who had sent a one million dollars jadeite bracelet, also known as Elle\u2019s suitor.With an ominous hunch, Victoria asked, \u201cIt\u2019s been so long, but the person who gave the gift still isn\u2019t here yet. NO matter how heavy traffic is on East Central Boulevard, he should have arrived by now.\u201d\u201cCould it be that the bracelet is really from Jordan?\u201dWhen she thought of this, Victoria broke into a cold sweat. \u2018Surely I didn\u2019t accidentally offend a big shot, did I?\u2019At this moment, Sylvie\u2019s phone suddenly rang.\u201cHailey, how is it going? You\u2019re done divorcing that loser, huh?\u201d Sylvie asked with a smile.Hailey said, \u201cMom, hurry and go to grandma\u2019s house and see which of grandma\u2019s antique calligraphy paintings are missing. That scoundrel from the Steele family has stolen something from our family and sold it!\u201dSylvie was astonished. \u201cWhat? Jordan, that good-for-nothing stole your grandma\u2019s antique calligraphy painting?\u201dHearing Sylvie\u2019s words, Victoria felt much more relaxed. With a slim lady cigarette between her alluring red lips, Victoria said, \u201cI thought it would be some big shot, but it turns out to be just a thief.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why did you discover that he had stolen from us only after the divorce?\u201dJordan and Hailey had a prenuptial agreement to keep their property separate before they married. In the event of a divorce, Jordan would not be entitled to a single cent of the Camdens\u2019 assets.Hailey indicated that she would take away all the money Jordan earned from delivering takeout in the divorce agreement.Sylvie answered, \u201cHailey said that Jordan had spent almost 70,000 dollars on a one-week stay in the presidential suite of the West Lake Hotel. So she guessed that he had stolen from you.\u201dOld Mrs. Camden was a little panicked too. In the past three years, she often asked Jordan to go to her villa and play with her beloved poodle because it liked Jordan very much.Jordan definitely had the opportunity to steal things in her villa!Old Mrs. Camden hurriedly said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the villa immediately!\u201dHowever, Elle pulled Old Mrs. Camden to stop her. \u201cGrandma, don\u2019t be in such a hurry to leave. My suitor might be here soon!\u201dThe little girl with a gorgeous figure was still fantasizing and imagining that the jadeite bracelet was given by her suitor.After thinking about it, Old Mrs. Camden said, \u201cDrew, Benedict, Sylvie, you guys go to my villa and check what\u2019s missing. Herman, Susan, Elle, you guys stay here with me and wait a little longer.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dDrew quickly drove Benedict and Sylvie back to the villa.Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s valuables were kept in two rooms in the basement, one of which was filled with accessories, liquor, and watches, while the other was filled with antique paintings and calligraphy.Although she had lots of items, there were detailed records for each one of them.Upon arriving in the basement, Drew said, \u201cUncle, let\u2019s split up to check. You guys check the room with the antiques and calligraphic paintings while I check this one.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Holding onto the notebook, Benedict and Sylvie went to the room where the antiques and calligraphy paintings were placed and checked everything according to the records.Likewise, Drew also checked the room that he was in according to the list on the notebook.Twenty minutes later, Drew completed his check and discovered that nothing had gone missing.At this point, Benedict was already done.He walked over and asked, \u201cDrew, nothing is missing from the room we checked. How about you?\u201dDrew froze in shock for a moment because nothing was missing from the room where the antiques and calligraphic paintings were placed.That proved that no valuables were missing from Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s villa!In other words, Jordan stole nothing from the Camdens.Thinking about how he had been beaten up by Jordan twice in a row, Drew felt indignant and wasn\u2019t willing to prove Jordan innocent just like that.Besides, he had also been short of money recently, so he could take the opportunity to make some extra money.Drew said, \u201cOh, I haven\u2019t finished checking. You guys better check again, lest you miss something out.\u201dBenedict nodded and said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go check again then.\u201dWatching Benedict walk out of the room, Drew smiled.He closed the door of the room and then quietly grabbed a Richard Mille watch.\u201cThis is the watch Grandpa used to wear when he was alive.\u201dThere were only 48 pieces of this watch in the entire world, and each one was worth over 800,000 dollars!\u201cJordan, from now on, you will become the thief who stole this watch, hehehe.\u201dDrew put the Richard Mille watch into the pocket of his clothes.Two minutes later, Drew hurriedly ran to the room where Benedict and Sylvie were in and frantically exclaimed,\u201cThere\u2019s a watch missing from the room I checked!\u201dBenedict and Sylvie rushed over and checked, only to realize there was indeed an 800,000 dollars watch missing!Sylvie barked furiously, \u201cNo wonder that good-for-nothing Jordan could afford to stay in the presidential suite of West Lake Hotel. That beast!\u201dAt this point, Benedict had already called Old Mrs. Camden on the phone. \u201cMom, we found out that the Richard Mille watch Father used to wear when he was alive has gone missing!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden was so furious that she almost died. \u201cBring him back to me!

He had already been beaten twice today, and if he got beaten up a third time, he would be disfigured.Benedict was Jordan\u2019s former father-in-law, but now they were no longer related to each other. Hence, he was afraid that Jordan might turn his back on them and hit him too.Benedict was different from Herman. He didn\u2019t know any mafia members.Hence, he picked up his phone and called his daughter Hailey. \u201cHailey, are you still at West Lake Hotel?\u201dHailey answered, \u201cYes, Dad. I am.\u201dBenedict said, \u201cI\u2019m at your grandma\u2019s place, and we\u2019ve discovered that a Richard Mille watch that\u2019s worth over 800,000 dollars has gone missing.

It\u2019s no wonder he has the money to stay in the presidential suite of a five-star hotel!\u201dBenedict said, \u201cHailey, your grandmother is furious, and she wants you to bring Jordan back. I won\u2019t go over. I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d\u2026West Lake Hotel.Hailey hung up the phone and exclaimed indignantly, \u201cGreat, Jordan, how dare you steal from Grandma? Watch how I deal with you!?!\u201dHailey walked towards the front desk and asked, \u201cWhich room is Jordan Steele staying in?\u201dSeeing this, Tyler hurriedly walked up to her and asked, \u201cHailey, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cWhat am I doing? I\u2019m going to bring him back, of course. He has stolen my grandfather\u2019s watch, which is worth over 800,000 dollars!\u201d Hailey exclaimed.Tyler knew that Jordan definitely wouldn\u2019t just comply, and the both of them would definitely argue when the time comes.They were in a five-star hotel, and his family was in the hotel business in the first place. What he hated most was people who created trouble in hotels.Besides, Tyler couldn\u2019t afford to provoke the owner of the West Lake Hotel.Tyler grabbed Hailey\u2019s arm and said, \u201cDon\u2019t go, just call the cops.\u201dHailey shook him off and refuted, \u201cWhy are you such a coward? If you\u2019re too scared to go, I\u2019ll go by myself!\u201dAfter finding out Jordan\u2019s room number, Hailey boarded the elevator and headed to the presidential suite where Jordan was.Dong-Dong-Dong!Hailey could not be bothered to ring the doorbell, and she simply pounded the door with her tender fists.\u201cJordan, you thief! Open the door right now!\u201dAt this juncture, Jordan had just finished taking a shower and was blow-drying his hair. When he heard the knock on the door, he turned off the blow-dryer and vaguely heard Hailey\u2019s voice again.\u201cWhy is this woman still pestering me?! She came looking for me again even though we just got divorced!\u201dJordan put down the hairdryer and walked over to open the door.As soon as he did, Hailey was greeted with the sight of Jordan dressed in a bathrobe, his voluminous hair combed behind him. It was still damp, and his current hairstyle made him look much more handsome than he was when he had bangs. He also looked more domineering.Jordan\u2019s bathrobe was not appropriately worn, and the muscles of his upper body were clearly visible.\u201cJordan actually has abs\u2026\u201dHailey Camden had always liked men with abs, and despite having been married to Jordan for three years, she never knew that he had such a perfect figure!\u201cHad I known earlier, I would have made him stay topless at home during summer.\u201dHailey felt a little regretful. In her opinion, Jordan was poor, but he was handsome, and if he had abs too, he would make good eye candy.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Jordan asked coldly.Hailey stopped gazing at Jordan\u2019s body, and she questioned furiously, \u201cJordan, did you steal the Richard Mille watch from my grandma\u2019s house?\u201d\u201cWhat Richard Mille watch?\u201d Jordan was puzzled.Hailey snapped, \u201cYou\u2019re still pretending, huh!?! There\u2019s a watch that\u2019s worth over 800 thousand dollars, missing from Grandma\u2019s home! You must have taken it. Otherwise, how could you have the money to stay in the presidential suite of a five-star hotel? Even I have never stayed in a presidential suite before!\u201dJordan couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter, amused by the Camdens\u2019 ridiculousness. They would never offer him any benefits and only go to him whenever it was time to take the rap.Jordan said, \u201cMiss Camden, I never took a single thing from your family, nor have I stolen any watch. Please leave.\u201dHearing Jordan call her Miss Camden, Hailey\u2019s heart was filled with sorrow!For the past three years, he had called her \u201cHailey\u201d affectionately. He would sometimes even address her with terms of endearment like \u201cBaby,\u201d \u201cDearest Wife,\u201d or \u201cGoddess.\u201dYet, Jordan now called her Miss Camden.Feeling aggrieved, Hailey Camden accused sobbingly, \u201cJordan, you\u2019re so heartless! Why are you in such a hurry to chase me away? Is there a woman in your room?\u201dOf course, there was no woman in Jordan\u2019s room. He wasn\u2019t such an easy man.However, Jordan said, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business regardless of whether there\u2019s a woman or not. We\u2019re already divorced.\u201dHailey Camden was so exasperated that she pointed at Jordan and snapped, \u201cWe\u2019ve only been divorced for less than an hour, and you\u2019ve already hooked up with another woman! You\u2019re using the Camdens\u2019 money too! You\u2019ve really let me down!\u201dJordan guffawed. \u201cHah, so you\u2019re allowed to cheat on me while we were still married, but it\u2019s not okay for me to be with another woman after we got a divorce? Who\u2019s the unfaithful one!?!\u201dHailey was speechless. She stopped talking and barged straight in, intending to find the woman and give her a tight slap.However, Jordan did not let Hailey step into the room at all.Jordan said, \u201cMiss Camden, you\u2019re not worthy of stepping foot inside the presidential suite of a five-star hotel. If you refuse to leave, I\u2019ll call security.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then we will consider this matter settled.\u201d\u201cSince you don\u2019t cherish this opportunity, I\u2019ll call the cops and let them deal with it! Don\u2019t blame me for not reminding you. Stealing something worth over 800,000 dollars will warrant a jail term of 15 years and above!\u201d\u201cIf you kneel down in front of me now\u2026\u201dBang!Before Hailey could finish, Jordan simply closed the door of the room.\u201cHmph, she makes me kneel down and apologize to her all the time, just because she knows that I like her. I\u2019ve really overindulged her and spoiled her rotten the past three years. Why do I have to stoop so low just because I fancy her!?\u201dJordan stopped thinking about her and continued to blow-dry his hair.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dHailey Camden stomped her feet furiously as she called the police, after which she yelled at the door of the presidential suite, \u201cI\u2019ve called the cops, just wait, you\u2019ll be behind bars!\u201dSoon, the Camdens had also found out that Hailey had called the police.Old Mrs. Camden barked in displeasure, \u201cWhat? Hailey called the police? Who told her to call the police? I want to handle our family affairs myself, not let someone else do it!\u201dSylvie knew that Old Mrs. Camden had always liked to handle everything herself.Afraid that she would hold it against Hailey, she hurriedly said, \u201cMom, Hailey must have called the cops on Jordan because he wouldn\u2019t cooperate.\u201dOld Mrs. Camden sighed and said, \u201cForget it, maybe Jordan is destined to spend the rest of his life in prison.\u201dThe Camdens were all confident the law would definitely sentence Jordan.\u2026Ten minutes later, two uniformed police officers arrived at West Lake Hotel.Tyler and Hailey, who were waiting in the lobby, immediately walked up to the police officers when they saw them.\u201cSirs, I was the one who called the police.\u201dOne of the police officers asked, \u201cYou must be Miss Hailey Camden, right? You said that Jordan Steele has stolen a watch that\u2019s worth over 800,000 dollars from your family, is that right?\u201dHailey nodded and said, \u201cYes, Jordan Steele was a live-in son-in-law, and we just got divorced. He stole our watch and sold it for money which he spent on a one-week stay in the presidential suite of this hotel. He even hired a prostitute!\u201d\u201cSirs, please quickly arrest him!\u201dThe police officer went to the front desk and said, \u201cCall Jordan Steele and tell him to come down.\u201dThe front desk attendant called the phone set in Jordan\u2019s room, but Jordan had just fallen asleep after taking a shower and didn\u2019t hear the phone ringing.Hailey tried to call Jordan\u2019s cell phone, but there was no response either.Hailey said, \u201cHe must be too scared to answer because he\u2019s guilty of theft!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s head upstairs to take a look then,\u201d said a police officer.The two police officers took the elevator up on their own while Hailey waited downstairs with Tyler because he didn\u2019t want to cause trouble.Bang! Bang!Bang! Bang!The police knocked on the door several times before Jordan woke up from his sleep and got up to open the door.\u201cIs this Mr. Jordan Steele? May we enter?\u201d the police officer asked.Jordan knew it was Hailey who had called the police and thus said with a smile, \u201cYes, please come in.\u201dA bespectacled police officer took the initiative to introduce himself, \u201cI am Chief Lee of the district police station. We received a police report from Miss Hailey Camden. She claimed you stole a watch that\u2019s worth over 800,000 dollars from her family yesterday. Is there such a thing?\u201dJordan answered truthfully, \u201cI didn\u2019t take anything from the Camdens.\u201dChief Lee continued, \u201cPardon me for being presumptuous, but I heard that you were previously the Camdens\u2019 live-in son-in-law, and you don\u2019t have much money. For the past six months, you\u2019ve been working as a takeout deliverer. Miss Camden said you didn\u2019t get a single cent of the Camdens after your divorce\u2026\u201dAt this juncture, Chief Lee, who was also a man, took pity on Jordan.\u2018The Camdens are too stingy. They have at least millions worth of assets. They can at least give him a few tens of thousands of dollars.\u201dChief Lee said, \u201cLook, there\u2019s a swimming pool, a television, and several couches in this presidential suite. There\u2019s also a beautiful view. I heard it costs over 10,000 dollars a night. Yet, you booked it for a night.\u201d\u201cSince you didn\u2019t take the watch, where did you get the money from?\u201dJordan did not answer directly but got up and went to the desk in the room to grab a contract that he then handed to the police officer.\u201cChief Lee, this is the equity transfer contract of Ace Corporation. I\u2019m now the largest shareholder and the newly appointed CEO of Ace Corporation. This is my business card!\u201dJordan handed the CEO business card of Ace Corporation to Chief Lee!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The diamonds used in a single set of business cards probably exceeded 30 carats!Simply put, each business card was worth 1,500 dollars!Besides, business cards were definitely printed in sets. Ace Corporation had specially customized a set of business cards for Jordan, which cost almost as much as a house in a third-tier city!Chief Lee took the business card and was instantly shocked to see the dazzling diamonds on the card.Jordan\u2019s name was indeed stated on the business card!Chief Lee looked at the contract again and confirmed that the shares that used to belong to the former president of the Ace Corporation had indeed been transferred to Jordan.However, the police officer beside him asked, \u201cChief, could it be a fabricated contract?\u201dIt was normal for contracts and business cards to be fabricated. Having been police officers for so many years, they had already gotten used to seeing it.Chief Lee said, \u201cCan we find your information on Heaven\u2019s Eye?\u201dHeaven\u2019s Eye was a business query tool that included the information of 200 million social entities nationwide, and data like corporate backgrounds and the information of business owners could be found on it.Jordan smiled and said, \u201cThe founder of Heaven\u2019s Eye is Dr. Alex Murphy, who is my second brother\u2019s former classmate in college. Due to the fact that I haven\u2019t officially taken over the position yet, I asked him to hide my information because I don\u2019t want others to look up information about me before I do.\u201d\u201cSince you guys believe the data in Heaven\u2019s Eye, I\u2019ll ask him to help me reveal it for a while.\u201dAfter Jordan finished speaking, he picked up his phone and dialed a number.\u201cDr. Murphy, how are you doing lately? Well, a police officer in Orlando would like to see my data in Heaven\u2019s Eye. Can you unhide my data for ten minutes?\u201dAfter chatting with Dr. Murphy, Jordan entertained the police officer and had a cup of tea with them.After just one minute, Jordan received a text, and he then said to Chief Lee,\u201cYou can check Heaven\u2019s Eye now.\u201dInputting Ace Corporation into the search bar of the \u201cHeaven\u2019s Eye\u201d app, Chief Lee saw Jordan\u2019s name in the personnel section of the company immediately!\u201cJordan Steele, CEO of Ace Corporation!\u201dNot only was Jordan\u2019s name on it, but his profile photo was on it too. The person in the photo was exactly the same as the person standing before them!However, the police officer next to Chief Lee still had his guard up. \u201cCould it have been done by a hacker?\u201dThere were many hackers on the Internet, and one could hack into an app and tamper with the information on it.Jordan smiled and said, \u201cI initially didn\u2019t want to flaunt my wealth, but since you guys still don\u2019t believe me, I\u2019ll have to do this.\u201dJordan opened the text message interface on his cell phone and handed it to Chief Lee.Chief Lee took the cell phone and saw that it was a transaction alert from a bank.\u201cAmount: 90,000 dollarsDate: April 20, 14:22Account Number: *6582Type: Quick Payment WithdrawalRemaining Balance: 1,553,494,532 dollars\u201dWhen Chief Lee and the police officer beside him saw the long string of numbers, they were dumbfounded!\u201cYou have\u2026 more than a billion dollars!\u201dThe two counted for a long time before figuring it out.The bank card was given to Jordan by Butler Frank yesterday because Jordan and Hailey had signed a prenuptial agreement to keep their assets and property separate.Hence, Hailey Camden had no right to inquire about the real assets that belonged to Jordan during the divorce.Jordan looked at the stunned police officers and said, \u201cSirs, this is only one of my cards, but I fear the amount in it alone is more than the total value of all the Camdens\u2019 assets combined.\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019d steal a watch that\u2019s worth merely over 800,000 dollars?\u201dOnly then did the two people stop doubting Jordan. They had heard of the Camdens before and knew that they were just a second-rate family whose net worth was just over millions of dollars.Yet, Jordan had more than a billion dollars in just a single card alone!Since he was so rich, there was no need for him to steal from the Camdens!Chief Lee asked curiously, \u201cMr. Steele, you should be the noble heir of a wealthy family, right? So why were you willing to be a live-in son-in-law of the Camdens?\u201dJordan answered helplessly, \u201cIt was arranged by my family, so I had no choice but to obey. I hope that you two can keep it a secret for me, especially from the Camdens. I don\u2019t want to have any other involvement with them anymore.\u201dChief Lee nodded frantically, \u201cRest assured, Mr. Steele, this matter concerns your privacy. We won\u2019t disclose it to others.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have disturbed your rest. We should go now.\u201dJordan also got up to see them off. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, take care.\u201dTwo minutes later, the two police officers came down to the hotel lobby from upstairs.Hailey and Tyler Collins immediately walked over.Tyler Collins was puzzled to see that Jordan had not come down to the lobby with them.He asked, \u201cSirs, why didn\u2019t Jordan Steele come down with you? Did he resist arrest? Send more men with guns and teach this punk a hard lesson!\u201dChief Lee glared at Tyler Collins and warned, \u201cMind your language! If you hurl any vulgarities again, I\u2019ll take you back to the police station!\u201dAfterward, Chief Lee looked at Hailey and said, \u201cMr. Jordan said he didn\u2019t take any watch belonging to the Camdens. So I think you\u2019d better go home to check again and see if you\u2019ve left it somewhere.\u201dHailey protested, \u201cHow can you believe what he said!?! If he didn\u2019t steal anything from our family, how did he get the money to stay in a five-star hotel? He\u2019s just a pauper who delivers takeout!\u201d\u2018Pauper?\u2019Hearing Hailey\u2019s description of Jordan, the two police officers were speechless\u2026\u2018Is there a pauper in this world who\u2019s worth billions of dollars?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, the two of you used to be a married couple, and those words are just too hurtful.\u201dHailey Camden snorted coldly, \u201cI\u2019m not wrong. If he was a little more competent, I wouldn\u2019t have divorced him!\u201d\u201cYou were the one who initiated a divorce with Jordan\u2026 Mr. Steele?\u201dStill looking incredibly smug, Hailey answered, \u201cYeah, I initiated the divorce! Has he already regretted it?\u201dThe police officer didn\u2019t dare to reveal Jordan\u2019s true identity and hence had no choice but to smile and give Hailey a thumbs-up.Deep down, he thought, \u2018You should be the one regretting your decision to divorce the CEO of Ace Corporation, who has a net worth of billions of dollars!\u2019Seeing that the two police officers were leaving, Hailey asked again, \u201cUm\u2026 was there a woman in his room?\u201dChief Lee shook his head and said, \u201cMr. Steele is staying alone in the room. There wasn\u2019t anyone else.\u201dHailey was in a much better mood, and she muttered softly, \u201cI knew it. He still loves me.\u201dSeeing that the arrogant Hailey still didn\u2019t know the huge mistake she had created, Chief Lee sighed and left.After the two left, Tyler asked in bewilderment, \u201cWhy did they become so polite to Jordan after coming downstairs?\u201dHailey didn\u2019t pay attention to these details and simply said, \u201cI need to hurry up and call my mom to tell them to collect evidence!\u201dAs soon as Hailey took out her cell phone, she received a call from Drew before calling Sylvie.\u201cHello, Drew.\u201dHailey rarely received phone calls from Drew. Still, they had recently started contacting each other rather frequently, probably because of Jordan.Pretending to be affectionate, Drew asked, \u201cHailey, how are things on your side? I heard you called the police. Did they not take him to the police station?\u201dHailey replied truthfully, \u201cNo, the police officers said that they couldn\u2019t arrest him because there wasn\u2019t any evidence.\u201d\u201cEvidence? What kind of evidence do they want?\u201d Drew asked.Hailey answered, \u201cEvidence for the theft of his watch or a receipt of the sale of the watch.\u201dDrew thought about it for a while and felt that it was impossible for there to be any evidence of Jordan stealing the watch because he wasn\u2019t the culprit to begin with.However, now that the watch was in Drew\u2019s hands, he could just fabricate evidence against Jordan to accuse him of selling the watch!Drew said, \u201cLeave this matter to me. I\u2019ll find out who he sold the watch to. Then, rest assured, I\u2019ll put him behind bars!\u201dAfter hanging up, Hailey panicked and continuously ruffled and fiddled with her hair.She wanted to punish Jordan so that he would treat her like a queen again and spoil her like he used to. On the other hand, she wanted Jordan to obey her without getting mad at her or contradicting her.On the other hand, she didn\u2019t really want Jordan to be sentenced by the law.After all, after three years of living together as husband and wife, how could Hailey bear to let Jordan spend ten years in prison?Tyler, beside Hailey, drooled continuously when he saw her ruffling her hair, which he thought was really sexy.He grabbed Hailey\u2019s hand and said, \u201cHoney, let\u2019s stay at West Lake tonight too, shall we?\u201dHailey shrugged his hand away to Tyler\u2019s surprise and then gave him a slap on his face.Smack!Hailey snapped, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even handle Jordan, and you have the cheek to sleep with me!?!\u201dAfter saying that, Hailey stormed off in a rage.Being slapped in the hotel lobby was quite an embarrassing thing.Covering his face, Tyler thought to himself, \u201cJordan Steele, you made things hard for me today. But, once you come outside, I won\u2019t let you off!\u201dHe walked towards the hotel manager, who had been watching from the side, and grabbed him by the collar.He ordered, \u201cOnce Jordan Steele leaves the hotel, inform me immediately!\u201d\u2026It was six in the morning.Jordan changed into a suit, put on a tie, and a pair of leather shoes. He then waxed his hair and styled it into a side pompadour, making him look suave and very much like the company\u2019s CEO.That was Jordan\u2019s first time donning a suit in the past three years.He reckoned that even Hailey wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize him for a few seconds after she sees him.The front desk attendants were all stunned when he came down from upstairs.\u201cHe\u2019s such a domineering CEO\u2026 His aura differs completely from when he checked in yesterday!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in love! I wonder who is so lucky to be his wife!\u201dThe two front desk attendants were gushing and swooning over Jordan when the hotel manager, John, immediately walked over and rebuked, \u201cYou guys are so man-crazy! Pay attention to your image!\u201dAfterward, John walked out of the lobby and called Tyler. \u201cJordan Steele has gone out.\u201dTyler had arranged for some people to stay outside the hotel, and they immediately started tailing Jordan.Jordan hailed a cab and arrived at the office tower of Ace Corporation in the central business district twenty minutes later.It was his official first day at work as the CEO.Jordan alighted from the car and looked up at the majestic tower with a smile on his face.\u201cVictoria Clarke, you swore to cut off all means of a livelihood for me yesterday.

The latter could charm all the men in the upper-class circle of Orlando!He walked to the lobby on the first floor of the building, where there was a security gantry.Orlando was a developed city with cutting-edge technology. A gantry on the first floor, for example, can already be accessed via fingerprint and face recognition.However, since it was Jordan\u2019s first day at work, he had yet to register his fingerprint and face into the security system.Hence, Jordan took out the card that Butler Frank had given to him and swiped it to get past the gantry to board the elevator.When he arrived on the floor of the president\u2019s office of Ace Corporation, there was no one in the office yet. So Jordan unlocked the door with the key and entered his personal office to read some documents.\u2026At the same time, the people whom Tyler had sent to tail Jordan also reported to him.\u201cMr. Collins, Jordan Steele has entered the Ace Corporation\u2019s office tower in the central business district.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAt this moment, Tyler was still lying in bed and was puzzled to hear that Jordan had gone to the Ace Corporation.\u201cWhat is Jordan Steele there for? Miss Clarke, the deputy president of Ace Corporation, said she would make sure Jordan never gets to live in this city in the future. Could Jordan be there to take revenge on Miss Clarke?\u201dTyler asked for Victoria\u2019s number at Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s birthday banquet yesterday. As a man, he was also wildly attracted to Victoria!He would be willing to lose ten years of his lifespan in exchange for a chance to make love to Victoria once on a large bed!Unfortunately, he knew that, given Victoria\u2019s standards, she would never take a liking to him.Tyler dialed Victoria\u2019s phone number.The phone rang several times before Victoria answered in a weary voice, \u201cWho\u2019s speaking?\u201dTyler smiled and said, \u201cMiss Clarke, this is Tyler. I toasted to you at Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s birthday banquet last night.\u201dVictoria assented and asked, \u201cMr. Collins, is there a reason you\u2019re calling at such a late hour?\u201dTyler answered anxiously, \u201cMiss Clarke, you still remember Jordan Steele, the son-in-law of the Camdens, don\u2019t you? Yesterday, we stood in solidarity with the Camdens. We vowed to ensure that Jordan Steele will never be able to make a living in this city from now on. That punk went to your company early in the morning today. I\u2019m guessing that he\u2019s trying to take revenge on you!\u201dVictoria chuckled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the building is locked and guarded by security officers. He won\u2019t be able to go upstairs.\u201dTyler exclaimed, \u201cThe people I sent to keep tabs on him informed me that that punk has a card in his hand that gave him access through the gantries to go upstairs! He might be hiding in your office right now. Could your life be in danger if you go up?\u201d\u201cWhat? How could he have our company\u2019s access card?\u201dVictoria sat up in surprise, and the quilt covering her body dropped too, revealing her spotless and beautiful shoulders and arms.If a man had seen that scene, he would definitely get a nosebleed.Tyler explained, \u201cThat punk stole a watch from the Camdens and sold it for over 800,000 dollars. He\u2019s rich now. There are so many employees in your company, he could have paid them some money to get a card. There\u2019s nothing strange about that.\u201d\u201cMiss Clarke, I\u2019m worried about you. You\u2019re so beautiful. It\u2019d be such a shame if you get slashed by that punk!\u201dVictoria also got worried, and she said, \u201cThank you for the reminder. I\u2019ll send someone to the company to take a look immediately.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll go help you out at the office too. Miss Clarke\u2026\u201dTyler took this opportunity to suck up to her.Hearing how deferential he was, Victoria smiled without saying anything.Afterward, Victoria immediately called her personal secretary, Ashley Rose.\u201cAshley, go to the office immediately and check if there are any suspicious persons. If there are, call the police at once!\u201d\u2026Half an hour later\u2026A woman dressed in a white shirt, black silk skirt, and black-framed glasses hurried to the office building of Ace Corporation.\u201cGood morning, Miss Rose.\u201dThe security officer who was on duty widened his eyes when he saw Ashley Rose.Although Ashley Rose was inferior to Victoria in all aspects, the latter was too far away in terms of status in the eyes of the security officers.On the contrary, Ashley Rose was the person whom the security officers of the building often fantasized about.Besides, Ashley Rose was a secretary and was often dressed in a business suit that made her seem like a flight attendant, leaving a lot to their imagination and fantasies.\u201cMorning.\u201dAshley Rose answered perfunctorily and hurried upstairs.Having finally arrived at the floor where Jordan was, Ashley Rose found that the door had surprisingly been unlocked by someone.She thought it was her colleague, but after calling out twice, no one answered.All of a sudden, she discovered that there was someone in the president\u2019s office!\u201cHe must be the suspicious person that Miss Clarke mentioned, right?\u201dAshley Rose immediately pushed the door and questioned, \u201cWho are you? How did you get in?

She had a long list of suitors too.However, no one had ever heard of her having a boyfriend.\u2018Maybe Victoria Clarke is into women!\u2019\u201cHey, what are you thinking about!?! Hurry up and answer me. Why are you here at our office!?!\u201dAshley said in a firm voice.Jordan snapped back to his senses and said, \u201cI\u2019m Jordan Steele, the new president of Ace Corporation.\u201dAshley Rose\u2019s jaw dropped, and her mouth was so wide open that it could fit an egg.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry! I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Steele! I\u2019m too stupid. Since you had the key to the door, you must be the president! But, please forgive me, Miss Clarke said that there\u2019s a suspicious person in the office, so I\u2026\u201dJordan was surprised after hearing her explanation.\u2018Suspicious person?\u2019\u201cDamn, the Camdens have been tailing me! Annoying pests who won\u2019t leave me alone!\u201dJordan immediately figured out what was going on.\u201cOkay, you may go out and resume your duties. Oh, by the way, I heard that Miss Clarke is the most beautiful deputy president in the city. So when she arrives, tell her to come to my office immediately. I\u2019d like to see how beautiful the deputy president of our company really is.\u201dJordan instructed Ashley.\u201cYes!\u201dAshley walked out of the president\u2019s office, went to the restroom on the same floor, and called Victoria Clarke.\u201cMiss Clarke.\u201dVictoria was already on her way to work when she spoke with Ashley Rose over the phone via the Bluetooth function in her Porsche.\u201cAshley, how is it? Have you found out clearly? Are there any suspicious people in the office?\u201dAshley whispered, \u201cI have, and there are no suspicious people, but there\u2019s someone you\u2019ve wanted to meet!\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Victoria asked curiously.Ashley was Victoria\u2019s trusted confidante whom Victoria would talk to about everything under the sun in private.Ashley exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Steele! The new president of our company! He\u2019s already arrived at our office, and he says that he wants to meet you!\u201d\u201cWhat? Mr. Steele is at the office!?!\u201dVictoria was so flustered that she almost rear-ended a Land Rover.She had been looking forward to seeing the new president for a long time!Hence, Victoria stepped hard on the gas pedal, and the speed of the car instantly increased to 100 kilometers per hour. She even constantly overtook several vehicles, all for the sake of meeting Mr. Steele sooner!Ten minutes later, Victoria arrived at the lobby on the first floor of the office building.\u201cMiss Clarke!\u201dTyler, who had arrived earlier, immediately called out to Victoria when he saw her.\u201cMr. Collins?\u201d Victoria immediately recognized him.Tyler walked up and asked with concern, \u201cMiss Clarke, I was afraid that punk Jordan would hurt you, so I rushed over here to help you out. Let me go upstairs with you!\u201dVictoria had dinner with Tyler\u2019s father once. But, in her opinion, Tyler was her junior and wasn\u2019t qualified to hang out with her.Hence, she declined, \u201cNo need for that. I\u2019ve already checked and found out that there\u2019s no suspicious person in the office. I have something urgent to handle. I\u2019ll head upstairs first.\u201d\u201cHey\u2026 Don\u2019t go, Miss Clarke, believe me, Jordan Steele is really upstairs!\u201d Tyler exclaimed.However, Victoria ignored him and quickly took the elevator to go upstairs.As soon as the elevator doors were opened, she saw Ashley chatting about something with a few other female employees.\u201cMiss Clarke, you\u2019re here!\u201d Ashley exclaimed with excitement written all over her face.Victoria nodded and glanced at the supervisor of the investment department and an intern who was beside Ashley.She asked, \u201cWhy are you guys here too?\u201dThe supervisor and the intern were both female and were equally excited. \u201cAshley told us just now that the newly appointed president of our company has arrived and he\u2019s really handsome! So we rushed over without even putting on any makeup!\u201dThe two of them lived in a rented apartment that was within walking distance to the office.Victoria asked in surprise, \u201cOh? How handsome is he?\u201dAshley answered excitedly, \u201cHe\u2019s more handsome than a celebrity, and he\u2019s really young too. He seems to be about 23 years old!\u201d\u201cSo young?\u201dVictoria was a little surprised. She was already 32 years old and yet, he was so much younger\u2026Ashley flailed her hands about with great excitement. \u201cHe must be the heir of a really wealthy family! Otherwise, how could he have suddenly been appointed as the president? His future girlfriend is going to be really lucky!\u201dVictoria glared at the three of them and chided, \u201cYou three are man-crazy. Don\u2019t harbor designs on Mr. Steele!\u201dAshley said, \u201cWe\u2019re not worthy of Mr. Steele. He\u2019s such a domineering president. Only you can be compatible with him, Miss Clarke. By the way, Miss Clarke, Mr. Steele wants you to go to his office as soon as you arrive.\u201dThe supervisor of the investment department said, \u201cYes, I heard Ashley say that Mr. Steele complimented you on being the most beautiful deputy president in the city. He might have come early in the morning just to see you earlier!\u201dHearing their words, Victoria smiled.She didn\u2019t want to act like a man-crazy woman like the three of them.Hence, she ruffled her hair and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been part of the business circle of Orlando for so many years. There\u2019s no man that I, Victoria Clarke, can\u2019t subdue!\u201d\u201cThe domineering president in your eyes is just a lowly bootlicker to me!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s just a 23-year-old boy! Come with me and see how I can make him succumb to me within three minutes!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I must learn how to subdue a domineering president like Miss Clarke has this time!\u201dThe other two girls were also excited to watch the excellent show that was about to come on. They wanted to witness with their own eyes how the domineering president was reduced to a bootlicking dog!Victoria first went to the bathroom, where she looked in the mirror to fix her makeup and then tidied up her outfit.She was clad in a pink Chanel Haute Couture two-piece set today which made her look very much like an imposing president, accentuating her noble and elegant aura.Any overbearing president would instantly be attracted to her. They would also notice that she was different from other female influencers and Instagram models.Victoria said, \u201cAfter I go in later, I\u2019ll leave the door slightly ajar so that you guys can watch through the crack, just how I subdue this greenhorn!\u201dAshley guffawed loudly and said, \u201cSure, sure, make him kneel down and put on your shoes for you. But, haha, we want to see this classic scene again!\u201dThe other two also said joyfully, \u201cWe want to see it too!\u201dVictoria chuckled gently. If the company\u2019s other employees caught wind of the fact that the deputy president of the company had subdued the president into kneeling down and putting on her shoes for her, they would know that even the president had to obey her!In the future, no one in the company would dare to defy her again!\u201cOkay, I guarantee that I\u2019d be able to make this greenhorn kneel down before me within three minutes!\u201dVictoria said with a face full of confidence.After all, she had once conquered a forty-year-old president who was even more imposing and had seen countless beautiful women before.Victoria thought that a mere greenhorn in his early twenties would definitely be unable to resist her enormous charm!Victoria strutted towards the president\u2019s office where Jordan was.Bang! Bang!Victoria knocked gently on the door twice.\u201cPlease, come in.\u201d Jordan\u2019s voice came from inside.The door hampered Victoria from recognizing Jordan\u2019s voice.After Victoria pushed the door to enter, she did not close the door fully but left it slightly ajar.On the other hand, Ashley and the other two girls walked silently to the door barefooted and peeped in through the crack.Ashley said, \u201cDo you think Miss Clarke can take down the new president, Mr. Steele? He doesn\u2019t seem to be a lustful man.\u201dThe head of the investment department said, \u201cOh, there was once a gentlemanly president who claimed to be ascetic but when he saw Miss Clarke take off her jacket to bare her shoulders, he had a nosebleed. Trust me, Miss Clarke is a president killer. Unless he\u2019s a virgin, any man who has gotten intimate with a woman before would know how perfect Miss Clarke is!\u201dThe graduate students who were working as interns at the company gazed at Victoria with admiration in their eyes. They secretly vowed to learn well from her and strive to use some tactics to take down one or two presidents, or at worst, two \u201cbackup guys.\u201dIn the office\u2026Victoria walked in and discovered a young man seated on the president\u2019s chair with his side facing her. He was holding onto a large company annual report in his hand while looking out the window.From the angle Victoria was standing, she could only see a third of his side profile.Victoria did not speak and instead observed him carefully.\u201cWhat a cool haircut. He looks like a K-pop idol.\u201dGenerally speaking, the bosses Victoria came into contact with were either bald or had thinning hair. However, Jordan had a head full of hair and seemed very stylish.\u201cHe\u2019s got such a high nose bridge!\u201d\u201cHis side profile is so handsome too. He gives me d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!\u201dUpon seeing Jordan, Victoria burst with joy.She was not a lesbian at all. She fancied men, and the only reason she never had a boyfriend was that she was afraid that having a boyfriend would hinder her from coming into contact with other rich tycoons.On the other hand, she also had high requirements for her other half. Not only must her boyfriend be rich, but he also had to be good-looking, interesting, good taste, and a mind of his own!\u201cMr. Steele, I\u2019m Victoria, the deputy president of the company. I heard that you want to see me.\u201dVictoria said in a tender, gentle and delicate voice.At this moment, Jordan put down the document in his hand and turned his chair around.Outside the door.\u201cAh! He turned around! I wonder if Mr. Steele will get a nosebleed on the spot when he sees how gorgeous Miss Clarke is. Haha.\u201d\u201cI reckon he\u2019d probably kneel down on the spot and call her Queen. Haha.\u201dIn the office.When Jordan turned the chair around, Victoria finally saw his face!\u201cJordan\u2026 Jordan Steele?\u201dThat was probably the most shocking moment in Victoria\u2019s life and the most disoriented she had been.Jordan actually made Victoria, who had always been high up in the air and viewed men as playthings, go to her knees!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A second after they met, Miss Clarke got on her knees!\u2019\u2018Could it be that the new president of the company, Mr. Steele, is so charming and domineering that even Miss Clarke, who\u2019s usually high up in the air, has submitted to him!?!\u2019The trio was even more in awe and respectful towards Jordan!Hearing the sounds outside the door, Jordan peeked through the gap, and the frightened trio frantically fled.Afterward, Jordan walked up to Victoria and simply looked at her from above without helping her up.Jordan smiled and said, \u201cMiss Clarke, why are you kneeling down in front of me as soon as we met? I can\u2019t accept such a grand gesture from you.\u201dVictoria secretly thought to herself, \u2018If you can\u2019t accept it, hurry up and help me up. You\u2019re making me so embarrassed, and this is such an awkward position to be in\u2026\u2019All adults would probably get the wrong idea if they saw Victoria\u2019s and Jordan\u2019s postures now.However, Victoria also knew that she could only blame it on herself.\u2018Screw the Camdens! If it weren\u2019t for them, I wouldn\u2019t have ended up offending my superior!\u2019The thought of everything that happened yesterday made Victoria feel an urge to die.Victoria immediately apologized guiltily, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Steele, I was wrong! Please forgive me for what I said yesterday!\u201dJordan squatted down and faced Victoria. \u201cYesterday? Oh, I remember, you seemed to have said that we were lovers yesterday.\u201dJordan pulled Victoria into his arms!Jordan managed to easily hold the woman whom many tycoons in the business circle of Orlando had been coveting for a long time!If someone else dared to do this to Victoria, she would have definitely slapped him.However, she didn\u2019t dare to do that to Jordan.Well, because she was the one who said that Jordan was her boyfriend.Victoria\u2019s fragrant bodily scent wafted up to Jordan\u2019s nose. It was no wonder so many men were head-over-heels smitten with Victoria. Jordan felt refreshed and pleased after just holding her in his arms for a while.Jordan continued to gibe, \u201cI heard that I even booked an entire island to beg you to be my girlfriend. Which island was it?\u201dFeeling incredibly embarrassed, Victoria wished she could dig a hole and jump right into it.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was wrong.\u201d Victoria apologized again.Jordan didn\u2019t want to behave intimately with the vice president of his company in the office either. Hence, he let go of her and stood up.\u201cOkay, get up now. It won\u2019t be good to let the other employees see this.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dVictoria hurriedly got up and immediately closed the door of the office. She then took out the remote control and turned on the privacy mode of the glass window to prevent the employees outside from seeing what was going on inside.At this moment, Jordan had already returned to his seat.He said domineeringly, \u201cMiss Clarke, you said yesterday that you would cut off all the possible means for me to maintain a livelihood in Orlando. I\u2019m now your superior, the president of Ace Corporation.\u201d\u201cLet me ask you, how else are you going to do that now!?!\u201dSince the birthday celebration yesterday, Jordan had been looking forward to this moment!\u2018Cut off all the possible means for me to maintain a livelihood?\u2019\u2018Do you have the ability to do that!?!\u2019Victoria hung her head low and said, \u201cMr. Steele, I really didn\u2019t expect that someone of your status would be willing to be a live-in son-in-law of the Camdens.\u201d\u201cI know I can\u2019t erase the mistake I\u2019ve committed. I\u2019m willing to accept any punishment that you give me.\u201d\u201cIf you want to slap me, I will walk over and let you do it. If you want to berate me, I\u2019ll listen to all your lectures.\u201d\u201cIf you want to fire me, I\u2019ll pack up my things and leave now. I\u2019ll never appear in front of you nor provoke you again.\u201dJordan nodded, discovering that Victoria was indeed not a simple woman. Whenever she was in trouble, she wouldn\u2019t panic and was willing to bear the consequences of her mistakes without defending herself or shirk the responsibility.Jordan said, \u201cI don\u2019t plan to fire you.\u201dVictoria raised her head in surprise as she wondered, \u2018I crossed the line and did such an outrageous thing yesterday, but Jordan doesn\u2019t intend to fire me?\u2019Jordan said, \u201cYesterday, you were the only one who offered me a chance to survive. If I\u2019m really just an ordinary live-in son-in-law, you\u2019d be my benefactor.\u201dAfter thinking about it, Jordan realized that Victoria didn\u2019t do anything too outrageous to Jordan yesterday.The other guests turned against Jordan and alienated him without hesitation, but Victoria pleaded on Jordan\u2019s behalf and even intended to let Jordan be her bodyguard, despite facing the risk of offending Old Mrs. Camden.Victoria merely stood in solidarity with them because she felt embarrassed after Jordan turned her down.Feeling extremely touched, Victoria exclaimed with tears in her eyes, \u201cThank you, Mr. Steele! I\u2019ll serve you wholeheartedly in the future!\u201dVictoria didn\u2019t expect Jordan to be so magnanimous and understanding at such a young age.Jordan said, \u201cI can forgive you, but I won\u2019t let a single one of those people who swore they would cut off all means of a livelihood for me get away scot-free.\u201d\u201cMiss Clarke\u2026\u201d\u201cYou may call me Victoria,\u201d Victoria said in a gentle voice after wiping her tears.Jordan said, \u201cVictoria, collate the information of those who said they would cut off all means of a livelihood for me and hand it over to me.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Victoria knew that Jordan was going to exact revenge on them!There is soon to be an upheaval in the business circle of Orlando!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Restaurant mogul? Delivery service owner?Jordan wanted to subvert and exterminate the big bosses who had dominated Orlando for years in one fell swoop!Among them, Tyler was the first person that came to Jordan\u2019s mind!As soon as he thought of Tyler, Jordan recalled everything that his ex-wife, Hailey said.\u201cLook at Tyler. His family is worth more than a billion dollars. Can you compare to him, you good-for-nothing?\u201dJordan humphed softly and asked Victoria, \u201cI heard that the Collins are a first-tier family in Orlando who are worth more than a billion dollars?\u201dVictoria answered, \u201cYou can say so. They were worth more than a billion dollars two years ago, but their net worth has shrunk greatly, now they\u2019re probably worth about 500 million dollars. They\u2019re not much better than the Camdens now.\u201dRecalling that Jordan claimed that Hailey was in an extramarital affair with Tyler during the birthday banquet yesterday, Victoria immediately continued.\u201cHailey Camden must be blind to have chosen that good-for-nothing Tyler Collins over you! Once she finds out your true identity, I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll be full of regrets.\u201dThe thought of Hailey Camden made Jordan feel a little bitter. After all, he had loved her for three years!Victoria continued, \u201cThe Camdens are working on a project lately, and they want us to invest 11 million dollars in it. They offered me many benefits, but I\u2019ll turn them down now and tell them to forget about cooperating with Ace Corporation!\u201dVictoria initially wanted to make the cooperation happen, but she knew Jordan was on bad terms with the Camdens. Since he used to be the live-in son-in-law of the Camdens, whom they had kicked out afterward, how could he be willing to cooperate with them?To her surprise, Jordan said, \u201cYou fabricated a number of lies about me yesterday, but there is one thing that you were right about.\u201d\u201cI keep work and personal life separate. So I won\u2019t boycott the Camdens in business just because of my personal relationship with them.\u201d\u201cShow me the proposal of that project.\u201dVictoria was a little surprised, and she thought to herself that Jordan indeed had a moral character.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll bring it over to you now.\u201d Victoria turned around and was about to leave.\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll go with you and at the same time check out your office. I\u2019d like to see if the office of a great beauty like you is full of fragrance.\u201dJordan got up from his chair and followed Victoria.Meanwhile, Tyler was still waiting anxiously in the lobby of the first floor. He hadn\u2019t left yet.He wanted to go up and see what was going on, but he couldn\u2019t do so without an access card.\u201cHey, Mr. Collins.\u201dA female employee of Ace Corporation took the initiative to walk towards Tyler all of a sudden.Tyler looked at her, but he didn\u2019t recognize who she was.The lady laughed and said, \u201cMr. Collins, surely you haven\u2019t forgotten who I am, have you? That\u2019s really sad. You bought me a drink at LINX Bar the other day. Afterward, we went to\u2026 You had fun with me the entire night.\u201dOnly then did Tyler remember that he had a one-night-stand with her previously.The poor girl\u2019s mediocre looks and tacky makeup made Tyler feel like Hailey was hundreds of notches higher than her.He secretly cursed, \u2018Damn it, I must have had too much to drink that day. I accepted such a lousy woman.\u2019However, Tyler remained smiling and asked, \u201cOh, yes, I remember. Do you work at Ace Corporation?\u201dThe lady nodded.Tyler grabbed her hand and said, \u201cQuick, take me upstairs. Your deputy president Miss Clarke is in danger!\u201dA minute later, Tyker arrived at the floor where Jordan was.As soon as he got out of the elevator, he heard a few female employees of Ace Corporation whispering among themselves.\u201cHey, you know what? She knelt down right after she saw the president! Do you believe it? She got on her knees the second she saw him!\u201dTyler didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, but he didn\u2019t care about the gossip of Ace Corporation either.Hence, he simply walked up to them and asked, \u201cMay I ask, where is Miss Victoria Clarke?\u201dThe person he asked was Ashley, Victoria\u2019s secretary. \u201cMiss Clarke is in her office. Do you have an appointment?\u201dTyler ignored her and dashed straight into Victoria\u2019s office.As soon as he pushed open the door, he discovered that Jordan was also in Victoria\u2019s office!It just so happened that Victoria had found the project proposal of the Camdens and handed it to Jordan.However, in Tyler\u2019s eyes, she looked like she was assigning a task to her assistant.\u201cTyler? Who let you in?\u201d Victoria rebuked furiously.Since Tyler was Jordan\u2019s rival, Victoria couldn\u2019t get too close to him and his family from now on!Tyler didn\u2019t answer her question and instead pointed at Jordan. \u201cWow, Jordan, you embarrassing thief! Sure enough, you\u2019re here! Are you hiding here to prepare to exact revenge against Miss Clarke!?!\u201dJordan retorted, \u201cIs there something wrong with you? Is this a place you can just enter as you please? Get lost!\u201dJordan was the president of Ace Corporation and the owner of this building. How could he allow Tyler to act brazenly and presumptuously here!?!When Tyler saw how arrogant Jordan was, he snapped indignantly, \u201cHow dare you talk to me like that. This is Victoria\u2019s office. You should be the one to get lost! Isn\u2019t that right, Victoria?\u201dSmack!Victoria slapped Tyler on the face and rebuked him in exasperation, \u201cWho are you calling Victoria? Call me Miss Clarke!\u201dTyler looked extremely embarrassed, and the sounds of Ashley\u2019s laughter could be heard coming from outside.Tyler gradually felt that there was something amiss with the situation. It seemed that everyone was aware that Jordan was in Victoria\u2019s office.But why didn\u2019t Ashley and the others stop him?After thinking about it, Tyler suddenly pointed at Jordan and yelled, \u201cI get it! You\u2019re not here to take revenge on Miss Clarke but to be her bodyguard!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he thought about what Ashley and her colleagues said about someone kneeling down just now, he reckoned that Jordan must have gotten on his knees in front of Victoria!He thought Jordan must have kneeled down to beg for Victoria\u2019s forgiveness and plead with her to let him be her bodyguard.Tyler said, \u201cJordan Steele, weren\u2019t you acting all noble and lofty at the birthday banquet yesterday? At that time, Miss Clarke asked you to be her bodyguard, but you turned her down. After that, we all thought you were really bold enough to rather die than succumb!\u201d\u201cHaha, I didn\u2019t expect you to end up getting out of bed early in the morning to get dressed and come here in a bodyguard\u2019s suit to beg Miss Clarke to let you be her lackey!\u201d\u201cMiss Clarke, you mustn\u2019t agree. During the banquet yesterday, you said that you would make sure Jordan Steele doesn\u2019t get to make a living here in the future!\u201dAfter the secretary Ashley, who was standing outside the door, heard her words, she was so shocked that she couldn\u2019t believe her ears.\u2018Miss Clarke wanted to cut off all of Mr. Steele\u2019s means of a livelihood?\u2019\u2018Oh my God, is that true?\u2019Victoria was boiling with fury. \u2018How dare Tyler Collins put me in a spot in public and let the employees know how disrespectful I was to the president of the corporation!?!\u2019Smack!Victoria slapped him again!\u201cBastard! When did I ever say that!?! Get out of here now! You\u2019re not allowed to set foot in this company again.\u201d She continued, \u201cAlso, the employee who brought him up here is to be fired immediately!\u201dTyler covered his face in pain and misery. He was the scion of the Collins, and yet, he was slapped twice in public!However, since it was Victoria\u2019s territory, Tyler didn\u2019t dare to speak to her aggressively.Thus, he had no choice but to vent his anger on Jordan, shouting, \u201cJordan Steele, don\u2019t think that we can\u2019t do anything to you just because you\u2019re Victoria Clarke\u2019s bodyguard! Just you wait, I\u2019ll make sure that you end up homeless and get put behind bars soon!\u201dIn low spirits, Tyler headed downstairs and returned to his car. Then, in a moment of fury, he continuously slammed his hands hard against the steering wheel.\u201cVictoria Clarke, you bitch! You\u2019re just a pretty face who relied on men to get to the top! So who are you to slap me!?! Once I subdue Hailey Camden, I\u2019ll make sure you kneel in front of me and call me Daddy one day! I\u2019m going to give you a hard time, you bitch!\u201d\u201cI have to quickly inform the Camdens about that good-for-nothing Jordan Steele becoming Victoria Clarke\u2019s bodyguard.\u201d\u2026An hour later, in the Camdens\u2019 villa.\u201cWhat did you say? That loser Jordan Steele became Victoria Clarke\u2019s bodyguard?\u201dOld Mrs. Camden was shocked to hear what Tyler said.Even Hailey, Herman, Elle, Drew, and Benedict were surprised.Tyler said, \u201cYes, I saw it with my own eyes. Jordan took a document from Victoria Clarke in her office.\u201d\u201cI also heard from the employees of Ace Corporation that Jordan kneeled down the second he saw Victoria and begged her for forgiveness.\u201d\u201cVictoria showed an interest in Jordan yesterday, and I think Victoria gave in because she was softhearted toward him.\u201dHearing this, Hailey clenched her fists furiously. \u201cThat bastard Jordan Steele! He actually kneeled down for another woman! I\u2019ve been married to him for three years, and he\u2019s never kneeled down to me!\u201d\u201cI gave him several chances to kneel down and admit to his mistakes. As long as he got on his knees to beg me, I won\u2019t divorce him or call the cops on him. But, he didn\u2019t end up kneeling down!\u201d\u201cYet, he kneeled down in front of another woman so quickly!\u201dThe more Hailey spoke, the more agitated and aggrieved she was, so much that she was on the verge of tears.It was indeed a great shame and insult to the Camdens.Drew sneered and gibed, \u201cHailey, how have you been educating him in the past three years? He got on his knees for another woman instead of his wife. That\u2019s such an embarrassment for our family.\u201dElle also took the opportunity to mock, \u201cHailey, it seems that you are still not charming enough! If Jordan was my husband, I would definitely let him kneel down and wash my feet every day, from the very first day of our marriage!\u201dEven Old Mrs. Camden found it embarrassing and thus started reprimanding Hailey and her parents.\u201cYou can\u2019t even tame and discipline a live-in son-in-law within three years! You\u2019re so incompetent! If you had disciplined him as Elle said, would he have dared to hit Drew?\u201dHailey clenched her fists even more tightly and barked, \u201cIf I were given another chance to make him my husband, I would make him kneel before me from morning until night! Unfortunately, for the past three years, I\u2019ve been too nice to him!\u201dIn fact, for the past three years, Hailey had really treated Jordan pretty well. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have fallen in love with her.However, Hailey now seemed to have regretted being so gentle with him.Hailey felt humiliated because Victoria managed to make Jordan kneel down in front of her while she didn\u2019t.The person she was most jealous of now was Victoria!Hailey said, \u201cGrandma, Victoria Clarke went back on her words. Yesterday, she swore that she would stand in solidarity with the Camdens and make sure Jordan can never survive in this city in the future. Yet, she took him as her bodyguard today. We should cut off all ties with her and deal with her!\u201dSmack!Old Mrs. Camden slapped Hailey on her face and rebuked, \u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting!?!Victoria Clarke still holds the $11 million that is to be invested in our project. How can we turn against her!?!\u201dHerman humphed coldly. \u201cHailey, I know you\u2019re jealous of Miss Clarke, but she\u2019s more tactful and competent than you. So you have to accept it even if you don\u2019t want to.\u201dHailey turned beet red. She couldn\u2019t take it lying down!\u201cSince you guys won\u2019t help me, I\u2019ll go look for them at Ace Corporation on my own!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I want to speak to her personally.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHerman hurriedly took out his cell phone and dialed Victoria\u2019s number before handing the cell phone to Old Mrs. Camden.Although Old Mrs. Camden was furious, her tone was very gentle. After all, she was old in her years and had experienced a lot in this life. Such a trivial matter was not enough to make her lose her composure.Old Mrs. Camden said gently while still seeming domineering and authoritative, \u201cMiss Clarke, I heard that Jordan went to your office and became your bodyguard.\u201d\u201cHad I known that you had taken a liking to Jordan, I would have given him to you half a year ago.\u201d\u201cHowever, yesterday, you said you would stand in solidarity with the Camdens and cut off all means of a livelihood for him. Yet, you went back on your word today. You seem to owe me an explanation, don\u2019t you?\u201dVictoria said, \u201cThings are not like what you think, but no matter what, I do owe you an apology for failing to fulfill the promise I made to you yesterday. I\u2019m sorry that I failed to keep it.\u201dHearing Victoria\u2019s sincere apology, Old Mrs. Camden felt much better.\u201cHey, there\u2019s no need to apologize. We\u2019re as close as family. But, since you like that punk, take him under your wing. He\u2019s just a live-in son-in-law. Take it as a gift from the Camdens to you!\u201d\u201cNo, she can\u2019t have him!\u201d Hailey protested with jealousy written all over her face.Old Mrs. Camden was furious, and she glowered at Hailey before quickly covering the cell phone\u2019s microphone for fear that Victoria would hear Hailey.When Sylvie Parker saw how furious Old Mrs. Camden was, she hurriedly placed her hand over Hailey\u2019s mouth to stop her from talking.Old Mrs. Camden continued to talk on the phone smilingly, \u201cI can forget about what happened to Jordan, but Miss Clarke, you promised you would invest 11 million dollars in our project. You\u2019re not going to break your promise again, are you?\u201dVictoria said, \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Mr. Steele regarding the investment. He\u2019s very impressed with your proposal, and he likes it very much, but he would like to find out more about this project.\u201d\u201cWhat? Mr. Steele read our proposal? He likes it very much too?\u201dOld Mrs. Camden excitedly repeated Victoria\u2019s words.The Camdens jumped for joy after hearing her words!Old Mrs. Camden said, \u201cHe wants to find out more? That\u2019s simple. I\u2019ll send Herman to visit Mr. Steele at his office personally to discuss the project with him in person!\u201dVictoria said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll arrange for an appointment then.\u201dOld Mrs. Camden said excitedly, \u201cThank you, Miss Clarke, I will definitely send you a gift to thank you after this matter is settled!\u201dAfter hanging up, Old Mrs. Camden grinned widely, so much that her wrinkles had become much clearer too.\u201cHerman, Mr. Steele has read our project proposal. Get yourself ready. Miss Clarke will arrange a meeting between you and Mr. Steele at any time. When the time comes, you must perform well in front of Mr. Steele and make sure you don\u2019t mess up!\u201dHerman was extremely excited too. \u201cRest assured, Mom, I\u2019ll definitely suck up to Mr. Steele when I meet him! I\u2019ll make our project sound unparalleled. Hahaha.\u201d\u201cBut now that Jordan is Miss Clarke\u2019s subordinate are we just going to drop the matter about him stealing from us?\u201dOld Mrs. Camden humphed coldly and said, \u201cWhy forgo it? Continue investigating Jordan\u2019s theft of the watch and find me all the evidence. When the time comes, we will be able to use the evidence to punish him according to family rules, put him behind bars, or do Victoria Clarke a favor.\u201dDrew suddenly interjected, \u201cGrandma, I\u2019ve already found out that he sold the watch to a gangster.\u201dOld Mrs. Camden nodded in satisfaction and said, \u201cGreat, find me the evidence. Jordan is now just Victoria Clarke\u2019s lackey. Even if we take revenge on him, Victoria won\u2019t do anything to us.\u201dOld Mrs. Camden then looked at Hailey and her parents.She barked furiously, \u201cHerman has clinched a contract with Mr. Steele for our company while Drew has found evidence of Jordan\u2019s theft. What about you guys? What have you contributed to the family? You three are equally incompetent!\u201d\u201cYou couldn\u2019t even keep your live-in husband in line. You\u2019ve let your pretty face go to waste. That face of yours should have belonged to Elle instead!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden had always been biased towards Herman and his children. Now, she even blatantly criticized Hailey in front of everyone.Being extremely prideful, Hailey immediately ran away furiously.\u201cHailey, where are you going!?!\u201dTyler followed her out, only to realize that Hailey had already sped off in her car. In addition, she looked really aggressive as if she was going to kill someone!\u201cJordan Steele, you bastard, you\u2019ve really embarrassed our family. So this time, I\u2019m going to teach you a good lesson!\u201dHailey soon arrived at Ace Corporation in her Audi.Since the Camdens were in talks of cooperation with Ace Corporation, Hailey had the phone number of Ashley, Victoria\u2019s secretary.\u201cWhere are Jordan and Victoria Clarke?\u201dHailey asked, seated in her car in the underground parking lot.Ashley answered, \u201cThey\u2019ve just gone downstairs and to the parking lot. Miss Camden, why are you looking for them\u2026\u201dHailey hung up before Ashley could finish speaking. She then got out of her car and looked around.Indeed, she soon saw a man and a woman talking and laughing while walking towards a red Porsche Panamera.It was Jordan and Victoria!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was now chatting merrily with Victoria.If Jordan wasn\u2019t her ex-husband, Hailey would have mistakenly thought that he was the domineering president of a company when she watched him stride over!\u201cThis jerk dressed himself up so handsomely after divorcing me!\u201dHailey felt a little sour. If she had known that Jordan could look so much like a domineering president of a company, she would have made Jordan wear a suit and tie all the time for the past three years.Well, at least she could show him off and pretend a little during gatherings with her former classmates.In the distance, Jordan said to Victoria, \u201cVictoria, pass me the car keys. I\u2019ll drive. Since you\u2019re wearing heels, it won\u2019t be convenient for you to drive.\u201dIn fact, Victoria had a pair of flats in the car, which she would change into when she was driving.However, she felt that changing shoes in front of Jordan wouldn\u2019t seem very elegant, so she handed the car keys to Jordan.\u201cThank you then, Mr. Steele.\u201dJordan took the keys and walked towards the fiery red Porsche Panamera. To her surprise, he actually walked to the passenger side first and then opened the door.Victoria was stunned. \u201cYou\u2026\u201dVictoria was confused. \u2018Didn\u2019t Jordan say that he\u2019d drive? So why did he open the passenger side?\u2019Jordan patted his head helplessly and said, \u201cOh shucks, I\u2019ve gotten used to opening the car door for Hailey Camden for the past three years.\u201dVictoria chuckled. Only then did she realize that Jordan had taken the initiative to open the car door for her.As Jordan\u2019s subordinate, Victoria should be the one to open the door for him, not the other way around.However, since he had already done it, Jordan decided to be a gentleman again. \u201cMiss Clarke, please.\u201dVictoria looked flattered and said, \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m so honored to have Mr. Steele personally open the car door for me.\u201dJordan smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019ve been opening the door for Hailey Camden for three years. I would open the door for her every time she got in and out of the car.\u201dVictoria knew that Jordan was deeply hurt by Hailey, and hence, she said, \u201cHailey Camden really doesn\u2019t know how blessed she was!\u201dVictoria then got inside the car.Seeing this, Hailey dashed over in exasperation and yelled at them.\u201cJordan Steele! You\u2019re so shameless! How dare you really become Victoria Clarke\u2019s lackey!?!\u201dWhen Hailey saw Jordan open the door for Victoria, he was even more convinced that Jordan had become Victoria\u2019s bodyguard.For the past three years, Jordan had only ever opened the car door for Hailey and her parents. But now, he actually opened the car door for another woman. Hailey was distraught over that!\u201cHailey Camden?\u201dJordan looked at his ex-wife with surprise. He thought he would become a stranger to her again from now on, but he didn\u2019t expect to meet her again less than a day after they parted!Victoria also hurriedly got out of the car, unsure of why she was there. If it was for the discussion of the project, they should be expecting Herman instead.Hailey stared at Jordan and hollered, \u201cJordan Steele, have you got any dignity and self-respect!?! How dare you kneel down to Victoria, beg her for forgiveness, and then become her lackey!?!\u201d\u201cSince you can forget your dignity, why didn\u2019t you kneel down to me and beg me to forgive you back then? I gave you several chances. As long as you had kneeled down to beg me, you\u2019d still be my husband now\u2026\u201dAs soon as Jordan thought about Hailey\u2019s words, he flew into a rage.\u201cYou still have the nerve to ask me why I didn\u2019t get on my knees for you? The day before yesterday, you made me a cuckold by checking into a hotel room with Tyler Collins. Yet, you still want me to kneel down to you and beg you for forgiveness? Don\u2019t you think that you\u2019ve gone overboard!?!\u201dHailey pursed her lips and said, \u201cWhat about those few times after that incident? At Grandma\u2019s birthday banquet yesterday, I gave you the opportunity to kneel down and beg me. As long as you kneeled then, I would have asked Grandma to let me not divorce you. You\u2019d still be my husband now.\u201d\u201cIf you had kneeled down and begged me at the West Lake Hotel, I wouldn\u2019t have called the police!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re kneeling all the same, so why did you kneel down in front of her and not me!?! I\u2019m at least your wife. Is it shameful and embarrassing to kneel down before your wife?\u201dJordan said, \u201cIt\u2019s not embarrassing to kneel down to my wife, but it is a huge disgrace to kneel down to my cheating wife! You\u2019ve done something to let me down, and yet, instead of kneeling and begging me for forgiveness, you asked me to kneel down and beg you instead?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve really spoiled you rotten the past three years!\u201dHailey flew into a rage too. \u201cYou spoiled me rotten? More like I spoiled you! I shouldn\u2019t have been so nice to you and caused you to become so lawless now. Now, my family is blaming me for failing to take you in hand. If I had known, I would have made you kneel down and wash my feet every day!\u201dSmack!A loud slap landed on Hailey\u2019s delicate and pretty face.Dumbfounded, Hailey raised her head to see that the person who slapped her was Victoria!Unable to tolerate it any longer, Victoria snapped, \u201cHailey Camden! You were the one who cheated, but instead of reflecting on yourself, you said such things! As a woman, don\u2019t you feel ashamed at all!?!\u201dHailey put a hand on her pretty face and questioned furiously, \u201cYou\u2026 How dare you slap me!?\u201dVictoria humphed coldly and gibed, \u201cAm I supposed to pick the right time and day to slap you?\u201dVictoria wasn\u2019t scared of Hailey at all. Hailey was not comparable to Victoria due to her lack of status in the Orlando business industry as her family had no regard for her.Hailey didn\u2019t dare to fight Victoria because she was no match for the latter\u2019s dominance and competence.Looking extremely aggrieved, she questioned with tears in her eyes, \u201cYou stole my man, and now you slapped me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hence, she had never been so aggrieved before.If anyone dared to slap Hailey in the past, Jordan would have never spared them.However, Jordan knew that Victoria had slapped Hailey to stand up for him.Besides, Hailey had brought it all upon herself!Jordan pressed his right hand on Victoria\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cForget it.\u201dImmediately afterward, he said to Hailey, \u201cLeave, I\u2019m not your man anymore!\u201dHailey suddenly stopped crying. She had never shown her soft side to Jordan.\u201cEven if I no longer want a dog that I\u2019ve raised for three years, I\u2019ll never give it to someone else casually!\u201d\u201cJordan Steele, I order you to leave Ace Corporation immediately and quit being Victoria Clarke\u2019s bodyguard!\u201d\u201cVictoria Clarke pays you an annual salary of $30,000 a year, huh? I\u2019ll pay you $80,000!\u201dHearing Hailey\u2019s words, Victoria couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter. \u201cHahaha, with just $80,000, you\u2019re trying to poach Mr\u2026\u201d\u201cAhem\u2026\u201dJordan immediately coughed to interrupt Victoria, who was about to habitually call him \u2018Mr. Steele\u2019.Hailey was now incredibly agitated. She had just faced the music at home and got slapped on the face by Victoria. If she were to find out Jordan\u2019s true identity, she probably wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand this series of consecutive blows.Victoria glanced at Jordan before continuing, \u201cHaha, you\u2019re trying to poach Jordan with just $80,000. Aren\u2019t you a little too naive? Even if you add another zero to that, it won\u2019t be enough!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWith a look of disbelief, Hailey thought, \u2018Could it be that Jordan\u2019s annual salary as a bodyguard is not $80,000 but $800,000?\u2019\u2018No matter how rich Victoria Clarke may be, she shouldn\u2019t be willing to spend $800,000 on a bodyguard.\u2019Knowing that she wasn\u2019t as wealthy as Victoria, Hailey demanded, \u201cJordan, you must resign from Ace Corporation today!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you, Drew has already found evidence of you stealing the watch, and once we hand it over to the police, they will sentence you to prison!\u201d\u201cOn account that we were married, I don\u2019t want you to spend the best time of your youth behind bars!\u201d\u201cIf you listen to me and leave Victoria Clarke to come home with me and become my bodyguard, I can get Drew to let you off!\u201dNot bothered at all, Jordan retorted, \u201cThank you for your kind offer, but I really can\u2019t be your bodyguard. I can\u2019t bring myself to protect you while watching you get a room with another man!\u201d\u201cIf Drew Camden has evidence against me, he can feel free to press charges as he wishes.\u201dAfter saying his piece, Jordan got into the driver\u2019s seat of the Porsche and drove off with Victoria beside him.\u201cJordan, you\u2019re not allowed to leave!\u201dWatching Jordan leave, Hailey was so furious that she began stomping her feet.\u201cWhat an adulterous pair! Victoria Clarke can\u2019t be paying Jordan $800,000 just to be her bodyguard. She probably wants him to be her lover too!\u201d\u201cWow, Victoria Clarke, you\u2019re already dating the president of your company, but you\u2019re still hooking up with another man. Yet, you have the cheek to call me shameless. You\u2019re the shameless one!\u201d\u201cJordan is such a jerk too. He clearly knows that Victoria Clarke has a boyfriend, but he still willingly agreed to be her lover. Since he can put up with Victoria Clarke having another man, why can\u2019t he make the same compromise with me!?!\u201d\u201cSuch double standards! He\u2019s the death of me! How am I inferior to Victoria Clarke!?!\u201d\u20267th Street.The poor lived there, as well as the big bosses.The infamous big boss Salvatore had been residing there for a long time.At this moment, Drew had already reached 7th Street and was introduced to the legendary Salvatore.\u201cHello, Mr. Salvatore,\u201d Drew called out when he saw a burly, tattooed man who had dirty dreadlocks.Salvatore was eating oysters and drinking beer. He glanced at Drew and said, \u201cMr. Camden, welcome.\u201dDespite being kind on the surface, Salvatore continued eating and drinking without even looking at Drew.Drew didn\u2019t get offended, either.Drew said, \u201cI\u2019m here to make a deal with you, Mr. Salvatore. I have a Richard Mille watch here that\u2019s worth more than $800,000, which I\u2019d like to sell to you at a discounted price of $700,000.\u201d\u201cBut you can\u2019t say that I sold it to you. Just say that a person named Jordan Steele sold it to you.\u201dAfter taking a glance at the wound on Drew\u2019s face, Salvatore smiled and asked, \u201cDid that Jordan Steele give you that bruise on your face?\u201dDrew nodded awkwardly and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, Mr. Salvatore. He\u2019s my cousin\u2019s loser husband. For the sake of our family\u2019s pride, we don\u2019t want to make a big fuss out of this, but we can\u2019t take this lying down! I have to put him behind bars!\u201dSalvatore took a sip of beer and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to go to all that trouble. I\u2019ll just send a few people to help you teach him a lesson. Wouldn\u2019t that do the trick?\u201dDrew sighed and said, \u201cMr. Salvatore, that punk is good at fighting. He crippled all the professional fighters my dad sent to deal with him!\u201d\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d Salvatore was immediately interested.\u2018Can a so-called loser and live-in son-in-law be that good at martial arts?\u2019After some thought, Salvatore shook his head and said, \u201cI can\u2019t help you with that. Mr. Pablo warned us not to get involved in the family affairs of others, lest we end up being the only sinners after they reconcile.\u201dAfter being rejected, Drew exclaimed anxiously, \u201cNo! My cousin has already divorced Jordan Steele! Besides, who\u2019s Pablo? Why do you have to obey him?\u201d\u201cBastard! Mr. Pablo is Salvatore\u2019s boss!\u201dSalvatore\u2019s underling suddenly barked at Drew.After hollering at his underling, Salvatore said to Drew smilingly, \u201cMr. Pablo is my leader. Without him, there will be no me, so I have to obey him! You\u2019d better look for someone else.\u201dDrew refused to give up. He knew that Salvatore was a money-grubber and needed money because the bans placed on illegal businesses recently had affected many of the ones Salvatore owned.Hence, Drew offered, \u201cI\u2019ll sell this watch to you at $600,000!\u201dSalvatore shook his head and declined, \u201cAs I said, Mr. Pablo is like my father. I have to obey him!\u201dDrew gritted his teeth and exclaimed, \u201c$450,000! You can earn $350,000 if you resell it after buying it from me!\u201dSalvatore guffawed loudly, \u201cMr. Pablo also said that we should never say no to money. Making money is the most important thing in this world. Mr. Camden, I\u2019ll do it!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t slap her again.\u201dVictoria could tell that Jordan felt some heartache for his ex-wife!Victoria said, \u201cYes, Mr. Steele, but don\u2019t you hate her for treating you that way?\u201dJordan smiled and said, \u201cLove is the opposite of hate. Without Love, how can there be hate?\u201dHearing Jordan\u2019s rather philosophical words, Victoria no longer saw him as an inexperienced young man.Being the scion of a prestigious family, his knowledge and ideologies were not to be underestimated.Jordan was handsome, came from a wealthy family, had a unique mindset, and was very magnanimous and doting towards women.Victoria began to fall for him.\u2018I must win his heart!\u2019 Victoria thought to herself secretly.Dozens of minutes later, Jordan and Victoria arrived at a place called Golden Pavilion.It was surrounded by greenery and lakes, offering beautiful scenery. There was a half-built museum beside what appeared to be a resort.After alighting from the car, Jordan took a look at his surroundings and said, \u201cThe Camdens are planning to build a top-class private residence here.\u201dThe \u2018top-class private residence\u2019 was a project that the Camdens had asked the Ace Corporation to invest in. It was a private residence that was set to be meant for top-tier families.According to the proposal that the Camdens had submitted, there would eventually be more than ten Western-style villas within the residence.The interior was made of pinewood, with full-length glass windows that offered a stunning view of the scenery outside.Their intention was to create the most distinctive and beautiful private residence in the city.Victoria nodded and said, \u201cThis is the residence. This is the place with the most greenery in the city. There is an abundance of maple trees, and after moving in, the residence can have a picnic in the maple forest. There is also a natural spring here.\u201d\u201cI believe that the rich people of Orlando will definitely purchase and move into the villas here. But Mr. Steele, do you really plan to invest money in their project? The Camdens had treated you too outrageously!\u201dJordan smiled and said, \u201cActually, I was the one who came up with the concept of this project.\u201d\u201cWhat? Does it mean that the Camdens stole your idea?\u201d Victoria asked in astonishment.Jordan shook his head and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t say that. I can tell that the Camdens have always wanted to cozy up to the top families of the city, but Hailey\u2019s grandfather has kicked the bucket. Herman and Benedict Camden are both quite incompetent too. All they do is vie for the inheritance of their family assets.\u201d\u201cSo, I came up with this project for the Camdens, which would allow them to control the top families without needing to increase their abilities. The idea is to just develop an estate of private residences just for those top-tier families.\u201d\u201cI told Hailey about this idea, and she then told her grandmother about it. Although she accepted the idea, she let Herman Camden take over the project.\u201dVictoria said, \u201cThe Camdens are indeed more biased towards Herman Camden and his son. They tend to favor men over women and think that Hailey Camden isn\u2019t fit enough to inherit the family\u2019s empire. I do pity her for that.\u201dJordan nodded and agreed, \u201cYeah, Hailey has always been belittled by her family, and her parents have been putting pressure on her all the time. Yet, they arranged for her to marry a live-in son-in-law\u2026\u201d\u201cHmph, even if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s not a reason for her to cheat!\u201d Victoria said righteously.A maple leaf that was floating in the wind landed on Victoria\u2019s hair. After removing it for her, Jordan said, \u201cVictoria, have a drink with me.\u201d\u2026\u201cDrink! Drink with me!\u201dIn New City residential estate, Hailey held a glass of wine in hand with the company of a beautiful woman by her side. The woman was her best friend, Rachel Quinn.Rachel grabbed Hailey\u2019s glass from her and asked, \u201cHailey, what\u2019s the matter with you today? Who bullied you? Tell me, and I\u2019ll teach him a lesson!\u201dHailey snapped resentfully, \u201cIt\u2019s that bitch, Victoria Clarke! She slapped me! I merely lashed out at my incompetent husband, and I didn\u2019t provoke her at all. What right did she have to slap me? Who is she to that good-for-nothing Jordan!?!\u201dRachel said with a smile, \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard the saying about considering one\u2019s superior before hitting them? Since your ex-husband is Victoria Clarke\u2019s dog now, how can she let you insult him?\u201dHailey snatched the wine glass again and chugged it in one go.She exclaimed in exasperation, \u201cJordan is too heartless. I\u2019ve only cheated on him once, but which beautiful woman has never cheated on her husband in this day and age? Rachel, you\u2019ve even cheated twice!\u201dFeeling a little embarrassed, Rachel poured herself a glass of wine and retorted, \u201cWhy are you talking about me? It\u2019s not like my husband caught me red-handed.\u201dHailey said, \u201cHe\u2019s just a live-in son-in-law who sponges off us. Even if he found out, why couldn\u2019t he have just put up with it?\u201d\u201cRachel, you know what? I told him to kneel down in front of me, but he refused. Yet, he kneeled down to apologize to Victoria and even willingly became her bodyguard. Why did he do that? I can give him money too!\u201dRachel swirled the glass of wine in her hand and smiled, \u201cAccording to my understanding of Jordan, he loves you very much, and he won\u2019t move on that easily.\u201d\u201cHe must have rejected you and become Victoria Clarke\u2019s bodyguard to impress you!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Hailey sobered up quite a bit, but she was confused by Rachel\u2019s words.Rachel explained, \u201cThink about it. If he uses your money, he will definitely still feel like a freeloader, but if he earns his own money from someone else, he\u2019ll be able to hold his head high in front of you.\u201d\u201cI bet Jordan is trying to make a name for himself out there so that he\u2019ll be worthy enough to propose to you!\u201dAfter thinking about it, Hailey gradually smiled and said, \u201cHmph, I knew this punk still loves me, but I\u2019m not going to wait for him. Anyway, now that I\u2019m divorced, I can find another man who\u2019s compatible with me. Tyler is from a rich family, but he\u2019s too much of a playboy. He\u2019s not as meticulous as Jordan either.\u201dRachel said, \u201cYou can get married to Tyler Collins and at most divorce him if things really don\u2019t work out in the end. You can then marry Jordan again. A naive person like him will definitely agree.\u201dHailey nodded and agreed, \u201cGood idea.\u201dSeeing that Hailey was much more relaxed, Rachel clinked glasses with her. She said casually, \u201cHey, by the way, hasn\u2019t Jordan always been a househusband? Why did he suddenly start delivering takeouts in the past six months?\u201dHailey took a sip of wine and wiped her lips before answering, \u201cHe seemed to have contracted some diseases when we went on a trip to Switzerland six months ago. He needed money for treatment, but he didn\u2019t want to ask us for it, so he started working to make some money on his own.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Rachel did not probe any further and continued to drink with Hailey.At 8 am the following morning.Hailey, who hadn\u2019t sobered up fully, answered a phone call in a daze.On the other end of the line, the person said, \u201cHailey come to Grandma\u2019s place immediately. I found evidence of Jordan selling the watch!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve found evidence of you selling the watch that you stole from us!\u201dJordan said, \u201cI\u2019m too busy for that.\u201dDrew urged impatiently, \u201cJordan Steele, are you too scared to come? We\u2019ve invited the person who bought the watch from you to our place. If you have some guts, come here and confront him face to face!\u201dJordan was a little puzzled because he didn\u2019t sell any watches. So, where did Drew get the witness from?Drew said again, \u201cIt won\u2019t take you that long. Just a couple of minutes will do. Miss Clarke will be in the office in the morning. She doesn\u2019t need your protection during this time slot. So hurry up and come.\u201dJordan initially didn\u2019t want to go to the Camdens\u2019 place again, but he didn\u2019t want them to get the wrong idea and think he had stolen from them.\u201cOkay then, I\u2019ll make a trip there and settle this matter, lest you people keep bothering me.\u201dJordan hung up and then said to Ashley, \u201cMiss Rose, you can drive, right? Take me to the Camdens\u2019 villa.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Ashley Rose immediately put down the documents in her hand, grabbed the car keys, and took the initiative to press the elevator button for Jordan. They then boarded the elevator all the way to the underground parking lot.As Victoria\u2019s personal secretary, Ashley drew a monthly salary of quite a few thousand dollars, including commissions. She owned an Audi A3.However, this time, Ashley drove the company\u2019s car, a Mercedes Benz S600, because she was sending Jordan, the rightful boss of the corporation, to his destination. That was the car that they would usually use when attending formal events or picking up clients.However, Jordan didn\u2019t like that car because he felt it wasn\u2019t suitable for his age. So he decided that he would free up some time to purchase a vehicle of his own.Ashley sat in the driver\u2019s seat while Jordan took the backseat. Ashley drove relatively smoothly and quickly. However, throughout the journey, she would occasionally steal a glance at Jordan through the rearview mirror.\u2018This is so infuriating. Why does Mr. Steele takes the backseat all the time?\u2019Ashley thought to herself secretly. Recently, she considered leaving her position as Victoria\u2019s secretary, in order to become Jordan\u2019s personal assistant. In this way, she would have more opportunities to become close to Jordan.More than thirty minutes later, Jordan arrived at the gate of Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s villa.At this moment, Drew, Elle, Hailey, and others were standing at the entrance and waiting for Jordan.When they saw the ostentatious car that cost more than $100,000, they were all stunned.They then saw Ashley getting out from the driver\u2019s side before quickly going to the backseat to open the door for Jordan.They continued to watch as Jordan alighted from the car, clad in a suit.\u201cMiss Rose, wait for me here,\u201d Jordan instructed, as he buttoned his blazer.\u201cYes.\u201d Ashley bent forward and nodded respectfully.Jordan then walked towards the door of the villa.When Drew saw Jordan, he laughed out loud and mocked, \u201cHahaha, Jordan, you\u2019re so good at pretending to be a boss. Fancy you getting Miss Rose to drive you here and open the door for you. How much money did you pay her?\u201dWith folded arms, Elle\u2019s figure was accentuated. \u201cEveryone knows that you\u2019re Miss Clarke\u2019s lackey in the Ace Corporation. So what are you pretending for?\u201dJordan had long gotten used to hearing the mockery and snide remarks made by Drew and Elle. However, to his surprise, it was the first time that Hailey hadn\u2019t scolded him.Jordan glanced at Hailey with some surprise, only to realize that she was smiling at him!\u201cHehe, Rachel is right. Jordan went to Ace Corporation just to make a name for himself and impress me one day. Today, he\u2019s pretending to be successful. That\u2019s just like what Rachel guessed!\u201dHailey naturally also felt that Jordan was pretending, but she gradually understood the reason for his pretense.She knew that he wanted her to stop looking down on him!Staring at Jordan, Hailey thought to herself smugly, \u2018Jordan, I\u2019m going to take you down! Good that we\u2019re divorced now. I can marry someone compatible with me and then make you my backup!\u2019A fantastic idea emerged in Hailey\u2019s mind.The majority of beautiful women these days would have more than one backup boyfriend.Hailey didn\u2019t do that in the past,but she had been influenced by the women around her who did that constantly.Jordan didn\u2019t know what Hailey was thinking, but he didn\u2019t look at her and instead turned to Drew.\u201cCut the crap, where\u2019s the witness you mentioned?\u201dDrew said smugly, \u201cHe\u2019s inside, come with me.\u201dJordan followed Drew into the villa.In the past three years, Jordan had come to this villa more frequently than Drew and the three of them, so he was very familiar with it.However, as soon as he entered, Jordan was astonished.There were close to ten scruffily dressed men whose bodies were covered in tattoos and scars, and eyes were filled with murderous gazes!They were obviously gangsters.\u2018Strange, how did they get in?\u2019Jordan walked in curiously, and all of a sudden, an indecent-looking man who had dreadlocks, walked towards him.\u201cJordan, my friend, we meet again,\u201d the man said.Jordan glanced at him and asked, \u201cWhen did we ever meet?\u201dThe man said, \u201cYou forgot, two days ago you asked to sell your watch to me, and I bought it from you for $800,000. I\u2019m Salvatore!\u201dDrew humphed coldly and gibed, \u201cSalvatore calls the shots in Orlando! Even a high school student knows him. How can you not know who he is? I bet you\u2019re just too scared to admit that you sold your watch to Salvatore. That\u2019s why you\u2019re pretending not to know him!\u201dHearing Drew\u2019s exaggerated compliments, Salvatore raised his head smugly.Jordan could not help but feel amused. \u201cSalvatore calls the shots in Florida? Hah, is Carmelo Anthony your idol?\u201dJordan had heard such a common saying before.\u201cYes\u2026 so what!?!\u201d Salvatore didn\u2019t expect Jordan to spell out who his idol was.Jordan smiled and said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing much. I just suddenly remembered playing basketball with Lebron and Carmelo in the past.\u201dAbout a decade ago, Jordan\u2019s family often arranged for him to train with some professional players to help him build a physique like athletes.However, Salvatore refused to believe him. \u201cYou\u2019re really good at boasting, huh!?! Aren\u2019t you a hillbilly from the countryside?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough! Stop arguing!\u201dAt this juncture, Old Mrs. Camden suddenly came out from her room with her poodle in her arms.\u2018Jordan Steele, today I have to punish you according to the family rules!\u2019 Old Mrs. Camden thought to herself relentlessly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had authority and prestige, both in her family and the city.She was infuriated by the fact that Jordan had repeatedly tried to provoke her, and she was bent on making Jordan kneel down and subdue her.However, at this moment, the poodle that Old Mrs. Camden was holding in her arms suddenly leaped out of her embrace and pounced onto Jordan when it saw him.\u201cLucky!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden was astounded, and she hurriedly called out to her poodle, Lucky, but it refused to listen and sprinted towards Jordan!Jordan picked up Lucky smilingly while the latter licked Jordan\u2019s hand incessantly in joy.For the past three years, Jordan had been taking great care of Lucky as he would be the one to clean up its feces and take it to the vet for jabs whenever it fell sick.Jordan could be considered the person whom Lucky was the closest to in this family.However, that scene made Old Mrs. Camden feel incredibly embarrassed.Her beloved dog actually refused to stay with her and instead ran to Jordan, the good-for-nothing in her eyes.Seeing this, Drew said sneeringly, \u201cOh, it\u2019s true that dogs like mingling with other dogs. Well, we can\u2019t help that they share the same language.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201d Elle, Salvatore, and the others began laughing one after another.While stroking Lucky, Jordan said, \u201cI\u2019ve lived with the Camdens for three years, and now that I\u2019m back today, all of you are mocking me. Lucky is the only one who\u2019s treating me the same as before. In my opinion, some people are even worse than dogs!\u201d\u201cScoundrel, how dare you say that about us!?!\u201d Benedict snapped.Sylvie barked, \u201cGood-for-nothing! You\u2019re getting more and more unruly!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden was furious too.She barked, \u201cTrust you to have the cheek to say that! Even a dog that I\u2019ve raised for three years knows not to bite me and to wag its tail to please me, but what about you? You hit my grandson and stole my watch! You\u2019ve been raised by the Camdens in vain!\u201dJordan straightened his back and exclaimed, \u201cI didn\u2019t take your watch!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden took out the Richard Mille watch and said, \u201cThen how did this watch end up with Salvatore? This is a global limited edition watch, and each of its counterparts has an exclusive logo. There is no mistake!\u201dSalvatore walked towards Jordan smilingly and said, \u201cKid, you brought this watch to me and asked to sell it to me. You even said that you\u2019d spend the money I gave you for a one-week stay in the presidential suite of West Lake Hotel. If you didn\u2019t take those $800,000 from me, where did you get the money to stay in the hotel?\u201dSalvatore and Drew looked at each other with a smile. They had long rehearsed their lines with each other.They knew that Jordan didn\u2019t steal the watch, but they were confident that the money Jordan spent on the stay in the hotel was definitely acquired through dubious means.Jordan paused for a moment and let out a long sigh.\u2018Perhaps, it\u2019s time to let them know the truth!\u2019Jordan said slowly, \u201cI initially intended to get along with you guys as an ordinary person, but I didn\u2019t expect to end up hearing these sarcastic remarks from you guys.\u201d\u201cAlright then, I shall come clean with you guys. I\u2019m the president of Ace Corporation! I\u2019m a multi-billionaire! Is this reason good enough!?!\u201dAfter saying that, Jordan\u2019s body trembled because of how agitated he was!He knew that this truth would definitely be a massive blow to everyone, especially Hailey!He was looking forward to seeing if Hailey would regret betraying him after learning of his true identity!However\u2026\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201d\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201dEveryone except Old Mrs. Camden burst into laughter!Even Salvatore\u2019s underlings, who looked austere and aggressive, laughed out loud too.Jordan wasn\u2019t bothered.Drew clutched his stomach while laughing. \u201cDo you think you\u2019re acting in a movie? Hahaha, I can\u2019t stop laughing!\u201dElle was laughing so hard that her upper body trembled. \u201cJordan Steele, why are you so fond of pretending to be rich? If you were the president of Ace Corporation, both Hailey and I would be willing to marry you and take turns to serve you!\u201dJordan was puzzled.In fact, what he had said just now was a classic line from a famous movie.However, Jordan rarely watched movies, so he wasn\u2019t aware of it.Salvatore laughed and patted Jordan\u2019s shoulder before saying, \u201cMy friend, just stop pretending. We all know where you stand. Just obey, kneel down and kowtow to Old Mrs. Camden and Drew. Rest assured, as long as you apologize, they won\u2019t send you to prison.\u201dSalvatore was willing to make a false account because he knew that Old Mrs. Camden did not intend to hand Jordan over to the police.Hence, he wouldn\u2019t be punished by the law.At this moment, Hailey chimed in too. \u201cJordan, you\u2019ve been my husband for three years, after all. On account of what we had in the past, the Camdens won\u2019t send you to prison. You may have spent hundreds of thousands but don\u2019t worry, you can take your time to repay us in the future. All you have to do now is kneel down and admit your mistakes, then we will let you go.\u201dJordan was confused by Hailey\u2019s reaction because she stayed in the parking lot to curse her heart out for a long time after she was slapped by Victoria. Hence, he thought that she should have scolded him aggressively.\u2018Why has she become so gentle?\u2019Jordan remained firm in his stand and exclaimed, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, I wouldn\u2019t kneel down. Even if I did something wrong, you Camdens are not worthy of me kneeling down!\u201dOld Mrs. Camden slapped the table furiously.Sylvie said, \u201cCall the police, call the police, send this good-for-nothing to prison and let him serve a jail term of decades!\u201dWhen he heard them mention the police, Salvatore felt a little scared. After all, he had made a false testimony.Salvatore knew that Old Mrs. Camden just wanted Jordan to kneel down, and it didn\u2019t matter if he meant it or not.Hence, Salvatore said with a ferocious expression, \u201cYou have to kneel down even if you don\u2019t want to today!\u201d\u201cGuys, press him down and make him kneel!\u201dAt this moment, two of the gangsters standing at the door walked over, and each grabbed one of Jordan\u2019s arms. \u201cGet on your knees!\u201dJordan did not care at all about the two people who grabbed his arms. Instead, he looked at the Camdens and said, \u201cI said, you people are not worthy!\u201dIn an instant, Jordan kicked the crotch of the gangster behind him and broke free from his grasp.Jordan then used his left arm to beat them down!Salvatore exclaimed in shock. \u201cYou do have what it takes. Guys, take him on together!\u201dThe remaining eight men pounced onto Jordan together.Woof! Woof! Lucky shielded Jordan and yelled at them.Elle hurriedly carried Lucky away. For the first time, Lucky did not want to stay in her arms and instead barked incessantly.Old Mrs. Camden barked, \u201cJordan Steele, I\u2019ll give you another chance. Take the initiative to kneel down and admit to your mistake if you don\u2019t want to suffer physical pain!\u201dStaring at the eight professional fighters in front of him, Jordan sneered, \u201cI\u2019ll repeat myself.

It wasn\u2019t because he was blindly confident in himself but instead, he was well aware of the gap between professionals and amateurs.Compared to ordinary people, they could be considered professional.However, compared to those who had experienced years of bloodshed and been in close contact with corpses for a long time, they were just like newbies!Jordan had been practicing martial arts since he was a child, and he was very strong and proficient in it. However, what really made him formidable was the fact that he had a year of battlefield experience!Four years ago, which was a year before he became the live-in son-in-law of the Camdens, his family had arranged for him to stay in Syria for a year!Although the eight people in front of him often got into fights, their punches were not lethal.Those tattooed punks were alcoholics who frequented clubs every night. They ate and drank well every day, enjoying a carefree and luxurious life.The enemies Jordan met on the battlefield did not have any entertainment in their lives at all. In fact, they even struggled to stay alive, but their eyes were full of murderous intent!Those who fought with them would die right on the spot as long as they made the slightest mistake!Jordan managed to survive in such an environment for an entire year!Bang! Bang! Bang!Jordan punched each of them swiftly, causing them to fall onto the ground immediately.The remaining five men were not fools either. Two of them dashed towards Jordan from different directions but were subsequently sent flying by Jordan\u2019s kicks!However, at this moment, another person pounced onto Jordan when he wasn\u2019t keeping his guard up.At the same time, the last two remaining men grabbed one of Jordan\u2019s arms each.Salvatore said with a smile of satisfaction, \u201cI\u2019ve finally caught you.\u201dJordan smiled calmly. He might not be able to move his hands, but he could still use his mouth!On the battlefield, Jordan had once bitten off his opponent\u2019s ear during a fight!Many people fought for pride, but Jordan fought for the sake of survival!Every time he struck, it was with the purpose of killing!\u201cAh! My ear!\u201dThe underling who was clinging onto Jordan\u2019s body yelled.Jordan didn\u2019t bite down too brutally. He merely caused him to bleed before flinging him to the side. He then kicked the remaining two men onto the ground.The eight professional fighters were all beaten and sprawled onto the ground!\u201cOh my God!\u201dEveryone was stunned!\u2018How can his combat power be so terrifying!?!\u2019Old Mrs. Camden was equally astounded, and she muttered, \u201cDid the old man force Hailey to marry Jordan Steele because he knew how skilled he is in martial arts?\u201dFor the past three years, the Camdens had never understood why Old Mr. Camden insisted that Hailey marry Jordan even though he was a good-for-nothing in their opinion.Now, they finally knew that Jordan was not a good-for-nothing but a top fighter!\u201cGrandpa asked me to marry him so that he could protect me? But we\u2019re living in an era of peace now, and we don\u2019t have any enemies either.\u201dHailey began to make wild guesses about her grandfather\u2019s intentions.In fact, Hailey\u2019s grandfather had no idea that Jordan was so good at fighting and merely arranged for Jordan to marry Hailey only because the Steeles were wealthy.Herman smiled and said, \u201cNo wonder Dad favored this punk so much. It turns out it\u2019s because he\u2019s good at fighting. He should be one of the top few in the nation, huh? Benedict, congratulations on having a son-in-law who\u2019s so good at fighting.\u201dThinking that he was being complimented, Benedict said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s still something he\u2019s good at after all.\u201dHerman laughed out loud and gibed, \u201cHaha, Benedict, do you really think I\u2019m complimenting him? What\u2019s the use of being good at martial arts these days? Those who are good at fighting have all been put behind bars!\u201d\u201cAlso, do you think Dad arranged the marriage between Jordan and Hailey at the beginning? You\u2019re wrong! Dad asked for my opinion first!\u201dBenedict and Sylvie were both stunned. \u201cHerman, what did you say?\u201dHerman humphed coldly and said, \u201cBefore Dad arranged for Jordan and Hailey to marry, he first told me about a very eligible bachelor who could marry Elle, so he asked me if I was willing to allow Elle to marry sooner than expected.\u201d\u201cAt that time, Elle was only 17 years old! But I knew that Dad has always doted on me, so he won\u2019t make such an unreasonable request for no reason. Hence, I asked him who that man was.\u201d\u201cAfter I found out it was Jordan Steele, that country bumpkin, I turned him down using the excuse that Elle was too young. So, he arranged for Hailey to marry him!\u201dDrew laughed and said, \u201cSo Hailey picked up the man my sister didn\u2019t want.\u201dElle looked at Jordan and said with a look of disgust. \u201cAh, Grandpa is really old and muddled up. He actually once thought of letting me marry Jordan Steele. He\u2019s only good at fighting. I don\u2019t like such violent men. Fortunately, I was too young, and I managed to escape a disaster, hehehe.\u201dAfter hearing those words, Jordan was immediately shocked. He didn\u2019t expect that to be the story behind their marriage.Back then, the Steeles made Jordan become a live-in son-in-law of the Camdens, which was a huge favor to the Camdens.Mr. Camden Senior was the only person who knew of Jordan\u2019s real identity. Like his wife, he was biased towards his eldest son, Herman, and hence he wanted Herman to have an excellent son-in-law, Jordan.Unfortunately, Herman refused.At this time, Jordan and Hailey were looking at each other, and they couldn\u2019t help but recall the time when they first met three years ago.At that time, Jordan had just returned from the battlefield. Having gotten used to facing bloodbaths and corpses for a year, he yearned for familial warmth and love.Besides, Hailey was still a college student at that time, so she was much more simple-minded and gentle, a far cry from the unreasonable person she was now. She obviously wouldn\u2019t commit adultery.Hence, Jordan fell in love with Hailey in the first year of their marriage.Jordan didn\u2019t want to dwell on the past any further. After beating up the ten underlings, it was time to deal with Salvatore.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026 What are you doing!?!\u201dSalvatore was so frightened that he retreated continuously.However, Jordan grabbed Salvatore\u2019s hand and crippled one of his fingers on the spot as soon as he could.\u201cAh!\u201d Salvatore shrieked in pain.\u201cTell me, why did you falsely accuse me of stealing? Who put you to it?\u201d Jordan questioned menacingly.Salvatore was indeed worthy of being a gang leader. Although he was good at fighting, he was also a real man.\u201cBeing a gangster, I\u2019ve long gotten prepared to die at any time! If you have the guts, kill me! But I must remind you that Mr. Pablo was the one who trained me. You can ask around to find out about his power and forces in the nearby cities. You\u2019ll definitely regret it if you go against me!\u201dDrew began to panic a little, fearing that Salvatore would expose him. \u201cJordan Steele, stop! Are you trying to kill someone in Grandma\u2019s house!?!\u201dJordan let go of Salvatore and kicked him to the side.\u201cI repeat, I have not stolen from you. If you have concrete evidence, by all means, report me to the police. Don\u2019t say that you\u2019re not calling the police for my sake and that you can\u2019t bear to let me go to prison. Please!\u201dAfter saying that, Jordan turned around and left.Woof! Woof!Lucky the poodle leaped out of Elle\u2019s arms and bit the hem of Jordan\u2019s trousers, refusing to let him go.Jordan picked up Lucky and placed it back inside Elle\u2019s arms. While stroking its head, he said, \u201cIn my eyes, you are the only thing belonging to the Camdens, that is worth stealing.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Drew was grateful to Salvatore for keeping his lips sealed and not exposing him even when he got beaten up just now.\u201cSalvatore, you\u2026 Are you alright?\u201d Drew asked with a look of embarrassment.Salvatore flew into a rage when he saw Drew. \u201cPunk, how dare you give me such a tough job!?! You must give me $150,000 more and compensate for the medical expenses of my underlings!\u201dDrew said, \u201cMoney is not a problem, as long as you can teach Jordan Steele a hard lesson. Salvatore, are you going to have him killed?\u201dSalvatore waved his hands and said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take care of this for you. I\u2019m rushing for time. I have to get going now!\u201dSalvatore drove away quickly in a commercial vehicle.After leaving the villa neighborhood, Salvatore spat some saliva out of the window. \u201cDamn it, Drew Camden is such a fool. If I still have underlings now, why would I take action personally for the sake of earning $800,000 from you?\u201dIn fact, all of Salvatore\u2019s shops had been seized, and he was already penniless.However, Salvatore was bent on taking revenge after being humiliated in public and having his finger broken by Jordan.\u201cBook me a ticket to Thailand immediately!\u201dSalvatore was going to go look for Pablo!\u2026Jordan returned to the office and held a meeting in the conference room that only the top management executives could attend.The meeting was mainly meant for a discussion to decide if they should invest in the Camdens\u2019 top-class private residence project or not.The top management executives, including Victoria, basically agreed to invest 11 million dollars into the project.Firstly, it was because it wasn\u2019t a large sum of money for the company. Secondly, it was because it was a promising project with good prospects. They were confident that once the residences were built, it would definitely attract the top-tier families in Orlando and other cities.Ace Corporation also planned to add a clause in the sales contract that stated that the condition to buy one of the residences was to go into business cooperation with Ace Corporation.Ace Corporation owned many businesses, many of which did not have much competitive power. Hence, if they could get the help of those top-tier family businesses, it would definitely be a significant enhancement.Hence, not only would the project benefit the Camdens, but it was also favorable for the interests of Ace Corporation.Since Jordan was the one who proposed the project, there was no need for him to veto his own idea.Jordan was seated in the president\u2019s seat in the conference room.\u201cOkay, since everyone agrees, let\u2019s officially start cooperating with Landmark Realty from now on. Victoria, tell the Camdens\u2026 Inform Landmark Realty to send someone over and give me a detailed explanation of this project. I\u2019d like to check on them and see how prepared they are.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll inform them right now,\u201d Victoria said.After the meeting ended, Victoria immediately called Herman.As of this moment, the Camdens were still in the villa discussing whether Mr. Camden Senior had forced Hailey to marry Jordan because of his excellent martial arts skills.Herman was highly excited to pick up Victoria\u2019s phone call.\u201cMom, Miss Clarke just called me to say that the president of Ace Corporation has agreed to invest 11 million dollars in our project! But I have to meet him in person to discuss the project and demonstrate how well-prepared we are.\u201dOld Mrs. Camden was extremely excited too. \u201cGreat, cooperating with the Ace Corporation would be a huge leap forward for us and Landmark Realty!\u201d\u201cHerman, you must perform well and leave a good impression on Mr. Steele so that we can continue cooperating with them in the future!\u201dHerman said, \u201cYes! I will definitely perform well in front of Mr. Steele!\u201dElle whispered, \u201cDad, take a closer look at Mr. Steele. I heard that he is young and handsome, unlike most presidents of established companies.\u201dSeeing how gleeful Elle looked, Hailey knew that she must be harboring designs on him.\u201cElle, no matter how handsome Mr. Steele is, he\u2019s already attached. Have you forgotten that Miss Clarke and Mr. Steele are lovers?\u201dElle rolled her eyes and said, \u201cWhat does that have to do with you? They\u2019re just lovers. They\u2019re not married yet. Besides, I\u2019m younger than Victoria Clarke, and I have a better figure too. Why can\u2019t I snatch Mr. Steele from her?\u201dDrew chimed in to speak up for his sister. \u201cExactly, I support Elle too. Hailey, I heard that Victoria Clarke slapped you, so you should support Elle now that she wants to snatch her boyfriend!\u201dEven Old Mrs. Camden nodded in approval too. \u201cElle is right! Brilliant men are scarce in this world, and you must snatch what you want. Elle, go with your father to meet Mr. Steele at Ace Corporation.\u201d\u201cAh! Really? Thank you, Grandma! You\u2019re the best!\u201dElle jumped up excitedly and pecked Old Mrs. Camden on her wrinkled face.Benedict and his family seemed extremely disgruntled.Hailey was clearly the one who proposed the top-class private residence idea. Yet, Herman was appointed as the person in charge.Hailey said indignantly, \u201cI want to go too.\u201dSylvie hurriedly spoke up for her daughter. \u201cYeah, let Hailey go too. Putting aside her competency, Hailey is the most beautiful girl in this city! Besides, she\u2019s now divorced, and she got slapped by that bitch Victoria Clarke. I support the idea of having Hailey snatch Mr. Steele away from Victoria Clarke!\u201dElle scoffed and said scornfully, \u201cWill you please look in the mirror? Why would Mr. Steele marry a divorced woman?\u201dOld Mrs. Camden also spoke up for Elle. \u201cElle is right. Hailey might be more beautiful, but I plan to help Elle get together with Mr. Steele. Hailey, you\u2019d better make do with that Tyler Collins.\u201dWhen she was cheating on her husband, Hailey was proud to have found a man like Tyler who was compatible with her.However, compared to Mr. Steele, Tyler seemed to be inferior.Soon, Herman and his daughter, Elle, arrived at Ace Corporation together.Due to the fact that Jordan was meeting other clients at the time, he told Ashley to arrange for them to wait in the meeting room and instructed her not to serve them any drinks.The Camdens, especially Herman, were extremely mean and malicious to Jordan.Since they had arrived on Jordan\u2019s territory, he definitely wouldn\u2019t serve them with good hospitality.In the meeting room.Elle was dressed in a skin-tight dress that accentuated her figure while making her look elegant, enchanting, and irresistible to men.However, Elle seemed displeased with the dress as she asked, \u201cDad, why did you make me wear this dress? It might show off my curves, but it covers up the other parts of my body. Don\u2019t you know how great my figure is? Hmph.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, your fashion sense mustn\u2019t be tacky.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve just met Miss Clarke and her secretary, Ashley Rose. Do you remember how they dressed?\u201dElle was a vain girl, so she obviously remembered what they wore.Elle nodded and said, \u201cThey both wore the same kind of outfit, consisting of a white shirt paired with a black skirt, but that secretary\u2019s skirt was even shorter than Victoria Clarke\u2019s knee-length skirt.\u201dHerman nodded and said, \u201cThe difference in the length of their skirts is what sets them apart. Victoria Clarke obviously has a better figure than Ashley Rose, but as the deputy president, she had to dress more presentably.\u201d\u201cThe same goes for you. You have to make yourself look classy and elegant. Only then will Mr. Steele cherish you.\u201dThinking that Herman made a lot of sense, Elle said, \u201cThanks, Dad, I\u2019ll definitely snatch Mr. Steele back from Victoria Clarke!\u201dHerman nodded his head in gratification. Once his daughter could get married to the president of Ace Corporation, Old Mrs. Camden would value Herman, his wife, and his children more.When the time comes, the Camdens\u2019 assets worth close to hundreds of millions of dollars and the position as the next helmsman of the company would undoubtedly belong to Herman!Just like that, the two of them remained seated for more than ten minutes.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t they serving us any coffee or tea? Is the hospitality of Ace Corporation so bad?\u201dElle\u2019s mouth was getting a little dry from talking, and only then did she realize that the secretary didn\u2019t serve them any drinks.Elle couldn\u2019t contain her anger any longer, and she opened the door to yell at Ashley, \u201cMiss Rose, we\u2019d like to have two cups of tea.\u201d\u201cAlright, please wait a moment.\u201dAshley agreed, but after more than ten minutes passed, she still hadn\u2019t served the tea yet.\u201cThis is infuriating! That secretary was just patronizing me!\u201d Elle exclaimed, stomping her feet furiously.Not wanting Elle\u2019s mood to be affected, Herman comforted, \u201cWhen you become the president\u2019s wife, just fire her. Simmer down, Mr. Steele may come in at any moment.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dElle immediately got back into her elegant sitting posture, smiling like a dignified lady.Just like that, half an hour passed.\u201cDad, I can\u2019t keep up with this anymore. It\u2019s too tiring to sit like a demure lady. This is exhausting. Why isn\u2019t Mr. Steele here yet?\u201dElle laid down on the sofa and put her legs up too.Herman took a glance at Elle\u2019s sloppy posture, which was unbearable to look at, and shook his head. \u201cIt seems Mr. Steele doesn\u2019t value us. He even made us wait for an hour.\u201dAt this moment, Jordan pushed the door and entered.When Jordan saw Elle placing her feet on the couch despite wearing high heels, he couldn\u2019t help but interject.\u201cElle, I know you behave very casually at home, but why are you so casual when you\u2019re outside too? Didn\u2019t your father tell you that it\u2019s vulgar to behave like this?\u201dAfter Elle heard the door getting slammed shut, she was so frightened that she hurriedly tucked her legs in and started sitting in a ladylike posture again.After Jordan saw it, he added, \u201cWell, it\u2019s the first time in three years that I\u2019ve ever seen you wearing a dress that covers so much of your body. I didn\u2019t expect you to be able to look like a demure lady.\u201dHerman had undeniably picked out a suitable outfit for his daughter.If Jordan did not know Elle before this, he would have definitely gotten a good impression of her during their first meeting. He would even want to get to know her better.Hearing Jordan\u2019s compliment, Elle said with a look of disgust, \u201cGet lost, stop ogling at me. I didn\u2019t wear this dress for you. I know you\u2019re harboring designs on me because you heard my father say today that Grandpa intended for you to marry me back then.\u201d\u201cBut, how can a country bumpkin like you be worthy of a shining star like me? You\u2019re not even worthy of Hailey Camden, let alone me.\u201dAlthough Elle was very feminine, Jordan never had any designs on him in the past three years.\u201cElle, you misunderstood. I just thought\u2026\u201dElle hurriedly snapped without giving him a chance to speak at all. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to even think about it!\u201dJordan shook his head helplessly and sat down to look at Herman without bothering about her at all.However, before he could speak, Herman said to Jordan, \u201cJordan, you\u2019re just a bodyguard. What are you doing up here? Where is Mr. Steele?\u201dPreviously, Jordan had already told them that he was the president of Ace Corporation, but they didn\u2019t believe him, so he didn\u2019t bother to repeat it.Jordan said, \u201cYou are here to discuss the project regarding the top-class private residences, right? You may just speak to me.\u201dHerman said disdainfully, \u201cSpeak to you? What\u2019s the point of that? You\u2019re a lowly bodyguard and a loser who only knows to resort to violence. Do you know anything about the project? Do you even know anything about business?\u201dJordan was enraged too. \u201cThat means you don\u2019t want to discuss, huh? Alright, I\u2019ll leave now.\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Elle suddenly pulled Jordan to stop him, taking him by surprise immediately.Elle smiled kindly and asked, \u201cJordan, don\u2019t go, let me ask you something. You have been Victoria Clarke\u2019s bodyguard for the past two days, so you should be familiar with the relationship between her and Mr. Steele, right?\u201dJordan nodded and said, \u201cI do understand some of it.\u201dElle continued asking smilingly, \u201cWell then, can you tell me how close Victoria Clarke and Mr. Steele are? Do they live together? Do they live in Mr. Steele or Victoria Clarke\u2019s place?\u201dJordan knew that Elle was a blabbermouth who would spread the word about everything.Previously, when Victoria said that she and Jordan were lovers, it had already affected his reputation. Hence, he wanted to take this opportunity to let Elle spread the word and let more people know that he had nothing to do with Victoria.Jordan said, \u201cThey\u2019ve broken up.\u201dHis answer didn\u2019t embarrass Victoria. He didn\u2019t deny that he and Victoria were lovers, but he also managed to restore the fact he was single.After hearing his answer, Elle and Herman were so agitated that they were about to cry.\u201cBroke up? They broke up? Hahaha\u2026\u201d Elle laughed out loud.Herman smacked his thighs in excitement and exclaimed, \u201cHeaven is really helping us! Heaven is helping our family!\u201dJordan asked in confusion, \u201cWhy are you two so happy about the fact that they\u2019ve broken up?\u201dElle smiled and got back into her dignified sitting posture, with one leg atop the other. She looked all lofty and noble.\u201cJordan\u2026 I mean, Jordy.\u201dJordan was dumbfounded. \u2018Why did Elle give me a nickname? What is she getting up to?\u2019Elle said, \u201cJordy, on the account that you used to be my cousin-in-law, I\u2019ll give you a chance to serve me, the future wife of your boss. Go bring me some tea!\u201d\u2018Wife of my boss?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019re now an employee of Ace Corporation, aren\u2019t you? That makes Mr. Steele your boss, and his future wife is your former cousin-in-law, who\u2019s also my daughter, Elle!\u201d\u201cMy family and I intend to let Elle marry Mr. Steele so that we can have a marriage alliance with the Ace Corporation. If things work out between them, you\u2019ll be somewhat associated with us again. Haha, you\u2019re really fated with the Camdens.\u201dJordan looked at Elle in surprise and asked, \u201cElle, are you that confident that Mr. Steele will take a liking to you?\u201dIt had only been a few days since Jordan had escaped from the clutches of the Camdens by divorcing Hailey, and now, Elle had set her sights on him!\u2018What have I done to deserve to be pestered endlessly by the Camdens?\u2019Elle humphed coldly and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no man in this world who won\u2019t be attracted to me! I\u2019ve always been chaste and never had a boyfriend before. As long as I make the first move, Mr. Steele will definitely fall in love with me!\u201d\u201cAlso, I\u2019ve always suspected that Mr. Steele is the person who sent us the 1 million dollar bracelet on the day of Grandma\u2019s birthday banquet! I plan to investigate and find out more about this. Maybe Mr. Steele has been a fan of mine for a long time!\u201dJordan smiled as he didn\u2019t expect his former cousin-in-law to be so confident in herself.Although, he reflected on it carefully and realized that it made sense for her to be that narcissistic. She had numerous fans on social media and received romantic messages from at least a thousand men every day. Any woman would be conceited if they were in her shoes.Hearing that Elle had mentioned the matter of the birthday gift again, Jordan said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to investigate anymore. That bracelet is indeed a gift from Mr. Steele.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dHearing Jordan\u2019s words, Elle leaped up with excitement and grabbed Jordan\u2019s clothing.She asked excitedly, \u201cIs that true? Is that true? Is it really a gift from Mr. Steele? I knew it. My intuition was right! Dad, did you hear that? Mr. Steele is really fond of me!\u201dHerman was too elated for words.\u2018The president of Ace Corporation has given such a hefty gift to the Camdens. He obviously did it to impress Elle!\u2019Herman said joyfully, \u201cI really didn\u2019t expect that the president of Ace Corporation would be my future son-in-law! I must tell my mother about this when I get home. She\u2019d definitely be over the moon!\u201dJordan looked at Herman and humphed in disdain.\u2018The president of Ace Corporation was married to a Camden for three years, but none of you have ever been good to him!\u2019\u2018You want me to marry a Camden again? You must be dreaming!\u2019Eager to meet Mr. Steele, Elle grabbed Jordan\u2019s clothes tightly and asked, \u201cWhere is Mr. Steele now? I want to see him.\u201dJordan answered, \u201cHe\u2019s having a chat with some clients in the meeting room.\u201dGiven how spacious the Ace Corporation was, it wasn\u2019t strange for there to be more than one meeting room.Hence, Elle didn\u2019t dwell on it further and instead asked, \u201cWhy is he taking so long? Are the clients challenging to deal with?\u201dJordan nodded and said, \u201cYes, the clients are a man and his daughter. The man is a snob while his daughter is a pretty girl dressed to the nines and is now seducing Mr. Steele. I doubt he\u2019d be able to excuse himself soon.\u201dElle was enraged after hearing his words. \u201cWhat a cheap woman! How dare she be so shameless in the presence of Mr. Steele\u2019s company!?! It\u2019s no wonder Mr. Steele has been keeping us waiting for such a long time. Which room are they in? I\u2019m going to go give that bitch a tight slap now!\u201dHerman hurriedly pulled Elle back to stop her. \u201cDon\u2019t be impulsive! You can\u2019t leave a bad impression on Mr. Steele! We\u2019d better stay here and wait a little longer.\u201dJordan shot them a disdainful glance and left without saying anything.After a while, Ashley walked over and said to them, \u201cMr. Camden, Miss Camden, something cropped up for Mr. Steele, and he has left the office. He would like for you to take your leave.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dBoth of them, who had been waiting for an entire hour, were a little disappointed.\u201cDid Mr. Steele say when he would be free? Will he come to the office again in the afternoon?\u201d Herman asked.Ashley shook her head and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure either.\u201d\u201cAlright then.\u201dHerman and Elle left feeling somewhat disappointed, but their trip to the Ace Corporation wasn\u2019t entirely fruitless.At the very least, they found out that Mr. Steele was the one who had given Old Mrs. Camden that birthday gift that cost over a million dollars!As soon as they left the office building, Herman made a call home and asked all the Camdens to gather at old Mrs. Camden\u2019s villa.Benedict and Sylvie hadn\u2019t left yet, while Hailey had already left but was asked to return.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? I just left, and you asked me to go back again. Have they clinched the deal?\u201dHailey rushed over, still holding her car key in her hand.Elle glanced proudly at Hailey, who had arrived late, and only after seeing that everyone was present did she say, \u201cIt\u2019s not about the contract. I have a piece of good news to announce to all of you. The person who gave Grandma that 1.5-million-dollar bracelet is Mr. Steele, the president of Ace Corporation!\u201d\u201cWhat? It\u2019s from Mr. Steele?\u201d Benedict was in disbelief.Hailey felt a little upset because ever since she learned that Jordan had stolen from the Camdens, she really thought that the bracelet was a gift from Jordan.Sylvie gibed, \u201cHow is that considered good news? Mr. Steele and Miss Clarke are lovers, and Miss Clarke has always been close to our family. What\u2019s so strange about him sending us a gift too?\u201dHerman laughed and said, \u201cSylvie, Mr. Steele, and Miss Clarke broke up with each other a long time ago! If he sent that bracelet on Miss Clarke\u2019s behalf, why did he send it as a separate gift? He could have placed his gift together with Miss Clarke\u2019s.\u201dIt was common for married couples and lovers to share a gift.On that day, it seemed that Victoria didn\u2019t know that Mr. Steele would be sending the Camdens a gift day either.Sylvie muttered, \u201cYou mean\u2026\u201dElle said conceitedly, \u201cIs there still a need to ask? Mr. Steele must have given Grandma a gift for my sake! At that time, Hailey was still married to Jordan!\u201dAfter hearing this, old Mrs. Camden said with a heartened smile, \u201cThat makes sense! I already knew that the person who sent the gift must be Elle\u2019s suitor, but I didn\u2019t expect him to be the president of the Ace Corporation! Lady Luck is smiling at us!\u201dElla replied obediently, \u201cGrandma, I will nurture my relationship with Mr. Steele well in order to help our family progress toward becoming a top-tier family in the city!\u201dGrinning widely from ear to ear, Old Mrs. Camden caressed Elle\u2019s face adoringly. \u201cExcellent, my granddaughter is so capable!\u201dHer words were like daggers to Hailey\u2019s heart.Her grandmother had never once ever praised her for the hard work she had done for the Camdens over the past few years.Hailey questioned, \u201cWho did you hear those words from? Is the information credible?\u201dElle said, \u201cYour ex-husband is the one who said it. Of course, it\u2019s credible!\u201d\u201cGrandma, Mr. Steele was too busy to meet us this morning. I\u2019ll head to the Ace Corporation on my own this afternoon to look for him again. Don\u2019t worry about the contract. I can handle it alone!\u201dElle made a promise to the Camdens.\u201cGreat!\u201d Old Mrs. Camden praised merrily.Feeling proud and smug, Elle said to Hailey conceitedly, \u201cHailey, if you have nothing this afternoon, be my chauffeur for the day and send me to Ace Corporation!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yet, she openly requested that Hailey ferry her around like a chauffeur, right in front of everyone!Elle had already begun to think of herself as the future wife of the president of Ace Corporation, so she had already developed a sense of superiority over the rest of the Camdens.She felt that Hailey would have to rely on her in the future.However, Hailey had always been prideful and arrogant, so she obviously couldn\u2019t tolerate such humiliation!Hailey refuted furiously, \u201cI\u2019m swamped! I don\u2019t have the time to send you there!\u201dAfter saying that, she turned around and left the villa. She then drove off in her car resentfully.Being a poor driver, to begin with, she accidentally drove into a tree.Fortunately, her car was not severely damaged since she was driving slowly, and she did not suffer any injuries.\u201cUgh, this is so infuriating and annoying!\u201dHailey slammed both her hands against the steering wheel repeatedly as tears flowed freely from her eyes non-stop.In a fit of anger, she hurriedly whipped out her cell phone to give Jordan a call.At this time, Jordan was still at the office, and it surprised him to see that it was a call from Hailey.\u201cHello.\u201dJordan waved his hand at Ashley, signaling for her to leave his office, after which he answered the call.Hailey questioned emotionally, \u201cJordan, let me ask you something. Since you pretended to be the person who gave my grandmother that bracelet for her birthday, why didn\u2019t you keep pretending?\u201d\u201cWhy did you tell Uncle Herman and Elle the truth!?! Do you know how badly embarrassed you caused me to be in front of my family?\u201dJordan thought that Hailey had called to apologize to him, but he didn\u2019t expect to be questioned about that matter.In fact, Jordan had never changed his statement, and he had been telling the truth all this while.The bracelet was a gift from Jordan Steele and also a gift from the president of Ace Corporation.Well, it was because Jordan was the president of Ace Corporation.Jordan had clearly told the Camdens about his real identity, but they had been looking down on Jordan and were too stuck-up to believe him.Jordan said coldly, \u201cI\u2019m swamped. I don\u2019t have the time, nor am I in the mood to care about whether you were embarrassed or not. If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll hang up now.\u201dJordan had already divorced Hailey, so her affairs had absolutely nothing to do with him!The only thing Jordan wanted to hear was an apology from Hailey and nothing else!\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Hailey hurriedly exclaimed. She continued in a mellower voice, \u201cI called you because I need a favor from you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want Elle\u2019s relationship with your boss, Mr. Steele, to develop too well. Elle will be going to the office building of Ace Corporation this afternoon. She\u2019s developed a penchant for black tea lately, so serve her a cup of black tea laced with laxatives so that she\u2019ll get the runs.\u201d\u201cAlternatively, pretend to accidentally rip her dress when she walks past you. You\u2019re so strong, she won\u2019t suspect you.\u201dJordan humphed coldly. \u201cHailey Camden, you\u2019re too greedy. You cheated on me while we were married, and not only have you not apologized, you\u2019re now asking me for a favor.\u201d\u201cIf you need a favor, go look for your lover instead of bothering me!\u201dAfter saying that, Jordan hung up the phone.Jordan decisively refused to help Hailey.Even if he wanted to help her, he wouldn\u2019t lace Elle\u2019s drink with laxatives or anything like that because he didn\u2019t intend to see her at all.\u2026At two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Elle arrived at the floor that the president\u2019s office was on in the Ace Corporation\u2019s building.Due to the large size of Ace Corporation, the corporation assigned different employees to different floors. The floor that Jordan\u2019s office was on was considered the floor where all the core departments were.They stationed the offices of all the senior executives of Ace Corporation and their respective assistants and secretaries on the same floor.The other employees of the company had never met Jordan before.Hence, Elle\u2019s efforts were futile when she asked several employees of Ace Corporation for a photo of the president of the company before her arrival.\u201cMiss Camden, you\u2019re here.\u201dAshley was the first to greet Elle.Elle shot Ashley a condescending glance, still mad at her for not serving her any tea during her visit in the morning.Elle said, \u201cTake me to the meeting room.\u201dHowever, Ashley refuted, \u201cMiss Camden, I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019d better take your leave.\u201dIt stunned Elle for a moment, and she asked, \u201cWhy? Is Mr. Steele going to be away all afternoon?\u201dAshley shook her head and explained, \u201cThat\u2019s not the case. Mr. Steele said that you\u2019re too gorgeous, and he might get distracted by your beauty and forget about work if he discusses the contract with you.\u201d\u201cSo, he\u2019d like someone else from your family to meet him instead.\u201d\u201cSomeone else?\u201dElle was a little dejected at first, but she was dumbstruck and pleased with his reason for refusal.\u201cDid Mr. Steele really\u2026 compliment my beauty? Does he\u2026 know what I look like?\u201dElle blushed coyly.Ashley nodded and said, \u201cYes, Mr. Steele follows your account on TikTok, and he watches your videos all the time.\u201dElle was even more conceited after hearing that. \u2018Mr. Steele is indeed one of my admirers!\u2019Elle said, \u201cWell then, I think it\u2019s not a good idea to talk to Mr. Steele about work on our first meeting either. I\u2019ll have someone else from my family replace me then.\u201d\u201cUm, Miss Rose, please tell Mr. Steele that he may ask me out for some coffee or to the movies whenever he\u2019s available.\u201dAshley answered, \u201cI\u2019ll definitely relay your message to him.\u201dSeeing that there was quite a massive change in Ashley\u2019s attitude towards her, Elle said, \u201cWalk me to the elevator.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAshley did as she was told.Seeing that there was no one else around, Elle whisked out a wad of cash from her Louis Vuitton embroidered purse and shoved it to Ashley.\u201cSend me a picture of Mr. Steele!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She wouldn\u2019t disobey his orders simply for some money.Ashley hurriedly shoved the money back to Elle and refuted, \u201cMiss Camden, I do not have a photo of Mr. Steele. However, I can tell you that he is very handsome and around your age.\u201dHearing the words \u201cvery handsome,\u201d Elle\u2019s heart began to flutter with joy.Although her request to discuss the contract with Jordan had once again been turned down, the beautiful but foolish and boy-crazy Elle left gleefully.\u2026Bangkok, Thailand.Salvatore arrived by plane and met up with his boss, Pablo Dalton.Due to Pablo\u2019s involvement in some underground businesses in Bangkok and his recruitment of many fighters, he had been traveling frequently to and from Southeast Asia for the past few years.Pablo drank some alcohol under the dim lights of a small gymnasium where an underground boxing match was taking place, while cheering on his fighter in the ring.\u201cMr. Dalton,\u201d Salvatore said respectfully when he arrived beside Pablo\u2019s seat.Pablo ignored Salvatore until the boxing match ended.He then looked at Salvatore joyfully and asked, \u201cSalvatore, why did you come here all the way from Orlando? Did something happen?\u201dSalvatore nodded. Seeing that Pablo had taken a sip of liquor, he hurriedly picked up the bottle to fill Pablo\u2019s cup to the brim.\u201cYou\u2019re so wise, Mr. Dalton. I\u2019ve indeed encountered some trouble in Orlando, and I need your help.\u201dPablo took out a cigar and sniffed it before saying, \u201cThere has been a strict ban on the industry of vices lately, and I reckon most of your shops have been seized. I bet you have less than a hundred underlings left, don\u2019t you?\u201dPablo was the one who groomed Salvatore, so he naturally knew that the latter used to have hundreds of subordinates.Salvatore continued to nod. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Mr. Dalton, I only have ten underlings left, but today, a young rascal named Jordan Steele crippled them.\u201dPablo smiled and was just about to cut his cigar. Still, after hearing Salvatore\u2019s words, he flew into a rage and smashed the cigar cutter against Salvatore\u2019s head!\u201cYou f***ing idiot! I thought you\u2019d at least have seventy or eighty underlings left, but it turns out you only have ten left! You even let someone cripple them!?! I handed hundreds of underlings to you before I left Orlando back then, but you failed to keep a single one alive and well!\u201dStill unsatisfied after smashing the cigar cutter against Salvatore, Pablo gave him another hard slap on his head.Salvatore didn\u2019t dare to dodge and merely let Pablo continue hitting and lashing out at him.After Pablo simmered down, Salvatore picked up the cigar cutter and cut the cigar for Pablo.He said, \u201cNot only have my shops been seized, but many other businesses of mine also haven\u2019t been running smoothly. Besides, now that takeout deliverers, taxi drivers, and social media content creators are such lucrative jobs, many underlings have decided to switch to another industry. It\u2019s good enough to still have ten.\u201dWhile smoking the cigar, Pablo nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019ve long known that the times have changed and the world is no longer like how it used to be when I was younger. In that era, we used to be able to thrive just by winning some brawls and fights.\u201d\u201cThe hooligans these days are all good-for-nothings who can\u2019t put up a fight. It\u2019s not surprising that all ten of your underlings had been crippled.\u201d\u201cAny random fighter of mine can easily beat up ten of your underlings. Do you know what the reason is?\u201dSalvatore said humbly, \u201cMr. Dalton, please educate me.\u201dPablo said, \u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re living too comfortably. When you\u2019re living a comfortable life of luxury, why would you bother fighting hard? Only when you\u2019re suffering from poverty will you be able to exert your full fighting spirit!\u201d\u201cWe are a group of individuals who live in darkness, and there\u2019s no room for us to survive in broad daylight. Hence, two years ago, I left Orlando to shift my focus to these places in Southeast Asia where poverty is prevalent.\u201d\u201cI already have more than two thousand underlings here, and each of them can defeat ten people at a time!\u201dFull of admiration for Pablo, Salvatore said, \u201cIf only I was half as smart as you, I wouldn\u2019t have been reduced to such a terrible plight that I\u2019m in today. Mr. Dalton, please let me take a hundred of your underlings back with me and avenge our brothers!\u201dPablo glanced at Salvatore coldly and said, \u201cJust like you, I\u2019m an orphan, but I\u2019m less educated than you are. I managed to have the mindset and achievements that I do today, all thanks to Mr. Reyes, who groomed me.\u201dSalvatore had always heard about Mr. Reyes from Pablo, but he never had the chance to meet him.\u201cSpeaking of Mr. Reyes, I haven\u2019t visited him for a long time.\u201dIt was apparent that Pablo indeed respected Mr. Reyes greatly as he quickly put down his cigar and picked up his cell phone to call him.\u201cMr. Reyes, I\u2019m not disturbing your rest, am I?\u201d Pablo asked with a respectful expression.Salvatore watched from the side, eager to hear how the voice of his boss\u2019s boss sounded.Pablo said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m planning to go back to Orlando in the next couple of days to handle some matters. I haven\u2019t visited you in a long time, so I prepared some gifts, and I intend to visit you soon. Are you in town?\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019re in Orlando? That\u2019s great. I\u2019ll book a flight back to Orlando now to see you right away, Mr. Reyes!\u201dAfter hanging up, Pablo exclaimed merrily with a wide grin on his face, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that Mr. Reyes is in Orlando now!\u201dSalvatore was highly excited, too. \u201cReally? I\u2019ve heard you mention Mr. Reyes several times over the past few years, but I haven\u2019t had the chance to meet him. You must introduce me to him this time.\u201dSmack!Pablo slapped Salvatore and rebuked, \u201cMr. Reyes is of noble status. He\u2019s not someone whom an incompetent good-for-nothing like you can meet! Even I need to make an appointment in advance to see Mr. Reyes! Book a flight immediately. I\u2019m going to visit Mr. Reyes and at the same time deal with that punk Jordan Steele whom you mentioned.\u201dSalvatore exclaimed, \u201cYes, Mr. Dalton!\u201d\u2026In the evening, Elle returned home and told her parents about what happened this afternoon.Herman laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019m surprised Mr. Steele said that he wouldn\u2019t be able to talk about work seriously if he keeps staring at you. Elle, it seems Mr. Steele is smitten with you.\u201dElle was lying on the couch with a sheet of a facial mask on her face. She said smugly, \u201cThat goes without saying.\u201dAfter some thought, Herman said, \u201cSince Mr. Steele wants someone else to discuss the contract with him, Drew shall take your place.\u201dDrew was texting Salvatore at the moment. He just received a text from Salvatore saying that Jordan would get beaten into a pulp tomorrow.Drew smiled and said, \u201cSure, it happens that I\u2019m planning to go look for that good-for-nothing tomorrow.\u201dThe following morning, Pablo and his 100 underlings, whom he had brought over from Bangkok, arrived at the villa where Mr. Reyes lived.Fearing he might disturb Mr. Reyes\u2019 rest, Pablo stood respectfully at the door from 5 a.m. all the way to half-past seven in the morning.A maid walked out of the villa and said, \u201cMr. Reyes would like you to enter.\u201dOnly then did Pablo, who had always been high up in the air, walk in slowly.As soon as he saw Mr. Reyes, Pablo put down his gifts and knelt on the ground to greet him. \u201cMr. Reyes!\u201dMr. Reyes took a seat and glanced at him. \u201cIt\u2019s you, Pablo. You\u2019re a boss yourself. You don\u2019t have to get on your knees. Get up.\u201dPablo continued kneeling and said excitedly, \u201cI managed to come so far today, all thanks to your efforts in grooming me, Mr. Reyes. I will never forget your kindness! By the way, Mr. Reyes, haven\u2019t you been in England for the past two years? Why did you suddenly return to Orlando?\u201dMr. Reyes said, \u201cMr. Steele Senior sent me here to assist Mr. Jordan.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In case I fail to recognize him and end up offending him, I\u2019d be in hot soup.\u201dMr. Reyes sighed helplessly and said, \u201cOrlando is so clean. It\u2019s going to be filthy once you come here.\u201dAfterward, he instructed his subordinate to send Pablo a photo.The person in the photo was none other than Jordan!Mr. Reyes was actually the butler of the Steeles, Frank.Although he was just a butler, he had learned about investing from Jordan\u2019s grandfather over the years and thus amassed a fortune worth billions.Moreover, over the years, Butler Frank had helped groom many people, and Pablo happened to be one of them.When Pablo saw the photo of Jordan, he immediately praised him. \u201cMr. Jordan is so handsome! I can tell at a glance that he\u2019s the scion of a wealthy family! I really hope that I can have the honor of meeting him one day!\u201dMr. Reyes said coldly, \u201cMr. Jordan is on a training mission that his family has assigned to him, don\u2019t disturb him. I\u2019ll call you when I need you.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Pablo answered respectfully.\u2026In the office building of Ace Corporation.Drew arrived in Jordan\u2019s office early and bright in the morning, and he waited in the meeting room for two hours.Just like when his father, Herman, visited for the first time, Drew didn\u2019t get to meet Jordan, nor was he even served a glass of water.\u201cWhat exactly is this Mr. Steele trying to do!?! He clearly fancies my younger sister, Elle, but he\u2019s so aloof towards me. These scions of top families are really so damned eccentric!\u201dAfter taking another look at his chat history with Salvatore, it suddenly reminded Drewof the fact that Jordan was working as a bodyguard in Ace Corporation, or so he thought. He then gave Jordan a call.In the president\u2019s office, Jordan got shocked from seeing Drew call him on his mobile.Of course, he knew Drew was waiting in the meeting room of his company and being stood up by him.Jordan thought, \u2018Does he finally believe that I\u2019m the president of this company?\u2019\u201cHello,\u201d Jordan answered the phone.To his surprise, Drew said condescendingly, \u201cJordan, you\u2019re in the office building now, right? Come to the meeting room.\u201dHearing Drew\u2019s condescending tone, Jordan knew that he still wasn\u2019t aware that he was the company\u2019s president. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have dared to speak to him that way.Jordan wasn\u2019t going to meet him as the company president. Still, he was willing to go to the meeting room to meet Drew as the former live-in son-in-law of the Camdens, just to see what the latter would say.Upon arriving at the meeting room, Jordan looked at Drew and asked, \u201cWhat do you want to see me for?\u201dDrew asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s your boss, Mr. Steele?\u201dJordan looked at Drew and said, \u201cMr. Steele is speaking to a retard now.\u201dDrew burst into laughter and said, \u201cI, too, reckon that guy is a retard! He\u2019s actually taking up so much of Mr. Steele\u2019s time.\u201dJordan thought to himself, \u201cDrew Camden, you retard, I was referring to you!\u2019\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d Jordan asked with a smile.Seeing how smug Jordan was, Drew snapped in displeasure, \u201cJordan, you\u2019re just a bodyguard, but why are you all dressed up like a president of a company? What are you pretending for?\u201d\u201cAlso, you beat me up in front of so many bigwigs in Orlando. I\u2019ll definitely settle the score with you!\u201dJordan said, \u201cI know. Didn\u2019t you get Salvatore to frame me? Unfortunately, your dear Salvatore couldn\u2019t avenge you.\u201dDrew humphed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be overly conceited. Salvatore has brought over 100 expert fighters from Southeast Asia under his boss, Pablo Dalton! Jordan, don\u2019t blame me for not reminding you, but be careful on your way home after work and don\u2019t get too drunk at the club! Lest you get beaten into a pulp! Hahaha!\u201dJordan gave it some thought. He had been getting off work together with Victoria lately, and he didn\u2019t want her to get hurt, though he wasn\u2019t afraid of facing those fighters himself.Hence, Jordan said, \u201cIs that so? It just so happens that I\u2019m itching to throw some punches. Get those fighters under Salvatore or Pablo to come straight to the parking lot of the office. They don\u2019t have to go to the trouble of mobbing me after I get off work.\u201dDrew perked up immediately and exclaimed, \u201cSure! I\u2019ll hold you to your word and ask Salvatore to send his underlings here now! If you have the guts, go downstairs to the parking lot and wait there with me now!\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d Jordan nodded gladly.\u2018Elite fighters from Southeast Asia?\u2019Indeed, most of them were a little more ruthless than the fighters here because things were more chaotic in their nation after. However, the environment they were trained in was definitely not as brutal as the battlefield where Jordan had been.When they arrived at the underground parking lot, Drew took Jordan to a corner and then picked up a brick to smash all the surveillance cameras in the vicinity.Afterward, Drew said smugly, \u201cHaha, now that the surveillance cameras are destroyed! There will be no evidence even if you get killed here!\u201d\u201cIs that so? That means there won\u2019t be any evidence of me beating you to death here either, right?\u201d Jordan said with a gleeful smile.\u201cYou\u2026 What are you trying to do?\u201d Drew was so shocked that he took a step back.Smack!Jordan slapped him hard and burst into laughter. \u201cDrew Camden, are you stupid? You called some fighters to come and hit me, but do you think I won\u2019t beat you up before they arrive?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Drew shrieked.After Jordan had been hitting Drew for a while, they finally heard Salvatore\u2019s voice.\u201cLet go of Mr. Camden!\u201d Salvatore walked over with ten tan-skinned men.Drew hurriedly scurried over to Salvatore and hid behind him. Pointing at Jordan, he barked, \u201cJordan, I\u2019m going to cripple you today and make sure that you can no longer become a bodyguard!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bang! Bang!Smack! Smack! Smack!The sounds of violent fighting could be heard.Salvatore was astounded by the fact that Jordan could defeat the ten of them alone!Salvatore picked up his cell phone and called Pablo.\u201cMr. Dalton, you have to send ten more people over. The ten fighters you send will probably last for another ten minutes before Jordan Steele cripples them.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAt this juncture, Pablo had just finished playing chess with Butler Frank.After hearing Salvatore\u2019s words, he exclaimed excitedly, \u201cThere\u2019s actually an expert here who can defeat ten people on his own? I must take such a talented man under my wing!\u201d\u201cTell me where you are now. I\u2019ll be right there!\u201dPablo rushed over quickly.By the time he arrived at the parking lot, the first ten experts he had sent were all lying on the ground.On the other hand, Jordan\u2019s clothes were a little tattered, but he wasn\u2019t injured.Pablo was instantly stunned, and he hurriedly walked towards Jordan in surprise.As he approached Jordan, the look of horror on Pablo\u2019s face intensified too.\u201cIt turns out Jordan Steele\u2026 is\u2026\u201dWhen Pablo saw Jordan\u2019s face, he fell to his knees and exclaimed, \u201cMr. Jordan!\u201dJordan looked identical to the man in the photo that Butler Frank had sent to Pablo!At this moment, Drew, Salvatore, and others all froze in shock.\u201cMr. Dalton, what are you talking about? He is the live-in son-in-law of our family. Why are you kneeling in front of him?\u201d Drew asked.Salvatore asked in confusion, too, \u201cDid you mistake him for someone else?\u201dPablo ignored both of them and looked at Jordan respectfully.\u201cMr. Jordan, I am Mr. Reyes\u2019 subordinate, and I\u2019m very sorry for what happened today. Please punish me!\u201dIt surprised Jordan that he was Butler Frank\u2019s underling.After saying that, Pablo instructed Salvatore to go over. \u201cGood-for-nothing, hurry up and kneel down in front of Mr. Jordan!\u201dNot daring to hesitate, Salvatore immediately knelt down and kowtowed to Jordan.\u201cMr. Jordan, I\u2019ve offended you. Please have mercy and forgive me!\u201dDrew, who was at the side, was stunned. The gang leader, Salvatore, was actually kowtowing to Jordan and begging him for forgiveness!\u201cOkay, enough, I don\u2019t want others to think that I\u2019m a gangster.\u201dSince they were in the underground parking lot of the company\u2019s office building, Jordan was afraid that such a scene might affect his image.Jordan said, \u201cSalvatore, you don\u2019t have to kowtow to me. You just need to explain clearly to the Camdens that I didn\u2019t sell that watch to you.\u201dSalvatore hurriedly said, \u201cYes, I will tell the Camdens that Drew Camden was the one who instructed me to frame you.\u201d\u201cHey, Salvatore, you can\u2019t betray me!\u201dDrew tried to pull Salvatore back and stop him, but Salvatore put him down with a single punch.At that moment, Pablo walked over with a murderous expression on his face, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who made false allegations against Mr. Jordan? Someone, come here and throw him into the river!\u201dKnowing how ruthless Pablo was, Drew was so terrified that he hurriedly begged Jordan for mercy.Drew knelt in front of Jordan and hugged his thighs.\u201cJordan, we\u2019re a family. You can\u2019t let him do this to me!\u201dJordan kicked Drew away and hollered, \u201cI\u2019m not your family!\u201dDrew continued to crawl over and hug Jordan\u2019s thigh.\u201cJordan, I know my mistakes. Please forgive me. I can let you have Elle, don\u2019t you fancy her very much?\u201dFeeling embarrassed, Jordan slapped Drew on his face.\u201cI\u2019ve always treated her as my younger sister. When did I ever fancy her!?!\u201dDrew continued, \u201cHow about I arrange for a family dinner tonight, get Hailey drunk and send her to your place?\u201dJordan gave him another slap on his face and berated, \u201cYou scoundrel, Hailey, and Elle are your cousin and sister, respectively. How can you give them away like they\u2019re gifts? How are you so inhumane?\u201dDrew dared not retort.Seeing that Drew was terrified, Jordan said, \u201cDrew Camden, I can let you go, but when you go home, you must explain to your family clearly that you had been framing me.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes, thank you, Jordan!\u201dDrew got up and hurriedly left.After Drew left, Pablo knelt down before Jordan once again. He said, \u201cMr. Jordan, I would like to offer all 100 elite fighters whom I\u2019ve brought with me from Southeast Asia to you!\u201dJordan nodded. \u2018These gangsters from abroad are going to be of some use in the future.\u2019For example, I can deal with that \u201cfood industry giant\u201d Zack.\u2026In Old Mrs. Camden\u2019s villa.\u201cDrew, why is your face injured? Did that bastard Jordan beat you up again?\u201dOld Mrs. Camden was heartbroken to see that Drew\u2019s injuries had worsened.Drew quickly denied, \u201cI got injured when I accidentally ran my car into something. It has nothing to do with Jordan.\u201dHe then looked at Old Mrs. Camden and Benedict\u2019s family. \u201cGrandma, Uncle Benedict, actually, Jordan didn\u2019t steal that Richard Mille watch. I was the one who took it and accused Jordan of stealing it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Old Mrs. Camden asked in shock.Both Benedict and Sylvie were astounded too.Still very protective of her grandson, Old Mrs. Camden said, \u201cSince you\u2019ve falsely accused him, so be it. Jordan Steele isn\u2019t that innocent either. Even if he didn\u2019t steal from me, he might have stolen from someone else. Otherwise, how could he have had the money to stay in a five-star hotel?\u201d\u201cBy the way, Drew, did you get to meet Mr. Steele at Ace Corporation today?\u201dDrew shook his head.With a look of bewilderment, Old Mrs. Camden asked, \u201cWhat exactly is that Mr. Steele trying to do? Does he want me to meet him personally before he\u2019s willing to discuss the deal with us?\u201dAt this moment, Hailey suddenly said, \u201cGrandma, why don\u2019t I give it a try?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, Herman and his family took over the project because he had a higher status among the Camdens than Hailey.Now that the president of Ace Corporation had repeatedly declined to meet Herman and his children, Hailey felt like giving it a try.Elle gibed scornfully, \u201cMr. Steele refuses to meet any of us. Why would he agree to meet you? You\u2019re taking yourself too seriously.\u201dStanding at the side, Sylvie spoke up for her daughter, \u201cLet Hailey give it a shot. She was the one who came up with the idea of this project anyway.\u201dOld Mrs. Camden, whose name was Diana, thought about it and realized that there was no other solution at the moment. She could either go herself or let Hailey go on her behalf.Diana said, \u201cAlright, Hailey, make a trip to Ace Corporation. If it still doesn\u2019t work out this time, I\u2019ll go visit Mr. Steele myself! In short, we have to cooperate with Ace Corporation at all costs!\u201d\u2026Hailey arrived at the Ace Corporation\u2019s office building at two o\u2019clock in the afternoon.She was dressed in a thin, white-colored sweater paired with a red checkered skirt and a Swarovski necklace. It was a pure, girl-next-door outfit.\u201cMiss Camden, please wait in the meeting room for a while. Mr. Steele is busy at the moment.\u201dAshley brought Hailey to the meeting room and poured her a glass of water.That was precisely what Hailey wanted because she didn\u2019t like drinking complicated beverages. Her favorite drink was plain water with honey because, in her opinion, drinking water was the best way to maintain a good complexion and skin.In the past three years, she would ask Jordan to make her a cup of honey water every single morning.After getting divorced, Hailey had no choice but to do it herself. Whenever she made herself some honey water, it would remind her of Jordan.Ashley went to the president\u2019s office, where Jordan and Victoria were both in.Ashley said, \u201cMr. Steele, Hailey Camden is here.\u201dVictoria waved her hand and asked Ashley to leave. When she saw the apparent changes in Jordan\u2019s expression, Victoria asked, \u201cDo you want to see her?\u201dJordan said, \u201cHerman, Elle, and Drew Camden came to negotiate the contract today, but I declined to meet all of them. If I turn Hailey down too, the Camdens will definitely think we are just making a fool out of them.\u201d\u201cSince we have decided to cooperate with them, let\u2019s give them the 11 million dollars as agreed. Victoria, bring the contract over here.\u201dVictoria handed the contract to Jordan, who then brought it with him to the meeting room.Jordan saw Hailey as soon as he opened the door, and the moment he did, he felt as if it was a lifetime ago that they last met.Jordan was very familiar with Hailey\u2019s outfit today because it was her favorite outfit that she often wore at home too.Jordan also liked how she looked when she wore that outfit because it made her seem very pure, just like the shy and innocent college student she was when they first met\u2026He had to admit that regardless of whether he hated her now or not, he was attracted to her looks and sense of fashion.Her beauty was something that Elle could never compare to regardless of how many skin-tight dresses she wore.However, Jordan wasn\u2019t there to admire how beautiful his ex-wife was. Thus, he entered the room, closed the door, and then said to her, \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201dHailey Camden nodded and said, \u201cYes. Mr. Steele must be very busy, isn\u2019t he? I guess he won\u2019t be able to meet me soon. You may sit down and have a chat with me.\u201dJordan said with a smile, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for me to chat with you about.\u201dHe then threw the contract onto the table in front of Hailey and said, \u201cTake a look at the contract, and if there\u2019s nothing wrong with the terms, you may just sign it. The sum of 11 million dollars will be disbursed to your company\u2019s bank account in three separate transactions within a week.\u201dHailey Camden exclaimed in surprise, \u201cHas Mr. Steele already agreed? I thought he\u2019d need to find out more about the project before he\u2019d be willing to invest money in it!\u201dHailey opened the document gleefully, only to see the words \u201cHailey Residences\u201d printed in capital letters at the top of the first page of the contract!Hailey exclaimed in astonishment, \u201cHailey Residences!?! How could that be the name?\u201dHailey was very familiar with the name \u201cHailey Residences.\u201dMore than six months ago, Jordan decided to name the project \u201cHailey Residences\u201d because he had come up with the idea of the project for her. Hence, he, of course, wanted to name the project after her.Jordan thought then that even if the Camdens opposed him, he would use his own assets to build \u201cHailey Residences\u201d once his three-year assignment as Hailey\u2019s live-in husband ended.Who would have thought that Hailey would cheat on him later on?However, even so, Jordan wanted to retain the name of the project.Jordan said coldly, \u201cWhy? Don\u2019t you like it?\u201dHow could Hailey not like it!?!In the future, the most wealthy families in the city would reside in residential properties named after her. She\u2019d be incredibly proud of that!However, when Hailey told her family about the project\u2019s name at that time, Diana outright rejected it. At the same time, Herman said blatantly, \u201cHailey Camden is not fit to have the project named after her.\u201dAt this moment, Hailey was so elated that she was about to burst into tears of joy. She stood up and said, \u201cJordan, you must have begged Mr. Steele to give the project that name, right? You wouldn\u2019t\u2026 have gotten down on your knees and begged him, would you?\u201dHailey was deeply moved, and she knew that Jordan had to have had something to do with this because it was impossible the president of Ace Corporation would have heard of the name \u201cHailey Residences.\u201dFor the first time in these three years, Hailey held Jordan\u2019s hand and said in a gentle voice, \u201cThank you, Jordan.\u201dJordan had complicated emotions while touching her tender hands.It\u2019s been three years, three years since he married Hailey, but he had never touched her hand before.After touching her hand for the first time, it surprised him to find out how smooth and tender it was.However, he pushed her hands away and said, \u201cNo, Mr. Steele just likes the name Hailey a lot, so he decided to use it.\u201dSeeing that Jordan was in denial, Hailey smiled and insisted, \u201cYou must have begged Mr. Steele desperately before he agreed. Why do you deny it? I know you still love me.\u201dNot wanting to talk about it anymore, Jordan said, \u201cCut it out, sign the contract.\u201dHailey was also worried that he might go back on his word. If she succeeded in clinching the contract, her grandmother would be pleased with her.Hailey signed the contract quickly and stamped it with the official seal of Landmark Realty.The contract was duplicated, so Jordan grabbed his copy and turned around to leave.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Hailey called out to Jordan, \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that you begged Mr. Steele to use the name \u2018Hailey Residences.\u2019 How about I treat you to lunch today? Where would you like to go to eat? How about that favorite restaurant of yours\u2026 called\u2026 what is it? Duck and Noodles?\u201dJordan turned around and said, \u201cNo, thank you, I\u2019m busy. I don\u2019t have time for lunch with you. Also, that place is called Chicken and Noodles, not Duck! We\u2019ve been there so many times, but you can\u2019t even remember the name of the restaurant. It seems that you didn\u2019t love me at all.\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d Hailey lost her temper again. \u201cI was nice enough to go to such a horrible place with you so many times! If you don\u2019t want to go for lunch, forget it, I\u2019ll go for steak with Tyler!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Being a member of a prestigious family, Hailey was sensible enough to focus on the bigger picture.\u201cMiss Camden.\u201dVictoria nodded at Hailey with a smile.After a simple greeting, Hailey left very quickly.On the other hand, Jordan was gripping the contract tightly in his hand as if he was trying to rip it apart.Jordan had always thought that he would no longer care about Hailey since they had already gotten a divorce.However, when he heard her say she would have a meal with Tyler just now, he still felt rather uncomfortable.Victoria sought to win Jordan\u2019s heart, whom very few knew was a tycoon, and thus had been trying to use her favorable position as his close subordinate to her advantage.Since Jordan\u2019s ex-wife had come to see him today, Victoria naturally wanted to know what they had talked about.When she saw how upset Jordan was, Victoria knew that Jordan must still harbor strong feelings for his ex-wife. She reckoned that it would probably be challenging for her to take advantage and come in between them anytime soon.It would probably take a long time for her to conquer Jordan\u2019s heart.Victoria said, \u201cIf Hailey Camden has angered you, you can just tear up the contract and decide not to cooperate with the Camdens.\u201dJordan gradually loosened his grip on the contract and said, \u201cI won\u2019t go back on my word.\u201dVictoria knew that Jordan was a man of his word who took his promises very seriously, which was also one of the attributes she admired him for.\u201cMr. Steele, I just accidentally overheard your conversation with her. Well, you know how much I love food, and I\u2019m always curious when it comes to nice restaurants. Where\u2019s that restaurant you guys mentioned just now? Can you take me there?\u201dVictoria wanted to take the opportunity to get closer to Jordan while he was being upset with Hailey.She knew that Jordan definitely wouldn\u2019t turn her down if she asked him out for a meal at this juncture.Having dated so many men, Victoria had long gained enough experience in dealing with them and winning their hearts.She knew that men are all impulsive and vindictive. Since Hailey had the guts to say that she would be having a meal with another man, Victoria was confident that Jordan would certainly find another woman to accompany him for a meal.Sure enough, Victoria\u2019s guess was correct.\u201cI\u2019ll take you there,\u201d Jordan said slowly.An hour and a half later, the two arrived at a relatively secluded street on the city\u2019s outskirts, which was clean and wide with very few people.There were many empty parking spaces along the roadside, so they managed to park the car soon upon arrival.After alighting, Jordan asked, \u201cThis is not a five-star restaurant. It\u2019s just an ordinary one. I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t like the food here.\u201dVictoria said with a radiant smile, \u201cIts price does not determine the deliciousness of the food. I really enjoy street food like hot dogs that cost a couple bucks each too. Mr. Steele, I\u2019m not a spoiled brat who only patronizes expensive places.\u201dJordan smiled. He could tell that in order to succeed, Victoria had relied almost entirely on her own talents rather than her family, and he surmised that she must have endured many hardships.She was indeed different from the majority of pretty and wealthy women.When they were walking towards the restaurant together, Victoria suddenly held onto Jordan\u2019s hand.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Steele, there\u2019s a huge puddle of water at the entrance, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d Victoria explained.\u201cOh.\u201dJordan felt that it wouldn\u2019t be nice to turn her down, so he held her hand as well, and they walked into the restaurant together like a couple.Jordan thought to himself emotionally, \u2018For the past three years, I\u2019ve been trying to walk into this restaurant with Hailey, hand in hand, but she refused to let me hold her hand every single time. Today, I finally got to know what it feels like to hold her hand.\u2019Jordan was not a Saint but an ordinary man with feelings too. Of course, he would want to have Hailey, especially since she was so beautiful and his lawfully wedded wife.Jordan wished he could have Hailey, but the truth was that even Tyler had gotten intimate with Hailey before, but Jordan never had the chance!\u201cMr. Steele\u2026 you\u2019re hurting me,\u201d Victoria reminded.It turned out that Jordan was holding Victoria\u2019s hand so tightly that it was causing her pain.Jordan hurriedly snapped out of his trance and apologized, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Victoria, you can just call me by my name when we\u2019re not in the office.\u201dAfter entering the restaurant, Jordan ordered the signature dish, chicken noodles, and a few other dishes. They then proceeded to get seated.After sitting down, Victoria realized that Jordan had remained silent with a stern expression on his face. She asked, \u201cJordan, what\u2019s on your mind? You seem to be out of sorts.\u201dJordan poured himself a glass of water and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dAs he sipped on the water, Jordan looked out of the window. He thought, \u2018Hailey Camden should be enjoying a candlelit dinner with that scoundrel Tyler Collins, huh? Maybe I should get Pablo to break Tyler Collins\u2019 member!\u2019Jordan had indeed thought of doing so, but the person at fault was Hailey, and even if she didn\u2019t cheat on him with Tyler, she would have cheated with another man.When a woman decides to be unfaithful to her husband, she cannot be stopped.\u2026In a Starbucks branch of a certain shopping mall in the city center of Orlando.\u201cRachel, I\u2019m here!\u201dHailey was seated by the window, and she waved at her best friend, Rachel Quinn.She didn\u2019t actually ask Tyler out for a meal, and she had merely said that to Jordan because she wanted to spite him.Rachel didn\u2019t come alone. There was a handsome young man beside her who was roughly about only 20 years old.With a height of more than 1.8 meters, he was suave and just as dashing as the hottest young male celebrities.Rachel was holding onto his arm while walking over.\u201cThis is Hailey.\u201dRachel took a seat and introduced Haily to the hunk.He was very polite as he greeted, \u201cNice to meet you, Hailey.\u201dHailey returned the greeting with a smile, \u201cHello, handsome.\u201dAfterward, Rachel ordered him, \u201cGet me a coffee and after you do, go do some window shopping here or something. I\u2019ll call you again once we\u2019re done chatting.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d he agreed and left obediently.That made Hailey green with envy. She asked, \u201cRachel, who\u2019s this young hunk? Did you just get to know him recently? Have you slept with him?\u201dRachel took her cell phone out of her purse and said smugly, \u201cOf course I have.\u201dHailey said, \u201cYou\u2019re really amazing. This is the third one you\u2019ve slept with since you got married, right?\u201dRachel extended four of her fingers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m so envious of you, you have your husband wrapped around your finger, and you get to date so many other men without him finding out. Why did I get caught during my first try? I even ended up in a divorce! This is infuriating!\u201dRachel laughed and said, \u201cWell, what sets us apart is that your ex-husband is a delivery man while my husband is a businessman. He goes on business trips every so often. He\u2019s seldom in town. So, he doesn\u2019t have the time to catch me cheating at all, hehe.\u201d\u201cBy the way, what did you ask me out all of a sudden?\u201dHailey took out her copy of the contract and handed it to Rachel.It stunned Rachel to see it. \u201cWow, darling, you actually clinched a deal with Ace Corporation on behalf of your family, and they even named the project after you! Wonderful. How did you do it? Did you sleep with the president of Ace Corporation?\u201dFeeling somewhat speechless, Hailey said, \u201cSeriously, don\u2019t think of me as such an easy woman, okay? Am I such a loose woman?\u201dRachel gibed smilingly, \u201cYeah, you slept with Tyler Collins all for the sake of roping in an investor for your family\u2019s business, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so irritating!\u201dHailey tossed her scrunchie at Rachel.\u2026In the president\u2019s office of Ace Corporation on the very same evening.Jordan was having a meeting with Steve Williams, a restaurant chain owner in Orlando.Steve was a restaurant mogul who was second only to Zack Smith and the latter\u2019s longtime business rival.However, Steve had never been able to beat Zack regarding business tactics and family background. Hence, he was second-best in the industry.However, all the restaurants owned by Steve had excellent decor and strategic locations.Many of the outlets were right opposite Zack\u2019s restaurant chain, making them stiff competitors for many years.During Diana\u2019s birthday celebration, Zack was one of the guests who swore to make sure that Jordan would never make a living as a service staff again in the future.Although Jordan did not have any feud with Zack before that, he had to pay Zack back in his own coin since he wanted to drive him to a dead end.Jordan handed Steve a cigarette and said, \u201cMr. Williams, I would like to take over all your restaurants in Orlando, and I guarantee I can defeat Zack Smith within two months. And I will even ensure that he loses his foothold in Orlando. Name your price.\u201dSteve\u2019s motivation to compete was waning as he was in his fifties. He just wanted to earn more money for his son and for the sake of a happy retirement.After thinking about it for a long time, Steve said, \u201c10 million dollars, I\u2019ll let you take over all seven of my restaurants in Orlando for 10 million dollars!\u201dJordan agreed without the slightest hesitation, \u201cDeal!\u201dAfter purchasing the seven restaurants, Jordan immediately called Butler Frank.\u201cHave the best graphic designer in the country come up with the perfect logo for the Cloud Cafeteria and have all seven of my restaurants put up the signboard overnight, once the design is finalized. I\u2019ve sent you the addresses of these seven restaurants. I also want you to hire some of the most popular singers at the moment.\u201dButler Frank was on standby 24/7 in Orlando. \u201cYes, Mr. Steele!\u201dAt 8 am the following morning.There were many people gathered outside a cafeteria in downtown Orlando.They were all raising their heads and looking at the signboard of the cafeteria\u2014Cloud Cafeteria!The font of the words was domineering yet beautiful.The most astonishing thing was the material it was made of, which many could not deduce.The words seemed to be floating in the air!\u201cThe cafeteria has had a change of name. Could it belong to the same owner of that \u2018Sunny Restaurant\u2019 across the street?\u201d\u201cI know, the owner is named Zack Smith! Mr. Smith is so rich. He has acquired yet another restaurant!\u201d\u201cHe must have spent a ton of money on this. So cool and grand! I\u2019ll have dinner here tonight!\u201dAt this moment, a Mercedes Benz sedan was being driven over slowly, and Zack Smith, the top restaurant mogul of Orlando, was seated on the backseat.Zack\u2019s most famous restaurant was located across the street from Cloud Cafeteria. He had arrived bright early in the morning.The reason being last night, Tyler called him to inform him that he would be booking the entire floor of the restaurant for a marriage proposal.Zack had come to the restaurant personally and instructed the staff members to make preparations and create the perfect ambience for Tyler\u2019s proposal.He was surprised, however, to find a large crowd outside the cafeteria opposite his restaurant when he inadvertently glanced out of the window.\u201cRay, why is there such a large crowd gathered across our restaurant? Pullover here. Let\u2019s go down and take a look.\u201dZack said to his chauffeur.\u201cYes, Mr. Smith!\u201dRay quickly pulled over by the road and walked across the street with Zack.Many people soon recognized Zack before he reached the cafeteria.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t this Mr. Smith? Mr. Smith, you\u2019re really impressive. You managed to acquire the restaurant of your longtime business rival and even gave it such a nice name. The signboard is remarkable too!\u201dZack looked up and finally saw the signboard that seemed to be floating in the air!\u201cWhat?\u201dZack got a great shock because the cafeteria\u2019s name had been changed to one that was of a similar theme to his!\u2018Is this an attempt to use my brand for fame?

There\u2019s no need to bother. I can guarantee that Cloud Cafeteria will fold within a week!\u201d\u2026Two hours later.Tyler had just gotten out of bed and was holding a beautiful Tiffany ring box elatedly.It contained an exorbitant diamond ring that he had spent a large amount of money on.He decided to propose to Hailey today!Last night, Elle called Tyler to say that the president of Ace Corporation had taken a liking to Hailey.That made Tyler feel a sense of crisis, and he made up his mind to win Hailey\u2019s heart as soon as possible!When Tyler managed to get through to Hailey, he said, \u201cBaby, are you busy at the moment? Shall we have lunch together?\u201dHailey answered, \u201cI can\u2019t make it for lunch. I\u2019m now the deputy director of the Hailey Residences project, and I have plenty of things to take care of. Let\u2019s have dinner instead.\u201dDiana was thrilled to know that Hailey had successfully clinched the contract.However, Diana appointed Hailey and her father as deputy directors and Herman as director.Tyler said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s have dinner then. I\u2019ve made a reservation for two at Sunny Restaurant, which is near your office.\u201dHailey paused for a moment before saying, \u201cIn downtown Orlando? Since we\u2019re going there, why don\u2019t we dine at Cloud Cafeteria instead?\u201d\u201cCloud Cafeteria? Is there such a restaurant?\u201dAs Tyler was preparing to propose to Hailey, he didn\u2019t have time to scroll through Twitter or look at the group chats with his friends where everyone was talking about the new restaurant in town.Hailey said, \u201cSeems like you\u2019re not very well-informed. The restaurant opposite Sunny Restaurant had a name change overnight, and it\u2019s now called Cloud Cafeteria. It has an eye-catching signboard, and Travis Scott will perform his hit single at the restaurant tonight. I know you listen to his music all the time.\u201d\u201cDamn it! Are you serious? If Travis Scott is really going to perform there, we have to have dinner there tonight!\u201dTyler hung up the phone and called Zack, but his number was often engaged. Hence, Tyler decided to just drive there.When he arrived at the entrance of Cloud Cafeteria, Tyler was dumbfounded.\u201cCloud Cafeteria! It\u2019s so grand and opulent! Zack is really something. He acquired yet another restaurant and hired so many popular singers. I shall propose to Hailey in Cloud Cafeteria tonight!\u201dThinking that Cloud Cafeteria belonged to Zack, Tyler reckoned that it didn\u2019t matter which one he patronized since both restaurants were owned by Zack. Hence, he entered Cloud Cafeteria with great pleasure.\u201cHello, sir, are you here to make a reservation?\u201dA waitress took the initiative to come forward and asked.Tyler looked at the waitress and found that she was quite pretty, polite, and presentable.He had no idea that the waiters and waitresses of Cloud Cafeteria were sent to Orlando overnight by Butler Frank. Their service quality and mannerisms were a notch higher than other average service staff.Tyler nodded and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been here before. I\u2019d like to first take a look at the environment.\u201dThe waitress hurriedly introduced, \u201cPlease come with me, Sir. Let me introduce you, the first floor is where the ordinary tables are, and these ornaments here are expensive pieces that our boss has bought from various places. Now, please follow me to the second floor.\u201d\u201cThe private rooms are all on the second floor to the fifth floor, and there\u2019s a variety of sizes available. Sir, for how many are you making a reservation for?\u201dTyler extended two fingers.The waitress said, \u201cIn that case, a small room should be enough for you.\u201dHowever, Tyler scoffed and exclaimed, \u201cSmall room? Hah, girl, I intend to book the entire floor! Besides, I\u2019ve already given your boss a deposit!\u201d\u201cHuh? I didn\u2019t hear him mention such a thing,\u201d the waitress asked in shock.They were still accepting reservations at the moment, so the boss would have definitely informed them if someone had booked the entire floor.Tyler said condescendingly, \u201cYou can call your boss to confirm. My name is Tyler Collins.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe waitress immediately dialed Jordan\u2019s phone number. She said, \u201cMr. Steele, there\u2019s a man named Tyler Collins who claims to have booked a floor of our restaurant. He also mentioned that he had given you a deposit. Is that true?\u201d\u201cNone of that sort. Tell him to get lost.\u201dJordan replied furiously as soon as he heard Tyler\u2019s name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Our boss hasn\u2019t accepted your deposit. Please leave.\u201dAlthough Jordan told her to tell Tyler to get lost, she was just a service staff and didn\u2019t dare to be rude to him.\u201cWhat? That scoundrel Zack Smith is not trying to go back on his word, is he?\u201dTyler appeared embarrassed.The waitress said, \u201cZack Smith is not the name of our boss.\u201dOnly then did Tyler realize that Cloud Cafeteria didn\u2019t belong to Zack!At this moment, Zack called and asked, \u201cMr. Collins, I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019ve been busy just now. What did you call me for? Please rest assured, I\u2019ve already set up the venue for your proposal. Will you be coming in the afternoon or the evening?\u201dTyler began to hem and haw. \u201cUm\u2026 Mr. Smith, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t make it. I\u2019m really sorry, my girlfriend suddenly wants to have dinner elsewhere.\u201dSlightly disappointed, Zack said, \u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll refund the deposit to you.\u201dAfter hanging up, Tyler looked at the interior design of Cloud Cafeteria smilingly. He discovered an artificial stream in the middle of the second floor and beautiful petals flowing on the surface of the water. There was also a private room.The roof of the room could be opened to make it an open-air dining space.Tyler walked over and said, \u201cThis is a good spot. I\u2019ll take it!\u201dThe waitress said, \u201cSorry, Sir, but a customer has already booked this room for $15,000 because there\u2019s a singer who will be performing here tonight, so it\u2019s costly.\u201dSpending $15,000 on a reservation for a meal at a restaurant was considered expensive, but $15,000 was peanuts to Tyler.Tyler took out a $1000 gift card from his wallet and handed it to the waitress. \u201cGive me that customer\u2019s number.\u201d\u2026At 7pm, Tyler drove his BMW 7 Series to the restaurant and parked his car in the parking lot that Jordan had just purchased.He then walked in together with Hailey.At this time, the first to fifth floors of Cloud Cafeteria were already crowded with people.On the contrary, there was no one in Sunny Restaurant because all the patrons had decided to go to Cloud Cafeteria instead.The influence of a famous singer was powerful.Tyler and Hailey came to the second floor.Pointing to the particular spot, Tyler said, \u201cHailey, I spent $90,000 to book this seat! The singer will be performing here later. If it were a concert, this would be considered a VVIP seat!\u201dHailey said, \u201cSpending $90,000 for a meal is too extravagant, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHailey had a habit of eating very little at dinner because she was afraid that she would gain weight if she over ate.Tyler chuckled and said, \u201c$90,000 is like nine bucks to us. Hahaha, don\u2019t worry.\u201dHearing Tyler boasting about his wealth, Hailey smiled and said, \u201cEven if you\u2019re rich, you shouldn\u2019t squander your money like that.\u201dTyler said, \u201cYes, yes, after we get married in the future, I\u2019ll let you hold the pursestrings and manage my hundreds of millions worth in assets, okay?\u201dHailey couldn\u2019t help but look forward to it when she heard the words \u2018hundreds of millions\u2019.At this moment, Jordan, Victoria, and Ashley also came to this floor.\u201cHey, Jordan, Miss Clarke, and Miss Rose, what a coincidence.\u201dTyler greeted the three of them with a smile when he saw them.Jordan and Hailey exchanged glances without greeting each other, both feeling a little awkward.Tyler asked, \u201cMiss Clarke, which room are you guys headed to?\u201dVictoria answered, \u201c307.\u201dTyler frowned when he heard that. \u201cThird floor? The view of the performance won\u2019t be great from that position. I spent $90,000 on the private room in the middle. Miss Clarke, why don\u2019t you join us during the performance later?\u201dVictoria sneered and said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. Jordan and I initially planned to have dinner there, but I don\u2019t like the song that Travis Scott\u2019s going to perform, so we\u2019ve decided to go upstairs.\u201dAs the owner of the restaurant, Jordan naturally had the priority to choose.The private room that Tyler went to great lengths to book was actually the one that Jordan didn\u2019t want to dine in.Just like Victoria, Jordan wasn\u2019t interested in the song that was going to be performed tonight.However, it was one of the hottest hits now. Jordan knew that it would definitely appeal to the patrons here, so he decided to invite Travis Scott.If it was a fine dining restaurant, a classical music performance would be more suitable.That was actually part of Jordan\u2019s plan.He would set up a range of food establishments from cafeterias that were well-liked by the people to fine dining and restaurants serving international cuisines. Jordan wanted to monopolize the food industry of Orlando!At this time, Hailey remembered the last time Jordan helped her and thought that he still loved her deeply.She said to Jordan, \u201cJordan, you can join us here during the performance later.\u201dTyler didn\u2019t expect Hailey to invite her ex-husband, Jordan, to the room, and he certainly didn\u2019t want Jordan to join them. However, he pretended to be magnanimous.\u201cYeah, Jordan, you\u2019ve probably never been so up close to a rapper in a live performance before. I\u2019ll do you a favor and let you take a photo with Travis after the performance so that you can show it off on Instagram. Haha.\u201dTyler was an ignorant fool who didn\u2019t even know that Jordan was the one who invited the rapper.Jordan ignored Tyler and said to Hailey, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, you guys take your time and enjoy.\u201dAfter saying that, he headed upstairs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What a coincidence!\u201dThe man seemed to know Victoria.Victoria was also a bit surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s you, Mr. Crews. Are you here for dinner too? I remember that you usually dine at Sunny Restaurant.\u201dVictoria knew Mr. Crews, a close friend of Zack, and would often dine at Zack\u2019s restaurant.Mr. Crews said, \u201cWell, my son insists on watching Trey Scott or whoever that is, perform, so he made me come here.\u201dVictoria smiled. She believed that many of the patrons tonight were people who had been coerced into having dinner here by their children.The reason being, most teenagers and young people who liked listening to Travis Scott could not afford to book a private room or dine at this restaurant. Besides, it was commonplace for parents to indulge their children these days to generally give in to their children\u2019s requests and take them wherever they wanted.Therefore, Jordan chose to invite a singer who was popular among young people and not middle-aged folks.Mr. Crews glanced at Jordan beside Victoria and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201dVictoria looked at Jordan, whose identity as the company president was still kept a secret to the public and known only to the C-level executives of partner companies. Hence, Victoria didn\u2019t dare to introduce him.Seeing this, Jordan put his arm around Ashley\u2019s shoulders and said, \u201cI\u2019m Ashley\u2019s boyfriend.\u201dAshley was so flattered and surprised that she almost jumped up and leaped into Jordan\u2019s arms.\u2018I wish Mr. Steele would keep holding me like this\u2026\u2019Ashley really wanted to pin Jordan beneath her at this moment.Upon sight of that gesture, Mr. Crews laughed and said, \u201cSo he\u2019s Ashley\u2019s boyfriend, I see. I can tell that Miss Rose and this young chap here are very much in love with each other.\u201dAfter exchanging a few more pleasantries, Jordan and the two ladies headed inside the private room and closed the door.Ashley had great self-awareness and didn\u2019t think of herself as Jordan\u2019s girlfriend anymore. Hence, she immediately poured some water for Jordan and Victoria as soon as they entered.Victoria said, \u201cAll the seats are filled in Cloud Cafeteria today, and the reservation slots for the rest of the week are almost full. Meanwhile, there are now less than twenty customers in Zack Smith\u2019s restaurant across from us. Some of them might even be his friends whom he had invited.\u201dAshley, too, raised her arm and exclaimed, \u201cMr. Steele, you\u2019re awesome! You completely defeated Zack Smith, and you\u2019re going to monopolize the restaurant industry of Orlando!\u201dLooking at Ashley\u2019s adorable behavior, Jordan smiled and then said,\u201cSunny Restaurant has the liveliest business among all the restaurants under Zack Smith. I just need to make this restaurant go out of business, and there\u2019ll be nothing to fear anymore.\u201dJordan picked up his glass of water and recalled the domineering and condescending attitude that Zack had during Diana\u2019s birthday banquet the other day. He then chugged the water in one go!\u201cLet\u2019s see who\u2019s going to have his career and means of livelihood ruined!\u201dSoon, it was 8 o\u2019clock in the evening, which was the time for the hit, Sicko Mode, to be performed.During this time, all of the guests in the private rooms from the second to the fifth floor left their rooms and stood outside to watch the performance.Inside Room 307.\u201cDo you want to go out and watch the performance?\u201d Victoria asked Jordan.She was worried Jordan would not like seeing both Tyler and Hailey since Tyler and Hailey were dining at the same place the song was being performed.Jordan said, \u201cOf course, I\u2019m the boss of this place. Even if I dislike the music, I still have to go out there and see how the audience reacts to the performance. Come on, let\u2019s go outside.\u201dJordan, Victoria, and Ashley, too, came out of the room.The rapper soon appeared on the second floor, and it instantly caused a huge commotion.After briefly greeting a few fans, he quickly began performing.Many of the customers in the restaurant started screaming at the top of their lungs as soon as the intro began.The rapper slowly began to perform.\u201cSun is down, freezin cold.\u201dThe audience started to chorus after the first line of the lyrics was sung.Tyler and Hailey also sang along when they were beside the rapper.Tyler flaunted smugly, \u201cDoes it feel good to be so up close to a celebrity!?!\u201dHailey nodded profusely, \u201cYes! It\u2019s great to have money, haha!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, being rich is awesome! I\u2019m the perfect husband, hahahahah!\u201dWhile relishing smugly, Tyler took the opportunity to put his arm around Hailey\u2019s shoulders, which the latter did not refute.At this moment, Victoria noticed that Jordan had tightened his grip on the railing of the third floor.She glanced down to look at Tyler and Hailey and instantly understood what was going on.Victoria extended her fair left hand and placed it on Jordan\u2019s right hand.She gave it a few gentle rubs and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to see them, you can tell them to leave.\u201dJordan was the owner of this place, so of course, he had the right to do that.Jordan sighed and said, \u201cEven if they don\u2019t get all touchy-feely here, they will do it elsewhere.\u201d\u201cAt the end of the day, I still haven\u2019t completely gotten over her.\u201dAfter all, Jordan had loved Hailey for three years, so it obviously wasn\u2019t easy to let it go just like that.Victoria had also gone through a similar experience. She predicted that Jordan would probably take more than a year to get over Hailey.At this moment, the rapper\u2019s voice was suddenly inaudible, and only the background music could be heard. The rapper began to panic a little as he constantly tapped the microphone.Jordan hurriedly snapped back to his senses with a stern expression.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I can\u2019t even hear what he\u2019s singing!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are they trying to fool us? What nonsense is this!?!\u201dAlthough the slip-up had just happened, many customers were already enraged.All of a sudden, there were customers throwing items down from the third, fourth, and fifth floors at the same time.Smack!A banana peel hit Tyler\u2019s face.Another orange peel landed on Hailey\u2019s thigh.\u201cAh!\u201d Hailey began to panic.\u201cDamn it, who did that!?! Come down!\u201d Tyler hollered furiously and stood up.After seeing that, Victoria exclaimed, \u201cWell done! An adulterous pair does deserve to get things thrown at them!\u201dJordan didn\u2019t have the time to comment or mock Hailey and Tyler.He said to Victoria, \u201cThis matter is not that simple. The microphone that he used is of the best quality, and nothing should go wrong. It\u2019s very likely to have been swapped.\u201dVictoria panicked and asked, \u201cYou mean someone deliberately created this slip-up? Do you think it\u2019s Zack Smith?\u201dJordan glanced at the guests upstairs. In addition to Zack\u2019s tampering with the microphone, they sent some people to pose as guests and incited the guests to attack the people below by smashing objects.Fortunately, Jordan and Victoria did not choose the room that Tyler did. Otherwise, they would have been the ones to have been hit by the fruit peel.The fool Tyler had actually spent $90,000 on a seat that caused him to end up getting hit by the fruit peel.However, Jordan\u2019s restaurant management team was the top in the nation. Seeing that there was something wrong with the microphone, they immediately replaced it.The rapper started performing the song repeatedly from the start and everyone chorused along, completely forgetting about the slip-up.After the end of the performance, everyone clapped in satisfaction.\u201cThank you everyone, please enjoy your dinner and the rest of your night, goodbye!\u201dThe rapper was just about to leave with the microphone.At this moment, Tyler took the microphone from the rapper and exclaimed at the customers upstairs.\u201cEveryone, wait a minute, don\u2019t go back to your rooms yet. I have something important that I would like all of you to witness!\u201dIn Cloud Cafeteria.Guests on the second to fifth floors who had planned to go back to their private rooms after watching the performance turned around when Tyler spoke.Jordan also frowned and looked at the second floor.A few staff members clad in the uniform of \u2018Joy Balloons\u2019 suddenly appeared beside Tyler and headed into the private room where Tyler and Hailey were in, with colorful balloons in hand.There were many balloons themed around the colors white, pink, and red.A few people on the other side of the room carried boxes of rose petals that they scattered on the ground.\u201cWow, is this a marriage proposal? A tycoon is proposing!\u201d\u201cI heard that that private room costs $90,000 to book!\u201d\u201cDamn it! I\u2019ve been so focused on the performance that I didn\u2019t even realize how beautiful the lady being proposed to is!\u201d\u201cThat woman is gorgeous! I\u2019d be willing to trade ten years of my life for a chance to sleep with her once!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve had too much to drink, haven\u2019t you? A woman like her will only marry mega-rich scions. How can we be fit to have a woman like her?\u201dTyler\u2019s actions sparked a considerable discussion.Jordan was furious!\u2018You set up a proposal in MY restaurant in front of MY guests without my permission, to MY woman?\u2019\u2018Screw you!\u2019Jordan quickly called the restaurant manager over and ordered, \u201cClean up the rubbish on the second floor immediately! Take the microphone away too!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dOn the second floor, Tyler took the microphone and got down on one knee while facing Hailey. \u201cHailey, will you\u2026 Hello? Hello?\u201dWhen Tyler was talking, he suddenly realized that the microphone had stopped working.That wasn\u2019t all. A restaurant waiter walked over and poked the balloons that symbolized romance and purity with a needle.Bang!Bang!Bang!Dozens of balloons were poked and burst one by one.Tyler panicked. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing!? Why did you pierce my balloons!?! They were meant for my proposal!\u201dDuring his temper tantrum, a woman in her forties walked over with a broomstick and said, \u201cLift your feet up, please.\u201dWhile saying that, she swept all the rose petals on the ground into the dustpan.Tyler jumped up again. \u201cAh! My roses! Don\u2019t sweep them away!\u201dHowever, the service staff ignored Tyler because she was carrying out Jordan\u2019s orders.At this moment, the guests also burst into laughter.\u201cHahahha, this punk had a romantic marriage proposal all planned out, but who knew his plan would be ruined by the service staff of the restaurant?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m laughing so hard. I reckon the proposal is going to be a flop, haha.\u201d\u201cWhy am I so happy? Although we are not worthy of that beautiful woman, I just don\u2019t want such a ravishing beauty to marry an evil scion!\u201dThe guests laughed for a while and then returned to their respective private rooms.Seeing that the proposal setup had been destroyed and the onlookers had left, Tyler flew into a rage.He barked, \u201cGet the owner of this restaurant to come out! Damn it, does he know who I am? I\u2019m Tyler Collins! Tell him to find out about my status in Orlando!\u201dJordan initially didn\u2019t intend to pay attention to them. Still, since Tyler wanted to see him, he decided to make his way downstairs from the third floor.With his hands in his pockets, Jordan said to Tyler, \u201cWhat are you clamoring about? If you don\u2019t want to continue dining, just get lost. Don\u2019t disturb my customers!\u201dTyler had yet to figure out what Jordan meant. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business! Get out of the way. I want to see the owner of this restaurant!\u201d\u201cI am the owner of this restaurant!\u201d Jordan snapped sternly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Stop pretending! I\u2019ve already checked it out. This is not the only restaurant that Steve Williams sold. All his restaurants in Orlando were bought by the same person for 10 million dollars! You\u2019re just a penniless man. Are you sure you can afford 10 million dollars?\u201dHailey didn\u2019t believe that Jordan would have 10 million dollars, although she knew that he would want to buy the restaurant to deal with Zack!\u201cHah, you don\u2019t believe me again, huh?\u201dJordan had gotten enough of the condescending and arrogant nature of these wealthy scions who loved looking down on others. He called the middle-aged woman who was sweeping the floor over. \u201cMa\u2019am, please come here for a moment.\u201dThe middle-aged woman walked over as she was told. Having seen Jordan in the morning, she knew that he was the owner of the restaurant. \u201cYes, boss?\u201dJordan pointed at Tyler and said to the middle-aged woman, \u201cHit his face with the broom, and I\u2019ll give you a bonus of nine times your salary this month.\u201d\u201cNine times?\u201dThe middle-aged woman was elated. She grabbed the broom and swung it against Tyler\u2019s face.\u201cAh! Ew!\u201dTyler was completely caught off guard, and he could not believe that he, the scion of the Collins, would get hit by a janitor.While dodging, Tyler spat out the garbage that had been stuck to the broom and gotten into his mouth.\u201cDamned cleaner, do you have a death wish!?! Don\u2019t you know who I am?\u201dThe middle-aged woman replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are. I\u2019m just here to clean the restrooms. Since my boss is paying me, I\u2019ll do whatever he tells me to.\u201dThe middle-aged woman was about to continue hitting Tyler, but Jordan stopped him.\u201cDo you believe it now? If you don\u2019t believe me, I\u2019ll have the other employees come to beat you up one by one,\u201d Jordan said, staring at Tyler.Tyler pointed at Jordan and snapped furiously, \u201cJordan Steele, I was wondering who the culprit who sabotaged my proposal plans is. It turns out that it\u2019s you! Why? Are you getting flustered now that I\u2019m proposing to Hailey? Are you jealous and heartbroken?\u201dHailey knew that Jordan was still in love with her and that he definitely didn\u2019t want to see another man proposing to her.However, Jordan said, \u201cI\u2019ve already divorced Hailey Camden and you proposing to her has nothing to do with me. However, if you\u2019re in my restaurant, you must adhere to the rules, and you cannot do this without my permission.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dTyler was enraged, but Jordan was the restaurant owner while he was just a customer, so he didn\u2019t have the advantage of being on his own turf.Tyler said, \u201cJordan, you definitely wouldn\u2019t have had the money to acquire this restaurant. You even hired a popular rapper. I reckon Miss Clarke is the true owner of this restaurant, huh?\u201dVictoria did not completely deny it. \u201cI do own a share in this restaurant.\u201dUpon hearing that Jordan was taking over the Orlando restaurant industry, Victoria invested 1.5 million dollars straight away because she knew they would be able to monopolize it with Jordan\u2019s ability to run a business.She was sure that there would be guaranteed returns on this investment.Tyler humphed coldly and said, \u201cMiss Clarke, you\u2019re probably the largest shareholder while Jordan Steele just holds a small number of shares, right? Jordan Steele, you probably own only one percent of the shares. What are you so proud of?\u201dAs Tyler said that, he took out a Tiffany box from his pocket and opened it to take out a diamond ring.The instant Hailey saw the diamond ring, she got a great shock because the color, clarity, and quality of the diamond ring were enough to drive any woman crazy!Tyler said smugly, \u201cThis is a three-carat diamond ring that\u2019s worth more than $600,000! Even if you work as a bodyguard for the rest of your life, you can\u2019t afford to give one to Hailey!\u201d\u201cToday, I\u2019ll use this diamond ring to win over the woman you\u2019ve loved for three years!\u201dAfter saying that, Tyler looked at Hailey while on one knee.\u201cHailey, marry me!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hence, he wanted to know if Hailey would remarry someone else so soon.Jordan looked at Hailey.Hailey was flustered because she didn\u2019t prepare herself mentally for this at all.Although in the plan that she and Rachel Quinn had drawn, Hailey\u2019s next step was to marry Tyler, However, Hailey didn\u2019t want to agree so quickly.Hailey said, \u201cTyler, um\u2026 can you give me some time to think about this?\u201dShe didn\u2019t turn him down straightaway, but she didn\u2019t accept the proposal either.Tyler nodded. He was actually already prepared to propose to Hailey a few times. After all, she was hailed as the most beautiful girl in Orlando who was far out of reach, so it was expected that he would fail on the first try.\u201cOkay, there\u2019s no hurry. Take your time and consider it but please accept the diamond ring.\u201dTyler stood up and placed the Tiffany ring box in Hailey\u2019s hand.Hailey took the box and looked at the sparkling diamond ring inside, overwhelmed with joy.However, she soon looked glum and sorrowful.She walked towards Jordan with a look of resentment and said, \u201cYou keep saying that you\u2019re rich and that you\u2019re the owner of a corporation and a restaurant. If you\u2019re really so loaded, why didn\u2019t you even give me a diamond ring?\u201d\u201cBack then, you took your bags with you and moved into my home without even proposing to me. You didn\u2019t buy me a single engagement ring or wedding ring!\u201dIn fact, Jordan had indeed failed to satisfy Hailey in that aspect. It was probably every girl\u2019s wish to be proposed to grandly with a nice diamond ring.However, Jordan married Hailey as a live-in husband, so he couldn\u2019t have been able to give her those things.Jordan said, \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been unfaithful to me, I would have made it up to you with a 21-carat diamond ring.\u201dHailey suddenly recalled a movie titled \u201921 Carats\u2019 that she and Jordan had watched together at the theaters a year ago.After watching the movie that day, Hailey griped about the fact that Jordan hadn\u2019t given her a diamond ring.On that day, Jordan promised that he would definitely make it up to her with a 21-carat diamond ring a year from then.At that time, Hailey simply laughed in disdain because she didn\u2019t believe that Jordan could do it at all.Jordan didn\u2019t linger around any longer and instead returned to the third floor with Victoria.As soon as they returned to the room on the third floor, Victoria said, \u201cHailey might not have accepted Tyler Collins\u2019 proposal today, but she didn\u2019t reject him either. I\u2019m guessing she\u2019ll say yes if he proposes to her again a few more times.\u201dJordan kept a straight face as he picked up a cup of water and took a sip of it.Victoria was curious to know what Jordan really thought about the idea of Hailey and Tyler getting married. The fact that Jordan was now executing his revenge on Zack showed that he was a vengeful person.Victoria didn\u2019t believe that Jordan would just sit back and watch Hailey and Tyler enjoy conjugal bliss after they had cheated on him!Victoria\u2019s intuition told her that Jordan must have devised a plan for revenge against them!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019re indeed worthy of being my vice president.\u201dVictoria was elated. \u201cDid I guess correctly?\u201dJordan shook his head and said, \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to do it after they get married. I\u2019m going to do it on the day of their wedding!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to let Hailey Camden find out on the day that she marries a man whom she thinks is the wealthiest scion she can ever marry, that I\u2019m the true mega-rich tycoon!\u201d\u201cOn that day, I will not only let Hailey Camden find out the truth. I am also going to inform all the people in the business industry in Orlando that I, Jordan Steele, the former live-in husband of Hailey Camden, am now the president of Ace Corporation and the richest man in Orlando!\u201dVictoria perked up immediately in agitation. She was thrilled to find that she had guessed correctly!Jordan could have easily asked Hailey to go to Ace Corporation, where he would show her the shares transfer agreement and ask the entire staff to prove that he was the president.However, he did not do so.If he let Hailey learn of the truth now, he was 100% sure that she would throw herself at him again and beg for his forgiveness, given how reliant she had been on him in the past three years.Although Jordan wouldn\u2019t agree to get back together with her, the consequences that Hailey would bear would be too minor. She wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the messy issues that would come with severing ties with Tyler.What if he carried out the plan when Hailey had already married Tyler?The matter would then become complicated!If Hailey had already become Tyler\u2019s wife, what would she do after learning of Jordan\u2019s true identity?Get divorced again at the expense of offending the Collins and then come crawling back to Jordan?The price of doing that would be too high!Jordan really wanted to know what choice Hailey would make when the day comes!Jordan remained composed and said, \u201cBefore they get married, I want to be one of the richest people in Orlando as well as a restaurant magnate with monopoly in the restaurant industry. I also want to be in control of the entertainment industry and all other industries that I can take hold of.\u201d\u201cI want to be the king of this city!\u201dThe king of Orlando!Victoria\u2019s heart was racing. All these years, she had been looking for a domineering man like Jordan!\u2018I want to be the queen of Orlando!\u2019Victoria secretly set a goal for herself too.On the other hand, Ashley thought to herself, \u2018I want to be Mr. Steele\u2019s concubine!\u2019Bang! Bang!Someone knocked on the door outside the room.\u201cCome in,\u201d Jordan said.The person who walked in was the restaurant manager. He walked towards Jordan with an electronic tablet in hand.\u201cMr. Steele, I just watched the surveillance camera footage. The microphone used for the performance just now had been replaced by someone very likely to be a customer here. We\u2019re now checking every single private room.\u201dJordan said, \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary. Just go straight to Rooms 422 and 501.\u201dEveryone froze in shock, wondering how Jordan knew that the guests in those two rooms were the culprits.In fact, the customers outside those two rooms were the ones who tried to incite anger within the other customers by throwing things downstairs as soon as there was a slip-up in the performance.Jordan guessed that they were the culprits.Victoria once again looked at Jordan with reverence, in awe of his impressive memory.Soon, the man caught stealing the microphone by the surveillance cameras was brought in.\u201cWhat did you bring me here for? I\u2019m having some drinks with my buddies. Get straight to the point!\u201dThe young man said impatiently with annoyance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, he denied, \u201cWho\u2019s Zack Smith? I don\u2019t know him!\u201dAlthough the man denied it, Jordan was already confident that he was sent by Zack.Jordan had taken psychology lessons from a renowned professor of psychology. Rowland Miller and his grandfather had also taught him a bit of human anatomy when he was a child.Hence, Jordan was good at reading people and judging them based on their words and actions.Of course, he didn\u2019t succeed every time, and Hailey was an example of his failure.However, he was very sure about the person in front of him.Jordan said, \u201cHand your cell phone to me.\u201dSince this person was sent by Zack, there were definitely records of the calls and text messages he had exchanged with Zack on his cell phone.The man obviously got even more flustered. \u201cYou want me to hand my cell phone to you? What right do you have to do that? Who do you think you are?\u201d\u201cYou want to do things the hard way, huh!?\u201dJordan was ready to get up and teach him a lesson.However, Victoria said, \u201cMr. Steele, let me do it.\u201dJordan was surprised because even though this young man in front of them was weak and skinny, Victoria was still a woman after all.He reckoned that it wouldn\u2019t be too easy for a woman to subdue a man.Seeing that Victoria was walking over, the young man sized up her beautiful face and splendid figure.With glistening eyes, he remarked, \u201cTsk, tsk, what a gorgeous woman. She\u2019s ten times better than that hooker I hired for a hundred bucks yesterday! Come on, babe, my cell phone is right here. Come take it if you can\u2026\u201dBefore the man could finish what he said, Victoria immediately reached over and pressed his hand against the dining table!Bang!Jordan was surprised because he didn\u2019t expect Victoria to be skilled in combat either!She was far more robust than most girls, and it would be a piece of cake for her to deal with physically weaker men.Victoria was in control of that man\u2019s hand, and after unlocking his cell phone with his fingerprints, she tossed the cell phone at Jordan.The young man was infuriated. \u2018A woman actually snatched my cell phone away so easily!?\u2019That made him feel highly embarrassed!\u201cB*tch, how dare you snatch my cell phone away? I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201dThe young man panicked and leaped towards Victoria. However, at this point, Jordan had already gotten up and was ready to rescue Victoria.However, Victoria did not panic, instead waiting for the man to come over while standing rooted to the ground. When he did, she grabbed him by his clothing, threw him over her shoulder, and onto the dining table in a single fluid action!Bang!\u201cAh!\u201dThe man shrieked in pain.Victoria clapped her hands and said valiantly, \u201cSorry, Mr. Steele, I doubt we can continue eating.\u201dJordan was dumbfounded. He put the man\u2019s cell phone down and then said while applauding with both hands, \u201cBravo, Victoria!\u201dAshley was in utmost awe. She hugged Victoria\u2019s waist and exclaimed, \u201cMiss Clarke, you\u2019re so mighty!\u201dThe young man had been defeated by Victoria, but he couldn\u2019t accept his defeat and continued to clamor indignantly.\u201cB*tch, fight me in bed if you have what it takes! I\u2019ll make sure you die!\u201dVictoria walked over and slapped him hard on his face.Smack!\u201cPunk, regardless of where we fight, I\u2019ll have the upper hand! But you don\u2019t deserve to fight with me. Only a truly powerful man is worthy of contending with me!\u201dWhen she said the last sentence, Victoria shifted her gaze onto Jordan.Victoria was an elite among women, and Jordan was good at martial arts too.However, Jordan was a little awkward, so he just picked up the young man\u2019s cell phone and began checking it.Victoria thought to herself, \u2018In the last three years, Jordan has never gotten intimate with Hailey Camden, so maybe he only likes those immature and innocent girls now.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s all Hailey Camden\u2019s fault. If that bitch had gotten intimate with him frequently in the past three years, he might be sick of weak and vulnerable girls like her by now. He\u2019d definitely be thrilled to meet a woman like me!\u2019Victoria had deliberately displayed her combat skills to Jordan today because she wanted to let him know that just like him, she could put up a fight too and would be glad to \u201cspar\u201d with him whenever he pleased.Jordan examined the young man\u2019s cell phone to verify that he had actually recorded the conversation he had with Zack via text message, which included their plan to replace the microphones and create chaos in the restaurant.Jordan immediately sent Zack a video call request using the young man\u2019s phone.Zack answered soon after.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Mr. Smith.\u201dJordan said to Zack in the call.Zack froze in shock for a moment before asking, \u201cWho are you? Why are you using Sam\u2019s phone?\u201dJordan smiled and said, \u201cMr. Smith, you\u2019re really forgetful. Just a few days ago, you said you would cut off all means for me to sustain a livelihood in Orlando, and now you\u2019re telling me you don\u2019t recognize me?\u201dZack immediately exclaimed in shock, \u201cYou\u2019re the Camdens\u2019 good-for-nothing son-in-law! Why do you have Sam\u2019s phone? What exactly do you want?\u201dJordan said, \u201cYou sent people to create trouble in my restaurant. I should be the one asking, what do you want!?!\u201d\u201cWhat? You were the one who bought Cloud Cafeteria?\u201d Zack panicked immediately.He was surprised why his rival had sold all the restaurants so suddenly, to whom he had sold them, and what the buyer intended to do with them.If it was to make money from running a restaurant, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to pay such a high price on a restaurant still being run by others.Zack guessed that the buyer was very eager to make some significant achievements in the restaurant industry of Orlando.Now, Zack knew the reason.Zack said extremely sternly, \u201cYou want to take revenge on me, huh? Punk, I don\u2019t know how you got the money to buy so many restaurants, but I\u2019ve been in the restaurant industry for decades. There\u2019s absolutely no way you can surpass me!\u201dJordan said, \u201cOkay then, let\u2019s see what happens.\u201dJordan hung up the video call, licked the young man out, and immediately called Pablo.\u2018Since you used underhanded tactics, don\u2019t blame me for paying you back in your own coin!\u2019\u201cMr. Jordan!\u201d Pablo answered excitedly.Jordan instructed, \u201cSend your subordinates to Sunny Restaurant for a meal and create some trouble for them.\u201d\u201cRoger!\u201d Pablo immediately understood what Jordan wanted to do.Twenty minutes later.Over a hundred Southeast Asian experts arrived outside Sunny Restaurant.\u201cBoss, there are guests! There are many of them, and they\u2019re all from abroad!\u201dZack\u2019s chauffeur scurried towards him excitedly.There was barely anyone outside and inside Sunny Restaurant today because all the fans had decided to patronize Cloud Cafeteria instead.However, when he heard that there were many customers outside, Zack immediately got excited. \u201cHahaha, get the chefs to pay more attention when cooking. Let\u2019s serve them well!\u201dZack demanded the best service attitude from his staff.However\u2026An hour later.The 100-odd Southeast Asian customers were lying on the table and foaming at the mouth.\u201cWhat\u2026 what happened!?! Could it be food poisoning? Please cut it out. If one of them dies here, I\u2019ll have to wind up my restaurant! They\u2019re all foreigners too!\u201dIf foreign customers had been poisoned to death in his restaurant, it would be ten times more difficult for him to deal with the matter than if it had been local customers.When Jordan and Victoria walked out of Cloud Cafeteria, they happened to see several ambulances outside Sunny Restaurant as the staff carried the poisoned customers out on stretchers, one by one.Jordan said indifferently, \u201cIt\u2019s over for Sunny Restaurant!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now that it had been ruined, the remaining ones would be even easier to deal with.At first, Jordan did not intend to use such underhanded means and merely wanted to deal with Zack through legitimate means.For example, he could hire famous singers to sing in the restaurant every day and replace the head chefs of Cloud Cafeteria with world-class chefs.He could afford to spend such a large amount of money, and he would be able to defeat Zack even if he had to incur monetary losses.However, since Zack chose to provoke Jordan first, he only had himself to blame.At this moment, Jordan had unquestionably become the top magnate of the restaurant industry in Orlando.After that, Jordan engaged a few more celebrities and opened several karaoke bars and clubs in Orlando to kick the nightclub magnate-who had also sworn to destroy his livelihood in the city- out of the joint entertainment industry.Soon, half a month had passed.The Camdens were having dinner in Diana\u2019s villa.While eating, Sylvie said, \u201cHave you guys heard? Goldmine Karaoke Bar fled the city last night! Zack\u2019s restaurant, Sunny Restaurant, has also been sold to someone else. Half a month ago, they were all dignified and powerful figures of Orlando, but they\u2019re now in such miserable plights. How unexpected.\u201dElle drank a spoonful of soup and said, \u201cThey had probably offended some big shots. Otherwise, why would there be so many new restaurants, karaoke bars, and clubs popping up in the past two weeks?\u201dHerman put down his fork and knife and humphed coldly. \u201cZack Smith had even borrowed money from me two days ago, claiming that Jordan Steele had taken revenge on him. He even said that he ended up in such a state because he had tried to help us. Atrocious. Jordan Steele is just a bodyguard. How can he be capable enough to take revenge against Zack?\u201dBenedict nodded and chimed in, \u201cHerman is right. If Jordan really wanted to take revenge, he would have exacted it on us first. From the way I see it, that\u2019s just Zack Smith\u2019s excuse for borrowing money.\u201dDiana frowned and remained silent while pondering over the matter. She wondered if Jordan was really the one who had caused such a stir in the city recently.However, after thinking for a long time, she still didn\u2019t have an answer.Diana looked at Hailey, who had been spacing out, and asked, \u201cHailey, what are you thinking?\u201dHailey continued to be in a trance while drinking some soup, and she only snapped back to her senses when Sylvie nudged her with her elbow.Elle chuckled and said, \u201cHailey must be thinking about Tyler\u2019s marriage proposal, huh? In the past two weeks, Tyler has proposed to Hailey nine times, but she hasn\u2019t said yes to him yet.\u201dOver the past two weeks, Jordan had been dominating the business industry of Orlando and taking over several industries to destroy the livelihoods of the people who had stood against him during Diana\u2019s birthday banquet back then.In the meantime, Tyler had also repeatedly proposed to Hailey.After the proposal at Cloud Cafeteria, he proposed again in other restaurants and caf\u00e9s.Each time, he would prepare a gift that was worth at least a few hundred grand.Diana said to Hailey, \u201cTyler is quite a nice lad. He has a good family background, and he loves you so much too. Tyler\u2019s father has called me to say that you\u2019re making the Collins feel embarrassed by repeatedly turning Tyler down.\u201dAfter all, the Collins was a notch above the Camdens in terms of status and power. Regardless of how beautiful Hailey was, she was still a divorcee.The Collins was in disdain of Hailey\u2019s condescending and aloof behavior.Hailey nodded and said, \u201cI will say yes when he proposes for the tenth time at the superstar\u2019s concert tomorrow.\u201dDiana finally smiled, and she exclaimed, \u201cHaha, great, the Camdens are going to hold yet another joyous event! Come, let\u2019s all toast in advance to wish Hailey a happy marriage!\u201dEveryone filled their glasses with wine and even Herman, who had always been against Hailey, stood up to give her his blessings.\u201cUh, Hailey, Tyler is more competent than Jordan. If you marry him in the future, remember to share any benefits in business with us, if any.\u201dSylvie replied on behalf of Hailey, \u201cThat goes without saying, we\u2019re family after all, right, Benedict?\u201dSylvie grinned widely and pounded her hand against Benedict gently.However, Benedict wasn\u2019t smiling at all. It was as if his daughter\u2019s marriage had nothing to do with him.Benedict raised his glass somewhat reluctantly and said indifferently, \u201cHe\u2019s indeed better than that good-for-nothing Jordan Steele, well at least in terms of being presentable.\u201dEveryone raised their glasses and gave Hailey their blessings.However, Drew suddenly stood up and said, \u201cUh, I\u2019ve got a tummy ache. You guys go ahead.\u201d\u201cThis kid\u2026\u201d Diana shook her head.Most of the injuries that Drew sustained had healed. Still, Diana had a nagging feeling that Drew was different from before, especially when talking about topics related to Hailey and Jordan.Drew headed to the washroom, but instead of relieving nature\u2019s call, he made a call to someone.He was calling Jordan!The incident in the underground parking lot the other day, where even Pablo knelt down to Jordan, had convinced Drew that Jordan would likely be a terrifying boss even if he were not the president of Ace Corporation!Hence, Drew defected and wanted to get on good terms with Jordan.\u201cHello,\u201d Jordan answered the phone.Drew said, \u201cJordan, during dinner, Hailey said that she would say yes to Tyler Collins when he proposes to her during a superstar\u2019s concert tomorrow. Do you want me to convince Grandma to forbid Hailey from saying yes?\u201dDrew knew that Jordan still loved Hailey. After all, he had been married to her for three years and put in plenty of effort, only to have them go in vain. Anyone would be indignant if they were in his shoes.If Jordan wanted to stop Hailey and Tyler from getting married, Drew could help him with it.After a moment of silence, Jordan said, \u201cDon\u2019t stop her! Just let her say yes!\u201dDrew said, \u201cJordan, why let that punk Tyler get what he wants? With your abilities, you can easily kill him! Both him and I have offended you, and you gave me such a harsh beating, but you let him off the hook. That\u2019s unfair to me!\u201dJordan laughed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Tyler\u2019s going to end up in a state that\u2019s much worse than you.\u201dOf course, Jordan was going to get revenge on Tyler, but it wasn\u2019t going to be as simple as breaking his limbs.Tyler and Hailey had harmed Jordan emotionally, so Jordan would do the same to them!Jordan wanted Hailey to first marry Tyler before regretting her decision!That would be the most ruthless form of revenge!Drew said, \u201cRest assured, Jordan, I\u2019m keeping an eye on Hailey, and I\u2019ve also lied to her that Grandma doesn\u2019t want her to move in with Tyler before they get married. For the past few days, Hailey has been returning home at night, and she only goes out to public places during the day. They haven\u2019t done anything.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Jordan said, \u201cEven if they did something, it has nothing to do with me.\u201dDrew chuckled. \u201cWe\u2019re both men, I understand. You might insist that you don\u2019t care, but you definitely hope that they haven\u2019t done the deed.\u201dJordan laughed and said, \u201cDrew, I didn\u2019t expect you to have become more philosophical. You\u2019ve made progress.\u201dDrew said, \u201cWhat I\u2019m going to say next is even more philosophical!\u201dJordan asked, \u201cOh? Are you that confident? Go ahead.\u201dDrew said, \u201cMarry my sister! She\u2019ll make a good wife! Grandma said that she has great birthing hips!\u201dJordan snapped, \u201cGet lost!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he hadn\u2019t learned of Jordan\u2019s actual family background yet, he could tell from how Pablo treated him that Jordan\u2019s family was definitely not ordinary.Drew reckoned that he was probably some big boss.If his sister married Jordan, he could gain some clout and act like a tyrant in Orlando in the future!Drew kept sending Jordan some photos of Elle, which he had stolen from Elle\u2019s phone while she was asleep.Elle had never posted those photos on the Internet and merely kept them in her phone for her own admiration.Although Drew was Elle\u2019s biological brother, he swore that he would get in her pants if she wasn\u2019t his sister.After looking at those photos, Jordan was obviously somewhat enticed.Nevertheless, he was now planning revenge against his ex-wife, Hailey, and that was all he could think about right now. Honestly, he wasn\u2019t in the mood to move on to someone else.After hanging up, Jordan sighed.\u201cHailey, you\u2019re finally going to marry that rich scion, and you two will no longer need to hide your relationship. Haha.\u201dJordan smiled bitterly. He initially wanted to ignore the fact that Tyler was going to propose to Hailey tomorrow, but in the end, he decided to go to the venue himself!He wanted to see Hailey getting proposed to, with his own eyes!He wanted to remember the happy smiles on their faces!He would then give them the punishment they deserved!Jordan called Victoria on the phone. \u201cVictoria, accompany me to a superstar\u2019s concert tomorrow.\u201d\u2026Seven o\u2019clock in the evening.Amway Center.All 20,000 seats in the indoor arena were filled and the drizzle today didn\u2019t dampen the mood of the enthusiastic fans.That was the charm of a superstar.The audience was of all ages, ranging from teenagers to middle-aged folks in their fifties.Jordan and Victoria were seated in the VIP seats, which were obviously different from the ordinary seats.The ordinary seats were further away from the stage, and occupants of those seats would have to watch the concert through the large display screen because they wouldn\u2019t be able to see the singer on stage from that angle. The physical seats were also hard and uncomfortable.The VIP seats were much better as they offered a closer view of the stage, and the seats were much more comfortable. Jordan was seated in the first row, which was only a few steps from the stage,However, Jordan was not the only one who could afford VIP seats.\u201cHey, what a coincidence, Jordan and Miss Clarke. We meet again.\u201dTyler walked over, hand in hand with Hailey. They were seated right beside Jordan and Victoria!Jordan noticed that they were holding hands in public, which they hadn\u2019t done during the last few times they ran into each other\u2026Jordan\u2019s heart ached when he saw that scene!There was a time when he also fantasized about holding Hailey\u2019s hand while watching a concert together with her!When Victoria saw Hailey, she realized why Jordan asked her out to a concert. Before this, she had mistakenly thought that Jordan was going to woo her.Victoria gibed, \u201cMr. Collins, how many times have you proposed recently? You\u2019re really persistent, huh? If you really can\u2019t win Hailey\u2019s heart, just give up. Not everyone can marry her.\u201dThen Tyler smiled and said, \u201cI would be willing to propose a hundred times, unlike someone here who has not even proposed once and simply moved in with Hailey as her live-in husband.\u201dJordan couldn\u2019t be bothered to argue with Tyler because he had gotten sick of doing so. Instead, he remained seated quietly and waited for the performance to begin.Soon, the superstar made his appearance and performed a classic hit that sparked an uproar of enthusiasm among the crowd.He sang many songs that the audience was familiar with.He was absolutely deserving of being a superstar; even though he was in his late fifties, he could still sing quite nicely and dance along for two complete hours while jamming to the music!Everyone was immersed in the charm of the superstar.At the end of the concert, the superstar was drenched in sweat and panting heavily. He said into the microphone, \u201cI\u2019m tired. Now I\u2019d like to invite a fan to come sing for me. How does that sound?\u201dEveryone knew that it was time for song requests.Many singers would include a song request segment during their concerts, but in order to prevent accidents, the fans who would be picked to go on stage were all pre-arranged.Naturally, those who paid more money would have higher chances of getting picked, in most cases.Tyler had long spent money to get the spot, so at this point, the superstar pointed at Tyler and said, \u201cLet\u2019s have our friend over here to sing for me.\u201dThe crew member handed a microphone to Tyler, and all eyes were on Tyler at this very moment.Tyler said, \u201cI would like to choose a song named \u2018Love Letter\u2019 for my girlfriend, Hailey.\u201d\u201cIn addition, I would like to take this opportunity to propose to my girlfriend. Hailey, will you marry me?\u201dTyler once again got down on one knee and proposed to Hailey!He took out a Cartier diamond ring from his pocket, which was obviously not the same one he had prepared for the previous proposals.The fans present were all cheering and jumping excitedly when they saw that.Amidst the revelry, Jordan dwelt in loneliness!Victoria said to Jordan, \u201cJordan, if you really still love Hailey, this is your last chance.\u201dVictoria also knew that this time, Hailey would say yes to Tyler.Given Victoria\u2019s understanding of Tyler\u2019s father, the Collins would never allow a woman to turn down Tyler\u2019s marriage proposal more than 10 times.Jordan remained seated, his hands trembling a little. At this moment, he had really hesitated and contemplated it!\u2018Should I rush forward to stop all of this and let Hailey know who I really am?\u2019\u2018Should I just pretend that those things in the past had never happened?\u2019\u2018Should I just give up on revenge and all the plans that I\u2019ve devised!?\u2019All Jordan knew at this moment was that he still loved Hailey!However, before Jordan could come to a decision, Hailey\u2019s sweet and pleasant voice resounded throughout the arena.\u201cI do.\u201dThose words had put Jordan\u2019s contemplation to an end.Tyler excitedly put the diamond ring on Hailey\u2019s ring finger.Staring at the ring on Hailey\u2019s ring finger, Jordan felt as if his heart had been stabbed by a million daggers!The woman he had loved for three years was now going to marry someone else!The moment he found out that Hailey cheated on him, he decisively chose to divorce her.He thought that he would never think about her again nor care who she got together with in the future.However, Jordan had overestimated himself.How could he easily let go of someone he loved?After Tyler succeeded in proposing to Hailey, the superstar surprisingly looked at Jordan and said, \u201cWould you like to make a song request too? We can all sing together.\u201dTyler was stunned. \u2018Did Jordan spend money to make a song request too?\u2019In fact, Jordan didn\u2019t know why he would be picked either because he hadn\u2019t spent any money to get the chance to.Because the concert organizer had learned Jordan would be attending the concert, he specifically told the superstar that Jordan is currently the most powerful entrepreneur in Orlando and asked him to give Jordan a chance to make a song requestJordan took the microphone. At this moment, he really wanted to vent his emotions with a song.There were some things he could express through a song but not words.Jordan asked, \u201cCan I play an instrument and sing along on my own?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had a piano at home, but she had never seen Jordan play it in the past three years.Besides, she thought that Jordan was from a poor family in the countryside and didn\u2019t have the chance to learn music due to financial constraints.The superstar was surprised but pleased to hear his request. \u201cOf course, you may do so. It happens that our pianist is tired. He can take a break now. Please come on stage.\u201dThe superstar took the initiative to extend his hand to Jordan and pull him onto the stage.\u201cEveryone, let\u2019s give him a round of applause, shall we?\u201dThe superstar encouraged the fans to cheer for Jordan for fear that Jordan would get nervous in front of such a large crowd.However, how could Jordan be nervous now?At this point, his heart was already full of disappointment and sorrow.Amidst the cheers of the audience, Jordan sat down in front of a piano.He was thinking about what song to sing.Although \u2018Heartbroken\u2019 was the song that fit his mood the best now, he didn\u2019t want to sing it.The song would put him in a lowly position and give Hailey and Tyler a chance to mock him.He chose to sing one of the most popular songs at the moment.\u2018A Thousand Reasons to be Sad!\u2019The song\u2019s title also had a different meaning\u2014\u2019There are a thousand reasons to be sad and losing you may not necessarily be the reason for my sorrow!\u2019Since the concert was drawing to an end, the lights in the arena were all switched on.Both the stage and audience pit were brightly lit.However, at this moment, the lights in the audience area went out again, and the spotlight was now on the stage.Jordan pressed all his fingers on the white keys, played the root note with his left hand, and the treble clef melody with his right. His hand positions and posture were correct, and he was playing very fluidly.As soon as the intro of \u201cA Thousand Reasons to be Sad\u201d started, the fans began cheering merrily!Hailey was stunned after listening for a few seconds!Hailey had learned how to play the piano since a young age and was very proficient in it. Hence, she could naturally tell the standard of Jordan\u2019s piano-playing skills at a glance!His posture was correct, his playing was clean, and his rhythm was accurate.Jordan must have been playing the piano for at least three years to play the intro of this song so perfectly!\u201cDid he start learning piano only after we got married? Oh my God, he used to have so many errands to run every day, but he still has the time to practice the piano and play it so well! Damn it, Jordan, why didn\u2019t you tell me you could play the piano!?!\u201dHailey regretted the fact that she had found out that Jordan could play the piano only after they had gotten divorced.After playing the intro on the piano, Jordan started singing slowly.\u201cThe person I loved is no longer mine.\u201dWow!Jordan\u2019s singing voice sounded completely different from when he spoke!\u201cOh my God, why does it sound so pleasant!?\u201dHailey and everyone else was stunned, and they soon gave a warm round of applause.It was the superstar\u2019s concert!Others would seem like a joke when they sang at his concert!It was just like performing a dunk behind Vince Carter and Zach LaVine!They would be absolutely no match for him!However, Jordan\u2019s voice was melodious and made their eyes light up with joy, even though it didn\u2019t necessarily surpass the superstar\u2019s.It was because Jordan\u2019s vocal coach was Seth Riggs, the very same man who taught Michael Jackson, the \u201cKing of Pop,\u201d as well as several other superstars.Jordan learned to sing from him at the age of 6, so he was definitely an experienced singer!Of course, at this moment, Jordan didn\u2019t deliberately show off his singing skills and was merely following his heart as he sang.\u201cThis time, my love will not last forever.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t linger around any longer.\u201d\u201cThere are a thousand reasons to be sad, a thousand reasons to be sad\u2026 In the end, my love gradually turns stale!\u201dJordan was still playing the piano during the verse.However, when it came to the chorus, the drummers and guitar players started playing too!In fact, the superstar was even harmonizing with Jordan!The entire performance was simply intoxicating!\u201cOh my God\u2026\u201dHailey was mesmerized by Jordan\u2019s singing, and she couldn\u2019t believe that the man on the stage who was now in the limelight was her ex-husband!He was the ex-husband that she and her family called a good-for-nothing!\u201cHow is he\u2026 so brilliant?\u201dOnly in that moment did Hailey realize that except for his destitute family background, Jordan was better than most scions of wealthy families in many other aspects, such as his personality, eloquence, upbringing, proficiency in arts, and mannerisms!\u201cThere are a thousand reasons to be sad, a thousand reasons to be sad\u2026 In the end, I was forgotten in someone else\u2019s story!\u201dAfter the song ended, the audience gave a thunderous round of applause!Many people said that Jordan\u2019s handsome looks, excellent singing, and brilliant piano-playing skills were all qualities that would make a wonderful star!However, after Jordan finished singing, he walked off the stage without saying a single word.However, he didn\u2019t return to his seat and instead walked straight to the exit.\u201cJordan!\u201dUnable to contain herself, Hailey shrugged Tyler\u2019s handoff and rushed towards the exit to chase after Jordan.In the last four minutes, she had already been head-over-heels mesmerized by her husband!\u201cHailey!\u201d Tyler also wanted to chase after her, but he was stopped by Victoria.Victoria said, \u201cMr. Collins, the concert hasn\u2019t ended yet. It\u2019s not too late to leave after it\u2019s over.\u201dTyler said anxiously, \u201cHailey has gone to chase after Jordan Steele!\u201dVictoria smiled and said, \u201cSo what? She has already said yes to your proposal. What else are you worried about? Do you think she will choose Jordan over you?\u201dTyler chuckled and said, \u201cHaha, I\u2019m absolutely confident that I\u2019ll beat Jordan. Okay then, I won\u2019t chase after her.\u201d\u201cJordan! Hold it right there!\u201dJordan was walking quickly, and Hailey scurried all the way to the exit, where she finally caught up with him and held him back.Panting heavily, Hailey seemed a little disheveled, but she was still gorgeous.After stopping, Hailey discovered that there were tears in Jordan\u2019s eyes, which meant he had just cried!\u201cJordan!\u201dHailey leaped straight into Jordan\u2019s arms!The song that Jordan had just sung in front of 20,000 people touched her deeply because it was the story of their relationship!Hailey could tell what it meant!\u201cDon\u2019t do this. You\u2019re going to become someone else\u2019s wife soon.\u201d Jordan gently pushed Hailey away.Hailey asked with great devotion, \u201cSilly, since you love me so much, why did you have to be so impulsive and divorce me back then?\u201d\u201cI know, men can\u2019t accept being made a cuckold, but not all men are qualified to initiate a divorce!\u201dFinding her to be absolutely ridiculous, Jordan said, \u201cWhat kind of men are qualified and what kind of men are not?\u201dHailey said, \u201cMen who are wealthy and powerful have the right to, while men like you who come from a poor family should learn to tolerate such things. Jordan, if you had chosen to hold yourself back and take it that that incident had never happened, I\u2026 I would still be your wife now\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are poor people like us supposed to blame ourselves for the circumstances that we\u2019re subjected to and tolerate the betrayal of you people just because you\u2019re affluent and powerful? Does being rich give you the right to commit adultery with impunity while deriving joy from the misery of others?\u201dAlthough Jordan did not suffer from poverty, he wanted to speak up for the poor!All humans deserve equal respect!Hailey shook her head and said, \u201cWill you be more realistic? Even my grandfather said that the impoverished can never nurture outstanding children!\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019re good to me, and you have great qualities, but I can\u2019t see a future with you\u2026\u201dWhile speaking, Hailey suddenly reached out to hold Jordan\u2019s hand. \u201cJordan, give me a few years, okay?\u201dThis time, Jordan did not shake off Hailey\u2019s hand. Instead, he asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dHailey said, \u201cIn a few years, I would have inherited the Camdens\u2019 assets and given birth to Tyler\u2019s child. Let\u2019s wait until then to get back together, shall we?\u201dJordan looked at Hailey in disbelief, hardly able to believe the fact that the girl whom he thought was innocent, pure and simple-minded, would have such a plan in mind!Jordan asked in astonishment, \u201cAre you treating me as your standby lover? Are you going to make me take you back after that bastard Tyler Collins has toyed with you for a couple of years?\u201dSmack!Hailey slapped Jordan in the face because she didn\u2019t like the words \u2018toy with\u2019.Hailey said, \u201cWake up! Be more realistic! This is the way society is! Only the rich can marry the rich! A man like you, who comes from a poor background, only deserves leftovers! This is the world for you!\u201d\u201cStop being so arrogant and thinking you\u2019re extraordinary! It\u2019s time you change your character!\u201d\u201cThink about it carefully. In three to five years, I\u2019ll have at least 150 million dollars, which is more than you will ever earn even if you work as a bodyguard for the rest of your life! Go ask around, which multimillionaire would be willing to marry an ordinary man like you!?\u201d\u201cYou should take my love for you as a blessing! You should be getting on your knees and thanking me for wanting to be with you even after I become a multimillionaire instead of harping on such irrelevant things!\u201dHailey had given Jordan a hard slap on his face, but he didn\u2019t feel any pain at all.Although he developed a high pain threshold after all the battles on the battlefield, the physical pain he was experiencing was nothing compared to the emotional pain he was feeling!Jordan fell silent.He wondered what choice he would make if he wasn\u2019t the scion of the Steeles, which was a family with a multi-billion net worth, but just an ordinary man from an ordinary family.Out of 100 ordinary men, 99 wouldn\u2019t mind marrying a multimillionaire who had been married and is the mother of another man\u2019s child.For them, it might really be a blessing!Jordan sighed emotionally because he knew that Hailey loved him too.\u201cIf it was someone else, maybe they would be grateful to you, but unfortunately, I will never let myself be a second option! Besides, you still owe me an apology for what happened previously!\u201dJordan shouted.Hailey had cheated on him and made him a cuckold, but until today, she hadn\u2019t even apologized for it. Yet, she wanted him to be her standby lover!Hailey retorted furiously, \u201cI\u2019ve been so good to you, but you\u2019re still so muddled up! Do you know that I have plenty of suitors now and will still continue to in a few more years!?! You should be grateful that I\u2019ve chosen you! Yet, you\u2019re still haggling over an apology? You will never hear an apology from me for the rest of your life!\u201dHailey knew she had done Jordan wrong, but she didn\u2019t want to lower herself and apologize because she felt that she was already giving Jordan great compensation by allowing him to get back together with her.Jordan didn\u2019t want to continue arguing with her either. \u201cFine, I won\u2019t force you. In this case, I wish you conjugal bliss, and I hope you won\u2019t regret your choice!\u201dAfter saying that, Jordan turned around and left.Still, standing behind him, Hailey exclaimed, \u201cHaha, why would I regret my choice? Tyler is a hundred times better than you! I\u2019m going to marry a wealthy man, and you\u2019ll be the one to regret it! In a few years, you will no longer be able to continue working as a bodyguard, and you\u2019ll come begging me on your knees! By then, let\u2019s see if I still want you!\u201dJordan ignored her and bottled all his anger.Next, he would vent all the infuriation caused by the damage that Tyler and Hailey had done to him!An hour later, in Rose Garden Villas.Jordan had checked out of the West Lake Hotel. He moved into a villa in the most expensive residential area in Orlando that he had just bought.The time was already 11 o\u2019clock at night. Victoria arrived at Jordan\u2019s villa frantically and apologized, \u201cMr. Steele, I am so sorry, there was heavy traffic on the way, and we spent a half-hour just leaving the arena.\u201dJordan had left earlier than them, so it was easier for him to leave. If he had left after the concert ended, he would have been stuck in traffic too.Jordan wasn\u2019t bothered. He said indifferently, \u201cI\u2019ve officially begun executing my plan for revenge against the Collins. They are a top-tier family in Orlando, so they\u2019d definitely need some time to prepare for a grand wedding.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to make the Collins decline and become reduced to a bush league family before Tyler Collins and Hailey Camden get married!\u201d\u201cVictoria, you know the Collins well. Tell me more about them.\u201dVictoria nodded and explained, \u201cThe Collins are now helmed by Tyler\u2019s father, Leonard Collins. His largest business is the chain of Era Express hotels that are located all across the country.\u201d\u201cIn addition, he also owns more than twenty hotels, including Seven Stars Hotel and Luxe Hotel, in Orlando.\u201d\u201cA few years ago, his hotel brand had a value of over a billion dollars, but has since declined and is now only valued at 460 million dollars.\u201dJordan lit a cigarette and said, \u201cThey\u2019ve just targeted the market of mid priced hotel chains and recognized the demand for satisfactory but affordable hospitality services, somewhere between economic hotels and five-star hotels. They started out by blindly expanding their chain and acquiring hotels in third-and fourth-tier cities in a frenzy a few years ago. If they hadn\u2019t met Uncle Dubrule, they\u2019d probably still be losing money now.\u201dVictoria asked in astonishment, \u201cMr. Steele, is the Uncle Dubrule you mentioned, the international hotels\u2019 magnate, Paul Dubrule?\u201dPaul Dubrule was a legendary figure in the hospitality industry!Jordan nodded and said, \u201cYes, he\u2019s a friend of my grandfather.\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201d Victoria smiled but deep down, she was filled with utter shock. \u2018Jordan\u2019s family has such powerful connections! His grandfather\u2019s friend turns out to be a world-class magnate!\u2019Jordan said, \u201cI heard Uncle Dubrule mention before that a local hotelier has once requested to cooperate with him. I reckon it\u2019s Leonard Collins, Tyler\u2019s father. At that time, he managed to earn 15 million dollars in a year and have his hotel business take off, all thanks to Uncle Dubrule.\u201d\u201cI just need Uncle Dubrule to give him a little push again, and it\u2019ll be over for Leonard Collins\u2019 hotel business.\u201dJordan smiled. Leonard was subservient to Paul Dubrule and would obey all his words. Jordan would be able to easily defeat Leonard through Paul Dubrule\u2019s hands!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s me, Jordan Steele. How have you been lately? How\u2019s your health?\u201dJordan greeted politely over the phone.Paul Dubrule was overjoyed to receive a call from Jordan. \u201cJordan! It\u2019s been a long time since I heard your voice. I had just spoken to your grandfather over a video call yesterday, and he showed me his newly planted jasmine flowers.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m doing well. I\u2019m on vacation in Hawaii, how about you? I heard from your grandfather that you have completed your three-year experience of being a live-in son-in-law, and you\u2019re preparing to make it big in the business industry!\u201dJordan said, \u201cYes, I called you this time to talk to you about something regarding business. Do you remember a hotel chain called Era Express? I heard that you gave Leonard a crucial piece of advice that allowed him to become a billionaire within a short period.\u201dPaul Dubrule said, \u201cOh yes, I remember Leonard Collins. He has a lovely and elegant wife, and I have a deep impression of them. I heard that his hotel business has been encountering issues recently, and he has called me many times for help.\u201d\u201cDo you intend for me to help him again?\u201dJordan immediately explained, \u201cNo, on the contrary, I want you to harm him and point him to a path to destruction.\u201d\u201cWow, it seems that this unlucky guy has provoked someone he shouldn\u2019t have. Alright, leave it to me.\u201dAlthough Dubrule was an internationally-renowned hotel magnate, his status was still a notch below Jordan\u2019s grandfather.Jordan\u2019s grandfather had given him plenty of help over the years, so he would definitely do Jordan a favor.After Jordan hung up, Victoria asked, \u201cIs it settled?\u201dJordan nodded.Victoria said with great admiration, \u201cMr. Steele, you\u2019re really incredible. You can destroy the Collins with just a single phone call. I thought you\u2019d get into an intense battle against him!\u201dJordan said with a contemptuous smile, \u201cIntense battle? Hah, the Steeles are totally out of the Collins\u2019 league. How can they contend with us?\u201dVictoria was really envious of Jordan\u2019s family background. She wanted to marry a wealthy man like him just to see what their world was like.Victoria suddenly said, \u201cHowever, Mr. Dubrule was the one who guided Leonard Collins along and gave him the golden piece of advice. Even if Leonard Collins obeys him this time, it\u2019ll probably take some time for the losses of his failed investment to show.\u201d\u201cMeanwhile, Tyler and Hailey\u2019s wedding will probably be held in the next one or two months.\u201dJordan nodded and made another phone call.\u201cPablo.\u201d\u201cMr. Jordan!\u201d\u201cHave all your underlings recovered?\u201dJordan had previously instructed Pablo to send hundred-plus Southeast Asian subordinates to tarnish Zack\u2019s restaurant\u2019s reputation by pretending to get food poisoning from the food they served.In order to make their act even more convincing, they decided to really eat foods that would make them sick and ended up having to recuperate in the hospital for some time.Pablo said, \u201cThey\u2019ve all recovered a long time ago. What\u2019s the matter, Mr. Jordan? Feel free to give me orders!\u201dJordan said, \u201cSend each of your underlings to check into a room with a woman in Leonard Collins\u2019 hotel.\u201d\u201cWhen doing so, look around for pinhole cameras in the hotel room. If there are any, find the footage. If there aren\u2019t any, install one in each room and then expose the video of your underlings doing the deed with their respective partners.\u201dPablo and Victoria both understood what Jordan intended to do.He was planning to destroy the reputation of the Collins\u2019 hotels. The discovery that the Collins\u2019 hotel rooms had pinhole cameras would constitute a violation of the privacy of the hotel guests, which would negatively impact the hotel\u2019s business.Victoria said with a sultry smile, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to come up with such a plan, Mr. Steele.\u201dJordan chuckled and said, \u201cThe world of business is like a battlefield. What I want is victory, and the means by which I obtain it doesn\u2019t matter at all.\u201dIf Jordan didn\u2019t have a year of experience on the battlefield, he wouldn\u2019t have been so relentless.Now, all he wanted was to win!Jordan reached his hand out and said, \u201cContinue.\u201dVictoria picked up the document and said while looking at it, \u201cTyler Collins doesn\u2019t work in his father\u2019s company. He took a few dozens of millions of dollars from his father and used it to set up a company. When he first started out, he incurred major losses, but his business has been taking off in the last two years.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s now a professional angel investor. Last year, he created an eight-million-dollar fund and invested in 40 companies. Half of his investments failed, but he made book gains of 16 million dollars.\u201d\u201cOh, that punk made some money out of it?\u201d Jordan was surprised.He knew that the failure of 20 out of 40 investments wasn\u2019t considered much. Even if the failure rate was 90%, the remaining 10% of companies that succeeded would bring him enough profit.Victoria nodded and said, \u201cYes, he made another major investment this year, and he has now invested in a total of 70 companies. The investment manager of his company predicted that they would be able to make a profit of 48 million dollars this year if they\u2019re lucky.\u201dJordan humphed coldly. \u2018I\u2019m not going to let Tyler Collins have the best of both worlds\u2019Jordan said, \u201cFind out which 70 companies he invested in. Ignore those that have shut down or are in decline. Find out which ones Tyler Collins is profiting from and then boycott them!\u201d\u201cI want to make Tyler lose every single cent that he had invested! I want to make sure he ends up with nothing!\u201dOnly then did Victoria realize how truly terrifying Jordan was. \u201cYes!\u201dAfterward, Victoria added, \u201cTyler has an older brother, but he\u2019s not very competent. He\u2019s just waiting to inherit his father\u2019s legacy.\u201d\u201cHowever, Tyler\u2019s mother, Rosie Huxley, is the daughter of the Huxley family, which is a top-tier family in New York. She has a powerful background, and we must pay attention to her.\u201dJordan was stunned. \u201cRosie Huxley? Sounds like an elegant name. Do you have a photo of her?\u201dPaul Dubrule also said Leonard\u2019s wife was beautiful and elegant during the call just now.Jordan was curious about the woman who left a deep impression on Paul Dubrule.Victoria logged into Instagram and searched for Rosie\u2019s page before handing her cell phone to Jordan so that he could take a look.Jordan was presented with a photo of a gorgeous woman who had combed her wavy hair to the side.Her makeup wasn\u2019t too thick, but her lipstick was of bright color. She was wearing a tight dress and standing in front of a microphone.She looked just like a songstress in her 30\u2019s.Jordan was slightly stunned. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that punk Tyler Collins\u2019 mother to be so beautiful.\u201dVictoria smiled and said, \u201cAll the members of the upper-class circle in Orlando think that Leonard Collins isn\u2019t worthy of Rosie Huxley because her family is way richer than his. Back then, he resorted to despicable means to marry her.\u201dNot interested in the family history of the Collins, Jordan returned Victoria\u2019s cell phone to her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to care about the Huxleys.\u201dJordan was well aware of which families he couldn\u2019t afford to offend in this country, so apart from them, he didn\u2019t give a hoot about the rest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Enigma Co. has shut down too? Damn it, how can it wind up when it\u2019s doing so well?\u201dTyler was speaking on the phone in the driver\u2019s seat, looking extremely vexed and troubled.Enigma Co. was the most profitable one of the 70 companies that Tyler had invested in.However, for some reason, the companies he had been profiting from were suddenly targeted by companies in the same industry and had to wind up for some reason.When you factor in Tyler\u2019s losses from his failed investments in 40 to 50 companies, he had lost almost all his money.\u201cDamn it! I\u2019m so unlucky!\u201dTyler slapped the steering wheel in exasperation before calling his father again.\u201cDad, I\u2019ve been out of luck lately, and some of the companies that I invested in, which have been generating the most profit for me, have suddenly folded. Can you lend me another 15 million dollars?\u201dLeonard said, \u201cThe family company is also in need of money lately. Two days ago, I spoke to the international hotel magnate, Paul Dubrule, and he told me to reopen all the hotels that we\u2019ve closed down in the past. He also told me to set up more branches in the third-tier and fourth-tier cities.\u201dTyler asked in bewilderment, \u201cDad, didn\u2019t he used to oppose vehemently when we expanded rapidly like that in the past?\u201dLeonard said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything at all! Times have changed! Even migrant workers can afford to stay in hotels these days. There is no longer a pressing demand for high-quality services. Quantity is now the most important! We\u2019re planning to invest most of our money in this.\u201dTyler was stunned. If they were going to invest most of their family assets, that would amount to at least a few hundred million dollars!If they profited from it, it would be fine, but if they incurred losses\u2026It would be over for the Collins.Tyler said, \u201cDad, I disagree with that! We shouldn\u2019t put all our eggs in a single basket! What if Master Dubrule\u2019s advice is wrong this time? We are at the risk of going bankrupt!\u201dLeonard said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. We should diversify our investments. Okay, I see you\u2019ve done well in investing in the past year. I shall give you 75 million dollars! Go ahead and invest boldly! Even if we fail this time, we can still count on you.\u201d\u201cThanks, Dad! I\u2019m going to turn 75 million dollars into 750 million dollars!\u201d Tyler said excitedly.At this moment, the alluring Hailey got into the passenger\u2019s seat.Noticing how Tyler was beaming with joy, Hailey asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s making you so happy?\u201dTyler said, \u201cMy father gave me another 75 million dollars! Haha, Hailey, how does it feel to be Mrs. Collins? These 75 million dollars will soon become 750 million dollars!\u201dHailey was overjoyed to hear that, and she secretly thought, \u2018The Collins are so rich, Tyler\u2019s father actually just gave him 75 million dollars so casually.\u2019Hailey took the initiative to hold Tyler\u2019s hand and said, \u201cTyler, I\u2019m so happy to be married to you. I\u2019ve never had so much money before.\u201dTyler said proudly, \u201cThat goes without a word! Jordan\u2019s good-for-nothing father probably couldn\u2019t even give you a few thousand dollars, haha!\u201d\u201cBy the way, since we\u2019ve already registered our marriage, shouldn\u2019t you be changing the way you address me?\u201dHailey hesitated for a moment before saying, \u201cHub\u2026 Hubby.\u201dThis was the first time she had ever called another man \u2018Hubby\u2019 because she used to only address Jordan that way in the past.At this moment, she suddenly missed Jordan and all the times when she called him \u2018Hubby\u2019 in the past three years.Jordan was a live-in son-in-law who had a low status in the family. Hence, Hailey would only address him as \u2018Hubby\u2019 when she was in an excellent mood.Hence, she would be smiling whenever she did that.However, Hailey wasn\u2019t smiling when she called Tyler\u2019 Hubby\u2019; instead, she felt a little morose.\u2018Maybe, this is the destiny of my relationship with Jordan.\u2019After being emotional for a moment, Hailey quickly snapped back to her current role.Hailey said, \u201cHubby, send me to Ace Corporation. I\u2019d like to personally deliver the wedding invitations to Mr. Steele and Miss Clarke.\u201dHailey\u2019s and Tyler\u2019s wedding was held on the 12th of May, which was in a week.The Camdens and the Ace Corporation were now in cooperation for a project named \u2018Hailey Residences\u2019. Hailey was the deputy director of the project.Tyler said, \u201cSure. By the way, are you going to invite Jordan?\u201dFeeling a little awkward, Hailey said, \u201cHe\u2019s my ex-husband. Why should we invite him?\u201dTyler laughed and said, \u201cThat\u2019ll make things interesting. Do you have any unused invitation cards? Give me one. I\u2019m going to invite him!\u201dTyler took out an unused wedding invitation card from Hailey\u2019s bag and a pen, after which he wrote Jordan\u2019s name on it.At the bottom of the card, he wrote: \u201cIf you\u2019re a man, turn up for the wedding so you can see what a grand and lavish wedding is like!\u201dAfter writing on the card, Tyler shoved it to Hailey.Hailey knew that Tyler intended to put Jordan to shame that day and let all the guests see that there was a world of difference between Hailey\u2019s former husband and his current one!\u201cBy the way, Hailey, come sleepover at mine tonight. I\u2019ve been really vexed the past couple of days. The companies that I\u2019ve invested in have closed down. I need you to relieve my stress.\u201dTyler held Hailey\u2019s hand.By right, Hailey could totally move in with him since they had already registered their marriage.However, Hailey refuted, \u201cMy grandmother said that I can\u2019t stay over at your place before we get married. Just wait a little longer. We\u2019re going to have our wedding in a week anyway.\u201dFeeling a little displeased, Tyler snapped, \u201cYour grandmother is so conservative! Ugh, we\u2019ve known each other for such a long time, but I\u2019ve only slept with you once. But I still beat Jordan because he hasn\u2019t gotten a chance to sleep with you at all, even though he was married to you for three years. Haha.\u201dHailey lowered her head and said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s not talk about him. Start driving.\u201dThe engine was started quickly, and the speed soon went up to 80 mph. Hailey looked out of the window and pondered to herself.\u2018Jordan, you can\u2019t blame me for not letting you get intimate with me in the past three years. Actually, I have feelings for you too, but if I really gave myself to you, Tyler would definitely love me a lot less than he does now. He wouldn\u2019t want to marry me either.\u2019\u2018If you must, just blame it on the fact that we met at the wrong time!\u2019More than twenty minutes later, Hailey arrived at Ace Corporation.Hailey\u2019s long hair was draped over her shoulders, and she was wearing a pair of square-shaped earrings, a white shirt, and a pair of black, high-waisted trousers.She looked clean, beautiful, and exuded the mature aura of a married woman.Bang! Bang!Hailey knocked on the door of Victoria\u2019s office.\u201cCome in.\u201dAs soon as Hailey entered, Victoria stood up immediately and said, \u201cMrs. Collins, you look gorgeous today. You married a rich man, and now, you look even nobler than before.\u201dHailey could hear the sarcasm in Victoria\u2019s words and smile.\u201d Thank you for the compliment. I still need another ten years to catch up to your sartorial sense and elegance, Miss Clarke.\u201d\u201cBy the way, I\u2019m here today to deliver my wedding invitations to you and Mr. Steele.\u201dVictoria was a little shocked. \u201cHave you settled on the wedding date?\u201dHailey said, \u201cYes, it\u2019s on the 12th of May, which is a week from now.\u201dVictoria was instantly stunned. \u201cThe 12th of May? Isn\u2019t that Jordan\u2019s birthday?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve also seen Jordan\u2019s ID, so I remember it well.\u201d\u201cMrs. Collins, Jordan is your ex-husband, and you guys were once in love, right? It seems a little insensitive of you to hold your wedding on his birthday. Or did you simply forget that his birthday falls on the same day?\u201dHailey said, \u201cOf course I remember his birthday! However, the wedding date was set by the Collins, and I also tried persuading Tyler to pick another date. Still, he insisted on the 12th of May. I couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201dTyler had already checked up on Jordan\u2019s profile and knew that his birthday was on the 12th of May. Thus, he deliberately chose to set his wedding with Hailey on this day to agitate Jordan!Not wanting to continue talking about Jordan, Hailey decided to change the subject. \u201cWhere\u2019s Mr. Steele? Is he in the office? Can I pass the invitation card to him?\u201dVictoria said, \u201cI think so, be my guest.Victoria knew that Jordan was in the office. Still, there was no way she could tell Hailey that Jordan was Mr. Steele, as in the president of Ace Corporation.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to attend our wedding on the 12th of May.\u201dHailey smiled and handed the invitation card to Victoria before going to the president\u2019s office.Bang! Bang!Hailey knocked on the door.\u201cCome in.\u201dHailey pushed the door open, only to be disappointed to see that Jordan was the only one around. \u201cMr. Steele isn\u2019t in, huh?\u201dJordan happened to have stood up to throw something into the bin, so he wasn\u2019t at the president\u2019s desk, but he couldn\u2019t be bothered to explain either. \u201cDo you have a problem?\u201dHailey handed the wedding invitation to Jordan and said, \u201cHand this to Mr. Steele when he\u2019s here.\u201dThere was a sky-blue ribbon on the white, floral-die-cut base of the invitation card, which seemed rather luxurious and opulent.When Jordan saw it, he was stunned. \u201cThis\u2026\u201dHailey said, \u201cTyler and I have settled on a wedding date. It\u2019s going to be on the 12th of May, which is also your birthday.\u201dJordan stared at Hailey angrily.Hailey frantically explained, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I wasn\u2019t the one who decided on the date.\u201dJordan was furious at first, but he soon seemed to think of something and burst into laughter again.\u2018You chose to hold your wedding on my birthday. Do you have a death wish?\u2019Jordan took the wedding invitation and said, \u201cCongratulations, Hailey Camden, you\u2019ve finally married a wealthy man.\u201dKnowing that Jordan was upset, Hailey hesitated for a moment but nevertheless gave him an invitation too.\u201cThis one\u2019s for you.\u201dJordan smiled because he didn\u2019t expect to receive two invitation cards to his ex-wife\u2019s wedding.He deliberately opened it to take a look. He saw that there was an additional line of words on the invitation card to \u201cJordan\u201d \u2014 \u2018If you\u2019re a man, turn up for the wedding so you can see what a grand and lavish wedding is like!\u2019On the other hand, the invitation card to \u201cMr. Steele\u201d read:\u2018To Mr. Steele, President of Ace Corporation:Dear Mr. Steele, the wedding ceremony is scheduled to be held at 11:00 AM on the 12th of May at the Ritz Carlton Orlando. Everyone knows that you are a whale of the business industry, the Collins and the Collins have been in awe of you for a long time. We hope to have the honor of meeting you, and we will indeed host you with the best hospitality!\u201dJordan looked at both the wedding invitation cards and couldn\u2019t help but find it ironic.Both invitations were to him but as different identities. Yet, there was a world of difference between the content of both cards!That\u2019s how pragmatic society is!It was no wonder that Hailey wanted to marry into a wealthy family.Hailey couldn\u2019t understand the meaning behind Jordan\u2019s smile, but she nevertheless said, \u201cI think you\u2019d better not turn up. I know you still love me, and you\u2019ll definitely be devastated on the day of my wedding. If you end up having too much to drink and kick up a fuss, it\u2019d be too embarrassing for me.\u201dJordan sneered. \u201cHah, do you think I\u2019d kick up a fuss at your wedding for your sake? Hailey Camden, you\u2019re overthinking! Since your husband wants me to go so badly, I will. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t get drunk, and I won\u2019t get into fights or create trouble for you.\u201dHailey nodded and said, \u201cAlright then.\u201dHailey knew that Jordan was extremely good at fighting, and if he lost his temper, no one would be able to stop him from creating trouble.\u201cBy the way, how are you considering the matter I mentioned to you previously?\u201dHailey suddenly lowered her volume and asked sneakily like a thief.\u201cWhat are you referring to?\u201d Jordan didn\u2019t immediately process what she was saying.Hailey smacked Jordan\u2019s arm angrily. \u201cDimwit, I\u2019m referring to the matter I mentioned to you at the concert the other day.\u201dOnly then did Jordan realize what she meant. \u201cYou mean the matter regarding me being your standby lover and waiting for you for three years? Hah, I told you, it\u2019s impossible!\u201d\u201cHailey Camden, you can\u2019t get the best of both worlds. You can only choose one, but unfortunately, you chose Tyler Collins!\u201dHailey was enraged too. \u201cUnfortunate, my ass! Unfortunately, I chose you! I\u2019m not going to divorce Tyler. We\u2019ll stay a loving couple for the rest of our lives while you remain single, grumpy, and jealous for the rest of your life!\u201dAfter lashing out at Jordan, she was still displeased. She continued after a pause, \u201cJordan, just keep pretending. I know you\u2019re putting on a strong front. When you see how happy I am on the day of my wedding to a wealthy man, you\u2019ll definitely cry like a dog!\u201dAfter saying that, Hailey rushed out in exasperation.\u2018Cry like a dog? Hah, I\u2019m afraid you and Tyler Collins will be the ones crying on that day!\u2019Jordan didn\u2019t say those words out loud, but he would definitely make it happen.On the day of their wedding, Hailey will discover that she had let the king of business in Orlando slip!Meanwhile, she had married a poor man who was about to go bankrupt!In a fit of anger, Jordan tore both the wedding invitations to pieces!At this moment, Victoria entered, and when she saw that, she said, \u201cTyler Collins really has a death wish. How dare he choose to get married on your birthday? He obviously wants to upset you!\u201dJordan humphed coldly. \u201cHe wants to provoke me by doing that? He\u2019s just a mere investor. Who is he to compare to me? Victoria, inform all our business partners of the date of my birthday.\u201dVictoria said with a smile, \u201cYes!\u201d She had long wanted to throw a grand birthday party for Jordan.\u2026A week later.At six o\u2019clock in the morning of the 12th of May.\u201cDamn it! I lost again! How did this happen!?! Isn\u2019t this a proper and user-friendly game? Why did the developer get seized for breaking the rules?\u201dTyler stayed up all night in his groom\u2019s suit and spoke on the phone in his room.The 75 million dollars that his father gave him have been invested in more than 200 companies in the past week!More than half of the investments failed, which was normal.He was making considerable returns on his investments in more than ten out of those 200-odd companies at first. However, they suddenly faced problems one after another.Besides, the problems were not trivial as they put those companies either on the verge of bankruptcy or destruction!Almost all 75 million dollars that Tyler had invested were gone!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Still, the losses incurred from his failed investments made him, a young man in his twenties, seem like he had aged by several decades all of a sudden.Additionally to the investments he made in the failed companies, he lost a lot of money this week in other investments.He had lost all the money he invested in stock index futures, commodities, and even underground gambling bets.A young man who had a best man\u2019s corsage in hand was standing beside Tyler.He said, \u201cTyler, did you offend someone? From the way I see it, it seems that you are being targeted by someone. Even if you invested blindly, the failure rate can\u2019t be 100%!\u201dTyler rubbed his extremely dark under-eye circles and nodded. \u201cTurns out it\u2019s really possible! It must be that someone is f**king targeting me on purpose! It can\u2019t be a mistake with my judgment!\u201d\u201cHowever, I haven\u2019t offended anyone in the past two years, except for Hailey\u2019s ex-husband, Jordan Steele. I even made him a cuckold. Well, he might be good at fighting, but he knows nothing about business. He\u2019s just a good-for-nothing bodyguard, and there\u2019s no way he can do anything to me when it comes to business.\u201dThe best man fiddled with the corsage in his right hand. He said with a smile, \u201cTyler, Hailey is the most beautiful girl in Orlando, and Jordan Steele is not the only one who fancies her. Not to mention others, even I find it difficult to stay calm in front of her. Yet, you managed to win her heart. Which man in Orlando wouldn\u2019t be jealous of you?\u201dTyler thought about it carefully and felt that there was indeed such a possibility.\u201cF**k, it must be some old lecher in the business circle of Orlando who has taken a liking to Hailey. That\u2019s why he\u2019s targeting me! Hailey Camden is such a jinx. We haven\u2019t even had our wedding yet, and I\u2019ve already lost 75 million dollars because of her!\u201dThe best man said with a playful smile, \u201cYou can\u2019t say that. Your family is not short of those 75 million dollars, and you can totally afford to lose it. Since you\u2019ve lost all your money, you can just leech off your father and go work at his company.\u201d\u201cBut the gorgeous Hailey Camden is now yours, and you can do whatever you want to her. That old lecher may be a powerful businessman, but you\u2019ve beaten him in terms of love.\u201dTyler laughed loudly after hearing that. \u201cJake, you\u2019re right! How dare that damned love rival of mine make me lose 75 million dollars?! Hahaha!\u201dWith that thought, Tyler immediately called Hailey.Hailey was already up and was having her makeup done. She quickly answered, \u201cHello.\u201d\u201cHoney, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m doing my makeup and trying on the wedding gown.\u201d\u201cHehe, Honey, you\u2019d better get some more sleep now!\u201dHailey hung up with some disgruntlement.\u201cWas that Tyler? What did he say?\u201dHailey\u2019s best friend, Rachel Quinn, was right beside her and watching her do her makeup.Hailey tossed her Apple cell phone to the side and barked, \u201cSome lewd things! Tyler is so tacky! If it isn\u2019t because he has a wealthy family, I wouldn\u2019t have married him! Jordan is so much better than him. He\u2019s so mellow and soft-spoken.\u201dRachel laughed and teased, \u201cSweetie, it\u2019s not very appropriate of you to compliment your ex-husband while getting ready for your wedding to another man.\u201dHailey\u2019s emotions became complicated when she thought about Jordan. \u201cRachel, Jordan doesn\u2019t want to be my standby lover. What should I do? What if he\u2019s already married when I get divorced a few years from now?\u201dRachel didn\u2019t answer and instead asked Hailey to stand up.Standing in front of a mirror in a white wedding dress, Hailey looked like an ethereal fairy.Her beauty was angelic!Rachel touched Hailey\u2019s delicate face and said while looking into the mirror. \u201cLook at your beautiful face. Which man can resist you? Trust me, you\u2019ll get him! Jordan is destined to be a standby lover for the rest of his life!\u201d\u2026One hour later, in a luxurious villa cluster in Orlando.The villas here were top-notch and were priced at over 20 grand per square meter.In one of the villas, Tyler\u2019s parents, Leonard Collins and Rosie Huxley, were getting dressed up in front of the mirror too.Rosie was dressed in a red dress, looking rather dignified and elegant. Among women in their forties in Orlando, she could be considered the best in terms of figure and appearance.Not only was she charming and attractive, but her character and upbringing were also considered exemplary in the upper-class circle.While helping Leonard tie his tie, she said, \u201cLeonard, I think the company\u2019s recent expansion plan is too risky because it involves the investment of all the company\u2019s capital, and we even had to take up a large loan. You shouldn\u2019t be so trusting of Paul.\u201dLeonard barked furiously, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t trust Paul back then, our company wouldn\u2019t even have had the chance to be listed! What are you so worried about? I didn\u2019t use a single cent of yours!\u201dRosie said slowly, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. If you\u2019re really confident about this, I can ask the Huxleys for some money for you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it!\u201d Leonard suddenly became extremely furious. \u201cThe Huxleys have always looked down on me, so this time, I\u2019m going to show them how I can make a comeback!\u201dSeeing how worked up Leonard had gotten, she quickly patted him and said comfortingly, \u201cOkay, okay, let\u2019s drop the subject. It\u2019s our son\u2019s big day.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else. I heard that Tyler also invited Hailey Camden\u2019s ex-husband to the wedding with the intention of humiliating him in public. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea. Try persuading Tyler not to do that. I heard that Hailey Camden\u2019s ex-husband is good at fighting and not to be trifled with.\u201dLeonard humphed coldly. \u201cWhat for? Her ex-husband is just a lowly bodyguard. If Tyler wants to humiliate him, let him be. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d be amusing since he can fight. There will be many government officials at the wedding today. Let\u2019s see if he dares to do anything!\u201dRosie shook her head. \u2018Like father, like son. They\u2019re both so stubborn.\u2019However, Leonard\u2019s expression changed.He suddenly said, \u201cDon\u2019t bother about Hailey\u2019s ex-husband. However, there is a guest we ought to pay attention to. I heard from Victoria that Mr. Steele, the president of Ace Corporation, will be attending the wedding today. You know how mysterious this Mr. Steele is, and I heard that he\u2019s the owner of those new restaurants like Cloud Cafeteria and the newly established karaoke joints and nightclubs.\u201d\u201cHe is now the giant in the food, entertainment, logistics, and business industries! Many people call him the king of Orlando!\u201dRosie frowned. \u201cVictoria? The way you say her name is so affectionate, huh?\u201dLeonard smiled and cajoled her. \u201cWell, we\u2019re just old friends, don\u2019t think that much about it. There\u2019s nothing between Miss Clarke and me. Don\u2019t vent your jealousy and disgruntlement on Mr. Steele later. We can\u2019t offend him.\u201dRosie said, \u201cI\u2019m not an insensible woman. Okay, I will definitely serve Mr. Steele well when I see him later.\u201d\u2026A few more hours passed. It was now ten in the morning.Victoria arrived at the Rose Garden villa area where Jordan lived.Jordan had already washed up and gotten dressed in a handsome suit long ago.\u201cMr. Steele, you look so\u2026 dashing today.\u201dVictoria said, genuinely complimenting him from the bottom of her heart.Jordan straightened his tie and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019m going to let everyone in Orlando find out today that the president of Ace Corporation is me, Jordan Steele, the abandoned son-in-law of the Camdens!\u201dVictoria walked behind Jordan, her hands trembling with excitement!This day is finally here!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He happily went over to receive Hailey.When he arrived at the first floor of the villa, he ran into Elle before even going forward to pick up Hailey.Elle wasn\u2019t a bridesmaid, but she was similarly dressed in white and had dolled herself up gorgeously.\u201cWow, Elle, you look so pretty today. I almost thought you were my bride.\u201dTyler teased when he saw Elle.Elle fiddled with her hair with her right hand and said, \u201cPsht, my groom-to-be is the esteemed president of Ace Corporation.\u201dTyler exclaimed in a moment of epiphany, \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re dressed to the nines today, Elle. It turns out it\u2019s all for Mr. Steele!\u201dElle nodded and said, \u201cOf course, I heard that Mr. Steele is definitely going to attend your wedding today. Tyler, I didn\u2019t expect that Mr. Steele would show up for the Collins\u2019 sake. He has always been mysterious and unwilling to meet anyone.\u201dTyler said with a smug smile, \u201cHaha, that goes without a word. The Collins are a top-tier family in Orlando. It\u2019s only right for Mr. Steele to do us a favor.\u201d\u201cElle, from today onwards, we will be a family. We must keep in touch.\u201dElle said, \u201cOkay, I will remember what I promised you. Now go pick Hailey up.\u201dElle couldn\u2019t wait to go to the wedding venue, but of course, it wasn\u2019t because she was looking forward to the wedding itself.She was looking forward to meeting her Prince Charming, Mr. Steele, the president of Ace Corporation!An hour later.In Ritz Carlton Hotel Orlando.As expected of a wedding held by a top family in Orlando, a continuous line of luxury cars belonging to the invited guests streaming into the hotel.Leonard and Rosie were busy receiving the guests.\u201cMr. Sanders! It\u2019s really a great honor for my son that you\u2019re here to attend his wedding!\u201d\u201cChief Brown! Welcome, welcome, you must drink more water.\u201d\u201cVice-Mayor Dyer! Welcome, please pardon me, I haven\u2019t been able to entertain you well. I\u2019ll punish myself by toasting you later. Haha, please have a seat quickly.\u201dWatching Leonard and Rosie greet the dignified officials, Hailey, who was now clad in a white wedding dress, was just as elated.She secretly thought to herself, \u2018The Collins have such an impressive social circle! Many of the guests here weren\u2019t even present at Grandma\u2019s birthday banquet. They\u2019re probably the bigwigs of the business and political circles of Orlando. It\u2019s great to be married to such a powerful family. The wedding is so grand, unlike when I married Jordan. At that time, the guests who attended our wedding were only there for our family! There wasn\u2019t even a proper guest!\u2019Hailey actually fancied Jordan more than Tyler.Nevertheless, Tyler, in her opinion, had a much better family background and could provide her with a lot of material comfort that would satisfy her vanity and make her happy. Hence, she felt that Jordan was way inferior to Tyler in those aspects.At this moment, she didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit of regret for divorcing Jordan. Instead, she was thankful that she had done so.All of a sudden, the crowd got into an uproar.\u201cMr. Walton! Oh my gosh! Mr. Walton is here!\u201dLeonard got a great shock, and he hurriedly strode over to give Mr. Walton a handshake with both hands. \u201cWelcome, Mr. Walton. It\u2019s such a huge honor for me to have you here!\u201dTyler, Hailey, and the rest of the Camdens covered their mouths in astonishment.\u2018The Collins are acquainted with one of the richest men in the country?\u2019The Collins were only a top-tier family in Orlando.Meanwhile, the Waltons were among the top 20 richest families in the country!They were on completely different levels!Leonard said loudly, \u201cWho helped me to invite Mr. Walton? I\u2019ll definitely thank you greatly later!\u201dMr. Walton shook hands with Leonard and said with a smile on his face, \u201cMr. Collins, you\u2019re too polite. I hope you won\u2019t mind that I came here uninvited today.\u201dMr. Walton didn\u2019t actually know the Collins at all, and he didn\u2019t have an invitation to the wedding either. Hence, he managed to enter entirely because of his status.Leonard said, \u201cMr. Walton, you\u2019re standing on ceremony with us. It\u2019s my son\u2019s honor, and also mine, to have you here! Did you make a special trip here because of something important?\u201dLeonard, who was also a businessman, was well aware of Mr. Walton\u2019s busy schedule, and knew that he frequently travelled for business to meet powerful businessmen and politicians. He wouldn\u2019t have the time to attend a stranger\u2019s wedding at all.Hence, Leonard guessed that Mr. Walton must have gone to the wedding for something important.Mr. Walton said with a smile, \u201cTo be frank, I came here to give the newlyweds my blessings and also to meet Mr. Steele, the president of Ace Corporation.\u201dHis first reason could be ignored because it was merely said out of courtesy. However, the latter half of his sentence gave Leonard a great shock.\u2018Even one of the richest men in the world yearns to see Mr. Steele?\u2019\u2018In that case, this mysterious Mr. Steele might be even richer than Mr. Walton!\u2019At this point, everyone had even more respect for the president of Ace Corporation.Leonard hurriedly said, \u201cMr. Walton, please take a seat quickly. I\u2019ll call the deputy president of Ace Corporation immediately and ask them where they are now.\u201d\u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d Mr. Walton thanked with both hands. He greeted the other businessmen smilingly without putting on airs at all. However, he was one of the richest men in the country.\u201cMr. Steele\u2026\u201dHailey was filled with great curiosity about the president of Ace Corporation when she saw that.\u201cWhat kind of girl would be worthy enough to be Mr. Steele\u2019s wife? How pretty must she be, and what should her family background be like? Ah, I\u2019d better not think about it.\u201dUnlike Elle, who kept harboring unrealistic fantasies, Hailey admitted that she wasn\u2019t worthy of being the president of Ace Corporation.Leonard arranged for Mr. Walton to be seated, he immediately called Victoria.\u201cVictoria, have you and Mr. Steele left yet?\u201dVictoria answered, \u201cWe\u2019re going to reach the entrance of the hotel soon.\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019re already at the entrance? I\u2019ll go out to receive you guys now!\u201dLeonard was overjoyed and immediately rushed to say to his wife and children, \u201cMr. Steele and Mr. Steele have arrived at the entrance. Come with me to greet them!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dTyler, Hailey, and the others tagged along.\u201cAh! My dear Mr. Steele is here! Grandma, Dad, let\u2019s go over there too!\u201dElle jumped up in excitement.Diana nodded and said, \u201cMr. Steele is our business partner, so we naturally have to go.\u201dWhen the other guests heard what they said, they immediately got up from their seats as well.\u201cI heard that Mr. Steele, the president of Ace Corporation, has acquired many restaurants and entertainment joints. He\u2019s also monopolizing many industries in Orlando now!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not all, I also heard that he has just destroyed dozens of companies and pushed them to bankruptcy in the past month, for no rhyme or reason!\u201d\u201cQuick, look, even Mr. Walton has gone to the entrance. Let\u2019s all go see who this amazing Mr. Steele is!\u201d\u201cI must take the opportunity to befriend Mr. Steele today!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAt the hotel entrance, a white Maybach Landaulet, which was priced at 1.8 million dollars and was once known as the \u201cworld\u2019s most expensive car\u201d, was driven over slowly and stopped in front of the entrance.The hotel service staff opened the door, and Victoria stepped out of the car in a white dress.Everyone knew that the next one to get out of the car would be Mr. Steele!Next, Jordan alighted from the car in a white suit!Victoria held Jordan\u2019s arm and introduced him to Leonard, \u201cMr. Collins, this is Mr. Steele, the president of Ace Corporation!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the same time, everyone stared at him with their eyes full of admiration.In the eyes of the crowd, Jordan was noble and refined, like the prince of a fairytale.Unlike Tyler and the others, Leonard had never met Jordan before this.Leonard excitedly shook Jordan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cWelcome, Mr. Steele. It\u2019s a great honor for my son and I to have you here!\u201dRosie was in disbelief too. \u201cMr. Steele, I didn\u2019t expect that you\u2019re so young and handsome!\u201dJordan glanced at Rosie and said, \u201cYou must be Mrs. Collins. Indeed, you\u2019re such a ravishing beauty.\u201dLeonard said with a smile, \u201cThank you for the compliment. She is indeed my wife.\u201dAs a woman in her forties, Rosie felt excited and a little shy to have been complimented by a young man in his twenties.At this moment, Tyler flew into a rage when he saw Jordan brazenly ogling at his mother and complimenting her frivolously.\u201cJordan Steele, why are you pretending to be the president of Ace Corporation!?! You\u2019re just Victoria Clarke\u2019s bodyguard!\u201dHailey was also puzzled as to why Victoria would play along with Jordan.All the invited guests of the wedding were dignified figures of Orlando, and Hailey felt it wasn\u2019t appropriate for Victoria to deceive everyone like this.Before Jordan could say anything, Mr. Walton had already walked over to give him a handshake.\u201cMr. Steele, I\u2019ve heard of you a long time ago. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201dJordan got a tremendous shock too. \u201cMr. Walton? Do you know the Collins too?\u201dIf Mr. Walton and the Collins were closely acquainted, Jordan would indeed be a little stumped.Although Jordan was ultimately still the most powerful one, Mr. Walton was, after all, one of the top tycoons in the country.Mr. Walton waved his hand and said, \u201cNo, no, I came specifically to see you after hearing that you\u2019d be here in Orlando a few days ago. In fact, three years ago, I had dinner with your grandfather in LA. Mr. Steele, your grandfather, is my idol, and I\u2019ve always wanted to revisit him, but I\u2019m afraid I might disturb him. Has he been well lately?\u201dBoth Tyler and Hailey were surprised to learn that Mr. Walton knew Jordan\u2019s grandfather.\u2018Could he have made a mistake?\u2019 they wondered.Jordan said with a smile, \u201cMy grandfather has been well lately, and he has mentioned you to me before, Mr. Walton. Grandpa says that you\u2019re a legendary figure and a business prodigy. He\u2019s looking forward to catching up with you too.\u201d\u201cMy grandfather is in England now. How about this? Inform me if you happen to go to England, and I will arrange a time for you to meet.\u201dMr. Walton immediately said excitedly, \u201cThat\u2019s great. Shall we exchange numbers?\u201dMr. Walton took out his cell phone and keyed Jordan\u2019s number into his contacts.All the bigwigs of the business industry who were present were all green with envy as they wanted Mr. Walton\u2019s number too!Yet, Mr. Walton, who was high up in the air, actually took the initiative to ask for Jordan\u2019s number!After getting Jordan\u2019s number, Mr. Walton said, \u201cI have another meeting to attend. I\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201dMr. Walton left after another handshake with Jordan.As soon as Mr. Walton left, someone appeared out of nowhere.He scurried up to Jordan and knelt down in front of him while kowtowing incessantly.The crowd was stunned, and so was Tyler, who took a look and then exclaimed, \u201cMr. Dunn? Aren\u2019t you Mr. Dunn, the general agent of Ubereats Orlando? I haven\u2019t seen you in such a long time, where have you been? Why are you kowtowing to Jordan Steele?\u201dYes, it was Ryan Dunn who had fired Jordan back then!Ryan looked at Tyler and said, \u201cI went to DC to look for Mr. Jones and begged him to let me become the general agent again, and it took me more than half a month to convince him. \u201cAs long as Mr. Steele is willing to forgive me, he would be willing to continue cooperating with me, he told me.\u201dAfter explaining, Ryan continued to kowtow to Jordan. \u201cMr. Steele! Mr. Steele! I was wrong! I shouldn\u2019t have offended you. I didn\u2019t know how powerful you are. It\u2019s all because of the Camdens\u2019 instigation. I have nothing against you at all. This is all just a misunderstanding! Please forgive me, Mr. Steele!\u201dAll the Camdens were stunned. Herman asked, \u201cMr. Dunn, are you sure that Jordan is the president of Ace Corporation? Don\u2019t get the wrong person!\u201dRyan turned around and hollered at Herman, \u201cMistake, my foot! Mr. Jones told me himself that Mr. Steele is the one who asked him to remove my rights as the general agent. If it wasn\u2019t because of you, I wouldn\u2019t have ended up in such a situation!\u201dHerman swallowed his saliva. \u2018Could it be that Jordan had indeed made a call to the boss of Ubereats during the birthday banquet the other day?\u2019\u2018Did he really remove Ryan Dunn as the general agent with just a single phone call?\u2019\u201cMr. Steele! Mr. Steele!\u201dAt this moment, another person started wailing too.A middle-aged man walked over in a disheveled state.\u201cIsn\u2019t that Zack Smith who owns Sunny Restaurant? Why is he dressed so shabbily? How did he get reduced to this state?\u201d\u201cHis restaurants have faced stiff competition from Cloud Cafeteria, and there\u2019s barely any business every day. He\u2019s long since started struggling!\u201dSomeone recognized Zack, the owner of Sunny Restaurant.Zack walked up to Jordan and also knelt down in front of him beside Ryan. \u201cMr. Steele! I was wrong! I failed to recognize a formidable figure like you\u2026\u201dRyan said, \u201cDon\u2019t copy my lines.\u201dZack ignored him and continued, \u201cIt\u2019s all the Camdens\u2019 fault for instigating me. I was really forced to go against you during the banquet then! Mr. Steele, please just treat me like a nobody and let me off!\u201dZack really couldn\u2019t hold up any longer. Famous singers were performing at Cloud Cafeteria every single day, and the prices of the food were affordable too. Jordan was spending money to deal with Zack, but Zack couldn\u2019t afford to play this game with him at all.Seeing that Ryan and Zack were both kneeling down in front of Jordan, Tyler no longer thought that they were just mistaken.\u201cCould it be that\u2026 Jordan is really the president of the Ace Corporation?\u201dAt this moment, Drew stood out with his cell phone and walked over. \u201cThose who are still doubting the identity of Jordan, my former cousin-in-law, take your phones out now and find out who the president of the Ace Corporation is using the Heaven\u2019s Eye app!\u201dThe Heaven\u2019s Eye app would provide the name and photos of the presidents of various companies. Still, Jordan had been keeping his profile hidden previously so no one could find him.Today, Jordan no longer needed to hide.Tyler and Hailey took out their cell phones at the same time. They started checking the app, only to see that Jordan was indeed the president of Ace Corporation!\u201cNo!\u201d Hailey was so flabbergasted that she dropped her iPhone on the ground!She knew that the information on the Heaven\u2019s Eye app would never be wrong!Zack and Ryan Dunn had indeed kowtowed to the right person too!The truth was clear as day, and Jordan was in fact, the president of Ace Corporation!\u201cGrandma, are you okay?\u201dDrew was highly conceited because he was the only person at the scene beside Victoria who learned of Jordan\u2019s identity before this.However, he suddenly saw Diana passing out while seated on the chair.\u201cMom, how are you feeling? I\u2019ll take you to the hospital!\u201dHerman hurriedly picked Diana up in his arms.Benedict and Sylvie frantically said, \u201cLet us take her to the hospital!\u201dHowever, Herman was holding onto Diana tightly and refusing to let go. At this point, who would dare to face Jordan?All the Camdens wanted to flee!\u201cLet me do it. You guys should stay here since it\u2019s your daughter\u2019s wedding today.\u201dAfter saying that, Herman quickly left like he was fleeing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hence, he chose to leave immediately.After carrying Diana into the backseat of the Audi Q7, Herman said to his chauffeur, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the hospital! Step on it!\u201dAs soon as he said that, Diana suddenly wailed.\u201cAh!\u201dHer outburst gave Herman a considerable fright, and he shuddered.\u201cMom, you\u2019re okay? I was worried sick, and I thought that you had passed out because of that punk Jordan.\u201dHerman was quite relieved.Diana kept hitting her legs in misery.\u201cI\u2019ve let your late father down! I\u2019m so muddled up. I\u2019ve finally understood why your father let Jordan marry into our family as a live-in husband of Hailey. I\u2019m the one who drove him out of the family! Why am I so foolish!?!\u201dAt this juncture, Diana finally understood why her late husband, who had always been intelligent and wise, would pick Jordan as his grandson-in-law.It turned out that Jordan was not a fighter but the president of a major corporation! He was a tycoon!Diana had pretended to pass out just now because she simply did not know how to face Jordan.In the past, the Camdens had done countless things to hurt Jordan, and she couldn\u2019t bring herself to see Jordan at all!Diana asked, \u201cDrew seems to have found out about Jordan\u2019s identity a while ago. Why didn\u2019t that brat inform us in advance!?!\u201dThe embarrassment showed on Herman\u2019s face as he said, \u201cWell, Drew has been telling me about Jordan\u2019s power lately, warning me not to offend him, but I decided not to listen to him.\u201dDiana sighed with misery. \u201cWe\u2019ve missed it! The Camdens have missed such a great opportunity! Hailey didn\u2019t get pregnant with Jordan\u2019s child in those three years of their marriage! The president of Ace Corporation, whom my poor granddaughter Elle has been longing for, turns out to be Jordan! Our plan to change the fate of our family for the better by relying on Elle\u2019s husband-to-be has fallen through!\u201d\u2026Outside the hotel.Elle was still in shock and couldn\u2019t calm down for a long time after learning that the \u201cMr. Steele,\u201d who had been the man of her dreams since forever, was actually the Jordan she knew.She took the initiative to walk towards Jordan and asked, \u201cJordan, you\u2019re the president of Ace Corporation?\u201dJordan looked at the astonishment on Elle\u2019s face and said with a smile, \u201cYes.\u201dElle said with a look of devotion, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that the person I\u2019m in love with has actually appeared in my life long ago and has been silently staying by my side to protect me for three years\u2026\u201dJordan was speechless.\u2018Isn\u2019t creating TikTok videos the only thing Elle is good at? Since when has she become so poetic?\u2019Jordan said awkwardly, \u201cIn the past, I was your cousin-in-law. When did I become your most beloved person?\u201dElle quickly denied, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not! Haven\u2019t you heard my father mention this before? Grandpa initially arranged for you to marry me! God, why are you playing tricks on us like this? You held us up for three years. For the past three years, we\u2019ve seen each other every day, but little did we know\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay, enough, stop it. We\u2019ll talk about us later.\u201dWhile Elle was all dramatic with her monologue, she had already reached her hand out towards Jordan.Jordan didn\u2019t want to have much to do with Elle for the time being, and she wasn\u2019t the main character of his plan today.In the past, Elle may have mocked and humiliated Jordan all the time but what she had done was nothing compared to what Hailey did.While Elle was confessing her love to Jordan, Leonard and Rosie learned about the story behind this matter from Jordan.\u201cOh dear, since Jordan Steele is Hailey\u2019s former husband, do you think he\u2019s here to crash the wedding?\u201dLeonard whispered to Rosie.Rosie was much more worried than Leonard. It wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal if he was just going to crash the wedding and take the bride away, as they would at most just suffer some embarrassment.What Rosie was most worried about was that Jordan might exact revenge on Tyler for snatching his wife away from him. After all, in the eyes of many, that was enough reason to kill!Rosie walked forward and said with a respectful gaze, \u201cMr. Steele, may I ask if you\u2019re here for Hailey?\u201dIf Jordan said yes, Rosie would not hesitate to ask Tyler to hand Hailey over to Jordan.The president of the Ace Corporation was definitely not someone Tyler could afford to offend.Hailey was also stunned, and she rubbed her hands together continuously while feeling extremely excited.\u2018He\u2019s here. He\u2019s come on a white horse to marry me! My Prince Charming, my mighty hero, my beloved husband is here to take me away!\u201dKnowing that Jordan was deeply in love with her, Hailey thought he had come to stop her from getting married so that he could take her away!However\u2026Jordan said indifferently, \u201cMiss Hailey Camden is indeed my former wife, but I no longer have anything to do with her now. I didn\u2019t intend to attend the wedding today. Still, Mr. Tyler Collins sent me an invitation and insisted that I come so that I can witness with my own eyes what a grand and top-notch wedding is all about. He also said that I\u2019m not a man if I choose not to turn up.\u201d\u201cSo, I came together with Victoria.\u201dJordan\u2019s words made Hailey\u2019s heart sink.\u2018He\u2019s not here to take me away!\u2019At this moment, Rosie slapped Tyler on his face.Smack!The loud sound of the slap was clear evidence of how hard Rosie had slapped Tyler. She didn\u2019t go easy on her son at all.\u201cIs that what you should say to a guest you\u2019re inviting to your wedding? Hurry up and apologize to Mr. Steele!\u201dRosie yelled at Tyler.Tyler was dumbfounded, and he finally figured out why the companies he had invested in lately had been winding up.It turned out that Jordan was targeting him!\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201dTyler didn\u2019t dare to disobey his mother.Jordan smiled without saying anything.Seeing that Jordan wasn\u2019t intending to stop Hailey from marrying Tyler, Leonard hurriedly said, \u201cMr. Steele, please come in. After you take your seat, I\u2019ll make my son apologize to you again in front of everyone else.\u201dJordan put his hands in his pockets. Since he had already arrived, he would, of course, attend the wedding.Leonard arranged for Jordan to take the master\u2019s seat, after which he instructed the servants to pour three glasses of wine.Holding a glass of wine in hand, Leonard said, \u201cI heard that Tyler has offended you previously. As his father, I should have taken him in hand, but I failed to discipline him well, so I shall punish myself for that. Here are three toasts to you as an apology, Mr. Steele!\u201dLeonard chugged three glasses of wine in a row. As the host of the wedding, he was stooping low and had given Jordan enough respect.Jordan smiled. Businessmen, especially those engaged in large businesses, would usually know when to yield and when not, unlike those of lower statuses who would still fight stubbornly even when on the verge of death.Jordan had long expected that the Collins would subdue themselves once he revealed his identity.Hence, he had already implemented the plan to retaliate against the Collins a long time ago. The feud could not be resolved with a simple apology and a few toasts from Leonard!Leonard toasted thrice in a row while Jordan, who was considered his junior, remained seated and watched him do so.At this moment, Leonard said to Tyler, \u201cHurry up and pour some wine to apologize to Mr. Steele.\u201dTyler looked highly embarrassed, and he remained still with his fists clenched, feeling frustrated and vexed.

It\u2019s not surprising that she\u2019d be willing to help him!\u201d\u201cAs for the information in the Heaven\u2019s Eye app, Victoria Clarke could have submitted Jordan\u2019s information or even hacked into the database.\u201d\u201cMr. Walton also seems to be a little different from what he looked like on TV, and his height seems different too. He could be an impostor!\u201d\u201cMeanwhile, Ryan Dunn and Zack Smith have already lost their businesses and become penniless. Jordan is so good at fighting that he might have threatened them and forced them to stage this act. That\u2019s very likely to be the case!\u201dAfter analyzing the information about Jordan that they currently had, Tyler smiled smugly.\u201cHahaha, Jordan Steele, you\u2019re deceiving us, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re not the president of Ace Corporation at all. You\u2019re just a bodyguard! Why? Are you trying to make Hailey regret?\u201dEveryone was shocked after hearing Tyler\u2019s words.Rosie was incredibly exasperated. \u201cTyler! What nonsense are you spouting!?! Didn\u2019t you see how deferential Mr. Walton was to Mr. Steele just now?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not spouting nonsense!\u201d Tyler began to explain, \u201cDon\u2019t you guys think that Mr. Walton\u2019s height and appearance seems different from what we see on TV?\u201dNone of them had ever seen Mr. Walton in person, so they immediately began to suspect something after hearing Tyler\u2019s words.\u201cSpeaking of which, I really didn\u2019t pay attention to Mr. Walton\u2019s appearance just now. I just thought he was Mr. Walton because he seemed to be so.\u201d\u201cI looked at him carefully! His chin doesn\u2019t seem right. Mr. Walton\u2019s chin is not that pointed.\u201d\u201cHis height seems off too. Mr. Walton isn\u2019t that tall, is he? Isn\u2019t he only about 1.65 meters tall? That man just now is at least 1.7 meters tall!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Besides, Mr. Walton is such a busy man. How could he have come to the wedding just to meet someone? He even left in a hurry after making his appearance, and none of the people he came with know us either.\u201dThe crowd began discussing, and they all agreed with Tyler\u2019s theory.Unable to tolerate it any longer, Victoria snapped, \u201cTyler Collins, are you stupid? How can the information on Heaven\u2019s Eye be fabricated?\u201dTyler laughed and said, \u201cMiss Clarke, in order to be convincing, you must have gone all out with your act. It\u2019s just an app. What\u2019s so difficult about modifying the information for a few minutes?\u201dAt this moment, Ryan and Zack, who were still kneeling beside Jordan, spoke up for him.Ryan said, \u201cTyler Collins, you dimwit! How dare you continue doubting Mr. Steele!? The situation I\u2019m in now is what I got for choosing not to believe that Jordan is Mr. Steele at first! If you continue to be so stubborn and muddled up, you\u2019ll die without knowing why!\u201dZack chimed in, \u201cTyler, you don\u2019t seem to be a fool, and I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re aware how far-fetched your explanation is, right? Anyway, you\u2019re dead for hooking up with Mr. Steele\u2019s wife. Is that why you have the guts to continue slandering Mr. Steele?\u201dZack\u2019s words made Tyler break out in cold sweat. Since Zack and Tyler used to spend a lot of time together, Zack could see right through his mind!\u201cSecurity! Drag these two dogs who are kneeling on the ground out of here! You good-for-nothings, don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know that Jordan Steele has paid you to do this!\u201dTyler yelled, and soon, two burly men came over to carry Zack and Smith away.At this moment, Hailey was also overwhelmed with anxiety and on the verge of tears due to Jordan\u2019s treatment of her over the past three years.Suppose Jordan was the corporation president and came from an extremely wealthy family. Why would he stoop so low and suck up to her?Hailey said, \u201cJordan, are you pretending or not? I\u2019m begging you, please cut it out. This is not the time and place for jokes!\u201dHailey desperately wanted Jordan to tell her the answer.However, Jordan refused to give in, and he didn\u2019t waver at all.Instead, he said calmly, \u201cYou can\u2019t convince those who refuse to come to terms with the truth. If it makes you feel better, you can take it that I\u2019m pretending.\u201dJordan had already said twice that he was the president. Since they refused to believe him, they could take it that he wasn\u2019t.\u2018Why bother explaining to such fools?\u2019Since Jordan had just \u201cadmitted\u201d that he was pretending, his former mother-in-law, Sylvie, heaved a sigh of relief.She walked over and said, \u201cYou rascal, you scared the hell out of me! I thought you had really made it, but it turns out that you were pretending! You\u2026\u201dBefore Sylvie could finish, Benedict pulled her away and chided her softly.\u201cAre you trying to get into more trouble!?! You must be tired of living!\u201dSylvie whispered, \u201cIsn\u2019t he pretending?\u201dBenedict shook his head and barked furiously, \u201cYou dimwit! If you want to get into trouble, don\u2019t implicate the Camdens! If you dare to provoke Jordan again, I will divorce you immediately, and you can go live with your beloved starlet!\u201dSylvie\u2019s face immediately became flushed.Benedict could already tell that Jordan was indeed the president of Ace Corporation.The only reason was because of Drew\u2019s attitude towards Jordan!Leonard was now in a dilemma, and he couldn\u2019t verify Jordan\u2019s identity.Leonard said, \u201cEveryone, please take a seat and have some drinks. The wedding will begin shortly.\u201dRosie said, \u201cMr. Steele is our son\u2019s friend, and they\u2019re just playing with each other. Please take your seats.\u201dAfter hearing the hosts\u2019 words, everyone returned to their seats.However, they were still staring at Jordan.Jordan and Victoria sat at a separate table. After taking a sip of water, Victoria said, \u201cHow dare this bunch of idiots still doubt your identity?\u201dJordan, too, took a sip of water and said, \u201cApart from Hailey Camden and Sylvie Parker, I reckon the Collins and Camdens have all believed that I\u2019m the president of Ace Corporation.\u201d\u201cBut the rest\u2026\u201dAs they spoke, another distinguished guest arrived in the hall.When Leonard saw him, he immediately walked over in surprise.\u201cAren\u2019t you Mr. Wills, the president of the renowned Electron Co.?\u201dThe e-commerce industry has been booming in recent years. The country\u2019s leading e-commerce giant, Amazon, surpassed $4.8 billion in worldwide sales from Black Friday through Cyber Monday last year.Although Electron could not compare to Amazon, it still held a significant position in the local e-commerce.Dustin Wills was also a billionaire!With a gift in hand, Dustin walked over and shook Leonard\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ve only met you once in DC, Mr. Collins. Yet, you still remember me.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that. Mr. Wills, it\u2019s a great honor for us that you\u2019ve come to attend my son\u2019s wedding. You even brought a gift!\u201d Leonard laughed as he said.Dustin said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the gift is not for your son.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mr. Wills, aren\u2019t you here to attend my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Leonard asked, looking a little embarrassed.Dustin smiled and said, \u201cOf course I\u2019m here for the wedding, I\u2019ve prepared a monetary gift for your son, and I\u2019ve already given it to the reception staff.\u201d Mr. Collins, if you don\u2019t believe me, you may check with them.\u201dLeonard hurriedly said, \u201cMr. Wills, you must be joking. Why would I be fixated on the gift? It\u2019s a great honor for me that you\u2019re willing to attend the wedding. You\u2019ve even brought a gift. You\u2019re too formal, Mr. Wills!\u201dLeonard knew that Dustin was very affluent and would give at least 15,000 dollars as a gift.Hence, Leonard hurriedly called Tyler and Hailey to come over. \u201cTyler, Hailey, come here and meet Mr. Wills.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Mr. Wills. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you. You\u2019re my idol!\u201dTyler walked over and gave Dustin a handshake with both hands as he continuously tried to suck up to him.Although the Collins were a powerful family, they were still a notch below those tycoons who would be included in the list of wealthiest families in the country each year.\u201cOh, hello,\u201d Dustin said somewhat perfunctorily with indifference.Hailey was overjoyed, too, because she didn\u2019t expect the Collins to have connections with such a wealthy man. Thus, she bowed to him and shook his hand with both hands too.\u201cHello, Mr. Wills, I\u2019m Hailey Camden. I\u2019m so glad to meet you. I hope to have the opportunity to learn from you.\u201dDustin glanced at Hailey and was a little surprised by how beautiful she was. Still, he simply nodded without saying anything further.The eagle-eyed Tyler immediately noticed the gift box in Dustin\u2019s hand and said, \u201cMr. Wills, is that a box of cigars you\u2019re holding?\u201dSurprised to hear his answer, Dustin said, \u201cWow, Mr. Collins, you\u2019ve got great eyesight. This is indeed a box of cigars.\u201dTyler was curious to know what brand of cigar a bigwig like Dustin would give as a gift. Hence, he asked, \u201cWhat brand of cigar is that, Mr. Wills?\u201dDustin said, \u201cIt seems to be a brand called Gurkha, but I\u2019m not sure either because my subordinate was the one who prepared it. Haha, pardon me.\u201dTyler and Hailey were both shocked. \u201cGurkha Royal Courtesan Cigar? That\u2019s the most expensive brand of cigar that costs $1.4 million a stick!\u201dThe guests were just as taken aback by the staggering price of the cigar.That was enough money to buy a load of cigars from other less expensive brands!Dustin laughed and said, \u201cIt costs a little less than that, but you\u2019re close. Haha. Mr. Collins and the newlyweds, please excuse me.\u201dDustin walked towards the table where Jordan and Victoria were seated, with the cigar box in hand.\u201cHello, Mr. Steele, Miss Clarke.\u201dDustin walked over and handed the cigar box to Jordan as he exclaimed, \u201cHappy birthday, Mr. Steele!\u201dEveryone was stunned to see Dustin give that million-dollar cigar to Jordan!Dustin had at most given the newlyweds a gift of 20 to 30 grand. Yet, he gave Jordan such an exorbitant gift that cost far beyond tens of grands!That just goes to show that Dustin wasn\u2019t really there for the wedding but for Jordan!Jordan took the box, got up, and gave Dustin a handshake. He said with a smile, \u201cMr. Wills, you\u2019re too kind. We\u2019re already business partners. You didn\u2019t have to go through such an expense.\u201dAce Corporation was now cooperating with Electron E-commerce, and it wasn\u2019t Jordan\u2019s first meeting with Dustin.Watching Jordan and Dustin laughing and chatting with each other, Tyler felt like he had been slapped hard on the face.The fact that Dustin would be so polite to Jordan, let alone give him such an expensive gift, would make no sense if Jordan was pretending to be the president of Ace Corporation.Hailey was stunned too. \u201cHow is that possible\u2026\u201d\u201cMr. Collins! Mr. Collins!\u201dAt this moment, a middle-aged man who exuded an artistic aura called out to Leonard as he made his way over.Everyone was stunned after taking a closer look at him.\u2018Isn\u2019t that the internationally renowned pianist, Evan Cadence?\u2019\u201cHey, Mr. Cadence! When did you arrive?\u201dLeonard was just as surprised. Evan Cadence was an internationally renowned pianist who, although, wasn\u2019t among the top three in the world, belonged to the elite class of pianists in the world. He had attended various significant events like the Grammy awards and many others.Leonard and Evan Cadence had met on several occasions previously, and they were no strangers to each other. Leonard had even tried to ask Evan to teach his children to play the piano.Evan smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m here to give you a gift.\u201d\u201cA gift? There\u2019s no need for that! I was going to invite you to play a wedding march for my son and daughter-in-law! We ought to be the ones paying you, not the other way around,\u201d Leonard said with a smile.Leonard then said to Tyler and Hailey, \u201cThis is Mr. Evan Cadence, a renowned world-class pianist. Hailey, I heard that you\u2019ve learned piano since you were a child. In that case, you should have heard of such an elite pianist like Evan, right?\u201dHailey was full of awe and admiration for Evan. She had been learning to play the piano since she was a child. Although she wasn\u2019t a professional, she was at least aware of how impressive Evan was!Incredibly excited, Hailey exclaimed, \u201cMr. Cadence, I\u2019m so happy to meet you. It would really be an honor to hear you play a piece live!\u201dEvan waved his hand and refuted, \u201cYou flatter me. Has the wedding begun yet? If it hasn\u2019t, can I play a little tune?\u201dTyler hurriedly said, \u201cYes, yes! Some of the guests we invited have yet to arrive, and the wedding hasn\u2019t begun yet. It would be great if you could play a song for the audio pleasure of our guests!\u201d\u201cAlright then, please excuse me.\u201dAfter saying that, Evan actually walked towards Jordan\u2019s table too.To everyone\u2019s surprise, Evan exclaimed to Jordan, \u201cJordan, my senior!\u201d\u201cEvan, what are you doing here?\u201d Jordan asked as he shook Evan\u2019s hand.Everyone was flabbergasted!The internationally renowned pianist, Evan Cadence, actually said that Jordan was his senior!The baffling thing was that Evan was clearly much older than Jordan. Yet, he said that Jordan was his senior.Hailey\u2019s jaw dropped in surprise.Even Dustin, who was at the same table, was confused. He joked, \u201cEvan, you\u2019re so much older. Why did you call Jordan your senior? Don\u2019t pretend to be younger than your age.\u201dEvan had also met Dustin before, so he chuckled and said, \u201cMr. Wills, you have no idea. I was admitted to a music academy in June 1997. I must have been 15 years old at that time, and I was taught by Gary Graffman.\u201d\u201cJordan, I mean, Mr. Steele, became Mr. Graffman\u2019s student in January 1997. I joined five months later, so that makes him my senior!\u201dJordan laughed and said, \u201cI must have been less than two years old at that time. I can\u2019t even remember, haha.\u201dEveryone, especially Hailey, was shocked.\u2018Jordan started learning the piano from a famous classical pianist at the age of two?\u2019Geniuses like Evan Cadence were few and far between. Yet, he only became Gary Graffman\u2019s student at the age of fifteen by virtue of his exemplary results.\u2018How rich must Jordan\u2019s family be?\u2019\u2018He became the student of a famous pianist soon after he was born?\u2019Hailey couldn\u2019t help but swallow her saliva as she recalled Jordan\u2019s piano performance during the superstar\u2019s concert some time ago.\u201cI thought he started learning piano only in the past three years with the allowance I gave him. It turns out that he had started learning the piano since the age of two, from an internationally renowned teacher!\u201dThe sense of superiority over Jordan that Hailey used to have all along vanished immediately!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Abandoned Husband DominatesCH 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe sense of superiority Hailey felt as a result of her family\u2019s affluence was the reason that she was able to hold her head high, justify her wrongdoings before Jordan, and even make him apologize to her previously.Hailey grew up attending aristocratic schools and had learned to play the piano, violin, and dance when she was a child. She felt that she was much more cultured and had a better upbringing than Jordan.Although she adored Jordan, she had always felt that Jordan belonged to a different world from her.Now, Hailey finally realized that they indeed belonged to two different worlds.However, unlike what she had thought before, Jordan belonged to a world that was better than hers!On the other hand, Dustin said to Evan, \u201cEvan, how much did the Collins pay to hire you? Haven\u2019t you always refrained from playing at weddings? When I asked you to play at the wedding of my friend\u2019s son the other time, you turned me down immediately. Is it because you think I can\u2019t afford it?\u201dThe wealthy usually liked hiring famous singers, actors, or pianists to perform at their weddings to show how powerful they were.Evan said, \u201cNah, you\u2019ve misunderstood me, Mr. Wills. I\u2019m not here to perform for the Collins. In fact, my piano teacher, Gary, called me to say that it\u2019s Jordan\u2019s birthday today, so he asked me to come over specifically to perform a piece for him.\u201dJordan said somewhat politely, \u201cMr. Graffman shouldn\u2019t have asked you to come all the way here when he knows how busy you are with the preparation for your performance at the White House next week.\u201dEvan laughed and said, \u201cHaha, it\u2019s okay. I haven\u2019t seen you for so many years. I missed you! By the way, Jordan, what song do you want to listen to?\u201dAfter thinking about it, Jordan said, \u201cLa Campanella.\u201dAs soon as he said that, many people got extremely excited, especially one of the ladies present who must have learned how to play the piano. She screamed and exclaimed, \u201cLa Campanella is one of the world\u2019s top ten most difficult songs to play on the piano!\u201dAlmost everyone in the upper-class circle, including children, would be able to play classics like \u2018Canon\u2019 and \u2018A Comme Camour\u2019.However, La Campanella was a complicated piece that not just anyone can play or have the honor of hearing!Evan said, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll play that one!\u201dIt just so happened that there was a piano on the stage that had just been tuned. Evan tested it and found it to be satisfactory.He said into the microphone, \u201cI\u2019m going to play a song named La Campanella as a gift for my senior, Jordan Steele\u2019s 25th birthday!\u201dThe sound of applause filled the air.As Evan began to play the piano, everyone began to dance as soon as he played the first note in the high range.Jordan could also play that song, and even piano players of Hailey\u2019s caliber have tried it.However, the standards of different piano players varied. The guests present who could play the piano were all aware of the massive difference between themselves and Evan.The playing of this piece required a large variety of complex techniques, such as large leaps, tremolo, 4-5 trills, fast octaves, and so on.Everyone present who claimed that they could play La Campanella, would never say they could play it again in their lifetime after seeing and hearing Evan play it with their very own eyes.\u201cThis is such an enjoyment! I\u2019ll never play this song again! It will be an insult to this piece if I play it!\u201d\u201cThanks to Mr. Steele, I had the opportunity to enjoy the performance of a piano master up close!\u201dThe piece was about four and a half minutes long, and during these four and a half minutes, everyone\u2019s heart was racing as they listened to the tune that made tears well up in their eyes!Finally, Evan played the last note of the piece.Many people who learned music already started to clap their hands because they knew that the song had ended.However, it wasn\u2019t the end of Evan\u2019s performance.Evan then used the final chord as the beginning of a new song\u2014 \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019.Everyone present began humming and singing along.\u201cHappy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.\u201d\u201cHappy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.\u201dFinally, Evan showed off his impressive piano-playing skills again and ended the performance.\u201cThank you, everyone! Jordan, happy birthday!\u201dEvan wished Jordan once again.All the guests in the room stood up and applauded while many strangers even walked towards Jordan to toast to him.Tyler was dumbfounded.\u2018Isn\u2019t this my wedding? Why did the guest performer play the birthday song for Jordan? Why are the guests wishing Jordan a happy birthday too?\u2019\u2018Isn\u2019t a wedding more important than someone\u2019s birthday?\u2019Besides, Tyler was the one who paid for the venue and the piano!\u2018Why has Jordan Steele stolen the limelight?\u2019Feeling extremely humiliated, Tyler walked towards Evan and said, \u201cMaster Cadence, could you please play another song, Mariage d\u2019amour, for Hailey and me?\u201dEvan looked at his watch and said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m really sorry, I\u2019m running late for my flight, and I really have to get going. I\u2019ll definitely make it up to you another day.\u201dAfter saying that, Evan hugged Jordan and left in a hurry.\u201cHello.\u201dTyler and Leonard couldn\u2019t make Evan stay regardless of how he tried.With a look of embarrassment, Tyler thought, \u2018Evan Cadence is obviously here for Jordan Steele\u2019s sake, not for the Collins!\u2019Victoria sipped on some coffee proudly. She had waited for a long time for this day for Jordan to take revenge on Tyler and Hailey.Moreover, it was only the beginning!Less than a minute after Evan left, a young man suddenly walked in and said to Leonard, \u201cMr. Collins, there are suddenly dozens of people at the entrance of the hall. They don\u2019t have any invitations, but they insist on coming in.\u201dLeonard humphed coldly and said, \u201cThe wedding held by the Collins is not something that any Tom, Dick, or Harry can attend. All my guests are dignified figures of Orlando. Tell those people to get lost!\u201dThe young man said, \u201cMr. Collins, they all claim to be bosses of large companies. They even said that they\u2019re willing to give $1500 each as a wedding gift, in exchange for a chance to attend the wedding.\u201dHearing the young man\u2019s words, Leonard was immediately surprised.When the other guests heard it, they began praising him too.\u201cMr. Collins is indeed worthy of being a powerful figure of Orlando. So many company owners are all interested in befriending you at your son\u2019s wedding today.\u201d\u201cIt might be true that they have small businesses, but having so many people requesting to attend your son\u2019s wedding is not easyLeonard heard the compliments and said loudly, \u201cSince so many young owners of small companies want to befriend me and this is also my son\u2019s big day, I will make an exception and share the joy with them!\u201dAfterward, Leonard said to the young man, \u201cLet them come in. Inform the hotel staff to add more tables.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The young man quickly scurried away.Feeling extremely dignified and proud, Tyler bragged to Hailey, \u201cDid you see that? That\u2019s how high my father\u2019s status is in the business industry of Orlando! The owners of those small companies are all trying to butter him up so badly!\u201dHailey smiled stiffly. Now, all she could think about was Jordan.However, she was still delighted to see that her father-in-law had such a high status.However, what happened next made her dumbfounded again!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What kind of companies do you own? Tell me about it!\u201d\u201cEnigma Co. is the name of my company!\u201d\u201cMine\u2019s called Sky Domain Online Games!\u201d\u201cThe name of my company is TriLife Health Technology Co.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone stated the names of their companies.However, Tyler\u2019s face suddenly turned pale after he heard the name of those companies.Reason being he knew of all those companies and had even invested in them!Tyler began to get extremely agitated. \u201cYour companies are the lousy ones that had all folded and caused me to incur major losses!\u201dTyler had invested in hundreds of companies recently but prior to his investment, he didn\u2019t bother meeting the owner of each company and instead sent his subordinate to do so after deciding on which ones to invest in.Hence, he did not personally know all of them.Seeing this, Leonard quickly asked, \u201cTyler, did you invest your money in their companies that ended up closing down? Tell me quickly, how much of those 75 million dollars that I gave you, are left now?!\u201dLeonard began to get nervous.Tyler didn\u2019t dare to lie and thus said in a low voice, \u201cI lost everything.\u201dSmack!Leonard slapped Tyler on his face and he hollered angrily, \u201cYou wastrel! You lost 75 million dollars just like that!\u201dEven Hailey couldn\u2019t believe it. It seemed like yesterday when Tyler said his father had given him 75 million dollars. Tyler even swore that he would make 750 million dollars for Hailey.However, not a single cent was left now!Tyler covered his face and pointed at Jordan while saying sobbingly, \u201cDad, Jordan Steele, that bastard is targeting me!\u201dAs soon as Tyler pointed at Jordan, the dozens of people immediately scurried towards Jordan.Due to the large number of people who were dashing forward eagerly while Leonard, Tyler and Hailey were blocking the day, the three of them began stumbling.\u201cHey, why are you guys running around!?\u201dLeonard rebuked furiously after getting bumped into.Hailey also kept screaming incessantly.However, those dozens of people didn\u2019t care at all because they weren\u2019t there for the Collins anyway.Upon reaching Jordan, they stood two meters away from him before getting on their knees!\u201cMr. Steele! Please spare us!\u201d\u201cMr. Steele! Please spare us!\u201dThe dozens of company owners began kneeling down in front of Jordan and begged him for mercy. The scene was so spectacular that all the businessmen were frightened.\u201cIt turns out these people are not here because of their admiration for Mr. Collins but for Mr. Steele!\u201d\u201cMr. Steele is really impressive. He managed to destroy so many companies with his own power. He\u2019s so scary!\u201d\u201cJordan Steele must be the best businessman in Orlando!\u201dJordan sipped on some coffee and said slowly, \u201cAs long as the Collins stop investing money in your company, I\u2019ll stop targeting you.\u201dAfter hearing Jordan\u2019s words, they stood up and turned around to yell at Tyler.\u201cTyler Collins, stop investing money in our companies!\u201d\u201cDamn it, it turns out I\u2019m being targeted because of you! Don\u2019t invest money in my company again!\u201d\u201cTyler Collins, you have to compensate for my losses!\u201dDozens of people began hollering at Tyler.Leonard flew into a rage and barked, \u201cChase these people out immediately!\u201dThe Collins had long known that Hailey\u2019s ex-husband was good at fighting so they had arranged for many powerful experts to be on standby.However, those people were still indignant.\u201cWe\u2019ve each given a gift of $1,500 to come in. Who are you to tell us to leave!?!\u201d\u201cLeonard Collins, you\u2019re so shameless. You\u2019re making us leave right after we entered, are you trying to take our money without giving anything in return?\u201dLeonard felt extremely embarrassed after hearing that. \u2018Why would the Collins care for such a small sum of money!?!\u2019Leonard said, \u201cReturn each of them twice of what they have given!\u201dIn a fit of anger, Tyler decided that he would rather waste tens of thousands of dollars than let the Collins be humiliated.After they left, Tyler stormed towards Jordan angrily and hollered, \u201cMr. Steele, I don\u2019t know how Tyler has offended you to suffer such treatment from you! You made my son lose 75 million dollars but I\u2019m afraid you must have lost more than that!\u201dLeonard knew very well that it definitely took a large sum of money to make a company shut down in a short period of time, unless Jordan resorted to some despicable means.Jordan didn\u2019t plan to make peace with the Collins in the first place.Although Leonard had already lost his temper, it didn\u2019t matter to Jordan either!Jordan said, \u201cGo find out from your son what he has done. I don\u2019t need you to feel the pinch for the money I\u2019ve spent. Hundreds of millions mean nothing to me.\u201dHearing the last sentence, Hailey felt as if she had slipped into a dream.\u2018Hundreds of millions mean nothing to him?\u2019\u2018I betrayed Jordan precisely for the sake of money!\u2019Leonard had already guessed that this matter must have something to do with Hailey.However, since Tyler had already married Hailey, he had to protect the both of them.Leonard said, \u201cMr. Steele, you\u2019re really rich, the Collins are indeed no match for you! However, the Collins have been running a business in Orlando for decades and we have a strong foothold here. I heard that you just came to Orlando in recent years, Mr. Steele.\u201d\u201cI have made a lot of friends in Orlando over the past few decades, including some triad bosses. If they find out that someone had the guts to target my son, they definitely won\u2019t let you off! They might even do something that goes against the rules!\u201dLeonard was threatening Jordan!\u201cLeonard Collins, how dare you threaten Mr. Steele!?!\u201d Victoria flew into a rage too.Jordan extended his hand to gesture for Victoria to calm down. He remained composed and said, \u201cMr. Steele, I\u2019m more than eager to be taught a lesson by you. May I know who the triad boss you\u2019re referring to is?\u201d\u201cHmph, you\u2019ll meet him soon.\u201dLeonard then took out his cell phone and made a call. \u201cMr. Dalton, are you here yet?\u201dThe person on the other end of the call answered, \u201cI arrived a long time ago, I\u2019m at the entrance!\u201dLeonard hurriedly said, \u201cHuh? Why didn\u2019t you come in? I\u2019ll go outside and get you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He would never wait for anyone. Hence, Leonard wondered who could make Pablo wait.In less than two minutes, a Rolls-Royce was driven over.Leonard could tell from the license plate that the owner of the car was a formidable person!The status of the upper-class circle figures could usually be determined from the license plates of their cars.The wealthy and powerful usually had personalized or exotic license plates that cost plenty of money.Generally, exotic license plates could only be owned by people of certain status.After looking at the license plate, Leonard immediately knew that there was an influential figure in the car!Pablo took the initiative to run to the rear door to open the door, after which he bowed respectfully and said, \u201cMr. Reyes, you\u2019re here.\u201dSalvatore bent 90 degrees forward and exclaimed, \u201cGreetings, Mr. Reyes!\u201dButler Frank came out of the car. As soon as Leonard saw the majestic and dignified man, he knew he was an esteemed figure. He hurriedly pulled Leonard and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s this old man?\u201dPablo introduced, \u201cThis is Mr. Reyes, my benefactor. Without him, I won\u2019t be here today.\u201dHearing this, Leonard also hurriedly extended his hand and said, \u201cMr. Reyes, nice to meet you. I\u2019ve been close friends with Mr. Dalton for years, and it\u2019s my son\u2019s big day today. What brings you here\u2026\u201dButler Frank chuckled and said, \u201cHello, Mr. Collins, I\u2019m here to attend the wedding, but please pardon me for showing up uninvited.\u201dLeonard was flattered and taken aback. \u201cNot at all! It\u2019s an honor for my family to have you here. Please come in!\u201dLeonard was overwhelmed with joy, and he was extremely smug. \u2018Haha, Jordan Steele, so what if you\u2019re rich? Even Pablo Dalton and Salvatore are here to support me. I don\u2019t believe you\u2019d dare to go against me!\u2019After the three of them entered the hall, Leonard walked in front and said to Jordan, \u201cJordan, let me introduce you to a few of my friends. This is\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish, Salvatore darted towards Jordan and knelt down in front of him. \u201cMr. Steele! Happy Birthday!\u201dPreviously, Salvatore had also offended Jordan and would have probably been dead by now if Jordan hadn\u2019t been kind enough to spare him.Pablo also stepped forward and respectfully bowed to Jordan while handing him a gift. \u201cHappy birthday, Mr. Jordan. Mr. Reyes and I have come to send you a birthday gift.\u201dButler Frank walked forward slowly. Leonard and the other guests could all tell that Butler Frank had an extraordinary aura and extremely powerful figure.To his surprise, when Butler Frank faced Jordan, he also bowed with great respect. \u201cMr. Jordan, happy birthday.\u201d\u201cMr\u2026 Mr. Jordan?\u201dLeonard, Hailey, and the others were all flabbergasted.Jordan also hurriedly got up to shake Butler Frank\u2019s hand. \u201cButler Frank, you don\u2019t have to bow to me. I treat you like family.\u201dAfter saying that, Jordan looked at Leonard and asked, \u201cWere you referring to Pablo and Salvatore when you mentioned that you know a few triad bosses?\u201dEven Leonard had to address Pablo and Salvatore with great respect. Yet, Jordan seemed to be treating them as servants!After hearing this, Salvatore flew into a rage. \u201cDamn it, you were trying to go against Mr. Jordan? Are your brains fried?\u201dLeonard didn\u2019t dare to retort after being reprimanded in public by Salvatore!Seeing this, Jordan said, \u201cI\u2019m here to attend a wedding, not to cause trouble. I don\u2019t want others to get the wrong idea. Salvatore, Pablo, take your leave. Butler Frank, I\u2019ll accept your gift. Please get going too.\u201dThe three of them didn\u2019t dare to disobey Jordan.Pablo whispered to Leonard before leaving, \u201cIf Mr. Jordan is harmed in any way during the wedding, I will make sure you and your entire family gets buried together!\u201dLeonard broke out in cold sweat out of nervousness, but he didn\u2019t dare to issue a threat or say anything harsh.The guests at the scene, too, were all stunned.\u201cMr. Steele really has connections in the business industry and the triads! Even Pablo Dalton is his underling!\u201d\u201cMr. Steele is so young and already so powerful. Whoever provokes him will definitely be in for a hard time!\u201dThose people were all mercenary snobs who eagerly tried to suck up to Jordan after realizing how accomplished he was.\u201cI heard that it\u2019s your birthday today, Mr. Steele. This may be our first time meeting each other but fate has brought us together. Come on, let\u2019s all toast to Mr. Steele, okay?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe guests at the venue all shouted in unison.Ironically, many of those guests were relatives of the Collins and Tyler\u2019s best friends.Jordan sneered.He suddenly remembered that many esteemed figures of the upper-class circle had also attended Diana\u2019s 80th birthday banquet not long ago.On that day, Jordan had also gotten into a conflict with the Camdens.However, in the end, the Camdens instigated the guests present on that day to start boycotting Jordan in the future, which they did.However, now that everyone found out that Jordan had done something to harm the Collins, none of them dared to stand up against him for the Collins.On the contrary, they all took the initiative to toast to Jordan in a bid to befriend him.What a pragmatic society!Jordan picked up his cup of tea and said, \u201cThank you all for your birthday wishes. Someone is scared that I might cause trouble after drinking too much, so I shall toast to you guys with water instead of wine.\u201dAfter hearing this, Hailey\u2019s face turned as red as a tomato.When Hailey gave Jordan the wedding invitation earlier on, she had specifically instructed him not to drink too much on the day of the wedding to not embarrass her.However, it seemed that she shouldn\u2019t have to worry about it.After finishing his water, Jordan said to Leonard, \u201cMr. Collins, it\u2019s getting late. Your wedding ought to begin now, shouldn\u2019t it? I have to get back to the office to work after witnessing this top-notch wedding.\u201dLeonard had a complicated expression, but no matter what, he had to finish hosting his son\u2019s wedding before anything else.Hence, Leonard immediately said to the emcee, \u201cLet the wedding begin immediately!\u201dTyler and Hailey walked onto the stage, but Hailey was completely distracted and out of her element.The emcee said, \u201cMr. Tyler Collins, do you take Miss Hailey Camden to be your lawfully wedded wife and love, cherish, and honor her for the rest of your life?\u201dTyler answered, \u201cI do.\u201dThe emcee again asked, \u201cMiss Hailey Camden, do you take Mr. Tyler Collins to be your lawfully wedded husband and take care of him for the rest of your life, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, until death do you part?\u201dHailey exclaimed, \u201cI do not!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Furthermore, he wouldn\u2019t take care of her or pamper her like Jordan did.The only advantage Tyler had was that he came from a wealthy family that could help the Camdens.However, Tyler had now lost his only advantage over Jordan.Hence, Hailey rejected Tyler right on the spot!Clad in a white wedding dress, Hailey scurried down the stage with tears in her eyes and leaped straight into Jordan\u2019s arms before exclaiming, \u201cJordan, I love you!\u201dThe commotion got even louder!\u201cOh my God! The bride actually ran to hug another man at her wedding!\u201d\u201cHaha, now that\u2019s interesting. We\u2019ve got a show to watch.\u201dTyler, who was wearing a suit and standing on the stage, turned pale immediately!Jordan remained seated quietly with complicated emotions within him as Hailey, his former wife, hugged him.He was overjoyed, conceited, resentful, and furious!He recalled the time when he stood in front of Tyler and Hailey in a hotel, dressed in his humble takeout delivery man uniform. At that time, Hailey even self-righteously told him that he didn\u2019t deserve to step into the hotel.The two of them definitely couldn\u2019t have imagined that this would happen today!Victoria, seated beside Jordan, took out a cigarette from her bag and lit it up with a playful smile.\u201cHailey Camden, do you think Jordan will forgive you now that you\u2019ve come scurrying over!?!\u201dVictoria made a sarcastic remark. As a woman, she felt an urge to say to Hailey: \u201cIf you had known that this would happen, you shouldn\u2019t have done it in the first place!\u201dAlthough he was the host, Leonard\u2019s face, hands and legs were all trembling!His daughter-in-law actually had the nerve to tell another man that she loved him at her own wedding!What a huge disgrace!It was a huge disgrace to the Collins!The Collins were thoroughly embarrassed!At this moment, Benedict suddenly came forward. He pulled Hailey out of Jordan\u2019s embrace before giving her a tight slap on her face!Smack!Benedict said anxiously, \u201cYou must be out of your mind! Are you trying to implicate all of us by offending the Collins!?!\u201dBenedict was well aware of how serious of a matter and Hailey had just embarrassed the Collins, making them the laughing stock of Orlando.In addition, the Collins were not to be trifled with either, and they would definitely deal with Benedict and his family.However, Sylvie walked over and hugged Hailey.She hollered at Benedict, \u201cBenedict, why did you lay a hand on Hailey!?! Hailey and Jordan have been married for three years, and they have strong feelings for each other. It\u2019s only right for her to choose Jordan over Tyler. Besides, Jordan is the president of a huge corporation, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 Shut up, you wastrel!\u201dBenedict was livid, and he raised his hand again in a bid to slap Sylvie.Benedict knew that Jordan definitely wouldn\u2019t take Hailey back and that he wasn\u2019t there to stop the marriage either.No matter how much Hailey pleaded, it was to no avail.Since Hailey was now married to Tyler, the only option she had was to spend the rest of her life with him.Otherwise, she would offend both Jordan and the Collins, which would land them in hot soup.Jordan did not say a word to the Camdens.The three of them were his former wife, father-in-law, and mother-in-law, respectively.However, they no longer had anything to do with him now.Jordan got up from his seat, buttoned his suit suavely, and said, \u201cIndeed, it\u2019s such a top-notch wedding, Mr. Collins, it\u2019s no wonder you insisted that I come and witness it with my own eyes.\u201d\u201cNow that I\u2019ve already witnessed it, I\u2019ll get going. I have work to do.\u201dVictoria pinched the slim cigarette that she had just lit up and rose from her seat as well. \u201cI should get going too.\u201dDustin, who was seated at the same table as them, also quickly got up and said, \u201cMr. Steele, Miss Clarke, please wait for me. I\u2019ll leave with you guys.\u201dAfter the three of them left, surprisingly, the remaining guests at the table also walked towards Leonard to bid him goodbye.\u201cMr. Collins, I have some work to do. I\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201d\u201cThe people at the office have called to rush me. I\u2019m sorry, I gotta go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSoon, all of the wedding ballroom tables that were initially very lively were empty except for two tables.The remaining guests at those two tables were relatives of the Collins.Basically, all their business partners had left.They were all intelligent people who knew when to defect to those who were powerful.Knowing that Jordan had a conflict with the Collins, who would dare to be close to the Collins?Suppose they continued to stay there and ended up letting Jordan hear of it. In that case, Jordan might just destroy their companies like what he had done to those dozens of unlucky companies.\u201cAh!\u201dTyler moved a chair over and smashed it against the table.They had spent close to a million dollars on the wedding, but all the guests had left!Seeing this, Leonard remained composed and said, \u201cTyler, take Hailey to your matrimonial home. It\u2019s your big day today, don\u2019t fret over this. Your mother and I will take care of it!\u201dLeonard then said to Hailey, \u201cHailey Camden, I know you want to go back to Jordan Steele now, but as you can see, he doesn\u2019t want you at all. Since you\u2019ve married me, just be content!\u201d\u201cThe Collins may not be as wealthy as Jordan, but we at least have hundreds of millions of dollars in assets, which is still a notch above your family!

How can they still be married?\u201d\u201cBesides, Hailey has married Tyler Collins.\u201dIn a mysterious smile, Lily said, \u201cYour uncle, who is Hailey\u2019s grandfather, had known Jordon\u2019s identity long ago, and therefore allowed him to marry Hailey.\u201d\u201cBesides, he had long guessed that the willful and arrogant Hailey would one day choose to divorce Jordan.\u201d\u201cSo, he has long arranged for the people at the lawyer\u2019s office to tamper with the divorce papers, should there be any. The divorce papers are fake, and so is Hailey\u2019s current marriage certificate with Tyler Collins!\u201dDevon was so astonished that his jaw dropped. \u2018Hailey\u2019s grandfather is so wise that he had actually made all the appropriate arrangements before his death!\u2019Devon said gleefully, \u201cIn this case, I\u2019ll call Hailey immediately and tell her about it!\u201dHowever, Lily put her pale hand on Devon\u2019s arm to stop him.\u201cDon\u2019t tell her for now,\u201d Lily said with a somber expression.\u201cHailey is too arrogant, and she has been belittling Jordan all this while.

Although the roof was open, the windows were closed.\u201cRachel Quinn?\u201dOf course, Rachel wasn\u2019t alone because Hailey was right beside her.Hailey was dressed in a black Chanel dress, still looking as beautiful and elegant as ever.After all, a person\u2019s beauty will not be affected much by their mood or personality.\u201cJordan\u2026\u201d Hailey called out.Although she was wearing an expensive dress, she felt like a beggar standing outside a million-dollar car.Jordan, who was seated in the luxury car, was like a prince from ancient times.Jordan ignored Hailey and instead looked at Rachel.In fact, Jordan had been on relatively good terms with Rachel in the past three years.Among Hailey\u2019s friends, Rachel was the nicest to him.The rest of Hailey\u2019s friends despised Jordan and looked down on him extensively, so much that they would treat him like a servant and boss him around whenever they met.They would make him carry their shopping bags, run errands for them, and buy them food or coffee. Simply put, they treated him like a slave.However, Rachel had never been condescending or mean to Jordan. She had never insulted him and instead even treated him to meals all the time.Perhaps, it was because Rachel favored handsome men, and Jordan happened to fit her aesthetic standards.Rachel bent forward, and her long locks cascaded down, blocking her vision.She ruffled her hair and put it behind her shoulders again before saying, \u201cHaha, Jordan, I thought you didn\u2019t recognize me now that you\u2019ve become the esteemed president of Ace Corporation.\u201dJordan laughed and said, \u201cHow is that possible? I still owe you a few meals.\u201dRachel said, \u201cHaha, Hailey and I are here to ask you for a treat. Can we go to yours and take a look at your luxurious villa?\u201dJordan glanced at Hailey before replying to Rachel.\u201cMiss Quinn, you\u2019re absolutely welcome to visit my home, but Miss Camden, you just got married to Mr. Collins today, and it\u2019s already late at night. You\u2019d better not come to my place lest you create any unnecessary misunderstandings.\u201dRachel hurriedly took out a copy of the signed divorce papers from Hailey\u2019s bag and handed it to Jordan. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a misunderstanding. Hailey and Tyler have gotten divorced!\u201dJordan took a look at the divorce papers before handing them to Rachel while shaking his head without saying anything.Of course, he knew why Hailey had gotten a divorce.He just didn\u2019t expect that she would get divorced on the same day of her wedding.Jordan remained quiet while Rachel leaned against the window of the car and pleaded with him coquettishly.\u201cDear handsome Jordan, just let us go in together. Why? Are you scared that we might violate you?\u201dJordan knew that Rachel had always been bold with her words, and he was never her match when it comes to talking lewdly.Jordan didn\u2019t quite like Rachel because she had a complicated private life full of messy relationships.Hailey used to be a pure and obedient girl at first, but she was gradually led astray by Rachel.However, Jordan also knew that even if he turned Hailey down today, she would continue to pester him in the future.1\u201cGet in the car,\u201d Jordan said.\u201cThank you, Mr. Steele!\u201dRachel took the initiative to get inside the passenger\u2019s seat so that Hailey could sit beside Jordan in the backseat.The front seat was worlds apart from the backseat. The roof in front was sealed, but the starry sky could be seen when one looked up from the backseat!Besides, it was also extremely spacious in the rear, which resembled a first-class seat on the airplane. It was really comfortable!There was a table and a holder for champagne glasses.Hailey was extremely excited as soon as she got into the seat.\u201cThis is my husband\u2019s car! A limited-edition Maybach! I\u2019ve never seen this car before! There\u2019s champagne too!\u201dAfter Hailey sat down, she touched a champagne glass with her left hand and picked it up.She then said to Jordan, \u201cCan you pour me a glass of champagne?\u201d1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jordan led the both of them into the villa.As soon as they entered, both of them were stunned by the luxurious and opulent decor in the villa.Being born to wealthy families, both had been to all sorts of expensive houses and estates. However, the extravagant splendor of Jordan\u2019s luxurious villa was far beyond their imagination and even more spectacular than anything they had ever seen!The majority of ordinary luxury villas would have a gilded and dazzling interior.There would be exaggerated chandeliers, peculiarly designed staircases, and a bunch of exorbitant sculptures, art pieces, or antiques in the living room.However, there weren\u2019t such pompous ornaments in Jordan\u2019s villa. Yet, it couldn\u2019t be any more luxurious.There was no chandelier, no ostentatious TV cabinet, or plaster ceilings.Instead, there were couches, a fireplace, a soft and snuggly carpet, and stylish standing lamps.Rachel and Hailey, both of whom were huge fans of fashion and often kept up with the latest fashion trends, were extremely familiar with designer products launched by luxury brands.\u201cOh my, is this an Arco lamp from the Italian brand FLOS? Why haven\u2019t I seen this one before?\u201d\u201cI love this recliner. I think it\u2019s from Eames.\u201dRachel continuously scrutinized all the furniture and ornaments in the villa. At the same time, Jordan walked towards the refrigerator and asked, \u201cCan I get you guys a drink?\u201dRachel answered, \u201cCoke will do.\u201dHailey said, \u201cI want some honey water.\u201dJordan paused for a moment and shot Hailey a glance before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have honey here, only mineral water.\u201dRachel gently pinched Hailey and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re so pretentious. You\u2019re still thinking of making him make you some honey water!?\u201dHailey pursed her lips. Over the past three years, she had gotten used to Jordan serving her all the time, so she wanted to experience it again.They grabbed the bottled drinks that Jordan tossed over at them. Rachel unscrewed the cap and took a sip of coke.She then said, \u201cJordan, I really like the style and color scheme of your furniture. The colors white, blue, and baby blue remind me of the hotel in Phuket that Hailey and I love staying in the most. Hahaha.\u201dJordan said indifferently, \u201cOh, I had most of the furniture here air-flown over from my villa in Phuket. I decided to stick with these instead of getting new ones because many of them are limited edition pieces that are one of a kind. Besides, it would take a long time for new furniture to be custom-made.\u201d\u201cWhat? Do you have a villa in Phuket? Where in Phuket is it located?\u201dBoth Hailey and Rachel were stunned because they were particularly fond of Phuket and would go there for a vacation once almost every year.Hailey even mentioned countless times before that she would buy a villa there when she had the money to in the future.Jordan thought about it and said, \u201cCape Panwa, it has an area of more than 2,300 square meters.\u201dBoth Rachel and Hailey were dumbfounded.Rachel almost choked on her coke. \u201cOh my God! Hailey and I have stayed in a resort villa in Cape Panwa before, and the rates start from $10,000 a night! We feel the pinch whenever we stay here for a few nights. You\u2026 you actually bought a villa there!\u201dHailey was just as excited. She had been to the villa at Cape Nawa countless times before, and she felt as if she could already enjoy a panoramic view of the Andaman Sea from outside Jordan\u2019s villa!\u201cThe villa in Phuket is my dream house! I don\u2019t care. It belongs to me now. Jordan is mine! I don\u2019t care!\u201dHailey was extremely agitated, and she couldn\u2019t contain herself.Rachel, seeing Hailey was already losing control of her emotions even as they had just entered, quickly said, \u201cUm, let\u2019s go upstairs and take a look.\u201dJordan asked, \u201cDo you want to take the elevator or the stairs?\u201dRachel said, \u201cLet\u2019s take the stairs.\u201dAs soon as they stepped onto the white and spotless stairs, Rachel was intrigued again. \u201cHey, why does the design of the stairs seem so familiar?\u201dJordan couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cRachel, you\u2019ve got such sharp eyesight. The detail, brand, and design of every single piece of my furniture can\u2019t escape your eye.\u201dJordan\u2019s villa was truly exorbitant, but the layman who wasn\u2019t knowledgeable about expensive furniture and decor wouldn\u2019t be able to see the value of it.Rachel was indeed a wealthy woman who had seen plenty of this world.Jordan said, \u201cIt\u2019s inspired by the design of the stairs in the Tony Stark mansion in the Marvel movie Iron Man.\u201dRachel immediately smiled and said, \u201cHaha, I was wondering why it looked so familiar. It turns out you recreated the mansion of a billionaire in the Marvel universe in real life! Impressive!\u201dHailey liked watching Marvel movies and Tony Stark too. Hence, she got extremely excited again after she heard that.\u201cIf Jordan and I hadn\u2019t gotten a divorce, this house would be mine\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We want to see the room that you\u2019re staying in.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s on the third floor. Come with me.\u201dJordan walked ahead and brought the two of them to his bedroom.The door of the room was simple, clean, and heavy. After Jordan pushed it open, the three of them felt a sense of chilliness.It was because the windows were open, and the cool night breeze was blowing in, making them feel chilly.After switching on the lights with the touch-screen panel, Rachel and Hailey saw the interior of Jordan\u2019s bedroom.It was spick and span, tidy and organized. It is simple and elegant, without unnecessary ornaments.The bed and table lamp were both white in color.There was also almost no decoration except for a poem that was hung on the light-colored wallpapered wall.Rachel couldn\u2019t help but walk over and read it.\u201cIn fact, what I look forward to is just a single moment.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never expected you to give me your entire life.\u201d\u201cIf I could meet you on a hillside full of gardenias\u2026\u201d\u201cIf we can love each other deeply just once before parting\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, life is only but\u2026\u201d\u201cRegardless of how long it is\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen I look back\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only but a fleeting moment.\u201dAfter Rachel recited it without any emotion, Hailey suddenly said, \u201cI\u2019ve read that poem before.\u201dIt was a modern poem that was popular and also Jordan\u2019s favorite.Hailey liked it very much too. Looking at the soulful fonts, she couldn\u2019t help but reach out to touch the delicate wallpaper.However, as soon as her hand touched the paper, the music suddenly started playing.Dun-dun-dun\u2026\u201cThe music is so familiar. It\u2019s the theme song of Gossip Girl!\u201dHailey was surprised too. Gossip Girl was the first television drama that she and Jordan watched together in the first year of their marriage.Rachel was also surprised that the music started playing as soon as Hailey touched the wallpaper.\u201cIs it from a musical box?\u201d Rachel asked.Jordan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s one of the tones in NEXUS.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s NEXUS?\u201dRachel was confused. There was finally something that she hadn\u2019t heard before either.Hailey had more knowledge in the field of music, so she explained, \u201cIt\u2019s an electronic music synthesizer.\u201dAfterward, Hailey looked at Jordan and said, \u201cI really like this tune. Can you send me the preset of it?\u201dJordan continued to ignore Hailey.At this moment, Rachel suddenly said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go downstairs to make a long-distance call to my husband. You two have a good chat.\u201dAfter saying that, Rachel left the room and closed the door, leaving the two alone in the room.That was the purpose of their visit, actually.It was all to let Hailey have some time alone with Jordan so that she could then\u2026 apologize!\u201cJordan, I\u2019m sorry!\u201dThe beautiful Hailey had always been high up in the air and put on a pedestal by the majority of men in Orlando who knew who she was.With a loud thud, she dropped to her knees in front of Jordan and apologized to him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You even said the other day that you would never apologize to me in this lifetime. Haha.\u201dJordan had won.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, Hubby. It\u2019s all my fault. Will you forgive me?\u201dWhile kneeling, Hailey grabbed the hem of Jordan\u2019s trousers while begging him miserably. At this point, she had already burst into tears.Who would have thought that the pretty, flawless, and wealthy woman who was known as the most beautiful girl in Orlando would end up having to stoop so low one day?Jordan did not waver. Instead, he asked, \u201cYou\u2019ve done me wrong, and it took you so long to apologize to me. How do you expect me to forgive you?\u201dHailey wiped her tears and explained, \u201cHubby, you\u2019ve misunderstood me. I\u2019ve never actually done anything to wrong you.\u201dJordan was infuriated. \u201cI saw it with my own eyes, and you still want to deny it?\u201dHailey frantically said, \u201cHear me out, I was just muddled up at that time, and I fell for Tyler\u2019s trick. He lured me to the hotel.\u201d\u201cBut you arrived to deliver takeout before we even did anything. After you left, I felt like I was really letting you down, so I left the hotel immediately and went home to cook for you.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m not good at cooking, and I was scared that you wouldn\u2019t like the food I made, so I ordered takeout instead.\u201d\u201cThere are surveillance cameras at the entrance of our home, and the footage of me returning home that day is still present. You can go check the timestamp yourself.\u201d\u201cOr, you can just\u2026\u201dHailey got a little shy when she said the last sentence.Jordan didn\u2019t know if Hailey was telling the truth or just making things up so that she could get back together with him.Jordan didn\u2019t want to figure it out either!\u201cEven if it\u2019s true, you already had the intention of being unfaithful towards me at that time. I can\u2019t forgive you.\u201dJordan said indifferently.Hailey wept again. \u201cHubby, I have my reasons. You\u2019ve always been the only one I love. I got cheated by Tyler only because I wanted to do something for my family.\u201d\u201cAs you know, my father and uncle are vying with each other for the family assets and inheritance. Since I don\u2019t have a brother, the family\u2019s company will definitely be handed over to Drew in the future. I had no choice but to impress my grandmother as much as possible because my parents have been pressing me to do so.\u201dJordan was well aware of that.Jordan said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt and take it that you were forced into it but don\u2019t you find it ridiculous that you\u2019re saying that you love me? If you really loved me, would you have abstained from getting intimate with me in the past three years!?!\u201dHailey cried and complained, \u201cThat\u2019s because of my mom\u2019s demands. I wanted to consummate our marriage, but she refused to let me.\u201d\u201cTrust me, I\u2019m still a virgin now, and we can consummate our marriage tonight.\u201dAs Hailey spoke, she grabbed Jordan\u2019s suit again.Jordan pushed her away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201dJordan said, \u201cHailey Camden, you know every well yourself that if I\u2019m still the good-for-nothing who works as a deliveryman that you think I am, you definitely wouldn\u2019t be getting on your knees and saying these things to me now!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re only apologizing because you know I\u2019m wealthy!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like materialistic women who are only after money. We will never get back together!\u201dHailey hurriedly explained, \u201cI don\u2019t love money. I love you!\u201dHowever, no matter how Hailey tried to defend herself, Jordan would ignore her.Hailey was so worked up that she leaped into Jordan\u2019s arms.She initially wanted to force a kiss on Jordan, but he dodged.\u201cDon\u2019t do that. Let go of me.\u201dJordan tried to shake Hailey off, but she kept clinging onto him and wrapping her arms tightly around him. Unless he used brute force, he wouldn\u2019t be able to shake her off at all.\u201cI refuse!\u201dHailey hugged Jordan tightly and stubbornly refused to let go.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dJordan had no choice. After all, he couldn\u2019t punch her and knock her down.That was a tactic that Rachel had taught Hailey.While hugging Jordan, Hailey asked, \u201cYou must have bought that villa in Phuket for me, haven\u2019t you? You must know that it\u2019s my favorite place for a holiday. I want to spend a few days with you in that villa. We can drink and enjoy the view of the sea together.\u201d\u201cI really like this villa too. Shall I move in?\u201d\u201cI want to give birth to a pair of children for you. Can we do that?\u201dIn the past three years, Jordan had never felt such tenderness from Hailey before!However, Jordan was not the type to be convinced easily.He made up his mind and pushed Hailey onto the bed.Due to the fact that the bed was very soft, Hailey wouldn\u2019t get hurt.Afterward, Jordan said, \u201cHailey Camden, if you had gotten on your knees to apologize to me before I revealed my identity, we would still have had a chance to get back together.\u201d\u201cNevertheless, you chose to do so only after discovering that I\u2019m the president of a corporation. It disgusts me!\u201dAfter saying that, Jordan walked out of the bedroom for fear of being pestered by Hailey again.When Jordan reached the first floor, he said to Rachel, who pretended to be on the phone, \u201cRachel, take Hailey away with you. I\u2019m going to get some rest.\u201dSeeing how furious Jordan was, Rachel hurriedly put down the phone and said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go check on her\u2026\u201dRachel soon arrived at the third floor. She opened the bedroom door, only to realize that Hailey was hiding under Jordan\u2019s duvet and crying her heart out.Rachel hurriedly stepped forward and gave Hailey a piece of tissue. \u201cMy dear, what are you doing? You have snot and tears all over your face. How can Jordan be attracted to you like this?\u201dHailey hugged Rachel and cried. \u201cWhat should I do? Jordan refuses to forgive me, I\u2019ve already gotten on my knees to beg him, and that\u2019s the first time in my life that I\u2019ve ever done that\u2026\u201dRachel patted Hailey on her shoulder and comforted, \u201cDon\u2019t panic. This is only your first try. How can he forgive you so easily? Just do it a few more times, and it\u2019ll work.\u201d\u201cSo, what do I do now?\u201d Hailey asked.At this moment, thunder roared in the sky.\u201cIs it going to rain?\u201dRachel had a flash of inspiration, and she said, \u201cGo to the courtyard and kneel down on the ground to beg for Jordan\u2019s forgiveness. Say that you won\u2019t get up unless he forgives you.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Hailey went all out. She just wanted to become the respected Mrs. Steele now.Rachel took Hailey downstairs and said to Jordan in a dignified manner, \u201cMr. Steele, I\u2019m sorry to have disturbed you tonight. We shall take our leave now.\u201dJordan didn\u2019t see them off either. \u201cI\u2019ll have the chauffeur send you guys out.\u201dJordan began to give the chauffeur instructions, but when Hailey went out into the courtyard, she got on her knees again and said, \u201cJordan, I can\u2019t won\u2019t get up until you forgive me!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If women, especially beautiful ones, took the initiative to apologize to them and pursue them, men would usually accept them easily.Pretending to be surprised, Rachel walked to the villa again. She said to Jordan, \u201cJordan, look, Hailey has gotten on her knees to apologize to you again. If you still don\u2019t forgive her, she won\u2019t get up.\u201d\u201cI just saw the weather forecast, and there\u2019ll be a heavy downpour soon. Why don\u2019t you forgive her first? What if it starts raining and she still refuses to get up?\u201d\u201cFor the past three years, you have taken such good care of her, and she has never once fallen ill. You don\u2019t want her to catch a cold, do you?\u201dRachel knew very well that it would pain Jordan to see Hailey fall sick.Jordan would indeed be heartbroken, but he wouldn\u2019t forgive Hailey just because of that!It was a matter of principle. If he just forgave her for her infidelity so easily, the consequences to bear for her wrongdoing would be too trivial!Jordan remembered that the sky was still full of stars when he came home, so he thought it wouldn\u2019t rain.\u201cIf she wants to continue kneeling, let her be!\u201dAfter saying that, he walked up the stairs heartlessly and entered the bedroom on the third floor.Rachel walked out again, pretending to persuade Hailey to leave. However, before she left, she said to Hailey supportively, \u201cYou go, girl!\u201dAfter about ten minutes, the thunder rumbled again. Jordan walked towards the window of his bedroom on the third floor, only to see that there were no longer any stars in the sky from a sky that was full of stars just earlier on.Instead, there were dark clouds in the gloomy sky.Pitter-patter.Raindrops kept falling down.Jordan remarked, \u201cThe weather today is the most bizarre I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dHe remembered that there weren\u2019t any predicted showers when he looked at the weather forecast in the morning.He thought that maybe God was punishing Hailey, this unfaithful woman, by choosing to rain when she had decided to kneel down in the open!The rain fell on Hailey\u2019s long, smooth and beautiful tresses, as well as her delicate face and her expensive dress.Jordan was standing on the third floor, looking at her through the window.There were lights in the courtyard, so Jordan could still see Hailey even though it was late at night.At this moment, Jordan was watching his ex-wife get drenched in the rain. However, he didn\u2019t pity her and instead relished in the thrill of taking revenge!\u201cYou reap what you sow! Hailey Camden just continue kneeling. I won\u2019t give in!\u201dJordan muttered when he was in the room.Gradually, the rain surprisingly became heavier and heavier. Even the wind began howling!The heavy downpour was crashing down on Hailey, making her thoroughly drenched!Her head was wet and no longer as layered and voluminous as it was before. They were now all sticking to her scalp.The exquisite makeup that she had spent an hour applying was all smudged and washed away by the rain.However\u2026At this juncture, Hailey looked completely unkempt and disheveled.Yet, Jordan realized she was still as gorgeous as ever!\u201cThis woman is such a ravishing beauty! She\u2019s in such a mess because of the rain, but she\u2019s actually still so beautiful!\u201dIt was no wonder that Jordan used to adore Hailey so much. She was simply too beautiful.However, Jordan found it a pity that he never really had her!Jordan honestly didn\u2019t have any emotional regrets about divorcing Hailey.Just like in the poem, Jordan had never expected Hailey to spend the rest of her life with him. All he wanted was for her to genuinely love him, even if it was just for a moment.However, there was something Jordan felt was a shame.That was, Hailey had never been his woman!Looking at her exquisite features, Jordan suddenly had an evil idea.\u201cShould I be a scumbag for once? Should I pretend to forgive her and make her stay the night, do the deed, and then turn my back on her tomorrow morning?\u201dHowever, Jordan let his idea remain as a mere thought in his mind. After all, it was one of his greatest regrets in life.He would never do such a thing.Thus, Jordan simply stopped looking at her, lest his evil idea turned into reality.Just like that, an hour passed, and the rain dissipated a little, but it didn\u2019t stop.Jordan walked to the window again and found that Hailey was still kneeling on the ground!\u201cAh.\u201dJordan sighed again. \u2018Maybe, I should go downstairs and tell Hailey that I\u2019ll never forgive her regardless of how long she kneels for.\u2019However, he was afraid that Hailey would pester him again like she had just done.Jordan made up his mind and decided to wait for another hour.Jordan spent that hour watching Hailey see if she would slack off and take a break.However, Hailey stayed still on her knees.\u201cHailey Camden\u2026\u201dJordan knew that Hailey was a spoiled brat who was different from the firm and domineering Victoria. She definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to stand staying under the rain for such a long time.Just as he expected, Hailey\u2019s body began swaying unsteadily after another two minutes.With a loud thud, Hailey suddenly fell to the side and passed out!Jordan dashed downstairs almost instinctively and sprinted out to the courtyard.\u201cHailey! Hailey!\u201dJordan patted Hailey\u2019s face in a bid to wake her up.However, Hailey did not respond at all.Jordan had been on the battlefield before, and he would be able to tell if someone was feigning dead or pretending to faint or not.Hence, Jordan was sure that Hailey had really fainted.Thus, he picked her up in his arms and headed back inside the villa, where he placed her on the couch in the living room.Actually, it was the first time Jordan had carried Hailey in his arms.After three years as her husband, Jordan finally had the honor to do that!Jordan couldn\u2019t help but find it ironic!\u201cMr. Jordan.\u201d A maid walked over from the servants\u2019 chamber when she heard the sounds.Jordan took the towel handed to him by the maid and used it to wipe away the rainwater on Hailey\u2019s body.He said, \u201cCall the ambulance.\u201d\u201cYes, Mr. Jordan.\u201dThe ambulance soon arrived, and the doctor carried Hailey to the ambulance.Before they left, Jordan instructed a female paramedic, \u201cAfter she wakes up, don\u2019t tell her that I was the one who carried her back into the villa. Just say that you guys picked her up from the courtyard.\u201dDespite feeling puzzled, the female paramedic answered, \u201cOh, alright.\u201dAfterward, Jordan gave the paramedics the Camdens\u2019 contact number.Half an hour later, in Florida Hospital.Hailey had been put on the IV drip and had come too long ago.Meanwhile, Rachel and the Camdens had also arrived.There were no major issues with Hailey\u2019s health, and she had merely caught a cold, but that wasn\u2019t what her family was concerned about.They were more concerned about the outcome of Hailey\u2019s meeting with Jordan.Sylvie asked, \u201cHailey, how did your talk with Jordan go?\u201dHailey sobbed and said, \u201cJordan is so heartless, I knelt for two hours, but he refused to forgive me!\u201dRachel glanced at Hailey and asked the nurse, \u201cWas she inside the villa or at the courtyard when you guys picked her up?\u201dThe nurse hesitated for a long time, feeling extremely displeased with Jordan when she saw Hailey\u2019s pitiful and upset.\u201cSeriously, do rich people get the right to do this just because they\u2019re rich? How can he make such a beautiful girl kneel down and apologize to him? I\u2019m not going to obey his instructions!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why would he make her get on her knees and apologize to him? This is outrageous!\u2019The female nurse was actually an extreme feminist who had a large number of followers on Instagram, most of whom were feminists who would often publish posts with long captions to show support and stand up for women.Last year, the renowned pianist Evan Cadence got married to a woman more than ten years younger than him. Not only was she young, but she was also pretty, well-educated, and had an enviable figure.This female nurse had once called Evan out on Instagram and slammed him for being a disgusting cradle-snatcher who wasn\u2019t worthy of such a brilliant wife!Evan was a world-class pianist and a rare prodigy, after all.Despite being such a successful and accomplished man, in the eyes of the female nurse, he wasn\u2019t worthy of marrying such a young and pretty woman!Clearly, she was highly biased against men!Hence, the female nurse deliberately fabricated a story and lied, \u201cWhen we reached the villa, she was in the bedroom of the second or third floor of the villa.\u201dEveryone was elated that Jordan had brought Hailey back inside the villa and wasn\u2019t that heartless after all.Of course, Jordan was a gentleman, and it was only expected that he would do that.After all, Hailey had already passed out, and he couldn\u2019t possibly continue to leave her under the rain while she was unconscious.The female nurse continued, \u201cWhen we brought Miss Camden away from the villa, we discovered that the rainwater had already been wiped away, and apart from her hair and clothes, her body was completely dry.\u201dThe female nurse was obviously lying because all Jordan did was carry Hailey inside and place her on the couch in the living room.He had also only wiped her face and neck with a towel, leaving the rest of her body untouched!Hearing this, a few of them were shocked.\u2018Did Jordan wipe Hailey down?\u2019Hailey was shy too!She really hoped that that was the case!However, she also knew that there was a maid in the villa, so it was not necessarily Jordan who had wiped her dry.At this moment, the female nurse continued, \u201cI also found that Miss Camden\u2019s clothes were a little messy at that time. I suspect that the man in the villa might have taken liberties with her!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dBoth Hailey and Sylvie were overjoyed to hear the nurse\u2019s words.Hailey said gleefully, \u201cJordan loves me. I knew it. He still loves me!\u201dThe female nurse was puzzled by their reaction, and she asked, \u201cMiss Camden, you\u2019re so beautiful. You can have any man you want. Why did you have to kneel for a man? That\u2019s such an embarrassment and disgrace to women!\u201d\u201cApart from his wealth, that man doesn\u2019t seem to have much to offer. He isn\u2019t that tall either. He\u2019s just a scoundrel!\u201d\u201cMiss Camden, if you want a boyfriend, I can introduce you to a tall, handsome and rich man!\u201dWhen Rachel heard this, she took out a 20-dollar banknote from her purse and handed it to the nurse, \u201cOkay, you can go out now. There\u2019s none of your business here.\u201d\u2018How dare she call Jordan a scoundrel?\u2019If Hailey weren\u2019t her best friend, even Rachel would try to snatch such a rich and eligible dreamboat like Jordan!After the nurse left the ward, Hailey happily shook Sylvie\u2019s hands and rejoiced, \u201cMom, did you hear that? Jordan might have kissed me when I was unconscious!\u201dSylvie said happily, \u201cI heard it, I heard it. Well, my daughter is so beautiful. How can Jordan hold back when he is gazing at you? He\u2019s a man, after all.\u201d\u201cDoes this mean he has forgiven me?\u201dHailey looked at Rachel, her \u201cadviser\u201d.Rachel laughed and said, \u201cI told you that Jordan just has a bark that\u2019s worse than his bite. Deep down, he had probably already forgiven you a long time ago, but as a man and the president of a big corporation, his ego kept him from giving in.\u201d\u201cHailey, just keep working hard, and one day he will get back together with you.\u201dHailey nodded vigorously. \u201cYes, yes!\u201dDrew and Elle were also present. Of course, they were not concerned about Hailey\u2019s health but mainly wanted to determine Jordan\u2019s attitude towards Hailey.Elle thought to herself, \u2018Jordan had the guts to take advantage of Hailey when she was unconscious! I have a better figure than Hailey. If I pass out in front of Jordan one day, will he do the same to me?\u2019Elle began to have unrealistic fantasies again.Drew then stepped forward and said, \u201cHailey, you have me to thank for this. You may be beautiful, but if I hadn\u2019t supervised you during this period and stopped you from moving in with Tyler premaritally, do you think Jordan would still want you after Tyler Collins has tainted you for such a long time?\u201dAt this point, Hailey indeed felt grateful to Drew!Hailey could lie about being in the hotel room with Tyler, but if Drew hadn\u2019t stopped Hailey from moving in with Tyler by pretending that it was Diana\u2019s instructions and calling her every night to supervise, she would have probably slept with Tyler numerous times by now!After all, they had already registered their marriage then and were considered a lawfully married couple. Besides, they would live together in the future anyway, and Hailey would never turn Tyler down.However, if that happened, Jordan would despise Hailey!\u201cThank you, Drew,\u201d Hailey said, thanking Drew with utmost sincerity.After saying that, Hailey pulled the needle out of her hand. \u201cI passed out because I was too devastated. I don\u2019t need the drip anymore; I\u2019m going to go home and inform Grandma of the good news!\u201dEarlier on, Diana said that if Hailey could not get Jordan back, she would not acknowledge her as a Camden.Having made so much progress during her first attempt to beg Jordan, Hailey, of course, wanted to let her grandmother know.An hour later, in the Camdens\u2019 villa.\u201cReally? The nurse said that?\u201dAfter hearing this, Diana said with a heartened smile, \u201cThank God for giving my granddaughter such a beautiful face. Haha, as long as Jordan still has feelings for you, you have a chance to get back together with him!\u201dRachel agreed and chimed in, \u201cThe problem now is that Jordan has to pretend to be heartless on the surface because of his ego. I\u2019m afraid he might not let Hailey see him again.\u201dDiana nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s just how stubborn Jordan is! He will indeed do that! We should give Hailey a chance to meet him!\u201d\u201cHow should we do that?\u201d Sylvie asked impatiently.She wanted so badly to have Jordan as her son-in-law again.While thinking about it, Diana suddenly looked at her poodle, Lucky, which she was now holding in her arms.Diana threw Lucky onto the ground and stepped on its front paw.\u201cAhhhh\u2026\u201dLucky immediately began screaming and whimpering in pain.\u201cGrandma, what are you doing?\u201dHailey was also astounded because Diana usually pampered Lucky the poodle to bits!Diana said, \u201cDrew, call Jordan tomorrow and tell him that his favorite poodle, Lucky, is injured!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You must be up and awake. I was worried that I might disturb you from resting by calling you so early in the morning!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Just say so directly,\u201d Jordan said with great impatience.He knew that Drew knew how to behave himself nowadays and wouldn\u2019t call Jordan randomly to create trouble for him.Drew said, \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Jordan. A flower pot fell onto Grandma\u2019s poodle, Lucky, and now its paw is fractured. It\u2019s really pitiful. It hasn\u2019t eaten for a day!\u201d\u201cGrandma said that it would be willing to eat only if you\u2019re the one feeding it. Can you make a trip here to Grandma\u2019s?\u201dJordan could tell that the Camdens just wanted Jordan to go back to their place.He wasn\u2019t sure if Lucky was injured or not.Even if it was hurt, it wouldn\u2019t have been so coincidental that it happened after he revealed his identity. Thus, he knew it was likely that they had deliberately hurt Lucky!Exasperated, Jordan questioned, \u201cDid you people deliberately injure Lucky just to lure me there?\u201dDrew frantically said, \u201cHow is that possible, Jordan?! Lucky is Grandma\u2019s baby. We wouldn\u2019t dare to hurt it.\u201dJordan humphed coldly and exclaimed, \u201cThat\u2019d better be the case!\u201d\u201cAfter I get off from work this afternoon, I\u2019ll head straight to your grandmother\u2019s place. Tell your grandmother that I\u2019m taking Lucky away! She is free to name her price.\u201dLucky was the only belonging of the Camdens that Jordan wanted the most.After three years of companionship in the past, Jordan and Lucky were indeed quite reliant and attached to each other.Drew was elated. \u201cYes, yes, yes, we\u2019ll prepare lunch and wait for you. See you tonight, Jordan!\u201dAfter a while, Jordan arrived at the office, where he saw someone who wanted to meet him.It was Rosie Huxley, Tyler\u2019s mother.Rosie was now dressed in a presentable business outfit. When she saw Jordan, she immediately smiled and said, \u201cMr. Steele, I don\u2019t know if you have the time now, but I\u2019d like to have a talk with you.\u201dJordan knew what she wanted to talk to him about. She undoubtedly wanted to plead with Jordan and ask him to let Tyler off.Regardless of whether what Hailey said yesterday was true or not, Tyler had indeed harbored designs on Jordan\u2019s wife and thus brought it upon himself!Jordan\u2019s plan for revenge on Tyler hadn\u2019t ended yet!Hence, he didn\u2019t want to talk to Rosie about that matter.\u201cI\u2019m very busy.\u201dJordan answered indifferently and then headed straight to the CEO\u2019s office.\u201cI shall wait for you in the meeting room then. Mr. Steele, when you\u2019re free, I hope you can find me some time.\u201dRosie chased after Jordan and asked.Jordan did not answer or chase him away.Jordan had a good impression of Rosie. Although she was also married to a wealthy man, she was much more polite and elegant than Sylvie.That may also be because Rosie was born to a wealthy family too.Jordan naturally wouldn\u2019t be busy for the entire day. However, he chose to make Rosie wait for the entire day.Apart from drinking some water, Rosie didn\u2019t eat anything in Jordan\u2019s office and was waiting for him.However, Jordan still did not give her a chance.At five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Jordan left the office and asked his driver to take him to the lakeside villa where Diana was.That villa could be said to be the place that Jordan was the most familiar within Jordan.For the past three years, he had traveled almost every day between the apartment that he and Hailey lived in and Diana\u2019s villa.He drove the Audi that Hailey had given him out of charity!Every time he went to the villa, Jordan would seem to lose his presence. After he drove to the entrance, no one came out.Even if one of the Camdens happened to be at the door by coincidence, they wouldn\u2019t bother looking at him or even take the initiative to greet him.Even if Jordan took the initiative to greet them, they would ignore him.Jordan had tried very hard to get along with the Camdens. He tried talking to Drew about NBA stars, tried complimenting Elle on the beautiful clothes she wore, and even tried giving Sylvie and Benedict some gifts.However, his efforts were all futile!They would ignore him every single time!However, today\u2026When Jordan reached the villa entrance in his Maybach, all the Camdens were standing at the gate to receive him!The eighty-year-old Diana included!\u201cA bunch of snobs!\u201dJordan didn\u2019t feel smug or elated when he saw that.He was disgusted by how materialistic they were!After the car stopped, the chauffeur alighted and got ready to open the door for Jordan.However, Drew jumped ahead and said, \u201cLet me do it, let me do it!\u201dAfter opening the door of the backseat, Drew smiled and said, \u201cJordan, you\u2019re here. Please come in.\u201dJordan did not pay attention to Drew, just like Drew ignored him in the past three years!Sylvie was the second to run over. She grabbed a piece of tissue paper and wiped Jordan\u2019s face with it. \u201cAh, Jordan, you must be tired after a day of hard work, huh? Look, you\u2019re already sweating.\u201dJordan reached out and pushed Sylvie away to prevent her from touching him.Benedict smiled and said respectfully, \u201cMr. Steele.\u201dHerman knew very well what he should do too. He seemed to have forgotten the grudge he bore against Jordan and walked towards him to greet him. \u201cMr. Steele, you\u2019re really impressive. The way you walk is mightier than Mr. Walton!\u201dUnlike in the past, Elle was now gazing at Jordan with adoration instead of disdain. She had dolled herself up and donned a preppy outfit. She then walked towards Jordan and handed him an exquisite envelope.\u201cI wrote a poem, and I\u2019d like to give it to you.\u201dJordan did not take the envelope. He wondered what had gotten into Elle, who usually wasn\u2019t a fan of poetry and classic songs.However, given his understanding of Elle over the past few years, she didn\u2019t have the literary skills to come up with anything impressive.\u201cJordan, you\u2019re here.\u201dDiana said to Jordan gently with a smile.Jordan humphed coldly in disdain. It indeed wasn\u2019t easy to make Diana swallow her pride and stoop so low!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was on her knees for too long yesterday, and it took hours of emergency rescue in the hospital for her to be resuscitated. Her condition has just improved a little, and she can\u2019t walk yet.\u201dJordan knew that Hailey had a fragile body, so it was normal for her to be worn out after kneeling for two hours.However, Jordan didn\u2019t believe that it took a few hours of emergency rescue to save her.For the past three years, Jordan had always been the one taking care of Hailey, and he was so meticulous that he knew better than anyone what Hailey\u2019s health was like.Jordan entered without saying anything else.As soon as he entered the familiar house, Jordan saw Hailey sitting at the dining table with Lucky in her arms.There was already a sumptuous spread of dishes on the dining table, which was unprecedented in the past three years.Seeing that Lucky\u2019s paw had really been bandaged, Jordan quickly walked over, feeling heartbroken.As soon as Jordan reached Lucky, he saw the wound on Hailey\u2019s leg.Hailey was wearing a short skirt. She initially planned to wear a pair of long pants to hide the wound, but Rachel advised her against it.If she were to cover it up, she wouldn\u2019t be able to win Jordan\u2019s sympathy!However, Jordan did not sympathize with Hailey after seeing her wound.Well, because she didn\u2019t spare a thought for his feelings when she checked into a hotel with Tyler at that time!\u201cJordan, you\u2019re here.\u201dHailey said feebly, her lips as pale as a sheet.Even so, she was still absolutely gorgeous.Jordan ignored her without showing her any concern or asking about her condition at all. He simply reached his hand out to carry Lucky over.Upon sight of Jordan, Lucky, which had been excited for a long time, leaped towards him.Seeing that Lucky was limping, Jordan knew that it was really injured.Jordan was heartbroken, and he hoped that the Camdens hadn\u2019t deliberately hurt Lucky just to make him visit them.Hence, Jordan said to Diana, \u201cMrs. Camden, I hope you sell this dog to me. I\u2019m willing to offer $150,000.\u201dDiana entered while supporting herself against a cane. She said smilingly, \u201cJordan, sit down and have some food. Since we\u2019re a family, Lucky belongs to you too. You don\u2019t have to buy it from me. That would seem too distant.\u201dJordan said sneeringly, \u201cHailey and I are divorced. You and I are really not family.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t plan to stay for a meal either. I\u2019ll leave immediately after I buy Lucky from you.\u201dJordan was very resolute and firm in his decision, making things somewhat awkward for the Camdens.Diana said, \u201cOkay, even if you don\u2019t want to eat, you should at least tell me what\u2019s going on, right? Why did you marry Hailey as a live-in husband when you\u2019re so rich? Why is my late husband the only one who knows about your background?\u201d\u201cJordan, if you don\u2019t tell me the truth, I really won\u2019t be able to die in peace!\u201dJordan knew that the Camdens had been kept in the dark about his identity for the past three years.Jordan ought to give them an explanation today!Hence, he said, \u201cFine, since you want to know, I will tell you.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a peculiar rule in the Steele family that all male heirs have to go through various trials and tests before they can inherit the family business.\u201d\u201cIn order to hone my character, my grandfather arranged for me to marry Hailey as a live-in husband three years ago.\u201d\u201cThe Camdens may only be a second-tier family, but you guys are at least prestigious and dignified. It would be difficult for me to marry Hailey without my grandfather\u2019s help.\u201d\u201cSo, my grandfather looked for Hailey\u2019s grandfather and discussed this matter with him.\u201d\u201cHailey\u2019s grandfather was very glad to be in-laws with us, but my grandfather told him that this matter must be kept strictly confidential to the both of them. Hailey\u2019s grandfather is the only Camden who knows about it. Once he reveals it to you guys, the engagement will be void!\u201dEveryone came to a sudden realization when they heard that.\u201cNo wonder Dad has been so adamant about not telling me anything before he passed! For the past two years, I\u2019ve wondered, what did Dad want to tell me that required so much hesitation?\u201dBenedict sighed emotionally when he recalled the past.Hailey\u2019s grandfather didn\u2019t dare to tell any of them because once he let Benedict or Sylvie find out, they would definitely change their attitude towards Jordan.Once their attitudes changed and they began to treat him better, Jordan\u2019s trial would be meaningless.At this moment, Diana began to reprimand Hailey.\u201cHailey Camden! You will never be able to find another man who\u2019s as good as Jordan. He\u2019s such a rare gem, but you didn\u2019t cherish him!\u201dElle walked towards them slowly and chimed in, \u201cYeah, Hailey is at fault for this. If I had married Jordan, I would never have done what she did!\u201d\u201cJordan, do you want to be my live-in husband for a year and let me train you this time?\u201dJordan looked at Elle speechlessly and refuted, \u201cNo, thank you, I don\u2019t need it!\u201d\u2018What a lunatic. After three years of being a live-in husband, why would I continue staying with the Camdens!?\u2019\u2018I\u2019ve long honed my character!\u2019\u201cElle, don\u2019t spout nonsense!\u201d Diana chided Elle.Diana then looked at Jordan again and said, \u201cJordan, we\u2019ve all mistreated you in the past three years. Today, we would like to toast to you and apologize!\u201d\u201cHerman, Benedict, quickly pour some wine!\u201d\u201cYes, Mom.\u201dThe Camdens each grabbed a wine glass and toasted it to Jordan as an apology.Jordan watched coldly with Lucky in his arms.When they all finished drinking, Jordan asked, \u201cCan you name your price now? Your apology really doesn\u2019t matter to me. Don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t intend to take revenge on you. My company will still continue to cooperate with you on Hailey Residences. However, this is the first and last cooperation we will have.\u201dFeeling extremely complicated, Diana glanced at Hailey before saying, \u201cJordan, I know you like Lucky, and you\u2019ve lived with us for three years too. You should know how much I adore Lucky.\u201d\u201cHow about this? Lucky shall stay with you for five days a week and at my place for two days. Is that alright?\u201dJordan knew how attached Diana was to Lucky, whom she had long regarded as a companion she would otherwise be lonely without.Jordan nodded and said, \u201cOkay, name your price.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pay us at all!\u201d Sylvie walked over with a smile. \u201cWe\u2019re all a family. There\u2019s no need to talk about money. Besides, the bracelet that you gave Mom for her birthday is worth several million!\u201dSylvie was very proud that her son-in-law was the one who gave that gift to Diana!Diana looked at the bracelet on her left wrist and removed it before handing it to Jordan.\u201cJordan, thank you for giving me such an expensive gift, but I don\u2019t deserve it because I\u2019ve failed my duties as your grandmother-in-law.

Besides, I don\u2019t want to have freeloaded off of the Camdens for the past three years.\u201dThe Camdens had been providing for Jordan for the past three years, and he didn\u2019t want to be called a freeloader.Diana nodded and took the bracelet back.She had always been very fond of the bracelet. Since she learned yesterday that it was really a gift from Jordan, she happily went to sleep with it.While carrying Lucky in his arms, Jordan said, \u201cI\u2019ll take my leave now if there\u2019s nothing else.\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Hailey called out to Jordan and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to have a word with you alone. It won\u2019t take you long.\u201dSylvie walked over and said, \u201cYeah, Jordan, you\u2019ve been here for less than a minute. Don\u2019t be in such a hurry to leave.\u201dDiana also pleaded on behalf of Hailey, \u201cYou two have been married for three years after all. If you disagree, Hailey will get on her knees and beg you again.\u201dJordan looked at Hailey\u2019s reddened kneecaps. He really didn\u2019t want to see her kneeling down again.\u201cAlright then.\u201dHailey could not take the stairs, so Jordan accompanied her to take the elevator to a room on the second floor.As soon as Jordan entered the room, he discovered that it had been decorated meticulously. The decor and style seemed similar to Hailey\u2019s room in the apartment in the New City residential estate.In a trance, Jordan thought he had returned to the home he had lived in for the past three years.\u201cJordan, there isn\u2019t a stool in this room. Let\u2019s sit on the bed and talk.\u201dHailey took the lead and sat on the bed.Jordan decided not to sit beside her and instead said, \u201cI\u2019ll just stand.\u201dHailey did not force him either and merely hung her head low with her knees together, rubbing her hands like a shy high school girl.Her voice was also extremely gentle.\u201cUm, thank you for yesterday.\u201dHailey lifted her head and looked at Jordan.Jordan realized that the way Hailey was behaving now was like how she used to act when they first met.Hailey was still a college student at that time, and her family had arranged for her to marry him, a complete stranger. On their wedding night, that was exactly how she spoke.That was also when Jordan liked Hailey the most.Of course, Rachel had suggested that Hailey pretend to behave that way.Rachel strongly believed that the beginning of a romantic relationship would forever be the best part of it. Hence, she told Hailey to behave like she used to when she first got to know Jordan.\u201cYou\u2019re thanking me?\u201dDespite the pouring rain yesterday, Jordan heartlessly let Hailey kneel in front of his villa and left her standing there for two hours while ignoring her.\u2018Hailey is thanking me instead of hating me?\u2019Hailey said softly, \u201cThe nurse\u2026 has told me everything.\u201dShe even seemed a little shy when she said that.\u201cOh.\u201dOnly then did Jordan understand what was going on. It turned out that the nurse had defied his instructions and told Hailey the truth.However, the truth wasn\u2019t that unseemly.The truth was that Hailey had fainted, and Jordan carried her inside the villa so that she would stop getting drenched by the rain. That was a mere act of humanity.Even if Hailey was not his ex-wife but just a stranger or even a homeless person, Jordan would have done the same.Hence, Jordan wasn\u2019t bothered by the fact that the nurse ignored his instructions.To his surprise, Hailey said, \u201cJordan, I\u2026 I don\u2019t blame you for what you did to me last night.\u201dJordan was stunned because Hailey seemed to be implying that he had taken liberties with her!Jordan was enraged. \u201cYes, I was the one who carried you inside because I saw that you had fainted.\u201d\u201cWhy? Can\u2019t I carry you in? Are you going to blame me for carrying you inside?\u201dJordan was really furious because Hailey had been treating him that way in the past three years!She refused to even let him touch her hand, let alone carry her!Once, both of them went for a test drive in a vintage Porsche car that was built in the 80s and had a manual transmission gearbox.Due to the fact that Hailey was seated slightly towards her left and close to the gearbox, Jordan accidentally touched her thigh when he was shifting the gear stick.At that time, Hailey lost her temper. She gave Jordan a severe scolding, calling him shameless for taking advantage of her!He was really overwhelmed and frustrated at that time!They were clearly a married couple, so he didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t have physical contact with her!Jordan\u2019s grandfather wanted him to become a real live-in husband, not a servant!If he couldn\u2019t have any physical contact with his wife, that would make him the same as a servant of the Camdens.\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t be angry, Hubby, you can do anything to me. Why would I blame you?\u201dHailey hurriedly hugged Jordan, but he pushed her away.\u201cDon\u2019t call me Hubby. Call me Jordan!\u201dHailey\u2019s leg was injured, and her body was weak, so she could no longer pester Jordan and cling onto him by force like she did yesterday.Feeling aggrieved, Hailey said, \u201cJordan, I may have almost been unfaithful to you but aren\u2019t you at fault too?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re clearly a rich man\u2019s son, but you lied to us that you\u2019re a penniless man. You had me fooled for three whole years!\u201d\u201cIf you had told me the truth from the beginning, I wouldn\u2019t have even bothered with someone like Tyler!\u201dJordan knew that he had indeed been unfair to Hailey for keeping the truth from her for three years.Jordan said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m indeed to blame for hiding the truth for three years. How about this? I\u2019ll treat you to a meal after you get better and make it up to you.\u201d\u201cMake it up to me?\u201dHailey was suddenly elated!\u2018What does that mean?\u2019\u2018Is he going to reconcile with me?\u2019\u2018Is he going to marry me again?\u2019\u2018Oh my God, won\u2019t that Maybach and villa in Phuket belong to me then?\u2019Hailey excitedly grabbed Jordan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not hurt. Let\u2019s go have a meal tomorrow!\u201dJordan took another look at Hailey\u2019s leg and then said with a nod, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s settled then.\u201d\u201cWhere should we go? Chicken and Noodles?\u201d Hailey asked.Jordan smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m the president of Ace Corporation now. Of course, I have to take you to a nicer restaurant. Let\u2019s go to The Times. Haven\u2019t you always liked that place?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Hailey exclaimed joyfully.Jordan let go of Hailey\u2019s fingers and said, \u201cI should go now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see you off.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Get some rest.\u201dJordan headed downstairs with the poodle, Lucky, in his arms.\u201cJordan, why are you leaving already? It\u2019s only been such a short while since you entered. You should chat for a little longer.\u201dSylvie was a little upset to see that Jordan had come downstairs so soon.They were all hoping that Hailey could sleep with Jordan.After all, in the eyes of the Camdens, Jordan was lusting after Hailey\u2019s body.Jordan said, \u201cThat\u2019s unnecessary. We\u2019re going out for a meal tomorrow.\u201dSylvie and the others were overjoyed to hear that!\u2018There\u2019s progress!\u2019\u2018Jordan is willing to have a meal with Hailey!\u2019\u2018That means there\u2019s a chance for the both of them!\u2019Elle immediately got jealous when she saw that and hurriedly walked towards him. \u201cJordan, I think we need to have a chat alone too!\u201dHowever, Jordan didn\u2019t give her a chance. \u201cGo play on your own to the side.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, he knew that he shouldn\u2019t harbor such thoughts about Elle.Hence, Jordan ignored Elle and left the villa.All the Camdens walked out to see Jordan off and returned only after watching him get inside his car and leaving the villa.When Jordan returned inside his car, he called Butler Frank.\u201cButler Frank.\u201d\u201cDo you have any orders for me, Mr. Jordan?\u201d\u201cIs your grandson still in DC? I\u2019d like to arrange a blind date for him, set for tomorrow evening.\u201d\u201cYes, he\u2019s in DC. I\u2019ll have him go over to Orlando right away.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dJordan agreed to have dinner with Hailey tomorrow not because he wanted to give Hailey the chance to get back together with him, but because he had other plans.In the past three years, Jordan had hidden the truth from Hailey, which was frankly quite unfair to her.Hence, he wanted to make it up to her.He decided to introduce her to a wealthy scion from a billionaire family, who was none other than Butler Frank\u2019s grandson.Although Butler Frank was a subordinate of the Steeles, his power and assets were far greater than that of the Camdens.Hence, Butler Frank\u2019s grandson was definitely worthy of Hailey. If Hailey was willing to marry him, she would also get to live in the lap of luxury.In Jordan\u2019s opinion, Hailey wanted to get back together with him only because of money.She didn\u2019t have to go to all that trouble, actually.\u2018Don\u2019t you love money? I\u2019ll introduce you to a rich man.\u2019The only shortcoming was that Butler Frank\u2019s grandson was sexually impotent.\u2018Doesn\u2019t Hailey Camden want that?\u2019\u2018The fact that she didn\u2019t get intimate with me for three years shows that she doesn\u2019t have any sexual needs.\u2019While he was pondering about it, they soon arrived at Rose Garden Villas.\u201cMr. Steele! Mr. Steele!\u201dLast night, Jordan was stopped by Rachel and Hailey at the entrance of the villa.To his surprise, there was a woman there again.Jordan rolled down the window of the car to see that it was Tyler\u2019s mother, Rosie.Rosie was really determined to meet Jordan. Yesterday, she waited in Jordan\u2019s office without eating or drinking for an entire day, just to see him.Now, she showed up at Jordan\u2019s home.\u201cMrs. Collins, please go back. I have nothing to talk to you about.\u201dJordan said to Rosie.Rosie begged miserably, \u201cMr. Steele, I\u2019m begging you, please let me have a word with you. It will only take you five minutes.\u201dJordan shook his head, but when she saw Rosie\u2019s desperate plea, he said, \u201cCome in.\u201dJordan did not let Rosie get inside his car, but instead, he let her run behind his car.Jordan felt that the Collins were not fit to be in the same car as him.When he arrived at the first floor of the villa, Jordan did not instruct the servants to prepare any drinks to serve Rosie with.Jordan sat down on the couch and said straightforwardly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Go ahead and tell me.\u201dRosie did not dare to spout any nonsense and instead went straight to the point. \u201cMr. Steele, I truly understood what happened between you, Tyler, and Hailey only after meeting you yesterday.\u201d\u201cTyler is a scoundrel for seducing Hailey despite knowing that she\u2019s a married woman. He does deserve a beating! His father and I have already beaten him up into a pulp!\u201d\u201cHowever, according to Tyler and Hailey\u2019s explanation, they didn\u2019t get intimate with each other, and Miss Camden is still a virgin.\u201dJordan snapped furiously, \u201cDon\u2019t give me that! I saw your son and my ex-wife in a hotel room, with my very own eyes!\u201d\u201cYes, yes, they may not have really done the deed, but Tyler is indeed wrong to have had those intentions. However, Tyler is not entirely to blame for this. Hailey Camden has always been very mercenary and materialistic. If she hadn\u2019t thought that you were incompetent, she would not have agreed to marry Tyler.\u201dRosie continued to explain.Jordan humphed coldly and said, \u201cI don\u2019t need you to worry about Hailey Camden. I have my own ways to punish her. But, don\u2019t think of putting all the blame on her!\u201dRosie was feeling anxious because she knew that Hailey and Tyler would never escape Jordan\u2019s clutches.Rosie said right away, \u201cMr. Steele, how do you plan to punish my son?\u201dJordan thought for a moment and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I might ask Pablo and Salvatore for their opinion. They would probably want to castrate Tyler Collins.\u201dHearing these words, Rosie\u2019s heart sank, and she felt even more troubled.Rosie immediately got on her knees in front of Jordan and exclaimed, \u201cMr. Steele, Tyler is still young and childless. Please be merciful to him!\u201dRosie was weeping incessantly, feeling worried and devastated for her son.In fact, before she came, she had already arranged for Tyler to sleep with numerous women, and perhaps, one of them had already gotten pregnant with Tyler\u2019s child.Jordan was very uncomfortable about the fact that Rosie was kneeling down in front of him.After all, Rosie was an elder who had a certain status and influence in the business circle of Orlando.Putting aside all else, Jordan admired Rosie for her temperament, elegance, appearance, and mannerisms alone.However, Jordan did not proceed to help her up.\u2018Since her son has done something wrong, she can keep kneeling down if she wants!\u2019\u201cHow about breaking one of his fingers?\u201dJordan continued.Rosie continued to beg on her knees, \u201cMr. Steele! If you cut his finger, we\u2019ll be heartbroken too! Please have mercy and not hurt him.\u201dJordan humphed coldly. \u201cI knew it. You don\u2019t want your son to bear the consequences at all!\u201d\u201cYour son provoked me, and I\u2019m a powerful figure in Orlando now. Everyone knows about that shameless affair between your son and my ex-wife. If I don\u2019t punish him and let him continue sauntering and throwing his weight around in Orlando. How can I continue making a living in the future!?!\u201dRosie agreed with him.As the president of Ace Corporation, Jordan was very famous and esteemed. After his identity was exposed, everyone kept discussing him too.Jordan could forgo the fact that it was an insult to his pride.Rosie suddenly fell silent for three whole minutes.At one point, Jordan even wondered if there was something wrong with Rosie.Three minutes later, Rosie suddenly took off her outer layer of clothes and said, \u201cMr. Steele, I can help you regain your pride.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her eyes were full of determination as if she was ready to go all out and die bravely.Rosie said, \u201c\u201dMr. Steele, Leonard, Tyler, the Ace Corporation personnel, and those from the Collins\u2019 company know I am here to see you today,\u201d Rosie said.Jordan nodded and said, \u201cI know, and what about that?\u201dRosie suddenly said, \u201cI can stay here for the night!\u201dJordan was really taken aback by her words. \u2018What a callous thing to say!\u2019At this moment, Jordan finally understood what Rosie meant.Many people knew that Tyler had slept with the ex-wife of Jordan, the president of the esteemed Ace Corporation, which was a colossal disgrace and humiliation to Jordan.If Jordan slept with Tyler\u2019s mother today, no one would ridicule Jordan again.Such a method of revenge was far more impressive than crippling Tyler.Jordan looked at Rosie in astonishment. He totally didn\u2019t expect that she would be willing to make such a huge sacrifice for the sake of saving her son!\u201cMrs. Collins\u2026\u201dJordan looked at the ring on her ring finger and felt somewhat awkward in front of Rosie, who was twenty years older than him.Rosie chuckled and said, \u201cOf course, I know I can\u2019t be compared to Hailey or Victoria Clarke. I\u2019m just an old woman who is way past my prime. I can totally accept it if you\u2019re not attracted to me.\u201dJordan was even more at a loss for words. Rosie was indeed a bit too old for Jordan.However, because she was a middle-aged woman, she had maintained her beauty well, and she was no less attractive than female celebrities of her age.Jordan said, \u201cMrs. Collins, you\u2019re gorgeous. You might be older than me, but you exude a mature charm that young women in their twenties do not possess.\u201dRosie felt a lot less awkward after receiving a compliment from Jordan.To her surprise, Jordan continued, \u201cHowever, even so, I have no other thoughts about you.\u201dRosie lowered her head again. Her plan to atone for her son\u2019s mistakes had fallen through.\u201cBut.\u201dThere was surprisingly another twist. \u201cI heard that you can sing very well. I\u2019d be glad to listen to you sing if you\u2019re willing to stay behind.\u201dJordan had watched some videos of Rosie singing on Instagram previously and had taken a liking to her singing.Rosie had the elegant charm of a songstress in the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, and Jordan really wanted to listen to her sing.Grinning widely from ear to ear, Rosie said, \u201cMr. Steele, I\u2019m absolutely willing to sing for you for the rest of the night. What songs do you like to listen to? If you like popular songs that were released in recent years, I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to sing them because I\u2019ve never heard them before.\u201dJordan said, \u201cMrs. Collins, forgive me for being presumptuous, but when I first saw a photo of you, I thought that you looked like a songstress from the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s in New York. It so happens that you\u2019re from New York too. What a coincidence.\u201d\u201cWhen I was a child, I often heard my grandfather talk about the olden days in New York, which he says are the most memorable for him. It was the era that represented elegance, romance, modernity, and classicism.\u201d\u201cGrandpa would always describe the women from that era and the glamorous outfits they would don during their performances in halls. They would even dance along as they sang.\u201d\u201cSo, I\u2019d like you to sing some classic tunes.\u201dRosie was a little surprised to hear that. \u201cOh, Mr. Steele, so you\u2019d like to experience the vibes of New York in the olden days. I was born much later than that era, so songs from that era are all a little too old for me as well.\u201d\u201cHowever, my mother often sang those old classics so I can sing them too.\u201d\u201cMr. Steele, please give me a moment while I get someone to bring me a dress and a microphone.\u201dJordan initially wanted to say that he would be preparing those items.However, he realized that he couldn\u2019t prepare a suitable dress for her on second thought because he didn\u2019t know Rosie\u2019s body measurements.After about twenty minutes, someone delivered 20 dresses as Rosie had instructed!It seemed that Rosie was a fan of dresses.\u201cMr. Steele, please pick one for me.\u201dRosie laid out all the dresses.Jordan picked them up without any restraints and began scrutinizing each one carefully.Finally, Jordan picked a long beige dress and handed it to Rosie. \u201cThis one\u2019s it.\u201dRosie took the dress and said respectfully, \u201cAlright. Please wait a moment while I get changed, Mr. Steele. I shall perform \u2018You Are My Sunshine.\u201d\u2026In the Wallaces\u2019 villa at half-past two in the morning.Leonard was smoking a cigarette in the living room on the first floor. The ashtray was already full of cigarette butts.Tyler came down from upstairs and walked over relaxedly. When he saw the sad expression on Leonard\u2019s face, he asked, \u201cDad, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dLeonard snubbed another cigarette and said, \u201cYour mother went to see Jordan Steele. She isn\u2019t home yet.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dTyler looked at the clock and realized that it was already 2:30 am. \u2018It\u2019s already the wee hours of the night, and she isn\u2019t back yet. What could she be doing at Jordan Steele\u2019s home!!?\u2019\u201cHave you called Mom to urge her to come home?\u201d Tyler asked.Leonard said, \u201cYes, but her phone is switched off.\u201d\u201cSwitched off\u2026 Why would Mom do that? Could something have happened to her? Dad, let\u2019s go look for her!\u201dTyler was about to change into his shoes.Leonard stopped him. \u201cBefore switching off her phone, your mother texted me and told me not to look for her.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dTyler\u2019s face turned pale, and he was so livid that he felt an urge to kill. He had already guessed what might happen between his mother and Jordan!Rosie left Jordan\u2019s villa at five in the morning.Leonard and Tyler had already waited for the entire night.Upon seeing Rosie, Tyler immediately ran towards her and asked, \u201cMom, why didn\u2019t you come back all night? Did that scoundrel Jordan Steele do anything to you!?!\u201dRosie rebuked furiously, \u201cEnough! Don\u2019t provoke Jordan Steele again! He\u2019s not someone you can afford to mess with!\u201d\u201cTyler, Jordan Steele has promised me that he won\u2019t harm you, so you can go out as per normal now. You don\u2019t have to rush to have a baby anymore.\u201dHearing this, Leonard\u2019s face turned beet red.He walked over and gave Rosie a hard slap on her face!Smack!\u201cWho gave you permission to do that!?! You\u2019re still my wife! You\u2019re a huge disgrace to me by doing so!\u201dLeonard hollered.Rosie said stubbornly, \u201cI can\u2019t stand by and do nothing while watching my son get hurt! Leonard, it\u2019s over for our business, and we will soon become poor. We\u2019ve long lost all our pride!\u201d\u201cNo! No! No!\u201dTyler yelled hysterically and said to Rosie, \u201cMom, Grandma is rich. The Huxleys are a top-tier family in New York, tell them to help me, and we\u2019ll definitely be able to kill that bastard Jordan Steele!\u201dRosie shook her head and said, \u201cSon, my family was dead against me marrying your father, and now that this has happened, they\u2019re not willing to help us at all. We\u2019d better resign to fate.\u201d\u201cNo, I won\u2019t resign myself to fate! If you don\u2019t want to beg them, I\u2019ll do it! Jordan Steele has caused the Collins to be reduced to a terrible plight and has even violated you! I must make him pay it back tenfold!\u201dTyler dashed out of the villa in his slippers\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He said calmly, \u201cOh, Rosie Huxley did spend the night at my place last night.\u201dThat was precisely what he wanted\u2014for rumors to spread in the company.Otherwise, his prestige as the president of the company would be significantly reduced.Even if those employees were respectful to him when they were around him, they would secretly mock him for being made a cuckold.Victoria was not a fool either, and she knew that it might just be a means of revenge for Jordan.Victoria nevertheless continued to ask, \u201cDid you and her\u2026\u201dJordan put down his pen and raised his head with a smile. \u201cNo, I just made her sing all night. I don\u2019t like older women.\u201dVictoria was happy to hear the first half of the sentence, but her smile gradually faded when she listened to the latter half.When Jordan saw the changes in Victoria\u2019s attitude, he finally realized that she was also older than him.Jordan hurriedly explained, \u201cVictoria, I wasn\u2019t referring to you, you\u2019re only 30 years old, and we\u2019re about the same age. 30-year-old women are my favorite.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Victoria was overjoyed. She was confident in her beauty and capabilities. The only thing she was worried about was that Jordan might think that she was too old for him.\u201cCan we have dinner together tonight? You\u2019re divorced, and Hailey Camden regrets her decision too. You\u2019ve also insulted Tyler and taken your revenge. Let\u2019s have some drinks to celebrate.\u201dVictoria asked Jordan.Jordan declined, \u201cI can\u2019t make it tonight. I have an appointment with Hailey.\u201dVictoria was puzzled. \u201cAre you still in love with her? Is it because you know that nothing happened between her and Tyler, so you don\u2019t mind anymore?\u201dVictoria was aware of all the rumors that had been going around lately.It was also rumored that Hailey did not actually sleep with Tyler.\u201cNo, what bothers me the most isn\u2019t Hailey\u2019s relationship with Tyler, but the drastic change in her attitude after she found out about my true identity!\u201d Jordan said.\u201cHowever, I did hide the truth from her for three years, so I want to do something to make up for it. I\u2019ll be introducing her to someone today.\u201dVictoria laughed after hearing his words. \u201cHahaha, are you going to set her up with someone?\u201dAfter Victoria learned the truth, she knew that Hailey would definitely hit the roof after finding out.\u2018Seems like Mr. Steele\u2019s revenge on Hailey Camden hasn\u2019t come to an end yet.\u2019\u2026At The Times restaurant at eight o\u2019clock in the evening.It was an elegant restaurant that had been famous for a long time. Jordan and Hailey used to patronize it frequently.They were famous for their duck confit and truffle pasta.Jordan had already booked a private room in the restaurant. Only Butler Frank and his grandson, Greyson Reyes, were present in the private room when he arrived. Hailey hadn\u2019t arrived yet.\u201cMr. Jordan.\u201d\u201cMr. Jordan.\u201dWhen Butler Frank saw Jordan entering, he stood up to greet him.His grandson, Greyson, was also highly respectful to Jordan. However, he couldn\u2019t stand up because he was a wheelchair user.At this moment, Hailey was seated in Rachel\u2019s car that was parked in the parking lot. She had actually arrived a long time ago.Hailey was very anxious. \u201cIt\u2019s eight o\u2019clock. It\u2019s time for me to go meet Jordan. Why aren\u2019t you letting me go inside?\u201dRachel said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? You used to make Jordan wait for half an hour whenever you went on dates with him.\u201dHailey was speechless. \u201cTimes have changed! Honey! He\u2019s now the president of Ace Corporation, and you expect him to wait for me for half an hour!?!\u201dRachel was even more speechless. \u201cIf I had let you arrive half an hour earlier to wait for him, it\u2019d be worse because he\u2019d find your behavior in the past to be outrageous. You used to bully him because he was your live-in husband. Are you going to treat him differently now that he\u2019s the president of a corporation?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only right for men to wait for women. You\u2019ll only be holding yourself cheap if you turn up earlier than the agreed time. It\u2019s fine to be late for a few minutes.\u201dHailey had no choice but to look into the mirror again.She had dolled herself up today and was confident that Jordan would like her outfit.Five minutes later, Rachel said to Hailey, \u201cIt\u2019s time to go in. Come on, girl, you must conquer Jordan! I\u2019m waiting to attend your wedding.\u201d\u201cOkay, don\u2019t worry!\u201dHailey confidently walked towards the private room that Jordan was in.As soon as she pushed open the door, her green floral dress attracted the attention of the three men in the private room.Her dress made her look pure and unstained.Coupled with Hailey\u2019s innocent beauty, she looked adorable.\u201cJordan!\u201dHailey called out meekly.The discovery that other people were in the room made her look even shier, like a young girl who was afraid of meeting strangers.Jordan smiled and said, \u201cHere you are. Let me introduce you. This is Butler Frank Reyes. He may be a butler, but he watched me grow up, and I have always treated him like family.\u201dHailey was flattered, and she thought, \u2018Jordan is really going to forgive me! He\u2019s even introducing me to the butler of the Steeles! Is he ready to marry me and make me the mistress of the family? Wow, that\u2019s splendid!\u201dHailey was extremely agitated, but she remained calm and well-mannered on the surface.Butler Fang took the initiative to introduce himself to Hailey. \u201cMiss Camden, nice to meet you. You\u2019re really stunning. I have never met anyone more beautiful than you in the seventy years of my life so far.\u201dWhen Hailey heard Butler Frank\u2019s compliment, she was even more confident that Jordan would take her back!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Abandoned Husband DominatesCH 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHailey was so excited that she had already treated herself as Jordan\u2019s wife.\u2018Since Butler Frank is Jordan\u2019s servant, that makes him my servant too.\u2019Hence, Hailey said, \u201cButler Frank\u2026\u201dJordan frowned. He thought that Hailey would address him respectfully as \u2018Mr. Reyes\u2019 but he didn\u2019t expect her to call him Butler Frank too.Jordan could do so because Butler Frank was his subordinate.However, Hailey had no right to do so!Not taking herself as an outsider at all, Hailey said, \u201cButler Frank, I\u2019m flattered. Since Jordan treats you like his family, I will do the same from now on, don\u2019t worry.\u201dJordan couldn\u2019t help but be amused by Hailey\u2019s words because she was acting like she was granting Butler Frank a boon.It was as if she was saying that she wouldn\u2019t treat him like a servant after becoming the household\u2019s mistress.\u201cThank you, thank you.\u201dButler Frank had always behaved humbly. Although he knew that Hailey was no longer Jordan\u2019s wife, he would never dare to be rude unless Jordan gave him permission.Jordan continued, \u201cThat\u2019s Butler Frank\u2019s grandson, Greyson Reyes. He\u2019s about the same age as us, but he has become a wheelchair user due to a leg injury.\u201dHailey took the initiative to walk over and shook Greyson\u2019s hand. \u201cHello, how did you get injured? Oh dear, you\u2019re so pitiful. You\u2019ve lost your mobility at such a young age.\u201dGreyson said, \u201cI got into an accident two years ago.\u201dHailey looked at him with a compassionate gaze. She said,\u201dI\u2019m sorry that happened to you, but be assured that Jordan and I will take care of you just as your grandfather has taken care of Jordan for so many years.\u201d.After saying that, she turned to Jordan and said, \u201cLet\u2019s give Greyson some money or take him to a good hospital. Maybe, there\u2019s a chance for him to recover completely.\u201dFor the first time, Jordan felt that Hailey was utterly senseless and ignorant.In the past, Hailey often called Jordan a hillbilly.Now, Jordan felt that Hailey was the hillbilly.Jordan explained to Hailey, \u201cButler Frank may be our butler, but he has a net worth of several billion. He doesn\u2019t need our money. He can easily afford to find Greyson the best doctor in the world.\u201dHailey was stunned for a moment.\u201cBill\u2026 billions?\u201dHailey began to stammer.She really didn\u2019t think that a butler would be able to become a billionaire!After running a business empire for so many years, the Camdens had only amassed hundreds of millions of dollars in assets.At their peak, even the Collins, whose company had been listed before, did not have billions in assets!When Hailey looked at Butler Frank again, she no longer dared to be condescending and see him as a servant.\u201cAre you\u2026 also the president of a company?\u201d Hailey asked respectfully.Still as humble as ever, Butler Frank answered politely, \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m just a servant. Mr. Jordan\u2019s grandfather taught me how to invest, and I would invest in all the stocks he invested in.\u201d\u201cLater on, when he started investing in real estate, I bought some too, and over time, I accumulated my wealth.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to the Steeles that I have the money I own now. Mr. Jordan\u2019s brothers, himself, and even his wife can take them away as they please.\u201dHailey was thrilled when she heard \u201chis wife\u201d because she thought he was referring to her.Hailey looked at Jordan in surprise. \u201cIf Butler Frank is already a billionaire, could your grandfather have tens of billions?\u201dBefore Jordan answered, Butler Frank burst into laughter and said, \u201cHaha, Miss Camden, Mr. Steele has more than just tens of billions.\u201d\u201cMore than tens of billions of dollars!?!\u201dHailey got extremely worked up, and she patted Jordan coquettishly. \u201cYou\u2019re so mean. You didn\u2019t even tell me how wealthy your grandfather is.\u201dButler Frank explained on Jordan\u2019s behalf, \u201cMiss Camden, don\u2019t hold it against Mr. Jordan. The test that he had been put through is stringent. If he had told you about it, he would have failed his test, and Mr. Steele would despise him for it.\u201dHailey suddenly became understanding. \u201cYes, Grandpa was doing it for Jordan\u2019s good. The majority of rich scions have been spoiled rotten and act lawlessly. They can\u2019t take any hardship at all. Grandpa\u2019s test for Jordan is a good thing.\u201dAfter saying that, Hailey suddenly gave Jordan a kiss on the cheek and said smilingly, \u201cI don\u2019t blame you anymore, Darling.\u201dJordan was helpless. If he had been prepared, he might have shunned so that Hailey wouldn\u2019t get her way.However, Jordan did not say anything in response and merely said, \u201cLet\u2019s sit down and dig in.\u201dSoon, the dishes were served one after another.Hailey was overjoyed. \u201cThese are my favorite dishes. Thank you, Jordan.\u201dJordan said with a smile, \u201cI told you I\u2019d be making it up to you today.\u201dHailey reached her hand out to hold Jordan\u2019s hand again. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. Actually, I was at fault too. Let\u2019s not try to make it up to each other anymore. We\u2019ll just get along well with each other from now on.\u201dJordan shrugged Hailey\u2019s hand away. He initially planned to talk about the matter after the meal. Still, he had no choice but to do it now because Hailey was seriously oblivious to what was really going on.Jordan said, \u201cHailey Camden, I think you\u2019ve gotten the wrong idea. I asked you out tonight because I\u2019ve set you up for a blind date.\u201d\u201cA blind date? What blind date?\u201d Hailey was puzzled.Jordan pointed to Greyson and said, \u201cGreyson is about the same age as you, and since he\u2019s the only heir, he will inherit all of the family\u2019s assets.\u201d\u201cI set you up with Greyson because I know you\u2019ve always dreamed of marrying a billionaire who can make your family a top-tier one in Orlando.\u201dHailey flew into a rage. \u201cWhat did you say? You\u2019re introducing me to a servant!?! That\u2019s a humiliation to me!\u201dJordan humphed coldly and barked, \u201cMiss Camden, please watch your words. They are my subordinates, not yours!\u201dButler Frank not only had billions of dollars worth in assets but had also financially supported many people like the big boss, Pablo, who worked for him.The Camdens ought to be subservient to Butler Frank!Hailey knocked over a glass of water when she was throwing a fit. Pointing at Greyson, she hollered at Jordan, \u201cYou want me to marry an invalid like him? You\u2019re just humiliating me!\u201dJordan replied calmly, \u201cIt\u2019s true that Greyson may not be able to satisfy certain needs of yours, but we\u2019ve been sleeping in separate rooms for the past three years, so you should be used to a marriage without a sex life.\u201d\u201cAlso, Hailey, you are indeed a ravishing beauty, but you\u2019re twice divorced now after all. Most scions would despise you, so I hope you\u2019ll consider this carefully and settle for Greyson!\u201dHailey was so exasperated that she picked up another glass of water and splashed it onto Jordan\u2019s face.\u201cI refuse to settle for him! I won\u2019t even think about it! Jordan Steele, you\u2019ve gone too far! I love you so much, yet you\u2019re pushing me to another man!\u201dAfter saying that, she left the private room in tears.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m too old and powerless. Greyson can\u2019t get up either.\u201dJordan took a piece of tissue paper and wiped his face with it. \u201cI\u2019m fine. The water was lukewarm. I already expected her to do that.\u201dThe reason Jordan intentionally provoked Hailey was to make it clear she wouldn\u2019t be able to get together with him again!After leaving The Times restaurant, Hailey called Rachel.Rachel had just driven away a short while ago, but she returned to the restaurant again to pick Hailey up and send her to Diana\u2019s place.When Hailey returned to Diana\u2019s villa, everyone asked her about how the date turned out.Hailey was still hopping mad, and she told them what had just happened.Feeling unjust for her daughter, Sylvie said, \u201cJordan has really gone too far. How can he set Hailey up with a cripple?\u201dHerman said with a derisive smile, \u201cI think Mr. Steele\u2019s arrangement is quite good. Butler Frank has only one grandson, so he will be inheriting billions of dollars worth of assets. Hailey, you might regret turning Mr. Steele down like this.\u201dDrew guffawed and chimed in, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re twice divorced, and you\u2019re still so choosy. I think Jordan made a reasonable arrangement.\u201dElle also seized this opportunity to mock Hailey. \u201cHailey, you\u2019d better give up on Jordan. He shouldn\u2019t have been married to you in the first place. I should be his wife!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough! Stop it!\u201dDiana frowned.In the past, the distribution of the family\u2019s assets and their roles in the business used to be a point of contention between Benedict and Herman.Now, their daughters were arguing and vying over Jordan.Diana looked at Elle and said, \u201cElle, you know I have always doted on you. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to let you get into a relationship with Jordan, but as you can see, Jordan has been giving you the cold shoulder both times he met you recently. He still sees you as a kid, and you definitely stand a smaller chance than Hailey.\u201dHailey was glad that Diana was speaking up for her.\u201cBut Grandma, since Jordan has tried to set me up with another man, does that mean he doesn\u2019t love me anymore?\u201d Hailey asked aggrievedly.Diana humphed coldly. \u201cHe\u2019s been in love with you for three years. How can he stop loving you just like that? Even if he doesn\u2019t love you anymore, he may lust over your body!\u201d\u201cBeing deprived of the chance to consummate a marriage of three years is a huge insult and regret for any man!\u201d\u201cThe last time you passed out while kneeling on the ground at his place, he secretly took liberties with you, and that\u2019s enough to show that he\u2019s still attracted to you!\u201dSylvie could catch what Diana meant. She asked, \u201cDo you mean we should create a chance for Hailey and Jordan to do the deed? That\u2019s a tall order. If it weren\u2019t for Lucky\u2019s injury, he wouldn\u2019t have been willing to come to our place the other day. If Hailey goes to see him again, he\u2019ll probably choose to turn her away.\u201dDiana nodded and said, \u201cJordan is indeed very ruthless, but it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t stand a chance at all.\u201d\u201cHailey, you still remember your grandaunt, don\u2019t you?\u201dHailey nodded, \u201cOf course I remember. Grandaunt Lily is so nice to me and Jordan. On the day that I went to the hotel with Tyler\u2026\u201dAt this point, Hailey paused for a moment as she felt extremely awkward. Still, she soon continued, \u201cIn the morning of that day, Jordan heard that Grandaunt Lily was severely ill and wanted to drive me to her place to see her.\u201dHailey\u2019s grandaunt was Lily, the younger sister of Hailey\u2019s grandfather. She had moved to a nearby city, South Daytona, after getting married.Diana said, \u201cI just received a call from Lily\u2019s son. He said that she\u2019s not going to make it past three days.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dEveryone was shocked and sad.After all, they were relatives, and Lily had always been kind to them.Sylvie said, \u201cOh, I know what Diana intends to do. She wants to invite Jordan to go to the funeral with us after Aunt Lily passes! Aunt Lily has always been nice to Jordan. He definitely wouldn\u2019t refuse!\u201dDiana glared at Sylvie and barked furiously, \u201cYou stupid woman! No wonder you guys couldn\u2019t make such a splendid son-in-law stay!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of asking him to attend her funeral together with us!?! Jordan has his own car and chauffeur. He knows where Lily lives too. He\u2019ll at most meet us once more during the funeral. What help is that going to do for Hailey\u2019s relationship with him!?!\u201dSylvie didn\u2019t dare to speak because she couldn\u2019t guess what Diana had in mind.Diana said, \u201cHailey, Lily is the only one of all our relatives who doesn\u2019t despise Jordan and has always treated him well.\u201d\u201cIn the past, I always thought it was because she was nice and treated everyone equally.\u201d\u201cHowever, in the past two days, I repeatedly recalled the things she had said to me during our previous meetings.\u201d\u201cI concluded that the reason she was so nice to Jordan was that your grandfather had told her the truth about Jordan\u2019s identity. She had long known that Jordan is a multi-billionaire!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAll the Camdens were flabbergasted!\u201cGrandaunt Lily knew about it all along? Why didn\u2019t she tell me?\u201dHailey was about to burst into tears.Elle was also on the verge of crying. She exclaimed agitatedly, \u201cGrandaunt Lily was aware of the truth? Why didn\u2019t she let Jordan marry me then? Grandaunt Lily is so biased!\u201dDiana was making wild guesses because Lily was too sick to speak to them over the phone, so there was no way to confirm it.However, everyone unanimously agreed with her conjecture!Drew said, \u201cI\u2019ve always been puzzled as to why Grandaunt Lily was always so nice to Jordan even though he was just a live-in husband of Hailey\u2019s. It turns out she was already aware of the truth a long time ago. Wait, that doesn\u2019t seem right. Didn\u2019t Jordan say that Grandpa wasn\u2019t allowed to inform the Camdens of the truth?\u201dDiana smiled and said, \u201cYour Grandaunt Lily had been married to her husband for decades and is no longer a Camden. So, it wasn\u2019t considered a violation of the rules by letting her know.\u201dHailey thought it made sense too. She asked, \u201cGrandma, what do you plan to do next?\u201dDiana said, \u201cSince Lily knows the truth, the last thing she would want to see before her death is Hailey and Jordan getting divorced.\u201d\u201cLily has been very nice to Jordan in the past three years, and I\u2019m sure he understands that.\u201d\u201cSo, we just have to tell Jordan to pretend that he and Hailey are still married in front of Lily.\u201d\u201cAfter all, Lily is on her deathbed. Jordan won\u2019t disagree.\u201dHailey also felt that Jordan would not refuse. Sometimes, she felt that Jordan was more attached to Lily as an elder than she was!\u201cBut, after we\u2019re done pretending to be married, he\u2019ll still abandon me all the same,\u201d Hailey said with some despondence.Diana said, \u201cAll of us will be going to South Daytona together this time, and we\u2019ll be staying there for a while. Since you two have to pretend to be married, you will definitely have to stay in the same room. When the time comes, you\u2019ll have to count on yourself to conquer Jordan!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Abandoned Husband DominatesCH 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn order to create an opportunity for Hailey and Jordan to reconcile their marriage, Diana took advantage of the fact that Lily was dying.The only uncertainty was whether Jordan would agree or not.After all, Jordan had already divorced Hailey and was no longer part of the family.He no longer had anything to do with the Camdens, let alone a distant relative like Grandaunt Lily.In this regard, Herman and his children didn\u2019t carry much hope.Hailey said, \u201cMom, I know you have good intentions. But Hailey, don\u2019t rejoice too soon. Jordan is so ruthless, he had the heart to leave you out in the rain for two hours without feeling anything, and he even tried to set you up with a disabled man. Hah, I doubt he\u2019d put up an act and pretend that you two are still married, just for your sake.\u201dHailey bit her lip, thinking to herself that Jordan might indeed be as heartless as before.However, she mustered up the courage to call Jordan and said with an eager and sad expression.Jordan was still having a meal with Butler Frank and Greyson at The Times when Hailey suddenly called.Seeing that Hailey was calling, Jordan wondered, \u2018Did she go home to think about it and regret her decision after realizing that Greyson is a good catch?\u2019In fact, Jordan still somewhat admired Hailey when she opposed Jordan\u2019s decision to matchmake her with Greyson and even splashed water onto his face in exasperation.That proved that she still had some pride and self-respect and that money wasn\u2019t the only thing she was after.Hailey was quite an outstanding woman herself, and Jordan would hate to see Hailey degrading herself for the sake of money.\u201cHello,\u201d Jordan answered the phone.\u201cJordan\u2026\u201dHailey said sobbingly, sounding exceedingly sorrowful.Jordana said, \u201cStop crying. I didn\u2019t take what happened just now to heart.\u201dHailey said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for splashing water onto your face just now.\u201d\u201cHowever, I\u2019m not calling you because of this matter. Grandaunt Lily is about to pass away soon.\u201d\u201cWhat? Your aunt\u2026\u201dJordan immediately panicked.Hailey said, \u201cJust now, Grandaunt Lily\u2019s son called us to say that she doesn\u2019t have much longer to live. She might pass tonight or tomorrow.\u201dIn the midst of his meal, Jordan put down his fork and knife and placed a hand on his forehead while letting out a long sigh.Hailey\u2019s grandfather had died before Jordan finished his three-year trial.Everyone was disdainful of Jordan.Grandaunt Lily had never looked down on Jordan and treated him as well as she treated Drew.Lily was one of the most kind-hearted old ladies Jordan had ever met.Most importantly, she was also Jordan\u2019s life-saving benefactor!Just over half a year ago, Jordan hadn\u2019t started working as a deliveryman yet and would be in charge of doing household chores for the Camdens every day.One day, one of Jordan\u2019s former war comrades came to Orlando to look for him. Jordan then had a meal with him.That night, Jordan felt very uncomfortable.They went to the hospital for a body checkup. It was discovered that he had developed a rare illness that the doctor had never seen before. In the end, he had to undergo surgery which cost tens of thousands of dollars.At that time, the Camdens had all gone on a trip to Switzerland. Jordan tried to call Hailey, but he couldn\u2019t reach her, so he tried to call Sylvie and Benedict to borrow money.When they heard that he needed tens of thousands of dollars, they turned him down immediately. They even accused Jordan of pretending to be sick.At that time, Jordan couldn\u2019t bear the pain any longer and desperately needed money for the surgery.However, the Camdens refused to give him any money, and he couldn\u2019t call the Steeles either because that would mean that he had failed the test.He was already two-and-a-half years into his test, and he didn\u2019t want all his efforts to go down the drain.Six family members were of the same generation as Jordan, and the competition was very stiff, so he didn\u2019t want to fail either.Hence, Jordan decided to try his luck and called Grandaunt Lily.He remembered Lily to be a caring and kind person who often looked after him.When he just got married to Hailey as a live-in husband, he had just returned from the battlefield. At that time, he would get nightmares every night and feel ill at ease throughout the day.Seeing how unwell Jordan seemed to be, Lily asked him about his condition and gave him a home remedy that immensely helped his situation.Jordan felt much better afterward.Thus, Jordan called Lily, who then transferred $50,000 to his bank account without any hesitation.She also told Jordan that he didn\u2019t have to inform the Camdens about it nor return the money to her.Jordan thus managed to pay for the surgery that saved his life.After that incident, Jordan decided to become a takeout deliveryman to be financially independent of the Camdens!On the morning of the day that Hailey and Tyler got a room at the hotel, Jordan was told that Lily had fallen seriously ill. He then suggested to Hailey that they travel to South Daytona in the afternoon to visit Lily together.However, Hailey turned him down with the excuse that she is meeting a client in the afternoon.Later on, he found out that the client Hailey was meeting was Tyler, with whom she checked into a hotel.\u201cIt\u2019s been more than a month. If Grandaunt Lily had fallen seriously ill more than a month ago, she should really be on her deathbed now.\u201dJordan didn\u2019t feel that Hailey was lying, and she couldn\u2019t possibly lie about her grandaunt\u2019s life anyway.Hailey continued, \u201cJordan, I know we haven\u2019t been nice to you, but Grandaunt Lily is the kindest person in the world. She has never mocked you before, and she always cooked for you and gave you presents. Can you come with us to South Daytona and see her for the last time on the account that we had been married for three years?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dDisappointed to hear Jordan\u2019s answer, Hailey said, \u201cOkay, just take it that I never asked.\u201dTo her surprise, Jordan continued, \u201cI won\u2019t go for your sake, but I will go on the account that she has always been kind to me.\u201dHailey asked with joy and surprise, \u201cAre you really willing to go?\u201dJordan said, \u201cI still owe her $50,000, and she saved my life when you and your entire family were enjoying your vacation in Switzerland.\u201dOnly then did Hailey remember that incident and realize why Jordan decided to be a takeout deliveryman.She couldn\u2019t help but blame her mother again. If her mother had lent Jordan money at that time, he wouldn\u2019t have become a takeout deliveryman.Jordan wouldn\u2019t have run into her and Tyler in the hotel room, and, thus, wouldn\u2019t have known about their affair.She would now still be the wife of the president of Ace Corporation!\u2018Mom has ruined my future for the sake of saving a mere $50,000!\u2019Despite resenting her mother, she didn\u2019t dare to say it out loud.Hailey continued, \u201cJordan, you know that Grandaunt Lily has always supported our marriage. If she finds out that we\u2019ve gotten a divorce, she definitely won\u2019t be able to die in peace! She might even pass as soon as we tell her about it!\u201dJordan asked, \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201dHailey said, \u201cI mean, can we pretend to still be married and act the same way we used to in front of Grandaunt Lily?\u201dJordan laughed and said, \u201cThe same as we used to? Never hold hands regardless of the occasion? Berate me for an entire day if I touch your thigh? Sleep in separate rooms? Sure! I can totally do that!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not like the way we used to be! We have to be very affectionate with each other!\u201dHailey burst into tears, knowing that she had said something wrong that reminded Jordan of how she had mistreated him in the past.Jordan laughed and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need for that. We can just tell her that we\u2019re not divorced.\u201dJordan was definitely in approval of the suggestion that they pretend to still be married. In fact, he might have suggested it even if she didn\u2019t.The reason being Lily had always hoped for them to remain happily married for the rest of their lives. Now that she was on her deathbed, she would definitely die miserably if she learned that they had divorced.After all, Lily was Jordan\u2019s life-saving benefactor, so he definitely couldn\u2019t bear to let her die in sadness.Hailey explained, \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a need for that! Grandma said that Grandaunt Lily had learned of your identity a long time ago and is also aware of the deal between the Steeles and the Camdens.\u201d\u201cNow, the three-year period is up, and you\u2019ve already told me about your identity. If we\u2019re still not divorced, I definitely won\u2019t treat you the same way I used to in the past. We must be very affectionate with each other!\u201dJordan was shocked. \u201cGrandaunt Lily is aware of my identity too?\u201dAfter thinking about it, he believed that Diana\u2019s guess made sense.As a live-in husband, he had to face the mockery of everyone, but Grandaunt Lily was particularly friendly to him.\u2018Perhaps, Grandaunt Lily also knows about the truth like her brother does!\u2019Jordan let out a long sigh. No matter what, Grandaunt Lily was a kind person who was nice to everyone and not just Jordan.Even if she was really nice to Jordan only because she knew his identity, he still had to repay her for his kindness.Jordan paused for a moment and said, \u201cOkay, I agree. You can do whatever you want then.\u201dSince old Lily was about to die, Jordan had no choice but to put on an act.\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Hailey was overjoyed. \u201cJor\u2026 Hubby, from now on, I will call you Hubby, lest Grandaunt Lily suspects something if she hears me call you by your name instead.\u201dJordan answered coldly, \u201cDo whatever you want.\u201dIt was all just to pretend anyway. Even if Hailey called him \u2018Hubby\u2019 he wouldn\u2019t treat Hailey as his wife again!Hailey said softly, \u201cHubby, when will you be free? Grandma said that it\u2019ll be best if we set off in the morning to arrive early. Otherwise, we won\u2019t make it in time to see Grandaunt Lily for the last time!\u201dJordan didn\u2019t have anything important on his schedule either. He wanted to thank her for the favor she had done him previously. Hence, he said, \u201cWe can set off immediately.\u201dIt was now 8:46 PM, and it would take more than an hour to get to South Daytona. If they set off now, they would make it in time to sleep there for the night.Hailey was overjoyed. \u201cOkay, well, since we\u2019re not divorced, I have to ride in your Maybach to show off. and to make sure that Grandaunt Lily doesn\u2019t suspect anything.\u201dHailey was bent on riding in Jordan\u2019s Maybach.Jordan did not decline either. \u201cAlright.\u201dHailey continued, \u201cThank you, Hubby! Also, does Butler Frank have a Rolls Royce? Grandma said she wants to travel in that one.\u201dJordan thought to himself, \u2018The Camdens are really so vain and materialistic. Now that they\u2019re going to see a relative who\u2019s on her deathbed, they still have to put on such a pompous front.\u2019However, those were just trivial matters, so Jordan agreed to it right away.\u201cGet ready and wait for me at your grandmother\u2019s villa. We\u2019ll head there now.\u201dAfter hanging up the phone, Jordan looked at Butler Frank and said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to borrow your car for two days.\u201dFearing that Jordan might get thirsty from talking over the phone, Butler Frank filled his glass with water and said respectfully, \u201cPlease don\u2019t say that, Mr. Jordan, my car is yours too. Do you need me to send someone to drive the car to the Camdens\u2019 villa?\u201dJordan nodded, took a sip of water, and asked, \u201cButler Frank, do you know who Hailey\u2019s grandfather\u2019s younger sister is? Has she known about my identity all this while?\u201dButler Frank was the one accompanying Jordan\u2019s grandfather to discuss the matter of Jordan\u2019s marriage three years ago. Hence, he was aware of all the details.Butler Frank shook his head and said, \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be aware of it. If she does, it must be because Hailey\u2019s grandfather told her about it.\u201dJordan lit a cigarette and said with a puzzled look, \u201cAccording to what I know, Hailey\u2019s grandfather and grandmother are very close, and both treat each other\u2019s children as their own.\u201d\u201cSince Grandaunt Lily is aware of my identity, she definitely won\u2019t stand by and watch Hailey divorce me, a tycoon.\u201d\u201cHowever, she not only watched Hailey and I get a divorce without intervening, but she also didn\u2019t stop Hailey from marrying Tyler Collins either.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense at all! Isn\u2019t it a little too strange? Unless Hailey isn\u2019t related to the Camdens by blood, why didn\u2019t Grandaunt Lily stop Hailey from digging her own grave?\u201dButler Frank found it strange too. Greyson asked, \u201cCould it be because Lily is very ill and doesn\u2019t know about your divorce?\u201dJordan said, \u201cI hope so, but something tells me that things aren\u2019t that simple.\u201dJordan still did not know the specific condition of Lily\u2019s health. Despite finding out about the divorce, her family members wouldn\u2019t have told her about it if she became seriously ill more than a month ago.That meant that she still didn\u2019t know.\u2018Even if she doesn\u2019t know, an intelligent person such as her should have already prepared everything in advance or given instructions to those near her about what to do in case she passes.\u2019Jordan was getting a headache from thinking about the matter and thus stopped dwelling on it. He stood up and drove to the villa.He found the Camdens prepared and waiting at the villa gate when he arrived. Hailey, who had brought only a backpack with her, opened the door of Jordan\u2019s car and got inside.Elle, who was far away, stomped her feet with indignation. She obviously also wanted to ride in the Maybach.However, both Elle and Diana got into the Rolls-Royce that belonged to Butler Frank.Without further ado, both the Maybach and Rolls-Royce and Herman\u2019s Audi Q7 immediately set off for South Daytona.Hailey was overjoyed to be inside the Maybach again. Previously, she had only sat in it for two minutes and didn\u2019t get to experience the thrill of it!She took a bottle of champagne out of her backpack and said, \u201cHoney, let me pour you a glass!\u201dThe last time she was in the Maybach, Hailey had already wanted to enjoy the feeling of sipping on some champagne in the spacious backseat.Unfortunately, Jordan didn\u2019t pour her any champagne.This time, Hailey brought a bottle of champagne herself.Jordan looked at Hailey and asked, \u201cChampagne? To celebrate Grandaunt Lily\u2019s death?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Abandoned Husband DominatesCH 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHailey was at a loss for words, finally realizing that it seemed inappropriate to drink Champagne on such an occasion.Champagne was usually drunk during celebratory events like weddings or when one\u2019s favorite sports team has won a championship.Who would pop champagne when a relative is on her deathbed?Hailey silently put away the champagne and said, \u201cHubby, can I connect my cell phone to the Bluetooth speaker of the car? I want to play a song in my playlist.\u201dHailey and Jordan had slightly different tastes in music. The trip this time would take close to two hours, and it\u2019d be agonizing for her if they kept playing songs she disliked.Jordan would never force others to listen to the songs he liked. Hence, he allowed Hailey to connect her phone to the Bluetooth player and play her preferred songs.To his surprise, the first song that Hailey played after connecting her phone to the Bluetooth player of the car was \u2018A Thousand Reasons to be Sad\u2019!The familiar piano prelude instantly reminded both of them of the concert the other day.Hailey took the initiative to hold Jordan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cHubby, you know what? I was mesmerized by you when you went up on stage to perform this song on the piano while singing along at the concert the other day. Not only did you hide your identity from me, you even kept it from me that you could play the piano. Why did you do that?\u201d\u201cIf I knew you played the piano so well, I would love you even more!\u201dJordan didn\u2019t push Hailey\u2019s hand away. After all, her hand was quite comfortable to touch. Besides, she was the one who had held his hand first, not the other way around. Hence, it didn\u2019t mean that he wanted to get back together with her.Jordan said, \u201cSo what if you\u2019d love me more? It\u2019s just some piano-playing skills. They\u2019re not going to help you increase the status of your family. You would have still gotten into an affair with Tyler.\u201d\u201cHailey, since I caught you and Tyler in the hotel room, I\u2019ve already lost all feelings for you!\u201dThe car was traveling at a speed of 60km/h. The roof and windows in the back were all tightly closed, and their conversation could not be heard or seen from the front.Hailey continued to hold his hand. \u201cIf you lost all feelings for me, why did you tear up?\u201dJordan was instantly shocked because he knew that Hailey was referring to the fact that he had teared up because of her at the concert and a song called \u2018If You Don\u2019t Have Anymore Feelings\u2019.Jordan looked at Hailey in surprise and said, \u201cI\u2019ve only played that song once. How did you\u2026\u201dJordan and Hailey had been married for three years. If it was a song that Jordan often played, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for her to know about it.However, Jordan remembered that he had only played that song once.Hailey took out her cell phone and opened the Spotify app. She then showed Jordan the list of \u201cliked songs\u201d.\u201cI\u2019ve downloaded all the songs that you listened to in the past three years. Suppose I\u2019m a materialistic and promiscuous woman who doesn\u2019t love you and despises you because of your family background. Why would I have done that!?!\u201dJordan looked at Hailey\u2019s cell phone screen in astonishment.\u2018If You Don\u2019t Have Anymore Feelings\u2019, \u2018Perfect Summer\u2019, \u2018The Scientist\u2019\u2026They were all of Jordan\u2019s favorite songs.At this moment, Hailey lay in Jordan\u2019s arms and pleaded, \u201cHubby, I know I\u2019ve hurt you. You can beat and scold me all you want but don\u2019t give me the cold shoulder or leave me.\u201dMusic really has the ability to affect a person\u2019s mood.Listening to the song \u2018A Thousand Reasons To Be Sad\u2019, Jordan recalled the night when Tyler proposed to Hailey. At that time, he wished that he could go forward, tell Hailey the truth and forgive her!He knew that he still loved her and did not want her to marry another man at all.Now that Hailey was lying in his arms, Jordan didn\u2019t push her away.1\u2018Since we\u2019re pretending to still be married, I\u2019ll just take it that this is an act!\u2019The chauffeur wasn\u2019t driving at a fast speed. The car was traveling at only about 110-120 km/h on the expressway.They arrived at Lily\u2019s home at 11:30 pm.She was married into the Blaine family, which was considered quite a wealthy family in South Daytona. However, they were several notches below the Camdens.Thus, when the Blaines learned that the Camdens were coming, they waited at the entrance to welcome them.Jordan, Hailey, Diana, and the others alighted from their respective cars almost simultaneously.However, Lily\u2019s eldest son, Devon, was the first to approach Jordan.He took the initiative to extend his hands and said, \u201cMr. Steele, it\u2019s very thoughtful of you to come here.\u201dJordan was a little surprised. Even if he and Hailey were still married, he should still be known as a live-in husband.Logically speaking, Devon should have greeted Diana first.Jordan decided to be polite to Devon on Lily\u2019s account. \u201cIt\u2019s only right for me to do so. Grandaunt Lily has always been so nice to Hailey and me. How is she now?\u201dDevon shook his head and sighed.It seemed that she was really about to kick the bucket.Jordan asked, \u201cYou should know Hailey and I are divorced, right?\u201dJordan guessed that since Devon was aware that he was the president of the Ace Corporation, he should also know about his divorce from Hailey.After all, what happened between them had become a hot topic in Orlando\u2019s business circles.The news had spread to South Daytona, which wasn\u2019t far from Orlando.Devon nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019m the only one in my family who knows. Neither my siblings nor my mother are aware.\u201d\u201cSo, when you see my mother later, I hope you won\u2019t mention the divorce and just behave affectionately with Hailey later. I hope she won\u2019t hear such bad news before she passes.\u201dLily naturally knew about it a long time ago. Still, Devon decided to play along with the plan because he knew that Hailey and Jordan would pretend to still be married to lie to Lily.Later, he would also arrange for Jordan and Hailey to stay in the same room!Jordan assured, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t say anything.\u201dAfter a brief greeting, Jordan and the others proceeded to go see Lily without further ado.Lily had been hospitalized for a long time, and the Blaines decided to give up on treatment and take her home instead.Jordan felt his heart wrench up in misery when he saw Lily lying quietly in bed, waiting for her life to come to an end.Hailey was tearing up incessantly in Jordan\u2019s arms.Perhaps because of the sounds of Hailey\u2019s sobbing, Lily slowly opened her eyes and said feebly, \u201cIs Hailey here?\u201dHailey immediately knelt in front of the bed and held her hand. \u201cYes, Grandaunt Lily, Jordan, and I are here to see you!\u201d\u201cJordan\u2026 Jordan Steele?\u201dHearing Jordan\u2019s name, Grandaunt Lily immediately perked up. She turned to look at Jordan as if she was experiencing terminal lucidity before her death.\u201cGrandaunt Lily.\u201dJordan also hurriedly walked to the bed and held her hand.Lily grinned elatedly. Seeing how haggard she was, Jordan felt distressed.\u201cJordan, I never thought I would get to see you again before I die.\u201dFeeling melancholic, Jordan comforted, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. I will hire the best doctor in the world to cure you.\u201dLily patted Jordan\u2019s hand happily and asked, \u201cJordan, Hailey, how are you two doing?\u201dAs the only Camden who was aware of the secret, her greatest, final wish before her death was to see Hailey securing her marriage to the ultra-rich scion, Jordan.Hailey held Jordan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cGrandaunt Lily, we\u2019re doing well, and we\u2019ve been planning to have a baby recently!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jordan doesn\u2019t come from an ordinary family but a prestigious one! They are worth hundreds of billions! He\u2019s now the president of a corporation too!\u201dAt this point, Jordan stared at Lily\u2019s facial expression in a bid to see if she would be shocked.Lily smiled even more radiantly, but she didn\u2019t seem particularly shocked.Instead, she said repeatedly, \u201cGreat! Great! That\u2019s wonderful!\u201dLily said, \u201cMy children are all doing well\u2026 Ahem\u2026 The only one I\u2019ve been worried about\u2026\u201dLily coughed a few times and drank some water before continuing to speak.\u201cHailey has been worrying me the most. You must get along well with Jordan, or else\u2026 I won\u2019t be able to face my brother when I meet him in heaven\u2026\u201dAlthough Lily didn\u2019t reveal that she had long known about Jordan\u2019s identity, Jordan could vaguely sense that she was aware of the truth.They stopped talking to Lily because it was difficult for her to speak.In fact, it was good enough that they could meet one last time before she passed.It was already late at night. When they left Lily\u2019s room, Devon asked, \u201cMr. Steele, Hailey, are you two going to stay here or at a hotel? I\u2019ve arranged a room for you in both places.\u201dLily lived in a large bungalow with several guest houses.Jordan pointed in the direction of Lily\u2019s room and asked, \u201cWhat did the doctor say?\u201dDevon said with a sad expression, \u201cShe might go tonight or tomorrow.\u201dMany elderly people would pass away at midnight. Since Jordan was already there, it would be pointless to stay in a hotel.\u201cWe\u2019ll impose on you guys for a night,\u201d Jordan said.Devon said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t say that, Mr. Steele. It\u2019s our honor that you\u2019re willing to stay here. Please come with me. I\u2019ll show you to your room.\u201dThey walked out of the room and walked across the lawn to go to the other side where the guest rooms were.The buildings around them were elegant and pleasing to the eye with light-colored walls and tiles.When they arrived in the guest room, Jordan found that he liked the decor of it.Devon said, \u201cMy mom is very frugal, and she doesn\u2019t like trendy, high-tech things. Mr. Steele, Hailey, I hope you won\u2019t mind the simple furnishings of the room.\u201dHailey said, \u201cUncle Devon, you\u2019re too kind. Why would we mind it?\u201dJordan said, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re too polite. I should be feeling sorry for imposing on you by staying here as an outsider.\u201d\u201cUm, is this the only room available?\u201dIt was already 12 midnight, and Jordan was indeed a little sleepy. However, he couldn\u2019t guarantee what might happen if he spent the night in the same room as Hailey.After all, Hailey was a gorgeous woman who had an excellent figure too. Jordan, who has been married to her for three years and in love with her, had always wanted to get intimate with her.It was common for divorced couples to sleep with each other again after meeting each other frequently due to their children or other reasons.Devon said awkwardly, \u201cWe have quite a few visitors this time, so all the other rooms are occupied. This is the only vacant one left, my apologies.\u201dHailey hurriedly said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Uncle Devon, go ahead and carry on with what you have to do. We\u2019ll just sit here and get some rest.\u201d\u201cAlright, get some rest. I\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201dJordan waved him goodbye and said, \u201cIf anything happens to Grandaunt Lily, please inform us.\u201d\u201cI will!\u201dAfter Devon left, Jordan picked up a pillow from under the bed and took out a large, furry carpet from the cupboard, which he laid on the ground.\u201cJordan, what are you doing?\u201dHailey asked.Jordan said, \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep on the ground tonight. Haven\u2019t I been sleeping on the ground whenever we had to share a room in the past?\u201dIn the past three years, Jordan and Hailey would occasionally go on a vacation together. However, Hailey would never take him along if she was going overseas.If it was a road trip within the country, Hailey would bring Jordan along to be in charge of driving.Hailey wouldn\u2019t opt for standard rooms whenever they stayed in hotels because she felt that the beds were too small. Besides, it would be strange for a married couple to check into a standard single room and even more bizarre if they booked two rooms.They would usually book a deluxe room with a large queen-sized bed which Hailey would sleep on while Jordan slept on the ground.The skillful way that Jordan was laying the carpet on the ground made Hailey feel some heartache.Hailey sat on the carpet and said, \u201cJordan, don\u2019t sleep on the floor tonight. Do you still not trust me?\u201dDuring the two-hour journey just now, Hailey had been playing Jordan\u2019s favorite songs in the car.Hailey was not only aware of Jordan\u2019s favorite songs. She could also name each and every type of food he liked.Jordan was touched.It proved that he hadn\u2019t loved Hailey one-sidedly in the past three years and that she fancied him too.She just never expressed her feelings for him.Hailey kept telling Jordan that she was innocent, and Rosie swore that Hailey and Tyler hadn\u2019t done the deed.At this point, Jordan began to wonder if it was true that Hailey really hadn\u2019t slept with Tyler.Jordan said, \u201cEven if you and Tyler Collins didn\u2019t get the chance to do the deed in the hotel the other day, you must have at least kissed each other, right? You must have addressed each other affectionately and exchanged lots of sweet nothings, haven\u2019t you?\u201dHailey frantically answered, \u201cNo! We never kissed! The furthest we\u2019ve gone is holding hands! You can look at our wedding photos, none of them are of us kissing each other. The photographer kept urging us to take some shots of us kissing, but I refused!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never called him Hubby either! He kept asking me to, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it because I kept thinking about you! You\u2019re the only one I can say that to\u2026\u201d\u201cHubby, do you know how much I love you? Do you know how much pain I was in during that period?\u201dAs Hailey spoke, she had already begun tearing up.Jordan had seen their wedding photos, and there indeed wasn\u2019t any shot of them kissing.All of a sudden, Jordan began to wonder if Hailey really loved him that much.\u2018Otherwise, why hasn\u2019t she kissed Tyler yet?\u2019Jordan took out a piece of tissue paper and wiped Hailey\u2019s tears with it. \u201cHailey, it\u2019s too late to say this now.\u201d\u201cIf you had explained everything to me clearly and apologized to me the night I ran into you, perhaps, I wouldn\u2019t have been so insistent on getting a divorce.\u201d\u201cHowever, you were so self-righteous and even made me kneel down and beg you on the day of your grandmother\u2019s birthday banquet. How can I not be mad at you?\u201dHailey pleaded tearfully, \u201cI know I was wrong. Hubby, please give me another chance, okay?\u201dJordan sighed. \u2018Once a cheater, always a cheater, they say.\u20191Even if Hailey still loved Jordan, there was no way he could guarantee that she wouldn\u2019t be unfaithful to him again!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The two elderly ladies, whose ages added up to almost 200 years old, spoke very softly.Diana held Lily\u2019s hand and said with a sorrowful expression, \u201cLily, since you knew of Jordan\u2019s identity long ago, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201dLily said, \u201cDiana, my brother\u2026 instructed me not to tell you guys about this\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201dDiana sighed and said, \u201cLily, I\u2019ll tell you the truth, but you have to hang in there.\u201dLily\u2019s life was now in critical danger, and she could barely open her eyes, so she definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to take the blow.If Diana told her the truth, she would very likely kick the bucket.However, Diana still wanted to tell her the truth because she had been blaming Lily for hiding the truth from her. Otherwise, the Camdens wouldn\u2019t have let go of such a wealthy son-in-law like Jordan.Diana said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth, Hailey cheated on Jordan, and the two of them have gotten a divorce!\u201dAfter saying that, Diana was worried that her words might cause Lily to die of agitation.However, to Diana\u2019s surprise, Lily didn\u2019t have much reaction because she had already learned of the divorce a long time ago.Diana continued sorrowfully, \u201cThat\u2019s not all. After divorcing Jordan, Hailey married the man she cheated on Jordan with but now, she has divorced that man too! She\u2019s now a twice-divorced woman!\u201d\u201cSome people say that the value of a woman decreases with each divorce she gets. No matter how pretty Hailey may be, I\u2019m afraid no rich scion would want to marry her in the future.\u201dDiana was already in tears, but Lily still didn\u2019t react at all.Lily even comforted Diana instead. \u201cDiana, don\u2019t be too upset\u2026\u201dDiana was dumbfounded. \u2018How can a dying person be able to take such a huge emotional blow?\u2019Lily even smiled, which made Diana panic!Lily said smilingly, \u201cDiana, it\u2019s alright, Hailey and Jordan\u2026 can\u2019t get a divorce.\u201dDiana asked with bewilderment, \u201cWhat do you mean? Why can\u2019t they get a divorce? I\u2019ve already seen the divorce papers. They signed it at the lawyer\u2019s office. How can it be fake!?!\u201dLily nodded and said, \u201cYes, the divorce wasn\u2019t valid.\u201dDiana asked in shock, \u201cCould it be\u2026\u201dAt this moment, she could already vaguely guess the truth.Lily said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you know how careful my brother is. Before he left, he didn\u2019t\u2026 tell you the truth. He\u2026 he had already made arrangements before he passed.\u201dSeeing how difficult it was for Lily to speak, Diana decided to voice the conjecture she had in mind.\u201cLily, did your brother guess that Hailey and Jordan would get a divorce a long time ago? So he arranged for the lawyers to nullify Hailey\u2019s and Jordan\u2019s divorce papers\u2026 is that so?\u201dLily nodded and said, \u201cYes, all the staff and lawyers working at the firm that Hailey went to have all been given instructions by my brother. It can\u2019t be wrong.\u201dDiana was overjoyed. She hurriedly walked out of the room and yelled Benedict\u2019s name.Benedict was smoking outside the house. When he heard Diana\u2019s call, he hurriedly snubbed his cigarette and walked over.When the Blaines heard Lily\u2019s call, they quickly ran over because they thought Diana had passed.\u201cBenedict, send someone to check Hailey\u2019s current marital status! Find out if her legal spouse is still Jordan!\u201dDiana said with a look of excitement.Benedict said, \u201cMom, are you muddled up? She\u2019s even divorced from Tyler. How can her spouse be Jordan?\u201dDiana immediately slapped him and rebuked, \u201cGood-for-nothing, just check on it!\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dBenedict immediately took out his cell phone to check using the Internet since almost everything was available on the Internet these days.However, he realized that he could only get Hailey\u2019s official marriage record from the City Clerk office.Hence, he had no choice but to call a friend and ask his friend to contact someone who worked in the City Clerk office.After a full half an hour, Benedict received a call.\u201cI found it, Benedict. It states here that Hailey Camden is married to a spouse named Jordan Steele.\u201dBenedict was dumbfounded after hearing that!\u2018How could this happen!\u2019Seeing how shocked Benedict was, Diana hurriedly asked, \u201cHow is it? Have you found the record yet?\u201dBenedict nodded and said, \u201cYes, it\u2019s stated on the record that Hailey is still married!\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s the spouse? Tell me quickly!\u201d Diana was extremely eager.Benedict said, \u201cJordan\u2026\u201dDiana looked up and exclaimed in exhilaration, \u201cHaha, old man! You had great foresight! You\u2019ve saved the Camdens!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s the matter?\u201dSylvie was startled by Diana\u2019s voice and walked over as well.After Benedict told Sylvie what had just happened, Sylvie also yelled hysterically in the courtyard.Diana said excitedly, \u201cQuickly, get Jordan and Hailey to come to Lily\u2019s room.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSylvie dashed to Hailey and Jordan\u2019s room and pulled them up without hesitation. She then dragged them to Lily\u2019s room.Jordan and Hailey thought that Lily had kicked the bucket, so they complied, but they were confused about why Sylvie was smiling.\u2018Shouldn\u2019t she be sad about Grandaunt Lily\u2019s passing?\u2019When they reached Lily\u2019s room, they realized that she was still alive.Diana said gleefully, \u201cJordan, Hailey, you two are not divorced yet. The divorce papers you signed weren\u2019t valid at all. They were actually void.\u201d\u201cSimilarly, Hailey and Tyler\u2019s marriage certificate was fake too. There are no records in the public registry.\u201dHailey couldn\u2019t believe it at all. \u201cIs that true? Grandma, does that mean that Jordan and I\u2026 are still legally married?\u201dAll she wanted was to remarry Jordan!It turned out she didn\u2019t have to do anything at all!Jordan was dumbfounded too!Before he arrived, he had a vague sense that something was wrong, but he thought that since Lily knew the truth, it was impossible that she would do nothing about their divorce.It turned out that they had already planted snitches in the lawyer\u2019s office!Jordan nonetheless called Butler Frank to further confirm the truth. \u201cButler Frank, please check my marriage status on the public records.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With his power and status, he could easily find out the truth.Benedict and Sylvie were anxious and afraid that the information they found out from Benedict\u2019s friend would be fake.\u201cGod bless us, may the information that Benedict found out be true!\u201dSylvie prayed incessantly.Buzz\u2026Jordan\u2019s Porsche design cell phone began to ring, and everyone held their breaths!Jordan glanced at the phone screen, only to realize that it wasn\u2019t a call from Butler Frank but a number he didn\u2019t recognize.\u201cHello,\u201d Jordan answered the phone.The caller said, \u201cHello, Mr. Jordan Steele, I\u2019m the director of the City of Orlando City Clerk\u2019s Office. My name is David Jay.\u201d\u201cHello, Mr. Jay,\u201d Jordan greeted politely.In response, David said, \u201cI regret to inform you that your previous divorce with Miss Hailey Camden wasn\u2019t recorded in the public marriage records system, and the divorce papers that you signed are invalid because they have not been filed officially.\u201d\u201cTherefore, you and Miss Hailey Camden are still legally married.\u201d\u201cLikewise, the marriage certificate that Miss Hailey Camden and Mr. Tyler Collins have received is also invalid, just like their divorce papers.\u201d\u201cMr. Steele, we have identified the employee who handled your divorce application, and she is now suspended. I will make her give you a detailed explanation and an apology tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cMr. Steele and Miss Camden, if you\u2019d like to file for divorce again, I can process it for you personally. I guarantee the same mistake won\u2019t happen again.\u201dJordan said indifferently, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you about the divorce when I have the chance another day.\u201dJordan felt that Hailey definitely wouldn\u2019t be willing to divorce him now.After hanging up, Hailey asked anxiously, \u201cJordan, what\u2019s the outcome?\u201dJordan said, \u201cWe are still legally married, and the divorce papers that we signed, as well as the certificate of your marriage to Tyler, are all null and void.\u201d.\u201cYay!\u201d Hailey leaped up excitedly in Lily\u2019s room.All the Camdens except Elle were on cloud nine and had completely forgotten that there was an old lady on her deathbed right beside them.\u201cJordan\u2026\u201dAt this moment, Lily called out to Jordan softly.Jordan walked over while Lily held his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 my brother\u2026\u201dJordan smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Grandaunt Lily. I really admire Hailey\u2019s grandfather for knowing ahead of time that the Camdens would definitely make me divorce Hailey because they\u2019re a bunch of mercenary snobs. That\u2019s why he made those arrangements.\u201dJordan was definitely furious for having been deceived.However, now that Lily was dying, Jordan couldn\u2019t say anything too harsh in front of her. Hence, he could only take the opportunity to make a sarcastic remark and take a jab at the Camdens.Lily said, \u201cI don\u2019t have much time left\u2026 I\u2019ll be joining my brother soon\u2026 Before I pass, I\u2019d like to make a request to you\u2026\u201dJordan was a little melancholic because he discovered that it was getting harder and harder for Lily to breathe.\u201cPlease.\u201dLily breathed slowly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 divorce Hailey.\u201d1Jordan was stunned!He didn\u2019t expect that to be Lily\u2019s last wish!At this moment, Hailey immediately got on her knees in front of Jordan, her eyes full of tears.\u201cHubby, please give me another chance. I\u2019ll definitely love you well, I promise, I will never get involved with another man again!\u201dSylvie also pleaded, \u201cJordan, look how beautiful Hailey is. Besides, she\u2019s still a virgin, and she\u2019s been married to you for three years. Can you bear to see such a beautiful wife of yours marrying someone else?\u201dBecause Sylvie understood the selfish nature of men, she said those words in order to make Jordan think that he would be shortchanging himself if he didn\u2019t get back together with Hailey.Feeling extremely complicated, Jordan insisted, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grandaunt Lily, I can agree to anything except this!\u201dThe Camdens\u2019 hearts immediately sank.On the other hand, Lily got up from the bed and seemed to get down after seeing that Jordan was insistent on divorcing Hailey.\u201cMom, what are you doing?\u201d Devon, who was at the door, also quickly walked over.Lily said, \u201cHelp me\u2026 get up from the bed.\u201dDevon said agitatedly, \u201cMom, you\u2019re in critical condition\u2026 You can\u2019t get up. I\u2019m begging you, please just lie in bed!\u201dLily had been on her deathbed for a long time and didn\u2019t even have the strength to get up.However, she still insisted on doing so. Not daring to disobey her, Devon had no choice but to help her get up the bed.Lily looked at Jordan and got down on her knees, which was to the shock of everyone. \u201cPlease\u2026 give Hailey a second chance.\u201d\u201cGrandaunt Lily!\u201d Jordan quickly went forward and held Lily.He did not expect Lily to kneel down and plead for Hailey moments before her death!Seeing the way his mother was behaving, Devon knelt down in front of Jordan tearfully. \u201cMr. Steele,for the sake of my mother, who is in her seventies and about to leave us, please grant her a favor!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t easy to live to such an age!Although Jordan was only in his twenties, he felt that life was thorny. He had gone through various trials and tribulations. Yet, Lily had lived for more than 70 years. God knows how much she had suffered in this life!Besides, Lily had saved Jordan\u2019s life before, so of course, he couldn\u2019t bear to see her leave this world on her knees with regrets.On the other hand, Hailey continued to kneel and plead tearfully, \u201cHubby, I really know my mistakes. Please, just forgive me.\u201d\u2018Maybe everything is God\u2019s will.\u2019Jordan sighed, looked at Lily, and said, \u201cOkay, I promise you that I\u2019ll give her another chance.\u201d1\u201cAs long as Hailey doesn\u2019t initiate a divorce, I won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cGreat\u2026 great\u2026\u201dAfter saying that, Lily suddenly closed her eyes and left this world forever!\u201cGrandaunt Lily!\u201d\u201cLily!\u201dHailey and Diana\u2019s voices filled the air, and they knelt by the bed while wailing loudly. They were crying even more loudly than Lily\u2019s children.Jordan knew that they were probably crying tears of joy too!The president of Ace Corporation, who\u2019s also the scion of a billionaire family, was finally their son-in-law again!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

May I?\u201dHailey naturally wouldn\u2019t have to ask for Jordan\u2019s opinion if they were going back to the large apartment in the New City residential estate.Hailey was clearly referring to Jordan\u2019s villa in Rose Garden.Since they were married, Jordan\u2019s home was naturally hers, she thought.No longer disgusted by the way she addressed him, Jordan said, \u201cGrandaunt Lily has just passed away. What\u2019s there to celebrate?\u201dHailey said, \u201cTo celebrate our marriage! Hmph!\u201dHailey playfully punched Jordan.1Last night, Jordan and Hailey finally consummated their marriage of three years, which had been a bumpy ride full of ups and downs.At first, Jordan didn\u2019t intend to get intimate with Hailey, but she kept trying to turn him on.Besides, Jordan had already promised Lily to give Hailey another chance.Not getting to sleep with Hailey in the past three years had been one of Jordan\u2019s greatest regrets. Being a human with sexual needs, he couldn\u2019t help himself.After last night, Jordan did verify that Hailey really did not sleep with Tyler before, which he was rather pleased about.\u201cOkay, you can invite your former classmates over if you want to.\u201dJordan remembered that many of Hailey\u2019s former college classmates were either city locals or citizens from other cities but continued staying in Orlando after graduating.They were also a bunch of snobs who used to look down on Jordan. Hence, Jordan wanted to see the attitude they would have towards him tonight!\u201cThank you, Hubby!\u201dHailey pecked Jordan on the cheek affectionately.Afterward, Hailey rested her head on Jordan\u2019s shoulder again. She thought, \u2018Hubby, I really want to go to that villa you bought in Phuket so badly!\u2019\u2018I also want to meet your grandparents, parents, brothers, and sisters.\u2019\u2018I want them all to know that I am your wife!\u2019\u2026Seven o\u2019clock in the evening at Rose Garden villa.Rachel, along with five or six girls in their early twenties, arrived at Jordan\u2019s villa.Upon entering, they praised the interior design and decor of the mansion, as well as the expensive furniture and ornaments they had never seen before.\u201cHailey, your husband is so rich. I\u2019ve never seen such an exquisite house!\u201d\u201cMr. Steele, you\u2019re so compatible with Hailey. Both of you are good-looking and rich. When are you planning to have children?\u201d\u201cYes, yes, we can\u2019t wait to attend your baby shower!\u201dHearing the compliments of her former classmates, Hailey began to get conceited.Hailey used to be embarrassed to bring Jordan out to meet her classmates because, knowing how mercenary they were, she knew they would definitely tease her about Jordan being a live-in husband.Now that they had learned that Jordan was the president of Ace Corporation, they began to envy Hailey.Hailey said, \u201cJordan and I are planning to have a baby recently. If we\u2019re lucky, we should have a bun in the oven soon.\u201dOne of them said, \u201cLet me do the calculation for you. If you get pregnant this month, the baby will be born in February next year. Which horoscope sign would that be?\u201dAnother classmate answered with a glass of wine in hand, \u201cThe baby can be an Aquarius or a Pisces. Hailey, do you hope for your baby to be an Aquarius or a Pisces?\u201dAnother one of them teased with a chuckle, \u201cAs long as it\u2019s Mr. Steele\u2019s, it probably doesn\u2019t matter what the baby\u2019s horoscope sign is.\u201d\u201cHahaha, of course, it\u2019s going to be Mr. Steele\u2019s baby.\u201dThe women started chatting over wine. After greeting them, Jordan left.They were actually just Hailey\u2019s platonic friends, and since they despised Jordan in the past, he did not need to entertain them.Hailey\u2019s purpose of inviting them over was just to show him off anyway.She actually didn\u2019t have many common topics to talk to them about. During college, they had actually secretly disliked Hailey because they were jealous of her beauty.After learning that Hailey had married a good-for-nothing, they secretly mocked her countless times before.After an hour or so of chatting, Rachel and Hailey came to the second floor to have some drinks while the rest stayed on the first floor to savor some famous wine that Jordan had brought home from abroad. They even took several photos and videos, which they then posted onto TikTok and Instagram.Rachel stood in front of the parapet with a glass of wine in hand. Glancing at Hailey\u2019s lowly former college classmates, Rachel Quinn chuckled contemptuously.She then turned to ask Hailey, \u201cHailey, have you slept with Jordan?\u201dHailey nodded in triumph.Rachel continued, \u201cDid he not suspect anything?\u201dHailey answered, \u201cOf course not!\u201dRachel said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. By the way, how are your assets divided now? Is it going to be according to the previous prenuptial agreement?\u201dHailey and Jordan had previously signed a prenuptial agreement that stipulated that their individual assets were kept separate.In that case, the villa, luxury cars, and company that Jordan owned had nothing to do with Hailey.The Camdens made Jordan sign the prenuptial agreement because they were afraid he would take advantage of them. Still, to their surprise, it was the other way around!The Steeles were afraid that the Camdens would take advantage!Hailey said, \u201cYes, I asked Jordan, and he said that he has to go to England to see his grandfather, and once I gain his approval, he will include me as one of the inheritors.\u201dRachel said urgently, \u201cWhat are you waiting for then? Hurry up and go to England! What are you setting up this gathering for, dear? Which is more important? What\u2019s most important now is not that you\u2019re still married to Jordan, but the Steeles\u2019 assets!\u201dHailey didn\u2019t drink because she was trying to get pregnant. Hence, she took a sip of water and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? We\u2019re trying to have a baby now, and since Jordan loves me so much, the Steeles will definitely accept me, don\u2019t worry.\u201dRachel said with a helpless expression, \u201cYou\u2019re really confident, huh? Aren\u2019t you scared that Tyler might look for Jordan and tell him about what you two did that day?\u201dHailey sneered and said, \u201cHe can\u2019t even save his own ass now. Tell the truth? Well, he won\u2019t unless he has a death wish. Salvatore and Pablo Dalton are both my husband\u2019s underlings!\u201dRachel said worriedly, \u201cI heard he went to New York to look for the Huxleys. The Huxleys are very powerful, and even if the Steeles have a high status, Jordan\u2019s grandfather has already moved abroad. They\u2019re definitely not as powerful as the Huxleys in this country.\u201dHailey said nonchalantly, \u201cEven though Rosie is a Huxley, her family hates the Collins, so they won\u2019t care about Tyler. Don\u2019t worry, I know more about the Collins and the Huxleys than you do. The Huxleys are not going to offend the Steeles for Tyler\u2019s sake.\u201dRachel didn\u2019t say anything else either. She raised her wine glass and said, \u201cWell, congratulations in advance then, you\u2019re about to become a billionaire soon.\u201d\u201cThanks, honey. When I get my hands on the assets, I\u2019ll give you a few million dollars to splurge on boy toys. Hahaha.\u201dHailey raised her glass and clinked it against Rachel\u2019s.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: Cayden Huxley Fancies Hailey Camden?Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosThe Huxleys\u2019 home in New York.New York was the most developed city in the US.In a top residential district in the city, the property price was close to $3,000 per square foot.Tyler was kneeling on the ground and pleading with the Huxleys.\u201cGrandpa, please save the Collins!\u201dFacing an elderly man, Tyler swallowed his pride and got on his knees.The old man was Rosie\u2019s father, Arthur Huxley.Arthur was the founder of Breezy Express, one of the country\u2019s leading domestic courier companies.Arthur was not alone in the house. His son, Dave, and Dave\u2019s wife, Emily Wilden, were also present.There were also Dave\u2019s sons, Shane Huxley and Cayden Huxley, who were Tyler\u2019s cousins.The 25-year-old Shane had a mature and stable appearance, while 22-year-old Cayden was tall, slim, and suave.Cayden gibed sneeringly, \u201cIsn\u2019t your father pretty impressive? Why are you asking us for help? I remember that he was really smug and arrogant when he came by to visit us after his company became listed a few years ago!\u201dArthur said to Tyler, \u201cTyler, even if your mother comes begging me on her knees today, I won\u2019t save Leonard Collins!\u201d\u201cBack then, I had already made arrangements for Rosie\u2019s marriage. If she had agreed back then, my business now\u2026 would have flourished even further!\u201dAt that time, Rosie went against her family\u2019s wishes and married Leonard, which made Arthur extremely infuriated.All along, Arthur had never acknowledged Leonard as his son-in-law.Tyler said, \u201cWell, even if you don\u2019t save my father, don\u2019t you care about the pride of the Huxleys?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dArthur asked with his hands behind his back.Emily was also curious as she looked at Tyler while drinking water from her teacup.Tyler\u2019s face suddenly turned red, and he felt extremely humiliated. \u201cDo you guys know Jordan Steele?\u201dCayden laughed and said, \u201cHaha, yes, the young president of the Ace Corporation, who at most, only has millions in assets, right? I heard that you snatched his wife and ended up implicating your family, causing them to be in a pathetic plight. You\u2019re such a good-for-nothing. You can\u2019t even deal with such a small fry like him.\u201dCayden completely disregarded Jordan, which was what Tyler hoped to see!If even the Huxleys feared Jordan, he wouldn\u2019t be able to take revenge!Shane asked, \u201cWhat does Jordan Steele have to do with our family\u2019s pride and reputation?\u201dSuppressing his anger, Tyler said menacingly, \u201cThat beast Jordan Steele slept with my mother!\u201dEmily spat out the mouthful of water that she had just drunk.Members of prestigious families were very particular about manners and etiquette, so she grabbed a piece of tissue paper and wiped her mouth with it before bending forward to dry the water.While doing so, she asked, \u201cTyler, isn\u2019t Jordan Steele your rival in love? He should be the same age as you, right? How did he end up sleeping with your mother?\u201dThe Huxleys were visibly upset. No matter what, Rosie was still a Huxley, and she had always been a dignified and elegant lady who had never embarrassed the Huxleys!Yet, such a disgraceful thing happened today!At this moment, Dave flew into a rage, picked up a teacup, and smashed it onto the ground.Dave\u2019s eyes were full of a murderous gaze as he glowered at Tyler and hollered, \u201cRosie must have done this to save your lowly life! You snatched Jordan\u2019s wife, and he wanted to exact revenge on you. That\u2019s why Rosie did what she had done!\u201dClearly, Dave still loved and cared about his younger sister. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have been so furious.Tyler was frightened and explained, \u201cNo! Jordan deliberately did it. He said that he likes sleeping with women of the Huxley family!\u201d\u201cWhat did you say!?!\u201d\u201cBullshit!\u201dShane and Cayden were all enraged, and they stomped towards Tyler in unison, feeling a strong urge to kill him.His words had indeed angered all the Huxleys!It was a considerable provocation!An ultimate provocation!Tyler raised his right hand and exclaimed, \u201cI swear Jordan said it to me!\u201dShane was infuriated. \u201cGrandpa, Dad, Jordan is a tycoon from Orlando, so he thinks he can be arrogant and disregard everyone else. We have to teach him a lesson!\u201dCayden barked with anger written all over his face, \u201cKill that scoundrel!\u201dHowever, Arthur remained conscientious. \u201cWe\u2019d better get to the bottom of the truth before deciding what to do. Take this bastard away first! Don\u2019t let him in again!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dCayden dragged Tyler out and followed him all the way to the elevator downstairs.Tyler was exasperated about the fact that they had refused to help him. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to follow me. I can leave on my own! I won\u2019t come to you for help again in the future. You\u2019re just a bunch of cowards who don\u2019t even dare to deal with Jordan Steele!\u201dTo his surprise, Cayden suddenly handed Tyler a cigarette and said with a playful smile, \u201cI heard that Hailey Camden is known as the most beautiful girl in Orlando, huh?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When Tyler gave him cigarettes in the past, he would often refuse.\u2018Why did Cayden take the initiative to give me a cigarette today?\u2019\u2018Has that playboy Cayden taken a liking to Hailey too?\u2019Tyler took the cigarette and chuckled. \u201cHailey is not only the most beautiful girl in Orlando, I personally think she\u2019s the most gorgeous girl in the country! I\u2019ve met countless women, but I\u2019ve never seen a woman more beautiful than Hailey!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not boasting, but none of the women here in New York can measure up to her!\u201dCayden\u2019s smile gradually became more and more lewd and perverted. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go chat in my villa.\u201dCayden took Tyler to his villa in his Mercedes G Wagon.The villa he lived in was designed by an internationally renowned architect, while the interior was designed by a famous foreign interior designer. The decor of the two-story villa was in a luxurious, continental style. There was also a basement and a sunken private courtyard.Tyler was a wealthy scion, after all. Upon arriving at Cayden\u2019s villa, he didn\u2019t gawk around and marvel in awe like a hillbilly would and instead just praised casually, \u201cYour home is well decorated.\u201dWhen he reached the couch, Tyler suddenly saw an album of wedding photos on the seat and picked it up to take a look, only to be surprised. \u201cAren\u2019t these the wedding photos of Hailey and me?\u201dThe Huxleys had naturally been invited to Tyler and Hailey\u2019s wedding. Tyler even delivered a copy of their wedding photos along with the invitation card to the Huxleys.His purpose then was just to show off that he married a beautiful wife.To his surprise, none of the Huxleys attended the wedding, nor did they send any gifts.Tyler knew that the Huxleys didn\u2019t want to be in touch with the Collins, so he thought that the wedding photos he had sent to them had been thrown into the garbage can long ago!He didn\u2019t expect Cayden to have brought it home with him and even kept it!After flipping through the photos and seeing how beautiful Hailey was, Tyler couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\u2018What a beautiful woman!\u2019Unfortunately, Tyler\u2019s family was about to go bankrupt, so a beautiful woman like her would no longer belong to him!Tyler knew that Cayden must have kept the wedding photos because he had taken a fancy to Hailey. Hence, he asked, \u201cHow is it, buddy? My ex-wife is beautiful, isn\u2019t she?\u201dCayden ordered his servant to pour them two glasses of wine. When the wine was served, he picked up a drink for himself and laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that there would be such a stunning woman like her in Orlando.\u201dThe women who could be described as \u2018stunning\u2019 by Cayden were few and far between in this world.The Huxleys were worth billions of dollars, while Cayden was tall and handsome. He had never failed to win the heart of any woman he courted!Tyler heard that Cayden had slept with many famous actresses and models!Cayden pointed at the wedding photos Tyler was holding, saying, \u201cTyler, I looked at your wedding photos repeatedly, but I realized that you guys were never kissing in any of them. Did the stunning beauty refuse to let you kiss her?\u201dClearly, Cayden was already smitten with Hailey!Tyler said in disdain, \u201cHow is that possible? I had already slept with her a long time ago! We didn\u2019t take any kissing photos because we shared a kiss in the car two days before the wedding shoot, and I got an allergic reaction after that!\u201d\u201cAt that time, the businesses I had invested in were losing money, and I wasn\u2019t in the mood to check if I had an allergic reaction to her lipstick. So, we didn\u2019t have a kissing shot during the shoot that day.\u201dCayden nodded and said, \u201cSo that\u2019s what happened. I thought you hadn\u2019t kissed her. However, you should be bragging when you said you slept together, right? My friends in Orlando have heard that even your parents have clarified that you and Hailey hadn\u2019t done the deed.\u201d\u201cI heard that Jordan and Hailey are remarried now and are still very much in love with each other. If you\u2019ve really slept with his wife, how can he continue being married to her?\u201dTyler laughed without saying anything. Instead, he took out a BMW car key and swung it in front of Cayden smugly.Cayden asked in confusion, \u201cWhy? Do you think I can\u2019t afford a BMW 7 Series?\u201dTyler laughed and said, \u201cYou treat your Mercedes-Benz G Wagon like a toy car. How would I dare to show off my BMW 7 series in front of you?\u201d\u201cBuddy, this looks like a car key, but it\u2019s actually a secret voice recorder!\u201d\u201cVoice recorder?\u201d Cayden asked in astonishment.Tyler said with a wicked smile, \u201cI secretly recorded the entire process when I slept with Hailey in the hotel the other day. How\u2019s it? Do you want to hear it?\u201dCayden was highly excited. Although there was no visual image, he still wanted to hear Hailey\u2019s voice!Cayden reached out to grab it.Tyler immediately retracted his hand and said, \u201cIf you agree to take revenge for me and make Jordan Steele end up penniless, I\u2019ll give this to you and help you get Hailey too. How does that sound?\u201dCayden couldn\u2019t help but take another look at the wedding photo, and more specifically, at Hailey\u2019s enchanting smile.He had planned to teach Jordan a lesson in the first place because Rosie was friendly to him.Now that Hailey had become the prize, Cayden had no reason to refuse.\u201cSure, since Grandpa can\u2019t be bothered to deal with Jordan Steele, I shall educate that good-for-nothing!\u201dAfter saying that, he snatched the voice recorder that was disguised as a BMW car key.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have a helper.\u201dSylvie hurried over and poured Jordan a glass of water.She then said, \u201cMy dear son-in-law, you must be tired after such a long day of work. Sit down and have some water.\u201dAfterward, she pointed at the mess in the hall and said, \u201cThose servants won\u2019t know how to pack up at all. There are so many expensive ornaments here. What if they accidentally get damaged? Benedict and I don\u2019t have much to do anyway. We\u2019ll just treat it as a workout.\u201dBenedict chimed in with a deferential smile, \u201cYes, we\u2019ll treat it as a workout. It\u2019s not tiring at all.\u201dJordan shook his head helplessly. Benedict and Sylvie had never \u201cworked out\u201d by doing household chores in the past three years.Jordan didn\u2019t say anything else and instead walked further in. Hailey hugged him.\u201cHubby, you\u2019re home. I missed you so much.\u201dThey had only been apart for three hours, but Hailey was already acting all coquettish as she leaped into his embrace.For a couple that was deeply in love with each other, one minute of being away from each other would feel like an eternity.Jordan and Hailey had never been so affectionate with each other in the past.Although they did have feelings for each other in the past, Hailey would never express her feelings for Jordan because she despised his identity.Things are different now. Jordan had become the president of Ace Corporation. In contrast, Hailey had become a meek, dainty woman who was so vulnerable and helpless that she couldn\u2019t unscrew a bottle cap on her own.Jordan was elated too. He caressed Hailey\u2019s hair and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was tied up with work at the office, so I couldn\u2019t accompany you to entertain your former classmates.\u201dHailey smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m actually not that close to my former college classmates. You don\u2019t have to care about them. The only friend of mine you should take seriously is Rachel!\u201dJordan frowned at the mention of Rachel.Jordan used to be a live-in husband who had a low status in the family, so he didn\u2019t dare to badmouth Hailey\u2019s best friend.However, things were different now because Hailey was very obedient towards him.Hence, Jordan spoke his mind. \u201cHailey, I know that you and Rachel have been best friends for more than a decade and are very close to each other. However, I still hope that you\u2019ll keep a distance from her.\u201d\u201cHuh? Why?\u201d Hailey was surprised.Jordan said, \u201cRachel is already married, but her husband is often away on business trips, so she takes advantage of that to date other men. I don\u2019t want her to lead you astray.\u201dHailey said with a faint smile, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t be like her. My husband is so handsome and rich, I won\u2019t bother looking at other men!\u201dJordan smiled helplessly. He knew that Hailey was not obsessed with younger hunks like Rachel was.Compared to appearance, wealth and status mattered more to Hailey.In terms of wealth and status, no one of the same age group as Jordan could pose a threat to him.\u201cHailey, Jordan.\u201dSylvie suddenly walked over again and handed them a box of folic acid tablets.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Jordan asked with puzzlement.Sylvie smiled and said, \u201cJordan, these are folic acid tablets. Aren\u2019t you and Hailey trying for a baby now? Folic acid tablets can prevent congenital neurological disorders in newborns!\u201dJordan felt a little awkward. \u2018This mother-in-law of mine has been rather thoughtful in all aspects lately.\u2019Sylvie would whip up nutritious meals for them every day for the sake of helping them increase the chances of conception.\u2026The following day, Sylvie came over early in the morning to make breakfast for Jordan and Hailey.Breakfast was even more sumptuous than lunch, and Sylvie even personally served Jordan his food.\u201cBe careful. It\u2019s hot, my dear son-in-law.\u201dJordan said, \u201cMom, you can just call me Jordan.\u201d\u201cAlright, Jordan,\u201d Sylvie said, grinning widely from ear to ear.Benedict no longer stood on ceremony either. \u201cJordan, Grandma has appointed Hailey as the director of the Hailey Residences project and me as the deputy director. So, we\u2019ll both be seeing you at your office very often.\u201dJordan had also heard about it. As Hailey had already reconciled with him, her status in the family far exceeded that of Herman and his children.. Now, Herman was no longer valued.Jordan said, \u201cNo problem, you can come over anytime. If you have any problems, you can approach Victoria or me directly.\u201dHearing Jordan calling Victoria by her first name and omitting her last name, Hailey felt extremely jealous. She immediately put her cutlery down and pouted.She said furiously, \u201cHubby, I don\u2019t like Victoria Clarke, she\u2019s a brazen hussy, and I\u2019m scared that she might seduce you. Can you dismiss her?\u201dJordan knew that Hailey and Victoria had had several conflicts before.He said, \u201cHoney, Victoria is just a pretty woman who\u2019s exceptionally competent at work. She knows more people than I do in Orlando. If I dismiss her, the company will incur major losses.\u201dHailey was rather displeased. \u201cCan you give me some shares as well? I also want to be the vice president of Ace Corporation!\u201dJordan did not answer immediately.Hailey immediately said, \u201cHmph, you don\u2019t love me at all. I\u2019m your lawfully wedded wife, and I\u2019m going to be the mother of your children. Yet, I don\u2019t get a single cent of your money, and you\u2019re not willing to give me a tiny amount of shares either.\u201dHailey was so aggrieved that she was about to cry.Jordan contemplated it carefully and thought that a tiny portion of shares in the company wouldn\u2019t amount to much. She would just be a deputy president in title anyway.Hailey was preparing to conceive soon, and once she got pregnant, she would have to stay at home to nurse her pregnancy and wouldn\u2019t have the time to go to the office. Hence, he thought it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal to give in to her.Hence, Jordan compromised, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll give you a portion of shares.\u201dHailey immediately beamed with joy. \u201cI want a larger portion than Victoria Clarke. Just 0.01% more than her, hehe!\u201dAfter breakfast, Benedict personally drove Jordan and Hailey to the Ace Corporation.Tension built up as soon as Hailey and Victoria met!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Still, Victoria was more outstanding of a career woman than Hailey.\u201cThe president\u2019s wife is so beautiful!\u201d\u201cThe president\u2019s wife is gorgeous!\u201dThe staff of the company, including Victoria\u2019s secretary, Ashley, kept sucking up to Hailey.Hailey was overjoyed too, because it was the moment that she had always dreamed of!She was now the boss\u2019s wife who was admired, respected, and envied by everyone!That was the life that she had always dreamed of leading!Soon, Jordan held a board meeting.At the meeting, Jordan announced that he would transfer 5% of his shares to Hailey. He appointed her as the co-deputy president of the company.With her current position and shares, Hailey could now be on equal footing with Victoria.Since Jordan was busy and had lots to handle, he didn\u2019t have the time to accompany Hailey.However, Hailey behaved herself and said that she wouldn\u2019t disturb Jordan and ask Victoria for help if she needed to.Hailey took the initiative to come to Victoria\u2019s office. Victoria followed behind her and then closed the door after they entered.Victoria said, \u201cCongratulations, Miss Camden. I didn\u2019t think you could save your dying marriage and reverse what had happened, even though you had hit rock bottom.\u201dIn Victoria\u2019s opinion, Hailey and Jordan\u2019s marriage should have been impossible to salvage!Hailey\u2019s cheating on him was intolerable and unforgivable.Not only had she been unfaithful, but she was also even unrepentant and continued to insult Jordan harshly.Victoria thought that it was impossible for them to get back together.Yet, Hailey was now still married to Jordan and even became the deputy president of Ace Corporation!Hailey smiled and sat down on Victoria\u2019s chair in her office without restraint.\u201cEveryone said that you\u2019re the most beautiful and competent woman in the business world of Orlando, who can easily subdue even the most domineering and overbearing company president.\u201d she said, crossing her legs.\u201cEven my grandmother praises you all the time and always tells me to learn from you!\u201d\u201cNow, you know who is the more competent one between us, right?\u201dHailey was here this time to show off!She knew that Victoria also fancied Jordan, but Victoria had never been able to win Jordan\u2019s heart even when she and Jordan were separated.That proved that Hailey was much more attractive than Victoria!Victoria was full of indignation as she couldn\u2019t stomach the fact that she had lost to a young woman who was also her arch-enemy!Victoria would concede defeat if Hailey was as good as her at coaxing men and knew not to touch their bottom line.However, the fact that Hailey had succeeded in getting Jordan back despite having hurt him repeatedly made her feel infuriated and disgruntled!\u201cIf your grandfather hadn\u2019t foreseen that you would divorce such a gem as Jordan and plant his people in the lawyer\u2019s and city clerk\u2019s offices, you wouldn\u2019t be here today,\u201d Victoria said.\u201cHailey Camden, don\u2019t be too complacent just yet. You may still be married to Jordan, but you still won\u2019t get any of the Steeles\u2019 assets. You can be smug and come show off to me again when you become an official inheritor of the Steeles!\u201dHailey also stood up furiously and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get pregnant with Jordan\u2019s child soon. It\u2019s only a matter of time before the Steeles acknowledge me!\u201dVictoria was filled with jealousy and bafflement. She couldn\u2019t figure out why Jordan would want to let such a shameless woman mother his children!\u201cDid you\u2026 really not sleep with Tyler Collins?\u201d Victoria asked curiously.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She knew that since Hailey had agreed to check into a hotel with him, it was impossible for them to have not done anything intimate.Victoria was apprehensive about the rumors that were being spread around now.Hailey, who had a guilty conscience, said diffidently, \u201cOf\u2026 of course!\u201dVictoria said with disdain, \u201cIt better be the case. If Jordan finds out that you\u2019ve lied to him, you will not only lose him again, even Hailey Residences, the real estate project that\u2019s named after you, will be scrapped!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dHailey was livid, but her guilty conscience deprived her of the guts to retort loudly.Hailey panted heavily in exasperation and pointed at Victoria. \u201cVictoria Clarke! You\u2019d better not provoke me! Don\u2019t forget, you still owe me a slap!\u201dHailey was a very vindictive person. After Victoria slapped her in the underground parking lot the other day, she cried for a long time.Victoria sneered and said, \u201cYou should thank me for slapping you at that time. Think about how offensive your words were!\u201d\u201cYou said that you didn\u2019t discipline Jordan well in the past three years even though you\u2019ve been making him kneel down to wash your feet every single day. If I hadn\u2019t slapped you then, God knows what nastier things you would have said!\u201dVictoria genuinely meant what she said.Although Jordan and Hailey were now in a seemingly loving marriage, it didn\u2019t mean that those things in the past had never happened.Perhaps, Jordan might recall them when they get into arguments in the future.Hailey didn\u2019t say anything else because she realized that she couldn\u2019t outargue Victoria!Hence, Hailey walked out of the office, and before she left, she said, \u201cI like this office very much. Please move somewhere else, Miss Clarke!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dVictoria was furious. She cursed in her head, \u2018A vile wench like you will never be able to conceive Jordan\u2019s child!\u2019\u2026Fifteen days later, in Rose Garden Villa.It was past nine in the morning, and Hailey finally woke up slowly.Hailey had been waking up after 9 am the past few days, perhaps because she was exhausted from trying to get pregnant or because she didn\u2019t want to go to work anymore since she was now married to the president of Ace Corporation. Hence, she slept in and woke up whenever she wished to.Hailey then used yet another pregnancy test kit, a routine she had gotten used to.Hailey suddenly exclaimed in joy.\u201cAh! Mom! I\u2019m pregnant!\u201dHailey ran downstairs excitedly, knowing that her mother would come over every morning to prepare breakfast for her and Jordan.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, my dear daughter? What happened?\u201dHearing Hailey\u2019s exclamation, Sylvie was quite worried at first.Hailey showed the test kit to Sylvie. \u201cThere are two lines. Doesn\u2019t that mean that I\u2019m pregnant?\u201dSylvie, who had been in her position before, was pleasantly surprised. \u201cYes, yes, yes, it\u2019s positive. Hailey, you\u2019re finally pregnant with Jordan\u2019s child!\u201dHailey hugged Sylvie in exhilaration and exclaimed, \u201cHaha, once I give birth to the baby, Jordan\u2019s grandfather will definitely approve of me!\u201dSylvie chuckled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s for sure! Who knows? The Steeles\u2019 assets might all end up belonging to my grandchild! Hailey, call Jordan right now but don\u2019t tell him you\u2019re pregnant yet. Ask him to meet us at your grandmother\u2019s place for dinner tonight. We\u2019ll break the news to him during dinner.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Hailey immediately dialed Jordan\u2019s phone number.However, Jordan was in a conference at the office, so he didn\u2019t pick up.Hailey had long expected that, so she decided to text him. \u201cHubby, come over to Grandma\u2019s for dinner tonight! I have a surprise for you!\u201dAfterward, Hailey called Rachel to inform her of the good news.\u201cHello, Rachel, where are you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
