We\u2019ll be rich if you get it up!\u201dAmidst the surging waves, Han Fei was shouting excitedly against the wind on his boat.\u201cWho knows, we might know what lies in store in that map today.\u201dHan Fei was a gold digger on the sea. Seven years ago, he accidentally picked up an ancient treasure map while fishing. The map captivated him and told him that there was a great secret, possibly a medieval shipwreck, in the marked spot on the map. If he could claim the treasure, he would live the rest of his life without ever needing to worry about money.Han Fei craned his head at the sea. His boat had been surrounded by countless fish, including several hundred sharks, since it came here, or he would\u2019ve dived in personally.Dong\u2026Suddenly, a sailor shouted, \u201cNot good, boss! Something is dragging us down! It\u2019s alive!\u201dHan Fei replied, \u201cAlive my ass! How can anything be alive after hundreds of years?\u201dCrack!An enormous force broke the keel of the boat, throwing Han Fei and company to the rails heavily.A sailor cried, \u201cHurry! Cut the rope!\u201dHan Fei yelled with bloodshot eyes, \u201cF**k off! Pull it up! We\u2019re going to die anyway! I would rather take a look at the treasure before that!\u201dHan Fei knew that he was doomed after he heard the crack. So, he had turned completely crazy and was determined to see the treasure.Another sailor cursed. \u201cF*ck you! I\u2019m here to make money, not to get myself killed!\u201dCaught by the unexpected danger, everybody was stunned.Waves were surging on the surface of the ocean.Han Fei, however, noticed none of it\u2014only a shadow below the water. What was that?A round item several meters long rose to the surface\u2026 Why did it look like a strange calabash?As a professional fisherman, he knew the ocean as well as he knew his own house, and he was certain that it was not a calabash. After all, no calabashes could remain unrotten after being soaked in seawater for so many years. He believed that it was more likely to be a calabash-shaped wreck.Hum\u2026An enormous force surged again and flipped the boat over. Han Fei fell into the ocean.However, an accident happened the next second\u2026A thick pillar of water rose to the sky, and the boat was immediately elevated.Flying to the sky in the water pillar, Han Fei panicked.The most titanic fish head appeared in the water.He swore that he had never seen a fish as large. Its head alone was bigger than a boat. Even the largest blue whale couldn\u2019t compare to it.\u2026Despite his dizziness, Han Fei felt that something was pulling him into the ocean. He was both excited and scared when he thought of the bloodcurdling behemoth down there.He saw a crab several meters long running to him when he was dying.Huh? Isn\u2019t it supposed to be a fish? Why is it a crab? Those were Han Fei\u2019s last thoughts.\u2026\u201cPu\u2026 Cough, cough\u2026\u201dSomebody was calling him as if from a distance. \u201cHan Fei, wake up! Brother, wake up!\u201dAfter spewing out he didn\u2019t know how much water, Han Fei finally woke up from unconsciousness. His head was aching and full of thousands of strange pictures and memories that did not belong to him.Opening his eyes, Han Fei gasped at the sky.A boundless ocean stretched out to the horizon, illuminated by a crimson sun that covered half of the sky. Scattered clouds dangled from the sky like long, uncombed hair.Hiss\u2026\u201cWhere the hell am I? What\u2019s that thing in the sky?\u201dHan Fei was appalled. The enormous fish a moment ago and the unbelievably large sun right now were surreal to him.However, they were not everything.BAM!After an explosion, a middle-aged man emerged from the water on a giant crab with a fishing pole in his hand.Han Fei was shocked. The crab floated on the surface, and the middle-aged man stood on top of it. As he stomped, ripples spread out on the ocean alongside an intimidating wind.The water splashed upward, and a fish broke out of it. The fish was two meters long, with fins that looked like wings. It also had greenish stones all over its body.Hiu! Hiu! Hiu!Suddenly, all the greenish stones on the fish darted toward the man.\u201cCrab King\u2019s Pincers!\u201dThe man roared and, lowering his body, threw out a punch. Immediately, a pincer shadow was pushed out, blowing up the fishing pole and the flying stones simultaneously. The two-meter-long fish was cut into halves. One of the halves fell right before Han Fei.Han Fei\u2019s eyes bulged in shock.\u201cHumph\u2026\u201dA middle-aged harrumphed. \u201cPulled by a green turtle into the ocean\u2026 You\u2019re daydreaming if you think you can pass the trial with such a performance.\u201dA young man next to Han Fei hurried to explain, \u201cMaster Wang Jie, it was only because Han Fei\u2019s arm was hurt by a blade fish the other day\u2026\u201dThe middle-aged man waved his hand. \u201cNo need to explain to me. The fish in the ocean do not listen to your reason. A level-two fisher is as good as nothing.\u201dIt was not until this moment that Han Fei realized he was lying on a strange boat. Dozens of similarly strange boats were strewn on the ocean nearby, and many children in strange clothes were standing on them.The children were all wearing tight clothes that looked like diving suits regardless of their gender, except that their clothes did not have oxygen tanks. Those children were also looking at him in disdain.Next second, when he saw his own hand, his eyes twitched.Huh? Why is my hand so small?Have I transmigrated?A young man said in concern, \u201cIt\u2019s alright as long as you\u2019re fine.\u201dBefore Han Fei was able to ask, the middle-aged stepped out and landed on an empty boat in front of everyone, then he spoke to the dozens of boats with a book in his hand.\u201cZhang Qing, a level-four fisher. Fishing result: a low-quality yellow fish.\u201d\u201cLu Lingzhi, a level-five fisher. Fishing result: a mid-quality green turtle.\u201d\u201cTang Ge, a level-seven fisher. Fishing result: a high-quality tentacle lobster.\u201dEveryone gasped in disbelief at the result.\u201cWhat? A tentacle lobster? How dare he? The tentacle lobster is known as the lobster of death. It\u2019s much more destructive than blade fish. He actually caught one?\u201dSome people said enviously, \u201cTang Ge was only level six last month, but he\u2019s level seven now. It\u2019s so fast.\u201dA girl put her fist on her chest and commented, \u201cWow! Tang Ge is so awesome! He\u2019s the genius of our school! He\u2019s almost certain to be a fishing master later.\u201dAs people whispered to each other, Han Fei looked at the young man next to him\u2014Tang Ge.I\u2019ve transmigrated?Taking a deep breath, Han Fei recalled countless memories.Tang Ge, his great friend, was saved by his father eight years ago and had been his close friend since. Pitifully, his father passed away in the unknown world beyond the level-three fishery. Tang Ge had been taking care of him since then.Han Fei took another deep breath. He had assumed the body of a useless man who was drowned. However, this world seemed interesting.Right then, Wang Jie looked at Han Fei and said, \u201cHan Fei, a level-two fisher, got nothing. Besides, Han Fei was the only person who was pulled into the ocean by a green turtle. He has failed the test. If he cannot pass the Fishing Trial a month from now, he will be expelled.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dMany people laughed, regarding Han Fei as a friend.A girl simply scolded, \u201cHan Fei, please stop wasting Tang Ge\u2019s cultivation resources. You\u2019re only holding him back.\u201dInfuriated, Tang Ge was about to argue with her, when Han Fei pulled his arm.Now that his memories had been assimilated, he would rather not keep lying there pretending to be dead. This world was strange, but as an adventurer who had fought pirates and sharks on the sea, Han Fei was not scared at all.Han Fei sneered, \u201cDid I eat your yellow fish? It\u2019s none of your business.\u201dEverybody fell quiet instantly.Tang Ge looked at Han Fei in shock. Han Fei had been taciturn since his father left. He barely talked, much less talked back.The girl almost jumped up in fury, hoping to rip Han Fei\u2019s mouth apart with her fishing hook.At this moment, Hu Kun said cynically, \u201cHey, Han Fei! Take your time feeling good about yourself, but a month from now, you won\u2019t even be qualified to look up to us as a low-level fisher. What are you so proud of?\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Fishing Trial is only a month from now, and you are still bickering? Go back and train!\u201d\u2026This planet was covered in ocean, and human beings lived on mountains that floated in the sky. Everybody made a living by fishing. They could absorb the spiritual energy and marvelous power within the fish and become fishing masters, thereby reaching the peak of this world.The middle-aged man, Wang Jie, was precisely a fishing master. He taught in a school in Heavenly Water Village. He was also a part-time supervisor of the general fishery.The fishery below Han Fei\u2019s feet was the only general fishery of Heavenly Water Village. It was hardly risky, but some people died here almost every day.The ocean represented opportunities as well as danger.Even general fisheries had countless creatures that had natural-born combative techniques.Green turtles were covered in stones and fought with them when in danger.Blade fish had knives on their back and could dart the knives at the enemy.The pincers of the tentacle lobster were sharp enough to cut gold.It was said that in level-one fisheries, there were fish that looked like swords. They had claimed too many lives.Of course, there were also shocking rumors. Some described the gigantic monsters in the unknown ocean, some mentioned the rare treasures at the bottom of the abyss, and some were about the undersea mermaids that had dominated the ocean for eons.However, Han Fei had never seen any of those in person, so he couldn\u2019t tell if the rumors were true.Tang Ge helped Han Fei get on an empty boat.Tang Ge said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. That was just an accident. We still have time. You\u2019re going to pass the trial next time.\u201dHan Fei was about to say something, when he found himself flying.To be more exact, the boat was flying.Han Fei was meaning to ask why the boat could fly, but he found the answer in his head.This kind of boat was designed for fishing, and they were going to Heavenly Water Village, which was located on an island floating in the sky.Tang Ge asked worriedly, \u201cHan Fei, are you alright? Were you unsettled under the sea?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. I just feel that everything is like a dream.\u201dTang Ge had a nagging feeling that Han Fei had turned a little odd, but Han Fei responded that he was over his trauma, leading to a change in personality.Han Fei was reluctant to tell him that his brother had already died and someone else would live on in his body.While Han Fei was thinking, the boat passed through the clouds, allowing him to see the mountain floating in the sky.Countless boats were hanging off the cliff. Above, many boats were coming and going.Han Fei was too shocked by the extraordinary view to speak. It seemed to be a scene from legends. Although he had memories of it, his heart was still pounding after seeing it for real.\u2026Several minutes later, the boat landed on the ocean, ripples spreading.Everybody had to register here when they left for the ocean or returned.Most people had stock when they returned, and the merchants were waiting for them here, so this place was also the biggest trade center in the village. Everybody was smiling even though the stink of fish did not smell too good. After all, they could make good money out of it.Han Fei clicked his tongue when he saw the prosperous town and heard the noises. Was this Heavenly Water Village?As he recalled, Heavenly Water Village had six hundred thousand people, and it was just a village. How many villages and cities were out there in this world? How many people were living in the sky?For Han Fei, everything was too new.With Tang Ge leading the way, the two of them registered in the departure port and returned to their house.Han Fei\u2019s house was a shabby yard with a coverage of only some twenty square meters. Right behind the house was a bottomless cliff.His nearest neighbor was several hundred meters away. The house seemed to have been isolated.He looked behind the house and saw infinite clouds. Half of the sky was blocked by the enormous sun. The mist at sunset was enchanting.Tang Ge picked up a few big clams from the water tank in the house and pulled a bucket of water out of Han Fei\u2019s bed.\u201cHan Fei, the clams are being boiled for you. Wait for me. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201dHan Fei nodded with a smile.Clams were the most common food for the residents here. They were succulent and in huge supply, enough to keep most people fed despite their lack of spiritual energy.An hour passed.Han Fei was going to pour the clams and the soup out, but he was stunned after he lifted the pot cover, because he saw a series of data.Regular Clam SoupOneRegular24 pointsThis food can keep you from starving. Nothing more.Han Fei rubbed his eyes.\u00a0Is it my talent?He took a deep breath. Tang Ge must be coming back soon. He\u2019d better study it later.He found two pearls in the pot. Han Fei smiled casually. The mediocre pearls could be sold for twenty sea coins. What could twenty sea coins buy? Two or three regular clams. There was absolutely nothing else in Han Fei\u2019s house.Soon, Tang Ge entered with a bowl of soup in his hand. The aroma of the food immediately filled the room.Han Fei grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re giving your Swallowed Spirit Soup to me again?\u201dLooking at the soup in Tang Ge\u2019s hand, Han Fei\u2019s eyes twitched again.Swallowed Spirit SoupEightRegular48 pointsTraining efficiency will be improved by 20% for three hours after this is taken.Han Fei swallowed.\u00a0My whole pot of soup is not as effective as that tiny bowl?Swallowed Spirit Soup was made with the spirit-swallowing fish in the level-one fishery. Such fish were not aggressive and could absorb natural spiritual energy. Their soup could fill people with spiritual energy. It was very helpful in cultivation.Tang Ge did not think it was a big deal. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I can easily pass the trial. My soul will be awakened a month from now. Do you think I care about a bowl of Swallowed Spirit Soup?\u201dHan Fei had heard about the trial too many times.As he recalled, everybody had to go through a Fishing Trial where elimination basically meant death when they were twelve. Only one who survived and passed the trial could awaken their soul, acquire their spiritual beast, and fish in the level-one fisheries. Otherwise, they could only live the rest of their life as a regular fisher.The Fishing Trial was only one month from now, and Han Fei could barely survive it. So, as the most distinguished genius, Tang Ge often gave his resources to Han Fei for Han Fei\u2019s cultivation.However, Han Fei\u2019s body was too unworthy. He was only a level-two fisher today. Level-two fishermen were essentially the ordinary people in this world. Few people were more untalented than him.Han Fei finished the soup quickly under Tang Ge\u2019s earnest gaze. The soup was fresh and salty, but he felt that his body was warmed up as he drank it. After only a brief moment, his body was refilled with energy and steaming faintly.Hiss\u2026Han Fei was amazed by the glimmer on his hand. Was it the so-called spiritual energy?\u00a0Am I glowing?He knew that everybody in this world was a cultivator, but it still felt quite wonderful to experience it in person for the first time.Tang Ge, on the other hand, chuckled. \u201cHow does it feel? When do you think you can become a level-three fisher?\u201d\u201cI wasted a lot of time when I was upset, but I\u2019ve learned to move on. I think I will make it soon!\u201dAfter drinking up the Swallowed Spirit Soup, Han Fei had another two clams and finally felt full.Tang Ge still needed to check the results at school, so he left in a hurry, allowing Han Fei to shut the door.Han Fei sat on the bed eagerly.\u00a0What would cultivation feel like? Exciting and fun?If someone else were in the room, they would be surprised at the calabash tattoo on Han Fei\u2019s wrist that even had leaves and vines.Han Fei recited Soul Fishing, the only art that he knew, but his wrist hurt the moment he got started.He opened his eyes, only to see the calabash tattoo on his wrist.\u201cAre you haunting me?\u201dThe next moment, Han Fei saw another set of data displayed by the so-called Demon Purification Pot\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Demon Purification Pot? What was the calabash on his wrist about?On one side of the series of data, there was a glittering option that said \u201cArts.\u201dHan Fei clicked \u201cArts\u201d curiously.Existing Arts:Soul Fishing (Incomplete)Level one of Immobilization (Incomplete)Note: This generic ancient art is now incomplete after the passage of time. Repairing it will cost 1,000 points of spiritual energy.Han Fei\u2019s eyes immediately glowed.\u00a0Am I favored by fate?His joy did not last long.When Han Fei noticed his 48 points of spiritual energy and realized the gap between it and one thousand, he was lost for words.Then, seeing \u201cRepairable\u201d behind the name of the art, he thought he might as well try repairing it.When he thought about that, his 48 points were immediately reduced to zero, and the hazy picture was gone.Gululu\u2026\u201cI\u2019m so hungry!\u201dHan Fei felt that the world was spinning and he was about to fall over. His overflowing spiritual energy vanished all of a sudden.Han Fei staggered to the table and ate the unfinished clams. He didn\u2019t feel better until he gulped down all the clams and his spiritual energy turned to 12 points.However, to his exasperation, the data regarding the clams left him wishing he were dead. They were merely at level one, barely enough to fill his stomach.\u201cFour points are too few. What does \u2018absorbable\u2019 mean here?\u201dWhen he thought about that, Han Fei realized that the clam before him lost something. He checked his own data, only to discover that his spiritual energy became 16 points.The clam\u2019s information had totally changed.Unfresh ClamOneBad0 pointsThis food can keep you from starving. Nothing more.\u201cI can do this?\u201dHan Fei was surprised.\u00a0Do I only need to touch the clams and not eat them?Instead of touching all the other clams immediately, Han Fei murmured, \u201cThe Demon Purification Pot can directly absorb spiritual energy? Does it mean that I\u2019ll have infinite spiritual energy as long as there\u2019s enough seafood? If I can absorb clams, can I absorb flowers, grass, or stone?\u201dThen, Han Fei focused on his Spiritual Heritage, which was Level One, Incomplete. Was it the reason why he hadn\u2019t been able to improve?Seeing that there were still some clams in the tank, Han Fei thought of repairing his Spiritual Heritage, only to discover that it would also cost 1,000 points of spiritual energy.Han Fei was lost for words.\u00a0Where can I find 1,000 points of spiritual energy?He focused his eyes on the clams again.Several minutes later, he touched all the clams, and his spiritual energy reached 52 points.Wait, the amount of spiritual energy can surpass the capacity of my body?Han Fei was shocked. It meant that he would have inexhaustible spiritual energy as long as he stored enough, whereas other people had to rest and recover after their spiritual energy was used up.However, Han Fei gave up the idea soon, because he did not have even close to enough seafood for absorption!Cleaning up all the clam shells, Han Fei sat on bed again, ready for cultivation.This time, Han Fei dare not repair any art. He merely glimpsed and noticed a progress bar that had moved forward a bit. It must\u2019ve been because he consumed 48 points of spiritual energy just now. He read on and saw new information.Existing Arts:Soul Fishing (Incomplete)Level one of Immobilization (Incomplete)Note: The generic ancient art is now incomplete after the passage of time. Repairing it will cost 1,000 points of spiritual energy.Superseding Art: Void FishingProgress: 48/1000Han Fei clicked his tongue.\u00a0Fine, I\u2019d better cultivate by myself!Han Fei sat cross-legged on the bed.The calabash appeared faintly on his wrist again, but not as painfully as before.In his meditation, Han Fei felt something cool in the air flowing into his body.After a long time, Han Fei, who was in the middle of his cultivation, suddenly lay back and fell asleep.BAM\u2026Han Fei was sound asleep when his door was kicked open by a ferocious-looking fatty, who pointed at Han Fei and roared, \u201cHere you are! You\u2019re still sleeping? You think you\u2019re the boss? Go to the general fishery in an hour! Don\u2019t think you can stay home because you\u2019re ill! Don\u2019t come back tonight if you can\u2019t complete your mission!\u201dHan Fei looked at the fatty, whose name was Zhang Han. The man was a supervisor of the area.A wise man knows when to retreat. With the Demon Purification Pot, it was only a matter of course for him to rise. It was unnecessary to cause trouble now.Han Fei rose quickly and smiled. \u201cSupervisor Zhang, we\u2019re going today?\u201d\u201cOf course! You think someone will offer you food for free? You\u2019re lucky that according to the new rule, common fishermen only need to pay a tax of 150 kilograms of fish every day.\u201dZhang Han then sneered, \u201cHowever, if you can\u2019t submit 150 kilograms, you know the consequence, right? No useless men live in Heavenly Water Village. You\u2019ll spend the night on the ocean. Think carefully.\u201dHan Fei was alarmed. He knew that the fishermen who couldn\u2019t pay the tax would be cast out. It was said that nights on the ocean were dangerous with the fish attacks. Nobody had ever survived five consecutive nights on the ocean.However, he said with a smile, \u201cSupervisor Zhang, I\u2019ve lost my fishing pole and bait, so\u2026\u201dZhang Han grinned. \u201cNo biggie. I\u2019ll give you an ordinary fishing pole and a box of bait for only ten low-quality pearls. What do you think?\u201dHan Fei clenched his fists even more tightly. The man was obviously taking advantage of him. An ordinary fishing pole cost three low-quality pearls, and a box of bait was only worth eighty sea coins.Taking a deep breath, Han Fei said, \u201cSupervisor Zhang, I only have twenty sea coins for now. Can I borrow your tools?\u201dZhang Han changed his expression and said angrily, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me sooner that you have no money? You don\u2019t even have ten low-quality pearls? You are destined to be a civilian for the rest of your life\u2026 If you die in an ocean, how can you pay me back?\u201dAlthough that was what he said, Zhang Han turned and left, not forgetting to tell Han Fei to head to his store, but interest would be collected!Han Fei was infuriated, but he also realized that he was in a world where the strong preyed on the weak. Revenge was a dish best served cold. He decided to hold himself back until he could get back at the guy.\u2026Very soon, Han Fei came to the departure port.Zhang Han had a store himself, but he paid little attention to it. When Han Fei came, the man was eating a tiny shellfish.Zhang Han found a ragged fishing pole and a box of green bait in his store, before he tossed them to Han Fei.He said, \u201cYou would\u2019ve been exiled if you weren\u2019t still eligible for the Fishing Trial. Go now. Remember, one low-quality pearl every day.\u201dIn the registration office, Han Fei finished the paperwork and under the receptionist\u2019s gaze, Han Fei boarded an eight-men boat.A middle-aged man next to Han Fei said, \u201cSit tight. We\u2019ve leaving.\u201dHan Fei was still astounded despite the last experience. This world was too splendid. The reflection of the enormous sun dyed the ocean red. It was very beautiful.\u201cHey! What\u2019s interesting about the sun? You\u2019re not baiting the hook?\u201dHan Fei turned around, only to discover that everybody was putting the green bait on the hooks of their fishing poles.The green bait was the most common bait for regular fishermen. It was like an earthworm but thicker and shorter.A young man on the boat looked at Han Fei. \u201cYou were the guy who was pulled into the ocean by a green turtle yesterday?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Fei nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201dThe young man sneered, \u201cHow weak.\u201dHan Fei was rendered speechless.\u00a0Are the kids here all so caustic?Several minutes later, the boat landed on the ocean, ripples spreading.Everybody raised their poles. It was hard to imagine that the hook flew hundreds of meters away without a reel after an easy toss.Han Fei was full of questions. Everyone closed their eyes. Their hands glimmered with spiritual energy.Their fishing lines were all slightly moving back. Han Fei was amazed. Why were their fishing lines extensible?Han Fei had an answer. They must be controlling the fishing lines with spiritual energy. But as he recalled, it consumed a lot of spiritual energy.Han Fei cast the hook with all his strength, only for it to land twenty meters away.\u201cHuh?\u201dWhen he went fishing before, there was always a weight at the end of the line, but he had only a line and a bait right now. It was rather difficult to control the distance with spiritual energy.Han Fei hurried to look at everyone and discovered that they didn\u2019t notice it, so he began his fishing as if nothing happened.Skillfully, he pulled, released and shook the pole\u2026\u201cTo the left\u2026\u201d\u201cTo the right\u2026\u201dHan Fei murmured to himself, but everyone on the boat was surprised.Someone said, \u201cHey, are you an idiot? Your bait is gone.\u201dHan Fei did not know what to say.The middle-aged man said, \u201cPull it back. The green bug is the least active bug, so the fish will not touch your hook when it is still wriggling.\u201dPulling the fishing line was an art. Everybody was lost for words watching Han Fei reel the line. Someone finally commented, \u201cWhy have you not starved? Use your spiritual energy, not your muscles!\u201dI used my spiritual energy, but the fishing line wouldn\u2019t budge!The middle-aged man said, \u201cFeel your spiritual energy. Concentrate it on the fishing line and pull the line back.\u201dBlushing, Han Fei felt his spiritual energy accordingly. When his spiritual energy was attached to the fishing pole and line, he was surprised to sense the obscure attraction between them.I didn\u2019t know I could wield it like this!Refreshed, Han Fei activated his spiritual energy. The hook immediately sprang out of the water. However, it did not stop but darted into the butt of another young man on the other side of the boat.\u201cHan Fei, you\u2019re asking to be killed\u2026\u201dHan Fei apologized. \u201cSorry, it was not on purpose. Don\u2019t move. I\u2019ll get it out\u2026\u201d\u201cPu\u2026\u201dThe hook flew from the young man\u2019s back. Everybody, including Han Fei himself, ducked quickly.A large piece of cloth had been torn off on the young man\u2019s butt. Blood was spurting out.Han Fei said, \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry that I didn\u2019t control it well.\u201d\u201cHan Fei, I will kill you!\u201dThe others also looked at Han Fei warily.\u00a0Was the boy\u2019s head damaged yesterday? Why had he forgotten the basics of fishing?Seeing that the young man was charging at him, Han Fei hurried to raise his fishing pole. The young man was so scared that he stopped immediately, suspecting that Han Fei would throw the hook at him again.Someone scolded, \u201cHan Fei, get back to business. We\u2019ll call the supervisors if you cause trouble again!\u201dHan Fei smiled in embarrassment. \u201cAll right.\u201dThe incident was over. The young man did not really give him trouble despite his fury.Han Fei simply sat there after casting the hook, same as what other people did.But such a way of fishing required no skill at all! After almost an hour, right when Han Fei intended to ask for advice in his impatience, someone suddenly stood up and grunted.Then, the guy made a very weird gesture, and his spiritual energy surged out. His fishing pole and line were immediately covered in a faint radiance.\u201cRise!\u201dBo\u2026Han Fei\u2019s eyes widened. Was it so simple?He then realized that other people were as envious of the man as he was.A huge yellow finish around sixty kilograms had been pulled up by a man named Old Huang.Yellow fish were unaggressive and not as threatening as green turtles and blade fish, so they were one of the cheapest and most popular foods on the floating islands, just like the clams.Seeing the others lifting their poles, Han Fei did the same. It was because the yellow fish struggled too long just now and all the vigilant fish had escaped. Until they reached the level of a fishing master, the fishermen always changed spots every time they caught a fish.Arriving at a new location, everyone cast their lines again.After only a quarter-hour, the middle-aged man sensed something. Just like Old Chen just now, the middle-aged roared, \u201cRise!\u201dHan Fei\u2019s eyes lit up\u2014it was another green turtle. He remembered Wang Jie\u2019s fascinating Crab King\u2019s Pincer when Wang Jie dealt with the green turtle yesterday.Veins bulged on the middle-aged man\u2019s hands, and the line was pulled fast. Holding the pole with both hands, the man turned around and dragged with his shoulder, hauling a big fish out of water.\u201cHiu! Hiu! Hiu!\u201dStones were thrown. Everybody hid in a corner except Han Fei, who watched the middle-aged man slap the stones away with his glowing hand until he smashed the turtle in the end.A one-meter-long green turtle fell on the deck, its tail slapping about randomly. It seemed to have passed out.Han Fei had a closer look this time. The green turtle was covered in scales that looked like greenish stones all over its body. Those scales reflected bright blue light under the sun.Green TurtleFiveRegular12 pointsIt can increase one\u2019s physical strength if it\u2019s eaten over a long period of time.Han Fei realized that the spiritual energy of three clams equaled to that of a green turtle. It meant that this thing was not really as impressive as it looked.Everybody exclaimed in shock.\u201cOld Niu, are you a superior fisher now?\u201dThe middle-aged man grinned and said frankly, \u201cI made a breakthrough the other day.\u201dEverybody congratulated him.Old Chen, in particular, grabbed his arm and asked, \u201cI\u2019ve been stuck in level six for a long time. What\u2019s your advice?\u201dHan Fei pricked his ears. He never saw a superior fisher in person before, and he was quite shocked that Old Chen had been stuck for almost half of his life. Was cultivation so difficult?Fine, a worker has to sharpen his tools first if he wants to do a good job. I\u2019ll crush you after I improve my arts and my Spiritual Heritage.After the middle-aged man put away the large green turtle, they changed spots again.Half a day passed in the blink of an eye. Of the eight passengers, everybody had accomplished their task except Han Fei and the young man who was about the same age as him.The sun was setting. They began chit-chatting while enjoying some of their trophies.Suddenly, the young man shouted, \u201cI got one! I got one!\u201dHan Fei looked at him gloomily. Everybody else had accomplished their task, but he hadn\u2019t even caught a single fish after using up almost all his bait.Right as Han Fei mocked himself, a seasoned fisher cried out.Old Chen also shouted, \u201cBoy, let it go now! You can\u2019t catch this!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019ve attracted a tentacle lobster!\u201dHan Fei was surprised.\u00a0A tentacle lobster? The thing that Tang Ge caught earlier?Before the young man realized what was going on, he had already lifted his fishing pole.Everybody saw a pair of long tentacles. They swung their poles at it.The middle-aged man roared, \u201cBreak!\u201dHowever, one of the tentacles quickly wrapped around the young man\u2019s arm. To Han Fei\u2019s shock, a patch of flesh on the arm was immediately torn off, and the young man fell over to one side of the boat, crying.Old Chen shouted and dragged the young man back by the leg, but the other tentacle extended straight toward him. The middle-aged man instantly butted Old Chen with his fishing pole, knocking him back.Next moment, the young man was pulled off the boat entirely. Han Fei was bold enough to look out, only to discover, sweating, that the young man\u2019s head was already gone. From beginning to end, all the tentacle lobster revealed was two tentacles.F*ck\u2026 Can I go back to my original world?Han Fei was pale. The young man mocked him that morning, and he had wounded his butt. He was rather sorry that the guy passed away just like that. That was only a kid after all.One of them pondered for a moment and said, \u201cLet\u2019s report it to the supervisors!\u201dThe supervisors were the patrolmen in the fisheries, under the lead of a fishing master. The captain of supervisors in this fishery was Wang Jie, who saved Han Fei yesterday.Wang Jie soon arrived. He glanced at the crowd and saw Han Fei, but his eyes did not stop on him.With an awful expression, Wang Jie asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201dThe passengers quickly explained everything. Wang Jie was immediately irked. \u201cWhat an idiot! Did he not know that the feeling of the tentacle lobster is different from that of other fish? How dare he try to reel it in?\u201dThe middle-aged man replied, \u201cPerhaps he was too anxious. It\u2019s almost sunset.\u201dHan Fei\u2019s face was even gloomier after he heard that.As a famous gold digger at sea, he had caught not just common fish but also sharks before, but after an entire day, he failed to even grab a shrimp. It was most humiliating.Wang Jie said solemnly, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been peaceful recently. Another boat fared even worse than you. They encountered a Snakebelt. Four of the eight people on board died\u2026\u201dHiss\u2026Everybody gasped. A Snakebelt was even more horrifying than a tentacle lobster. If they had encountered it, they couldn\u2019t have ended up any better than the other ship.Han Fei recalled what a Snakebelt was. It was a kind of long, scarlet fish that looked like a snake, except that its head was almost exclusively teeth. It swam extremely fast in the ocean. It could dart into a human and slither inside his body.Han Fei finally understood why people liked low-level boats: because the passengers could help one another in an accident. If he had met a tentacle lobster on his own, he would\u2019ve probably been killed.Wang Jie asked, \u201cHave you accomplished your mission?\u201d\u201cYes, we have. Thank you for asking, Mr. Fishing Master.\u201dWang Jie looked at Han Fei indifferently. \u201cWhere\u2019s your fish?\u201dBlushing, Han Fei replied, \u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t catch any.\u201dWang Jie was stunned. After being dragged into the ocean by the green turtle yesterday, this guy did not catch any fish today. Wang Jie had never seen a fisher who couldn\u2019t catch any fish before. However unskilled you are, you can at least get a few yellow fish or little white fish, right?The middle-aged man said in a hurry, \u201cI\u2019m told that he almost drowned yesterday. His hook was unsteady, probably because he had not recovered from the shock yet. He will be better in a couple of days.\u201dWang Jie sniffed. \u201cUseless\u2026 If you give such a poor performance after a slight shock, what can you achieve in the future?\u201dHan Fei did not give a reply, because he was also stunned. Was it really because he cast the line poorly?Wang Jie made Han Fei spend the night at sea despite many people pleading on his behalf. Wang Jie only advised Han Fei that when fishing at night not to cast the line deeper than three meters. He couldn\u2019t be bothered to show any pity to this useless bum.Old Chen handed over a piece of dried fish and a pot of water to Han Fei. \u201cBe careful.\u201dSomeone else gave Han Fei an iron dagger and said, \u201cUse this to protect yourself!\u201dHan Fei thanked them, feeling warm about other people\u2019s generosity.Wang Jie left the boat to Han Fei and departed with the others.Han Fei was bummed after everybody left. He grabbed the fish that Old Chen left him and chewed it; it had a pungent smell.After not eating any food for an entire day, Han Fei was already hungry. He soon devoured the dried fish, which was not large at all.Soon, it was completely dark. The waves were not big out at sea, and nothing except for the bright moonlight could be seen.\u201cMy hook was unsteady?\u201dHan Fei remembered what the middle-aged man said. He also remembered Immobilization in Soul Fishing.The books described it in an overly simplified manner. Keep the body, the pole, and the heart as tranquil as still water\u2026 It was easier said than done. After all, a human was not a statue.Suddenly, Han Fei felt that his wrist was hot. He rolled up his sleeve, only to find the calabash mark was glimmering. Then, he sensed that spiritual energy was attaching to his wrist and entering his body like the air he was breathing in.Huh? The spiritual energy is automatically attracted into my body?Immediately, Han Fei dropped his fishing pole and sat down. He didn\u2019t know why the calabash began to absorb spiritual energy, but it was a good thing and could help with his cultivation.Han Fei began cultivating according to memory. The moment he started, the calabash on his wrist shocked strongly, and the spiritual energy attracted was multiple times greater than before.An hour later, Han Fei sensed that something was broken in his body. He was exalted and energetic.Is this the so-called breakthrough?Han Fei looked at the Demon Purification Pot. The data had indeed changed.Demon Purification PotOwner: Han FeiLevel: Three (Beginner Fisher)Spiritual Energy: 60 (60)Spiritual Heritage: Level One, Incomplete (Upgradeable)Main Art: Soul Fishing (Repairable)Han Fei was delighted. This breakthrough was too easy. Didn\u2019t they say that it could take years? Why had he made it after cultivating for only an hour?Han Fei was going to continue his cultivation, when he heard rattling sounds on the ocean.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDozens of fish were jumping in the water near the boat and did not leave until minutes later, as if they were asking him why the spiritual energy was cut off.Han Fei was quite excited. Could the fish sense the spiritual energy that was attracted to him during his cultivation?Seeing that more and more fish were leaving, Han Fei hurried to put a bait on the hook and cast the line. Could there be a better moment?There was no telling if Han Fei was luckier when he was in a good mood, but he sensed an enormous force the moment he cast the line.Han Fei roared and clutched the pole. Having no time to bother with any fishing tricks, he simply pulled the pole hard.\u201cDamn! This creature is strong!\u201dThe hook was shaking violently, assuring Han Fei that it was not a tentacle lobster. As such, Han Fei hauled it without concern.Perhaps because his level was too low, Han Fei almost lost his fishing pole several times. After a few minutes of struggle, a big yellow fish was finally lifted out of the water. It was not as huge as the one that Old Chen caught, but it could definitely be counted as a big fish.Data popped up in his view.Yellow FishThreeRegular6 pointsIt can increase one\u2019s health if it\u2019s eaten over a long period of time.Not wasting any time, Han Fei hurriedly fixed the bait and cast the line. Because there were plenty of fish, the bait was taken quickly, but the fish were very strong and broke off the hook. In the end, he couldn\u2019t even get a shrimp.After he was familiar with the technique, Han Fei soon caught a second yellow fish, although it was apparently smaller than the first one.Han Fei was not bothered, because it still weighed almost thirty kilograms. His daily requirement was 150 kilograms.However, what surprised Han Fei was that fishing with spiritual energy cost him five points of spiritual energy, when this yellow fish only contained five points of spiritual energy. That was too much.Another fish took the bait after an hour. Han Fei estimated that it was the normal period of time. The shoal of fish only gathered just now because of spiritual energy.Instead of reeling in the fish immediately after it took the bait, Han Fei learned to concentrate his energy on the fishing pole, sense the fish\u2019s struggle, and spin the pole. Then, he could pull the fish up easily.Of course, it was not successful every time. The hook slipped more than ten times during the five hours, and Han Fei only caught no more than ten fish in total, including two little white fish.Another hour passed. The night was already dark. The wind was rising and the temperature was dropping.He had one last piece of bait left. In his cabin, eight to nine yellow fish were swimming. He felt lucky that they were all yellow fish. If he had met a green turtle, he might not have been able to catch it.His job would be done after he used the last bait.Suddenly, Han Fei remembered Wang Jie\u2019s warning. Would he catch something else if he sank the hook more than three meters deep?Han Fei thought that it wouldn\u2019t hurt if he tried it. Going slightly deeper than three meters shouldn\u2019t be too dangerous. Yellow fish were too inferior after all. He intended to aim for the green turtle.This time, Han Fei loosened the fishing line a bit more on purpose. He felt that there might be green turtles three meters below.As it turned out, the fishing line moved the moment Han Fei dropped the hook.Are the fish three meters below so active?Han Fei was delighted. The deeper a fish was, the faster they would take the bait?He immediately pulled the fishing pole up, but he suddenly lost balance and fell on the boat after the fishing line broke.Thanks to the bright moon, Han Fei saw a cold edge on the dim ocean. A weird fish half a meter long was darting at him.Han Fei realized that it was a blade fish. He had met a blade fish? Did the blade fish cut his fishing line just now?Everybody knew that the blade fish carried a knife on its back. The blade could even be built into weapons and sold at a high price.The knife on the blade fish could be separated from its body. The cold edge that Han Fei saw was exactly such a knife.Han Fei hurried to block it with his fishing pole.Crack\u2026The fishing pole fell apart in the blink of an eye. Han Fei fell back under enormous force. Thankfully, the knife brushed past his face and stabbed into the wood.Han Fei was dazed. It was so close. If he hadn\u2019t fallen, would he have been cut in half?Han Fei rolled on the boat and smacked it with the fishing pole.Han Fei\u2019s arm became numb. The fish was too strong.Han Fei confirmed that even sharks were not as ferocious as this creature, which had skills.Having no place to hide in, Han Fei suddenly thought of something. If spiritual energy could be injected into the fishing pole, could the fishing pole be used as a weapon?Han Fei grabbed the two halves of the fishing pole. Transmitting his spiritual energy to them, he stabbed them at the head of the fish.Han Fei felt like he was hit in the chest by a giant rock. He was flung into the wall, bleeding internally. The next moment, a heavy fish fell upon his body.\u201cCough, cough\u2026 Damn, why are the fish here so dangerous?\u201dThe fishing pole stabbed into the blade fish\u2019s mouth. The fish was too strong and killed itself by pressing against the pole. Han Fei narrowly escaped disaster.After a long time, Han Fei finally returned to himself. He felt he had run out of strength. His body was numb and painful.He finally understood why people did not like catching blade fish. Such creatures were truly lethal.Blade FishSixRegular (Dead)22 pointsIt can increase one\u2019s health if it\u2019s eaten over a long period of time.Inferior Fin Knife\u201cThis is an inferior knife? What would the better ones be like?\u201dHan Fei breathed heavily, lost for words. His wrist was feeling a pricking pain after the tremendous consumption of spiritual energy.He lowered his head, only to discover that the calabash was glowing. Vaguely, he saw a green light moving from the blade fish to the calabash before it disappeared.Had the calabash absorbed the spiritual energy?Gululu\u2026Han Fei was so hungry that he cut a piece of meat from the dead blade fish. The meat was stinky and tasteless after the spiritual energy disappeared.However, his hunger was still greatly relieved. He looked at the Demon Purification Pot, but only saw two points of spiritual energy.Han Fei was lost for words.\u00a0The spiritual energy absorbed by the calabash is not counted as my storage?Left with no choice, Han Fei could only pick up a yellow fish from the cabin and devour it.\u201cWhat a pity! It weighs dozens of kilograms\u2026\u201dHan Fei complained while absorbing it. In the meantime, he looked at his calabash curiously. However, there was no response after a long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Han Fei was utterly bankrupt again.The only thing he had left was a ragged dagger and an inferior knife-fin stuck in the wood. Gloomily, Han Fei took out a little white fish and began to eat it raw.Huh! It does not taste bad at all. The meat is tight and feels like beef.Han Fei was a bit surprised. This meat could totally be made into sashimi. He thought that the white fish tasted worse than the yellow fish and blade fish, but they were surprisingly good.He finished half of the white fish quickly. To Han Fei\u2019s surprise, his spiritual energy increased from 20 to 23. Didn\u2019t the white fish have three points of spiritual energy in total? He had only just eaten half of it.Han Fei finished the other half of the fish. His spiritual energy became 26 points. He was quite surprised.It was almost dawn. He had survived the night. Han Fei sat cross-legged and continued his cultivation.His wrist became hot again, indicating that a stream of spiritual energy was entering his body, but the amount of spiritual energy was much lesser.Huh? Why is it lesser now?Han Fei opened his eyes in surprise and noticed that the three moons were about to disappear.The absorption of spiritual energy has something to do with the three moons?More than an hour later, the enormous sun revealed itself on the horizon, unleashing the morning sunlight.Han Fei, feeling that his wrist was burning, stopped cultivating, and opened his eyes, only to discover that his wrist was smoking with purple light.Before he rose, a fire had risen on his wrist.Han Fei immediately got back to his feet and extended his hand into the water and checked the Demon Purification Pot in passing. His spiritual energy had turned from 26 into 108. He was instantly surprised. Was it because of the purple light just now?Han Fei almost fell over while he considered. The ocean was boiling, waves rising everywhere.Han Fei saw countless fish swimming towards him as they began to jump merrily. For a start, a few little white fish smacked Han Fei\u2019s face.Not just that, a big yellow fish knocked into Han Fei\u2019s belly, making him double over in pain. Han Fei then saw a tentacle lobster flying.\u201cF*ck\u2026\u201dWasting no time, Han Fei dived into the fish cabin and closed it. Soon after he closed the fish cabin\u2026Dum! Dum! Dum!Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!Too many fish were falling on the deck. Tentacle lobsters were also crawling up there. Han Fei even saw their tentacles through the gaps.When Han Fei tried to take another look, a knife swooshed into the cover and almost stabbed him.Several minutes later, a lobster leg pierced through the cover of the cabin.\u201cBro! Please go!\u201dHan Fei held his breath. If a tentacle lobster broke it, he would be cut into pieces!Huh, wait, can I try absorbing it?Han Fei immediately hugged the leg without letting it go.\u201cAbsorb it! Demon Purification Pot, absorb it!\u201dBAM!The cover of the fish cabin was almost lifted.At first, the tentacle lobster struggled hard and nearly flipped the boat over several times, but gradually, it weakened. Han Fei was delighted that the Demon Purification Pot was useful.Five minutes later, Han Fei felt that the lobster leg stopped struggling in his arms. Its spiritual energy must\u2019ve been devoured by him.After a couple of minutes, the noises on the deck finally stopped. The fish seemed to have leaped back into the ocean. Han Fei finally summoned the courage to open the cabin.A yellow fish, startled by Han Fei, bumped into Han Fei\u2019s head. He almost cried in pain.Confirming that no dangerous creatures were on board, Han Fei jumped out of the fish cabin, only to discover that the deck was a mess. Too many fish, including a blade fish, had been cut into pieces.Other than that, the boat was laden with stones from green turtles. As far as he could see, three of them were dead on the deck.Some of them were minced, and some were cut into halves.Han Fei was flabbergasted. How sharp were the tentacles of the tentacle lobsters to cut the green turtles?Han Fei turned around and looked at the three-meter-long tentacle lobster, which seemed to have been boiled. It had a particularly huge head and a short body. Like dry wood, it was now paralyzed on the deck.But soon, Han Fei became excited. His spiritual energy increased to 156, which meant that the tentacle lobster provided 48 points of spiritual energy to him, the same amount a Swallowed Spirit Soup could provide.Besides that, the eight fish cabins on the boat, except for the one he had been hiding in, were all full of fish.Han Fei laughed aloud, counting his fingers and murmuring to himself.There are a lot of white fish. The calabash can have dozens of them\u2026 The yellow fish are plentiful, too\u2026 Huh, why is the water in this cabin red?When Han Fei looked at the fish cabin, he saw something swimming through it.Han Fei kicked the cover and closed the cabin. If his guess was correct, that must be a Snakebelt.The snake-shaped fish had killed half of the passengers on a boat yesterday. He certainly couldn\u2019t beat it if it ran loose.Han Fei had made up his mind to let the stronger experts open this cabin after he returned.So, Han Fei held yellow fish in his left hand and green turtles in his right hand. After absorbing them, he kicked the bodies off the boat. Although the fish could still be sold after they were dead, the money was not as important as his secret.A dozen minutes later, Han Fei was shocked again.Han Fei had 814 points of spiritual energy!Han Fei breathed heavily. The storage of the Demon Purification Pot had no upper limit.Han Fei enjoyed the sunlight on the deck, delighted. He had thought that it would take a long time before he saved a thousand points of spiritual energy, but one night turned out to be almost enough.Should I do it again tomorrow night?What Han Fei did not know was that, if he told someone else about it, they would think that he was crazy to train in the morning under the sun, which would\u2019ve burned other people into ashes!He cleaned up the boat and intentionally left some traces. He also cut the tentacles of the tentacle lobster and kicked it into the water, because he couldn\u2019t explain why such a huge lobster was lying here in one piece.The sun was already high, and many boats were descending from the sky.One of them came straight toward where Han Fei was.Wang Jie came with another two supervisors.\u201cHuh?\u201dWang Jie did not check if Han Fei was all right, or notice the dark circles around Han Fei\u2019s eyes. He and his subordinates were shocked at the mess on Han Fei\u2019s boat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A tentacle lobster must\u2019ve caused this.\u201dHan Fei spoke innocently. He pointed at the dark circles around his eyes and said, \u201cA yellow fish knocked into me and left me these marks.\u201dWang Jie frowned. \u201cWas it a fish tide?\u201dOne of the guys behind Wang Jie said enviously, \u201cThis is still a lot. Dozens of fish are enough for you to pay your taxes for two months.\u201dHan Fei grinned. \u201cI suspect that there is a Snakebelt in this cabin. I closed it and never checked it.\u201d\u201cA Snakebelt?\u201dThe two guys behind Wang Jie exclaimed. A Snakebelt was very precious. Was the guy so lucky that even a Snakebelt jumped into his boat?His eyes bulging, Wang Jie said in a hurry, \u201cYou back off.\u201dHan Fei hid behind them. If the creature ran loose, it would kill these people before it could kill him.Wang Jie approached the cabin and kicked the cover.A shadow swooshed out instantly. Wang Jie roared and snatched it with a glimmering hand.BAM!An invisible barrier appeared before Wang Jie and blocked the charging Snakebelt.Wang Jie\u2019s glowing hand smashed down.The Snakebelt, after being slapped into the deck, still had strength. It tried to flee, when Wang Jie drew his fishing pole and cast the line out, hauling it back.After another slap, the Snakebelt finally passed out.Han Fei was shocked. Could a fish be so tough that even a fishing master could not finish it in one attack?Wang Jie glanced at him. \u201cNot bad, Han Fei. This Snakebelt is dangerous. It\u2019s of little use to you. Do you want to sell it to me?\u201dHan Fei rolled his eyes. \u201cIf you want it, just consider it a gift from me.\u201dWang Jie said solemnly, \u201cThat\u2019s not fair. This is a mid-quality pearl that is basically as valuable as a Snakebelt.\u201dHan Fei kept waving his hands. He knew how the world worked with relations. With other people present, he had to give Wang Jie an out, so he got Wang Jie to give him a fishing pole.The two supervisors couldn\u2019t believe their ears.\u00a0What? A mid-quality pearl for a fishing pole?Wang Jie was a little taken aback as well.\u00a0This poor sod is able to resist the temptation of a mid-quality pearl; if only his talent was better\u2026 SighWang Jie nodded and charged the boat with spiritual energy and said to a guy behind him, \u201cSong Fei, would you please escort him back?\u201dHe wouldn\u2019t have offered the favor if Han Fei had accepted the mid-quality pearl.After the boat ascended, Han Fei looked at the supervisor, who was staring at the minced blade fish.Han Fei rolled his eyes and asked, \u201cBrother, may I know your name?\u201dThe supervisor replied indifferently, \u201cSong Fei.\u201dHan Fei proposed, \u201cBrother Song, this blade fish was minced by the tentacle lobster. It was too strong for me to deal with. I can see that Brother Song likes it. I would like to give it to you as a gift.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dSong Fei was stunned. He had earned a blade fish in this round trip after doing nothing?After a momentary daze, Song Fei accepted the blade fish, assuring him that he could seek him out if he had any troubles in the future.Minutes later, Han Fei cleaned the surface of the boat.Song Fei commented, \u201cYou are rather diligent, although your level is low. After you sell your fish, you can buy a bottle of Fish Head Body Polishing Fluid, or it will be barely possible for you to pass the fishing trial.\u201d\u201cOkay, got it!\u201dHan Fei responded absentmindedly. He was quite upset that all the broken pieces of meat were only worth 142 points of spiritual energy.\u2026The receptionist, seeing that Han Fei was back, said coldly without batting an eye, \u201cYou survived. Not bad. Huh\u2026 So many fish?\u201dSong Fei said, \u201cXiao Qin, the boy was lucky enough to encounter a fish tide. He survived it by hiding in the fish cabin. It\u2019s a major harvest.\u201dThe receptionist smiled. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll have 150 kilograms of them as your tax. You can handle the rest of them.\u201dHan Fei\u2019s heart was bleeding. That was good money!After the boat was completely docked, someone immediately ran to him.Most of them simply greeted Song Fei and asked Han Fei, \u201cHey, boy, I\u2019ll have all of your yellow fish. I\u2019ll give you twenty sea coins for each.\u201dSomeone else immediately pushed him away. \u201cBoy, don\u2019t listen to his nonsense. I\u2019ll give you thirty sea coins for each.

Yellow fish, sixteen sea coins per kilogram; white fish, eight sea coins per kilogram; green turtle, forty sea coins per kilogram. That blade is not for sale\u2026 If you want them, order them now; if you don\u2019t, leave!\u201dSong Fei sneered.\u00a0You want my blade? Keep dreaming!Everyone was surprised that Song Fei backed the boy. What was his background?Soon, all the fish, except for a yellow fish Han Fei reserved for himself, were sold for 1,480 sea coins, which equaled 148 low-quality pearls or one and a half mid-quality pearls.Most of the money came from the green turtles, which were expensive. It was not a lot, but many scoundrels in the port were already looking at him.Han Fei had a headache after he received the money. He had to spend the money as soon as possible, or the money would be extorted from him the next day.Song Fei knew it, too, so he brought Han Fei to Wang Jie\u2019s shop.As a fishing master, Wang Jie was naturally qualified to open a shop. His shop was in the golden area of the district.In the shop, Song Fei said, \u201cOld Guan, I\u2019ve brought business for you.\u201dAn old man, who looked plain but shrewd, came to welcome him.Song Fei shared what happened with the old man. Immediately, the old man grinned. \u201cBoy, it was not easy for you to survive a fish tide. Since my boss promised you a fishing pole, you can pick any of the poles in the shop as long as the price is lower than one mid-quality pearl.\u201dHan Fei couldn\u2019t tell the quality of the poles, but after a quick glance, he noticed that most of them were pegged at 18, 28, 58, or 68 low-quality pearls. There were about ten poles that cost 88 low-quality pearls.There were only three fishing poles with a price higher than 88 pearls. They were labeled with 128, 168, and 188 respectively.Han Fei rolled his eyes and said, \u201cMr. Guan, can I have the one whose price is 128 low-quality pearls? Well, I can pay the extra money if it\u2019s too much.\u201dSong Fei and Mr. Guan both understood. Everybody wanted a good fishing pole. They even thought that Han Fei would choose the 188-pearl one since he had the money!Han Fei ran some calculations. He still had 120 low-quality pearls. There were too many.Han Fei asked, \u201cMr. Guan, do you have any Fish Head Body Polishing Fluid?\u201dMr. Guan was surprised. \u201cYes, but every bottle costs one mid-quality pearl. Are you sure you want one?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cYes.\u201dOld Guan carefully took a bottle of bright green fluid from a box and said, \u201cThis is a real treasure. Even our shop only has a limited number of bottles. Remember, train immediately after you take it. The effect of the drug can last six hours at most.\u201dHan Fei put it into his pocket. \u201cThank you, Mr. Guan.\u201dHe left the shop with an iron fishing pole worth 128 low-quality pearls and a black dagger worth eight low-quality pearls.Song Fei said, \u201cAll right, you\u2019ve spent all of your money. Prepare some food for yourself. I\u2019ll go back now.\u201dSong Fei left, and Han Fei went straight to Zhang Han\u2019s shop in the fish market through the main road.Zhang Han was chatting with someone. He was surprised to see Han Fei. \u201cHuh? You\u2019re still alive?\u201dHan Fei grinned. \u201cI almost couldn\u2019t make it back. Here\u2019s the money that I owe you.\u201dZhang Han was stunned when Han Fei presented twelve low-quality pearls. How did the guy make so much money after a night on the ocean?Huh! Wait, he\u2019s holding an iron fishing pole? That\u2019s good stuff!Zhang Han gasped. \u201cYou were the boy who survived the fish tide?\u201dHan Fei smiled innocently. \u201cIt was pure luck.\u201dZhang Han was so jealous that he wanted to swindle Han Fei out of his money right there, but he couldn\u2019t because Han Fei did not have any low-quality pearls. It wouldn\u2019t end well if Han Fei reported him to the supervisors.Zhang Han said, \u201cAll right, you have money now. Do you want some bait? One low-quality pearl for a box.\u201dHan Fei sneered.\u00a0Are you really taking me for a fool? It\u2019s only worth eighty sea coins in other places.However, Han Fei merely smiled. \u201cManager Zhang, I have eight low-quality pearls left. I would like to buy some bait and clams. Do you have any?\u201dZhang Han\u2019s eyes immediately glittered. \u201cOf course! Brother Zhang will give you a special price!\u201dTherefore, when Han Fei left for home, he carried dozens of clams and two boxes of bait with him. He had apparently spent two more low-quality pearls on them.When Han Fei was almost home, a few scoundrels showed up.As Han Fei expected, someone had been following him since he left the port.A ruthless fatty rubbed his fingers and approached him. \u201cBoy, I\u2019m told that you earned more than a hundred low-quality pearls today, didn\u2019t you? Do you think it\u2019s time you pay your protection fee?\u201dHan Fei grinned. \u201cBrothers, I did make some money, but I spent all of it! I don\u2019t have any sea coins left now.\u201dEnraged, the fatty shouted, \u201cLiar! You spent 148 low-quality pearls in two hours? Who are you fooling? You have no respect for the Tigers?\u201dHan Fei was surprised. How did they know the specific amount he earned?Han Fei raised his fishing pole and clams and said, \u201cBrother, I did spend them! You know that I avoided the fish tide by sheer luck. I dedicated the Snakebelt that I encountered to Master Wang Jie, so he asked Brother Song Fei to shop in his store. All my money was spent there!\u201dThe scoundrels were dazed.\u00a0What? Master Wang Jie asked you to shop in his store?They couldn\u2019t have looked more awful. Considering how lacking in intelligence they were, it was proof that scamming someone really did require skill.Ignoring how Master Wang Jie had scammed a Snakebelt from him, he had even gotten this punk to spend at his store. No matter how the money flowed, it all entered his pockets. This was truly a great scam.The fatty slapped Han Fei\u2019s shoulder furiously. \u201cBoy, be smarter next time. Seven days from now, you will pay me ten low-quality pearls as your protection fee. If you can\u2019t\u2026 Hehe, you\u2019ll certainly regret it.\u201dAfter the scoundrels left, Han Fei sneered.Seven days? Hehe, in seven days, I\u2019ll make you regret proposing such a demand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He intended to cook it, but there were no seasonings in the house except salt.Fine, I\u2019ll just steam it!An hour later, he was full and energetic.Void Fishing? I should be able to level it up now. Let\u2019s see how good you are.Gold light burst out before his eyes. Then, infinite sophisticated words popped up in his head.Right when the art was completed, thunder rumbled in the sunny sky, followed by a huge storm that sprawled over ten thousand kilometers.\u2026Almost at the same time, in a floating city ten thousand kilometers away, someone was calculating in the void.\u201cHuh? An unusual phenomenon in a village under my command?\u201dThen, the man stepped forward and wrote a decree in midair with his hand as the pen.\u201cFrom today on, the resource supply for all villages will be doubled. All academies will pay attention to the talents. Report if you find any\u2026\u201d\u2026At that moment, Han Fei was too pale right now to care if it was raining. When those sophisticated words popped up, Han Fei felt like a balloon that had just popped. He clearly sensed that he had regressed into a level-two fisher.Han Fei was almost crying.\u00a0I have just upgraded an art. Shouldn\u2019t I be rising to the peak of my life? Why have my capabilities declined?But it was not over yet. After briefly staying as a level-two fisher, Han Fei continued weakening until he was no better than a five-year-old.For a moment, Han Fei almost passed out in tears.Huh! Wait, why do I feel that I\u2019m stronger when my level has dropped?Thunder was still rumbling. Han Fei looked at the Demon Purification Pot.It had dropped a level and there was only 104 spiritual energy left.Han Fei gasped loudly when he saw the spiritual energy. He remembered that his basic spiritual energy was sixty points when he was level three. Why was it still sixty now that he was at level one?However his arts had an additional Hook Kiss in Void Fishing.Han Fei immediately sat up straight and began cultivating.After another hour, Han Fei broke through.In only two hours, he dropped from level three to level one and then returned to level three. He seemed the same as before, but only he knew what he had grasped.His body would be modified by natural spiritual energy as he got stronger. Now that his veins and his body were solidified, it was a sign of another breakthrough.However, is it really good to make continuous breakthroughs?\u00a0The moment the idea popped up in his head, he sensed something from far, far away.Immediately, he drank up the Fish Head Body Polishing Fluid.A cool stream circulated through his body, soothing his heating skin.After another quarter, another crack burst out from his body. Han Fei had broken the barrier and become a level-four fisher easily. For the first time in his life, he was an intermediate fisher.Likewise, the Demon Purification Pot had reached level four\u2014an intermediate level. His spiritual energy had increased to 119.Han Fei gasped loudly. He had just reached the new level, and his own storage of spiritual energy was 119 points, which was 50 points more than usual. Was he really going to rise to the peak of his life?Huh? My Spiritual Heritage has become Level One, High Quality?Han Fei was shocked. Could his Spiritual Heritage benefit from the upgrade of his main art?Opening his eyes, Han Fei immediately smelled the stench in the house.He looked at his body, only to see all kinds of sticky dirt and mud.Huh? Is this the legendary Body Cleansing?Han Fei ran out. It was still raining, so Han Fei took a shower in the rainwater.After cleaning up everything, Han Fei boiled two clams and ate them, before he left for school in his hideous clothes.Han Fei suspected that his clothes were made of fish skin. Such clothes were extremely tight.It would be fine for men, but if women were to wear such clothes\u2026Han Fei encountered Hu Kun on the road before he arrived at school.Hu Kun was also stunned to see Han Fei. His face was awful. The guy had become famous after surviving the fish tide yesterday. It was said that he also made a fortune by selling the fish. It would be a waste not scamming him!Hu Kun sneered, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this the level-two fisher who was dragged into the ocean by the green turtle?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If the guy could be so cynical as a twelve-year-old boy, it was unlikely that he would achieve anything in the future. He immediately left.Hu Fei snapped angrily, \u201cHan Fei, stop there! If it weren\u2019t for Tang Ge, you would\u2019ve been crippled years ago. You\u2019re proud of that?\u201dHan Fei stopped. \u201cIs it any of your business? Did I ever eat your yellow fish?\u201dHu Kun\u2019s face was gloomy.\u00a0You indeed did it before. When we were both level-two fishermen four years ago, you ate my yellow fish. Have you forgotten that?However, it was too humiliating to bring it up again. Hu Kun clenched his fists but did not dare to attack. If he accidentally hurt Han Fei, Han Fei could easily report him, with evidence.Looking at Hu Kun\u2019s anxiety, Han Fei said with even more disdain, \u201cWhat a coward.\u201dThen, Han Fei turned around to leave.Before he could walk away, Hu Kun pulled him back. \u201cMake yourself clear. Who\u2019s a coward?\u201dPa!Han Fei slapped Hu Kun right in the face.Hu Kun was stunned.\u00a0Why does it feel so wrong? You\u2019re just a level-two fisher, and you dare to hit a level-six fisher?Hu Kun shouted, \u201cYou attacked me?\u201dHu Kun grabbed Han Fei\u2019s collar and was about to beat him.Han Fei, however, fell back and cried aloud, \u201cHu Kun attacked his classmate so brutally! I\u2019m dying! My internal organs have been terribly injured!\u201dHu Kun had never seen anything like this before!He was stunned when Han Fei dropped himself on the ground. He hadn\u2019t done anything yet!Hu Kun turned around, only to discover that a little girl was observing them not far away.They both knew the girl. She was Lu Lingzhi, their classmate and a level-five fisher.Hu Kun released Han Fei in a hurry and explained, \u201cI-I didn\u2019t hit him! He fell on the ground on his own! He hit me first!\u201dLu Lingzhi rolled her eyes.\u00a0A level-two fisher hit a level-six fisher? You think I\u2019m an idiot?Holding his chest, Han Fei said angrily, \u201cHu Kun, I didn\u2019t know that you were so vicious. I\u2019m going to report you even though I\u2019ve been injured.\u201dLu Lingzhi left without looking back. Han Fei and Hu Kun stared at each other.Hu Kun burst into fury. \u201cYou set me up?\u201dHan Fei suddenly sneered, \u201cWho set whom up? Do you really think I do not know the reason for my injury before the test?\u201dHu Kun\u2019s face changed greatly as he stepped back in panic. If the school discovered it, the consequences would be much more severe.However, on second thought, Hu Kun asked, \u201cWho can prove it?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cIf you can beat me up for no good reason, you could certainly set me up for no reason at all. What will our teacher think?\u201dBlushing, Hu Kun said, \u201cWhen did I beat you up?\u201dHan Fei said mysteriously, \u201cLu Lingzhi saw everything\u2026 Fine, I planned to get it over with between us, but since you\u2019re so angry, I\u2019d better report it to our teacher.\u201dHu Kun almost went crazy. Han Fei had been proud and not nearly as shameless as this. Why had he changed?Hu Kun immediately asked, \u201cYou want to settle it between us? How?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI know that the high-level students are given the Swallowed Spirit Soup regularly. Tsk, tsk. I feel that I\u2019ll have a breakthrough soon. Why don\u2019t you give me your Swallowed Spirit Soup? Right, there\u2019s also the blade fish knife that you owe me. Give it to me, and we\u2019ll be even.\u201dHu Kun\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhen did I owe you a blade fish knife?\u201dA bowl of Swallowed Spirit Soup was precious but not too important, because the breakthrough from level six to level seven required much more than that.Squinting, Han Fei said, \u201cOuch! My stomach hurts! I need to find our teacher\u2026\u201dHu Kun was dumbfounded!What exactly is your problem?Pretending to leave, Han Fei said, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to give them to me? That\u2019s all right. I have Lu Lingzhi as my eyewitness.\u201d\u201cWait\u2026\u201dGloomily, Hu Kun said, \u201cFine! I admit my failure. I\u2019ll compensate you\u2026\u201dHu Kun was of a mind to stuff Han Fei into the blade fish\u2019s stomach. He was not scared of the consequences of a fight, but if Han Fei told other people how Hu Kun set him up last time, not only would Tang Ge seek Hu Kun for trouble, even his teacher would be suspicious.Han Fei felt delighted as he left for school, feeling at ease. He wasn\u2019t worried that Hu Kun would go back on his words. How much intelligence could a twelve-year-old have?\u2026The school on the floating island was different from what he thought. The buildings in it were quite ragged. At the gate of the campus were two statues of tentacle lobsters.\u201cAssemble! Assemble!\u201dBefore Han Fei entered the school, a little girl suddenly forced him to run.Han Fei asked, \u201cHey, who are you?\u201dThe girl glared back at him. \u201cJoin the crowd! You\u2019re the only one not present in our class.\u201dHan Fei finally remembered that the girl was He Xiaoyu, the monitor of his class. Her father was a teacher in the school.Han Fei asked, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, what happened? Why are we gathering so early?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk. Someone from up above has come.\u201dUp above?Han Fei was puzzled as he asked where Tang Ge had gone. She told him that the mentors had brought them to a level-one fishery. It gave him a fright.A level-one fishery was apparently reserved for fishing masters. This showed how much importance was given to Tang Ge!He Xiaoyu squeezed into the crowd with Han Fei, as tens of thousands of students stood there, their heads drawn to the sky.The village leader and all the fishing masters of the school stood at the front.The village leader shouted, \u201cWelcome, angel\u2026\u201dThe hundred fishing masters echoed, \u201cWelcome, angel\u2026\u201dHan Fei did not join them. He simply stared at the sky. In the drizzle, a person stepped down from the sky with two wings, a black fishing pole on his back, and a glowing sword in his hand.Hiss\u2026Han Fei was stunned.\u00a0A real angel? Isn\u2019t it too pretentious?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He can walk on air. How strong\u2026\u201dHe Xiaoyu was also envious. She did not forget to encourage Han Fei. \u201cLook, that\u2019s the legendary Hidden Fisher. One of them is from our village.\u201dHan Fei was surprised. \u201cWhat?\u201dMany people leaned closer to her. They had never heard anything about it before and were interested in He Xiaoyu\u2019s explanation.He Xiaoyu said, \u201cIt\u2019s said that above the grand fishing master, there are Rising Fishers and Hidden Fishers\u2026 Only the Hidden Fishers have such wings.\u201dEveryone was stunned. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard anything about it before!\u201dHe Xiaoyu returned to herself. \u201cStand straight! Even the village leader is too far from their level, not to mention you.\u201dThe village leader, a grand fishing master, was the strongest expert in Heavenly Water Village. It was said that he could travel the level-two fisheries.Han Fei knew that his father was even stronger than the village leader before the man died in the unknown land beyond the level-three fishery.\u2026In the sky, the angel, who was essentially an envoy, stopped and looked down. He said indifferently, \u201cDo you have any Heavenly Talents in your school?\u201dThe village leader replied in a hurry, \u201cThe Heavenly Talents of our school have gone to a level-one fishery for cultivating. They\u2019re coming back as quickly as possible.\u201dLooking into the distance, the angel said expressionlessly, \u201cMy name is Fang Ze. I\u2019m here to look for the most distinguished Heavenly Talents. In the next three days, all children between eight to twelve will have a Spiritual Heritage test. Also, the resource supply for the school will be doubled. I\u2019ll stay here until the Soul Awakening this time.\u201dEveryone went crazy after hearing that. The village thanked him nonstop, and He Xiaoyu clapped her hands next to Han Fei. \u201cWow, the angel is recruiting a disciple! It hasn\u2019t happened in a dozen years!\u201dIn the crowd, Hu Kun\u2019s eyes glowed. It was a great opportunity for him. He was determined to become an advanced fisher in order to catch the angel\u2019s attention.Han Fei did not really care about it since he had his calabash. He scorned that a random person from the sky was respected by them as an angel.After they were dismissed, Han Fei returned to the classroom with He Xiaoyu.Suddenly, a teacher looked at Han Fei and asked in surprise, \u201cHan Fei, you made a breakthrough?\u201dThe teacher was certain. He only asked it because he sensed that Han Fei\u2019s vibe was much more powerful.He Xiaoyu and other students looked at Han Fei in surprise. The guy had made a breakthrough after four years of dawdling?With a smile, Han Fei said, \u201cThank you for your concern, sir. I understood a lot of things after the two near-death experiences, which allowed me to make breakthroughs.\u201d\u201cWow! Finally! Are you level three now? If you work harder, it\u2019s possible that you can reach level four before the Fishing Trial.\u201dHe Xiaoyu was quite delighted. Han Fei was her classmate after all.Someone else said in disdain, \u201cA breakthrough after four years in school. I\u2019ve never seen anyone with worse aptitude.\u201dIgnoring the mockery, Han Fei simply smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m level four now.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dSome were surprised; others doubtful.Even the teacher frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cMaster, I think it\u2019s because I stayed in level two for too long. After I advanced into level three, I reached level four very quickly. I feel that I may have more breakthroughs before the Fishing Trial.\u201d\u201cSeriously?\u201dThe middle-aged teacher immediately beamed. \u201cPunch me.\u201dThat caught Han Fei\u2019s attention. Was he being tested?Without any hesitation, Han Fei roared and punched out, with only fifty percent of his strength, of course.\u201cHuh. You\u2019re truly a level-four fisher now, even stronger than the usual level fours. In such a case, you don\u2019t need to have Tang Ge\u2019s Swallowed Spirit Soup anymore. You can ask for a bowl every five days.\u201d\u201cThank you, sir.\u201dHis other classmates were uninterested. They even felt humiliated that a useless guy had caught up with them. The guy was also confident of another breakthrough? Did he really think that it was so easy?The teacher was naturally not excited. After all, almost every student in the school was a level-four fisher. In fact, few people in Heavenly Water Village above the age of twelve were lower than level five.The greatest obstacle of cultivation was the peak of level six, where most people got stuck. Some couldn\u2019t break through after decades, and some did it in only days. The latter were often praised as geniuses.Obviously, Han Fei was far away from being called a genius.He Xiaoyu was the only one who was happy in the crowd. She circled and surveyed Han Fei while pulling her ponytail, giving Han Fei quite a headache.Han Fei said, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s enough. I still have to continue my cultivation.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cI can teach you! I\u2019m free now anyway! Your results in the last test were too poor. If you can\u2019t pass the Fishing Trial, you will be demoted into a common fisher, and you will lose your share of battle techniques and cultivating resources.\u201dHan Fei stopped walking. \u201cBattle techniques?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cThat\u2019s right! My father said that I\u2019m already proficient with Sweeping Stick now. It\u2019s a Mortal Level, High Quality technique. I can teach you.\u201dHan Fei considered for a moment. Battle techniques could only be learned by intermediate fishermen. Since he was one now, he needed a battle technique.Taking this opportunity, he asked about matters regarding battle techniques.The world had some publicized, with tiers above Mortal Level being High Quality and Ultra Quality. However, the latter two were not something the typical person could obtain.Han Fei wanted to test his strength and chose to battle Xiaoyu. As it turned out, an hour later, Han Fei was sitting on the ground, unable to stand up.His arms, calves, thighs, abdomen, and butt had been hit more times than he could count.Han Fei was surprised that such a little girl could wield a stick so intimidatingly. He used fifty percent of his strength at first, then eighty percent, and then a hundred percent, but she still crushed him easily.Pleased with herself, He Xiaoyu taught him Sweeping Stick.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was better than his iron fishing pole, so he wanted to borrow it.He Xiaoyu clutched her bamboo rod tightly the moment Han Fei mentioned it.Han Fei was amused. \u201cI\u2019m just going to practice with it. I\u2019ll return it to you in the cafeteria later.\u201dHe Xiaoyu was not entirely convinced. \u201cYou\u2019d better, or my father will kill me.\u201dHan Fei\u2019s face changed when he took the bamboo rod, which was significantly heavier than his iron fishing pole.Han Fei immediately understood that He Xiaoyu went easy on him just now, or he would\u2019ve been crippled when the rod hit him.\u2026After this tiny interlude, Han Fei recalled that he needed to claim a debt!Hu Kun and Han Fei were not in the same class. At this moment, Hu Kun\u2019s class was having free exercises. Those who wanted to become Fang Ze\u2019s disciple were all cultivating hard.Han Fei came to the cultivating ground with the bamboo rod.Immediately, a lot of people who were working out saw Han Fei.Hu Kun was gloomy to see Han Fei.Lu Lingzhi was also a bit surprised. She then looked at Hu Kun, feeling that Han Fei was slightly different from before.Ignoring the young man, Han Fei shouted at Hu Kun, \u201cHu Kun, come here.\u201dBefore Hu Kun replied, the young man scolded again, \u201cDid I not hear that I asked you to get lost?\u201dHan Fei finally smiled. \u201cI would be praising you if I said that you\u2019re an idiot. I\u2019m looking for someone else. Is it your business?\u201dEverybody fell quiet.Many girls opened their mouths in shock. Even Han Fei dared to insult someone aloud now?Hu Kun grinned, thinking that Han Fei was dead for sure. This was a cultivating ground where duels were allowed. Did he not know what intermediate level meant?The young man was shocked. Did Han Fei just insult him back?Someone else whistled. \u201cWell, Zhang Ning, he has no respect for you!\u201d\u201cZhang Ning, I would\u2019ve knocked him out already if I were you!\u201d\u201cZhang Ning, you can\u2019t stand a level-two fisher insulting you like this, can you?\u201dThe young man named Zhang Ning sneered. \u201cYou\u2019re good. Since you came with a rod, you must be here for practice, right? Let\u2019s have a game. I\u2019ll show you the gap between us.\u201dLu Lingzhi scolded, \u201cZhang Ning, that\u2019s too outrageous.\u201dShe then turned around to Han Fei. \u201cGo now, you\u2019re at different levels. You can\u2019t defeat a level-four fisher.\u201dHan Fei grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. As it happens, I learned a stick technique today. It\u2019s a good opportunity for me to practice.\u201dZhang Ning hurried to say, \u201cLeave us alone, Lu Lingzhi. This boy has agreed to it. I won\u2019t use any weapons.\u201dJust as Zhang Ning was about to step forward, Han Fei had already slapped him with his bamboo rod.Zhang Ning shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re ambushing me!\u201dBAM\u2026Crack!\u201cAhhhhh\u2026 My neck is broken! My neck is broken!\u201dZhang Ning fell to his knees and cried with a tilted head. Han Fei was too fast for him to dodge just now, and his shoulder was hit by Han Fei\u2019s stick. His collarbone had been dislocated.Glancing at Zhang Ning who was crying, Han Fei said to everyone, \u201cIt was he who demanded a fight! He talked too much and did not use any weapons. Was it my fault?\u201dEveryone choked. They did not know that he was so strong at all.Someone shouted, \u201cThat\u2019s not right. His strength and speed were not level two at all but at least level four.\u201dHu Kun and Lu Lingzhi both changed their expressions. Han Fei had reached level four?Han Fei said, \u201cI didn\u2019t say that I was in level two, did I? Are we done? Hu Kun, come here\u2026\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d\u201cYou think that you can flee so easily after hitting one of our classmates?\u201dA tall guy walked out with a rod in his hand, except that it was of much worse quality than the bamboo rod.The guy pointed at Han Fei. \u201cYou caught him by surprise just now. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so cocky when you have only just reached level four.\u201dThe guy then moved into a defensive stance with his stick.Han Fei chuckled and jumped with the bamboo rod before he smashed it down. He had been beaten by He Xiaoyu all morning and knew how powerful it could be.The guy lifted his rod against Han Fei\u2019s.Clang\u2026The guy stepped back quickly, his hands turning numb.\u00a0Has Han Fei really only just reached level four? Why is he so strong?Lu Lingzhi and Hu Kun both blinked. How could Han Fei be so domineering immediately after his breakthrough?Han Fei did not give the guy any chance to fight back. He simply slashed forward with the bamboo rod without using any tricks.Clang! Clang! Clang!After a couple of hits, the guy\u2019s rod was bent.BAM\u2026The guy fell on the ground after taking a hit from Han Kun.\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re here specifically to challenge us, aren\u2019t you?\u201dAnother guy walked out with a rod. Han Fei squinted slightly. This was a level-five fisher who had mocked him more than once before.However, Han Fei was not scared. Seeing that the guy came at him, he merely struck back in the same way.Clang\u2026Everybody covered their ears at the ear-splitting noise.Han Fei, however, was delighted. This guy was much stronger and sturdier.Han Fei struck unstoppably with the bamboo rod. Now and then, he was hit by the enemy\u2019s rod, but it was nothing because a level-four fisher had enough hardiness. He had been tested by He Xiaoyu for quite a while just now.Someone was dumbfounded. \u201cIs this guy a monster? Why is he so strong?\u201dIn the battle, seeing that hitting was useless, Han Fei decided to sweep. He simply allowed the young man to strike his back before he swept with his full strength.Crack!\u201cAhhh\u2026 My arm is broken! It\u2019s broken!\u201dHe Xiaoyu would\u2019ve been amused if she were here. Her Sweeping Stick focused on technique, but Han Fei simply hit and swept with sheer strength.Seeing the young man cry on the ground, Han Fei finally grimaced in pain. \u201cHu Kun, if you don\u2019t come out, I\u2019ll report you to the teacher.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Physical strength doesn\u2019t matter in the Fishing Trial. You will be demoted into an ordinary fisher if you can\u2019t pass it.\u201dHan Fei patted Hu Kun\u2019s shoulder with a smile, as if he were comforting him. Some students even wondered why Han Fei and Hu Kun were so close.Han Fei asked, \u201cRight, where is my blade fish knife?\u201dHu Kun said, \u201cYou\u2019re really taking it from me?\u201dRegretfully, Hu Kun gave him the knife and declared, \u201cFine, we\u2019re even now. I\u2019ll teach you a good lesson next time we meet.\u201dAfter he had the soup, his spiritual energy reached 196 points, far more than the capacity of his body.Before he finished his meal, Tang Ge rushed to him in a hurry. He took a long breath in relief seeing that Han Fei was fine. \u201cHave you advanced?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cYes. It feels quite good.\u201dTang Ge asked, \u201cYou made it straight to level four?\u201dHan Fei replied, \u201cYes. I\u2019m making progress fast, probably because I stagnated too long.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cWhat about you? How does the level-one fishery feel?\u201dTang Ge replied hopefully, \u201cI have to become a fishing master. Someone acquired the power of a spiritual lobster that increased their cultivating speed by thirty percent. Another got the power of ball fish and had fifty percent more defense ability\u2026\u201dBoth Han Fei and He Xiaoyu were greatly shocked.Han Fei found this world uncannier and uncannier. A human could acquire the power of a fish.However, Han Fei still warned him, \u201cTang Ge, let\u2019s listen to our teachers. If it\u2019s really so great, everyone would\u2019ve absorbed the power of fish long ago, but they didn\u2019t, so there must be disadvantages. We\u2019re only twelve. There\u2019s plenty of time for us to become Hidden Fishers.\u201dShe said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, we can\u2019t be blind. If it\u2019s possible, my father would\u2019ve asked me to absorb it. Let\u2019s focus on the Spiritual Heritage Test!\u201dTang Ge asked confusedly, \u201cWhat\u2019s a Hidden Fisher?\u201d\u2026He Xiaoyu talked a lot about Hidden Fishers and Spiritual Heritage. Hidden Fisher was too far away, but both Han Fei and Tang Ge were interested in her theories about Spiritual Heritage.Spiritual Heritage decided the peak of one\u2019s cultivation. For example, He Xiaoyu\u2019s father\u2019s Spiritual Heritage was Level Two, High Quality, and the village leader\u2019s was Level Three, High Quality.Those whose Spiritual Heritage was above level three had mostly gone to the town. So most people in the village only had poor Spiritual Heritage.Han Fei immediately understood why the former Han Fei was so bad at cultivating. Level One, Incomplete was so horrible that he should\u2019ve thanked god that he could still train himself.Tang Ge did not stay long. He had a meal quickly before he was summoned for the test.He Xiaoyu said, \u201cThose who have reached level seven by twelve have been gathered. It\u2019s said that there are more than a hundred of them. They will probably be given elixirs. Only geniuses can have elixirs.\u201dHan Fei waited for a long time in the classroom, but Tang Ge did not come back. The other people in the classroom were quite unfriendly after they learned that he had reached level four. They were embarrassed that they were surpassed by such a useless guy.Wang Jie entered the classroom at this moment.He glanced at everyone and said, \u201cGather in the playground. You will have the Spiritual Heritage Test.\u201dEverybody was excited and hopeful.The playground was jam-packed with people.Thirty fishermen stood in a row at the front of the playground, a desk before each of them. There was a stone the size of a fist on every desk.The village leader hosted it in person. \u201cListen up, everyone. The Spiritual Heritage Test is of paramount importance. Starting from today, those who have a Spiritual Heritage of Level One, High Quality will be rewarded with a bowl of Swallowed Spirit Soup every five days; those with Level Two, High Quality and Level Three will have a chance to study in the schools in the town; and if anyone has a Spiritual Heritage above Level Three, you will be the pride of Heavenly Water Village.\u201dHan Fei saw Tang Ge and his peers. They were at the front of the lines. Tang Ge intended to go to Han Fei, but the teachers simply asked them to take the test.He Xiaoyu said, \u201cSome of them must have Level Three Spiritual Heritage.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cHow do you know?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cMy father said that there are several of them every year. There was even a guy with Level Five Spiritual Heritage one year. He was directly taken into the city.\u201dIt had already started up ahead.\u201cCao Jia, a level-seven fisher. Spiritual Heritage: Level Two, High Quality.\u201dThe whole playground was shocked that the first student was already Level Two, High Quality. It meant that he could study in the town and rise to greater heights.\u201cLi Rushui. Spiritual Heritage: Level Two, Low Quality.\u201d\u201cZhou Haibo. Spiritual Heritage: Level Two, Mid Quality.\u201d\u2026Dozens of names were announced. Twenty-one of them were Level Two. The rest of them were all Level One, High Quality.Suddenly, someone cried, \u201cThe Spiritual Heritage of Wu Lei, from Class Three, is Level Three, Mid Quality!\u201dEverybody cheered in the playground. Even the village leader stepped forward. Level Three, Mid Quality was almost a guarantee for a grand fishing master.The guy named Wu Lei immediately exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m Level Three, Mid Quality? Haha, I\u2019m Level Three, Mid Quality!\u201dThe other people all envied him. They had no idea that Fang Ze was observing them from a roof far away. He scorned that they were so satisfied with Level Three, Mid Quality. It would be barely possible for them to make it to the city.Another dozen names were announced.Suddenly, everyone\u2019s expressions changed and stood up quickly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Spiritual Heritage\u2026 Seven.\u201dNot that the teacher did not want to announce the level, but he had been too stunned to not stammer after seeing a Level Seven Spiritual Heritage for the first time in his life.The teacher was not alone. Everybody on the playground, including the teachers and the village leader, couldn\u2019t say anything.Hu Kun, who just raised glittery yellow light in the test, was also dumbfounded. He just intended to cry out his result when Tang Ge\u2019s result came in. How could he say anything?\u201cYou\u2019re Tang Ge?\u201dTang Ge nodded in confusion.Fang Ze grinned so hard that his face was splitting apart. In ecstasy, he patted Tang Ge\u2019s shoulder heavily. \u201cYou will follow me for the time being.\u201dThen, Fang Ze turned to the village leader. \u201cHeavenly Water Village will be rewarded for raising this talent. All resource supplies will be doubled from today. The village leader will be given a Spirit Ascension Pill, a Blood Coral Pole, a Crimson Sea Fruit\u2026\u201dExcited, Fang Ze threw out names that other people had never heard before. The village leader almost passed out.Han Fei was happy for Tang Ge when he saw him being taken away.The village leader finally returned to himself after the excitement. Glowing, he shouted, \u201cContinue the test!\u201d\u201cHu Kun. Spiritual Heritage: Level Three, High Quality.\u201dAfter the test for the Heavenly Talents were over, the results instantly became horrible. Those whose Spiritual Heritage was Level One, Low Quality looked awful. It meant that they could only be level-six fishermen at best in their life.He Xiaoyu said, \u201cOnly if your Spiritual Heritage is better than Level One, High Quality can you become a fishing master. All right, it\u2019s our turn.\u201dHan Fei realized something when he saw the brilliant yellow light that He Xiaoyu unleashed. Those with yellow light were no higher than level four.As he expected, the teacher announced, \u201cHe Xiaoyu. Spiritual Heritage, Level Three, High Quality.\u201dHe Xiaoyu\u2019s father was quite excited. His daughter ranked in the top five of the thousand students. He almost laughed aloud in satisfaction.Han Fei walked forward in silence.Wang Jie looked at him and said, \u201cPut your hand on the measuring stone and inject your spiritual energy into it.\u201dIt was a simple process. Han Fei saw that the stone glistened insignificantly.\u201cHuh?\u201dWang Jie said in slight surprise, \u201cHan Fei. Spiritual Heritage: Level One, High Quality.\u201dThe result was so common that nobody paid any attention to it. Wang Jie exclaimed because he thought that Han Fei was Level One, Low Quality at best, or his advancement couldn\u2019t have been as slow.Nobody noticed that there was a black streak on the stone. It could barely be distinguished from the stone itself.Wang Jie didn\u2019t see it, but Han Fei caught it.Han Fei retreated his hand. \u201cSir, what\u2019s the color for Level Four Spiritual Heritage?\u201dWang Jie answered casually, \u201cBlue\u2026 Next!\u201dHan Fei returned in confusion. Below Level Four, it was yellow; between level four and level six, it was blue; above level seven, it was purple. What did black represent?\u201cHan Fei, no need to worry. There\u2019s still hope for you. Although you can\u2019t compare to me, you\u2019re still better than a lot of people.\u201d\u2026In the cultivating ground, He Xiaoyu said, \u201cYou must be defter. Your way of fighting is too violent. We must focus more on technique. If you pour spiritual energy into the weapon, your spiritual energy will be used up after a couple of hits.\u201dHan Fei stopped. \u201cWe can pour spiritual energy into the weapon?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cOf course, but we don\u2019t use spiritual energy in our cultivation. It\u2019s too precious. However, a crisis may happen anytime in the fisheries, so you have to pour spiritual energy into your weapon, and you\u2019d better make the best use of every point of it.\u201dHan Fei was surprised as he asked about matters related to spiritual energy.He Xiaoyu had 142 points now. Theoretically, one could become a level-seven fisher after they broke through 140 points. However, some people choose to train themselves at the peak of level six. It was said that the best guys in the village could reach 159 points while geniuses in the towns even cultivated to 179 points.Han Fei\u2019s heart was pounding. \u201cAre you sure that you have 120 points when you reach level six?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cThat\u2019s right! The standard for level six is 120 points.\u201dHan Fei wondered what his 119 points meant. When he checked the Demon Purification Pot, his face changed.His spiritual energy\u2019s upper limit had changed to 121!Han Fei found it odd.\u00a0Why was the upper limit increased by two points?Was it because of the two bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup? Or was it because he cultivated his body with Swallowed Spirit Soup?Thinking about that, Han Fei grinned. \u201cHe Xiaoyu, can I borrow your bamboo rod?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cYou want to fight again? I won\u2019t give it to you.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cListen, I\u2019ll pay you a bowl of Swallowed Spirit Soup every time I borrow it. How does that sound?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She regretted giving away a bowl of Swallowed Spirit Soup just now, and Han Fei said that he would pay her a bowl if she lent him her rod.She thought that Han Fei was silly. He owed her a Crimson Sea Fruit, and she did not lose any Swallowed Spirit Soup. She was so smart.Han Fei, on the other hand, swaggered away with the rod.One bowl of Swallowed Spirit Soup equaled one point of spiritual energy. Could there be a faster way of advancement?Han Fei kicked in the gate of Class One\u2019s cultivating ground.The students of Class One were furious to see Han Fei.\u00a0You\u2019ve come again? Do you really think we dare not beat you up?Hu Kun asked, \u201cHan Fei, what do you want?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cNothing! I\u2019m happy that I made a breakthrough today, so I\u2019ve come to duel.\u201dHan Fei declared, \u201cWhoever defeats me will have this bamboo rod. It was collected from the bottom of a level-one fishery and is definitely worth ten mid-quality pearls. What do you say?\u201dHe Xiaoyu grew anxious. She pulled Han Fei back and said, \u201cIt\u2019s mine! My father will kill me if I lose it.\u201dSomeone immediately jumped out. \u201cBring it on! You\u2019re rather cocky for a piece of level-four garbage. Han Fei, your bamboo rod is mine.\u201dFew people on the island had a bamboo rod. Most of them were fishing masters. He Xiaoyu\u2019s father only got her one because he loved her. The guy dared not rob her of it, but if he could win it in a duel, it would belong to him.Hum\u2026Their hands glittered, a sign that spiritual energy was emerging.\u201cHan Fei, there\u2019s no turning back now.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI\u2019m not turning back. However, while I\u2019ll give you the bamboo rod if I lose, what will you give me if you fail?\u201dThe young man said, \u201cYou can have my iron rod.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cHow about this? If I win, you need to give me a bowl of Swallowed Spirit Soup.\u201dThe young man thought that it was no big deal. The Swallowed Spirit Soup was offered for free every five days. It was not nearly as precious as the bamboo rod.\u201cAll right, it\u2019s a deal.\u201dThe young man was quite excited. He thought that the bamboo rod was already his. He hit Han Fei rather heavily.However, Han Fei hit back with the bamboo rod equally ruthlessly, with a mischievous smile.BAM!The collision of the two rods caused such a huge blast that the young man was instantly blown away. His rod was broken into halves, and his hands were shaking and bleeding. His face couldn\u2019t be paler.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible! That\u2019s impossible! How can you be so strong?\u201dHu Kun, Lu Lingzhi, and He Xiaoyu were all dumbfounded. The guy was knocked down after only one attack when they were at the same level?Han Fei sneered.\u00a0You really think I\u2019m level four? Why would I challenge you if I was a regular level-four?\u00a0What surprised him was that the attack cost eight points of spiritual energy, which meant a yellow fish!But on second thought, he had won a bowl of Swallowed Spirit Soup, which could increase the upper bound of his spiritual energy storage by one point. That was definitely worth it.Han Fei immediately shouted, \u201cNext!\u201dSome people lost confidence, but the bamboo rod was still too tempting.Another young man stood out. Just as he was about to speak, Han Fei immediately began the fight!Clang\u2026Under the thunderous explosion of spiritual energy, both of them became pale. However, Han Fei swept with the bamboo rod without thinking, unleashing all his strength.His opponent was flung away into the wall, vomiting blood and unable to stand up again.\u201cNext!\u201dHe Xiaoyu was shocked. How could the guy be so good? He only learned the technique this morning! Was he really untalented?Hu Kun looked awful. He was also surprised that Han Fei was so good. He had thought that he could catch the angel\u2019s attention, but Tang Ge stole his thunder. Was he going to be eclipsed by a piece of garbage now? Hu Kun immediately hinted to his friend.\u201cHan Fei, since you\u2019re here for duels, I assume you welcome all opponents. I, Wang Ming, am a level-five fisher, and I also practice Sweeping Stick. Do you dare to duel with me?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cOf course! But since your level is above mine, you need to pay two bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup.\u201d\u201cAll right, two bowls it is.\u201dThe battle began quickly. Han Fei was not scared at all but simply attacked, swept, and pierced just like before.Han Fei launched three heavy attacks at the very beginning. His opponent was rather shocked. Did the guy have unlimited spiritual energy? A level-four fisher was only supposed to have eighty points of spiritual energy.Han Fei\u2019s heavy hits should\u2019ve cost a dozen points each time. How many times had he struck?Clang! Clang! Clang!Everybody blinked every time their weapons clashed. How could the guy still fight?BAM\u2026His opponent was thrown away. Breathing heavily, Han Fei said, \u201cNext! Are there more?\u201dAfter seven consecutive sweeps, Han Fei knocked the guy out again, not giving him a chance to fight back.Everybody was greatly shocked. Han Fei could defeat a level-five fisher?A bunch of people jumped out the next second.He Xiaoyu pulled Han Fei\u2019s sleeve and said, \u201cWait, you can\u2019t fight on. You\u2019ll lose if you continue.\u201dHan Fei smiled and shouted, \u201cWhere is my soup? Why are my four bowls of soup still not here?\u201dEverybody could tell that Han Fei had been worn out. However, the absorption of the Swallowed Spirit Soup would take a long time. How much spiritual energy could Han Fei regain if he drank it now?A few minutes later, the soup was delivered.The students looked awful. They were mad that they lost four bowls of soup so easily.Han Fei gave a bowl to He Xiaoyu. \u201cWe\u2019re even now.\u201dHan Fei chugged the three bowls of soup without stopping.Han Fei took a deep breath and realized that his spiritual energy had reached 300 points. It was a profitable deal.Han Fei shouted, \u201cI feel that I can kill a big meat turtle! Who\u2019s next?\u201dSomeone said suspiciously, \u201cHe must be pretending! Take him down!\u201dThen, Han Fei charged at him with his rod and jumped at him.The guy was astounded. \u201cWhen did I say I want to fight with you?\u201dBAM\u2026After a collision, the guy\u2019s iron rod was broken, and he vomited blood on the ground.\u201cYou\u2019re shameless! When did he say that he would challenge you?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cHe said that he would take me down. That\u2019s a declaration of war. I didn\u2019t know that he was so useless.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201dHu Kun stepped forward and said, \u201cHan Fei, what\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He grinned and said, \u201cFrom today on, I will get back at those who bullied me before. However, if they offer me a bowl of Swallowed Spirit Soup voluntarily, I\u2019ll let bygones be bygones.\u201dHu Kun also wanted to beat Han Fei, but he knew it would be too outrageous if he were to go up. He had to hold back.Han Fei turned around and sniffed, \u201cYou are too weak. None of you are worthy.\u201dEven He Xiaoyu was confused. The Han Fei today was completely different from the Han Fei she knew the past four years. She had heard what happened to Han Fei before and understood why Tang Ge protected him.Had Han Fei really awakened, like he claimed? But why was he so violent after awakening?As a matter of fact, Han Fei was not violent at all. He was merely eating Swallowed Spirit Soup with an excuse. If one bowl of the soup could increase the upper limit of his spiritual energy by one point, would he be invincible after he had a hundred bowls?In the cultivating ground of Class Two\u2026BAM\u2026The gate was kicked open.Han Fei announced, \u201cHey, everyone, let\u2019s make a deal. This bamboo rod of mine is most valuable. Whoever defeats me will have it. Of course, it doesn\u2019t matter if you lose. All you need to do is to give me a bowl of Swallowed Spirit Soup\u2026\u201dA round of mockery sounded like before.Ten minutes later\u2026Everybody was lying on the ground, and a couple of bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup had been placed before Han Fei.Gudu! Gudu!Han Fei looked at He Xiaoyu who was still dazed and said, \u201cDo you want another bowl? The rent for your rod that I proposed seems too petty.\u201d\u2026Han Fei grew famous after half a day. A useless guy had defeated everyone of his level, and even some whose level was higher than his, in all classes.The whole school was shocked.The faculty was having a meeting discussing the arrangement for the geniuses with Level Three Spiritual Heritage, when an intern teacher came in and said, \u201cMaster Wang Jie, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s something you need to take care of.\u201dWang Jie was dazed. \u201cWhat is it?\u201dThe intern teacher replied, \u201cWell, Han Fei from your class fought on campus.\u201dWang Jie chuckled. \u201cHan Fei? Who did he fight with? Mr. Zheng, it\u2019s not unusual for students to practice with each other, or they will be flowers in a greenhouse.\u201dThe intern teacher smiled bitterly. Was it really practice?\u201cNo, Master Wang Jie, he has defeated everybody in his grade. Nobody in his level fights him anymore. He\u2019s now challenging those whose level is higher than his.\u201d\u201cPu\u2026\u201dAll the fishing masters were astounded. What? He defeated a whole grade and even challenged people beyond his level?Wang Jie asked in astonishment, \u201cAre you sure that you\u2019re talking about Han Fei from my class?\u201dThe intern teacher replied, \u201cIs there a second Han Fei in our school?\u201d\u2026When the teachers arrived, Han Fei was shouting at a class, \u201cAre you doing it or not? This bamboo rod can be sold for ten mid-quality pearls, and you only need to pay a bowl of Swallowed Spirit Soup.\u201dHowever, the experts of his level all shook their heads quickly.Han Fei said, \u201cWhat a bunch of cowards. That\u2019s fine. However, whoever bullied me before better give me my Swallowed Spirit Soup in three days, or you will know how merciless my rod can be.\u201dSomeone said grimly, \u201cI\u2019ll fight you.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThat won\u2019t do. You\u2019re a level-six fisher. I\u2019m only level-four.\u201dHaving been enraged by Han Fei, the guy shouted, \u201cI don\u2019t want your bamboo rod! If you win, I\u2019ll give you four bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup.\u201d\u201cDeal.\u201dHan Fei was meaning to find out the gap between him and a level-six fisher. The guy offered him a chance.He Xiaoyu said, \u201cHan Fei, you\u2019re out of your mind. He\u2019s level six. Don\u2019t break your foundation for some Swallowed Spirit Soup.\u201dHan Fei said solemnly, \u201cAm I doing this for the Swallowed Spirit Soup? No, I\u2019m only polishing myself. Only with a strong body can I better survive on the ocean.\u201dHe Xiaoyu blinked.\u00a0Why do I feel that you\u2019re fooling me? You\u2019re obviously doing this for the Swallowed Spirit Soup.One of the mentors said, \u201cHuh! That\u2019s Qin Guang from my class. His Spiritual Heritage was Level Two, High Quality in the test. Han Fei is fighting him?\u201dWang Jie was dizzy himself. Wasn\u2019t Han Fei a level-two fisher? Why could he fight a level-six fisher? Only then did another teacher tell him that Han Fei had broken through to level four.The fishing masters were still chatting when Han Fei and Qin Guang began to fight.Spiritual energy flourished between them. Enormous power burst out between the bamboo rod and the iron rod.Han Fei simply smashed forward, spiritual energy flowing from the bamboo rod. Unable to break his opponent\u2019s defense, Han Fei began to sweep. After a couple of attacks, he changed from sweeping to smashing again.Qin Guang had a lot of abilities, but he couldn\u2019t resist against Han Fei, who was unleashing his spiritual energy without any restraint. Every fisher only had limited spiritual energy. His 136 points had all been used to block Han Fei\u2019s bamboo rod. How could he fight on?After the sixteenth hit from Han Fei, Qin Guang\u2019s rod was finally blown away. Qin Guang was pale. He couldn\u2019t understand why he was defeated by a level-four fisher. Did the guy have unlimited spiritual energy?Not just Qin Guang, all the fishing masters were dumbfounded, too. How could a level-four fisher have so much spiritual energy? Han Fei struck sixteen times in total. Even if it cost eight points of spiritual energy each time, that would be 128 points in total! It was the capacity of level six, not level four!Han Fei, on the other hand, picked up the Swallowed Spirit Soup and had another bowl.Han Fei immediately looked better. The gap between level six and level four was obvious. His opponent\u2019s hardiness was better than his own. If Qin Guang had abandoned defense and fought back, the result of the battle could\u2019ve been different.Han Fei said, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, drink some for me. I\u2019m full.\u201dHe Xiaoyu was almost in tears. \u201cI\u2019m full, too. I\u2019ve had thirteen bowls\u2026\u201dOne of the middle-aged fishing masters found it odd. Why was his daughter involved in this? Also, why did Han Fei\u2019s bamboo rod look like his daughter\u2019s?The other fishing masters were lost for words, too. They had never seen anyone fed with Swallowed Spirit Soup. How many bowls had Han Fei had?Actually, the Swallowed Spirit Soup was of no use to Han Fei now. Han Fei realized it when he discovered that the upper limit of his spiritual energy was stuck at 139 points.However, he could continue his challenges. While the capacity of his spiritual energy couldn\u2019t be changed, the Swallowed Spirit Soup could refill the spiritual energy he lost.A student shouted from the crowd, \u201cHan Fei, you\u2019ve had more than thirty bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup. Do you not need to pee at all?\u201dHan Fei, however, burped and said, \u201cI can hold it back for now. Who\u2019s next?\u201dSuddenly, there was a fierce shout: \u201cHan Fei!\u201dHan Fei said without looking back, \u201cOne at a time. I\u2019m not done with this class yet. Don\u2019t be hasty.\u201d\u201cHow many more classes are you planning to fight?\u201dHan Fei turned around, only to discover Wang Jie as well as a bunch of other teachers.Darting his eyes about, Han Fei said in a hurry, \u201cMaster, I have to pee. I\u2019ll go to the bathroom\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can hold it back. You\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201dHe Xiaoyu rose in a hurry and said, \u201cHan Fei, my bamboo rod!\u201dHan Fei realized that he couldn\u2019t fight on anymore, so he threw the bamboo rod back to He Xiaoyu.\u2026Everybody was relieved after Han Fei left. Finally! Even a level-six expert was defeated by him. Did they have to ask a level-seven expert to crush him? Why was the useless guy so strong all of a sudden?Everybody knew that Tang Ge\u2019s Spiritual Heritage was level seven, but Han Fei\u2019s was only level one. Even if Tang Ge asked the angel to help him, he couldn\u2019t have grown so fast!On the playground, Wang Jie narrowed his eyes and asked, \u201cI can understand your advancement, but what\u2019s with your spiritual energy?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cHuh? Master, my spiritual energy circulates in my body!\u201dPa\u2026Han Fei was immediately slapped in the head by Wang Jie, who was lost for words. Even Fang Ze, who came from the city, could not circulate spiritual energy in his body, and Han Fei said he could?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had never seen anyone who could absorb it as fast. Was it a talent? But if so, why had Han Fei never revealed it until today?Wang Jie said, \u201cAttack me.\u201dHan Fei hesitated, \u201cMaster, I don\u2019t want to waste my spiritual energy on my teacher.\u201dWang Jie said, \u201cYou will do what I ask you to. Enough talking.\u201dHan Fei said gloomily, \u201cMaster, I don\u2019t have a rod. I borrowed He Xiaoyu\u2019s.\u201dWang Jie thought for a moment and said, \u201cWait a moment.\u201dSeveral minutes later, Wang Jie returned and tossed an iron rod to Han Fei. \u201cHit me.\u201dHan Fei knew that he couldn\u2019t squirrel his way out of this. All he could do was waste some of his spiritual energy, striking heavily with an explosive sound.BAM! BAM! BAM!Wang Jie blocked with his fishing pole, at ease. Han Fei\u2019s smashing, sweeping, and piercing couldn\u2019t hurt Wang Jie at all.Han Fei was greatly shocked. How strong would grand fishing masters and Hidden Fishers be if a fishing master was already so strong?Pondering for a moment, Wang Jie said, \u201cYour body is as good as that of a level-six fisher. Is it a naturally endowed talent?\u201dBut he quickly shook his head. Han Fei\u2019s Spiritual Heritage was Level One, High Quality after all. Such a talent couldn\u2019t be of much help. Besides, it remained to be seen whether or not it was Han Fei\u2019s talent.Wang Jie said, \u201cYou\u2019d better stop asking for your classmates\u2019 trouble. Since you\u2019re good at fighting, you can spend more time in the general fishery. Try releasing your hook more than five meters deep, but make sure it\u2019s no more than eight meters deep.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cMaster, shouldn\u2019t I learn battle techniques right now?\u201dWang Jie was amused. \u201cBattle techniques? You want to learn more battle techniques when you haven\u2019t grasped Sweeping Stick yet? Come to me when your soul awakens or when you reach level seven!\u201dHan Fei had temporarily dropped the idea of learning battle techniques. After all the duels, he indeed realized that everybody practiced stick arts.Also, the stick arts were quite brutal battle techniques themselves. Han Fei was quite satisfied with it.Tang Ge did not return. He did not send any messages after Fang Ze took him away.Having devoured almost forty bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup, Han Fei was almost overflowing with spiritual energy, but it was only an illusion.The data in the Demon Purification Pot had soared.Owner: Han FeiLevel: Four (Intermediate Fisher)Spiritual Energy: 1488 (139)Spiritual Heritage: Level One, High Quality (Upgradeable)Main Art: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)Han Fei was excited at the storage of his spiritual energy. He wanted to infer another awesome technique, but his level was too low for him to practice any other battle techniques yet.In the morning, Han Fei left for the port with his fishing pole.The port was as lively as ever.There were three main roads to the port, and all were jam-packed with people. There were also five more ports that were as prosperous as this one.He passed by a stand that sold fragrant snails. It was surprisingly popular.Han Fei clicked his tongue. He didn\u2019t know there were so many rich people.Fragrant snails were snails that lived at the bottom of the ocean. Some fish fed on them, and most fishermen got them by capturing those fish.Of course, some of the more adventurous fishermen would dive into the water and dig them from the bottom of the ocean, even though the bottom of the ocean was full of dangers, such as Snakebelts or poisonous sea snakes.However, returns were the best motivation.Han Fei was in no rush today, so he observed a bit longer. Then he realized that most food here was steamed or boiled without any seasoning. Would he make a fortune if he opened a barbecue shop?Before Han Fei was able to consider the idea, the crowd clamored far away on the main road.Dozens of people came to Han Fei with a middle-aged man at the center.When they were closer, Han Fei saw a giant meat tortoise on the man\u2019s shoulder. He glanced at it and the data popped up.Giant Meat TortoiseNineRegular188 pointsIncreases health; broadens veins.Lousy shellHan Fei was surprised. It was the creature of the highest level that he had seen. The spiritual energy it contained was enormous.Hiss\u2026A lot of people gasped loudly.Someone exclaimed, \u201cHeavens! A giant meat tortoise! How did you get it?\u201dSomeone approached the middle-aged man and said, \u201cBrother, five mid-quality pearls is a fair price. Why don\u2019t you sell it to me?\u201dThe middle-aged man shook his head stubbornly. \u201cThis tortoise is for my son\u2019s cultivation. I won\u2019t sell it.\u201dThe man next to him, who was obviously a merchant, suggested, \u201cBrother, what\u2019s your son\u2019s level? Does he need a weapon or a battle technique? We can trade!\u201dRight then, the crowd was divided.A handsome young man in white clothes came over with a bunch of servants.Seeing them, someone immediately shouted, \u201cThe Wang family! A family of five fishing masters!\u201dSomeone said in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m told that the leader of the Wang family is already a grand fishing master.\u201d\u201cThis giant meat tortoise will definitely go to the Wang family.\u201dThe young man smiled at the middle-aged man. \u201cUncle, why don\u2019t you sell the tortoise to me? I\u2019ll offer you eight mid-quality pearls and a bottle of Fish Head Body Polishing Fluid.\u201dThe man was astounded by the offer.Before the middle-aged man said anything, another bunch of people approached from the other end.The dealers beside Han Fei hurried to clear the way. \u201cIt\u2019s Li Hu, the young master of the Tigers! Get out of the way!\u201dThe Tigers were an infamous gang in Heavenly Water Village. The leader of the gang had a rarely-seen spiritual beast that protected him in the level-one fishery. On the ocean, even the grand fishing masters had to show him some respect.Li Hu glared at the young man from the Wang family. \u201cWang Baiyu, is the Wang family invading the territory of the Tigers?\u201dWang Baiyu was not angry at all but simply chuckled at him. \u201cAre the Tigers allowed to disrupt fair deals at the port? Or do the Tigers think that nobody in Heavenly Water Village can suppress them?\u201dLi Hu said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him if he dares to sell it to you?\u201dThe middle-aged man immediately dropped the idea. He couldn\u2019t afford pissing off the Tigers.Wang Baiyu said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you buy it? I can rob you of it afterward. It will save me a lot of money.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t have looked calmer, but his declaration was most ruthless.Li Hu grinned. \u201cTry robbing me.\u201dThe middle-aged man was quite pitiful. He could crush the two brats easily, but he dared not touch them at all because of their family background.\u201cYou can divide the tortoise evenly!\u201dWhile the two parties were at odds, somebody suddenly suggested this.Instantly, everybody looked at the source of the voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He thought that it was just a tortoise, and that they should respect the uncle who had obtained it through all the trouble.Li Hu\u2019s eyes beamed with coldness. Before he spoke, one of his subordinates scolded, \u201cBoy, who allowed you to talk?\u201dHan Fei was lost for words.\u00a0Are you suggesting that I can\u2019t talk?Wang Baiyu, however, chuckled. \u201cHave the Tigers forbidden everyone from talking? If you dare to touch him, I\u2019ll cut your hands.\u201dLi Hu sneered, \u201cHis suggestion is not bad. I\u2019ll have the shell. You can have the meat.\u201dWang Baiyu scorned with good manners, \u201cWhat are you thinking? Can you make use of the shell? In the whole Heavenly Water Village, only the Wang family has an Armorist. If you can find a second one, I\u2019ll give the shell to you.\u201dLi Hu seemed to have lost interest in debating. He sniffed and said, \u201cBeat them. Whatever is in the Tigers\u2019 territory belongs to the Tigers.\u201dTwo people behind Li Hu unleashed magnificent auras and glowed with spiritual energy, indicating that they were at least level-six fishermen.The two of them charged out like arrows, but halfway through, two swords that were also enshrouded in spiritual energy darted at them.Han Fei stepped back in a hurry. For a moment, he sensed a power that could rip him apart easily.Shua\u2026A cold light flashed, and the two swords stabbed into the ground, with two hands next to them.\u201cArmorist?\u201dLi Hu was appalled. He looked at the crowd, only to see a brawny, middle-aged man walking toward him with an enormous box.\u201cThird Young Master.\u201dThe man approached Wang Baiyu and greeted him respectfully, before he stepped aside.Li Hu said, \u201cGood! Is the Wang family declaring war on the Tigers?\u201dBefore Wang Baiyu could say anything, the middle-aged man replied indifferently, \u201cDeclaring war on the Tigers? Ask your father to make the remark again.\u201dThe folly ended as fast as it started.Wang Baiyu chuckled and said, \u201cRight, Li Hu, I\u2019ll have someone send the meat to your house later.\u201dAll the onlookers were too scared to say anything.The middle-aged man who carried the giant meat tortoise dare not argue. Someone took it away from him and gave him his reward.Li Hu sniffed and walked back coldly.Han Fei stayed where he was, still recovering from the shock. After a flash, two arms fell on the ground. What if the swords were shot at their heads?Han Fei looked at the man who carried the box in astonishment.\u00a0Armorist? What\u2019s that?\u00a0He did not know anything about it.He speculated that he would have the answer when he became a fishing master. He was not hasty.The street was occupied by noise again after the fight, but Han Fei did not want to stay anymore. There were too many secrets in this world waiting to be unveiled, and in order to do that, he had to become a fishing master.In the departure port, it was still the same receptionist.Han Fei said, \u201cSister Xiao Qin, just for me alone.\u201dXiao Qin asked in surprise, \u201cFor yourself? Can you afford the tax?\u201dAlthough she questioned Han Fei suspiciously, she had already begun to register for him.Few people rented boats for themselves, so Han Fei\u2019s boat came fast.He rented an eight-person boat because it had eight fish cabins. If another fish tide took place, he would be in for a treat.Han Fei got on the boat and flew somewhat far away in the general fishery.The general fishery was said to have a length and width of a thousand kilometers, but few people ever made it five hundred kilometers away, because there wasn\u2019t enough spiritual energy for them to control the boat. Even the best fishermen could only reach seven hundred kilometers away.As for Han Fei, he did not intend to go so far away. He planned to go two hundred meters away. If he got too far, he might not be able to return.However, after a dozen minutes, Han Fei discovered, to his shock, that the boat flew further and further beyond his control.\u201cDamn, are you kidding me?\u201dBack in the headquarters of the Tigers in Heavenly Water Village\u2026\u201cYoung master, I guarantee that guy will never return.\u201dLi Hu said, \u201cAll right, got it.\u201dHan Fei did not know that somebody had set him up.BAM\u2026After an explosion, Han Fei discovered that the controller was broken. His eyes almost popped out.\u00a0I can accept that you malfunctioned, but how could you explode?Han Fei was grim. He did not know how far he had flown, but he could not see another boat on the ocean.Also, after the controller exploded, the boat lost momentum and couldn\u2019t float anymore. Shaking, it dropped quickly.\u201cDamn! I\u2019m going to be killed!\u201dThe boat was falling from hundreds of meters high in the sky. Han Fei believed that he was doomed. The boat would definitely smash itself into a pile of wood!Han Fei clutched the edge of the boat in the raging wind. Right before it hit the water, he sprang from the boat and dived into the ocean.He couldn\u2019t be more nervous. The fish in the ocean could be horrifying. If he encountered a blade fish or a Snakebelt, he could be killed any minute.Thankfully, no shoals were around. Even if there had been any, they had been scared off by his sudden dive.The first thing Han Fei did in the ocean was open his eyes and search for the boat. The fall was slower than he had expected. If the boat was of reasonable quality, it shouldn\u2019t be damaged.But an accident did take place. Han Fei saw an enormous green turtle far away that was attracted to him and swimming in his direction. It was twice the size of regular green turtles.Shoot\u2026The creature was only five meters away from him, but it suddenly turned around, as if it had lost interest in him.Han Fei took a breath in relief and hurried to swim upward. However, he immediately saw a few shiny knives.Han Fei felt like crying. He had met multiple blade fish. He dared not move at all, hoping that they would not take him for food, which he did not look like at all.As he expected, the blade fish circled Han Fei and left. One of them even stared at Han Fei for quite a while, as if wondering why it had never seen such a thing before.Han Fei reached for the knife on his waist. Who knew if the blade fish would come and cut him?Seeing no reaction from the blade fish, Han Fei waved his limbs, ready to ascend to the surface of the ocean.When Han Fei swam, he realized that his vision was surprisingly good in the water. Also, his movement in the ocean couldn\u2019t be easier. Were the people in this world naturally born with swimming skills?However, before Han Fei reached the surface, he saw a snake-shaped creature slithering at him fast.Damn! A Snakebelt?Han Fei couldn\u2019t be more unlucky. Green turtles and blade fish were fine. They wouldn\u2019t attack until they were in danger.However, the Snakebelt was different. It liked warm things best. What could be warmer than Han Fei right now? It wanted to pierce his body!Thinking about that, Han Fei dived down. If he were to reach the surface of the ocean, the Snakebelt would strike him easily when he couldn\u2019t see it.Holding his dagger, Han Fei faced the Snakebelt warily.The Snakebelt was circling, and the dense sharp teeth on its head were opening and closing. It seemed to have grown interested in Han Fei.Han Fei\u2019s heart pounded. He tried to calm himself down while he confronted the Snakebelt with his dagger.Suddenly, Han Fei sensed that a shadow was darting at him from the left near his feet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNot daring to ignore it, he stabbed his dagger in that direction. At the same time, he tightened his muscles and covered his body with spiritual energy. He felt lucky that he didn\u2019t upgrade his Spiritual Heritage, or his spiritual energy wouldn\u2019t have been enough.Other people wouldn\u2019t think about that at all. Only the advanced experts above level seven could cover their body with spiritual energy, because it consumed a lot of energy. While ten or so points of spiritual energy were needed to enhance a weapon, at least thirty points were required to enshroud the body.After his body was enshrouded by spiritual energy, Han Fei suddenly seemed to have turned into a fish. His body was no longer affected by the current, and his vision and reaction time significantly improved.Gululu\u2026Han Fei slashed his dagger, but he was still not as fast as the Snakebelt. It opened its mouth and took a bite at his chest.Quickly, Han Fei turned away, slashing his dagger and punching his fist at the same time.Because his speed was better, the Snakebelt was hit, but not very badly. It was only flung half a meter away before it regained its balance.Han Fei quickly turned around, only to see the Snakebelt coming at him again as fast as a ray of light.Han Fei was incapable of any undersea battle techniques. He regretted that he didn\u2019t take an iron rod just now. If he had the rod, he might be able to crush the creature easily. However, since he only had a dagger, he could only use it as a rod.Wu\u2026 Wu\u2026The noise when he wielded the dagger underwater was weird. Han Fei poured his spiritual energy into the dagger and waved it crazily. Although it dealt little damage, the Snakebelt was more or less intimidated.Then, Han Fei\u2019s wrist hurt. As it turned out, the Snakebelt bit him on the wrist, seeing that it couldn\u2019t win a head-on battle.Han Fei did not know that the fish was intelligent. It was scared of Han Fei\u2019s dagger, which was brimming with spiritual energy, so it intended to bite his hand and force him to drop the dagger.Right when Han Fei thought that part of his flesh would be bitten off, Han Fei\u2019s wrist suddenly glittered.A calabash appeared out of nowhere and glowed.As if terrified, the Snakebelt turned around, trying to flee.Han Fei certainly wouldn\u2019t let it go, not after he had wasted hundreds of points of spiritual energy on the creature. Immediately, he grasped the Snakebelt\u2019s tail.Speculating that the tail might be slippery, Han Fei then stabbed his dagger into it.Immediately, the Snakebelt squeaked and dragged Han Fei downward crazily.Han Fei, stunned and caught unprepared, was suddenly hauled to the bottom of the ocean. By the time he realized he should release the tail, he had descended dozens of meters. He felt the pressure of the water.He planned to let it go and swim back up, but after a quick glance, he discovered several Snakebelts, green turtles, and even a meat tortoise in the distance. There was also an assortment of other fish that he had no time to recognize.Not daring to loosen his hands, Han Fei descended deeper and deeper and felt more and more pressure. For reasons he didn\u2019t know, he did not feel any lack of oxygen after fighting for such a long time and being pulled all the way to this place. His body was still functioning normally, and he felt that he could hold his breath for another twenty minutes.However, he certainly couldn\u2019t spend the rest of his life in the water. Seeing that he was about to reach the bottom, Han Fei gripped the dagger and clutched the Snakebelt\u2019s wound. Exerting his strength, he immediately cut the Snakebelt into two parts. Blood gushed out.Having no time to care about the Snakebelt, he swam as far away from it as possible.Several minutes later, fish emerged out of nowhere and bit the Snakebelt. Han Fei watched the ferocious predator be reduced into a long fish bone in the blink of an eye.Han Fei saw coral and swam in that direction. It was too horrible. If dozens of fish were to bite him, he would be nibbled into a skeleton even if he were a fishing master!However, after Han Fei saw the full view of the bottom of the ocean, he was dumbfounded.The bottom of the ocean was full of crimson coral that stretched out for thousands of meters, as well as all kinds of shells.Clams were opening and closing, enormous mussels were sleeping, green crabs half a meter long were watching Han Fei and warily holding their pincers, and sea anemones\u2019 long tentacles were waving in the water.For a moment, all kinds of data was popping up before Han Fei\u2019s eyes.Bloody AnemoneTenRegular1,888 pointsInedible; for pharmaceutical purposes.Dissolved poisons\u2026Ruler CoralTenRegular100 pointsInedible; for forging purposes.Coral heart\u2026Han Fei was overwhelmed by the data. There were too many creatures for him to check!In that moment, a colorful fish was absorbed by a sea anemone. Then dense tubes were stabbed into the fish\u2019s body, turning it into bones.Feeling creeped out, Han Fei stayed as far away from the sea anemone as possible.He turned around, hoping to see something else. But a starfish the size of a basin spun quickly like a top and squeezed into the mud.Han Fei even saw a clam, several meters long, whose mouth was wide open. There was a glittering pearl in it. Han Fei was sure that it was not a regular pearl, because it was glowing.Oh\u2026 Could it be a high-quality pearl?Han Fei observed it carefully.Ghost Blade ClamTenRegular192 pointsIt tastes delicious and can increase physical qualities.Ghost pearl, which can nurture the veins and nerves when eaten.Whoa! This is a real treasure!Han Fei knew that anything that could nurture the veins and nerves was worth dozens of mid-quality pearls. Most people couldn\u2019t afford it in their lifetime.Han Fei looked around. The bottom of the ocean was less dangerous. While many huge fish were swimming around, none of them regarded Han Fei as an enemy. Some little fish were even wandering around Han Fei.Tempted, Han Fei was ready to fetch the pearl.However, a big black fish rushed closer, as if it were going to compete with him for it. Han Fei was rather angry.\u00a0It was not easy to come down here, and you\u2019re competing with me?But Han Fei\u2019s complaint was soon gone. At the edge of the clam, countless sharp teeth appeared and tightened, biting the big black fish into halves frighteningly.Han Fei couldn\u2019t sweat right now, but his head was still dizzy.Is this a trap? What kind of clam has teeth?Han Fei looked at the smaller clams and the big clam and lost interest. No wonder it was named Ghost Blade Clam. Such a huge clam was indeed extraordinary.The undersea species were too weird. He saw certain creatures that looked like nails hopping close from far away like springs.Han Fei knew that they were nail conches that would poke nails at people when attacked. The fishermen had to be extra careful when they caught a nail conch, or they might be penetrated by the nails.Han Fei swam like a fish. He was not scared of the corals, which were unaggressive. He could also use the corals as his shield when in danger. Of course, he had to avoid the corners that he couldn\u2019t see clearly. God knew how many creatures were hiding there.Han Fei only wanted to find a rod, or whatever could be used as a rod.His first idea was to cut a coral, but he couldn\u2019t. He only managed to chop a small piece even after he poured his spiritual energy into his dagger.So hard?Han Fei\u2019s eyes glittered. He cut a long coral with his dagger. If it was made into a rod, it would be much better than an iron rod, although it still couldn\u2019t compare to the bamboo rod.A while later, Han Fei swam among the corals with a coral rod in his hand. He wondered how he could return to the surface of the ocean. He couldn\u2019t hold his breath much longer.Suddenly, Han Fei was stunned by a crimson tree that looked like a coral. Corals were in fact the dead bodies of certain insects. However, the crimson tree seemed much smoother than coral. Han Fei even saw a fruit on it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How could there be so many bones?Yes, there were bones everywhere. Some were fish, some were turtles, and some were human.More importantly, the human bones did not come from one person.When he looked at the fruit on the crimson tree, Han Fei was shocked that data appeared.Purple BambooTenUltra??????Purple Bamboo FruitPurple Bamboo Fruit?Han Fei immediately remembered the Crimson Sea Fruit that Fang Ze gave to the village leader. He didn\u2019t see the fruit clearly, but he saw how ecstatic the village leader was. Fortunately, he had met another marvelous fruit. He wondered how it was compared to the Crimson Sea Fruit.Wait\u2026Han Fei calmed himself down. The bones indicated great danger. Why were those people and animals dead?Han Fei immediately backed off. He saw the knife of a blade fish in the corals.It must belong to the deceased. Other than the knife, Han Fei also noticed some fishing poles and iron rods.Seeing the iron rod, Han Fei immediately drew his fishing pole.The coral rod was for self-defense, but in a battle, it would definitely be too rough and unwieldy. The iron rod, on the other hand, would be much better.Hiu\u2026Han Fei cast the hook out. He caught the iron rod and even tied the line on the rod. That was the difference between a Divine fishing art and a regular fishing art.Regular fishing arts were special tricks that aimed to capture fish. Hook Kiss, on the other hand, could integrate the hook, the line, and the fishing pole and be applied to battles.Han Fei had practiced it before but wasn\u2019t very familiar with it yet. One of his purposes for the trip was to practice Hook Kiss. The effect of the art amazed him.Han Fei dragged the iron rod as well as the blade fish\u2019s knife to him.Although there were human bones, he didn\u2019t see any weapons. He saw several fishing poles, but they were iron ones at best. It would be a burden to carry them.Huh? A turtle shell? The Wang family and the Tigers fought over a shell. That\u2019s certainly good stuff.Casting the hook and pulling, Han Fei changed his face. It weighed more than fifty kilograms!Han Fei\u2019s heart was bleeding. The shell was too heavy for him to carry to the surface of the ocean!Han Fei did not dwell on it. He abandoned the shell and looked at the purple bamboo.Han Fei was tempted. The purple bamboo was a natural material for a rod!Han Fei wondered if he should try to grab it. But what if he did grab it, would there be any trouble?For Han Fei, taking risks was not unusual. He made up his mind to take it.Han Fei cast the hook at the Purple Bamboo Fruit quickly. His heart raced as the hook approached his target\u2026Hiu\u2026The hook reached the fruit, but at exactly the same moment, Han Fei felt that the corals trembled, and a gigantic head extended out of a hole.Sea DragonEighteenRare?????????Tch\u2026 Damn it, a sea dragon? A level-eighteen rare monster? I\u2019m so f*cked.The sea dragon was not a real dragon but one of the strongest sea snakes. As a top-tier demonic snake, it shouldn\u2019t be here at all.Han Fei had no doubt that he was no match for the creature.He immediately tried to retreat the line and run, but the fruit was not pulled to him although the line had been straightened. Seeing that it was possible to take it, Han Fei immediately gave up.He shook the fishing pole and transmitted his power from the fishing pole to the hook. The hook instantly broke free. Han Fei cast it out again, not at the Purple Bamboo Fruit but at another cluster of corals dozens of meters away.The sea dragon dashed out and stared at him with bloodshot eyes, as if it were interested in the small creature that was trying to steal its treasure.Right after the sea snake came at him, Han Fei pulled the hook heavily and swooshed to the other cluster of corals.A strange scene happened in the corals.Han Fei cast his hook now and then, allowing him to leap from one place to another quickly, but whenever he left a place, the corals behind him would be crushed by a giant head.Han Fei cried,\u00a0Brother, I did not intend to steal your stuff. Can we talk nicely?I\u2019m doomed. It\u2019s a dead end.There were no corals ahead. He had reached where he started his exploration.Taking a deep breath, Han Fei quickly swam to the sea anemones. However, the sea dragon was much faster than him. Seeing that it was going to bite him, Han Fei gritted his teeth and flew at the Ghost Blade Clam whose mouth was wide open.Crack\u2026The noise of closing teeth came into Han Fei\u2019s ears. This place was too dangerous.The Ghost Blade Clam\u2019s mouth was aimed at Han Fei, as if it were waiting for Han Fei to send himself over.The moment Han Fei approached it, he sprang and jumped over the Ghost Blade Clam.In the next second, an enormous head bumped into the Ghost Blade Clam.The Ghost Blade Clam would\u2019ve been rendered speechless if it was intelligent.\u00a0How can there be such a huge head? I can\u2019t swallow it at all!Sharp teeth emerged and bit down, only to pierce into the sea dragon\u2019s flesh.Hooo\u2026The sea dragon roared and crashed into a rock.Clang\u2026After an ear-splitting explosion, the Ghost Blade Clam fell from the sea dragon. If Han Fei had the time to look back, he would see that half of the clam\u2019s teeth were gone and there was a hole on its shell. It was basically dead.A green crab was watching, holding its pincers. Having no time to think, Han Fei cast the hook to the crab and threw it to the sea dragon.The half-meter-long crab was chewed into pieces after a bite, but one of its pincers left a wound on the sea dragon\u2019s mouth.Han Fei was anxious. What could he do if it didn\u2019t let go of him? He couldn\u2019t defeat it!Seeing the tentacles of the sea anemones that were floating in the water, Han Fei gritted his teeth.He cast the hook to one of the tentacles. The next moment, all the tentacles began to float.He had threats both ahead and behind.Han Fei hurled himself to the sea anemones, where thousands of tentacles were waiting. He poured all his spiritual energy into his iron rod and slashed. Immediately, the water surged and pushed the tentacles to one side.Exceeding his expectations, a bloody mouth enveloped him right before he fell into the sea anemones.I\u2019m doomed!Han Fei could see nothing but darkness. He had been devoured. The good news was that the coral rod was stuck in the mouth of the sea dragon. As for the iron rod, he had lost it earlier.Damn it. This is so tight\u2026Han Fei couldn\u2019t move at all. The muscles of the sea dragon were constricting and moving randomly. Han Fei hadn\u2019t been swallowed into the stomach yet, but who knew what would happen next?He tried to hold the blade fish\u2019s knife and cut whatever he could reach.BAM! BAM! BAM!The sea dragon struggled hard. After only an instant, thousands of holes appeared on its body.Han Fei wasn\u2019t any better. Some tentacles pierced through the sea dragon and entered his body.Demon Purification Pot, absorb now!Han Fei thought he was done; there was no telling if the Demon Purification Pot worked. But the muscles that gripped him gradually relaxed.Die!Han Fei struggled hard. His body was so sore that he thought his feet had rotted into bones.When he thought of that, Han Fei struggled and waved his dagger crazily.A piece of meat almost fell into his mouth.Pu\u2026 This is bitter\u2026Han Fei had an idea.\u00a0A snake gallbladder?The sea dragon struggled more and more weakly. Under the dual attack of the tentacles of the sea anemones and the Demon Purification Pot, it was impossible for the sea dragon to flee. It suddenly stopped jerking.A glowing shadow cut the skin and jumped out of the creature.Han Fei was covered in blood, but he dared not be careless and cast the hook out the moment he left the body.He swooshed away instantly. Then, the place where he was at was filled by tentacles.Han Fei\u2019s heart pounded. Dozens of holes had been left on his body despite the protection of spiritual energy. In the ocean, blood could be very horrible.Are you still hunting me? Are you still biting me?Blood was surging out. Han Fei saw countless fish swimming over and fled quickly. The sea dragon, on the other hand, was drowned by tentacles and fish.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Han Fei returned to the Ghost Blade Clam and took the pearl away.He then came to the purple bamboo in excitement and plucked it out. It was more like a straight stick than a plant.It was not as difficult to remove as Han Fei thought. He poured spiritual energy into his hands and used all his strength. Eventually, he was able to get it out.The Purple Bamboo Fruit fell the moment he plucked the bamboo. Han Fei felt intoxicated. The intense fragrance of the fruit was attached to his skin through water and leaked into his body, making him sense the aroma.However, Han Fei was too panicked to enjoy it. The smell was too intense even for him. What about other undersea fish? Besides, he had blood all over him. He already saw dozens of green crabs not far away.Gudu\u2026Han Fei stuffed the fruit into his mouth and intended to flee.However, the moment the Purple Bamboo Fruit entered his body, Han Fei felt like he was being boiled. His skin reddened, and he couldn\u2019t possibly feel any hotter.The scorching energy caused the calabash on his wrist to glow. A tremendous amount of energy escaped into his wrist.Han Fei\u2019s muscles tightened. He could almost hear the sound of his blood pumping.Han Fei couldn\u2019t move, but he saw hundreds of green crabs raising their pincers at him.Then, with a crisp sound, Han Fei felt that he had a breakthrough, and his body\u2019s condition was better.The green crabs were still densely packed at this moment.Han Fei was scared. The energy in his body was still on a rampage. Some entered his wrist, and some flowed through his body.Although Han Fei was not in his best state, he could at least move now. Having no time to think, he cast his hook at several big black fish dozens of meters above him. The fish fled under the stimulation, dragging Han Fei upward.After a brief while, the fish turned around and crashed into Han Fei, as if it realized that it couldn\u2019t escape.Shoot\u2026BAM\u2026Han Fei almost threw up because of the collision. He couldn\u2019t hold his breath anymore.I have to breathe in fresh air now.Han Fei struggled to hug the big black fish. He accidentally laid his hands on the scales, and his fingers were cut.Go up!Han Fei stabbed his dagger into the fish\u2019s head. The black fish fled again at the pain, but since its head was controlled by Han Fei, it could only swim upward.Han Fei looked back, only to see all kinds of fish chasing after him. He almost peed himself.The black fish was very fast. After only a minute, it leaped out of the water.Han Fei took a big breath of air. Then, he saw his boat hundreds of meters away, undamaged.\u201cHyah! Hyah!\u201dWith a dagger on its head, the black fish could not do anything except rush in the direction that Han Fei desired.\u201cHurry! Hurry!\u201dA huge mouth bit his calf.\u201cOuch!\u201dHan Fei cried miserably. Having no time to knock the attacker off, he focused all his attention on reining in the black fish.When he was a hundred meters away from the boat, Han Fei cast the hook to the boat and finally pulled himself onto it.BAM! BAM! BAM!He struck a dozen times and killed the fish that had been biting him. He then threw the fish away.\u201cHu\u2026 Hu\u2026 Hu\u2026\u201dHaving no time to bother the blood on his calf, Han Fei lied on the boat with his limbs stretched out. That was too close. He felt it was a miracle that he survived the adventure!Several minutes later, Han Fei sat up in excitement. He felt that his body was full of power.Han Fei looked at his wrist. The calabash was still blinking, but nothing new was revealed. He checked the data.Owner: Han FeiLevel: Five (Intermediate Fisher)Spiritual Energy: 682 (159)Spiritual Heritage: Level One, High Quality (Upgradeable)Main Art: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)Stunned, Han Fei took a deep breath.\u00a0Have I lost eight hundred points of spiritual energy?He gasped loudly. If he had run out of spiritual energy, he would\u2019ve been dead. Also, he just had a Purple Bamboo Fruit that must\u2019ve contained tremendous spiritual energy, yet he only had less than seven hundred points of spiritual energy left?Han Fei weighed the purple bamboo in his hand and wondered how good it was compared to the bamboo rod he previously used.Suddenly, Han Fei felt an excruciating pain in his palm. He opened his hand, only to be shocked.A green calabash was growing out of his body from his palm. It was delicate and slightly smaller than an apple, with a fresh leaf on top.A real calabash?Han Fei\u2019s eyes widened. How did the calabash grow out? He snapped it, only to discover that the calabash seemed to have been stuck to his hand.He put the calabash before his eyes and observed it. Suddenly, it flashed, and Han Fei found himself in a dark void surrounded by countless sophisticated characters. Right before his eyes, there were two vertical lines.Han Fei couldn\u2019t understand the characters, but he did recognize the two lines.Refining.Forge the Universe.\u201cRefining\u201d was the most brilliant and eye-catching world. \u201cForge the Universe,\u201d in comparison, was rather lackluster. Other than them, Han Fei could see more words, but they were unorganized and beyond recognition.Refining?Han Fei suddenly had an epiphany.He needed 2,000 points of spiritual energy to activate the function.Han Fei was relieved. Two thousand points was not too far-fetched for him.Then, Han Fei looked at \u201cForge the Universe.\u201d If \u201cRefining\u201d meant building weapons, what did \u201cForge the Universe\u201d mean?Damn it. Ten thousand points of spiritual energy? Are you robbing me?It meant more than two hundred bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup.Han Fei was lost for words. He had been thrilled about the Demon Purification Pot\u2019s change after absorbing the energy of the Purple Bamboo Fruit, but it was still demanding spiritual energy.Since he did not have enough spiritual energy, Han Fei decided to ignore it. When he opened his eyes, the calabash was already gone, but when he thought about it, it emerged again.Tsk, tsk, tsk\u2026 Interesting. This must be an artifact. I have to keep the secret well.Han Fei finally looked at the big yellow fish next to him.Young Iron-head FishEightRegular42 pointsIt can increase one\u2019s physical strength if it\u2019s eaten over a long period of time.Brains of the iron-head fish, which can accelerate the absorption of spiritual energyAn iron-head fish? Am I in a level-one fishery?Iron-head fish usually appeared in level-one fisheries. They were dangerous and fond of crashing into people or boats. However, this iron-head fish was much smaller than what he saw before.Under normal circumstances, one\u2019s bones would be broken after being knocked into by this fish.Han Fei remembered the crash in the ocean, which nearly squeezed his internal organs out.He tapped the fish\u2019s head with the purple bamboo.Clang\u2026Han Fei tapped it again with greater strength and was finally relieved after the fish head collapsed. It was indeed tough. If it were an adult, he probably would\u2019ve been dead. Judging from the look of it, he was still in the general fishery.Han Fei had been badly wounded, mostly by the gastric acids of the sea dragon. All his wounds were bleeding heavily.Huh? Is it healing?Han Fei checked the bite on his calf, only to discover that the wound was much smaller.After another moment, the wound was even smaller, and the corrupted flesh was recuperating.Is it because of the gallbladder? Or the Purple Bamboo Fruit?After several minutes, Han Fei calmed down and felt that his senses were sharper. His body was also very comfortable.An hour later, Han Fei stood up and warmed himself up, only to realize that his wounds had been half-healed. With this speed of recovery, he would return to peak condition in another two hours.However, Han Fei became grim the next second. He had lost the coral rod, the iron rod, the turtle shell, and the sea dragon skin. He did have the pearl that he collected from the Ghost Blade Clam. Should he eat it to facilitate his recovery?I\u2019d better keep it for now. I should take it when my body is in better shape.Han Fei recalled the treasures at the bottom of the ocean. The clams, the green crabs, the nail conchs, the corals\u2026When I reach higher levels, I\u2019ll definitely go down there again after accumulating several thousand points of spiritual energy.If others learned of his plan, they would think him a lunatic. Even the grand fishing master did not have thousands of points of spiritual energy! Han Fei did not know that the bones he saw at the bottom of the ocean were all fishing masters. They died simply because their spiritual energy ran out. At the bottom of the ocean, even a Snakebelt could kill a fishing master who did not have spiritual energy.After his wounds were healed, Han Fei looked around, only to see no boats around. There were only some birds in the sky.I\u2019ll definitely demand an explanation from the port. How could they distribute a faulty boat to me?However, the journey did have a silver lining. Not only had he made a breakthrough, he also acquired a purple bamboo, which was an ultimate plant!After a brief rest, Han Fei began to fish and practice Hook Kiss again. It was indeed an amazing art that could turn him into Spider-Man at the bottom of the ocean.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHook Kiss was much more powerful than Immobilization.Han Fei had studied it before. Immobilization could make people absolutely calm and steady before their spiritual energy was transmitted to the fishing line and hook. It could also weaken the line and hook\u2019s threat for fish. However, the greatest disadvantage of Immobilization was that it would take a long time, and the fish might break off the hook at any moment.Hook Kiss, in comparison, was much more powerful. As long as one knew a fish\u2019s location, they would be able to cast the hook there as fast as a Snakebelt.Putong\u2026Han Fei tossed a big yellow fish into the fish cabin.He mumbled, \u201cWait, when I cast the hook, I sensed the waves in the water down below. I think I can save some spiritual energy if I cast the hook there.\u201dPutong\u2026Han Fei tossed a seventh yellow fish into the fish cabin.The spiritual energy cost has been reduced by one point. Haha, I\u2019m a genius.Han Fei was very excited. The reduction might be insignificant, but as he fished more and more, he would be able to save a lot of spiritual energy.After half a day, Han Fei used up one box of bait and filled one of the cabins with almost fifty yellow fish. Thirty of them were absorbed by him.Seeing that his spiritual energy had been restored to 842 points, Han Fei stopped absorbing, or he wouldn\u2019t be able to pay his fish tax.No, I can\u2019t catch yellow fish anymore. There\u2019s only one box of green bait. Since it\u2019s already night, I can consider sinking the hook three meters deep.\u2026He caught a green turtle at first, which threw random stones at him. Han Fei tried to block them, but because he was not skilled enough, he was hit multiple times, and his face was pale.If someone else observed him, they would\u2019ve been shocked that he resisted the green turtle with his body instead of spiritual energy.Han Fei knocked out the green turtle and mumbled, \u201cThis is not profitable! I spent six points of spiritual energy on Hook Kiss and had to use another eight to block the stones. I can only earn the same amount of spiritual energy by absorbing the green turtle with the Demon Purification Pot. I should try catching blade fish instead!\u201dHan Fei cast his hook more than five meters deep. He did not know what was out there, but anything would be fine as long as it was not a tentacle lobster.Although the Snakebelt was fast, he could kill it by covering his body with spiritual energy. The tentacle lobster, on the other hand, was much more destructive. He would rather not encounter one.The blade fish was much more difficult to catch than the green turtle was, or its knife couldn\u2019t have been as precious. The blade fish took the bait much less frequently. Also, since the blade fish had only one chance to throw its knife after it left the water, the attack could be brutal, and the odds were slim that one could obtain the knife.Last time, Han Fei was almost chopped by a knife. He would\u2019ve been dead if the knife hadn\u2019t deviated by chance.It was the seventh time that Han Fei cast the hook. Han Fei sensed that a knife was passing the space down before, but he could not use Hook Kiss randomly in case the blade fish cut the fishing line. Waiting for the best moment, Han Fei shook the fishing line like a whip.Get up!Han Fei dragged it hard, and a dark shadow broke out of the water.Hiu\u2026A knife darted at him like cold lightning. Han Fei was long prepared for it. The purple bamboo in his hand glowed and smashed at the knife.Clang\u2026The knife pierced through the deck into the cabin. Han Fei smashed the bamboo at the blade fish\u2019s head. The blade fish was vulnerable without its knife and was killed instantly.This is still not a good deal. The fishing cost six points of spiritual energy, the attack cost ten, but the blade fish can only give me no more than twenty points of spiritual energy. However, its knife can be traded for fifty low-quality pearls, that\u2019s not bad.As night fell, Han Fei caught three blade fish and three green turtles. Half of the box of baits had been used.When he was about to fish again, he heard squeaking sounds from underneath the boat.Han Fei immediately had goosebumps all over his body. He knew perfectly that it was a tentacle lobster.Without any hesitation, Han Fei crawled into a fish cabin. Such lobsters were not very strong but could be very tricky. Their tentacles could attack incessantly like whips. Han Fei was very certain that he would waste a lot of spiritual energy even if he could catch a tentacle lobster. That wouldn\u2019t be a fair deal at all.He thought that the lobster would go, but he heard it crawling to one side of the boat from the bottom.\u201cAre you coming aboard?\u201dHan Fei was lost for words. Had it gotten on the boat even though he didn\u2019t try to catch it?Soon, Han Fei realized that the tentacle lobster had gotten on the boat and was crawling on the deck!\u201cAre you kidding me? I\u2019m the hunter here! But I\u2019m hiding in the cabin and you\u2019re on the deck?\u201dSoon, the tentacle lobster crawled over his head and made obscure noises.Huh? Why do I feel that it\u2019s eating?Han Fei waited for a while, but the sound continued.A moment later, Han Fei heard the sound of fish being picked up from the cabin next door.Han Fei\u2019s face changed greatly. Was it stealing his fish?He couldn\u2019t have looked more awful. The green turtles and the blade fish were kept in that cabin. Even Han Fei hadn\u2019t absorbed any of them yet, but the tentacle lobster was stealing them?\u201cDamn it! You\u2019re asking to be killed!\u201dHan Fei lifted the cover of the cabin and jumped out, unable to hold back any longer.\u00a0Do you know how difficult it was for me to catch those fish?The tentacle lobster, caught unprepared, backed three meters away.The lobster was more than two meters long, with two tentacles even longer than its body. More importantly, there were another two tentacles above them. Han Fei observed carefully, only to discover that it was another lobster, except that it was of a much smaller size.Han Fei cried, \u201cThere are two of you?\u201dHe glanced at them, and information popped up.Tentacle LobsterEightRegular52 pointsThe succulent meat of the lobster can increase spiritual power.Long tentacles, which can be built into whips.Han Fei\u2019s eyelids twitched. He hurried to cover himself and the purple bamboo with spiritual energy.\u201cGet off! Put my spiritual energy\u2026 no, put my fish down!\u201dHan Fei saw that the smaller tentacle lobster was biting a half-meter-long blade fish.Sensing the threat from Han Fei, the bigger tentacle lobster was infuriated and swept its tentacles.Pa\u2026The tentacles whipped the wall of the boat. Han Fei leaped back and smashed the purple bamboo down.\u201cThis is outrageous! You\u2019re bandits!\u201dThe purple bamboo was wrapped up in the tentacles, and the smaller lobster on top seemed interested in whipping him, too.Hum\u2026Spiritual energy emerged from the purple bamboo, allowing him to break free from the tentacles. When the smaller tentacle lobster whipped him, Han Fei swept his bamboo and cut the tentacles with his dagger.\u201cYa\u2026\u201dA tentacle was cut apart. Han Fei took the opportunity to jump on the smaller lobster\u2019s back.BAM! BAM! BAM!Not giving the enemy another chance to attack, he struck the smaller tentacle lobster three times in a row, hitting it into smithereens.\u201cYa! Ya!\u201dHan Fei rolled to the deck quickly, but a tentacle was still whipped at him.Hiss\u2026Han Fei sensed burning pain on his back. He almost passed out under the agony.Sweep!Han Fei wielded his purple bamboo and smashed at the lobsters again.BAM\u2026One of the lobster\u2019s eyes was blown up. It began slapping its tentacles randomly under the pain. Han Fei seized the opportunity to hit the lobster from its back.\u201cYou want to eat my fish? You want to eat my fish?\u201dSeeing another tentacle come at him, Han Fei drew his remaining four daggers and threw them.Soon, another tentacle on the bigger lobster was broken. It struggled and tried to jump into the ocean, but how could Han Fei give it the chance? He jumped again and smashed the lobster\u2019s head until it was deformed.Han Fei cursed at the tentacle lobsters after they had stopped moving, \u201cYou came to steal my fish with your son? You think you can steal my fish so easily?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Fei felt that his back was itchy. When he touched it, he discovered, to his surprise, that his wound was already scabbing.Huh? This doesn\u2019t make sense! I was whipped just now, and the wound is so small?Han Fei touched it, but the wound was gone after only one moment.Hiss\u2026Han Fei remembered the Purple Bamboo Fruit and the dragon gallbladder. One of them must still be effective. Was the advanced healing continuous?After the incident with the tentacle lobsters, Han Fei stopped fishing. He absorbed the remainder of the blade fish as well as the smaller tentacle lobster whose head had been blown up.To Han Fei\u2019s surprise, the smaller tentacle lobster provided 36 points of spiritual energy, which equaled what half a bowl of Swallowed Spirit Soup could offer.The higher level a creature is, the more spiritual energy it will contain.However, after calculation, Han Fei realized that he still suffered a loss. Filling his body with spiritual energy was a major cost in battle. He had also consumed a lot of spiritual energy to launch attacks.Han Fei was upset. Life for an intermediate fisher on the ocean was too hard. He would rather spend all his time in school fighting other people.It remains to be seen whether or not I can return. I should focus on cultivation.The view at night on the ocean was still splendid with the three moons, but it was creepily quiet.The meat of the lobsters were dug out and taken as food. Han Fei sat cross-legged on the deck and started his\u00a0cultivation.The moment he started, Han Fei sensed a stream of spiritual energy entering his body. Most was absorbed by the calabash, but it was still much more than when he was at home.\u201cHuh? Again? It seems that cultivating against the moons is more effective!\u201dHan Fei felt that he had found a great secret. Back on the island, while Void Fishing was much more effective than Soul Fishing, the difference wasn\u2019t too huge.However, the effect of Void Fishing on the ocean with moonlight was significantly better than that on the island. He couldn\u2019t feel the difference when he was a level-two fisher last time, but right now, with infinite spiritual energy surging into his body, he realized how magnificent the art was.It deserves to be called the best generic art. One day of cultivation under such intensity equals other people\u2019s months of cultivation.Same as last time, when Han Fei started his\u00a0cultivation, waves spread out on the surface of the ocean. Fish jumped up now and then.Perhaps because the spiritual energy Han Fei attracted was powerful but not powerful enough, the fish were gathered around him but did not go rampant.Pa\u2026A white fish jumped on the boat and slapped the deck in front of Han Fei.Huala\u2026A yellow fish landed at Han Fei\u2019s side, slapping the deck.Pa\u2026 Pa\u2026 Pa\u2026Another two white fish jumped on Han Fei\u2019s face.Han Fei stopped his cultivation furiously.\u00a0Can\u2019t you just stay in the water instead of slapping my face?He kicked the fish into the cabin, but the moment he stopped the flow of his spiritual energy, dozens of fish began to hop.Han Fei approached the edge of the boat, only to discover that green turtles and blade fish were swimming about aggressively.After a few seconds, the ocean seemed to be boiling. Han Fei was so scared that he sat down and resumed his\u00a0cultivation.When his cultivation started again, the turmoil died down.Han Fei finally discovered that those fish were making use of the spiritual energy that he attracted for his cultivation. He felt that such a way of cultivation was truly dangerous.More and more fish were gathered here. Whenever Han Fei stopped, a riot seemed to happen. He was too scared to stop.Finally, the moons fell, and the first light of the morning glowed from the horizon.Same as last time, Han Fei trembled because of the excruciating pain in his wrist. The calabash radiated and was ignited for three seconds. Han Fei had to stop his cultivation after his hand was set on fire.This time, Han Fei was smart enough to jump into one of the cabins and close it.As expected, thousands of fish jumped and splashed water in the next moment.Blade fish, green turtles, tentacle lobsters, Snakebelts, yellow fish\u2026 There was even a meat tortoise, except that it was too heavy to jump on the boat.The ocean was dyed red by blood for a moment. Too many big fish were falling on the deck. Some of the green turtles were so heavy that the boat was shaking and creaking. Han Fei even suspected that the boat would fall apart.Han Fei was certain that he would be skinned by the fish if he were to go out at this moment.BAM\u2026BAM\u2026After several minutes, the noises were finally over.Han Fei finally opened the cabin carefully. He saw a mountain of broken bodies on the deck. Some living fish were still struggling and catching their last breath.Han Fei looked at the fish in delight. They were not broken bodies but spiritual energy in his eyes. The refining function in his Demon Purification Pot required 2,000 points of spiritual energy, and Forge the Universe required 10,000. He could easily activate them after spending half a month on the ocean.That being said, Han Fei still investigated all the fish cabins carefully. He didn\u2019t find any Snakebelts, but he did find a black ball, to his surprise.The black ball was rolling inside a fish cabin.Ball FishTenRegular290 pointsThe heart of the ball fish is as sweet as sugar and can increase the speed of recovery.Fish splinters, which can be used as a weapon.Two hundred and ninety points of spiritual energy?According to his memory, the ball fish were a special fish in the level-one fishery. They were easy to catch, but they could shoot splinters in all directions when they were in danger. If they ran loose, new splinters would grow out in a couple of days. Few creatures wanted to mess with them.Most people would rather not catch them because they could turn those people into pincushions. More importantly, the fish did not have much meat. Their only advantage was their heart, that could increase the speed of recovery.Han Fei gasped aloud. \u201cHave I come to a level-one fishery?\u201dHe thought for a moment and decided to leave the ball fish alone for now. He closed the cabin and then absorbed the broken bodies crazily.An hour later, all the fish cabins were cleaned up except for those where the yellow fish and the ball fish were kept. Han Fei\u2019s spiritual energy increased to 2,584 points. This was certainly a fruitful trip.Han Fei thought for a moment and made up his mind to kill the ball fish so that he could try refining. He had five knives and a purple bamboo, and he\u2019d better make the best use of them.Han Fei kicked the cover of the cabin and stepped back in a hurry. Next second, three black splinters were shot to the ceiling.So brutal?Han Fei extended his fishing pole and stirred the water. Then, black splinters darted to the ceiling nonstop.Han Fei said, \u201cHey, you\u2019re too silly. What can you do after you run out of splinters?\u201dHan Fei stirred for a long time, until there were no splinters shooting out. He then stirred with the purple bamboo. After five minutes, another few splinters came out.\u201cIs that all?\u201dA few minutes later, Han Fei picked up a soft, slippery dark ball.Han Fei stabbed into it without hesitation. With its gas leaking out, the fish became a big skin after a few seconds.Huh? This thing can be made into a bag.Han Fei cut the heart of the ball fish. It was white and a little bit hard. Was it really worth 290 points of spiritual energy? He touched it and sensed spiritual energy flowing out.Naturally, Han Fei wasted no time throwing it into his mouth. It was better for him to take it than to give it to the Demon Purification Pot.After he took it, Han Fei sensed that his spiritual energy was much higher. He checked it and found it to be 2,856 points. Han Fei was rather surprised. Shouldn\u2019t there be more since he had taken it orally? Was it because the ball fish had lost all the splinters? That must be the reason.Han Fei did not know that the heart of a ball fish could be sold for three mid-quality pearls. If he had known, he would probably die before he took it.Besides, few people took the heart orally. If the heart was used as an ingredient to make drugs, its effect would be more than doubled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter clearing the last fish cabin, Han Fei had a spiritual energy storage of 3,241 points, which was enough for him to travel to the bottom of the ocean another three times.Of course, he couldn\u2019t be so lucky every time. The sea dragon, the Ghost Blade Clam, and the sea anemones were all very formidable.Leaning against the broken controller, Han Fei studied the Demon Purification Pot.Looking at the apple-sized calabash, Han Fei meditated.\u201cActivate.\u201dTwo thousand points of spiritual energy immediately vanished. Han Fei sensed a hazy mist in his head. When the mist exploded, new understandings popped up in Han Fei\u2019s mind.There seemed to be a burning furnace in the void. Han Fei had the feeling that he could store anything in the calabash and put together amazing combinations.In the meantime, an idea came Han Fei\u2019s mind.Furnace of the Universe: With the universe as the furnace and the spiritual energy as the fire, anything can be built into a weapon.Han Fei swallowed. With the universe as the furnace? That sounded rather impressive.However, when he thought of the introduction to Void Fishing, he calmed down. After his transmigration, he had learned to accept the unacceptable.Han Fei looked at the purple bamboo, the knives from the blade fish, the iron fishing pole, and his ragged clothes. Since he had five knives from the blade fish, he stored one of them in the Furnace of Universe.The moment the knife disappeared, he saw a hazy space in the calabash where the knife was floating.\u201cForge.\u201dA fire rose immediately. Within a breath, a palm-sized dagger drifted out.\u201cSo quickly?\u201dHan Fei opened his eyes and saw a dagger falling on his hand.\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201dHan Fei was somewhat astounded.\u00a0My half-meter-long knife was reduced into a small dagger?Han Fei picked up the knife. For some reason, he felt that the knife was suitable for him.Trying to test how good the small dagger was, he cut another knife with the dagger, only to widen his eyes. The knife had a huge dent on it.So good?Han Fei looked at the purple bamboo and decided to test it again.Ding\u2026After a slight tap, Han Fei checked them carefully. Neither the purple bamboo nor the dagger was damaged.Han Fei was immediately reassured. The purple bamboo must be of a high level.He looked at the Demon Purification Pot, only to be shocked.\u201cTch\u2026 I have only 1,053 points left? It cost me 188 points?\u201dHan Fei hesitated. He was delighted at the result, but the cost was enormous. How much would the purple bamboo cost when a knife had cost so much?Gritting his teeth, he stored the purple bamboo in the Furnace of Universe and tossed the remaining knives in it. He needed a weapon, and he couldn\u2019t use He Xiaoyu\u2019s bamboo rod all the time.Han Fei took a deep breath. He still had a cabin of yellow fish. If the spiritual energy was not enough, he could still absorb several hundred points.Han Fei began forging and wondered what he would get in the end.After a moment, the calabash glowed, and a purple stick floated out.Han Fei felt greatly weakened, but he did not feel the urgent need to absorb spiritual energy. He was greatly relieved.After taking a closer look at the purple stick, Han Fei was immensely satisfied. It was silver on both ends and purple-red at the center.He realized that the two ends must be made of the knives, and the middle part was made of the purple bamboo.Purple Bamboo Rod (Mortal Level, Mid Quality)Note: Made with a 280-year-old purple bamboo and blade fish knives, it can launch sharp blade auras.Mortal Level, Mid Quality? Weapons are classified in different levels, too? It does make sense, on second thought. However, isn\u2019t the purple bamboo an ultimate treasure? Why is it Mortal Level, Mid Quality now?Han Fei observed it carefully and weighed it. It was over forty kilograms and could serve as a magnificent weapon.When Han Fei grasped the rod, he felt that he had used it for years. He tried wielding it. It was slightly heavy but very handy.Han Fei, delighted, practiced Sweeping Stick. The weapon rattled and radiated as he poured his spiritual energy into it.At this moment, the purple bamboo rod seemed to have turned into part of Han Fei\u2019s body. His limbs and his body could control and react to the rod precisely.After wielding it for an hour, Han Fei felt that he was more and more familiar with it. He now also understood the essence of Sweeping Stick.If He Xiaoyu were here, she would\u2019ve been greatly surprised, because Han Fei\u2019s Sweeping Stick had reached a whole new level at this moment.\u201cThis feels good\u2026\u201dHan Fei stopped and fell on the ground after an exclamation. The world was swirling before him, and acids were surging from his stomach.He looked at the Demon Purification Pot, only to smile bitterly. He had used up his spiritual energy after the practice.Owner: Han FeiLevel: Five (Intermediate Fisher)Spiritual Energy: 0 (159)Spiritual Heritage: Level One, High QualityWeapon: Purple Bamboo RodMain Art: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)Seeing the number, Han Fei staggered to the cabin where yellow fish were kept and grabbed a yellow fish.A moment later, the whole cabin was cleared, and his spiritual energy returned to 144 points.Yes, a whole cabin of yellow fish only provided 144 points of spiritual energy for him.Han Fei felt like crying. He earned three thousand points of spiritual energy by risking his life twice, but he had spent all of them in less than two minutes.He saw an enormous pit before him. The refining function alone had stripped him of his spiritual energy. What could Forge the Universe, which required 10,000 points of spiritual energy to be activated, bring him?Han Fei had a feeling that he needed to worry about spiritual energy all the time in the future. Other people spent several points of spiritual energy at a time, but he spent thousands of them each time although he was only a fisher. How could he make ends meet?Han Fei sighed and smashed his rod at a corner of the boat to unleash his fury. However, it hit the controller of the boat accidentally, and the wooden cover on it was broken.Han Fei thought that he was doomed. The boat was damaged in the first place. Would he be demanded compensation for his strike?Huh?While Han Fei wondered if he should compensate, he saw a block on the controller that was cut by a knife instead of smashed by his rod.Han Fei examined it for a long time. Then, his face turned cold.The fault was not natural?Who wants to kill me?The first person he thought of was Hu Kun, but then he shook his head. Hu Kun indeed hated him, but such a little kid wasn\u2019t capable of this. Besides, the guy did not know when he left the island, nor could he sabotage a boat that belonged to the island.But who else could it be if not Hu Kun? Han Fei did not remember pissing off anyone else.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter floating for another day, Han Fei used up his remaining bait and caught nine yellow fish, three green turtles, and a blade fish.The ratio would\u2019ve been unbelievable if he told it to anyone else. There were only forty pieces of bait in each box, and most people could only catch five fish with them. It was unimaginable that Han Fei caught thirteen fish, including a blade fish, with only half a box of bait.Actually, Han Fei only wasted the bait on the blade fish and the green turtles several times. None of the yellow fish was able to escape from his hook.It was night again.Han Fei couldn\u2019t fish anymore now that his bait was used up. He started his cultivation.Just like the previous times, he was surrounded by fish that jumped to his boat now and then. At dawn, he intensely absorbed spiritual energy again, which caused a riot.So, he had another boat of fish the next morning, although no special fish came to him.After leaving a cabin of fish as his tax, Han Fei increased his spiritual energy to 1,200 points.Han Fei dared not be extravagant again. Although he had three more knives, he dared not forge them again, or he would be bankrupt.It was Han Fei\u2019s third day on the ocean. There was still nobody around. He did not know where he was at all.On the fourth day, Han Fei\u2019s boat was already ragged after the three fish tides. One of the fish cabins had even been broken by a green turtle. Two giant holes were left on one side of the boat, too.Han Fei was bailing out the water that came in through the holes at this moment. He knew that the boat couldn\u2019t survive the fifth fish tide. It was now shaking and could fall apart at any moment.In the afternoon of the fifth day, Han Fei was practicing the stick arts on the boat. After three days, he was even more familiar with the technique.In the meantime, he discovered that the progress of his arts required spiritual energy, too. However, since Han Fei had more than 2,000 points of spiritual energy at this moment, he couldn\u2019t care less about it.Tilting his head, he noticed quite a few boats far away. Immediately, he waved his rod and cried, \u201cHey! Hey! Brother! Sister! Uncle! Save me!\u201dHan Fei roared at his loudest.\u2026\u201cThird Young Master, there\u2019s someone over there.\u201dWang Baiyu said, \u201cI see him. Interesting. I didn\u2019t expect to see someone fishing alone so far away. Let\u2019s go and take a look.\u201dHan Fei was excited to see them coming near. It was not easy to meet someone else on the boundless ocean.After the boats approached each other, Han Fei and Wang Baiyu looked at each other.\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201dWang Baiyu was stunned. Wasn\u2019t it the boy he met on the road the other day? He only took a look at the boy because he was the one who broke the silence back then.Han Fei was also surprised. The third young master of the Wang family, who had five boats protecting him on his fishing trip?Wang Baiyu squinted at Han Fei\u2019s boat, which was more like a shipwreck than a boat. He was surprised that it hadn\u2019t sunk yet.Wang Baiyu said, \u201cBrother, you\u2019re quite a fisher! You came eight hundred kilometers away alone?\u201dHan Fei gasped. \u201cWhoa\u2026 I\u2019ve come that far?\u201dWang Baiyu was slightly surprised. \u201cHuh? You didn\u2019t know?\u201dHan Fei said with a helpless smile, \u201cMy boat malfunctioned and brought me to this place on its own. I\u2019ve floated for five days on the ocean.\u201d\u201cHow many days?\u201dWang Baiyu\u2019s subordinates were stunned. He floated for five days alone without being killed?Few people in Heavenly Water Village could spend five days on the ocean alone and return alive. There were only one or two of them every year.Wang Baiyu immediately sensed that something was wrong. \u201cYour boat malfunctioned? That\u2019s unlikely. Our boats are propelled by natural floating stones. They will never malfunction as long as the stones are there\u2026\u201dBefore he finished, Wang Baiyu saw Han Fei raise a stone at him.Han Fei said, \u201cAre you talking about this?\u201dWang Baiyu\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYes\u2026 But your floating stone is broken. Huh? It was cut into halves, which resulted in the disruption of power transmission\u2026 You were set up.\u201dWang Baiyu declared without any hesitation.He then added, \u201cTo destroy a floating stone, you have to be at least a peak fisher, with a good weapon. Of course, it will be easier if you are a fishing master. However, most fishing masters have better things to do.\u201dHan Fei\u2019s heart grew heavy. At least a peak fisher? When did he piss off such an expert? Was the father of someone he beat up at school seeking revenge for his son?Suddenly, Han Fei had an idea. Was it the Tigers? Li Hu did glare at him when he left the other day.Han Fei said, \u201cBrother Wang, thank god you\u2019re here, or I would probably die in the ocean.\u201dWang Baiyu was very interested in Han Fei. He smiled warmly. \u201cHow did you survive five days on the ocean?\u201dHe looked at Han Fei\u2019s boat again. It was a miracle that such a pile of wood did not fall apart.Han Fei heaved a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story! The ocean is indeed horrifying. I encountered a fish tide that almost crumbled my boat. I would\u2019ve been killed if I hadn\u2019t hidden in the fish cabin.\u201d\u201cA fish tide?\u201dWang Baiyu\u2019s subordinates grew solemn. Another fish tide had happened? Did it mean that a crisis was going on in the general fishery?Han Fei naturally wouldn\u2019t tell them that it was he who caused the fish tide. Wang Baiyu observed Han Fei and thought that a man with a blade fish knife and an iron fishing pole couldn\u2019t be too weak. Besides, Han Fei\u2019s rod also looked extraordinary.Wang Baiyu said, \u201cBrother Han, your rod seems rare.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cIt\u2019s a gift from my brother. It\u2019s only slightly better than an iron rod. I\u2019m sure Brother Wang has much better weapons.\u201dWang Baiyu was naturally not convinced, but he was more decent than to rob a total stranger. He looked at Han Fei\u2019s boat curiously.\u201cHuh? Brother Han, your boat is still full of fish?\u201dHan Fei said without blushing, \u201cThey jumped on my boat during the fish tide. However, since my boat has been terribly damaged, I think they\u2019re barely enough to cover compensation costs.\u201dWang Baiyu shook his head. \u201cYour boat was deliberately destroyed. Somebody will investigate it. You don\u2019t even need to pay the fish tax. However, do you have any rare fish on board?\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cYou\u2019re looking for rare fish, Brother Wang?\u201dWang Baiyu said, \u201cTruth be told, I\u2019m looking for rare and mysterious fish in the general fishery on this trip.\u201dHan Fei replied, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have any. I did have a ball fish during the fish tide, but I couldn\u2019t deal with its spurts. It jumped back into the ocean in the end.\u201dWang Baiyu was obviously disappointed. Ball fish were not too rare. The Wang Baiyu had plenty of them.Han Fei asked, \u201cBrother Wang, do you purchase fish? Since my boat can\u2019t move now, I can sell my fish to you at a lower price.\u201dWang Baiyu smiled calmly. \u201cWhat do you have?\u201dHan Fei counted: \u201cI have seven knives, six green turtles, a small octopus, a jellyfish, three whelks\u2026\u201dSome jumped onto the boat on their own, including the small octopus. The jellyfish was caught by accident. As for the whelks, they were discovered in the stomachs of the dead fish. Together, they were worth some money.Wang Baiyu was immediately shocked. \u201cYou\u2019ve kept seven knives after the fish tide?\u201dHan Fei replied, \u201cYes. There were even tentacle lobsters, but alas, they ran loose. Right, I had a few tentacles. The lobsters left them during the fight with the blade fish.\u201dWhat Han Fei offered was worth eight mid-quality pearls. That might not sound like too many but was actually a lot. Even the descendants of a great family usually did not have so much money with them.Wang Baiyu immediately nodded his head. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll take them. However, I don\u2019t need the yellow fish and the like. If you want, I can help you bring them back. It\u2019s very easy for me.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI could use your help. Thank you very much.\u201dWang Baiyu and Han Fei were not friends. He was only doing Han Fei a favor. He cleared a boat for Han Fei and asked one of his subordinates to escort Han Fei back.After Han Fei left, a subordinate asked, \u201cThird Young Master, why do you treat him so nicely? It was unnecessary for us to purchase those things at all.\u201dWith intelligence that did not befit his age, Wang Baiyu explained, \u201cDo you not feel suspicious that an intermediate fisher has an enemy who\u2019s a peak fisher or even a fishing master? Usually, people only have enemies of their own level. Besides, you really think it\u2019s possible to avoid a fish tide by hiding in the cabin?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Being rescued was good enough for him. The only bad thing was that he owed the guy a favor.In the departure port, the receptionist was surprised to see Han Fei.The receptionist asked, \u201cIt\u2019s been five days, you\u2019re still alive?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cSister Qin, it\u2019s a long story. My boat was deliberately damaged\u2026\u201dHan Fei explained everything quickly. The receptionist frowned, her face cold and expressionless.She said, \u201cI\u2019ll have someone investigate it. If it\u2019s true, the Supervision Department will give you an answer.\u201dAs Wang Baiyu said, the port did not levy fish tax on him, because Han Fei\u2019s indictment still required investigation. If it was fake, Han Fei would have to do much more than paying fish tax. If it was true, the port authorities wouldn\u2019t let go of whoever sabotaged the boat.Han Fei left the port with seven mid-quality pearls, six of which were from Wang Baiyu.Han Fei\u2019s return did not catch any attention. Instead of going home or to school, Han Fei decided to increase his capabilities since Wang Baiyu mentioned that his enemy could be a peak fisher.He was not so desperate before, but it was impossible for a level-five fisher to defeat a peak fisher who was multiple levels higher than him, if not a fishing master, whatever his weapon was.After an hour, Han Fei walked to the business area in the western port of the island, where he found a blacksmith.A brawny man with exposed arms smiled at him. \u201cBrother, what can I get you?\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cCan you coat my rod with iron?\u201dUnlike He Xiaoyu, Han Fei did not have a fishing master father, who ensured that her bamboo rod wouldn\u2019t be looted. Although Han Fei could count on Tang Ge, he did not think that it would be easy to meet Tang Ge again after Fang Ze took him away.The blacksmith was amazed by Han Fei\u2019s purple bamboo rod. \u201cWhere did you get this rod? Wow, it\u2019s so extraordinary!\u201dHan Fei said warily, \u201cOne of my seniors gave it to me, but I found it too high profile. Uncle, can you coat it or not? If not, I\u2019ll find someone else!\u201dThe blacksmith said, \u201cOf course I can! But this is a great rod as it is. Is your senior a fishing master?\u201dNarrowing his eyes, Han Fei said, \u201cA little bit higher.\u201dThe blacksmith lowered his voice, \u201cA peak fishing master?\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cUncle, are fishing masters the best experts you\u2019ve seen?\u201dThe blacksmith was shocked. \u201cYou mean the village leader? That\u2019s impossible. The village leader doesn\u2019t have a nephew.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cUncle, do you really think that there is only one grand fishing master in Heavenly Water Village?\u201d\u201cEesh\u2026\u201dThe blacksmith changed his face greatly. Some people said that the grandfather of the Wang family became a grand fishing master a long time ago. The leader of the Tigers was also reaching for the level of grand fishing master. Was this boy related to them? Or were there more hidden experts in Heavenly Water Village?Han Fei said, \u201cUncle, certain things are best left unknown, do you understand?\u201dSeeing that Han Fei was proud and confident, the blacksmith nodded. At the very least, Han Fei\u2019s look was rather convincing.The blacksmith said, \u201cI can do that. It will only take a moment.\u201dHan Fei waited for a quarter. He was quite satisfied with the rod once it was entirely blackened. Ignoring the blacksmith\u2019s puzzled looks, he disappeared into the crowd.What Han Fei did not know was that the blacksmith locked the door and left immediately after he left.Han Fei visited many stores before he finally left the western port and returned to the eastern port he came from.After returning to the place that he was familiar with, Han Fei finally cursed the expensive service aloud, which cost him eighteen low-quality pearls.In Wang Jie\u2019s store, the manager was calculating the accounts when he saw a familiar person. Wasn\u2019t it his boss\u2019s student?\u201cMr. Guan, what are you busy with?\u201dMr. Guan said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you. Why, are you rich again? What would you like to buy?\u201dHan Fei asked in a low voice, \u201cMr. Guan, is there anything better than the Fish Head Body Polishing Fluid here?\u201dMr. Guan immediately asked in surprise, \u201cBetter than the Fish Head Body Polishing Fluid? Do you want the Spirit Refilling Pill? Can you afford it?\u201dHan Fei was surprised that something was indeed available. He asked interestedly, \u201cMr. Guan, I\u2019ve earned some money. How much is the Spirit Refilling Pill?\u201dMr. Guan said, \u201cThe Spirit Refilling Pill can quickly refill three hundred points of spiritual energy. It\u2019s mainly sold to the peak fishermen. Why do you want it? Besides, every pill costs two mid-quality pearls. Can you afford it?\u201dHan Fei was rather shocked. Two mid-quality pearls for three hundred points of spiritual energy? That was too expensive.However, Han Fei still asked, \u201cMr. Guan, how fast can the Spirit Refilling Pill refill spiritual energy? It\u2019s rather expensive.\u201dMr. Guan smiled. \u201cIt only takes ten seconds. Two mid-quality pearls is actually a fair price.\u201dHan Fei chuckled. \u201cMr. Guan, is there anything better? Do you have anything that can nurture the veins or increase spiritual energy?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re quite a dreamer, aren\u2019t you? Even if they are available in my store, they will be reserved by my boss\u2026 Huh, there\u2019s a bottle of Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid that is of no use to my boss anymore. I can sell it for six mid-quality pearls, since you\u2019re my boss\u2019s student.\u201dHan Fei\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cMr. Guan, I would like that.\u201dHe took six shiny mid-quality pearls from his pocket.Mr. Guan was immediately shocked. \u201cYou\u2019re just a student. Where did you get the money?\u201dWithout thinking, Han Fei said, \u201cMy brother gave it to me! My brother was recruited by the angel as a disciple for his Level Seven Spiritual Heritage. He gave you a couple of mid-quality pearls.\u201d\u201cAh. Tang Ge is your brother?\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cMr. Guan, do you know my brother?\u201dMr. Guan said, \u201cOf course. Who in Heavenly Water Village doesn\u2019t know Tang Ge? His Spiritual Heritage is too good even for the town. Wait, if you are his brother, why don\u2019t you ask him for it instead of buying it in my store?\u201dHan Fei pretended to smile bitterly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t buy it if I could meet him. Angel Fang Ze has been keeping him busy. With the Fishing Trial coming, I can\u2019t waste all my time waiting!\u201dMr. Guan nodded. \u201cIt does make sense. Since you are Tang Ge\u2019s brother, I\u2019ll give you a 10% discount on this bottle of Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cWow! Thank you, Mr. Guan\u2026\u201dMr. Guan looked at Han Fei thoughtfully and said, \u201cI know that you are eager in cultivation, but you must not be anxious. The Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid is designed for peak fishermen. You\u2019d better not try it until you\u2019re level six and not use too much at once. Also, you must not make a breakthrough with the Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid. It\u2019s a medication for cultivation, not for breakthroughs.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cGot it. Thank you for your concern, Mr. Guan. I would like to buy another two bottles of Fish Head Body Polishing Fluid.\u201dHan Fei felt like weeping after he left the store. Training was truly costly! He thought he was rich just now, but in the blink of an eye, he had only 42 low-quality pearls left, which were not even enough to buy a knife.However, Han Fei was much more relaxed now that his money had been spent. He bought two big whelks, ten clams, and several kinds of sauces. In the end, he had only six low-quality pearls left.Han Fei mumbled all the way home.If it weren\u2019t for Tang Ge\u2019s celebration, he wouldn\u2019t buy anything so expensive as big whelks. Two of them cost 24 low-quality pearls. His heart was bleeding.\u201cThey\u2019re just big whelks. I can catch several hundred of them later and make a fortune with them. They\u2019re everywhere at the bottom of the ocean.\u201dWhile Han Fei muttered to himself and approached his home, he saw several people at the gate of his house from far away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His face immediately turned grim.\u201cHey! Brother Gang, that guy is back!\u201dPa\u2026The fatty threw the shells to the ground heavily. \u201cBrat, do you know that I came for you yesterday? Where is the protection fee that I asked?\u201dHan Fei shivered in fury.\u00a0I was on the brink of death several times, and when I finally come home, you\u2019re eating my food. Is it fair?Han Fei grinned coldly, \u201cFive low-quality pearls for each clam. I\u2019ll let you go if you give me the money, or I\u2019ll beat you until you pay for them.\u201dThe fatty and his lackeys were dazed. Then, they burst into laughter.\u201cBrother Gang, did he just ask us for money?\u201d\u201cBrother Gang, this guy is crazy. Is he threatening us?\u201dWith a wicked smile, the fatty bared his teeth and chuckled. \u201cBrat, did my ears just deceive me, or was your brain damaged by an iron-head fish? You\u2019re threatening your Brother Gang?\u201dDong\u2026Han Fei was much more confident now. The guy might be a level-seven fisher, so what? It was not such a challenge after he killed a sea dragon.Han Fei drew his purple bamboo rod and declared, \u201cDo you want to spill your blood in my place?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dBrother Gang and his people were about to mock Han Fei again, when the purple bamboo rod glowed in Han Fei\u2019s hand.Brother Gang changed his face. \u201cBrat, you\u2019re truly bold. Brothers, take him down!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201dHan Fei jumped and struck with the purple bamboo rod heavily.\u00a0You think I\u2019m too old to wield a rod?Before Brother Gang realized what was going on, one of his level-five subordinates had already been hit. The man cried, holding his shoulder, \u201cAh! My arm is broken! Brother Gang, my arm is broken!\u201dBrother Gang burst into fury. \u201cAre you asking to be killed?\u201dAll of them picked up their rods. How could they be defeated by a child who was terribly outnumbered?Clang! Clang! Clang!Han Fei had 159 points of basic spiritual energy and a storage of more than three thousand points. What could he possibly be scared of?I\u2019m going to kill this fatty!BAM!One of the gangsters filled his body with spiritual energy and tried to take Han Fei\u2019s attack the hard way.However, after a crack, the man fell on the ground and vomited blood.Brother Gang became alarmed. \u201cNot good. This boy is at the peak of level six. Let me.\u201dThe fatty slashed an iron rod at Han Fei. Outside of his expectations, Han Fei felt that his arm was numb. His face slightly changed. Was the guy a level-seven fisher?Brother Gang was also stunned. \u201cYou\u2019re rather strong, but you don\u2019t know how good a level-seven expert is at all. Sweeping Flash Stick!\u201dInstantly, a Snakebelt seemed to be slithering on the fatty. Next moment, the fatty\u2019s combat ability significantly increased. His speed was twice as high.Han Fei was shocked. How could a man so fat be so fast?Clang! Clang! Clang! BAM!Han Fei was forced to step back for the first time. Although he felt that he was no weaker than the fatty, he could not bear the fatty\u2019s six consecutive attacks at the same time.\u201cCough\u2026\u201dHan Fei\u2019s arm was numb, and blood flowed on his lips.Brother Gang sneered, \u201cLevel-seven experts can loot the power of demonic fish. You think I do not have any power? Boy, kneel and submit all your belongings\u2026 Fine, since you do not have any belongings, give this yard to me, and I will spare you.\u201dHan Fei took a deep breath. He still had his recovery ability, although it was much weaker than previously.He grinned. \u201cIs it the only thing that level-seven experts are capable of? How weak are you?\u201d\u201cAhhhhh\u2026!\u201dInfinite spiritual energy surged out from Han Fei. Both he and his rod glowed as he leaped and smashed again.Clang\u2026Brother Gang said, \u201cBoy, you are killing yourself. You\u2019re only a level-six fisher. Filling your body with spiritual energy alone will cost one third of your spiritual energy. How many more times can you strike?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cYou really talk too much\u2026\u201dClang! Clang! Clang!Han Fei smashed at him six times crazily without stopping. He was hit once in return, which made his chest hurt.The fatty breathed heavily. His previous attacks only caused a minor injury to Han Fei, but the boy went crazy and struck another couple of times. How much spiritual energy did the boy have?Han Fei did not stop there. He swept, and the spiritual energy spread out in ripples.Dum! Dum! Dum!Pu\u2026The rods collided thunderously. Brother Gang vomited blood and lost control of his iron rod.His eyes were full of disbelief. How was it possible? How many times had the boy struck while filling his body with spiritual energy? It must\u2019ve cost more than two hundred points of spiritual energy!BAM!Han Fei dispersed his spiritual energy and whipped the fatty. All the other gangsters were stunned. Had Brother Gang been defeated?Han Fei squatted before Brother Gang and grinned. \u201cDo you still collect protection fee from me?\u201dSweating hard, Brother Gang said, \u201cIt\u2019s a misunderstanding. Brother, it\u2019s totally a misunderstanding.\u201dBAM! BAM! BAM!Han Fei bashed Brother Gang three times and knocked him to the ground. \u201cA misunderstanding? Are you sure it\u2019s a misunderstanding?\u201dBrother Gang grimaced in pain but dared not fight back. \u201cBrother, I can compensate you. I guarantee that I won\u2019t look for you for trouble anymore.\u201dBAM! BAM! BAM!Han Fei yelled, \u201cWho\u2019s your brother?\u201dBrother Gang said, \u201cMaster Han! Please forgive me, Master Han!\u201dBAM! BAM! BAM!Brother Gang trembled.\u00a0Why are you still beating me? I will be crippled if you don\u2019t stop!Brother Gang begged for mercy. \u201cMaster, please spare me! I can give you my girlfriend\u2026\u201dHan Fei did not know what to say.BAM\u2026Gloomily, Han Fei said, \u201cLeave your money and your iron rod here and get lost.\u201dBrother Gang wept. How could he have imagined this happening? Why did the guy pretend to be so weak a few days ago?Brother Gang said, \u201cMaster, I only have an iron rod\u2026 Here you are. Please don\u2019t point it at me. I\u2019m scared.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI\u2019ve wasted too much spiritual energy on you. Your iron rot is not nearly enough to compensate for my loss. You\u2019d better get as far away as possible.\u201d\u201cYes, of course. Why are you still here? Go!\u201dHan Fei was secretly surprised when the fatty rose and ran agilely. Was it the power of the demonic fish that he mentioned? If the fatty had stored enough spiritual energy, the result of the battle could\u2019ve been different. His weird power doubled his strength. Han Fei only defeated him because he had much more spiritual energy than his enemy did.No, I underestimated the advanced fishermen. They are called advanced for a reason. The fatty was defeated by me because of insufficient spiritual energy. What if he were a level-eight fisher?For the second time, Han Fei felt that he had been improving too slowly. Even a gangster could reach level seven. How many such people were out there in this world where everybody cultivated? He was only a Mr. Nobody, and he had to work hard to change that.Han Fei entered the room and saw a note on the table left by Tang Ge.I won\u2019t be back for the time being. There\u2019s something in that place you know. I\u2019ll see you at the Fishing Trial.Han Fei shredded the note and reached the back of the house.Behind the house was a cliff, with a trail less than half a meter wide. An iron chain was hanging on the trail. Han Fei grabbed the chain and descended carefully for about ten meters. Then, an inconspicuous cave whose entrance was covered by bushes lay before his eyes.The cave had existed before the house was built. Every time Tang Ge found anything good, he would hide it in the cave instead of the house in case it was stolen.The cave was four meters deep and three meters wide. There was a small bed and a stone tank where dozens of clams were kept.On the bed, Han Fei saw a small package.Han Fei gasped after he opened it. Two mid-quality pearls rolled out first. They were probably all the money that Tang Ge had.Besides the two mid-quality pearls, there were also two books, an iron box, and a bottle.Han Fei gasped again, because the covers of the two books said\u00a0Swimming Art\u00a0and\u00a0Mystic Body Technique. After only a quick glance, Han Fei already knew why they were important. Most fishermen in Heavenly Water Village practiced stick arts. Even if there were books about other arts in the school library, there couldn\u2019t be too many. Whatever the two books were about, they couldn\u2019t be any worse than Sweeping Stick.Huh? A Spirit Refilling Pill?Han Fei picked up the bottle and smiled. He said to himself, \u201cI do have a good brother.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Spirit Refilling Pill was very precious. Each of them cost two mid-quality pearls at Wang Jie\u2019s shop. Now, he had a whole bottle of them. Although he could have fifty yellow fish for the same amount of spiritual energy, it would take him a couple of days on the ocean. With the ten Spirit Refilling Pills, he could get three thousand points of spiritual energy easily.He opened the iron box, and the cave was immediately filled with fragrance. Han Fei\u2019s eyes widened. Was it Crimson Sea Fruit? Han Fei was certain that it was not a Purple Bamboo Fruit, although its aroma was also entering his body through his skin.Han Fei\u2019s heart pounded. Was it a fruit on the same level as the Purple Bamboo Fruit?He stared at it, only to see no data. Did such a treasure have no data representation?Even so, Han Fei was still excited. The Purple Bamboo Fruit had changed the Demon Purification Pot and given him a thousand points of spiritual energy. He did not expect Tang Ge to leave a treasure as good as that to him.Han Fei closed the box in a hurry. He could not take it recklessly. Back at the bottom of the ocean, the spiritual energy in the fruit was so overwhelming that his body overheated. It was certainly not a good feeling.Han Fei held back his urge to swallow the fruit and turned to the two books.Swimming Art?Han Fei was slightly surprised. It was a book that taught how to swim fast. It was not exactly a technique.Han Fei learned from the book that ordinary people could only hold a hundred breaths, and only the grand fishing masters could hold a thousand breaths at the bottom of the ocean. He spent half an hour in the ocean, which was more than a thousand breaths. Did a breath denote a different time length in this world?Han Fei did not think too much. Swimming Art was quite useful after all. If he had known it better, he wouldn\u2019t have been so devastated in the ocean.After reading it carefully, Han Fei suddenly had a strange feeling.Huh? Why do I remember it so clearly?Han Fei looked at the list of arts on the Demon Purification Pot.Existing Battle TechniquesExisting Arts: Swimming Art (Mortal Level, High Quality)Note: It\u2019s a mediocre, generic swimming technique based on multiple other swimming techniques. To infer the ultimate technique, you need to spend 1,000 points of spiritual energy.Superseding Art: Wandering Dragon ArtProgress: 0/1,000\u2026Han Fei was excited. Could battle techniques be inferred, too?While 1,000 points of spiritual energy was a lot, such a life-saving method was definitely worth it.Han Fei said, \u201cInfer it.\u201dSpiritual energy surged out, and Swimming Art changed.Existing Arts: Wandering Dragon Art (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)Note: It simulates the movement of unpredictable fish and dragons with spiritual energy\u2026Han Fei was interested. Could all arts and battle techniques be inferred to higher levels?Also, the results were all Divine Quality.However, what quality was Divine Quality exactly? He Xiaoyu said that above High Quality was Ultra Quality, and nothing was above Ultra Quality. It was obviously incorrect. Neither He Xiaoyu nor her father had access to the levels above Ultra Quality.I\u2019ll practice the technique when I go to the ocean next time, well, or maybe when I surpass the peak of level six.Wandering Dragon Art could not be put to use immediately. Han Fei turned to Mystic Body Technique, the other book.After Han Fei read it carefully, the upgrade requirement for Mystic Body Technique popped up in his head.Existing Arts: Mystic Body Technique (Mortal Level, High Quality)Note: This body-conditioning art can fortify and harden the major acupuncture points over the body to stop spiritual energy from leaking.Drawback: The foundation can be ruined when the major acupuncture points are hardened.Superseding Arts: Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body ConditioningProgress: 0/2,200\u2026\u201cEesh\u2026\u201dHan Fei gasped that it required 2,200 points of spiritual energy to infer the book.He also sweated when he saw the drawback in the system. The foundation would be damaged? That would definitely hinder future advancement.Tang Ge couldn\u2019t have tried to harm him, so he might be unaware of the drawback. It would be terrible if he practiced the technique. Han Fei decided to remind him next time they met.Han Fei couldn\u2019t feel more awful.Two thousand and two hundred points of spiritual energy? Are you robbing me? Could you be better than Void Fishing?Fine. Stuff inferred with so much spiritual energy can\u2019t be anything bad.Han Fei said, \u201cInfer it.\u201dSpiritual energy surged out again, and the interface changed.Existing Arts: Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Conditioning (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)Note: Every human has 108 acupuncture points, and 36 of them are critical. This art can seal the critical acupuncture points and keep natural spiritual energy inside.Drawback: The following arts cannot be inferred unless corresponding body-conditioning arts are found.\u2026Han Fei was delighted. It was a great deal.He did not know that there were so many critical acupuncture points on the body. If he could repair them, he would definitely be sturdier than most people. At the very least, he wouldn\u2019t worry about being ambushed.However, when he saw that he had only 142 points of spiritual energy left, Han Fei felt awful. Upgrading a random technique had cost him thousands of points of spiritual energy. What could he do if he had more techniques in the future?Han Fei shook the idea out of his head. He was in desperate need of strengthening his body, and Tang Ge\u2019s help couldn\u2019t be more timely.Han Fei studied the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing, which contained 108 stances.He immediately stood straight in a weird posture. His face changed after the first movement as he felt that his muscles tightened and stretched.The second\u2026 The third\u2026 By the time Han Fei reached the eighth stance, he breathed so heavily that he could barely continue. It was much more difficult than he had expected.Han Fei sat on the ground, sweating hard.Right then, Han Fei heard voices coming from above.\u201cBrother, this is the place. That brat lives here.\u201dHan Fei grew alarmed. It was the fatty Brother Gang\u2019s voice.BAM\u2026The gate was kicked open.Then, someone asked indifferently, \u201cWhere is he?\u201dBrother Gang said, \u201cHuh? He was here just now. Where could he possibly run to?\u201dThe indifferent person said, \u201cA-Gang, did the boy really defeat you with the strength of level six?\u201dBrother Gang said, \u201cBrother Dong, it\u2019s true! That guy seemed to have infinite spiritual energy. He struck dozens of times but did not even need to catch his breath.\u201dThe guy called Brother Dong remarked after a brief silence, \u201cInteresting. A-Gang, order someone to watch the place. This guy must have a treasure with him. It\u2019s up to you whether or not we can obtain it.\u201dThe voices were gone. Han Fei\u2019s heart became heavy. He shouldn\u2019t have been so gentle. The fatty did not learn his lesson at all.Han Fei knew better than to come out and fight the people above. The man named Brother Dong was at least a level-eight fisher, or the fatty wouldn\u2019t have been so obedient.Fatty, you\u2019re good, I\u2019ll remember you now.Han Fei held back his rage. They did not know that he was a level-five fisher, or more people would\u2019ve come. It was unbelievable that a level-five fisher defeated a level-seven fisher who absorbed the power of a demonic fish.Han Fei gritted his teeth and drank a bottle of Fish Head Body Polishing Fluid. He had to speed up his cultivation.Immediately, Han Fei felt that he was full of power. The next six hours were critical for him.Han Fei resumed his cultivation. Although his muscles still ached because of the stretching, Han Fei was able to persist with the infinite power in his body.Han Fei was covered in sweat by the time he completed 36 movements.He seemed to have just been picked up from the ocean when he completed 72 movements.After he completed 108 movements, Han Fei\u2019s muscles cramped, and he fell on the ground in pain.Damn it. My whole body is spasming. What kind of body-conditioning technique is this?Han Fei meant to pass out, but his brain was highly active with the tonic. It was not until ten minutes later that Han Fei\u2019s spasm was finally over.Hooo\u2026Han Fei breathed heavily on the ground. This art was too horrifying.When Han Fei looked at the Demon Purification Pot, he was astounded.Owner: Han FeiLevel: Five (Intermediate Fisher)Spiritual Energy: 398 (167)Spiritual Heritage: Level One, High Quality (Upgradeable)Weapon: Purple Bamboo RodMain Art: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)\u2026\u201cWhoa! My capacity of spiritual energy has been increased by eight points after I only practiced it once! This is amazing!\u201dHan Fei was stunned. It only increased by one point after he had a bowl of Swallowed Spirit Soup, but eight had been added after he practiced the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Conditioning once.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the day, Han Fei practiced the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing.At night, Han Fei practiced Void Fishing and drew natural spiritual energy into his body.After only one day, Han Fei felt that he could advance to level six. He sensed an obstacle that he could jump over easily.But Han Fei didn\u2019t. According to He Xiaoyu, one could go deeper into every phrase. Some talented people could defeat enemies above their level exactly because of their solid foundation. Since he only had Level One Spiritual Heritage, if his foundation was not good enough, his future development would definitely be affected.Han Fei ran out of the Fish Head Body Polishing Fluid on the second day. He sipped the Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid and immediately blushed. It was much stronger than the Fish Head Body Polishing Fluid. Han Fei felt like that his body was about to explode.Han Fei immediately practiced the 108 stances.After he practiced them three times in a row, the redness on Han Fei\u2019s face was finally gone.Han Fei looked at the Demon Purification Pot.Owner: Han FeiLevel: Five (Intermediate Fisher)Spiritual Energy: 506 (189)Spiritual Heritage: Level One, High QualityWeapon: Purple Bamboo RodMain Art: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)\u2026189?Han Fei grinned. This art that cost 2,200 points of spiritual energy was definitely worth it. He had achieved more in three days than other people could in three months.He had a feeling that he could crush Brother Gang with only three hits right now.Not only had Han Fei\u2019s capacity for spiritual energy increased, but his body was also strengthened every time he completed the cycle of 108 stances. Some impurities had even been discharged.Han Fei even sensed that if he practiced it longer, it could even boost the growth of his Spiritual Heritage and save the upgrade cost of 1,000 points.Although the impurities discharged were not as many as last time, they were still a lot. After they were eliminated, Han Fei looked much healthier.After practicing the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Conditioning again, Han Fei realized that it could not improve the upper bound of his spiritual energy anymore.Suddenly, Han Fei\u2019s expression changed.Not good, I can\u2019t hold back now.Han Fei had such a strong thirst for spiritual energy that he felt like a dry desert that was in need of rain.He immediately sat cross-legged and activated Void Fishing with the Spirit Refilling Pill laid before him.\u2026Night gradually fell.A fatty approached Han Fei\u2019s house.\u201cBrother Gang, you\u2019re here?\u201dBrother Gang asked, \u201cIs the boy still not back?\u201dHis lackey shook his head. \u201cNo! He seems to have disappeared. Right\u2026 A level-six little girl just dropped by. She left since the door was not answered.\u201dPa\u2026Brother Gang slapped his lackey\u2019s head. \u201cAre you an idiot? Why didn\u2019t you catch the girl? She must be the boy\u2019s friend!\u201dFeeling wronged, his lackey said, \u201cBrother Gang, we tried to, but we couldn\u2019t! The girl had a bamboo rod. She smashed Er Gou to the ground when he approached her. She\u2019s not a simple girl at all.\u201d\u201cA bamboo rod? She smashed Er Gou to the ground?\u201dBrother Gang changed his face. \u201cShe\u2019s impressive for her age. A bamboo rod\u2026 Does she have a fishing master parent?\u201dSuddenly, Brother Gang asked confusedly, \u201cHey, do you feel that the spiritual energy here seems more intense than before?\u201dHis lackey said, \u201cHasn\u2019t it always been this?\u201dPa\u2026Brother Gang slapped his head again. \u201cYou\u2019re both stupid and insensitive. However, the change of spiritual energy is indeed not very significant. It\u2019s probably because the natural spiritual energy is particularly intense tonight.\u201d\u2026Whilei Brother Gang and his lackey were chit-chatting, Han Fei was having the \u201csugar bean.\u201dThe five hundred points of spiritual energy that he gathered naturally had been used up during his breakthrough. Incessant spiritual energy was entering his body, and he had a Spirit Refilling Pill in his mouth, but to Han Fei\u2019s surprise, his spiritual energy was used up again after only a minute.Han Fei was dumbfounded.\u00a0What\u2019s going on? Why does the breakthrough to level six require so much spiritual energy? Didn\u2019t they say that the breakthrough to level seven was the real challenge?It was truly easy to break the obstacle to level six. The only unbearable part for him was that the spiritual energy required for the breakthrough was too enormous.After taking three Spirit Refilling Pills in a row, Han Fei finally realized that it couldn\u2019t help. Also, it was a waste to use Spirit Refilling Pill in a breakthrough. They could save his life in a crisis. What could he do if he used them up right now?Han Fei turned to the iron box. Did he have to take it?\u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201dHan Fei made a decision after only brief hesitation. Judging from the speed of consumption, even the ten Spirit Refilling Pills wouldn\u2019t be enough.Han Fei swallowed the fragrant fruit and immediately trembled. The spiritual energy from the fruit passed through his body.With enough supply of spiritual energy, Han Fei reached level six within ten seconds. The calabash on his wrist flashed as if it were breathing.Same as last time, Han Fei\u2019s body was soon burning up. Since he was not in water this time, sweat was pouring out. Had it not been for the Demon Purification Pot that was absorbing the spiritual energy of the fruit, he would\u2019ve exploded.However, Han Fei could sense that his power was rising. His bones were itching, and his bone marrow was flowing. He speculated that the fruit was improving his body hardware, but the itchy feeling did not last. The fruit did not seem good enough.The process lasted about five minutes, before he digested the rarely-seen fruit.Han Fei did not feel sorry at all. He was a level-six now, and one of the better level-sixes.He immediately looked at the Demon Purification Pot.Owner: Han FeiLevel: Six (Intermediate Fisher)Spiritual Energy: 2308 (219)Spiritual Heritage: Level Two, Low Quality (Upgradeable)Weapon: Purple Bamboo RodMain Art: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)\u2026Han Fei immediately gasped. The capacity for his spiritual energy had increased by thirty points. Could a level-eight fisher have so much spiritual energy?Han Fei suspected that his capacity for spiritual energy was beyond comprehension.More importantly, his Spiritual Heritage had changed from Level One, High Quality to Level Two, Low Quality. It was a leap across levels thanks to the two fruits he had. Han Fei even sensed that his Spiritual Heritage could further improve if he had more such fruits.However, after checking the upgrade requirement for his Spiritual Heritage, he discovered that the 1,000 points of spiritual energy had turned into 10,000 points.Are you kidding me? Why is it 10,000 now?Han Fei was lost for words. However, on second thought, he realized that when he met the current requirement, his Spiritual Heritage would probably rise to level three.Han Fei stood up, feeling that he was filled with power. He was certain that he could beat Brother Gang to the ground with one hit right now.Hu! Level six is already so good, what about level seven? Can I kill Brother Gang with a slap when I am in level seven?Han Fei thought for a moment. Was Brother Gang not strong?He certainly was.How could a level-seven fisher who had absorbed the power of a demonic fish be weak? Three days ago, Han Fei only defeated the enemy with his storage of spiritual energy.Han Fei cleaned the environment. He put away the seven Spirit Refilling Pills and left the two books of battle techniques there.It was a pity that the Demon Purification Pot did not change greatly this time, but the requirement for the function of Forge the Universe had changed from 10,000 points to 5,000 points. Han Fei concluded that the fruit contained almost ten thousand points of spiritual energy. It was truly impressive.\u2026Not far away from Han Fei\u2019s house, Brother Gang asked, \u201cDo you smell anything? It\u2019s rather fragrant.\u201dHis lackey said, \u201cAh! No, I don\u2019t think so, Brother Gang!\u201dPa\u2026Brother Gang said, \u201cCan you agree with me just once? Stay here!\u201dHan Fei stood in a dark corner, grinning coldly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had a feeling that he was no longer useless.Brother Gang, taken aback, turned around and looked at Han Fei fearfully. \u201cW-Where have you been hiding?\u201dBrother Gang quickly set off a firecracker signal. Then, he demanded nervously with his iron rod, \u201cBoy, you\u2019d better run immediately, or you won\u2019t be able to when my level-eight expert arrives.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cYou can recognize me on such a late night?\u201dBrother Gang rolled his eyes.\u00a0You think I\u2019m blind?

Blood spurted out of his mouth, and his arms were instantly broken. His iron rod was also deformed.\u201cAh\u2026 Spare me!\u201dBrother Gang peed his pants. The boy was too horrifying! He had knocked him out with only one hit. At that moment, Brother Gang felt that an adult iron-head fish crashed into him. He could not feel his arms anymore, and his internal organs were shivering. He felt like he was dying.At this life-and-death moment, Brother Gang quickly dropped his pride and begged for mercy. Street fights were forbidden on the floating island, not to mention killing.Han Fei did not intend to kill him, either. He simply pointed his purple bamboo rod at Brother Gang. \u201cGive me your money.\u201dBrother Gang was confused.\u00a0You\u2019re still in the mood for robbery?Brother Gang said, \u201cM-Master, my hands are broken!\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI\u2019ll take it on my own.\u201dHan Fei groped for a while and found a wallet, which contained a dozen low-quality pearls, and a bag of sunflower seeds, which were very cheap.Han Fei declared meanly, \u201cYou are truly poor. Do not let me see you again, or I will beat you up once more.\u201dHe ran off immediately, because he saw someone coming toward them from far away.After a minute, Brother Gang\u2019s lackeys arrived.One of the lackeys asked, \u201cBrother Gang, what\u2019s up? Are you all right?\u201dBrother Gang cursed, \u201cMy hands are broken! Don\u2019t touch me! Ouch, inform Brother Dong now!\u201dBrother Gang made up his mind not to come to this place again. A twelve-year-old boy had knocked him down with one hit? Was he in level seven? But even so, the boy was still unreasonably strong!After about an hour, a middle-aged man in black came.Brother Gang wailed the moment he saw the man. \u201cBrother Gang, help me, Brother Gang! My hands are broken! I\u2019ve suffered severe internal injuries!\u201dLi Dong was in a foul mood after being woken up in the middle of the night. He frowned at Brother Gang. \u201cWhat happened?\u201dBrother Gang wept. \u201cBrother Dong, it was the boy you asked us to watch. He appeared out of nowhere and knocked me down with one hit! Brother Dong, you must settle the score for me!\u201dLi Dong was slightly surprised. He had little respect for Li Gang, but the guy was a level-seven fisher after all. If his enemy had crushed Li Gang like this and even bent an iron rod, his enemy\u2019s combat ability was at least in level eight. In that case, even Li Dong couldn\u2019t finish him easily.Li Dong asked, \u201cAre you sure it was him?\u201dBrother Gang said, \u201cAbsolutely. Although the boy covered his face, I could recognize a twelve-year-old boy.\u201dLi Dong furrowed his eyebrow. Was there a twelve-year-old level-eight fisher in Heavenly Water Village? If so, wasn\u2019t he a genius?Li Dong summoned one of his subordinates. \u201cBring the manager of this area to me. I remember it\u2019s Zhang Han.\u201dZhang Han arrived a moment later in untidy clothes.Zhang Han was rather angry that his good sleep was interrupted. If it weren\u2019t for them being from the Tigers, he would\u2019ve thrown them off the island.However, when Zhang Han saw Li Dong, he greeted respectfully, \u201cBrother Dong, what\u2019s happened here?\u201dThen, Zhang Han looked at Brother Gang in surprise. \u201cHey, it\u2019s you, A-Gang? Did someone beat you up?\u201dBrother Gang had shown little respect to Zhang Han with the Tigers at his back. He did not feel good about Zhang Han\u2019s teasing, but he dared not argue.Li Dong asked, \u201cWho\u2019s living in that house? A twelve-year-old boy? What\u2019s his strength and background?\u201dSeeing that Li Dong was pointing at Han Fei\u2019s house, Zhang Han chuckled. \u201cBrother Dong, don\u2019t you see how ragged the house is? A useless guy named Han Fei lives there. He\u2019s only a level-two fisher.\u201dZhang Han secretly laughed. It was true that the boy was useless, but he had a tough brother who had been recruited by the angel as a disciple. Even Zhang Han dared not make trouble for Han Fei anymore.Li Dong sniffed at Zhang Han\u2019s casualness. \u201cZhang Han, are the Tigers not worth any respect now? Stop messing with me.\u201dZhang Han said, \u201cOf course you are! I have always respected the Tigers. However, I don\u2019t think you should piss off the people living in this house. Han Fei is useless, but his brother is the angel\u2019s disciple. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cThe angel\u2019s disciple?\u201dLi Dong immediately changed his face. The angel, as an expert from the city, could destroy the Tigers single-handedly.Zhang Han secretly chuckled and continued, \u201cBrother Gang, Han Fei couldn\u2019t have hurt A-Gang, but Tang Ge is probably a level-eight fisher now. A-Gang should be grateful that he\u2019s still alive. If Tang Ge intended to kill him, he would\u2019ve been dead. Would anyone demand the angel for an explanation?\u201dZhang Han thought that it was definitely done by Tang Ge. Only Tang Ge was capable of crippling the fatty with one hit.Li Dong gasped hard and realized that he was in serious trouble. Everybody in Heavenly Water Village knew Tang Ge now. Pissing off Tang Ge meant pissing off the angel, and pissing off the angel meant suicide.Brother Gang was also dumbfounded. Tang Ge? Tang Ge had been living in this sh*thole?He trembled hard. He thought he was screwed. Was the masked man not the boy he knew but his brother? But it didn\u2019t make sense! He could tell that it was Han Fei\u2019s voice!The Tigers were busy for the rest of the night. Li Gang was tied up at the gate of the headquarters of the Tigers as a gesture of apology. Li Jue, the leader of the Tigers, tried to pull his strings and apologize to the angel. He even came to the village leader, only to be refused without thinking because the village leader did not want to get involved.The Wang family gloated. A lot of people thought that the Tigers were doomed, including Li Jue himself. He even asked his subordinates to escort Li Hu to the ocean to wait out the crisis. As for himself, he couldn\u2019t leave, or the Tigers would be doomed if the angel came to ask for trouble.As a matter of fact, Fang Ze did not know about the incident at all, and neither did Tang Ge. The culprit behind the whole thing was having shrimp dumplings in a stand before the school and complaining about how awful they tasted.The school gate was rather lively in the morning. Many students were coming for classes.\u201cHey, Han Fei!\u201dSuddenly, a delightful voice carried over.Han Fei raised his head. It was He Xiaoyu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He Xiaoyu, the shrimp dumplings in this diner are awful. Do you want any?\u201d\u201cYou are giving them to me because they\u2019re awful?\u201dAmused, He Xiaoyu grabbed Han Fei\u2019s ears and shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re still in the mood for food? Where the hell have you been? Everybody in the school is worried that Tang Ge will go crazy if you\u2019re dead.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cHey, hey, hey\u2026 Can you be a little gentler, or nobody will marry you in the future! Who says that I\u2019m dead? I only took a tour on the ocean.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cA tour? Do you know how many boats were sent to search for you? Even my father was depressed.\u201dHan Fei knew that the school searched for him only because they were worried that Tang Ge would blame them.Han Fei said, \u201cMy boat was broken. I floated on the ocean for five days and five nights. Did anyone really come for me? Fine, if you\u2019re not interested in them, let\u2019s go to school.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said anxiously, \u201cHow could your boat be broken? Come to the teachers with me.\u201dBefore He Xiaoyu finished the last shrimp dumpling, He Xiaoyu had already dragged him into school.On their way, people exclaimed now and then.\u201cWasn\u2019t Han Fei dead on the ocean?\u201d\u201cHuh? Han Fei is still alive?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not right! This guy was missing for more than a week. Why is he here again?\u201d\u201cHan Fei must be in a relationship with He Xiaoyu. There\u2019s definitely something between them.\u201dPa\u2026Blushing, He Xiaoyu stuck the bamboo rod into the ground and scolded, \u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019ll beat you up if you don\u2019t shut up!\u201dHe Xiaoyu certainly had a violent tendency, or she wouldn\u2019t be carrying this bamboo rod all the time.However, the girl was only violent when she was angry. Han Fei seemed even more violent than she was.Han Fei asked, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, aren\u2019t we supposed to go to class?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cWhat class? We\u2019re graduating soon. We have to go to the teachers and tell them that you\u2019re back.\u201dOn their way, He Xiaoyu reminded him that the Fishing Trial, which was held once every three years, would start soon. All the teachers were busy offering the students guidance on how to survive and succeed in the trial.Wang Jie was about to teach life-saving methods to a group of students, when He Xiaoyu came in with Han Fei.Wang Jie was bewildered. \u201cHan Fei, you\u2019re not dead?\u201dHan Fei replied, \u201cSir, I\u2019ve returned safely.\u201dPa\u2026Wang Jie slapped Han Fei\u2019s head. \u201cYou\u2019re really a troublemaker. Everybody thought you died on the ocean. Do you know how many boats the school sent to search for you?\u201dHan Fei rubbed his head speechlessly. \u201cSir, I didn\u2019t want it, either. Someone damaged my boat. I wandered for five days, eight hundred kilometers away in the general fishery!\u201dWang Jie asked solemnly, \u201cHuh? What happened?\u201dWang Jie despised Han Fei before, but Han Fei did make a breakthrough when the test was drawing near, so he thought more highly of Han Fei now.He certainly wouldn\u2019t want anyone to set up his student. His students could die in accidents but not in schemes.After Han Fei told him everything, Wang Jie frowned. \u201cYou mean a fisher higher than level nine, or even a fishing master, tried to kill you?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cMaster, the port is already investigating it.\u201dHe Xiaoyu was dumbfounded.\u00a0A fishing master tried to kill you? Did they even need to try? They could\u2019ve killed you with a slap!Suddenly, Wang Jie stepped back and observed Han Fei.While He Xiaoyu and Han Fei were confused, Wang Jie patted Han Fei\u2019s shoulder.Han Fei knew that Wang Jie had seen through his strength. It was another test.\u201cOuch! That hurts! Why did you hit me, sir?\u201dWang Jie, however, ignored him and stared at Han Fei weirdly. \u201cWhen\u2026 did you reach level six?\u201dWang Jie found it incomprehensible.\u00a0I can understand if you reach a higher level every month, or even every half-month, but you stagnated for four years and reached level six from level two in only half a month. Is Tang Ge capable of that?Suddenly, Wang Jie felt that he should ask Han Fei to do another Spiritual Heritage test. He did not believe that Han Fei had such talent.As if he knew what was on Wang Jie\u2019s mind, Han Fei said in a hurry, \u201cSir, no need to feel surprised. I had a spiritual fruit that my brother gave to me, and I soared to level six from level four.\u201d\u201cHu\u2026\u201dBoth Wang Jie and He Xiaoyu were relieved. That explained how fast his advancement was.Then, Wang Jie glared at Han Fei with his eyes full of fury.\u00a0A spiritual fruit? A spiritual fruit only upgraded you by two levels? You are truly useless! That\u2019s a spiritual fruit!Wang Jie was lost for words. Even he did not have any spiritual fruit yet. It was a waste that Han Fei could not absorb the power of the spiritual fruit.Wang Jie did not want to talk to Han Fei anymore. His eyes reddened with jealousy.He Xiaoyu, however, pulled Han Fei and asked enviously, \u201cHan Fei, how does the spiritual fruit taste? Did you just advance after you took it?\u201dHan Fei looked at He Xiaoyu pitifully.\u00a0You may have a fishing master father, but so what? He can\u2019t pick any spiritual fruit, can he?Han Fei said casually, \u201cIt was nothing. After I took it, my body burned and my veins bulged. Spiritual energy overflowed from my body. When I cultivated myself in the meantime, I heard the cracks of obstacles being broken\u2026\u201dPa\u2026Wang Jie slapped Han Fei\u2019s head again.\u00a0Overflow? Cracks? I\u2019m already drooling just listening to you!Wang Jie sniffed. \u201cGo to the Fishing Trial Class now. Everyone has to be present.\u201dHe Xiaoyu hurried to drag Han Fei away. She could tell that even she would probably be hit if they stayed any longer, because Wang Jie\u2019s eyes were already red.Soon after they left, He Xiaoyu asked in a low voice, \u201cHan Fei, are we going to fight other people today?\u201dHan Fei turned around to her in surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate, is it? If I cause trouble the moment I come back, won\u2019t I be kicked out?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be scared of. I\u2019m very close to level seven now, and I think I can make it with a dozen bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup and a bottle of Fish Head Body Polishing Fluid\u2026 I can lend you my bamboo rod.\u201dHan Fei understood everything. Although the girl vomited last time, she had certainly benefited a lot from it, or she wouldn\u2019t be encouraging him now.However, Han Fei was also tempted himself. Although the Swallowed Spirit Soup was of little use to him anymore, he could still increase his spiritual energy by taking dozens of bowls of them.They immediately made a deal that they would duel with other people when the class was over.\u2026It was Han Fei\u2019s first class. Nobody was willing to sit next to him. He Xiaoyu, as his temporary ally, sat there to show her support.However, Wang Jie said gloomily immediately after he came in, \u201cDo not sit next to each other. You are too little for relationships.\u201dImmediately, everybody looked at Han Fei and He Xiaoyu.Blushing, He Xiaoyu said angrily, \u201cI\u2019m not in a relationship.\u201dHan Fei opened his hands helplessly. \u201cMe neither. Everything between us is innocent.\u201d\u201cInnocent?\u201dThe moment he mentioned it, everybody looked at Han Fei weirdly, wondering when Han Fei became so shameless.The class began.Wang Jie spoke: \u201cYou must be familiar with the Fishing Trial by now. I\u2019ll skip the specific details. All I want to stress is that you must not overestimate yourself. You know how many students are killed by the fish every year. Ten percent of them die, and fifty percent of them are injured\u2026\u201dWang Jie talked a lot. Han Fei had never heard it before, so he was rather interested.The Fishing Trial was just a way to select excellent talents through fishing. Only by passing the trial could one awaken their naturally-endowed spiritual beast.When everybody imagined their success, He Xiaoyu said to Han Fei in a low voice, \u201cThe spiritual beast is very awesome, so the higher your rank is, the better. If you are the first place, more power will be at your disposal when you awaken the spiritual beast, and your spiritual beast will be stronger.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the lecture, Han Fei and He Xiaoyu went to Class One, each holding a stick.He Xiaoyu looked at Han Fei\u2019s weapon curiously. \u201cYour iron rod looks weird! My father said that fancy-looking weapons are useless.\u201dHan Fei said to himself,\u00a0There\u2019s a lot of things that your father doesn\u2019t know, but he did not say it aloud and changed the topic quickly.Han Fei asked, \u201cWhy are only a thousand people allowed to awaken their spirits? There are tens of thousands of students in total on this island, aren\u2019t there?\u201dHe Xiaoyu replied, \u201cBut the ritual requires the Spirit Awakening Fluid, which is only enough for the usage of a thousand people. I don\u2019t think it will be any different this time.\u201dHan Fei was surprised. \u201cWhat about the rest of them? End up as common fishermen?\u201dHe Xiaoyu looked at Han Fei in surprise. \u201cAre you an idiot? If they can reach level ten and make a natural breakthrough, their spiritual beasts will also be awakened.\u201dHan Fei grinned in embarrassment as his memory returned. Natural awakening more often happened to the young people around twenty than to the kids in the village. They had passed their golden age for cultivation, so they could make few achievements even though their spiritual beast was awakened.Han Fei was determined to achieve higher things since the ritual was decided according to rank.He grew excited at the thought of that. He dragged He Xiaoyu and said, \u201cHurry up. What\u2019s most important for a cultivator? It\u2019s time\u2026\u201dHe Xiaoyu was lost for words.\u00a0You seem rather hasty. Why were you not so devoted in the past four years? Besides, since you are level six, you are basically guaranteed to pass the Fishing Trial!BAM!The door of Class One was kicked open.Everybody was shocked. Han Fei put his rod down and declared, \u201cI\u2019m back. Have you prepared your protection\u2026 well, your Swallowed Spirit Soup?\u201dHan Fei held his head high. He sensed that He Xiaoyu was pulling him, but he said impatiently, \u201cDon\u2019t be scared. I\u2019m level six now. I can beat up the whole grade.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to beat up the whole grade?\u201dThe intimidating voice stiffened Han Fei. He looked aside, only to see the fishing master teacher of Class One.Stunned, Han Fei said, \u201cWell, greetings, sir. I\u2019m told that everybody in Class One is very strong. I\u2019m here to challenge them now that I stepped into level six. If I lose, He Xiaoyu\u2019s bamboo rod will go to them. If I win, I will only ask for a bowl of Swallowed Spirit Soup\u2026\u201dBAM\u2026Han Fei was flung away, and the fishing master cursed, \u201cGet lost, you shameless scoundrel.\u201dHan Fei was not as useless as before in everyone\u2019s eyes after they witnessed his brutal performance and his infinite spiritual energy when he had Swallowed Spirit Soup. How could they defeat him?Han Fei was lost for words. Why did the teacher hit him? He only offered a piece of advice!A level-seven expert of Class One looked at Han Fei and said, \u201cMr. Yang, he\u2019s only good when he has the Swallowed Spirit Soup. I will fight him as long as he doesn\u2019t take the Swallowed Spirit Soup.\u201dMr. Yang frowned. Han Fei was a level-six even without the Swallowed Spirit Soup, and it wouldn\u2019t be easy to defeat him. In the four schools of the village, there were only a thousand students who were level six. Han Fei\u2019s performance couldn\u2019t be too bad.Mr. Yang decided that it was not bad to let the students take a closer look at level six.He said, \u201cYou can challenge them, but they have to be on the same level as you.\u201dHan Fei was about to leave, but he immediately patted his chest and said, \u201cNo problem. I want two bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup.\u201dGrimly, Mr. Yang said, \u201cOne bowl, and you are not allowed to take it during the battle.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cSir, this isn\u2019t fair. I would only be able to defeat one person.\u201dMr. Yang was amused. \u201cHow many people do you intend to defeat? The whole grade?\u201dHan Fei grinned. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s have a fight first. I can use a bowl of soup for now.\u201dAll the class rolled their eyes.\u00a0Who can you defeat without your Swallowed Spirit Soup?Lu Lingzhi had just reached level six. She intended to accept the challenge as a way to test her abilities.However, Hu Kun stood out and said, \u201cLet me! Nobody is going to compete with me!\u201dHan Fei\u2019s advancement was intimidating and unreasonable. Tang Ge must\u2019ve been helping him. Nobody knew Han Fei better than Hu Kun did in the entire school. Also, Tang Ge had helped Han Fei too many times before. He must\u2019ve left many useful things to Han Fei before he was taken away, or Han Fei couldn\u2019t have reached level six so quickly.Delighted, Han Fei grinned at Hu Kun. \u201cDon\u2019t be hasty. One at a time. Fetch your soup first.\u201dHu Kun said, \u201cThere will be plenty of soup as long as you can win.\u201dClang\u2026Hu Kun lunged with his iron rod. He finally had a good reason to beat him up. Nobody looked forward to the opportunity more than he did.Han Fei extended his hand, and He Xiaoyu handed over her bamboo rod promptly.Han Fei said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got.\u201dEverybody was lost for words. He made it look like a test.\u201cHa!\u201dWhat Hu Kun practiced was Flying Stick, which was very fast.Han Fei chuckled. \u201cFast is useless. I\u2019m going to sweep you.\u201dThe advantage of Sweeping Stick was the range and the force. Han Fei filled the bamboo rod with his spiritual energy and waved a curve with it intimidatingly.Hu Kun could fight it back, block it, or retreat. If Hu Kun were to back off at the beginning of the battle, everybody would lose respect for him.If he were to block it, he would be giving Han Fei an opportunity to launch heavier attacks. Therefore, Hu Kun chose to fight back. He did not think that his power would be overwhelmed by a guy who was enhanced by external help.Clang\u2026Hu Kun\u2019s face changed greatly in the wake of those ear-splitting noises, and his iron rod was bent. His arms were numb and probably broken. Then, he couldn\u2019t feel anything anymore.Pu\u2026Hu Kun was blown back. He failed to survive one attack from Han Fei although he was at the peak of level six. He did not even have a chance to moan.\u201cAck..\u201dEverybody gasped hard. Lu Lingzhi, who had been eager to try, was frozen. She was shocked by Han Fei\u2019s growth.Mr. Yang was also dumbfounded. How could he have defeated Hu Kun in one move when they were both level six? That was too horrifying!He Xiaoyu was also slightly dazed. It was she who taught Han Fei Sweeping Stick, but Han Fei was obviously as good at it as she was. Also, she believed that she was only on par with Hu Kun, but Han Fei had defeated him in one move?Everybody was full of questions. Who could tell that Han Fei had been regarded as garbage for four years?Clicking his tongue, Han Fei said, \u201cI asked you not to be hasty. Why were you so enthusiastic?\u201dThen, Han Fei declared proudly, \u201cIt seems that I\u2019m invincible in level six. Where are the level-seven fishermen in your class?\u201dImmediately, a young man with a blue rod walked out of the crowd.He Xiaoyu said, \u201cHe\u2019s Xing Qiu. He\u2019s very good. His rod was collected from a blue wood from the bottom of the ocean. He ranks in the top twenty among the level-sevens in our school. He\u2019s regularly given four bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup.\u201dHan Fei immediately beamed with jealousy when he learned that Xing Qiu had four bowls of soup regularly. That benefit was too generous!Han Fei nodded his head and said, \u201cSince you are in level seven and I\u2019m in level six, you need to give me four bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup if you lose.\u201dXing Qiu sneered. \u201cI have plenty of soup. I wasn\u2019t here last time, but you\u2019ve come again after I\u2019m back. You really think that nobody in Class One can defeat you?\u201dHan Fei was not intimidated, but He Xiaoyu suddenly pulled Han Fei\u2019s rod. \u201cGive me my rod.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe turned his head to He Xiaoyu.\u00a0This is not decent! Even though he\u2019s a level-seven fisher, I wouldn\u2019t lose!Han Fei said, \u201cLet go! This is embarrassing! It\u2019s just a rod!\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t! You can lose your own rod!\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cLet go. Do you still want the Swallowed Spirit Soup?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cI do. I\u2019ll have it when you can\u2019t have it anymore.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u201dEverybody was speechless.\u00a0You will have it when he can\u2019t have it anymore? Do you really think he can beat a whole grade? Do you know how many level-seven experts are out there in a grade?Xing Qiu blushed furiously. \u201cHey! Are we going to do this or not? The bamboo rod is too precious for you?\u201dHan Fei was rather embarrassed. He did not know what to say about He Xiaoyu, who always grew petty at the critical moment.He could only release the rod and say, \u201cFine. It seems that I have to bring out my own weapon now.\u201dEverybody was grim.\u00a0Can you not be so cocky? It\u2019s just an iron rod.Xing Qiu said, \u201cDo you think anyone is interested in your ragged rod?\u201dHan Fei stabbed the rob into the ground and said, \u201cWhat do you know? My brother gave this to me. It\u2019s a super iron rod, the iron rod of iron rods.\u201dNobody was convinced. \u201cWho are you fooling? A super iron rod? It\u2019s just a regular iron rod.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cYou dare not try? Are you really a level-seven? I\u2019m always a man of my word. Besides, my brother is behind me. Are you worried that I can\u2019t pay if I lose?\u201dXing Qiu said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been waiting for! Bring it on!

According to common sense, the battle between a level-seven and a level-six did not have any suspense. However, Han Fei was not anything common. Since he defeated Hu Kun in one move, it was indeed possible that he could fight a level-seven.Under everyone\u2019s watch, they began their fight. Han Fei jumped and smashed, because he did not know any other battle techniques.Xing Qiu sniffed. His spiritual energy surged out. He was ready to knock Han Fei down in one attack.Han Fei thought differently. He couldn\u2019t catch too much attention. Level seven was already the peak at the school. If he took Xing Qiu down like how he took Brother Gang down just now, something terrible would happen.Clang\u2026Han Fei changed his expression and pretended to step back. \u201cYou are good. Is this the strength of level seven? Impressive!\u201dXing Qiu looked proud and confident, feeling good that he taught Han Fei a lesson. But deep in his heart, he was shocked at Han Fei\u2019s power. His hands were almost numb.Clang! Clang! Clang!\u201cDamn it! Level seven is truly magnificent!\u201d\u201cHe Xiaoyu, I don\u2019t think I can win this time!\u201d\u201cHey, are your hands not numb? You\u2019re bleeding.\u201dHan Fei mumbled as they clashed five times. At first, the audience thought that Han Fei had indeed felt the domination of level seven.However, they soon realized that Xing Qiu was not any better. His hands were cracked, and his face was becoming paler and paler. Even his rod was shaking.Clang\u2026Xing Qiu was flung away. His rod remained straight, but his arms were slightly broken. He almost fell over.Han Fei said, \u201cSheesh! The level-seven experts are truly unstoppable. My hands are shaking.\u201dAs he spoke, Han Fei shook his hands.Everybody was speechless.\u00a0Do you think we can\u2019t tell that you\u2019re pretending?Mr. Yang seemed calm but was greatly shocked. How had Han Fei grown so strong? Not only had he defeated someone of a higher level, but he did not even suffer any injury.Everybody fell quiet.Someone smacked their head.\u00a0Am I in a dream? Is this really Han Fei?He Xiaoyu opened her mouth, her eyes full of disbelief. Why did she not know that Han Fei was so good in the past four years?Han Fei hurried to drop a hint at He Xiaoyu.However, He Xiaoyu did not really get it.Staggering to He Xiaoyu, Han Fei cried and fell on He Xiaoyu.Han Fei said, \u201cHey, although I won the battle, I seem to have suffered heavy wounds.\u201dThen, Han Fei felt that something was not right. He had touched a certain part.\u201cHuh? So soft?\u201dPa\u2026He Xiaoyu blushed in fury. \u201cYou\u2019re shameless!\u201dHan Fei was stunned. \u201cWhy are you slapping me when I\u2019m already heavily wounded? My internal organs are shaking. I want my Swallowed Spirit Soup\u2026\u201dEveryone rolled their eyes.\u00a0Can your acting skills be any worse? You want soup when you\u2019re dying?Mr. Yang tried to calm himself down.\u00a0I\u2019m not going to be infuriated by a boy. Calm down. Hu\u2026Mr. Yang bellowed, \u201cAll right, end of this battle! Han Fei, come with me.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cSir, I need to have the soup, or my internal organs can\u2019t be soothed\u2026\u201d\u201cBAM\u2026Han Fei was kicked more than ten meters away, but he jumped up and immediately tried to flee.Mr. Yang shouted, \u201cStop there! You can claim the soup in the cafeteria later. Come with me\u2026 He Xiaoyu, you will come too. The rest of you, send Hu Kun and Xing Qiu to the medical room.\u201dWang Jie was staring at a bottle of valuable body-conditioning fluid, when he saw his colleague lead two of his students to him with a grim face.Wang Jie asked, \u201cMr. Yang, what\u2019s up?\u201dMr. Yang said, \u201cMr. Wang, your student hid his abilities quite well! Han Fei knocked out a peak level-six in one attack and defeated a level-seven with only a few hits. Do you know about this?\u201dWang Jie was stunned.\u00a0What did you say? He knocked out a peak level-six in one attack and defeated a level-seven with only a few hits?Han Fei said in a hurry, \u201cMr. Wang, my internal organs are shaking, too\u2026\u201dMr. Yang said, \u201cShut up! You did not even tremble. You think I didn\u2019t notice?\u201dLooking at Han Fei thoughtfully, Wang Jie turned to He Xiaoyu and asked, \u201cXiaoyu, tell me. What was your plan this time?\u201dBlushing hard, He Xiaoyu failed to come up with anything for a long time.In the end, Mr. Yang grinned and said, \u201cYour student was addicted to swindling other people of their soup. I caught him right when he tried to do it again. Since he\u2019s your student, it\u2019s not my place to discipline him. Right, I think few students in our school except Tang Ge can defeat him now. Let him hoax elsewhere.\u201dHan Fei secretly complained. Who could\u2019ve known that a level-seven was so weak? Brother Gang had resisted him for quite a while!After Mr. Yang left, Wang Jie finally looked at Han Fei weirdly. \u201cWhat exactly did Tang Ge give you that made you advance so fast?\u201d\u2026At the edge of a level-two fishery, on a white extravagant boat, Tang Ge sneezed and frowned.\u00a0Is my brother being bullied by someone? I have indeed been away for too long this time, but what can I do since this sir wouldn\u2019t let me go?He decided to find a way to go back in a couple of days. He did not want to see Han Fei bullied by other people.Fang Ze was holding a fishing pole next to him. On the fishing pole was a three-headed snake. He said to Tang Ge with a smile, \u201cThis is a three-headed sea snake. It won\u2019t die even if its heads are cut from its body, and the heads will be regrown a while later. Its gallbladders are the best tonics. Here, take them. You will reach level nine after you take them.\u201d\u2026Wang Jie thought that Tang Ge was behind everything. Han Fei only had a Level One Spiritual Heritage. However talented he was, how could he become a level-seven fisher from a level-two one after half a month? If he had such talent, he would be distinguished even in the town.Wang Jie said thoughtfully, \u201cYou may feel good if your cultivation is excessively improved with external help, but it will be more difficult for you to advance in the future. However marvelous the spiritual fruit is, it\u2019s a medication and should not be taken randomly. You must not advance too quickly, or your foundation may be ruined.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cAll right! Sir, I\u2019ll listen to you.\u201dWang Jie did not feel comfortable to see the loser of his class growing into a top expert among his peers. He waved his hands and said, \u201cGo now! Stop dueling with other people. You will be given two bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup in the future.\u201dHan Fei nodded his head. He suddenly asked, \u201cSir, I\u2019m told that there are more experts in other campuses of our school?\u201dWang Jie\u2019s eyelids shivered. \u201cThey\u2019re nothing good. They\u2019re in level seven at best. Do not do anything outrageous.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cGot it, sir. I won\u2019t do anything outrageous.\u201dThen, Han Fei intended to leave. He Xiaoyu followed him.Wang Jie said, \u201cWait.\u201dHan Fei turned around. \u201cIs there anything else, sir?\u201dWang Jie said, \u201cYou\u2019d better watch what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re too little to be together. I won\u2019t stop Mr. He if he hits you someday.\u201dHe Xiaoyu suddenly blushed.\u00a0Who\u2019s together with him? I\u2019m only following him to drink soup.He Xiaoyu said, \u201cSir, there is no such thing. He Xiaoyu and I are pure friends, as pure as the meat of the little white fish\u2026\u201dWang Jie said, \u201cGet out of here.\u201dHan Fei hurried to go. It seemed that he couldn\u2019t trick the students of his own campus anymore. The teachers could all recognize him.He Xiaoyu said, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, we\u2019ll go to the southern campus after we have soup in the cafeteria. I\u2019m sure we can get fifty bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup there. We also need to buy a big calabash, which can contain the soup when we are full. However, you must lend your bamboo rod to me. I cannot use my super iron rod easily\u2026\u201dHan Fei talked for a long time, but when he looked back, he found He Xiaoyu walking angrily without looking at him.Han Fei said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Don\u2019t be upset. We\u2019re pure friends, as pure as the clouds in the sky.\u201dHe Xiaoyu turned back abruptly. \u201cAm I not pretty? I have too many pursuers! I\u2019m not interested in you at all!\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dHan Fei rubbed his head.\u00a0What\u2019s going on? Are we talking about the same thing? How can I like a twelve-year-old girl? I\u2019m almost thirty years old.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nobody believed it at first, but someone from Class One confirmed it, making people despise and envy Han Fei.After he woke up, Hu Kun felt that the world had collapsed. He was crushed by one attack?He gnashed his teeth. \u201cDamn it! It\u2019s all because of Tang Ge! Don\u2019t laugh too soon, Han Fei\u2026\u201dIn the school, someone murmured when they saw Han Fei, \u201cYou might not have surpassed level three if it weren\u2019t for Tang Ge.\u201dSomeone whispered, \u201cLook, that\u2019s Han Fei. He\u2019s unbelievably lucky. We can\u2019t bully him again.\u201dSome girls scorned him when they walked past Han Fei. \u201cCounting on other people is not an ability at all!\u201dHan Fei was rather gloomy. Their level was even lower than his, and yet they looked down on him.In the cafeteria, seven bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup were placed before He Xiaoyu, and two before He Xiaoyu.Han Fei said, \u201cFinish them. We\u2019ll set off after that.\u201d\u201cGudu\u2026 Gudu\u2026\u201dHe Xiaoyu had only two bowls of soup. She was rather angry to see that Han Fei had already had three bowls. She was drinking her own quota, not something swindled out of other people.Han Fei glanced at her and pushed a bowl toward her. \u201cHave some more, so that you\u2019ll be stronger.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cIt\u2019s no use to drink so much. I can\u2019t absorb it that fast.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cWhy do you care about that? It can\u2019t harm you anyway. Drink it first.\u201dHe Xiaoyu thought for a moment and realized that it did make sense. After the drink last time, she nearly broke the obstacles of level seven in her cultivation. Maybe Han Fei was right about having as much of the soup as possible.There were plenty of students in the cafeteria, but nobody was around Han Fei and He Xiaoyu.They all looked at them in shock. Was the Swallowed Spirit Soup as cheap as water to them?Hua!Han Fei and He Xiaoyu rose. They looked at each other and walked out of the cafeteria.His spiritual energy surpassed 1,000 points again. Han Fei was very confident.Han Fei and He Xiaoyu stood at the gate of the southern campus, each with a rod before them. He Xiaoyu also carried a huge calabash.The most outrageous thing was the plate before Han Fei\u2019s chest that said,\u00a0Han Fei, boss of the eastern campus, is here to duel with the students of the southern campus. Whoever defeats me will be given a bamboo rod. Note: The losers have to provide two bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup. The level-seven experts need to provide four. Those below level six can leave me alone.Immediately, the southern campus was enraged.Many students looked at them furiously. The two of them were cocky enough to challenge the whole southern campus?Someone scolded, \u201cYou\u2019re Han Fei? What makes you think you can swagger around here?\u201dSomeone hefted an iron rod and shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know the color of your blood!\u201dSomeone cursed, \u201cThose who don\u2019t know you might think that you\u2019re Tang Ge. Who\u2019s Han Fei? Never heard of you before. You will crawl home later!\u201d\u201cLet me!\u201dA level-six guy approached with an iron rod. \u201cI am Li Fanglai, a level-six fisher. Do you dare to duel with me?\u201dSomeone whispered, \u201cLi Fanglai\u2019s Spiritual Heritage was measured to be Level Two, High Quality. He\u2019s a Heavenly Talent who will go to the town. He can\u2019t lose.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. His opponent feels like a level-six to me, too. They are on par with each other.\u201d\u201cHehe! Li Fanglai, knock him down as quickly as possible for the southern campus!\u201dLi Fanglai raised the iron rod and bellowed, \u201cI\u2019ll crush you!\u201dHan Fei waved his hand. \u201cWait a moment.\u201dLi Fanglai stiffened. \u201cWhat are you doing? Are you scared? You can\u2019t get away with this unless you kneel and admit you\u2019re wrong.\u201dHan Fei rolled his eyes and said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t brought me your Swallowed Spirit Soup yet. What if you don\u2019t give it to me after you fail?\u201dLi Fanglai flushed with fury. \u201cYou think I can\u2019t afford two bowls of Swallowed Spirit Soup?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that you can\u2019t, but it\u2019s hard to tell from your appearance.\u201dLi Fanglai was infuriated that the guy showed no respect for him.\u00a0Do you think you are a sure winner?Li Fanglai, maddened, simply attacked.Clang\u2026Han Fei blocked the attack easily and shouted, \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Fetch the soup already! You won\u2019t run when your champion fails, will you?\u201dThe onlookers were angry. \u201cWho cares about two bowls of soup?\u201d\u201cYou think you\u2019re going to win?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too cocky. If I had fought you, I would\u2019ve beat the crap out of you!\u201dThe two of them fought for several minutes; Han Fei breathed heavily.Li Fanglai discovered, to his surprise, that the guy was too strong. He used his full strength but could not crush his opponent. Damn it. He definitely could\u2019ve crushed the guy if he were at the peak of level six.He Xiaoyu looked at the sky. She felt that Han Fei was committing fraud. His acting was quite vivid, but he couldn\u2019t have used more than thirty points of spiritual energy.Clang\u2026Han Fei slashed hard and tossed Li Fanglai to the ground.Li Fanglai\u2019s face flushed. It was truly frustrating. He had run out of spiritual energy, but why was this guy still fine?Many people were rendered speechless.Someone squinted. \u201cThe guy should be stronger than Li Fanglai, but Li Fanglai consumed a lot of his spiritual energy. He will be crushed by another level-six.\u201dImmediately, another person jumped out and declared, \u201cI\u2019m Jia Tong from Class Seven. I\u2019ll let you rest for a moment in case you claim that I\u2019m taking advantage of you.\u201dHan Fei was lost for words.\u00a0Would resting for a moment make any difference?\u00a0For fishers to regain their spiritual energy, they had to train themselves for half a day.Han Fei waved his hand and said, \u201cWait a moment. Not that I\u2019m dawdling, but where is the Swallowed Spirit Soup? I won\u2019t fight you until the soup is delivered. I\u2019m worried that you won\u2019t give it to me.\u201d\u201cYou think that we have no honor?\u201dJia Tong was beyond angry. Being suspected was even more humiliating than being provoked.Jia Tong said, \u201cSomeone fetch the Swallowed Spirit Soup already!\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThat\u2019s unnecessary. I have a better idea. Let\u2019s duel before your cafeteria. It\u2019s more convenient.\u201d\u201cPu\u2026\u201dEveryone almost vomited blood.\u00a0How many people do you think you can defeat? I hope that your brain is not filled with the Swallowed Spirit Soup!He Xiaoyu couldn\u2019t help but step back. She said to herself,\u00a0I\u2019m only here to help him drink the soup that he can\u2019t finish, but I\u2019m not familiar with this guy.He Xiaoyu went even further. \u201cWhy, you don\u2019t have the courage for that? I was told that there were many experts in the southern campus, but it\u2019s not true at all. He Xiaoyu, let\u2019s go to the northern campus\u2026\u201dJia Tong snapped, \u201cHow dare you? Come to the cafeteria if you dare!\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cIf I dare? I can make you go bankrupt!\u201dHan Fei strutted in with the bamboo rod while everybody glared at him furiously.He Xiaoyu took a deep breath.\u00a0I won\u2019t be beaten up, will I? I\u2019m not involved in this. They probably won\u2019t beat me. I\u2019m a girl!Han Fei finally saw the two bowls of soup that Li Fanglai lost. He immediately shouted, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, collect the soup!\u201dHe Xiaoyu blushed, feeling guilty as if she were stealing a kid\u2019s toys. But it was Swallowed Spirit Soup! She used to be given two bowls of them every five days, but she had earned two bowls so easily.Jia Tong said, \u201cCan you fight now?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cOf course, the southern campus is truly generous. Come on, let\u2019s fight.\u201dJia Tong attacked the moment Han Fei nodded. Spiritual energy surged out of his rod crazily.Han Fei shouted, \u201cThat\u2019s a good one! As expected of the genius of the southern campus!\u201d\u201cNice! Take another one from me!\u201d\u201cGood one!\u201dAfter a couple of collisions, Jia Tong blushed. How much spiritual energy did this guy have? Why was it never exhausted?Han Fei, on the other hand, pretended to breathe heavily, while he actually controlled the output of his spiritual energy. After all, his body was so sturdy now that he could block Jia Tong\u2019s attacks with half of the energy his enemy used. So, he felt that he could crush a couple of them in a row.BAM!In his carelessness, Jia Tong was hit by Han Fei and flung three meters away. His hands were shaking.Many people stopped jeering. The guy truly had something behind his boldness. He had defeated two level-six experts consecutively.Han Fei merely shouted, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, collect the soup\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A student at the peak of level five assumed that Han Fei was exhausted, and that he could give the guy a final blow and win the bamboo rod over.However, Han Fei said in disdain the moment he stood out, \u201cYou\u2019re too weak for me. Go away.\u201dThe student wouldn\u2019t give in. \u201cI have Swallowed Spirit Soup, too. I would like to challenge you.\u201dHan Fei\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you get the soup. Come on. You will be the winner if you can force me to take one step back.\u201dThe student was delighted. \u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that.\u201dThen, he shouted and charged forward with the iron rod. Han Fei could easily tell that he concentrated most of his spiritual energy on the iron rod.Clang\u2026Han Fei bent and nearly stepped back, but he was a level-six after all. After a collision, the level-fix student dropped on the ground.Han Fei said, \u201cI told you to go away\u2026 He Xiaoyu, collect the soup!\u201dHowever, some of the clever students, thinking that Han Fei almost stepped back just now, shouted, \u201cLet me\u2026 It\u2019s my turn\u2026 No, it\u2019s mine\u2026\u201dSeveral minutes later, no level-five fishers challenged him anymore. They wondered how Han Fei blocked them at the last moment and knocked them down with one attack when he was almost stepping back every time.He Xiaoyu simply poured the Swallowed Spirit Soup into the calabash and thought,\u00a0I\u2019m just here to help process the soup, I\u2019m just here to help process the soup.Soon, more and more people came to the cafeteria.Picking up He Xiaoyu\u2019s calabash, Han Fei drank it now and then and said, \u201cWho\u2019s next? Everyone is welcome\u2026\u201dNobody responded to him.Han Fei shouted again, \u201cAre there no capable warriors in the southern campus at all? Where are your level-six and level-seven experts?\u201d\u201cGet out of the way!\u201dThe crowd divided, and a couple of teenagers walked over confidently.Someone was relieved. \u201cThey\u2019re finally here.\u201dSomeone grew confident. \u201cThe southern campus will be mocked if they do not come.\u201dSomeone said, \u201cHan Fei is dead for sure. How can he expect to resist them? As long as he is not given time to rest, it remains to be seen whether or not he can survive two of them. He has fought for so long anyway.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s asking for trouble in the southern campus?\u201dThe man stared at Han Fei maliciously as he spoke.Han Fei said, \u201cI am Han Fei, boss of the eastern campus. I have never been defeated in my entire life. I\u2019m here to be defeated.\u201dHe Xiaoyu rolled her eyes.\u00a0You\u2019ve never been defeated? You were just a level-two fisher before. Nobody dared to fight you because they were scared that they would accidentally kill you.Han Fei, however, held his head high, too busy feeling good about himself to care about that.\u201cYou\u2019ve never been defeated? You\u2019re even stronger than Tang Ge?\u201dHan Fei was not bothered. \u201cTang Ge is my brother. We\u2019ve never fought. I\u2019m here just to be defeated.\u201dOne of the newcomers mocked, \u201cYou\u2019ve fought many battles. You must be out of spiritual energy. Are you sure you want this?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI\u2019m a quick absorber. My spiritual energy is infinite.\u201dEverybody rolled their eyes. They had never seen anyone as shameless.\u00a0Infinite spiritual energy? You think you are the Sea God?Someone hefted their iron rod and shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll fight you if you want to fight. Don\u2019t surrender if you have balls.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cYou\u2019d better confirm that your balls are still there first.\u201dEverybody was infuriated.\u201cKill him!\u201d\u201cCrush him!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not getting out of here on his own two feet!\u201dWaving the bamboo rod, Han Fei said lazily, \u201cBite me!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go first!\u201dSomeone couldn\u2019t hold back anymore and decided to check Han Fei\u2019s strength. However, Han Fei merely leaped and struck three times, blowing the guy away and bending his iron rod.\u201cTch\u2026\u201d\u201cShoot\u2026\u201d\u201cIs this guy made of iron?\u201d\u201cWhy is he still so strong?\u201dHan Fei said with a smile, \u201cNext!\u201d\u201cWait a moment.\u201dHan Fei\u2019s domination was disrupted by a middle-aged man with two students.\u201cMr. Zhou.\u201dZhou Ding looked awful. He was not convinced when someone told him that a stranger was challenging the whole school, but he believed it now. The little girl\u2019s calabash was apparently full of Swallowed Spirit Soup.Zhou Ding eyed Han Fei. The guy was indeed a level-six, not a level-seven.Zhou Ding pointed at one of his students and said, \u201cChen Cai, you\u2019re up.\u201dThe guy named Chen Cai was also carrying a bamboo rod. He seemed much stronger than the other level-sixes.Chen Cai said, \u201cI\u2019m Chen Cai. I will challenge you.\u201dHan Fei narrowed his eyes and grew solemn.Hum!Spiritual energy burst out of his bamboo rod. Han Fei stopped panting and shivering. Watching the incoming stick, he simply lifted his own rod against it.Clang!Many students below level five stepped back under the brunt of the attack.Han Fei was slightly stunned. The guy was rather strong. He did not know the technique, but there was a hidden force behind the attack. He almost stepped back under the dual forces.\u201cHuh? You\u2019re good!\u201dHan Fei\u2019s eyes glittered, but Chen Cai\u2019s face changed greatly. The attack that he launched with eighty percent of his strength did not shake the guy at all?Zhou Ding was also surprised. Chen Cai\u2019s Spiritual Heritage was Level Three, High Quality. He was almost the strongest level-six in the southern campus. However, he did not have any advantage in the battle.Han Fei shouted, \u201cSweep!\u201dClang!Chen Cai became pale after the collision. He slid dozens of meters away, his hands shaking. How could the attack have been so powerful?Slash!Chen Cai seemed rather anxious. He stomped on the ground, and his bamboo rod glowed.\u201cSpiritual Energy Explosion!\u201dHan Fei immediately stepped back before the enormous power. Thankfully, his previous slash blocked the blast, or he might have failed.He Xiaoyu said in a hurry, \u201cThis is Spiritual Energy Explosion. It\u2019s very powerful. Even the level-sevens have to avoid it.\u201dHan Fei shook his arm and his head. \u201cIt\u2019s quite tough. I can gather the spiritual energy, but how can I detonate it?\u201d\u201cHow is it possible? He took the hit of the Spiritual Energy Explosion?\u201d\u201cIs he made of iron? Why is he so tough?\u201dZhou Ding was surprised. The young man was not simple. Taking the hit of the Spiritual Energy Explosion without being hurt was a sign of his sturdiness.To everyone\u2019s surprise, the spiritual energy at the tip of Han Fei\u2019s rod was more and more brilliant.Han Fei declared, \u201cSpiritual Energy Explosion\u2026\u201dZhou Ding took action. He snatched Han Fei\u2019s spiritual energy, but the next second, his hand was blown away by the enormous spiritual energy.\u201cHumph. Break!\u201dThe cluster of spiritual energy crumbled. Han Fei was forced to take quite a few steps back under the waves.Han Fei\u2019s eyes glowed. It was truly impressive. He didn\u2019t know how to detonate it. If it weren\u2019t for this teacher, there would\u2019ve been nothing he could do.Zhou Ding was rather embarrassed. He almost failed to break the Spiritual Energy Explosion of a level-six student.Narrowing his eyes, Zhou Ding said, \u201cYou have the combat ability of a level-eight fisher, and you are brazen enough to trick my students for their Swallowed Spirit Soup. Get lost.\u201d\u201cTch\u2026\u201dAll the students exclaimed in shock.The combat ability of a level-eight fisher? That was one tough student.Someone was suspicious. \u201cIs he Tang Ge? Who else in the eastern campus is as strong?\u201d\u201cJerk! You pretend to be a level-six when you are a level-eight! Give us our soup!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Give us our soup, Han Fei!\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019m obviously a level-six. I didn\u2019t tell you my natural-born strength because I like to keep a low profile.\u201dHan Fei looked at Zhou Ding and smiled in embarrassment. \u201cMr. Zhou, I was actually here to seek breakthroughs, and I understood a lot after sensing the power of the Spiritual Energy Explosion. I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201dZhou Ding grabbed Han Fei. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201dHan Fei screamed, \u201cSir, I\u2019m truly a level-six! You can check me!\u201dIgnoring what he said, Zhou Ding picked him up and left.Han Fei shouted while he was hanging in midair, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, follow me!\u201dThe students were left astounded at the cafeteria of the southern campus.Some of them murmured, \u201cA level-eight? A level-six that is as strong as a level-eight? Is he really a Heavenly Talent?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why is it never exhausted?\u201dHan Fei admitted frankly, \u201cSir, I\u2019m a quick absorber. My spiritual energy is refilled immediately after I drink the soup!\u201dZhou Ding snapped, \u201cThat\u2019s bulls*it! I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing before.\u201dHan Fei, rolling his eyes, said, \u201cMr. Zhou, it\u2019s true. My master, Wang Jie, knows that. You can ask He Xiaoyu about it! Her father is a teacher in the eastern campus.\u201dZhou Ding looked at He Xiaoyu and her bamboo rod. Frowning, he asked, \u201cIs He Mingtang your father?\u201dHe Xiaoyu nodded quickly, hoping that the teacher wouldn\u2019t tell her father what happened today.Zhou Ding asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the real level of your Spiritual Heritage?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Level Two, Low Quality.\u201dZhou Ding said, \u201cThat\u2019s bulls*it! He Mingtang\u2019s daughter, you tell me.\u201dHe Xiaoyu was also stunned. She remembered that Han Fei\u2019s Spiritual Heritage was Level One, High Quality. Why was it Level Two now?Did Tang Ge find any marvelous medicines for Han Fei? It was said that Spiritual Heritage was fixed the moment one was born. Han Fei\u2019s Spiritual Heritage must\u2019ve improved only because of certain top spiritual fruits.He Xiaoyu nodded enviously, wishing that she had a spiritual fruit, too.Zhou Ding frowned even harder. \u201cEven if your body is extraordinary, your Spiritual Energy Explosion is still subpar. Do you want to live a peaceful life after pissing off so many people today? Besides, it\u2019s not good to count on your special physical qualities. What if you lose your infinite spiritual energy and cannot cast the unbelievable Spiritual Energy Explosion?\u201dHan Fei nodded quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Mr. Zhou. We\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201dZhou Ding took a deep breath after Han Fei and He Xiaoyu left. Such a body was truly appalling. It was a pity that Han Fei\u2019s future achievements were limited by his Spiritual Heritage. He couldn\u2019t be better than a grand fishing master however lucky he was.Han Fei and He Xiaoyu left the campus gloomily. The moment they got out of the gate, they ran crazily.Han Fei asked, \u201cAre we going to the northern campus and the southern campus?\u201dHe Xiaoyu shook her head while running. \u201cNo. We\u2019re lucky to only have been kicked out. We might not be so lucky next time.\u201dHan Fei realized that it did make sense. They seemed too cocky in other people\u2019s territory.Remembering the calabash of Swallowed Spirit Soup, Han Fei asked, \u201cHow much soup do we have?\u201dHe Xiaoyu replied, \u201cTwenty-nine bowls in total.\u201dHan Fei was surprised. \u201cHuh? Only twenty-nine bowls? I felt that I beat plenty of them.\u201dHe Xiaoyu rolled her eyes.\u00a0You beat plenty of them? It\u2019s more like you tricked plenty of them.\u00a0Only the last battle was real, and he learned Spiritual Energy Explosion from it.However, He Xiaoyu did not intend to tell Han Fei anything. Her father told her not to consider the technique until she was above level seven.In a corner, Han Fei and He Xiaoyu split the soup. Han Fei got twenty bowls of it. He was the one doing the fights anyway. However, since Zhou Ding let go of them easily probably for He Xiaoyu\u2019s father\u2019s sake, Han Fei gave more soup to He Xiaoyu.Halfway through it, Han Fei was full. He took a rest and asked, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, what\u2019s Spiritual Energy Explosion? I felt that it was beyond my control just now. If Mr. Zhou hadn\u2019t taken action, there might\u2019ve been dire consequences.\u201dHe Xiaoyu asked, \u201cHow much spiritual energy did you just gather?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cSeventy, or eighty.\u201d\u201cPu\u2026\u201dHe Xiaoyu spat out the soup and looked at Han Fei in shock.\u201cHow much?\u201dSeeing He Xiaoyu\u2019s reaction, Han Fei scratched his head awkwardly. \u201cIs it too much?\u201dHe Xiaoyu eyed Han Fei as if he were a lunatic.\u00a0You\u2019re only a level-six! How much spiritual energy can you possibly have? Isn\u2019t it crazy to concentrate half of your spiritual energy for a battle?He Xiaoyu asked, \u201cDid you know how much spiritual energy Chen Cai used just now?\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cHow much?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cNo more than twenty-five points.\u201dHan Fei was dumbfounded. \u201cAre you serious? Twenty-five points are already so powerful? Then, wouldn\u2019t eighty points have blown my enemy up instantly?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cAlthough it appeared that you picked up Spiritual Energy Explosion, you couldn\u2019t control it at all, so you could\u2019ve only overwhelmed your enemy with spiritual energy even if you launched the attack.\u201dHan Fei grew interested. \u201cHow can I control it? Teach me for the nine bowls of soup I gave you.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait until level seven? Spiritual Energy Explosion is barely useful at level six. My father said that the spiritual energy is not sufficient and pure in level six, and that after level seven, fishers would gain control over their spiritual energy. This skill won\u2019t be practical until then.\u201dHan Fei commented, \u201cHuh? It has such a high requirement?\u201dHe recalled Chen Cai\u2019s performance just now. The man almost knocked him out with one attack. It was a major shock for him.Han Fei suddenly said, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound right! I defeated level-sevens before. You witnessed it. That guy from Class One did not burst out his spiritual energy.\u201dHe Xiaoyu rolled her eyes. \u201cHow can you cast Spiritual Energy Explosion on your classmate? If he lost control of it during the attack, you might\u2019ve been killed.\u201dHan Fei suddenly said to He Xiaoyu, \u201cXiaoyu, someone tried to murder me.\u201dHe Xiaoyu: \u201c???\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI suspect that someone tried to murder me. I was at sea for five days because my boat was damaged\u2026\u201dHe told the whole story and gazed at He Xiaoyu. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you teach me the technique? I\u2019ll give you the rest of the Swallowed Spirit Soup.\u201dHe Xiaoyu was rendered speechless by the reluctance on Han Fei\u2019s face. You earned the Swallowed Spirit Soup for nothing, and you want to exchange it for a technique?She said, \u201cI\u2019m incapable of it. My father didn\u2019t teach me.\u201dHan Fei remarked, \u201cWhy did your father teach you nothing? Are you sure that you are his daughter?\u201dHe Xiaoyu immediately poked Han Fei with the bamboo rod.\u201cOf course I\u2019m his daughter! You don\u2019t believe me?\u201dHan Fei shouted, \u201cOuch\u2026 Ouch\u2026 Ouch\u2026 Stop!\u201dHan Fei, angry that the girl was too meek, scolded He Xiaoyu and gave He Xiaoyu quite a shock.Han Fei said, \u201cJust because your father didn\u2019t teach you doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t learn. Do you not want to be an expert? If you have access to it, I can give you a treasure for it.\u201dHan Fei thought that He Xiaoyu would ask him what the treasure was.However, He Xiaoyu simply pouted her lips and said, \u201cYou yelled at me! You\u2019re mean!\u201dHan Fei: \u201c???\u201dRealizing that the situation wouldn\u2019t get any better soon, he simply focused on the Swallowed Spirit Soup.He Xiaoyu murmured, \u201cYou yelled at me! You want me to steal things? You don\u2019t believe what my father said? Why are you so mean?\u201dHan Fei couldn\u2019t drink the soup anymore. He took out a bottle and said, \u201cLet\u2019s make an exchange.\u201dHe Xiaoyu\u2019s anger immediately changed. Her eyes wide, she asked, \u201cThis is\u2026 the Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid?\u201dHe Xiaoyu gasped. The Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid was made of the brains of the iron-head fish. It was said that dozens of mature iron-head fish were needed to make a small bottle of such fluid.He Xiaoyu reached her hand out for it.Han Fei hurried to withdraw his hand. \u201cAbout Spiritual Energy Explosion\u2026\u201dHe Xiaoyu sniffed and glared at Han Fei, before she said, \u201cI\u2019m truly incapable of it, but in fact, Spiritual Energy Explosion is all about your control over your own spiritual energy. If you can control it well, Spiritual Energy Explosion will be simple.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cHow can I control it?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cI don\u2019t know much about it. You have to use spiritual energy more often, like in fishing. One bottle of Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid is far from enough for you to get the knowledge of Spiritual Energy Explosion. Besides, you have only half a bottle.\u201dHan Fei was tempted. While the Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid was also a treasure, it couldn\u2019t compare to Spiritual Energy Explosion. He must have the technique that could save his life!Han Fei said seductively, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, aren\u2019t we good friends?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said warily, \u201cNo, we are not.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cIf we are not, why are you here to challenge them with me? If your father learns of that, tsk, tsk, tsk\u2026\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m just passing by\u2026 Fine, what do you want?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cWhat about a copy of the notes on the control of spiritual energy? I\u2019ll definitely share with you if I find good stuff.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dHan Fei proposed, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, the Fishing Trial is going to start soon, and it doesn\u2019t matter who your father is in the test. Why don\u2019t I give you a Spirit Refilling Pill?\u201d\u201cYou have a Spirit Refilling Pill?\u201d He Xiaoyu exclaimed in shock.Han Fei asked, \u201cHow does that sound?\u201dHe Xiaoyu hesitated. \u201cBut\u2026\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cAll right, I know what you mean. I\u2019ll give you two.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cNo, my father\u2026\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThree, and that\u2019s my best offer. You must know that a Spirit Refilling Pill is worth two mid-quality pearls!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe Xiaoyu finally agreed. Han Fei had discovered that the girl\u2019s shortcoming was greediness, which was probably because her father raised her too strictly. As a result, the girl always craved good things.At this moment, He Mingtang was teaching a class in school. The two of them went to He Xiaoyu\u2019s house stealthily and left in a hurry an hour later.Guiltily, He Xiaoyu presented a small book. \u201cThis is the only one I found. Go now. I\u2019ll be screwed if my mother finds out about this.\u201dHan Fei said with a smile, \u201cGood girl. I\u2019ll give you more Swallowed Spirit Soup in the future.\u201dBoth of them stopped at the gate of the school. He Xiaoyu got three Spirit Refilling Pills, and Han Fei got the way to utilize spiritual energy. Both of them felt that it was a great deal.\u201cHe Xiaoyu!\u201dSuddenly, someone yelled from behind the gate.\u201cAh, Father\u2026\u201dEnraged, He Mingtang looked at his unworthy daughter and then glared at Han Fei furiously.Han Fei wasn\u2019t any better. His smile froze when he saw the unfriendly Wang Jie and the teacher from the southern campus behind him. He changed his face and shouted at He Xiaoyu, \u201cRun!\u201dWang Jie was amused.\u00a0It\u2019s too late for you to run now!\u00a0He cast his hook at Han Fei rapidly.Sensing the attack at his back, Han Fei twisted his body subconsciously and dodged the hook in a weird posture.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe three fishing masters including He Mingtang all exclaimed in shock. A level-six fisher had avoided Wang Jie\u2019s hook? It must be noted that Wang Jie was appointed as a supervisor of the general fishery for his remarkable capability. However, his attack had been avoided?Wang Jie felt embarrassed. His fishing line glittered, and the hook darted at Han Fei even faster than before.Han Fei sweated hard.\u00a0I did nothing more than get a few bowls of soup with trickery. Do you need to welcome me with this?\u00a0While thinking about that, he flipped and evaded the hook again narrowly.Wang Jie immediately blushed. He was shocked at how swift Han Fei was.\u201cHuh?\u201dZhou Ding was surprised. \u201cOld Wang, your student is interesting. He may be able to make it to the top hundred in the Fishing Trial, no?\u201dWang Jie sniffed, \u201cHim? Top hundred? I just hope that he\u2019s not the last place.\u201dThis time, Wang Jie did not hold himself back. The speed of the hook was doubled. Although Han Fei\u2019s one leg dodged the first attack, the hook zigzagged and tied up his other leg.As the fishing line was retreated, Han Fei was hauled into the campus, catching everyone\u2019s attention.Wang Jie said, \u201cYou think you\u2019re strong enough to do whatever you want now, don\u2019t you?\u201dHe Xiaoyu was rather intimidated to see that, feeling lucky that she did not run. It would be most embarrassing if she were also dragged like this!Han Fei, on the other hand, screamed, \u201cSir, I did nothing wrong! I only went to the southern campus to share knowledge with the students there.\u201dWang Jie smiled at Zhou Ding, \u201cMr. Zhou Ding, thank you for dropping by. I\u2019ll teach him a good lesson.\u201dZhou Ding laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary. This is a good kid to me. Do you want to send him to study in the southern campus for a while?\u201dWang Jie said, \u201cWith the Fishing Trial coming near, we are going to concentrate the students and train them. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s time for that.\u201dZhou Ding smiled and said, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201dWang Jie said, \u201cSee you, Mr. Zhou.\u201dAfter Zhou Ding left, Wang Jie changed his face and sneered at Han Fei. \u201cYou\u2019re good. You show your abilities at the southern campus? You think that you are as invincible as a level-eight fisher?\u201dHan Fei shouted, \u201cSir, I didn\u2019t! Nobody knew that the southern campus is so weak!\u201dWang Jie said with a cold smile, \u201cWeak? Do you think you were strong in the past? Could you have been as strong if it weren\u2019t for what Tang Ge gave you? Do you know how many people were drawn to you when you showed your abilities?\u201dHan Fei was stunned. Who would be interested in a level-six fisher?He Mingtang went on, \u201cEverybody knows that you improved so fast because Tang Ge gave you a lot of good stuff. They dare not challenge Tang Ge, but killing you in secret and digging out your secrets is not difficult.\u201dHe Mingtang made up his mind to keep his daughter away from the brat. God knew what kind of trouble he would cause.Wang Jie said, \u201cDo you understand now? Nobody dares to touch Tang Ge, but do you think nobody dares to touch you? You will be put in detention for three days.\u201dHan Fei smiled bitterly. He forgot that he had been using Tang Ge as an excuse for his rapid improvement. However, his performance had been too distinguished lately. People couldn\u2019t help but wonder what Tang Ge had offered to Han Fei.Han Fei begged, \u201cSir, I know I was wrong. I will never fight again. About the detention\u2026\u201dWang Jie sneered. \u201cThree days, not to be shortened by one second.\u201dAfter Han Fei was hauled away by Wang Jie, He Mingtang glared at He Xiaoyu and said, \u201cGo home. You\u2019re grounded for five days.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said pitifully, \u201cFather, I did not join the fight.\u201dHe Mingtang said, \u201cGo home, and you are not allowed to talk with him again until he becomes a fishing master.\u201dPouting, He Xiaoyu said pitifully, \u201cOkay!\u201d\u2026There was only one detention room in the school. It was mainly used to punish bad students. Most of them were only detained for one day. Few were detained for three days in a row like Han Fei.The detention room was made of hard rock. It was not an obstacle for fishing masters, but no students who were only fishers could get away from it.Three days ago, Han Fei was dragged to the detention room like a dead dog. It was the most heated topic in the past few days.Someone was angry. \u201cHan Fei was too cocky. He was asking to be killed when he blocked the gate of the southern campus.\u201dSomeone made fun of him. \u201cI\u2019m told that he wouldn\u2019t have made it back if the teacher in the southern campus did not release him.\u201dMany people peeped into the detention room when they passed by, but it was too dark to see anything. However, Han Fei could hear the incessant laughter and mockery at the door.Zhou Xiao, Hu Kun\u2019s best friend, was shouting from a hole in the detention room. \u201cHey! Han Fei, you\u2019re not having a meltdown, are you?\u201dSomeone else joined him. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, but he will certainly be less cocky in the future!\u201d\u2026Han Fei was sitting cross-legged in the detention room. His clothes were entirely wet, and his spiritual energy was running loose. He could hardly control the spiritual energy precisely even after three days.At this moment, Han Fei was trying to gather half of his spiritual energy in his palm.\u201cNo\u2026 Half is too much\u2026 Not good, it\u2019s getting out of control\u2026\u201dZhou Xiao and his pals outside of the detention room discussed. \u201cHuh? Do you feel that spiritual energy is surging?\u201d\u201cA little bit. Is Han Fei cultivating?\u201d\u201cNonsense. How can such intense spiritual energy not glow?\u201d\u201cWait, look, it\u2019s glowing\u2026\u201dThe few people outside of the detention room saw dazzling light bursting before their eyes.BAM!Zhou Xiao did not know what was going on. He only sensed that he was flying.The explosion spread throughout the school. Many people saw Zhou Xiao and his pals fly away and pass out. As for the detention room, a hole half a man tall was left.Dozens of teachers of the school arrived almost simultaneously.They checked Zhou Xiao and his pals first. Then, they released a long breath of relief and said, \u201cSend them to the medical room.\u201dAfter that, they looked at the giant hole in the door of the detention room, from which uncanny noises were coming out.Then, they saw Han Fei, whose face was covered in dust and whose head was messy peeking out of the hole.Han Fei underestimated the power of Spiritual Energy Explosion. Half of his spiritual energy was already so explosive. If he had unleashed all his spiritual energy, it shouldn\u2019t have been a problem to blow up the whole detention room.Wang Jie\u2019s eyelids twitched. The guy was not hurt at all in such a powerful explosion?Han Fei was stunned to see so many people. In the end, he waved his hand and said, \u201cHey, long time no see!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who taught you Spiritual Energy Explosion?\u201dNobody would believe that Tang Ge left Han Fei the introduction to Spiritual Energy Explosion because the teacher from the southern campus stated that Han Fei learned it during the fight.Han Fei said, \u201cMaster, I perceived it after cultivation in seclusion for three days\u2026\u201dPa\u2026Wang Jie slapped Han Fei on the head. The guy was too shameless. It was supposed to be three days of detention, not cultivation in seclusion.\u201cThat\u2019s bulls*it! Spiritual Energy Explosion is a skill that requires proficiency. How could you have perceived it?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cSir, I truly perceived it on my own! I spent the last three days in the detention room!\u201dWang Jie was lost for words. It did make sense! The boy was locked up the moment he came back to school. Did he really perceive it on his own?However, He Mingtang felt that something was not right. His daughter had been avoiding him recently. Did it really have nothing to do with this?Wang Jie did not think much. He simply scolded, \u201cIdiot, do you know why we don\u2019t teach you Spiritual Energy Explosion until you are level seven? It\u2019s partly because your spiritual energy is not enough, partly because your veins are not sturdy enough, and partly because it requires proficiency. Spiritual Energy Explosion is the easiest of all techniques, but have you seen any fisher below level seven use it?\u201dHan Fei gnashed his teeth.\u00a0You like slapping my head? Fine, I\u2019ll slap yours when I\u2019m stronger than you\u2026 Wait, my veins are not sturdy enough? No wonder my arm was nearly torn apart just now. Then, do I need to do nothing other than building up my veins?\u201cHan Fei\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m here.\u201dPa\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re absentminded when I\u2019m talking to you?\u201dHan Fei gritted his teeth.\u00a0Wang Jie, just wait for it. I\u2019ll definitely slap your head off later.\u2026Han Fei returned home for the Ghost Pearl, the essence of the Ghost Blade Clam that could build up the veins. If it was as good as claimed, Spiritual Energy Explosion wouldn\u2019t be a problem for him in the future.Han Fei grew careful after the incident last time. Fearing that someone would attack him, he kept a low profile on the way.Han Fei was hiding behind a giant tree and observing if anybody was around, when someone said behind him, \u201cAre you Han Fei, my friend?\u201dHan Fei was so shocked that he raised his purple bamboo rod immediately.\u201cDon\u2019t panic, my friend. I mean you no harm.\u201dHan Fei looked at him carefully, only to discover that he was a man as brawny as a bull. There were three scars on his face cutting his eyes and his mouth apart, indicating that he was a dangerous person.Han Fei asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201dWith a smile that was even more awful than crying, the brawny man said, \u201cI am Li Jue, the leader of the Tigers. My arrogant subordinates insulted you the other day, and I hope that you can forgive us. The Tigers would like to give you whatever you need.\u201dHan Fei understood that they were here to apologize. The Tigers must\u2019ve learned his relationship with Tang Ge. That was why their leader came in person.The Tigers could\u2019ve killed him when his identity was still unknown, but now that they\u2019d missed the opportunity, they had to make up for what they did.Han Fei took a breath in relief. \u201cLeader Li, since you came to apologize in person, I\u2019ll definitely forgive you. However, Brother Gang provoked me repeatedly the other day. I hope that Leader Li can restrain him in case the reputation of the Tigers is ruined.\u201dLi Jue grinned hideously and said, \u201cOf course. You will not see them in Heavenly Water Village again, my friend.\u201dHan Fei was alarmed.\u00a0What do you mean? Are they all dead?He had heard before that the Tigers\u2019 enemies were all thrown into the ocean. He did not know that Li Jue was truly so brutal.However, Han Fei rolled his eyes and realized what was going on. A less determined man would\u2019ve been too scared to demand compensation from the Tigers after this.Considering that the whole thing was in the open, Han Fei sneered, \u201cLeader Li, my brother left me dozens of bottles of Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid, but all of them went missing the day I returned\u2026\u201dHan Fei felt that the air turned quiet, and killing intent was rising. Was Li Jue really going to kill him?Han Fei did not believe that he dared to do such a thing. Otherwise, not only would Tang Ge go after him, but the teachers at school would also ask his trouble.As he expected, Li Jue soon smiled. \u201cNaturally. I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t discipline them well. I\u2019ll pay them back soon.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThe other things are basically fine, except that some of the mid-quality pearls and Spirit Refilling Pills were missing.\u201dLi Jue was somewhat astounded and almost decided to kill him. The Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid was already precious enough, and the Spirit Refilling Pill was a life-saving medication.\u00a0How dare you ask for them?Han Fei, on the other hand, stared at Li Jue calmly and harmlessly. He did not believe that Li Jue dared to attack.Li Jue gnashed his teeth. \u201cAll right, the Tigers will compensate for your loss. Have a good day, my friend.\u201dHan Fei grinned and said, \u201cGoodbye, Leader Li.\u201dA moment later, Li Jue watched Han Fei leave and punched the tree next to him. The enormous tree was immediately broken in half.The person behind Li Jue said gloomily, \u201cBoss, this guy is outrageous. He\u2019s extorting us. I would like\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dCalming himself down, Li Jue said, \u201cWealth is nothing compared to life. Tang Ge won\u2019t stay here for long. He will leave after the soul awakening and probably won\u2019t return. Let\u2019s deal with him after that.\u201dHan Fei couldn\u2019t have felt better. The Tigers were rich enough to afford dozens of bottles of Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid, which would make his cultivation with the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Conditioning much easier.The Tigers were quite fast. What he demanded that morning was delivered in the afternoon.Han Fei checked the items. They included ten bottles of Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid, fifty mid-quality pearls, and five Spirit Refilling Pills.\u201cLi Jue, damn you!\u201dHan Fei trembled in fury.\u00a0I said dozens of bottles, not ten bottles. Also, you gave me five Spirit Refilling Pills? You think I\u2019m a beggar?However, Han Fei had wronged Li Jue. It was not easy to get the Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid. Also, the Spirit Refilling Pill, which was of little use to him, was a life saver for other people. Five of them were already a lot.Han Fei complained, \u201cWhat a petty bastard. However, I\u2019m a person who can easily be satisfied. I\u2019ll deal with them for now!\u201dHad Li Jue heard Han Fei\u2019s complaint, he probably would\u2019ve killed Han Fei on the spot.In the cave, Han Fei held the Ghost Pearl which allegedly nurtured and expanded the veins. He swallowed it without any hesitation.A long time later, Han Fei felt nothing except that his body was slightly cold, as if he were having an intravenous drip.It was not until two hours later that Han Fei finally sensed that his veins were strengthened, because he saw impurities leaking out of his skin.This stuff is not as good as I expected. It seems that I have to take a handful of such pearls at the same time.Other people would\u2019ve killed Han Fei if they knew what he was thinking. The medicines that could strengthen the veins were rare and precious, yet he was complaining that they were not effective enough.Three days later, cracking noises spread out of a cave on a cliff on the floating island. A young man was lying on the ground with all his clothes wet. Nobody could possibly tell what happened just now.Phew\u2026 I\u2019ve finally made it.Hahaha. I should be absolutely invincible at my level right now!Han Fei checked his data.Owner: Han FeiLevel: Six (Intermediate Fisher)Spiritual Energy: 1,288 (249)Spiritual Heritage: Level Two, Low Quality (Upgradeable)Weapon: Purple Bamboo RodMain Art: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)\u2026He had already felt that he was stuck. As he expected, his spiritual energy stopped at 249 points. He felt that he could make another breakthrough, but it required tremendous spiritual energy. His current stock did not seem enough.\u201cIt seems that I have to set sail again.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: Isn\u2019t It Strawberry?\u201cHuh? I can\u2019t set sail?\u201dXiao Qin said, \u201cGiven that you met two fish tides and your boat was damaged, the supervisors believe that somebody might be plotting against you, so you are not allowed to go to the ocean. Also, there are only nine days to go until your Fishing Trial. I suggest you focus on cultivating yourself for the time being.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cHave you found who did it?\u201dXiao Qin said, \u201cThere is no evidence, but we have reasons to believe that the Tigers are behind it.\u201d\u201cThe Tigers?\u201dHan Fei was not surprised at the answer. Not everyone could ruin a boat in the port without alarming other people at all. He felt that the compensation he asked from Li Jue was not enough.\u201cIn that case, Sister Qin, I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201dSince he could not go to the ocean, he had no income of spiritual energy, which was intolerable to Han Fei.The market was already lively although it was still early in the morning.Suddenly, someone shouted, \u201cWater! Clean rainwater here! Twenty coins per kilogram! Only five hundred kilograms are available!\u201dA customer negotiated: \u201cBoss, twenty sea coins is too much. It rained only several days ago. Your price is too high!\u201dSomeone else agreed with him. \u201cOld Qin, I\u2019ll have ten kilograms if you sell it for eighteen sea coins per kilogram.\u201dHowever, Old Qin chuckled. \u201cYou think it\u2019s expensive? It hasn\u2019t rained for half a month, and since the weather is fine, it probably won\u2019t rain again until half a month from now. Water will only be more and more precious. Twenty sea coins per kilogram is already my best offer.\u201dThe crowd grew quiet.Soon, someone said, \u201cFine, Old Qin, give me twenty kilograms.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have ten.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like fifty.\u201d\u2026Shocked, Han Fei watched the five hundred kilograms of water be bought out in only two minutes. He did not know that one could make money so fast with water.It did make sense on second thought. The only source of water for the floating island was the rain, which was surprisingly infrequent. As a result, water was always in demand.Han Fei thought of something. There was infinite seawater in this place! Wouldn\u2019t he become rich if he could make distilled water with it?Han Fei was considering it when he passed a beggar.Wait, that\u2019s not right\u2026Everybody on the floating island is a cultivator! Why is he begging?The beggar was wandering about with a broken bowl covered in dust.He stepped back in fear when he saw Han Fei and tried to flee.Han Fei shouted, \u201cYou, stop there!\u201dThe beggar cried, \u201cHave some mercy! I\u2019ve already been kicked out!\u201dHan Fei was stunned. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 Brother Gang?\u201dThe beggar shook his head quickly. \u201cXiao1 Gang. Please call me Xiao Gang.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c\u2026\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cYou\u2019re not dead?\u201dLi Gang\u2019s legs shivered when he heard that. Do you really want me dead? After everybody learned that Han Fei was Tang Ge\u2019s brother, he was hung on the top of a mast for three days in a row. He was not killed only because he had many friends in the eastern market. However, since his heart was hurt when he was kicked out of the Tigers by Li Gang, he had only one-tenth of his previous strength, and his life was quite miserable.Hugging Han Fei\u2019s leg, Li Gang cried, \u201cBro, please spare me! I can\u2019t die! I need to make a living for my girlfriend! If I die, someone will take her away!\u201dHan Fei was lost for words. \u201cWho\u2019s going to kill you? I\u2019m a kind-hearted person.\u201dLi Gang complained to himself, You are kind-hearted? I wouldn\u2019t have ended up like this if it weren\u2019t for you.Han Fei asked, \u201cYou were kicked out by the Tigers?\u201dLi Gang nodded in fear. He couldn\u2019t afford pissing off Han Fei right now!Han Fei came up with a plan. \u201cHow about this? You will follow me in the future. I\u2019ll give you an enjoyable life.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026 Huh?\u201dLi Gang thought that his ears deceived him. Was it a trick?Han Fei said, \u201cClean yourself up and find me in my home. I\u2019m short of hands right now. I\u2019ve offered you an opportunity. It depends on you whether or not you can grasp it.\u201dLi Gang was a smart gangster. Was it possible to follow Han Fei? Of course! Tang Ge was his brother, and his future clearly couldn\u2019t be too bad. However, why was Han Fei interested in him? Did Han Fei want him to collect protection fees?Thinking about how he was mugged by Han Fei twice, Li Gang felt that it was very possible.\u2026An hour later, Li Gang arrived with a pale face. It was obvious that he was badly wounded, but the dust on his face had been cleaned.When Li Gang came, Han Fei was toying with many bottles and had even moved a giant pot out. There was no telling what he was up to.Seeing that Li Gang was here, Han Fei asked, \u201cHow much strength do you have left?\u201dShivering, Li Gang replied, \u201cI\u2019m as good as\u2026 a level-two fisher.\u201dHe was of a mind to kill himself. Did he want to beg? Of course not. But he would be committing suicide if he were to go fishing as a level-two fisher.Han Fei raised his head in surprise. \u201cHuh? You\u2019re crippled now?\u201dLi Gang replied reluctantly, \u201cNot\u2026 Not exactly, but the pills for my recovery are too expensive. They are worth ten mid-quality pearls\u2026\u201dHan Fei scorned, \u201cSo, the bad guys who work for bad guys may be abandoned any moment.\u201dThen, Han Fei placed a dozen mid-quality pearls before Li Gang and said, \u201cI can cure you, but you must not betray me, or you will suffer more than wounds. Your girlfriend will probably really be taken away.\u201dLi Gang was filled with disbelief. Were the dozen mid-quality pearls for him?Feeling warm, Li Gang burst into tears. \u201cBoss, I\u2019ll be yours in the future. I\u2019ll do anything that you ask\u2026\u201dHan Fei waved his hand and said, \u201cAll right, that\u2019s enough! Why don\u2019t you tell me first if there are any seasonings on our island?\u201d\u201cSeasonings?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThe things that can give food a more interesting taste, like salt!\u201dHan Fei had never had any decent food since he came to this world. There was salt, but salt alone was not enough to remove the stink of the seafood.Li Gang got it. \u201cOh! Boss, you\u2019re talking about spices! But only the rich people can afford them!\u201dHan Fei was immediately amazed. \u201cSo the answer is yes?\u201dLi Gang said, \u201cYes, but ordinary people can\u2019t afford them. Most spices can only be bought with mid-quality pearls.\u201dHan Fei was a bit disappointed. It was too expensive. He had planned to open a barbecue restaurant and make distilled water. But if the seasonings were so expensive, he probably could only make barbecue for himself.\u201cWhat about alcohol?\u201dLi Gang said, \u201cAlcohol is cheap. The fish-head liquor is only worth thirty sea coins per kilogram. Boss, you want to drink?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Show me the spices first.\u201d\u2026There was a plantation with a coverage of a thousand acres at the south end of the floating island, next to the cliff.Han Fei was startled by the exuberant plants in the area. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that there were farmers on this island.\u201dLi Gang scratched his head. \u201cThey are not exactly farmers. Most of them planted spiritual herbs at the beginning, but probably because the environment was too poor, the spiritual herbs all retrograded into spices. Even so, many people believe that spices are still spiritual herbs. That\u2019s why spices are still expensive.\u201dAn old man was basking in the sunlight with a bottle of liquor in his arms. He showed no response when Han Fei and Li Gang walked onto the plantation.Han Fei went forward and asked, \u201cGrandpa, we\u2019re here to buy spices.\u201dThe old man glimpsed Han Fei and continued his sunbath. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford them.\u201dHan Fei was gloomy. How do you know that? I have fifty mid-quality pearls left!The old man raised his hand and pointed at some wood shelves not far away. \u201cThey\u2019re all there. Each of them costs one mid-quality pearl.\u201dHan Fei walked over curiously, only to be dumbfounded by what he saw.\u201cYou call them spices? Aren\u2019t they strawberries?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Barbecue BusinessHan Fei was surprised. Could there be identical plants in the universe?Although the strawberry was as big as a fist, it was obviously still a strawberry.Li Gang said, \u201cHuh? Boss, this is red fruit. I bought it before. I thought it was a spiritual fruit, but there was no reaction after I ate it. It was delicious, though.\u201dLi Gang smacked his lips during his introduction. However, the strawberry was too expensive for him. He couldn\u2019t afford many.Han Fei chuckled. It would be a miracle if there was any reaction. How could a strawberry be a spiritual fruit?Han Fei observed carefully, only to be rendered speechless. He saw peanuts as huge as apples and grapes as huge as melons. They were all multiple times larger than he\u2019d seen before.There were also plenty of flowers that Han Fei could recognize. If they were on Earth, their unique colors would\u2019ve made them the rarest and most precious decorations.Of the thousand plants here, Han Fei could recognize a hundred of them.\u201cWait, potatoes?\u201dHan Fei\u2019s eyes glittered as he discovered potatoes in this alternate world.Then, Han Fei saw carrots, peppers, and garlic\u2026\u201cGarlic\u2026\u201dHan Fei remembered roasted shrimps when he saw the garlic. He immediately swallowed.To Han Fei\u2019s disappointment, the items in this place were unaffordable for him. He even thought that the village leader might not be able to buy them.Later, Han Fei discovered dozens of other plants that he knew. There were also a thousand that he didn\u2019t know.Breathing quickly, Han Fei came to the old man and asked, \u201cGrandpa, what will you do if you can\u2019t sell the\u2026 spices?\u201dThe old drank his liquor for quite a while before he finally replied lazily, \u201cThey\u2019re left there if they can\u2019t be sold. They\u2019ll grow out again later.\u201dHan Fei was dumbfounded. They were abandoned if they couldn\u2019t be sold? Wasn\u2019t it a waste?The old man glanced at Han Fei. \u201cYou want them? Give me the money.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI don\u2019t have that much money.\u201dThe old man waved his hand. \u201cGet out of here if you don\u2019t have money. You\u2019re disrupting my rest.\u201dHan Fei was gloomy. He did not intend to return empty-handed. He was almost certain that the old man was unusual, or the place would\u2019ve been robbed a long time ago.After a long silence, Han Fei asked, \u201cGrandpa, it seems that nobody is taking care of your garden. Do you want me to give you a hand?\u201dWithout opening his eyes, the old man said, \u201cBoy, come again when your spiritual beast is awakened!\u201dHan Fei squinted and said, \u201cOkay.\u201dHan Fei looked back many times on his way back and imagined what food he could make with the ingredients in the garden. He would not give them up easily. After all, he would have to spend a long time in this wretched world\u2026Li Gang, however, was confused. \u201cBoss, that crappy old man was rather cocky. Why don\u2019t we beat him up? Also, those spiritual fruits are barely effective. Are you really going to farm for him?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cBeat him up? Do you know what\u2019s most fatal for gangsters?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHan Fei explained, \u201cLack of sensitivity. I assure you that he can throw you into the ocean with one hand if you ask for him trouble.\u201d\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t think so! I never heard of anyone fighting the old man before!\u201dToo lazy to explain it further, Han Fei merely asked, \u201cWhat do you think is the fastest way of making money?\u201dLi Gang said without thinking, \u201cCollecting protection fees!\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201dHan Fei pondered as he walked. He couldn\u2019t get a fish tide if he was not allowed to go to the ocean, and he had no access to spiritual energy without the fish tides. Although he had ten bottles of Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid, it might not be enough for him to make the breakthrough at the peak of level six.He couldn\u2019t drink the Swallowed Spirit Soup in the school, either. Did he have to buy fish at the market?No! That\u2019s too expensive! How I wish I could open a barbecue restaurant!Taking a deep breath, Han Fei said, \u201cFine, there is only one way. Go buy some alcohol.\u201dLi Gang asked, \u201cBoss, how much?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cWell, give me a hundred kilograms for a start.\u201d\u201cPu\u2026\u201dLi Gang was dumbfounded. What? A hundred kilograms?Han Fei said, \u201cYou will do what I tell you to.\u201d\u201cYes, boss.\u201d\u2026One day later, Han Fei finally made a tank of hard liquor. Most alcohol on the floating island was of a low degree. After a day of hard work, he purified the alcohol and created a tank of liquor of fifty degrees.Han Fei said, \u201cXiao Gang, come here.\u201dLi Gang had restored thirty percent of his strength. He jumped over and said, \u201cBoss.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cHave a taste of this.\u201dLi Gang did not know what Han Fei did. He only knew that only forty kilograms of the alcohol he bought were left.When Han Fei poured the liquor out, Li Gang was amazed by the aroma. \u201cBoss, this alcohol smells great.\u201dLi Gang breathed it in for a while in fascination and drank up the liquid in the bowl.\u201cAh! Ouch! It\u2019s burning!\u201dScared, Li Gang thought that Han Fei was trying to kill him. His throat seemed to be on fire\u2026 But why did it feel so good?After a minute, Li Gang breathed hard with a reddened face.\u201cBoss\u2026 Boss\u2026\u201dBAM!Han Fei nodded in satisfaction after Li Gang fell on the ground. Wasn\u2019t that old man into alcohol?\u2026Han Fei returned to the plantation with twenty kilograms of liquor. The old man was still enjoying the sunlight.Bo\u2026Han Fei lifted the cover of the container, and the fragrance immediately spread.The old man, who was lying in the chair lazily, jumped up and stared at Han Fei. \u201cIt is\u2026 alcohol?\u201dHan Fei grinned. \u201cGrandpa, I\u2019ve specifically brought it for you. Why don\u2019t you have a taste?\u201dThe old man grabbed the container and sniffed. He was immediately refreshed. \u201cThis is good!\u201dThen, the old man had a full mouthful of it. His wildness shocked Han Fei.\u201cHahaha! This is the best alcohol! Where did you get this?\u201dThe old man looked like a whole different person. He looked at Han Fei hopefully.Han Fei said, \u201cYou needn\u2019t care about where it\u2019s from, but I\u2019m the only one in Heavenly Water Village who can obtain it.\u201dThe old man said with a smile, \u201cNot just Heavenly Water Village, you can\u2019t find such liquor even in the city.\u201dHan Fei\u2019s eyes narrowed. The city? The old man was indeed unusual. According to He Xiaoyu, few people had been to the town, much less the city.The old man enjoyed another mouthful of the drink, before he said, \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI would like to trade this liquor for your spices.\u201dThe old man nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s indeed more delicious than any alcohol I had. I\u2019ll give you a hundred kilograms of spices for that.\u201dIt was most surprising for Han Fei. The man charged one mid-quality pearl for a strawberry yesterday, but he offered a hundred kilograms for free today?\u201cAll right!\u201dHan Fei took out a big backpack and went to the peppers and garlics, filling the backpack with them.The old man was startled. \u201cBoy, they are not delicious. One of them is burning hot, and the other simply stinks. These red fruits, on the other hand, are sweet and sour.\u201dIgnoring that, Han Fei asked, \u201cGrandpa, do you have ginger?\u201d\u201cGinger?\u201d\u201cWell, they are yellow blocks that grow in the soil.\u201dThe old man understood. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about yellow balls? Yellow balls are over there.\u201dSeeing that the old man was pointing at potatoes, Han Fei shook his head and said, \u201cThey are thinner and smaller.\u201dThe old man looked at Han Fei in surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about tongue-numb? It\u2019s not tasteful at all. I never dug them out. How do you know about tongue-numb?\u201dHan Fei grinned. \u201cJust leave that alone. I\u2019ll bring the product to you after it\u2019s ready.\u201dSquinting, the old man said, \u201cAre you going to make medicines with them? I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not possible. Those are the most inferior spiritual fruits. Their effects can\u2019t be good.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon.\u201dUnder the old man\u2019s guidance, Han Fei dug a hundred kilograms of ginger, peppers, and garlic.Before he reached his house, Han Fei shouted, \u201cXiao Gang, rent a place! We\u2019re going to start a barbecue business!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: The Most Delicious FoodAt the center of the market in the port, Han Fei rented a stand for ten mid-quality pearls.At this moment, a plate had been raised, catching everyone\u2019s attention.Someone said in disdain, \u201cYou are truly confident. \u2018The Most Delicious Food\u2019? Less bragging, please!\u201dOther dealers were sneering, \u201cHow many foods have you had? How do you know that it\u2019s the most delicious food?\u201dSomeone was curious. \u201cWhat is going to be sold here?\u201dStanding before the grill, Han Fei declared to the crowd, \u201cToday, we launch our barbecue business. All customers will enjoy a fifty percent discount. I guarantee that you will bite your tongue off when you\u2019re having our food!\u201d\u201cBarbecue? What\u2019s that?\u201d asked a passerby curiously.Han Fei said, \u201cDon\u2019t be hasty. Some of the food will be distributed for free. You don\u2019t have to pay unless you want more.\u201d\u201cReally? Boy, are you the owner of this business?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cOf course. I never go back on my word. Xiao Gang, start the fire.\u201dLittle white fish, sea conches, clams, yellow fish, shrimps\u2026 Dozens of seafoods had been placed on Han Fei\u2019s long grill.Han Fei was delighted. The spiritual energy in those seafoods had been entirely absorbed, so they were actually of little use to him.He took out a pepper and shouted at everyone, \u201cGuys, you may find it hard to believe, but this is Red Tears Fruit, a spiritual fruit that costs one mid-quality pearl!\u201dHua!The crowd seethed. You\u2019re making food with a spiritual fruit that costs one mid-quality pearl?Someone was unconvinced. \u201cLiar. How can you make food with such extravagant stuff? What\u2019s the price of your product?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThis spiritual fruit can be used repetitively. It\u2019s not expensive. As for the prices, they\u2019re all on this board.\u201dAfter Han Fei showed the prices, everybody whispered again.Someone scolded, \u201cBoy, are you taking us for fools? Ten low-quality pearls for one kilogram of little white fish? That\u2019s dozens of times higher than the market price!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! You are a terrible businessman!\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t buy it no matter how delicious it is!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll only have a taste of the free food and leave after that!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to see why this boy is confident in making the most delicious food in the world.\u201d\u2026Li Gang sweated hard as people criticized them. He was also shocked when he saw the menu. He did not believe that anyone would buy such expensive food.Han Fei took out the ginger and the garlic and shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s all a matter of perspective. Is a little white fish with three kinds of spiritual fruits still a little white white? Besides, there is also the finest oil and appropriate salt. You should leave now if you don\u2019t want to get addicted to it later.\u201dSomeone mocked him. \u201cWho knows if they are spiritual fruits?\u201d\u201cNone of us has seen a spiritual fruit. Of course you can say that it\u2019s a spiritual fruit. But how can a spiritual fruit only cost one mid-quality pearl?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cYou can go to the southern plantation and ask. All the spiritual fruits in my store are authentic. I\u2019ll compensate you if you find anything fake.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a bold statement. He doesn\u2019t seem to be lying.\u201d\u201cDoes he have so much money?\u201d\u201cHuh? Isn\u2019t he that piece of garbage?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m told that Tang Ge is his brother and has given him a lot of good stuff. He\u2019s a genius now, not garbage anymore.\u201dAt this moment, Han Fei was brushing the seafood with fish oil. Every gasped at how generous he was with the oil, which was extremely rare and precious. Han Fei was using it so casually that some of the oil was dripping into the fire.Li Gang, on the other hand, had chopped the peppers and garlic into pieces.After Han Fei smeared the garlic on the food, people immediately exclaimed.\u201cWow! It smells great!\u201d\u201cIs this the power of spiritual fruits?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m told that the fragrance of spiritual fruits can keep people from walking away. It seems that the spiritual fruits are authentic!\u201dNot just the onlookers, even Han Fei himself swallowed. The fragrance was even more intense after the peppers were added.Han Fei shouted, \u201cEverybody, hurry up! The first batch of barbecue will be ready in one minute. It\u2019s free. If it\u2019s delicious, you can buy more later. Everything is at a discount today!\u201dOne minute later, Han Fei bellowed, \u201cAll right, Xiao Gang! Next batch!\u201dEverybody stared at the barbecue in Han Fei\u2019s hands.Han Fei cut the barbecue into hundreds of pieces with a dagger and said, \u201cCome on! Have a taste, everyone! Don\u2019t fight!\u201d\u201cLet me! Let me!\u201d\u201cGet out of the way! I\u2019ll go first!\u201d\u201cI came here early! Give it to me, boy!\u201d\u201cStop squeezing! I\u2019ll have a taste for you!\u201dLi Gang was dumbfounded by people\u2019s enthusiasm. They must be aiming for the spiritual fruits. Who would really pay for such expensive food?A young man at the front of the queue got a piece of clam. At this moment, the clam meat was golden and smelled great with the three spiritual fruits. He was astounded when he popped the meat into his mouth.\u201cDear Sea God, why is there such delicious food in this world? Is this still clam meat? How can clam meat be so delicious? It\u2019s unbelievable\u2026\u201dThe young man was lost for words. His limited vocabulary could not express his feelings at all.Not just the young man, everyone who got a sample was shocked. The succulency and hotness of the food covered the original stink in it. They all felt that their tongues were dancing in delight.\u201cDelicious!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so delicious! I\u2019ve never had anything so wonderful!\u201d\u201cThis must be the food the Sea God enjoys! Why has it come to the mortal world?\u201dMany people swallowed after they had the food. Staring at the new batch on the grill, nobody intended to leave. Some of them had intended to go fishing, but they were stuck here and did not want to leave anymore.Those who were at the end of the queue stood on their tiptoes. The delicious smell of the food was too much for them to handle.Han Fei looked at them and said, \u201cPlease, don\u2019t stand in other people\u2019s way! From now on, the food is no longer free! But there\u2019s still a fifty percent discount! Hurry up if you want any!\u201d\u201cI would like a kilogram of yellow fish.\u201d\u201cI want five kilograms of white fish.\u201d\u201cGive me a small octopus.\u201d\u201cOne complete clam, please.\u201dSomeone looked at the person next to him and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you would only have the free food?\u201dThe person sniffed. \u201cI\u2019m a man of integrity, I pay for what I eat. I\u2019m planning to support his business.\u201dEverybody squeezed close. Li Gang was dumbfounded. Weren\u2019t they all cursing just now? Why had they changed their attitude?Li Gang was drooling himself. It truly smelled great! The price of the food was a hundred times higher than usual, but people were still passionate about it. He had never thought that anyone would buy a clam with twenty low-quality pearls. It was truly luxurious.As Han Fei worked on, people on the whole street were attracted to him subconsciously.Someone smelled the enticing scent when they came to the market.Someone was about to set sail, but they caught the smell and decided to check it out.Zhang Han was enjoying the sunflower seeds in his store casually when he smelled the food. He immediately threw the sunflower seeds away. It smelled great! What\u2019s the food?Even Xiao Qin, the most nonchalant person in the port, was frowning. A certain indescribable fragrance from the market made her swallow.Suddenly, someone shouted from the back of the crowd, \u201cGet out of the way! What are you doing here? Are you not planning to pay your fish tax?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: DroolingZhang Han squeezed through the crowd. He was curious about the source of the enticing smell.The crowd slightly scattered, allowing Zhang Han to see the plate of \u201cThe Most Delicious Food\u201d as well as Han Fei, who was brushing the fish oil before the grill. Li Gang, who was beaten up by Han Fei before, was helping Han Fei.Zhang Han was startled. It does not seem right! Why are you running a stand instead of going fishing? Isn\u2019t the Fishing Trial only several days away? You\u2019ve already given up yourself?Then, Zhang Han saw the astounding menu. Ten low-quality pearls for one little while fish, and twenty for a clam?\u201cTch!\u201dZhang Han gasped. He thought that he was cunning enough, but from what he had just seen, he could almost call himself a conscientious businessman. Look at that. The clam was pegged at hundreds of times its market price, and yet people were fighting for it.\u201cBoy, give me a clam.\u201d\u201cChild, I would like ten lobsters.\u201d\u201cYoung boss, I want two sea conches.\u201d\u2026Zhang Han was amazed. What a huge profit!Han Fei had already noticed Zhang Han. He asked, \u201cManager Zhang, do you want anything? Everything here is at half-price! You can\u2019t miss that!\u201dZhang Han gasped again. \u201cYou charge ten low-quality pearls for little white fish?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cToday, only five.\u201dZhang Han: \u201c\u2026\u201dDo you think five are few? Five low-quality pearls meant five hundred sea coins, which were enough to buy dozens of little white fish.Han Fei was generous enough to give three lobsters to Zhang Han.Zhang Han accepted them in confusion. He bit the gold meat and the enticing powder on it, only to be confounded. How could there be anything so delicious?God knew what Zhang Han was thinking, but he asked, \u201cDid you pay your administration fee?\u201dNot just Han Fei, many other people looked at Zhang Han in surprise. You\u2019re thinking about that instead of enjoying the cuisine?Han Fei patted his price board with a smile. Zhang Han glanced at it and almost jumped when he saw that a lobster cost a low-quality pearl. Did he just eat a low-quality pearl?Zhang Han asked, \u201cHan Fei, why is your food so expensive?\u201dLi Gang had never seen eye to eye with Zhang Han. He said, \u201cWhat do you know? It has three spiritual fruits as ingredients. You think they are cheap?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dZhang Han nearly threw the lobster away. Spiritual fruits as spices? Was Han Fei out of his mind?Zhang Han was relieved to see the peppers. He said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t acquire your spiritual fruits from the old man in the plantation, did you?\u201dZhang Han knew the plantation and even paid a mid-quality pearl for a spiritual fruit there. It was delicious but not useful at all! The spiritual energy he gained from it was not even as much as that of a yellow fish.Han Fei said, \u201cThere are many kinds of spiritual fruits. Some can help you make breakthroughs, and some are natural spices that can bring you happiness.\u201dZhang Han was gloomy. It certainly did not bring him happiness!Han Fei asked, \u201cManager Zhang, do you want anything else?\u201dZhang Han snorted and left without saying anything. He thought about many things. Since Tang Ge was recruited by the angel as a disciple, Han Fei had changed into a different person. Had he been modified by the angel, too? In that case, Zhang Han certainly couldn\u2019t take advantage of him anymore.\u2026Han Fei was as busy as a bee for an entire day. He sold hundreds of products and only used up half of his materials. He earned more than five thousand low-quality pearls, which equaled fifty mid-quality pearls.Li Gang was even more delighted. He had joined the Tigers so that his girlfriend could live a better life, but he had never made as much money in the Tigers. That was fifty mid-quality pearls! Normal people couldn\u2019t have saved so much money over ten years.Suddenly, Han Fei shouted, \u201cXiao Gang, you will take it from here! I\u2019m exhausted!\u201dLi Gang was surprised. Was he allowed to do it in person?He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m flattered\u2026\u201dHan Fei said gloomily, \u201cDo you want me to die of exhaustion! Do it for me!\u201dThen, Han Fei took a rest. Looking at the buckets of white fish, yellow fish, lobsters, and sea conches behind him, he felt that spiritual energy was surging at him. He had absorbed more than four thousand points of spiritual energy in only one day. His total storage was more than five thousand points.Most importantly, he did not lose anything. All he paid was a hundred kilograms of alcohol that only cost five mid-quality pearls.Li Gang had watched it long enough to know what to do. He only needed to brush the fish oil and the pepper juice and spray the garlic. It was a simple task.After a brief rest, Han Fei asked, \u201cXiao Gang, where are your sidekicks?\u201dLi Gang found it hard to answer the question. Most of his sidekicks were probably as dead as could be.He said, \u201cI think they are probably fish poop now.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c\u2026\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cDo you have other sidekicks?\u201dLi Gang said, \u201cNo! There are few rogues in the village, and most of them are in gangs.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your girlfriend doing at home?\u201dLi Gang immediately changed his face. \u201cBoss, my girlfriend is my life! She\u2026\u201dHan Fei interrupted him. \u201cWhat are you thinking? I was going to ask if your girlfriend could work in my barbecue stand. I\u2019ll give you ten percent of the profit.\u201dLi Gang was stunned. \u201cB-Boss, are you serious?\u201dIt was beyond Li Gang\u2019s expectations. After he was crippled by the Tigers, he planned to retire and did not expect Han Fei to help him cure his wound and offer him ten percent of the profit.Li Gang asked again, \u201cBoss, are you serious?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cWhy would I lie to you? This money is too insignificant for me right now.\u201dLi Gang was delighted. It\u2019s not insignificant for me! Considering the sales today, one percent of the profit was five mid-quality pearls, and it would double when the half price was over. That was much more than what he could earn among the Tigers!Han Fei gave a fish or a skewer of shrimps to Li Gang now and then. Their spiritual energy was absorbed whenever they passed him.At night, when they were about to close the business, Wang Jie and He Mingtang arrived.Wang Jie was enraged to see Han Fei. \u201cHan Fei, what are you doing? Are you adapting yourself to the life of a low-level fisher? The Fishing Trial is around the corner, and you are running a business instead of cultivation?\u201dLi Gang said angrily, \u201cMaster Wang Jie, my boss is a very capable man. The Fishing Trial is not a problem at all.\u201d\u201cShut up,\u201d said Wang Jie gloomily. \u201cHan Fei, you will speak for yourself.\u201dHan Fei said solemnly, \u201cMaster, my foundation is weak, and I need enough wealth to build up my foundation\u2026\u201dWang Jie said, \u201cSay something that I can understand.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI feel that I\u2019m about to make a breakthrough. I need to make some money to buy the ancillary liquids.\u201dWang Jie said, \u201cHehe! How much money can you possibly earn? I didn\u2019t believe it when I heard the rumor just now, but you really turned out to be here.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cMaster, I earned fifty mid-quality pearls in a day!\u201dWang Jie said, \u201cShut up! Do you think fifty mid-quality pearls are something? Wait\u2026 How many mid-quality pearls?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cFifty!\u201dHe Mingtang demanded, \u201cHan Fei, do you think that mid-quality pearls are yellow fish? Fifty?\u201dHuala\u2026Li Gang poured the box of low-quality pearls out and declared, \u201cI said that my boss was a capable man! This box is almost full.\u201dWang Jie: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe Mingtang: \u201c\u2026\u201dWang Jie and He Mingtang finally noticed the price of Han Fei\u2019s foods.\u201cTch\u2026\u201dBoth of them gasped.Wang Jie asked, \u201cDid anyone really buy something so expensive?\u201dHan Fei said to Li Gang, \u201cRoast some lobsters and clams for Mr. Wang and Mr. He later.\u201dLi Gang asked, \u201cShould I charge them?\u201dHan Fei was lost for words. How can I charge my teachers?A moment later, Wang Jie and He Mingtang were almost drooling. The intense fragrance fascinated them.When Wang Jie learned that Han Fei added three kinds of spiritual fruits to the clam, he was lost for words. Do you think you are a magnate?However, after having a bite of the lobster, Wang Jie gave up his complaint.He Mingtang said, \u201cHan Fei, get me a few more lobsters for He Xiaoyu.\u201d\u201cGive me some, too.\u201dSuddenly, a crisp female voice called out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Slow and SteadyEverybody looked at the newcomer, who turned out to be Xiao Qin, the receptionist at the port.Xiao Qin\u2019s real name was Jiang Qin. She had worked in the port for three years. Every day, she wouldn\u2019t leave until everyone was off duty.Nobody knew Jiang Qin\u2019s past, and nobody was interested in it. After all, what she did was just a regular job.Of course, Han Fei knew none of that. He only knew that the girl always gave him a few reminders before he set sail although she seemed indifferent.Han Fei greeted her. \u201cHey, Sister Qin is here! Please wait a moment. Xiao Gang, get more food going!\u201dSeeing Han Fei\u2019s income, Wang Jie realized that he could not criticize him anymore, so he pulled Han Fei aside and said, \u201cWhy are you hanging around with Li Gang? He\u2019s a worthless gangster.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cSir, he was kicked out by the Tigers and was begging. How could I leave him alone?\u201dHan Fei spoke so matter-of-factly that Wang Jie almost believed him. But hadn\u2019t Li Gang gotten kicked out of the Tigers because of you?In the end, Wang Jie said thoughtfully, \u201cTraining does require resources, but you must not depend on them too much. There are only seven days until the Fishing Trial. Do what you see fit!\u201dWang Jie and He Mingtang left. Li Gang packed up the food for Jiang Qin.Jiang Qin had a bite of the lobster and beamed with interest. She finished the lobster quickly.She looked at Han Fei thoughtfully and said, \u201cTake a walk with me?\u201dStunned, Han Fei said to Li Gang, \u201cXiao Gang, you will clean up the tools later. Take the low-quality pearls and prepare the materials for tomorrow.\u201dLi Gang asked, \u201cHuh? I\u2019m going to take care of the pearls?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cOf course! Isn\u2019t the pack of pearls heavy?\u201dLi Gang was dumbfounded. Heavy? That\u2019s money! You\u2019re complaining that money is heavy?\u2026Jiang Qin observed everything. It was not until they were out of the market that she finally asked, \u201cThere are no fish tides, are there?\u201dHan Fei certainly could not admit it. \u201cOf course there are! I was attacked by fish tides twice. Even my boat was damaged.\u201dJiang Qin, however, changed the topic. \u201cTherefore, you should pay for the damage.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c???\u201dJiang Qin said, \u201cForget it. Everybody has their secrets. You\u2019d better hide yours well. On the other hand, how did you get the spiritual fruits from the plantation?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThat\u2019s easy! I gave the old man some liquor, and he gave them to me!\u201dThere was no telling if Jiang Qin was convinced or not; she simply glanced at Han Fei and said, \u201cI\u2019m told that you\u2019ve been advancing fast although you barely achieved anything in the past four years. What\u2019s your Spiritual Heritage?\u201dHan Fei was shocked. The girl was probably unusual. He felt that he had been seen through.He replied, \u201cLevel Two, Low Quality.\u201dJiang Qin frowned and said, \u201cLying is not a good thing, especially when you are lying to the wrong person.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cSister Qin, I\u2019m truly Level Two, Low Quality! Actually, I was Level One, High Quality in the test, and I became Level Two after an incident.\u201dHan Fei did not intend to hide that. After all, the result of his test was publicly known. He merely hoped that the girl wouldn\u2019t make him do the test again.\u201cHuh?\u201dJiang Qin turned around quickly. \u201cYour Spiritual Heritage changed?\u201dHan Fei said in a hurry, \u201cI had a spiritual fruit that my brother left for me.\u201dHe did not know if Jiang Qin believed it or not. After walking another ten minutes, Jiang Qin said, \u201cPrepare yourself for the Fishing Trial. The higher your place, the better, if you want more spiritual fruits from the plantation.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cOkay!\u201dJiang Qin left after that. Han Fei was puzzled. What did she mean by what she said?Han Fei checked his spiritual energy after he got home. It was already more than seven thousand points. However, he was not in a hurry to make the breakthrough. He intended to upgrade his Spiritual Heritage to Level Three, which required ten thousand points of spiritual energy.\u2026The next day, in the barbecue stand, Han Fei finally saw Xiao Hong, Li Gang\u2019s girlfriend that he talked about all the time.Li Gang said, \u201cXiao Hong, this is my boss. He\u2019s an extraordinary person.\u201dHan Fei nodded politely, although it was obviously too sophisticated for a twelve-year-old.However, Han Fei secretly chuckled. He thought that Xiao Hong was a beautiful girl, but after seeing her, he wanted to tell Li Gang that he needn\u2019t worry that his girlfriend would elope, because few men liked girls who weighed as much as themselves.Li Gang weighed at least a hundred and seventy kilograms, but Han Fei did not think that he could win a fight against Xiao Hong.After giving the barbecue stand to Xiao Hong and Li Gang, Han Fei was free again. He simply sat behind the stand and delivered the seafood to Li Gang after absorbing its spiritual energy.There were only half as many customers today. After all, most fishers could not afford the full price.Thankfully, many people had come from far away after the promotion yesterday.By sunset, Han Fei had more than ten thousand points of spiritual energy, but he was not in a hurry at all. There were plenty of places for him to use spiritual energy.Li Gang shouted, \u201cBoss, we are running out of spiritual fruits! They will probably be used up tomorrow!\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cAll right, roast everything on the menu. I\u2019ll get some spiritual fruits for us.\u201dA dealer nearby immediately approached him. \u201cIs it easy to obtain the spiritual fruits? Can you get some for me?\u201dHan Fei said with a generous smile, \u201cUncle, it costs one mid-quality pearl! In fact, I\u2019m not earning much although there are a lot of customers. I dare not go to the plantation until I have a hundred mid-quality pearls.\u201d\u201cTch\u2026\u201dThe dealer counted and found the price unaffordable. A hundred mid-quality pearls equaled a high-quality pearl! How many people in Heavenly Water Village had a high-quality pearl?After seeing the dealer off, Han Fei went to the plantation with twenty kilograms of liquor and a pack of barbecue.Han Fei was dumbfounded to see the old man enjoying alcohol with the peanuts that were obviously just dug out.Han Fei was lost for words. The old man had learned such a classic combination on his own? Han Fei had done it plenty of times himself. He always prepared a lot of peanuts when he set sail in his previous life.\u201cHuh? Boy, what\u2019s in that? It smells rather great!\u201dHan Fei came with the barbecue and the liquor. \u201cGrandpa, like I said, I do not take your things without giving anything in return. This is barbecue. Why don\u2019t you try it?\u201dThe old man looked at them and said, \u201cHuh? Regular white fish, clams\u2026\u201dThen, the old man changed his expression. \u201cYou added spiritual fruits to such worthless food? But it does smell great. I wonder how it tastes.\u201dAfter a bite of the clam, the old man\u2019s face changed so greatly that Han Fei was amused.\u201cIs\u2026 Is this the white weary fruit?\u201dThe old man was full of disbelief. How could the white weary fruit be turned into a delicious food?Han Fei pointed at the garlic and said, \u201cIt tastes good after it\u2019s crumbled and roasted, right?\u201dThe old man ate half of the clam and finally looked at Han Fei thoughtfully. \u201cBoy, did you make it on your own?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cEverything is useful in this world for people who can use them.\u201dThe old man swallowed a mouthful of the liquor and looked at Han Fei in a different way.The old man said, \u201cBoy, did you propose to take care of the garden for me?\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cIs it possible?\u201dThe old man said, \u201cYes, but about the liquor and this\u2026\u201dHan Fei added, \u201cBarbecue.\u201dThe old man said, \u201cYou need to provide liquor and barbecue for me.\u201dHan Fei grinned and said, \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll take care of the garden for you after the Fishing Trial. However, the spiritual fruits I took from your place the other day have been used up\u2026\u201dThe old man waved his hand, as if it were not a big deal. \u201cYou can take more. Well, no more than a hundred kilograms each.\u201dSoon after Han Fei left, a woman came out of the house.\u201cYou agreed so easily, gourmet grandpa?\u201dThe old man said, \u201cHe\u2019s not a bad guy.\u201dThe woman said, \u201cInteresting.\u201dHan Fei would\u2019ve been surprised if he were there. Wasn\u2019t that Jiang Qin?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: Forge the UniverseLi Gang said, \u201cBoss, the Fishing Trial will be held tomorrow. Do you really not need to train?\u201dHan Fei was playing with a little white fish. He nodded and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. I probably should.\u201dLi Gang: \u201c\u2026\u201dEver since Han Fei became a public figure, his enemies had abandoned the thought of getting rid of him.In the cave, Han Fei practiced the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Conditioning again. Even though Han Fei\u2019s body qualities had been significantly improved, he still sweated profusely after he completed all 108 movements.For Han Fei, there was not any obstacle to level seven as long as he had enough spiritual energy.Training with the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Conditioning cannot increase the capacity of my spiritual energy anymore. I\u2019d better make the advancement now!Han Fei checked his own data.Owner: Han FeiLevel: Six (Intermediate Fisher)Spiritual Energy: 48,201 (249)Spiritual Heritage: Level Two, Low Quality (Upgradeable)Weapon: Purple Bamboo RodMain Art: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)\u2026Han Fei almost couldn\u2019t stop grinning. If his barbecue business were more affordable for ordinary people, he would\u2019ve had even more storage room for spiritual energy.Han Fei sat cross-legged and took a deep breath.Break!Han Fei\u2019s body glowed, and spiritual energy appeared on the surface of his body out of nowhere. However, the calabash did not swallow any of it, maybe because the spiritual energy was too ordinary for it.Han Fei felt that his body was expanding and his bones were shivering. Tremendous spiritual energy was surging through his body.Crack.Han Fei became a level-seven fisher, but he did not stop there. Other level-seven fishers needed to absorb spiritual energy and nurture themselves, but Han Fei had plenty of spiritual energy!The spiritual energy he stored was still surging and brushing Han Fei\u2019s bones, flesh, and organs. It was not until the heat became unbearable again that Han Fei finally stopped his cultivation session.\u201cHu\u2026\u201dHe opened his eyes and rose.Hearing the cracking sounds of his bones, Han Fei felt that he was never in a better state. He could\u2019ve knocked Li Gang out with one casual attack now.Owner: Han FeiLevel: Seven (Advanced Fisher)Spiritual Energy: 36,008 (279)Spiritual Heritage: Level Two, Low Quality (Upgradeable)Weapon: Purple Bamboo RodMain Art: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)\u2026Han Fei clicked his tongue after seeing that his storage was reduced by more than 12,000 points. Did other people need so much spiritual energy for a breakthrough? Wouldn\u2019t that have drained them?Han Fei never realized that one had to train himself day and night from the beginning of a level to the peak of it, so that enough spiritual energy could be prepared. It was not the same as his breakthrough at all.It was still late at night. Han Fei considered if he should upgrade his Spiritual Heritage. After all, it only cost ten thousand points of spiritual energy. But he gave it up on the idea. He had already caught enough attention, and it would be a problem if his Spiritual Heritage was further improved to Level Three. On the other hand, he was finally able to see what Forge the Universe was now.Han Fei opened his hands, and the calabash appeared in his palm.Five thousand points of spiritual energy were nothing for him now.\u201cActivate.\u201dStunned, Han Fei felt that the world was swirling and darkening. When it was bright again, he found himself in a round space about three meters in diameter.Below him was damp mud.Around him was infinite, pure darkness where nothing could be seen.Han Fei was astounded. What the heck? Where was he?He touched the dark boundary carefully, only to be blocked by a marvelous power that felt like an invisible wall.He couldn\u2019t help but speculate that Forge the Universe was inside the calabash.In that case, wouldn\u2019t his calabash equal to a space ring?I need to test it with Li Gang and see if I could get him in. Huh\u2026 What if it kills him? I\u2019d better try yellow fish first. However, this space is too small. Can it be larger?The moment the idea occurred to him, Han Fei saw spiritual energy surging in and the darkness backing off. The area was now larger than before.Huh! Spiritual Energy can be used to expand the coverage of this place. I shouldn\u2019t expand it too much in case it consumes a lot of spiritual energy. How can I get out of here?Han Fei tried to think, and he appeared where he\u2019d been the next second.Han Fei checked his data. His spiritual energy lowered to 30,008 points, which meant that six thousand points were spent just now. Other than the five thousand points for the activation of Forge the Universe, the remaining thousand points must\u2019ve been used for the expansion.He tried bringing items in. As expected, they could be taken in when he thought to do so.He inserted a lot of things into Forge the Universe, but when he tried the clam, he discovered that there was some obscure resistance.Is it because the clam is alive? But I did put it in eventually!Han Fei did not know the limits of Forge the Universe. He naturally dared not try it with a person, which would expose him.Han Fei did not stop experimenting until it was almost dawn.Today was the Fishing Trial which thousands of students would take part in. Han Fei was quite confident. He was already a level-seven fisher. If he hadn\u2019t intended to keep a low profile, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for him to reach level eight.\u2026Everybody arrived at the school early. Some were nervous, and some were talking and laughing. Han Fei knew that all of them were anxious except that the latter pretended they were not.He Xiaoyu grimaced at Han Fei.Han Fei felt something different when he saw He Xiaoyu. He asked, shocked, \u201cYou made a breakthrough?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said in surprise, \u201cHow did you know?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI can see that you are in high spirits, so I assumed that you made a breakthrough.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said excitedly, \u201cHaha! I made a breakthrough after I was grounded for two days! I\u2019m determined to make it to the top hundred in the test.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThen you should work harder.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cWhat about you? My father said that you started a barbecue business. It\u2019s indeed delicious. Can you give me a discount?\u201dSeeing that He Xiaoyu was almost drooling, Han Fei knew that she had been thinking about it.Han Fei said, \u201cOf course, you can pay however much you want.\u201dHe Xiaoyu asked, \u201cHow about ten sea coins for a clam?\u201dShocked, Han Fei looked at He Xiaoyu and said, \u201cTry buying a raw clam on the street with ten sea coins. That\u2019s far from enough.\u201dHe Xiaoyu argued, \u201cYou said I could pay however much I wanted.\u201dHan Fei decided to let her go. After all, He Xiaoyu was his only friend in this place besides Tang Ge. He simply waved his hand and said, \u201cForget it. If you want them, you can take them for free. But don\u2019t waste them.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dHe Xiaoyu jumped in delight. Her head had been filled with barbecue since her father brought it for her the other day. She thought that even the Crimson Sea Fruit might not be as delicious as barbecue.\u201cAttention, everyone!\u201dAt this moment, the headmaster bellowed to the playground.\u201cYou all know what the Fishing Trial means, but don\u2019t feel too much pressure. As long as you try your best, you will be fine. Remember, your life matters more than anything else.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: Beginning of the TrialThousands of boats were launched from the floating island simultaneously. Some of them were occupied by students, and some by their parents who were seeing them off.Some of the parents were weeping. The Fishing Trial was a life-and-death test. For a better rank, all the students would be competing with their best.As a result, the trial was highly dangerous. Casualties were unavoidable even though all the teachers and the supervisors were deployed.The best record in history was that ten percent died, thirty percent were injured, and sixty percent survived. That was the highest percentage of survival.All the twelve-year-old kids were gathered on the boats. The village leader spoke to them from a floating boat, \u201cSame as before, the score system will be adopted in this trial. Your score will be calculated according to the level of the fish you catch. The top thousand places will be qualified to awaken your spirit. However, remember not to aim too high. Just do your best.\u201dEverybody listened carefully. Nobody was impatient.The students\u2019 parents were shouting far away. \u201cSon, life first! Listen to the village leader! Don\u2019t act tough!\u201d\u201cDaughter, it doesn\u2019t matter even if you can\u2019t pass the trial. There\u2019s still a chance of natural awakening!\u201d\u201cJust give up if your opponents are too strong in a competition!\u201d\u201cYou must be wary of other boats!\u201dHe Xiaoyu searched for Tang Ge, but there were simply too many boats. He Xiaoyu, on the other hand, was cheering him up not far away.The villager leader said, \u201cAttention, everyone! The trial will last for twelve hours. Those who are rescued by the inspectors will automatically fail. The trial will start in a quarter.\u201dThe wind was not huge on the ocean, and the morning sun dyed its surface gold. Several dark spots appeared on the blue sky.When they were close, people finally recognized that they were boats.Someone exclaimed, \u201cHey! That\u2019s the unique boat of the Tigers! Li Hu hasn\u2019t been around lately. I\u2019m told that he was striving for level eight. I wonder if he has succeeded.\u201dSomeone pointed at the other direction. \u201cLook! It\u2019s the Wang family\u2019s boat! Wang Baiyu is the only one taking the trial this year. He\u2019s said to be a future Armorist!\u201dMany people did not know what an Armorist was, but it sounded like something impressive.\u201cLook over there! It\u2019s Xia Wushuang, the only person with a Spiritual Heritage of Level Four, Low-quality in Heavenly Water Village this year!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Xiang Nan from the north campus. I was told that he is already a level-eight fisher.\u201dHan Fei was lost for words. Why do we have to gather in school and come together, while those people can show themselves off in front of everyone?However, everybody\u2019s eyes were soon fixed on the east, where two people seemed to be walking out of the sun. They were radiating gold.Everybody fell silent. The monster had arrived.They were none other than Fang Ze and Tang Ge who had been away for days. Nobody would say that it was unfair. A Level Seven Spiritual Heritage was already beyond unfair. Everyone had subconsciously agreed that Tang Ge was the first place of the Fishing Trial. Who else was more qualified than him?Fang Ze was as indifferent as before. He waved his hand, and a white luxurious boat emerged out of nowhere. It was a major contrast to the other boats.Fang Ze said, \u201cDon\u2019t care too much about the Fishing Trial. The first place is already yours anyway. You will probably say goodbye to this place after the awakening.\u201dTang Ge searched the crowd and saw Han Fei waving at him. He grinned and waved back.Fang Ze squinted. He saw through Han Fei\u2019s strength easily. A level-seven fisher was something here, but it was not worth mentioning in the city. Most children in the city were already fishing masters at such an age. However, since Han Fei was Tang Ge\u2019s brother, he thought that it might not be a bad idea to show him some kindness.The village leader came to Fang Ze and asked respectfully, \u201cMaster, when do you think we should start?\u201dFang Ze said, \u201cHasn\u2019t it been scheduled? Just do it accordingly.\u201dFang Ze glanced at the crowd and said casually, \u201cThe top three places in this trial will be given Spirit Concentration Art. Everybody, keep it up!\u201d\u201cHua!\u201dEverybody clamored. They did not know what Spirit Concentration Art was, but it was an award from the angel! It must be good stuff!Many people beamed with interest after Fang Ze said that.Wang Baiyu was excited. The Wang family had been famous for their Armorists. If he obtained Spirit Concentration Art, it was possible that he could become an influential person even in the town.Li Hu thought hard. The Tigers had been dwarfed by the Wang family exactly because they did not have a top expert. If he got Spirit Concentration Art, it was possible that he could become a Spirit Concentrator. He wouldn\u2019t need to fear the Wang family at all then.Han Fei felt nothing, but he did remember the awesome Armorist from the Wang family he saw in the market the other day. Since he was now much stronger, he certainly could join the competition for Spirit Concentrator.The village leader was delighted. If a Spirit Concentrator emerged in the village, it was possible that Heavenly Water Village would rise to higher places.He shouted with a red face, \u201cAttention, everyone! The trial now begins!\u201dUnder the villager leader\u2019s command, the boats dispersed and chose their own destination of fishing. Some people were so eager that they cast the hook without moving the boat at all.Since it was a trial, everybody had their own boat, and it depended on their capabilities what their score would be.Han Fei was not in a hurry. He drove his boat to Tang Ge.Tang Ge, on the other hand, also drove his boat to Han Fei.Tang Ge laughed, \u201cHan Fei, did you make another breakthrough?\u201dHan Fei grinned and said, \u201cYes, I\u2019m making progress fast. The Fishing Trial is not a problem at all.\u201dTang Ge said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. That\u2019s good. About the things I left for you\u2026\u201dHan Fei said solemnly, \u201cDo not practice the Mystic Body Technique. I sensed great flaws in it.\u201dTang Ge was stunned. \u201cHuh?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cDon\u2019t ask me how I knew it. Just leave the technique alone.\u201dTang Ge said, \u201cI didn\u2019t practice it. What about you?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cMe either. Let\u2019s meet after the Fishing Trial. I need to tell you something.\u201dTang Ge said, \u201cAlright! Let\u2019s choose a place and start fishing!\u201dFang Ze appeared and looked at Han Fei casually. Then, he said to Tang Ge, \u201cDon\u2019t go together. If you go with him, with your strength and the noises you make while fishing, he might not catch any fish at all.\u201dTang Ge looked at Han Fei in embarrassment.Han Fei said, \u201cYou go first! Your destination is the sea of stars. Keep it up!\u201dFang Ze was stunned. He thought that Han Fei would beg Tang Ge to help him, but Han Fei did not ask for anything. The sea of stars, on the other hand, was not a bad expression.Tang Ge hesitated, \u201cWhat about you?\u201dHan Fei smiled, \u201cRest assured. I\u2019ll catch up to you soon. My journey lies in the infinite ocean.\u201dHan Fei left on his boat quickly.Fang Ze shook his head. That was a rather confident kid. Infinite ocean? Do you know where infinite ocean is? It\u2019s true that the ignorant are fearless. However, with the boy\u2019s talent, it\u2019s possible that he can grow into a grand fishing master later.\u2026Han Fei was not in a hurry to start fishing. He knew that there were too many resources in the ocean. He did not want to be too close to other people in case they noticed his terrifying fishing abilities.Han Fei drove five hundred kilometers away and did not stop until only few boats were around. He took out the fishing pole and put the bait on unhurriedly.The points of the fish were calculated according to their level, so Han Fei\u2019s target was never the fish with fewer than five points.For example, little white fish were one point, yellow fish were three points, green turtles were five points, blade fish were seven points, tentacle lobsters were eight points, and Snakebelts were nine points.Some of the fish were special. One meat tortoise was worth twenty points, the rare spirit-swallowing jellyfish was thirty points, and the young iron-head fish was twelve points.Other than the regular fish, it was said that the fishing masters had driven certain unaggressive fish from the level-one fishery. However, few people were expected to catch them. It was only meant to increase the difficulty of the trial.Han Fei\u2019s lips curled as he sank his hook five meters deep. To make it to the top three, he\u2019d better start from the deeper water!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: CheatingDeeper than five meters was the domain of blade fish and green turtles. There were even Snakebelts if he went even deeper. However, Snakebelts liked warmth and had no interest in the bait. It was barely possible to catch them.Not bothering the cost, Han Fei transmitted his spiritual energy to the fishing line and the hook, getting full control of the responses near the hook.Han Fei\u2019s face suddenly changed. He shook the pole and retreated it quickly. There was a blade fish at the end of it. He drew the purple bamboo rod and slashed at the blade fish.\u201cDing*\u2026*\u201dThe lousy fin knife of the fish stabbed into the boat, and the head of the fish was broken. Han Fei kicked it into the fish cabin casually.He had earned seven points.Han Fei saw the inspectors four times in the next two hours. He pretended to work hard every time they came and were relaxed after they left.During the two hours, Han Fei caught thirteen blade fish and eight green turtles, which were 131 points in total.Then, he heard a voice from the sky.The village leader announced, \u201cThe first place of this Fishing Trial has 241 points, and the tenth has 142 points. Please keep it up.\u201dHan Fei was stunned. Are you kidding me? I\u2019m already fishing very fast, and I have only 131 points. Why do those people have so many points?At the same time, in somewhere far away, Wang Baiyu bellowed,and a long hook appeared from a box next to him and darted into the water, stabbing into a blade fish.The knife of the blade fish glittered, but Wang Baiyu did not bother to look at it. He simply shouted, \u201cShield!\u201dA shield made of a turtle shell appeared out of nowhere and knocked the lousy fin knife away.On the other side, Li Hu was rather gloomy. \u201cWho has obtained 242 points? Tang Ge? I wonder how many points Wang Baiyu has. Probably close to two hundred, right?\u201dSneering, Li Hu shouted, \u201cHuya, kill it!\u201dA hideous fish almost three meters long broke out of the water and spewed a young iron-head fish out to the boat.It was Li Hu\u2019s secret that he had been keeping. Everybody knew that his father had a tiger-head fish, but they did not know that he had one, too.On Tang Ge\u2019s side, he had seen a myriad of strange fish in the advanced fisheries, and Fang Ze had taught him the most practical tricks in fishing and attracting fish.Tang Ge\u2019s hands were moving sophisticatedly as if he were casting a strange skill. As Tang Ge took action, a pillar of spiritual energy fell on the ocean, and fish jumped up, allowing Tang Ge to catch them easily.If Wang Baiyu, Li Hu or a teacher were here, they would be stunned because it was exactly Spirit Concentration Art. Fishing with such an art in a general fishery was like children playing with toys.Apart from those Heavenly Talents, it was not so smooth for other people.A student from the southern campus had only acquired forty points. It was not a bad result, but he was so earnest that he sank the hook more than six meters deep. Then, an enormous blade cut his head off so fast that even the inspectors had no time to react.Six students of the northern campus were in a group. They were smart enough to throw tremendous baits into the ocean, hoping to attract the fish. However, three tentacle lobsters came to them. Only three of them survived.A girl from the eastern campus, who scolded Han Fei before, unfortunately caught a ball fish. Even the teachers did not see it coming. As a result, the girl\u2019s body was riddled with holes by the needles on the fish.The same thing was going on in many other places. There was no time for the inspectors to take action. After all, the students were not fishing at one location.The odds of disability were even higher. To acquire more points, most students chose blade fish, but half of them couldn\u2019t avoid the knife from the fish because it was too fast. At least thirty percent of them were crippled even though they had weapons.Another two hours passed.Han Fei was even more efficient than before. He had killed a tentacle lobster and caught seventeen blade fish and six green turtles. His total score was 289 points.Han Fei swallowed. Was he in the top ten places now? Nobody could\u2019ve caught so many fish without enough spiritual energy. He was certain that the fishers below level seven had to take Spirit Refilling Pills or rest for recovery now.The village leader\u2019s announcement came again.\u201cThe first place of the Fishing Trial has 482 points, and the tenth place has 298 points. Keep it up!\u201dHan Fei was shocked. Are those people really students? By logic, they should be out of spiritual energy!It never occurred to Han Fei that the top places were all the Heavenly Talents in the village who had Spirit Refilling Pills as well as their own tricks.He Xiaoyu, for example, was not anxious at all. She had already obtained 212 points. Her father had given her three Spirit Refilling Pills before she came. He did not know that Han Fei also gave He Xiaoyu three Spirit Refilling Pills for the notes on Spiritual Energy Explosion.\u2026Han Fei\u2019s face darkened. \u201cFine, you\u2019re forcing me to do this. Do you have to compete with me for Spirit Concentration Art and the privilege of spirit awakening? Come on, let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got!\u201dMaking up his mind, Han Fei activated Void Fishing. His hand was on fire in the blink of an eye. Thankfully, he had a bucket of water next to him. He immediately extended his hand into it.Fang Ze\u2019s eyes would\u2019ve popped up if he had seen this. How could anyone attract spiritual energy into their body in the middle of the day? Was he not scared that he would explode?In the next moment, spiritual energy gathered in this place, and Han Fei saw a shoal of fish coming.He immediately cast the hook. Something bit the bait instantly, but it was not a blade fish but a green turtle. Han Fei did not despise it. Ignoring the spluttering stones, he hit the green turtle and knocked it out.When spiritual energy gathered in Han Fei\u2019s place, Fang Ze frowned, \u201cHuh? Why did I sense the solar energy just now? Was it my illusion?\u201dTwo inspectors nearby also sensed the anomaly. They came in a hurry.They were both shocked to see Han Fei leaping and twisting the head of a tentacle lobster.Then, two seconds after Han Fei cast the hook again, a cold knife was shot out, only to be blocked by him casually. The inspectors counted thirty knives on Han Fei\u2019s boat!\u201cHiss\u2026\u201dOne of the inspectors got on board and glanced at him. \u201cYou\u2019re from the eastern campus\u2026 Huh, you\u2019ve caught nothing but blade fish, green turtles and tentacle lobsters?\u201dThe other inspector had been here to calculate the score just now. He shook his head and said to the first inspector, \u201cLet\u2019s go! He\u2019s Han Fei, Tang Ge\u2019s brother.\u201dThe first inspect immediately understood it. It was true that a genius\u2019s brother tended to be another genius!Ignoring the two teachers, Han Fei paused for a moment.\u201cIt seems inappropriate to leave the knives all over the boat, which would expose my abilities. Fine! I\u2019d better clear them!\u201dFar away, Li Hu observed in a stun and said to the tiger-head fish, \u201cHuh? Are fish gathering over there?\u201dThe tiger-head fish squeaked, as if it could understand him.Li Hu said, \u201cSomeone\u2019s over there? So what? Let\u2019s go and rob him.\u201dOn the other hand, Wang Baiyu sensed something when he was about to launch his harpoon. His armor had just moved. He couldn\u2019t help but look far away. What was over there?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: I\u2019m RobbedThat\u2019s why cheating feels great. Han Fei couldn\u2019t be more delighted. He had collected ten blade fish within a quarter. Even Tang Ge\u2019s score couldn\u2019t be much higher than his.It was a pity that his experiment was too short just now. Most of the fish had dispersed. He probably had to cheat again soon.When Han Fei was about to cast the hook, he saw a boat coming over quickly.\u201cHuh? Who\u2019s coming? Why is he coming to my place instead of fishing? How can I cheat if he is watching me?\u201dHan Fei stopped his action and looked at the boat gloomily.When the boat was near, Han Fei recognized the young man on the boat to be the young master of the Tigers. Was it possible that his father asked him to offer some points to Han Fei as compensation?Han Fei did not stop Li Hu from approaching. He said with a smile, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll forgive you for what you did. Don\u2019t give me more than two hundred points, or I will be too eye-catching.\u201dLi Hu: \u201c???\u201dLi Hu saw blade fish swimming below the boat and plenty more in Han Fei\u2019s unclosed fish cabin. He immediately squinted.He said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you an opportunity. Offer your fish to me, and I will allow you to follow me.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Han Fei was confused, \u201cWait, you\u2019re asking me to offer my fish to you?\u201dLi Hu said, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get to follow you unless I offer my fish to you?\u201dLi Hu replied impatiently, \u201cNo.\u201dHan Fei was lost for words. Was the guy out of his mind? He was going to rob Han Fei when his father failed to?Han Fei asked, \u201cWas your head hit by an iron-head fish when you were little?\u201dLi Hu was dazed at first, but he soon realized what he meant. He sniffed, \u201cYou\u2019re quite bold.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cGet lost. I\u2019ll blow your head if you are still here after I count to three!\u201dLi Hu\u2019s face was full of brutality. He did not expect to be refused.Li Hu said coldly, \u201cDo you know why the casualty rate of every Fishing Trial can be fifty percent?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less. Get your ass out of here.\u201dLi Hu roared, \u201cYou\u2019re asking to be killed!\u201dLi Hu drew two sabers and slashed Han Fei. He was so angry about Han Fei\u2019s attitude that he had to kill the guy today.Han Fei blocked the attack with the purple bamboo rod. He did not expect Li Hu to attack. Was the man crazy?However, the sabers were slashed again heavily. Han Fei discovered in a stun that the guy was a level-eight fisher. But it couldn\u2019t change the inevitable.\u201cYou\u2019re asking for this.\u201dSpiritual energy surged out of Han Fei\u2019s body as he bashed the sabers with the purple bamboo rod.Li Hu did not know that Han Fei was so strong. After only one collision, he felt that his arms were numb and his hands were cracking.Han Fei cursed, \u201cWho gives you the courage to hold two sabers when other people all use rods? You think you are capable?\u201dThe purple bamboo rod swept as Han Fei shouted. Scared, Li Hu jumped back. However, to his surprise, there was a cold edge when the rod swept at him. While he wondered why a rod had an edge, his clothes were shredded at his abdomen, revealing the armor down below.\u201cHuh? You have more clothes down below? No wonder you looked weird just now. But I\u2019m still going to blow up your head!\u201dLi Hu said, \u201cVery good. You have pissed me off. Tiger-head\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you invite me to this spectacular event?\u201dWhen Han Fei was about to attack again, someone called a hundred meters away.Han Fei and Li Hu looked back. It was none other than Wang Baiyu, the third young master of the Wang family.Wang Baiyu was also quite surprised. After identifying Li Hu and Han Fei, he couldn\u2019t believe that Han Fei could fight Li Hu neck-and-neck. The guy was quite extraordinary!Coldly, Li Hu retreated his sabers and jumped back to his boat, before he left in a hurry.Standing at the head of his boat, Li Hu declared, \u201cBoy, whoever you are, pray to the Sea God, or you will die a miserable death!\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cIdiot, I\u2019ll send you to the Sea God if you dare to come again.\u201dWang Baiyu was stunned. Why did he not know such a brutal man who dared to challenge Li Hu before?He said, \u201cHan Fei? What a coincidence. Why did you fight against Li Hu?\u201dHan Fei still owed Wang Baiyu a favor. He shrugged and said, \u201cThat idiot came and asked me to offer my fish to him. What a great fool.\u201dWang Baiyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dWang Baiyu asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dWang Baiyu said, \u201cThe casualty rate! Why do you think the casualty rate of the Fishing Trial is so high?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it because of the risks in fishing?\u201dWang Baiyu looked at Han Fei in amusement and said, \u201cHow is it possible? Even though there are risks, how can the casualty rate be as high as fifty percent? The real trial won\u2019t start until the last four hours.\u201dHan Fei was surprised. \u201cHuh? Why is that?\u201dWang Baiyu said with a smile, \u201cIn fact, only less than ten percent are killed or injured in fishing. Most of the casualties are due to competitions amongst the trial-takers.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cHuh? Can trial-takers kill each other?\u201dWang Baiyu said, \u201cIt\u2019s only allowed in the Fishing Trial. In the first eight hours, everybody is too busy fishing to ask for trouble. In the first four hours, only the result of the first place and the tenth place will be announced. Starting from the fifth hour, the result of the hundredth place will be announced. In the seventh hour, the result of the 1000th place will be released. Then, those whose score is not high enough will start fighting and looting.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cWhy did I not know that? Why do the school and the parents agree with such a rule?\u201dWang Baiyu explained, \u201cIt\u2019s because we are cultivators. The ocean can be cruel. You think dangers only lurk in the water? No, your companions or other people who are planning to rob you can be as dangerous. It\u2019s unusual in the general fishery because few things are worth fighting over.\u201dTaking a deep breath, Han Fei said, \u201cTherefore, if I\u2019m strong enough, I need only to rob instead of fishing?\u201dWang Baiyu said, \u201cTheoretically, yes.\u201d\u201cPa\u2026\u201d\u201cHey! I shouldn\u2019t have done that\u2026\u201dWang Baiyu asked, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let Li Hu go. I could\u2019ve robbed him of all his points!\u201dWang Baiyu: \u201c???\u201dThen, Han Fei glimpsed at Wang Baiyu\u2019s cabin which seemed full. The man must have plenty of points.Wang Baiyu said: \u201c\u2026Brother Han.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cRight! It\u2019s alright. I\u2019m just looking at it. Right, what brought you here, Brother Wang?\u201dWang Baiyu smiled and said, \u201cI was curious about the spiritual waves in this place and happened to see Brother Han and Li Hu fighting.\u201dWang Baiyu observed Han Fei again. He knew Li Hu\u2019s reliance very well. With his tiger-head fish and his strength as a level-eight fisherman, he was rather tricky even for Wang Baiyu. Han Fei was bold enough to fight him.Han Fei was thinking about something else. Even fishers could sense the spiritual waves? Did it mean that he could not cheat? What could he do if he could not cheat? Robbing? That was not a bad idea. It would be simple and effective.Thinking about that, Han Fei said, \u201cSpiritual waves? I don\u2019t know anything about that. It\u2019s probably because I encountered a shoal of fish. But most of the fish have already dispersed. I don\u2019t know where they are now. They may be still around\u2026 Okay, enough talking. I\u2019ve got some robbing to do.\u201dWang Baiyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Brutal TrialAfter bidding farewell to Wang Baiyu, Han Fei did not start robbing immediately but moved dozens of kilometers away. He dare not cheat again, because Li Hu and the inspectors must\u2019ve been attracted by the waves of spiritual energy he caused.Han Fei was certain that Fang Ze sensed it too although he was too lazy to check it out. Since it almost exposed him, he could not use the method anymore. The best solutions now were fishing and robbing.In the fifth hour, because of the spiritual energy outburst just now, Han Fei\u2019s score soared to 480 points.The village leader announced, \u201cThe first place of the Fishing Trial now has 691 points, and the tenth place has 479 points. Please keep it up.\u201dHan Fei had finally made it to the top ten. He was probably the ninth place.\u201cSince the competition won\u2019t start again until the last four hours, I\u2019d better focus on fishing first!\u201dHan Fei continued fishing. Having no pressure now, he even took out the barbecue that Li Gang prepared for him and enjoyed it.However, Han Fei still underestimated the trial-takers. In the latter half of the fifth hour, two boats went straight at him.When the boats approached, a young man smiled, \u201cBro, bring them out!\u201dAnother young man on the other boat declared, \u201cYou\u2019d better submit your points if you want your life, or we\u2019ll feed you to the fish.\u201dHolding a roasted lobster, Han Fei said to them in a stun, \u201cYou are good. You\u2019ve struck an alliance?\u201dOne of the young man frowned. Han Fei seemed rather confident. Was he a tricky person? But why was he fishing alone in this remote place if he was strong? Should he rob other people straightly?The young man asked tentatively, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you join our alliance? We\u2019ll share the trophies later.\u201dThe other young man objected, \u201cWhy? We should seek allies from our own campus! We\u2019ve never seen this guy before.\u201dHan Fei smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s right! You don\u2019t need to ally with me, because\u2026 you are already eliminated!\u201dThen, Han Fei jumped and slashed a young man.\u201cYou shameless scoundrel\u2026\u201d\u201cClang*\u2026*\u201dThe young man vomited blood and was flung away, unable to stand up again.He was frightened. Whom did I just piss off? I\u2019m a fisher at the peak of level six, but the rob just now as unstoppable as an adult iron-head fish!The other young man was trying to help, but his ally had been knocked out before he took any action. He was stunned. His ally had fallen after one attack when he was stronger than himself?Han Fei pointed the purple bamboo rod at the young man and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll transfer the fish in your cabin to mine if you are smart. I won\u2019t hurt you. It\u2019s possible that you can still rob other people.\u201dThe young man sweated. What\u2019s going on? The very first person that they robbed turned out to be a great monster. Why were they so unlucky?\u201cI\u2026 I will.\u201dThe young man was almost crying. Why did they drive the boats so close? There was no chance to escape at all!Han Fei stopped fishing. He asked the young man, \u201cWhich campus are you from? What\u2019s your name?\u201dThe young man said, \u201c\u2026The northern campus. Song Jun.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cHas robbing started out there?\u201dSong Jun said, \u201cY-Yes. People started attacking one another just now.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cHey, toss the little white to me. Do not throw them into the fish cabin.\u201dSong Jun tossed the little white fish to Han Fei in fear. Han Fei touched them and threw them into the ocean casually.Song Jun was shocked. Little white fish are points, too. Why are you abandoning them?When Song Jun picked up a yellow fish, Han Fei said, \u201cHey, give the yellow fish to me, too.\u201dSong Jun: \u201c???\u201dThen, Song Jun watched the yellow fish to be thrown into the ocean. He couldn\u2019t be more regretful. What\u2019s the meaning of this? Every yellow fish is three points!Han Fei murmured, \u201cYou are too big for your points. I can\u2019t let you fill my cabin.\u201dSong Jun: \u201c\u2026\u201dSoon, the fish cabins of Song Jun and the other young man were cleaned. They had ten blade fish and 24 green turtles in total.Frowning, Han Fei said, \u201cWhy are there so few blade fish? Why did you catch so many green turtles? They\u2019re filling my cabin. Fine, you can go on. I\u2019ll leave.\u201dSong Jun couldn\u2019t be happier to see him off. What a peculiar man. He even despised green turtles that equaled five points each.Han Fei casually drove to where people were crowded with one foot on the head of the boat. He felt that he needed a cigarette, a hat and an eye patch.\u201cThis feels good. No wonder the Somalia pirates like robbing. It\u2019s fantastic.\u201dThe ground for the Fishing Trial was not very large, but it was still rather spacious for the thousands of boats. At this moment, some of the boats were already teaming up, and the lone boats were obviously the best targets of robbing.The inspectors withdrew from the ground.The village leader sighed, \u201cThe annual killing starts again! I hope that they go easy on each other this time.\u201dFang Ze, on the other hand, was not bother. Seated in Tang Ge\u2019s boat, he said lazily, \u201cThis is a lesson about robbery. The worlds up above are much crueler than here. It\u2019s all up to you whether you become a hunter or prey. Look at those young men. What they caught after all the hard work goes to other people in the blink of an eye because they are weak. As for the alliances, you\u2019d better leave them alone, because those alliances will eventually fall out. All that matters is your own strength.\u201dTang Ge was rather solemnly. He knew that it would happen, but he had never experienced it in person. Just now, the student on a boat not far away was slain ruthlessly and thrown into the ocean.Cultivation was a road of thorns. He couldn\u2019t save everybody. But where was Han Fei? He needed to find him.Fang Ze did not stop him. He only said casually, \u201cAlright, go now. You have to learn the important lesson.\u201dThen, Fang Ze disappeared, leaving Tang Ge alone on the ocean. There was not a second boat within thousands of meters.\u2026At the periphery, Han Fei was surrounded again, because he was all alone.Han Fei shouted in fear, \u201cHey, who are you?\u201dEverybody laughed at Han Fei\u2019s cowardliness. One of the girls demanded, \u201cOffer your fish to us, and we\u2019ll spare you, or you can prepare to die!\u201dHan Fei said timidly, \u201cYou have four boats. Who am I giving the fish to? Why don\u2019t you come to take them?\u201dThey looked at each other and thought it did make sense. The down side of alliance was that they had to share everything evenly in every robbery.So, they stepped on Han Fei\u2019s boat. The moment they got on board, Han Fei grabbed his purple bamboo rod.The girl changed his face. \u201cYou\u2019re asking to be killed?\u201d\u201cHey, I always thought that girls are different from boys, but you seem to be the same! You think you are strong because you are in a team? Who gives you the courage?\u201dA guy shouted in fear, \u201cNot good! His cabin is full of blade fish!\u201dAll of them changed their faces. A cabin of blade fish meant that the man was extremely tough. He was definitely a Heavenly Talent since he was not hurt by the knives.The girl roared, \u201cFight!\u201dThe moment she roared, a rod fell from the sky, and the girl blocked it subconsciously. After a clang, her weapon was bent, and she fell on her knees under the brunt.The other three guys attacked, but the purple bamboo rod swept at them and knocked two of them away easily. One of them fell into the ocean, and the other was blown back to his own boat.Han Fei frowned. He did not expect the guy to be so weak. He reached the edge of the boat and planned to rescue him, but the guy was nowhere to be seen.The last guy ran back to his boat, frightened. However, before he operated the boat, Han Fei had boarded on his boat.Han Fei said, \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of killing. Move your blade fish and green turtles to my fish cabin, and you will be free to get out of here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: Hunted He XiaoyuHan Fei continued wandering on his own in delight. He had finished three groups in the same way. Five of the eight cabins on the boat had been full.One of the inspects calculated the number in the meantime. He was stunned when the result was out. A thousand and twelve points? Someone\u2019s score had surpassed a thousand points after only two hours?In the fifth hour\u2019s announcement, Tang Ge, who was the first place, had only 691 points. This person was obviously not Tang Ge, but he had more than a thousand points. If he could maintain his result, he would be among the top thousand without doing anything!A moment later, the village leader announced again, \u201cThere are four hours to go until the end of the Fishing Trial. As of now, the first place has 1,431 points, the tenth place has 966 points, the hundredth place has 552 points, and the thousandth has 241 points. Please keep it up.\u201dEverybody grew anxious after the announcement. The scores were increasing faster and faster. The top ten places already had more than a thousand points.At this moment, people who had teamed up looked for their target, and those who didn\u2019t were either searching for allies or running to the edge of the trial ground.Some even activated the signal device on the boat and forfeited the trial when they saw other boats coming at them. Actually, there were plenty of such people. They simply fished in a corner and ended the trial the moment other people attacked them.According to what happened in the previous years, some of them could always make it to the top thousand.Different from them, Han Fei wandered on his own with his inexhaustible spiritual energy and his high level.Other people were different.Wang Baiyu and Li Hu, for example, did not take any action, when many boats came and offered all their trophies to them.The Wang family had more connections than the Tigers, so Wang Baiyu could roam about while enjoying the view.Li Hu was different. While some boats offered points to him, they were mostly from the children of the members of the Tigers. He knew that he had to rob more people.Han Fei waited for other people to rob him, but Li Hu robbed the groups provocatively. Not just robbing, Li Hu was also fond of killing. Few people who encountered Li Hu survived.He Xiaoyu was rather anxious. Although she had a breakthrough before, there were too many enemies! Three boats just robbed her, but they underestimated He Xiaoyu and were defeated by her. Still, she ran out of her spiritual energy and had to take a Spirit Refilling Pill. She only had one Spirit Refilling Pill left.At this moment, four boats surrounded her. He Xiaoyu was almost desperate. She just looted some points, but could she survive this one? The last Spirit Refilling Pill cannot be used in a fight.He Xiaoyu was prepared to fight. She had two plans: to beat the four people, loot their points, and admit failure after using up the last Spirit Refilling Pill; or to run out right now. Hopefully, other people couldn\u2019t catch up with her.Right when the few boats were about to surround He Xiaoyu, a scary fish jumped out of the water, followed by a boat that was sailing at the highest speed.It approached one of the boats quickly. Li Hu boarded on it and slashed his sabers. The young man on the boat tried to fight back, but his body was already stabbed through. As Li Hu drew his blades, blood gushed out of the young man.He Xiaoyu was dumbfounded by the brutal slaughter. Her face turned pale.Someone shouted on the other boat, \u201cRun! It\u2019s Li Hu from the Tigers! Run!\u201dBefore he finished, a ferocious tiger-head fish had appeared behind him. He turned around as everybody exclaimed, only to see nothing but darkness, because his head had been bitten off.\u201cAhhhh\u2026\u201dHe Xiaoyu screamed, terrified by the headless body where blood was springing.Frowning, Li Hu yelled, \u201cShut up.\u201dHe Xiaoyu grabbed the bamboo rod and was ready to run. She would\u2019ve had a chance of escape if she did not pick up the bamboo rod, because there were still two other boats, but Li Hu saw the bamboo rod and knew that it was not something that everyone could afford. He shouted, \u201cTiger head, kill her!\u201dHe Xiaoyu was already controlling the boat to run, but it was not nearly as fast as the tiger-head fish, which jumped and went at He Xiaoyu\u2019s face.He Xiaoyu waved the bamboo rod, and spiritual energy gathered on it.Li Hu roared, \u201cTiger head, come back\u2026\u201dBut it was too late. An explosion burst out. He Xiaoyu was bumped into the deck and vomited blood. Of course, the tiger-head fish seemed to be hurt, too.She dare not stop and fled on the boat in a hurry. Li Hu had already turned into a murderer.\u201cYou think you can get away after hurting tiger head?\u201dLi Hu abandoned the two survivors and chased He Xiaoyu.The two survives heaved a long sigh of relief, but before they were reassured, they were already surrounded by a couple of boats.One of them shouted desperately, \u201cNot good! They\u2019re from the Tigers!\u201d\u2026He Xiaoyu ran fast. Fortunately, she did not fight the four invaders just now, or she couldn\u2019t have survived after her spiritual energy was used up.The two boats were only several hundred meters away from each other. He Xiaoyu shouted while running, \u201cLi Hu, do you know that He Mingtang is my father?\u201dLi Hu roared, \u201cLi Jue is my father! What can your father do even if I kill you?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cYou are a lunatic! I\u2019ll withdraw from the trial if you chase on!\u201dLi Hu said, \u201cIt will be too late by the time the inspectors come for you.\u201dHe Xiaoyu was rather angry. Did I wrong you? Why are you pursuing me? Why is someone chasing me when I\u2019m already level seven?Several minutes later, He Xiaoyu\u2019s eyes glittered as she saw an expert from her campus.\u201cQin Yi, help me!\u201dThe guy named Qin Yi was only at the peak of level six. He ran immediately after he saw that Li Hu was chasing He Xiaoyu. He dare not pissing off the Tigers.He Xiaoyu shouted, \u201cJerk!\u201dHe Xiaoyu cried for help whenever she met someone else, but everyone avoided her as if she were a plague.He Xiaoyu ran out of her spiritual energy. She swallowed the last Spirit Refilling Pill without any hesitation.At this moment, she saw Hu Kun who was robbing other people. She shouted, \u201cHu Kun, help me!\u201dHu Kun reached level seven yesterday, so he was bold enough to rob two boats on his own. He was rather surprised to see He Xiaoyu being hunted.\u201cShoot. Li Hu?\u201dHu Kun changed hi face and gave up the rest of the points. He sailed his boat off quickly.He Xiaoyu was almost weeping. Who are these people? Is Li Hu really so terrifying?\u2026Han Fei was enjoying the sunlight. Six of the eight cabins were already full. He only wished that he had more cabins!However, he was not anxious. When his boat was full, he could rob other people of their boats!He found it a loss that he couldn\u2019t absorb the fish and planned to make barbecue with them later. The blade fish couldn\u2019t taste too bad.\u201cSwoosh*\u2026*\u201dHan Fei shouted, \u201cHey, bro, don\u2019t run! Let\u2019s team up!\u201dIt was the third boat that had slipped past Han Fei. He was rather speechless. Why were those people sailing so fast?Suddenly, he saw two boats coming to him quickly. He was immediately refreshed. Were they new clients? Should he pretend?Han Fei immediately pretended that he was wounded and accelerated the boat, as if he were also running.They were close.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t it He Xiaoyu? Is she trying to rob me, too?\u201dWhen He Xiaoyu was several hundred meters away from Han Fei, she raised her hands and screamed, \u201cRun, Han Fei, run!\u201dHan Fei: \u201c???\u201dHe Xiaoyu was lost for words. Other people are all running, and yet you\u2019re on exactly on our way. While Han Fei is strong, that\u2019s Li Hu!When the two boats were close to each other, He Xiaoyu shouted, \u201cHan Fei, run! Li Hu is here!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: Integration of Man and FishConfidence came from capabilities. Han Fei was not anxious at all. He was amused to see Li Hu.Han Fei shouted, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, stop! Don\u2019t panic! We\u2019ll team up and finish him!\u201dHe Xiaoyu was almost in tears. Who are you going to finish?He Xiaoyu said, \u201cWe can\u2019t defeat him. He has a tiger-head fish as a spiritual pet. He\u2019s too strong!\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cHuh? What\u2019s a spiritual pet?\u201dLi Hu was also surprised, not because he met Han Fei again but because he heard Han Fei\u2019s name. He seemed to be in trouble. The guy was Han Fei?He Xiaoyu was ready to run any moment, but Han Fei shouted at Li Hu cockily from his boat, \u201cThief, offer your boat to me right now, or I\u2019ll show you no mercy.\u201dGloomily, Li Hu said, \u201cHan Fei, there\u2019s no grudge between us. Since she\u2019s under your protection, I\u2019ll let go of her.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThat\u2019s bulls*it. You think you have a choice? Now, give you points to me, or I\u2019ll let you know the color of your blood!\u201dHe Xiaoyu was startled. Why was Han Fei so confident? And why did Li Hu seem to be scared of him?Li Hu said, \u201cHan Fei, don\u2019t push too far. Tang Ge won\u2019t stay in Heavenly Water Village forever.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business. He certainly can protect me now. This is your last chance. If you don\u2019t want the Tigers to be obliterated, surrender your points now.\u201dHe Xiaoyu finally understood that Han Fei was counting on Tang Ge. She was immediately reassured. That\u2019s right! Do you really dare to attack Han Fei?Li Hu looked awful. He couldn\u2019t afford pissing off Tang Ge, which meant that he couldn\u2019t attack Han Fei. However, he secretly made a gesture to the ocean behind him and said, \u201cHan Fei, how about I give you half of my points?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cDid you not hear what I said? All of your points are mine. You will keep none.\u201dHolding back his fury, Li Hu said, \u201cThere are plenty of fish on my boat. Why don\u2019t we move them together?\u201dHan Fei laughed. \u201cIs there something wrong with your head? I\u2019m robbing you, and you want me to do the hard work? You will throw the fish into my cabin. I have all the time in the world.\u201dHe Xiaoyu jumped to Han Fei\u2019s boat and whispered to Han Fei, \u201cBe careful. He just killed several people.\u201dHan Fei changed his face. He never thought to kill anyone yet. They were all children anyway. He did not expect that Li Hu was truly killing other people.Li Hu thought to himself, You may be Han Fei, so what? Nobody is around. If I kill him and He Xiaoyu here, who will know that it was me who did it?Containing himself, Li Hu transmitted the points to Han Fei\u2019s fish cabin.Han Fei urged him now and then: \u201cWhy are you so slow? Did you not have lunch?\u201dHe Xiaoyu looked at Han Fei, lost for words. The guy was no longer the taciturn person he used to be after he fell into the ocean.He Xiaoyu asked, \u201cHan Fei, how many points do you have?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI don\u2019t know! There are too many to count. I\u2019m waiting for the inspectors to do the job.\u201dRight then, Li Hu suddenly interjected, \u201cHan Fei, your fish cabins are all full.\u201dHan Fei replied without thinking, \u201cAre they? He Xiaoyu, do you have empty cabins?\u201dHe Xiaoyu\u2019s mouth opened wide. Didn\u2019t they say that only the top ten had full fish cabins?\u201cYes, I have four empty cabins.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThe fish that I store in your place can be counted as my points, right?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cProbably\u2026\u201dThen, Han Fei pointed at Li Hu and said, \u201cYou will move the rest to her cabins. Be quick about it. I have more robbing to do.\u201dLi Hu stuffed fish into He Xiaoyu\u2019s cabin without saying anything, but he was secretly shocked. This guy\u2019s cabins were full of blade fish. How could he have managed that?He Xiaoyu asked tentatively, \u201cHow many points did you have last hour?\u201dHan Fei thought for a moment and said, \u201cI can\u2019t remember it now. More than a thousand points, I think!\u201dHe Xiaoyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dLi Hu: \u201c\u2026\u201dAt this moment, the village leader announced, \u201cThere are two hours to go before the end of this Fishing Trial. Please keep it up!\u201dHan Fei exclaimed, \u201cWhy did the villager leader not announce the scores?\u201dHe Xiaoyu rolled her eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for an announcement after the thousandth place\u2019s score is released! Things are a mess during the last four hours, it\u2019s difficult to calculate them. Didn\u2019t you notice that the inspectors are gone? They are not allowed to intervene now.\u201dBlinking, Han Fei asked, \u201cAre you serious? Isn\u2019t that an inspector?\u201dHan Fei pointed at a boat that was sailing close. There was an inspector on it. They could easily be distinguished because they were much older than the participants of the trial.Suddenly, Han Fei narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cNot good. We\u2019re surrounded.\u201dHan Fei saw dozens of boats coming at him from all directions.\u201cHahaha! Han Fei, you are dead for sure! You may be Tang Ge\u2019s brother, but so what? He\u2019s not here anyway. I can kill you easily.\u201dShocked, He Xiaoyu said in a hurry, \u201cLet\u2019s run!\u201d\u201cRun!\u201dHan Fei\u2019s casualness was replaced by brutality. Everybody\u2019s boat was the same. How far away could he run?\u201cYou are their leader. I\u2019ll kill you first.\u201dHan Fei\u2019s purple bamboo rod was launched at Li Hu\u2019s face with spiritual energy spurting out.Li Hu sneered. \u201cYou think you\u2019re Tang Ge? I wouldn\u2019t be scared even if you were Tang Ge.\u201dWith spiritual energy surging out of his own rod, Li Hu smashed back at Han Fei ruthlessly.\u201cStop!\u201dThe inspector called from a thousand meters away. It was more proof that something was wrong with the inspector, because it was none of the inspectors\u2019 business.Han Fei turned cold. His capacity of 279 points of spiritual energy was certainly not a joke. The higher the upper limit was, the sturdier one\u2019s body would be.Clang\u2026BAM!While He Xiaoyu watched in shock, Li Hu was blown away into the cabin after the collision.\u201cPu\u2026\u201dLi Hu vomited blood crazily. He felt that his arms had been broken.He was astounded. How could the guy be so strong? As a level-eight fisher, he couldn\u2019t resist one attack from him?Before Li Hu realized what was going on, Han Fei jumped and attacked again. Li Hu was appalled. He would be heavily wounded if he couldn\u2019t avoid the attack.\u201cTiger-head, attach!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHan Fei moved aside, and a hideous fish three meters long dashed into Li Hu\u2019s body.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dLi Hu\u2019s body expanded terrifyingly with even more intense spiritual energy. The shadow of a big fish emerged.He Xiaoyu said, \u201cCareful! After integrating with his pet, his combat ability will be much higher than before.\u201dHan Fei squinted and said, \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll beat him more.\u201d\u201cI told you to stop!\u201dThe inspector was approaching in a hurry, but Han Fei ignored his command and struck again. This time, the end of the purple bamboo rod was glowing as Han Fei had used Spiritual Energy Explosion.Li Hu\u2019s eyes almost popped out. He had to deal with Spiritual Energy Explosion prudently even though he was stronger. He also gathered his spiritual energy and launched Spiritual Energy Explosion.\u201cExplode!\u201dBAM!Two cabins on Li Hu\u2019s boat were blown up by the blast. Li Hu\u2019s face was covered in blood. He could barely hold the rod anymore. He felt that his hands were broken.Han Fei was flung away, but he jumped back and launched another Spiritual Energy Explosion with the purple bamboo rod.Li Hu was shocked. \u201cDon\u2019t kill me\u2026 Don\u2019t\u2026\u201dHan Fei was not an idiot. If he did not take Li Hu down here, he might not have a chance to do so later. But the moment before the purple bamboo rod hit Li Hu, a giant fish charged out of Li Hu\u2019s body.Dum! Bam!The tiger-head fish appeared before Li Hu, and Han Fei\u2019s attack collapsed its head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: Kill the Inspector\u201cIt\u2019s not dead?\u201dHan Fei was shocked. He knew how powerful his attack was. Even a level-nine fisher might not have been able to resist. Yet, the fish was not killed.\u201cYou little bastard, I told you to stop!\u201dHan Fei failed to slay Li Hu in three attacks. As a result, the inspector was only thirty meters away.Han Fei turned cold. He could not look back now.When the inspector\u2019s boat was closer, the inspector jumped over.While the inspector was airborne, Han Fei sprang and launched Spiritual Energy Explosion again.\u201cHow dare you!\u201dOf course, some inspectors were stronger than others. Most of the inspectors who were not teachers in the school were only level-nine fishers.As far as Han Fei could tell, this inspector couldn\u2019t have been a fishing master, or he could have intervened from a hundred meters away. It meant that he was a peak fisher at best. Therefore, he intended to have a try.\u201cExplode!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re crazy\u2026\u201dHe Xiaoyu was forced back by the blast of the attacks.Putong\u2026After the explosion, both of them fell into the ocean.\u201cHan Fei!\u201dHe Xiaoyu\u2019s face was pale, her mind blank. Falling into the ocean was not a joke. They were almost certain to die since no fishing masters were around.The inspector was the most appalled of all. Was the young man trying to die with him? Why had he launched Spiritual Energy Explosion four times?It was a pity that there was no time for him to think. The inspector filled his body with spiritual energy the moment he fell, but he saw a green wind coming at him after stabilized himself.\u201cGudu\u2026\u201dShocked, the inspector was blown dozens of meters deeper and could not hold his breath anymore. Who was this young man? Why was he so strong?It was not the time to think. The inspector hurried to swim upward. He already saw blade fish and Snakebelts. However, Han Fei grinned above him and bared his teeth.It was the first time that Han Fei had used Wandering Dragon Art, but it was still much more useful than what he knew. He was as casual as a fish in the water.Not good.Seeing that Han Fei was swimming toward him quickly, the inspector waved the rod to block him, but he was too slow, and his wrist was cut.The inspector lost his weapon, blood dripping from his wrist. Watching the Snakebelts that were approaching, Han Fei abandoned pursuit and waved his hand at the inspector.On the surface, He Xiaoyu was still observing the water, and dozens of boats were arriving as fast as possible.\u201cHa\u2026 Haha\u2026 Cough, cough\u2026 You can\u2019t get away with this.\u201d\u201cShut up, or I \u2018ll throw you into the ocean.\u201d\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. Even though I\u2019m heavily wounded, you can\u2019t kill me. There\u2019s no way that he can survive in the ocean. Hahaha\u2026\u201dBAM!Right after Li Hu made the remark, Han Fei broke out of the water and landed on the deck.Li Hu was shocked. \u201cHow\u2026 How can you still be alive?\u201dHe Xiaoyu burst into tears of joy. \u201cHan Fei, you\u2019re all right? I was so scared. I thought you were dead\u2026\u201dGrabbing the purple bamboo rod, Han Fei said calmly, \u201cThe inspector happened upon a Snakebelt after he fell into the water. Tsk, tsk. I saw the Snakebelt slithering into his mouth. Well, well\u2026\u201d\u201cEw\u2026\u201dHe Xiaoyu almost threw up after she pictured that.Li Hu\u2019s face was even paler. He pointed at Han Fei, shivering, \u201cYou\u2026 You dared to kill the inspector?\u201dHan Fei asked back, \u201cDid you witness that the inspector was killed by me?\u201dHan Fei watched the ocean for a while, and the inspector did not return. So, he came to Li Hu and said relaxedly, \u201cI would kill you if it weren\u2019t for your points.\u201dHan Fei struck again. The tiger-head fish which was not killed charged at him again.\u201cExplode!\u201dHan Fei had seen it coming. He launched Spiritual Energy Explosion again and blew the tiger-head fish to the deck.BAM! BAM! BAM!Han Fei smashed it so hard with the purple bamboo rod that even the deck collapsed. Finally, the fish was half-dead.Li Hu trembled as he watched. That was a rare fish even in the level-one fishery! But right now, it was dying under Han Fei\u2019s smashes.\u201cTiger-head\u2026\u201dHan Fei was about to smash more, when the tiger-head fish turned into a streak of brightness and condensed into the shape of a fish on Li Hu\u2019s wrist.Han Fei asked He Xiaoyu in astonishment, \u201cThis fish is so sturdy? I thought it was dead.\u201dHe Xiaoyu explained, \u201cThat\u2019s the power of commitment. The tiger-head fish was dying, but it was recalled by Li Hu. However, the partner will be hurt when their contracted beast is hurt.\u201dHan Fei looked at Li Hu. He was indeed vomiting blood.Han Fei was lost for words. Such a big fish could be recalled into the body? Wouldn\u2019t it be the same as my calabash? No wonder Li Jue, the leader of the Tigers, could dominate the level-one fishery. It was almost impossible to die with such a fish!\u201cThief, release our young master!\u201d\u201cHow dare you attack the young master of the Tigers? Are you asking to be killed?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re surrounded. Let go of our young master if you don\u2019t want to die!\u201dLooking at the dozens of boats all around, Han Fei grabbed Li Hu who was half dead and spoke to them, \u201cGive me your points, or I will disable him.\u201d\u201cYou dare to steal the points of the Tigers?\u201d\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dOne of Li Hu\u2019s hands were broken. He screamed miserably.Han Fei asked, \u201cDid I not make myself clear, or are your ears not functioning well?\u201dLi Hu shouted, \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Give it to him!\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cFill that boat, too.\u201dHan Fei pointed at He Xiaoyu\u2019s boat and said to her, \u201cWe\u2019re classmates anyway. I got you covered.\u201dHe Xiaoyu was astonished by Han Fei\u2019s ruthlessness.However, Han Fei was truly tough. He had crushed Li Hu, a level-eight fisher, killed a fake inspector, and robbed a dozen boats simultaneously. Was he the Han Fei she knew?Han Fei demanded two boats that were absolutely filled up.After the dozen of boats were looted, Han Fei finally patted Li Hu\u2019s face and said, \u201cForfeit.\u201dLi Hu changed his face. There was only an hour to go before the end of the trial. Was Han Fei intentionally keeping him away from the awakening ritual?Crack!\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dHan Fei broke Li Hu\u2019s leg and grinned. \u201cDo I need to repeat myself?\u201dLi Hu was most scared. He realized that Han Fei was the opposite of what he was said to be, and that if he declined his terms, he would probably end up in the ocean.Gritting his teeth, Li Hu said, \u201cI\u2019ll forfeit.\u201d\u2026The real inspector was shocked to see Li Hu\u2019s miserable appearance. Was this the brutal and domineering young master of the Tigers he knew?Before he left, Li Hu glared at Han Fei.Han Fei said, \u201cWhat are you looking at? I\u2019ll dig your eyes out if you glare any more. Tell your father that I wasted ten Spirit Refilling Pills because of you. Let him do what he sees fit.\u201dLi Hu fumed, but he held back his fury. He failed to kill Han Fei. If Han Fei asked Tang Ge to deal with the Tigers, he would truly be doomed.After Li Hu was taken away, He Xiaoyu asked, \u2018Why\u2026 Why didn\u2019t you kill him?\u201dHan Fei said lazily, \u201cHis dad probably would go crazy if he died.\u201d\u2026On the other side, Tang Ge ran into Wang Baiyu.Tang Ge said, \u201cGive me your points, and I won\u2019t kill you.\u201dWang Baiyu sweated hard. How could he have run into such a monster when the fishery was so big?He said in a hurry, \u201cTang Ge, I\u2019m Han Fei\u2019s close friend\u2026 Right, he owes me a favor.\u201dTang Ge frowned. \u201cDo tell me. If I find out that you\u2019re lying\u2026\u201dWang Baiyu said, \u201cHan Fei was set up and floated on the ocean for five days. It was me who found him and rescued him.\u201d\u201cSay that again?\u201dTang Ge burst into fury and pointed his long gold rod at Wang Baiyu.Wang Baiyu said, \u201cEverybody in the port knows. I do not know who was behind that, but the port is investigating. I think Han Fei knows what\u2019s going on.\u201dTang Ge put down his rod. \u201cSo to speak, Han Fei does owe you a favor. But if I let you go, he won\u2019t owe you anything anymore.\u201dWang Baiyu said, \u201cOf course.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: Can Me Show Me Some Respect?Everybody went crazy in the last hour.Those who had enough points wanted to have more so that they could have higher places in the awakening ritual. Those who had fewer points hoped to make it to the top hundred. Those whose points had been robbed were planning to get them back.However, there was only an hour to go before the end of the Fishing Trial, and nobody left was weak. Robbery was much more difficult.More importantly, the alliances from the beginning were falling apart. Some were ambushed by their allies, and some declared war openly. They executed the other members in their alliances and swallowed all the points.More and more people were forfeiting the trial, especially those who earned abundant points after the fallout of the alliances.Of course, some of the alliances grew larger and larger under the lead of certain people. Most of them were Heavenly Talents who promised returns to others.Xia Wushuang, from the western campus, was a typical example of such people. His Spiritual Heritage was Level Four, Low Quality, which indicated a promising future. So, many people came to offer points to him.On Han Fei\u2019s side, he and He Xiaoyu occupied four boats full of points. Anyone from the eastern campus would\u2019ve run when they saw Han Fei and He Xiaoyu, but Xia Wushuang was not from there and did not recognize Han Fei.Xia Wushuang knew that Han Fei and He Xiaoyu might be strong, but they couldn\u2019t be stronger than level eight. Since he was a level-eight with a dozen lackeys around him, how could he not rob them?He Xiaoyu was free after she joined up with Han Fei. She felt that it was not a problem for her to make it to the top hundred.Suddenly, she shouted, \u201cA team of boats is coming!\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI saw them. Someone is delivering points to us again!\u201dHe Xiaoyu: \u201c???\u201dHan Fei gave her a Spirit Refilling Pill with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll take care of the lackeys, and I\u2019ll finish the boss.\u201dHe Xiaoyu jumped to her feet. \u201cBut there are a dozen lackeys and only one boss.\u201dHan Fei complained, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, you are a level-seven fisher! Can you handle no pressure at all?\u201dHe Xiaoyu pouted her lips. \u201cEven a dozen level-five fishers could still exhaust a level-seven fisher! Besides, I\u2019m only new to level seven. How can I defeat them?\u201dHan Fei was lost for words. \u201cFine, let\u2019s split them evenly, all right?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cThe boss is yours.\u201d\u201cHe Xiaoyu, let me tell you, you are not going to become an expert if you don\u2019t challenge yourself.\u201dHe Xiaoyu argued, \u201cI don\u2019t have to become an expert! I only need to become a grand fishing master. That\u2019s my father\u2019s goal for me. I\u2019ll be free after I become a grand fishing master.\u201dHan Fei sweated. \u201cHe Xiaoyu, that\u2019s a dangerous thought.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cI don\u2019t care. You are stronger than me anyway. Since you killed an inspector, you are at least as strong as a level-nine fisher.\u201dHe Xiaoyu looked at the sky. Han Fei was only a level-two fisher a month ago, but after a month, he was already capable of fighting a level-nine fisher. Wasn\u2019t he as extraordinary as Tang Ge?Han Fei proposed, \u201cLet\u2019s divide and conquer, shall we?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cHow? They\u2019re definitely coming together! Why don\u2019t we end the trial? I think you are certainly in the top ten now.\u201dHan Fei said, unsatisfied, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I make it to the top three if I\u2019m already a top ten? Only the top three will have rewards.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cSo will the rest of the top ten. According to tradition, they all can choose a battle technique.\u201dHan Fei said in disdain, \u201cAre there any good techniques in our village? I\u2019d better make it to the top three!\u201dHe Xiaoyu was of a mind to smack the guy into the ocean. She was beyond anxious, yet the guy was still bragging.\u2026Xia Wushuang stood at the front of his boat with his hands behind his back and looked over casually.When the boat drew near, he asked Han Fei, \u201cI\u2019m very curious. Why did you not flee?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI don\u2019t have enough hands to sail the boats, or I would\u2019ve run away.\u201dXia Wushuang said, \u201cHave you been robbed?\u201dHan Fei suddenly burst into fury. \u201cCan you show me some respect?\u201dXia Wushuang: \u201c???\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cPut your hands to your front. How can you keep them behind you when you\u2019re talking to someone?\u201dXia Wushuang: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe Xiaoyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe Xiaoyu was almost crying. The enemy is already here. Why are you still bulls*iting instead of fighting?Xia Wushuang said, \u201cGive me your points, and I\u2019ll spare you.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cAre you among the top three?\u201dXia Wushuang: \u201c???\u201dXia Wushuang found it impossible to communicate with this guy. He couldn\u2019t keep up with the guy\u2019s line of thinking at all.Xia Wushuang said patiently, \u201cI\u2019m close.\u201dHan Fei\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cIn that case, give me your points, and I\u2019ll be there.\u201dXia Wushuang: \u201c???\u201dXia Wushuang said gloomily, \u201cYou refuse to offer your points?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI\u2019ll hand it over!\u201dXia Wushuang was secretly relieved. He did not want to fight the guy, because the traces on the boat suggested intense battles. It meant that the guy couldn\u2019t be weak.However, in the next second, Han Fei said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you my ass!\u201dBefore Xia Wushuang realized what was going on, Han Fei leaped. His purple bamboo rod was glittering with spiritual energy.\u201cExplode!\u201dXia Wushuang\u2019s face changed. Spiritual Energy Explosion could only be launched by level-sevens, at the least. Also, why was the spiritual energy even intenser than Xia Wushuang\u2019s own?Xia Wushuang tried to resist it with his rod, but he was too busy feeling good about himself to carry it. Immediately, he stomped and flew back.Behind Xia Wushuang, four level-six fishers fought back with their rods. After a collision, all of them collapsed. One of them even passed out and cramped.Everybody on Xia Wushuang\u2019s side was shocked. They had no idea whom they had pissed off. Before they took action, Han Fei landed on Xia Wushuang\u2019s boat and charged at Xia Wushuang.Xia Wushuang was greatly shocked. He had only just grabbed his rod, but the only thing he could do in midair was lift the weapon and block the attack.Clang\u2026Xia Wushuang smashed the cabin cover and fell into it after vomiting a mouthful of blood.Han Fei said next to the cabin casually, \u201cPoliteness is better than arrogance. Who gave you the courage to keep your hands behind your back when you\u2019re facing an enemy?\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dXia Wushuang roared in the cabin and charged at Han Fei.BAM!He was flung back into the fish cabin as fast as he came.Han Fei said, \u201cWhy are you roaring? You\u2019re launching Spiritual Energy Explosion when your body is not steady yet? Is that what your teacher taught you?\u201dNot far away, the other young men who intended to surround him all stopped. Some were even trying to sneak back to their own boats.Han Fei raised his boat and pointed at one of them, \u201cWhoever you are, I\u2019ll break your legs and throw you into the ocean if you run any farther.\u201dThe young man was too scared to run. Xia Wushuang was a level-eight fisher, and he had been knocked out by this guy in two attacks. Who was this guy?Not bothering what they were thinking, Han Fei shouted to He Xiaoyu, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, collect the points.\u201dHe Xiaoyu was stunned. She was ready for a brutal battle, but it was already over before she jumped on the enemy\u2019s boat?\u201cPu\u2026\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201dClutching the cabin wall with both hands, Xia Wushuang looked at Han Fei, his mouth full of blood.Han Fei said solemnly, \u201cI\u2019m the person whom you can\u2019t defeat.\u201dXia Wushuang: \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: Skilled StorytellerXia Wushuang\u2019s trial ended in advance, because he had lost his combat ability and his best fishers had been knocked out. It was impossible to rob other people with those level-five fishers.At this moment, Han Fei said to He Xiaoyu in frustration, \u201cWe can\u2019t sail so many boats back!\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cNobody will dare to rob you again when they see so many boats.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, do you think we are first place now?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cYou are the first place; I\u2019m probably behind the hundredth.\u201dHe Xiaoyu regretted that the battle had ended before she joined it. As a result, she felt ashamed to ask Han Fei to give several boats to her.Han Fei said, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound right. I think my points are excessive. I\u2019ll give you one\u2026 maybe two boats, so that you can make it to the top hundred.\u201dHe Xiaoyu\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cDo you mean it?\u201dDelighted, she went to pick the boats and exclaimed now and then.Han Fei said, \u201cYou can take however many green turtles and yellow fish you want, but not the blade fish.\u201dHe Xiaoyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dIt was already dusk. The gigantic sun was hanging about the surface of the ocean so closely as if they could walk into it if they took a step ahead.Sitting on the deck and watching the sun, Han Fei murmured, \u201cToo bad that there is no alcohol or cigarettes.\u201d\u201cWhat are cigarettes?\u201dHe Xiaoyu finished picking and was confident he\u2019d make it to the top hundred. She did not want to reach top three, nor was she capable of doing so.Han Fei asked, \u201cHas it ever occurred to you what a beautiful world we are in?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cAre we? My father said that the bottom of the ocean was much more beautiful, and that I couldn\u2019t imagine the plethora of colors there. I wish I could see them someday!\u201dHan Fei glanced at her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you learn to appreciate the gigantic sun for a start?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s good about the sun?\u201dHan Fei smiled. \u201cHave you ever wondered why the sun is so huge? Isn\u2019t it marvelous to you? What\u2019s holding such an enormous object? What\u2019s preventing it from crashing into us?\u201dHe Xiaoyu eyed Han Fei as if he were an idiot. \u201cThe Sea God, of course! The Sea God captured the most brilliant star in the darkness, and it turned into the sun!\u201dHan Fei: \u201c\u2026\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cHehe. I don\u2019t believe any of that crap.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cDo not speak ill of the Sea God. It was the Sea God who created the ocean, brought the light, and gave us all the wonders in the world.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, have you ever seen a rainbow?\u201dHe Xiaoyu: \u201c???\u201dHan Fei grabbed a bottle of water and said, \u201cLook at the sky and behold.\u201dHe had a mouthful of water and spewed it out to the sky.\u201cPu\u2026 Pu\u2026 Pu\u2026 Pu\u2026\u201dHe Xiaoyu looked at Han Fei in shock and sympathy. He seemed to be deranged. He was not turning back into the Han Fei a month ago, was he?\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dSuddenly, He Xiaoyu looked at the mist in shock and rubbed her eyes. Her mouth was hanging open.\u201cAhhhhhhh\u2026\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cBe quiet. Why are you yelling?\u201dHe Xiaoyu pulled Han Fei and pointed at the sky. \u201cThe Seven-Colored Divine Light\u2026 The Seven-Colored Divine Light that leads to the Sea God\u2019s realm\u2026\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cShut up. Ignorance is truly scary.\u201dHan Fei waved his hand and said when the rainbow was gone, \u201cIt\u2019s called a rainbow. It\u2019s caused by the optical dispersion and reflection when the sunlight reaches water drops that are approximately spheres\u2026 Forget it, you can\u2019t understand it anyway.\u201dHe Xiaoyu looked at Han Fei with her full interest. \u201cNo, it\u2019s the Seven-Colored Divine Light. Han Fei, did you meet the Sea God at the bottom of the ocean a month ago?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cI met many a sea conch.\u201dHe Xiaoyu wanted to ask more, but Han Fei interrupted her and said, \u201cLook, a boat is coming.\u201dThe Fishing Trial would be over soon. All the boats that passed by had fled in a hurry when they saw Han Fei\u2019s fleet. However, a few boats were coming straight at them.Han Fei and He Xiaoyu were both curious. Who was so bold?Han Fei asked, \u201cAre you ready to rob?\u201dHe Xiaoyu replied, \u201cYes!\u201dAs the boats approached, Han Fei saw Tang Ge, and Tang Ge saw Han Fei.He Xiaoyu hopped and waved her hand. \u201cTang Ge, we\u2019re here!\u201dTang Ge was astounded to see Han Fei\u2019s boats. \u201cHan Fei, what\u2026 has happened?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cOh! They\u2019re my loot.\u201dTang Ge: \u201c???\u201dTang Ge raised his head in disbelief. I\u2019m only away for less than a month, and you are capable of looting so many boats in the Fishing Trial?He Xiaoyu said enviously, \u201cIt\u2019s all because of the treasures you left for him, Tang Ge. How much good stuff did you give him? He\u2019s already capable of killing an inspector after a month.\u201d\u201cDid I leave many things\u2026 Wait, what? An inspector? Who killed an inspector?\u201dHan Fei was of a mind to stuff He Xiaoyu the Blabbermouth into the fish cabin. She had exposed all his secrets the moment they met.Holding Tang Ge\u2019s neck, Han Fei whispered to him, \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised. I had other fortuitous incidents. I spent five days on the ocean when you were not home. During the five days, I met a white-bearded old man who insisted on teaching an art to me\u2026\u201dThere was a lot of information in Han Fei\u2019s confession, but Tang Ge ignored the details and asked, \u201cWho tried to kill you?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cHaha! It wasn\u2019t a problem for me at all. Don\u2019t leak the secret, though. I told other people that I advanced fast because of the treasures you gave me.\u201dTang Ge nodded and said, \u201cOkay. It\u2019s best not to attract too much attention. However, killing an inspector is a big thing. Why did you\u2026\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cHe should be a traitor among the inspectors who worked for the Tigers. I only knocked him into the ocean when he was not prepared before a Snakebelt slithered through him. So, I didn\u2019t actually kill him.\u201dTang Ge was shocked. \u201cYou fell into the ocean? Were you hurt?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cAs you can see, I\u2019m absolutely fine.\u201dTang Ge said gloomily, \u201cThe Tigers are truly bold. Rest assured. I\u2019ll teach them a lesson after we\u2019re back.\u201dHan Fei said, not thinking that it was a big deal, \u201cForget it. Let me take care of it\u2026 Right, will you be home tonight? I\u2019ll teach you the technique if you are.\u201dFang Ze shook his head in the fog. A white-bearded old man? Battle technique? Could there be any great expert in Heavenly Water Village? It was indeed a miracle that the young man became a level-seven fisher from a level-two fisher, but in the city, there were people who grew from a regular fisher into a Hidden Fisher overnight. That was more splendid than the description of any word.Han Fei said unhurriedly, \u201cLet me tell you, the name of the battle technique is the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Conditioning\u2026\u201d\u201cSay what?\u201dAll of them were shocked when Fang Ze appeared out of nowhere.Overwhelmed, He Xiaoyu said, \u201cM-Master Angel.\u201dHan Fei was much better than He Xiaoyu, but he also pretended to be surprised. \u201cGreetings, Master Angel.\u201dFang Ze nodded and asked solemnly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the technique you talked about?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThe Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Conditioning.\u201dFang Ze said, \u201cTell me in detail how you met the old man.\u201dHan Fei began making things up. \u201cI was cultivating that night and felt that I was on the verge of a breakthrough, but something was always missing. Then, a white-bearded old man emerged out of thin air and told me that my body qualities were too bad. He then pressed his hand on my forehead, and I learned the technique.\u201dFang Ze mumbled, \u201cKnowledge Pouring, and a top body-polishing method\u2026 You met a Venerable-level expert. You\u2019re truly unbelievably lucky, boy!\u201dHan Fei asked foolishly, \u201cHow strong is a Venerable-level expert? Is he stronger than you, Master Angel?\u201dFang Ze chuckled. \u201cFor someone like you, it\u2019s best not to learn such things. All you need to know is that Venerables are the best experts in the ocean. Right, did you mention that the art was incomplete?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cIt includes 108 movements. Doing them is hard, but it\u2019s quite effective.\u201dFang Ze said, \u201cOf course\u2026 Tang Ge, we\u2019ll spend a few more days in Heavenly Water Village. You have to learn the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Conditioning.\u201dTang Ge hesitated. \u201cWell\u2026 The Venerable taught Han Fei the technique. Is it appropriate for me to learn it?\u201dFang Ze said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. The Venerable only taught him the basics, so he was not the Venerable\u2019s disciple. If he had the full technique, we would have to keep ourselves away from it.\u201dFang Ze then observed Han Fei, wondering why the Venerable guided a common fisher. Did the guy have any potential that he didn\u2019t notice?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: Can I Take These Fish?He Xiaoyu listened in silence, shocked as if she had heard the greatest secret.It was not Fang Ze\u2019s plan to visit them, but since he had arrived, he decided to give his juniors some greeting gifts. He took out two Crimson Sea Fruits and said, \u201cSince we\u2019ve met, these two spiritual fruits are my gifts for you!\u201dHe Xiaoyu accepted one of them, stunned. They were the Crimson Sea Fruits that only the village leader could enjoy! But the angel had tossed them to her casually!Han Fei, on the other hand, thought for a moment and said, \u201cMaster Angel, would it be outrageous if I propose a request?\u201dFang Ze was rather surprised that Han Fei did not take the Crimson Sea Fruit. A regular villager could resist such temptation? Even Tang Ge was too shocked to say anything when he saw the Crimson Sea Fruit for the first time.Fang Ze said, \u201cOh? What is it that you want? Although you are Tang Ge\u2019s brother, I won\u2019t take your Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Conditioning without giving anything in return.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cMaster Angel, could you grant me a boat? Regular boats are too fragile for battles. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll spend a long time here, so a good boat might be more useful than a spiritual fruit.\u201dFang Ze smiled and said, \u201cInteresting. You are smart. A good boat is much more important than a spiritual fruit.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHan Fei pretended to be surprised.Fang Ze waved his hand and said, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll give you a boat.\u201dA white boat appeared in the ocean out of nowhere. Its shape and decorations were much better than those of the boat they were onWhat caught Han Fei\u2019s attention was not the boat itself but how it appeared. He wondered if it had the same mechanism as his Forge the Universe.Fang Ze said, \u201cAll right, your trial will end soon. Go now.\u201dFang Ze disappeared in the blink of an eye.The village leader announced soon after Fishing Trial left, \u201cI hereby announce that the Fishing Trial has ended. Everyone will stay where they are. I will watch in the sky. The result of whoever moves will be nullified.\u201dAll the inspectors were deployed. Some parents also came in to check the result.An inspector came to Han Fei after a quarter. Han Fei was surprised. He knew the inspector to be Zhou Ding from the southern campus, who grabbed him out of the southern campus last time.Zhou Ding was stunned to see the dozens of boats. He thought that they must belong to a Heavenly Talent, but he exclaimed when he saw Han Fei and He Xiaoyu. \u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cNice to meet you, Mr. Zhou.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cNice to meet you, Mr. Zhou.\u201dTang Ge said, \u201cNice to meet you, Mr. Zhou.\u201dZhou Ding asked, \u201cAre you Tang Ge?\u201dAfter seeing Tang Ge, he was no longer surprised about so many boats. Who dared to stop the disciple of an angle from robbing them?\u2026Of the ten thousand boats that participated in the trial, only three thousand remained. At this moment, all the staff in the ports were summoned to calculate the fish on those boats.Scores were announced now and then.\u201cZhou Chang, total score: 481 points.\u201d\u201cDing Dayu, total score: 389 points.\u201d\u201cXu Erling, total score: 501 points.\u201dWhenever someone\u2019s score was above five hundred, people exclaimed, because such a score was almost certainly among the top thousand.Suddenly, one of the staff exclaimed, Wang\u2026 Wang Baiyu, total score: 4,982 points.\u201d\u201cHua!\u201dEverybody was shocked. It was almost five thousand points. The third son of the Wang family was truly extraordinary!One of the parents exclaimed, \u201cHe\u2019s definitely the second place!\u201dSome parents were envious. \u201cI\u2019m told that the angel will award the top three with Spirit Concentration Art. It must be an awesome battle technique.\u201dSome parents mocked, \u201cWhat do you know? Spirit Concentration Art is not a battle technique but a great profession. Those who practice Spirit Concentration are known as Spirit Concentrators.\u201dSome parents even said with mixed feelings, \u201cI wish that Wang Baiyu was my son!\u201d\u2026Han Fei, Tang Ge and He Xiaoyu were waiting for their scores to be calculated.It was Tang Ge\u2019s turn first. The staff was dumbfounded to see the chain of boats. Were they all Tang Ge\u2019s?Tang Ge pointed at them and said, \u201cThose five boats are mine.\u201d\u201cHu\u2026\u201dEverybody took a breath in relief. They almost thought that the boats all belonged to Tang Ge.Soon, someone exclaimed again, \u201cTang Ge\u2026 Tang Ge\u2019s total score is 5,882 points.\u201dThe parents remarked again, \u201cAs expected of the angel\u2019s disciple. He\u2019s a thousand points higher than Wang Baiyu.\u201dSomeone shook their head. \u201cNot just a thousand. If Wang Baiyu\u2019s family hadn\u2019t asked other people to help him, he couldn\u2019t have obtained five thousand points.\u201dWang Jie, as Tang Ge\u2019s teacher, blushed in excitement. That was his student! It seemed that they had a winner now.Nobody thought that the angel helped him, because it was not worth it. If the angel had taken action, he could\u2019ve reaped fifty thousand points easily.On the other hand, He Xiaoyu was brought away for statistics, too.He Mingtang had been observing her. When he saw that He Xiaoyu returned with Tang Ge and Han Fei, he knew that his daughter\u2019s result couldn\u2019t be bad.Before He Xiaoyu\u2019s fish was weighed, a worker announced, \u201cHu Kun, 1,299 points.\u201dHu Kun was excited. The last twelve hours had been perilous for him. He was almost killed many times even though he was in level seven now. After hearing the score, he knew that he could be among the top hundred.But he saw He Xiaoyu behind him and changed his face when he noticed the three boats that came with her. Did Li Hu not catch her?A moment later, the worker said in shock, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, total score: 3,012 points.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dHe Mingtang couldn\u2019t help but laugh in excitement.A teacher complimented him: \u201cOld He, you have a great daughter!\u201d\u201cMr. He, your daughter is a future grand fishing master!\u201d\u201cMr. He, my boy\u2019s score is not very high, but he is handsome and courteous. Can you consider him?\u201dHe Mingtang couldn\u2019t hear any of that now. Your son looks like a yellow fish, yet you say that he\u2019s handsome, and you want him to marry my daughter?All the parents saw He Xiaoyu\u2019s appearance and praised how beautiful she was.Someone even secretly remembered it and planned to ask his son to pursue her.Hu Kun was stunned. The score was a slap in his face. He thought that He Xiaoyu was robbed by Li Hu, but why did she have 3,012 points? Was He Xiaoyu stronger than him?Hu Kun saw Han Fei behind He Xiaoyu. Immediately, he felt awful, because he saw the dense boats behind Han Fei.\u2026Finally, it was Han Fei\u2019s turn to be calculated.The worker asked, \u201cAre you Han Fei? Which of these boats is yours?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cAll of them are mine.\u201dThe worker stared at Han Fei. \u201cSay what? All of them are yours?\u201dHan Fei nodded. \u201cYes! All of them.\u201dThe worker circled the boats in disbelief and asked again, \u201cAre they truly yours?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThere are so many teachers here. How can I be lying?\u201dHan Fei had twenty-one boats in total. Nobody could\u2019ve believed that they all belonged to one person!While they were calculating, one of the workers opened a cabin and exclaimed in shock. It was full of blade fish without a single green turtle. The worker was dumbfounded.Han Fei was the only one who knew that there were only four boats of blade fish, but that was still plenty.A moment later, when Han Fei\u2019s result was out, a worker simply cried.Everybody looked at the worker, but she raised the book and stammered, \u201cHan Fei\u2026 Han Fei\u2019s total score is 13,208 points.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: The First PlaceThe whole place fell quiet.Everybody had been chitchatting heatedly, but they were all rendered silent by the score.The teachers and the staff were dumbfounded, and so was the villager leader, the headmaster, and Wang Jie.Only Tang Ge was smiling. Han Fei scratched his head. The situation was getting awkward.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible! He cheated!\u201dHu Kun grew excited. He was truly shocked by the number, which was ten times higher than his. The only possibility he could think of was that Han Fei cheated. How else could he have acquired such a high score?Squinting, Han Fei looked at him and said, \u201cYoung man, you are responsible for what you\u2019re saying.\u201dThe village leader stood out and said, \u201cYoung man, what proof do you have to accuse Han Fei of cheating?\u201dOf course Hu Kun had no proof, but he suddenly had an idea. \u201cIt must be Tang Ge. Han Fei and Tang Ge are good brothers. Tang Ge must\u2019ve given his points to Han Fei. Why else could he have acquired such a high score?\u201d\u201cHumph\u2026\u201dTang Ge stood out and said, \u201cHu Kun, stop slandering. I did not give Han Fei a single point. He won his points on his own.\u201dHu Kun said excitedly, \u201cYou\u2019re lying! He was only a level-two fisher two months ago, but after a month, he got more than ten thousand points in the Fishing Trial. Can you believe that?\u201dThe village leader and other people looked at Han Fei, wondering if he was a level-two fisher a month ago. He certainly did not look like one right now.Han Fei was not bothered. \u201cHu Kun, everybody has their own lucky moments. Shouldn\u2019t I have mine after all the life-and-death experiences? You, on the other hand, can\u2019t make it to the top ten anyway with your thousand points. So why are you attacking me? Is it because you are jealous of me?\u201dSome parents shouted, \u201cYoung man, tell us how you got the points!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s not a problem to explain the source of the points, is it?\u201d\u201cHow many people did you rob to get so many points?\u201dMany people were shouting. Some were truly interested, and some were merely enjoying the drama.The village leader scolded, \u201cSilence! The calculation is not over yet!\u201dFinally, when the noises died down, the village leader looked at Han Fei and hesitated. \u201cHan Fei, you can talk about it if you want. I guarantee that nobody will ask for your trouble.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cVillage leader, can I hold you to your word?\u201dThe village leader said, \u201cOf course! Just spill it out. Nobody will ask for your trouble.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThis is what happened. I was not interested in robbery at all, but many people came to rob me, including Li Hu, Xia Wushuang, and other students that I did not know. So, I robbed them instead.\u201dHan Fei finally bared his fangs at this moment. The Heavenly Talents in the village were nothing at all for the big shots. How could he rise to higher places if he couldn\u2019t compare to the Heavenly Talents? So, he thought it was time for him to reveal his abilities.\u201cWhat? You robbed Li Hu?\u201d\u201cHuh? I saw Xia Wushuang return after being wounded. Was he robbed by Han Fei?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible! Li Hu is a level-eight fisher!\u201d\u201cXia Wushuang\u2019s Spiritual Heritage is Level Four, Low Quality. Could Han Fei defeat him?\u201dPeople whispered to each other, unconvinced.Hu Kun scolded, \u201cThat\u2019s poppycock. Li Hu and Xia Wushuang are both level-eight fishers. How could you have robbed them of their boats?\u201dHan Fei looked at him pitifully. \u201cIs it a surprise? Because they couldn\u2019t defeat me! Do you want them to speak for themselves?\u201dIt was a pity that neither Li Hu nor Xia Wushuang could stand up right now.Li Jue was clenching his fists among the parents. He could not burst into fury although his son had almost been crippled. He even needed to thank his enemy for not killing his son.Xia Wushuang was also a proud man. His Spiritual Heritage was only second to Tang Ge\u2019s in Heavenly Water Village, and he was supposed to be the strongest other than Tang Ge, but he was defeated by a Mr. Nobody. Why would he embarrass himself by explaining the details to the public?Looking at the staff, Han Fei said, \u201cIs my score certain now?\u201dThe staff looked at the village leader and nodded. \u201cHan Fei\u2019s total score is 13,208 points. Whoever is not convinced is free to check it later, but you must not hinder the following calculations.\u201dHowever, Han Fei did not leave immediately. He asked the staff in a low voice, \u201cI wonder if I could take those fish away.\u201dAfter a brief pause, the staff said, \u201cWe provide delivery service. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy to take dozens of boats away.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cIt\u2019s very easy! I\u2019ll take them back on my own.\u201dThe staff: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u2026The calculation continued. It was finished before nightfall.Standing on a floating boat, the villager leader announced with a list in his hand.\u201cThe first place is Han Fei. Total score: 13,208 points.\u201d\u201cThe second place is Tang Ge. Total score: 5,882 points.\u201d\u201cThe third place is Wang Baiyu. Total score: 4,982 points.\u201d\u201cThe fourth place is Xiang Nan. Total score: 4,356 points.\u201d\u2026\u201cThe seventh place is He Xiaoyu. Total score: 3,012 points.\u201d\u2026\u201cThe tenth place is Chen Qing. Total score: 2,222 points.\u201dThe results after the tenth place plummeted. Eventually, Hu Kun was the 86th place. It was not a bad result, but it was not nearly as good as the top ten places.According to the final result, the score of the thousandth place was 496 points.Some were delighted, and some were upset. While the top thousand were happy, they were touched by what the villager leader said next.\u201cDear students, I believe that you have recognized the cruelty of the Fishing Trial, which is a reflection of reality. In the level-one and level-two fisheries, such things happen on a daily basis.\u201dMany students and parents fell silent. In fact, some of the parents had been silent since the beginning, because they didn\u2019t find their children.The village leader continued, \u201cDo you know the casualties of this Fishing Trial? According to the inspectors, 13,564 students took part in the Fishing Trial, but only 10,321 returned. Twenty percent of them are buried in this ocean.\u201dEverybody was touched, including Han Fei himself. He knew that there were casualties, because many boats he looted were empty in the first place. Many students who were in alliances attacked each other. That was the biggest cause of casualties.The village leader said emotionally, \u201cThe reality is cruel. Only 2982 boats were able to finish the Fishing Trial. Five thousand people were injured in the trial, some permanently\u2026 I\u2019m telling you this not to intimidate you, but to inform you that in order not to perish in this man-eating ocean, you have to work extra hard. There is always hope as long as you are alive.\u201dHan Fei fell silent after hearing the statistics. This was only a Fishing Trial of the village. What about the town and the city?For the first time, he recognized the cruelty of this world, the cruelty of cultivation. To become a Hidden Fisher as good as Fang Ze, how many bones must one step on?Han Fei looked at the parents at the periphery. Nobody smiled anymore. Some were weeping, and some were comforting them.Han Fei took a deep breath. He had to compete with people and with fate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: Toss the Fish for FunThe first thing that Han Fei did after he returned to the floating island was to ask Li Gang to make barbecue.At night, hundreds of people were gathered around the barbecue stand in the market.Li Gang was sweating hard as he roasted the food. He shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t be hasty! There will be a half-price in our shop in the next three days! You can come whenever you want.\u201dLi Gang was too busy to even drink any water, but he was delighted. He was hated when he collected protection fees for the Tigers before, but right now, his barbecue was in such high demand that people were voluntarily throwing their money at him.Li Gang and his girlfriend were busy in the market, and Han Fei, Tang Ge, and He Xiaoyu were enjoying barbecue in Han Fei\u2019s home. They were having a headache over how to deal with the fish they caught.He Xiaoyu\u2019s three boats had been taken away by He Mingtang. After Han Fei sorted out the boats he had, he still had fifteen full boats. Even though he had given Li Gang three, he still had twelve full boats that he had no place to put away.Enjoying the garlic lobsters in his hand, Tang Ge remarked, \u201cDelicious! This is delicious! We should make all fish into barbecue. We\u2019ll make a lot of money.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThey are too many. We have hundreds of thousands of kilograms of fish.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cConsidering the weather right now, the fish will die and go bad within one week.\u201dTang Ge proposed, \u201cShould we sell them?\u201dThinking for a long time, Han Fei said, \u201cThey were taken from the ocean, so they should be returned to the ocean. Why don\u2019t we throw them back into the ocean?\u201d\u201cThrow them back?\u201dTang Ge and He Xiaoyu looked at Han Fei as if he were an idiot. Had he forgotten the bitter days of the past so quickly?Han Fei said, \u201cOur barbecue stand can use up two boats of fish by tomorrow night at best. The rest will be wasted.\u201dNoticing their disdain, Han Fei immediately said, \u201cYou do not understand it? We have been absorbing resources from the ocean all the time. Now that the resources are excessive, we\u2019d better throw them back into the ocean instead of letting them rot, right?\u201dTang Ge scratched his head. \u201cThen, why did you take those fish back? You could\u2019ve sold them at the port.\u201dHan Fei had a bite of the lobster and said, \u201cThey were too lonely in the ocean. I took them to the sky for a ride.\u201dTang Ge: \u201c???\u201dHe Xiaoyu: \u201c???\u201dThen, ignoring them, Han Fei jumped onto a boat. He had rented all the boats from the port, and they were tied somewhere near his home right now.He Xiaoyu nudged Tang Ge and said, \u201cDid you notice that, although he is growing strong very fast, his brain sometimes malfunctions?\u201dTang Ge said unhappily, \u201cWhat are you talking about? How could he have won the favor of a Venerable if something is wrong with his brain?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cI feel that he changed after he was pulled out of the water last time.\u201dTang Ge was deep in thought. Was this Han Fei\u2019s real nature?Then, He Xiaoyu hesitated. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible that a fish turned into He Xiaoyu? It\u2019s said that there are fish who can turn into humans in lands unknown!\u201dTang Ge scorned and looked at He Xiaoyu speechlessly. \u201cI think my brother is fine. You, on the other hand, need to check your brain.\u201dAt this moment, Han Fei had started throwing the fish. He smiled happily every time he threw a fish down. Tang Ge and He Xiaoyu were both dazed.He Xiaoyu said, \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201cStay there,\u201d Han Fei scolded He Xiaoyu, who was going to jump off. \u201cGirls shouldn\u2019t do the hard work. Sit there and enjoy the barbecue.\u201dTang Ge smiled and said, \u201cLet me help you.\u201d\u201cYou stay there, too.\u201dTang Ge: \u201c???\u201dHan Fei rolled his eyes and said, \u201cFine, it\u2019s not an urgent task to throw the fish. I\u2019ll teach you the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Conditioning first.\u201dHe Xiaoyu pouted her lips and said, \u201cOkay! I\u2019ll go back.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cWhy are you going back? You can learn it together.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHan Fei looked at Han Fei in shock. \u201cReally? I can learn it, too?\u201dHan Fei waved his hand and said generously, \u201cI don\u2019t have many friends. How can I forget you?\u201dHan Fei, who climbed up the cliff, mumbled to himself, I won\u2019t tell you that I\u2019m only teaching you because I don\u2019t want you to throw my fish!He Xiaoyu was quite excited. According to Fang Ze, it was a top battle technique of the legendary Venerables! She didn\u2019t know what Venerables were, but they had to be strong.Tang Ge was the same. He thought that Han Fei could barely pass the Fishing Trial, but right now, Han Fei was already able to teach him a battle technique.Han Fei said, \u201cStand there and imitate me. Try to be exactly the same.\u201dTang Ge said, \u201cOkay.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cNot a problem.\u201dThe first movement was to bend back and reach one hand to the ground and the other to the feet.Han Fei completed it easily. Tang Ge blushed as the movement was difficult. He Xiaoyu, on the other hand, fell on the ground.Han Fei said, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, are you capable of this or not? Girls are supposed to be more pliable than guys. How did you fall?\u201dHe Xiaoyu: \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult!\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cDo you want to learn it or not?\u201dHe Xiaoyu nodded quickly, \u201cI do.\u201dOne, two, three\u2026Han Fei taught eighteen movements in a row. Both Tang Ge and He Xiaoyu were sweating hard by the eighth and almost collapsed after they were done.Han Fei was puzzled. It was difficult for him at the start, but he could complete thirty-six movements. Was their poor performance because of his bad teaching?Fang Ze observed everything from the sky. He nodded now and then. Every movement of the top battle technique required all the muscles on the human body. He wondered if he should study it, too.\u201cForget it. It\u2019s fine for the juniors to learn it, but if I do\u2026\u201dTang Ge and He Xiaoyu breathed so heavily as if they just came out of the ocean. As they continued, Tang Ge suddenly sensed something. \u201cHuh? The capacity of my spiritual energy has increased.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cReally? Ah\u2026 That\u2019s true!\u201dThey were about to tell Han Fei the good news, but Han Fei was nowhere to be seen. They walked out of the room, only to see that Han Fei was throwing the fish and whistling in delight.Han Fei was angry to see them. \u201cYou stopped already? You can\u2019t stop until tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHe Xiaoyu was frightened. The world was falling apart for her after she finished the eighteen movements. Did she have to repeat them until tomorrow morning?Tang Ge\u2019s lips also twitched. He wondered if he could make it.Suddenly, Han Fei patted his head and said, \u201cHey, I forgot that I still had some Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid. Take some of that, and you will feel nothing during cultivation. I cultivated myself for three days in a row back then.\u201dTang Ge looked at Han Fei in shock. It was hard for him to finish the difficult movements once, and Han Fei did them for three days? Also, the whole set included 108 movements!Immediately, Tang Ge said, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, let\u2019s go and keep practicing.\u201d\u2026While Han Fei was throwing fish and Tang Ge and He Xiaoyu were cultivating, He Mingtang was angry on his way to Han Fei\u2019s home. Yes, you helped my daughter in the Fishing Trial, but this doesn\u2019t mean that you can kidnap her. Look, she\u2019s not home yet even when it\u2019s so late.Before He Mingtang reached Han Fei\u2019s home, a person appeared in front of him and shocked him.He was dumbfounded after he recognized who the person was. \u201cM-Master Angel.\u201dFang Ze asked, \u201cWho are you? Why are you here?\u201dHe Mingtang replied in a hurry, \u201cMaster Angel, I-I\u2019m here for my daughter. Tomorrow will be the day of spirit awakening, but my daughter is not home yet, so I\u2019m here to look for her.\u201dFang Ze asked casually, \u201cIs your daughter He Xiaoyu?\u201dHe Mingtang nodded. He Xiaoyu was indeed at Han Fei\u2019s place.Fang Ze waved his hand and said, \u201cGo back now! He Xiaoyu is lucky to have the chance to practice an ultimate technique. She\u2019ll join the awakening ritual on her own tomorrow.\u201d\u201cHuh? An ultimate technique? Right, of course. I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201dHe Mingtang was shocked. The angel said that it was an ultimate technique! His daughter was truly good! His anger was gone, and he returned in delight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: Spirit Awakening (PART I)Han Fei\u2019s arm was sore after throwing fish for a whole night.But he was delighted when he checked his data.Owner: Han FeiLevel: Seven (Advanced Fisher)Spiritual Energy: 38,112 (279)Spiritual Heritage: Level Two, Low Quality (Upgradeable)Weapon: Purple Bamboo RodMain Art: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)\u2026He spent tremendous spiritual energy in the Fishing Trial and had no more than twenty-seven thousand points left afterward. After one night, he had earned ten thousand back. It was not bad.The dawn would arrive in two hours. Han Fei wondered if he should improve his Spiritual Heritage. If the awakening ritual had something to do with one\u2019s potential, Spiritual Heritage would be very important.He knew Fang Ze must be around, but he was not certain that the man would discover it.Thinking for a moment, Han Fei thought that he could give it a try. He dared to do so because he thought that Fang Ze was not as prestigious as people believed. Heavenly Water Village was only a village, and there were towns and cities above it. If Fang Ze was here to host the awakening ritual, didn\u2019t it mean that all the other villages had similar experts as hosts?Even if Fang Ze noticed something wrong, he could still make up a story and fool him. There was Tang Ge after all. The other boy certainly couldn\u2019t hurt him.Thinking about that, Han Fei climbed the cliff, only to see that Fang Ze was enjoying barbecue and liquor on the roof of his house.When he saw Han Fei, he said casually, \u201cThis food is not bad. I did not know that the lowliest spiritual fruits were so delicious. Also, how did you make this alcohol? Tell me the mechanism later.\u201dHan Fei scratched his head and dropped the idea of improving his Spiritual Heritage. How could he do that in front of Fang Ze without exposing the Demon Purification Pot?He said in a hurry, \u201cIf you like it, I\u2019ll give you the method to make the alcohol as well as barbecue.\u201dFang Ze nodded. He waved his hand, and a piece of vintage jade appeared before Han Fei.Fang Ze said, \u201cI won\u2019t take advantage of you. I promised the top three of the Fishing Trial that I would give them Spirit Concentration, but since you were the first place and also offered the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Conditioning, I\u2019ll give you this spiritual book. It contains many ways of cultivation for a Spirit Concentrator. It depends on yourself how much you can learn.\u201dHan Fei was shocked. The Spirit Concentration Art was changed into the ways of cultivation for a Spirit Concentrator? That\u2019s much better.Han Fei said, \u201cThank you, Master Angel.\u201dFang Ze stopped talking to Han Fei, and Han Fei came to Tang Ge and He Xiaoyu. They were not just sweating now; they were practically smoking. There was no telling what Fang Ze had given them.However, Han Fei speculated that they just took spiritual fruits such as the Crimson Sea Fruits, because he could smell the fragrance.Han Fei joined the cultivation, but he did not ask Fang Ze for a spiritual fruit. He thought a boat was already fair enough.The morning sun dyed the sky red. Every time he saw the view, Han Fei found the world wonderful and marvelous.Crack!He Xiaoyu, who was maintaining a weird posture, had tremendous unknown matter emerging from her body as if she had broken certain obstacles.\u201cBody cleansing?\u201dHan Fei recognized it quickly. The same thing happened to him when he upgraded his art, except that He Xiaoyu\u2019s effect was not as good as his, probably because she only took a spiritual fruit.\u201cI\u2019m level eight now?\u201dBAM\u2026He Xiaoyu fell on the ground. She was too tired. Practicing the eighteen movements was the most exhausting thing she\u2019d done in her entire life. Tang Ge, on the other hand, did not rise until he finished the last movement.\u201cI feel good.\u201dTang Ge grinned and said, \u201cI feel that my capacity for spiritual energy has increased by at least thirty points. This art is truly magnificent.\u201dHan Fei was shocked. \u201cHow many?\u201dTang Ge said, \u201cThirty points. Are you not the same?\u201dHan Fei was lost for words. He did not want to talk to Tang Ge. Was that the difference between a mortal and a genius? He only increased a dozen points after completing all the 108 movements.He Xiaoyu said enviously, \u201cSo many? Why do I feel that mine only increased by ten points?\u201dHan Fei said gloomily, \u201cMine was even fewer.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dFang Ze appeared and laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s the power of the Spiritual Heritage. Not bad. After learning the 108 movements, Tang Ge, you will be invincible in your level. Hahaha\u2026\u201dFang Ze was obviously very delighted. Han Fei sensed that it was probably because he could mock those who sent him to this shabby place after he returned to the city.\u2026The most sacred place on the floating island was the center of it. Even the village leader was not qualified to live here.It was the first time that Han Fei had come to the center of Heavenly Water Village. There was a stone statue in this place. It was a woman who was raising a fishing pole high. Many offerings were laid before the statue.\u201cDaughter!\u201dHe Mingtang was relieved to see He Xiaoyu come with Han Fei and Tang Ge. He observed He Xiaoyu and said in shock, \u201cDaughter, you are a level-eight fisher now?\u201dHe Xiaoyu blushed. \u201cFather, don\u2019t ask too much.\u201dHe Mingtang said, \u201cRight, of course. I won\u2019t ask. Just keep it to yourself. Don\u2019t tell me anything.\u201dHe Mingtang could barely stop grinning. It seemed that hanging around with Han Fei and his brother was not bad! He thought that the angel must\u2019ve granted his daughter the ultimate technique because she was Tang Ge\u2019s friend.He Mingtang said, \u201cAll right, pay tribute to the Sea God and join the team. You will be the first batch in the awakening ritual. Don\u2019t slack off.\u201dHan Fei was astounded. \u201cIsn\u2019t the Sea God a man?\u201dHe Mingtang\u2019s face darkened. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Don\u2019t say such nonsense when you\u2019re paying tribute.\u201dHan Fei mumbled that the Sea God in his place was a bearded man holding a trident that was much more impressive than a fishing pole.There were no rules concerning the tribute. Han Fei took out his fishing pole and prayed like He Xiaoyu and Tang Ge did.After paying tribute to the Sea God, they entered the circle and stood behind the statue of the Sea God.It was a pit with a coverage of two hundred square meters. The bottom of the pit was flat, with many complicated patterns. It looked like a splendid swimming pool.Around the pool were rows of stairs that looked like the auditorium in a stadium. At this moment, all the stairs were seated. Many people had come for the annual gala. Some came with their kids, and some were here just for fun.Han Fei and his companions were brought to the behind of the statue, where there was a channel to the pool.Han Fei saw Wang Baiyu, Xiang Nan, Chen Qing, and a few other people that he did not recognize. They nodded at each other. After all, none of the top ten would be ordinary in the future. They were the most distinguished young men on the floating island that harbored six hundred thousand people.Before the awakening ritual, people were crying the names of the top ten.\u201cTang Ge! Tang Ge! Tang Ge!\u201d\u201cWang Baiyu! Wang Baiyu! Wang Baiyu!\u201d\u201cXiang Nan! Xiang Nan! Xiang Nan!\u201dThe cheers echoed each louder than the last.Few people cheered for the dark horses like Han Fei, because they just learned about him. But Tang Ge was different. Tang Ge was already a role model for He Xiaoyu. Even He Xiaoyu had some fans cheering for her.Tang Ge, Wang Baiyu, and Xiang Nan were names that were cheered most.\u201cHan Fei!\u201dThe roar suddenly silenced the audience. Everybody looked at the person who cheered for Han Fei.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: Spirit Awakening (PART II)Looking at the source of the cheer, everybody saw Xia Wushuang, who should\u2019ve been a top ten but was now seated among the audience. Ignoring the others, he cheered for Han Fei again.It was quite a weird moment when Xia Wushuang was the only one who cheered for Han Fei.\u201cGood for you!\u201dHan Fei waved his hand at the auditorium and shouted back.Everybody: \u201c???\u201dHe Xiaoyu, Wang Baiyu, and the rest of them were stunned next to Han Fei. Could it be more embarrassing?Xia Wushuang clenched his fists. He knew that everybody underestimated Han Fei, whose power was much more terrifying than what a student who took part in the Fishing Trial should have.Han Fei said, \u201cLook, there are always people whose eyes are keen.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cAre there? Why is nobody cheering for me?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThey\u2019re all planning to introduce their sons to you. Cheering for you now will make them an enemy for everybody else.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cYou are the worst.\u201dTang Ge said, \u201cIt feels awful to be cheered by someone you don\u2019t know.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re popular! You\u2019re a role model.\u201dTang Ge said, \u201cI think you can be a role model, too.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cI could be a role model for girls. I\u2019m the only female among the top ten.\u201dWang Baiyu was speechless overhearing their conversation. Are you not nervous at all? This ritual will influence the rest of your life!Wang Baiyu said, \u201cHan Fei, Tang Ge, remember to walk to the center later. It will benefit you.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the hole at the center for?\u201dWang Baiyu explained, \u201cIt\u2019s where the Spirit Awakening Water springs out.\u201d\u201cPu\u2026\u201dHan Fei nearly choked. He did not know this at all.Han Fei asked, \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t there be too much Spirit Awakening Water? Such a pool is enough for thousands of people!\u201dWang Baiyu said, \u201cThe Spirit Awakening Water has been diluted. Have you never watched the previous rituals?\u201dHan Fei immediately said, \u201cOf course I have, but I never tried it in person. How I wish I could bathe here every day!\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter a moment, the top thousand of the trial were in position.The village leader announced before everyone, \u201cPlease keep your voices down\u2026 The awakening ritual for this year is about to begin with exactly the same rules as in the past. The top ten will go to the pool first. An hour later, the top hundred will join. After two hours, the rest of you will follow. You must get out of the pool the moment your naturally-endowed spiritual beast is awakened\u2026\u201dThe village leader read the list. \u201cNow, Han Fei, Tang Ge, Wang Baiyu\u2026 He Xiaoyu, Jia Tong, Li Yuanyuan, Chen Qing will go to the pool\u2026\u201dExcitedly, they walked down the stairs while the other students watched them enviously. This was the privilege for the top places because they were presumably the most talented. The rest of the students could only come later.The Spirit Awakening Water was not filled in the pool yet. Han Fei and his companions scattered around the hole at the center and sat down.He Xiaoyu and Tang Ge were seated at Han Fei\u2019s sides, five meters away from each other.He Xiaoyu asked, \u201cHan Fei, what do you think my spiritual beast is? I\u2019m so excited!\u201dHan Fei thought for a moment. He had only seen Wang Jie\u2019s giant crab since he came to this world. Li Hu\u2019s tiger-head fish was probably not a spiritual beast.So, Han Fei said, \u201cProbably a crab.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s hideous. I don\u2019t want a crab! The spiritual beasts might not be from the general fishery. Many people\u2019s spiritual beasts are unseen. Some even had corals.\u201d\u201cWhat? Corals are a beast?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, probably not. However, those who are awakened with corals have remarkable defense abilities. I don\u2019t know what will come to me.\u201dHan Fei was rendered speechless. He felt that it was good enough to have any spiritual beast. He wondered if it was a lottery where the treasure from the ocean was completely random.Wang Baiyu said, \u201cMost people\u2019s spiritual beasts are familiar to us. However, the strange spiritual beasts are always exceptional.\u201dHula\u2026Hardly had Wang Baiyu finished speaking when a pillar of water rose.Tang Ge said, \u201cCalm down and focus.\u201dThe water surged up fast. Very soon, everyone\u2019s chests had been submerged. At this moment, green fluids flowed out of the hole and dyed the whole pool green. Then, the water reached their chins.Tang Ge said, \u201cHold your breath.\u201dHan Fei took a deep breath. Soon, his head was already drowned, and everyone was fixed under the water. Han Fei looked at Tang Ge and He Xiaoyu, only to discover that they both kept their eyes closed.So, Han Fei closed his eyes, too.The moment he closed his eyes, Han Fei entered a marvelous state. He felt that he was in a magnificent ocean where the waves were brushing his body like gentle hands. It was very comfortable.Inside his head was a world of darkness. Around him and far away were countless glittering stars that were surging into his body crazily.After a long time, when the sparkling stars were gone, Han Fei found himself in a complicated channel. His body traveled like a streak of light until he saw an ocean.Han Fei could not see what was inside the ocean. It was very clear, but there seemed to be a film between him and the water that he could not pass.Suddenly, Han Fei saw a small calabash. He was shocked. Why are you everywhere? You\u2019re attending my awakening ritual, too? However, the Demon Purification Pot ignored him and started spinning, attracting tremendous fish. But those fish could not pass the film, either. So, new fish arrived and charged at the film\u2026Almost an hour had passed in the outside world.Suddenly, the water was boiling. Someone exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s here! Chen Qing is the first person to be awakened.\u201dHuala\u2026Chen Qing trembled. A fish in the shape of a sword appeared next to him and swam around him.Someone sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a swordfish. That\u2019s the most aggressive fish in the level-one fishery, but it\u2019s too common.\u201dSomeone argued, \u201cWhat do you know? It\u2019s from the level-one fishery anyway. You should know that most people\u2019s spiritual beasts are from the general fishery.\u201dThe village leader looked at the swordfish and shook his head. That was not good enough! Swordfish were too common in the town!Then, there was another anomaly in the water. This time, it was Li Yuanyuan. A giant meat tortoise showed up next to him. Everybody exclaimed.Someone shouted, \u201cA meat tortoise! There\u2019s a meat tortoise this year!\u201dLi Yuanyuan\u2019s father rose in excitement. The meat tortoise meant extraordinary defensive abilities. With such a spiritual beast, his son would never perish in the fisheries.The village leader secretly nodded. This Li Yuanyuan was definitely more promising.\u2026Then, Jia Tong had a giant crab like Wang Jie did. However, his crab was not as good as Wang Jie\u2019s. Wang Jie\u2019s spiritual beast was a green jade crab that could only be found in the level-one fishery, but Jia Tong\u2019s was only a common crab from the general fishery. The gap was obvious.The audience, however, did not care about that. Someone even said enviously, \u201cCrabs can be used in both offense and defense. It\u2019s not bad at all.\u201dHe Mingtang was the most anxious of all. Normally, the longer the participants persisted, the stronger their spiritual beasts would be. He wondered what his daughter would get.To He Mingtang\u2019s surprise, Zhang Qiang, the sixth place, got an iron-head fish first. He Mingtang was delighted. He felt that his daughter must be more talented than them. That was why she had to wait longer.The iron-head fish raised exclamations. People often joked with the iron-head fish, but such fish were highly sturdy and were not much weaker than the meat tortoise.The fifth place got a swordfish.Xiang Nan, the fourth place, got the first strange fish, a ball fish. It meant that Xiang Nan would have high attack abilities in the future. Few young men could get a ball fish even in the town.Hum\u2026Suddenly, noises came from He Xiaoyu\u2019s side in the water.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: Dragon Feather LobsterHe Mingtang grew excited and sweated hard.Wang Jie said, \u201cDon\u2019t be excited. Xiaoyu has persisted for such a long time. Her spiritual beast will certainly be better than theirs.\u201dHe Mingtang nodded. \u201cYes, I have no doubt about that.\u201dPutong\u2026The village leader shouted, \u201cA strange fish! A strange fish!\u201dAll the audience rose. They exclaimed at the fish which was red, black, and white. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a fish! But it\u2019s so beautiful!\u201dHe Mingtang wept, \u201cA strange fish\u2026 Hahaha\u2026 The He family has a strange spiritual beast now\u2026\u201dThe village leader was rather thrilled, too. It had been decades since an unknown spiritual beast appeared in the village.If Han Fei\u2019s eyes were open, he would\u2019ve mocked those people for not knowing clownfish.Many people looked at the sky, as if they wondered if Fang Ze could recognize the fish.As they expected, Fang Ze stood in midair and said while looking at the clownfish next to He Xiaoyu, \u201cThis is a cardinal fish, also known as anemone fish. It\u2019s highly aggressive and feeds on sea anemone. It\u2019s rare, but it only has limited future abilities. If it can evolve into an obsidian fish, this child will be qualified to go to the city.\u201dEverybody whispered among themselves.Many people were startled. The fish fed on sea anemone? It could even be a qualification to go to the city?Many teachers surrounded He Mingtang.\u201cMr. He, congratulations! You have a marvelous daughter!\u201dHe Mingtang said, \u201cThank you! You\u2019re flattering me.\u201d\u201cMr. He, I have a relative who\u2019s in the town. Can you consider him?\u201dHe Mingtang said, \u201cHaha. My daughter is still too young\u2026\u201dWhile they congratulated He Xiaoyu, the students who got their spiritual beasts earlier than He Xiaoyu looked at her enviously.He Xiaoyu slowly opened her eyes. She saw a little fish which was half red and half black with a white mark on the head. Immediately, she smiled in great delight.\u201cWow! You\u2019re so cute! Are you my spiritual beast? Swim for me\u2026\u201dThe clownfish seemed able to understand what she said. It swam quickly around He Xiaoyu. She couldn\u2019t be more excited.The village leader said, \u201cCough, cough. Those who have acquired a spiritual beast, get out now!\u201dAt this moment, He Xiaoyu finally remembered that many people were watching. She immediately triggered a thought as her father taught her, and the clownfish disappeared into her forehead.He Xiaoyu looked at the bottom of the pool and noticed that Han Fei and Tang Ge were there. They would certainly have better spiritual beasts since they persisted longer. She decided to ask about her fish first.\u2026The first hour neared the end, and Han Fei, Tang Ge, and Wang Baiyu were left alone in the pool.Wang Baiyu couldn\u2019t hold it anymore. Accompanied by weird noises, a green tortoise with a highly-rising back showed up.\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026 an armored tortoise?\u201dSome of the audience was stunned. All the tortoises were quite good. The meat tortoise was invincible in the level-one fishery, and the armored tortoise had nearly the best defense.Their defense was not the best because legend had it that an extremely rare tortoise named rock-holding tortoise was in the level-one fishery. It was said that the rock-holding tortoise had a battle technique on the rock on their back. However, nobody had really seen a rock-holding tortoise. So, the armored tortoise was often accepted to be the best.The patriarch of the Wang family was also watching. He nodded after he saw the armored tortoise. \u201cGood boy, if you practice hard in the future, another great Armorist will appear in the Wang family.\u201dWang Baiyu was slightly disappointed to see the armored tortoise, but he still patted its shell. He looked around subconsciously, only to discover that Han Fei and Tang Ge were not up yet.An hour had already passed, and the greenness in the poll was slightly dissolved. The village leader announced, \u201cThe top hundred will go to the pool.\u201dHualala\u2026They jumped into the water in a hurry as if it were a public bathhouse, fearing that the Spirit Awakening Water would be absorbed by other people if they were slow.However, the audience did not pay attention to them. They were discussing Tang Ge and Han Fei.Someone felt weird. \u201cThis Han Fei seems capable. How could he have stayed so long in the pool?\u201dSomeone was puzzled. \u201cIs he a genius who is as good as Tang Ge?\u201dSomeone shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. I\u2019m told that Han Fei\u2019s Spiritual Heritage was only Level One, High Quality during the test. He must be staying there because of luck.\u201d\u2026Suddenly, the center of the pool boiled, and a fire rose to the sky.Fang Ze, who had been taking a nap with his eyes closed, appeared behind the statue of the Sea God after a blink and watched earnestly.Putong\u2026A slender creature about half a meter long soared into the sky. It was burning with crimson flames, with a red line from its head to its tail. There were red-and-white bone wings on its back and a pair of pincers on its head.Everybody was astounded. What was that?He Xiaoyu opened her mouth, and so did the students who were ready to join the pool. The creature was too strange!The village leader had no idea what it was at all. He simply exclaimed in excitement.\u201cTang Ge! Tang Ge! Tang Ge!\u201dEveryone was thrilled. They had never seen flames that could burn in the water.After Tang Ge woke up, he looked at Han Fei subconsciously, only to discover that Han Fei had not woken up yet and nobody else was around. He smiled and swam to the surface.After he got out of water, the first thing Tang Ge saw was what appeared to be a strange, burning lobster.Seeing that Tang Ge had woken up, Fang Ze announced in ecstasy, \u201cIf my guess is correct, this is the legendary Dragon Feather Lobster. It\u2019s said that their pincers are as hard as godly iron. I\u2019ve never seen it in person before.\u201dFang Ze felt that his trip was totally worth it. He was certain that Tang Ge would rise in the city soon. As Tang Ge\u2019s introducer, his position would rise higher and higher.Tang Ge mumbled, \u201cDragon Feather Lobster? Since you are completely on fire, why don\u2019t I call you Xiao Huo1?\u201dThe Dragon Feather Lobster dashed to Tang Ge\u2019s head and clutched the air with its pincers.Tang Ge got out of the pool while everybody cheered for him enviously.Fang Ze said, \u201cFantastic! You have probably gotten a legendary lobster spiritual beast.\u201dWhile Tang Ge was excited, he still looked at the pool.Fang Ze said, \u201cSince your brother has persisted so long, his result can\u2019t be bad. You only need to wait.\u201d\u2026Everybody was looking forward to Han Fei\u2019s result. A moment later, hundreds of students who came later awakened their spiritual beasts, but the results were not entirely satisfactory.The headmaster announced the results now and then.\u201cChen Fen has a blade fish as his spiritual beast.\u201d\u201cQian Yu has a green turtle as his spiritual beast.\u201d\u201cSun Luoluo has a blade fish as her spiritual beast.\u201d\u2026Han Fei was bored. He saw that the creatures had been replaced many times on the other side of the film. At first, there were plenty of them, but the creatures grew fewer and tougher as time went on. He even watched a fish bite a green crab into pieces only to be pierced through by an eel later.Is it because my Spiritual Heritage is too low?Han Fei sensed the water currents next to him. He could tell that He Xiaoyu and Tang Ge were already finished. Didn\u2019t they say that the longer one stayed in the water, the more potential he would have?Calabash, let\u2019s upgrade my Spiritual Heritage, shall we?The Demon Purification Pot ignored him and simply spun on.Suddenly, Han Fei vaguely saw a pure little fish whose exact color he could not tell on the other side of the film.Huh? Why are you so small? The lobsters, crabs and tortoises can swallow you easily, can\u2019t they?The moment the little fish appeared, the calabash spun crazily. The transparent film seemed to be falling apart as the little fish stuck its head against it.In the pool, a swirl suddenly appeared around Han Fei.Someone exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s coming!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What kind of spiritual beast would the first place of this Fishing Trial would have?Someone said, \u201cIt must be an exotic spiritual beast. After all, the sound this spiritual beast made was different.\u201dSomeone nodded. \u201cYes. What kind of exotic fish do you think Han Fei will get?\u201dAnother person guessed, \u201cI don\u2019t think his spiritual beast will be better than Tang Ge\u2019s.\u201dSomeone retorted, \u201cDon\u2019t count on that yet. He stayed in the pool longer than Tang Ge!\u201d\u2026Han Fei was a little excited at the moment as he felt the film was about to break. Did this mean that his spiritual beast was this tiny fish?Rip\u2026Suddenly, the film broke and he felt a burst of spiritual energy fly into the middle of his eyebrows. What surprised him was that there seemed to be another burst of spiritual energy besides this one.A pure white fish suddenly appeared beside Han Fei and then began to revolve around him.\u201cSpirit Swallowing Fish?\u201d\u201cWhat? Just a Spirit Swallowing Fish?\u201d\u201cAre you kidding me? I thought it was an exotic fish.\u201d\u201cNo way! It caused such a stir, but it turned out to only be a Spirit Swallowing Fish?\u201dFor a moment, the people on the stand all gasped in puzzlement.Suddenly someone said, \u201cNo! This Spirit Swallowing Fish has long barbels on its face, as well on its tail and fins. It seems to be better looking than an ordinary Spirit Swallowing Fish.\u201dA sharp-eyed individual pointed at the head of the little white fish and said, \u201cLook, there is a black dot on the head of this Spirit Swallowing Fish also.\u201dEveryone else immediately looked at it and found that there was a round black dot on the fish\u2019s head indeed, but so what? It was still a Spirit Swallowing Fish!Someone shook his head. \u201cThis is normal. I once caught a Spirit Swallowing Fish whose two fins were red, but wasn\u2019t it still a Spirit Swallowing Fish?\u201dSomeone echoed, \u201cYes, I also once caught a Spirit Swallowing Fish with a long black tail. It just had a little bit of mutation, but essentially it was still a Spirit Swallowing Fish.\u201dThe village leader glanced at it, a little disappointed, but still looked at Fang Ze hoping that he could give an answer.Han Fei and He Xiaoyu also looked at Fang Ze expectantly.Fang Ze shook his head. \u201cMaybe this Spirit Swallowing Fish has a slight mutation but it\u2019s not prominent. Ordinary people don\u2019t understand that even the worst exotic fish are much stronger than ordinary spiritual beasts. They have to figure it out slowly by themselves.\u201dTang Ge questioned, \u201cIs it bad?\u201dFang Ze replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not good but not that bad either.\u201dHearing Fang Ze\u2019s words, some people felt lost while others had their eyes light up. There were also some who felt disdain and of course, many people were also envious, such as those students who didn\u2019t enter the top thousand.Some people chose to ridicule. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of a Spirit Swallowing Fish? In terms of practicality, it\u2019s not even as good as Green Turtle. After all, Green Turtle has a very hard shell but Spirit Swallowing Fish can only be used to make soup!\u201dSomeone tried to defend the Spirit Swallowing Fish. \u201cActually, it\u2019s not bad. After all, it\u2019s still an exotic fish. At least, it has more spiritual energy than other fishes, right?\u201dSomeone sneered, \u201cCome on! Except for that, it can only be used for soups! Spirit Swallowing Fish is the easiest to fish in level-one fisheries. Otherwise, why would our four major schools have so much Spirit Swallowing Fish soup to drink?\u201d1 \u2026Han Fei opened his eyes and surfaced, immediately seeing a beautiful white fish with long barbels, a long tail, and a black dot on its head. And besides the white fish, there was a little black fish with long barbels, a long tail, and a white dot on its head.A string of data flashed before his eyes.Spiritual BeastTwin Yin-Yang Spirit Swallowing FishThey\u2019re the descendants of the mysterious primitive Yin-Yang Sky-Swallowing Fish. The black and white fish accompany one another. The white fish is docile, whereas the black one is cruel. They are symbiotic. As long as one lives, the other lives too.Level 0Mysterious100 pointsOmnivorous. They can swallow everything.The black fish is not visible. Except for the owner, only people with naturally-born Yin-Yang Divine Eyes can see it.1 Han Fei\u2019s eyes glazed over. What kind of damned fishes did he get as his spiritual fishes? Twin Yin-Yang Spirit Swallowing Fish\u2026 The name sounded cool, but why was their quality mysterious?\u201cCome out! Stop looking at it. It\u2019s just a Spirit Swallowing Fish.\u201d\u201cWhat are you staring at? No matter how long you stare at it, it\u2019s still a Spirit Swallowing Fish.\u201d\u201cWhat were we excited for? It\u2019s just the most common Spirit Swallowing Fish. What a waste of my time!\u201dThere were boos in the stands, but Han Fei just smiled.\u00a0You idiots just have no idea what awesome fishes I have! But I don\u2019t mind. If I\u2019m too outstanding, you guys will be jealous of me.Han Fei glanced at the black fish that was circling around the little white fish and his smile grew brighter.\u00a0Sure enough, no one can see you!With a thought from Han Fei, two spiritual lights flew into the middle of his eyebrows.After Han Fei went ashore, Tang Ge patted his shoulder solemnly. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. At least it\u2019s an exotic Spirit Swallowing Fish. And it\u2019s said that every cultivator can sign contracts with many fishes, such as the tiger-head fish of the Tigers. We can sign a powerful demonic fish later. \u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cHan Fei, don\u2019t worry about those people. All they know is to jeer at others. Maybe your Spirit Swallowing Fish has some effects they don\u2019t know about!\u201dWang Jie also came to Han Fei at the moment. \u201cExactly! Your fish is also an exotic fish. Although we often drink Spirit Swallowing Soup, as you can see, there are not many people who can have a Spirit Swallowing Fish as their spiritual beast\u2026\u201d1 At this moment\u2026The village leader shouted, \u201cWu Lei has a Spirit Swallowing Fish as his spiritual beast.\u201dWang Jie was embarrassed. \u201cWell\u2026\u201dHan Fei\u2019s face was dark.\u00a0Does your face hurt?Fang Ze was also a bit disappointed. He thought that Han Fei who had been enlightened by a Venerable-level expert should have gotten a powerful exotic spiritual beast, but it was a pity that the result was not satisfactory.They were all a bit down but Han Fei said with a smile, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Spirit Swallowing Fish? Even if it is a Spirit Swallowing Fish, my fish is the strongest Spirit Swallowing Fish in the infinite ocean.\u201dEveryone stayed silent.Some young men who didn\u2019t go down into the pool rolled their eyes.\u00a0Nonsense! The strongest Spirit Swallowing Fish in the infinite ocean? Yes, in your dreams!Han Fei looked at Tang Ge. \u201cWhat spiritual beast did you get?\u201dTang Ge wasn\u2019t sure what to say as he didn\u2019t want to discourage Han Fei. Should he say or not?But He Xiaoyu, this simple-minded girl, blurted out, \u201cAn exotic fish, a legendary-level Dragon Feather Lobster that even the angel hadn\u2019t seen.\u201dHan Fei\u2019s eyelids twitched. \u201cLegendary-level?\u201dTang Ge said, \u201cOne\u2019s own strength is the most important. You can\u2019t solely depend on your spiritual beast for cultivation.\u201dHan Fei knew that Tang Ge didn\u2019t want to discourage him, so he looked at He Xiaoyu and said, \u201cWhat about you? Did you get a big crab as your spiritual beast?\u201dHe Xiaoyu pouted. \u201cNo big crab! I don\u2019t like big crabs. Look, my Little Red looks so pretty. \u201dCOMMENTWith a twinkle of light between He Xiaoyu\u2019s brows, a clownfish appeared in mid-air and swam in the air around He Xiaoyu.Han Fei blurted out, \u201cA clownfish?\u201dSmack\u2026Xiaoyu gave him a slap. \u201cBah, bah, it\u2019s not a clownfish but a beauty fish.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe clownfish in Han Fei\u2019s eyes was a series of data floating in the air.Spiritual BeastCardinalfishA rare species of fish, with strong territorial awareness and combat capability, feeds on various anemones and can digest various venoms.Level 0Rare100 pointsAnemoneIf it evolves into an obsidian fish, it\u2019ll become a precious fish species.Han Fei thought about the man-eating sea anemone he saw on the seafloor and was a little surprised.\u00a0Does this fish eat sea anemone? That\u2019s pretty strong!He Xiaoyu snorted. \u201cYes, it also has a nice name, Cardinal.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cDid you all get exotic fishes? How many people have gotten exotic fish in total?\u201dHe Xiaoyu answered, \u201cJust Tang Ge and me! Oh, Wang Baiyu has a big turtle as his spiritual beast. Your Spirit Swallowing Fish should be at the same level as his big turtle.\u201dHan Fei knew that He Xiaoyu was trying to comfort him. How could a Spirit Swallowing Fish be at the same level as a big turtle? Even Giant Meat Turtles were way better than Spirit Swallowing Fish.These people who entered the pool later were quick to get their spiritual beasts. Almost no one lasted longer than half an hour, nor did they get an exotic fish. The best spiritual beast they got was a Snakebelt.After them, the remaining 900 people entered the pool and the color of the water in the pool began to fade quickly. These people finished even more quickly and almost all got their spiritual beasts within fifteen minutes. The best spiritual beast they obtained was a mutated Tentacle Lobster.When there were only dozens of people left in the pool, the green Spirit Awakening Fluid had been completely absorbed. Some of these people burst into tears.\u00a0I worked so hard to get ranked among the top 1,000 but ended up like this?Of course, Han Fei and his companions didn\u2019t see this scene because they had already gone home to practice the \u201cIncomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe cottage where Han Fei was living had become a forbidden area and even the village leader couldn\u2019t be within a kilometer of it.Seven days later.The sunset had almost set.In Han Fei\u2019s small courtyard, Tang Ge was panting and sweating with his hands on his knees.Tang Ge was soaked with sweat but laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve finally completed the 108 stances at once.\u201dHe Xiaoyu was still practicing the 96th stance and her hair was muddled by sweat, but she still asked persistently, \u201cTang Ge, how much has your upper limit increased?\u201dTang Ge felt it and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but now it seems to stop at 299 points and can\u2019t be increased anymore.\u201dHe Xiaoyu immediately exclaimed, \u201cWow, 299 points? That\u2019s so high! Is a level-nine fisher\u2019s affordability for spiritual energy so high? Mine seems to be only 199 points, but I feel it can still be increased as long as I complete all the 108 stances at once. Han Fei, how about you?\u201dHan Fei looked at his data.: Han Fei: Seven (Advanced Fisher): 42892(299): Level Two, Low Quality (Upgradable): Twin Yin-Yang Spirit Swallowing Fish: Purple Bamboo Rod: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)\u2026Han Fei wondered if 299 points was the threshold, but Tang Ge was already a level-nine fisher. Was his upper limit of spiritual energy only 299 points?On the surface, Han Fei just grinned. \u201cWhat a coincidence. Mine is also 199 points!\u201dHe Xiaoyu\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cI will soon surpass you!\u201dIn the past few days, Han Fei didn\u2019t dare to cultivate or upgrade his spiritual heritage but rather practice the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing with Tang Ge and other companions. In fact, his upper limit had early reached 299 points. He knew his upper limit probably wouldn\u2019t increase if he didn\u2019t make a breakthrough. But his breakthrough would make a pretty big racket. He\u2019d better not let Fang Ze, an outsider, see it, so he just practiced the 108 stances over and over again. Of course, besides that, he would also go to the plantation and barbecue stalls.But most of the barbecue he brought back was eaten by Fang Ze. This guy thought buying food at barbecue stalls would tarnish his image, so whenever he wanted to eat barbecue, he would gesture to Han Fei with his eyes and then Han Fei had to do the legwork for him.The only person who was allowed to come to this cottage these days was Li Gang who was terrified every time he came. He, a street hooligan, almost peed the first time he saw a big shot like an angel. Fortunately, Fang Ze knew that this guy was here to send material for making distilled spirits. Otherwise, he would have killed him with a slap.At this moment.Fang Ze was amazed. Tang Ge was already a level-nine fisher with an upper limit of 299 points for spiritual energy. How many people in the city could reach this level? And he still hadn\u2019t reached the peak. If he had, wouldn\u2019t his upper limit even exceed 300 points? It seemed that only a fishing master could do this!\u00a0What was my upper limit when I became a level-nine fisher? But now, only by practicing the Incomplete Monograph of Top Battle Technique, even small potatoes like He Xiaoyu and Han Fei have had their upper limit reach 199 points, which was really astonishing.If Fang Ze learned that Han Fei\u2019s upper limit of spiritual energy was actually 299 points, he would be dumbfounded. No matter how poor Han Fei\u2019s spiritual heritage was, he would take him to the city.Fang Ze came down from the roof and glanced at Tang Ge. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time. You can decide what to do tonight yourself!\u201dHearing his words, Tang Ge fell silent. Was it almost time for him to leave?He Xiaoyu\u2019s eyes turned red as soon as she heard this. Was Tang Ge leaving? She had just felt as though she were making another good friend and he was about to leave?Han Fei patted Tang Ge on the shoulder and said, \u201cI\u2019ll ask Li Gang to suspend his business and specifically cook barbecue for us tonight.\u201dTang Ge reminded him, \u201cAnd also liquor.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cAs much as you want.\u201dBoth of them grinned. As good brothers, they connected with one another.In the evening.Li Gang quickly came over. When he reached Han Fei\u2019s cottage, he didn\u2019t even dare to look around. He was so careful that he didn\u2019t even dare to walk fast, whereas his wife Little Red looked around and seemed to be curious as to why Young Master Han Fei lived in such a shabby place.Li Gang said, \u201cRed, please, don\u2019t look around. You\u2019ll offend the angel.\u201dLittle Red agreed, \u201cOh, OK!\u201dAt this time, Han Fei laughed. \u201cA-Gang, don\u2019t worry! The angel is not here. You\u2019ll be responsible for the barbecue tonight. Make as much as you can.\u201dLi Gang was relieved to hear that Fang Ze was away and immediately smiled. \u201cNo problem, Young Master.\u201dThen they began to drink and eat barbecue and fish.Tang Ge said, \u201cIn fact, Brother Fang Ze once told me that even if I went up above, I could come down and when I become stronger, I would be able to do it again.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Even if you can\u2019t come down, I can go to the above to hang out with you. Makes no difference.\u201dTang Ge smiled. \u201cI know you can do it. Everyone thinks you are relying on me, but I know you are not. You can become a level-seven fisher within a month, which proves that your talent is anything but ordinary.\u201dHe Xiaoyu glanced at Han Fei and didn\u2019t quite believe Tang Ge\u2019s words, so she just silently ate her barbecue.Han Fei suddenly asked, \u201cDon\u2019t people in the city go fishing? If they don\u2019t, how can they become stronger?\u201dTang Ge answered, \u201cYes, they do, but they don\u2019t have to fly up and down every day. There seems to be a portal matrix or something like that, through which they can directly go to the sea. And it is said that they\u2019ll be sent to at least a level-two fishery.\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cThat\u2019s great. Level-two fisheries, maybe I will be able to go there soon.\u201dTang Ge shook his head. \u201cIt is said that there are many level-two fisheries in the city.\u201dHan Fei nodded. \u201cYes, there are many villages and towns under a city, so there are certainly many level-two fisheries as well.\u201dThat night, they drank and ate barbecue until they were so full that they almost threw up. With a flushed face, Han Fei was drunk, but he still shouted, \u201cYou go up first and I\u2019ll be there sooner or later. My goal is the infinite ocean. As a \u2026 Belch\u2026 a gold hunter, there is no place in the world that I dare not go.\u201dHe Xiaoyu shook her head. \u201cHe is drunk.\u201dTang Ge agreed, \u201cThis liquor is really strong.\u201dWith that, Tang Ge got up and bowed to He Xiaoyu. \u201cHe Xiaoyu, Han Fei has no friends. Maybe you\u2019re his only friend. Please help me take good care of him.\u201dHe Xiaoyu pouted. \u201cBut he\u2019ll bully me.\u201dTang Ge grinned. \u201cNo, he won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cOkay! I\u2019ll take care of him for the sake of him teaching me the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing,\u201d He Xiaoyu agreed.Tang Ge got up. \u201cThen I\u2019m leaving.\u201dHe Xiaoyu asked, \u201cAre you leaving now?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d he replied before leaving.\u2026Tang Ge left with nothing left. Even the finest feast must break up at last, but he believed they would meet again.Han Fei lay on the ground muttering, \u201cMy goal is the infinite ocean, and\u2026 And the endless \u2026 Treasure.\u201d\u2026The Tigers.Li Jue was gloomy recently because he was so scared.Li Hu was disabled by Han Fei and the Tigers were almost destroyed. Fortunately, his spiritual fish survived, although it almost faced death. He was very angry and eager to kill Han Fei, but he did not dare make a move. As long as Tang Ge and Fang Ze were still here, he didn\u2019t dare to act rashly.\u201cLi Ju, come out.\u201dLi Jue\u2019s heart trembled. Did they come? Then he smiled bitterly. This day had finally come. He knew this would happen when Li Hu robbed Han Fei. No matter how powerful he was, he was nothing but an ant in Fang Ze\u2019s eyes, something to be crushed with one finger.At the gate of the tigers.Li Jue said, \u201cWelcome, Young Master Tang Ge.\u201dTang Ge didn\u2019t bother to hide the murderous intention in his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s not waste our time. I know what kind of person you are. You are very angry now and you want to kill my brother.\u201dLi Jue said, \u201cI dare not.\u201dTang Ge smiled. \u201cI had planned to kill you myself, but when I saw Han Fei today, I thought it was unnecessary. You, Li Jue, only deserve to be my brother\u2019s stepping stone.\u201dLi Jue remained silent but his clenched fists revealed his inner rage.Tang Ge sneered, \u201cNo matter how angry you are, you and your men tried to kill my brother more than once. You\u2019re exempt from the death penalty but hardly from punishment. I\u2019ll give you another chance. Wound yourself and make sure you won\u2019t recover within half a year.\u201dA cold gleam flickered in Li Jue\u2019s eyes.\u00a0Does Tang Ge really want to keep me as a stepping stone for Han Fei? But does Han Fei deserve this?Li Jue bit his mouth in resentment till it bled but he said without hesitation, \u201cThank you for sparing my life, Young Master Tang Ge.\u201dBANG, BANG, BANG\u2026Li Jue\u2019s body was covered with dozens of wounds. As blood flowed out from his wounds, he also vomited a large mouthful of blood.Fang Ze appeared beside Tang Ge silently at this moment, watching the scene indifferently.Tang Ge looked at Fang Ze, who nodded, signaling that Li Jue had done as he was asked to.On the way back, Fang Ze asked, \u201cAre you sure that Han Fei really can break that stepping stone?\u201dTang Ge nodded. \u201cYes, he is no longer the former Han Fei. I\u2019m pretty sure of this. The former Han Fei wouldn\u2019t have had a chance, but the current Han Fei can definitely make it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: Spiritual Heritage UpgradedWhen Han Fei woke up the next day, Tang Ge had gone.He Xiaoyu was still eating barbecue and when she saw that Han Fei had woken up, she shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re awake! Wanna have some breakfast?\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cHe Xiaoyu, have you eaten all night?\u201dHe Xiaoyu replied, \u201cNo! I just started eating.\u201dHan Fei looked at the pile of skewers in front of her and sighed. \u201cDid I starve you or what? Hurry home. A-Gang needs to go back to work.\u201dHe Xiaoyu pouted. \u201cTang Ge asked me to take care of you and not let anyone kill you.\u201dHan Fei was a little incredulous. \u201cYou? Take care of me? Do you think you can beat those I can\u2019t?\u201dHe Xiaoyu defended herself, \u201cWell, I\u2026 I can have Cardinal fight for me. The angel once said that Cardinal could be very strong.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s only level 0 now. Ask your father to help you upgrade your Cardinal at once. Otherwise, he might be bitten to death by someone else\u2019s Yellow Fish!\u201dHe Xiaoyu shouted back, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible! A spiritual beast will never be killed by an ordinary demonic fish unless by special means. And even if a spiritual beast is dead, there is a chance to summon it back from the spiritual sea.\u201d\u201cSpiritual sea?\u201dHe Xiaoyu explained, \u201cWell, it\u2019s, it\u2019s\u2026 An invisible sea! It is said that all spiritual beasts were born in the spiritual sea.\u201dHan Fei hadn\u2019t heard of it before, so he simply said to He Xiaoyu, \u201cNow go home. Otherwise, your father will think you were abducted by me. What if he comes here to hold me accountable?\u201d\u201cHumph, fine! I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019m going to ask my dad to help me upgrade Cardinal.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to pick you up.\u201dHe Mingtang\u2019s voice suddenly sounded from a short distance away.Noticing that his daughter seemed greatly changed and her face glowed with vigor, He Mingtang smiled. \u201cXiaoyu, come home with me. You\u2019ve just gotten your spiritual beast, and not to mention, an exotic fish. You\u2019ve gotta treat it carefully.\u201cDad, can Han Fei come home with us?\u201d He Xiaoyu pleaded.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201dHe Mingtang and Han Fei spoke in unison.\u201cCough, cough\u2026\u201dHe Mingtang said, \u201cYou can be rest assured. Last night, the leader of the Tigers, Li Jue, was seriously injured and may not be able to engage in any physical fights for at least six months. Now some people have begun to rectify the public security in the eastern port and the development of the Tigers have also been restricted. I am afraid that it will take at least a few months for Li Jue to recover.\u201dHan Fei thought to himself,\u00a0Was Li Jue seriously injured?He Mingtang took a deep look at Han Fei. Why would he be seriously injured? This was probably done by Tang Ge before he left, who feared Li Jue would hurt Han Fei. But everyone wondered why Tang Ge didn\u2019t kill Li Jue. It stood to reason that even if Tang Ge wiped out the Tigers, no one in Heavenly Water Village would stand up for them.Han Fei laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s great. He Xiaoyu, just go home! Now the Tigers are no longer a threat and I\u2019m going to work as an apprentice in the plantation. You can\u2019t keep following me.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cHumph, then I\u2019m leaving. When you see me next time, my Cardinal will have become very powerful!\u201d\u2026After He Xiaoyu left, Han Fei took a deep breath. Finally, they had all left.At the door of his cottage, Han Fei summoned the Twin Yin-Yang Spirit Swallowing Fishes. The two little fishes played and swam back and forth. The white one suddenly stopped and seemed to be \u2018looking\u2019 at Han Fei, whereas the black one dove straight to the bottom of the tank.Crack!Han Fei was stunned to see that the shell of a large sea clam at the bottom of the water tank was bitten through and the black fish was drilling into the shell. Within a few minutes, the sea clam shell was all that was left.But this little guy wasn\u2019t full yet and bit through another big sea mussel\u2019s shell.\u201cWow, the black fish is so fierce\u2026 Little White, I will call you Little White from now on. Little Black is too fierce. Let\u2019s not play with him.\u201dUnexpectedly, as Han Fei just finished saying this, and with a whoosh, the black Spirit Swallowing Fish suddenly jumped out of the water and spat at Han Fei.Han Fei was dumbfounded. \u201cHey, it\u2019s just a joke. Do you have to be so angry? Fine, we\u2019ll play with you, alright? Little guy, you\u2019re pretty grumpy.\u201dHan Fei thought to himself,\u00a0Sea clams are not very nutritious. Should I go to the sea to catch some better food to feed these two little guys?Forget it, it\u2019s been a bit painful to suppress this breakthrough these past few days. Let me make the breakthrough first.\u2026Han Fei entered the cave and sat down.But the first thing he did was not make the breakthrough but upgrade his spiritual heritage. He had waited for half a month and now the people who could detect that something was wrong with his body should have disappeared. He could finally upgrade safely.Upgrade.With a thought from Han Fei, in a split second, his body was enshrouded with spiritual energy. He immediately felt his bones numb and then a needling pain. At the same time, impurities began to ooze out of his pores and after a while, he felt his bones become a little stiff but more powerful.At this time, Han Fei was glad that he didn\u2019t choose to upgrade in front of Fang Ze. Otherwise, such an obvious situation of his tendons washing and marrow cleansing would definitely be noticed and then he wouldn\u2019t even know how to explain it.About half an hour later, the spiritual energy enshrouding him was mostly absorbed and no impurities oozed out anymore. At this time, Han Fei looked at his own data.: Han Fei: Seven (Advanced Fisher): 100 points: Level Two, Mid-Quality (Upgradable): Twin Yin-Yang Spirit Swallowing Fishes: Purple Bamboo Rod: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)\u2026Han Fei couldn\u2019t help but twitch his mouth. So he had consumed as much as 10,000 points of spiritual energy and his spiritual heritage just upgraded from level two, low quality, to level two, mid-quality? But to his slight surprise, the upper limit of spiritual energy his body could afford had increased by 10 points, though he had only upgraded his spiritual heritage and hadn\u2019t continued to strengthen his body with the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing yet.\u201cCan it still be upgraded?\u201dHan Fei clicked open \u2018Upgrade Spiritual Heritage\u2019 again, only to find that the spiritual energy was still 10,000 points. He suddenly understood that the so-called upgrade didn\u2019t mean the upgrade of level but of quality.But it made sense. If spiritual heritage could be upgraded to level three with merely 10,000 points of spiritual energy, then it wouldn\u2019t take long for him to upgrade his spiritual heritage to level seven. Sure enough, there were still restrictions. Otherwise, it would be upgraded too fast.Upgrade.Han Fei chose to upgrade again without hesitation. Then he repeated exactly the same process as before.: Han Fei: Seven (Advanced Fisher): 22892 (319): Level Two, High Quality (Upgradable): Twin Yin-Yang Spirit Swallowing Fishes: Purple Bamboo Rod: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)\u2026\u201cCan it be upgraded again?\u201dHan Fei continued to click it open but frowned. This time, it needed 20,000 points of spiritual energy. Then wouldn\u2019t his spiritual energy be all consumed?After thinking about it, Han Fei didn\u2019t choose to upgrade immediately. After all, he still needed to make a breakthrough. Once he chose to upgrade his spiritual heritage, he wouldn\u2019t have enough spiritual energy left for the breakthrough.But he didn\u2019t choose to make a breakthrough either. After all, his spiritual heritage had been upgraded to level two, high quality. Did that mean that his upper limit of spiritual energy had also increased?So he began to practice the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing.Three hours later, Han Fei had sweat all over his body and found that his upper limit of spiritual energy had reached 326 points. So it could really continue to increase. Han Fei was overjoyed. It was said that a reserve of 300 points or more was the amount of spiritual energy that only a fishing master could possess.Two days later, Han Fei walked out of the cave.Seeing that now he only had 8200 points of spiritual energy left, Han Fei felt his heart ache. The upgrading consumed too much spiritual energy. Upgrading to level-eight fisher had cost him more than 10,000 points of spiritual energy. Then what about upgrading to level nine? Or even to a fishing master? And what about the improvement of spiritual heritage? Han Fei sighed. He would have to work at the barbecue stall again.Han Fei wasn\u2019t disappointed though. After all, he may have done what others could only do for a few months or even a few years in one night as his upper limit had been raised to 359 points. Others needed to work slowly and attract spiritual energy to strengthen their bodies, whereas he made it straight to the peak of level eight. Although more than 10,000 points of spiritual energy was a lot, it laid a solid foundation for him. Now he just needed to accumulate spiritual energy, secure his foundation, and continue to make a breakthrough when his spiritual energy was sufficient.Han Fei suddenly remembered that he had promised the old man in the plantation to help him with his work and he would have broken his promise if he didn\u2019t do it now. After all, the Awakening Rituals had passed for several days now.So Han Fei picked up a jar of liquor and went to the plantation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: Five Major Professions\u201cGrandpa, I brought you some liquor.\u201d\u201cI can hear you! Don\u2019t make such a fuss. Don\u2019t you know you aren\u2019t supposed to wake up a sleeping old man?\u201dHan Fei pretended not to hear him and retorted, \u201cIf you really want to sleep, I won\u2019t bother you. I hurried here to help you with the plantation as soon as the spiritual beast awakening ended.\u201dThe old man took the liquor jar naturally, opened the lid, and sniffed. Then he moved his beard aside, picked up a grilled fish, and began to eat.The old man asked, \u201cBoy, I heard that you won first place in the Fishing Trial?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe old man went on asking, \u201cI heard that the angel gave you the Spirit Concentration Art, right? But you only got a Spirit Swallowing Fish as your spiritual beast? That thing can only be used for soup.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cYou sleep every day. Where\u2019d you hear the news?\u201dThe old man answered, \u201cFrom that fatty.\u201dHan Fei knew he meant Li Gang, who was responsible for delivering liquor and barbecue to the old man a while ago.However, Han Fei shook his head and said, \u201cMy fish is the Number One Spirit Swallowing Fish in the Infinite Ocean. It\u2019s a fish with ideals and goals.\u201d\u201cPu\u2026\u201dThe old man almost choked and he ridiculed, \u201cIt\u2019s just a Spirit Swallowing Fish. Number One Spirit Swallowing Fish in the Infinite Ocean? Are you kidding me?\u201dHan Fei shrugged.\u00a0I won\u2019t argue with you about this. When I shoot to fame one day, you\u2019ll know how awesome my Twin Yin-Yang Spirit Swallowing Fishes are.The old man took two sips of liquor and put down the jar. \u201cIn fact, you\u2019re not normally qualified to help me with the plantation, but since you\u2019ve got the Spirit Concentration Art, you\u2019re just barely qualified. From now on, the 1,000 acres of the plantation will be handed over to you. Don\u2019t forget to turn the soil, weed, sow seeds, water the plants, and gather spiritual energy\u2026 Well, that\u2019s all.\u201dHan Fei was stunned as he looked at the seemingly endless plantation dumbfounded. \u201cGrandpa, I would like to ask who turned the soil, weeded, sowed seeds, watered the plants, and gathered spiritual energy before? And what is \u2018gathering spiritual energy\u2019 about?\u201dThe old man hummed. \u201cI just let them grow on their own before and would pick a few red fruits when I was thirsty\u2026 As for gathering spiritual energy, the fields need to be fertilized and spiritual energy is the fertilizer. If you don\u2019t gather spiritual energy with Spirit Concentration Art, do you think spiritual energy will drill into the fields by itself?\u201dHan Fei: \u201c\u2026\u201dHan Fei questioned further, \u201cSo you mean you just let the plants grow by themselves before, but now I need to do all these jobs after the plants are handed over to me?\u201dThe old man tilted his head. \u201cYes, are you not willing to take them over?\u201dHan Fei wanted to hit this old man\u2019s head with an Iron-Headed Fish.\u00a0I\u2019ve never done these damn chores before. And now you want me to do them all of a sudden?\u201cFine! Of course I\u2019m willing to, but Grandpa, I haven\u2019t learned Spirit Concentration Art yet!\u201dThe old man said, \u201cThen learn it! Or else why did the angel bother to give it to you?\u201dHan Fei\u2019s eyelids twitched. This old man sounded so arrogant and showed no respect to the angel when he talked about him. Just as he guessed, this old man must be a recluse bigshot.\u201cGrandpa\u2026 I can\u2019t keep calling you Grandpa\u2026 Can you tell me your name? It\u2019ll be more convenient for me,\u201d Han Fei asked.The old man sneered, \u201cF*ck off. You\u2019re just my worker. Why do you need to know your boss\u2019s name?\u201dHan Fei: \u201c\u2026\u201dHan Fei nodded. \u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll just call you Grandpa. You\u2019re the boss. You call the shots.\u201dHe turned around, only to see the thousands of acres of plantation and he almost blacked out.\u201cForget it, it\u2019s too troublesome to till the land. I\u2019ll learn the Spirit Concentration Art first!\u201d\u2026The old man, drinking and eating barbecue and occasionally peanuts, looked so aloof. Han Fei could only find a random place to sit down and begin to read the jade slip Fang Ze gave to him.Han Fei was attracted to the book at first glance because what was introduced in the beginning of the book was not Spirit Concentration Art but the five major professions on the floating island.The five major professions were the only way to become a strong man. Almost every fishing master started from studying the five major professions. In the town, many fisher-level students had begun to study the five major professions.The five major professions were respectively:A spirit gatherer who could continuously draw spiritual energy from the world. On the battlefield, whoever had the best spirit gatherer would have the initiative in their hands. A spirit gatherer could not only gather spiritual energy, but also set up a matrix. During the battle, a spirit gatherer could continuously convey spiritual energy to companions and play a pivotal role.A soul warrior was a battle-oriented profession. Compared to the other four major professions, a soul warrior had the strongest combat power. Countless people scrambled to become a soul warrior because they usually had the best weapons and most skills.A manipulator, which was difficult to become, who owned spiritual plants instead of ordinary spiritual beasts. They could control spiritual plants and even mimic creatures with spiritual energy, with which they acquire combat power.A hunter, with strong mental power and explosive power. It was also difficult to be a hunter. They were kings of assassination and usually only practiced the strongest and most deadly combat skills. Hunters\u2019 enemies could hardly survive the first round of a fight with them.Being an armorist required lots of equipment. They needed a variety of weapons for both attacking and defending. If they were in a team, they would be responsible for the equipment supply. Most importantly, armorists were physically the strongest, best in defense, and usually the richest in the five major professions. Each armorist was a master of physical training.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dWhen Han Fei read this part, he took a deep breath. Are these the five major professions? Each of them look awesome!Han Fei remembered the armorist of the Wang Family and Wang Baiyu, who he met during the Fishing Trial. They both had a box with them. Was that box used for containing weapons? Yes, when he fought him that day, he saw two cold flashes as two swords came out. In the Heavenly Water Village where everyone used sticks, if you used a sword, it showed that you were very different and very strong.It was a pity that what was written on Fang Ze\u2019s jade slip was merely a general introduction that didn\u2019t analyze the pros and cons of each profession specifically, nor did it make clear which profession was the best. Perhaps it was because it was hard to choose the best one.Han Fei continued to read and the following was about the cultivation methods of a spirit gatherer.If you wanted to become a spirit gatherer, you must have a high degree of control over spiritual energy. You must be able to freely mobilize and use spiritual energy in your own body; only then can you mobilize spiritual energy outside.Of course, this didn\u2019t mean that a spirit gatherer could endlessly absorb spiritual energy from the world. If the spiritual energy in the world was all yours, you could even become a sea god! A spirit gatherer must pay a price every time he practiced Spirit Concentration Art. It required the spirit gatherer\u2019s physical energy and mental energy and would consume his spiritual energy. Of course, as a spirit gatherer could absorb spiritual energy from the world, no one would take their consumed spiritual energy seriously.That was to say, a spirit gatherer was not omnipotent as they had their limits. If the overall consumption was too large, they had to rest. And at this time, they were most vulnerable and could be easily killed by others.Of course, what a spirit gatherer was capable of was not only Spirit Concentration Art, but also many other skills, such as gathering cloud rain, summoning gusts of wind, and some powerful spirit gatherers could even summon thunderbolts from the Ninth Heaven. However, Han Fei, a weak newbie who hadn\u2019t yet started, didn\u2019t have much to worry about. For now, he could only learn the simplest spirit gathering skills.Following the instructions on the jade slip, everyone could feel the spiritual points in their own bodies which could be controlled. And the first thing Han Fei was going to do was split these spiritual points and prevent them from jumbling together in his body, which could also improve the efficiency of spiritual energy used.Reading the jade slip, Han Fei began to practice.Spiritual energy balls were not difficult to find. They gathered in his Dantian but in Han Fei\u2019s eyes, they were intertwined. He tried to mobilize them but as soon as he tried, dozens of spiritual points danced simultaneously, so he pulled these dozens of spiritual points all over his body with his thoughts.To the old man, in Han Fei\u2019s body, a cloud of gas ran from his forehead to his chest; then to his arms and finally ending in the legs.\u201cAre you an idiot? Can\u2019t you just make them stop and carefully pull one point out? The rest of the spiritual energy will go back by itself.\u201dAlthough Han Fei had closed his eyes, he could still hear. Hearing the old man\u2019s words, he was amazed.\u00a0What? The spiritual energy can go back by itself?So Han Fei quickly made the spiritual energy stop. Sure enough, as soon as it stopped, they tried to run back. At this time, Han Fei fixed onto one spiritual point and the spiritual energy ball immediately shrank in half. Then Han Fei carefully repeated this process over and over again. As sweat trickled down his forehead, he finally managed to separate a spiritual energy ball containing four or five spiritual points.In the end, however, maybe the traction force wasn\u2019t enough. As soon as he wasn\u2019t concentrated enough, the four or five spiritual points started running back and Han Fei\u2019s mind quickly chased behind them.As a result, when his mind finally caught up to them, they were already in his Dantian and the four or five spiritual points formed a mass like raindrops falling into the sea.Little did he know, the old man was watching him while drinking outside, nodding from time to time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: Spiritual Beast UpgradedDuring the night, the moon was clear and stars were sparse, and in the plantation, only the wind could be heard.Han Fei was still struggling to control the spiritual energy in his body, but he gradually mastered the new skills. Now he could succeed five or six times out of ten attempts and his speed was much faster than the first time.The old man could see that this lad was so immersed in building his skills that he was completely free from outside interference. He was simply a born spirit gatherer.\u201cAre you sure you want him to manage such a large plantation by himself?\u201dIf Han Fei was sober at the time, he would have found a person he knew very well standing next to the old man, Jiang Qin, the registrar from the port.The old man said, \u201cHe asked for it. I didn\u2019t ask him to come.\u201dJiang Qin questioned further, \u201cPerhaps he has a certain talent for spirit gathering, but does he have a talent for alchemy?\u201dThe old man answered, \u201cI don\u2019t see it that way. This brat has a very good ability for control. This kind of person usually has good alchemy and refinery skills too. Of course, I just gave him a chance. Let\u2019s see how long it will take him to familiarize himself with the thousand kinds of useless spiritual fruits in this low-level plantation. I don\u2019t expect him to become an alchemist. Let him take his chance. If he succeeds, I\u2019ll recommend him to the plantation in town with hundreds of thousands of acres and tens of thousands of different spiritual fruits. What if he can make a difference?\u201dJiang Qin was silent for a moment. \u201cI think he can become a soul warrior. He survived so many small fish tides, indicating that he has certain combat ability. In the Fishing Trial, he beat Li Hu and Xia Wushuang with low level spiritual heritage, which further proves this.\u201dThe old man sneered, \u201cNonsense! What\u2019s the point of fighting and killing? Can ten soul warriors put together beat one spirit gatherer?\u201dJiang Qin said after a short pause, \u201cI don\u2019t care what he will become! I\u2019m just wondering why he upgrades so fast. If the spiritual heritage test wasn\u2019t wrong, it must be because he has some sort of chance.\u201dThe old man said, \u201cHe is good at body tempering, far better than his peers and even better than the Heavenly Talents in the town. The opportunity he got should be about body tempering.\u201d\u2026In the morning.The old man was still sleeping but someone kept exclaiming, \u201cWow! Wow! Wow!\u201d\u201cShut up, brat.\u201dHan Fei grinned. \u201cGrandpa, I made it. Look\u2026\u201dHan Fei stood still and about seven or eight seconds later, a spiritual point was gathered at his fingertip. He laughed triumphantly.The old man rolled his eyes. \u201cYou spent a whole night just learning to separate spiritual energy? What a disgrace it took you so long!\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dHan Fei asked timidly, \u201cGrandpa, how long is it supposed to take?\u201dThe old man said with a straight face, \u201cWhen you shorten the time to about a second, you\u2019re close to success. A real spirit gatherer can mobilize spiritual energy with his thoughts and doesn\u2019t even need a second.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dHan Fei tilted his head. \u201cGrandpa, it\u2019s just a matter of practice. Practice makes perfect.\u201d\u201cThen practice,\u201d the old man encouraged.Han Fei: \u201c\u2026\u201dHan Fei scratched his head and thought to himself, Is it so difficult to be a spirit gatherer? It\u2019s surely difficult to separate spiritual points in an instant!Alright. This old man seems to be a big shot. Let me just do what he said!Han Fei sat down again.\u2026Han Fei laughed out loud. \u201cGrandpa, I succeeded. Hahaha! I\u2019m a genius\u2026 Grandpa, I made it.\u201dAs Han Fei raised his hand, a spiritual point fluttered on his fingertip.The old man said grumpily, \u201cStop calling me Grandpa. I\u2019m not your Grandpa. Genius my ass! It took you so long to separate a spiritual point within standard time. Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019ve even drank all my liquor? Hurry and get me some more\u2026\u201dHan Fei: \u201c\u2026\u201dHan Fei muttered as he went out, \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with this old guy? Although it took me some time, I still succeeded!\u201dHan Fei didn\u2019t know that soon after he walked away, the old man quickly took a mouthful of liquor to calm down. He was shocked. Does this brat have such a great aptitude for spirit gathering? How long did it take him to separate spiritual points? It seemed to be half a year!\u2026In the \u2018Most Delicious in the World\u2019 barbecue stall.Li Gang and his wife had completely become barbecue masters, so their barbecue stall was still very busy. Although many people lost interest in barbecue after tasting it, they could still sell half as much as before.Seeing Han Fei coming to help, Li Gang quickly said, \u201cOh, Young Master, we will do this ourselves. How can we trouble you to do it?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. Go about your business. I\u2019m here to feed fish!\u201dLi Gang looked puzzled.With a twinkle of light between Han Fei\u2019s brow, the Twin Yin-Yang Spirit Swallowing Fishes appeared. Of course, Li Gang could only see the white one.Li Gang\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cYoung Master, do Spirit Swallowing Fish eat these fish? Aren\u2019t they supposed to eat spiritual energy?\u201dHan Fei turned his eyes to him. \u201cHuh?\u201dLi Gang\u2019s words reminded him. Yes! Spirit Swallowing Fish eat spiritual energy! Why the hell do I feed them fish?Dozens of spiritual points immediately appeared on Han Fei\u2019s fingertips and he moved his fingers to the fishes, only to see Xiaobai quickly swim over and swallow them in one bite.As I guessed, Little White likes eating spiritual energy, but I don\u2019t know how much I should feed him in a day. Come eat some, Little Black.However, Han Fei discovered that Little Black didn\u2019t eat his spiritual energy at all. Instead, he swam into the fishes and soon a fishbone appeared in the bucket.Oh! Little White eats spiritual energy but Little Black doesn\u2019t?Questions kept popping up in Han Fei\u2019s head, as after he checked the data, he realized that the two fishes should have two sets of data but there was only one. So what does \u2018twin fishes\u2019 mean? Can spiritual energy be shared by the two fishes? If either one is full, the other won\u2019t be hungry?With these thoughts, Han Fei quickly took Little Black out of the bucket while the spiritual energy from his fingertips was constantly supplying Little White.100\u2026 200\u2026 500\u2026 800 points\u2026Han Fei\u2019s face was all dark. Well aren\u2019t you a f*cking pig! Do you think spiritual energy is for free? It\u2019s been only a few minutes and you\u2019ve eaten 800 points of spiritual energy, you little foodie.When Little White ate as much as 1000 points of spiritual energy, he stopped. Then as a light flashed across his surface, he seemed to grow up a little bit, which could hardly be detected.Han Fei immediately looked at the data.Spiritual BeastTwin Yin-Yang Spirit Swallowing FishesThey\u2019re the descendants of the mysterious primitive Yin-Yang Sky-Swallowing Fish. The black and white fish accompany each other. The white fish is docile, whereas the black one is cruel. They are symbiotic. As long as one lives, the other doesn\u2019t die.OneMysterious100 pointsOmnivorous. They can swallow everything.[Note] The black fish is not visible. Except for the owner, only people with naturally-born Yin-Yang Divine Eyes can see it.\u201cDamn\u2026\u201dLi Gang stuck his head out from the barbecue booth. \u201cYoung Master, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dHan Fei said, \u201cUh, nothing. You may do your own work.\u201dHan Fei didn\u2019t know what to say. He spent 1,000 points of spiritual energy to upgrade the fishes to level 1 and his spiritual energy reserve was cleared to zero! That\u2019s ridiculous! I\u2019m a human being, a big, strong man and I worked so hard to reach the upper limit for spiritual energy of 326 points. But now I feel as though I\u2019m good for nothing compared to this level-one fish.Although he was shocked, Han Fei still took Little White out, no longer feeding him spiritual energy, and then threw Little Black back into the bucket. It just swam in the bucket, ignoring Yellow Fish, Little White Fish, and all others fishes.\u201cWow! Are you guys full?\u201dJust as Han Fei guessed, the two were actually one. If one was full, the other one would not be hungry.Han Fei was quite happy. Although he hadn\u2019t learned the other abilities of these two fish yet, he was glad to find out about their upgrading conditions and spiritual energy storage capacity.After Han Fei refilled the 1000 points of spiritual energy he had lost, he headed for the plantation carrying barbecue and liquor.\u2026Han Fei asked, \u201cGrandpa, do you think I can go check those spiritual fruits now?\u201dThe old man was impatient. \u201cWhy are you in such a hurry? Learn to walk before you run. Can you absorb spiritual energy drifting in the air? Give it a try.\u201dHan Fei asked this with a purpose. He actually wanted to plant the fruits into \u201cForge the Universe.\u201d Why? It was convenient for him to pick fruits directly from \u201cForge the Universe\u201d in the future so that he could eat spiritual fruits for free! Then he wouldn\u2019t have to work in the damned plantation anymore.In fact, he had done so already, throwing in condiments such as garlic, chili, ginger, etc.. Unfortunately, they hadn\u2019t sprouted yet, and he didn\u2019t know if they could.After being scolded by the old man, Han Fei could only continue his cultivation pitifully.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: Birth of a GeniusHan Fei spent four days learning to manipulate spiritual energy in his body. He thought he had just passed this first step.This time he was learning how to guide the spiritual points drifting in the outside world, which was a bit more difficult. This was a spirit gathering skill for beginners and he continued to read the jade slip to learn how.It was written on the jade slip that there was a vast amount of spiritual energy between the heavens and earth, that the spiritual energy was invisible but drifting around us at all times, and what a spirit gatherer needed to do was to capture and control it.At first, Han Fei felt that this was like practicing Void Fishing, drawing the spiritual energy between the heavens and earth into his body, but he felt it was not the same thing after he tried it. The function of Void Fishing was to absorb the spiritual energy into one\u2019s own body and nourish the body, so as to strengthen one\u2019s body. But Spirit Concentration Art was a different case. A spirit gatherer could send the spiritual energy he captured to other people\u2019s bodies, which was different in nature from the former.The first step to capture these spiritual points was to see them, which was the first thing a spirit gatherer had to learn. Thus, all spirit gatherers had to practice a technique about eyes, which was called Pupil Spell.Pupil Spell was universal to all spirit gatherers, so there was no one stronger than anyone else because the spell\u2019s only function was to see spiritual energy.Therefore, when Han Fei was reading the contents about Pupil Spell, the sign of technique upgrade appeared in the system.(Incomplete): \u201cThe Eyes of True Vision\u201d: A universal pupil spell used by ancient spirit gatherers. As time went by, it had been incomplete, and it took 10,000 points of spiritual energy to get the complete version.Han Fei almost cried when he saw this note.\u00a0This is just a minor spell to see spiritual energy, but it actually requires 10,000 points to get the complete version? Although it may be a once-for-all cost, isn\u2019t that expensive? Now, all the spiritual energy I have is only 8200 points\u2026Not long after Han Fei sat down, he was scared.\u201cGrandpa, I\u2019m going to take two days off.\u201dThe old man gave him a stare. \u201cWhat? You just got here several minutes ago and now you\u2019re asking for leave?\u201d\u201cI suddenly remembered that I have something urgent to tend to, so I have to go. I will bring you some good liquor and barbecue when I\u2019m back.\u201dWith that, Han Fei slipped away like a ghost.To Han Fei\u2019s frustration, although he was still so far away from being a fishing master, his spiritual energy was being spent like water! He could hardly make ends meet now! Even a minor auxiliary Pupil Spell cost him 10,000 points of spiritual energy. Then how much would he have to spend to be a fishing master?\u2026Li Gang was busy grilling meat, and Little Red wiped the sweat from his face from time to time. The couple looked so sweet together. Since Li Gang quit the Tigers, he had completely changed and was a family man now.Li Gang raised his head and found that Han Fei was back.Li Gang was surprised. \u201cYoung Master, were you driven out?\u201dHan Fei sneered, \u201cHaha, how could I possibly be driven out? I can go to a place like the plantation any time I\u2019d like. I just felt a little bored over there, so I\u2019m going to stay at the barbecue stall for two days.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you bored processing fish at the barbecue stall?\u201d\u201c\u2026Shut up.\u201dHan Fei was speechless. Why is this big guy so stupid he cannot just let things slide!Han Fei had considered going to the sea for fish tides, but after giving it a second thought, he thought it was too troublesome! It was quicker to earn spiritual energy to process fish at the barbecue stall! Although the barbecue wasn\u2019t as popular it used to be, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for him to get 10,000 or so points of spiritual energy in two days.Soon, two days passed by. Being tortured by the fishy odor, Han Fei swore he would never ever come to process fish again if he found an easier way to earn spiritual energy. Wang Jie and He Mingtang came to buy barbecue every night. Every time they saw him, they would ask him questions and nag him, \u201cHan Fei, how\u2019s your cultivation going recently? Han Fei, the village leader is arranging jobs for graduates. Don\u2019t slack off\u2026 Han Fei, grilling fish here every day will get you nowhere! Han Fei, have you given up on yourself?\u201dHan Fei was afraid to see He Mingtang and Wang Jie now. These two bastards were such nags. The old man was much better than them. He was busy drinking and eating barbecue all day long and never bothered him unless he came to him first.As soon as he had accumulated 20,000 points of spiritual energy, Han Fei immediately upgraded his Spiritual Pupils.(Ultra Quality): \u201cThe Eyes of True Vision\u201d: A universal pupil spell used by ancient spirit gatherers, with which one can easily find the drifting spiritual points between the heavens and earth.The technique was easy to use and cost Han Fei very little to acquire it. According to the instructions on how to use the Eyes of True Vision, he just needed to cover his eyes with spiritual energy and then focus.So when Han Fei used the Eyes of True Vision for the first time, he discovered that the world was full of small spiritual points drifting around.\u2026\u2026The old man was sleeping.Han Fei said, \u201cGrandpa, I\u2019ve brought you liquor and barbecue. May I put them on the table?\u201dThe old man hummed. \u201cOkay!\u201dThen, silently, he got up and began to drink and eat his barbecue while Han Fei sat casually on the ground and started to capture spiritual points.As soon as he opened the Eyes of True Vision, with a gagging sound, the old man squirted the liquor out of his mouth.Han Fei glanced back at him with a frown, as if blaming him for disturbing his cultivation.The old man was shocked!\u00a0Damn, what did I see? It\u2019s only been two days! Didn\u2019t the brat say he had something urgent to tend to? How did he come back with Spiritual Pupils?The old man began to recall how long it took him to get Spiritual Pupils. It seemed to be half a year. But this brat only used two days.\u00a0That\u2019s really unfair! Is his spiritual heritage really a low-quality one? I don\u2019t believe it!But when he saw that Han Fei was trying to capture the spiritual points in the air with his hands, he almost laughed out loud.\u00a0Is this brat a genius or an idiot? Capture spiritual energy with hands? Are you kidding me?\u00a0But the old man kept the thoughts to himself.\u00a0Since you\u2019re so quick to learn, then figure it out yourself!After trying a few times, Han Fei also felt it didn\u2019t work well. The spiritual energy was drifting around. Even if he caught some in his hands, they were gone as soon as he opened them. It was just like trying to capture air with hands and was not going to work.Han Fei continued to read the jade slip that said spiritual energy must be guided and he should mobilize the spiritual energy in his body to guide the spiritual points outside.So, Han Fei concentrated some spiritual energy in his body at his fingertips and tried to attract the spiritual points outside. Sure enough, it worked this time. Some spiritual points ran to Han Fei\u2019s fingertips, but there were too few of them and only five or six points. He tried dozens of times but didn\u2019t make much progress. Han Fei began to ponder,\u00a0As specified in the jade slip, a spirit gatherer needed to consume spiritual energy in spirit gathering, but just now he had only concentrated the spiritual energy in his body at his fingertips without consuming any of it!Then, Han Fei attracted some spiritual points to his fingertips and then held up his fingers to cover his fingers with spiritual energy. In an instant, spiritual points gathered up from all directions, which were as many as fifty or sixty.Han Fei was in a state of meditation now. As a person from a different world, he thought more than others.\u00a0Think about it, if I want to convey spiritual energy to others, are fifty or sixty spiritual points enough? It may be enough for fishers, but what about people above fisher-levels? Obviously not enough.Then what should I do in this case?\u00a0Han Fei \u2018s first idea was to export more spiritual points from his body, but then he found it would consume too much spiritual energy in this way.What should I do? What should I do? What should I do?Han Fei was completely immersed in deep thinking and could no longer perceive the outside world.Little did he know, however, the old man was dumbfounded. I\u2019ve given him no hint! How can he learn so fast?It was getting dark and Jiang Qin came over. Seeing Han Fei sitting on the ground pointing his fingers to the sky, and that his fingertips were shining, she widened her eyes.Jiang Qin stammered, \u201cGrandpa, he\u2026 Has learned it?\u201dThe old man replied, \u201cHow can I know! He is still self-teaching, already fully immersed.\u201dJiang Qin took a deep breath. \u201cHow long did it take him?\u201dThe old man said grumpily, \u201cYou can count the days. It took him six days at most.\u201dJiang Qin exclaimed, \u201cI think he may be a genius spirit gatherer!\u201dThe next second, she saw a lot more spiritual points gathering at Han Fei\u2019s fingertips. Both she and the old man knew that this was definitely not the same spiritual energy in their bodies.Han Fei\u2019s heart was dancing with joy.\u00a0So that\u2019s what it is. Exchange the spiritual points in my body with those in the outside world. As this process goes along, I can export more spiritual points and at the same time attract more from the outside world.\u00a0Up to this moment, his fingertips had gathered at least two hundred spiritual points.Han Fei thought to himself,\u00a0What\u2019s the next step? To transfer these spiritual points to other people\u2019s bodies?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: Digging the GroundHan Fei only had a moment\u2019s thought before he had an idea about how to transfer spiritual energy into other people\u2019s bodies.Since fishers could transmit spiritual energy to the fishing line, make it expand and contract and thus set the fishing hook in motion, he could learn from this method. He had been practicing Hook Kiss for so long and certainly knew how to do it.So Han Fei got up and looked at the old man. As he pointed a finger at him, a light entered into the old man\u2019s body.Eh! There\u2019s someone next to him!Han Fei didn\u2019t notice who this person was, but an idea soon occurred to him. What if I convey spiritual energy to more than one person at the same time?So Han Fei held up his left hand and in an instant, with a flash on his fingertips, a light also entered Jiang Qin\u2019s body.BAM\u2026The liquor jar in the old man\u2019s hand fell to the ground. Jiang Qin widened her eyes and a curious look appeared on her serious face.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the spiritual energy disappeared abruptly and Han Fei laughed wildly. He pointed to the old man and said, \u201cGrandpa, did you see that? I told you I was a genius! I made it. I made it! Hahaha\u2026\u201dHan Fei waited for the old man to praise him. After quite a while, however, the old man remained silent. Then he noticed that there was a person standing next to the old man.\u201cHi! Sister Qin.\u201dJiang Qin nodded slightly. \u201cHan Fei, how did you just do that?\u201dHan Fei was confused. \u201cHuh? What?\u201dJiang Qin wanted to understand what had happened. \u201cThe last step, the step where you transfered spiritual energy to our bodies.\u201dHan Fei replied, \u201cI did it just like fishing! Don\u2019t you just throw the fishing line out with a whoosh in fishing?\u201dThe old man: \u201c\u2026\u201dJiang Qin: \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter a long time, Jiang Qin muttered, \u201cHe\u2019s a genius, undoubtedly.\u201dThe old man swallowed. \u201cDon\u2019t show off. I learned all this in a day when I was young. How long did it take you? Six days! How do you have a face to show off?\u201dHan Fei scratched his head and Jiang Qin rolled her eyes as she thought,\u00a0Fine, I won\u2019t debunk you. Just keep on bragging!Han Fei asked, \u201cSister Qin, why are you here?\u201dJiang Qin smiled. \u201cBecause my home is here!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHan Fei was startled, clutching his chest and pointing at the old man, saying, \u201cYou, you\u2026 Grandpa, is Sister Qin your wife?!\u201d\u201cPa\u2026\u201dA prawn was thrown at Han Fei\u2019s face and the old man scolded, \u201cWhat are you talking about?! She is my granddaughter.\u201dSeeing Jiang Qin\u2019s face darkened, Han Fei hurriedly ran to the fields. \u201cOh, I see! Sorry\u2026 I\u2019m going to find a place to sleep.\u201dThe old man scrunched his face. \u201cSleep? Which cultivator have you seen sleeping?\u201d\u201cThen I, I\u2026 I\u2019m going to cultivate in seclusion.\u201dThe old man scolded, \u201cF*ck off. Why do you, an insignificant fisher, need to cultivate in seclusion?\u201dAfter Han Fei slipped away, Jiang Qin said with a smile, \u201cGrandpa, you seem to get along well with this guy!\u201dThe old man said grumpily, \u201cGet along well with him? He is so much younger than me! If it weren\u2019t for the liquor and delicious barbecue he brings me, I would have thrown him out.\u201dJiang Qin smiled. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want him, why not give him to me? I think he might also be talented in becoming a soul warrior.\u201d\u201cNo way! How can I let a born spirit gatherer become a soul warrior? Do you think I\u2019m an idiot? Don\u2019t even think about it.\u201dJiang Qin chuckled. \u201cThen you\u2019ve gotta be careful. The village head is already arranging some students to study in the town. Han Fei offended the Tigers. Although Tang Ge left the Tigers to Han Fei as a whetstone, the village leader doesn\u2019t know it. He still believes that Han Fei is just relying on Tang Ge, so you must be careful. Otherwise, the village leader will bring him into town.\u201dThe old man waved his hand. \u201cYeah, yeah, I see\u2026\u201d\u2026The next day, when the old man got up, he suddenly found Han Fei squatting beside his bed.\u201cCough, cough\u2026 You little brat, what are you doing here? Don\u2019t you know you will scare me squatting beside me while I\u2019m sleeping?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that cultivators don\u2019t need to sleep?\u201d\u201c\u2026 How dare you talk back! Just stand here!\u201dIt didn\u2019t take long for the old man to come out of the house and throw a jade slip to Han Fei. \u201cTake it\u2026 I will give you half a month to learn the contents in this jade slip by heart.\u201dHan Fei didn\u2019t know what was in the jade slip. When he took it out and read it over, his face turned purple.\u00a0What the hell! This jade slip has recorded hundreds of thousands of different plants. It will take me half a lifetime to learn them by heart!Seeing Han Fei\u2019s expression, the old man laughed smugly. \u201cHaha, do you know how long it took me to memorize these contents? Only ten days! I\u2019ve given you more than enough time.\u201dJust then, Jiang Qin happened to walk past to go to work. When she heard the old man\u2019s words, she rolled her eyes and walked away. She still remembered when the old man gave this book to her, he said he wanted her to learn its contents by heart in three years and emphasized that he only used one year to memorize them. Now one year was changed to ten days? She really didn\u2019t want to admit this childish old man was her grandfather.Han Fei felt like he was going crazy. He wondered if it was too late for him to run away. He came here just because he had long guessed that this old man might be a recluse big shot, so he came here to see if he could ride on his coattails, but look what he was required to do!\u00a0Why do I have to hit the books even in this world?Watching Han Fei walk away desperately with the jade slip, the old man was cheerful.\u00a0Haha, well aren\u2019t you a genius? Just hit the books!\u2026In a corner, Han Fei opened the jade slip reluctantly, and then he was stunned.(Incomplete): \u201cA Complete Collection of Spiritual Plants in the Infinite Ocean\u201d: A complete collection of spiritual plants handed down from ancient times. Since time has gone by, it is now incomplete and takes 1,000 points of spiritual energy to get the completed version.Han Fei widened his eyes.\u00a0Are you kidding me? Can this book also be upgraded?Haha, it only needs 1,000 points of spiritual energy! Oh, right, it\u2019s not a cultivation technique, so it doesn\u2019t require as much spiritual energy. Well\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t perform too well. Since the old man memorized this book in ten days, maybe I should do it in half a day?Han Fei shook his head.\u00a0No, no, that\u2019s too cruel for the old man. What about one day? Yes, one day is long enough, or else I\u2019ll have to find ways to kill time. Ok, I\u2019ll memorize it in one day.The next morning, dawn was just breaking.Jiang Qin went out to go to work as usual.The old man was sleeping as usual.Han Fei squatted beside the old man\u2019s bed as usual.When the old man woke up, he scolded, \u201cYou damn brat, I told you not to do this again! Were you deaf?\u201d\u201cGrandpa, I\u2019ve memorized the contents of this book!\u201d\u201cWhat? What do you mean\u2026 Do\u2026 Do you mean you\u2019ve memorized the contents of the Encyclopedia of Spiritual Plants?\u201dJiang Qin retracted her foot that had just stepped out of the door and looked stunned.\u00a0Are you serious? Are you a monster?The old man shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me. It\u2019s only been a day.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not lying. I\u2019m gifted with an extraordinary memory.\u201dThe old man just wanted to slap him.\u00a0Damn you! Damn your extraordinary memory! I said ten days. Why did you do it in a single day? I would have felt better if you could accomplish it in nine days!But on the surface, the old man just said calmly, \u201cWell, let me test you!\u201d\u201cTriple-Leaf Purple Night Flower, tell me about it.\u201dHan Fei answered fluently, \u201cThree-Leaf Purple Night Flower, a spiritual plant that is good at ensnaring prey and grows on the bottom of the sea. It usually coexists with Triple-Head Purple Night Fish. But when any fish wants to eat it, Triple-Head Purple Night Fish will swallow it in one bite. Triple-Leaf Purple Night Flower can ingest the essence from the heads of Triple-Head Purple Night Fish, so if it\u2019s used to refine medicine, it can attract spiritual energy of the outside world and increase the success rate by 30% when a fishing master makes the breakthrough to become a great fishing master.\u201dJiang Qin was dumbfounded and the old man was still struggling. \u201cThen tell me about Qianqiao Fruit.\u201dHan Fei recited, \u201cQianqiao Fruit is usually born in sea anemone bushes in the fisheries above level two. When anemones eat too much, the indigestible substances produced by them will be excreted in one place, and as time goes by, Qianqiao Fruit will be produced there, but this plant contains highly toxic substances, and ordinary people may vomit blood and die if touching it. However, if it\u2019s taken together with Coral Fruit, its toxicity will be assimilated. It can be used to build up a body immunity to poison.\u201dThe old man asked seven or eight questions in a row and Han Fei answered fluently at a stretch, which almost drove the old man crazy. Both he and Jiang Qin were thinking,\u00a0Shouldn\u2019t this guy be taken to the city? Why did the stupid Fang Ze fail to find out about this boy\u2019s talents?Jiang Qin left with shining eyes.The old man didn\u2019t continue with the test. He had a feeling that if he went on, he might die in shock and he didn\u2019t want to die that way.So the old man simply said to Han Fei, \u201cGo dig the ground.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: Beating the Village LeaderHan Fei\u2019s face turned purple.\u00a0I can cheat in reciting books but how can I cheat in digging?Of course, \u2018digging the ground\u2019 wasn\u2019t its literal meaning. Han Fei needed to weed the thousands of acres of land in the plantation first, which was a ponderous job. Although he was a cultivator, it still took him three days to do this job and another three days to turn the soil for arable land.Seven days later.Han Fei asked, \u201cGrandpa, so I should start tilling the land now?\u201dThe old man replied, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not time yet. Since you\u2019ve learned the Encyclopedia of Spiritual Plants by heart, trim all the spiritual plants in the plantation first.\u201cWhat?\u201dHan Fei almost cried. \u201cGrandpa, you can\u2019t bully me like this! Will trimming the spiritual plants help my cultivation?\u201dThe old man smiled. \u201cSure. You need to feel the natural beauty of spiritual plants intuitively so that you\u2019ll have a good mood for tilling the land.\u201dHan Fei, \u201cUhhhh\u201dHan Fei thought to himself,\u00a0I don\u2019t know if spiritual plants are beautiful or not. What I know is that I\u2019m in a bad mood. Do you know how much spare time I sacrificed to till the land? Now you want me to prune flowers and plants? Are you kidding me?Ten days after Han Fei learned Spirit Concentration Art, he finally started to till the land. It didn\u2019t matter what kinds of spiritual plants grew. What mattered was the effect of Spirit Concentration Art on the growth of plants after they were planted.Han Fei planted a field of roses, a field of garlic, and a field of strawberries as a test. He had planned to grow wheat or rice but he didn\u2019t find them, so he had to give up.Han Fei could apply Spirit Gathering Art very well now. After sending spiritual points drifting outside into the land, he was faced with another problem: how to apply Spirit Gathering Art over all the fields.The old man didn\u2019t give him any hints. Han Fei\u2019s first idea was to send a cloud of spiritual energy over the land, but the spiritual energy exploded and blew a big hole in the ground.But this time, the old man didn\u2019t laugh. In fact, Han Fei\u2019s logic was correct and even very precise, which showed that he was really a genius. Han Fei also found that although a hole was blown up in the ground, there were spiritual plants sprouting in places that hadn\u2019t been bombarded.\u201cI\u2019ve got it! The spiritual energy explosion originated from the non-dead-corner explosion from a central point. If I can control the spiritual energy to spread only laterally, it won\u2019t explode!\u201dAfter dozens of experiments and explosions, Han Fei finally managed to control the spiritual energy, so tilling land could actually improve his ability to control spiritual energy, which was really a useful experience for him.\u2026One day, Han Fei had gained some experience with spiritual energy explosions and was about to try it again when the village leader suddenly came to the plantation.As soon as the village leader came in, he saw the old man drinking and eating barbecue. He sniffed and ignored the old man, calling straight to Han Fei standing in the ground. \u201cHan Fei, come here.\u201dHan Fei ran over covered with mud. \u201cLeader, what can I do for you?\u201dThe village leader is the leader of the Heavenly Water Village. If it weren\u2019t for the Fishing Trial, he wouldn\u2019t have even remembered me. Why has he come to me here?The village leader said, \u201cHan Fei, our village wants to select some outstanding students to study in the town where there are better schools. Although the selected student can only be auditors temporarily, it\u2019s still a great chance. I specially reserved a place for you. Hurry up, go back home to pack and get ready for setting off!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHan Fei scratched his head, glanced back at the land he hadn\u2019t finished tilling and thought about it. \u201cWhat can auditors learn?\u201dThe village leader laughed. \u201cThe schools in the town are not the same as those in the village. That\u2019s where elites stay. You just have to stay there for three years and then you can learn about the five major professions or even get started. Do you know what the five major professions are? Let me tell you\u2026\u201dHan Fei looked blank. He pointed a finger at the village leader and a string of spiritual energy was sent into his body. \u201cLike this?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dThe village leader:\u201d???\u201dThe village leader looked at Han Fei stunned and then looked at the old man whose mouth was slightly curved in a smile. He stuttered, \u201cSpirit\u2026 Spirit gatherer?\u201dHan Fei said seriously, \u201cLeader, if I have to be in the town for three years just to learn about the five major professions, then I\u2019d rather not go. Recently, I find farming particularly interesting and I plan to continue to study in the Heavenly Water Village. When I go to the town one day, I\u2019ll startle them with what I\u2019m capable of.\u201dThe village leader: \u201c???\u201d\u201cStudy? Do you mean farming?\u201dThe old man on the side suddenly pounded the table and jumped to his feet, throwing a prawn at the face of the village leader. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with farming? Do you have a problem with farming?\u201dThe village head frowned. \u201cOld Jiang, you gotta show me some respect. The chance to go to town is something that many young people are desperate for. Han Fei has a great gift for being a spirit gatherer. How can you just keep him here farming? What else can your spiritual fruits be used for, besides being able to make some barbecue? \u201dThe old man\u2019s face darkened. \u201cDo you despise planting spiritual fruits? Big-Headed Zhao, you ignorant idiot! The Dao of spiritual fruits planting will bring you life-long benefits. That\u2019ll be a waste of his time to be an auditor in the town for three years! Was your head hit by an Iron-Head Fish?\u201dThe village leader yelled, \u201cDon\u2019t call me idiot, you idiot! The Dao of spiritual fruits planting? Why didn\u2019t I see you grow a single piece of spirit fruit? If it weren\u2019t for the fact that every hanging island needs someone to study spiritual fruit, I would have flattened your plantation.\u201dThe old man immediately threw a Small White Fish at him. \u201cFlatten my plantation? Yes, in your dreams! I\u2019d like to see how you can flatten my plantation! Dare you shovel a piece of soil?\u201d\u201cLet me show you whether I dare or not. Do you think I\u2019m afraid of you?\u201dHan Fei couldn\u2019t get a word in as the two old men were too irritable. The quarrel between them soon escalated into a fight.They were getting angrier and angrier. As the village leader burst into a roar, his body suddenly bulged with muscles and he threw a punch at the old man.Han Fei was dumbfounded and couldn\u2019t believe what he saw. \u201cLeader, didn\u2019t you always tell us to be kind and get along with others?!\u201dThe old man didn\u2019t flinch at all. Casting a sardonic glance at the village leader, he reached out and grabbed in the air, and then a water shield appeared in front of him.BAm\u2026The water shield exploded and the two old men were both sprinkled with water all over. The village leader kept punching, forming a dragon shadow in the air. A fierce battle was imminent. The old man stood still, summoning a lot of water from the void, which turned into a chain and then into a whip.Han Fei was dumbfounded.\u00a0That\u2019s awesome. The old man looks so cool! He can actually grab anything out of the air as he wants, how eye-opening!Han Fei squatted on the ground not far away, watching the two of them fight.The village leader roared, \u201cOld Jiang, do you really think you can beat me?\u201dBuzz!\u00a0A cloud of spiritual energy appeared on the village leader\u2019s fist. Han Fei shivered when he saw the village leader initiate a spiritual energy explosion, which was an extremely terrifying force.But the old man just sneered, \u201cYou wanna play spiritual energy with me? Are you still in your dream?\u201dHe reached out and grabbed at the mass of spiritual energy, which immediately diffused and broke into spiritual points.After dozens of seconds, with a whoosh, the village leader was thrown out of the plantation.The old man pointed at the village leader and cursed, \u201cBig-Headed Zhao, who do you think you are?! If you dare to set your foot on my plantation again, I\u2019ll beat the hell out of you!\u201dThe village leader was very angry. \u201cYou damn farmer! I can\u2019t even communicate with you\u2026 Han Fei, I\u2019ve asked you to go to town for your own good. Since you have already started as a spiritual gatherer, you don\u2019t have to be an auditor. Besides, although Li Jue was almost disabled, it is possible for him to recover in advance. Think it over for yourself.\u201dHan Fei waved his hand in embarrassment.\u00a0Li Jue? It\u2019s only been half a month and Li Jue has shown signs of recovery?\u00a0He had thought that there was still a lot of time left for him. Now being reminded by the village leader, he realized that he wouldn\u2019t be able to spend all his time and effort on farming.Just now, Old Jiang showed great power in the battle when he grabbed water from the void and transformed it into any weapon he wanted. Was it a different skill of a spirit gatherer? If this was the case, a spirit gatherer was powerful indeed. He wanted to learn this skill.Old Jiang turned his head, watching Han Fei\u2019s expression changing, and asked grumpily, \u201cDid you change your mind?\u201dHan Fei shook his head. \u201cNo, but I think I have to take a few days off, Grandpa.\u201d\u201cOh? For what?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve felt signs of a breakthrough recently and I want to prepare for my breakthrough.\u201d\u201cCough, cough\u2026\u201dOld Jiang was speechless.\u00a0Didn\u2019t you just make a breakthrough not long ago? Why are you going to make another breakthrough so soon? Is a breakthrough as simple as eating and drinking for you?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ha, short-sighted bastard\u2026 Tang Ge has left now, no one knows whether he\u2019ll come back or not. Father, if we don\u2019t get rid of Han Fei now, we won\u2019t have another chance if he goes to town.\u201dA vicious gleam flickered in Li Hu\u2019s eyes. He had almost lost all of his force because of Han Fei. Although his force had restored by 70% or 80%, it would still take him at least a few months more to fully recover. Han Fei was the culprit of his sufferings. He certainly wouldn\u2019t let him off.Li Jue was also full of hatred. Because of Tang Ge, his strength had diminished by more than half. Now, even though he took various kinds of spiritual drugs every day, his injury hadn\u2019t recovered yet.Li Jue gnashed his teeth. \u201cHumph! Tang Ge wanted me to make the Tigers Han Fei\u2019s whetstone, but does Han Fei deserve it? How is a piece of junk, whose spiritual beast is a Spirit Swallowing Fish, worthy of treating me as a whetstone?\u201dLi Jue mused and said, \u201cHu\u2019er, bear with him for a few more days. The Tigers haven\u2019t recovered from this setback and are now outshone by the Wang Family. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that killing is not allowed on the floating island, I am afraid I might have been killed by them. Therefore, I must not leave the floating Island before I fully recover, so you\u2019ll be in charge of hunting Han Fei.\u201dLi Hu said, \u201cFather, I see. Please wait a few more days. When I recover, I\u2019ll watch for a proper moment to kill Han Fei at sea with our Tiger brothers.\u201d\u2026Han Fei had yet again gone to \u201cThe Most Delicious Barbecue Stall in the World\u201d.Li Gang asked, \u201cYoung Master, are you bored again?\u201dHan Fei rolled his eyes. \u201cCan\u2019t I come if I\u2019m not bored?\u201dLi Gang grinned. \u201cYou can come anytime!\u201dLi Gang and Xiao Hong once discussed privately why Han Fei always came here to process the fish as Li Gang thought Han Fei must have some indescribable feelings for these fish\u2026Han Fei summoned the Twin Yin-Yang Spirit Swallowing Fishes. The two little guys should start to upgrade.Before Han Fei started to feed them, however, he saw Little White spit out a cloud of spiritual energy. Han Fei looked around and then quickly drew the spiritual energy to his fingertips. But as soon as the cloud of spiritual energy came into contact with him, he widened his eyes.What pure spiritual energy.Han Fei felt comfortable all over, though this small cloud of spiritual energy was only 500 points.Han Fei wondered if there was something wrong with the two little fishes as they spat out spiritual energy. He immediately examined them.Spiritual BeastTwin Yin-Yang Spirit Swallowing FishThey\u2019re the descendants of the mysterious primitive Yin-Yang Sky-Swallowing Fish. The black and white fish accompany each other. The white fish is docile, whereas the black one is cruel. They are symbiotic. As long as one lives, the other won\u2019t die.OneMysterious0 pointsOmnivorous. They can swallow everything.The black fish is not visible. Except for the owner, only people with naturally-born Yin-Yang Divine Eyes can see it.What! The stored 1,000 points of spiritual energy disappeared?Han Fei\u2019s heart shivered.\u00a0Did the two little guys simply purify the spiritual energy?Was the purified spiritual energy better? Of course. For an analogy, within the tolerance range, the higher the oxygen concentration, the better. In the era of the big bang, mosquitoes could be the size of a human fist, and all marine life, land life, and plants, were gigantic.In short, if Han Fei had been ingesting this high-purity spiritual energy, it could help broaden his meridians and strengthen his bones and flesh. The purer the spiritual energy he absorbed, the stronger his combat power would be.\u201cWow, great!\u201dHan Fei was overjoyed and Li Gang and Little Red glanced back at him from time to time, wondering what was wrong with this young master who sometimes seemed to be smart but also sometimes looked like a fool.Han Fei fed Little White 1,000 points of spiritual energy once again but the latter made no breakthrough, so he fed him another 500 points. This time, Little White refused to eat it; he knew that he was already full.So Han Fei started absorbing spiritual energy, but he still felt it was too slow and he tried to work out other ways to earn spiritual energy.\u201cA-Gang!\u201d\u201cYoung Master, what\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cPut ads that the barbecue stall will be selling all products half price within the next three days.\u201dLi Gang was confused. \u201cHuh? Why on sale again?\u201dHan Fei said impatiently, \u201cJust do it. This is the way of doing business. You don\u2019t understand.\u201dAs he expected, no sooner than the discount ads were released the number of customers had almost doubled.Han Fei gained a total of 33,200 points of spiritual energy, plus the 41,806 points that he already had, which was enough for him to upgrade his spiritual heritage.\u201cUpgrade.\u201dWith a \u201cSwish,\u201d 20,000 points of spiritual energy were gone, but Han Fei didn\u2019t grudge at all. Instead, he was beaming with a smile. No wonder the upgrade this time required 20,000 points of spiritual energy. With this breakthrough, his spiritual heritage was upgraded to level-three low quality, which raised his strength by a whole level.But soon Han Fei\u2019s face turned green when he found out it would take 100,000 points to make the next upgrade. He suddenly had an impulse to curse. 100,000 points per each improvement in quality. Wouldn\u2019t it mean that if he wanted to upgrade the level-three spiritual heritage to level four, he would have to spend 400,000 points of spiritual energy?This will be too slow. Even if I give discounts to customers of the barbecue stall every day, it will still take 40-50 days,\u00a0he thought to himself.Han Fei wondered if he could talk to Old Jiang and open some more barbecue stalls on the floating island. But then he dropped the idea, because he couldn\u2019t be in several places at once, so it wouldn\u2019t get him more spiritual energy to open more barbecue stalls.Forget it. Let me raise my upper limit of spiritual energy first.Han Fei was now a fisher at the peak of level eight. Although he could break through to level nine at any time, he had to lay a solid foundation first. Anyway, he preferred quality over speed.Five days later, Han Fei lay on the ground like a dead dog. Although he was already familiar with the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing, he still felt extremely tired every time he practised it. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that it worked quite well, he would have given up on it long ago.Han Fei looked at the data.: Han Fei: Eight (Advanced Fisher): 19203 (379): Level Three, Low Quality (Upgradable): Twin Yin-Yang Spirit Swallowing Fishes: Purple Bamboo Rod: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)\u2026Han Fei was very satisfied with the data. After the comprehensive cultivation of this time, he felt stronger. If he met Li Hu again, he would be able to knock him down easily. An ordinary level-eight fisher would only have 160 points of basic spiritual energy in the beginning. Even after repeated tempering, his spiritual energy would be no more than 200 points or so. He had been several times stronger than ordinary level-eight fishers.Since I\u2019ve got so many days off, why not go to sea?Han Fei didn\u2019t dare to use the less than 20,000 points of spiritual energy he had left. He found that spiritual energy soon ran out. When he broke through to level eight, he used more than 10,000 points of spiritual energy. But if he wanted to reach level nine, he would need at least 20,000 spiritual points.The barbecue stall.Han Fei said, \u201cA-Gang, don\u2019t forget to deliver liquor and barbecue to Grandpa Jiang. I\u2019m going to sea for a few days.\u201dLi Gang was surprised. \u201cHow many days? Young Master, the sea is dangerous!\u201d\u201cI know. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cOh, by the way, Young Master, He Xiaoyu came to you two days ago. I said you were cultivating and she said that when you were done cultivating, go find her.\u201dHan Fei wondered,\u00a0He Xiaoyu went out with her father to upgrade her spiritual beast.\u00a0Did she come back so soon?\u00a0Han Fei had always felt that upgrading a spiritual beast was not a simple matter, but it seemed that she had succeeded to some degree\u2026\u201cOK, I see.\u201d\u2026At He Xiaoyu\u2019s home.Han Fei just arrived at the door of her house and happened to meet He Mingtang who was going out. Seeing Han Fei, He Mingtang questioned, \u201cHi, Han Fei! I heard that you rejected the village leader? Young Man, you should seize the opportunity. Not everyone can go to the town\u2026 Besides, I heard that Li Hu had recovered and seems to have even made a breakthrough, so be careful.\u201dHan Fei grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. He. I\u2019ll protect myself.\u201dHe Mingtang nodded. \u201cGood! Glad to hear that. Xiaoyu has just finished cultivating. You can go straight in!\u201d\u201cOk! Take care, Mr. He.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t take my daughter to fool around with you\u2026 And, don\u2019t touch her! Ok, now you can go in!\u201d He Mingtang said abruptly, turning round after taking two steps.Han Fei: \u201c???\u201dHan Fei was speechless.\u00a0Why do you think I\u2019d be interested in a twelve-year-old girl? I am not a pedophile.He entered the door, only to see a middle-aged woman who asked as soon as she saw him, \u201cAre you Han Fei?\u201d\u201cYes, Auntie.\u201d\u201cCome on in, I just made dinner. Xiaoyu is having dinner. Let\u2019s have dinner together.\u201dWhen Han Fei saw He Xiaoyu, the girl was holding a skewer of barbecue in her hand and eating it with an apparent appetite.Han Fei asked, \u201d How can you eat barbecue every day? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s too greasy? I heard that greasy food will make you fat.\u201dHe Xiaoyu rolled her eyes. \u201cNo, as long as you don\u2019t eat too much.\u201dHan Fei stared at the dozens of skewers on the table. \u201cYou called this \u2018not too much\u2019?\u201dHe Xiaoyu was offended. \u201cShut up\u2026 You know what, I\u2019m going to the town. Are you going too?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My life here is stress-free and my strength is getting better and better. I even have a feeling that here, I am going to reach the peak of life. I don\u2019t want to go to the town school at all.\u201dHe Xiaoyu was shocked. \u201cNo! I\u2019m going to be a full-time student, not an auditor!\u201dHan Fei: \u201c???\u201dReally? So I can only be an auditor, whereas He Xiaoyu will be a full-time student? Village Leader, you old bastard! Fortunately, I didn\u2019t listen to you.\u201cThen go. Perhaps you can cover me when I get to the town.\u201dHe Xiaoyu chuckled. \u201cWhy not go with me? I heard that the students of the town school are the most talented selected from all the villages. Technically, only those with level-two, good quality spiritual heritage or above are eligible to enter the school, but there are exceptions, such as you, who have unusual physical strength!\u201dHan Fei shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not going there.\u201dHe Xiaoyu said, \u201cBut you can learn something useful! Do you know the five major professions?\u201dHan Fei exclaimed in his heart,\u00a0Oh, not this again!\u00a0\u201cDid you forget the Spirit Gathering Art Fang Ze gave me? I can cultivate with that too! Maybe you won\u2019t learn as much in school as I self-taught myself!\u201dHe Xiaoyu pouted. \u201cBah, you\u2019re bragging! It is said that even the best genius in town has to learn for several years \u2026 Well, forget it. Have you heard that Li Hu has recovered and even made a breakthrough?\u201dHan Fei replied, \u201cYes! Your father told me. But it doesn\u2019t matter. Li Hu is like a salted fish. Since he has fallen down, he can no longer get up.\u201d\u201cBut there are many strong men in the Tigers! And your spiritual beast has no combat power. Once those people fuse with their spiritual beasts, you will hardly be able to defend against their attacks.\u201dHan Fei was confused. \u201cFuse with their spiritual beasts?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you haven\u2019t started cultivating your spiritual beast yet!\u201d He Xiaoyu was shocked.\u201cIs that urgent?\u201dHe Xiaoyu said anxiously, \u201cSure. Almost everyone will have their strength rise after they get their spiritual beast. The stronger your spiritual beast is, the stronger you will be after fusing with it.\u201dHan Fei was interested. \u201cWill my cultivating speed increase dramatically after I fuse with my spiritual beast? Doesn\u2019t a Spirit Swallowing Fish like swallowing spirit best? \u201dThen he smiled. \u201cLittle girl, when are you going to the town?\u201dHe Xiaoyu was annoyed and questioned, \u201cWhy do you call me that? I\u2019m older than you.\u201d\u201cBut you look much younger than me!\u201d\u201cBut I\u2026 Forget it. It\u2019s not bad staying in the Heavenly Village. At least you won\u2019t meet so many geniuses here. Your strength is not weak. Maybe we can meet at the level-one fishery after we become fishing masters.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cAre the town and villages using the same level-one fishery?\u201dHe Xiaoyu nodded. \u201cYes! All the villages use the same one!\u201dAt this time, He Xiaoyu\u2019s mother brought fish soup and Han Fei tasted it. In addition to the rich umami taste it had, there was nothing special about the soup.He Xiaoyu\u2019s mother joined the conversation. \u201cLad, you shall work hard. When you become a fishing master, your father will not object to your marrying Xiaoyu.\u201d\u201cPu\u2026 Cough, cough\u2026\u201dHe Xiaoyu\u2019s face instantly turned red. \u201cMother, what\u2026 what are you talking about?! We\u2019re just friends\u2026 I\u2019m going to cultivate.\u201dHe Xiaoyu clattered upstairs and Han Fei embarrassedly said to her mother, \u201cAuntie, I think I have to go too.\u201dHe Xiaoyu\u2019s mother was warm with her response. \u201cOk, no rush. Cultivation goes first. Xiaoyu is leaving the village in two days. The village leader will send her to the town. Han Fei! Xiaoyu\u2019s father said that you could actually go too.\u201d\u201cAuntie! Different people have different aspirations. I still have a lot of things to do in the Heavenly Water Village. I\u2019ll go to town one day, but not now.\u201d\u2026After leaving He Xiaoyu\u2019s house, Han Fei went straight to his house.The white fishing boat Fang Ze gave to him remained tied to the edge of the cliff next to his house. Han Fei jumped onto it and sailed straight to the sea.\u2026The Tigers- not long after Han Fei left.\u201cYoung Master, Han Fei has gone to sea.\u201dLi Hu frowned. \u201cGoing to the sea at night?\u201dHe pondered. \u201cLet Uncle Wolf deal with him. A dark night, a killing night. How dare he, a minor fisher, go to the sea at night? He is simply courting death.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d\u2026\u201cGee! The boat used by city people is really different, so fast and stable. With this boat, I don\u2019t have to go to the port to rent one, which was much more worthwhile than a piece of spiritual fruit.\u201dComing to the sea again, Han Fei pondered,\u00a0Spirit Swallowing Fish are from level-one fisheries. If they are put in a common fishery, would there be no fish able to kill them? He Xiaoyu once said that only very special creatures or spiritual beasts could kill spiritual beasts.With a thought from Han Fei, Little Black and Little White appeared.Seeing the endless sea, even without instruction from Han Fei, Little Black jumped straight into the seawater.Han Fei called to him, \u201cLittle Black, why are you in such a hurry? Come out of the sea.\u201dHowever, Little Black ignored Han Fei, and Little White also jumped into the sea. The two small fishes, one black and one white, jumped out of the sea and then dove back into the water, seeming to be playing.Han Fei covered his face helplessly. Most people have their spiritual beasts as fighting pets, whereas mine are two cute pets.Something suddenly drew his attention. A Blade Fish jumped out of the sea and rushed straight to Little White.\u201cLittle White, watch out!\u201dWith a twinkle and swish, Xiao Bai dove into the seawater, leaving a white flash. In the blink of an eye, he had swum behind the Blade Fish and seemed to be curiously observing this big fish.But Little Black was not so curious. He thought to himself,\u00a0You want to eat Little White? Then I will eat you first!Then Han Fei saw something that shocked him. Little Black rushed up and as he kept revolving around the Blade Fish, the latter became a fishbone.Wow, so strong?!You, a level-one small fish, ate a Blade Fish leaving only the bones?!The water glittered like frost and the fin blade of the Blade Fish fell into the water. Han Fei was about to get the blade out of water when he saw Little Black rush up again and bite at the blade.Han Fei\u2019s jaw almost dropped. What did he just see? Little Black actually ate a blade?\u201cCome here, Xiao Hei.\u201dLittle Black jumped out of the water and swam around Han Fei in the air. Han Fei found that this little guy was not hurt at all.\u201cThat\u2019s a blade, not fish meat! Don\u2019t your teeth hurt when eating it?\u201dHowever, Xiao Hei didn\u2019t seem to understand what Han Fei was saying, or he didn\u2019t even give a damn. He jumped back into the water.Because Little Black was his spiritual beast, Han Fei could sense that Xiao Hei was still eating. What was he eating? He had no idea, but he found that his spiritual energy was increasing.Oh? Directly increasing my spiritual energy?When Han Fei saw the three moons rising in the sky, he knew it was almost time. He immediately called Little Black and Little White back, only allowing them to wander around him.Han Fei sat with his legs crossed and began to cultivate and suddenly, the spiritual energy around him surged. There seemed to be rolling spiritual energy wherever the bright moonlight fell.As Han Fei was cultivating, the sea around him violently stirred and a large number of fishes emerged and writhed from time to time. As in the past, the moment when spiritual energy was present, no fish fought one another, not even the cruelest Snakebelt. They were immersed in absorbing the essence of this world as if on a pilgrimage.Little Black, who was agitated and wanted to jump into the sea again, was also quiet at this moment. It stayed suspended in the air and slowly revolved around Han Fei. The black and white spots respectively on the two fishes\u2019 heads were shining and seemed to be breathing.As time went by, however, Han Fei felt that the spiritual energy he absorbed was getting less and less. He opened his eyes and found that the calabash was flashing, Little Black and Little White were absorbing spiritual energy, so were the fishes in the sea.Han Fei gave a wry smile.\u00a0So the spiritual energy I attracted in cultivation was mostly absorbed by you guys? But fine, anyway, I still grew stronger.\u2026After more than an hour, the sea surface gradually began to stir. Some fish began to flop about and a White Fish jumped on board, almost hitting Han Fei. But at the moment the White Fish jumped up, Little Black rushed over and threw it into the sea after a few bites.Soon, there were more and more fish starting to flop around, mostly just Yellow Fish and White Fish. Fishes like Blade Fish didn\u2019t jump on board though. Little Black was relatively grumpy. He seemed to realize that his owner was cultivating, so any fish who dared to approach the deck was killed by it.As he was busy biting and chewing, suddenly both Little Black and Little White\u2019s body flashed and they actually upgraded.All of a sudden, Han Fei felt Xiao Bai bumping on his body. He turned his head, only to see that a ship shadow suddenly appeared in the distance.\u201cThere are people at sea at this time? Are they coming for me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Fei frowned. The first idea coming to his mind was that he was followed, but he didn\u2019t stop cultivating.Well, if I stop cultivating at this time, the sea would go violent.It was for this reason that he asked Fang Ze for this high-end fishing boat, but to his dismay, there was always someone trying to disturb him.Li Lang, one of the founders of the Tigers, a very strong man, was about to break through to be an intermediate fishing master. He was in the top five of the Tigers in strength.When he was assigned this task, he was full of disdain and even assured Li Hu that he would slash Han Fei\u2019s head off within two hours. He felt that it was a little insulting to ask him to kill an insignificant fisher. However, he knew that this guy almost had Leader and Young Master killed, so he was very eager to kill this guy to get the credit.At this moment, Li Lang was only 500 metres away from Han Fei\u2019s fishing boat. He figured that he was too busy cultivating and didn\u2019t notice him.\u201cEh! The spiritual energy here seems to be more intense than other places. Is that guy getting a chance to cultivate?\u201dWhen Li Lang was 300 metres away from Han Fei, he heard a flapping sound under the ship, and he took a look at it only to find that many Yellow Fish and White Fish were bumping against the ship.\u201cA school of fish? This guy is lucky to meet a school of fish at night.\u201dWhen Li Lang was only less than 100 metres away from Han Fei\u2019s white fishing boat, he felt something was wrong.No, it\u2019s not a school of fish. The spiritual energy here is exceptionally rich. This guy must have won a treasure. No wonder he dare go to sea at night. But l\u2019m afraid your treasure will be mine. I can give your head to Young Master, but your treasure, Hoho\u2026Swoosh\u2026Just when Li Lang was about to reach Han Fei, he pulled out his fishing rod, planning to hook Han Fei\u2019s white fishing boat with his fish hook so as not to let him escape.But before he cast out the fish hook, he saw the white fishing boat darting towards him.\u201cDamn it, do you want to die?\u201dLi Lang certainly wouldn\u2019t think his fishing boat was stronger than the one Fang Ze gave Han Fei. If the two boats collided, the one destroyed must be his fishing boat.\u201cRoar! Do you think you can kill me by destroying my boat? You wish!\u201dLi Lang retracted the fishing rod, carried it behind his back, and picked up a long rod. This was an Iron Rod made of Iron Trees on the seabed, which was at the same level as He Xiaoyu\u2019s Bamboo Rod and Han Fei\u2019s Purple Bamboo Rod that was not yet refined.\u201cAh!\u201dLi Lang was about to jump onto Han Fei\u2019s ship, but what did he see in the next second? The sea was roaring and rolling and hundreds of thousands of fish were flying out of the sea. He saw countless Snakebelts, Blade Fish, Green Turtles, and even two Tentacle Lobsters.Li Lang\u2019s face changed dramatically.\u00a0Damn it. Is this a small fish tide?A fishing master as he was, he was not invincible. He might be very strong in a one-on-one fight, not a single fish here could beat him, but there were too many of them!The fishes flopped violently and jumped out of the water in succession. Han Fei hid into the cabin as soon as he saw the fishes jumping up, leaving his boat drifting by itself.BANG!The bow of Li Lang\u2019s fishing boat was knocked askew and sawdust flew around. The fishes couldn\u2019t find Han Fei, so they all swarmed up at Li Lang. At this time, Li Lang had no time to deal with Han Fei and could only clench the rod in his hands.Han Fei steered the fishing boat a bit away as he watched.Huh? This man is so strong\u2026 Is he a fishing master?Han Fei saw Li Lang waving his hand and he easily broke a Green Turtle, which flew away with a ruckus. Five or six big Blade Fish darted their fin blades at him but Li Lang immediately blocked their attacks and hit two of them hard with his Rod.\u201cHumph\u2026\u201dLi Lang suddenly groaned. He was hit by a Blade Fish that had lost its fin. This would not have hurt him, but a Tentacle Lobster climbed up behind him and whipped him hard on the back with its tentacle at the same time.\u201cGo to hell\u2026\u201dThe long rod in Li Liang\u2019s hand flashed and he dented the lobster\u2019s head with a blow of his rod.Wow! He is really a worthy fishing master. Look how observant and alert he is in the fight. But how many fishes can he beat alone?\u00a0Han Fei wondered.Li Lang was in trouble at the moment. If the fishes that jumped up were all Swordfish and Tentacle Lobsters, he was confident that he could easily kill them. But what he faced up with was hundreds of thousands of White Fish and Yellow Fish who madly darted at him. It didn\u2019t make sense to beat these fishes because they couldn\u2019t wound him anyway. But if he didn\u2019t get rid of them, his sight was completely blocked. He couldn\u2019t see anything but White Fish and Yellow Fish. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have been whipped by a Tentacle Lobster!Li Lang yelled angrily, \u201cHan Fei, you insidious coward! Did you use your treasure to cause this fish tide? Do you know how many people will chase after you if I escape?\u201d\u201cThen escape! Show me how you can escape with the bow of your boat wrecked!\u201d\u201cYou coward, just keep hiding in your cabin.\u201dAs Li Lang\u2019s Iron Rod whistled through the air, countless White Fish, Yellow Fish, and Green Turtles were sent flying.\u201cOuch!\u201dA fin blade flew across Li Lang\u2019s chest and his chest was immediately dripping with blood. When he finally jumped from his ship to Han Fei\u2019s, he had four blades in his body, and the wound on his back was still burning. In addition, his face was also swollen from bumping into a Green Turtle.\u201cLittle Black, bite him.\u201dThe moment Li Lang set foot on Han Fei\u2019s fishing boat, Han Fei immediately ordered Little Black to attack Li Lang.\u201cOh!\u201dCaught off guard, Li Lang felt that his calf was bitten by something that ripped a bloody piece of flesh off his leg. He tried to find the thing that bit him, but there were only White Fish and Yellow Fish under his feet.He thought it was a coincidence, but when he took a step forward, he felt that his forearm was bitten too, and a piece of flesh was bitten off.\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201dLi Lang hurriedly refilled his body with spiritual energy, and at the moment when his body was flooded with spiritual energy, with a thought from Han Fei, Little Black quickly came back to his owner.Han Fei sneered. \u201cNow it\u2019s time.\u201dThe fish cabin was knocked open instantly. Han Fei struck Li Lang with his Purple Bamboo Rod. With a flash from Purple Bamboo Rod, Han Fei shouted, \u201cExplode!\u201dBAM!A turbulent airwave erupted between them, throwing hundreds of fish away.Li Lang was knocked back three paces by the attack. His arms were numb and he was shocked.\u00a0That\u2019s not right. Han Fei\u2019s strength is not right. Isn\u2019t Han Fei only a level-seven fisher? Liar! He is clearly already a fishing master.\u201cExplode!\u201dLi Lang had hardly stabilized his body when Han Fei hit him with the rod again.BAM!Li Lang felt that as his shoulders were hit hard, his blood was rolling and the spiritual energy in his body finally exploded. After taking two consecutive spiritual energy explosion attacks, he could hardly stand.Han Fei sneered. \u201cYou want to kill me? I will drain your spiritual energy first.\u201dAlthough Li Jue was seriously wounded, he still clenched his fishing rod and he lashed at Han Fei with it.Han Fei was sent flying through the air and bumped into a passing Green Turtle.Fortunately, he was not wounded and in the blink of an eye, he filled his body with spiritual energy again.Han Fei grinned. \u201cBrother, come and kill me!\u201dLi Lang stared at him ferociously, then quickly grabbed a Spirit Refilling Pill and swallowed it. However, as soon as he threw the Spirit Refilling Pill into his mouth, his belly was suddenly bitten by something twice and a bloody hunk of flesh was bitten off.Damn, what the f*ck was that?Li Lang hurriedly refilled his body with spiritual energy again and tightly covered the wound on his belly with his clothes to stop the blood from flowing out.\u00a0What the heck is that? He didn\u2019t even know what bit him.However, when he had just dressed his wound, he saw Han Fei sneering and his rod flash again. Is he going to give him another spiritual energy explosion attack?\u201cFuse.\u201dJust when Han Fei\u2019s rod was about to hit Li Lang again, Li Lang roared, and instantly, a shadow covered Li Lang\u2019s body.No sooner than Purple Bamboo Rod hit Li Lang again, Han Fei\u2019s shoulder had a sharp pain and seemed to be pierced by something.\u201cPu\u2026\u201dLi Lang spurted blood. Even if he had fused with his spiritual beast, half of his body still went numb and his shoulders were dented when he was hit by Han Fei.Han Fei was knocked back and quickly looked to his left shoulder, only to find that blood was streaming out of his shoulder as if penetrated by a sword. Li Lang seems to have become stronger.\u201cBastard, do you know that my spiritual beast is a Swordfish, the most aggressive fish from level-one fisheries? I\u2019m gonna kill you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: Desire to KillHan Fei blinked, jumped back quickly to block a fin blade darting at him with his rod, and then caught the Blade Fish to throw it at Li Lang.Li Lang easily smashed the Blade Fish, but the moment he smashed it, his palm was pierced. He turned his head to look, only to find that it was not a Blade Fish but a palm-sized knife.It was one of the small flying knives Han Fei made with a Blade Fish\u2019s fins. When he was first engaged in refining, he laughed at himself for making rubbish, but now it seemed that he could use them as hidden weapons.Li Lang was shocked. This bastard had so many means! He hadn\u2019t even figured out what this guy released to bite him yet and was injured by his flying knife again.Before Li Lang came back from the shock, he saw Han Fei reach out, grab something from the air, and throw it over. He thought it was another knife. But the next second he found that there was nothing at all.\u201cExplode!\u201dIt turned out to be another spiritual energy explosion attack. Li Lang hurriedly held his stick to block it, shocked and angry. Is this guy\u2019s spiritual energy endless? Even if he could gain spiritual energy by drinking Spirit Swallowing Fish soup, there was no damn soup here for him to drink! Where did he get so much spiritual energy?BOOM!Hundreds of fish were sent flying through the air by the explosion, and a Tentacle Lobster that had just climbed halfway onto the boat was shaken off, knocked into the water.Han Fei felt that his body was pierced again. This time it was his right hand. He quickly backed away and looked at his right hand where a long cut appeared.\u201cLittle Black, bite him.\u201dHan Fei gritted his teeth. He shattered Li Lang\u2019s spiritual energy once again. I don\u2019t believe you can keep refilling your body with spiritual energy.Sure enough, the next second, Li Lang was bitten in the back of his neck, and another piece of flesh was bitten off.Li Lang was going crazy. What the heck is it? Once the spiritual energy in his body disappeared, he would be bitten. Enough is enough!Li Lang was forced to refill his body with spiritual energy again. He knew that if he couldn\u2019t kill Han Fei this time, he would be doomed.At this moment.On the white fishing boat on the sea, two people, whose bodies were shimmering with spiritual energy, were fighting fiercely and clangs were heard from time to time.Han Fei retreated one step after another, not because his strength was inferior to Li Lang but that Li Lang seemed to be able to emit sword qi that left many cuts on his body.BAM!Being thrown backward, Han Fei hit the rail guard and vomited blood.\u201cVery good, do you think only you know how to fuse with your spiritual beast?\u201dHan Fei was irritated. He knew that the Tigers wanted to kill him and there was a fishing master in the Tigers, but he didn\u2019t expect the Tigers to send a fishing master to ambush him on the sea at night. Even though the sea at night was considered a horrible place and fishing masters were reluctant to come, he had come. And this person was quite strong. If Han Fei guessed right, he may be a junior fishing master before fusing with his Sword Fish, but after the fusion, he probably became an intermediate fishing master.\u201cLittle White, Little Black, fuse with me!\u201dIt was not difficult for Han Fei to kill his opponent by draining his spiritual energy with spiritual energy explosion attacks, but Li Lang was too close to him and he couldn\u2019t resist his sword qi that easily and seriously wounded him.So although Han Fei had not yet tried to fuse with his spiritual beasts, he had to do it now. Even if Little Black and Little White were still at a low level and couldn\u2019t boost his strength much, at least they would improve his strength somewhat.The next moment.Han Fei saw the black and white fish appear in front of him, circling around him, and then they entered his body like a Tai-Chi pattern.\u201cRoar\u2026\u201dAs soon as Han Fei finished the fusion, Li Lang couldn\u2019t help but take a step back. What did he see? At the moment, one of Han Fei\u2019s eyes had turned pure white against the dark sky, which meant that Han Fei had one black and one white eye.Li Lang had never seen such a creepy scene and was a little scared. Isn\u2019t this guy\u2019s spiritual beast just a Spirit Swallowing Fish? Who the f*ck said that to me? I\u2019m gonna kill him!Han Fei felt that he had become a lot stronger and probably had the power of a level-nine fisher, which might be nothing to a fishing master. But at the moment, Han Fei became extremely calm and there was a bloodthirsty desire in his heart. The sight of Li Lang aroused an urge from his heart to bite him\u2026In addition to that, the world in his eyes had changed and Li Lang\u2019s movement suddenly slowed down!Li Lang knew that there would be no chance for him to kill Han Fei if he didn\u2019t kill him right now. Without any hesitation, he covered his Iron Rod with the last bit of spiritual energy he had.He didn\u2019t think Han Fei could defend himself against the spiritual energy explosion attack of a fishing master.But this time, to his surprise, Han Fei just stood still. When his Iron Rod was about to hit him, he suddenly twisted his body in a strange angle and dodged his attack.\u201cPu\u2026\u201dLi Lang only felt a sharp pain in his chest, and then the strength of his whole body seemed to be fading. The fusion effect gradually dissipated and his strength was gone.Li Lang looked down, only to see a knife in his chest.Han Fei had no expression on his face and looked calm. He looked at Li Lang who was kneeling on the ground and gasping for breath, suddenly opened his mouth and bit at Li Lang\u2019s neck.One bite after another\u2026\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dLi Lang died miserably, and his widened eyes were filled with terror.However, Han Fei didn\u2019t terminate the fusion. Instead, he carried Purple Bamboo Rod and started to hit the fishes who wanted to jump on board. The Tentacle Lobster that was shaken off started to climb back on the boat, but a rod hit down, smashing its head.Fifteen minutes later, the ship had been covered with dead fishes and a struggling look gradually appeared on Han Fei\u2019s face.\u201cTer\u2026 minate\u2026 the fusion\u2026\u201dBAM\u2026Han Fei sat down on the deck, breathing heavily, and two small fishes in front of him, black and white, were happily revolving around him in the air.Han Fei threw up violently to the ground. He knew exactly what he had just done. He knew he had just bitten Li Lang to death. But at the moment he killed Li Lang, he felt extremely excited. Both his body and his spirit were in a state of extreme excitement. He wanted more killing and wanted to appreciate the pleasure.\u201cThat\u2019s horrible. What the hell are you, Little Black?\u201dHan Fei knew that this was Little Black\u2019s masterpiece. This guy didn\u2019t like to absorb spiritual energy from the beginning. Whenever he saw a fish, he would rush up to bite it. He was only at level 1 but had already nibbled a Sword Fish to death. When he fused with him just now, he felt his desire to kill was skyrocketing.Han Fei decided, unless his life was in danger, he would never fuse with them again. Just now, he felt like he was crazy, yes, like a madman who was crazy and extremely high. Although he knew that his state was not right, he was reluctant to terminate the fusion.After gasping for quite a while, Han Fei kicked Li Lang, who was already dead, rummaged through his person, and found nothing but a rod. He looked at it and thought, Umm, not bad. It was not destroyed when hit by my Purple Bamboo Rod, so it should be a weapon of the same level as Purple Bamboo Rod.Tossing Li Lang\u2019s body into the sea, Han Fei thoroughly cleaned up the boat. After he absorbed all the spiritual energy, his spiritual energy had exceeded 22,000 points.After a little hesitation, Han Fei chose to break through immediately. Otherwise, if another master about the same level as Li Lang came, he might not be able to defend himself. And if two came, he would definitely die.\u201cLittle Black, Little White, guard my side.\u201dWatching the two little fishes circling happily around him, Han Fei gave a wry smile. Little guys, do you know you almost drove your owner into madness?\u201cMake the breakthrough!\u201dSpiritual energy was surging around Han Fei and his momentum was constantly rising.Crack!In a split second, Han Fei accomplished the breakthrough. Of course, he was still far from the peak of level nine, so spiritual energy was still surging.After more than an hour, Han Fei opened his eyes.\u201cHu!\u201dI was too weak before the breakthrough, but now my strength has increased by thousands of kilograms.Han Fei got up and found that the wounds on his body had begun to scab. Although it was not as fast as his previous recovery speed, it was still fast. He wondered whether it was because of the breakthrough or other reasons.He looked at his data again.: Han Fei: Nine (Advanced Fisher): 1023 (399): Level-Three, Low Quality (Upgradable): Twin Yin-Yang Spirit Swallowing Fishes: Purple Bamboo Rod: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: Like A Fish Hopping in the SeaHan Fei was relieved to see that he still had 1,023 points of spiritual energy left. He had been worried that his spiritual energy was not enough, but now it seemed that it was enough. However, it was certain that the amount of spiritual energy consumed for each breakthrough was increasing. He could be sure that 20,000 points of spiritual energy would not be enough for him to accomplish his next breakthrough, which might require 30,000 or even 40,000 points.He was struggling in his heart whether he should continue to cultivate or to practice the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing.He felt that, however, in this breakthrough, the increase of his upper limit of spiritual energy was not as much as he expected. He seemed to encounter a small bottleneck, so he needed to practice the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing to help himself advance.Well, the Tigers won\u2019t stop unless I die. This amount of spiritual energy may not be enough.At the same time.The Tigers.\u201cYoung Master, Li Lang has been gone for three hours.\u201dLi Hu waved his hand. \u201cPerhaps he hasn\u2019t found Han Fei. Even an ordinary fishery covers hundreds of kilometres. It is not easy to find a certain person there. I order all people who are not yet fishing masters to go to the ordinary fisheries tomorrow to search for a white fishing boat.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201dLi Hu sneered, \u201cHan Fei, are you an idiot? You got the white fishing boat from the angel. It\u2019s just like the brightest star in the night sky. We can easily find you with this boat!\u201d\u2026The next morning, dawn came, and as Han Fei\u2019s cultivation came to an abrupt halt, the sea surface immediately stirred.Although Han Fei had reached level nine, he still hid in the cabin. Come on, even a fishing master like Li Lang could hardly handle the fishes. I don\u2019t think I can do better than him if I go out.After less than half an hour, Han Fei threw the great amount of dead fish, whose spiritual energy had been absorbed by him, into the sea, and checked his own spiritual energy with a frown. It was only 4,620 points.Damn! The fishes\u2019 spiritual energy is too low, not even 5,000 points. If I meet a master like Li Lang again, I\u2019ll need at least 2,000 points to beat him. If two of them come, I will be in danger!\u201cLittle Black, go hunting in the sea by yourself. I don\u2019t care what you do, but you must upgrade to level three today.\u201dUpon hearing this, Little Black jumped into the seawater.Now Han Fei was already on the edge of ordinary fisheries where there were very few people. He was now a level-nine fisher and his strength was completely different from before. Perhaps this time, he could give it a try on the seabed?Suddenly, Han Fei was shocked by his bold idea. A fisher is thinking about going to the seabed to earn spiritual energy? If it were known by fishing masters, they would probably slap me to death!Anyway, fortune comes from danger. When I was still an ordinary person, I dared to dive into the sea in a diving suit and play with sharks. Why should my courage diminish now?With a flop, Han Fei jumped into the sea.As soon as he entered the sea, he exercised the Wandering Dragon Art, and then he saw that Little Black was nibbling a Snakebelt while Little White was circling around him.\u201c\u2026 Wow! Do you guys have any idea that you\u2019re only level two?!\u201dSeeing Han Fei appear, Little White quickly swam over. He seemed to ask him, \u201cMaster, why are you here?\u201d Little Black also swam over reluctantly, \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me to eat fish here? Are you here to take me back?\u201dHan Fei carried Purple Bamboo Rod in his right hand with a Blade Fish dagger on his waist and an Iron Fishing Rod hanging on his back as he dove into the seabed.A Blade Fish wanted to swim over to see what Han Fei was. However, he felt a bite on him before he approached, and he hurriedly struggled and searched in anger for the thing that attacked him, but he found nothing after searching around. Then its tail disappeared, so did its belly.Han Fei clicked his tongue. It\u2019s really horrible to be attacked by an invisible creature! He still remembered the way Li Lang, dripping with blood from bites, desperately searched for what was biting him.As Han Fei dove into the sea, there were schools of fish coming over and swimming around him. No matter how powerful Little Black was, he had only one mouth and could not eat this many fish at the same time. It was only when the fish in the schools found that they had a companion who suddenly became bones that they ran away.It was not as dangerous as last time for Han Fei. Although Snakebelts swam over occasionally, he was not afraid at all.It was just that once he killed a fish in the sea, a school of fish would be attracted. This was very troublesome because he had to escape before absorbing enough spiritual energy.On the seabed.Han Fei didn\u2019t see coral reefs this time but a gray muddy ground and some jagged stones. As an experienced fisher, Han Fei knew very well how many dangers hid under the mud.Shit, what the hell is this place? There is no coral reef here. How can I get an opportunity for a breakthrough?At this moment, Han Fei was suspended five or six metres above the mud and his body was agile like a swimming fish. Little Black and Little White were flanking him.As two Snakebelts quickly swam over from a distance, Han Fei\u2019s eyes lit up. An opportunity has come!In the icy waters, Han Fei was a heat source, which quickly attracted the attention of the fishes. At the same time, under the stones, some Green Crabs began to show up.\u201cPuchi\u2026\u201dA Snakebelt frantically darted towards him, and Han Fei dodged in a strange angle, pulling out the Blade Fish dagger from his waist and killed the Snakebelt.On the other side, Little Black was nibbling a Snakebelt that struggled fiercely and twisted its body in pain, though it didn\u2019t know what was biting it. Without any chance to escape, the Snakebelt was bitten into two pieces and it sank.As soon as the two Snakebelts died, the mud stirred. For a moment, it seemed as though hundreds of sticks had shot out of the dirt, which startled Han Fei.\u201cWow! Sea Snakes.\u201dGreen Scale Sea SnakeSevenRegular21Drinking snake blood for a long time can supplement your qi and blood and enhance physical fitness.Green scale snake gallHan Fei hurriedly drifted up a bit. His blood almost froze. These sea snakes rooted their tails in the soil. Once a prey came in sight, they would swarm out. They looked exactly like sticks. If they hadn\u2019t tilted their heads, ready to attack the enemy at any time, he might have been fooled by their mimicry.Did I enter a snake pit?Han Fei\u2019s face was all black. How can I deal with these snakes?! They don\u2019t come out and I dare not go down.While Han Fei was hesitating, he saw Little Black rush past with a swish and bit a sea snake into two halves.Yes! How can I forget Little Black! These sea snakes can\u2019t see Little Black. He can just drill into the snake pit and eat them slowly.Therefore, Han Fei just drifted in the air, occasionally killing one or two Snakebelts and throwing them down to the bottom of the sea after absorbing their spiritual energy. Even the big Green Crabs under the stones came up and ate the bodies of the sea snakes.Soon, the bloody smell began to thicken.Han Fei saw Rotating Starfish flying over like darts and Hermit Crabs that seemed to have snail shells on their backs came out of the mud in all directions.The sea snakes seemed to have been angered. We don\u2019t eat you shelled ones! Why are you attacking us? You\u2019ve gone too far.So a fight began. More and more Snakebelts appeared in the distance, as well as Green Turtles, Blade Fish, and Iron-Head Fish.For a time, cold lights flashed and crashing sounds were heard without end. Han Fei found that the calabash on his wrist was shining and seemed to be swallowing spirit. And not only the calabash, Little White was also absorbing spiritual energy in this bloody scene like an elf in the water.What! Can Little White absorb spiritual energy from 20 metres away?Han Fei immediately swam onto a stone, letting the calabash slowly absorb spiritual energy. From time to time, Snakebelts swam over to siege him but were all killed.The battle had been very fierce and dead fishes were everywhere. Han Fei could occasionally see Little Black shuttle under the water.Suddenly, Han Fei frowned. The Encyclopedia of Spiritual Plants said that Snake Fruit would produce in the gathering place of sea snakes, especially Green Scale Sea Snakes. This snake fruit was a spiritual fruit and was recorded in the Encyclopedia of Spiritual Plants.Snake Fruit was a low-level spirit fruit. As snakes wouldn\u2019t move their nests for a long time, their saliva would accumulate and nourish an associated spiritual fruit. Eating this fruit could help restore a small amount of spiritual energy and heal wounds. However, its core value lay in alchemy. The Snake Pill fruit refined from Snake Fruit had a great restoring effect and contained a lot of spiritual energy.\u201cLittle White, Little White\u2026!\u201dLittle White swam to Han Fei while he was absorbing the spiritual energy. Han Fei pointed at the ground and tried communicating with him, \u201cLittle White, go see if there is dark green fruit. If there is, bring it to me. Don\u2019t eat it!\u201dLittle White immediately swam away and disappeared in the mud in a blink of an eye.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Han Fei was overjoyed. He didn\u2019t expect such a benefit in studying the Encyclopedia of Spiritual Plants.He looked at the Green Scale Snake Fruit in his hand and a string of data appeared.Green Scale Snake Fruita spiritual fruit co-existing with Green Scale Sea Snakes and nourished with the snakes\u2019 saliva. It can increase the spiritual energy of snake pits.Low-level spiritual fruitBad500 pointsDirectly eating it can increase a small amount of spiritual energy. Fishers can build up their bodies if taking it, but it\u2019s ineffective for fishing masters and above.There were seven or eight pieces of fruit in this string, which were all thumb-sized, but according to the Encyclopedia of Spiritual Plants, a Snake Fruit was as large as a fist. Was it because these sea snakes were too low of a level?Yes, this was just an ordinary fishery. How could there be so many treasures? Otherwise, fishing masters would all rush to ordinary fisheries for hunting!Han Fei swallowed all the pieces of fruit, one fruit at a time. He wouldn\u2019t bother to save them for alchemy. That would be too much work, let alone that he knew nothing about alchemy.It had been about half an hour, but the fighting showed no sign of stopping. The sea snakes had all been killed and the crabs were busy scrambling for the dead bodies of the sea snakes and fighting one another like mad.Iron-Head Fish crashed against the crabs, smashed their shells, and ate the crab roe inside. Snakebelts were nothing here. Han Fei saw some Snakebelts swim over, but only a few seconds later, they were cut into countless pieces by crab claws and eaten by the crabs.But during this time, Han Fei had absorbed nearly 5,000 points of spiritual energy. This was the bottom of the sea, where danger and opportunity coexisted.\u201cOuch\u2026\u201dHan Fei suddenly felt a pain in his leg. He patted his leg unconsciously and looked down, only to see his hands covered in blood.\u201cF*ck, what is it?\u201dMarching Sea LeechOneRegular1 pointA submarine mollusk that can be used as bait. When they breed, they forage in swarms and need to eat a lot of food, so everywhere they march over, nothing is left. When they\u2019re marching in swarms, they are invincible at level-three fisheries and below.Han Fei\u2019s expression changed drastically. He picked up one of these finger-long leeches. The slippery worm was slapped to death by Han Fei, leaving a pool of blood and mucus.\u201cEw!\u201dSuddenly, Han Fei shuddered and looked back quickly. The scene he saw almost froze his blood. Dozens of leeches were drifting over, and behind them, it was a dark and dense mass of leeches.Han Fei almost peed. If there were only hundreds or thousands of them, they might have been eaten up by the fishes along the way. But Marching Sea Leeches, just like Marching Desert Ants, usually came out in swarms, and everywhere they went, not even a single blade of grass was left.\u201cRun! Little Black and Little White, run\u2026\u201dHaving no time to care about the fighting fishes, Han Fei ejected like a rocket and didn\u2019t dare to delay at all. Even a fishing master would be turned into a mummy if trapped by Marching Sea Leeches.Han Fei exercised the Wandering Dragon Art and quickly slipped away. Little Black followed behind him and swallowed a Marching Sea Leech from time to time.\u201cYou foodie, are you still eating? Do you think Marching Sea Leeches won\u2019t eat you because you\u2019re invisible? No, they will devour everything in their path.\u201dHan Fei turned his head, only to find that the crabs, Blade Fishes, and Iron-Head fishes that were fighting fiercely had all disappeared. All he could see was a dense cloud of Marching Sea Leeches.\u201cShit, so fast?\u201dHan Fei speeded up, and at the same time, refilled his body with spiritual energy and accelerated to swim towards the surface of the sea.Clash\u2026Han Fei jumped out of the water, only to find that his white fishing boat seemed to be thousands of kilometres away. He quickly got into the water again and rushed towards the fishing boat.But as soon as Han Fei jumped into the water, he saw a swarm of Marching Sea Leech a few hundred metres away. He was stunned,\u00a0Damn it\u2026 My fishing boat is on the other side of these Marching Sea Leeches!Han Fei almost burst into tears.\u00a0Are you kidding me? Without a fishing boat, do I have to have a swim race with these leeches?Fortunately, I still have the Wandering Dragon Art anyway. Marching Sea Leeches won\u2019t necessarily win against me!\u00a0Without any hesitation, Han Fei swam crazily in the opposite direction of his fishing boat.Han Fei really regretted that he came to such a remote place. If there were someone else with him, they could jump into his boat, but now, no one would save him from the swarm of worms.Of course, it was not just Han Fei who was running for his life. There were Blade Fish darting forward around Han Fei, and behind him, there were White Fish and Yellow Fish. He even saw a big Meat Turtle rise to the surface and run for its life, but the Meat Turtle seemed not to be confident with its speed, so it shrank its head into its shell.Han Fei couldn\u2019t help but worry.\u00a0Do you think you\u2019ll be safe to shrink into your shell? The leeches could easily devour your shell!At this time, no fish was attacking Han Fei. After all, life was more precious than the stomach. Even fish knew this.At the same time, dozens of miles away, dozens of fishing boats were slowly approaching. Li Hu looked gloomy. \u201cHow could Han Fei defeat Uncle Wolf? Tang Ge must have given him some special treasures.\u201dA person standing behind Li Hu said, \u201cYoung Master, Li Lang\u2019s ship is badly devastated. It seems that he had encountered a small fish tide. Maybe he was not killed by Han Fei.\u201d\u201cStupid! Can a small fish tide in an ordinary fishery kill a fishing master? Besides, Uncle Wolf can become an intermediate fishing master after fusing with his Swordfish. How can the demonic fishes in a common fishery kill him?\u201dLi Hu was very angry. A fishing master! How valuable a fishing master is! The Tigers only had five fishing masters in total. Now they had lost one.Suddenly, one of his men shouted, \u201cYoung Master, we seem to have encountered a school of fish.\u201dThis person was looking and pointing at the distant sea with excitement.For fishermen, encountering a school of fish was a good thing. Almost every fisherman hoped to come across these schools every day.Li Hu froze for a moment, wondering if the closer to the border, the luckier one would be? But he still shook his head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget our purpose: find Han Fei and kill him. Uncle Wolf is dead, so Han Fei can\u2019t be safe. Otherwise, he would have returned to the village long ago.\u201dSoon, the fleet led by Li Hu and the school of fish met. Most of the fishes floated on the surface of the water and swam quickly, with no intention to stay.Some people looked at the sea surface and wondered,\u00a0Well, did you find that the fishes didn\u2019t look right? They are all different species of fish\u2026 Why do they appear together?Someone pointed to the sea. \u201cWhat is there? There is a strange big fish jumping on the sea surface. It looks like a Swordfish. Huh? How can a Swordfish appear in an ordinary fishery?\u201dSuddenly, someone shouted, \u201cNot good, the fishes are not foraging but escaping! Something is chasing them!\u201dBefore this man finished his words, another man shouted, \u201cLook, that\u2026 That\u2019s not a Swordfish but a person!\u201dEveryone was stunned.\u00a0Are you f*cking kidding me? Someone was swimming in the sea? Did he want to swim to hell?In the next moment, they found that that was a person indeed, but he swam faster than many fishes.Then the crowd noticed that there was a black, dense swarm of some creatures, but they couldn\u2019t see clearly what they were.Suddenly, someone screamed, \u201cRun\u2026 Young Master, run! Those are Marching Sea Leeches\u2026\u201dThe fleet was instantly in an uproar and everyone was frightened. How could Marching Sea Leeches appear in an ordinary fishery? There was a one in a million chance to encounter Marching Sea Leeches in a level-one fishery. Don\u2019t they mostly appear in level-two fisheries?Li Hu was also panicked. Having no time to think where Han Fei was, he shouted, \u201cEveryone, run!\u201d\u2026Han Fei hadn\u2019t thought that he would swim faster than the Marching Sea Leeches. After all, each man had his limits. He was not a real fish and couldn\u2019t swim as easily as fish.But at this moment, he saw hope. There were fishing boats! He immediately refilled his body with spiritual energy and his swimming speed skyrocketed.Swoosh\u2026Before the fleet fled, Han Fei caught the stern rail with his fishhook. He glided as fast as he could on the sea surface to catch up with the ships while shouting, \u201cRun, Marching Sea Leeches are coming.\u201dThe members of the Tigers were all stunned, including Li Hu. He looked back, only to find that it was no one else but Han Fei!Han Fei was also dumbfounded.\u00a0Li Hu?In an instant, Han Fei realized that this fleet was here to kill him.\u201cHaha, that\u2019s really interesting. What a small world!\u201dBAM!Han Fei landed on a fishing boat. Before Li Hu said anything, Han Fei had hit a member of the Tigers with his Purple Bamboo Rod.Clang\u2026The level-nine fisher quickly blocked Han Fei\u2019s blow, pondering how he should quickly kill this guy and claim the credit. But as soon as his rod met Purple bamboo Rod, he felt a great force fall upon him, which bent his rod and almost shattered his insides.Poof\u2026Without hesitation, Han Fei grabbed this person in one hand and threw him into the sea.\u201cNo, help! Young Master\u2026\u201dLi Hu shouted, \u201cKill him. Kill him for me.\u201dLi Hu shouted at the crowd and steered the fishing boat in panic, trying to make the ship take off.There was certainly more than one person on this fishing boat and the other three all rushed towards Han Fei.\u201cGo to hell\u2026 Explode\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The huge collision force of the spiritual energy explosions caused a gust of wind.In mid-air, Han Fei saw that the Marching Sea Leeches were only less than a hundred metres away. If he fell into the water, he would be turned into a mummy soon.Swish\u2026With a twinkle, he exercised the Hook Kiss Technique and hung onto Li Hu\u2019s fishing boat. Yanking the fishing boat, Han Fei flew towards Li Hu\u2019s fishing boat.\u201cYoung Master, watch out!\u201d\u201cProtect Young Master.\u201dOn Li Hu\u2019s ship, there were as many as five people protecting him, all of whom were level-nine fishers. Before Han Fei boarded the ship, the five people had all stood on the bow, shielding Li Hu behind them.\u201cF*ck\u2026\u201dHan Fei wasn\u2019t afraid of the five people. None of them were fishing masters. If he fought them on the flat ground, he could surely beat them. After all, although he was also a level-nine fisher, he could kill a fishing master. But now suspended in the air, he couldn\u2019t play to his full strength. If the five of them launched spiritual energy attacks at him like before, he would be hit down into the sea.\u201cLi Hu, you little maggot. I swear, I\u2019ll kill you if I survive.\u201dWith a shout, Han Fei withdrew the fishing rod and threw the fishhook at the fishing boat with the fewest people on it.But there were still three people on that fishing boat and one of them was steering the boat.Li Hu shouted, \u201cHan Fei, you\u2019re dead meat. Although you won\u2019t be killed by me, I\u2019ll still be very happy to see you killed by the Marching Sea Leeches, hahaha\u2026\u201dHan Fei said nothing. Two fishing boats that hadn\u2019t taken off yet were already crawling with Marching Sea Leeches.The Purple Bamboo Rod flashed in Han Fei\u2019s hands and he was ready to launch another spiritual energy-explosion attack.\u201cLittle Black, bite him.\u201dThe two people who were going to intercept Han Fei were wondering. Who is Little Black?Suddenly, one of them felt that something had bitten their thigh. He thought that the Marching Sea Leeches had got on the boat and quickly looked down in fright.Han Fei gave a cold smile and threw a flying knife at him.\u201cAhhhhh\u2026!\u201dBefore the person looked up, Han Fei had launched a spiritual energy explosion attack, and the two of them flew upside down by the blow, blood spurting out of their bodies. The flying knife had inserted itself into the eye of the person who was bitten by Little Black.\u201cHey! You shouldn\u2019t have let me get on board!\u201d\u201cDie!\u201d\u201cExplode!\u201dThe man who was steering the fishing boat panicked.\u00a0Is this guy the \u2018waste\u2019 Young Master spoke of? Bullshit! Can a \u2018waste\u2019 beat two level-nine fishers with one blow? Can a \u2018waste\u2019 continuously launch such powerful spiritual energy explosion attacks?Han Fei launched another attack and one of the level-nine fishers was sent flying through the air, falling heavily into the sea with a bang.\u201cHelp\u2026 me\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking, he had been covered with leeches, and in the blink of an eye, his face quickly shriveled.Another person was also seriously injured and both arms were broken.Han Fei casually poked him into the sea with his rod, not even looking at him.The only person left widened his eyes and shouted at Han Fei, \u201cIf you dare to come over, I will destroy this fishing boat.\u201dHan Fei frowned and just wanted to kill the guy but he still said calmly, \u201cI can spare your life. You can go to another fishing boat. What do you think?\u201dThe man glanced around in panic and frowned. There were only five fishing boats that managed to take off. Among them, Li Hu\u2019s boat flew the highest and furthest away. The remaining three fishing boats were all at least 100 metres away from him. He would fall into the water if he was not careful. How could he go to another boat?So the man said, \u201cEven if I escape to another boat, the Tigers won\u2019t let me off! Rather than this, I might as well die with you. Maybe Leader will take care of my family for me.\u201dHan Fei said coldly, \u201cAre you a fool? Are you sure Li Jue will treat your family kindly if you die? From what I know of the Tigers, if you die, your wife will be given to another man as a gift and your child will have to call another man \u2018father.\u2019 Who knows how they\u2019ll be treated\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll kill me anyway. What can I do?\u201dThe man roared and his eyes turned bloodshot.Han Fei shook his head. \u201cWho said I will kill you? Do you know Li Gang? He tried to kill me twice but failed. I gave him the opportunity to follow me. Now he is in charge of the Most Delicious Barbecue Stall In The World in the port, making tons of money. And I believe it won\u2019t be long before he becomes even richer\u2026 Since I can take him under my wing, why can\u2019t I take you?\u201dThis man froze and seemed to have an inner struggle. Obviously he knew Li Gang and knew that Li Gang was doing well now, so he was moved by Han Fei\u2019s words.Han Fei quickly added, \u201cLook, Li Jue is now seriously wounded and has lost half of his strength. Li Hu is a waste. I can easily kill him. I was a level-two fisher a month and a half ago, but now I can kill a level-nine fisher as easily as killing a Yellow Fish. I will wipe out the Tigers soon. If you don\u2019t yield to me now, you will die. I think you know what to choose, right?\u201dAt this time, Li Hu was looking here in his fishing boat that was a few hundred metres away. He seemed to be shouting something at this man. His voice came with the wind and it could be vaguely heard that he was telling this man to kill Han Fei.Han Fei laughed. \u201cSee? This is your Young Master? He just wants you to kill me and doesn\u2019t care about your life at all. But why doesn\u2019t he come by himself? Because he doesn\u2019t dare. Once I board his ship, he will be dead meat\u2026 Now, tell me, what\u2019s your choice?\u201dThe man seemed to be having a fierce struggle inside. He looked at the black, dense mass of leeches under the boat, took a deep breath, and looked back at Han Fei. \u201cCan you promise not to kill me?\u201dHan Fei smiled. \u201cDo you believe my promise? You have no choice, but I\u2019m not a bloodthirsty person. Otherwise, I would have killed Li Hu in that Fishing Trial. Then I wouldn\u2019t have been in this trouble.\u201dThe man asked, \u201cDid you kill the fishing master, Li Lang?\u201d\u201cLi Lang? The fishing master who tried to assassinate me last night? Yes, I killed him.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019m on your side now\u2026 The Marching Sea Leeches will soon pass. There are thirteen level-nine fishers with Young Master\u2026 On Li Hu\u2019s side, including himself. How can we escape?\u201dHan Fei instructed, \u201cSteer the boat over there. The fishing boat that the angel, Fang Ze, gave me is over there. Once we get on my fishing boat, nobody can catch up to us.\u201d1 \u201cOK!\u201dThe man immediately steered the fishing boat to fly towards Han Fei\u2019s white fishing boat. From this moment on, he had betrayed the Tigers. The only thing he could do was to count on this man.\u00a0He can kill a fishing master! What horrible potential he has! Even though he is only a level-nine fisher now.The middle-aged man remembered what Li Hu said before coming, who said that Han Fei was just a level-seven fisher. Now he just wanted to give Li Hu two slaps. Idiot! Do you have any idea what kind of enemy you have made?!Han Fei asked the man, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cLi Qing, Master.\u201dHan Fei waved his hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to call me master. I won\u2019t treat you as a subordinate. When we\u2019re done here, you can go to manage the barbecue stall with Li Gang and you can keep ten percent of the profits.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThe middle-aged man couldn\u2019t believe his ears. He could keep ten percent of the profits? He knew how rich Li Gang was now, who could earn ten mid-quality pearls a day. Many members of the Tigers envied him and everyone said that the fatty had changed from a pheasant into a phoenix.Suddenly, Li Qing\u2019s face changed. \u201cNot good, they are coming at us.\u201dHan Fei just smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Even if they come over, so what? There are all level-nine fishers. We don\u2019t have to be afraid of them.\u201dSoon, Han Fei saw his white fishing boat. At this moment, the Marching Sea Leeches had come over and the white fishing boat was also covered with a layer of leeches.Han Fei said, \u201cLet\u2019s rush over. There are only a few worms. We can easily deal with them.\u201dLi Qing nodded.The two instantly jumped into the white fishing boat. Han Fei released spiritual energy to shake the leeches off the boat before steering the fishing boat to quickly leave.A hundred metres behind him, Li Hu was roaring angrily.\u201cLi Qing, you bastard! How dare you betray the Tigers? I\u2019m gonna kill you. I\u2019m gonna kill your entire f*cking family!\u201dSeeing Li Qing\u2019s face turn gloomy, Han Fei smiled. \u201cHe can do nothing but yell at you, or, can we leave them here forever, can we?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Qing was shocked. \u201cHow is that possible?! There are fourteen of them, including Li Hu. Even if you have the strength to kill a fishing master, once you\u2019re trapped by them, no one knows what will happen.\u201dHan Fei nodded. \u201cYes, there are quite a few of them. But we can solve them one boat after another. I guess you have no idea how good a quality my fishing boat is.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dAs a frantic gleam flicked in Han Fei\u2019s eyes, the white fishing boat suddenly took off and turned around, darting at one of the fishing boats.Li Qing was terrified. Is he actually hitting a boat with his own?Han Fei said, \u201cGet ready to take over the fishing boat at any time. If they dare to jump into my boat, I\u2019ll beat the hell out of them.\u201dThe four fishing boats accompanying Li Hu were chasing the white fishing boat frantically. Seeing the boat running further and further away, they had almost given up. Who would expect the white fishing boat to suddenly turn around and rush straight at them?On one of the fishing boats, someone exclaimed, \u201cNot good, he is hitting our boat with his!\u201dThe three people wondered if Han Fei was crazy. Once the keel of his boat broke from the collision, he could only wander at sea. But immediately they realized that this was not some garbage fishing boat produced in the Heavenly Water Village! It was a fishing boat from the city. That kind of fishing boat was prepared for a journey to unknown places outside of level-three fisheries. How could it be on the same level as their fishing boats?Before they had time to think about it, they saw the white fishing boat crashing into their boat like a big bird.BAM!Han Fei shouted, \u201cLi Qing, take over this boat.\u201dLi Qing immediately took over the white fishing boat. Now he had no turning back. Since he had fled with Han Fei, he had already betrayed the Tigers, and they certainly wouldn\u2019t let him off.Fortunately, this white fishing boat was really sturdy. It easily left a big hole in the other party\u2019s fishing boat and bent its keel.\u201cDamn! Let\u2019s kill them.\u201dExcept for the man who was controlling the fishing boat, who fell to the sea with the boat, the other two jumped into the air and tried to board Han Fei\u2019s fishing boat.Han Fei sneered, \u201cHow did you treat me just now? Now you want to board my boat? Get down!\u201d\u201cExplode!\u201dWith a loud bang, spiritual energy scattered and rolled forwards, and the two people fell uncontrollably to the sea.\u201cNo!\u201d Li Hu roared.Li Hu gnashed his teeth in resentment at the sight of this scene. He said to the people on the other two fishing boats, \u201cLet\u2019s trap him and see how he can deal with three fishing boats at the same time.\u201dHan Fei quickly turned around. \u201cLi Qing, pick one boat and hit it.\u201dIn fact, before Han Fei issued the order, Li Qing had already steered the white fishing boat to crash towards the furthest fishing boat.The three people on that fishing boat became anxious. They were the furthest away but not as fast as the white fishing boat. If the white fishing boat rammed their boat, they would have no chance to survive.\u201cRun\u2026\u201dHan Fei sneered, \u201cDo you think you can get away?\u201dA hundred metres away, Li Hu shouted, \u201cLand, land on the sea. Let\u2019s deal with him together.\u201dA cold light flashed across Han Fei\u2019s eyes and he said coldly to Li Qing, \u201cKill the three men first.\u201dBAM!The two fishing boats collided again. This time the white fishing boat precisely hit the place where the driver was located and tore open a big hole, making it fall uncontrollably.The three people had to give up on the fishing boat as they tried to jump into Han Fei\u2019s fishing boat.\u201cLittle Black, bite them.\u201dOne of these people suddenly lost a piece of flesh from his neck. He froze in the air for a moment before dropping to the sea.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dThe other two were terrified and greeted by a spiritual energy explosion attack. Unable to resist it at all, they were sent flying and fell into the water.Unfortunately, Li Hu and another fishing boat had landed. The two fishing boats joined together and chased down to the place where the other boats fell.Han Fei clicked his tongue. \u201cWhat a pity! If we had moved faster, we could have destroyed one more boat.\u201dLi Qing felt a chill down his spine.\u00a0How many ships do you want to destroy? Forty or fifty of us with more than a dozen ships came to kill you, but how many people are left? There were only eight people left on the two fishing boats, including Li Hu. The elite members of the Tigers were almost wiped out. And you think it\u2019s not enough?At this time, a person stuck his head up from the water.\u201cWow, he is still alive!\u201dHan Fei was surprised. This man was really lucky to survive. But it was not strange. Although he was injured, there weren\u2019t many fishes in the sea at this moment. After all, the Marching Sea Leeches had just passed by.But although the man climbed into the boat, he was covered with leeches and had almost been sucked dry. There were still some leeches left in the sea although most of them had left. No one knew how many leeches were hidden in the sea. This man was lucky not to be sucked to death by them.Li Qing asked, \u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d\u201cFollow them. Don\u2019t give them a chance to escape. Once the boats separate, hit them separately.\u201dLi Qing fell silent. It seemed that Han Fei was determined to kill Li Hu, but he didn\u2019t object to that. If Li Hu went back, he would definitely take revenge on him. Unlike Li Gang who was expelled out of the Tigers, he betrayed them, which was completely different.\u2026\u201cYoung Master, now what shall we do? Our fishing boat can\u2019t stand the impact of the white fishing boat. If we separate, I\u2019m afraid that they will destroy us one by one.\u201dLi Hu\u2019s face was gloomy. \u201cWhat if we take off at the same time and fly back to the village?\u201dSomeone analyzed, \u201cYoung Master, this is not an appropriate move. I think Han Fei\u2019s strength is not weak. I am afraid that he already has the combat power to be at the peak of level nine. If he hits us with his boat, we can\u2019t all jump into his ship in a short time. If so, I\u2019m afraid half of us would die.\u201d\u201cGo to the central fishery. Go to a crowded place and turn to an inspector for help.\u201dHan Fei was standing on the bow of the boat, not worried at all. He was looking at the sun in the sky wondering if he would be burned to death if he drew spiritual energy from the sun.He abandoned this idea in a flash.\u00a0That\u2019d be too painful. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019d be roasted within seconds\u2026\u201cLittle Black, did you see those two ships? Go bite the people on them. Show no mercy to them.\u201dHan Fei thought to himself,\u00a0Even Li Lang, a fishing master, couldn\u2019t resist Little Black\u2019s sharp teeth. How can these level-nine fishers defend themselves?Little Black swam out quickly, and after a while, screams were heard from afar.At first, only one person was screaming but soon, they began to scream one after the other. Han Fei sneered, standing on the bow. Just fill your bodies with spiritual energy! Otherwise, you\u2019ll end up being bitten to death!Sure enough, after a while, someone began to fill their body with spiritual energy. At first, it was only one, then two, and in the end, everyone there had filled their bodies with spiritual energy. Even Li Hu had lost a few pieces of flesh before he filled his body with spiritual energy.COMMENTLi Qing \u2018s heart trembled. He didn\u2019t know what kind of hex Han Fei had used to attack those people from a few hundred metres away that forced them to exhaust their spiritual energy to protect themselves. He knew that he had discovered Han Fei\u2019s secret, so he must keep his mouth shut. Otherwise, he would be killed.Li Hu stood on the bow of the ship and roared, \u201cHan Fei, what demonic trick are you using? You\u2019re really vicious!\u201dHan Fei responded, \u201cWanna know? Beg me.\u201dIn less than half an hour, the people on Li Hu\u2019s side had almost run out of spiritual energy and could no longer fill their bodies with spiritual energy, so soon, someone screamed again.\u201cWhat the hell is biting me? Why can\u2019t I see it?\u201dA man waved around with his rod like crazy, but the next moment, a piece of flesh was bitten off from his wrist.One hour later\u2026Two people were bitten to death by Little Black, one was the guy who climbed up after falling into the water, and the other was the only level-eight fisher brought out by Li Hu.Han Fei said indifferently, \u201cThere are seven people left. With two more dead, you won\u2019t be able to go back.\u201dHearing Han Fei\u2019s muttering, Li Qing didn\u2019t dare to say a word for fear that Han Fei regretted sparing his life and would turn around to kill him.After a moment, Li Qing stuttered, \u201cHan\u2026 Young Master Han Fei, I, I\u2019m running out of spiritual energy.\u201dLi Qing was helpless. If this was an ordinary fishing boat, he would have no problem controlling it for such a long time. But this was not an ordinary one and his spiritual energy was consumed fast.Han Fei casually waved his hand and a column of spiritual energy was poured into his body. In an instant, Li Qing felt that his spiritual energy was restored quickly.Li Qing was shocked.\u00a0What is this?\u201cA Spirit\u2026 Spirit gatherer?\u201dHan Fei said coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about this for now. Otherwise, you should know the consequences.\u201dLi Qing hurriedly bowed his head. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll keep a tight-lip and never ever tell anyone about it, not even my wife and children.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The entire Heavenly Water Village knew where Han Fei got the Spirit Concentration Art, which Fang Ze gave to him after the Fishing Trial. But how long had it been since the end of the Fishing Trial? Had he acquired this Art so soon?Now Li Qing just wanted to slap those who said that Han Fei was a waste. If a person like Han Fei was a waste, then who could be called a genius? Now he was very glad that he had betrayed the Tigers. Otherwise, he would have ended up in the stomachs of those leeches.Han Fei was not in a hurry. He looked at Li Hu with a smile. \u201cThe Fishing Trial means to show us the cruelty of the ocean, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dLi Qing didn\u2019t know what Han Fei meant by that, but he vaguely felt a trace of terror.At this time, the fishing boats were already close to the central fishery. Some fishing boats appeared in the distance, and occasionally one or two fishing boats flew in the sky.Han Fei smiled. \u201cHaha! They may have a chance to survive if they fly to the sky, but they chose to lead me to the central fishery. What can they do here?\u201dIn the near distance.On the two fishing boats, the others had almost exhausted their spiritual energy, whereas Li Hu still had enough. He probably had taken multiple Spirit Refilling Pills.\u201cLi Qing, hit Li Hu\u2019s boat.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d\u201cAfter all, killing is not something pleasing to watch. Just hit it.\u201dLi Hu said nothing more and began to slam into Li Hu\u2019s fishing boat at full speed.Just then, Li Hu suddenly shouted, \u201cAbandon the boat\u201d.Han Fei played with his Purple Bamboo Rod and sneered, \u201cWhat an idiot. If it\u2019s useful to abandon the boat, why did I bother to wait for so long?\u201dLi Hu abandoned his fishing boat and all the seven people gathered on the other boat. Some of them were still waving their rods and hitting the air. They had discovered that there must be something invisible biting them. At the moment, except for Li Hu, the other six were all drenched with blood.Li Hu sullenly said, \u201cGet ready to fight.\u201dAt the moment the two fishing boats collided, Han Fei roared and rushed forward. With a flash of the Purple Bamboo Rod, he was ready to launch another spiritual energy explosion attack.Three people were standing in front of Li Hu to protect him, and another three clenched their rods in their hands, trying to ignore the thing biting them. However, only one of the three made a spiritual energy explosion attack, because the other two had exhausted their spiritual energy.Han Fei squatted down, holding the railing with one hand and dodging the attack with a strange posture. Then he turned around and kicked, and with a boom, one of the people was kicked into the sea.Then as ordered by Han Fei, Little Black jumped into the sea. Since you\u2019ve fallen into the sea, then stay there forever.\u201cExplode, again!\u201dHan Fei jumped and hit one of them with his rod, breaking the Iron Rod in this man\u2019s hand and denting his head. As blood oozed from this man\u2019s eyes, nose and mouth, he fell stiffly backwards.Li Hu yelled, \u201cBrothers! Together up!\u201dBut he was already horrified. He didn\u2019t know how Han Fei had become so strong. Although Han Fei was strong during the Fishing Trial, he was not as strong as now. At that time, he even blocked the three attacks of Han Fei. But now, he killed three people with two blows, which was horrifying!At this moment, Li Hu had no doubt that Li Lang was killed by Han Fei. This guy was a mystery. He must have some big secrets\u2026Han Fei was about to behead the next one, but behind him, Li Qing suddenly swung his rod at that guy, shouting, \u201cYoung Master, I will solve this person.\u201dLi Qing felt he had to show his allegiance to Han Fei now. He could feel the murderous intentions in Han Fei. He was only a 12-year-old boy now. Why was he so scary? He doubted that if he didn\u2019t take action right away, he would be killed too.Li Hu was furious. \u201cLi Qing, you traitor.\u201d\u201cHumph, the Tigers committed countless crimes. I have long wanted to quit.\u201dThe three people in front of Li Hu gritted their teeth, but Han Fei launched attacks one after another. They couldn\u2019t resist them at all. After three blows from Han Fei, one of them was killed; one jumped into the sea, trying to go to the nearest fishing boat for help, but after swimming for less than thirty metres, he was dragged into the water by something unknown; the hands of the last one had been broken and he dropped feebly while blood dripped from his mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t want to die!\u201d\u201cF*ck off, you piece of junk\u2026\u201dLi Hu pushed the person into the sea, shouting, \u201cTiger-Head, fuse with me.\u201dHan Fei sneered, \u201cWhew! Does your ugly fish come back to life?\u201dKnowing that there was no way back, Li Hu rushed towards Han Fei with a roar. \u201cHan Fei, one of us must die here today.\u201dHan Fei took two steps forward, hitting him hard with his rod, and with a loud bang, Li Hu was sent flying and spiritual energy began to leak from his body.Han Fei casually shook his head and chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re right. One of us must die here today. Guess it\u2019s you or me? Gee\u2026 I thought you would be stronger after your breakthrough. It turns out that you are even weaker than those you brought with your. They are already at the peak of level nine anyway. But what about you? A weakling who has just entered level nine and can\u2019t reach the peak of level nine even after fusing with your spiritual beast? What makes you believe you can kill me?\u201dLi Hu had no sooner stood up when Han Fei hit him with his rod again, smashing the deck.\u201cI heard that the Tigers have been running amuck?\u201dBAM!\u201cI heard that the Tigers kill people like flies?\u201dBAM!\u201cI heard that you had my fishing boat destroyed at the port and made me float for five days and five nights at sea?\u201dBAM!\u201cI heard that you want to kill me?\u201dBAM!At this time, Li Qing had just killed a seriously injured former colleague. After seeing this scene, every time Han Fei hit Li Hu, his eyelids twitched and his heart pounded.Han Fei didn\u2019t use a spiritual energy explosion.After Han Fei hit Li Hu seven or eight times, a big fish rushed out of Li Hu\u2019s body and bit at Han Fei. This seemed to be Li Hu\u2019s last card.Boom! Boom! Boom!The Tiger-Head Fish was hurled to the deck like a dying serpent.Han Fei cursed, \u201cHow dare you bite me, you stupid, stinky fish! Shit!\u201dLi Hu\u2019s mouth was full of blood. He still tried to struggle, but he couldn\u2019t even sit up.\u201cHan Fei, stop it.\u201dIn the distance, three hundred metres away, a fishing boat was quickly approaching. Han Fei recognized at a glance that it was his teacher, Wang Jie, an inspector of ordinary fisheries.Han Fei waved at Wang Jie with a smile. Then without bowing his head, he said softly to Li Hu, \u201cBe a fish in your next life. You don\u2019t deserve to live as a human being again!\u201dWith that, the tail of his rod flashed and he thrusted the rod into Li Hu\u2019s chest with a jerk and pierced his body. Watching this scene, Li Qing was drenched with sweat and turned ghastly pale.The next moment, Wang Jie arrived. He glanced at the blood-stained fishing boat, then at Li Hu whose eyes were still wide open, and took a deep breath.Wang Jie was shocked. In the morning, his men reported to him that dozens of fishing boats of the Tigers headed for the ordinary fisheries. Wang Jie knew that something bad would happen, so he immediately went to ask Li Gang who said that Han Fei went to He Xiaoyu\u2019s house, but when he hurried to He Xiaoyu\u2019s house, her mother said that Han Fei went to sea.Wang Jie immediately had an awful premonition. But at this moment, seeing this scene, he didn\u2019t know what to say. Someone reported that there was a fierce fight here. And when he arrived, he saw the bloody scene for himself.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dHan Fei just smiled. \u201cMr. Wang, this is what happens at sea, isn\u2019t it? Fighting with the sea, fighting with the fish, and fighting with people. Fortunately, I won.\u201dTheoretically, killing was not allowed in ordinary fisheries, but the Tigers tried to hunt Han Fei first, so although Han Fei killed these people, nobody would say anything about it. Besides, Han Fei was his student, so Wang Jie didn\u2019t say anything and took Han Fei back to the floating island.Wang Jie said upon leaving, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed into the sea for three months.\u201d\u2026On this day, the Heavenly Water Village was in an uproar.It was said that Han Fei, the first place winner of the last Fishing Trial, killed the son of Li Jue in an ordinary fishery by piercing his chest with his rod.It was rumored that the Tigers lost most of their members in that fight.It was said that the leader of the Tigers, Li Jue, vomited blood in public and his eyes were bleeding.It was said that when Han Fei returned, he declared war against Li Jue.When the old enemy of the Tigers, the Wang Family, heard this news, Grandfather Wang laughed happily and exclaimed that Han Fei was really a worthy winner of the Fishing Trial.As the most outstanding one of the third generation of the Wang Family, Wang Baiyu gave a wry smile when hearing the news. He thought to himself,\u00a0Did Han Fei really get where he is today because of Tange Ge?\u2026The entire Heavenly Water Village was talking about Han Fei, but he didn\u2019t care at all because He Xiaoyu was leaving.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He brought his daughter up with all his heart and was really reluctant to part with her.He Xiaoyu, also drenched in tears, hugged her mother and refused to get on the fishing boat.The village leader said, \u201cCough, cough! Xiaoyu! Going to the town is not like going to the city; you can come back every year.\u201dHe Mingtang smiled. \u201cYou can go now! Remember you are my daughter and have got an exotic spiritual beast. Even in the town, you are the best.\u201dHe Xiaoyu nodded. \u201cDad, I will study hard and strive to become a great fishing master as soon as possible.\u201dAt this time, Han Fei stepped forward. \u201cWell, He Xiaoyu, I heard that the people in the town are all talented and have great strength. I guess that you will have to practice other arts while practicing rod techniques\u2026 Here you are. Tang Ge gave me this knife. Keep it. If anyone bullies you, cut them with it.\u201dHe Mingtang glared at Han Fei.\u00a0Is my daughter the kind of person who will casually cut people?\u201cHuh? This knife\u2026\u201dThe village leader\u2019s eyes lit up and he took the knife and looked at it. Then he pulled out the Blade Fish dagger of He Mingtang and hit the two against one another, Hu Mingtang\u2019s dagger broke in two in an instant.Everyone\u2019s eyes lit up, and the village leader was amazed. \u201cIs this a mortal-level weapon? It\u2019s at least a treasure knife at the mortal level, mid-quality, or even high quality.\u201dHe Xiaoyu also widened her eyes. A mortal-level weapon! She had heard of such a thing before, but never used one.Han Fei scratched his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s just a knife! A knife is used to cut people, but I don\u2019t cut people, so this knife is not suitable for me.\u201dEveryone was speechless. You don\u2019t cut people? Then what about the young master of the Tigers? Yes, you didn\u2019t cut him but you did stab him to death\u2026He Xiaoyu took the treasure knife happily and felt the coldness of the blade, asking, \u201cWhat is the name of this knife?\u201d\u201cA knife is a knife. It doesn\u2019t have a name. If you\u2019d like, you can give it a name.\u201dHe Xiaoyu grunted, fondling the knife admiringly. \u201cThis knife is black and white and its blade is sharp and shining, so how about I call it, Black-and-White Knife?\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u201dWang Baiyu rolled his eyes and thought,\u00a0What kind of shitty name is that?Han Fei said, \u201cWhatever you like. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d\u201cThank you, Han Fei, I will cover you when I come back from the town.\u201d\u201cYou may not believe it, but honestly, I can kill an Iron-Head fish with one punch. Do I need you to cover me?\u201d\u201cBah, go on bragging!\u201dThe village leader interrupted the two of them. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s almost time. Han Fei, are you sure you don\u2019t want to come with us?\u201dHan Fei shook his head. \u201cNo, Leader, I still have a lot of things to tend to.\u201dThe village leader just wanted to kick his ass.\u00a0This kid speaks as though he is the village leader! He has a lot of things to tend to? Who does he think he is?As the fishing boat took off, everyone waved farewell.It was not until the fishing boat disappeared in the clouds that He Mingtang said, \u201cHan Fei, that knife\u2026\u201d\u201cMr. He, it\u2019s just a knife. Tang Ge left me more than one!\u201dHe Mingtang: \u201c\u2026\u201dThis knife was certainly not given to him by Tang Ge. Han Fei forged this knife with Li Lang\u2019s Iron Rod and the nearly fifty Blade Fish daggers he got from the Fishing Trial. Its quality was actually not mid-quality but divine-quality.\u2026\u2026Han Fei walked in with barbecue and spirits.\u201cGrandpa, I\u2019m back.\u201dThe old man lifted his eyelids. \u201cYou\u2019re finally back, brat? Without you here, soon the field will be lying waste.\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t you thrown some spiritual energy to the fields?\u201dThe old man sneered, \u201cI\u2019m old, so I\u2019m not supposed to work. Isn\u2019t it too tiring for me to till the fields?\u201dHan Fei was dumbfounded.\u00a0It\u2019s tiring to me too, alright?Han Fei threw the wine jar on the table, walked to the field humming, and sat on the ground. Where did he stop last time? Oh, yes, instilling spiritual energy into the fields in a large area.Han Fei started experimenting, throwing spiritual energy into the field.The old man picked a garlic prawn, pondering while eating.\u00a0Did this kid really wipe out the elites of the Tigers by himself?Huh? Has he reached the peak of\u2026 level nine?The old man twitched the corner of his mouth.\u00a0Are today\u2019s young people all upgrading so quickly? There are no shortages of 12-year-old level-nine fishers or even 12-year-old fishing masters in the town, but there are no 12-year-old level-nine fishers in the town who can kill a fishing master\u2026\u2026A month later.Han Fei and Old Jiang were standing in front of a large vat covered with thick fish skin.Old Jiang asked, \u201cAre you sure you succeeded?\u201dHan Fei replied, \u201cYes, but even if it has been made, it should be exposed for a period of time after the vat is opened.\u201d\u201cAre you sure this\u2026 What is it called? Vinegar, yes, are you sure vinegar is delicious?\u201dHan Fei explained, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t taste good on its own, but how many kinds of Spiritual fruits in the plantation are delicious to eat alone?\u201dThe old man nodded. Han Fei seemed to be talented in cooking and he didn\u2019t have any say in this field.Han Fei took out the Blade Fish dagger, poked a hole in the fish skin, and suddenly a sour taste floated out of the vat.The old man wrinkled his nose. \u201cIt smells really bad.\u201d\u201cSome bad-smelling things are the most delicious.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s try this semi-finished product first. Maybe it will be half-delicious.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s have a try?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u2026When Han Fei began to live in the plantation, Jiang Qin started a rotation holiday. When she came from the outside, she saw her grandfather and Han Fei standing around a big vat.Jiang Qin asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dHan Fei and Old Jiang said together, \u201cSecret!\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201dSince Han Fei learned how to spread spiritual energy over the land, he no longer tilled the land but focused on his hobbies, mainly cuisine.At first, the old man despised his hobbies, but after he tried the strange dishes Han Fei made, he began to study cooking together with Han Fei, saying that it was one of the great joys of life. He was glad he had a gourmet\u2019s luck.Half an hour later.The three of them sat around a table where a large plate of seaweed salad and a large plate of drunk shrimp, as well as three large sweet potatoes were placed.Roasted sweet potatoes were loved by both the old man and Jiang Qin. They used to eat them raw, but they didn\u2019t expect them to be so delicious after being roasted. However, they dare not taste the other two dishes.Old Jiang asked, \u201cAre you sure this is edible? Isn\u2019t this seaweed? Is seaweed edible? And this, this White Shrimp is still alive\u2026 Look, it\u2019s moving.\u201dHan Fei tried to explain, \u201cIs grass inedible? Bugs eat grass!\u201dOld Jiang shot back, \u201cThat\u2019s a bug. Is a man a bug?\u201dHan Fei rolled his eyes. \u201cBugs are tiny compared to humans, but in front of the heavens and earth, aren\u2019t human beings as tiny as dust particles? If bugs can eat grass, so can humans. As for the White Shrimp, it\u2019s only delicious when it is alive and it will lose its flavor when it dies.\u201dHowever, neither Old Jiang nor Jiang Qin touched the two dishes.Han Fei cast a glance at the two with contempt, picked up a White Shrimp, and put it into his mouth. As he spat out a piece of shrimp shell, the transparent shrimp flesh had slipped into his stomach.Old Jiang and Jiang Qin exchanged a glance. Seeing that Han Fei seemed to really enjoy it, Old Jiang couldn\u2019t help but pick one up and put it into his mouth.A soon as he tasted it, his eyes brightened, and then he copied what Han Fei had just done.Old Jiang questioned,\u201dIs this vinegar?\u201dHan Fei was curious about what he thought. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201dOld Jiang confessed, \u201cVery good. It\u2019s simple and fast to make, and once you make a vat of it, you can eat it for a long time. Good, good\u2026\u201dJiang Qin frowned, wondering if the two were deceiving her together. However, she had tried the dishes made by Han Fei a few times, which were really good, so in the end she also tasted a drunk shrimp.When the White Shrimp touched her tongue, it tasted so smooth and special. It felt as if life was beating on her tongue. The rich wine aroma and the sour yet delicious sauce made her narrow her eyes.\u00a0That\u2019s really delicious,\u00a0she thought.\u201cWhat about this seaweed?\u201dHan Fei smiled. \u201cWhy not have a try, Sister Qin?\u201dThinking of Drunk Shrimp, Jiang Qin no longer hesitated as she tasted it.Half an hour later, most of the seaweed salad and drunk shrimp were in the stomachs of Old Jiang and Jiang Qin, but the roasted sweet potatoes remained untouched.After a while, the old man lay lazily on the chair, chewing roasted sweet potatoes and seemed to be enjoying himself.Old Jiang clicked his tongue. \u201cBoy, I think you shouldn\u2019t be a spirit gatherer. Be a cook. I bet you\u2019ll be very popular.\u201dHan Fei didn\u2019t seem to be sold on the idea. \u201cI am not interested in cooking for so many people. I only cook for myself.\u201dSuddenly, Han Fei saw Jiang Qin winking at him, motioning him to follow her.\u2026Deep in the garden.Han Fei asked, \u201cSister Qin, what\u2019s up? Why do we have to sneak around like this?\u201dJiang Qin looked at Han Feidao seriously. \u201cDo you want to learn combat skills?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cCombat skills?\u201dOf course, Han Fei wanted to learn them. When he came back from the sea a month ago, he had realized this problem. His current combat skills were too scarce. In addition to attacking with his rod, all he knew was spiritual energy explosion attacks. He felt that even Little Black was more useful than him because he could bite people.Han Fei immediately said, \u201cSure! Sister Qin, are you going to teach me combat skills?\u201dJiang Qin nodded. \u201cI can teach you, but you have to promise me something\u2026\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s useless to tell you now, but you have to make a promise. If one day you become a strong soul warrior, you have to come back to the village once.\u201dLooking at Jiang Qin\u2019s serious expression, Han Fei couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cStrong? How strong?\u201d\u201cAt least stronger than Fang Ze.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c\u2026\u201dHan Fei scratched his head. \u201cSister Qin, you\u2019re talking about Fang Ze! The legendary Hidden Fisher! Stronger than him? Is it possible?\u201dJiang Qin continued, \u201cIf you can\u2019t be stronger than him, then forget about it. I can teach you for free and you don\u2019t need to fulfill any promises.\u201dHan Fei had long felt that this grandfather and granddaughter pair were very strange. The old man was obviously very strong, which was obvious from his fight with the village leader. At that time, the village leader had done all he could, but the old man just moved his fingers and threw the village leader out. He was sure that Jiang Qin was very strong too.Han Fei scratched his head again. \u201cThen, let me have a try.\u201dJiang Qin looked at Han Fei seriously. \u201cThink it over please. I know that you have the talent to become a spirit gatherer. When you reach the level of Fang Ze, you\u2019ll be worshipped by everyone. However, a spirit gatherer is not the one to fight in combat. Although they can control spiritual energy, it is difficult for them to achieve great results.\u201dHan Fei was confused. \u201cSo?\u201dJiang Qin explained, \u201cA soul warrior owns the strongest combat power and the best weapons. The best soul warrior can have both the great defensive ability of an armorist and the explosive power comparable to that of a hunter. So are you willing to become a soul warrior?\u201dHan Fei felt as if he were dreaming. Not long ago, he didn\u2019t even know what a spirit gatherer was. When he saw the armorist of the Wang Family at the fair, he thought that man looked so cool and was envious of him. But now he had not only become a spirit gatherer, but also might even become a soul warrior.Han Fei felt his heart pounding. He swallowed and asked, \u201cWhy do you choose me?\u201d\u201cYou have a kind of luck that others don\u2019t have. By rights, you should have died on the sea after having so many accidents in the fisheries, but you survived. Not only that, you are getting stronger and stronger and even\u2026 killed a fishing master.\u201dHan Fei \u2018s heart had a quiver. \u201cYou knew this already?\u201dJiang Qin shook her head. \u201cAlthough I haven\u2019t witnessed that battle, I knew Li Lang of the Tigers went to sea, but he never came back. He must be dead.\u201d\u201cSister Qin, do you choose me because of my talent?\u201dJiang Qin asked with a smile, \u201cDo you have talent?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dHan Fei felt that he was being despised, but whatever! He could be a soul warrior! If he learned combat skills, he didn\u2019t have to keep knocking around his enemies with his rod!Jiang Qin said, \u201cGrandpa opposes you becoming a soul warrior for a reason. There are very few people who can be engaged in two professions. Even if there are, few of them are proficient in both professions. Are you willing to take the risk?\u201dHan Fei nodded like a chicken pecking at rice. \u201cYes, I am!\u201dHan Fei was certainly willing. He felt that a spirit gatherer of his current level was completely useless in battle! When his enemy attacked him, he could only use his rod. But once he became a soul warrior, he would be able to cut his enemies with a knife, stab them with a sword, or shoot them with a hidden weapon!Jiang Qin nodded slightly. \u201cDo you know why a soul warrior is almost invincible in close combat?\u201dHan Fei shook his head.Jiang Qin explained, \u201cBecause of their strong physique, good weapons, and adequate combat skills. This is also one of the reasons that I choose you. You have huge strength, which is something that ordinary people lack. I don\u2019t know what chance you have, but that must be the reason why you can advance so fast and have such incredible strength.\u201dJiang Qin instructed, \u201cSince you have made your choice, go to the village library to find me tomorrow.\u201d\u2026There was a library in the village, but no one took it seriously. It was said that the combat skills stored in it were all low-leveled. After the Fishing Trial, Han Fei was allowed to enter the library at any time to choose combat skills to practice, but he forgot about it. Now standing in front of the old building, he wondered,\u00a0Could there be any good stuff in this shabby building?Jiang Qin saw Han Fei\u2019s face and asked, \u201cWhy is that look on your face? Do you despise the library?\u201d\u201cNo! Haha\u2026 I just think the design of our village\u2019s library is\u2026 Um\u2026 Very simple.\u201dJiang Qin said calmly, \u201cNot only you, many people despise this library and don\u2019t believe there can be any books about advanced combat skills here. But who tells you that the more advanced the combat skills, the better?\u201dHan Fei tilted his head and looked at her. \u201cAren\u2019t they?\u201dJiang Qin shook her head. \u201cThe higher the level of a combat skill, the more difficult it is to practice. In contrast, the lower its level, the easier it is to practice. For a soul warrior, any combat skill that is practical is good. Even the worst combat skill can be used in combat, can\u2019t it?\u201dHan Fei clicked his tongue. Although what Jiang Qin said seemed to make sense, no one really wanted a junk combat skill. Besides, even if it was a low-leveled combat skill in itself, it was not necessarily a low-leveled one in his hands! He had a Demon Purification Pot, right?Jiang Qin gave him the first task. \u201cNow go in! Choose the combat skills you are interested in and take them out.\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cHow many books can I take out?\u201d\u201cAs many as you want. After all, even if you take them out, I will not necessarily let you learn them.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c???\u201dThere was only an old man guarding the library, who looked like a janitor. Han Fei glanced at him, wondering if this old man was a recluse master.But this old man was so ordinary and looked as if he might die at any moment. Han Fei shook his head.\u00a0How can there be so many recluse masters?He entered the library. As he expected, it was dilapidated inside and the wooden floor creaked when he stepped on it. The bookshelves looked as if they would fall down at any moment and there were many clusters of spider webs in the corners.\u00a0Oh, isn\u2019t there a janitor here? How come there are so many spider webs?Unlike what was said that the higher the level a combat skill was, the higher floor it would be placed on in the library, this library had only one floor.Han Fei stepped forward and found that there were fingerprints on some books. Obviously, the library still had visitors, but there was too much dust here. Each time he touched a book, it would leave a fingerprint on the book. But there were still many books full of dust and without any fingerprints.Han Fei glanced over.Rod Skill, Fist Skill Outline, Fishing Skill, Iron Fist Art, Iron Fishing Rod,\u00a0and\u00a0Fish Chopping Knife\u2026 A bunch of books that gave him no desire to read were placed here.Han Fei twitched the corner of his mouth. Since the village library was like this, the town library probably wouldn\u2019t be better.Not minding the dust, Han Fei searched all the way and looked at each book\u2019s name. Whenever he found a book\u2019s name pleasing to his eyes, he took it out and threw it on the ground and then chose from these books.Seven Knife Choppings. The name looks nice. Keep it.Ho, Infinite Cudgel, nice! Keep it.Sword in Sleeve, it sounds like some hidden weapon. Keep it.Windy Rod, um, maybe it can be useful. Keep it.Rod Shaking Technique. Is it used for fishing? Can it be better than my Hook Kiss? Not interested.\u2026More than half an hour later, Jiang Qin was stunned to see that Han Fei came out with a stack of books that was up to his chin.Jiang Qin was helpless. \u201cCan you read all these books?\u201d\u201cNo, help me choose some. I have selected a few books myself. I feel pretty good about them.\u201dJiang Qin agreed. \u201cShow me the books you\u2019ve selected.\u201dHan Fei pulled out three books from the bottom, which were respectively,\u00a0Wind and Waves Technique,\u00a0The Strongest Invincible Rod Technique, and\u00a0Sea-Splitting Sword Art.Jiang Qin: \u201c\u2026\u201dHan Fei was still smug. It took him a lot of energy to find these three amazing books!However, Jiang Qin frowned and threw these three books to the ground at random. \u201cSo you just choose your combat skills based on the name? Did you only pick those with nice names?\u201dHan Fei replied, \u201cYes! I think an author who can work out such an amazing name for his book must be somebody. Am I wrong?\u201d\u201cThe fisher who wrote the\u00a0Sea-Splitting Sword Art,\u00a0um, was somebody indeed. After finishing this book, he went to an ordinary fishery with a sword and was killed by a Blade Fish.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c???\u201dJiang Qin continued, \u201cAs for the author of the\u00a0Wind and Waves Technique,\u00a0he wrote this book as soon as he became a fishing master. Then he went to a level-one fishery to brave wind and waves but ended up being stabbed to death by a Sword Fish.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c???\u201dHan Fei asked carefully, \u201cThen what about the author of the\u00a0The Strongest Invincible Rod Technique?\u201dJiang Qin shot this one down too. \u201cWell, he accidentally knocked himself to death with his rod.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c???\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 80": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Fei felt that these authors were too unreliable as they had simply ruined their legacies.Jiang Qin wanted to look through the rest of the selection. \u201cOK, let me see the rest.\u201dStanding in front of Han Fei, Jiang Qin picked up a book and threw it away. \u201cThe author of\u00a0Nine-Level Sword\u00a0had Qi deviation when he was still studying the first level of this combat skill. Not this one.\u201d\u201cThis\u00a0Sea Cudgel\u00a0is mediocre and is not as good as the\u00a0Sweeping Stick\u00a0you practiced. You can throw these away.\u201d\u201cThis\u00a0Broken Knife Art\u00a0is full of empty talk and isn\u2019t practical at all. Not suitable for you.\u201dHan Fei watched Jiang Qin throw away the books one by one dumbfounded. In the end, there were only five books left.Han Fei asked,\u201dSister Qin, are you going to throw them all away? Didn\u2019t you say that the level of combat skill is not important? Why are you still so picky about them?\u201dJiang Qin was silent for a moment. \u201cI overestimated your ability to choose.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c???\u201d\u201cI found that half of the books you chose are about hidden weapons. Do you know that hidden weapons are exclusively used by hunters?\u201dHan Fei replied, \u201cIsn\u2019t it a good thing to strike when the enemy is unprepared?\u201dHan Fei liked hidden weapons. Technically, Little Black was a kind of hidden weapon.Jiang Qin explained, \u201cSoul warriors prefer head-on attacks. Although they are not forbidden from using hidden weapons, in most cases, they don\u2019t use them.\u201d\u201cCan I study one or two hidden weapons as my killer punch?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve kept one for you. Learn these five combat skills first.\u201dHan Fei glanced at the five books in her hands, which were respectively\u00a0Gusty Rod, Stormy Footwork, Blood Boiling, Fast Knife Technique,\u00a0and\u00a0Elusive Grapper.Han Fei returned to the plantation happily with the five books.\u00a0I\u2019m going to be a soul warrior!\u00a0When I become a soul warrior, I\u2019ll crush my enemy\u2019s heads easily! As for a person like Li Jue, umm\u2026 I\u2019ll be able to kill him with one cut.\u2026In the plantationOld Jiang cast a disapproving glance at Han Fei and said, \u201cYou should be more ambitious.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c???\u201dOld Jiang sneered. \u201cDo you know that in any combat a soul warrior must fight at the forefront, they have the highest mortality rate, and are the target of everyone\u2019s blow?\u201dHan Fei questioned, \u201cOh? Is it dangerous to be a soul warrior?\u201d\u201cOf course. Spirit gatherers and soul warriors are the souls of a team. Soul warriors are always the first to die in a battle, and then it\u2019s the armorists. Do you think you can be the exception?\u201dHan Fei scratched his head and took a breath. \u201cOK, let me disguise myself as a spirit gatherer in combat. Yes! Then everyone will try to protect me in combat.\u201dOld Jiang: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cF*ck off, I don\u2019t care what combat skills you learn, you\u2019ve gotta till the land first. Only when you get proficient in Spirit Concentration Art can you proceed to the next stage of the study.\u201d\u201cAlright, Grandpa.\u201dHan Fei had no idea what he was going to study at the next stage, but he didn\u2019t remember he had ever studied anything here! Apart from reciting books and tilling the land, he literally learned nothing!Han Fei sat on the ground holding the five books and quickly browsed them. Soon, he figured out why Jiang Qin chose them for him.The characteristic of\u00a0Gusty Rod\u00a0was its fast speed, but the strength was not strong enough. However, he could make up for this weakness.Stormy Footwork\u00a0was also to increase his speed. If he couldn\u2019t resist his enemy, he could escape with this Art. But then he wondered if he could use this footwork at sea.Boiling Blood\u00a0was not exactly a combat skill, but a technique to improve his explosive power. It consumed a lot of Qi and spiritual energy to activate the spiritual energy in his body and stimulate his body, so as to improve his strength in the short term.Fast Knife Technique\u00a0and\u00a0Elusive Grapper\u00a0were easier to understand.\u00a0Fast Knife Technique\u00a0was a technique about a flying knife, and\u00a0Elusive Grapper\u00a0was a skill to make your hand muscle more flexible. He would be able to use hidden weapons better with the two techniques.Gee! That\u2019s really well-rounded! If I can deduce these techniques, won\u2019t my strength be greatly improved?Gusty Rod (Low end): The work of an unknown person, low-grade, intolerably bad.: Unable to be deduced. You can try deducing a new technique from it on your own. The deduction results are random and it requires 1,000 points of spiritual energy to deduce it.Han Fei gaped at the information.\u00a0Low end? Low-grade?? Intolerably bad??? If the author hears your comments, he may jump out of his coffin in anger!Han Fei smiled.\u00a01,000 points of spiritual energy, that\u2019s a piece of cake for me.\u201cDeduce.\u201dNew data appeared in his mind.Crazy Devil\u2019s Rod (Mortal Level, Ultra Quality): The combat skill was created by a genius fisher three hundred years ago when he was hunted by his enemy. With this combat skill, he killed two fishing masters and nine fishers and then died of exhaustion of spiritual energy.: It tends to make people crazy and lose reason. Do use it with care.: You can try deducing a new technique from it on your own. The deduction results are random and it requires 10,000 points of spiritual energy to deduce it.Han Fei immediately took a deep breath.\u00a0Wow, deduce an ultra-quality technique with only 10,000 points of spiritual energy! But the guy who created this technique was really awesome. He killed two fishing masters and nine fishers although he was only a fisher!\u00a0But then Han Fei remembered that he also killed one fishing master and dozens of level-nine fishers not long ago.\u2026Han Fei continued to deduce, only to find that the five combat skills were all low-end. He thought to himself,\u00a0The combat skills from the village library were lame indeed. I should find some better combat skills from the town or the city.Ten minutes later, all the combat skills had been deduced.Wind Footwork (Mortal Level, Ultra Quality): Nine hundred years ago, a fishing master came across a gale, and feeling the power of the wind, he created the Wind Footwork. With this technique, one can ride the wind for as long as 800 metres.: The speed is average.: You can try deducing a new technique from it on your own. The deduction results are random and it requires 10,000 points of spiritual energy to deduce it.\u2026Fury (Mortal Level, Ultra Quality): Two hundred years ago, a soul warrior fused his Qi, blood, and spiritual energy and thus brought out his maximal strength to save a friend in danger. The strength that can be improved depends on the physique of the specific person.: It can only be used once within a day.: You can try deducing a new technique from it on your own. The deduction results are random and it requires 10,000 points of spiritual energy to deduce it.\u2026Universe Machete (Mortal Level, Ultra Quality): 500 years ago, a great genius created this technique on the first day he came to touch a machete. All the user\u2019s spiritual energy will be drained when this technique is used.: The user will lose all his spiritual energy after using it.: You can try deducing a new technique from it on your own. The deduction results are random and it requires 10,000 points of spiritual energy to deduce it.\u2026Shadowless Hands (Mortal Level, Divine Quality): In ancient times, a cultivator weaved a giant spiritual net with spiritual energy. When he finished weaving the net, he was inspired to create the Shadowless Hands.: You can try deducing a new technique from it on your own. The deduction results are random and it requires 10,000 points of spiritual energy to deduce it.Han Fei was very satisfied with the deduced techniques, especially the last one, which was a divine-quality combat skill. Although it was only an auxiliary skill, with this book alone, it was worthwhile for him to go to the village library.But to his disappointment, among the five techniques, except for the Shadowless Hands, the other four\u2019s disadvantages were too obvious. Crazy Devil\u2019s Rod may drive him crazy. Wind Footwork had to be practiced at sea. Fury didn\u2019t look practical! The only thing he could try was how much combat power would be increased after he used this technique. As for Universe Machete, once he used it, his spiritual energy would be drained, which made the skill look like chicken ribs.Pondering for a while, Han Fei used Fury to fuse his spiritual energy, Qi, and blood. At the next moment, he felt that his body was inflating.His eyes turned bloodshot and the blue veins on his neck protruded.Dong\u2026Han Fei hit the ground with a fist, leaving a big pit in the ground. He felt that if he met Li Lang again, he should be able to fight him head-on without Little Black\u2019s help.Only holding on for several minutes, Han Fei sat on the ground, panting.Umm, not bad\u2026 But I\u2019m aching a bit all over and don\u2019t feel very well.Three days later.Jiang Qin came to visit him. According to her estimation, these simple combat skills were very quick to learn and would only take Han Fei three days at most to master them, so she came to check his mastery now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter being aggressively cleaned up by Jiang Qin, a vacant space the size of a basketball court appeared in the plantation.At this moment, Jiang Qin and Han Fei stood opposite one another.Jiang Qin began the interrogation. \u201cHave you learned these combat skills?\u201dHan Fei scratched his head. \u201cYes, but I don\u2019t think they are suitable for me.\u201dJiang Qin: \u201c???\u201dHan Fei explained, \u201cWell, I think these skills are a bit too powerful. I\u2019m afraid that not only would my enemy not withstand them, but neither would I.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dJiang Qin wanted to roll her eyes.\u00a0Are you talking about those basic combat skills? Is it the first time you are exposed to combat skills?Jiang Qinqing shouted, \u201cCome on, use all your combat skills on me. Show me what you\u2019re capable of.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019ll be too cruel to you! Sister Qin, you\u2019re such a beautiful and delicate girl and I don\u2019t want to hurt you. Otherwise, Grandpa will kill me!\u201d\u201cHurt me? Give it a try!\u201dWith that, Jiang Qin suddenly stepped on the ground, jumped up, and kicked him.\u201cWait, wait a minute\u2026\u201dBAM!Han Fei was kicked seven or eight metres away and fell to the ground. If he hadn\u2019t blocked the attack with his rod, he would have been lying on all fours on the ground.\u201cSister Qin, I have something to say. Please stop!\u201d\u201cWait till we finish. Just show me your combat skills.\u201dWithout giving Han Fei a chance to speak, Jiang Qin struck again, empty-handed. The kick she made just now had proved how terrifying her strength was. Even though she reserved some of her strength, Han Fei could hardly resist her.\u201cOuch\u2026\u201dHan Fei took a deep breath.\u00a0So this is the way a soul warrior acts? Get into a fight with you at any time. Will she kill me if I say I don\u2019t want to learn these combat skills?\u201cCome, my rod.\u201dHan Fei roared in a low voice, and when he looked up again, Jiang Qin was shocked to see that his eyes were full of frantic fighting intentions.BAM!Han Fei stepped on the ground, leaving a small pit in place and started his attack. Unlike the hacking, sweeping, and stabbing movements of Sweeping Stick, the characteristic of Crazy Devil\u2019s Rod was being fast and violent.Jiang Qin was a little bit stunned.\u00a0Huh? Is this Gusty Rod?Clang\u2026Having no time to think about it, Jiang Qin concentrated on the fight. The shadows of her fist and Han Fei\u2019s rod almost overlapped and colliding sounds were heard repeatedly.Jiang Qin was astonished.\u00a0Is Gusty Rod so powerful?\u00a0And when she looked at Han Fei, she found that an eerie smile was hovering over this guy\u2019s lips and his eyes were full of madness.\u201cCut.\u201dHan Fei hit Jiang Qin with his rod but his attack was easily blocked by her. Then he picked, stabbed, chopped, poked, and backhanded. His movements were varied and his attacking angles were strange.Jiang Qin turned green.\u00a0Hey! You\u2019re hitting my eyes, chest and the part between my legs! You damn boy, let me teach you a good lesson!\u201cBreak!\u201dJiang Qin\u2019s fist suddenly flashed and she threw a punch at the tip of his rod.BAM!Han Fei was knocked backward three to four metres. Then he poked his rod into the ground to stabilize his body that was sent flying backward, leaving a long mark on the ground.Jiang Qin squinted at Han Fei. She had been forced to use her fishing master-level strength because she found that if she still used the strength of level-nine fisher, she might be immediately defeated by him.\u201cHoho\u2026 It seems that I can\u2019t beat you with the Crazy Devil\u2019s Rod. Then what about Fury?\u201d\u201cRoar\u2026\u201dHan Fei\u2019s body suddenly inflated and blue veins stood out on his neck, forehead, and hands.\u201cKill!\u201dIn the blink of an eye, Han Fei\u2019s speed doubled. He waved his rod so quickly that only the shadow of the rod could be seen, and the power of each blow was overwhelming. Jiang Qin was forced to adjust her strength to the peak of a junior fishing master, only to find that she still couldn\u2019t resist his attacks. Han Fei\u2019s blows were unexpectedly powerful and he moved extremely fast.\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to lose within one minute. Upgrade to Intermediate Fishing Master!\u201dThe two sides were so well-matched that neither could gain the upper hand. Dirt flew across the field, the shadows of the rod flashed, and spiritual energy spread, creating ripples in the air.Outside the field.Old Jiang looked at this scene holding a skewer of shrimp and pondered. Not noticing the shrimp had been eaten up, he bit the skewer in his hand again.\u201cHan Fei, stop.\u201dJiang Qin was surprised. This was definitely not Blood Boiling. God knew what this was. How could Blood Boiling improve a person from a level-nine fisher to an intermediate-level fishing master?Han Fei chuckled and didn\u2019t stop at all. Seeing his rod flash with spiritual energy, Jiang Qin let out a curse in anger. This brat was going to launch a spiritual energy explosion attack at her.Bam, Bam, Bam\u2026At extremely short intervals, he launched three spiritual energy explosion attacks in a row.\u201cHan Fei, that\u2019s enough.\u201dJiang Qin punched so fast that only the shadow of her fist could be seen. She launched a spiritual energy explosion attack too, sending Han Fei flying through the air.Jiang Qin just wanted to stop when Han Fei\u2019s rod was suddenly swung at her forehead.Clang\u2026While the Purple Bamboo Rod was shaken away, swishing sounds were heard.Jiang Qin immediately upgraded to an advanced fishing master. Her hands moved fast, shaking off the palm-sized flying daggers that were darted at her.\u201cHan Fei\u2026\u201dBut her words were ignored. Han Fei leaned forward and tried to stab her with two arm-length daggers.Jiang Qin dodged quickly, but the daggers followed her like her shadow and turned like butterflies in Han Fei\u2019s hands. Although Jiang Qin had improved her strength to that of an advanced fishing master, she was still continuously cut on the forearm by Han Fei.Not only that, Han Fei still wanted to stab her chest.Jiang Qin was finally annoyed. She instantly filled her body with spiritual energy. With a bang, Han Fei was shaken backward seven or eight metres.Han Fei fell to the ground with a backward somersault. He suddenly smiled coldly at Jiang Qin and the dagger in his hand shot out as fast as lightning. The dagger was covered with flashing spiritual energy and left a long shadow as it cut through the air.Jiang Qin\u2019s face changed greatly. She immediately mobilized all the spiritual energy in her body and shouted, \u201cDestroy!\u201dBAM!The violent explosion directly overturned the land within three metres of Jiang Qin\u2019s foot, and the latter looked down at her fist, only to see there was a cut between her middle finger and ring finger and blood oozed out of it.Jiang Qin was shocked. A fisher made her bleed. How could this be possible? No one would believe it, not even herself! She was a veritable Dangling Fishing Master, only one step away from being a Hidden Fishing Master. She could even fight with Fang Ze, but now a fisher made a cut in her hand?Han Fei seemed to be going to launch another attack at her, but as soon as he stepped his feet hard on the ground, he collapsed to the ground and fainted.Seeing this, Jiang Qin didn\u2019t know what to do. He had fainted, so she couldn\u2019t hit him, but if she didn\u2019t hit him, she couldn\u2019t vent the anger for almost being killed by him just now!\u201cI told you not to make him a soul warrior. Look, what a little monster you\u2019ve made. Gee \u2026 He was such a good boy when he was studying Spirit Concentration Art. All he did was pick flowers, farm, and occasionally cook, but now he is not adorable at all.\u201dOld Jiang walked forward leisurely, touched Han Fei\u2019s neck, and nodded slightly. \u201cHe did faint.\u201dJian Qin was confused. \u201cWhy was he attacking me like crazy?\u201dOld Jiang wondered, \u201cWhat kind of combat skills did you choose for him? How did they turn him into this?\u201d\u201cCombat skills? Well, I selected some combat skills for him from the village library. You know, there were only some lame basic combat skills there.\u201d\u201cOh? That\u2019s strange. Then where did he get these crazy combat skills?\u201dJiang Qin had an idea. \u201cBut I noticed that the combat skills he just used are the sublimated versions of those I chose for him and much stronger than the original ones. This kid must have a secret.\u201d\u201cI knew it\u2026 He memorized the Encyclopedia of Spiritual Plants in one day. How could that be possible?\u201dJiang Qin didn\u2019t have an answer. \u201c\u2026 I thought he was crazy. Don\u2019t you think he was like a monster just now?\u201d\u201cWell, geniuses are always envied\u2026\u201d\u2026In bed.Han Fei felt sore all over his body as if he had wandered in the sea for five days and five nights. He felt that his bones had almost fallen apart.\u201cOuch\u2026 Grandpa\u2026 Sister Qin.\u201dSoon, the two of them came in from outside.Old Jiang was the first to arrive. \u201cDoes it hurt? You deserved it! The combat skills you learned are beyond the limits of your physical endurance. You should be glad that you aren\u2019t disabled. If your body hadn\u2019t been strong enough, you would have ended up in bed for the rest of your life.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c???\u201dHan Fei looked over at Jiang Qin. \u201cSister Qin, it was you who asked me to fight with you. I said wait a minute, but you didn\u2019t listen to me!\u201dJiang Qin looked serious. \u201cWhere did you learn these combat skills?\u201dHan Fei was puzzled. \u201cYou chose them for me!\u201d\u201cBullshit, the combat skills you used are not what I chose for you! How can you explain it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Fei certainly wouldn\u2019t tell her the truth as he began to blab at random.\u201cWell! Here is the thing. I tried the Gusty Rod, but it was not very easy to use. Just being fast isn\u2019t enough. Li Gang is also fast but I will defeat him with a single blow. So I innovated a bit, grabbed some spiritual energy from my body, and exploded it, and then it did become easier to use! It became more powerful while maintaining its speed\u2026\u201dJiang Qin and the old man were dumbfounded by his words.\u00a0Who do you think you are? Innovated a bit? But to be honest, the combat skills did become much more powerful.Jiang Qin asked, \u201cWhat about Blood Boiling?\u201dHan Fei explained, \u201cThat stuff is useless! I tried using it, but I felt I was almost roasted. How could I still fight with others in such a state? So I changed it too. I split spiritual energy into bits, covered my internal organs with them, and made them jump with my insides\u2026 Well, guess what, I did grow stronger as they jumped with my insides, although I felt a little bit uncomfortable.\u201dOld Jiang wiped the sweat off his face with his sleeve.\u00a0Are you kidding me? Wrap internal organs with spiritual energy. I hadn\u2019t even thought of that, but you just went ahead and did it?Old Jiang was curious about the next move. \u201cI can guess how you\u2019ll explain your last move\u2026 You poured all your spiritual energy into the machete and made the spiritual energy explode as soon as the machete touched your enemy, right? How did you come up with that?\u201dHan Fei had no problem explaining this one too. \u201cI just wanted to increase my combat power. Isn\u2019t stronger combat power better in combat?\u201dOld Jiang wasn\u2019t sold on this one. \u201cBullshit, although this trick is not bad, what if you failed to kill your enemy? Or if you had more than one enemy? How many enemies can you kill with one slash?\u201dHan Fei wanted to scratch his head, but his arm hurt a little, so he gave up on the idea. But he thought to himself,\u00a0Although my body can only withstand 400 points of spiritual energy, there is no upper limit! When the spiritual energy in my body is used up, I can replenish it easily. What am I afraid of?\u201cYou\u2026 Take a good rest. Except for Gusty Rod, you can\u2019t rashly use the other combat skills,\u201d Jiang Qin instructed.\u201cBut what should I do next? I mean the soul warrior thing.\u201dJiang Qin said, \u201cWait a few days.\u201dOne day later, Han Fei recovered. He wanted to go to sea, but he was banned from going to sea for three months and his boat was also confiscated, so he had to give up this plan.The barbecue stall alone could not meet his demands. After more than a month, he only got 80,000 points of spiritual energy from the barbecue stall. After refining knives, deducing combat skills, and training, now he only had 68,000 points or so left.Were they many? There seemed to be many, but actually not many at all. There was the peak level above level nine. Only when he broke through to the peak level could he continue to break through to be a fishing master. Now he was ready to break through to the peak level and his spiritual energy had reached the limit of 419. But what about the next breakthrough? These points of spiritual energy were certainly not enough for him to break through to be a fishing master.\u201cGrandpa, I\u2019ll take leave for a few days!\u201dOld Jiang was curious as he asked, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cWell, I have serious business to tend to.\u201dBefore Old Jiang responded, Han Fei had left and gone to his secret small cave.Three days later.Han Fei strolled casually to the barbecue stall to absorb spiritual energy, but when he arrived at the barbecue stall, he found that no one was standing in line.\u201cA-Gang, where are the customers?\u201dWhen Li Gang saw Han Fei coming, he burst into tears and said, \u201cYoung Master, we are gonna go broke! Now no one dares to buy our barbecue.\u201dLi Qing joined the barbecue stall a month ago. He said gloomily, \u201cYoung Master, it\u2019s the Tigers. They threatened people, whoever dared to buy our barbecue, they would kill them.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHan Fei burst with anger in an instant.\u00a0Cutting off my barbecue-stall business was equivalent to cutting off my source of spiritual energy! Shit, is Li Jue formally declaring war against me?Han Fei left without any hesitation carrying his rod.Li Gang hurriedly stopped him. \u201cYoung Master, what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cWhat else can I do? I\u2019m going to f*ck up Li Jue, that old bastard.\u201dLi Gang: \u201c\u2026\u201dLi Qing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYoung Master, please don\u2019t do that. I heard that\u2026 Li Jue has recovered!\u201d Li Gang begged.Li Qing added, \u201cIt may be true. After all, the Tigers are very rich. It\u2019s said that Li Jue has bought a lot of supplemental medicines this month and even sent his men to the sea to find spiritual fruits. He seems to have got something.\u201dHan Fei didn\u2019t care. \u201cHumph! So what? Has he broken through to be a Great Fishing Master? How dare he provoke me like this?\u201d\u201cYoung Master, although Li Jue is not yet a Great Fishing Master, his strength is already at the peak of a fishing master. I\u2019m afraid his strength is already quite close to that of a Great Fishing Master,\u201d Li Qing warned.Han Fei clenched his fist.\u00a0He wants to cut off the source of my spiritual energy. How can I bear this?Han Fei took a deep breath and calmed down. \u201cHow did the Tigers threaten us?\u201dLi Gang sighed. \u201cThey just stood right in front of our booth and stopped people from buying our barbecue. They even had their men guard the stall. Look, the two guys over there are their men. Once a customer comes, they will threaten him.\u201dHan Fei turned his head and found there were two people staring at him indeed.\u201cHaha!\u201dHan Fei went straight to them and pointed Purple Bamboo Rod at the two. \u201cAre you from the Tigers?\u201dOne of them ignored Han Fei and snorted.The other said, \u201cYes! Do you dare to hit me?\u201dBAM!The next second, one of them was kicked away, and seeing this scene, the other was about to run away, only to be hit on the head and he fell to the ground. Both of them vomited blood.\u201cYou, you, how dare you be engaged in a fight on the floating island\u2026 Law Enforcement Team, Law Enforcement Team\u2026\u201dHan Fei mocked them, \u201cNow you remember the Law Enforcement Team? Weren\u2019t you on your high horse a moment ago?\u201dHan Fei wasn\u2019t afraid at all. Anyway, I\u2019m now banned from going to sea. It was not a big deal for me to hit one or two hooligans.BAM\u2026Han Fei jumped over and beat the two of them up. Stepping on the head of one, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re from the Tigers, aren\u2019t you? Now I\u2019ve kept your faces in mind. Next time I meet you at sea, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\u201cWho dares to start a fight at the fair?\u201dA group of law enforcement team members came from a distance, led by a fishing master, who shouted to Han Fei coldly.Han Fei kicked the person under his feet away and smiled at the fishing master. \u201cIt\u2019s me, but these two men threatened my customers. Now no one dares to buy anything from my stall, so I gave them a little punishment. Did I break the law, Sir?\u201dThe fishing master looked at Han Fei and asked, \u201cAre you Han Fei?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe fishing master shook his head slightly. \u201cThe floating island will only maintain the order of the floating island. Forgive me for not being able to control their behaviors in fisheries, but fights are forbidden on the floating island. We won\u2019t punish you this time, but don\u2019t do it again!\u201dHan Fei immediately smiled. \u201cSir, is that to say, the Tigers can threaten anyone here and kill those who don\u2019t obey them at fisheries and you won\u2019t do anything about it?\u201dThe fishing master remained silent, which meant that what he said was right.Han Fei turned around and asked Li Qing, \u201cLi Qing, what businesses are the Tigers running on the floating Island?\u201dLi Qing answered, \u201cThey are running dozens of casinos, fish stalls, and bait shops.\u201d\u201cTake me to their shops one by one.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Yes, Young Master.\u201dThe fishing master frowned and shouted in a low voice, \u201cHan Fei, don\u2019t go too far.\u201dHan Fei turned around and grinned at him. \u201cSir, I promise I won\u2019t hurt anyone unless someone hurts me first.\u201dWith that, his face went cold and he left.Behind the fishing master, a member of the team said, \u201cMaster Wu, isn\u2019t this Han Fei too arrogant?\u201dWu Chen narrowed his eyes. \u201cHan Fei seems to be confident. He is not a pushover. These two people are both at the peak of level nine but almost had no power to fight back\u2026 Did he get some sort of special opportunity?\u201dWu Chen believed that Han Fei got this special opportunity because of Tang Ge. Otherwise, how could Han Fei have upgraded to level nine so fast?Wu Chen waved his hand. \u201cFollow him. Just make sure that no fight breaks out. The Tigers are a bunch of villains and don\u2019t need our protection at all. Let\u2019s just remain neutral.\u201d\u2026A casino of the Tigers.Li Qing led Han Fei to one of the casinos owned by the Tigers. \u201cYoung Master, here it is.\u201dSomeone immediately recognized Li Qing and shouted, \u201cLi Qing, you traitor, how do you have the nerve to come here?\u201dLi Qing snorted coldly without speaking.Han Fei brushed them off. \u201cGo away, I\u2019m going to bet some money today!\u201dThe two refused to make way for him. Han Fei\u2019s face went cold. \u201cWhat? Am I not your guest? If you don\u2019t let me in, shut down this casino.\u201dThe two men frowned, and in the end, they let him in. What they thought was that if Han Fei wanted to gamble here, why not let him. Anyway, if he lost money here, he asked for it.But less than a minute after Han Fei walked in, they heard a loud noise from inside. It seemed that something was smashed.Wu Chen\u2019s face changed. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside.\u201dThe law enforcement team walked in, only to see that Han Fei had smashed all the gambling tables with the Purple Bamboo Rod. He was surrounded by five or six members of the Tigers who were wary as if facing a formidable enemy.Han Fei casually cast a glance at Wu Chen. \u201cMaster Wu, I didn\u2019t hit anyone, I just smashed some things. I\u2019ll pay them back. You know, I\u2019m rich\u2026 A-Gang, where is the money?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How could you only leave a mid-quality pearl?BAM!Purple Bamboo Rod flashed in Han Fei\u2019s hands, and Han Fei suddenly smashed the furnishings in the casino with a spiritual energy explosion attack.Someone shouted angrily, \u201cHan Fei, you are looking for death!\u201d\u201cHaha, Li Jue, you old bastard, come out! If fights weren\u2019t forbidden on the floating island, your blood would have been dry by now.\u201dSomeone sneered, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for that, do you think you could have lived to this day?\u201dHan Fei smiled. \u201cJust call Li Jue out. I\u2019ve killed his son and sooner or later I\u2019ll kill him too.\u201dWu Chen frowned. \u201cHan Fei, calm down. Even if you smash the casino, so what? These things will be replaced soon.\u201dHan Fei said as a matter of factly, \u201cThen I\u2019ll smash them again. How dare they touch my barbecue stall! I just return like for like.\u201dWu Chen didn\u2019t know what to say. In his opinion, Han Fei was not a domineering person. Why did he suddenly become like this, even though his protector, Tang Ge had been gone? He had smashed six stores in a row before their very eyes, but this casino was different. It was guarded by a fishing master.Li Qing whispered to Han Fei. \u201cThis is Li Dao from the Tigers. His strength is at the peak of a junior fishing master. He is quite strong.\u201d\u201cOK, keep smashing the casino!\u201dLi Qing: \u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone else: \u201c\u2026\u201dLi Dao roared, \u201cHan Fei, don\u2019t push me. If you leave right away, I will let you off. Otherwise, I\u2019ll teach you a good lesson.\u201dHan Fei raised the Purple Bamboo Rod in his hand. \u201cI, Han Fei, challenge you today. Do you dare to accept my challenge?\u201dBuzz\u2026Li Qing and Li Gang only felt a buzz in their heads.Wu Chen\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0You, a level-nine fisher, challenge a fishing master? Do you want to die?\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dLi Dao laughed as if hearing the funniest joke in the world. Although there were rumors that Han Fei killed Li Lang, it was not yet known how Li Lang died. After all, it was at sea. Anything could happen at sea at night. But now, Han Fei was challenging him on the floating island! Only God knows who gave him this courage.Li Dao smiled. \u201cI was trying to work out a way to catch and kill you, but you\u2019ve simply sent yourself to me. If I don\u2019t accept your challenge, people will laugh at me! Let\u2019s fight then.\u201dWu Chen felt nervous. \u201cHan Fei, you\u2019d better give it a second thought. This is not a joke. If you lose, no one can help you.\u201d\u201cI, lose? In my life, I have never lost.\u201dEveryone was speechless. Why are you still bragging at this time? You have never lost because people were afraid that they would beat you to death!Some people started to hoot, especially the members of the Tigers. Many people wanted Li Dao to torture Han Fei hard.\u2026There was an open space respectively in the north, south, east, and west of the floating island. With some sparse trees in these open spaces, they were originally used as training grounds for fishing skills. But at the moment, a large group of people came to the east training ground.The shocking news that a fisher challenged a fishing master quickly spread, and there were more and more people coming to watch. Soon, the training ground became tightly packed with people.Wu Chen was the witness of this challenge. He looked at Han Fei with a complex look.Li Dao asked, \u201cCan we start?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m ready to crush your head anytime.\u201dWu Chen gave the official order, \u201cStart.\u201dHan Fei immediately launched a spiritual energy explosion attack with his Purple Bamboo Rod. Li Dao smiled coldly. This brat wants to play spiritual energy explosion attacks with me? Do you really think this lame combat skill can hurt me?BAM!In an instant, Li Dao\u2019s hands went numb. His face changed greatly. The blow was really powerful! In terms of power, this guy\u2019s strength was already comparable to that of a fishing master.However, Li Dao sneered, \u201cPhysical strength is not important in combat. Thousand Shadow Rod, kill!\u201dHan Fei had seen this Thousand Shadow Rod. He had selected this combat skill from the village library, but Jiang Qin threw it away.Han Fei almost laughed.\u00a0What makes you believe you can move faster than me?Han Fei activated the Crazy Devil\u2019s Rod. With a chuckle, he jumped over like a gust of wind.Clang! Clang! Clang!Han Fei and Li Dao were fighting fiercely with an extremely fast speed. All the audience could see were shadows of rods, which dazzled their eyes.Li Dao\u2019s face changed drastically. He can keep up with his speed! And why does he have such great power in every blow?BAM\u2026Li Dao couldn\u2019t keep up with Han Fei\u2019s speed anymore. Suddenly, his chest was poked and his face was hit by the Purple Bamboo Rod. He was sent flying through the air, half of his face was dented, and his cheekbones were cracked.\u201cDamn\u2026 Fuse!\u201dEveryone was astounded. Come on, you\u2019re a fishing master! Does a fishing master need to fuse with his spiritual beast in a fight with a fisher?Wu Chen was also dumbfounded, but he was really shocked by Han Fei\u2019s strength.\u00a0Is he really a level-nine fisher?Li Dao dared not look down upon Han Fei again. This was a life-or-death battle. If he didn\u2019t take his enemy seriously, he might be killed.A fat black fish suddenly rushed into Li Dao\u2019s body. His momentum suddenly increased and he roared and pounced at Han Fei.Someone shouted, \u201cWatch out! Iron-Headed Fish has iron-like skin and bones. Now the hardness of his body has increased by at least 30%.\u201dHan Fei murmured, \u201cOh, 30%?\u201d\u201cFury!\u201dEveryone was surprised to see that Han Fei\u2019s body suddenly inflated, the blue veins on his body stood out, and his eyes turned bloodshot.BAM!Li Dao was sent flying again, faster than the last time. Blood was gushing out of his mouth when he was still in mid-air. He asked himself,\u00a0Why did Han Fei suddenly become so strong?Before Li Dao hit the ground, he saw a rod flying at his head. Li Dao turned pale with fright, but what could he do in mid-air?Clang\u2026Li Dao fell heavily to the ground and his face was almost smashed by the rod. Although he had fused with his Iron-Headed Fish, he still could not withstand such a violent blow. The hardness of his body was improved by 30% after he fused with his spiritual beast, whereas Han Fei doubled his strength when he activated Fury. It was as plain as daylight which one was stronger.Han Fei pierced Li Dao\u2019s chest with the Purple Bamboo Rod. Then he shouted at the members of the Tiger who were scared out of their pants. \u201cTell Li Jue that I will send him to see his son soon. Tell him to wait.\u201dThen Han Fei\u2019s face twitched and his body seemed to be deflated. He changed back to his original appearance.\u201cHu\u2026\u201dHan Fei stumbled and almost fell. Fortunately, the battle ended quickly. It seemed that he still couldn\u2019t control Fury very well because this combat skill was too strong.Li Gang and Li Qing were stupefied at what they saw. Seeing Han Fei stumble, they quickly stepped forward to help Han Fei stand up.Everyone present was shocked. A fisher killed a fishing master, which happened for the first time in the Heavenly Water Village. Not only did Han Fei kill Li Dao, he was not injured at all, not even had his skin been scratched. What kind of a monster-like talent did he have?\u2026The Tigers.Li Jue\u2019s eyes flickered with a cold gleam.\u201cDid Han Fei kill Li Dao?\u201d\u201cYes, Leader, I saw it with my own eyes, but Han Fei seems to use a secret technique. Although he killed Li Dao, his spiritual energy seemed to be exhausted.\u201dLi Jue narrowed his eyes.\u00a0Han Fei must die! At first, he killed Li Lang and then Li Dao. Two fishing masters of the Tigers have been killed by him. This guy is growing too fast.\u00a0He even wondered if Han Fei had hidden the true level of his spiritual heritage. Otherwise, how could he be growing so fast?\u2026At the village leader\u2019s home.\u201cWhat? Han Fei killed a fishing master?\u201dThe village leader was stunned.\u00a0Did Old Jiang teach him some powerful combat skills?\u00a0That could explain it. Old Jiang was the most mysterious person in Heavenly Water Village, and also the only one who he couldn\u2019t see through or defeat. Han Fei was really lucky. Was this the reason Han Fei refused to go to the town?\u2026On this day, no matter the East or West Fair, the entire floating island was talking about this matter. This was the biggest event in the Heavenly Water Village for decades. A fisher killed a fishing master! No one had ever heard of it before.Late at night.Han Fei asked Li Qing, \u201cWhere is the treasure house of the Tigers?\u201dLi Qing hurriedly stopped Han Fei. \u201cYoung Master, you\u2019d better not go there. That is heavily guarded by the Tigers. Not only fishing masters, but also at least dozens of peak-level fishers are guarding this place. If anyone intrudes, Li Jue will soon arrive in person. The consequences are unpredictable!\u201dHan Fei retorted, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid? I certainly won\u2019t just break into it. I just want to observe the terrain and wait for a proper chance. Don\u2019t waste my time, just tell me!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s at\u2026\u201dAfter Li Qing left, Han Fei sneered.\u00a0Li Jue, do you want to cut off my source of wealth and spiritual energy? Fine, I\u2019ll take all your treasure first.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do not leave behind anything you can carry. Understood?\u201dLittle Black rubbed intimately against Han Fei\u2019s face and flew out.Han Fei was surprised.\u00a0Was a spiritual beast a fish or a soul? If he was a fish, why could he fly in the air without water? But if he was a soul, he could also swim in the water, eat, and bite people to death.Han Fei was lying in the woods in the distance and waiting motionless, turning into the same color as the vegetation.After a while, Little Black came out with a small bottle in his mouth. Han Fei opened the bottle and found it was a bottle of Spirit Refilling Pills.\u201cUmm, not bad.\u201dSeeing that Little Black didn\u2019t go but remained staring at the Spirit Refilling Pill, Han Fei reluctantly poured a pill out of the bottle and threw it in his mouth. Little Black flew away in satisfaction.The second time, Little Black brought back a money bag with nearly a hundred mid-quality pearls in it. Han Fei wasn\u2019t quite satisfied.\u00a0My barbecue stall has earned me lots of money. This money is nothing to me. But fine, it\u2019s money anyway!Han Fei felt he had to say something when Little Black brought him more than a dozen of these money bags in a row.\u201cLittle Black, let\u2019s steal something else. This stuff can\u2019t be eaten. The spiritual energy inside is little and not easy to use. Go steal something with spiritual energy or value, such as small bottles and small boxes\u2026\u201dLittle Black shuttled quickly. Han Fei calculated that it would take him about five minutes to make the round trip. It had only been one hour or so and the guards were still eating sea melon seeds together.Five minutes later, Little Black brought him a small box. Han Fei opened it.\u00a0Wow! A spiritual fruit!\u00a0Because it was too fragrant, Han Fei immediately closed the box.Han Fei instructed, \u201cLittle Black, just steal this. Steal as many as there are.\u201dTo Han Fei\u2019s disappointment, however, there were only two such spiritual fruits, which made him very unhappy. Li Qing said that Li Jue had sent a lot of people to find spiritual fruit. How could he only get two?Little did Han Fei know that where there were spiritual fruit, there would be a strong guardian beast. The sea dragon he encountered last time was not something ordinary people could deal with. To get the two Spiritual Fruit in his hands, the Tigers had lost dozens of members. If Li Jue knew that his spiritual fruits were stolen, he would have vomited blood in anger.The next day.\u201cRoar\u2026\u201d\u201cYou bunch of wastes! Who robbed my treasure house?\u201dLi Jue was going crazy. All the small things inside were gone and there wasn\u2019t even a single jelly bean left. The big ones such as weapons were left, but there were rows of teeth marks on them. Some weapons even disappeared, but who the f*ck would eat weapons?Now Han Fei was sitting at home happily turning over the treasure he had got from the Tigers, which filled a whole pocket. The two spiritual fruits alone were worth a lot of money, not to mention there were so many other things.\u201cThree bottles of Spirit Refilling Pills and Little Black ate half a bottle. There are still 7,500 points of spiritual energy left. Not bad.\u201d\u201c1,314 mid-quality pearls. The Tigers are really poor. Did they commit so many crimes just to collect such a small amount of money?\u201dIn fact, unknown to Han Fei, there was a whole trunk of mid-quality pearls in the treasure house, but Little Black was unable to carry it.\u201c27 bottles of Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid. The Tigers are damn rich to have so much of this fluid! It is priceless, especially when you want to condition your body.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWow! A treasure map!\u201dHan Fei was stunned and immediately pulled all the other stuff aside. Finding a treasure map in a box, he was beside himself with excitement.Han Fei smoothed out the fish skin on the table, and a small map appeared. The central area of the map was the floating island, below which were ordinary fisheries, but what was painted on the map was not the sea surface but the underwater terrain. There were many places marked on the map.Coral Reefs, Snake Caves, Undersea Stone Caves, Spirit Absorbing Jellyfish Settlements, and dozens of other places were on the map. Among them, three places were marked as \u201cDangerous.\u201dOne was a Spirit Absorbing Jellyfish Settlement, one was an Undersea Stone Cave, and the other was a Boat Burying Pit.Among these three places, only the name \u201cBoat Burying Pit\u201d was drawn in a circle.Han Fei frowned. He hadn\u2019t heard of any of these places, but from these names, he could tell these places were not common ones.\u00a0Boat Burying Pit? More than one ship must have sunk there. But why did ships sink to that place? Could it be that there was a magnetic field problem like Bermuda there? No, if there was a problem with the magnetic field, people must have found out about it. Who dared to go to ordinary fisheries then?Han Fei thought to himself, Li Jue must have explored this place, but he survived by a fluke. Otherwise, how would he know that there were a lot of fishing boats sinking in that place?The next day.Han Fei went to Li Qing.\u201cUncle Qing, do you know where the Boat Burying Pit is?\u201dLi Qing immediately turned pale and he quickly said, \u201cYoung Master, you must not go there! It\u2019s very dangerous!\u201dSeeing Li Qing\u2019s reaction, Han Fei had already had a rough idea in his heart and said, \u201cJust tell me, I\u2019m still banned from going to sea for two months.\u201dLi Qing was relieved to hear that but he still looked a little frightened. \u201cYoung Master, there are actually a lot of dangers even in ordinary fisheries. People just don\u2019t know about them. The most dangerous place in our fisheries is this Boat Burying Pit. It\u2019s said that dozens of fishing boats disappear there every year. Young Master, do you know where the wounds on Leader\u2026 Uh, no, on Li Jue\u2019s body and face came from?\u201dHan Fei raised an eyebrow. \u201cHe got those scars in this Boat Burying Pit?\u201dLi Qing replied, \u201cYes, Li Jue was already an Advanced Fishing Master at that time. Although he had not yet reached the peak, he was not far from it. He heard that several of his ships disappeared there, so he started to investigate in person. However, you know what, he returned with serious injuries only fifteen minutes later and none of the people he took with him came back. At that time, he had at least hundreds of wounds on his body. Although he had a narrow escape, the scars on his face and body could never be removed.\u201dHan Fei quickly went on asking, \u201cDid he get his Tiger-Head Fish there?\u201dLi Qing paused and then shook his head. \u201cNo! He got that Tiger-Head Fish from the Spirit Absorbing Jellyfish Settlement. But you shouldn\u2019t go there either, Young Master. There are not many people fishing in that water. This Spirit Absorbing Jellyfish is also sold in the fair, but very few people bought it. It will absorb the spirit energy of other fishes. People who go to sea will easily have their spiritual energy sucked up by the jellyfish and die in the sea. At that time, Li Jue took more than 20 people to explore that place but only 7 of them came back. Fortunately, he was paid back and got his Tiger-Head Fish.\u201dHan Fei nodded and asked, \u201cDo you know where the Undersea Stone Cave is?\u201dLi Qing was puzzled and shook his head. \u201cIs it at the bottom of ordinary fisheries? I have never heard of it!\u201d\u201cOkay! I\u2019m afraid that the barbecue stall is going out of business right now. You and A-Gang can take a rest, stay at home, drink and have fun. Don\u2019t go outside.\u201d\u201cYes, Boss.\u201dOn the way back to the plantation, Han Fei thought about it.\u00a0There must be an opportunity in the Spirit Absorbing Jellyfish Settlement. It may have been inhabited by a Tiger-Head Fish but that fish was taken away by Li Jue. There can\u2019t be any other opportunities\u2026 Otherwise, Li Jue would definitely have returned for the second time.But he wasn\u2019t sure whether Li Jue had ever been in the Undersea Stone Cave or not. There were only two possibilities. One was that he hadn\u2019t been there and the other was that he had been there but found no opportunity. If it was the latter, then at least people could return safely from that place. But if it was the former, Li Jue didn\u2019t go there because of something he feared. Then it was worthy of his vigilance.But Han Fei was not afraid.\u00a0That\u2019s treasure! How can a treasure hunt not be dangerous? But are treasure-hunters afraid? Have I ever been afraid? No, all treasure hunters are full of adventurous spirit in their bones, and they all gamble with their lives.Hmm, there must be a great chance in the Boat Burying Pit. I must go to this place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2026\u201cSister Qin, can you do me a favor?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHan Fei looked over at her. \u201cCan you lift the ban on me? I haven\u2019t gone to sea in more than a month and I feel suffocated.\u201dJiang Qin didn\u2019t think this was a good idea just yet. \u201cNo way! Li Jue\u2019s strength has been restored. If you go to sea, he may go to kill you. Don\u2019t overestimate your strength. Li Jue is not easy to deal with. You can\u2019t kill him yet.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t let him know that I\u2019ve gone to sea, and I\u2019ll come back quickly. Don\u2019t forget that I have the fishing boat that Fang Ze gave me! Can Li Jue\u2019s boats catch up with mine?\u201dJiang Qin was not convinced. \u201cDon\u2019t even think of it! What you should do now is cultivation. Make the breakthrough to be a fishing master and I\u2019ll let you go.\u201dHan Fei was upset.\u00a0Do you think I don\u2019t want to make a breakthrough? But I can\u2019t do it without enough spiritual energy!Han Fei sighed. He was frequently engaged in fights recently, so his spiritual energy was consumed very quickly. He had taken all the Spirit Refilling Pills and spiritual fruits that he got from the Tigers. However, including his own spiritual energy, he only had less than 60,000 points of spiritual energy, which was certainly not enough for him to break through to be a fishing master. According to the law of Void Fishing, he needed at least 50,000 points of spiritual energy to break through the bottleneck, and then he had to rebuild his body and push himself to the peak of a junior fishing master. He would need much more spiritual energy than 50,000 points.That night.All was quiet.Han Fei slipped out and headed for the port. His white fishing boat was still impounded there, hanging in the middle of the cliff of the floating island.There was a team of people on duty at the port who were chatting while eating sea melon seeds. All of a sudden, they heard a sound and it seemed that something had been knocked over.\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go check it out.\u201dHan Fei walked over quickly from the other side. As soon as he walked through, someone looked at this side and almost found him. Fortunately, at the moment, Han Fei was hanging himself on the edge of the cliff, which most people dared not to do because if he fell, he would definitely die.Humph! Ban me from going to sea? For what? This time I\u2019ll stay at the sea\u2026 For at least five days and nights.Next, Han Fei drove a stolen fishing boat to find his own boat. After a while, Han Fei had gone to sea. He shouted in joy and excitement.\u201cHaha! I\u2019m finally free. You want to ban me from going to sea? Impossible!\u201d\u2026In the plantation.Old Jiang questioned, \u201cWhy did you let the boy go to sea?\u201d\u201cHe has secrets. Can\u2019t you see that he hates being cooped up on land,\u201d Jiang Qin speculated.\u201cHa! He\u2019d better pray to God not to be killed on the sea. Isn\u2019t it satisfying just to be a spirit gatherer? Why does he have to get into all this trouble?\u201dOf course, Han Fei could not hear them at the moment. He was carrying a treasure map in his hand and was determining which direction to head.\u201cHere we are!\u201dHalf an hour later, Han Fei stopped, nervous and excited.\u00a0So does my treasure hunt start again?Han Fei was very excited. He had more methods than Li Jue and he was confident that he was also stronger than him. Besides, he had Wandering Dragon Art. Even if there was a danger, he would be able to escape!Han Fei was excited, he summoned Little Black and Little White, and they jumped into the sea with a flop. After more than a month of feeding, Little Black and Little White had upgraded to level 6 and could already hunt almost all the fish species in level-one fisheries.After a while, Han Fei climbed onto the boat from the sea, scratching his head while gazing at the treasure map.\u201cHuh? There is no shipwreck below. Did I go in the wrong direction? Li Jue, you idiot, why didn\u2019t you mark the directions? What a waste of my time!\u201dHalf an hour later.Han Fei shouted at Little Black, \u201cAre you ready? Let\u2019s advance to the treasure.\u201dFLOPIt was pitch dark underwater but Han Fei was not afraid at all. He had reached the peak of fisher, so his eyes could already adapt to most of the dark waters.Huh? There are still a lot of fishes here. Did I run in the wrong direction again?Thirty metres underwater, Han Fei saw a Snakebelt as long as four or five metres. His eyelids twitched.\u00a0What a big Snakebelt! I can\u2019t believe my eyes!\u201cLittle Black, eat him.\u201dHan Fei continued to dive, but the further he went down, the fewer fish he found. For some reason, his heart was pounding.Is something staring at me? But I don\u2019t see anything!When he continued to dive for 30 metres, he felt a chill down his spine. What caught his eye was a long trench less than 10 metres wide. Its depth was unknown. On both sides of the trench, there were shipwrecks all over the place, so densely packed that they could not be counted.At this very moment, Han Fei felt his wrists ache. Did his calabash feel something?Huh?Han Fei blinked and initiated the Eyes of True Vision. Then he saw that the spiritual energy here was exceptionally rich, especially in the trench, in which the spiritual energy was so abundant that it was about to overflow.Wow! Treasure!Han Fei was overjoyed. Yes, he found it!At this time, Little Black had already killed the Snakebelt. Han Fei waved, motioning Little Black to go into the trench and explore it. The trench was so narrow. Once an unknown event occurred, it was not easy for him to run away, so he\u2019d better be careful.At the same time, Han Fei fell carefully on a sunken ship. Soaking in the water all year round, the hull of the ship had almost been covered by dark green water plants, so it was a bit slippery to step on.There were many pieces of human bones near the shipwreck. Obviously, these people had died long ago. Many bones were broken, which seemed to be caused by battering.\u201cHiss\u2026\u201dHuh?Han Fei quickly turned around, held the Purple Bamboo Rod in his hand, and flew off the shipwreck instantly. The next moment, he saw a two-metre-long crab appear on the shipwreck.Damn, an XL Green Crab?\u201cHiu\u2026\u201dSomething attacked him and Han Fei immediately counterattacked. With a clang, he was beaten back several metres. He turned around, only to see another large Blade Fish three to four metres long.Almost instantaneously, Han Fei filled his body with spiritual energy and swiftly approached the fish. Then he thrust a knife into the head of the fish and sent it to hell. At the same time, he quickly left.\u201cStrange, the creatures here are all huge\u2026\u201dHan Fei stared closely at where the Blade Fish fell. After one or two minutes, a crab claw appeared, followed by several huge Green Crabs. As they gathered and tore open the Blade Fish\u2019s body, many more large Green Crabs crawled out of the wreck nearby.Han Fei felt his blood freeze and he tried to comfort himself.\u00a0It\u2019s OK. They\u2019re just a little bigger. How about Little Black over there?Suddenly, Little White swam to the trench quickly.\u201cLittle White, come back!\u201dHan Fei was anxious.\u00a0Is Little Black in danger? But what kind of a creature can find Little Black and kill him?Han Fei looked around. Although there were a lot of big Green Crabs out there, very few of them crawled into the trench.Let me try my fortune!Han Fei was not afraid when entering the trench. He was used to crossing submarine caves without wearing oxygen masks. He knew the characteristics of fish. They might hunt things they were familiar with and only a small part of them that were very aggressive were interested in strange creatures like humans. Of course, he was not sure about the fish here.The shallowest part of the trench was not deep and only as deep as about 50 metres. But as Han Fei dove all the way down, he found the deepest part here was close to 300 metres. Han Fei was quite proud. If it were before, how could he directly descend to a water zone 90 metres deep?The bottom of the trench was also covered with sunken ships, some of which were upside down. Han Fei stood on the shipwreck and gaped. He actually saw a huge cave at the bottom of the trench.From the top, it seemed that the bottom of the trench was as narrow as its opening, but now it didn\u2019t seem to be the case at all. The underwater cave at the bottom of the trench seemed to lead to a distant and unknown place. It seemed that the internal space was not small, but Han Fei didn\u2019t act rashly.Little White revolved around Han Fei and went to the cave from time to time as if beckoning Han Fei to go inside.\u201cNo hurry. Let me check it out.\u201dHan Fei took out the fishing rod behind his back, fastened a dagger to the fish hook with a fishing line, and shot it into the cave. As soon as the dagger went into the cave less than 30 metres, a monster suddenly jumped out of the sand at the bottom and pounced at the dagger.Han Fei was astounded. Thank God he didn\u2019t act rashly. Otherwise, he would definitely get snipped.He quickly withdrew the fishing line and the monster jumped up and chased the dagger. Not only that, Han Fei also noticed the surrounding sand bulge and there seemed to be something about to move.\u201cHa! I\u2019d like to see what it is.\u201dWhen the thing broke through the sand and revealed its full body, Han Fei ejected himself backwards immediately and floated up. What did he see? The two or three metre long stuff was not a fish at all but an ultra-large Mantis Shrimp!Shit\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMantis Shrimp CubTenRegular111 pointsIts flesh is exceptionally delicious. Eating its flesh for a long time can build up your body. And eating Mantis Shrimp Beads can quickly strengthen your physical strength.Mantis Shrimp BeadsHan Fei was relieved to see that the shrimp was only at level ten. Although a level-ten shrimp was the strongest in ordinary fisheries, it wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt him, but was this only a cub? A cub with such a gigantic body? Then how big was an adult Mantis Shrimp?As he expected, the Mantis Shrimp began to chase him. His front claws were as long as two metres when they were fully opened.Clang\u2026He swung the Purple Bamboo Rod at the shrimp and hit the forearm of the Mantis Shrimp that attacked him at the same time. He struck first because only people who had gone to sea knew how strong a Mantis Shrimp\u2019s attack power was. His instantaneous explosive power could enable him to break a crab\u2019s claw with one blow. At the moment a Mantis Shrimp attacked, its speed, explosive power, and attack power would instantly reach their peak state.To Han Fei\u2019s surprise, however, this Mantis Shrimp only backed away a few metres and then shook its head. His two oval eyes stood up and stared at Han Fei.What strong defensive power! But I don\u2019t think I will lose to him.Han Fei smiled. At least this shrimp was not as strong as he imagined.Han Fei drew out a dagger and when the Mantis Shrimp punched at him, he leaned forward obliquely, narrowly dodging its attack, and at the same time thrust the dagger from his hand into the shrimp\u2019s neck, almost cutting the shrimp\u2019s head off.He kicked the Mantis Shrimp to the bottom of the sea and his heart was pounding fast. If he hadn\u2019t initiated the Wandering Dragon Art instantly just now, his head would have been hit by the shrimp\u2019s claws. At this time, a group of Mantis Shrimps had gathered around. Han Fei frowned. How could he pass with so many Mantis Shrimps in his way?Wait a minute\u2026 Although this creature loves to fight, I don\u2019t have to fight them myself!Han Fei immediately swam up. At this moment, a group of large Green Crabs was still watching with their eyes up. When they saw Han Fei rushing out, they lifted their claws one after another.Han Fei glanced around, found a large Green Turtle, and rushed straight over.BAM!The Green Turtle was knocked to death by Han Fei before he had any time to react. Han Fei took out his dagger, cut a dozen wounds on the Green Turtle, and then dragged it to the crabs.Lured by food, more and more big Green Crabs gathered up. Han Fei hit the claws of the big Green Crabs with his Purple Bamboo Rod from a distance and then swam away quickly.Soon, hundreds of big Green Crabs began to chase after him. If they could talk, they would have shouted, \u201cYou are dead meat! How dare you tempt us with food and hit us! We\u2019re gonna crush your head with our claws!\u201dWhen they reached the trench, they didn\u2019t stop but they kept swimming in. Hundreds of Green Crabs had entered in only a short while.Han Fei thought,\u00a0Great! Cannon fodders, come on!Han Fei threw the Green Turtle into the trench and quickly swam away like a big fish.From a distance, Han Fei saw that the first big Green Crab that entered the trench was punched to pieces by the Mantis Shrimp in the blink of an eye. Oh, that\u2019s sad!Why were Mantis Shrimp\u2019s attacks described as punches? Because when Mantis Shrimp attack their enemies, they punch with their front claws just like a boxer. Only if they caught fish would they use their tongs.Now Han Fei probably understood why Li Jue went back with so many injuries. When a level-ten Mantis Shrimp was angered, no fish in the entire ordinary fisheries could resist him. Han Fei even suspected that even a big Meat Turtle wouldn\u2019t survive the attacks of a group of Mantis Shrimp.Of course, this Mantis Shrimp he saw wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt an advanced fishing master, so Han Fei guessed that there should be one or even a few more powerful Mantis Shrimp inside. He thought to himself,\u00a0If those Mantis Shrimp don\u2019t come out, I won\u2019t get in.Perhaps the smells of blood and crab roe attracted the attention of fish. From time to time, Green Turtles, Blade Fish, White Fish, and other fishes swam in along the trench.At this moment, there was a fierce battle in the trench. Han Fei saw that a Green Turtle sank to the bottom and his head was gone.\u201cWow!\u201dHan Fei was not in a hurry now. He began to absorb spiritual energy on the side. As the battle grew fiercer, spiritual energy was continuously supplied. Staying too long undersea, Han Fei had to return to the sea surface to get some fresh air.The battle lasted for almost an hour and Han Fei had absorbed at least 10,000 points of spiritual energy. When he was happily absorbing spiritual energy, the water below suddenly became cloudy, and a Blade Fish tried to escape only to be crushed by a punch.\u201cHiss\u2026\u201dWhen the water became clear again, Han Fei saw another Mantis Shrimp and a string of data appeared in front of his eyes.Mantis Shrimp King19Rare (exotic)500 pointsIts flesh is exceptionally delicious. Eating its flesh can build up your body. And eating Exotic Mantis Shrimp Beads can greatly strengthen your physical strength.Mantis Shrimp BeadsHan Fei was silent. A level-19 Mantis Shrimp King, this was the real reason that Li Jue came back with serious injuries. Although the data showed that the shrimp was only at level 19, Han Fei felt that the Sea Dragon he fought last time was a piece of cake in front of this Mantis Shrimp King. The latter would be able to crush the former\u2019s head with a single punch.Damn! This thing is too big! I can\u2019t beat him!Han Fei\u2019s eyes were shining. The fight between big Green Crabs and the Mantis Shrimp had almost finished, and body parts were scattered everywhere. The fish nearby had almost been killed off by the shrimp. Now the gigantic Mantis Shrimp King was chewing a Blade Fish.What a pity! If only I hadn\u2019t eaten the spiritual fruits stolen from the Tigers. If I take them out, they will definitely attract a lot of large Green Crabs and fishes.Huh? Spiritual energy\u2026 If I cultivate here\u2026 No, the Mantis Shrimp King will kill me\u2026 Or, should I attract some more fish to come here?Han Fei hadn\u2019t tried to cultivate in the sea before, neither had anyone else in the Heavenly Water Village. He forcibly took Little Black back and swam a few kilometres away before stopping.Han Fei asked the fish, \u201cWhere did you go? Guard my side and allow no creatures to come near me.\u201dWhen he initiated Void Fishing, he was shocked. The spiritual energy didn\u2019t come from the sky but from all directions.Soon, countless large Green Crabs, Sea Snails, Rotating Starfish, and Blade Fish swarmed one after another.Han Fei felt something bump into him and then bump again.He opened his eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to allow any creatures to come near me? Shit!\u201dSeeing countless fish and crabs coming from all directions, Han Fei immediately stopped cultivating and ran away.Little Black was stunned too.\u00a0There\u2019s too many! I can\u2019t eat them all! Sorry, Master.Just as Han Fei left, a large school of fish swarmed in, as well as countless large Green Crabs. They all dashed at him fiercely as if going to cut him to pieces with their claws.Oh, are the fishes crazy\u2026 Huh? My spiritual energy has increased by more than 400 points in such a short time?Han Fei took a deep breath. He had cultivated several times more spiritual energy on the seabed than on a fishing boat at night. No wonder it caused such a stir.\u201cLittle Black, when you get a chance, get into the shell of that big Mantis Shrimp and eat it from inside.\u201dLittle Black kept circling around Han Fei as if protesting, \u201cThe shrimp\u2019s shell is too tough for me!\u201dHan Fei patted his own chest. \u201cI\u2019ll help you. I will open a hole in the back of his head. Remember to slip into his shell from the hole and eat quickly. If you can\u2019t eat him, I\u2019ll be eaten by him.\u201dBoat Burying Pit, in the trench.Han Fei rushed directly into the trench. Now he didn\u2019t have time to keep an eye on the Mantis Shrimp King in front. What was behind him was even more terrifying.When he was about to reach the bottom of the trench, he saw that the big Mantis Shrimp King had retracted his two claws, exposing half of his body, ready to attack at any time.However, Han Fei suddenly condensed a column of spiritual energy in his hand and shot it directly at the Mantis Shrimp King.The Mantis Shrimp King was stunned. What is this strange fish doing? Why is he sending me spiritual energy?Han Fei kept grabbing one mass of spiritual energy after another from the void and stuffed them into the body of the Mantis Shrimp King. Seeing this scene, the fishes and crabs behind were all in an uproar! Wow, spiritual energy! So much spiritual energy!BAM!The fishes rushed up and rammed the Mantis Shrimp, turning the seabed dusty and sand and stones flew all over. With continuous clangs and clanks, crabs were hitting the shell of the Mantis Shrimp with their claws. But undoubtedly, they couldn\u2019t hurt him at all. It was like a group of four or five-year-olds trying to beat an 18-year-old youth. The odds of success were slim. Quantity didn\u2019t make any difference.Han Fei hid aside, no longer transmitting spiritual energy to the shrimp. Instead, he held a knife in his hand and swam tens of metres away from the Mantis Shrimp King, waiting for a chance to make a move.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIf the Mantis Shrimp King could speak, he would have definitely scolded Han Fei. \u201cWhere the f*ck did all this food come from? There\u2019s too many of them!\u201dThe Mantis Shrimp King was attacking wildly with all its legs and killed several large Green Crabs with a single punch.However, shrimp power had its limits. Although he was strong, there were too many enemies here, especially creatures like Blade Fish that were really hard to deal with. They kept darting their fin blades at them and now both of his tentacles had been broken.Han Fei took out two Spirit Refilling Pills and put them into his mouth, holding the knife in his hand and waiting for the right time.When the Mantis Shrimp King punched a large Green Crab, he exposed the part connecting his head and body. A cold gleam flickered in Han Fei\u2019s eyes and he suddenly approached him as fast as he could.\u201cFury!\u201d\u201cUniverse Machete!\u201dIn an instant, Han Fei\u2019s combat power rose to its peak. With a cold flash, he pierced the neck of the Mantis Shrimp with his knife.\u201cLittle Black, come on.\u201dHan Fei quickly retreated and swallowed two Spirit Refilling Pills. Although spiritual energy quickly returned to his body, he still felt weak all over.The Mantis Shrimp King immediately went violent, drilled out of the sand, and exposed his whole body that was as long as ten metres. As his legs twitched and punched, his gigantic body rushed forward while swarms of large Green Crabs were torn into pieces.The Mantis Shrimp King was flapping and tumbling for at least five minutes, and in the end, he trembled, reared his claws, and shot out two visible water blades. Wherever the blades cut, all fishes were dismembered.When the stirred soil settled, only dismembered corpses, cracked shells, and countless crab claws were scattered around the trench.Han Fei took a deep breath. He wondered how Li Jue survived the attack of this huge Mantis Shrimp. Even a fishing master might not be able to beat him!At this time, Little Black stuck his head out of the shell of the Mantis Shrimp and looked around. When he spotted Han Fei, he quickly slipped out and swam to him.Han Fei glanced at it and said, \u201cWell done! I\u2019ll award you when we go back.\u201dHan Fei didn\u2019t leave the trench. There were too many fish bodies here and spiritual energy was everywhere. The Demon Purification Pot on his wrist began to absorb spiritual energy. As spiritual energy flowed in, Han Fei\u2019s spiritual energy was rocketing at a speed visible to the naked eye.Haha! I should have gone to sea earlier. I\u2019ve absorbed more spiritual energy in just one hour here than I could in a month in the village.His spiritual energy value no longer rose after reaching 86,211 points as the spiritual energy here had all been absorbed by him.Han Fei was looking at the data in a daze when Little White tugged at his arm.\u201cHuh?\u201dSeeing Little White try to swim into the cave, Han Fei patted his own head.\u00a0Yes! I\u2019m here to hunt for treasure! I haven\u2019t found any treasures yet. What am I happy about?The cave was very deep. Han Fei swam as far as two kilometres, only to find that the road had come to an end.Huh? Did I reach the end?Han Fei swam upward.\u201cPu\u2026\u201dHan Fei was shocked when he rose to the surface. This was an underwater cave with an area of about 100 square metres.When he came out of the water, he saw a stone tablet with the words, \u201cAny Trespassing Fishing Master or above will Die.\u201dThe smile on Han Fei\u2019s face disappeared when he saw these words. There seemed to be a great threat in this cave.Han Fei swallowed.\u00a0I am not a fishing master yet! It should be fine if I go in!He climbed ashore, looked around, and was at once certain that someone used to cultivate here. There were a bed, a table and stools, and a large pool of five or six square metres in the cave.Han Fei\u2019s gaze followed the Mantis Shrimp\u2019s footprints, which was leading to the pool. He walked over and immediately felt a rush of spiritual energy. There was an abundance of spiritual energy here and there was a milky liquid dripping into the pool from above.Wow! The spiritual energy here is really rich! Is this pool full of liquefied spiritual energy?It was a pity that there was not much white liquid left in the pool, probably only enough to be ankle-deep. It must have been sucked away by the Mantis Shrimp King.Han Fei planned to explore the entire cave, but Little Black and Little White were already bathing cheerfully in the milky pool.Han Fei\u2019s face immediately changed. Just now, the two fishes flashed, which he had seen five or six times this month. This meant that Little Black and Little White had upgraded.Upon seeing this, Han Fei immediately sat into the pool and began to cultivate.\u00a0Shit, I finally found a treasure. How can I let the two fishes take it from me? That\u2019s unacceptable!As soon as he sat into the pool, even before he began to cultivate, he felt that spiritual energy was pouring into his body. Overjoyed, he immediately initiated Void Fishing Art.Soon, his face turned red and he felt spiritual energy rolling throughout his body. The spiritual energy flowing in the meridians was so enriched that they were burning.\u201cBreakthrough!\u201dAs Han Fei shouted, the spiritual energy in his body instantly permeated into his bones and muscles, and at the same time, the white liquid in the pool drilled into his body which was visible to the naked eye.After four or five minutes, Han Fei felt resistance.\u201cIs it the last obstacle before becoming a fishing master? Break\u2026\u201dAfter hitting dozens of times in a row, something seemed to break. Han Fei felt the jammed spiritual energy in his body instantly begin to flow smoothly. As trickles were converging and spiritual energy was gathering up like rivers flowing into the sea, his meridians became tougher, his bones clicked and his muscles bulged. There seemed to be an explosive force in his body.Han Fei knew that the breakthrough had not yet finished, and the spiritual energy was rapidly strengthening his physique.After about half an hour, Han Fei felt that his body had been rebuilt and he had reached the peak of a junior fishing master. If he was willing, he would even be able to make the next breakthrough to be an intermediate fishing master.At this moment, his face suddenly changed. He tried to stand up. If he made another breakthrough before he adapted himself to the breakthrough just now, his cultivation foundation would be undermined.\u201cWhy can\u2019t I stop?!\u201dHan Fei was a bit helpless. Void Fishing was still running automatically and oppressing him.\u201cHey! Calabash, calabash, help me\u2026 Calabash\u2026 My dear calabash\u2026\u201d\u201cLittle Black, drink, drink this pool dry\u2026\u201dLittle did he know that at this moment, Little Black and Little White were lying in the pool motionlessly and their bellies were bulging. They were too full to move.Han Fei was surprised.\u00a0Why is spiritual energy still pouring into my body even though I\u2019m not cultivating? Is it because I am sitting in this pool to cultivate?\u201cNo, my body will explode if I don\u2019t continue to make the next breakthrough.\u201dJust when Han Fei was anxious, he suddenly remembered the Forge the Universe he had that was only as large as a few square feet. Could it be expanded?Without hesitation, Han Fei kept transmitting the spiritual energy that was running in his body into Forge the Universe. To his surprise, it was expanding bit by bit and had expanded by more than 1 metre in under a minute.When the space in Forge the Universe was expanded to 10 square metres, the expansion speed immediately dropped. The garlic, peppers, and other plants he planted in it began to grow, catalyzed by the spiritual energy and soon matured.Half a day or perhaps one day later, Han Fei\u2019s Forge the Universe had expanded to nearly 50 square metres.Han Fei suddenly remembered his white fishing boat and wondered where it had drifted. After all, it had been so long and the boat should have drifted away by now. If only Forge the Universe became a rectangle! Then he could throw the ship into it.As soon as this idea popped up in his mind, he was surprised to see Forge the Universe suddenly change from a circular space into a rectangular one.\u201cWow, am I seeing this right?\u201dHan Fei froze. Could he change the shape of this space at will?With a thought from Han Fei, a pool appeared in Forge the Universe. And as he thought again, this space changed into a square.This\u2026 This is awesome! Can I conjure something up in it?Han Fei thought for a while and decided to conjure up a pig. He hadn\u2019t eaten pork for a long time. Unfortunately, nothing had changed in this space this time.Han Fei tried many times. It turned out that he could only change the terrain of the space, but not any flower, tree, bird, or beast inside or outside the space. But this made sense. If he could conjure living beings, wouldn\u2019t he be the creator?In the end, the area of Forge the Universe stopped at about 60 square metres and Han Fei no longer felt massive spiritual energy pounding his body.Han Fei opened his eyes, only to find that his body was covered with filth. He had no time to clean himself up but he looked at his data.: Han Fei13 (Junior Fishing Master)156,666 points (559)Level-Three, Mid-Quality (Upgradable)Twin Yin-Yang Spirit Swallowing Fish: Purple Bamboo Rod: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)\u2026Huh?\u2026 I didn\u2019t upgrade my spiritual heritage! Why was it upgraded? And why is the \u201cUpgradable\u201d part behind it grayed out?Han Fei was a bit panicked.\u00a0Is it because my spiritual heritage was upgraded too quickly? Or are there conditions that have not been met, so I can\u2019t upgrade it?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Fei repeatedly pondered over the information revealed by this string of data.First of all, his spiritual heritage might not be able to be upgraded for the time being. It seemed to be limited by some unknown power. He tried upgrading it with spiritual energy, but nothing happened.Then he noticed the change in his level. It must have taken him a lot of spiritual energy to upgrade to a fishing master and improve his strength to be at the peak of a junior fishing master. It was precisely this number that reminded him of something\u2026In everyone\u2019s eyes, fishing masters had no difference in level only in quality, but the data only showed that he was level 13; it didn\u2019t show his specific quality. This was very important, which meant that there might be a big gap between junior fishing masters. Although the upper limit of his spiritual energy had been increased to 559 points, he felt that he still had a lot of room for improvement. After all, he hadn\u2019t finished practicing the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing and his physique hadn\u2019t reached its peak yet.Thinking of this, Han Fei felt that it was necessary for him to solidify his foundation now. More haste, less speed. Although it was good to become stronger, if his strength was increased too fast, there would definitely be problems. This was common sense.Of course, Han Fei didn\u2019t plan to practice the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing here because he hadn\u2019t finished exploring the cave yet.Han Fei looked down only to see that Little Black and Little White were shining with spiritual energy. The two little guys upgraded fast indeed! Even their bellies bulged.Of course, what surprised Han Fei most was the white liquid in this pool. Now, it was completely gone. It must have been used up when he was expanding Forge the Universe. Otherwise, the spiritual energy contained in the white liquid would be enough to burst his body dozens of times.Han Fei summoned back Little Black and Little White and they began to explore this space.In addition to beds, tables, and stools, there was also a place for cultivation. Seeing it, Han Fei knew that he used the wrong cultivation method just now. Even the owner didn\u2019t sit in the pool to cultivate. He was stupid to do that, but he was mainly affected by the footprints of the Mantis Shrimp King.Walking through the place where the owner of the cave cultivated, Han Fei found several pockets on the rock wall, and when he walked past, he found two books.Han Fei picked up a book without a name and looked at it. It was the owner\u2019s self-record of his cultivation.The record dated back to when this person discovered the underwater cave. The first page stated:\u201cI was defeated and fell to this place. I thought that I would die here. However, I found a spiritual spring in this ordinary fishery. Unfortunately, my injuries are too serious and the spiritual spring is too little to make up for my losses. I know that I don\u2019t have much time left, but I can do nothing about it.\u201dPage two:\u201cMy cultivation foundation has been damaged and I can no longer cultivate. Fine, let this cave be my tomb!\u201dPage three:\u201cOn the seventh day I\u2019m lying here and waiting for death, the spiritual energy in my body has been exhausted and I can\u2019t absorb any spiritual energy from the spiritual spring. I know, I am doomed.\u201dPage four:\u201cThis sea area is abundant with Mantis Shrimp. They taste good. I am accompanied by Mantis Shrimp every day.\u201dPage five:\u201cWhy am I still alive? I\u2019ve been waiting for death here for a month. Why am I still alive?\u201dPage six:\u201cI have had an amazing discovery. Do cultivators only need spiritual energy? Wrong, completely wrong\u2026 After consuming Mantis Shrimps for a long time, I found myself full of energy. My mental power and energy are intertwined. Without spiritual energy, I\u2019m even capable of telekinesis\u2026 God of the Sea! I found a great secret. Does cultivation only need spiritual energy? No, using spiritual energy is only one of the ways to cultivate. There is still another way.\u201dWhen Han Fei read this, his heart was pounding hard.\u00a0What does the cave owner mean? He no longer had any spiritual energy but he could still cultivate? What does this mean?Han Fei continued to read eagerly.Page seven:\u201cIt took me a year to create the physical training method. Now I\u2019m confident that even a Hidden Fisher won\u2019t be able to beat me after I\u2019ve tempered my body with this method. But this art still has a weakness. I know, my mental power is seriously damaged\u2026 Haha, wait, wait for me to find a way to restore my mental strength. When I return, I will wipe out the entire Thousand Star City\u2026\u201dHan Fei hurriedly turned the page, only to find that there was no more. Did this mean that the owner had left to find a way to restore his mental strength?F*ck! It feels like I missed 100 million yuan.Han Fei continued to read the other book. Turning the first page, he saw two large words: \u201cIndestructible Body.\u201dHan Fei was shocked. He just felt that he had missed 100 million yuan and then he found that this guy had left him the physical training method?Han Fei excitedly turned another page, but this page was not about the training method. Han Fei\u2019s eyelids twitched when he read its contents:\u201cI don\u2019t know who will inherit my \u201cIndestructible Body,\u201d but you can enter here when you\u2019re still a fisher, which shows that you\u2019re quite talented. You have two choices. The first is to give up and leave the \u201cIndestructible Body\u201d art here. The second one is to practice it. Then even if you are a waste, you can be a god as long as you are willing to work hard. However, if you choose to practice the Indestructible Body, you are my disciple. Remember not to tell anyone you\u2019re Ren Tianfei\u2019s disciple when you go to the Thousand Star City. Otherwise, you\u2019ll probably be killed by my enemies. Of course, it\u2019s also possible that you are such a waste that you\u2019ll still die early even if you\u2019ve practiced Indestructible Body. But it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve left a map for you. If you can set foot in a level-three fishery, you can use the map\u2026 If you can\u2019t even go to a level-three fishery or find my treasure trove, then you are basically a waste and don\u2019t deserve to be my disciple\u2026\u201dSure enough, Han Fei did find a fish-skin map at the end of the book. It was a map of a sea area that he had never seen before. The topography was very complicated, and a red dot was circled.Han Fei found this guy both funny and annoying. He was so arrogant that he wanted to wipe out a city and even become a god. But Han Fei liked that!Han Fei hummed while flipping through the book.\u00a0I\u2019m not going to be your disciple. You have so many enemies. I don\u2019t want to get into trouble! But I owe you one.He opened the page and it read, \u201cThe mysterious human body can be basically divided into five levels: skin, flesh, internal organs, bones, and marrow. If you finish tempering your skin, no weapon can penetrate your skin. If you finish tempering your flesh, your body will become extremely flexible. If you finish tempering your internal organs, any wound you have can heal by itself. If you finish tempering your bones, your fist will be even harder than the best weapon. If you finish tempering your marrow, your body will be indestructible and you\u2019ll be a god\u2026\u201dHan Fei\u2019s mouth was almost watering.\u00a0That\u2019s the most valuable treasure I\u2019ve ever seen! It\u2019s completely different from those garbage books in the library of the Heavenly Water Village. This is a genuinely magical art! And its author is a real genius!Han Fei habitually looked at the data of the Indestructible Body.\u201cIndestructible Body\u201d (Venerable Level, Peerless Quality): The peerless genius of the Thousand Star City created this physical training method \u201cIndestructible Body\u201d at the lowest point of his life, which is only one step away from a divine-quality art.: \u201cIndestructible Overlord Body\u201d: 100 million points.Han Fei was dumbfounded and dazzled as he rubbed his eyes.Damn, that\u2019s ridiculous! Are you serious?! 100 million points! You might as well kill me!Han Fei didn\u2019t know what to say.\u00a0100 million points! Isn\u2019t the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing also of venerable level? Why is this one so special? 100 million points required to deduce it?But Han Fei was still very happy to get this Art. After all, a wonderful combat skill like Shadow-less Hand was only of Mortal Level, Divine Quality, whereas this Indestructible Body reached the Venerable Level, which must be a very advanced combat skill.Although he was still unclear about the hierarchy of different arts, he had a rough idea of how advanced this art was from the spiritual energy required to deduce it.\u00a0If this weren\u2019t a great art, would it require so many spiritual energy points to deduce it?Han Fei immediately threw the book into Forge the Universe. He would never leave it to others now that he had got it. If it was taken by someone else, he would cry himself to death!Han Fei explored around the rest of the cave and found nothing else. Then he walked out without hesitation.When he left, he said to the air, \u201cI\u2019m taking away this treasure but I won\u2019t stop to find the next treasure. The next treasure, wait for me. It won\u2019t take me long!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Jue got the news early in the morning that Han Fei stole his own fishing boat and went out to sea. For this reason, the village leader said that when Han Fei came back, he would lock his fishing boat in his house and make him stay put on the floating island.The news couldn\u2019t be concealed. Li Jue had been waiting for this moment a long time. A few days ago, Han Fei killed a fishing master of the Tigers, although he was still a fisher. If Han Fei was given more time, he might really end up as his whetstone and never be able to avenge his son.Li Jue went out to sea too. Instead of leaving from the main port, he left secretly.Although Li Jue left secretly, his action did not escape the eyes of some people.At this moment, the plantation.The village leader was angry. \u201cOld Jiang, why did you let that kid go to sea? If he dies at sea, how would I explain it to Tang Ge when he returns?\u201dOld Jiang lay on his chair and said slowly, \u201cYou know nothing! Tang Ge kept Li Jue as a whetstone for that kid! If he doesn\u2019t go through hardships, why does he need a whetstone? If he dies, then he can only blame himself for his incompetence. Who else can he blame?\u201dThe village leader shouted, \u201cEasier said than done! You are not the village leader. Of course, you are not under pressure. Also, Li Jue has already gone to sea. Although I have asked Wang Jie to look for Han Fei, I\u2019m not sure if he can find him since the fishery is so big. If\u2026\u201dJiang Qin appeared at the moment. \u201cHan Fei is not as weak as you think. Although he is unable to beat Li Jue, he won\u2019t have any problem escaping.\u201dThe village leader:\u201d???\u201dThe village leader was stunned. What did she mean? Did she mean that a fisher wouldn\u2019t have any problem surviving the hunt of a fishing master who already reached a peak level?\u2026Outside the cave, Han Fei cheerfully picked out the Mantis Shrimp Beads from the heads of the Mantis Shrimp, and at the same time, stuffed the body of the Mantis Shrimp King into Forge the Universe. His shell was tough indeed. He could make some knives from it.Only 168 Mantis Shrimp Beads?Han Fei looked at the bodies scattered all over the place and was shocked. The combat power of Mantis Shrimp was really strong! Only a hundred Mantis Shrimp had killed thousands of fish and crabs, half of which were killed by the Mantis Shrimp King. If he weren\u2019t bitten to death by Little Black, he would have been able to kill even more fishes and crabs.After swimming out of the trench, Han Fei glanced at the shipwrecks and went straight to the sea surface.On the way, a Snakebelt wanted to come over to bite Han Fei, but the current Little Black was not the fish he was yesterday. He had grown ten centimetres longer and no longer looked like a baby fish. The Snakebelt was instantly bitten in two by Little Black, completely unable to fight back.Han Fei stuck his head out of the sea, and his first reaction was that it seemed to have just dawned. Han Fei let out a breath.\u00a0That\u2019s great. Although the Boat Burying Pit was not very remote, it was nearly 500 miles away from the Heavenly Water Village. There won\u2019t be many people coming here to fish.\u201cLittle Black, Little White, go find my ship.\u201dHan Fei didn\u2019t see his boat. No one knew where it had drifted after the whole night had passed, but it should be within 50 miles.So Han Fei practiced Wind Footwork while searching around.If someone was nearby at the time, their jaw would drop. A guy was walking on the sea like flying. Although he could only fly dozens of metres at a time before falling into the sea, he was still flying.By the time Han Fei found the white fishing boat, it was already thirty miles away. Before finding it, he ran in the wrong direction, so he came to the original spot again. During this time, he saw two fishing boats and some people fishing. Han Fei certainly couldn\u2019t let them see him, so he swam underwater like a big humanoid fish.\u201cPu\u2026\u201dWhen he got on the boat, Han Fei wasn\u2019t in a hurry to go back. After all, he stole the fishing boat and snuck out to sea. He was afraid that he wouldn\u2019t be able to get out again after going back, and he would probably be made to till the land in the plantation. But Han Fei didn\u2019t want to do that now. He had learned Spirits Concentration Art. Unless the old man was willing to teach him something new, he didn\u2019t want to till the land now.Perhaps Jiang Qin could teach him some new combat skills, but after thinking about it, he thought that the 5 combat skills he had just practiced were enough for now. And what good stuff could be found in the Heavenly Water Village? He might as well stay at sea to study the Indestructible Body. This Art was really cool.Of course, Han Fei was not in a hurry to study that art now. He began to practice the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing. He had just become a fishing master and needed to harden his body.When Han Fei practiced the 108 stances again, he felt that they were easier to practice. Maybe it was because his strength had been improved. It would normally take him nearly 6 hours to practice all the 108 stances before, but now he only needed 4 hours.Just when Han Fei was practicing the eighth posture, with a swish, something came out of the air.\u201cHuh?\u201dHan Fei immediately stopped practicing and ducked aside, only to see a fish hook shining with spiritual energy appear in front of him.A fishing boat appeared out of nowhere dozens of metres away.When Li Jue found out that his map had been stolen and that Han Fei stole the ship and slipped away, he knew that Han Fei must have read his map. He thought that Han Fei would go to the Undersea Cave first, but he didn\u2019t find Han Fei there, so he went to the Spirit Absorbing Jellyfish Settlement. After all, he had gotten his Tiger-Head Fish from there.However, Li Jue was surprised to find that he wasn\u2019t there either, so he guessed that this damned guy must have gone to the Boat Burying Pit. Li Jue hoped that Han Fei wouldn\u2019t go there because if he did, he would be torn to pieces, but Li Jue wanted revenge with his own hands. After all, the Mantis Shrimp king was too terrifying. He felt lucky that he was able to survive him last time.\u201cHan Fei, you b*stard, I\u2019ve got you! You won\u2019t be able to escape today!\u201dLooking at Li Jue who came leaping forward, Han Fei grabbed in the air and with a flash, the Purple Bamboo Rod appeared in his hand.BAM!Han Fei stepped back seven or eight steps feeling his arms slightly numb. He squinted. Li Jue was really a worthy peak-leveled fishing master. His strength was shocking.But he didn\u2019t know that Li Jue was also shocked. How can Han Fei be safe and sound after being hit by me?\u201cYou\u2019re already a fishing master?\u201dHan Fei twisted his neck. \u201cI\u2019ve just become a fishing master and you just happen to come around.\u201dLi Jue was shocked. This bastard was so talented? He used to suspect that it was because of Tang Ge\u2019s help that Han Fei had been upgrading so quickly and smoothly. But now Tang Ge had left. Which level was Han Fei at when Tang Ge left? But now Han Fei was already a fishing master?Li Jue\u2019s face changed slightly. \u201cEven if you\u2019re a fishing master, so what? I must kill you today!\u201d\u201cHow do you know that I\u2019m not purposely waiting for you here? Your movement is restricted in the floating Island, so is mine. Since you\u2019ve come here, just stay here forever.\u201d\u201cArrogant bastard! Go to hell\u2026\u201dAfter Li Jue launched a wild spiritual energy explosion attack, Han Fei, who also exerted a spiritual energy explosion attack, was shaken more than 20 metres away. Han Fei\u2019s arms were numb and his internal organs were tumbling. He felt very uncomfortable.However, just when Li Jue thought that Han Fei was about to fall into the water, Han Fei walked back on the air as if a gust of wind had sent him back. His face turned ferocious and he let out a strange laugh, which was a bit creepy.\u201cHow is this possible?\u201dLi Jue was really shocked. He used eighty percent of his force on the last hit, but Han Fei remained intact and could even fight back?Clang! Clang! Clang!Han Fei moved extremely fast. The Purple Bamboo Rod danced in his hand like a dagger and stabbed at Li Jue\u2019s eyes, throat, private parts, armpits, and other vital parts of his body.\u201cThat\u2019s strange. What secret technique are you using?\u201dLi Jue\u2019s face changed. Han Fei was stronger than just now, which he could obviously feel.Han Fei was a little crazy and his attacks were getting fiercer and fiercer. The power of each blow was overwhelming, and he thought to himself,\u00a0Since the creator of the Crazy Devil\u2019s Rod killed two fishing masters with the strength of a fisher, why can\u2019t I?However, after ten minutes or so, Han Fei found that Li Jue remained silent but didn\u2019t retreat in the slightest. They seemed to be equal.Huh?\u00a0Does this old fox want to exhaust my spiritual energy?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you kidding me?\u201cExplode!\u201dLi Jue\u2019s eyes were cold and when Han Fei launched a spiritual energy explosion attack, he did the same at the same time.Han Fei was sent flying through the air again, but once again, he flew back and fought Li Jue.In just a few minutes, Han Fei was sent flying seven or eight times, but he was still shouting.\u201cLi Jue, the leader of the Tigers, is this all you can do? Aren\u2019t you a peak-leveled fishing master? Aren\u2019t you going to be a Great Fishing Master? Come on! Hit me! Kill me!\u201dLi Jue almost vomited blood in anger.\u00a0What kind of chance did Han Fei get? How did he suddenly become so strong? Was his spiritual energy really endless? If he didn\u2019t kill him today, how could he beat him in the future?\u201cDie!\u201dSuddenly, Li Jue punched Han Fei away and took the chance to put some Spirit Refilling Pills into his own mouth. When Han Fei pounced at him again, he frowned.\u00a0There must be something wrong!In an instant, Han Fei\u2019s toe-tips touched the ground and he flew back. At the same time, Li Jue split his rod into two pieces, exposing two thin knives, and he thrust them at Han Fei.Han Fei hurriedly changed his posture and narrowly ducked the two knives.Han Fei\u2019s face changed slightly.\u00a0What a tricky angle! Did he learn it from me? But that\u2019s a knife, not a rod. No matter how sturdy my body is, you can\u2019t stab it with a knife!\u201cHo! Li Jue, you really let me down! Is that all you\u2019ve got?\u201dLi Jue stood still and coldly stared at Han Fei. \u201cI have to say, you may be the most talented person in the Heavenly Water Village in this past century except Tang Ge, but so what? I slaughtered my way through and got where I\u2019m today from being a nobody! You\u2019re no match for me! Since you want to die, let me help you.\u201d\u201cTiger-Head, fuse with me!\u201dHan Fei\u2019s eyes narrowed. He had been waiting for this moment. Although they seemed to tie, Li Jue did not exert his full strength. Even if he used the Crazy Devil\u2019s Rod, he still couldn\u2019t beat him. It could be seen that although the Crazy Devil\u2019s Rod was powerful, it couldn\u2019t help him win. Its creator must have only killed two junior fishing masters.\u201cLittle Black, bite him.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dLi Jue glanced around but found nothing at all, but at the next moment, there was a pain in his thigh. When he looked down, a piece of flesh had been bitten off.Li Jue\u2019s look changed greatly.\u00a0What is it?Before Li Jue had the time to react, the same place on his thigh was bitten again.\u201cOuch\u2026\u201dLi Jue immediately filled his body with spiritual energy.\u201cWhat is this? What hex do you use?\u201dHan Fei chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when you die.\u201dHan Fei also filled his body with spiritual energy and attacked him again. This time, he felt completely different. Li Jue\u2019s attacks were so swift and fierce that he even defused his spiritual energy explosion with his knives. When Han Fei didn\u2019t pay attention, he was cut in the chest. Although he wasn\u2019t seriously wounded, he had to fill his body with spiritual energy again.\u201cInteresting. Your strength was improved by a level after fusing with your Tiger-Head Fish, but so what? You\u2019re still a peak-leveled fishing master. You\u2019re still not my match!\u201dHan Fei evaded Li Jue\u2019s double knives and jumped in the air, shouting, \u201cFuse!\u201dThe next moment, a yin-yang pattern instantly covered up his body, and one of Han Fei\u2019s eyes became black and one white while his momentum soared.Li Jue was shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible! How can a Spirit Swallowing Fish bring such a strong fusion effect?\u201d\u201cHoho\u2026\u201dIn Han Fei\u2019s eyes, blood was circulating in Li Jue\u2019s body and spiritual energy was rolling in his meridian, which was as plain as daylight to him.Clang\u2026When their fists collided, the corner of Li Jue\u2019s mouth twitched. Just a moment ago, he saw a cold flash, and then his spiritual energy explosion attack was defused!He turned around, only to see that two knives appeared in Han Fei\u2019s hand and his Purple Bamboo Rod was gone.\u201cDo you use knives too?\u201d\u201cHoho\u2026\u201dA sudden thirst for blood seized Han Fei. Having this feeling once again, he was still terrified, and at the moment of fusion, he felt that his strength should surpass that of a junior fishing master. Li Jue \u2018s movements were not as fast or powerful as before.\u201cDie!\u201dThey were both using double knives and fighting fiercely. Only in ten minutes, Li Jue had more than a dozen wounds on his body, and his spiritual energy explosion attacks had been defused three times.Li Jue was confused. \u201cHow is it possible?! How can you be so strong? Your spiritual beast can\u2019t be a Spirit Swallowing Fish!\u201dHan Fei\u2019s face was grim and his voice was hoarse, \u201cMy\u2026 spiritual beast is\u2026 Twin\u2026 Yin-Yang\u2026 Spirit Swallowing Fish\u201d.Li Jue was astounded. It turned out that his spiritual beast was not an ordinary Spirit Swallowing Fish but a very powerful exotic fish. No wonder his strength became so terrifying after the fusion. Every time he almost cut him, he would narrowly dodge it. Although he came this close to killing him, he failed in the end.Li Jue would not give up. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t lose! Blade Fish, fuse with me.\u201dThe next moment, a Blade Fish rushed into Li Jue\u2019s body from the void.Few people knew that Li Jue used knives, and even fewer people knew that Li Jue had a spiritual beast. Everyone knew that Li Jue had a Tiger-Head Fish as his contractual spiritual fish and thought that he had no spiritual beast or his spiritual beast had already died, but who knew that Li Jue\u2019s spiritual beast was the most common, a Blade Fish!Obviously, Blade Fish were too common and could be seen everywhere in the Heavenly Water Village, but with such a spiritual beast Li Jue still became the leader of the Tigers, which demonstrated his ability.With one eye black and one white eye, Han Fei looked very calm. No one knew what he was thinking.In fact, Han Fei was thinking about how to kill Li Jue at this moment. Once again, he dashed at Li Jue again carrying the knives. The double knives in his hand danced like flying butterflies and looked gorgeous. But this time, he failed to defuse Li Jue\u2019s spiritual energy explosion attack. From time to time, Han Fei saw a transparent knife shoot from Li Jue\u2019s body. Although it was almost invisible, it could not escape his eyes.\u201cPu\u2026\u201dHan Fei looked down at the wound on his right shoulder that was left by the knife. He had seen the knife coming just now but couldn\u2019t dodge it.Li Jue sneered, \u201cYou have many means, but so what? Your real strength just equals to that of a junior fishing master. How long can you keep this special fighting state?\u201dHan Fei clenched his knives and said lightly, \u201cFury.\u201dIn an instant, Han Fei got close to him. He waved the knives so fast that only shadows could be seen. Li Jue had just barely blocked the first ten attacks but failed to block his attack again. In a blink of an eye, a dozen wounds appeared on his body and he was drenched with blood. This brutal battle continued.\u201cImpossible.\u201dLi Jue let out a desperate roar. Why did this guy suddenly become even stronger? He shot seven or eight knives simultaneously, but Han Fei twisted his body in strange postures and dodged them all. No ordinary people could twist their bodies like that!Swish\u2026 Swish\u2026After only several minutes, Li Jue was covered with blood and his hands had turned to bones!Li Jue looked incredulously at his hands that had become bones and then at the two knives respectively in his left and right chest.Han Fei looked calm and the gleam in his black and white eyes seemed about to go out, but in the end, they didn\u2019t.Han Fei grinned eerily and his twisted face was all bloody. He pulled Li Jue over, opened his mouth, and bit his neck.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dAfter dozens of minutes, Han Fei terminated the fusion with difficulty. At the moment he terminated the fusion, he threw up.\u201cShit! I bit a human again! I don\u2019t want to do it! Little Black, why didn\u2019t you tell me that human flesh is so gross?!\u201d\u201cEw\u2026\u201dOf course, Han Fei hadn\u2019t really eaten any human flesh: he just killed Li Jue by biting off all the flesh of his neck. Perhaps he subconsciously resisted eating human flesh, so he spat the flesh out. But even so, the strong bloody smell almost made him faint.\u201cOh!\u201dHan Fei ate a Spirit Refilling Pill and lay on the fishing boat, exhausted.Little White swam over and kissed Han Fei\u2019s cheek, and then swam to Han Fei\u2019s mouth, giving Han Fei a mouthful of pure spiritual energy.\u201cEw\u2026\u201dHan Fei wanted to faint again.\u00a0I not only ate human flesh, but also ate spiritual energy spat out by a fish. Although this spiritual energy is very pure, it is still from a fish\u2019s mouth!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was blood all over the deck, as well as some suspicious pieces of flesh, and Li Jue\u2019s rod was left on the deck.\u201cHan Fei, Han Fei\u2026\u201dHan Fei knew it was Wang Jie, but he didn\u2019t open his eyes. He was too tired. Although he had just restored some strength, he still didn\u2019t want to move.\u201cMr. Wang, I\u2019m fine.\u201dWang Jie let out a sigh of relief and immediately asked, \u201cWhere is Li Jue\u2026?\u201dHan Fei pointed to the deck and said, \u201cI threw him to the sea to feed the fish.\u201dWang Jie: \u201c\u2026\u201dWang Jie was stunned.\u00a0Is Li Jue dead? Li Jue, who had been such a bully for years, is dead? How did Han Fei manage to kill him?\u201cHow did you kill him?\u201dHan Fei stretched out and sat up. \u201cI used the secret weapon Tang Ge gave me.\u201dWang Jie rolled his eyes.\u00a0Do you think I\u2019m a fool? If you did have a secret weapon, why is blood all over on the deck? And why do you look so tired?However, Wang Jie was still deeply shocked. No matter how Han Fei made it, he made it, which showed that Han Fei had the strength to kill a peak-leveled fishing master. Everyone knew that Li Jue was only one step from becoming a Great Fishing Master!\u201cHave you made a breakthrough?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWang Jie didn\u2019t know what to say.\u00a0How old is he? A 12-year-old kid who had just gone through the Fishing Trial was already a fishing master?! A few months ago, he was still a level-two fisher, a weakling that even he could pinch to death.Wang Jie asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan next?\u201dHan Fei only muttered, \u201cHoho\u2026\u201d\u2026Han Fei returned to the village with Wang Jie and the fishing boat was taken away by the village leader as soon as they hit the port.But when the village leader saw Han Fei, he exclaimed, \u201cAre you already a fishing master?\u201d1 As the village leader exclaimed, many people looked at Han Fei. What? This kid is already a fishing master?Someone said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this boy Han Fei who was the first place in the Fishing Trial? It\u2019s only been a few days and he\u2019s already a fishing master?\u201dSome people shouted, \u201cI have lived in vain for half my life! I have not yet become a level-seven fisher and he, a kid, is already a fishing master! I am really\u2026\u201dSomeone patted him on the shoulder. \u201cForget it, buddy. People are different. What kind of spiritual heritage do you have? A level-one, low-quality one, right? So what else do you expect? You should be glad that you\u2019re still alive.\u201dSomeone sighed. \u201cMy son has a level-one, high-quality spiritual heritage, but now he is only a level-six fisher. What a shame!\u201d\u201cShit! Your son is already a level-6 fisher? My son has a level-two, low-quality spiritual heritage and is also a level-six fisher.\u201d\u201cWhat?! Your son has already reached level 6? Why is my son only level 5?\u201dFor a moment, they strayed off-topic. Everyone was in awe of this genius, so no one mentioned how useless Han Fei used to be again.Zhang Han was standing stunned among the crowd and all the sea melon seeds in his hands were spilled on the ground.He had once blackmailed Han Fei and went to his barbecue stall to make trouble for him. Most importantly, this morning he heard that the leader of the Tigers, Li Jue went after him. Now Han Fei was back. What about Li Ju?A terrible thought suddenly occurred to Zhang Han.\u00a0Is Li Jue already dead?On the port, Li Gang and Li Qing quickly greeted them.Li Gang greeted him first. \u201cYoung Master, welcome back. I was so worried about you. How could you secretly go to sea? Has Li Jue found you? Forget it, he certainly didn\u2019t find you. Young Master, don\u2019t be so capricious next time!\u201dLi Qing\u2019s lips moved but he didn\u2019t speak.\u00a0Boss is really lucky to come back alive!Han Fei smiled and patted Li Gang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cA-Gang, I have something to tell you.\u201dLi Gang hurriedly put his ears close to him. Although he didn\u2019t know what happened, he believed Han Fei unconditionally.\u201cWhat?!\u201dLi Gang looked at Han Fei in shock. He almost peed in panic.Han Fei assured him, \u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic. Just do it.\u201dLi Gang\u2019s face suddenly beamed with a smile. \u201cYes, Young Master.\u201dWatching Li Gang stride away triumphantly, Han Fei said to Li Qing, \u201cUncle Qing, let\u2019s go to the barbecue stall. We will open the stall today, free of charge.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dBefore hearing Li Qing\u2019s response, Han Fei shouted out loud to the sky, \u201cEveryone, listen to me, the leader of the Tigers, Li Jue, is dead. The Most Delicious Barbecue Stall in the World reopens today and all food is free of charge\u2026\u201dThen he walked away, leaving the crowd stunned and at a loss.Someone scratched their head in wonder. \u201cWhat did he just say?\u201d\u201cHe seemed to say that Li Jue is dead\u2026\u201d\u201cReally?!\u201d\u201cLi Jue is a peak-leveled fishing master. How could he have died so easily?\u201d\u201cI heard that Li Jue went after Han Fei this morning and vowed to kill him. Could Han Fei have beat Li Jue?\u201d\u201cYes, I heard it too! Let\u2019s go to the barbecue stall and check it out. What if it is true?\u201dSomeone sneered, \u201cIf it is true, I\u2019ll thank God. Li Jue is such a bully. I\u2019m glad to see him die.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go together.\u201d\u201cWait for me. I\u2019m coming too\u2026\u201dWang Jie looked at the receding figure of Han Fei and wondered whether what Han Fei said was real. He didn\u2019t find that Han Fei had such a side before, but what was this kid going to do?\u00a0Whatever, I\u2019m going to the barbecue stall anyway. It\u2019s great to have a free barbecue!\u2026Half an hour later.The Most Delicious Barbecue Stall in the World.Li Gang, Little Red, and Li Qing were busy making barbecue. Since Li Qing joined them, the area of the barbecue stall had expanded a bit and a shed was placed above the barbecue stall.Han Fei was standing on the shed at the moment. The street in front of him was packed with people who were all attracted by the news Han Fei had just released. From every corner of the village, people came out and gathered to check out whether the news was real or not.Just now, Li Gang went to tell the members of the Tigers the news of Li Jue\u2019s death, but they didn\u2019t believe it. Now they were also at the stall, staring warily at Han Fei standing on the roof.\u201cEveryone, be quiet\u2026\u201dHan Fei took a breath and said, \u201cEveryone, the floating island is our home, but Li Jue and Li Hu threw their weight over everyone. They cheated, bullied, and killed. Everyone hated them! I, Han Fei, have killed Li Jue\u2019s son, Li Hu, on the sea a few months ago. And now, I\u2019ve also killed Li Jue and sent them to reunite under the ground\u2026\u201d\u201cNonsense! Our leader is a peak-leveled fishing master! How could he be killed by you?\u201dHan Fei coldly stared at this man. The latter was scared by his eyes and immediately shut up.Han Fei snorted and took out Li Jue\u2019s rod, saying, \u201cThis is Li Jue\u2019s rod that can turn into two knives after being split in the middle. It\u2019s quite unique\u2026 But no matter how unique it is, it can\u2019t stop me from killing that bully. What I said is true. If you don\u2019t believe it, you can ask Master Wang Jie, an inspector of ordinary fisheries.\u201dWang Jie was also in the crowd. Seeing many people looking at him, he complained in his heart that he was just there to get free barbecue.\u00a0Why do you suddenly draw everyone\u2019s attention to me? What are you going to do?But for the sake that Han Fei was his student, Wang Jie said in a deep voice, \u201cWhen I arrived, Li Jue was already dead.\u201d\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cReally?\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha, great! Li Jue, that bastard, finally died.\u201d\u201cGod of Sea, Li Jue is dead, what great news!\u201dThe crowd was in an uproar. Obviously, everyone was excited at Li Jue\u2019s death, especially those who were oppressed by the Tigers. They almost jumped for joy.And the members of the Tigers were all stunned. Leader is dead? Damn! Then what should they do next?\u201cBe quiet!\u201dWhen the crowd calmed down, Han Fei said, \u201cAs you can see, the Tigers commit all sorts of crimes! Now that Li Jue has died, the Tigers shall no longer exist. Now, I, Han Fei, have an important matter to announce.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dSome people asked curiously.The smile on Han Fei\u2019s face disappeared and he said seriously, \u201cOur village needs a peaceful environment. The Tigers collected protection fees, killed innocent people, and seized their goods. But I, Han Fei, intend to establish a brand-new gang, a gang that can protect the villagers and improve the quality of our life\u2026 I, Han Fei, am going to found The Fish Dragons. From now on, no one can bully others in our village. Now, The Fish Dragons officially recruits its members. Only level-8 fishers or above can be admitted. Is anyone willing to join?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A 12-year-old kid wanted to found a gang?Among the crowd, Wang Jie was stupefied and felt as if there were ten thousand Iron-Headed Fish fighting in his heart.\u00a0Did I hear him wrong? Han Fei wants to found a gang? Seriously?Zhang Han was also dumbfounded.\u00a0Are you kidding me, Han Fei? Do you have any idea how old you are?Even Li Gang and Li Qing were stunned.\u00a0Is Young Master alright? Is he crazy? They lowered their head and avoided people\u2019s gaze. We\u2019d better just focus on making barbecue.Han Fei glanced around and got no response from the crowd, so he said, \u201cEveryone, The Fish Dragons have just been established. We\u2019ll only recruit 200 members for now. And, from today on, The Fish Dragons will take over all of the Tigers\u2019 properties. Even Li Jue was killed by me. I\u2019d like to see if anyone dares to reject me.\u201dWith that, Han Fei snorted and the members of the Tigers all trembled in fright. Their leader was dead and now they were like lambs to the slaughter!However, someone in the crowd still shouted angrily, \u201cHow can you just take over our property like this? That\u2019s illegal!\u201dHan Fei said casually, \u201cI remember when the Tigers and the Wang Family competed for territory, you guys committed many crimes, didn\u2019t you?\u201dWith that, Han Fei pointed to the man who spoke. \u201cI announce that any former members of the Tigers who didn\u2019t commit any crimes and are at least a level-8 fisher can join the Fish Dragons, and all other members will be expelled\u2026 Including the one who spoke just now.\u201dAmong the crowd, someone suddenly shouted, \u201cI want in. I didn\u2019t kill or bully anyone. I joined the Tigers just to live a good life.\u201dSome people immediately chose to join and many more were moved by Han Fei\u2019s words because the condition Han Fei offered was too tempting to them. The Tigers had so many properties. If the bad guys were expelled, they would be able to have a finger in the pie. Then they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about their well-being anymore.\u201cI\u2019m in. I\u2019m just an off-staff member of the Tigers, but I\u2019m already a level-8 fisher.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in too\u2026\u201d\u201cMe too\u2026\u201dA member of the Tigers angrily rebuked them, \u201cYou traitors, do you think you will be better off if Han Fei becomes your leader?\u201dSome people retorted, \u201cWhat do you mean by traitors? Li Jue is such a badass. If I were strong enough, I would have killed him earlier!\u201dThe Tigers instantly split into two factions, which Han Fei was glad to see.Han Fei said, \u201cAll those who are willing to join The Fish Dragons go register with Li Qing\u2026 Li Qing, choose the eligible people in strict accordance with my standards and take down their information. Don\u2019t miss anyone, understood?\u201dLi Qing moved his lips and in the end, he simply said, \u201cYes, Young Master.\u201dAt this moment, only some former members of the Tigers joined the Fish Dragons, so Han Fei continued, \u201cEveryone, please listen to me. I promise I\u2019ll lead the Fish Dragons to prosperity, to the pinnacle of life. Look at the Most Delicious Barbecue Stall in the World! With this little stall, I make a fortune! And now, I\u2019ve decided to open a large hot pot restaurant respectively in the four fairs of the Heavenly Water Village. On the day they open, all the food will be sold at half price\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is a hot pot restaurant?\u201dNo one knew and everyone was curious.\u201cHot pot is an unparalleled delicacy. It is just as delicious as barbecue, or even better. We\u2019ll offer you a 50 percent discount when the restaurants open. The managers of these restaurants will be chosen from the members of the Fish Dragons. You can also apply for jobs in these restaurants\u2026 My fellow villagers, please think it over. Opportunity seldom knocks twice\u2026 You have already wasted the first half of your life. Why not give it a try to change the second half?\u201dPresent were all fishermen who only knew fishing. How could they resist Han Fei\u2019s temptation? The hot pot was even more delicious and profitable than barbecue. Of course, they wanted to earn easy money! Who wanted to risk his own life and go fishing in the sea every day?The crowd was instantly in an uproar.\u201cI want in. Leader, I am a level-nine fisher. Look how strong I am.\u201d\u201cGo away. Leader, count me in. I am hard-working and kind-hearted.\u201d\u201cGet out of the way. Me, me, Leader, don\u2019t forget me. I am quite talented at cooking.\u201dHan Fei waved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t rush, don\u2019t rush. If you want to join, sign up with Li Qing. Also, this is only the first time we are recruiting members. Our members must have a good moral quality. As our business expands, we\u2019ll need more members. Anyone who is willing to join us will be given a chance.\u201d\u201cUncle Qing, I, I want to sign up.\u201d\u201cBrother Qing, we knew each other long ago. Sign me up!\u201d\u201cMaster Qing\u2026\u201dIt was completely out of control. The crowd didn\u2019t even have time to take the free barbecue as they swarmed around Li Qing, congesting the street. Even the nearby hawkers stopped doing business and came to sign up. Could their business be as profitable as the barbecue stall? If they could join the hot pot restaurants, they would be able to make a fortune!Li Gang and Little Red were stupefied.\u00a0Young Master, you\u2019re our hero! You\u2019re our god!Wang Jie finally pushed his way through the crowd to Li Gang and patted him on the shoulder. \u201cPack a portion of barbecue for me please.\u201dStill sitting on the shed, Han Fei looked at Wang Jie and said, \u201cMr. Wang, do you want to join us? You can be our elder and I can pay you 10 mid-quality pearls a month\u2026Wang Jie rejected, \u201cHoho, I am too busy.\u201d\u2026The village leader was not surprised when he heard the news, although Han Fei was a little bit beyond his expectations. Not bad, this kid!Although he was the leader of the Heavenly Water Village, he couldn\u2019t take care of everything in the village. Although the Tigers had been bullying other villagers for years, according to the rules of the floating island, he had no right to stop them, so he could only watch the villagers be bullied by them.Now the Tigers had been wiped out and The Fish Dragons appeared. Many people hoped the latter would not oppress them. If The Fish Dragons didn\u2019t bully them, they didn\u2019t mind their existence and would even support it.Han Fei did not return to the plantation that day, but he led more than two hundred of his men to harvest the properties of the Tigers, which certainly included Li Jue\u2019s residence and his treasure house.The treasure house of the Tigers\u2026 No, of The Fish Dragons.Han Fei looked at the treasure in this room. There were a lot of knives, swords, and halberds, a trunk of mid-quality pearls, tentacles and shrimp whiskers, and a set of armor forged with fishbone, as well as some low-level combat skills. In addition to these, there were some ores, which no one knew where Li Jue got them from\u2026Han Fei muttered, \u201cSo poor.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter a while, Li Qing came and saluted, \u201cLeader\u2026\u201d\u201cJust call me Young Master.\u201dLi Qing paused and then said, \u201cYes, Young Master. The members of the Tigers who committed crimes or refuse to surrender have been expelled. And there are three fishing Young Masters of the Tigers who want to Join us. What do you think?\u201d\u201cHave they committed any crimes? Or killed any innocent people?\u201dLi Qing assured him, \u201cOnly one of them hasn\u2019t, the other two have.\u201dHan Fei instructed, \u201cExpel the two and bring that one to see me.\u201d\u201cYes, Boss.\u201dLi Qing felt very proud and elated now. At one time, he was worried that he would be targeted since he betrayed the Tigers. Now the Tigers were wiped out, which proved what a wise decision he had made! He had forgotten that he was actually persuaded by Han Fei.After a while, Li Qing led a person in, who was tall and looked a bit simple-minded.\u201cYoung\u2026 Young\u2026 Young Master.\u201dHan Fei blinked. \u201cWhat, what\u2026 What\u2019s your name?\u201dThis man was stunned for a moment.\u00a0Is the new leader laughing at me? But I can only put up with it now!\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019m Li Gan.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dLi Gan: \u201c???\u201d\u201cTalk less and do more. Then you won\u2019t be tired.\u201dLi Gan: \u201c???\u201dHan Fei was curious with this fisher. \u201cWhy have you never bullied others or killed innocent people although you\u2019re a fishing master of the Tigers?\u201dLi Gan stuttered, \u201cThey\u2026 They thought I\u2026 I\u2026 Would\u2026 Disgrace them\u2026 When\u2026 I was\u2026 Out with them.\u201dHan Fei felt a bit suffocated.\u00a0If I were Li Jue, I wouldn\u2019t have taken you out with me either. You haven\u2019t finished your words yet even when the fight is already over. Isn\u2019t it embarrassing?Han Fei could only say, \u201cIn the future, you will be an important member of The Fish Dragons. As long as you do not violate the principles of our gang, no one dares to laugh at you!\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Yes\u2026 Young\u2026 Young Master.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It hasn\u2019t been repaired yet.\u201dHan Fei looked back and asked seriously, \u201cDon\u2019t you think this casino will affect the image of the Heavenly Water Village?\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u201dA member immediately came out and said, \u201cYoung Master, this casino is quite a money-making business. It can make us a lot of money every day! As for the image of the Heavenly Water Village, does the Heavenly Water Village have a certain image to uphold?\u201dHan Fei rolled his eyes at him and asked, \u201cDid anyone go bankrupt because of gambling?\u201dThe man smiled embarrassedly, \u201cWell, occasionally.\u201d\u201cThen how do we deal with those who can\u2019t pay back the gambling debt?\u201dThe man waved his fist. \u201cNo one dared repudiate a debt! They could only work from dawn to night to earn money to pay off debts.\u201dSmack\u2026Han Fei slapped the guy\u2019s head. \u201cStupid! Can\u2019t you tell I want to abolish this casino?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dSomeone stood up and said, \u201cYoung Master, if you abolish casinos, we\u2019d be making a lot less money!\u201d\u201cStupid. Is there only one way to make money? Come in with me.\u201dHan Fei sat on the table. \u201cI\u2019d like to create a new way of gambling in the Heavenly Water Village\u2026 Bah\u2026 A new way of entertainment in the Heavenly Water Village. A-Gang, go get me 108 Green Turtle scales.\u201d\u201cYes, Boss.\u201dSoon, the scales came, and Han Fei took out a knife and carved something on the scales. Then he said, \u201cA-Gang, Li Qing, Li Gan, come and sit down here.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThe three of them froze for a while.\u00a0Why did Young Master ask us to sit down?Han Fei instructed, \u201cCome on, sit down. All the members of The Fish Dragons, come in. Let me show you a new kind of game. The fun is no less than gambling.\u201dEveryone came in with a stupefied look and many scratched their heads. This new leader behaves so oddly! But what is the new form of entertainment?\u201cLook, here are 108 scales, 54 of which are repetitions. Look, this is a small White Shrimp, which stands for 1. This is a Prawn, which stands for 2\u2026 This is a Mantis Shrimp, which stands for black joker. This is a big Meat Turtle, representing a red joker.\u201dAfter half an hour, many people were eager to try. This was really simple and fun! With the 108 cards, four people could draw various combinations of cards.Han Fei and the other three were playing the cards in high spirits.Li Gang announced, \u201cTwo Sevens, two Blade Fish.\u201d\u201cTwo Eights, two Tentacle Lobsters.\u201d\u201cTwo, two\u2026 Two Tens, two Snakebelts.\u201dHan Fei chimed in, \u201cBomb, four big Yellow Fish.\u201d\u201cBomb, five small White Fish.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u201dHan Fei said proudly, \u201cFull house, three Tentacle Lobsters and two Blade Fish. I\u2019ve won! Give me money\u2026\u201dEveryone\u2019s face turned purple. No, not again! They secretly made up their minds that they must practice their card skills when they were free. This is f*cking fun!Although they looked so frustrated when they lost, they just needed to pay five sea coins, which was almost affordable to anyone.Han Fei put away the money, stood up, and said, \u201cOkay, have you learned it?\u201dMore than a hundred people all shouted, \u201cYes, Young Master! \u201dSomeone said, \u201cYoung Master, that\u2019s really fun, even more fun than gambling.\u201dSomeone asked, \u201cYoung Master, can I manage this new casino in the future?\u201dSmack!Han Fei was annoyed. \u201cIt\u2019s you again! What\u2019s your name? Is this a casino? From today on, it\u2019s called the Fish Dragon Card Room. The rule is that the amount of money for each match cannot exceed five sea coins\u2026 However, if anyone wants to come to play in the card room, he shall pay one low-quality pearl each hour.\u201dThe young man quickly gave a smile. \u201cYoung Master, my name is Chen Eryu. I\u2019ve remembered the rules. I\u2019ll allow no one to break the rules of The Fish Dragons.\u201d\u201cGood. Then you\u2019ll be in charge of the Fish Dragon Card Room. Tell those who have no money but want to play the game to go home and play by themselves, understood?\u201dChen Eryu nodded. \u201cGot it. I\u2019ll tell them to go home and f*ck themselves if they don\u2019t have the money.\u201dSmack!Han Fei was helpless. \u201cWhy do you have to put it that way? Anyway, If anything goes wrong, it\u2019s your responsibility.\u201dOthers were envious. Chen Eryu was really lucky! Leader gave him this fun Fish Dragon Card Room so easily! I should have strived for it!Han Fei said, \u201cOkay, now I have a question for all of you. Does anyone see a business opportunity from my behavior just now?\u201dSomeone quickly raised his hand and said, \u201cI do, I do.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dThe man smiled and said, \u201cBuild a hundred Fish Dragon Card Rooms and collect money every day.\u201dHan Fei sneered, \u201cF*ck off, who else knows?\u201dAnother man raised his hand.\u201cYou, speak.\u201dThe man hurriedly said, \u201cYoung Master, let\u2019s start with a low fee and when they become addicted to it and more people want to play the game, we\u2019ll raise the fee.\u201dHan Fei pointed at this man. \u201cAnyone kick him for me, thanks!\u201dBAM!Someone stood up and kicked that man, shouting, \u201cBullshit! Young Master, I know.\u201d\u201cIf you give me a wrong answer too, I\u2019ll have you pressed to the ground and whipped ten times with a fishing rod.\u201dThe man\u2019s face turned pale but he still said timidly, \u201cYoung Master, let\u2019s make a lot of Green Turtle scale cards and sell them to those in need.\u201dSmack\u2026Everyone shrank their necks and thought this guy was beaten too, but it turned out that it was Han Fei who patted his own thigh.Han Fei asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201dThe man shrank his neck. \u201cYoung Master, my name is Li Baixia.\u201d\u201cGreat! You\u2019re damn smart. You\u2019ll be in charge of making Fish Dragon Cards. Pick 10 people from the members to assist you. If it\u2019s not enough, you can hire people from outside and pay them a salary. I will teach you the art of printing later. Try to master it as fast as you can.\u201dLi Baixia was stunned and then smiled from ear to ear. \u201cYes, Young Master, I\u2019ll try my best. You have my word!\u201dMany people cast envious stares at him. Why the heck didn\u2019t I think of that?Suddenly Han Fei glanced at the crowd again and asked, \u201cSo, who saw business opportunities from Li Baixia\u2019s idea?\u201dSomeone immediately shouted, \u201cYoung Master, I know.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dThe man said, \u201cRecruit a large number of off-staff members to manufacture the cards, and at the same time send dozens of regular members of the Fish Dragons to inspect the whole Heavenly Water Village. If anyone dares to secretly manufacture the cards, break their legs.\u201dHan Fei turned black and shouted, \u201cPress him to the ground and whip him ten times with a fishing rod!\u201dThe man was stunned. \u201cAm I wrong? This is very logical!\u201dAfter the man was whipped, a thievish-looking guy said, \u201cYoung Master, I, I know.\u201dHan Fei narrowed his eyes. \u201cThink it over! Otherwise, you will be whipped too!\u201dThe man scratched his head. \u201cWe can open a shop respectively on the 12 streets in the four fairs. Then arrange people to explain the rules of Fish Dragon Cards to the people passing by\u2026 And we have to tear down the signs of casinos in front of everyone and put up the sign that reads \u201cFish Dragon Card Room\u201d to arouse everyone\u2019s curiosity.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHan Fei\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up. \u201cNot bad! Your IQ is almost 180 compared to them. What\u2019s your name?\u201dThis man\u2019s eyes immediately shined. \u201cLi Duoyu.\u201d\u201cGood! Li Duoyu, you can pick 12 people from the official members of The Fish Dragons to be the managers of \u201cFish Dragon Cards Stores,\u201d and recruit some shop assistants from outside and pay them salaries.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, I swear I won\u2019t let you down, Young Master!\u201dMany people rubbed their heads in regret.\u00a0The answer was so simple! Why didn\u2019t I think of it?!Someone asked, \u201cYoung Master, is there any other business opportunity?\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t too many business opportunities, OK? Let\u2019s go to the next shop, the biggest one. I\u2019m going to investigate the location of hot pot restaurants.\u201dThe hundreds of people immediately followed Han Fei to the next place, all flushing and excited, feeling that their lives had reached a high point. They seemed to see that white, shining mid-quality pearls had fallen into their pockets.As soon as they went out, Han Fei saw an acquaintance.Han Fei scratched his head. \u201cGrandpa Leader, why are you here?\u201dVillage Leader replied,\u201dWell, I\u2019m here to see if the new leader of The Fish Dragons has bullied my people in the Heavenly Water Village or not.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had frequently heard about Han Fei from Wang Jie and Old Jiang and was sure that he wouldn\u2019t throw his weight around, but this guy was too flamboyant.\u00a0You are only 12 years old! Why do you act as if you are the village leader? Do you have to take a hundred people with you when you go out?The village leader called Han Fei to the side. \u201cDid you really kill Li Jue?\u201d\u201cBy a fluke.\u201dThe village leader was silent for a moment. \u201cGo to my house when you\u2019ve got time. I think it necessary to retest your spiritual heritage. There may be something wrong with the previous test.\u201dHan Fei rolled his eyes.\u00a0Is it alright? I can\u2019t upgrade my spiritual heritage now, so perhaps there won\u2019t be any problem to retest it?Han Fei pretended to be glad. \u201cReally? Great! Grandpa Leader, I also think the spiritual heritage test had something wrong happen. When I was tested and injected spiritual energy into that stone, it suddenly broke\u2026\u201dThe village leader was surprised. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that earlier?\u201dHan Fei scratched his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t normal! I thought I just needed to put my hand on it.\u201dThe village leader was curious. \u201cCome with me. Let me test you again.\u201d\u201cWait a minute, Grandpa Leader, it\u2019s not that urgent. You see, I\u2019m training my staff now. The Tigers have just disintegrated and The Fish Dragons have just emerged. There are a lot of things for me to deal with.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dThe head of the village leader\u2019s face turned black.\u00a0What do you mean there are a lot of things for you to deal with? You\u2019re just a gang leader. Are you so busy? Do you think you\u2019re the village leader?The village leader calmly said, \u201cThen come to my house as soon as possible. I will wait for you at home.\u201d\u201cOK, I will.\u201d\u2026After seeing off the village leader, Han Fei led the more than one hundred members to inspect the stores in the east fair. He picked the largest store in the fair that was as large as nearly 500 square metres.\u201cA-Gang, we\u2019ll rent this store.\u201dLi Gang questioned, \u201cAh? Young Master, the rent for this store is quite a lot. It will charge this number a month.\u201dHan Fei looked at the one finger Li Gang raised, asking, \u201cOne hundred mid-quality pearls?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ten.\u201dHan Fei was helpless. \u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss! I thought it charged one hundred! Just rent it\u2026\u201dLi Gang nodded, thinking to himself,\u00a0Young Master, do you know how hard it is to make money?!\u00a0But then he remembered that he could earn 10 mid-quality pearls a day from the barbecue stall, so a hundred pearls didn\u2019t really seem like a lot.Han Fei instructed, \u201cGet me a piece of paper.\u201dSoon, Han Fei quickly drew a floor plan on the paper and handed it to Li Gang. \u201cI\u2019ll give you three days to sort out this store\u2026 By the way, let Li Qing take care of the barbecue stall.\u201dLi Gang\u2019s face suddenly changed and he whined, \u201cYoung Master, no! Did I do anything wrong? Young Master, the barbecue stall is my life!\u201dSmack\u2026Han Fei gently slapped his head. \u201cYour life is here! Do you know that this hot pot restaurant will be ten times more profitable than the barbecue stall?\u201d\u201cAh? That\u2019s impossible!\u201dLi Gang rubbed his hands.\u00a0Ten times more! How much money is that?! That\u2019s simply unimaginable!Someone immediately shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll do it if you don\u2019t. Young Master, pick me.\u201dLi Gang quickly turned around and sullenly scolded, \u201cGo away! I am a founding member of the Fish Dragons. Who the heck are you?\u201dHan Fei turned to Li Gan, \u201cLi Gan, you will have to keep an eye on the Card Room and hot pot restaurants in case anyone makes trouble. You and A-Gang can get 5% of the profits.\u201d\u201cOkay! I\u2026 I promise\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026\u201dHan Fei cupped his head in his hands. \u201cOkay, okay! Stop talking. I know you\u2019ll complete the task.\u201d\u2026In the evening.\u2026Han Fei came with barbecue and liquor, only to see Old Jiang wandering around the vinegar vat.\u201cGrandpa, I\u2019m back.\u201dWithout looking back at him, Old Jiang just grunted. \u201cThis vinegar smells better and better now. Make me drunk shrimp tonight. I\u2019d like to drink some liquor.\u201dHan Fei agreed. \u201cNo problem! Where is Sister Qin?\u201d\u201cShe hasn\u2019t come back yet!\u201dHan Fei blinked. \u201cGrandpa, let me make you a \u2018hard dish\u2019 tonight!\u201dThe old man turned his head. \u201cA hard dish? How hard is it? My teeth are not so good. I want a softer one.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c\u2026\u201dIn the evening, when Jiang Qin came back from work, she smelled an exotic fragrance, which was very appetizing. She knew Han Fei was back.When Jiang Qin came in, she found that five dishes were already on the table, and there was one more dish in the pot. Old Jiang was sneakily putting drunk shrimps into his mouth like a thief.Jiang Qin was helpless. \u201cGrandpa, have you washed your hands?\u201d\u201cMy hands are clean. Look\u2026\u201dOld Jiang grabbed a ball of water from the void and washed his hands with it. Seeing this scene, Han Fei was really envious.\u00a0This trick is amazing! I must work out a way to make Old Jiang teach me it.Old Jiang looked around. \u201cBrat, is your \u2018hard dish\u2019 ready?\u201dJiang Qin hadn\u2019t heard of such a thing before. \u201cHard dish?\u201dOld Jiang was suspicious. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He said it was hard.\u201dHan Fei came carrying something. \u201cHere you are.\u201dHan Fei first brought a brazier shelf over and then put the pot on it. \u201cWho is going to lift the lid?\u201dOld Jiang directly lifted the lid without delay.When the lid was lifted, Old Jiang was fascinated. This must taste terrific! The smell alone was so attractive! It smelled different from barbecue but no worse than the barbecue at all.Jiang Qin swallowed. \u201cIs this a fish?\u201dHan Fei said with a smile, \u201cAccurately, it is a big Yellow Croaker hot pot.\u201d\u201cHot Pot?\u201dOld Jiang pointed to the brazier shelf. \u201cJust put a pot on the brazier?\u201d\u201cYes! That\u2019s right! It was served together with a fire and a pot.\u201dOld Jiang asked, \u201cThis dish is not hard! Can you introduce it?\u201d\u201cCough, OK. In this hot pot, I added 7 kinds of spiritual fruit seasonings, 12 kinds of spiritual fruit ingredients, and stewed it for half an hour.\u201dHan Fei introduced other dishes by the way, \u201cThese are side dishes. There are hot and sour potato shreds.\u201dOld man retorted, \u201cThis is a yellow ball\u2026\u201d\u201cPotato sounds much better than Yellow Ball. Let me finish.\u201dOld Jiang closed his mouth.\u201cThis is Dragon-Beard Cucumber.\u201dOld man mocked him, \u201cThis is Long Green Melon.\u201dHan Fei was helpless. \u201cI know, but cucumber sounds nicer! Can you stop interrupting me?\u201dJiang Qin rubbed her face.\u00a0Can\u2019t you just let me taste the dishes?Han Fei continued, \u201cThis is drunk shrimp. You have eaten it. This is Sweet and Sour Sweet Peppers and Peanuts. It\u2019s a dish that goes with wine\u2026 This dish is even more amazing, Fried Shrimp Balls! Peel fresh shrimp, remove their guts, cover them with a layer of mashed beans, and then pan-fry them in oil. It\u2019s golden-looking, crispy, juicy, and fragrant\u2026 OK, we can eat them now.\u201dThe mouths of Old Jiang and Jiang Qin were almost watering as they listened to Han Fei\u2019s introduction.\u00a0Oh, the dishes sound really delicious! We want to taste them now!The three of them immediately picked their chopsticks and poked them at the big Yellow Croaker in the hot pot. The eyes of Old Jiang and Jiang Qin lit up as they took the first bite.Old Jiang said with a mouthful, \u201cIt has the fragrance of Evergreen Mushroom and the smoothness of Sweet Grass. Huh? As well as the sweetness of Seven-Leaf Flower, yummy, yummy\u2026\u201dJiang Qin put a Fried Shrimp Ball into her mouth. The crispy, juicy ball burst in her mouth, which made her want to fly.This night, Old Jiang drank half the jar of liquor and almost ate all the dishes.With plenty of food and drink, Han Fei whispered to Old Jiang, \u201cGrandpa.\u201d\u201cHuh? What?\u201d\u201cYou have been in the Heavenly Water Village for so long. Have you ever thought of making a little contribution to the villagers?\u201d\u201cWhat can I contribute? They have hands and feet. No one stops them from fishing!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mean that. Fishing is only for making a living, but with delicious food, we can have more pursuit, more enjoyment, more leisure, and more fun\u2026 The ordinary fishermen work from dawn to night and do fishing day after day, which is really boring! Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d\u201cSounds reasonable, but what\u2019s it to do with me?\u201dHan Fei smiled slyly. \u201cGrandpa, the spiritual fruits in our plantation are too much to eat and most of them end up rotting in the soil. What a waste\u2026 So why don\u2019t you contribute them to the villagers? Then they\u2019ll be aware that you have a heart of gold!\u201dJiang Qin felt unable to hear it anymore. God knows where Han Fei learned these bamboozling words. She could guess the result. It seemed that the plantation was going to change hands quickly!Jiang Qin shook her head.\u00a0Why did you let this guy in? Look, it has only been a few days and your plantation has become his!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As we have been despising the evil deeds of the Tigers, now we\u2019ve decided to ban all casinos and resolutely resist gambling\u2026\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201dSomeone exclaimed, \u201cReally? Are you guys going to give up such a profitable business?\u201dSome people didn\u2019t believe it. \u201cIs it because you\u2019ve worked out a more profitable business?\u201dChen Eryu continued, \u201cPlease let me finish. Our current leader Han Fei is very young and talented. He is not that kind of wicked and evil guy! He understands that people need entertainment, so he spent\u2026 Uh, a year\u2026 To invent Fish Dragon Cards for all of you\u2026 Although the casinos are banned, you can still have healthier entertainment!\u201d\u201cFish Dragon Cards, what are those?\u201d\u201cDo you charge for this?\u201d\u201cIs it a gambling game?\u201dChen Eryu cleared his throat and said, \u201cFish Dragon Cards are a must-have game. It\u2019s cheap but fun, and you can play it at home, with your family, or with your friends. It\u2019s dozens of times more fun than gambling\u2026 Our leader said that it\u2019s definitely not a gambling game, but everyone can have much more fun than gambling from it\u2026\u201dSomeone shouted, \u201cWhat do the cards look like? We want to have a look.\u201dSomeone echoed, \u201cYes! Although you\u2019ve talked up this game, we don\u2019t know how to play it. You\u2019ve gotta tell us how to play it!\u201d\u201cYeah, hurry up! Or else we\u2019re leaving!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll still charge for it, right?\u201dChen Eryu said, \u201cBro, will it cost you money to buy a big Yellow Croaker? Who can tell me how much a big Yellow Croaker is?\u201dSomeone immediately replied, \u201cBig Yellow Croakers are cheap. I can buy two or three with a low-quality pearl.\u201dChen Eryu said with a smile, \u201cOkay! This chum said that he could buy two or three Big Yellow Croakers with a low-quality pearl. Then I tell you that with the same low-quality pearl, you\u2019ll be able to buy two sets of Fish Dragon Cards. And you don\u2019t have to pay anymore\u2026 Surprised? Glad to hear that?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cHow is it possible? How can there be such a cheap game?\u201d\u201cGo on bragging. Then how do you make money?!\u201dChen Eryu smiled kindly. \u201cMy dear fellows, you don\u2019t have to worry about how we make money. Anyway, we won\u2019t earn your hard-earned money. Come here, there are some tables here. You can sit down first. Let me show you how to play Fish Dragon Cards.\u201d\u2026Half an hour later, a strange scene appeared in the Heavenly Water Village. In the east, west, south, and north fairs, 13 groups of people gathered.These people were in a group of four, sitting opposite one another, chattering away.\u201cThree plus two, three large Yellow Croakers and two small White Fish.\u201d\u201cBomb, four small White Fish.\u201d\u201cHaha, mine is bigger than yours! Four big Yellow Croakers.\u201d\u201cHumph, four Tentacle Lobsters.\u201dThe other three: \u201c\u2026\u201dSuch sounds rose one after another and were almost ceaseless.Next to them, a lot of people were lining up.\u201cAh! I want 10 sets of Fish Dragon Cards.\u201d\u201cI was here first! I want 4 sets of Fish Dragon Cards.\u201d\u201cI want 6 sets\u2026\u201dThe members of The Fish Dragons were crazy busy. They thought that 200 people were enough to cope with this situation, but who could have thought that the products would sell so hot?One member shouted, \u201cPlease be quiet, because the number of Fish Dragon Cards is limited, each person can only buy 2 sets. Please purchase now. We don\u2019t have many left.\u201dOnly at this time, the members understood why Leader said that the cards had to be printed, not hand-painted, and made a printing template. Look how popular the goods were! They sold out in less than an hour.Ten minutes later\u2026Dozens of Fish Dragon Card Rooms announced, \u201cEveryone, our inventory has been sold out. Please come back tomorrow.\u201dSomeone failed to buy one and grumbled, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? Anyway, it\u2019s made with Green Turtle scales. I\u2019ll make them myself.\u201dHowever, a member of The Fish Dragons immediately said, \u201cAnyone who fails to get one can make it yourself! It doesn\u2019t matter. The Fish Dragons will not force you to buy our Fish Dragon Cards. Our principles are fairness, justice, and serving the people wholeheartedly.\u201dBut some people sneered immediately. \u201cOnly idiots will make them themselves! These cards look simple, but who can draw this little White Fish or Blade Fish so vividly? I will come back in line tomorrow\u2026\u201d\u201cYes! I can\u2019t draw these pictures!\u201dMany people who originally planned to make one themselves immediately dismissed this idea. And the person who spoke first thought to himself,\u00a0Um, it\u2019s really easy to be an influencer!On that day, according to incomplete statistics, 2,102 copies of Fish Dragon Cards were sold. Many people followed the trend to buy them before they even figured out what it was. And when they bought them and learned the rules of the game, they were overjoyed. I was so smart to buy one!The first official meeting of The Fish Dragons.Li Gang said unhappily, \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve sold so much, we earned less than selling barbecue. We sold a lot but the price is too low!\u201dChen Eryu assured him,\u201dBrother Gang, although we didn\u2019t earn much from Fish Dragon Cards, do you know how much our Card Rooms made today?\u201d\u201cHow much?\u201dChen Eryu made a gesture. \u201cAt least 8,000 low-quality pearls.\u201dLi Gang\u2019s eyes widened. If the money earned from selling Fish Dragon Cards were added, they\u2026 They earned 100 low-quality pearls in one day?Li Qing was surprised. \u201cThe barbecue stall has earned 36 mid-quality pearls today.\u201d\u201cYoung Master said that hot pot restaurants were more profitable than these two. If this is true, then how much can a hot pot restaurant earn?!\u201d\u2026Heavenly Water Village, Wang Family.The patriarch of the Wang Family looked at the pile of Green Turtle scales in his hand and said, \u201cAre these Fish Dragon Cards?\u201dThe Second Young Master of the Wang Family said, \u201cPatriarch, that\u2019s right! They are really fun.\u201dSmack\u201cAll you know is to play. Look at your third brother. Now he is already in the town. In the future, he must be the best armorist of the Wang Family. But look at yourself, what else do you know besides playing?\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s really fun, Patriarch!\u201dA moment later, after playing a few rounds of Fish Dragon Cards, the patriarch of the Wang Family couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cIt\u2019s interesting. How did Han Fei come up with such a game?!\u201dSecond Young Master replied, \u201cPatriarch, let\u2019s manufacture it! I heard that The Fish Dragons are not against others copying it, saying that they will not take this business as their own.\u201dSmack\u2026The patriarch of the Wang family sclded angrily, \u201cYou idiot! All you know is to copy others! Do you know The Fish Dragons did that purposely?\u201d\u201cAh? Why?\u201dThe patriarch of the Wang family narrowed his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t forget what the name of this game is, Fish Dragon Cards. In two days, this name will be known to every villager in the Heavenly Water Village. If we copy it, what name shall we use? If we don\u2019t use this name, people won\u2019t buy it. But if we use it, people will think our Wang Family has been annexed by The Fish Dragons.\u201dThe second Young Master said angrily, \u201cWhat a vicious guy! Patriarch, let\u2019s find a chance to kill him. This brat is even more difficult to deal with than Li Jue!\u201d\u201cShut up! What makes you think you can kill him? And how can our Wang Family bully a child? Then what will the villagers of the Heavenly Water Village think of us?\u201dThe patriarch of the Wang family murmured, \u201cHan Fei, you\u2019re really something. But why do you stick to a small place like the Heavenly Water Village? Even if you outshine the Wang Family in the Heavenly Water Village, so what? This is a world valuing strength!\u201d\u2026In two or three days, The Fish Dragons had become a hot topic among the villagers of the Heavenly Water Village.Someone exclaimed, \u201cHave you heard? The Fish Dragons subsidized over 500 out-of-school children. That\u2019s really nice of them!\u201dSomeone nodded. \u201cYes! The Fish Dragons don\u2019t bully people at all and they pay money when they buy something.\u201dSome people wondered, \u201cAren\u2019t they supposed to pay money for things?\u201dThe former one sneered, \u201cThe Tigers never paid before.\u201dSome people echoed, \u201cIndeed, they\u2019re much better than the Tigers. I heard that The Fish Dragons are planning to build hot pot restaurants recently. It is said that hot pot is even more delicious than barbecue. Let\u2019s go taste it when the restaurants open?\u201d\u201cSure\u2026\u201d\u201cCount me in.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go together.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe village leader lived in the center of the Heavenly Water Village, which was the closest place to the statue of Sea God, so it was easier for the villagers to find him.Carrying a bottle of liquor, Han Fei came for his appointment, only to find the village leader looking worried.\u201cGrandpa Leader, here I am. What did you want to see me about?\u201d Han Fei questioned.The village leader forced a smile and said, \u201cHi, Han Fei! Oh, you brought me a gift. Thank you. Come on in.\u201dThe village leader\u2019s home was plainly decorated and a bit like Han Fei\u2019s own hut. It was said that the village leader\u2019s family died in a fishery and after that, this old man had been living alone.Han Fei put the liquor bottle on the ground and said, \u201cGrandpa Leader, are you in trouble?\u201dThe village leader was surprised. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cWell, I can tell from your look. Do you need my help? We, The Fish Dragons, are always ready to help others.\u201dThe village leader was speechless.\u00a0Ready to help others? The Fish Dragons had almost become a chamber of commerce. Ready to earn money from others was more correct!\u201cHan Fei, I had thought you would go to the town so that you could avoid not only the Tigers, but also any other troubles. But I didn\u2019t expect that Li Jue would die by your hands. This was really beyond my expectations\u2026\u201dHan Fei replied simply, \u201cI used a secret weapon Tang Ge gave me.\u201d\u201cHoho!\u201dThe village leader just smiled. How could such a little boy tell a lie without batting an eyelid?\u201cOK, now let\u2019s test your spiritual heritage! If what you said is true, the last test must have been wrong.\u201dHan Fei agreed, \u201cOK!\u201dThe village leader took out a stone and solemnly said to Han Fei, \u201cPut your hand on it and inject spiritual energy into it.\u201dHan Fei did what he said. In fact, he agreed to retest his spiritual heritage because he wanted to figure out what that flashing black light he saw last time was.As he injected spiritual energy into the stone, a brilliant yellow color burst out in no time.The village leader took a deep breath. \u201cIt was wrong last time. You\u2019ve got a level-three, mid-quality spiritual heritage, almost high-quality.\u201dHan Fei wasn\u2019t excited at all though. Ignoring the excited babbling of the village leader, he stared closely at the stone. At the last moment, he saw a flash of black light again. It flashed across so quickly it was almost undetectable.\u201cSure enough, there must also be black in the spiritual heritage test, but I don\u2019t know what level black represents.\u201dThe village leader said excitedly, \u201cHan Fei, aren\u2019t you excited? Haha, that\u2019s great! I found one more great talent for our village! I think you can be a great fishing master in the future, or even a Dangling Fisher!\u201dSeeing that Han Fei was so calm, the village leader was surprised. \u201cAren\u2019t you excited?\u201dHan Fei scratched his head. \u201cActually, when I broke through to be a fishing master, I already had a hunch that my spiritual heritage should be higher than my testing result, so I\u2019m not surprised!\u201dBut Han Fei did ask, \u201cLeader, can you keep this secret for me?\u201dThe village leader asked, \u201cKeep it a secret? Why?\u201d\u201cYou know, I am a low-key person. I don\u2019t want so many people to know this. Names are debts. I think it\u2019s more fun to let others think that I only have a level-one, high-quality spiritual heritage.The village leader: \u201c\u2026\u201dNames are debts? Although a level-three, mid-quality spiritual heritage was not bad, it wasn\u2019t that good. You should go to the town to have a look!The village leader explained, \u201cThis is wrong. For example, before if you wanted to go to the town, you might have needed my recommendation, but now, you can directly go to the town. But although you have a level-three, mid-quality spiritual heritage, you\u2019re still too ordinary in the town. The Heavenly Talents in the town mostly have level-four spiritual heritages, the most excellent ones have level-four, high-quality ones or even level-five ones.\u201d\u201cUh! I haven\u2019t been to the town yet!\u201d Han Fei exclaimed.The village leader solemnly said, \u201cSooner or later.\u201dHan Fei quickly diverted the topic. \u201cLeader, I know that yellow light erupts for spiritual heritages below level four, blue light for level four to six, and purple for level 7 and above. Is there any color superior to purple? What color is it?\u201dThe village leader thought for a moment. \u201cWhy do you ask this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m curious! I wonder if anyone in the city has a spiritual heritage even superior to purple ones.\u201dThe village leader shook his head. \u201cIt is said that there are some, but I haven\u2019t seen any yet. That kind of monster is rarely seen even in a hundred years. Don\u2019t think too much about it.\u201dHan Fei frowned slightly.\u00a0Really? Is black superior to purple?At this time, the village leader said, \u201cHan Fei, are you really not going to the town? If you want to go now, I can still work out a way to send you there!\u201dHan Fei shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not ready yet.\u201dWhat he said was true. The village was very close to the sea, and every time he went to sea, he always gained something by accident. He didn\u2019t want to leave here so quickly. Besides, it was simply an insult to him that he would have to be an auditor for three years before he was admitted to the town\u2019s school. Only when he was confident that no one in the town could beat him would he go to the town.The village leader pondered for a while. \u201cSince you don\u2019t want to go, then I won\u2019t force you. But since you don\u2019t go to the town, as a fishing master, you can\u2019t just fool around with The Fish Dragons and the plantation, put aside your proper business.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c???\u201d\u201cHan Fei, do you know why the fishing masters in our village are so few. Why is it so rare to see fishing masters in the streets and even the port?\u201dHan Fei asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t it because there are only few fishing masters?\u201d\u201cFew? Haha, there are nearly 500 graduates from the four schools of our village who can become fishing masters every year. In fact, the number of fishing masters in our village increases by about 100 every year. Where have these people gone? Have you even thought about this?\u201dHan Fei was surprised.\u00a0So many?\u201cDid they go to a level-one fishery?\u201dThe village leader nodded. \u201cDo you know what a level-one fishery is?\u201dHan Fei scratched his head. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a good place for fishing masters to fish? Ordinary fishermen can\u2019t handle the demonic fishes there and great fishing masters don\u2019t wish to go there. So only fishing masters will go there.\u201dThe village leader shook his head. \u201cWrong.\u201d\u201cWrong?\u201d\u201cBefore explaining this matter, I think it necessary to tell you about the classification of fisheries.\u201dHan Fei was instantly interested. He knew nothing about level one, two, or three fisheries. Although there were many chances in ordinary fisheries, there wouldn\u2019t be as many as in higher-leveled fisheries.\u201cThe Heavenly Water Village is under the Blue Sea Town. It is said that during ancient times, a Blue Sea Wandering Dragon fell in the town, so the town was named Blue Sea. Including the Heavenly Water Village, the Bihai Town governs 8 floating islands that are respectively named Water, Wood, Rain, Wind, Moon, Sun, Fire, and Heart. Among them, the Heavenly Heart Village is the closest to the Blue Sea Town and is the strongest, followed by the Heavenly Moon Village and Heavenly Sun Village, and then Heavenly Wind Village and Heavenly Fire Village\u2026 The Heavenly Water Village, Heavenly Wood Village, and Heavenly Rain Village are the weakest\u2026 The eight villages share one level-one fishery extending for three thousand miles.\u201dHan Fei exclaimed, \u201cEven our village\u2019s ordinary fisheries extend one thousand miles and they\u2019re also exclusive to our village. Why does the shared level-one fishery only extend for three thousand miles?\u201dThe village leader sighed. \u201cDo you know what kind of fishery is the most prevalent in the hundreds of thousands of miles of sea areas around us?\u201dHan Fei shook his head.\u201cOrdinary ones. Not all sea areas are dangerous. Legend has it that a peerless hero found ordinary fisheries suitable for living, so he wielded his power to drag floating islands over and placed them around these fisheries, so there are the Heavenly Water Village, Blue Sea Town, and even Thousand Star City.\u201dHan Fei secretly took a breath, feeling a little incredulous.\u00a0What the hell? Someone dragged the floating islands over and placed them here? Only God could do that!The village leader continued. \u201cIn fact, an ordinary fishery doesn\u2019t extend for a thousand miles. This is just an estimate. Some people have measured it and found it was actually 800 miles or so. 800 miles away, there will be demonic fishes that only appear in level-one fisheries, although they\u2019re extremely rare. And ordinary and level-one fisheries are not geographically contiguous. There is a middle area between the two, which is called the mixed zone. It\u2019s like a buffer zone, in which there are both fishes of ordinary fisheries and level-one fisheries.\u201d\u201cThen if the fishing masters of our Heavenly Water Village want to go to the level-one fishery, they will have to fly thousands of miles or even two thousand miles?\u201dThe village leader nodded. \u201cYes, the eight villages surrounding the level-one fishery. Some people speculated that this was actually a trial field created by the creator of the floating islands.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Fei thought to himself,\u00a0If the first-level fishery was surrounded by the eight villages, where was the second-level fishery?The village leader seemed to know Han Fei\u2019s thoughts as he said, \u201cThe level-two fishery is further away, two thousand miles away from the eight villages.\u201dHan Fei was surprised. \u201cSo, it is not that we have surrounded the level-one fishery, but that the level-one fishery and the level-two fishery have surrounded us?\u201dThe village leader nodded with a smile. \u201cExactly!\u201d\u201cThen what about the level-three fishery\u2026\u201dThe village leader glanced at Han Fei. \u201cDo you know why the fisheries other than those fisheries we mentioned above is called the Place Unknown?\u201dHan Fei shook his head.\u201cThe level-three fishery has surpassed the range that the villages can explore. A great fishing master in the level-three fishery is just like a fisherman in the mixed zone and there is a good chance that he\u2019ll die there. So the level-three fishery is not around the villages but lies in a remote area and can only be reached through the teleportation circle in the town.\u201dHan Fei nodded and continued to ask, \u201cWhat about the Place Unknown?\u201d\u201cAs you become stronger, you will know more about it. Even I don\u2019t know much about it. Well, I think you\u2019ve understood the classification of level-one, two, and three fisheries. Now let\u2019s talk about the level-one fishery.\u201dThen he took a meaningful look at Han Fei. \u201cDo you know what the significance of the Fishing Trial is? The parents of those children knew that their children may die, why did they still make them participate in it? Why do parents cry over their child\u2019s death but do not regret it?\u201dHan Fei tried to guess. \u201cIs it for the level-one fishery?\u201dThe village leader nodded. \u201cYes, the level-one fishery is far more dangerous than the Fishing Trial. When you get there, you may meet people who you don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t even know who will suddenly pop up, trap you, or even kill you. So what is most dangerous is not the fish, but people.\u201dHan Fei took a deep breath. He could imagine how fierce the competition was as the eight villages had to share one single fishery. Now he finally understood why people allied but then fought each other in the Fishing Trial. If a village couldn\u2019t form an alliance within itself, internal strife tended to occur. Then even if the village got a treasure, the villagers would fight each other for who would keep it.Han Fei suddenly remembered something and said to the village leader, \u201cThe power of demonic fishes. Tang Ge once told me that the power of demonic fish could be absorbed by us.\u201dThe village leader glanced at Han Fei with appreciation. \u201cYes, he was right.\u201d\u201cIt is said that even a common fisherman can absorb the power of demonic fish. Can we directly absorb the power from demonic fishes from the level-one fishery?\u201d\u201cHaha! It\u2019s not that simple.\u201dThe village leader seemed to be glad to see him so ignorant.Han Fei: \u201c???\u201dThe village leader explained, \u201cI think you\u2019ve once witnessed the so-called power of demonic fish. At least a lot of members of The Fish Dragons have it, so did Li Jue, but we call those demonic fishes contractual spiritual beasts.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHan Fei looked at the village leader in amazement. \u201cHow could it be? If they are contractual spiritual beasts, why did I only see Li Jue and Li Gang have them? No other people seem to have them\u2026\u201dThe village leader\u2019s face turned solemn. \u201cSo, this is why all villages have to enter the level-one fishery. The failure rate of ordinary fishermen or fishing masters to sign contracts with common demonic fishes of the first-level fishery is too high, mainly because those ordinary demonic fishes are too low-leveled and have no spirituality. So those who fail can only get some strength from the demonic fish but cannot make a contract with them. But as you remember, Li Jue\u2019s Tiger-Head Fish was quite spiritual, right? It\u2019s of a rare species, which is essentially different from ordinary fishes.\u201dHan Fei was curious. \u201cSo, are there a lot of rare demonic fishes in the level-one fishery?\u201dThe village leader shook his head again. \u201cNo, only a small amount of rare demonic fishes or those mutated from ordinary demonic fishes. The level-one fishery is only this big, but so many people rush in to catch demonic fishes, so it is not uncommon for people to kill and steal. Sometimes, when someone of a village acquires a rare demonic fish, the other villages will even besiege this village together.\u201d\u201cWhat for?\u201dThe village leader smiled bitterly. \u201cFor restricting the development of other villages. Once a village has a genius, the benefits he will bring to that village are unexpected\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the benefit? Is Tang Ge considered a genius?\u201dThe village leader nodded. \u201cSure! Did you know that when Tang Ge was taken away by the angel it caused a sensation in the town and other villages?\u201d\u201cThat makes sense. Perhaps even in the town, there hadn\u2019t been a person with a level-seven spiritual heritage before!\u201dThe village leader sighed. \u201cYes! But it is both a blessing and a curse. Since Tang Ge had been taken away by the angel, our Heavenly Water Village should move to where the Heavenly Heart Village is and replace it.\u201dHan Fei was stunned. \u201cExcuse me? Grandpa Leader, wait a minute, can the floating islands move?\u201dThe village leader smiled. \u201cYes, this is because of the formation left by the ancient peerless hero, which was to intensify the competition among the villages and cultivate stronger people\u2026 Forget it. Why do I nag on so much?! Sorry, people talk more as they get older\u2026 I tell you this because every fishing master in the villages has a task.\u201dHan Fei asked seriously, \u201cWhat task?\u201dThe village leader said solemnly, \u201cScramble, scramble for rare demonic fishes. As you know, all schools in our village give students free Spirit Swallowing Fish soup, which is also for fulfilling a task. Every village has an unwritten rule that every fishing master should go to the level-one fishery as much as they can and catch Spirit Swallowing Fish as much as they can. In theory, every fishing master shall catch 500 pounds of Spirit Swallowing Fish a month.\u201dHan Fei blinked. \u201cThen I\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have been a fishing master for three days, right? You still have 27 days to catch 500 pounds of Spirit Swallowing Fish. Of course, if you can contract a spiritual beast, you don\u2019t have to catch fish\u2026 By the way, absorbing the power of demonic fish is not counted because the power of the demon fish is no match for that of a contractual spiritual fish.\u201dHan Fei almost fainted.\u00a0Shit! I had thought my day had come and was thinking about how to expand The Fish Dragons! It turns out that I\u2019ll have to go to the level-one fishery to grab resources. If I happen to meet two peak-leveled fishing masters at the same time there, I\u2019ll be dead meat!The village leader smiled. \u201cHan Fei, you are still young. Don\u2019t envy the fishing masters who can stay in the village. They have already paid a heavy price. Even Li Jue had killed more than 10 fishing masters from other villages and interrupted the spiritual-beast signing contracting process of the people of the other villages twice.\u201dHan Fei felt as if there were ten thousand Iron-Head Fish galloping in his heart.\u00a0No, I am still a child!With that said, the village leader handed him a book. \u201cTake it. This is the mantra for contracting a spiritual beast. Learn it by heart as soon as possible. Don\u2019t waste your time on trivial matters such as The Fish Dragons.\u201dHan Fei rolled his eyes.\u00a0I\u2019ve just become a gang leader! And I haven\u2019t established a glorious image in the villagers\u2019 heart yet! Why do I have to go back to cultivate again?!\u2026He returned to the plantation.Jiang Qin happened to be in the plantation today.Han Fei laughed. \u201cSister Qin, don\u2019t you go to work today?\u201d\u201cI took the day off.\u201d\u201cOK! Sister Qin, can I ask if you have a contractual spiritual beast?\u201dJiang Qin responded by asking him, \u201cWhy do you ask me this? Are you going to the level-one fishery?\u201dHan Fei scratched his head. \u201cThe village leader came to me today and asked me to catch 500 pounds of Spirit Swallowing Fish every month. He also wanted me to scramble for demonic fishes with the others! But I\u2019m so young. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have any chance to win over others. I might as well catch Spirit Swallowing Fish!\u201d\u201cHoho!\u201dJiang Qin sneered. \u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have a chance? Then how can you explain Li Jue\u2019s death? How do you have the cheek to play weak?\u201dAs Jiang Qin turned her eyeballs, with a flash, a blue lobster appeared in front of her.\u201cAttach!\u201dHan Fei was startled as Jiang Qin suddenly threw a punch at him.\u201cSister Qin\u2026\u201dClang\u2026Han Fei held up his rod to block her fist but was still sent flying through the air.Han Fei crawled out of the vegetable garden with tears. \u201cSister Qin, why did you suddenly beat me?\u201d\u201cI just showed you the power of a contractual spiritual beast. I only used the power of a junior fishing master. How do you feel?\u201dHan Fei was shocked. Only the power of a junior fishing master? But why was the attack power so strong?Han Fei immediately said, \u201cNo, Sister Qin, I\u2019ve fought Li Jue. Even if he had had his Tiger-Head Fish attached to him, he had not exceeded the limit of a fishing master, nor had the strength of a great fishing master. But when your contractual spiritual beast attached to you, your strength seemed to rise by two levels.\u201dJiang Qin nodded. \u201cAccurately speaking, my strength climbed from that of a junior fishing master to an intermediate one, but still a step away from that of an advanced fishing master after Little Blue attached to me. Li Jue wasn\u2019t this strong because the Tiger-Head fish he got was a mother and son pair. He gave the son to his son Li Hu. After the death of his son\u2019s fish, the strength of the mother fish was greatly reduced. You are lucky.\u201dHan Fei broke out in a cold sweat.\u00a0So, if I hadn\u2019t killed Li Hu, I might not have been able to beat Li Jue?\u201cGosh, this world is dangerous.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/God of FishingCH 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThat night, Han Fei summoned his men over.\u201cI will cultivate in seclusion this month. Now I\u2019ll give you the method for making hot pot. If you are successful, you can popularize it. I\u2019ll have to prepare for a trip to the level-one fishery.\u201dUpon hearing mention of the level-one fishery, Li Gang and the others looked scared.Li Gang asked, \u201cSo soon?\u201d\u201cYoung\u2026 Young Master, don\u2019t\u2026 Be\u2026 Believe\u2026 Anyone.\u201dHan Fei doubted how Li Gan could survive, but since he could stay in the Heavenly Water Village, he must have done a lot of things in the level-one fishery. He was certainly not as silly as he looked.The next day.Han Fei asked for leave from Old Jiang, went to the cultivation hall of The Fish Dragons, and started to cultivate in seclusion. Old Jiang mocked that he had never heard of a little brat like him cultivate in seclusion! That it was funny!Old Jiang didn\u2019t know how many secrets Han Fei had. If he did, he wouldn\u2019t say.This was the first time Han Fei started to practice Indestructible Body Art since he returned. After all, the cultivation of the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing was something that would take a long time to do, and the effect was definitely not as fast as the Indestructible Body.In front of Han Fei, there were 20 bottles of Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid and more than 100 Mantis Shrimp Beads.At this moment, Han Fei seemed to be steamed, his teeth clenched tightly, and sweat on his head kept flowing down.Shit! This Indestructible Body is too f*cking cool! It will actually burn the skin of my whole body with spiritual energy from the inside out, one layer after another, repeated 5 times!Han Fei was shocked. The human skin was divided into 5 layers, namely the stratum corneum, the transparent layer, the granular layer, the spinous cell layer, and the basal layer.What the Indestructible Body aimed to do was to strengthen the five layers of skin to be bulletproof. Thus, the skin had to be burnt countless times.Fortunately, Han Fei discovered the benefits of Mantis Shrimp Beads, which helped ease his pain.One day.Two days.Five days.Ten days.Han Fei didn\u2019t know how many times he repeatedly burnt his skin with spiritual energy. When he cut his skin with a Blade Fish dagger, his skin wasn\u2019t cut at all. He seemed to have achieved some progress.The next step was to temper his skin with spiritual energy. Of course, Ren Tianfei didn\u2019t have any spiritual energy at that time. The method he used was boxing, but his boxing method was not recorded and he thought that, unlike him, the person who inherited his Art should have spiritual energy, so there were actually two ways to practice this step. Ren Tianfei\u2019s method was more difficult while the one Han Fei adopted needed a lot of spiritual energy.But Ren Tianfei would never expect that Han Fei\u2019s spiritual energy storage would have no upper limit.When Han Fei consumed 10,000 points of spiritual energy, he had basically acquired the Indestructible Body Art, and this step only took him half an hour. If it were someone else, they would have to spend at least two months to collect 10,000 points of spiritual energy and cultivate, provided they could use all the stored spiritual energy on skin tempering. But it took time to accumulate spiritual energy! So Han Fei reckoned that if it were someone else, it would take them over 3 months at least, but he only needed half an hour.Oh, it\u2019s so f*cking difficult. This is just skin tempering. What will I still have to suffer to temper my flesh?Han Fei shivered as he remembered how painful it felt while tempering his skin.Han Fei stabbed himself with an ordinary Blade Fish dagger only to hear a click, and the dagger was broken\u2026Wow, that\u2019s awesome!Han Fei was dumbfounded. The Indestructible Body is so powerful! A Blade Fish dagger that can cut anything in ordinary fisheries was broken when it cut his body! In addition to a little pain, he felt nothing except for leaving a shallow white mark on his skin that could be easily rubbed away.Han Fei took out a mortal-level dagger made with the Demon Purification Pot and gently poked his skin with it.His skin remained intact. Han Fei thought to himself,\u00a0Am I not exerting enough strength?\u00a0So he used almost half of his strength this time.This time, Han Fei saw an obvious white mark on his skin, but it still didn\u2019t bleed.OK, this time let me use seventy percent of my strength.\u201cOuch\u2026\u201dLooking at the blood mark appearing on his arm, Han Fei realized that his skin was not truly bulletproof. After all, it was a mortal-level dagger made with the calabash. However, it suddenly occurred to Han Fei that he would be able to block 70% of the attack force from an enemy of the same level as him even if he was hit, but the weapon the other party used should be at least of mortal level, high quality. If it was just a Blade Fish dagger or something similar, it might be broken directly.Haha! Great\u2026 I\u2019ve only made small progress in practicing the Indestructible Body. What if I completely master it? The point is that I can practice it all the way down! I can practice it when I become a great fishing master, so can I when I become a Dangling Fisher\u2026Han Fei had realized the power of the Art. An art that required 100 million points of spiritual energy to deduce certainly couldn\u2019t be simple!In the last 10 days, Han Fei used 7 bottles of Iron Fish Body Polishing Fluid, 49 Mantis Shrimp Beads, and more than 16,000 points of spiritual energy. This was a great consumption. If it was converted into mid-quality pearls, there must be hundreds of them.Well, it\u2019s impossible to master this Art to the fullest extent in such a short period of time. I might as well practice the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing to increase the strength of my entire body.After another 7 days, Han Fei found that his upper limit of spiritual energy was stuck at 599 points.He looked at the data.: Han Fei: 13 (Junior Fishing master): 140,006 (599): Level Three, Mid-Quality (Upgradable): Twin Yin-Yang Spirit Swallowing Fish: Purple Bamboo Rod: Void Fishing, Chapter 1: Hook Kiss (Mortal Level, Divine Quality)\u2026The upgradeable button for his spiritual heritage remained gray. But his upper limit of spiritual energy seemed to be less! Han Fei felt that his upper limit of spiritual energy increased quickly when he was still a fisher, but now it was increasing more and more slowly. It would only rise by a dozen points or so each level he upgraded.No, there must be a way to continue to increase my upper limit. Since both my spiritual heritage and level have been upgraded, my upper limit of spiritual energy should also be increased.Han Fei did not dwell on this problem. After all, in terms of the upper limit of spiritual energy, even a peak-level fishing master was no match for him now.Han Fei calculated the time he had spent. It took him 17 days to practice the Indestructible Body and the Incomplete Monograph on 108 Ways of Body Polishing, plus 3 days he spent before, so now he only had less than 10 days!Han Fei took out the method given to him by the village leader on how to contract a spiritual beast.Huh? Do I have to recite these words?Yes, it was not difficult to contract a spiritual beast. You just needed to recite some words, or to be precise, a mantra.\u201cI swear with my essence and blood, spiritual energy, and Sea God, and hereby brand the contract in my mind\u2026\u201dHan Fei frowned. This contracting method seemed a bit strange. Why should the contract be branded in my mind? But then he thought this was just a ceremony, and he didn\u2019t have to worry too much.So Han Fei started to recite the mantra, thinking this would only take him one hour at most.However, when Han Fei was reciting it, the blood welled up inside him and he couldn\u2019t mobilize his essence and blood, and the oath could not be branded into his mind at all.After trying for five or six times, Han Fei failed.\u00a0Was this that difficult to recite? If it was, why should I go to a level-one fishery as soon as I became a fishing master?Subconsciously, Han Fei wanted to see if the Demon Purification Pot had a way to solve this problem, but when he looked at it, he found there was a word Demon \u201cPurification\u201d next to \u201cRefining.\u201d\u201cDemon Purification?\u201dHan Fei curiously clicked on it, only to be reminded that it required 50,000 points of spiritual energy to activate it.Gosh\u2026 This is robbery!No, wait\u2026 Is it because of this that I can\u2019t recite it? Otherwise, why would the word \u201cDemon Purification\u201d happen to appear at this time? This is doubtful\u2026\u201cActivate.\u201dNo matter if Han Fei was willing or not, he would have to spend 50,000 points of spiritual energy anyway. Since he still had some spiritual energy left, he might as well activate it now.After fifteen minutes, Han Fei was dumbfounded.The so-called demon purification was to fuse different demons and transform them into a new life?\u201cDamn, that\u2019s terrific!\u201dHan Fei took a deep breath. In this way, he would be able to fuse demonic fishes without limit until a rare or even more advanced demonic fish was produced? And it didn\u2019t need any stupid contract.Han Fei muttered,\u00a0Demon Purification Pot, is this magical skill your core function?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I never felt this energetic before. I think no one can beat me now.\u201dThe two guards: \u201c\u2026\u201dOne of them said, \u201cYoung Master, during these days, the village leader had sent for you twice, and they said they would come again today\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy? Are they afraid I ran away?\u201dOne guard answered, \u201cNo, the village leader just asked you to go to his home as soon as you finished your cultivation.\u201dHan Fei nodded. \u201cGot it, I\u2019m going to\u2026 Oh, by the way, how is it going with the hot pot restaurants?\u201dSpeaking of the hot pot restaurants, these two people immediately became excited. \u201cYoung Master, you won\u2019t be able to guess how many people visited the restaurants that day, from noon to late at night. All the hot pot restaurants were so full of people who were full of praise for the food that they almost wanted to lick the hot pot clean!\u201dAnother person hurriedly said, \u201cYoung Master, the turnover of the opening day reached this number.\u201dThe man raised his open palm and showed five fingers.\u201c500 mid-quality pearls?\u201dThe man exclaimed, \u201cYoung Master, you really are a god! It is exactly 500 mid-quality pearls and our brothers were all beside themselves with joy.\u201dSmack\u2026Han Fei slapped the head of the man. \u201cJust tell me how much it is next time. Why did you ask me to guess? I almost thought it was 5000!\u201dThis person felt very aggrieved.\u00a0How could it be 5000?! 5000 mid-quality pearls\u2026 That\u2019s too much!\u2026Han Fei happily walked out of The Fish Dragons and seeing the sun outside, he felt refreshed and wondered if he should invite Old Jiang and Sister Qin to eat hot pot at a hot pot restaurant tonight.But then he gave up the idea. Neither of them liked crowded places. He might as well make a hot pot for them at home.\u2026The home of the village leader.\u201cGrandpa Chief, here I am,\u201d Han Fei announced.The village leader was looking at a piece of paper, and hearing Han Fei come in, he said, \u201cHave you finally finished your cultivation?\u201d\u201cYes! Now I\u2019m ready for combat.\u201dThe village leader nodded with approval. \u201cOK! What a coincidence. In one hour, you\u2019ll be going together with three other fishing masters.\u201d\u201cAh? Why so urgent?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t plan to wait for you, but you happened to come here. But it\u2019s not bad. You can\u2019t be a weakling since you could kill Li Jue. This time, three fishing masters from our Heavenly Water Village were killed in the level-one fishery and now we are preparing to support our men.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dHan Fei was a little shocked.\u00a0Were three fishing masters killed so easily?The village leader sighed. \u201cThey were trapped. Aren\u2019t you going to the plantation to say goodbye to Old Jiang before you go?\u201dHan Fei thought about it. It seemed unnecessary. He could imagine Old Jiang\u2019s reaction. He would just grunt as a response without even lifting his eyelids.\u201cForget it! But Grandpa Leader, shouldn\u2019t you give my fishing boat back?\u201dThe village leader agreed, \u201cSure, they would have used your fishing boat even without you.\u201dHan Fei: \u201c\u2026\u201dIn less than an hour, the village leader called the other three over and they immediately set off with Han Fei.After about fifteen minutes, the four of them were already in the sky.Han Fei\u2019s white fishing boat was very fast, three times faster than ordinary ones, but only Han Fei knew that it could be over ten times faster than the fishing boats of the Heavenly Water Village. A middle-aged man was steering the fishing boat. The other two on the boat were a man and a woman who were both young people under 25 years old.At the moment, except for the middle-aged uncle, the other two were both looking at Han Fei.The girl exclaimed with a smiley face, \u201cWow! Are you Han Fei? A 12-year-old fishing master, you look so cute\u2026\u201dHan Fei: \u201c???\u201dThen she directly rubbed Han Fei\u2019s head.Han Fei\u2019s face immediately turned black. \u201cYoung lady, please behave yourself.\u201d\u201cTitter.\u201d\u201cAre you afraid that I\u2019ll eat you? It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen a 12-year-old fishing master. You\u2019re really cool!\u201dThe young man was also looking at Han Fei up and down. Seeing Han Fei\u2019s helpless expression, he almost burst into laughter, but when he thought of the mission of this trip, he couldn\u2019t laugh.Of course, no one took Han Fei as a weakling. How could a weakling kill Li Jue, wipe out the Tigers, and kill a fishing master of the Tigers under the public eye?The girl rubbed Han Fei\u2019s head again and said, \u201cMy name is Chen Jia\u2019er. This brother\u2019s name is Zhang Peng, and he is Uncle Cao. He is very strong.\u201dThe middle-aged man turned his head and smiled. \u201cMy name is Cao Fei. Little Han Fei, this is the first time you have come to a level-one fishery. You must follow us closely. This is a place ten times more dangerous than the Fishing Trial.\u201dHan Fei assured him, \u201cUncle, don\u2019t worry about me. My strength has improved greatly recently. I\u2019m confident I can defeat my enemies easily.\u201d\u201cHoho!\u201dCao Fei was speechless.\u00a0You speak as if our enemies are a bunch of big Yellow Croakers. Boy, you\u2019re still young. You still have time to kick the bad habit of bragging!Zhang Peng shook his head slightly.\u00a0This kid is too confident. He had no idea how cruel the level-one fishery was!This thousand mile-long journey would have taken them 6 hours, but with Han Fei\u2019s fishing boat, it only took them less than 2 hours.When they landed on the level-one fishery, the other three were shocked. The fishing boat gifted by the angel was really great!Cao Fei said solemnly, \u201cGet ready for combat\u2026 Zhang Peng, release the Spirit Chasing Shrimp.\u201dSeeing Han Fei\u2019s puzzled look, Chen Jia\u2019er explained it to him with a smile, \u201cThe Spirit Chasing Shrimp is Zhang Peng\u2019s contractual spiritual beast. It can find the location of any specific person according to his spiritual energy.\u201d\u201cHe can track people? That\u2019s amazing.\u201dHan Fei was a bit shocked.\u00a0Wow, fortunately, this shrimp is rare. If everyone had one, would I be chased around if I offended someone?Cao Fei instructed, \u201cJia\u2019er, please tell Han Fei about our respective skills and spiritual beasts.\u201dChen Jia\u2019er turned serious. \u201cHan Fei, listen well! I\u2019m a junior peak-level fishing master and my spiritual beast is a Crayfish. After fusion, my combat strength barely reaches the intermediate peak.\u201dWith that, Chen Jia\u2019er said, pointing to Zhang Peng, \u201cZhang Peng is also a junior peak-level fishing master. His spiritual beast is a Lightning Crab. It is extremely fast in combat and has strong attack power. It is also the only spiritual beast with a combat skill of its own in the level-one fishery. It can transform spiritual energy into a claw and then strike as fast as a bolt of lightning to kill the enemy in an instant, but it will consume a lot of spiritual energy. Zhang Peng is stronger than me after fusion, but not by much.\u201dHan Fei was surprised.\u00a0Can a spiritual beast have its own combat skills? Transform spiritual energy into a claw? These people\u2019s spiritual beasts are really excellent!In the end, Chen Jia\u2019er introduced, \u201cThis is our captain, Cao Fei, an advanced fishing master, only one step away from the peak. His spiritual beast is a Swordfish who has great attack power. If you\u2019re in danger in combat, you can run to the captain for help. Of course, if the captain is fighting a master of the same level, you\u2019d better not do it.\u201dWhen she finished, all three looked at Han Fei.Han Fei blinked. \u201cWell, I, Han Fei\u2026 Um, I\u2019m a junior peak-level fishing master. My spiritual beast is Spirit Swallowing Fish, and my combat power won\u2019t be increased after fusion.\u201d\u201cHuh? You\u2019re already a junior peak-level fishing master?\u201dCao Fei looked back at Han Fei in surprise.Han Fei perked up. \u201cYes! Peak level! If I give my strength to a full swing, my comprehensive combat power can equal that of an intermediate\u2026 Peak-level fishing master.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIntermediate peak-level?\u201dZhang Peng was stunned. \u201cHan Fei, are you sure?\u201dCao Fei said seriously, \u201cHan Fei, it\u2019s a matter of life and death. No kidding.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not kidding! My strength is very strong. If I punch an intermediate peak-level fishing master, he may vomit at least three liters of blood\u2026\u201dEveryone: \u201c???\u201dThey all went speechless. Why three liters? Not more or less? But they were also relieved. It was great that he wasn\u2019t a burden. Although they were shocked by Han Fei\u2019s strength, they still needed to confirm it in actual combat.About half an hour later, Han Fei saw five fishing boats chasing each other in the distance.Cao Fei shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s get into battle and sprint at full speed.\u201dAt this very moment, however, Han Fei whispered, \u201cUncle Cao, can you tell which are the enemy\u2019s boats? Just hit their boats with mine. Don\u2019t worry. My boat won\u2019t be damaged.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only three people were still holding out and fighting on the bow. Seeing the reinforcements come, they immediately collapsed to the boats.On the three fishing boats from the Heavenly Sun Village, however, there were six people still fighting. Now they were dumbfounded. Where was this white fishing boat from? How dare it aim to ram our boats?Cao Fei roared, \u201cKill!\u201dBAM!With a bang, the keel of a fishing boat belonging to the Heavenly Sun Village was directly hit and broken while another was sinking. The people on the two ships jumped to the two other fishing boats.Everyone was dumbfounded, including the people from the Heavenly Water Village. How could this white fishing boat be so sturdy as to not be damaged at all?The people on the two fishing boats of the Heavenly Water Village suddenly shouted, \u201cKill them!\u201dA young man from the Heavenly Sun Village sneered, \u201cEven if your reinforcements have come, so what? We\u2019ll have reinforcements too! Now only four of you can still fight\u2026 Gee, look what I see, a child! Have you been weaned yet, little kid?\u201dCao Fei ignored this person and quickly said, \u201cWe each will be responsible for one person. Zhao Dabai, try to keep two enemies at bay. None will be left alive today.\u201dZhao Dabai was the person who asked for reinforcements. His face was pale but he still gritted his teeth and said, \u201cOK!\u201dHan Fei frowned. They didn\u2019t seem to be able to hold out any longer! Zhao Dabai and the man and woman seemed to have been seriously injured, and now even their hands were shaking.But Cao Fei, regardless of this, had pounced past.Chen Jia\u2019er shouted, \u201cFuse.\u201dZhang Peng followed suit. \u201cFuse.\u201dCao Fei as well. \u201cFuse.\u201dTheir momentum instantly soared as they jumped onto the fishing boats of the Heavenly Sun Village.BAM! BAM! BAM!The fierce battle unfolded in an instant and someone was injured immediately after the fight started.Zhang Peng purposely let his enemy injure him and then his Lightning Crab suddenly turned spiritual energy into a large claw and grabbed at the other party. At the same time, Zhang Peng rushed forward though his body was pierced by a Swordfish phantom.Han Fei was shocked.\u00a0So this is combat in the level-one fishery? Are all the battles here started so fiercely?At the same time, Cao Fei shouted, \u201cHan Fei, fight!\u201dAs soon as Han Fei heard it, he moved. As spiritual energy flashed across in his Purple Bamboo Rod, he hit one enemy with it.\u201cHaha! Is there no man in the Heavenly Water Village? I can\u2019t believe they sent a brat here! Entangle\u2026\u201dHan Fei narrowed his eyes and suddenly saw a big squid whose dozens of tentacles were about to entangle him. And the rod in the man\u2019s hand was also flashing with spiritual energy. Obviously, he was going to launch another blow at Han Fei.BAM!To the man\u2019s surprise, Han Fei\u2019s power was too strong and he had also been fighting for a long time. Although he took Spirit Refilling Pills, his physical strength was almost exhausted. So he was immediately sent flying through the air by the blow from this kid!The young man shouted, \u201cAttention, this kid is not right! Someone come help me.\u201dWhen the people of the Heavenly Water Village heard this, they all looked at Han Fei in amazement. Was this kid stronger than they thought? Especially the three who had almost lost their combat power, their eyes suddenly lit up.Zhao Dabai shouted, \u201cYou bastards from the Heavenly Sun Village, let me teach you a lesson! Come, fight me!\u201dAlthough Han Fei repulsed the man with his rod, he withdrew his rod in the next second and two knives that were wrapped with spiritual energy suddenly appeared in his hand. He struck dozens of blows into the void with the knives.\u201cOh!\u201dThe young man struggled to get up as if he was badly injured.However, Han Fei was already in front of him and the advantages and disadvantages of rods and knives immediately manifested themselves. The long rod in the hands of the young man lost its power in such a short distance while the double knives in Han Fei\u2019s hands danced like flying butterflies.BAM! BAM! BAM!In a blink of an eye, Han Fi had chopped the young man with a dozen blows and broke the spiritual energy protective cover over his body. Suddenly Han Fei felt as if there was a suction cup trying to suck him away.\u201cGurgle, Gurgle\u2026\u201dJust after a few seconds, the young man looked at the boy in front of him in fright. He found that he had no strength to fight back in this head-on combat. The double knives had left dozens of wounds on his body and now he was dripping with blood.\u201cNo\u2026\u201dThe young man howled in despair.\u201cHow dare you\u2026 Zhao Dabai, get the fuck out of the way!\u201dBAM\u2026Zhao Dabai and the other two were shaken away by a strong concussive ripple. Han Fei looked sideways, only to see a sturdy young man angrily jumping at him.Han Fei casually kicked the badly-injured fishing master from the Heavenly Sun Village into the sea and chopped at the sturdy young man.\u201cDing Yang, you killed Ding Yang, you damn thief from the Heavenly Water Village\u2026\u201dEveryone was surprised. No one ever expected that the first one who killed an enemy turned out to be a kid, but Zhao Dabai and the others cracked a smile.\u00a0This kid is terrific! He is so young but already so powerful!Clang, Clang, Clang\u2026Han Fei kept hacking and slashing with his knives and the man seemed to be about to launch a spiritual energy explosion attack at him, but Han Fei was not afraid at all as he kept hacking at him.With a loud bang, Han Fei stepped back five or six steps, and his double knives turned around in his hands and were firmly held by him. Two long wounds appeared on that man\u2019s chest and blood spurted out.Just when Han Fei was going to attack again, a figure flew to his side. He took a look.\u00a0Huh? Isn\u2019t this Chen Jia\u2019er?Chen Jia\u2019er was injured. She spat out a mouthful of blood while asking, \u201cMy enemy\u2019s spiritual beast is a Sturdy Armor Turtle. Zhao Dabai, can you beat him?\u201dZhao Dabai smiled bitterly. \u201cI\u2019ve run out of spiritual energy!\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Maybe I can help you.\u201dBefore Han Fei finished, Chen Jia\u2019er had joined the combat again, because the man fighting her got a chance and turned to attack Zhang Peng. Zhang Peng was injured and certainly wouldn\u2019t survive the attacks of two fishing masters.Han Fei took a breath, raised his hands, and guided the spiritual energy in his body. Soon, two columns of spiritual energy entered into Zhao Dabai\u2019s body.\u201cDamn\u2026\u201dZhao Dabai and another woman were stupefied. Was this boy a spirit gatherer?Not only was Zhao Dabai stunned, but everyone else froze, so did the people from the Heavenly Sun Village. Such a young spirit gatherer? Why didn\u2019t this kind of talent go to the town?\u201cNot good, he is a spirit gatherer! Kill this boy. The Heavenly Water Village already had Tang Ge. We can\u2019t let them have another genius\u2026\u201dHowever, Zhao Dabai suddenly roared, \u201cWho dares to touch anyone from the Heavenly Water Village? Do you think I\u2019m dead?\u201dZhao Dabai and the wounded woman joined the battle, and the situation immediately reversed. As for the remaining person, he was too far away from Han Fei, so Han Fei couldn\u2019t transmit any spiritual energy to him. Just then, the sturdy man was rushing at him like crazy.The spiritual beast of this young man was a crab whose defense and attack powers were not weak. He had fused with his spiritual beast and now his combat power almost equaled that of an intermediate peak-level fishing master. He seemed to be enraged and his momentum was getting stronger and stronger.Zhao Dabai frowned and said to Han Fei, \u201cWatch out for the demonic fish power of his Ball Fish, kid.\u201dHan Fei also frowned.\u00a0Can fishing masters get power from demonic fishes repeatedly? Did this guy also have a contractual spiritual beast?\u201cExplode!\u201dThe young man roared and hundreds of needles suddenly shot out in all directions. Han Fei who was right in front of him would certainly be subject to the greatest damage.The sturdy young man sneered.\u00a0These are the poison stings of Ball Fish. Surprised? Enjoy! Brat from the Heavenly Water Village, you\u2019re doomed!Cao Fei roared and tried to rush over, but was smashed back by his opponent with his rod.The other people from the Heavenly Water Village were all worried. They knew how dangerous a Ball Fish could be. This boy was a 12-year-old spirit gatherer, as well as the hope of the Heavenly Water Village! Would he die the first time he went out for a mission?But the next second, everyone was stunned, and the sturdy young man also widened his eyes.Clinks and clangs were heard continuously from Han Fei\u2019s body as the countless Ball Fish stings transformed away from spiritual energy, failing to leave any marks on Han Fei\u2019s body.Han Fei scratched his head. \u201cHave you finished your attack? Now it\u2019s my turn.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
