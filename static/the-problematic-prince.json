    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 \u2013 Poisonous Mushroom On A Day Of SpringErna Hardy was a well-mannered girl.Now that she grew up into a polite lady, it was her turn to be a refined wife.To sum up the content of the lengthy paragraph, it was a very different reply than what she expected as it especially destroys her chance to be a good wife to a decent man.\u201cNo way.\u201dErna\u2019s eyes, which had been looking down at a letter for a long time, were full of determination as she said to herself.\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201dEven on second thought, the conclusion was the same. Standing up from her seat, Erna walked up to the window. It was an afternoon when the dazzling rays of the spring sun were pouring in, but it felt depressing.Opening the panes with a squeaky sound, she sat on the frame, holding her knees close to her chest. Located high above the ground, the village\u2019s landscape could be seen from the mansion of the Badens. Erna\u2019s gaze, briefly pausing on the single chair lying on one side of the garden, slowly wandered over to the gentle slope of the orchard, streams, and hills covered with yellow cherries.The world was not interested in one man\u2019s misfortune.It obviously made her uncomfortable. Even if she had a loving family and was on the verge of being kicked out of a place full of life, a world full of joyous spring was beautiful. If one heard this stupid complaint, they\u2019d laugh. She felt relieved, a bit of cynicism added to it.\u201cLady! Lady Erna!\u201dThe voice of Mrs. Grebe, a housekeeper, reached her from the far side of the hallway. It seemed like it was already time to have lunch.\u201cYes! I\u2019m here! I\u2019ll be right there!\u201dErna declared, hurriedly getting off the window frame. The ridiculous letter was hidden deep inside the drawer so that it could not be seen, and her disorganized clothes were tidied.She was fine.While heading to the dining room on the first floor, she murmured as if memorizing a spell.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Everything is going to be fine.\u201d\u201cHave you seen a lawyer, Erna?\u201dBaroness Baden, who had been rambling about today\u2019s weather and new sculptures, came up with it only after she finished eating. She tried to stay calm, but her eyes showed an indescribable nervousness.\u201cNo, grandma. Not yet.\u201dErna answered in a stern tone.\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to meet one before this week ends.\u201dSunlight that was penetrating through the glass of the window was falling on Erna, lighting up her neck and waist. Her heart was hammering loudly, her lips were drying up, and her fingers were curling up into a fist. Fortunately, the Baroness nodded without further questioning.\u201cYes, you should. I wish I could find a way.\u201dA gentle sigh permeated into the air of an overly still room.Erna looked up at her grandma as she stared at her hands on her knees. She had become old and frail in a month. She had lost her husband overnight and would hand over all her little assets to a relative who was no better than others. So how could Erna tell the truth?Erna had already sat back in her right posture, swallowing the dry lump in her throat. Her lips were stubbornly sealed, not to reveal the truth.Actually, she met a lawyer earlier. The answer that came was no different from what Erna already knew.Having no son, Baron Baden\u2019s property was to be inherited by his nephew.Erna had long known that such ridiculous laws exist. It was upsetting and unfair, but if there was no way to change the law, they had to come up with a countermeasure. It was about time that Erna began to raise money by increasing her work little by little. So that she could buy this house in a fair manner again one day, but that \u2018one day\u2019 arrived too early, and the money she collected was not enough.\u2018Unfortunately, that is how the inheritance law works, Miss Hardy.\u2019The lawyer consistently responded insincerely whenever Erna begged for a different way.\u2018For now, it would be best to explain the situation to Mrs. Baden and ask for mercy.\u2019The lawyer bit on his smoking pipe, ending his remark. It was a rude gesture, but Erna endured it. There weren\u2019t that many lawyers who welcomed customers who were in a difficult position to pay the consultation fee properly.That afternoon, Erna wrote to Thomas Baden. She had to do it, unable to find a suitable lawyer. And today, Thomas Baden\u2019s reply turned a faint-hearted repentance into utter despair and anger.\u201cEverything will be fine, grandma. Don\u2019t worry too much.\u201dErna, who lied, gave a smile to reassure her grandmother and got up from the table before putting on an apron. She was very skilled at helping Mrs. Grebe, who arrived slowly, to organize the table.Everything was not fine.While scrubbing the dishes, Erna accepted the truth that she could no longer avoid.It was not an exaggeration to say that the estate of Baron Baden, a fallen aristocrat, was now only this house in the countryside. However, the house was soon to be occupied by Thomas Baden, the legitimate heir. And he was going to sell this land without even a moment\u2019s hesitation.Erna breathed deeply in her suppressed anger. The soapy water, which resulted from the rough squeeze on the sponge, left a small stain when it reached her rolled-up sleeve and apron.Thomas Baden said he could fully understand her. However, because he had his own reasons, he could not delay the disposal of the house until Baroness Baden died.She wouldn\u2019t have felt this way if he only had expressed such a determined refusal.After washing the dishes, Erna headed to the backyard with her apron rolled up. When she sat on her grandfather\u2019s chair under the beautiful ash tree, her eyes burned up in tears.The ridiculous reply contained one compromise offered by Thomas Baden. If Erna Hardy married him, he was willing to be particularly generous.The view of the beautiful spring landscape became hazy, but she held back her tears with her eyes wide open. She didn\u2019t want to cry because of such a person. A father who treated his helpless relative, who was not yet living up to her age\u2026\u2026\u201cFather.\u201dShe muttered without realizing. She had forgotten about him for a long time, but she was sure he still existed in this world.\u2018Yes, father!\u2019Blinking her eyes, she leapt from her chair. The strings of the unclasped apron fluttered along with the spring breeze.What woke Bj\u00f6rn was the noise outside, which even closed panes and thick curtains could not block. The loud cheer that began in the river flowing next to the grand reservoir filled the dim bedroom.He tried to sleep again with his head buried under a pillow and a cushion, but he finally gave in.\u201cPeppy crazy bastards.\u201dBj\u00f6rn walked out of his bed, spouting abusive language. When he slid the curtain covering the western window, he spotted a group of people practicing rowing on the other side of the river.Every summer, on river Abit, which flowed across the city and into the sea, a rowing game of nobles was held. It was hard to do anything because the summers were too long to hold up buttery parties and gossip, but the problem was that the river was close to a large reservoir. It was difficult to get accustomed to this terrible noise from the spring when the practices usually began.Leaning obliquely against the window, Bj\u00f6rn\u2019s disgusted gaze sat on a narrow boat, glaring at the enthusiastic boys atop.\u2018You could rather have sex if you couldn\u2019t control your overflowing energy, you maniacs.\u2019It would be a much more beneficial hobby than a fleeing task when they needed to sweat unnecessarily. In the worst case scenario, they could even leave at least one child to make a minor contribution to the rise in the power of the kingdom\u2019s growth. Of course, it would be a headache in personal history, but the tragedy of the uncontrolled fools was none of his business.Taking a sip of warm water from the table, Bj\u00f6rn turned around, running his fingers through his messy hair. Wrapping a robe around him, he rang the bell that called his butler, Greg.Greg, who was well aware of the reason for the bell ringing at noon, rushed to report before his master asked.\u201cThe number of the teams participating this year increased, which made it a little noisier.\u201dChuckling at the tragic news, Bj\u00f6rn added.\u201cThey\u2019re very enthusiastic about Leonid Denyster about winning the championship, and a bunch of lunatics being bridesmaids.\u201d\u201cWould you like to move your bedroom?\u201d\u201cNah, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll prepare the meal.\u201d\u201cJust fruits. To the balcony.\u201dBj\u00f6rn, leaving a short order, entered the bathroom. After a long shower of cool water, a table on the balcony of the bedroom awaited him.He stared at the view under his feet, drinking a cold whiskey soda. The great fountain of water, known as the specialty of the Schwerin Palace, was dancing. Gold statues decorating the fountain and breaking water streams glimmered under the cremated spring star.Bj\u00f6rn\u2019s gaze reached the waterway where the stream of water flowed past the fountain and followed the slope of the stairs connecting the Grand Park and the garden. There was still a loud roar coming from the river Abit, which reached the end of the long waterway.\u201cHis Highness, the Prince has finished eating.\u201dGreg, who came in a hurry, said when Bj\u00f6rn was about to place his glass on the table.After wiping the remaining water off his finger with a napkin, Bj\u00f6rn nodded shortly, picking up an apple. Shortly after the butler left, Leonid entered the bedroom, striding up and sitting opposite to him. It was obvious that he ran away from the rowing practice.\u201cYour Highness, the Crown Prince.\u201dBj\u00f6rn greeted his younger brother elegantly, contrary to his arrogant posture with his legs crossed. When his head flicked, water droplets at the end of his platinum strands dripped down.With Leonid staring at him as if amazed, Bj\u00f6rn looked down at the great fountain in the garden. The crunchy pulp he took from the fruit was as sweet as the scent of flowers hovering in the wind.\u201cTell me what you need.\u201dAfter the servants had the prince\u2019s share of the ride withdrawn, Bj\u00f6rn faced Leonid with squinted eyes.Schwerin, where the Grand Duke\u2019s Palace was located, was a resort city where nobles of Letchen visited to spend the summer. It was still early, but the prince, who was crazy about coordination, moved to the Schwerin Palace early on and added in his brother\u2019s daily life.With a light sigh, Leonid replied by dropping the newspaper he had brought on the table. The first page of the famous tabloid, which specialized in social gossip, contained a large picture of its regular customer, Bj\u00f6rn Denyster.[Is the royal poisonous mushroom all right?]Bj\u00f6rn\u2019s forehead crumpled at the ridiculous headline.\u201cPoisonous mushroom?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? I thought it was your new nickname?\u201dPoisonous mushroom.After a slow review, Bj\u00f6rn laughed, putting down the paper. However, the fact that they put a pretty nice picture was a praiseworthy article.\u201cGladys is coming back to Letchen.\u201dLeonid, who was still looking at the side view of Bj\u00f6rn\u2019s face, carefully opened his mouth. Gladys. The scandal caused by the name erased the smirk off Bj\u00f6rn\u2019s lips.The tabloid\u2019s article, which he read thoroughly, also contained the news about Gladys Hartford, the princess of Lars, who decided to spend the summer in Letchen.A beautiful princess who was once loved by all of Letchen. But the return of the unfortunate woman, who was betrayed by her husband and lost her child, was indeed a gossip that people could go crazy about. With her ex-husband, who was once a prince but was now strategized as the poisonous mushroom, a more plausible picture would be created.\u201cAre you going to appeal, Bj\u00f6rn?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201dBj\u00f6rn\u2019s attitude was serious enough to make Leonid laugh.Bj\u00f6rn, who stopped taking a bite off the apple, wiped the juice from his fingers while leaning back on the chair. The eyes that did not contain much emotion were just calm.Spring. It was a good season for poisonous mushrooms to grow.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Love fateThe train to Schwerin entered the platform on time. It was around the time when the blue light of dawn had dissipated and the morning had just begun to arise.Erna, who was standing in a posture as stiff as a stick, walked up to the front of the carriage. The rural station, where the first train had just arrived, was quiet. After a few passengers hurried to board, Erna was the only person left on the platform.\u201cHey, miss. Aren\u2019t you going to ride?\u201dThe blunt question posed by the stationmaster awakened Erna, who had been in a daze.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dErna turned her eyes from looking around anxiously and faced the stationmaster. Her hand that gripped the trunk with all her might began to tremble slightly.You must have found the letter by now.Erna\u2019s eyes recalling the past incident deepened.She couldn\u2019t bring herself to tell her grandmother that she was going to meet her\u00a0 father. It was because she knew\u00a0 well that her stubborn grandmother, the Baron of Baden, would rather be left out on the streets than seek help from her son-in-law, whom she regarded as an enemy. Erna, who had been struggling, eventually left behind a letter explaining the situation, and took the path not quite ladylike.Father.As she repeated the strange name that gave her a foreign feeling, my heart beat faster.\u00a0 Their last meeting was at her mother\u2019s funeral, so it has been eleven years since she had been there. She knew that he was no different from a stranger, no, he was inferior to others, but for now, he was Erna\u2019s last hope. Maybe she\u2019ll get hit at his doorstep.Erna grabbed the trunk and took a deep breath, then raised her head to face the train standing in front of her. A heavy black iron gleamed menacingly in the morning sun.\u201cIf you don\u2019t ride\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh no!\u201dErna hurriedly shook her head and shouted. Her blue eyes gleamed with determination.\u201cSorry. I\u2019ll ride, I will ride!\u201dLove fate.Recalling that sentence that was the keynote of her life, Erna took a trembling step.This world doesn\u2019t care about a person\u2019s misfortune, so one\u2019s life must be managed by one\u2019s own strength. It is better to love all the fates that have come your way, since nothing can be changed by struggling with self-pity. If you love, you will work hard, and doing your best is better than resignation in any case.If it was a given fate to hang on to even a glimmer of hope, Erna was going to love that fate as well. In any case, Viscount Hardi was Erna Hardi\u2019s father. A person who has the duty to take responsibility for his child. But a person who has neglected that duty for a long time. But, even now, that person has to fulfill that duty.Leaving behind the stationmaster with a fierce expression, Erna hurriedly got on the train. Following the urgent gesture, the hem of her fine floral muslin dress fluttered. After leaving her hometown holding her mother\u2019s hand, after fourteen years, Erna was returning back.It was the beginning of a long journey.* * *Biern put down the teacup slowly. In a flawless and elegant movement he made\u00a0 a languid posture, crossing his long legs more prominently.\u201cAre you listening to me now?\u201dThe bewildered voice of a woman disturbed the stillness of the parlor which was full of spring sunshine.\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t want to answer? Maybe that article is real\u2014is it? Is it?\u201dThe voice of the woman who was angry was raised even more.With the hand that gently wiped his still-dry face, Biern grabbed the teacup again. As he drank another sip of the properly cooled tea, he felt that his dazed mind was clearing up.\u201cBiern!\u201dThe woman who couldn\u2019t beat him got up from her seat. A single ray of sunlight flowing through the window lit up the woman like a stage light. He was dressed perfectly, unlike the woman who had run from the capital to Schwerin at less than noon.Biern raised his eyes, now accustomed to sunlight, and looked at the woman. His gray eyes gleamed with a subtle brilliance like opal.It was around dawn when he returned home, and\u00a0 after a bright morning\u00a0 he took a shower and threw himself on the bed. So at least it\u2019s midnight for Biern. That means it was never a good time to wake up like this. [t1v: omg relatable af #depression]Biern opened his eyes, which was closed slowly, and leaned deeply against the back of the chair. From the window facing the river, the cheers of the group practicing rowing began to be heard.Good fucking morning.With a sigh mixed with laughter, Biern grudgingly picked up the newspaper thrown by the woman who approached him recklessly. The front page of a tabloid, such as the one that Leonit brought a while ago, was decorated with\u00a0 articles today.Rumors of\u00a0 reunion between the former crown prince and his wife, the private information obtained from the closest aides.Biern glanced at the grand headlines and large photos of himself, and began to read the article with narrow eyes.According to reports from close associates who requested anonymity, the atmosphere\u00a0 between the two was unusual. It is never wise to forgive an ex for such a shameful act, but Princess Gladys, who is weak at heart, seems to be swaying. Thanks to this, it is expected that Lechen\u2019s social circle will be hot this summer. Something like that, carefully written nonsense filled the space. It was evident that the newspaper was bad at everything but the ability to pick out the best photos. [t1v: aka ancient instagram]Biern smiled and put down the newspaper casually. The woman\u2019s face, who had been watching him while her breath holding her breath, was now red with a sense of contempt she couldn\u2019t hide.\u201cYou don\u2019t even have the heart to explain this, right?\u201dThe woman now clenched her fists with tears in her eyes.\u201cLet\u2019s break up.\u201dWith a sharp voice she exclaimed, as if making a solemn declaration. With a cigar between his lips, Biern looked up to face the woman.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any reason to continue this relationship any longer. I think I need to get engaged before the end of this spring.\u201dContrary to the triumphant tone of her voice, the woman\u2019s eyes showed an impatience that could not be hidden. Biern stared at her slowly and lit the end of the cigar.She was not a bad lover.She was moderately elegant and moderately vulgar, and above all, it was because they were well aware of the premise of their relationship where they would return to their own lives after having a refreshingly enjoyable time. No. He thought that until she came over angrily yelling about Gladys Hartford\u2019s name in a cheap tabloid newspaper.\u201cCongratulations on your engagement, Miss Perez.\u201dBiern nodded happily and smiled. The whisper that flowed out along with the white smoke was soft and gentle.\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201dThe woman, who blinked slowly, asked back with a shocked tone.\u201cCold-blooded, selfish to the bone and wretched! How could you do this to me?\u201d\u201cWell. You were the one who said goodbye.\u201dThe tip of his long finger gently stroked the rim of the teacup.\u201cI\u2019ve accepted it.\u201dIsn\u2019t that what you wanted?As if asking a question, Biern tilted his head. His hair, which had been swept away randomly following the movement, flowed down. She only bit her lips, the woman did not respond at all.Biern stood up from the table, leaving the woman with a red face. Smoke from the cigar thrown into the ashtray was blown away by the wind through the window.\u201cWait!\u201dThe woman screamed at him. Biern, who stopped walking, responded by throwing his gaze over his shoulder.\u201cIs that all you have to say\u2014 that\u2019s all you have to say to me!?\u201dThe lady of the Perez family now had a face close to crying. Even so, the face was still beautiful, but he felt no particular emotion.Biern slowly turned towards his former lover, who was not bad. And he bowed his head politely. It was a dignified greeting that did not go well with his loosely dressed gown.\u201cI wish you good tidings and at least a Count.\u201dHis lips, which had a smile that seemed even mild at first glance, gleamed red in the sunlight.Leaving behind the half-passed out woman, Biern left the parlour. Mrs. Fitz, who stood guard outside the door, followed him like a shadow.\u201cI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t be trying to put me to sleep by singing a lullaby.\u201dThe tip of Biern\u2019s lips curled softly as he saw Mrs. Fitz following her to the front of the bedroom door.\u201cI can do whatever the prince wants, but unfortunately there seems to be trouble now.\u201dMrs. Fitz, as always, replied to his jokes in a strict manner. As the Crown Prince\u2019s nanny, she was now in charge of managing the housekeeping of this Schwerin Palace. Even when she became an old lady with white hair, her upright personality did not change at all.\u201cYou have to leave for the train station soon.\u201d\u201cTrain station?\u201d\u201cThere is not much time left for the arrival of Her Majesty the Queen.\u201d\u201cAh. It was today.\u201dIt was then that Biern remembered the schedule. It was the day that his mother, who was invited to a charity party at the Royal Hospital, visited Schwerin. The Queen\u2019s escort was, of course, him.\u201cYes.\u201dBiern accepted the task with a light nod.\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d* * *Passing through several cities, the train began to fill with more and more passengers. The compartment, where Erna was the only one, was already full.Erna, sitting close to the window, carefully observed the scenery flowing through the snow mixed with curiosity and anxiety. Countless passers-by and carriages were passing along the cobweb-like road between the dense buildings. Everything was so complicated and flashy. It felt like her eyes were spinning round and round.However, if I know the address, I can easily find it.Suppressing her nervousness, Erna struggled to persuade herself. Anyway, since it was the city where she was born and raised, there was nothing to fear too much. Although it\u2019s a place where she didn\u2019t live for less than five years, her hometown is still her hometown.While Erna was making up her mind once again, the train that arrived at Schwerin Central Station, the final destination, stopped.Erna hurriedly packed her bags and left the cabin in the midst of the other passengers. The ribbon of the hat pulled taut under the chin and the neatly braided hair swayed along the stride. But that proud look didn\u2019t last long.After going out into the hallway, Erna couldn\u2019t remember very well.She was pushed here and there, and got off the train, and when she came to her senses and found herself standing on the platform. The crowd and the noise that made both ears tingle overwhelmed Erna for a moment. She tried to get out of this place somehow, but the more she did, the more Erna was pushed further and further away from the exit.\u201cCome here! It\u2019s coming!\u201dWhen someone shouted loudly, the eyes of the people who filled the platform were all focused in one direction. Erna, who was holding the trunk she had almost dropped, also turned her head towards it.It was almost at the same time\u00a0 she suddenly realized\u00a0 that she was at the forefront of a crowd of onlookers and found a tall man walking from the other side.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lily of the ValleyEven in front of the crowd like a swarm of clouds, Biern showed no signs of nervousness. From the moment he was born, he had been living in the interest of the whole kingdom, and it was familiar as if breathing. The slight discomfort that accompanied it was no different.\u201cStand back! Everyone back off!\u201dThe roaring cries of the servants resounded through the crowded platform. Even in the chaos of disorder, the spectators slowly retreated, paving the way for the prince\u2019s procession.Biern kept his back and neck upright and took a refreshing step in strides. They even exchanged light eye-to-eye greetings with those who touched them as if they were passing by. It was a kind of habit that had been repeated over the years and got into the body.She, too, was nothing more than a crowd with such meaningless glimpses.It was thanks to the amazing behavior of the little girl that the time his eyes stayed a little longer. The woman in a rustic old-fashioned dress wrapped in lace and ribbon looked like she would believe she had lived through the last century alone. As if a dress full of floral patterns was not enough, the hat was also dangling in harmony.Passing by the woman, Biern turned his gaze once more, this time towards the man with the red-hot face. The man, who had been blaming the royal prodigal son with a strong point, staggered backwards, but Biern gave him a fair smile as well. Even in the midst of the chaos of criticism and admiration, he looked as if he had just gone out for an afternoon stroll.Capturing and throwing away meaningless faces, Biern proceeded leisurely toward the train that had just entered the platform.* * *Knowing the address didn\u2019t help much. Unfortunately, Erna only found out after getting lost and exhausted from wandering. The clear darkness was slowly falling over the city as the sun had set.Erna staggered towards the fountain in the center of the square on Tara Boulevard. It felt like she could lie down like this, but she didn\u2019t forget to open the handkerchief before sitting down on the railing.For today, Erna wore the clothes she loved the most. It was a muslin dress that her grandmother gave her as a birthday present last year. Now, she didn\u2019t want to show my father well, but she need to have proper manners and dignity like a lady. It was impossible to get those clothes dirty.Calmly and gracefully. Like a lady anytime, anywhere.It was a life motto that her grandmother had kept for the rest of her life, and it was also a legacy she wanted to pass down to her granddaughter. Although she inherited the surname of Hardi, Erna Hardi, the unmistakable lady of the Baden family, had an obligation to uphold its value.While Erna was meticulously adjusting her outfit, the gas lamp in the square lit up. After finishing his work, the streetlight keeper got on his bike again and left for the next area.After awhile, Erna got up again and packed her luggage after being immersed in the strange sight she had seen for the first time in her life. The pain in her swollen feet and legs disappeared spontaneously when she thought that she had to find a house before the night got deeper.With the sound of footsteps, Erna walked along the street dyed with the light of gas lamps. It was beautiful enough to make her forget the fearful and dreary feelings for a while at night, where petals falling in the wind fluttered like snow.\u201cWow\u2026\u2026\u201dErna raised her head as she exclaimed\u00a0 like an innocent child. A white full moon could be seen through the branches full of flowers. Last night, it was like the moon floating in the night sky, she looked through the window after tossing and turning because she could hardly sleep. The relief given by that natural fact was unexpectedly quite large.After holding her breath, Erna started walking down the road with a little more courage. And soon, shefound the house in the address she had been repeating like an earnest prayer. An old-fashioned mansion at the western end of Tara Boulevard, the very Hardi Garal that once used to be her home.Before ringing the doorbell, Erna adjusted her dress once more. She kept het posture straight and kept her smile as soft and sociable as possible. She didn\u2019t know how she would look, but it was, at least, good by Erna\u2019s standards.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dDeceiving herself with a lie that she thought was already a lie, Erna reached out her trembling hand towards the doorbell.* * *\u201cI really don\u2019t understand you.\u201dThe chirping woman\u2019s voice pierced through the melodies of the upbeat chamber music.At that moment, Biern opened his eyes that had been slowly closed. As he lifted his head obliquely, Louise, who had come all the way to her nose, came into view. Unlike Louise, who was excited, Biern\u2019s eyes looking at her sister were dry.\u201cYou say Gladys is coming back. Don\u2019t you know what this means?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dBiern\u2019s gaze, who was slowly wandering through the hall filled with the dazzling chandelier lights, stopped again on Louise\u2019s face.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a pretty unlucky summer, or something like that.\u201dThe blunt answer, which was thrown away with a bright smile, sounded even more poignant due to his sluggish tone of drowsiness.\u201cOh my gosh. How could\u00a0 brother speak of Gladys like that? Gladys, whom my brother hurt and threw away!\u201dLouise was furious, as if it were herself who was insulted. Even with such a sister by his side, Biern calmly grabbed the glass of water. The water droplets that had condensed on the surface of the glass flowed down the long, smooth fingers.The charity party was a success.When it became known that the queen, who was respected and loved by the whole kingdom, was attending, ladies from the social circles rushed to Schwerin. The corner of the mouth of the head of the Royal Hospital, moved by the amount of mercy they had demonstrated with their donations, showed no sign of going down.Great food and music, and social celebrities who have graced the guest list. It was a party with dignity enough that the Queen\u2019s attendance would not be in vain. The sacrifice of the Grand Duke, who gave up his sleep to escort the Queen, was also not in vain. It\u2019s not a bad spring weekend. Except for Princess Louise, who whizzes around like an angry bee.\u201cBrother, please, correct the mistake now. Yes?\u201dLouise now began to speak in a tone that seemed to appease even a child. Louise, who was also Gladys\u2019s friend, supported Biern\u2019s marriage more fervently than anyone else. After a tumultuous divorce, she turned into a more ferocious critic than anyone else.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s not the kind of fault that can be forgiven, but if Gladys forgives, I\u2019m sure the two of\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cThe Duchess of Heine.\u201dBiern put down the glass of water and cut off his sister\u2019s words. Unlike his smiling lips, his eyes and tone were calm enough to give a sense of ingenuity.\u201cIt seems that the duke is looking for his wife, but how about returning to your husband\u2019s side?\u201dBiern blinked and pointed to the Duke of Heine, who was sneaking through the crowds of ladies beyond the hall. Louise licked her lips a few times, but with a deep sigh, replaced the unspeakable words.When Louise reluctantly left, Biern got up. After a brief break, the band now began to play the waltz.Biern leisurely passed among the ladies who threw their eyes at the coexistence of vigilance and anticipation. The terrace leading to the garden was crowded with men coming out to smoke cigars.\u201cBiern! here!\u201dSeeing a familiar face beckoning, Biern turned towards it. The crowd that normally should have been engrossed in a nonsensical discussion was quiet today. Some of the dogs were sipping their drinks with somber faces that looked like they were about to burst into tears at any moment.\u201cThe investment failed.\u201dsaid Peter, who held out a glass filled with amber brandy. Biern leaned at an angle to the railing and took a glass of wine.\u201cInvestment?\u201d\u201cI invested in foreign bonds, but it was a scam or something.\u201dPeter clicked his tongue and delivered the tragic news. Only lightly frowned, Biern showed no reaction. It seemed that the number of idiots caught up in the fanciful investment craze that had stirred up other social clubs for a while was greater than expected.\u201cThank you, my lord. Thanks to you, I am alive.\u201dPeter, who moved closer to Biern, lowered his voice and whispered.After receiving the investment information that appeals to his ears, he went straight to Schwerin Palace. Because the orthodoxy of the social circles that Prince Biern must have had a gift from God, at least in two fields: women and money.That day, after hearing the explanation from Peter, who was excited, Biern summarized the situation with a concise answer.Sick bastard.How insulting was that mundane word with a low and low voice. Peter Bergen almost committed a serious crime of assaulting the royal family. If it had been an opponent that could have been defeated, it would have certainly been.But how about\u2026For a moment, he had to protect his property in exchange for becoming an asshole, so there was nothing that he couldn\u2019t bear. Besides, didn\u2019t he see a pretty big profit by investing in a steel company with the information he got from beating Biern? Just thinking about it made Peter feel like he could fall in love with that unlucky prince.How much did Biern earn as he earned that level of income, who only barely tasted it after entering the water? Anyway, one of the talents of rolling money was certain to be something close to a gimmick. It was one of the important reasons for continuing this friendship by enduring it even if it was dirty and disrespectful.\u201cYou must catch it by all means, Biern! It\u2019s a serious crime with no one or two victims. isn\u2019t it?\u201dThe heir of a countess, who made eye contact with Biern, began to weep and recite the names of the scammers. Most of them were children of noble families who were members of the fraternity, but there were also some rather strange names mixed in.\u201cViscount Hardi lost almost all of his fortune. He\u2019s on the verge of committing suicide with a pistol right now?\u201dHardy. The tedious grumbling ended with an unfamiliar name, perhaps the most serious idiot.After smoking a cigar, Biern turned towards the garden over the railing. Through the hazy smoke, the colorful spring flowers with the water rising to the fullest were seen.Biern\u2019s gaze, who was slowly admiring the scenery, suddenly stopped on the flower bed full of small white flowers.Lily of the valley.Biern\u2019s eyes narrowed as he remembered the name of the flower. The bouquet Gladys wore at the wedding. Thanks to this, the lily of the valley, which was nicknamed the flower of the Crown Princess, was loved enough to cause a shortage for a while. Of course, its popularity faded in less than a year.Come to think of it, it was the flower that adorned the hat of the austere woman he saw at the station. That lily of the valley that has long since passed the fashion.Biern hummed the waltz from the hall and let out the long cigarette smoke once more.No wonder.Leaving the lily of the valley flower bed without any regrets, his gaze was now on the white moon hanging over the night sky.Even if he glanced at it, there was no luck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In one way or other, bankruptcy is imminent, and there is nothing you can\u2019t afford to share with your ex-wife\u2019s daughter. After all, your daughter is a child!\u201dBrenda Hardy screamed fiercely at her husband, who kept his mouth shut. Last night, she was so stunned that her mind, which had only been dazed, was starting to fill with belated anger. . Walter Hardi was silent, only tilting his glass.\u201cAre you listening to me now? Husband! Hey, Viscount Hardy!\u201dBrenda Hardy exclaimed nervously and grabbed the bottle. Since he was scammed, he has been drinking all day and night, but today it\u2019s especially annoying and scratched her nerves.\u2018A\u2026.person who said herself as the daughter of Hardi family has come to visit\u2019Last night, just when the maid, who had come to her in a hurry, informed her, the viscountess thought that some crazy person had appeared. Erna Hardy. If the maid hadn\u2019t added the visitor\u2019s name, she might have given her orders to throw her away with a rag\u00a0 or something.Annette\u2019s daughter appeared. Why all of a sudden?Brenda Hardy was met with a jaw-dropping spectacle as she rushed to the place in disbelief. Erna looked exactly like her mother. It was as if Annette Baden, who had died, had come back alive. Of course, the ridiculous outfit was also surprising.\u201cHoney! What are you going to do with that kid? Huh?\u201d\u201cI have to send her back.\u201dWalter Hardy, who had been acting like he was paralyzed across the river, finally opened his mouth.\u201cYou just have to convince her to listen and send her back. That\u2019s all, Brenda.\u201d\u201cIt is very easy to say. Yes. I can speak well. She came\u00a0 all the way here and made such an absurd request. Not a chance.\u201dBrenda Hardy snorted outright sarcasm.Erna wanted them to protect the country house of the Baden family. The girl\u2019s request was truly absurd and shameless. On top of that with a very nervous face. Annette Baden spoke very well . Brenda Hardy had to use all her patience in order not to throw the girl out immediately.(P/R: Erna looked like her mother so much that Viscountess addressed Erna as Annette)\u201cMaster, ma\u2019am. Breakfast is ready. Erna, please come down too.\u201dThe maid\u2019s message, accompanied by a careful knocking sound, stopped Brenda Hardi, who was about to shout again.\u201cSpeak properly so I can understand and send her back. It must be so. okay?\u201dLeaving behind his new wife, Walter Hardy stood up.They fed her and put her to sleep last night, in order to keep\u00a0 the minimum morality. So Walter Hardy was determined to drive her out immediately. Anyways, he had no intention of adding a daughter, who was acting like a debtor in a troubled situation. Obviously this was his intention. Until he met Erna, who was quietly waiting in the breakfast room.When his eyes met, Erna hurriedly stood up from her seat. The morning sun coming in through the large window facing the garden was pouring down on her. Maybe it was because he was very drunk last night? It felt like he was seeing her for the first time.\u201cHello, Father.\u201dErna, who blinked her big eyes while holding her breath, came to say hello. It was a very clear and soft voice.\u201cI\u2026\u2026 father?\u201dWith her head tilted slightly, Erna clasped her hands, which were trembling nervously. Even the appearance of a small and slender body and dense facial features. She was a child who perfectly resemble her mother. It seemed that the only traces he left were brown hair at best.Walter Hardy, who swallowed dry saliva, looked at his daughter with a more tenacious gaze. Even in an absurd outfit, she\u2019s such a pretty child. If she\u2019s properly decorated, she would be quite a beauty. To be honest, she might not be far behind from Princess Gladys, in terms of beauty, whom the whole country revered with fuss.When the thought reached that point, Walter Hardy let out a brief exclamation without realizing it. It felt as if a large fortune that had been completely forgotten had rolled in.\u201cLet\u2019s have our meal first.\u201dHe said something completely different from his promise and looked at his wife standing next to him with a very serious look.What are we going to do now?Brenda Hardy, who opened her axe\u2019s like eyes, licked her lips and scolded him, but he didn\u2019t budge.\u201cLet\u2019s talk a little bit more, honey. I think it will be a very important story.\u201d* * *The Grand Duke\u2019s carriage returned only after the bright morning. At least in this Schwerin Palace, it was a scene of everyday life, nothing special.\u201cGood morning, Mrs. Fitz.\u201dTo Mrs. Fitz, who had a strict expression on her face, Biern gave a carefree greeting as usual. The faint smell of alcohol wafting through the fresh morning air deepened the wrinkles on Mrs. Fitz\u2019s forehead.\u201cYou are coming home very\u00a0early, Prince.\u201dDespite her thorny answer, Biern only smiled softly.Biern, who showed his head bowed to the people in line, began to walk across the hall in stride. It was difficult to find traces of last night, which must have been not very healthy, anywhere in that straight and elegant posture. Mrs. Fitz sighed silently and followed after Biern.\u201cThe invitation came from the royal palace.\u201dMrs. Fitz, who was reporting on the relentless flow of invitations to social gatherings, added in an empowering voice. Biern, who had just reached the bedroom door, glanced over his shoulder and looked at her.\u201cAt the palace? Why?\u201d\u201cThis year\u2019s Founding International ball contained the King\u2019s orders to attend and fulfill the duties of Grand Duke Schwerin no matter what. He said that if the prince did not attend, he would hold all the employees of the Grand Duke\u2019s residence\u00a0 responsible.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t this sound more like a threat than an invitation?\u201dBiern opened the door with a dry smile. His red eyes and his slow gait showed a feeling of fatigue that did not match the lively morning atmosphere.Every May, the founding ceremony of Lechen is held. The royal ball, which marked the beginning of the year, was a grand event that drew the attention of all social circles. There were not a few stupid nobles who were preparing for a full year for that day.After the abdication of the throne, Biern was no longer present. It seemed that the will of the elders of the royal family had changed when they saw that the absence of participation, which had been tolerated, was brought into question again. The reason is probably Gladys. It must be the name that gets a lot of attention these days.Biern slowly took off his jacket and untied his tie while the maids who followed, put up the thick curtains to block the sun light. Mrs. Fitz, standing silently with a serene face still haf left to say, but reluctantly turned back as he began to unbutton his shirt.\u2018Do you have any ladies you like?\u2019Towards the end of the Royal Hospital\u2019s charity party, her mother asked him.\u2018I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll think that one divorce is not enough.\u2019Biern responded with a moderately light and witty joke. His mother\u2019s eyes, looking at him slowly, deepened with an unconcealable concern. The reason the invitation suddenly flew in was probably this.Biern took off his shirt haphazardly and threw himself on the bed as if collapsing. The maids, who closed the last curtain, retreated with minimal footsteps.Biern, who was silently staring at the ceiling, quickly closed his eyes. The sound of regular breathing began to seep into the dark and quiet bedroom.* * *The atmosphere in the house was strange.Based on the last three days of staying at the Hardi family, Erna\u2019s conclusion was this. It felt like an unfamiliar and gloomy atmosphere was weighing down the entire house. It would have been better to return to Buford if he gave her a word of refusal sooner rather than later, but Viscount Hardi rarely gave a definite answer.Don\u2019t think about it any more.The answer to the question she asked after squeezing out all her courage came after four days.If that was the only answer today, Erna was going to give up cleanly. It\u2019s impossible for her to sit down like an uninvited guest for so long. It was difficult to bear because she was worried about her grandmother who would be worried because of her granddaughter, who left just one letter and left as if she was running away at night.Would I feel better if I went for a walk?Erna thought deeply, and soon changed her mind. When she thought of yesterday afternoon when she went out for a walk because she couldn\u2019t stand the frustration, her hands were still trembling. A man she met in the plaza kept talking to her and chased after her, so Erna had to run away frantically.\u201cMiss! Miss Erna!\u201dTuk, tuk, tuk.\u00a0A lively voice was heard along with the sound of\u00a0 light knocking on the door. Erna, who was looking out the window, sighed and closed the curtain. As she was tidying up her clothes, another knock rang out.\u201cYes! Come on in.\u201dErna, who was hesitating, hurriedly sat down in front of the table by the window. Moments later, the door opened and a maid with a tray of afternoon tea came in.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYou do it again, miss! It\u2019s easy for you to talk.\u201d\u201cWhat? Ah\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dA shy smile appeared on Erna\u2019s face, who was quietly looking at the maid.The young maid, who introduced herself as Lisa, was in charge of carrying out Erna\u2019s care. She was a friendly girl with an impressive smile on her face. Erna was thankful for taking good care of her in many ways, but it was a little strange for Erna to deal with people her age that she hadn\u2019t met in a long time. It was the first time after Pavel had left his hometown to attend college.Come to think of it, she heard that the city where the Royal Academy of Arts is located is Schwerin.Belated regret came along with the sudden memory. She wished she had brought Pavel\u2019s address. She didn\u2019t have time to think about it because she was leaving as if she was on a night escape.The town of Baden was located in the most remote part of the country village. It was like a secluded island, where one had to walk an hour to the nearest neighboring village. The Bardens of Baden, who had turned their backs on the world, lived there, and Erna, who had grown up with them, did the same. It would not be an exaggeration to say that plants and livestock were more familiar to her life than humans. Without Pavel, it certainly would have been.\u201cExcuse me, Lisa.\u201dWhen Erna carefully called out her name, the maid\u2019s eyes lit up while she kept the tea.\u201cYes, miss! Please speak!\u201d\u201cIs the Royal Academy of Arts near here?\u201d\u201cIt is about five stops away by stagecoach. Will you be going there?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s not like that. I was just curious.\u201dErna quickly shook her head. It seemed rude to suddenly visit Pavel. She was in a situation where she had to stay quietly and leave instead of doing whatever she wants to do.\u201cBy the way, Lisa, is there something going on with the Hardi? I think the atmosphere is a bit cluttered.\u201dErna, who sat with her posture fixed, carefully asked what she had been curious about.\u201cWhat? Well\u2026\u2026 I it\u2019s fine?\u201dThe maid quickly changed her expression and avoided her gaze.\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, miss. Really. I haven\u2019t been to this mansion for a while. therefore\u2026\u2026 Huh\u2026\u2026 So, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cOf course. Nothing serious.\u201dThe maid hurriedly brought a cup of tea to Erna. She didn\u2019t seem to notice that the tea had splashed on the saucer.Erna quickly wiped away the saucer while the maid looked away for a moment. She didn\u2019t forget to hide the tea-stained handkerchief out of sight. It was then that an unfamiliar maid\u2019s voice was heard along with the knock.\u201cLady, the master is looking for you.\u201dIt was the message that Erna had been waiting anxiously for.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Beginning of Rumors\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you, so you stop and go out and look!\u201dThe voice of the Baroness of Baden, full of anger, shook the tranquility of the country house. The frightened roar of chickens and geese roaming the backyard was faintly heard through the open window.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grandma. I was wrong. Huh?\u201dErna, who blinked and said to Mrs. Greve, while taking a few more cautious steps towards her grandmother.\u00a0 Baroness Baden, who sat on a chair by the window, was stubbornly ignoring Erna. Ever since she heard about the events in Schwerin, it has been like this.\u201cIf you really think so, call Walter Hardy immediately. I will never make such a nonsensical deal .\u201dBaroness Baden faced Erna after a long time.\u201cI can\u2019t, Grandma. The Hardy\u2019s lawyer will meet Thomas Baden today to close the deal. First of all, my father owns it, but he promised me he would sooner or later inherit it. Then we can live in this house forever and without any worries.\u201d\u201cDaughter, what does it mean to sell you and own this house?\u201d\u201cSelling! Why are you saying that? no. Absolutely not, Grandma.\u201dErna frowned.\u201cIt\u2019s good for everyone. I will protect this house, and I will be able to live with my father even now.\u201d\u201cAre you serious, Erna? Do you really want it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dErna smiled hastily.\u201cOf course. Seriously.\u201dLooking at the old woman\u2019s eyes full of sadness, it doesn\u2019t seem like a very successful lie.Father granted her request.He said he would buy the country house inherited from Thomas Baden and hand it over to Erna. Erna was so startled that she almost lost her senses. It was her last hope, so she recklessly hung on it, but she never thought that it would come true so easily. Of course, she has to pay the price, so it can\u2019t be a fortune that she got for free.As a condition of granting her daughter\u2019s request, Viscount Hardi made an unexpected offer. Let\u2019s live in the same house now as a proper family. Even so, he said that leaving his daughter in a distant place until she became a young lady who was\u00a0 at marriageable age was the thing that bothered her.\u2018One year. Give this father only that much time.\u2019When Erna hesitated, her father added hastily.\u2018Let\u2019s stay in Schwerin for about a year, go out in social circles, and take time to expand the network we need in the future. It seems to me that it is the father\u2019s duty to provide you with at least that level of foundation.\u2019When she blinked, the Viscount came to help. His explanation that he would help\u00a0 a young girl to live like a noble family was fervent, but to Erna, they were nothing more than meaningless illusions.Erna liked the quiet life in this place where today, like yesterday, and tomorrow, not different from today and continuing like that . If these days of life were completed as beautifully as a patchwork quilt made by her grandmother, there was nothing more to wish for.Still, she agreed because it was the best thing to do. Erna wanted to protect this house at all costs. Even if it was a foolish insistence, it was fine. It wasn\u2019t too bad a deal to get this house in exchange for staying with her father for about a year.\u201cStop going out. g.\u201dBaroness Baden stopped looking at her granddaughter.\u201cGrandma\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cPlease, Erna. I think I need some time to be alone.\u201dHer eyes staring out the window were even redder.Erna could not speak any longer and left her grandmother\u2019s bedroom. There was a very long shadow that followed the powerless, bruised footsteps.* * *The conversations of the drinking party returned to horse racing.The children of prestigious families, who are members of the social club, met each other, so whenever they talked, they were half crazy and spoke enthusiastically. When the story of the winner of the last horse race came out, a mixture of envy and jealousy focused on Biern. The stallion owned by the Grand Duke was winning the kingdom\u2019s various horse races. In fact, the horse doesn\u2019t even show up well on the racetrack.\u201cBiern, if you are not interested in horse racing, how about selling it? Even if you pay a huge price, there will be people waiting in line. First of all, I will line up for you.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll give you one and a half times what that bastard is asking for.\u201d\u201cI double.\u201dEveryone was excited and waited for Biern\u2019s answer.\u201cI have no interest in horse racing.\u201dBiern put down the emptied glass of wine at once and responded calmly. Everyone\u2019s eyes were now gleaming with anticipation they couldn\u2019t hide.\u201cI\u2019m not going to sell it though.\u201d\u201cYou are not interested, so why?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s mine.\u201dAt Biern\u2019s blunt reply, sighs erupted from everywhere. All sorts of conciliation and persuasion followed, but Biern, as always, just listened indifferently.\u201cYou\u2019re a prince who doesn\u2019t even listen to what other people say.\u201dPeter shook his head and smirked.\u201cWhat\u2019s the logic of not selling it because it\u2019s yours even if it\u2019s not interesting? Anyway, you are a pervert.\u201dWhile grumbling with a grimace, Peter was quite friendly and filled the empty glass.The men\u2019s topic, that had been heating up with horse racing for a while, moved to women\u2019s stories as if it were a natural procedure. Biern glanced at the grandfather clock placed in the diagonal direction, and sat cross-legged with his chin on the table.\u201cAh! The new maid in the Hardi family is really cool, isn\u2019t it?\u201dWhen the names of socialite ladies who were famous for their beautiful looks were gone, someone suddenly threw in new firewood.(P/R: it means to say a new thing.)\u201cAre you going Hardy? The family couldn\u2019t afford to hire a new maid now. The maids who were there must have left the house.\u201d\u201cThen, is it the maid he has been with for a long time? Anyway,\u00a0 she is a maid for sure. I saw her go into that house.\u201d\u201cWhat. Have you followed her already?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by following? We met by chance on Tara Avenue, and I thought I should say hello because she is so beautiful but she got scared and ran away, so I couldn\u2019t ask her name. She looked like a country girl at first glance, but she was very timid.\u201d\u201cTo scare a beautiful woman. Your face is ugly. Look, if it was our prince. Even a cowardly country girl would have greeted sweetly like honey.\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dSilent stories of giggles and exchanges spread along with the scent of alcohol.Hardy.Hearing the name he hears often these days, Biern stood up from his seat. The brandy in the glass he held in one hand shook with the rhythm of his steps.\u201cEveryone arrived quickly.\u201dEntering the library on the second floor of the club, Biern greeted them with a smile. The directors of the bank, who were sitting around the reception sofa, raised their eyes in unison and looked at him.\u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re early, it\u2019s that you\u2019re late.\u201d\u201cWell. well.\u201dBiern leaned back on the top seat and pointed to the clock.\u201cI\u2019m on time now. right?\u201dAs soon as the words were finished, the clock hand pointed to exactly 4 o\u2019clock. Biern\u2019s smiling face was as fresh as the prodigal, unlike who had been drinking alcohol since broad daylight.Biern, who put the empty glass down on the edge of the table, was handed the thick paperwork presented by the lawyer. It was a detailed report on foreign and municipal bonds that had newly flowed into Lechen\u2019s financial market.Biern began to carefully read the documents. After drinking quite a bit, it was difficult to find drunkenness anywhere in those calm eyes.The men sitting around the study silently waited for his review to be finished. The reason they, who are famous as financiers and lawyers, gather at a fraternity in broad daylight and claim to be the limb of the prodigal son is because that prodigal son is Biern Denyister.It was purely because of his connections and capital that they suddenly decided to join the prince who was about to set up a bank. He was a person who couldn\u2019t work diligently anyway, so he thought that it would be enough to stand him as a scarecrow holding a money chain. How could such a Biern become the goose that lays golden eggs? It was something that no one dared to expect.So, what does all that reputation mean?The profit they were gaining thanks to the poisonous mushroom prince, who was certain to be born, was a fruit, sweet enough to make them forget everything else.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get started.\u201dBiern, who quickly reviewed the documents, raised an eyebrow and smiled. It was a smile that foreshadowed another success.* * *\u201cMister, did I do\u00a0 something wrong?\u201dHanding over the iron nail she was holding, Erna asked very seriously. Ralph Royce, who glanced at her, started hammering without answering. The dust that had been piled up on the fence flew away following the thumping noise.Even while sneezing over and over again, Erna did not leave Ralph\u2019s side. By the time the half-destroyed fence regained its original shape, her nose was burning red.\u201cIt is a matter of letting the miss go, so the Madame must be very upset.\u201d.\u201dRalph Royce, who wiped his face with the towel Erna gave him, gave a belated answer.\u201cEven though Madame was well aware that it would not be possible to leave a young lady in this country forever as it is now\u2026 Still, this is very sudden.\u201dContrary to his blunt tone of voice, there was a warmth and sadness that could not be hidden in his eyes as he looked at Erna.Baroness Baden eventually accepted her granddaughter\u2019s wishes. Now, tomorrow, Erna was due to leave for Schwerin, where her father\u2019s house was. Having sent servants all the way to Buford to take his daughter, Viscount Hardi seemed to have made up his mind.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mister.\u201dErna, who was looking at him quietly, whispered.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry that I made this decision on my own, and that made everyone sad.\u201d\u201cLady Erna\u2026..\u201d\u201cBut I won\u2019t regret it because I save this house.\u201dErna\u2019s smile was so bright that even the shade of her broad straw hat could not cover it.Ralph, who rubbed his red eyes, nodded his head in response. If he had opened his lips, he might burst out in tears. Erna stayed by his side for a long time, as if to say that she knew his feelings. The late afternoon sunlight dazzled the two of them leaning side by side against the renewed fence.\u201cPlease take care of Grandma until I get back, Mister.\u201dErna, who was openly kicking the dirt floor, cautiously offered her a request. Ralph Royce nodded once more, and his face was even more red than before.As the coachman of the Baden family, he was doing all kinds of chores after the wagons were no longer left in the house. Even after the pressure had weakened to the point where it was difficult to pay the wages properly, the only two people left here were him and Mrs. Greve, the housekeeper.It must have been because of the affection and loyalty they had been together for many years, but Erna was well aware that it was also because they were too old to find another job.So she wanted to protect this house even more.So that they, who are like family, can stay here for a long, long time in a comfortable way. For that, she could endure it for about a year. In the spring of next year, she will be able to see this beautiful and peaceful scenery again from this house.* * *Erna left Baden Street the next morning. It wasn\u2019t until a few days later that rumors about the daughter of the Hardi who suddenly appeared one day circulated in social circles.It is said that the daughter of Viscount Hardi, who had been receiving medical care in the countryside due to weakness, has returned. She was going to make a belated social debut this season, but it was rumoured that she was as beautiful as Princess Gladys. Which is something totally unexpected.Well, looking at it, the source was a bit dubious, but it was a good rumor to pique the interest of luxury sagas.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you eat, you will die.\u201cShe is the prettiest girl you\u2019ll ever work with. If you see her, you will definitely agree with me.\u201dBrenda Hardy glanced at the table clock, trembling nervously. Always during important times like this one, she will go out for a walk. She was a kid ,that the Viscountess didn\u2019t like in many ways.After\u201cThat has to be the case, Viscount.\u201dCountess Meyer\u2019s gaze, who was looking down at the landscape of the garden through the window, turned to Brenda Hardy.\u201cOtherwise, you are wasting my time, and I hate wasting my time on pointless things.\u201dContrary to her soft voice, her eyes were cold. Suppressing her upset stomach, Brenda Hardy smiled as she struggled. It\u2019s a pity that this situation has to be endured by being patient. .Countess Meyer was a standing figure who was known as a legend in the Lechen socialite marriage market. Born as the daughter of a humble half-baron , she rose to the rank of countess, and succeeded in marrying\u00a0 into a family that was so great with even making her daughters marry into a great family. The eldest daughter became the countess, and the second daughter became the wife of the wealthy merchant. She even succeeded in finding a good husband for the girls in her chaperone, and when the rumor spread, women from all walks of life started lining up.It was almost a miracle that such Victoria Meyer was now sitting in the living room of the Hardy family. Originally, she announced that she would not be taking the chaperone this season. So that she could\u00a0 spend the summer with her second daughter abroad. However, plans went awry when the second daughter went on a long trip with her husband. Brenda Hardy had to mobilize all her contacts before another family could take her away.He wants to sell his daughterEven when she first heard it, Brenda Hardy thought her husband had finally gone insane. But he was pretty serious, and even that ambition had a pretty plausible corner. For a family driven to the edge of a cliff to offer their daughters for sale at the wedding market, there was nothing special in the social world.In fact, all marriages in the social world are all transactions in the end.Of course, exposing blatant business practices is somewhat of a low-class thing, but the current Hardy family was not in a position to judge such a thing. Above all, Erna. That girl was sure to be a top-notch sale.In the end, Brenda Hardy accepted her husband\u2019s crazy proposal, pretending not to win. This kind of business is supposed to be a speed game, so they were going to see a match by the end of this summer somehow.\u201cMadam, Miss Erna has arrived.\u201dJust as the\u00a0 wrinkles between Countess Meyer\u2019s forehead were noticeably deepening, a maid brought good news. Brenda Hardy got up from her seat, forgetting her face for a moment.\u201cCome here, Erna! I waited a long time.\u201dAs she entered the drawing room, she handed her a sincere greeting. Countess Meyer, who put down the fan, also turned her head to look at Erna. Even after buying a bunch of new clothes, Erna was still wearing a rustic dress.\u201cCome here and say hello. Countess Meyer.\u201dBrenda Hardy brushed up on Erna with an anxious voice. When she saw a stranger, she looked like a hardened countryman.\u00a0Look how she reacts.\u00a0 Her blood almost dried up for fear that Victoria Meyer would leave her seat at any moment.\u201cHello, Mrs. My name is Erna Hardy.\u201dErna, who approached with a crouch, luckily greeted her with proper manners. Countess Meyer\u2019s eyes were as sharp as a blade, carefully examining Erna from top to bottom and from bottom to top.\u201cHow is she, madam? Do you like our Erna?\u201dBrenda Hardy, who could not stand the silence, broke down first.\u201cI guess you were not lying.\u201dCountess Meyer, who had a strange look, nodded her head. And slowly, with an elegant gesture, she got up and walked towards Erna.\u201cNice to meet you, Ms. Hardy. Let\u2019s try to do it well.\u201dThe Countess reached out her gloved hand in front of Erna and asked for a handshake.\u201cMy name is Victoria Meyer. I will be in charge of Ms. Hardy\u2019s chaperone.\u201d* * *When the noise of the scissors cutting the fabric ceased, the bedroom fell into silence again.Erna, who was almost lying on her desk, diligently moving her hands, let out a long sigh and sat up with her back upright. In the eyes looking at the finished peony, there was a feeling of overwhelming joy and satisfaction.Concentrate on your work when your head is cluttered.It was Erna\u2019s old habit. After helping Mrs. Greve to make and sell artificial flowers, it was natural to grab scissors when caught in thoughts. It was useful in many ways because she could make up my mind and earn a living. It\u2019s a little funny that she brought her work all the way here, but to Erna, these things now felt like a part of her body.After organizing the scraps of cloth and tools, Erna went to the bathroom and washed her hands thoroughly. The small hand, which had been smeared with grass marks, soon returned to its original, smooth, white appearance.Maybe it\u2019s not going to be a very smooth year, Erna thought blankly as she looked at her reflection in the gorgeous brass mirror.It had already been ten days since she moved to the Hardi family\u2019s mansion. Each day seems to go by very slowly, but the ten days of each day just flowed by like a torrent.After arriving in Schwerin, Erna spent most of her time with the Viscount. To be more precise, it might be more accurate to say that she was dragged around. It was because Erna was not given any choice while going to and from the many colorful shops and buying piles of things. It was all about putting on, taking off, and being baled from place to place. It was like playing with a doll.\u201cLady!\u201dThe maid, who saw Erna coming out of the bathroom door, exclaimed with delight.\u201cI was surprised to know where you went!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I caused you concern.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you have to apologize!\u201dEmbarrassed, Lisa waved her hands and clapped.Erna, who smiled a little shyly, slowly approached the table where afternoon tea was served. Lisa, who was hesitating, also approached her.\u2018Next time, bring another teacup.\u2019It was during tea time four days ago that Erna suddenly said something absurd. Lisa, who understood the meaning of those words too late, almost screamed in shock.\u2018Don\u2019t do this to me, miss. If that\u2019s the case, you will get\u00a0 in trouble.\u2019\u2018why? I\u2019ve been having tea time with Mrs. Greve in the Baden family.\u2019No matter how hard she tried to explain, Erna only tilted her head with a blank face like now.\u2018Who is Mrs. Greve?\u2019Lisa lowered her voice and asked nervously,\u2018The housekeeper of the Baden.\u2019Erna, who held her breath at the same time, responded in earnest.The secret tea time with the young lady that started like that had been going on peacefully for several days.She\u2019s definitely a bit of a weird girl. Lisa somewhat agreed with what the Hardi servants were whispering.The young girl of the Hardi family, who suddenly appeared one day, had no aspects of an aristocratic lady. From her appearance to her attitude, it was in every way. However, such accusations of being arrogant or eccentric were pure absurdity. She hides her face a lot and doesn\u2019t talk much, giving\u00a0 the impression of a childish, but looking at her closely, she was a pretty sweet girl.\u201cWow. Did you make that?\u201dLisa\u2019s eyes widened when she discovered the coveted harmony placed on the desk where she unintentionally threw her eyes. Erna blushed a little and nodded her head. The shadow of her long eyelashes, which swayed with each slow blink, was like a butterfly flapping her wings.\u201cSo pretty! You\u2019re really good at it. I would believe it even if it was a real flower.\u201dLisa was truly amazed. When she met Erna\u2019s face, who was happy with the compliment and smiled broadly, Lisa felt a bit dazed.\u2018Sell and sell, now you\u2019re trying to sell your daughter, huh?\u2019When Viscount Hardi suddenly wanted to bring the daughter of his ex-wife, who had left\u00a0 home, into this house, the employers often murmured such accusations.\u2018Obviously they will sell for a pretty high price, so that\u2019s good enough. No matter what they sell, isn\u2019t it good for all of us that this family is still alive?\u2019Some even secretly attacked the owner. With the young lady\u00a0 like this, Lisa seemed to be able to understand the meaning of those bad words.Does this lady know about this?A question that suddenly came to mind disturbed Lisa. It was at that time that Erna, who had come to her side at some point, suddenly brought out harmony.\u201cAre you going to give it to me?\u201dWhen asked in disbelief, Erna nodded her head slightly.\u201cNo, miss! I didn\u2019t mean it that way! I\u2019m just pretty\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you a present. It will be pretty if you put it on your hat. It can also be used as a brooch.\u201dIn Lisa\u2019s perplexed hand, Erna gave the harmony directly.Lisa, unable to refuse the sincerity, decided to accept the gift pretending not to win. At that moment, Erna smiled in relief. She was a pretty girl smiling like a flower she had made.\u201cShall we go for a walk? Schwerin must still be very unfamiliar and awkward, but in return for the gift, I will show you a lot of good places.\u201dLisa jumped up from her seat with a renewed enthusiasm. Erna looked up at her with her round eyes.\u201cMaybe I\u2019m causing trouble?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t! It is my job to take good care of her.\u201dLisa, who smiled brightly, quickly brought Erna\u2019s parasol and hat.\u201cCome on out, miss!\u201d* * *Schwerin was a large city second to the capital.The nobility usually had their mansions in the southern part of the city, where the Schwerin Palace, the royal summer residence, was also located. From densely packed high-end shopping districts and hotels to luxurious theaters. It was a bustling downtown boasting the splendor of a resort town where famous nobles of the kingdom come to enjoy the summer season. A little further north, there is a huge port that connects to the ocean, so Schwerin has been a city where commerce and finance have developed since ancient times.Erna listened to Lisa\u2019s exasperated chatter and took a slow pace. It was something she knew from reading books, but when she looked\u00a0 at this city with her own two eyes,\u00a0 everything felt new.\u201cThat hotel is the best hotel in Schwerin.\u201dLisa paused for a moment and pointed to the hotel located at the intersection of three avenues.\u201cThe restaurant and tea room over there are very popular among the ladies here. See you next time, miss.\u201dBefore Erna could even reply, Lisa quickly added. Erna nodded her head gently, as she liked to see her face full of anticipation. It was then that a tall man caught her eye.The man who came out of the entrance of the hotel walked with a wide stride. The woman standing next to me didn\u2019t care what she said to me, and just hurried my way. Behind these two men followed suitably spaced users. Seeing the attention of passersby all at once, he seemed to be a fairly famous figure.\u201cOh no, miss!\u201dErna, possessed by a strange feeling of dizziness, turned to face the man, and Lisa grabbed her arm.\u201cYes, miss. It\u2019s nice to see. I know that feeling well, but I still can\u2019t. I can\u2019t use it.\u201dLisa frowned, and now her tongue clenched.Tilt her head at the unfamiliar words, Erna shifted her gaze to the blonde man again. The wagon carrying him and the woman soon disappeared over the other side of the highway.\u201cBecause it\u2019s never going to happen.\u201dLisa took a deep breath and stopped in front of Erna.\u201cWho is that person?\u201d\u201cthat\u2026 \u2026 You don\u2019t even need to know that. Don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cDo you have a bad reputation?\u201d\u201cUgh. Tell me what are you doing?\u201dLisa shook her head and grabbed Erna\u2019s hand.\u201cRemember, miss. Not\u00a0 him, that one.\u201d\u201cthen?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 \u2026 . That\u2019s right, a poisonous mushroom!\u201dLisa shouted with her eyes twinkling. Even though he said absurd words, he had a more serious expression.\u201cRemember, miss. If you eat it, you die.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay7. DebutantThe breakthrough started with the dress. It was the dress for Erna Hardy\u2019s debutante, to be worn at the royal palace.Brenda Hardy looked at Erna\u2019s dress with a slightly perplexed look. In terms of being pure white, she faithfully followed the tradition of debutante , but the appearance was not at all docile. How deep was the neckline? It was a scene where she would make her debut by showing half of her shoulders and breasts to the whole social world.\u201cAnyway, she\u2019s an unusual woman.\u201dBrenda Hardy mumbled with a sigh and leaned back deep in the wing chair.It was Countess Meyer who suggested such a dress. Her opinion about how a more modest, that is, an ordinary debutante dress, would be completely ignored. It would be great to see a young girl making her debut when she turned twenty, wearing the same dresses as her younger siblings. She was angry all the way to the tip of her head, but since it was the truth, it was hard to find words to refute.In the spring of around the age of fifteen, the girls of the noble families of Lechen made their social debut at the founding party. Although sometimes they were delayed for about a year due to personal reasons, there has never been a lady who made her debut so late. Although there were excuses made that it was because she was weak and lived in the countryside, no one would believe it.So, if she is going to stand out anyway, it\u2019s better to make an unconventional move.The dress with puff sleeves and a voluminous skirt that draped slightly over the shoulder was definitely beautiful. The chiffon hem that was padded on the skirt was slightly dyed with a light pink color, which made the dress, which might otherwise be simple, look brighter. It was as if the owner of the dressing room had kept her promise to bring a dress that looked like a freshly bloomed flower.No matter how you look at it, it\u2019s not a debutante dress worthy of a humble parent\u2019s daughter, but Viscount Hardi, the father who burned with ambition to revive himself\u00a0 by selling his daughter, was not in a position to pay mind to feeling unfairly criticized for that.Brenda Hardy, who had hardened her heart, rang the bell on the table. The maid, who had left for her errand, soon returned with a young maid who served Erna.\u201cFor Erna, you have a job that you have to take responsibility for. Can you do it?\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am! Just leave it to me.\u201dThe maid with a nervous face answered loudly.\u201cAlright, that\u2019s a great attitude. Nice to see.\u201dWith only a smile on her lips, Brenda Hardy slowly got up and walked towards the maid.\u201cLet me put this dress on Erna. If you don\u2019t bring Erna in this outfit before the departure time, you\u2019ll be fired.\u201d* * *Biern woke up earlier than usual. Yes, it was noon, which was far from the usual wake-up time, but for him it was like an early morning.\u201cIt is good, my prince. Thanks to this, the servants of the Grand Duke\u2019s residence were able to avoid the tragedy of being rebuked by His Majesty the King.\u201dMrs. Fitz made an unusual joke to Biern, who had just come out of the bathroom. There was also a gentle smile on her face, which seldom showed emotion.Biern smiled brightly and walked into the dressing room with a wide stride. The servants, who were preparing the clothes, stopped working for a moment and then turned back and bowed their heads. There was no more smile left on Biern\u2019s face as he responded to the greeting with a light nod.As Biern, who had changed clothes, stood in front of the mirror, the attendants began to move busily. The sunlight shining through the window became brighter as they went out with the complicated and colorful formal attire. Biern looked at the golden dust floating in the light with narrowed eyes.Even if at least one troublesome prince doesn\u2019t show up, tonight\u2019s ball will go on without any problems. Biern was well aware that his father\u2019s threats were just bluffs. The revered King Philip III of Lechen, his benevolent father, could not do such a thing like put a sword to his throat.Nevertheless, he decided to attend. The price of having everything equipped and enjoying a smooth life is a law that must be paid. Maintaining the minimum amount of responsibility that was different from bondage. It was the proper line of life he had been keeping as a Dneister.\u201cIt\u2019s done, Prince.\u201dThe deacon, who adjusted the shape of the last veil, said slowly.Biern caught a glimpse of his own reflection in the mirror and turned around. Just by gently pulling up the corners of his lips, his face changed in an instant.Biern began to take a refreshing step towards the central porch of the Grand Duke\u2019s residence, where the carriage was waiting. The faces of the attendants who followed were lit with the light of admiration and joy that they had recovered after much effort.\u201cIt would have been better to go to the capital a day earlier and stay. I am afraid that you will be late for the ball because the road is blocked,\u201dMrs. Fitz, who had followed all the way to the front of the carriage, said anxiously.\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d\u201cPrince!\u201d\u201cShould I ask for something to happen to block the road?\u201dBiern sat in the carriage. Contrary to his mischievous attitude, his movements were agile and elegant without being superfluous.The carriage carrying the Grand Duke left Schwerin Palace with the attendants seeing off. It was a sunny late spring afternoon, the scenery flowing out of the car window was like a picture.* * *\u201cIt\u2019s all because of you. Because of you!\u201dAs the palace began to appear across the street, Brenda Hardy burst into anger. Viscount Hardy, who barely sighed, glared at his wife as if embarrassed.\u201cWhat? Now, do you want to blame me and say that I am responsible for other people\u2019s wagon accidents?\u201d\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t taken left our townhouse in the capital with bank debt, we wouldn\u2019t have entered the palace in such an unsightly manner on the day of the prom!\u201dViscount Hardy, who was tired of his wife\u2019s voice\u00a0 who was raising her voice without losing, couldn\u2019t resist any more and shut his lips firmly. In the midst of the commotion, Erna only looked out of the\u00a0window with a half-dazed face.Schwerin was a city adjacent to the capital, Berne. It was said that it was not too far to go by wagon, but their arrival had been very delayed more than expected due to the accident. It was obviously a big deal that the ball had already started, but to Erna, even that fact seemed like a distant world.It would have been better if the road had not been opened forever.Erna looked down with eyes that were about to cry. To arrive at the royal palace wearing such a shameful dress. She felt like jumping off the carriage.As soon as Erna saw the dress, she resolutely refused. If it wasn\u2019t for Lisa, who cried and begged her not to go back to the countryside, saying that she would be kicked out as of today if she didn\u2019t wear this dress, she would never have worn such vulgar thing.Erna, who could not go to the ball\u00a0as if she was naked, and could not let the innocent maid out, offered a compromise of her own. It was to cover the shoulders with a lace shawl. Although not very pleased, the Viscount, fortunately, took a step back and gave in to her.\u201cYou have to do well with what you learned, Erna. Do you understand?\u201dAs the carriage passed the grand entrance of the palace, Viscount Hardy insisted on it.Learn? What did you learn?Erna tried to retrieve her memory somehow, but it didn\u2019t work out as she wanted. Meanwhile, the palace was getting closer and closer. Erna\u2019s two hands clutching the lace shawl wrapped around her shoulders were trembling as if they had convulsed.* * *\u201cViscountess! What the hell is this?\u201dCountess Meyer exclaimed nervously when she saw the Hardy family rushing up the stairs. It was after the royal couple had already arrived, and the introduction of the young girls who were debuting this season had ended.\u201cIt turned out like this because of a wagon accident. Are we really late?\u201dVictoria Meyer, viewed the Viscount as asking a pathetic question, hurriedly ran down the stairs.\u201cWhat is this shawl?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, madam. This was the best we could manage.\u201dBrenda Hardy, who was paying attention, quickly made excuses. At best, Erna had her upper body covered with a shawl, hiding the purpose of the beautiful dress.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to get this kid in the wagon without a shawl. You couldn\u2019t imagine how stubborn she was.\u201dMaking lousy excuses.Countess Meyer shook her head nervously, grabbed Erna\u2019s wrist first, and hurriedly started climbing the stairs. She couldn\u2019t handle this little, weak girl. Brenda Hardy\u2019s incompetence made her shake with anger.\u201cCountess, give me a little, a little bit of time\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cHey, Miss Hardy. His Majesty the King is already here, how much more time do you need?\u201dErna sighed and begged, but Countess Meyer did not waver. Anyway, it was impossible to get rid of this kid\u2019s rustiness in that short amount of time. Rather, the odds of winning are higher if the appearance of an innocent country girl is presented as a charm.\u201cPlease tell me.\u201dShe gave orders to the servants guarding the front of the banquet hall. The heavy door engraved with the white wolf crest, which symbolizes the Dneister royal family, slowly opened and dazzling lights and noises poured out.\u201cThe House of Viscount Hardy arrives!\u201dFollowing the servant\u2019s loud voice, the eyes of the nobles who filled the spacious hall were focused on them all at once. At that moment, Victoria Meyer had a gut feeling. That this side would benefit far more from appearing like this than being introduced as one of the many young ladies. This crisis turned into an opportunity.Countess Meyer, who exchanged glances with the Viscount Hardy, who followed them in a hurry, took the shawl from Erna, who froze like a statue. Erna, who realized this too late, struggled to capture it, but it was nothing more than a gesture to no avail.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Ms. Hardy.\u201dCountess Meyer pushed Erna\u2019s back with all her might with a cold command. The beautiful prize she was given this season was tossed aimlessly into the dazzling light.* * *She couldn\u2019t breathe well.That was all Erna could barely think of. Even when she was just standing silently, her heart was pounding like it was going to explode and her breath caught up in her throat.Breath.Erna took a hard breath and raised her head. The incredibly spacious and splendid hall was filled with people as splendid as this hall.Erna, who barely supported her shaking legs and took a step, came to a stop again after a while. It was because she remembered what she looked like.Erna shrugged her shoulders and looked around as if asking for help. But all that caught her eye were unfamiliar faces and dizzying lights. After a while, it faded like a painting which got smeared.What should I do?Erna looked around once more, trembling helplessly like a prey thrown into a den of wild beasts. It was then that the servant\u2019s cry could be heard, announcing the arrival of a new guest, amid the murmur of onlookers.\u201cPrince Biern is entering!\u201dThe ripple caused by that name swept the entire banquet hall in an instant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

BreathThe Viscount Hardy and Countess Meyer, who followed Erna while keeping their distance intentionally, looked back with bewildered faces. They never dreamed that there would be guests who had not arrived yet. Even more so, that it would be Prince Biern.They retreated first. The red carpet road from the entrance of the banquet hall to the opposite end, to the stage where the king and queen sat side by side, now belonged to Prince Biern. No. They just knew that until they found Erna, the troublesome brat they had forgotten for a while.\u201cOh my god! Look at that child!\u201dBrenda Hardy clasped her husband\u2019s arm, with a pale blue face.Erna, who lost herself in a panic attack, frozen, was standing in the middle of the carpet, blocking the prince\u2019s path. In order to bring that child, they had to outrun Prince Biern, and it was hard to tell which choice would bemore horrific. Meanwhile, the distance between the prince and Erna was getting smaller and smaller.\u201cMaybe you planned it like this? Yes?\u201dBrenda Hardy questioned the Countess Meyer if she was the mastermind behind this scandal. Frowning in thought, she soon regained her original calm expression.\u201cLet\u2019s see. There\u2019s no way but up from here.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201dBrenda Hardy let out a trembling sigh. If in front of aristocrats from all over the country was not enough, and she would look like a disgrace at a gathering where the royal family was present, but this woman was acting like it was all simply amusing.Just when she was suspicious that she might have just taken charge of the chaperone with the intention of messing things up, Prince Biern, with a frown on his face, stopped.Erna turned around at the shadow cast over her.* * *What the hell is this?Biern\u2019s head tilted slightly as he looked down at the woman who was doing something absurd. When he first saw that woman, he didn\u2019t think much of it. Of course, she will back down, move away and if he passed by like that, she would be just one of the countless others.He hoped he would be able to persevere and stop himself. But no matter what the intentions were, he had to acknowledge her circumstances and presence.Biern lowered his gaze a little more and faced the woman. Even with her eyes full of him, the woman was just dazed like a person who couldn\u2019t see anything. Each time she blinked slowly, her large eyes grew more and more hazy and transparent. Her eyes were unusually blue with a bright blue tint.Biern, who had raised his eyebrows lightly, stopped looking over the woman. Father and mother, with puzzled expressions on their faces, were the first to come into view.Biern again!It was the eyes that seemed to hear such a sigh. The accusation in Leonite\u2019s frowned upon expression was obviously harsher than that. Not to mention Louise who is in color.They should be at least grateful that the beginning of debutant, which he arrived after many sessions was now at least not boring.Biern raised his head once more, this time with a slightly thicker smile. There was faint irritation in his eyes as he slowly looked at the murals adorning the high ceiling and the huge chandeliers below.No matter how much he thought about it, he had no memory of committing anything to this woman that deserved such an upheaval. The assumption that this strange woman might have mistaken him for Leon was quickly erased from his mind. Paradise will come a little sooner than the day that naughty prince didn\u2019t cause trouble with women.He hoped that the woman he did not know would disappear from before him. Biern lowered his gaze, which had been wandering aimlessly in the air. But a strange woman was still standing in his way. Not knowing what to do, she was just trembling like a young beast driven to a hunting ground.When Biern, who had no desire to participate in this skit anymore, took a step, the woman\u2019s body, who had been gasping as if strangled, staggered.Even as he sighed, Biern nimbly supported the woman. It is not his business to talk about today\u2019s affairs, but the rumor that the Grand Duke even stunned a woman in the royal palace would be absurd.\u201cBreath.\u201dBiern whispered lowly to the woman who was turning blue. Slowly raising her head, the woman looked surprised, as if she had only seen him for the first time. The tears in his red eyes seemed to stand out even more because of the lack of blood on her face.Breath.Like a child learning an unfamiliar word, the woman repeated his words over and over again. Her small lips were also as red as tears. Biern snorted out a laugh, startled.\u201cBreathe, breathe.\u201dBiern lowered his voice a little and whispered slowly. The woman nodded her head and then took a proper breath. She was still shaking, but fortunately she seemed to have escaped the danger of losing consciousness.Breath. The woman mumbled the words he had heard over and over again, steadily taking deep breaths and exhaling repeatedly. The white shoulders that shook with the rhythm were absurdly small and thin.After some breathing had stabilized, the woman hurriedly backed away from him. On her face, which had been blank all along, suddenly, something worthy of being called an emotion came to mind. shame and vigilance. It was not the attitude the person responsible for making a fuss in the way of others would see.\u201cI am so sorry, Prince.\u201dA middle-aged woman who was watching her approached with slow steps and supported the woman.Biern\u2019s gaze, who glanced at her, quickly turned to the little woman again. She was trying to cover her shoulders, d\u00e9collet\u00e9 and cleavage somehow, but that meaningless effort only drew more attention.She mimicked a young lady once again in the subject that appears in a dress like that.A crooked smile caught the corners of Biern\u2019s lips as he glanced at the woman. Her face, which had been parched like a corpse, was gradually burning red. Carefully raising her head, when her eyes met him, the woman was startled and even stepped backwards. Now, even her ears were dyed bright red.\u201cI sincerely apologize, Prince. Miss Hardy was very nervous and made a big mistake.\u201dAnother wife walked up to the two struggling women. The moment she recognized her with her bowed head raised, Biern understood the full story of this absurd commotion.It was Victoria Meyer. The very woman who is the best broker in the Letchen marriage market.* * *The flower of this prom was Erna Hardy, no matter what anyone said.With the story of her belated debut in the social world, her unconventional appearance, and the name of Prince Biern, there was no lady who came close to defeating her as she was on the tip of everyone\u2019s tongue.\u201cIt is also Countess Meyer. She\u2019ll even use the Grand Duke to make that girl stand out.\u201d\u201cI guess that had to be the strategy. How did you know that Prince Biern would appear late?\u201d\u201cIf not for strategy, how can you explain it? By the way, that girl isn\u2019t ordinary either. I thought she would be naive because she\u2019s from the countryside, but how could she do such a clever thing?\u201dThe eyes of the ladies who glanced at Erna, who was sitting quietly at the edge of the banquet hall, were filled with contemptuous curiosity.A beautiful woman who even caught the eyes of Biern Dneister.Thanks to the commotion, Erna Hardy achieved such a infamous reputation in an instant. Even he, who was Princess Gladys\u2019 ex-husband, acknowledged her, so the general consensus was that she was a great beauty for sure. Even those who criticized Viscount Hardy for exposing her vulgar greed to sell her daughter at a high price were not able to argue about Erna Hardy\u2019s beauty.\u201cMiss Hardy, how are you?\u201dCountess Meyer, who had been walking around the banquet hall, approached Erna. Erna reflexively grabbed her shawl and raised her head. Her eyes filled with resentment were quite daring.\u201cYou\u2019re a girl with more of a personality it seems.\u201dCountess Meyer, who laughed lightly, sat down next to Erna and opened her fan.* * *The other girls were busy enjoying their dance, but Erna sat still on this corner bench. Many of the young men who came to apply for the dance were turned away without even managing to make eye contact with Erna properly.\u201cHow about dancing at least one song? It\u2019s a debutant.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t like this, ma\u2019am.\u201dErna\u2019s voice was still trembling softly. She looked around anxiously and then bowed her head again. She was like an idiot without even a speck of sociability, but this troubled expression also became charming where coupled with her pretty face.Countess Meyer gently waved her feather fan. The ugly shawl bothered her, but she decided to leave it alone because if she took it again, she would rip even the curtains of the royal palace to cover herself. She had already shown everything she needed to show, so the dress had fully served its purpose.\u201cLift your head.\u201dCountess Meyer lifted Erna\u2019s chin with the tip of the folded fan.\u201cIt is basic manners to look into the eyes of the other person when having a conversation.\u201d\u201cMadam, please\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cHe did quite well in front of Prince Biern. Did you completely forget about that?\u201dContrary to her gentle smile, her voice was cold.Prince?Erna, who had been contemplating for a moment, involuntarily closed her body, clenching her lips. It was because a man by that name flashed into her mind.As the world began to spin and suffocate, Erna lost all judgment. It was only after she was able to breathe that she realized what she had done and to whom. Just thinking about it made her feel like the fear would overwhelm her again.\u201cI respect the notion of not dancing, but try to keep a minimum of dignity. It means to keep in mind that this is a way to protect the honor of the Baden family, who have raised Ms. Hardy. Do you understand?\u201dThe honor of the Baden family.Countess Meyer, who had said those words that scratched her heart deeply, quietly left Erna\u2019s side.Left alone, Erna counted numbers with her eyes closed. It was only when he counted to twenty that she was able to regain stable breathing. It\u2019s never been like this in Buford. For a moment, she felt like a helpless fool.Be patient a little longer.Suppressing the urge to run away from here, Erna slowly opened her eyes. After all, he was there. Grand Duke Schwerin. The Prince of Lechen who watched Erna Hardy\u2019s pathetic figure up close.He was talking, leaning against an ornate marble column. Standing opposite him was a man who looked like him. He was the twin brother and Crown Prince Leonit. They were surprisingly identical in height, physique, and appearance. The only difference is that the Crown Prince is wearing glasses.Although Buford is a remote country that feels isolated from the rest of the world, even there, the twin princes are quite famous. Erna, who was indifferent to such rumors, even remembered his name. Originally, the first, Prince Biern, was the crown prince, but his bad conduct caused anger and resentment throughout the kingdom, and he said that the position was passed to his younger brother, Prince Leonit.Without trying to avoid her gaze, Erna let out a sigh without realizing it. It was because of the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when she looked atPrince Biern, who began to walk with his neck upright.Although they look the same, the twins\u2019 gait is markedly different.Unlike the Crown Prince, who walked with an upright and modest posture like a soldier, the Grand Duke moved as if enjoying a leisurely stroll. It felt as if only the air surrounding him was flowing slowly. It was a figure I had seen at the train station and on Tara Avenue.\u201cPoisonous mushroom\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dThe Grand Duke suddenly turned his head towards Erna, who was muttering blankly. It was a moment when their eyes met with no chance to escape.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018Her beauty is truly outstanding I must say.\u2019\u00a0Bjorn thought as she stared at the lady who calmly looked back at him.Just like Gladys Hartford, Erna Hardy possessed an allure that stood out among the others. Even though both women had completely different lineages, both of them were unparalleled beauty that could cause an uproar wherever they went. Perhaps this was the reason he didn\u2019t mind getting involved in a scandal with her even when he normally found such stuff distasteful. However, such a beautiful appearance ended up being wasted due to her insufficient lineage.He had no aversion when declaring such a statement because it was obviously a fact. Of course, he was fully aware how rude such a belief could be.\u201cAre you sure there is nothing between the two of you?\u201d Leonid, who was also carefully watching Erna, asked sternly.\u201cWell, If you\u2019re interested in her\u2026 I can help you seduce her.\u201d Bjorn kept his gaze at the lady and gave a witty reply while slowly turning his head to face Leonid.\u201cWhat kind of relationship do you want to have with her?\u201d His lips contained an elegant smile that completely contrasted the vulgar implications of the question he asked\u201cYou\u2019re crazy\u2026\u201d Leonid, who couldn\u2019t help but\u00a0 laugh at such an absurd statement, decided to stop doubting his older brother at this point. Bjorn Dniester was certainly a madman in many ways, but at least he was a madman true to his desires.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and ask her for a dance? Do you think she would dare to refuse you, the Crown Prince?\u201d Bjorn asked as he took a glass of champagne handed to him by the servant, who quietly approached them, while glancing towards Lady Hardy.\u201cWhy do I have to do that?\u201d\u201cYou like her, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cWhat crazy statement are you talking about?\u201d Leonid asked with a frown.\u201cI was just wondering. Maybe you are worried that the girl you like might be having an affair with your brother.\u201d\u201cNot at all. I am not interested in such a woman.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so rigid, lighten up.\u201d Bjorn shrugged his shoulders lightly and emptied his drink at once.Women could freely socialize and expand their social connections during this season, however, some would resort to unsavory means just to quickly achieve results. Although they would succeed to achieve popularity, this kind of fame was usually accompanied by animosity. A family that decided to sell their daughter after heavily deceiving her, and a daughter who willingly cooperates with their plans in exchange of her dignity and pride. In the end, such occurrences were never seen by the others in a favorable light, and no one wouldn\u2019t even have the heart to get acquainted with such a woman.The Crown Prince soon left after getting called by the elders of the royal family. His younger brother, who faithfully did the responsibilities that were once given to him, now perfectly performed the role of the Crown Prince.However, Leonid stopped after taking a few steps and looked back unexpectedly, perhaps suggesting that they should go together. Bjorn, on the other hand, roughly waved his hand to reject his brother\u2019s kind offer and turned around without any regrets. After all, Victoria Meyer was still there and he didn\u2019t want to interact with her any more than he already had.Bjorn had already given her a brief greeting with a slight nod and a small smile, and Countess Meyer also casually replied politely with a small bow. Aside from her filthy methods, that woman\u2019s passion and tenacity was something that he gladly acknowledged.After all, social events were Victoria Meyer\u2019s play table.A place where you can enjoy \u2018games\u2019 that could give such exciting stimulus to their boring, dull lives. He admits that he also enjoyed such games, and naturally was someone who could devise detailed strategies and achieve outstanding victories one after another. They had the same boldness of not getting caught up in trivial plays and testing their limits by increasing the difficulty progressively.Putting down his now emptied glass, he turned around to grab a new glass of champagne.If Victoria Meyer was born as a man, the fame that Bjorn had with playing cards might not have reached such heights of what that he had today. Anyway, it was an altruistic gamble to find a good marriage for the daughter of another family, so it was worth to say that she was a woman who enjoyed a much healthier hobby than the card players that gambled at various social clubs.The Grand Duke, who decided to approach the group of nobles who beckoned towards him, unconsciously turned his head to return the gaze that had been persistently following him for quite some time. It was actually that lady, Erna Hardy.The lady, who hesitated to even stand up a few moments ago, was startled to the point of sitting back down again when their gazes met each other. He didn\u2019t find it amusing when she grabbed her lace shawl around her tightly with her cheeks stained with a red blush.Had it not been for the name of Hardy and the existence of Victoria Meyer, he might have been fooled by such an innocent act. He didn\u2019t even expect that this lady could make the infamous Grand Duke break out in a cold sweat.Lady Hardy, who glanced at him with her trembling eyes, suddenly bowed her head and began to mumble something incomprehensible.What kind of hellish trick was she planning to do now?Bjorn quickly left the scene before he became a victim of Victoria Meyer\u2019s schemes once again. He silently offered his condolences to anyone who would fall on her wretched machinations.\u201cBjorn! Are you really sure you don\u2019t know that lady? Are you two in a relationship?\u201d The crowd rushed over and surrounded him while hurriedly asking.\u201cSay no, please.\u201dPeter said with a very serious expression on his face. After letting out a light sigh, Bjorn sat down and reclined deep in the chair while consuming the rest of his drink.\u201cYou better sober up, you fool.\u201d Prince Bjorn\u2019s lips gleamed in a reddish hue while giving out such friendly advice.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cBjorn needs to get married.\u201d Philip Dniester, who was contemplating seriously, abruptly said.\u201cI think that\u2019s the best for him. Isn\u2019t it?\u201dHe turned towards the Queen, who was sitting across from the table, as if asking for her consent. Isabel Dniester put down her teacup with a slight frown while clicking her tongue. With the kingdom enjoying peace and prosperity, Philip\u2019s greatest concern was his troublesome eldest son, Bjorn.\u201cBjorn will not even listen to you, much more follow your suggestion.\u201d\u201cWe have to somehow make him follow our will then!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know Your Majesty\u2019s son very well then it seems.\u201dA light sigh penetrated the night air filled with the scent of spring season. The terrace in the garden, where the King and his wife enjoyed tea time together, was filled with the scent of flowers in full bloom.\u201cI even secretly asked him if there was any girl he likes, but he resolutely denied having any. He even asked me if one divorce is not enough, what a smart-ass.\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d His Majesty\u2019s gray eyes, like those of his son, deepened.Gladys\u2019 name, which could be heard from all over the kingdom as of lately, was one of the things that bothered his son the most. He expected Bjorn to be on edge because of this, however, he was amazed to see his son\u2019s carefree attitude during the party. Philip could even foresee that something absurd would happen when that girl and Bjorn were reunited, and just thinking of such a scenario made his back ache. If that really happened, he would rally his army and wage war against Lars.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Philip. A reunion with Gladys will be unlikely to happen.\u201d Isabel reassured him as if she could hear her husband\u2019s concern with a single glance.\u201cYou know it, too. What kind of heartbreak from being abandoned Bjorn suffered to make that kind of decision.\u201d\u201cI know. Of course I still remember.\u201dThe King\u2019s eyes deepened once again as he nodded slowly.\u2018I want to step down from my position of being the Crown Prince and concede my rights to the throne. Additionally, I want to file a divorce.\u2019\u00a0Bjorn declared calmly on the night his child was born.\u2018I\u2019ve already made up my mind. I will not change my decision no matter what, Your Majesty.\u2019There was no emotion in his face as he slowly uttered those words. However, the silent rage and despair boiling inside the Crown Prince\u2019s eyes, who was only twenty-two years old at that time, overwhelmed Philip. In the end, they yielded to their son\u2019s will as they knew well that it was the best outcome for him. However, His Majesty couldn\u2019t even do anything to lessen the pain his son had suffered even when he was Bjorn\u2019s father because in the end, he was still the king of Lechen.\u201cBut honey, there\u2019s nothing more we can do at the moment no matter how much I think about it. Let\u2019s somehow try to get him to marry again\u00a0 for now.\u201d Philip\u2019s conclusion after much deliberation ended up being the starting point of this conversation.\u201cIt\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t tried that before. If it\u2019s marriage, then that kid will decide what he wants himself.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a problem because Bjorn doesn\u2019t want to get married.\u201d\u201cI guess in the end we need to make him interested in marriage again. Speaking of which, does that lady really have nothing to do with Bjorn?\u201d He looked at his wife with a mixture of expectation and concern.\u201cLeonid asked his brother a few times and it seems he is not interested in her.\u201d\u201cHmm.. Is that so?\u201d\u201cDo you really like that lady of the Hardy Family?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, but I welcome any lady that can move Bjorn\u2019s heart. As long as she\u2019s a better lady than that Gladys, of course.\u201d There was a faint hint of anger that could not be hidden in his voice as he mentioned Gladys\u2019 name.\u201cCome to think of it, it is time for us to move to the Summer Palace soon. Let\u2019s pay more attention to him this summer season. It sure will be nice to finally see Bjorn have a happy family before the end of the year.\u201d\u201cI agree\u2026\u201d She thought such sentiments were a dream that wasn\u2019t very likely to come true, but Isabel still happily nodded her head when such thoughts came to her mind. There was nothing else that could give such hope to her pitiful husband who was only worried about his eldest son every day other than seeing Bjorn finally live happily with someone who loves him dearly.\u201cI hope that he will find happiness soon.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna, Erna, Erna.The Grand Duke felt like that was the only name he could hear recently whenever he went after that cursed debutante ball. Much more so when he encountered male nobles who were infamous for their debauchery.\u201cIt\u2019s been a few days since I sent flowers to Lady Hardy and there is still no response. Did the maid possibly misplace the card I sent with it?\u201dBjorn slowly turned his head after hearing that cursed name once again. A group of noblemen, who lost all of their stakes, was sitting in the corner of the card room while talking about women.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask her personally? Even if she doesn\u2019t show up at any recent social gatherings, she might still occasionally show up around here and there.\u201d\u201cI could do that, but I need to have an ample amount of time. With such a ferocious maid standing guard around Lady Hardy like a dog from hell, no one could even come near her!\u201dLaughter erupted from all over the place. A long game finally ended with a few more vulgar jokes. Naturally, today\u2019s winner was Bjorn Dniester.\u201cI think you were planning to sweep away every gambling board and add your winnings to the Kingdom\u2019s finances, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cWhat an unfair and dirty world. Even the Goddess of Fortune grants her favors to a person depending on their appearance.\u201dVarious laments of those who had just lost erupted from everywhere, but Bjorn, without any reaction, left the room. The morning sunlight pouring in through the window was dazzling, illuminating his graceful figure. He continued walking across the club and towards the terrace facing the square. The crowd that followed his departing figure soon sat around the table that he chose.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you send a bouquet of flowers to Lady Hardy?\u201d Peter, who had been fiddling with the glass the waiter brought, slowly asked.Erna again.With his chin on the palm of his hand, Bjorn grabbed a glass of cold whiskey from the table. The clear sound of ice colliding with the glass resounded together with the name that was starting to bore him.\u201cAre you sure about what you\u2019re doing? If you take that woman, you will also acquire Viscount Hardy\u2019s debt as an added bonus, you know?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Well, what if it\u2019s an amount I can afford?\u201d\u201cI guess sooner or later we will hear the sad news of Count Bergen expelling his idiot son.\u201dPeter frowned and opened his mouth to refute, but couldn\u2019t make any objection in the end.Everyone in this social circle clearly knew what Viscount Hardy was trying to do with her daughter: using her as a bait for a wealthy nobleman. Such marriage with vulgar intent would never be accepted by a prestigious family with high authority and long history.If you\u2019re lucky, you would be able to marry a wealthy aristocrat or become a wife of a title-less wealthy man. Any more than this would be difficult to achieve, even Countess Meyer would be having a hard time. Considering the current situation of the Hardy family, even that outcome could be considered as a miraculous achievement.\u201cLook! There she is! It\u2019s Erna Hardy!\u201d Peter, who had a troubled expression on his face just a few moments ago, jumped up from his seat and excitedly shouted.Bjorn shook his head while loosely holding his glass, turning his gaze to where Peter was looking at. Two women could be seen walking slowly from the other side of Tara Avenue: a tall maid walking like a bouncing rubber ball and a petite lady adorned with lace who followed the maid lightly.She was wearing a wide-brimmed hat while also holding a parasol, making her face unrecognizable. However, there was no doubt that the lady was Erna Hardy, the only lady who would walk through downtown with an appearance of someone walking out of a 100-years old painting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sunset there is really pretty, shall we go see it tonight? No? You haven\u2019t recovered yet so the night air must not be good for your body, right? I\u2019m sorry for getting excited alone.\u201dLisa, who was full of excitement, suddenly slowed down her monologue and became worried. This made Erna, who was walking with her while listening to her animated chatter, stopped on her tracks and raised her head to look at the anxious maid.\u201cI\u2019m okay now, Lisa.\u201d\u201cReally? With your face still this pale? Err.. Well your skin is originally as pale as a newly fallen snow I guess.\u201d Lisa tilted her head while observing her master and let out a cheerful smile. It was a smile that made Erna also feel happy just by looking at it.Her lively maid once again continued to introduce various sights to be seen in Lechen with Erna following closely right behind her. It was still early in the morning, so most of the shops were still closed. Thanks to this, the streets were quiet and they were able to enjoy a comfortable walk in peace.After returning from the royal ball, Erna got sick and ended up being bedridden for three full days. The Viscount, finally realizing her fever showed no signs of ebbing down, hurriedly called over a doctor; it turned out her sickness wasn\u2019t that bad but it didn\u2019t mean that they could ignore it. In the end, her body could not stand the sudden changes in her environment together with the fatigue she just experienced during the party.Could she even survive for a year living like this?Everytime she remembered what just happened during the ball, her chest would get uncomfortably tight and she couldn\u2019t breathe well. She tried to consult the doctor about the pain she felt that night, where her vision turned white for a moment while feeling suffocated.\u2018You\u2019ll be fine once you get used to it. Just take it easy\u2019\u00a0His only response, however, was an indifferent reply that it was just a common neurosis.It didn\u2019t seem to be the case she thought, but Erna meekly agreed in the end. She had already made a promise, therefore, she had to play the role of Viscount Hardy\u2019s daughter well for a year. She needs to do it to protect the honor of her grandmother and the Baden Family.\u201cHello, Miss Hardy!\u201dAs soon as she finished reassuring herself, a loud cry was suddenly heard around her. Erna\u2019s shoulders reflexively jolted due to surprise and she started to look around for the source of the sudden greeting. She soon found out where it was, on the terrace of the splendid building behind the fountain stood a strange man who was waving excitedly.\u201cGood morning!\u201d The man once again shouted to greet the bewildered Erna and the gazes of the men sitting around the table behind him also turned to her.Erna, who was looking at them with a perplexed gaze, sighed involuntarily and took a step back. Her eyes ended up meeting the gaze of the blonde man sitting behind, lazily resting his chin on his palm.The only face that she could recognize from that group, the face of the Poisonous Mushroom Prince.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Look at that!A new laugh escaped from Biern\u2019s lips as he watched the back of Erna Hardi, who was running around. I feel like I\u2019ve been laughing a lot more these days. Thanks to that strange sale offered by the Viscount who was scammed.After giving an awkward greeting to Peter, Erna soon hid behind the maid. To be precise, the maid stopped Erna. After struggling for a while, Erna hurriedly turned around and started to run away. Rich frills and lace waving along the staggering footsteps made the desperate getaway look even more absurd.\u201cThat maid is the dog of hell.\u201dPeter shook his head and turned around.\u201cStill, the fact that he ran away even after seeing Biern is a little comforting. It\u2019s not about my face.\u201d\u201cbut. That\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cIt seems like nothing really happened, so was Biern being taken advantage of by Miss Hardy? As a means of getting attention at the prom?\u201d\u201cAll of these days are coming, even for the Grand Duke. How are you, Biern? How do you feel about being used and abandoned by a woman?\u201dThe group sitting at the table roared in silence as if the drink they had drank all night had not yet woken up.Biern, who stopped looking at the corner of the street where Erna had disappeared, responded by groaning and standing up. It was an attitude as usual. The party, who had been looking at them in awe, breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cI still don\u2019t know him well.\u201dPeter, who was watching Biern\u2019s back as he moved away, muttered with a sigh. The rest of the party also agreed with the view in silence.Light and attractive prodigal son in everything. Those who looked at Biern from a distance all spoke unanimously, and that was by no means a wrong view. But, well. Biern Dneister, seen up close, was a person who could hardly understand his inner feelings. The more casually he smiled, the more so.\u201cOh, Mr. You were scared!\u201dPeter\u2019s cry, who was once again unhappy, spread through the morning wind in the square.\u2018Would you look at that..\u2019A silent laugh escaped from Bjorn\u2019s lips as he watched Erna Hardy\u2019s back, who was now running away as if she was fleeing for her dear life. He felt like he was laughing more than usual as of lately, and it seems that he had to thank Viscount Hardy whose life savings got stolen and brought about a new source of entertainment for him.After giving an awkward greeting to Peter, Lady Hardy ended up hiding behind her maid. Well to be more precise, it was the maid trying to stop her from running away. However, after a brief struggle between them, Lady Hardy ended up victorious as she hurriedly turned around and started to run away. Rich frills and lace waved along her frantic footsteps, which made the scene of her desperate getaway even sillier.\u201cThat maid is the famous watchdog of hell.\u201d Peter shook his head and turned around.\u201cThe fact that she ran away after seeing Bjorn is a little comforting. I guess in the end it\u2019s not about my face.\u201d\u201cI guess there\u2019s really nothing between you and Lady Hardy. So, did His Highness get taken advantage of by Miss Hardy? Did she use you as a way of getting attention at the ball?\u201d\u201cSuch a day finally arrived for the Grand Duke! How are you, Bjorn? How do you feel about being used and abandoned by a woman?\u201d The group sitting at the table roared loudly as if they were still drunk from last night\u2019s alcohol.Bjorn, who stopped looking at the corner of the street where Lady Hardy had disappeared, responded by groaning and standing up. His actions were still his usual attitude, not giving any words as a response. The group, who had been looking at him with bated breath, breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cI guess I still don\u2019t know him that well.\u201d Peter, who was watching Bjorn\u2019s back as he moved away, muttered with a sigh. The rest of the group also agreed silently while looking at the same view.An attractive prodigal son who treated everything with a light attitude, ethereal and empyrean. Those who looked at the Grand Duke from a distance all agreed unanimously and they were by no means wrong. However, Bjorn Dniester when seen up close was only a person who could hardly understand his inner feelings in the end. The more casually he smiled, the more lost and helpless he became\u201cOi, great Grand Duke! You were scared!\u201dPeter\u2019s shout which was filled with indignation once again spread through the morning wind in the square.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Bjorn\u2019s carriage quickly left the club and started going towards the Schuber Palace. He languidly leaned back in his seat while staring outside the window. After the carriage passed through the busy street with various shops and government offices, the scenery now changed into a wide road along the riverbank filled with the shadows of tall trees that lined both sides of the path. His eyes, full of drowsiness and fatigue, watched the scene where light and shadows flickered as the carriage passed by quickly. Seeing the dark green forest, he realized that summer was approaching, which also meant that these peaceful days would soon come to an end.The royal family was due to visit Schuber during the weekend and the summer palace where they would stay was located inside the residence of the Grand Duke. Even though the two buildings were far enough that they needed a carriage to travel back and forth, they would still end up living inside the same territory. Thanks to this, Bjorn had no choice but to get caught up with a lot of troublesome work whenever it was summer.It was one of the duties assigned to him as the Grand Duke.With his tired eyes resting shut, the carriage soon crossed the bridge across the Arbit River and entered the entrance to the palace. An expansive garden lined with geometric patterns unfolded after they passed through the large ornate entrance decorated with the royal coat of arms. Soon, the clear sound of water flowing from the fountains which were installed in various places was transmitted to their ears together with a gentle breeze.Bjorn slowly opened his eyes as the wind brushed away his messy hair. Their carriage continued towards the southern end of the city where the Arbit River and Schber Bay meet. This is where the Grand Duke\u2019s Mansion, which was also known as the Water Palace, was located. The mansion got its name thanks to its location where a clear view of both the river and the sea could be seen. Additionally, the place had various gardens that were decorated with numerous fountains and waterways connecting to the streams.\u201cAre you here, Prince?\u201dThe door of the carriage, which had arrived at its destination, eventually opened. For some reason Mrs. Fitz\u2019s greeting, which was unusually not mixed with reproach, was heard. He lazily got off the carriage and looked at the odd maid with questioning eyes.\u201cA guest has visited and is now waiting for you\u201dMrs. Fitz breathed deeply and continued speaking with apprehension.\u201cWell\u2026 \u2026 It is Princess Gladys. She is currently waiting for you in the library.\u201dHer added statement stopped Bjorn, who had just entered the central hall, on his tracks. He lifted his head slowly and put his hands in the pockets of his trousers. The lights of the huge chandelier that never goes out sharply pierced his eyes with irritation.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Prince. We\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d He cut off Mrs. Fitz\u2019s words, which were insignificant for his current situation. There was hardly any emotion in his eyes as he slowly started to climb the carpeted stairs.\u201cA cup of tea, please. Make it strong.\u201d To Mrs. Fitz, who followed with a worried face, Bjorn gave a calm command. Unlike his lips that were softly curved in a calm smile, his cold eyes did not contain any hint of emotion.\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201dSwallowing the words she wanted to say, she took a step back and hurriedly went away to fulfill what she was ordered. Bjorn, on the other hand, soon disappeared after passing through the door of the study.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cIn the end, I should still apologize.. Right?\u201d Erna raised another question full of caution.\u201cWhat do you mean by apologizing?! You don\u2019t have to do that, miss!\u201d Lisa answered more adamantly after she returned from her trip to the kitchen.Startled, Erna appeared troubled as she fiddled with the teacup she was currently holding. She felt sorry for the mistakes she had made to His Highness during the ball and wanted to personally apologize. In the end, she couldn\u2019t find a suitable opportunity as he was always surrounded by a lot of people and Erna never had the courage to approach him.\u2018Perhaps the result would still be the same even if he was alone.\u2019\u00a0She thought as she looked down at her trembling fingertips. Just making eye contact with His Highness reminded her of that day which made her heart sink even more.How could she face His Highness personally with such a shameful memory haunting her?No matter how hard she tried, she would always end up running away in a hurry when she finally came to her senses. During those times, that embarrassing debutante dress also came to her mind without fail. Together with His Highness\u2019 calm gaze who casually glanced at her exposed body, she couldn\u2019t help but to feel like she would die of embarrassment.What a vulgar place the metropolis really was!!\u201cI think I still have to apologize, Lisa. I must have caused so much trouble for him.\u201d After thinking for a while, she still came up with the same decision in the end. She didn\u2019t really have the courage to face him, but it\u2019s rude to make a mistake and continue acting as if she was not aware of it.\u201cUgh\u2026. Wait a minute, miss.\u201d Lisa stood up and hurriedly left the bedroom. After a while, she returned carrying a large box in her arms.\u201cIt\u2019s a present for you but you have to return them after reading. If you want them, I\u2019ll give some to you, but they\u2019re shared items that the maids tirelessly saved up for unfortunately.\u201d Lisa seriously explained to the bewildered Erna.\u201cIs this for me? Why?\u201d\u201cYou must study. I\u2019ve collected and studied various news and gossip when I\u2019m not busy. I now know all sorts of stories.\u201d The maid held out the magazine at the top of the box in front of her. It was a weekly magazine with an in-depth article about the Poisonous Mushroom Prince, Prince Bjorn. Erna, in the end, had no choice but to accept it. After flipping through a few pages, a page filled with holes appeared in front of her.\u201cThis hole\u2026 \u2026 \u201d\u201cAh! It\u2019s because of those damna- no.. bad maids who cut out pictures of His Highness. Everyone is swearing at him but once a picture of the Poisonous Mushroom Prince was posted, this is what would happen.\u201d Lisa criticized the immoral maids. After a few condemning words, she suddenly became pensive and hurriedly stood up.\u201cOkay! While you are studying I\u2019ll go run an errand for you, miss!\u201d Before Erna could say anything, the maid urgently left the bedroom.Erna, who was left alone, looked down at the weekly magazine on her lap with a bewildered expression. Just a quick glance at it could tell her that it was a magazine filled with fairly provocative gossip. Struggling between the thought that it was not right to pry on other people\u2019s lives this way and the curiosity she couldn\u2019t shake off, Erna eventually ended up turning the page to the next article. The photos were gone and there were gaps on the pages here and there, but she didn\u2019t find it difficult to discern the full context of the whole article.She carefully read the magazines while the tea on the table cooled down. Various scandals and incidents involving Schuber socialites, brilliant advertisements, horoscopes, and even dating counseling; the magazine contained all kinds of miscellaneous news. It was quite a shocking new world for her, a completely different view from the magazines she used to buy back in her hometown.By the time she put down the last magazine, she was able to get a rough idea of the troublemakers in Schuber\u2019s social circle. The most prominent one was of course the Poisonous Mushroom Prince, Bjorn Dniester.Not all of the stories in these magazines were true but some of the articles were far beyond Erna\u2019s comprehension, especially those stories concerning His Highness, Prince Bjorn. Information about him disturbed her the most, since he was apparently a father who abandoned his own child. After his divorce from Princess Gladys, the Prince said that he had never met his son. Even when the child died of an illness without seeing his father for several years, the Prince still ignored him even at his funeral.Erna, who was quietly looking down at the stack of magazines, bit her lips involuntarily. It was considered shallow to judge someone you only met a few times, much more someone who you had not interacted with frequently. However, the pendulum inside her heart had already tilted towards one direction after learning such distressing information.The Prince seemed to be a bad person. A very bad person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Stunned to the point of not being able to reply back to his greetings, Bjorn casually approached her and sat down on the opposite side of the table. It was a reunion that he didn\u2019t expect that would happen so soon.\u201cIt has been a while.\u201d Lady Hartford finally remembered her manners and greeted back with difficulty. It was a stupid, worthless greeting that she practiced countless of times while she was inside the carriage on the way here. The Grand Duke, however, didn\u2019t bother to continue the conversation and just stared at her..\u201cI\u2019m sorry for my sudden visit without any prior notice, it\u2019s a big mistake on my part. Still, I think it would be better to meet here in private rather than outside\u2026 \u2026 \u201dHer voice trembled so much that she couldn\u2019t even finish her apology properly, but Bjorn continued to be silent. Clear drops of tears started to pool in her eyes and her soft lips were bitten in frustration.The gap between the Bjorn in her memory and the Bjorn in front of her was so glaringly obvious. The man that she remembered in the past still had hints of childishness and immaturity within him, but now, her shoulders couldn\u2019t stop from shuddering from his intimidating and mature aura that he currently possessed. Together with his face that now appeared sharper and his lean but toned body that couldn\u2019t be hidden by his attire, the current Bjorn Dniester was someone that she couldn\u2019t even recognize.In the end, Gladys couldn\u2019t look at him any longer and bowed her head down in shame. She was wondering why her vision was getting blurry, until thick tears finally fell on the back of her trembling hands.Bjorn, however, just continued watching this scene of a pretty lady crying beautifully without any changes on his expression. Not long after, Mrs. Fitz finally arrived with refreshments at hand and saw such a view. If it was anyone else that didn\u2019t have any idea about the history of the two ex-lovers, they would have condemned Bjorn for being heartless. Unfortunately, it was her, the former Crown Prince\u2019s nanny, so she completely ignored Gladys, set the tea table up and left right away.Indifferently looking at the woman who was once his wife, the Grand Duke leisurely grabbed the teacup in front of him. Gladys, on the other hand, continued to weep pitifully even after the sugar cubes thrown into the teacup lost their shape.\u2018I guess it\u2019s good to know that nothing has changed.\u2019\u00a0He let out a silent exhale that resembled a sigh. The scene in front of him brought out a memory from long ago when she received the news of their divorce; Gladys Hartford\u2019s only reaction of weeping in the same way as she was crying now.\u201cIt\u2019s still the same boring reaction.\u201dHe slowly took a sip of the cooled tea while he moved his gaze to the window. As the strong tea gradually awakened his sluggish mind, his patience finally started to get depleted bit by bit.\u201cI remember we have cleanly broken off any relationship between us, Princess.\u201d His eyes, which reflected the sparkling river and the forest beyond the window, narrowed little by little.\u201cI gave what I was supposed to give\u2026\u201d He turned around to face her after putting down the now emptied teacup..\u201c\u2026and I already got what I was supposed to receive\u2026\u201d His amiable face changed in an instant as the light smile on his lips finally disappeared.\u201c.. isn\u2019t that right, Gladys?\u201d\u201cBjorn, I\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cJust tell me what you want already.\u201d He cut her off with a voice void of any emotion.\u201cI guess it has been a long time that you have already forgotten my almost non-existent patience?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I still remember\u2026.\u201d Gladys, who barely stopped sobbing, replied with difficulty.\u201cBecause of me\u2026 We\u2026 For what happened..\u00a0 I\u2019m so sorry\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d The tears welling up in her large eyes finally flowed down when she opened her eyes that were tightly shut. Her beautiful little face now drenched in tears, gleamed with a soft light in the morning sun like a pure, white rose blooming for the first time.Bjorn leaned back deep in his chair and just stared at her, the lady in front of him was still as beautiful as before. Nonetheless, the fact that such a mesmerizing appearance failed to provoke any emotion in him was in the end no different from before.\u201cAnd so?\u201d He asked with a smile back on his lips.\u201cThere is no way you would have visited Lechen just to say such a thing. Did the King of Lars give you an order in the end? Now that all the problems are gone, he hopes you will once again get along well with your ex-husband?\u201dGladys, who licked her lips slightly, lowered her gaze in shame. Her two hands, that were tightly clasped together as if offering a sincere prayer, were now as pale as a blank sheet of paper. The clear answer that was delivered with her silence made Bjorn\u2019s smile to deepen.\u201cWhat an obedient daughter who listens so well to her father. I see that you\u2019re still a very good child.\u201dAn innocent and tender-hearted princess who knows nothing of malice. If humans were to be divided into the dichotomy of good and evil, Gladys Hartford would certainly belong to the side of good. He could freely admit that fact, although he doesn\u2019t hold that statement in high-regard.\u201cIt\u2019s not just for that reason!\u201d Gladys pulled out a handkerchief and wiped away her tears, then raised her head once again.\u201cI really wanted to apologize, so I gathered all of my courage to do so. Because I feel sorry for you all this time\u2026 I.. For what I did\u2026..\u201d\u201cYou must have misunderstood something, Princess.\u201d Bjorn slowly lowered his eyes, feeling a suffocating and foreign emotion for the first time.\u201cThe deal we had was pretty fair. In terms of profit and loss, we might have even benefited on the contrary.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cI am moved to tears because my ex-wife is so worried about me.\u201d He stood up while replying sarcastically.She, however, didn\u2019t really harbor any negative feelings about their divorce. Their relationship didn\u2019t have any pure feelings such as love right from the start and four long years had already passed, any sort of attachment had already disappeared between them.In the end, this dirty feeling that was plaguing his chest, if he had to define it, would just be annoyance.Bjorn, whose gaze was at the table\u2019s smooth surface, gently pushed the teacup with the tip of his long finger towards the edge. The sound of breaking glass soon shook the stifling stillness of the study.He slowly rang a bell without any remorse even with the now speechless Gladys in front of him and not long after, a middle-aged maid came into the study. Princess Hartford began to sob once again as the Grand Duke\u2019s gaze passed through the sparkling shards of the broken teacup and stopped at the face of the bewildered maid.\u201cClean it up.\u201d He ordered with a light smile on his face then proceeded to leave the study without looking back. As soon as he entered the bedroom after being mentally beaten up by the unexpected encounter he had with his ex-wife, a feeling of intense fatigue came rushing in.Instead of casually throwing himself on the bed to take rest as usual, Bjorn instead opened the window facing the river. The cheers and shouts of the group of people, who had started practicing rowing since early morning, came rushing inside the solemn room along with the faint humid smell carried by the wind.With a sigh mixed with laughter, he picked up a cigar and lit it up while leaning against the windowsill. The small waves of water in the flowing river dazzled his eyes when the morning sunshine shone on the water surface. The smoke that had languidly flowed out from his lips for quite some time was soon blown away by the wind while the bright ray of the early summer sun pierced his throbbing eyes.Today was definitely a boring and annoying day.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cIt seems that Count Lehman is the most prominent husband candidate for the Hardy family as of this moment?\u201dErna Hardy\u2019s name now became a regular topic of their group while playing cards. Bjorn glanced at Peter, who was sitting next to him, while checking the cards in his hand.\u201cCount Lehman? That old man is still alive?\u201d Giggles and laughter flowed from everywhere as an absurd question was asked with seriousness.Count Lehman, an old man who would soon turn seventy years old, wanted to marry a young lady who was less than twenty years old.Bjorn raised his eyebrows slightly and leaned backwards with his long legs crossed together. The current round was going well for him and as long as there were no unexpected turn of events, the winner of this round was clear as if it had already been decided.\u201cI heard that Viscount Hardy meets up with Count Lehmann from time to time. A few days ago, he said that he enjoyed an opera performance together. Of course, Erna Hardy joined them as well.\u201d\u201cHey, as long as you pay a really high price, nothing else matters I guess.\u201d\u201cI guess their marriage would be of that kind, huh? If that old man suddenly died early, I could just sell my daughter once again to another rich man. Such a marriage seems very attractive for Viscount Hardy I presume.\u201dThe atmosphere of their game gradually reached its climax, while words of ridicule and pity for Lady Hardy were diligently exchanged between the participants. The Grand Duke decided to take a step back while waiting for the right moment to strike once and for all, it was a game that was good enough for him to see until the very end after raising the stakes again and again.\u201cAh! Bjorn, I heard that Princess Gladys took trouble to visit Schuber Castle to meet her ex-husband? Will this year\u2019s summer end up as the hottest in the history of Lechen? \u201dPeter smirked in a strange way while directing his gaze towards the Grand Duke. However, the subject of the controversial topic just lit up a cigarette while completely ignoring the gazes around him.\u2018Everyone\u2019s living their life in such a boring way.\u2019A life where most of their time was spent talking about others, most of the nobility partake in such a distasteful hobby. It seems that the most popular topic this summer would be about the marriage business of the Hardy family and the reunion of the former Crown Prince and his ex-wife.\u201cMy mother said that Princess Gladys had come to Lechen with the intention of forgiving her ex-husband and reuniting with him. It\u2019s a pity that even when such a kind Princess offered a magnanimous act, she got ignored like it was not a big deal. Of course, this made a lot of nobles curse our Prince here more harshly.\u201d\u201cOh, I heard that too. If such a beautiful Princess decided to visit me, I would probably have gone crazy. Prince Bjorn really lives in a different world that we common people couldn\u2019t imagine being in .\u201d\u201cBy the way, if you marry the same woman twice, do you need to have another wedding? Will it be embarrassing for the bride and groom to make the guests attend the same wedding twice?\u201dPeter asked with his eyes twinkling while looking at his cards anxiously as the game seemed to have finally ended. Bjorn responded by exhaling a long puff of cigarette smoke towards Peter\u2019s face.Peter yelped and cursed at the Grand Duke\u2019s shameless actions but soon gave up and began to turn his attention to another discussion. The new topic of the table, which was busy predicting the winner of the latest horse race and sharing information about investing in a new shipping company just a moment ago, once again turned back to the marriage scheme of Viscount Hardy.\u201cNo matter how much money you need in a hurry, isn\u2019t it a bit unfair to sell your daughter to an old man who is about to die?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a gamble worth trying? The Lehman family only has a daughter and a youngest son, if things go awry between the father and his children then all of that wealth would become Lady Hardy\u2019s.\u201d\u201cSon? That old man still managed to make\u00a0it\u00a0stand up and have another child?\u201d\u201cI guess he is still confident regarding that aspect to be able to buy a young bride at a high price.\u201dLeonard shrugged and put his cards down. It was a pretty long round, but it was still a game with a high win rate for Bjorn.\u201cPoor Ms. Hardy. She became an old man\u2019s bride because she couldn\u2019t meet a proper man whose age is the same as hers..\u201d Peter lamented as he let out a sigh as if he was genuinely sorry.\u201cCome to think of it, Miss Hardy strangely resembles Princess Gladys, don\u2019t you think? They look different, but their atmosphere is somewhat similar in the end.\u201d\u201cThey are both beauties that possess a delicate aura like an innocent baby deer.\u201dA crooked smile hung on the corners of Bjorn\u2019s lips as he glanced over jerks nodding their heads in agreement.Said baby deers could still bite you hard if they so wished to. He guessed these bunch of idiots need to experience this first-hand before they come to their senses.\u201cThen, shall we do something interesting?\u201dWhile Bjorn was choosing his next hand, Leonard suddenly exclaimed with an odd tone.\u201cLet the poor and miserable Lady Hardy enjoy the courtship of a young man before she falls into the deep pit of despair of a loveless marriage with an old man. Wouldn\u2019t that be a good memory to give to her?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you see her running away quickly after someone offered a simple greeting to her? I already tried to court her by repeatedly sending flowers and cards for days, but no response has been sent in reply for my earnest feelings.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s make a bet then.\u201dLeonard\u2019s eyes gleamed as he scanned the poker chips piled up on the card table. Bjorn, who had been making calculations to finally end this game, raised his head with a wrinkled eyebrow.\u201cWhoever can move Ms. Hardy\u2019s heart wins. In other words, it is a bet on who will earn her favor first. How about it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the end, it didn\u2019t take too long for the silence that enveloped the card table after such remarks to change to an enthusiastic cheer.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fun? How about betting all the chips we have here?\u201d\u201cGreat! I will join, I will join!.\u201d Peter pushed the stack of poker chips in front of him with excitement.Bjorn let out a low sigh and lazily leaned back on his chair. As more fools showed their interest in participating in the useless bet one by one, the game that they were just playing became neglected.\u2018Leonard, you bastard. You think I\u2019m going to lose this new bet, just watch how I\u2019ll overturn your game board thoroughly.\u2019Leonard didn\u2019t flinch despite Bjorn\u2019s annoyed glance. In the meantime, poker chips from all over the place filled the center of the messed up table. The participants realized that the stakes were much larger than they had initially expected and now they all seriously desired to win. However, there was only one person who had not yet placed a bet.\u201cBjorn, are you going to join too? Come on.\u201d Peter sneaked up to Bjorn\u2019s side while trying to persuade him.Everyone in the room knew that Bjorn Dniester would never participate in this type of bet. Therefore, it was necessary for them to offer a bigger stake since the chance to rob the Prince, who was well known for his luck in gambling, doesn\u2019t come very often.\u201cJoin us, yea?\u201d Peter asked again nervously, pushing the poker chips piled up in front of Bjorn.Although the Prince was annoyed by the incessant begging, he didn\u2019t turn down their provocation in the end. The attitude of leaving in the middle of a game annoys him, but there was nothing that he could do if they threw in such generous bait.Excited, Peter gathered all the remaining chips to the center of the table. The stakes for receiving Erna Hardy\u2019s favor were now enough to afford a single townhouse in the city center.\u201cLet\u2019s start the game at today\u2019s art exhibition. Everyone is going to attend, so it\u2019s fair, isn\u2019t it?\u201dLeonard, who was the instigator of this pathetic bet, solemnly declared.After drinking the rest of his drink, Bjorn checked his pocket watch. It was going to be morning soon and the opening ceremony of the Royal Academy of Arts\u2019 exhibition, which he had to attend even if he hated it, was approaching sooner than he expected.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The morning sun started to shine its light, marking the start of the day. However, Erna, who had been making lilies of the valley made of paper, was already wide awake even before the sky started to lighten up. The fake flowers, complete with their stems and leaves, were so realistic that they could be easily mistaken for freshly picked flowers.She proudly looked at the flowers that bloomed with the help of her own hands like magic. The more delicate a flower and their petals were, the more valuable it became; because of this reason fake flowers of the lily of the valley became one of the most expensive ones. It was her favorite flower and\u00a0 it was also the one she could make well.When she first started making and selling artificial flowers, she had to constantly make lily of the valley flowers because of its popularity. However, orders for this flower had noticeably decreased over the past few years, but still, lily of the valley was the flower she liked the most.She stood up as the early morning sunlight slowly reached her desk. A day in the city, compared to the countryside, began much later than what she used to. Such a habit was difficult for Erna to understand, as she would start her day even before the rooster began to crow. Because of this, she ended up waking early as usual. She didn\u2019t want to pass her time in vain so she decided to make artificial flowers at dawn, and now she had made enough flowers to fill a basket.\u2018It would be great if I could find a place to sell this.\u2019\u00a0She looked at the carefully crafted flowers with regretful eyes.In Buford, artificial flowers were sold through Mr. Alle, who runs a general store. He made an offer through Mrs. Greeve about his interest to sell the flowers, who later relayed the news to Erna. At first, it was only sold in small quantities at the rural general stores, but as her skills improved day by day, Ms. Alle hired someone that could sell her artificial flowers at various stores in the city at a higher price. Compared to a small rural store, stores found in the city were much larger and could attract more customers.Erna couldn\u2019t even imagine how huge a store, which mostly had every item imaginable, would be like, but this reason was something that didn\u2019t make her worried. If her artificial flowers were delivered there, she could get twice the price of what she sold at the Ale Cine shop.The living expenses earned by selling artificial flowers had contributed greatly to the income of the Baden family. Tea boxes and sugar canisters were no longer empty and there was no shortage of fabric, so the trouble of wearing old clothes was resolved. Thanks to the positive results of her hard work, the store in the city appeared more beautiful and important in her eyes than the Royal Palace at first. However, her views were overwritten after she finally had the chance to\u00a0 personally visit the Palace.\u2018Was there any way for me to sell artificial flowers directly to the stores?\u2019\u00a0Erna stared at the completed flowers while seriously contemplating.Although she was able to protect the country house by making a deal with his father, the living expenses of the Baden family would be having difficulties once again since they didn\u2019t have the money she provided unlike before. Mrs. Greeve, whose eyes had deteriorated a lot, could no longer make artificial flowers and Erna had taken this duty as hers and had been the one making them for years.\u201cI can do whatever I want here, so all I need to do is find a store that can sell these. If that\u2019s too difficult, how about I send the finished flowers back to Buford? But if the postage costs are too much, I guess I can personally deliver them to Buford and visit everyone at least once every season.\u201dA light knocking sound rang out when Erna reached such a conclusion. It was her maid, Lisa, who came inside with a large box in hand. Inside was a new dress and hat for her to wear.\u201cThis dress is pretty decent, isn\u2019t it my Lady?\u201dLisa smiled as she showed off the blue dress she pulled out of the box, as if she was trying to appease a child; and Erna smiled and nodded her head in agreement. Even when it was now in the middle of summer, it was still a\u00a0 dress that was quite shameful by her standard.\u00a0 While it doesn\u2019t expose any skin under her collarbone, compared to the last dress she wore on that night, it was a much more decent dress.\u201cWhy did you bring a new set of clothes?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you know? You have to attend the Art Exhibition\u2019s opening ceremony today.\u201dErna and Lisa stared at each other, eyes widened in surprise for different reasons.\u201cThe art exhibition? Me?\u201d\u201cYes! It\u2019s a famous exhibition that is held every summer at the Royal Academy of Arts.\u201d Lisa was delighted as if it was her own business, and flipped the dress again in front of Erna.\u2018The Royal Academy of Arts.\u2019A smile slowly began to spread across Erna\u2019s lips, who had been excitedly repeating those words. It was thanks to the nostalgic name of her only friend, Pavel, that was connected with that place.\u2018Maybe I can meet Pavel.\u2019With that hope, Erna started her day with more energy than usual. After breakfast, she dressed up and was led by the Viscount into the carriage. Even the landscape of an unfamiliar city did not feel as threatening as usual.\u201cI hope you do well today. Unless you have a weird hobby that finds joy in being humiliated.\u201dAs the art academy got closer, Viscount HardY, who had been silent all along, spoke up. His voice, which did not hide his displeasure, was as cold as ice.\u201cYes, Viscount. I will do my best.\u201dErna calmly gave the best possible answer.She was also vaguely feeling that she had a poor reputation. The fervent interest to her as of lately has led to numerous misunderstandings and speculations, and it was soon established as a firm truth. The more she tried to get rid of her weird stigma, the more she felt like she was sinking deeper and deeper.So, she had to endure for today until the end.As Erna hypnotized herself with encouraging words, the carriage stopped while she was busy preparing mentally. A beautiful building made of white marble shone brightly under the sunlight, dazzling her eyes.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cMiss Hardy, you\u2019re really a helpless girl.\u201dVictoria Meyer\u2019s deep sigh broke the silence of the still garden. Erna, on the other hand, was sitting on a bench as if she would collapse at any moment with how hard she was gasping for breath. It was a bit pitiful and pathetic to see her chasing after her breath after only walking for a bit .\u201cIsn\u2019t it time for you to get used to it? How long do you plan on showing such a pathetic side of yours?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019ll do my best, Countess.\u201dErna barely managed to open her lips and stammered in response. Her clear blue irises seemed to stand out even more because of her teary red eyes. Even when such a scene made others look abhorrent, such a pretty face that caught the eye of various nobles made Victoria even more disturbed with how an unfavorable image could still be considered as a part of her charm.Miss Hardy could have used her looks with just a small smile and a little bit of flattery and different types of men would be on her beck and call. Seeing Erna who couldn\u2019t even properly do such an easy and simple task made Countess Meyer\u2019s chest suffer from searing pain of regret.She had seen many young girls who were unfamiliar and had difficulties with socializing, but Erna Hardy was the first one who hated it so much that she would even have trouble breathing when talking to strangers. Countess Meyer thought that maybe she could endure it quite well today, but the symptoms started once again when the son of Count Bergen spoke to her. If she hadn\u2019t been quick to support this little Lady and take her out to the garden, Erna would have become a spectacle for everyone to see today.\u201cI didn\u2019t do that on purpose. Countess, I really\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dVictoria cut off Erna\u2019s sentence while stroking her flabby forehead.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered for you to act like this if you were only a simple young lady. However, because of your circumstances, it is a tragedy for me and Ms. Hardy if you continue acting like this.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Lady Hardy raised her head and looked at the Countess with her wet eyes.The reputation of being a beauty comparable to Princess Gladys was deliberately created by the Hardy family, but it was also an objective fact that couldn\u2019t be refuted in the end. The reason Viscount Hardy, who was not so fond of this daughter of his even from the beginning, agreed to fully support her social debut was only because of Erna\u2019s beauty.In the end, this pretty lady was actually such a troublemaker.\u201cListen to me well, Ms. Hardy. This matter doesn\u2019t only concern you, it\u2019s also a matter regarding my honor on the line.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dErna, who seemed unable to understand Countess Meyer\u2019s words, asked confusedly. A deep sigh escaped Victoria\u2019s lips as she looked at the innocent looking lady in front of her. Ever since her plans went wrong at the beginning, she regretted that she might have made a mistake in taking this job, but in the end, it was already too late for her to quit.\u201cIf strangers scare you that much, let\u2019s pretend they\u2019re not people. Are you familiar with this saying Ms. Hardy? Think of them as flowers or animals in the countryside instead. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to think of things like that?\u201d The Countess seriously advised.It was silly for her to think of such a childish suggestion, much more advocate it to others; but Victoria was already at the end of her wits. She wouldn\u2019t sit still and let the Hardy Family\u2019s daughter pour muddy water over her splendid achievements.Once the time for the pre-ceremonies to begin arrived, Victoria Meyer hurriedly stood up from her seat.\u201cI\u2019ll go inside first,\u00a0 you can follow me inside once you manage to calm down. Do you understand?\u201dLady Hardy, who looked up at Victoria as if urging her to leave quickly, nodded her head vigorously. Taking another deep breath for the nth time today, Countess Meyer hurriedly left the garden.Erna squeezed her cold hands tightly, rubbing them together and warming them up with her breath from time to time. The choking pain in her chest had now subsided, but she did not dare to return to the place where countless eyes were staring at her.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201dShe struggled to sit upright while repeatedly reassuring herself with a familiar lie. She took out a handkerchief and wiped her face gently and carefully organized her messy clothes. It was then that she caught a glimpse of a familiar person at the end of the trail where she unintentionally turned her head.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Pavel?\u201dShe muttered with a blank face, while the tall man, on the other hand, disappeared into the depths of the garden. Red hair, a large physique and a familiar back; it was clearly the figure of Pavel Lore that she clearly remembered.\u201cPavel!\u201d She hurriedly called out the familiar name and stood up from her seat.The sound of hasty footsteps running along the paved pathway began to shake the languid atmosphere of the garden in the middle of summer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The voice, which had become clearer as the time passed, suddenly disappeared as soon as he opened his eyes. All that was left was the soft rustling of the leaves from the lush tree above his head and the sound of running water from a nearby small fountain.After letting out a soft sigh, he indifferently closed his eyes before all of the sudden, the unknown woman\u2019s voice could be heard once again.\u201cPavel!\u201dWith a voice resembling a clear chirp of a small bird, the woman called out someone\u2019s name.\u2018Pavel?\u2019Small dotted patterns, which were made by the sunlight streaming through the leaves, fluttered over Bjorn\u2019s face as he whispered the unknown name with his eyes closed. In the meantime, the unknown woman\u2019s voice had become much closer. Listening to her voice, he could tell that she was a very delicate and cheerful lady.He begrudgingly opened his eyes again as if resigning to his fate. After spending the night playing cards, he couldn\u2019t take a rest because he needed to attend this boring event right after. He planned to sneak out of the room and secretly take a nap somewhere hidden, but his plans were ruined since he must have chosen the wrong place.While he pressed his hand on the throbbing corner of his eye with intense pressure, the main culprit who destroyed his carefully crafted plan finally appeared. It was a petite lady in a blue dress.Erna Hardy.The cursed name abruptly came to his mind. At the same time, the said lady, who had been looking around, fell down from the bench all of the sudden. As if she had not yet noticed him lying on the opposite bench, Erna looked down at her toes with a sullen face. The shoes that crept out under the hem of her dress were as small as those of a doll.Bjorn, still lying on the bench, watched her closely. For a long time, she gasped for breath as she ran somewhere in such a hurry. His gaze, which passed through the ribbon that decorated the front of her dress, and towards her long brown hair that swayed along her steps, stopped on her soft lips that were slightly opened. At that moment, she suddenly raised her head.Erna, who was looking at Bjorn with eyes widened in surprise, suddenly stood up straight with a belated scream. The Duke watched the fascinating scene with interest, as Lady Hardy acted as if she had met a criminal when she was the one who broke into someone else\u2019s hiding place.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dShe apologized apprehensively with a voice that was barely squeezed out. The feather decorations on her hat, which fluttered due to her gesture of keeping her head down, made him smile unknowingly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I am so sorry, Your Highness.\u201dErna, who repeatedly apologized while bowing, hurriedly turned around and started to run away from him once again. Bjorn silently stared at her fleeing back with a smile, and finally decided to sit up.He found Lady Hardy, who always ran away at the mere sight of him, quite amusing. However, he also found it annoying at the same time.\u2018Why the hell does she run away everytime she sees me?\u2019\u2018Did I do anything to her??\u2019\u2018Strictly speaking, I should be the one running away with how I suffered all this time because of her.\u2019He begrudgingly stared at the tree trunk above him with a groan, and finally decided to stand up from the bench. While putting on the jacket he had taken off and fixing his tie that had become loose, he noticed the laughter that flowed out from inside was still present.\u2018Did she come to this remote garden corner to enjoy a secret rendezvous with her lover?\u2019Bjorn re-fastened his cufflinks while recalling the name that Lady Hardy was calling out a while ago. They probably promised each other to meet in this garden. He suddenly remembered those idiots who believed that Lady Hardy was an innocent baby deer a few days ago, and felt a smidgen of pity for that lucky man who she planned to meet.He started to walk away from the tree shade while paying his condolences to those poor men. It was then that he noticed something on the ground where Lady Hardy had been standing a while ago.Squinting his eyes, he slowly approached the unknown item and picked it up. It was a white lace handkerchief with an embroidery of her name.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Gladys Hartford arrived near the end of the opening ceremony, just when the congratulatory speech of the Director of the Royal Academy of Arts dedicated to the emerging artists who won the prize in this art exhibition had ended.The eyes of the guests who were preparing to applaud at the end of the speech were now all focused on Gladys. The Royal Couple and the Crown Prince, who were sitting at the top of the table, soon recognized the arrival of the late guest. Lady Hartford quietly entered the room while looking around embarrassingly, and even when most of the nobles were belatedly applauding the director of the Arts Center, their eyes however, were directed at the Princess.Despite being the center of attention, Gladys remained calm as her eyes fluttered from time to time. Her posture as she slowly but gracefully walked in the middle of the crowd while with an elegant smile clearly showed her unperturbed emotion. It was a habit that her body remembered even without trying hard, as she lived this way all her life as a Princess to the point that it became a habit.The guests watched Princess Gladys bowing politely to King Phillip with a mixture of admiration and regret. With the speech done, everyone was now free to browse around the exhibit, but no one had left the hall because of the exciting spectacle happening at the moment.\u201cPrincess Gladys\u2019 beauty is still so breathtaking, not to mention that elegant figure. I heard that she also visited the Grand Duke\u2019s castle. Wouldn\u2019t you hate such a husband who made you do all of that?\u201d\u201cStill, they were once a couple and also had a child between them. How easy could it be to cut off their relationship completely?\u201d\u201cWithout such a tragic incident, Princess Gladys would certainly have become a Queen that is as great as Her Majesty. The more I think about it, the more I couldn\u2019t understand the Grand Duke. Why the hell did he commit such a horrendous thing with a wife like that? Even his rights to the throne were even stripped off in the end. \u201dThe low whispers were quickly exchanged among the guests, their voices harmonizing with the music that the band had begun to play. Erna stood quietly beside a potted palm tree in the corner of the room, as her gaze stared at the place where the guest\u2019s eyes were focused. The princess, who she was familiar with from the pictures in the newspapers and magazines that Lisa gave her, was much more dignified and beautiful than she had imagined.\u2018How could His Highness have committed an affair with a wife like that?\u2019Erna frowned involuntarily when she remembered the man lying on the stone bench in the garden. Fortunately, the unpleasant memories did not last long as the name of her close friend came into her mind once again.Pavel.It was obviously Pavel\u2026She chased after him frantically, but in the end, she only managed to see the back of her dear friend whom she missed. There was no way that she made a mistake, since he\u2019s been her friend for over 10 years. She could easily recognize him even when she could only see his back.Erna raised her eyes cautiously and looked around once again. Her heart began to race with hope that maybe she could finally meet Pavel here, however, it didn\u2019t take long for that excitement and hope to turn into fear.In her mind, she couldn\u2019t help but feel that the eyes of the guests were peeking at her. She suddenly felt her chest tightened up with apprehension, making it difficult for her to properly breathe. Erna clasped her trembling hands and stood closer to the palm tree that was taller than her in an attempt to hide her small figure behind the tree\u2019s leaves.\u2018There are no humans here.. Only animals and plants\u2026\u2019She seriously thought of the absurd advice Countess Meyer had given her. The slender young ladies became weasels running in the woods, the old gentleman with a sloppy face was an angry goose, and that woman in a dark green dress with a bright red ribbon was a Yew Tree that bore fruit.The absurd imagination soon unexpectedly brought her a sense of stability. Even though her body was still shaking and sweating, she was able to avoid the pain of not being able to breathe due to panic.Finally able to breathe even for a bit, she finally noticed the commotion within the crowd of guests. Prince Bjorn was now standing at the entrance of the hall, and\u00a0 Princess Gladys, who was greeting the Crown Prince, also became aware of the Grand Duke\u2019s presence shortly thereafter.Prince Bjorn stopped for a moment and stared at Princess Gladys with narrowed eyes, and entered the hall shortly after. Erna became part of the onlookers, as she gazed at his dignified figure with bated breath.\u2018A wolf.\u2019Staring at the prince who leisurely crossed the hall with unhurried steps, such a thought came into her mind unexpectedly.\u2018He is certainly a man who reminded me of that graceful beast, I guess.\u2019A beautiful and majestic white wolf, just like the one in the crest of the Dniester Royal Family.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Bjorn looked at Gladys as he took a slow step forward. It wasn\u2019t difficult for him to figure out what the current situation and his ex-wife\u2019s intentions were. It seems that he was too carefree, he thought she already understood what he wanted after their last conversation.\u2018I guess she\u2019s still very obvious and typical.\u2019Even with apparent nervousness on her face, Gladys still showed hope when she caught a glimpse of him; such a situation made him laugh. To say that her return to Lechen was not the will of King Lars seemed sincere, if he was idiotic enough. Originally, she was someone who was so pure that lying was something that she couldn\u2019t do. However, that pure and innocent Princess taught the Grand Duke certain truths that were more despicable and irresponsible than lies.Examining his father, mother, and Leonid\u2019s stiff expressions, Bjorn arrived in the middle of the hall. The sunlight streaming in through the floor-to-ceiling windows and the dazzling light of the chandelier enveloped his upright and dignified figure.Her relationship with Princess Hartford was quite a fair deal for both of them, and they ended it up in a clean and concise manner.This view of his still hadn\u2019t changed, however, it was a different story if Gladys wanted to start a new game. He had no intention of letting himself suffer, especially if the cause was Gladys Hartford herself. Suddenly, a certain lady caught his attention.The Grand Duke shifted his gaze to Erna, who was hiding next to a potted palm tree. His lips, that were tightly closed in a straight line, curled up softly as he remembered the handkerchief that was inside his pocket.\u2018Such an obvious and boring old trick\u2019That lady\u2019s intention was so obviously clear to him. Seeing that she was so good at committing embarrassing schemes, it seemed that this Lady Hardy was also as obvious and typical as a certain princess that he knows well.\u2018Then, there is no other game piece that is as advantageous as her.\u2019Finally reaching a clear conclusion internally, Bjorn took a step without hesitation. He slowly approached the place where Gladys stood, when suddenly, he turned around to another direction which caused the agitated crowd to break into a commotion. Erna, realizing that something bad was gonna happen soon, took a step back but the Prince quickly narrowed the gap that she had meaninglessly created.There was no reason for him to hesitate if Lady Hardy was his current winning hand, both in the bet that he made with his peers and in the game he was playing with Gladys. Give what you could give and you would receive what you deserve, that was how gambling works. Not to mention, he was also someone whom others could make an easy and clean transaction to.It was agreed that the bet\u2019s starting point was today\u2019s exhibition, and the day of the final battle was the day of the rowing competition.Bjorn closed the gap between Erna with the last few steps as he carefully recalled the contents of the bet that they made.The rowing competition was held every summer, on the longest day of the year; and during this day, various festivals were held all over Lechen to celebrate the hot season. It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that it was the highlight of the summer for socialites, it was the largest and most colorful event celebrated for that season.The highlight of the Schwerin Summer Festival was the fireworks display on the Avit River during the night of the end of summer. There was always a scarcity of boats in the city during the event, thanks to the multiple young lovers who believed in the childish myth that seeing the fireworks on a boat together ensures a long lasting relationship between the couple.On that special day, the person who boarded the boat with Erna would become the winner of the bet. He thought he was a bit of an asshole and this view was still not much different as of now he admits, but in the end, Bjorn Dniester had to win any bet that he participated in.It was not a bad deal for her too, as her prestige would rise a little more because of the rumor that she was someone who was courted by him, Prince Bjorn. Wasn\u2019t that what Lady Hardy\u2019s accomplice, Countess Meyer, was aiming for in the first place? If more bidders jump in with a burning desire to win her hand in marriage, she might get a groom that was far better than that dying old Count.\u201cHere you are, young lady.\u201dBjorn looked down at the petite lady with friendly eyes, his voice filled with power, as if he wanted the other guest\u2019s to hear him. Standing under his shadow, Erna couldn\u2019t help but to blink her big round eyes in confusion.\u201cYou left this in the garden.\u201dWith his head bowed down while maintaining eye contact with Lady Hardy, he deliberately held out the handkerchief he took out slowly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayErna\u2019s face turned bright red when she finally saw the initials of her name embroidered in one of the corners of the handkerchief.\u201c\u2026\u2026thank you.\u201d After a while, she reached out a trembling hand and received the handkerchief. He found it unbelievable that she unknowingly performed the classic scheme of deliberately leaving something behind.Bjorn, on the other hand, watched her reaction with keen interest.An audacious lady who tried to use her body to increase her worth, and at the same time\u00a0 she was someone who took walks on Tara Boulevard while wearing a rustic dress. Currently, he was having a hard time trying to figure out which one of these facets was the real Erna Hardy. To some extent, it seemed that those idiots who were fooled by this scheming lady could understand his current plight since at least on the surface, she indeed appeared as an innocent and pure lady that was like no other in this world.\u201cWill you give me the honor of appreciating these paintings together, Young Lady?\u201dWhen he noticed that the guest\u2019s attention had now solely focused on the two of them, he held out his hand in a respectful manner. Erna, who was just looking for a chance to escape a while ago, was startled to the point that her face paled from shock. Her lips looked exceptionally red and stood out more against her pale white skin.\u201cMe?\u201d Erna mouthed her question because she couldn\u2019t find her voice to reply, while he continued to stare at her with a calm smile.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d He took the lady\u2019s motionless hand and put it on his arm.\u2018Since you want to take advantage of me so much, you can use me now as much as you want. You wouldn\u2019t be able to find such a neat and fair transaction.\u2019Bjorn escorted Erna affectionately and proceeded to tour the gallery. Among the noisy spectators, Gladys was shocked to the point that she turned white like a ghost. She thought she must have looked just as nice as Bjorn and his partner when she still spent her days as the beloved Crown Princess of the Kingdom of Lechen.He found out later that the story about his affair had spread throughout the city before nighttime even arrived.It was said that Prince Bjorn was frolicking with another lady in front of Princess Gladys, who had come to Lechen to forgive her ex-husband and reunite with him. Additionally, the other lady was actually Erna Hardy, the very woman who was soon to be married off for the sake of money. Of course, no matter what speculations and accusations were thrown at him, he didn\u2019t care and completely ignored these rumors. No rumor was disturbing enough to faze him other than the talk of an apparent reunion with Gladys.Bjorn put strength into the hand that was holding Erna\u2019s arm that was resisting weakly. Suddenly, she raised her head and stared at him with her round blue eyes that were surrounded by long, dense eyelashes; her eyes reminded him of a doll. After staring at him with her beautiful eyes, she, however, bowed her head again after a while; as if she had come to the conclusion that there was no further harm that would be done to her.With her silent agreement, he led the stiff lady through the crowd with a slow pace to provide enough spectacle for the guests to gossip about.\u201dY-O-U! You bastard!\u201dTurning his head to the persistent gaze that followed them for quite a long time, Bjorn saw Peter, who was animatedly mouthing out swear words directed at him.\u201cHey! Are you going to do it too? Seriously?\u201d Peter asked in surprise with his gaze.Without hesitation, Bjorn raised his chin and looked down at the fussy lady beside him. Erna was walking while only looking forward, completely ignoring his existence. Her cheeks, as well as his earlobes and the corner of her eyes, were dyed red, just like a freshly ripened apple that was ready to be eaten.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cWho the hell is that lady?\u201d\u00a0Philip Dniester\u2019s face hardened with embarrassment as he asked his wife. In the end, he avoided the worst aftermath out of Bjorn and Gladys\u2019 relationship, but considering the rumors that were now spreading from the guest\u2019s mouth, it was hard to say that the current situation was very optimistic.\u201cIt\u2019s Erna Hardy, Father.\u201d Louise answered with a very angry face on behalf of the Queen.\u201cIt\u2019s the young daughter of Viscount Hardy, who used Older Brother Bjorn to attract other\u2019s attention at the Royal Ball.\u201d\u00a0The explanation that Louise added made the King\u2019s countenance even darker. The Queen, who had been quietly listening to the story between them, shifted her gaze towards the entrance of the hall where the two had disappeared.\u201cI thought that Bjorn would not be willing to accept Gladys\u2019 greeting, but I didn\u2019t expect it to end up this way. It is childish of him to just turn around and leave.\u201d\u201cMaybe he can be that shameless? It\u2019s just a handkerchief! Who else would fall for such an obvious, low-level trick other than Older Brother?\u201d\u201cMind your words, Louise. There are many ears around us at the moment.\u201d\u00a0Isabel Dniester reminded her agitated daughter with soft, powerful words. She wanted to say more, but Louise couldn\u2019t maintain her stubbornness and retreated in the end.\u201cI need to investigate more about that girl.\u201d After confirming that Louise had returned to her husband, Isabel Dniester lowered her voice and whispered.\u201cThat\u2019s obviously what we should do, right?\u201d She looked at her husband with a polite, gentle smile.The King, as expected, did not disagree with his wife\u2019s decision.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cPlease go back first, Your Highness\u201d\u00a0Erna barely opened her mouth after arriving at the last exhibition room. It was a pretty bold statement, as it was her first sentence that she willingly told him ever since they started walking together. In the end, she still uttered these words even when she found it difficult to talk to her current partner.Bjorn looked down at the petite lady, who had been looking at the painting in front of him just a while ago. Erna, on the other hand, was now staring back at him with her neck upright. Unlike those times when she ran away in fear, her eyes were firm and full of determination.\u201cNow that you have seen all the paintings, you should go back inside first, Your Highness. I will stay here a little longer.\u201d\u00a0As if concerned that he would not understand, she repeated her statement slowly once again.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u00a0The Grand Duke\u2019s gaze stopped at her blue eyes that strangely stimulated his nerves, his eyes traveled towards her chest then to the nape of her neck where blue blood vessels were reflected beneath her translucent pale skin. All this time, Erna did not avert her eyes and also maintained her gaze at him.\u201cAre there any paintings left for me to see alone?\u201d\u201cNo. I don\u2019t mean that.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cYou asked to see the paintings together. Now that we have seen all the paintings on display, I think my role is over.\u201d\u00a0Her tone was stiff as if trying to show her displeasure, but unfortunately, she didn\u2019t appear threatening to him at all.After taking a quick look at the onlookers who had been following them all the way here, Bjorn suddenly took a step closer toward his partner. Erna, who was startled by his sudden move, tried to back away quickly but his arm was a little faster than her and he managed to grab her before she could escape.\u201cStay here.\u201d He shook his head and whispered to her.\u201cThere are many eyes looking at us.\u201d He continued.Erna realized what he meant and followed his gaze, and soon became docile. From a distance, their interaction must have been quite affectionate and secretive like a pair of lovebirds.\u201cAre you angry?\u201d He whispered softly. If not for his mischievous expression, she would\u2019ve thought that he was concerned for her feelings.\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Erna also lowered her voice and replied. She was obviously lying and her cute frowning expression in an attempt to fool him made him laugh.\u201cReally? You look angry in my eyes though?\u201d\u201cI am not angry, Your Highness.\u201d She denied once again with her eyes tightly closed.\u00a0\u201cI also caused a lot of trouble to Your Highness at the royal ball, so I think today\u2019s incident has made up for that mistake.\u201d\u201cMistake? Made up?\u201d With narrowed eyes, he looked at the lady who acted as if she took care of his problems.\u201cI admit that I\u2019m angry because I have been troubled these days due to Miss Hardy\u2019s actions. So, you\u2019re telling me that you finally understand the consequences of your past actions?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cSince you felt that you have compensated me for what happened before, we are now even? What kind of calculation is that?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cYou are truly a very scheming lady.\u201d\u00a0Looking at Erna, who kept her mouth shut, Bjorn burst into laughter without realizing it. Even though this lady in front of him appeared timid, she had the guts to spit out what she wanted to say in the end.After all, this kind of person, they appeared docile but were actually beasts if you know them well enough.\u201cI accept. I guess it was a reasonable deal.\u201d He nodded and finally decided to let her go. He already got what he wanted, so at this point he wouldn\u2019t mind letting her get away for now. That was until he saw Erna\u2019s expression that blatantly showed her relief from finally escaping from his clutches.Bjorn, with irritation boiling inside his chest that came out of nowhere, suddenly snatched her little hand that was adorned with lace gloves. It was only after his lips had touched the back of her hand that Erna realized what had just happened.The silent exhibition room roared with exclamations from the guests, who pretended to appreciate the paintings while secretly watching them at the same time. The Grand Duke didn\u2019t pay attention to the commotion, and politely bent down once again and kissed the back of Erna\u2019s hand as if she were a princess.\u201cThen I look forward to seeing you once again, Ms. Hardy.\u201d\u00a0He finally left after leaving a sweet goodbye as if she was his lover. Seeing Erna\u2019s bright red face while staring at him in shock, his chest finally felt a lot lighter. Bjorn left the exhibition room without any regrets, and as expected, Peter and his companions were waiting for him in the hallway.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cWhat did you say to her? Are you planning to meet again?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not interested, my ass! And yet here you are getting the upper hand\u201d\u00a0Peter said mockingly while following behind Bjorn who\u00a0continued walking down the hallway slowly without saying a single word in reply.\u201cAre you really gonna join us? You have already stolen so much money from us, is it too much of a loss for you to let us win? Do you think that any reward will be wasted if it didn\u2019t end up in your hands?\u201d Leonard decided to also join the inquisition of the Grand Duke.\u201cHalf of that stake should have been mine in the end, right? It\u2019s the prize I would have won if you hadn\u2019t started this asshole bet.\u201dBjorn\u2019s reply surprised Leonard, because in the end, that would have been the likely scenario to happen if his stupid bet was not made.\u201cLook at this bastard. Those who have more in life are the scariest one in the end, what a bastard with a pure lust for money.\u201d Peter exclaimed and stuck out his tongue in amazement.\u201cTo seduce another woman in front of everyone because the stake is so precious, I guess if you want to be rich, you have to live such a life. By the way, what are you going to do now? Everyone must be cursing you to death I assume.\u201d Leonard asked.\u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d\u201cWhat about Ms. Hardy?\u201d\u201cDid you make such a bet because you were so worried about Erna Hardy?\u201dBjorn cut off his peer\u2019s petty sympathy with a remark laced with ridicule. The crowd of noble men, who were at a loss for words, averted their gazes. In the end, the silence between them did not last very long, thanks to the director of the Royal Academy of Arts who arrived just in time. Having found the Prince, the director hurriedly approached him and offered his greetings together with a young man on his side.\u201cThis is Pavel Lore, my pupil who won the first prize in this art exhibition. He is the most promising talent in the art academy, so I wanted to introduce him to His Highness the Grand Duke.\u201dThe head of the art center introduced his pupil with a smile full of pride. When the young man\u2019s eyes met the Grand Duke, he lowered his head once more, showing humility. The red-haired man had the impression that was closer to a soldier rather than an artist.Bjorn responded to their greetings with appropriate courtesy. After all, art is beyond his interest but he still needs to show his respect. It was not his forte to recognize who could be a talented painter that could lead the Kingdom\u2019s culture to the new era. However, if the price of their works soars, then that would be a different matter for him.He continued on his way, leaving the two people behind surrounded with brief silence. It was when he reached the end of the hallway that he finally remembered that it was not the first time he heard that young artist\u2019s name\u201cPavel\u2026\u201dBjorn, who stopped suddenly, called out the familiar name once again. It was the name that a certain familiar lady was calling out eagerly while wandering through the garden. Peter and his party, who had been following him while exchanging nonsensical jokes, stopped walking at the same time.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Is there anything wrong?\u201dLeonard curiously asked, but Bjorn ignored him and didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he turned his head and looked at the path they had just walked through. The Art Director and Pavel Lore had just entered the exhibition room at the end of the hallway, the same exhibition room where he left her behind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The eyes of the guests, who pretended to appreciate the paintings while secretly glancing at her, contained contemptuous curiosity that could not be hidden.Pavel, who just entered the hall, ended up stopping on his tracks when she saw the beautiful lady. He felt a strange sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and couldn\u2019t help but feel that she was someone familiar. A familiar long brunette hair, petite body, pale white skin, and clear blue eyes\u2026\u201cErna?\u201dEven when he carefully called out a certain name that was dear to him, Pavel wasn\u2019t ready to be convinced. In the end, the surprise he felt at the moment he made eye contact with the familiar lady who raised her head was even greater.\u201cPavel!\u201dA bright smile appeared on Erna\u2019s face as she looked at him incredulously. In an instant, the attention of every guest focused on them, but she did not seem to be conscious of it. He quickly asked for permission from the confused Director of the Arts Center, then hurriedly approached Erna and respectfully greeted her with courtesy befitting a young lady from a noble family.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Ms. Hardy.\u201dPavel sent a secret glance towards Erna, who had a puzzled expression on her face. There were currently too many eyes around them, there was no need to throw out further information about their relationship in this place.\u2018Shh\u2026\u2019To Erna, who was about to ask a question, he gave a short and decisive warning. She looked at him with narrowed eyes, and belatedly nodded with a small sigh after a while. Everyone\u2019s attention in this exhibition room was still focused on the two of them.\u201cAh\u2026 Yes. It\u2019s been a while indeed, Mr. Lore.\u201dShe sympathized with Pavel with her awkward acting. However, even at this awkward moment, his eyes were still full of joy that could not be hidden.\u2018\u00cd guess Pavel did the right thing..\u2019The obvious happiness that she and her friend shared from their unexpected reunion erased the displeasure in her heart that was left behind by that evil prince. All that\u2019s left now is Pavel and the joy of finally seeing an old friend after a long time. The relief and comfort that she felt after meeting her only friend made Erna suddenly realize the loneliness and apprehension she harbored ever since she came to this city.\u201cIt was nice to see you. I\u2019ll see you again.\u201dBefore turning around, Pavel quickly whispered a word of encouragement to her.\u201cI\u2019ll contact you.\u201dHe quickly added with a bright smile, it was the smile of her friend, Pavel Lore, that she remembered dearly. She pursed her lips to avoid carelessly uttering words that could be taken out of context, and responded with a small nod of her head instead.After sending a short smile once more, he returned to the elderly gentleman who was waiting for him. She later remembered that the man was the Director of the Art Institute who gave the speech at the opening ceremony. His face, which introduced Pavel to the nobility, showed a pride for his student that could not be hidden.With a smile, Erna quietly left the exhibition room. She admitted she was sad that their reunion was cut short, but she still thinks it was a good thing they met, especially when she remembered the promise that Pavel left behind. They will soon meet again, and there were many things that she wanted to say and share to her dear friend.With an upright posture that reflects her current joyful mood, she began to leave the exhibition room with a much lighter step. The regular sound of footsteps resounded through the hallway which was lit by the languid sunlight, she made her way towards the stairs. However, this blissful moment ended abruptly when the memories of His Highness came to her mind like a raging flood.His golden hair that resembled the afternoon sunlight and subtle gray eyes suddenly came to her mind. During that unforgettable moment when he kissed the back of her hand, the man\u2019s gray eyes gazed directly at her.In the end, he insulted her with such an elegant and polite gesture and without any remorse, she treated her as a substitute for the Princess.Erna, with a frown on her forehead, wiped the back of her hand where the prince\u2019s lips had touched, as if erasing that memory. Even though she was wearing gloves, the strange and unpleasant sensation of his lips touching her hand remained on her mind. In the end, she even used a handkerchief to scrub the back of her hand thoroughly. It was just a simple gesture, but her cheeks couldn\u2019t stop burning from shame and anger. If only she could, she would have completely wiped away those unpleasant memories from her head.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for this stupid handkerchief!\u2019Resentment for the handkerchief that was returned by the Prince surged inside her chest, but it didn\u2019t last long since it was a gift from her grandmother on her birthday last year. In consideration to the sincerity of her grandmother who embroidered the flowers and initials of her name, she couldn\u2019t truly hate this handkerchief in the end even when that cursed Prince touched it.Erna, with a neatly folded handkerchief, started going down the stairs at a slow pace; both cheeks were still tinged with red.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Days had passed after the art exhibit ended, but the shameful memories that the Prince left behind came frequently and tormented Erna. It always appeared on her mind without regard to the situation; when the sun was shining, when she saw her face in the mirror, or even when she sneezed just like now.\u201cAh\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dShe let out a light sigh as she looked down at the ink stains made by the pen she had dropped. Lisa, who witnessed what happened, got up and opened the window of the bedroom. As the gentle summer night\u2019s wind blew, the thick scent of flowers that filled the room was lessened to an extent.\u201cOh my, how absurd this is. Those noblemen must have picked up all the flowers in Schuber and gave all of them to my Lady.\u201dLisa clicked her tongue and looked at the amazing scenery of her lady\u2019s bedroom.Various bouquets of flowers with letters of courtship were everywhere, mostly because her weak-minded lady couldn\u2019t afford to throw away those innocent flowers. Additionally, Lady Erna made an effort to send replies of refusal to every pathetic letter. This was the reason why her master, who would always go to bed early unless she was dragged to attend a party, was often awake until late at night these past days.\u201cI will write a new one.\u201dErna removed the stained letter and set it down on the reading table. Lisa, who watched the young lady write a sincere reply of refusal again and again, let out another deep sigh.\u201cAren\u2019t these prodigal sons illiterate? Why are they so tenacious and persistent even after being rejected?\u201d Lisa openly grumbled with an upset mood. Erna, on the other hand, carefully pressed down the written letter using a blotter paper with a small smile on her face.It seemed that Lady Erna was the only woman under the sky of Lechen who would make such an effort to carefully write a rejection letter. She tried to persuade her that it was not necessary, but the young lady stubbornly insisted.\u2018Even if you rejected their courtship, a proper lady still needs to do so with dignity and courtesy befitting a true noble.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0Erna spoke such words like an old woman who was from the last century. Lisa found such Lady Erna quite lovely at these times, but she couldn\u2019t help but also find her stubbornness frustrating; which further made her poor self upset.\u201cThat is the last one for today!\u201d When Erna picked up a new set of stationery, Lisa finally declared with a smirk.\u201cIs it going to be a big deal if those stubborn fools got the replies a bit late? It is already the time for you to take a rest, Miss.\u201d While her lady hesitated, Lisa quickly put away the stationery and inkwell.Erna, who decided to accept the will of her maid, got up and headed to the bathroom. After meticulously washing her ink-stained hands, she returned to her room as Lisa approached her with a comb in her hands. It was still awkward and uncomfortable to entrust these matters to others, but Erna meekly sat in front of the dressing table.Lisa removed the shawl the young lady was wearing over her pajamas and began to comb her hair carefully. The maid then looked through the mirror with a proud smile on her face, the grim expression on her face whenever she was rejected for what she was trying to do was nowhere to be seen. Erna\u2019s shyness in this unfamiliar situation disappeared and was replaced with the relief her maid gave her.\u201cStarting tomorrow, please leave the bath towels to me.\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d At Lisa\u2019s words that she said with a hum, Erna exclaimed with apprehension.\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me? Even though it\u2019s my first time handling such duties, I believe that I can still do it properly. Please believe in me, Miss.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Lisa. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust you\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d Erna looked at Lisa reflected in the mirror with perplexed eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s that\u2026I\u2019m ashamed.\u201d\u201cAll the girls from other noble families are taken care of this way by their maids. The same applies to the house of Viscount Hardy of course.\u201dLisa\u2019s eyes widened as if she couldn\u2019t believe her lady\u2019s concern. Erna, a little embarrassed, gently lowered her eyes and avoided her maid\u2019s gaze while stroking the back of her hand. Lisa, on the other hand, started brushing her hair once again.\u201cPlease let me make your life here a bit more comfortable, my Lady.\u201dThe sound of her hair sliding through the dense tooth of the comb and Lisa\u2019s friendly voice permeated her silent bedroom.\u201cBesides, what is there to be ashamed of? If I had been as pretty as my Lady, I would have been able to dance naked on Tara Boulevard!\u201dLisa, who threw a mischievous joke, burst into laughter. Erna, however, let out a startled yelp and held the front of her pajamas tightly as if protecting her body. The jokes of the young people in the big city were so provocative that they sometimes made her dizzy from shame.\u201cU-uhm\u2026 Lisa?\u201d Erna, who had barely regained her composure, carefully raised her head to meet her maid\u2019s eyes in the mirror.\u201cDid you have any other letters?\u201d\u201cOther letters? Oh, you mean from Mr. Pavel Lore?\u201d Lisa, who had been listening to the same question for several days, understood Erna\u2019s meaning at once.\u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s still nothing, Miss. Seeing you waiting like this, it must be a very important letter, right?\u201d\u201cNot really\u2026 It\u2019s not like that.\u201d Erna smiled awkwardly and shook her head. Fortunately, Lisa didn\u2019t ask any further questions.Lisa finally left after she finished all her work, and now, only her lone self and various flowers were left in the bedroom.\u2018It\u2019s already been four days. Did something happen to Pavel?\u2019Erna, who had been anxiously wandering around the room, did not get in bed until midnight. As she gazed at the curtains swaying in the night breeze that blew through the slightly opened window accompanied by the strong scent of flowers, she finally gradually felt sleepy.She fell asleep while stroking the back of her hand, as if trying to soothe her troubled heart.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*A lively bachelor party at a noble\u2019s club ended naturally, as the participants lost their consciousness one by one due to too much alcohol. Even the main character of the party, who was struggling to keep himself upright, ended up collapsing on the table. In the end, only Bjorn was left.\u201cHey, Groom!\u201dWith the hand that just put down a glass of wine, Bjorn hit the forehead of the groom who had fallen down in a very funny way. The force of his hit rang out quite loudly, but the victim still showed no sign of waking up.\u201cI won. Yes?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 I don\u2019t know. Just take it.\u201dRaising his eyelids with difficulty, the drunk groom mumbled in an indistinct voice.Bjorn groaned and got up. He wasn\u2019t in good shape because he was also quite drunk, but it wasn\u2019t enough for him to join the ugly crowd that was scattered around. With his dry mouth moistened with cold water, he picked up his loot lying in the center of the table and turned around.It was the tradition at every bachelor party called \u2018Stag Night\u2019; the last conscious survivor would receive a golden trophy in the shape of an antler. Bjorn couldn\u2019t remember how many stag antlers he now had in his home.The funny thing was that he even got the trophy at his own bachelor party. He wanted to throw it away because it was a very unfortunate trophy, but it was a piece meticulously made by a skilled craftsman from the same workshop, so it was such a waste to throw it away. Thanks to that, the antlers that survived till this day must have been buried somewhere as a decoration in the Schuber Palace.He staggered across Tara Boulevard as he left the club full of ugly guests that were either weeping out of the blue or toppling down over and over again. He could have ordered a carriage to bring him home, but it was still too early for the coachman to drive the carriage when dawn hadn\u2019t even arrived yet.Checking the clock tower standing in the square, Bjorn sat down on the edge of the fountain as if his tired body finally collapsed from intoxication.The starlight twinkling beyond the fading darkness was clearly reflected in his muddy eyes.It was the last memory left in his mind before he finally lost his consciousness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna, who fell asleep only late at night, woke up much earlier than usual because of a nightmare that haunted her dreams. She couldn\u2019t remember what the dream was about when she woke up, but the memory of being chased by something and the fear she felt still remained clear in her heart.\u2018A very large beast must have been chasing me\u2026\u2019She stared blankly into the air and pondered about her strange dream. In the end, she quickly got up and sat on her bed. Turning the lamp on the bedside table, the warm light diluted the darkness helping her see the table clock that showed that it was still less than four o\u2019clock. Staring blankly at nothing for a while, Erna gave up on going back to sleep and decided to get out of bed. After getting dressed and tidying up the bed, the dawn began to arrive gradually.She stood in front of the window and looked down at the neatly partitioned garden. A rural field, which was supposed to be dyed red with poppies in full bloom at this time of year in the past, emerged above the former flower field. It suddenly felt strange to her that the water lily pond and the orchard beyond were now full of tall stone buildings. Frequent moments of blankly reminiscing about Buford occurred to her lately, probably because of the familiarity brought about by her encounter with Pavel.Erna stood in front of the window for quite some time and turned around as if trying to control her weakening heart. Normally, she would have spent her time making flowers while waiting for the other residents of the mansion to wake up, but today, she barely had that kind of motivation. Suddenly, the thought of going for a walk appeared on her mind as the pale morning light seeped through the gaps in the curtains.Finally deciding on what she wanted to do, she began to move diligently; she braided her long hair, put on a bonnet, and brought out her gloves. Normally, she would have chosen her lace gloves that were adorned with beads on the wrists area, but today, she decided to wear something different and opted for a pair of plain gloves. Staring at the gloves on her hand, the memory of a certain prince who had done a terrible thing to her most cherished gloves appeared in her mind, making her feel resentful once again. With her hand that was clad in unadorned gloves, she habitually rubbed the back of her hand.Erna made a rational conclusion that today\u2019s flower quota should be reduced a little.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna, who finally finished her preparations after attaching a large flower pin to her shawl, sneaked out of the bedroom quietly. The Viscount said it would be unwise for a noble lady to walk outside the house without a maid, but she felt that it was still too early to wake Lisa up. She had already mastered the geography of this area after staying here for so long, she believed that she could now take a walk by herself.Successfully escaping from the Hardy Mansion without waking anyone up, Erna looked up at the starry morning sky while catching her breath. The street was still dark, but not as scary as she thought and she even felt more comfortable now than in the middle of the day which was full of passersby. Additionally, she had more freedom to see her surroundings because there were no gazes staring at her.With thoughts of sending a letter to Pavel, she slowly started walking down through Tara Avenue. There was an address written in his letter that she had brought from Buford, so she thought that it would be ok to visit him in person.\u2018Wouldn\u2019t that get Pavel in trouble?\u2019When she remembered her only friend, who kept his distance while being conscious of people\u2019s gaze for her sake, her troubled heart felt relieved somehow. It was then that she suddenly became aware of a bum lying down the street.Erna, who had unintentionally turned her gaze toward the clock tower, let out a small scream and stepped back from shock. In the distance, she could see a man lying on the railing of the large fountain at the center of the square.Turning her head away from the sight, she decided to get away as quickly as possible. However, she suddenly felt an ominous feeling and decided to turn around. The man, who was completely lying down as if dead, had his arms drooped under the railing. It was really obvious that the strange man was absolutely unconscious.She looked around the empty square, and began to approach the fountain cautiously; she could now see him better with their distance shortened. He was a tall man with a head full of blonde hair with his arms mostly covering his face, which made her unable to completely see his features. Additionally, she could see a strange-looking golden object rolling around at his feet.In a crime novel published in the newspaper Lisa brought to her a while ago, Erna had seen a sentence describing a similar scene. It was a novel about a detective who checks the body of a man who died after being attacked by a monster in the middle of the night.Was this man attacked by a monster?Frightened by her thoughts, she hurriedly ran to the vagrant.\u201cHey, are you okay? Can you hear me?\u201d Standing a step away from the man, she asked nervously. The man, however, didn\u2019t even move.\u201cAre you sick? Are you hurt? Should I call the police?\u201d When she finally took the one last step towards him, the man lowered the arm that was covering his face.Fortunately, he didn\u2019t seem to be dead, making Erna sighed from relief. However, she quickly regretted her choice which was swept away by unnecessary worries and sympathy when she met the man\u2019s gaze that was now staring at her. The unconscious vagrant lying down was the very man he never wanted to meet, Prince Bjorn.Erna hurriedly backed away, but Bjorn\u2019s movements of grabbing her wrist were a little faster as usual.\u201cErna Hardy?\u201d He sighed and slowly called her name. Only then did she understand why the prince was lying in the square like this, a strong smell of alcohol that could give her a headache was wafting from his body. Just smelling it was enough to make her intoxicated.\u201cWhy is Miss Hardy here?\u201d he asked, groaning while still holding Erna\u2019s wrist.\u201cPut my hand down! Or else I will scream!\u201d\u201cI asked you why you are here.\u201d As she struggled to pull her wrist out, his grip only grew stronger.\u201cThis is the square, not the Prince\u2019s estate. I could go anywhere I want!\u201d\u201c\u2026I guess that makes sense.\u201dHe nodded while slowly getting up to sit down on the ledge of the fountain. When he saw her bright red face standing in front of him, he unexpectedly burst out laughing. The stars shone above his head when his consciousness clouded, and now Erna Hardy was here in front of him.For a while, he thought that he was just hallucinating. With the time so early that the sun was still rising up and in a place outside like here, it was impossible to meet Lady Hardy. However, the Erna in front of him was definitely the real Erna, and he suddenly felt the situation unbearably funny.\u201cLet me go!\u201d As he struggled to regain consciousness, she roared once more.\u201cIf you need help, I will call someone. So please, let go of my hand\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, Miss Hardy. Do you really want to sell yourself to me?\u201d Bjorn, who was exhaling slowly with his head bowed down, asked in a low-pitched voice.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 I beg your pardon?\u201d Erna, who had been fussing while waving her arms, became calm at the moment she heard his question.When the lady who asked him with an innocent face came into his view, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. It was because the lady, who talked about making a reasonable deal with him a few days ago, was now chasing after his back.\u201cAre you going to visit your lover even after the rumors about us spread throughout the kingdom? It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand you, but isn\u2019t it too blatant of you to do something shameless like this so early in the morning. What do you think, Ms. Hardy?\u201d\u201cI understand, this conversation is just plain rude and unpleasant. Please let me go now.\u201d\u201cIf you want to make a deal with me, you have to bargain first, you know.\u201d He staggered and stood up to face her.\u201cHow much?\u201dWith his eyes closed, he softly asked. His gray eyes, that were unusually clear despite him being drunk, gleamed in the faintly bright dawn light.\u201cLet, go.. me\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d She couldn\u2019t speak properly and only let out a moan-like sigh. Meanwhile, he took one step closer towards her.\u201cTell me how much it is.\u201dFor the first time, she realized that all senses could be paralyzed due to too much anger thanks to the prince\u2019s insults. She should have poured out some curse words, but no voice came out of her throat as her mind went blank and the pain in her wrist slowly faded away.\u201cI don\u2019t want to have this insulting conversation with you anymore. Please stop.\u201dErna barely managed to speak after a while. Bjorn, who was gazing at the distant sky, slowly lowered his gaze and met with her gaze once again, his eyes held an indifferent look.\u201cSo what if you don\u2019t like my words?\u201d\u201cYou should know when enough is enough. Aren\u2019t you being too rude?\u201d She screamed in a rage.\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me you know how not to cross the line?\u201dHe calmly asked her with his lips in an obvious smirk. For a moment, the words she wanted to say got stuck at her throat, making her unable to answer his question.How could such a messy prodigal son become the crown prince of this country at one point!?She was shocked by that fact to the point of making her dizzy. Meanwhile, Bjorn, who wanted to say something again, slowly closed his eyes. When Erna felt something strange, it was only after his already staggering body had tilted sideways.Surprised by the sudden turn of events, she instinctively supported him but it was impossible for her to endure the large frame of a drunken man with her petite body. Their bodies were tangled together and rolled on the floor of the square at the same time.Half conscious due to the fall, Erna realized that she was now lying on the cold stone floor only after the bright dawn sky came into her eyes. Additionally, the cursed prince was lying on top of her. The breath he exhaled tickled her neck and his tight body was very hot and rigid, making her feel threatened.\u201cSa-, please save me! Help me!\u201dBarely coming to her senses, she screamed with all her might and started to struggle. However, no matter how much he pushed, the unconscious Grand Duke wouldn\u2019t even budge just a bit. Suddenly, the sound of footsteps approaching from afar could be heard.\u201cGo away! Let go!\u201dErna slapped the prince\u2019s shoulder and back with her clenched fist but Bjorn, who wanted to open his eyes for a moment, lowered his head once again. Even in the midst of this unfortunate incident, the prince did not let go of her wrist and as his hot, soft lips brushed the nape of her neck, her face crumpled slowly as if she was going to burst into tears soon. Meanwhile, the footsteps of the approaching people became more and more clear.She turned her head in fear, trying to find anything to help her out of this predicament. Picking up the golden object that had fallen near was an instinctive choice, as there was no rational judgment left in her head other than the desperate feeling that she had to do something.\u201cLet go of me! Please let go!\u201dShe struggled as she swung the trophy she was now holding. Her desperate movements pushed the hem of the dress up to her knees, but she didn\u2019t have the energy to worry about it for now.\u201cHelp me!\u201dWith a scream that grew sharper, Erna started slamming Bjorn\u2019s back with the trophy without mercy. At the same time that Bjorn opened his eyes to the pain that had grown to overcome his drunkenness, the sound of footsteps from those who approached where they were suddenly stopped.\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Surprised by the absurd sight, the Grand Duke\u2019s driver and attendant shouted.With a frown on his face, the Grand Duke let out a groan and turned around. As he flopped down on the ground, Erna could finally stand up while tightly holding his trophy she used to beat him in her hand. Seeing her current state with barely focused eyes, a new smile spilled from Bjorn\u2019s lips.Erna, who refused the help of the attendant, took a breath and stepped back. Tears seemed to fill her eyes, but she did not cry since crying was something she was fed up with. Instead, she shot a gaze filled with hatred back at himWhile the coachman and the attendant raised his tired body upright, Erna quickly turned around and started to run away from him once again. The sound of her heels from her frantic running echoed throughout the stillness of dawn.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 \u2026 A- Are you okay, Your Highness?\u201dThe attendant, who was looking at him with a strange gaze, asked stammeringly.Bjorn, however, closed his eyes slowly without answering. When he opened his eyes again, Erna had already gone to the other side of the square, the ribbon tied to the end of her braided hair fluttered as if it was a pair of wings trying to lift her petite body.The last thing he saw before losing consciousness again was the golden antler still in Erna Hardy\u2019s grasp.His bounty gleamed beautifully in the bright morning sun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Pavel\u2019s letter, which Erna had been looking forward to for the past days, finally arrived on the third day of her long wait. Thankfully, Viscount Hardy and his wife were currently not in the mansion.Lisa had received the letter from the hand of the messenger boy instead of a postman and hurriedly ran upstairs when she saw who it was from. However, she received no answer even after knocking at the door repeatedly, so she had no choice but to open the door slightly. Erna, who was sitting in front of the desk obviously distracted, stood up in shock by the sudden noise of her door opening. The artificial rose, which she had been holding on to since morning, was still left unfinished. It wasn\u2019t like her, who had already committed the procedure of making flowers by heart that she could do it with her eyes closed, to be unable to finish even a single flower.\u201cThe letter you have been waiting for has finally arrived! It\u2019s a letter from Mr. Pavel Lore.\u201dLisa put the letter directly into the hand of the young lady, who trudged like a child caught doing something bad while avoiding the other party\u2019s gaze. At the moment she heard her maid\u2019s words, Erna immediately regained her bright smile.\u201cYou have to reply now, Miss.\u201dAt Lisa\u2019s urging, her eyes widened.\u201cRight now?\u201d\u201cYes. The messenger who brought this letter is waiting in the backyard. He relayed that Mr. Lore\u00a0 wanted to get a reply from you right away.\u201dTroubled by her maid\u2019s unexpected words, Erna looked at the letter in her hand once again; which contained an invitation from Pavel to take a walk along the riverside together this evening.She quickly sat down at her desk and decided to write down her reply. In a rush, a few drops of ink ended up dripping in the paper but there was no time for her to get a new clean paper and write her reply from the start again.Soon, Lisa received a letter in which the wax had not yet hardened, but now was not the time to dilly-dally as she left the bedroom in a hurry. After the sound of her footsteps drifted away across the hallway, Erna finally let out a breath she didn\u2019t realize she had held back.\u2018I will finally meet Pavel this evening.\u2019As soon as she thought of finally meeting up with her only friend, a feeling of unfairness and dismay came crashing down in her heart.She couldn\u2019t openly tell anyone what happened between her and the prince, even Pavel. It was because what happened was so absurd, she was afraid that if just a small part of the whole situation came about might cause a misunderstanding right away. Not only did he hold her wrist, her petite body even ended up getting trapped under the body of the man she detested. What was even worse was that his lips touched the nape of her neck during the traumatic event. Such an immoral thing would have made her Grandma faint in shock if she ever knew of what had happened.Erna once again touched the nape of her neck, which now had red marks from her rubbing it habitually for the past days. The more she tried to erase that cursed memory, the clearer she remembered the events that had transpired yesterday.His irregular breathing..the feeling of his hot and moist breath against her skin\u2026and the weight of his large and firm body that made her feel intimidated.She could recall all of these as clearly as if she was experiencing them now.\u201cHe\u2019s a poisonous mushroom.\u201dRecalling Lisa\u2019s warning, she breathed out a small sigh of annoyance. Pretty and colorful poisonous mushrooms, she would often see them while taking in the forest of Buford, and now, their images were superimposed on that ugly man\u2019s face.\u201cI guess he is indeed a poisonous mushroom.\u201dAs if erasing the memory of a certain huge poisonous mushroom, Erna tightly closed her eyes.\u2018I hope dinner will arrive soon. Let\u2019s meet Pavel so I can finally open up my troubled heart and feel refreshed.\u2019*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cIsn\u2019t it better to call the attending physician?\u201d The butler\u2019s gaze, which was examining Bjorn\u2019s naked back, clearly showed deep concern.In the last three days after the incident, the Grand Duke wore his shirt casually. Every time he locked a button, a small sigh accompanied by a smirk would appear on his face. He had the same reaction just like the moment he had first seen his bruised back after he recovered from his drunken state.The memory of the incident remained hazy, but he must have been hit very hard for him to have received such injuries. For the first time in his life, he was beaten to the point of bruising and for him, such a rare occasion was certainly quite monumental.\u2018And they said she looked harmless like a little deer?\u2019As various \u201cpraises\u201d for Erna\u2019s prowess came to his mind, laughter escaped from Bjorn\u2019s lips and he slowly began to laugh aloud. The fact that he was the only one who knew the reality of how beastly she could be once cornered suddenly made him feel regretful.\u2018I guess she is not only a beast but also a thief. And a very robust thief at that.\u2019He fastened the last button on his shirt while recalling his golden trophy gleaming beautifully while being held in her hands. Butler Greg, who stood beside him, handed over the tie he was holding on the tray with an agile motion without any wasted movement.\u201cIf you find bringing the doctor is burdensome, then at least a treatment\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dBjorn turned around while tying a knot in his tie.\u201cIt\u2019s not such a big deal, I\u2019ve only been hit this much.\u201d\u201cAre you really alright? Who dares to do such a thing, Your Highness?\u201d Greg\u2019s eyes widened\u00a0 in disbelief as if they were about to pop out.\u201cI have a pet, you see\u2026\u201d Bjorn casually picked up the jacket.\u201c\u2026 and it\u2019s such a vicious beast too.\u201dHe continued with a bright smile as he wore his jacket, then walked out of the dressing room with wide and energetic steps. Mrs. Fitz approached quickly as if waiting for him. Additionally, she silently sent a signal to Greg, who was following behind him.\u201cI heard that you got hurt\u2026 \u2026 \u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d He reassured her with the same smile he had given to the other servants. Mrs. Fitz,on the other hand, had a butler-like expression on her face as she expressed her fuss and concern.\u201cIf my life was really in danger, the first thing I would do is to ask our Mrs. Fitz for help.\u201d\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Even when the stoic head maid stood in front of him with a strict expression on her face, he just continued to smirked without raising an eyebrow.In the end, Mrs. Fitz could only sigh and decided to step back. She knew from her many years of experience that any further nagging would only be meaningless.Clearing out her exasperated expression, she continued to follow Bjorn and began to report the various work of the Grand Duke that needed to be dealt with within today. This continued until they had finally arrived inside the library.\u201cAnd finally, I think you should reply to the invitation from Harbor St.\u201d Mrs. Fitz, who had always maintained her composure, added in a perplexed tone. The Grand Duke, who had just taken his seat, raised his narrowed eyes to meet her gaze.\u201cHarbor St.? Do you mean my great aunt ?\u201d TN: sister of his grandmother\u201cYes, Your Highness. The party hosted by Marchioness Harbor will be held in two days. I think you will have to decide whether or not to attend by today at the latest.\u201d\u201cOh, right. The season has come for my aunt to show off her personal connections.\u201d He nodded in understanding and picked up the papers lying on the desk.The party of Marchioness Harbor, who boasts a wide network, was very famous among the nobles for its grand scale. It would not be an exaggeration to say that it was a place where all two-legged socialites gather.\u201cThen I will send a letter to reject their invitation.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid that couldn\u2019t be done.\u201d Bjorn, who had been scanning the report on his last investment case, raised his head once again when he heard her rebuttal.\u201cSure, I will participate then.\u201d Mrs. Fitz\u2019s eyes widened in surprise at his unexpected answer that came out of nowhere.\u201cBut Prince, as you know, Marchioness Harbor\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cI know. Princess Gladys must have received an invitation too.\u201dA raucous party with various infamous individuals and the assorted events that would result from it were the greatest pleasures of old age for Marchioness Harbor. There was no way she could miss the former crown prince and his ex-wife, who were the most important and prominent interest in the social circle. Furthermore, he bet that Erna Hardy would be there too. That old woman would be sad if the second most prominent figure in today\u2019s social circle would not attend her beloved party.\u201cIf I have to say one thing, there are many mouths out there who want to speak maliciously about Princess Gladys and Your Highness.\u201d Mrs.Fitz reminded with a worried expression on her face.\u201cEveryone is looking forward to it, can\u2019t I do at least one good thing for their enthusiasm?\u201d He nodded casually as he opened the lid of the fountain pen placed on the pen tray.\u201cI\u2019m going to give my aunt and grandmother great pleasure for the rest of their lives. Ah, of course, since they already have a chronic disease, I have to provide them entertainment that wouldn\u2019t put too much strain in their heart.\u201d\u201cYou Highness!\u201d\u201cI guess even if Marchioness Harbor suddenly dies and goes to hell, she will have a party with Satan in the end, won\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cEither way, it would still be hell even for the Marchioness.\u201d\u201cMy aunt and grandmother cannot live in heaven. A hell full of troublesome bastards is indeed a paradise for them to be honest \u201dBjorn smiled as he signed the bottom of the report in his hands. The numbers on the papers were satisfactory, and so was the party of his aunt and grandmother, who would provide him an easy way to catch a sneaky thief.\u201cI will do as you command.\u201d Exasperated with his antics, Mrs. Fitz could only obey his order.Finally finished with the conversation and his work, he decided to smoke a cigar and approached the window of the study. He could still hear the cheers of the crowd practicing rowing every day from the nearby Arbit River.\u201cCrazy bastards.\u201d As he let out a long stream of cigarette smoke, he spit out swear words like a whisper.In the midst of savage shouts, sunlight, and the humid wind, Bjorn reminisced about his debt relationship with a certain lady. In the end, he could only take it slowly as he decided which method would give him the most satisfactory result.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Pavel arrived at the Grand Duke\u2019s Bridge earlier than the promised time.Situated on the lower reaches of the Arbit River, this bridge was famous for its golden statues adorning the railings and the delicate and colorful street lamps. It was built to commemorate the victory of Philip II, so it was given the same name. However, most people just called it the Grand Duke\u2019s Bridge for the simple reason that it was the bridge that connected the city center to the Schuber Palace, which was the residence of the Grand Duke.Pavel leaned against the railing and looked at the other side of the road where Erna would soon appear. Except for events at the Schuber Palace, the road was mostly empty because the area was sparsely populated. That was the main reason why he chose this place as the meeting place.It was about a week before the opening ceremony of the art exhibition that he had heard that Erna came to Schuber to live with her father. And then just after a few days, Erna Hardy had become the hottest topic in the social circle together with the former Crown Prince and his ex-wife these\u00a0 past days.The rumors about his dear friend that he heard through his friends from the upper class were all maliciously perverted, and she was also known as a snobbish lady who was clueless regarding the marriage business. There seemed to be no reputation more incompatible with Erna than that, considering their friendship for all these years. That was the reason why he suddenly changed his mind and decided to visit her right away.Pavel, who had indirectly encountered the social world during his stay in the capital, already knew what it was like. It was no exaggeration to say that it was a place where reputation could dictate your life, and it could end it as well. Even if the two of them were close friends in Buford, here in the capital, they were undeniably a noblewoman and a painter in the eyes of others. The fact that their relationship can cause a big scandal just by being intimate with each other must have been the reason why Erna didn\u2019t announce her connection to him.So he tried his best to keep in touch with her at the right time, but he never thought that they would suddenly encounter each other at the art exhibition just like that. It was also shocking to learn that, after only a year of not seeing her, the petite-looking country girl had turned into a perfect lady.\u201cPavel!\u201dPavel, who was gazing at the clear summer sky without a single cloud, looked down at the familiar voice he heard from afar. There, he saw the very face\u00a0 that he was looking forward to meeting once again. Erna, with a bright smile on her face, waved her arm excitedly while staring at him. A girl, who was probably a maid, accompanied her.As he watched her approach at a slow pace, he couldn\u2019t help laughing out loud at the sight he saw. Where did the perfect lady he had seen on that day go? The Erna in front of him had returned to the country girl that he knew really well. Donning a flowing floral dress, a hat full of ribbons and flower decorations, and even her fresh smile with a bit of shyness; the lady in front of him was undoubtedly the Lady of the Baden family, his friend Erna.The two, who were approaching each other, stopped on their tracks at the same time, leaving a gap of about a step between them. In the end, it was Erna who reached out her hand first.\u201cShould I call you Mr. Lore today?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head and grabbed her extended hand.\u201cToday, call me Pavel.\u201d\u201cMy friend Pavel?\u201dStaring at her who naughtily asked him again and again, Pavel happily nodded his head.Erna\u2019s smiling face was as bright as sunlight and a smile resembling hers suddenly appeared on the corner of his lips as he continued to gaze at her contagious smile.It was the first time after years without seeing each other, he could finally meet his dear friend once again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI think my father wants to marry me off.\u201d Erna said. She was walking along the river bank with Pavel, who looked at her sidelong as she spoke. \u201cHe thinks its what parents should do, though, I have no intention of doing that.\u201dPavel stopped on the track and let out a soft sigh. Erna turned to face him with a look of innocence. Pavel half thought Erna put on the look on purpose, to guilt people into being on her side. Her eyes sparkled like a pool reflecting the afternoon sun.It was clear to Pavel that Viscount Hardy wanted to marry his daughter he had only got as a bargain for buying the Baden family house. If you looked only a little closely at the behaviour of this man, it was pretty clear.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you move back to Baden Street?\u201d Pavel said.Pavel wanted to tell Erna that Viscount Hardy had no interest in being her father and was looking for a way to get rid of her. He wanted to give her a warning, but didn\u2019t know how to say it without hurting her feelings.\u201cI want to, but I promised I\u2019d stay in Schuber for another year. Once that is done, of course I will move back to Baden Street.\u201d Erna said.\u201cI\u2019m sure your father has a different plan.\u201d Pavel said.\u201cEven so, I may have gotten help from my father, but my only true family is my grandmother.\u201d Erna said.Contrary to the soft smile Erna showed on the outside, on the inside she was steadfast and stubborn. She may look infinitely fragile, but that only hid the deep strength of her will.What am I going to do with this kid?\u00a0Pavel thought.No\u00a0 matter how much he dwelled on this girl, he could never find a solution. Even if Erna returned to Buford, Viscount Hardy was not going to let her go. He may not want her as a daughter, but that did not mean he was going to let her run off to the other side of the country, if it meant he could fetch a high price for selling her to what ever person offered the highest price for her hand.There was nothing he could do right now and it left him feeling utterly powerless.\u201cYou want to go back to Buford, again?\u201d Erna asked.Pavel had not been back to Buford in quite some time. He used to go back at least once a month, to help his father at the lumber mill.\u201cYou\u2019re constantly going in and out of Baden House.\u201d\u00a0Pavel\u2019s father had said. \u201cYou need to stop, neither you nor that Erna girl are children any more and if you want to take you\u2019re career as a painter seriously, you need to strike out into the world and stop wasting time in this village.\u201dPavel couldn\u2019t believe his father would say something so absurd, but there was concern in his eyes, as he smoked his pipe and considered the clouds drifting by. After that rough advice, Pavel did indeed strike out into the world and had not returned to Buford or Baden House since.He was not upset by the advice his father gave, even if it was given in bad taste. Pavel pretty much shared the same thoughtsHe was young, but he was not stupid. Erna was like a sister to him, but he knew that outsiders would look upon their friendship with suspicion, a lumberjacks son and the daughter of a failed aristocrat. Rumours spread like wild fire and so, Pavel decided it was time to put some distance between him and her.To keep that promise to himself, and by extension his father, Pavel had not returned to Buford in over a year. Even the letters between him and Erna had dwindled down to nothing. He thought there friendship had reached its natural end. He never dreamed that he would face Erna again, like this.\u201cErna, if you ever need help, just let me know.\u201d Pavel said, avoiding Erna\u2019s question.\u201cYes, thank you Pavel.\u201d Erna said.Erna smiled brightly up at Pavel and turned to continue the walk along the bank. The wind buffeted the tassels of her parasol as she went. The flowers and ribbons of her wide brimmed hat bobbed as she walked. The lace of her loose dress swayed in such a manner that Pavel thought she was a giant flower herself. His pulse skipped a beat without warning and he gasped.He bit down the feeling and buried it deep within himself, he could not allow himself to fall for the girl he considered a sister, if not a close friend. That would be a breach of her trust, of their confidence.Erna turned on him and looked into his eyes with a playful grin. Pavel could feel sweat beginning to form under his arms and his mind swam as he looked deep into those pools of reflected light.\u201cDo you think there is a way that I could sell corsages of artificial flowers?\u201d Erna said.Pavel was so taken aback by the seemingly random question, he summered and grasped at ideas in his mind, that melted away like smoke.\u201cCorsages?\u201d Was all he managed.No matter how far the Hardy family had fallen on the social ladder, there is no way anyone introduced to the higher tiers would be able to get away with something as simple as selling corsages. There wouldn\u2019t be nearly enough profit in it to make any notable difference.Erna simply looked at him, with that warming smile, waiting for his response. Pavel suddenly felt like a new born buck trying to stand for the first time.\u201cI, er, I can find out.\u201d Pavel nodded his head coolly.It was not difficult to understand what situation the Hardy family would have found themselves in, if not for the small amount of money Erna made selling artificial flowers, so he could understand her desire to branch out and do something more.\u201cI once sold paintings to the owner of Soldau Department Store. I can ask there. It would be a start.\u201d Pavel said, when it was clear that Erna was waiting for a more concrete answer.\u201cDepartment store?\u201d Erna moved the words around her mouth, trying them on for size. \u201cThanks, thank you so much, Pavel.\u201d Erna said. Her smile quickly became a laughed.Pavel watched Erna bounce along the path as they continued their walk. Erna was still Erna, even after all this time. The feeling brought a mix of joy and sorrow. Joy at seeing his closest friend happy and sorrow that he had set out to cut ties from the one person he felt happy around.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*It was Erna.Bjorn had been casually looking out the window of his carriage when he happened to catch sight of the woman. He wasn\u2019t very close, but there was no doubt about it. The woman walking over the bridge was undoubtedly Erna Hardy, the sassy little thief who had stolen his trophy.She was with a young man, who Bjorn was sure he also knew. The name of him was on the tip of his tongue, but might as well be a complete stranger for all his efforts to try and recall it. It wasn\u2019t until the distance between them had closed that the name suddenly sprang to his mind.Pavel Lore.The moment he remembered the name, the carriage passed them by. Bjorn ducked his head away from the window and back into the gloom of the carriage. The image of the woman remained in his mind and her smile, like the river Arbit with the sun beating down upon it and casting scales of light across its surface.She was a naughty little minx that liked to entice lords to her with the promise of betrothal, all the while dating that lowly art academy student. She was indeed worthy to be called the successor of Gladys Hartford.They were definitely dating.Bjorn came to this conclusion by the time the carriage entered into the down town area. It was a feeling that came with the mourning of all the hapless young nobles that fell for her succubus smile and innocent face.She had certainly made the summer more eventful when she suddenly appeared on the scene. He watched the fuss and enjoyed the young lads getting their hearts broken. It was more enjoyable than any of the other people games he liked to play.The carriage finally came to a stop and Bjorn put his gloves back on before stepping out. He put aside meaningless memories and strode toward Freyr Central Bank. The building was a grand presentation of pseudo-Roman columns holding up a slanted roof adorned with beautiful flowing reliefs. They depicted Freyr, the god of war and wisdom in the founding mythology of Lechen. It was also the name of the ship commanded by Philip the Second.Bjorn strides through the grand halls occupied by the masses wanting to administrate their accounts. Most of them probably didn\u2019t know who he was, but they moved out of his way, pushed aside by his gravitas like a ship cutting the sea.He entered into a grand golden hall. The air was crisp and fresh and the ancestors of the royal family bowed.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna and Pavel broke from a friendly embrace and made an appointment to meet up again next week at the latest. Same time, same place.Pavel stood on the bridge and watched Erna slow drift out of view. Once she was gone, he found himself reminiscing of when they first met. It had been a late spring afternoon, full of April showers which had turned the paths into a quagmire of puddles.He was running errands for his father and was riding a mule drawn wagon. He spotted a young girl trudging through the mud and looking water logged.\u201cWould you like a lift?\u201d Pavel had asked.It wasn\u2019t until the girl had turned around to look at him, did he realise she was the daughter of Baron Baden, but it was too late. The girl looked like she had fallen into several puddles.\u201cI\u2019ll drive you through this bit, if you want.\u201d He hoped she would refuse.He was expecting her to say no, as she just stood there, contemplating the question. Maybe she didn\u2019t speak his language, or maybe she was a mute, or maybe she was considering ways to punish a low born for speaking to a high born.She finally pulled herself up onto the cart and Pavel gave a swish of the whip to get the mule moving.Erna did not say a word for the entire journey and Pavel was too scared to strike up a conversation. All he did was stare down at her mud caked shoes. He felt regret now, that he had not had the courage to say anything.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Erna had spoken the first words, but not until the cart had already stopped at the end of the muddy track.At first he thought she was a typical, ungrateful aristocratic girl, running off without saying thank you, but as she jumped down, she turned around to him and offered something. Without thinking, Pavel took it. It was a strand of licorice. Even as Pavel considered eating it, the girl fished into a pocket and brought out a neatly wrapped bundle, which she opened and revealed a cookie. She offered it to him too.\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll eat well on the way home.\u201d Pavel smiled.Before Pavel took everything, the girl introduced herself properly with a broad smile and he understood why she had seemed quiet. She had a gap in her front teeth, no doubt where the second tooth had pushed out the baby tooth.\u201cI\u2019m Erna, Erna Baden.\u201d Erna said.She quickly closed her mouth and pursed her lips as she realised Pavel was looking at her missing tooth.\u201cPavel.\u201d Pavel said, but Erna was already running toward her families mansion.She turned at the gate and waved.\u201cThank you.\u201d She shouted back.Unexpectedly, there grew a friendship from that simple, chance encounter.\u201cYou want to go back up there again?\u201d Pavel could hear his father saying in the echo\u2019s of the memory.It was painful to hear it now, but he understood his fathers concern. A high born girl hanging round a millers son. She was like a little sister to him and there was nothing that was going to happen between them, but it seemed like no one else understood that.Pavel waved to Erna as she slowly moved away. She was still the awkward little girl, waving like she did on their first meeting and he still felt like that little boy, waving back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBjorn did not arrive to the party until after it had already begun. He was the only guest to come from Schuber Palace, even though the others had been given an invite. Leonid and Louise decided not to come, which was no surprise to Bjorn, the pair were not very fond of the social gatherings of the Marchioness of the Harbour.\u201cOh, Bjorn, come here.\u201d The Marchioness called out when she saw him.Bjorn fought his way through the press of party goers, a look of surprise on his face, it melted to a smile as he recognised the longing in the woman\u2019s eyes.\u201cToday, please don\u2019t make any problems, I know what a little rascal you are,\u201d The Marchioness gave Bjorn a playful wink. \u201cI hope you will live up to my expectations.\u201dBjorn gave a none committal grunt and returned a playful smile. If there was anyone who wanted the party to end safely, it was the Marchioness of the Harbor, the hostess of the gathering. Bjorn had no intention of causing trouble.The Marchioness was drawn away by other arrivals before Bjorn got caught up in idle chit chat, so he stationed himself at the buffet table and scanned the faces in the room. There were the familiar faces that always seem to make every social gathering going. There were a couple faces he did not recognise, probably out of towners vaticinationing in the city and then there was her.Bjorn caught her soft, warm smile within a crowd of young men vying for her attention. Erna Hardy. She was standing next to the window in the corner of the room, no doubt to restrict the avenue of attack from the young suitors. They seemed to flock to her without relay and try to strike up a conversation. They did not last long as Erna\u2019s defensive posture saw them off and the suitors would skulk off with their tails between their legs to lick their wounded egos.Countess Meyer was no where to be seen. No doubt she was busy presenting the auction items to prospecting bidders.Bjorn nibbled on a cheesy puff pastry ball when a gaggle of women interposed themselves between him and his view of Erna.\u201cDid you know that Gladys is also at the party?\u201d One of them said.He did not know which one, he was too busy trying to look around their over sized hats, stuffed with feathers, to see Erna.\u201cI hear that she had forgiven you, so you should go over and say hello.\u201d Another croaked.\u201cYes, yes, you two really should get back together, soon, before she comes to her senses.\u201d Said another.They were like a hive mind, a single entity that fed on gossip and rumours. The aged women of the royal family got their life force from all the nagging and meddling, so much so that Bjorn was convinced they were rendered immortal from it all.\u201cListen son, youth might seem like it will last forever, but you\u2019ll wake up one morning and realise you\u2019re an old man, grey hair and wrinkled skin. Seize the moment.\u201d The queen of the hive mind said.She pointed to toward Gladys, who was surrounded by followers and gave him a gentle shove in her direction.\u201cYou need to live a healthy life with Gladys, before your bones grow weary, my dear.\u201dAt this moment Bjorn\u2019s greatest gift was his patience. He smiled and nodded as the nagging hive mind showered him with advice about what he should and should not do. His patience was all thanks to a tumultuous divorce and the fact that he gained anything from that ordeal, he had to be thankful in this situation.Eventually, the women moved on to their next prey, when they realised their advice was not taking hold. Bjorn imagined that if they did not find a hapless victim soon, they would shrivel up and turn to dust.Finally free, Bjorn strode across to the corner of the room. To his straight flush, the one hand that could not be beaten. If only he could sort out the debt she owed first.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The prince is approaching. Erna desperately tried not to meet his gaze, but his piercing eyes demanded her attention. She shrunk away deeper into the corner of the corner and realised she was alone now. Where were all the young men minding for her attention now? Did they scatter when they saw the prince coming? What gentlemen, to leave a helpless maiden at the mercy of a dragon.She frowned as if posing a question. She didn\u2019t flinch under the cold gaze of the prince. Others of the party could see the prince approaching her, but they did not seem to care one bit. Not even Princess Gladys, who was entertaining a small gathering between Erna and the prince.\u201cHello, gold thief.\u201dHe seemed to block all avenues of escape and Erna was stuck under his scrutiny. Despite his ungentlemanly demeanour, he wore an elegant smile.\u201cI believe we are over due a conversation.\u201d He continued.Erna turned away from him and made as if she was considering something out the window> The prince leaned in close and whispered.\u201cCome now, don\u2019t be coy, you stole something and now its time to confront me about it.\u201d Erna could feel the smirk.\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about, my prince.\u201d Erna said.She tried to keep her voice steady and dignified, but she could feel it wavering. Her cheeks blushed and she felt heat rising in her.\u201cMy trophy.\u201d The prince said.The prince mimicked Erna and leaned toward the window. Anyone looking at them would think they were discussing something going on out in the garden. Some even got curious and looked out a window further along the wall, but could not make out anything of interest.\u201cThat\u2019s it, a trophy? I\u2019m sorry, but I still have no idea what you\u2019re on about. Please can you leave me alone, prince.\u201d Erna said.\u201cOf course, but only when you return my trophy.\u201d\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Erna said.\u201cBecause you\u2019re a thief.\u201d\u201cA thief? You keep saying that.\u201d Erna said.She turned on the prince and the prince looked down into her large eyes that were like blue flame, burning with interest and annoyance.\u201cAre you really the type to forget something so important?\u201d\u201cNo, that seems more like you.\u201d Erna snapped back.It felt like something a child would say and despite the annoyance on her face, she was still filled with fear of the prince, he was the prince after all. Erna did her best to compose herself.\u201cThat day, even after committing such an absurd act, you still want to behave so rudely toward me? Were you so drunk that you remember nothing?\u201d Erna said.Bjorn was put off by the sudden change in Erna, rounding on him and attempting to put him under her scrutiny. He nodded his head indifferently.\u201cI remember,\u201d Bjorn said. \u201cI remember the fountain in Tara Square. I remember everything.\u201d\u201cYou remember\u2026\u201d Erna said, her stern gaze melting a little.\u201cI must apologise, Miss Hardy, I have over stepped, its not entirely my fault.\u201d Bjorn said.He was suddenly being overly polite and even bowed his head slightly. He was being impeccably courteous and yet, surprisingly arrogant.\u201cNow, its your turn.\u201d Bjorn said.Contrary to Erna\u2019s smirking expression, Bjorn remained calm. It was a thorn that overwhelmed Erna.\u201cAre you really suggesting that I should apologise to the prince?\u201d Erna said.She was confused and could not hide the tremble in her voice. She wanted to run away from the situation. The urge to run was so overwhelming that there was no room to worry about anything else.\u201cThat is the polite thing to do, to the person you assaulted with a trophy and then ran away with said trophy.\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cThat\u2019s reticulose, that\u2026\u201dEverything fell away in that instance, the anger, the shock and the fear. Even as she tried to rebuke the prince, she was forced to recall the memory. It was a long golden stick. She had grabbed what ever was to hand and hit the prince with it. After that, she ran, but she had failed to drop the stick. Was that really a trophy?It wasn\u2019t until she was long clear of the square that she realised she still held the stick in her hand. She threw the stick away in disgust and ran all the way back to the Hardy Mansion. She never looked back.So the thing the prince was claiming to be his trophy was probably now lying in some bush some where near Tara Boulevard. If someone had not found it and thanked their lucky stars.\u201cI\u2026I threw it away.\u201d Erna said softly, ashamedly.\u201cMy trophy, you threw away my trophy?\u201dErna shrunk away from the prince. She shivered at his rhetoric.\u201cOn my way home, I threw it away into some bushes.\u201d Erna said.The straight flush that had stolen the Golden Antlers looked about ready to weep.Bjorn seemed to stare down at Erna for an age. Not saying a word, not moving, just looking down at her. Bjorn stood up straight and adjusted his jacket when the orchestra signalled the start of the first dance.\u201cShall we, Miss Hardy, lets go first.\u201d Bjorn offered his hand.\u201cWhat?\u201d Erna said.She was caught in the net of bewilderment and didn\u2019t know what to do. Bjorn was suddenly being very polite and it gave the man a very creepy aura. Erna wanted to scream.\u201cIf you refuse, people will grow suspicious and misunderstand.\u201d Bjorn whispered softly.Erna couldn\u2019t grasp the situation and she felt like she was spiralling down into a deep hole. What was he trying to accomplish? One moment he was behaving like he wanted to throw her into a prison for theft, now he wanted to dance with her? Why wouldn\u2019t he just leave her alone?\u201cDancing together, at a party, is nothing special.\u201d Bjorn motioned his head toward the dance floor, where several couples were already taking their place. \u201cBut hiding in the corner, talking in secret, that will draw attention.\u201d His eyes locked onto Erna\u2019s once more, they seemed darker, more sinister.\u201cBut I\u2026\u201d Erna stammered.\u201cThere is nothing left to say, you threw away my gold trophy, so lets dance.\u201dBjorn gently took Erna\u2019s hand and escorted her to the centre of the dance floor. Erna was powerless to do anything but follow. She caught the glare of Gladys as past her. She glared at them like she had just caught her husband mid affair.Erna could feel tears forming. \u201cWas it really gold?\u201d Erna said.Bjorn simply nodded. Her hands were limp in his, but she slowly compiled her strength again, as all eyes turned to them. Her whimpers accompanied the melodies of the waltz.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2026I didn\u2019t know. I was just so shocked that day, I really didn\u2019t know. Really.\u201d She blubbed on.Bjorn\u2019s eyes narrowed as he looked down at Erna. \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. I will compensate you, I promise,\u201d Erna said. \u201cHow ever I can. It\u2019s just, a little difficult right now.\u201d\u201cMiss Hardy.\u201d Bjorn sad softly in an attempt to console the gibbering woman.Realising that they had most of the eyes of the party on them, Bjorn suddenly burst into laughter, which shocked Erna and she blinked away the tears.\u201cFine, you can do that.\u201d Bjorn said mid chuckle.Erna really did not like the idea of being in the princes debt. She got the horrible feeling that he was going to use this for some bitter means. To be indebted is to create weakness. She knew that she would not be able to repay the cost of the gold, Bjorn knew that too, she practically told him, but she knew the rules of fair trade and she would not let the poisonous prince take advantage of her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayErna moved like she was dancing on water, her graceful steps and twirls were delicate and purposeful. Her dress was a ripple across the waters surface. It was as if the waltz was Erna\u2019s life purpose.Bjorn looked down at the girl. His concentration was solely on her and he almost lost a few steps during the dance. He could not get a read on Erna and he suspected that this was all a calculated act. If so, Erna was the best actress on the continent.Bjorn could feel that Erna was tense, like she had the worries of the world on her shoulders, but she moved so freely. Bjorn thought it was probably the benefit of being so small and agile. So distracted, Bjorn almost clipped the back of his heels and he concisely looked around to see if anyone saw his blunder. His gaze caught that of Gladys.She was dancing with some noble\u2019s son, he was sure that he recognised him, but he did not take too much notice, he was more concerned at how Gladys kept looking at him, even as she dancing. It made Bjorn feel quite self conscious.Bjorn got the impression that Gladys was jealous of Erna because Erna seemed like the more innocent princess. Bjorn smiled at the thought. It would seem that he was not the only one taken in by Erna\u2019s acting.This would make a fine spectacle. The prince dancing with such an innocent angel. He could already imagine the provocative magazine articles that would be published in the coming weeks.Bjorn turned his attention back to Erna, who hadn\u2019t seemed to notice he had been distracted. He found himself getting drawn in by her porcelain skin, freshly coloured with a light red blush along her cheeks.As Erna twirled and tilted her head away from him, exposing the nape of her neck, Bjorn felt intoxicated by her closeness and he paused his dancing for the briefest moment. He fought the urge to nuzzle into her and take in her scent.Erna didn\u2019t notice, she was too busy dancing and enjoying the moment. Bjorn forced himself to focus and conclude the dance with a flourish.Erna curtsied to the prince for the pleasant dance. When she looked at him, he felt his heart skip and he became suddenly aware of her soft, pouting lips. The little round nose, the deep blue eyes that were as large as dishes.When he stared into those pools of blue fire, he realised she was staring right back at him and her expression seemed to say\u00a0Are you ok?Bjorn smiled and nodded. \u201cGood job Miss Hardy.\u201dWithout realising, he looked over at Gladys, who shot him an evil glare that threatened to curdle his blood. He had used Erna as a screen against his ex-wife, but he got the feeling that he might have stirred the pot a little too much.\u201cThe trophy will be reimbursed slowly.\u201d He leaned in and whispered to Erna.Erna looked at him in disbelief, but she wore a bright smile. Gladys used to wear a smile just like that, back in the early days of their relationship.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cAren\u2019t you already in a relationship?\u201d Peter said.\u201cNot likely, but if its true, I\u2019ll kill you. It\u2019s against the rules.\u201d Leonard said.Bjorn was sat on the terrace that looked out over the sea. He was enjoying a little peace and a cigar, when his betters came out to harass him over Erna. The music and laughter of the banquet hall was a faint din out here.Bjorn did not raise to the groups bait, as they tried to goad him into a response, so they changed the target of their mocking.\u201cWeren\u2019t you chasing the young Miss Hardy, Peter?\u201d Said a young gentleman Bjorn was having trouble placing a name for.\u201cIn deed he was, you told me you sent her flowers.\u201d Leonard said.Peter\u2019s face flushed with embarrassment. \u201cYes, I even got this reply.\u201dLeonard wasted no time and snatched the letter from Peter just as soon as he took the letter out of his pocket.\u201cFirst of all, I would like to thank you for the flowers. Off to a good start.\u201d Leonard mocked. \u201cHowever. That\u2019s not good. However, I am unable to reciprocate the gifts that you have sent me and can only send you this letter in response. I\u2019m sorry, but I think it would be too difficult for us to have tea together at this time. It would be best if you were to send flowers and cards to someone who does have the time for you.\u201d The small group of young men gave sympathetic noises toward Peter. Leonard continued. \u201cOnce again, I would like to express my deepest gratitude in the flowers you have sent me and my deepest apologies.\u201dThe letter was passed around and eventually made its way to Bjorn. As the group jabbed Peter in the ribs, Bjorn read the letter and suddenly burst out laughing along with the other members on the terrace.\u201cDon\u2019t laugh, you children. All relationships start out like this, the gander chasing the goose, its how we know the feelings are real.\u201d Peter declared. His face was so bright and red.Bjorn turned away from the commotion and looked back out over the sea. He puffed the cigar back to life. It was not a particularly dark night and the moon was close to full. Its radiant glow glittered off the rippling sea.\u201cNow look at this, who\u2019s this bastard talking to Miss Hardy now?\u201d Peter said.Everyone on the terrace, including Bjorn, looked through the glass of the double doors, into the golden glow of the ball room. They could see that a young man was talking to Erna at the buffet table.Heinz\u2019s second son. Bjorn thought.Bjorn\u2019s eyes narrowed as he recognised the young man. He did not have a very good reputation, but he was still a better candidate than Peter Bergen, or even Count Leonard Lehmen.\u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, then go and claim the steak. If not, then leave the pair alone. Erna knows her business.\u201d The others looked in shock as Bjorn uttered the words through a plume of cigar smoke. \u201cOur bet is a bet and Miss Hardy must be about her own business.\u201d\u201cSo be it, forgive me.\u201d Peter said.Peter seemed to look at Bjorn with something resembling admiration for the princes cool demeanour. Maybe it was that nonchalant that women found attractive.The group devolved into another tirade of bickering and playful arguing. Bjorn would interject with his opinion now and then, but for the most part, he was absent from the conversations.\u201cCan we talk.\u201d Came a feminine voice sometime into the night.The group of lads turned and parted like the red sea to reveal Gladys. Bjorn let out a breath and dumped the rest of his cigar into the ashtray.\u201cYes, of course princess.\u201d Bjorn said.They moved to a discreet corner of the terrace, which was not very discreet at all and anything more than a low whisper could easily be over heard. Bjorn stood and faced out toward the sea. Gladys approached under the gaze of the young lads and couldn\u2019t help but feel like a child about to be punished.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being rude to you.\u201d Bjorn said when Gladys got close.All pretence of joy was wiped from his face as he turned to look at Gladys. He pulled another cigar from an inside pocket of his jacket and bit the end.\u201cAre you going to use the girl like this forever?\u201d Gladys said.\u201cThe girl?\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cThat poor country girl you\u2019re using to torment me.\u201d Gladys said, anger lighting her eyes.\u201cHer name is Erna and you seem very sure of yourself to accuse me of using her.\u201d Bjorn smiled, but it was insincere, almost mocking. \u201cIn my eyes, that country girl is more beautiful than you, princess. She is kinder, if more naive than a princess, needless to say.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t hurt that innocent girl. We may have problems and we should keep it between the two of us.\u201d Gladys said.\u201cI said it very clearly that day, princess, the deal was fair and you agreed. There is nothing left between us.\u201d Bjorn said. His face flared a menacing orange and red as he lit the cigar.They did not shout at each other, or raise their voices even slightly. It was pointless in pouring out their raw emotions again, in a public display of embarrassment. The fact that there was nothing left to pour out made the situation more annoying for Gladys.\u201cWhat if I were to offer you another deal?\u201d Gladys said, she could feel tears starting to form. \u201cThen maybe things could be different between us.\u201dThe offer was a little unexpected, but had been on the fringes of Gladys thoughts, she had always hoped she could return from being the sorrowful heroine. Bjorn turned as if he intended to leave a boring theatre.\u201cWhat deal?\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cThe crown. I want to give back your crown, which you lost because of me.\u201d Tears welled and flowed. \u201cI came back to Lechen for that reason. I wanted to apologise to you, to start over fresh.\u201d\u201cYou would return my crown?\u201d Bjorn said, ignoring everything else Gladys said.\u201cIf you can change the public\u2019s mind by showing them that we can live happily together, you will be able to regain the throne. My father promised he will support us.\u201d Even as Gladys cried, her voice was clear and sweet. \u201cI understand that forgiving me wont be easy. I don\u2019t really expect you to forgive me, but Bjorn, please give me a chance to atone. I don\u2019t mind that you hate me, so please don\u2019t turn away from me. Please.\u201d Gladys reached out and grabbed the cuff of Bjorn\u2019s sleeve. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how much I regret the mistakes I made when I was young and immature. As much as I did wrong by you, please don\u2019t punish me like this. Please?\u201d\u201cReally.\u201d Bjorn said flatly. He did not try to shake away Gladys grip of his arm.\u201cYes, I will try hard, I will keep praying and I will work even harder, until your heart is relived. Can you do that?\u201d Gladys looked up at him with puffy red eyes glistening with tears.\u201cFine.\u201d Bjorn nodded as if understanding. Gladys\u2019 eyes twinkled with faint hope. \u201cBut what should I do Princess? The deal you suggest is impossible for me.\u201dBjorn let out a sigh and shook off Gladys grip like he was wiping away dirt. Gladys looked up at him with wide eyed shock, tears streaming down her face.\u201cBjorn?\u201d She said softly.\u201cMy crown was not lost because of you.\u201d Bjorn said as he tidied his crumpled sleeve. \u201cIf I really wanted to protect my crown, there are plenty of other ways. I could just kill your child for one.\u201d\u201cWha\u2026what are you saying?\u201d Gladys recoiled from the man.\u201cIts such a simple thing to do. I could have given you medicine while he was still in your womb. It would have been a smell thing to have said he was stillborn. The people would have been more sympathetic to me, the crown prince losing an heir. The tabloids would have called me the unlucky prince who lost a son and a wife. That would probably be the cleanest way, do you think?\u201d Bjorn was surprisingly calm, which sent a chill down Gladys\u2019 spine. \u201cThat would have been the easy route, if I wanted the crown, but I didn\u2019t. I gave up the crown on my own. I don\u2019t really want it. SO how exactly do you think you could give it back to me?\u201d Bjorn\u2019s smile became cold as his words became sharp. \u201cWhat about Leonid? Would you make him give back the crown he received voluntarily, because the princess of Lars demands it?\u201d\u201cI, don\u2019t mean that\u2026\u201d Gladys blubbed.\u201cDo you think the throne of Lechen a fun little plaything, princess?\u201d Bjorn interrupted.\u201cNo, its not like that, please\u2026\u201d Gladys tried to say.She was practically begging the prince now, forcing herself to endure the tears. The gossip of the others on the terrace seeped through her sobs.\u201cIf you want to have the crown prince again, then I suggest you find another kingdom. I hear the Queen of Bern recently died of old age. Maybe you could have a peek there, pick at her bones like the vulture you appear to be. Wouldn\u2019t queen be better than a crown princess?\u201d\u201cDo you hate me so much that you must be so cruel.\u201d Gladys shouted, letting her tears free.Bjorn cocked an eyebrow as he passed his attention over the onlookers on the terrace and the would be eavesdroppers in the ball room. They all stepped back and tried to act as if they were about their own business. All except Peter and Leonard, who just stood with mouths agape.Bjorn marched out of the terrace and through the banquet hall. A buzz of commotion followed in the Grand Dukes wake, but he did not care. Peter and Leonard went after him as he left the banquet hall. Bjorn never looked back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

hall.She passed the lounge, where resting guests were enjoying refreshments, and walked on and on, diligently, along the interminable hallway.\u00a0 She sighed in relief as she reached the east side drawing room and found it empty.Sitting cautiously on the end of the sofa, Erna\u2019s exhausted eyes fell on the clock.\u00a0 It was almost midnight, but the party had showed no signs of ending.Erna sighed again, this time without relief.\u00a0 Out of the blue, she was accused of being a thief and owing huge debts; she had danced with the prince and suffered from bitter eyes surrounding her.\u00a0 The day had been tiring; besides all her labors, the son of the Heinz family\u2019s persistence in asking her for a dance had worn her out.Robin Heinz\u2014that was what he called himself when he made his introduction\u2014appeared to be everywhere, no matter how hard she tried to escape.\u00a0 His first few requests had been polite, but every time she rejected him, he became more and more overbearing.Erna had managed to silently leave the banquet hall, and now she planned to hide here until the party was over.\u00a0 But just when she had reached that relieving conclusion a shadow fell across the entryway.\u201cI was wondering where you were going in such a hurry!\u00a0 I\u2019ve found you, Miss Snob Hardy!\u201d Robin Heinz approached the sofa where Erna was sitting with malicious sarcasm.Startled, Erna readjusted her shoes and jumped to her feet, a momentary feeling of fear darting through her.\u00a0 The man smelled heavily of liquor.\u201cDo you have an appointment here with the Grand Duke, maybe?\u201d Heinz sneered.\u201cLet me be, Mr. Heinz.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u00a0 Robin Heinz\u2019s hand flashed out and he snatched Erna\u2019s wrist, too quickly for her to avoid the move.\u00a0 \u201cAre men clowns to you, hey?\u201d he asked.\u201cLet go of my hand!\u00a0 Are you mad?!\u201d\u201cYou stupid woman.\u00a0 It\u2019s useless for you to chase the prince.\u00a0 You\u2019d be better off showing me a little sweetness.\u00a0 The prince can\u2019t do anything, but you don\u2019t know, I might be able to buy you instead of the old man.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u00a0 Let go of my hand!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d\u00a0 For a second Robin dropped his sarcastic tone.\u00a0 \u201cYour father is just the man to sell his daughter to anyone who brings a bundle of money.\u00a0 If I offer a penny more than the old man, you\u2019ll be mine, Miss Hardy.\u00a0 You still think you can reject me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u00a0 Why\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026\u201dRobin Heinz yanked Erna closer to him, muttering inarticulately now.\u00a0 As her body touched his chest, Erna began to scream and struggle.\u00a0 Surprised by a stronger resistance than he\u2019d expected, Robin\u2019s grip loosened.\u201cHa!\u00a0 Really, you\u2019re a woman\u2026\u201d Heinz began, seeing Erna run to the other end of the room.Erna looked at the window with frightened eyes.\u00a0 The man was between her and the exit, and she knew she couldn\u2019t beat him in a physical fight.\u00a0 The window was her only hope.\u00a0 She laid both hands on the sill, but looking down terrified her.\u00a0 In tears of fear, she tried to summon her resolution, but it was too late.\u00a0 Heinz already grabbed her from behind.A sharp scream filled the room and reverberated through the empty hallway.It was a woman\u2019s desperate scream that stopped Bjorn\u2019s steps.\u00a0 The sound clearly came from the end of the corridor leading to the east side of the mansion.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t a place where the party guests would be gathered.Thinking that he\u2019d heard wrong, Bjorn was about to continue on his way, but another scream, even sharper than the last, stopped him in his tracks.\u00a0 There\u2019d been too much real fear in that scream for him to dismiss it as his imagination, or the wind.\u201cWhat dog couldn\u2019t handle the drinks and is off messing with the maid?\u201d he thought dryly.With a slight sigh, Bjorn turned towards the east corridor.\u00a0 His plans of snatching a bit of sleep without anyone around seemed to have gone wrong.The summer night had been an annoying one in more ways than one, but that was nothing new to him.His twisted life since he\u2019d divorced Gladys was now as familiar to him as his arm or his leg.\u00a0 In fact, not much had changed.\u00a0 Even before his divorce, he\u2019d never been a model child, and his way of life had never been much different from what it was now.All things considered, Bjorn liked the freedom he\u2019d gotten in exchange for the anticipation of the crown.He enjoyed his freedom all the more when parties like this came.\u00a0 It was a pleasure not to have to endure fools treating the crown prince with absurd dignity.\u00a0 Even being able to escape like this, to run down the hall in pursuit of a woman\u2019s scream, was a bit of freedom the crown prince didn\u2019t enjoy.\u00a0 So Bjorn decided he was willing to enjoy his freedom today.\u00a0 Until he met an unexpected face.\u201cMiss Hardy?!\u201dBjorn stopped at the entrance of the drawing room, stuttering over the name, unable to believe what his eyes were telling him.\u00a0 Erna, shivering and crying, lifted her agonized face and saw him.\u00a0 It took a minute for her vacant eyes to focus.\u201cWhat is all this\u2026\u201d Bjorn stopped a few steps away from Erna, gaping as he tried to understand the mess in front of him.A woman crying, a torn dress, a bloody candlestick.\u00a0 And a fallen man.\u00a0 Bjorn\u2019s eyes gradually narrowed.\u00a0 Some of it he had expected, though finding Erna instead of a maid was a surprise.\u00a0 And the fact that it was the man lying bloody on the floor was a surprise too.\u201cPrince, I\u2026 I think I killed a man.\u201d\u00a0 Erna gasped and tried to rally herself, struggling to speak.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\u00a0 I was so scared, I had to\u2026 he fell, I hit his head\u2026 there\u2019s blood\u2026\u201dErna\u2019s tears became uncontrollable as full realization sank in.\u00a0 Blood dripped from the candlestick she clutched in her hand, punctuating the carpet with dark stains.The sounds of thin cloth tearing, of the candlestick giving a dull blow, of Heinz\u2019s gasping cry as he fell, echoed through Erna\u2019s mind at the same time.\u00a0 She\u2019d just reached mindlessly out, grabbed the first thing that came to hand, and struck him with all her might as his hand touched her.\u00a0 Still in shock, she stood with the bloodstained candlestick over the fallen man, barely able to see the results through her tears, but still too vividly aware of what had happened.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miss Hardy.\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn had knelt to examine the man, and now he rose to his feet with a slight sigh.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s just fainted\u2014he\u2019ll wake up soon enough.\u00a0 His kind doesn\u2019t die so easily.\u201d\u201c\u2026really?\u201d Erna breathed, through her exhausted tears.\u00a0 The front of her torn dress was soaked, but she was past noticing it.\u201cReally,\u201d Bjorn nodded emphatically, slipping his evening coat off his own shoulders and on to Erna\u2019s.\u00a0 \u201cCan you walk?\u201d he asked.Erna nodded, taking a few trembling steps.\u201cThen go.\u201d\u00a0 Short and firm, Bjorn motioned her out of the room, taking the candlestick from her grasp at the same time.\u00a0 The blood on it soaked into his gloves.\u00a0 \u201cGet out of here, take the stairs at the end of the left hall.\u00a0 You\u2019ll come out at the garden behind the mansion, and if you take the straight road, you\u2019ll reach the carriages.\u00a0 Go home in the Hardy family carriage; I\u2019ll take care of the others.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cRemember, the stairs at the end of the left hall.\u00a0 Stairs, gardens, straight ahead,\u201d Bjorn repeated calmly, impressing the instructions on Erna, who was still reeling slightly from all she\u2019d undergone.\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u00a0 You\u2026 the man\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a little to blame for this, aren\u2019t I?\u00a0 I\u2019m just doing my part.\u201d\u201cBut Prince\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Bjorn grinned.\u00a0 \u201cI always get my debts repaid.\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn finished tying the sleeves of his coat around Erna\u2019s neck.\u00a0 Wrapped in his clothes, she looked ridiculously small.\u00a0 \u201cBy the way, do you like boating?\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn\u2019s tone was relaxed, casual, asking questions that didn\u2019t fit the situation at all.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0 Erna blinked, doubting her ears.\u00a0 But Bjorn still smiled at her with his inconsequent grin.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to like it.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough, you\u2019d better go now,\u201d Bjorn announced, glancing back into the drawing room at Robin Heinz, who had stirred a little.\u201cGo,\u201d he repeated, cold and unsmiling now.Erna nodded her head through tears.The drawing room fell silent again once Erna\u2019s echoing footsteps left the hall.\u00a0 Bjorn looked scornfully down at the fallen man.\u00a0 He\u2019d expected a jerk, of course, but he hadn\u2019t expected this idiot.\u00a0 How could anyone treat the daughter of a well-known noble family like this?He picked up the vase on the console.\u00a0 His steps approached the fallen man calmly and unhurriedly, without any hint of the dramatic situation he was in.Bjorn stopped as he reached the pool of red on the carpet\u2014red from the blood that had dripped from Robin Heinz\u2019s face.\u00a0 Despite the blood, though, the man wasn\u2019t seriously injured.\u00a0 The bleeding had come from a few scratches on the side of the head and mostly from his nose, where the candlestick had struck him hard.For a moment Bjorn felt sorry for Robin, and he accelerated the waking process by pouring some of the vase\u2019s water onto his face.\u00a0 In a minute Robin had regained consciousness, struggling to sit up and looking dazed like a drowning man.\u201cHi, Heinz,\u201d Bjorn said calmly, laying the vase back in its place.Robin Heinz looked at him in confusion, trying to make sense of Bjorn\u2019s smiling face and the red candlestick in his hand.Heinz rose to his feet in amazement, gradually coming to his senses.\u00a0 The roses that had been in the vase rolled on the ruined carpet.\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I went too far,\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cBut you didn\u2019t die, so it\u2019s alright.\u00a0 Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d Bjorn laughed, tapping Robin on the head with the bloody candlestick.Robin\u2019s eyes widened as he began to understand what Bjorn was saying.\u00a0 \u201cYou crazy punk!\u201d he shouted, spitting blood.\u00a0 Even so, Bjorn\u2019s smile deepened as he saw the rage in Robin\u2019s eyes.Robin Heinz, Bjorn was sure, would never make a fuss about being knocked out by a slender woman.\u00a0 So even if he didn\u2019t like it, he\u2019d have no choice but to take Bjorn\u2019s way out.\u00a0 It would be much better to have a big fight with the infamous prince to save face.Still smiling, but sighing too, Bjorn swung the candlestick.\u00a0 Robin Heinz, hit on his already battered head, screamed and collapsed on the floor again.\u00a0 The roses he fell on filled the room with their strong scent.\u201cYou know how much we\u2019ve fought?\u201d Bjorn giggled dryly, kicking Heinz in the stomach.\u00a0 \u201cYou know how keen-eyed the folks here are.\u201dBjorn was enjoying the excuse to beat Robin harder and sell the fight.Another kick, this time to the face, and Robin\u2019s nose was bleeding again.\u201cYou understand how it is, Heinz.\u201dEven as he spoke, Bjorn didn\u2019t stop kicking.\u00a0 Robin struggled to save himself, but he was helplessly unable to stand.\u00a0 When he started screaming and crying, Bjorn took a step back.\u201cI guess that\u2019s enough.\u201dBjorn knelt down to examine his work.\u00a0 A smile came to his face.He patted Robin\u2019s head as if he were praising a loyal dog, then threw off his bloody gloves and stood up.\u00a0 His name, embroidered with gold on the wrist of a once white glove, shone clearly in the dim light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

adieu after a sociable conversation, Bjorn silently paid polite tribute to Robin Heinz, who was struggling to make eye contact.\u00a0 It was hard to find any trace of the one-sided fight that had just occurred anywhere in Bjorn\u2019s appearance as he left.He walked slowly down the empty corridor.\u00a0 Bjorn couldn\u2019t feel very sorry for what he\u2019d had to do\u2014though he knew he\u2019d been pouring out the irritation he\u2019d accumulated thanks to Gladys on Heinz.\u00a0 Even the knowledge of the rumors that would be spreading through the whole city before dawn couldn\u2019t mar that satisfaction.\u00a0 It would be perfect if Princess Gladys\u2019s despair increased thanks to the increased scandal around her ex-husband, already far from the crown.Bjorn entered the lounge with the candlestick still in his hand.\u00a0 The guests, inadvertently turning their eyes towards him, were startled.\u201cBj-Bjorn!\u201d\u00a0 The Marchioness of Harbour was the first to gather her wits, and her shout rang out sharply.\u00a0 \u201cAfter what you did to Gladys and disappeared\u2014what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cOh, this little thing?\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn casually set the bloody candlestick on the table in front of his aunt.\u00a0 \u201cThere was a bit of a commotion.\u201d\u201cCommotion?\u00a0 What under\u2026 oh!\u201d\u00a0 The Marchioness screamed, unable to finish her sentence.\u00a0 Other ladies, following her eyes, screamed too.\u00a0 Among them was Gladys, sitting in a corner, surrounded by friends making attempts to comfort her.Bjorn turned around, more satisfied than ever by what he saw.\u00a0 Robin Heinz, limping and as bloody as might be expected, stood in the entrance, drawing everyone\u2019s attention.One of the ladies broke the tension by trying to faint.\u00a0 The attempt wasn\u2019t a total success, but it shook up the atmosphere and the party broke up into groups, clustering some around the fainting lady, some around Robin.Now that the dramatic moment was over, Bjorn tired of the scene.\u00a0 Shrugging off those who would have questioned him, he moved out towards the banquet hall.As he left he glanced backwards at the Marchioness of Harbour\u2019s face.\u00a0 She was pale, her eyes snapping with the excitement of a bloody battle at her party.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cMiss!\u00a0 It\u2019s real!\u00a0 There really is a gold trophy like that!\u201d Lisa, excited, raised her voice as soon as she entered the bedroom.Erna, hovering nervously over her dresser, turned around abruptly, frightened.\u00a0 The brush she\u2019d been holding dropped from her hand and rolled until it touched Lisa\u2019s toes.\u201cIt\u2019s a social club tradition that a gentleman who is about to marry makes a golden deer horn trophy and holds a bachelor party,\u201d Lisa said, picking up the brush mechanically and bringing it back to Erna.\u00a0 Her eyes were sparkling with the relish of telling news.\u00a0 \u201cThe best drinker, or something, at the party wins it.\u00a0 There are all kinds of silly traditions, betting on drinking, betting on gold.\u00a0 Guys are always up to silly things.\u201dAccording to Lisa\u2019s survey among the maids of her acquaintance, the son of Marquis Bergman had recently made the trophy and held a huge bachelor party.\u00a0 Bjorn had been the winner.\u00a0 It was well known that \u201cPrince Poisonous Mushroom\u201d had swept away all the awards of the bachelor party and earned a new nickname, \u201cHell\u2019s Deer Hunter.\u201d\u00a0 Lisa went on and on, telling all she had heard, and Erna\u2019s despair deepened.\u201cBut, miss, why are you curious about these antics?\u201d Lisa asked doubtfully, suddenly breaking off her tale.Erna clutched her skirt with a start.\u201cI\u2026 Oh, I heard of it at the party.\u00a0 It\u2026 it seemed so strange, fascinating\u2026 I was curious, a little.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s strange enough!\u201d Lisa nodded, not questioning the explanation.\u00a0 \u201cBut Prince Poisonous Mushrooms is always up to something.\u00a0 Just lately he\u2019s set the town talking again.\u00a0 It\u2019s a wonder the place is ever quiet, with all he does to stir it up.\u201d\u00a0 Lisa\u2019s tongue had already forgotten the trophy and moved on to the next piece of news.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not enough for him to drink himself drunk, he even gets into fights.\u00a0 What a loser that man is.\u201d\u201cOh, no, Lisa,\u201d Erna corrected, without thinking of what she was saying.\u00a0 \u201cIt was\u2014he wasn\u2019t drunk.\u00a0 I\u2026 I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 She stopped, realizing that she couldn\u2019t explain.\u201cOh, you don\u2019t know these drinkers, Miss.\u201d\u201cBut\u2014maybe he fought someone who was doing wrong?\u201d\u00a0 Erna knew she should let it go, but she couldn\u2019t back down.\u00a0 No matter what sort of man the Prince was, this time it was her fault, and she couldn\u2019t let him take blame, not if she could help it.Lisa laughed.\u00a0 \u201cNo way.\u00a0 No matter how bad the Heinz children are, it\u2019s not likely one of them was in the wrong in a fight with Prince Poisonous Mushroom.\u201d\u00a0 She stopped laughing and her expression became serious as she shook her head.\u00a0 \u201cYou keep taking sides with the Prince, miss.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019m not taking sides\u2014only you can\u2019t make a judgment without knowing the whole situation\u2026\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u00a0 Lisa shook her head more vigorously, frowning.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t be misled by his appearance!\u00a0 Poisonous mushrooms are always pretty, but do you know what happens when you eat them?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it, Lisa.\u201d\u201cYou die.\u00a0 Remember that, young lady.\u00a0 You\u2019ll die if you eat poisonous mushrooms!\u201dLisa repeated herself as if she were speaking to the child on the brink of a new excursion, and she stopped only when she was called by another maid looking for her.\u00a0 Even as she closed the door behind her, she hissed another stern warning\u2014\u201cYou\u2019ll die if you eat it!\u201dLeft alone, Erna sat helplessly in front of her desk.\u00a0 She had messed up all her work materials, but she couldn\u2019t get her mind together to straighten them out.The Prince\u2019s face floated on a piece of cloth cut into petals.\u00a0 His face was on the shiny scissors, the flower vase, even on the bottle of dye.\u00a0 The only way to avoid seeing his face was to close her eyes.Erna owed the Prince a lot\u2014in more ways than one.The undeniable fact was weighing heavily on her mind.She made an excuse out of a walk and searched the path from the fountain to the mansion early in the morning, but not surprisingly, there was no sign of the deer horn trophy.\u00a0 Her last hope that the Prince might have lied was shattered.\u00a0 Besides, she had put the guilt on him and run away like a coward.The more she thought about it, the more nervous and worried Erna became.\u00a0 She hurried to her closet and the hand that reached for her tin money jar was pale and unsteady.\u201cWhat can I do, how will I ever repay it?\u201d Erna moaned, slumping to the floor as she groped inside the jar.\u00a0 Even if she sold everything she owned, she knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to buy so much as a corner of the deer horn.Although she knew it was pointless, Erna sat there for a long time and counted up what was in the jar over and over.\u00a0 The sounds of coins rolling in the tin can clattered hopelessly.If she had known this would happen, she could have saved money\u2026On the day Pavel had told the department store that Erna would deliver fake flowers, she had been thrilled to buy a lot of materials.\u00a0 Of course, that had been a small amount of money, but just now she felt like having saved it would have made a big difference.\u201cFlowers\u2026\u201d Erna muttered unconsciously as she stared into the dark depths of the jar.\u00a0 But as she thought about her flowers, a weak hope dawned and her lethargic eyes began to revive.Her grandfather had said that whatever else you lost, you could always save your pride and dignity.\u00a0 And Erna was her grandfather\u2019s proud granddaughter and pupil.\u201cIf you\u2019re in debt, pay it back honestly as much as you can,\u201d he had said.\u00a0 \u201cApologize sincerely and ask frankly for forgiveness if you make a mistake.\u201dHis teachings came back to her now, and with it all that he meant by pride and dignity.\u00a0 Just because he was in heaven was no reason to forget what he\u2019d said on earth.Erna jumped from her seat, clutching a bouquet of silver flowers she had made.Live a life of faith.That was the legacy her grandfather had left behind.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*At sunset, the Abit River turns rosy.Bjorn drew the curtains and threw his carriage window wide open.\u00a0 The evening scenery\u2014the city flowing past him with the speed of the carriage\u2014was calming and relaxing.\u00a0 Bjorn leaned back deep into his seat, tired from a busy day, looking drowsily out at the rosy tinted riverside.The evening was peaceful.Frayr Bank was firmly established in Schubert\u2019s financial world, and his individual investments were making satisfactory returns.\u00a0 In a recent grand horse race, his own racehorse had won the championship.\u00a0 Bjorn wasn\u2019t interested in the races for their own sake, but the prize money brought in by his champion stallion was different.Life was going the way he wanted, so smoothly that he couldn\u2019t find any reason not to love this summer.\u00a0 All the more so since Gladys\u2019s presence was blurred by the excitement surrounding the beautiful sale Viscount Hardy was making.\u00a0 Bjorn spared a thought of pity for the girl whose father was busy arranging her marriage with the highest bidder\u2026 but did it matter how?\u00a0 Bjorn thought he could love any woman whose name wasn\u2019t Gladys.\u00a0 Besides, he had that bet on the boat rides during the festival\u2026 and he expected Erna to bring him a big profit.A smile of satisfaction, born of many things, spread across Bjorn\u2019s mouth as the carriage entered the bridge connecting the city and the Grand Duke\u2019s estate.Bjorn was willing to agree with anyone who said that this bridge was the most beautiful bridge on the Abit River.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t an art connoisseur, but even in his eyes, the bridge looked nice\u2014not surprisingly.\u00a0 No expense had been spared to make it as gorgeous as possible to commemorate his family\u2019s ancient victory.Bjorn raised his eyes towards the entrance of the bridge, where stood a golden statue on a tall granite pillar.\u00a0 Phillip II, the Conquest King, Bjorn\u2019s great-grandfather, had built the bridge and ordered this massive mounted statue of himself.Nodding familiarly towards the statue of his ancestor, who had done so much to turn the city into the gem it was today, Bjorn smiled lightly and swept away the hair from his eyes as the wind gusted across the bridge.\u00a0 Though dark was beginning to fall, the bridge was brilliantly lit by gas lamps and the diligent lamplighters.\u00a0 These lights sparkling along the railing were the crowning glory of the bridge\u2019s beauty.It was when the end of the bridge was coming close that Bjorn\u2019s eyes, distracted by the unfolding beauties of the bridge of light, suddenly narrowed.\u00a0 A woman stood under the granite pillar at the end of the bridge.\u00a0 A woman with a bundle in her arms, staring at his carriage.\u201cErna.\u201dBjorn exclaimed her name with a sudden laugh.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t believe it, but it was definitely Erna.\u00a0 A lady dressed in countryside fashion.\u00a0 He felt like he\u2019d just been handed a straight flush to win his bet.As he came closer, the woman began to wave nervously at the carriage.\u00a0 It couldn\u2019t have been an accident.\u00a0 Only one Grand Duke\u2019s carriage ever crossed this bridge.Bjorn laughed again and tapped at the carriage front.\u00a0 As his coachman reined in the horses, the flowing scenery also came to a stop.Sighing softly, Bjorn opened the door of his carriage.\u00a0 The woman\u2014Erna\u2014shrank back for a moment into the now motionless evening scene.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

carriage as it came to a stop by the quiet riverside.\u00a0 The coachman, having discreetly driven to the least frequented part of the drive, left his seat and meandered off.\u00a0 But inside, neither Bjorn nor Erna spoke as the sunset reached its peak.\u00a0 Bjorn watched Erna, and Erna watched her hands lying in her lap.\u201cI didn\u2019t come here for peace and quiet.\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn\u2019s voice cut into the balmy wind carrying the fragrance of the river current.Erna raised her head with a start.\u00a0 Their eyes met in the red of the sunset.\u201cSay what you were waiting to say,\u201d Bjorn ordered calmly, boredom in his eyes.Erna shrank back at the bland command.\u00a0 She was grateful for the darkening sky, hiding her face, probably red as the sunset by now.She hadn\u2019t flinched when it came to sneaking out of Hardy Street and taking a cab to the bridge.\u00a0 Even when she stood on the archduke\u2019s bridge and waited for Bjorn\u2019s carriage, she\u2019d been brave without fear.All she had to do was return the clothes, apologize, and promise to pay the debt.Now face to face with Bjorn and her self-imposed task, Erna had suddenly become nervous.\u00a0 But as she thought one by one of what she had come to do, she found her bravery again.\u201cFirst of all,\u201d she said, \u201cI came to return this.\u201d\u00a0 Erna pulled herself together and held out a large box.\u00a0 Inside was the evening coat the Prince had wrapped her in that night.\u00a0 Bjorn smiled when he recognized the well-trimmed edge of his clothing.\u201cWas there no servant in the Hardy family who could run this errand?\u201d\u201cI wanted to return it myself.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dHis stare burdened Erna, and she lowered her eyes and swallowed.\u00a0 \u201cI wanted to say\u2014just wanted to say thank you, thank you so much for helping me, Prince.\u00a0 And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cBecause of me, you\u2019ve been falsely accused.\u00a0 I was the one who hurt Mr. Heinz, and now there\u2019s this false rumor that you were fighting\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, that!\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn cut Erna off in a casual way.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not a false rumor.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0 Startled, Erna looked full at him for the first time.\u00a0 Her hat, tastefully decorated with colorful flowers, bounced with her movement.Bjorn noticed her outfit for the first time.\u00a0 Dressed in light pink, white lace, and a variety of flowers and ribbons, Erna reminded him of a walking wedding cake.He came back to the conversation abruptly.\u00a0 \u201cI hit him.\u201d\u201cHit him?\u00a0 You, the Prince, hit him?\u00a0 Why?\u201d\u201cJustice.\u00a0 He deserved it,\u201d Bjorn said, a touch mischievous.\u00a0 Erna\u2019s na\u00efve reaction amused him.\u00a0 \u201cHe had ten times as many bruises after I finished with him than after you had.\u00a0 So it\u2019s not really a false accusation.\u201d\u201cBut\u2014you didn\u2019t get hurt?\u201dBjorn burst into laughter.\u00a0 That was a turn he\u2019d not expected.\u00a0 Was the woman seriously worried about him?\u00a0 He voiced his thoughts.\u00a0 \u201cHow unexpected!\u00a0 The lady who assaulted me is worried about me.\u201d\u201cAssaulted?!\u00a0 What do you mean?\u00a0 That day, when\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn\u2019s smile was soft.\u00a0 \u201cYou see, the rumors aren\u2019t false accusations, so you have no need to apologize.\u00a0 The situation is taken care of.\u00a0 Did you have anything else to say?\u201dA little dazed, Erna tried again to collect her thoughts.\u00a0 \u201cYes\u2026 yes\u2026\u201d she fumbled in her basket.\u00a0 \u201cHere, I brought\u2014I wanted to show you\u2026\u201dShe pulled something from her basket.\u00a0 Silver bell flowers.\u00a0 Bjorn opened his eyes wider as he identified them.\u201cAre you here to sell flowers?\u201d\u201cNo, of course not\u2014I mean, I am going to sell them\u2014but not to the Prince!\u201d\u00a0 Erna stammered, shaking her head.\u00a0 \u201cI am going to sell flowers and reimburse you for the trophy.\u00a0 I promise.\u201d\u201cMiss Hardy, are you going to sell flowers you\u2019ve made yourself?\u201d\u201cYes.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been making flowers for a long time; I can do it well.\u00a0 This is a flower I made,\u201d she added, presenting a silver bell to him shyly.\u00a0 The flower, delicately made and decorated with blue ribbons, was sophisticated enough to look real at first glance.\u00a0 To Erna\u2019s relief, Bjorn accepted it.\u201cYou are pretty good at it, Miss Hardy.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u00a0 Mr. Pent said the same thing,\u201d Erna said, innocently pleased at Bjorn\u2019s cynical remark.He shook with suppressed laughter.\u00a0 \u201cMr. Pent?\u201d\u201cHe owns a hat store in Soldau.\u00a0 He said he\u2019d buy my artificial flowers.\u201dBjorn considered, a bit of confusion in his eyes.\u00a0 Whether he could believe it or not, it seemed like Erna had detailed plans on how to make money and reimburse him for the trophy.\u00a0 \u201cYou are going to sell fake flowers to repay gold?\u201d he asked, still faintly sarcastic, gently waving the silver bell she\u2019d given him.\u00a0 \u201cWill you finish before your coffin comes?\u201d\u201cOf course, it will take a long time, but my flowers are selling at a higher price than you think,\u201d Erna said coldly, angry at his disbelief.Bjorn watched her closely, reevaluating his opinion of her.\u00a0 She\u2019d seemed shy and timid, but after all, she could say what she had a mind to say.\u201cMaking flowers takes skill, Prince.\u00a0 I don\u2019t mean to brag about myself, but I\u2019m good at it.\u00a0 I like flowers.\u201d\u201cSo it seems.\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn\u2019s eyes twinkled as they went from one flower to another on her dress.\u00a0 He burst suddenly into uncontrolled laughter.\u00a0 Though so different from the court dresses he was familiar with, this woman with her unsophisticated ambitions and skills was beautiful in her own way.\u201cWell,\u201d he said, finishing his laugh, \u201cyou\u2019ll do as you please.\u201d\u00a0 He shrugged half-heartedly.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t care about getting the trophy or its value from Erna.\u00a0 Bjorn had hoped to use it as leverage to win his bet\u2014right now, that was all Erna meant to him.\u00a0 The potential for a great victory at high stakes\u2026 after that, he didn\u2019t care if she disappeared forever.\u201cThank you!\u00a0 Thank you so much for understanding!\u201d\u00a0 Erna repeated her gratitude over and over, delighted.\u00a0 \u201cKeep the flower, Prince,\u201d she said, as he made a motion to hand it back.\u00a0 \u201cThink of it as a token of my promise.\u201dShe smiled brightly, facing him as she left the carriage.\u00a0 For a second, Bjorn idly wished he could keep the smile and return the flower.\u00a0 Then he put her out of his mind.Fortunately, Erna was able to reach home before dinner, though to do so, she had to run from the cab stop to Hardy Street.\u201cMiss!\u00a0 Where have you been?\u201d Lisa greeted her, the obvious worry on her face replaced instantly with relief.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lisa, I just left for a moment\u2026 a walk\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Erna stumbled through a lie, sitting down on a chair by her bedroom window, breathing heavily.\u00a0 After having seen Prince Bjorn, she didn\u2019t dare tell Lisa where she had really been.\u00a0 Fortunately, Lisa asked no more questions and focused on her job.As she dressed and had her hair done, Erna reflected on the day with a little excitement.\u00a0 She\u2019d done all she had meant to do.\u00a0 Hard as it was to adapt to this strange city, now with her flowers she felt that she wasn\u2019t reduced to a helpless fool.And the Prince had praised her bouquet.Erna was happier than ever as she reflected on that fact.\u00a0 She had given him her best flower.\u00a0 She hoped he\u2019d use it sometime as a boutonniere.\u00a0 She would be proud if the Prince found one of her flowers useful.He was a bad man.Despite the events of the day, Erna kept the same conclusion.\u00a0 On the basis of his reputation, there could be no doubt.But he had been kind to her.That was also a clear fact.He was a bad person, but a kind one.\u00a0 Erna smiled at her silly conclusion.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cWhy are you so late?\u201dLeonid started right off with a hard question.\u00a0 But then, Bjorn was a full hour late.\u00a0 Even in the way Leonid set down the book he\u2019d been reading, you could see a clear sign of disapproval.Bjorn glanced at the clock and smiled casually.\u00a0 He sat down at the table, opposite to Leonid.\u201cSomething unexpected delayed me,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cPrivate affairs.\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn\u2019s face tightened stubbornly and he showed no signs of explaining.Leonid sighed deeply.\u00a0 He knew how stubborn his twin brother was when he was in this mood.\u00a0 Just in time, the butler reported that dinner had been served.The two stood up to walk to the dinner table.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Leonid asked suspiciously, gesturing towards the flower Bjorn held.\u201cAh,\u201d Bjorn said, realizing that he was still holding Erna\u2019s flower.\u201cWere you with Gladys?\u201d\u00a0 Leonid\u2019s expression hardened as he noticed that the flower was a silver bell, the Princess\u2019s favorite flower.Bjorn tossed the flower into the ashtray, where the cigarette ash quickly stained its beauty.\u00a0 \u201cDinner,\u201d he said carelessly.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s go, Your Highness.\u201d\u00a0 He took the lead with a light step, as smooth and casual as ever.\u00a0 As if he\u2019d already forgotten Erna and her flowers.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was late,\u201d he said lightly.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll give you a break in the game.\u201dLeonid snorted, recalling his promise to play billiards after dinner.\u00a0 \u201cA Prince doesn\u2019t need a break,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u00a0 You\u2019re a Prince of billiards.\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn grinned.Just look at him!\u00a0 Leonid snorted again.\u00a0 He had to reflect again on his mother\u2019s request in order to keep his patience.\u00a0 Throughout dinner, he tried to get Bjorn to talk, listening for anything unusual or suspicious.The table was set on the terrace, where the fresh evening breeze of the midsummer night brought the garden scents wafting over the dinner.\u00a0 By the time the meal was over, Leonid had concluded that his mother was just a fussy old woman.\u00a0 Bjorn was the same as ever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

window was dazzling, and Erna squinted to see through it.\u00a0 Still, she sat upright, glancing out the shop window, undeterred by the glare.Erna moistened her lips with her now lukewarm tea and gently put her teacup back on the table.\u00a0 Though the cup was chipped and there were old stains all over the table cloth, the tea wasn\u2019t bad considering the price here.\u00a0 She was a little hungry, but couldn\u2019t bring herself to order any scones.\u00a0 After having been forced to eat so many scones that they tasted like sand in her mouth last week, she was ready to go without scones for a long time to come.Her look as she watched the world outside the window was one of anxious expectation.\u00a0 From here, she could see the Soldau Department Store from this particular seat in the tea shop.\u00a0 Every Tuesday, Erna sat here, watching just like today.After she had counted five passing wagons and dozens of passersby, Erna saw Lisa bouncing and waving excitedly.\u00a0 With a smile of relief, Erna raised her hand in greeting.\u00a0 The flower selling delivery must have gone smoothly.\u201cThey paid more today than last week!\u201d\u00a0 Lisa came rushing into the room, holding out her purse gleefully.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re so good at it, miss.\u00a0 You have an eye for it and careful hands.\u00a0 Mr. Pent said so.\u00a0 He said you\u2019re the best flower producer he\u2019s seen.\u201d\u201cThanks to your help,\u201d Erna said, smiling shyly and handing Lisa her share of the money.\u00a0 Knowing that Erna wouldn\u2019t let her refuse, Lisa accepted it gratefully.\u201cThank you miss, sincerely.\u201d\u201cYou have my sincere thanks too, Lisa,\u201d Erna said heartily, lifting the teapot and pouring out a cupful for Lisa.Lisa colored with pleasure as she took the cup.\u00a0 She smiled as she remembered Erna\u2019s strange request\u2014to help her sell flowers!\u00a0 Lisa hadn\u2019t been able to understand why a noble lady would want to make money with her hands.\u00a0 But Erna had explained that she needed money to help her grandmother in the countryside, and that was something Lisa could understand.\u00a0 Ever since she had started working, Lisa had sent half her salary to her family back in her hometown.So their artificial flower business grew from there and by now was prospering.\u00a0 At first, Lisa had only helped buy materials and deliver flowers, but she had quickly learned to make the simpler flowers herself.\u00a0 Lisa felt that she still wasn\u2019t a big help, but Erna always paid her a generous share.After they\u2019d finished their tea, the two went out into the busy street.\u00a0 They enjoyed their walk and talk, and they were back at the Hardy mansion before they knew it.\u201cLet\u2019s make more than usual this week,\u201d Lisa was saying, while Erna smiled at her ambition.Just then a maid approached them, running with cheeks hot from her hurry.\u201cMiss Erna!\u201d the maid cried.\u00a0 \u201cQuickly, go on in.\u00a0 The master is looking for you.\u201d\u201cFather is looking for me?\u201d\u201cYes!\u00a0 You must go to his study right away\u2026\u201d\u00a0 The little maid paused, out of breath and looking frightened, unable to finish her sentence.Erna exchanged a puzzled glance with Lisa, but hurried on through the front door.\u00a0 The air of the house chilled her skin and she felt like she\u2019d come out of the sunshine into a dark, somber atmosphere.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*As the legal review of overseas borrowing came to a close, the room of lawyers and investors fell into silence.\u00a0 Everyone\u2019s eyes turned towards Bjorn Dniester, sitting calmly at the head of the table.The bank\u2019s lawyer finally spoke.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ve heard our report,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cNow it\u2019s up to your Highness to decide.\u201d\u201cWhen you say that, I feel like an all-powerful god.\u00a0 I enjoy the feeling.\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn\u2019s laughter, fresh as the strong wind from the open window, hung in the air.It was hard to find traces of the debauchee in him, though he was so often criticized as such in the palace and city.\u00a0 No matter what may have been true of him at social clubs or parties, he always brought sharp judgment to his financial ventures.The middle-aged lawyer looked at the young Grand Duke Prince, a little startled at his last speech.When he was eighteen the Prince had taken his first steps into the capital market.\u00a0 He started investing in earnest after having learned all the could by selling the bonds handed down by his grandfather, King Phillip III.\u00a0 With many nobles still thinking that the capital market is far beneath them, the then Crown Prince\u2019s decision to participate had come as a shock.Had Bjorn inherited the crown as scheduled, he\u2019d have enriched the country, that was for sure.\u201cLet\u2019s go ahead as scheduled.\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn gave his answer in a cool voice just as a knock rang out on the office door.\u00a0 The unexpected visitor entered abruptly, showing to the astonished room of men the hard face of the Queen.Bjorn greeted his mother after he dismissed the lawyers, wondering what she had come for.\u00a0 It was rare for her to visit his Great House like this.\u201cI\u2019ll order tea, Your Majesty, Queen,\u201d he said.Isabel Dniester ignored him, exchanging remarks\u2014sarcastic on her side\u2014with the leaving guests.\u00a0 Her face grew darker as everyone left and she was alone with her son.\u201cCan you explain this to me, Bjorn?\u201d\u00a0 She sighed angrily and laid a newspaper she had brought on the table in front of him.\u00a0 The first page of today\u2019s tabloid was decorated with stories of the Grand Duke Prince.Bjorn took the paper quietly.\u00a0 The controversy around the assault case was what he had expected and half-wanted, but to his dismay he saw that the article was trying to relate the incident to Erna Hardy.According to testimony from an informant who asked to remain anonymous and who attended the Harbor Party, Prince Bjorn met a Lady, a beautiful member of the aristocracy, in a secret place that night.\u00a0 Having drunk a little too much, the Prince molested the lady and a scuffle broke out until our witness, passing by in the nick of time, dissuaded him.The tales of one-sided harassment are being contradicted by others, however.\u00a0 The noble Lady who was with the Prince that night may have been trying to seduce the Prince for some time.\u00a0 Rumors say she has liaisons with many gentlemen, and that she is the biggest obstacle to the reunion of Princess Gladys and Prince Bjorn.Has Prince Bjorn, the royal poisonous mushroom, committed yet another misdeed?\u00a0 Or has he fallen into the trap of a lady with her eyes on the position of Grand Duchess?Either way, the people\u2019s disappointment is clear.\u00a0 This newspaper has found that the majority of Lechenians want Prince Bjorn to apologize to Princess Gladys and reunite with her, an example the country can be proud of.Lechenians sincerely hope their wish will penetrate the walls of Schuber Palace.Bjorn laughed and dropped the paper.\u00a0 \u201cWho wrote this?\u00a0 He\u2019s the best gossip in the kingdom.\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn\u2019s amusement subsided and he had a sudden wish to buy this newspaper out completely and crush it in the bud.But he controlled himself to meet his mother\u2019s glance with a casual eye and say, \u201cI think we need to make the Palace walls a little higher.\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn smiled lightly, as though the accusations were irrelevant.\u201cIs that all you have to say?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little regrettable,\u201d Bjorn conceded, absentmindedly opening and closing the book of poems that lay on the table.\u00a0 \u201cI regret hitting Heinz\u2019s head; I should have gone for the mouth.\u201d\u00a0 No trace of any serious concern over the situation appeared in his face, much less in his words.\u201cBjorn!\u00a0 It\u2019s not something you can dismiss lightly!\u201d\u201cMother, it\u2019s not the first or second time something like this has happened.\u00a0 Gossip sells, so gossip will be sold.\u00a0 That\u2019s no reason to take it seriously.\u201d\u201cBut this time Gladys\u2019s name has been brought into it!\u00a0 And Miss Hardy\u2019s!\u201d\u00a0 Isabel DeNister\u2019s expression was stern.\u00a0 \u201cTwo well-born ladies of the court are having their names dragged through the mud because of your carelessness!\u00a0 Even if reunion with Gladys is impossible, you owe it to her not to willfully allow public opinion to form against her.\u201dBjorn shrugged.\u00a0 \u201cThe higher public opinion against me, the higher public opinion for her.\u00a0 And the worse the former Crown Prince looks, the stronger Leonid\u2019s legitimacy.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry too much, mother.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried about YOU right now, Bjorn!\u00a0 You, not Leonid.\u00a0 I\u2019m worried about my firstborn son\u2026 my most painful child\u2026\u201d\u00a0 The Queen\u2019s eyes, usually so calm, filmed over with tears.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s never been our desire to solidify the succession to the throne by throwing you away!\u00a0 You\u2019ve sacrificed enough\u2026 I want you to be happy, Bjorn.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m happy enough, mother.\u00a0 My life is going well enough for now.\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn spoke seriously, sincerely, trying to reassure his mother.Still she sighed repeatedly, not able to let go of the feeling that something was wrong.\u00a0 After a while she spoke again.\u00a0 \u201cAnd Lady Hardy?\u00a0 Why is her name involved?\u00a0 Are you considering a serious relationship with her?\u00a0 Tell me the truth.\u00a0 I can discuss it with your father.\u201d\u201cWith her?\u00a0 Not at all.\u201d\u00a0 Bjorn grinned and picked up his glass.He would have done the same for any woman.\u00a0 It had become a bit of a headache thanks to all this scandal from people who didn\u2019t know the circumstances at all, but at the end of the day, it was just a cheap rumor that would fizzle out over time.\u201cWhat are you going to do about the damage that Miss Hardy will suffer from this?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Bjorn shrugged lightly and let his eyes wander to the window.\u00a0 The clear sky and sunlight lit up his eyes.\u00a0 Her face, her bright smile, the ash-covered silver flower\u2014these all rose briefly above the landscape and then disappeared.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault.\u00a0 It\u2019s not my business.\u201dLooking out over the peaceful summer scenery, Bjorn stated his simple conclusion with a smile.\u00a0 Whatever he really thought, his mother understood that was the only answer he would give.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Reaching the end of the second floor hallway, Erna took a deep breath and opened the study door.\u00a0 Sitting side by side on the sofa were the Viscount and Viscountess Hardy\u2014and the Viscount looked very angry.\u201cFather\u2026 I heard you\u2019ve been looking for me\u2026\u201d\u201cYou slut!\u201d\u00a0 Viscount Hardy jumped up and cut Erna off in a voice like thunder.\u00a0 \u201cYou said the reason you left the Harbor Street party early was because you were sick!\u00a0 You dare to deceive us with your innocent face!\u201d\u201cFather?\u201d\u201cTell me the truth, or it will be worse for\u00a0 you!\u00a0 Were you with the Grand Duke, Erna?\u201d\u00a0 He yanked a newspaper off the table and waved it in her face.The headline\u2014 The Real Truth of Prince Bjorn\u2019s Fight \u2014stared Erna in the face and she turned pale.\u00a0 The Viscount, who had been watching his daughter\u2019s face closely, burst into a villainous laugh.Erna opened her mouth, trying to explain.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2014that\u2019s not\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe Viscount\u2019s big hand flew into Erna\u2019s face.\u00a0 Stunned, Erna only processed what was happening as she heard the sound of a loud slap on her cheek.Another slap.\u00a0 Staggering under the blow, Erna lost her balance and fell to the carpet.\u00a0 The Viscount flung the crumpled newspaper down in front of her.Blood dripped from her cut lips onto the paper, over the Prince\u2019s picture.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She\u2019s a libertine, if the rumours are anything to go by, I don\u2019t care about some party.\u201d Walter shouted.Erna looked down at the newspaper on the floor, but couldn\u2019t quite read the small words of the article. She was able to grasp the context and wondered how such a petty rumour could be considered news worthy. It seemed to be enough to convince her father though, who wouldn\u2019t give Erna the chance to explain anything.Erna looked up at her red faced father and was pained to see the anger there. She felt so humiliated she could cry, but tears did not flow. It may be said that she didn\u2019t even know how to cry any more.\u201cWhy do you have to get greedy and do every possible wrong thing? A scandal like this, right when the random is only going up. All these good marriages we\u2019re going to miss because of this.\u201d Walter raged on.The words buzzed around Erna\u2019s head, his anger pouring out at her, but she looks up at him blank faced. He might as well have been muted, all save one thing.My father wants to sell his own daughter into marriage?Erna didn\u2019t know what people hissed into the ears of those that would listen, hiding their shame behind their hands as they spread vicious rumours of her. She didn\u2019t really care, they were not true and that was all that mattered. The fact that her father did hurt the most.It is the wish of many parents to find a suitable match for their child. To marry their daughters into a good family, or power and money. Her father was the same, it would seem and Erna was never given a choice in the matter. At least, he never denied any outstretched hand that reached for Erna\u2019s hand, no matter what predicament it put her in. She had no intention of getting married.\u201cAm I really only here, at Hardy Manor, so that you can sell me to the highest bidder?\u00a0 Is this really how you treat your own daughter?\u201d Erna said.Her voice was the softest whisper and she doubted her father even heard her, but she locked him with a stare that shot a cold tingle up Walters spine. Erna got to her feet as the Viscount sighed roughly.\u201cPlease father, don\u2019t do this to me.\u201d Her voice trembled from the fear of facing her father, but she stood firmly. \u201cHow can you treat me like this? I know you\u2019ve ignored me for so long, but I am still your daughter. How can you be so heartless?\u201d\u201cThis was your idea. You chose to come here for the year, or did you really think that would be enough to pay off the debt? Have those eccentric old fools raised an even bigger fool?\u201d Walter snorted.\u201cYou don\u2019t have the right to insult them, they are better people than you ever will be.\u201d Erna snorted back.\u201cNo, I have the right afforded me as your father and I am more than qualified to comment.\u201d Walter shouted, bristling with pride. \u201cThey would have you growing old, as they are, wasting away in some decrepit courner of some forgotten village. At least I am concerned with a real future for you, which includes finding you a good marriage. So stop with this immaturity, stop doing everything wrong and start following instructions. Do you understand?\u201dErna was stoic in the face of her fathers fury. Even as he leaned over her, red face inches from hers, the smell of his hot breath coming strong, she remained stubborn. She could see his eyes becoming more and more fierce as they looked at her, trembling as she was, but she stood straight and did not back down.\u201cIf you slip up one more time, I will sell that country house. How\u2019s that?\u201d Walter said, calmness not quite reaching the extent of his words.\u201cYou can\u2019t do that, you promised the house to me.\u201d Her poise broke and she shouted. Walter smiled at her.\u201cThat\u2019s only when your part of the arrangement has been fulfilled.\u201d Walter said.\u201cHow can you be so mean.\u201d Erna almost stamped her foot.\u201cMean? You\u2019re only a penniless girl, Lady Baden.\u201d Walter mocked and raised his hand to slap Erna.\u201cHoney, stop, please.\u201d Brenda cooed at Walter.She was nervousely looking around as she reached up and grabbed her husbands arm. Walter backed down, but not before giving a swift kick at the bastard newspaper.\u201cThink carefully before you act, Erna, no matter how stupid you might be, I hope that meaning is not lost on you.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Unbelievable. Erna Hardy.Bjorn was enjoying a good cigar on the terrace of the social club when he saw the young woman. He frowned and pulled himself out of his seat. He leant on the railing and puffed out a cloud of thick, white smoke. He sniffed at the intoxicating woody aroma as he watched Erna walking closer.He watched her as she stopped under the clock tower and look down at her toes, then move off again. There was no sign of the maid that was always glued to Erna\u2019s side.He checked the time on his pocket watch, slippe it back into its breast pocket and adjusted the sit of his wide brimmed hat. It was late, to late for a member of the nobility to be out on their own. Rumors would spread.The Hardy\u2019s were rife with scandal these days. It was so loud it became impossible to ignore and he started to wonder how she had been faring in the quagmire.As if thinking about her made her suddenly aware of him, she looked up at him. Despite the darkness, and the distance, Bjorn felt like their eyes met. Erna froze in place and a long moment seemed to pass between them, before Erna looked back at her toes.Without warning, Erna turned and hurridly walked the other way. Bjorn didn\u2019t take insult from it and simply laughed it off. The woman was the centre of much gossip, he doubted she wanted to add to that pyre. What would the snobs make of her meeting the Prince in the dead of night?It might also be because he was the Prince. It must be a lot to take in for a simple country girl, who grew up in a village where the biggest celebrity was probably a problematic goose on the village green.Bjorn watched Erna dissapear into the night before turing to head back inside the club. It was its busy period, but even still, Heinz was stood all alone. Being the editor for the newspaper responsible for a lot of the gossip around the Erna girl, its no wonder people don\u2019t want to talk to him and have their laundry aired the next morning.\u201cCome on, we\u2019re waiting on you.\u201d Peter said, noticing Bjorn come in from the terrace, he was loading up for a new game of cards.Bjorn took his seat and knocke off the ash build up. The group loved to pass jibes between themselves, scratching at each other with blunt barbs and casual insults. They could not touch him though, not that Bjorn would have minded, but it was kind of an unwritten rule amoungst them.He moistened his lips with a sip of brandy and looked at his cards. They were difficult to read, their numbers and pictures slid from his mind as he considered them. All thoughts were turned to Erna as she walked away, but not toward the Hardy family mansion.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Pavel was not able to get out of Lehman Street until late. He refused a lift home and opted to walk the streets. He liked walking the streets when they were like this. Quiet and with a fresh wind blowing in. He liked to use this time to order his thoughts and make sense of the world.The second daughter of Count Lehman was an avid appreciator of art. She was well known for endorsing artists and thanks to Pavel\u2019s recent victory at the Royal Academy of Art, her attention was firmly fixed on him.He had been invite to a very special dinner, accompanied by some very wealthy sponsors and he was able to sell some of his work for a very high price. It was the right time to be happy, in many ways, but it wasnt just selling his work, but deep down his heart was heavy. Erna\u2019s name had been thrown around a lot lately, but not on good terms.She was pretty much the topic of discussion at the dinner, the scandal between her and the Grand Duke. The nobels all sympathised with Princess Gladys and were heavil critical of Erna. Not so much the Duke Lehman, who was constantly ourtaged about his future wife being spoken about like that.Lehmans daughters were the worst culprits for the gossip, they hoped that providing harsh criticisim of the women, the Count would change his mind about marrying her.Every time he saw Count Lehman that evening, he couldn\u2019t help but think of Erna. It was hard for him to understand how Erna had been promised to the dusty, grey haired old man. The thought of his shrivelled up hands touching her rankled at Pavel\u2019s heart, but there was no point in feeding that fire, there was nothing he could do to help his long time friend.It was a difficult battle, to stay in control and not let a random outburst of anger in Erna\u2019s defence boil over. He would het his own back on them, for Erna, by taking their money and thats what he focused on. No matter how many times Erna, the Poison Mushroom Prince, or scandal was mentioned in the same breath, he couldn\u2019t let it boil his blood.He should have paid more attention to Erna. He knew filling himself up with regret was pointless, but he couldn\u2019t help himself, the girl had a hold of him and with her talk of going back to Burford at the end of the year, filled him with hope.He loosened his tie and stuffed it into his pocket. He hated the thing, it always felt like it was choking him, but it was necessary if you wanted to be taken seriously. Now, able to breath, he felt like he needed to talk to Erna.He had to be careful, one careless act and he could lose Erna. Viscount Hardy had brought his daughter to the city to sell her off in marriage. In a few days he would get the money for the paintings and so he would be able to help, if only a little.He hoped that if she could get back to Burford, she might be able to have a more peaceful life and that was how he was going to help. He was going to raise the money to buy her out of this arranged marriage. If only Viscount Hardy would let Erna go.Pavel arrived at his house and made to head up the steps that lead to the front door. Coming home, his self contemplation flittered away and he felt all the stress and worry melt away for a moment. Just in time to notice a shadowy form sat on the top step. Huddled within themselves.Pavel was inteding to pass them by, desperate to get in and get something to eat, but his good nature niggle at him and he stopped in front of the shadow.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Pavel asked nervousely, hoping he wasnt about to get stabbed.The figure looked up at him.\u201cErna?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I shouldn\u2019t have trusted my father.\u201dErna opened her mouth after a long while to take a drink of the milk that was given to her. The glass was still warm, as she squeezed it in her hands, the bruising still painful. Her head was a little calmer, now that she had time to order her thoughts. She didn\u2019t want anything to do with her father any more.\u201cI am so sorry to trouble you like this.\u201d Erna said after taking another sip of milk.\u00a0As she regained her composure, she turned to face Pavel. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one that has taken care of me\u2026\u201d\u00a0She bowed her head as she let the words trail off. She remembered seeing Bjorn on her way over, their eyes meeting across the span of the square, maybe he would help her. The thought melted away as soon as he appeared, she didn\u2019t want the Prince knowing about this.\u201cNo need to thank me, like I said, anytime you need help just come and find me.\u201d Pavel said with a warming smile.\u00a0He got up and took Erna\u2019s empty glass and returned it to the kitchen. He was gone for a while and when he returned, he was holding a large blanket. Erna\u2019s eyes went wide when she recognised it.\u201cMy Grandmother\u2019s blanket.\u201d Erna smiled as Pavel draped it over her shoulders. The split lip hurt and was very bitter, but Erna did not stop smiling.\u201cYeah, it was a congratulatory gift from Baroness Baden.\u201d Pavel said.\u00a0\u00a0As he sat back down, the weak smile melted away. He thought about the old woman when she gave him the blanket. She had told him to use it always, even in the summer and especially in the city, where disease was rife.Pavel\u2019s disposition quickly became one of hot anger again as he brought his mind back to the present. He could not help but feel resentment for Viscount Hardy, for treating the jewel of the Hardy family as he did.\u201cWould you like me to take you back to Burford?\u201d It was an impulsive question, but that did not mean Pavel did not mean it.\u201cI would love to, I want to, but\u2026I can\u2019t right now.\u201d Erna said, eyes downcast. \u201cIf I break from my contract, we would have to leave our home in Baden.\u201d\u201cContract?\u201d\u201cYes, getting married, as per my fathers request.\u201d Erna\u2019s knuckles turned white as she gripped the hem of the blanket.\u201cBut you can\u2019t stay here like this.\u201d\u201cI know. I wont let me father sell me off to some disgusting old pervert. I will find a way.\u201d\u201cYou could always give up the house. I know how you value the place, but you can\u2019t tell me you value it more than your own life.\u201d Pavel moved closer to Erna and put an arm around her.\u201cBecause then we would have nowhere else to go.\u201d Erna looked at him with sad, puffy red eyes.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t that Erna had not thought about it, she had given it a great deal of thought. Even if they scraped together all the money that they could, it was a lot of responsibility for the two of them. She also had to think of her two maids, who had become more like family than anything else, especially her father. Then there was trying to find somewhere decent to rent.\u201cI can help you. I will get plenty of money soon, from selling my paintings. It\u2019s not a whole heap of money, but it will be enough for you and your Grandmother to find somewhere out in the country, away from this place.\u201d\u201cNo, Pavel, you can\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, call it a lifelong loan. You can pay me back any time between now and a hundred years time, no interest.\u201d\u00a0Pavel finally conveyed the thoughts that had been plaguing him since the first time he saw Erna in the city.\u201cNo, you can\u2019t do that.\u201d Erna pleaded.\u201cYes I can, it\u2019s my money and I can do what I want with it, and I choose to help you.\u201d Pavel had expected this reaction from Erna, she was a respectful young lady and he calmly carried on trying to convince her to accept his help. \u201cThink realistically, Erna, your father will sell you before the end of Fall, before even that if possible. It is nigh on impossible for you to raise enough money before then.\u201dErna could not deny that Pavel raised a very good point, but he didn\u2019t have to be so cold about it. Pavel quietly took a deep breath and looked into Erna\u2019s fierce blue eyes. She was speechless, he could see her working things out in her head. Was he being too reckless?Pavel knew that running away like this would leave a nasty scar on the aristocracy, and she would never be welcomed back, but at least it\u2019s a chance for her to get away and what Erna needed right now was a way out.\u201cJust think about it, about getting away from your father.\u201d Pavel said.\u00a0He wondered if he had crossed the line; he was always very conscious of Erna as a nobility and he was a mere common as muck painter. He respected those boundaries, while nurturing Erna\u2019s friendship.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna Hardy had disappeared.She was not present at any social gathering, she had not been seen down by the Hardy estate or downtown. The Viscount and his wife did make a statement that the girl was bed ridden with some ailment, but no one believed the story.\u201cWhat are we going to do if she doesn\u2019t turn up to the rowing competition?\u201d Peter said, through a yawn.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me she won\u2019t be there for the greatest event of the summer.\u201d Said a man Bjorn had never gotten the name of.\u201cIt\u2019ll be hard if she\u2019s so ill she has to stay in bed.\u201d Peter said, still yawning.\u201cHealth problems isn\u2019t just about health.\u201d Leonard said. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s taking a break from all the scandal, waiting for things to die down.\u201dIt seemed, at that moment, that everyone in the social club looked at Bjorn, who was calmly eating an apple and only half paying attention to the conversation. He was watching the entrance like a hawk.\u201cGive it up, Bjorn, no matter how stupid he might be, he ain\u2019t crazy enough to show his face.\u201d Peter said.\u00a0He finally finished yawning and was pouring a drink for Bjorn. As if the universe was determined to prove Peter wrong, Robin Heinz waltzed into the social club.\u201cHe is crazy.\u201d Leonard said sadly.Bjorn calmly bit into his apple and only rose when the group had settled down. His footsteps were loud as he approached Robin Heinz, sitting at a table of loud gentlemen sharing stories and jokes. The atmosphere had generally been cheerful, but everything went silent when Bjorn stood next to Heinz.\u201cLong time no see, Heinz.\u201d Bjorn said.Heinz had tried his best to ignore Bjorn, turning his back on him and burying his nose in the tabloid that had been the centre of many jokes made at the table. Bjorn lowered himself into the chair next to Heinz and everyone watched.\u201cHere, have a drink.\u201d Bjorn said and grabbed the bottle of wine the waiter had just brought over. He poured out a splash into the tumbler in front of Heinz. He then snatched the paper out of Heinz\u2019s hands and eyed the article; he already knew what he was looking for, but made a pantomime of reading it first.\u201cLady Hardy, who had seduced me first, had also seduced the Grand Duke. It was her intention to create a rift between the Grand Duke and myself. That is why the fight with the Grand Duke occurred, it was coercion from Lady Hardy who sought to test her potential suitors, in some sordid game only she knows the rules of, to entertain her bored little mind.\u201dMore and more people had speculated that Heinz was the one who had instigated a fight with the Grand Duke, throwing the first punches. In order to save face, Heinz abused his role in the tabloids to justify himself and use Erna as a scapegoat. It was a pretty solid strategy as he knew no one would willingly take Erna\u2019s side in the matter.\u201cIs that really what happened?\u201d Bjorn said with false intrigue. \u201cMy memory is a little fuzzy.\u201d Bjorn signalled the waiter, who came over and filled his glass.The mood in the social club was usually calm, providing a place to relax, especially during the long, hot summer days when the mood became languid, but things turned tense very quickly.Robin Heinz, who could now feel the bind he was in, looked about the room without making eye contact with anyone. Bjorn moved to be directly in front of Robin Heinz, providing him no room to avoid the Grand Duke. The silence from the man was grating against Bjorn\u2019s nerves and his patience was nowhere near deep enough.\u201cI\u2019m getting impatient, Heinz,\u201d Bjorn said, putting down the half empty glass of water. \u201cIf you continue to ignore me, you\u2019ll make me look like an intruder to an otherwise pleasant little gathering here.\u201d Bjorn gently placed his hands on Robin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDid you honestly think you\u2019d never see me again, especially here?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell do you want me to say?\u201d Heinz blurted.\u201cNothing grandiose.\u201d Bjorn removed his hand from Heinz\u2019s shoulder and stood up.Heinz started to breathe properly and at that moment, the chair collapsed from under him and his world spun around. When he opened his eyes again, he was staring up at the ceiling. Bjorn came into view and stared down at him with intense grey eyes. Just like that night, he was smiling.\u201cYou, you,\u201d Heinz stammered.\u00a0 He tried to get up and wailed when Bjorn\u2019s foot came down heavily on his chest and pinned him to the floor.\u201cYou said it yourself, we\u2019re rivals, aren\u2019t we? Rivals fighting for the affection of the same woman. I\u2019m sure you said something like that.\u201d\u201cBjorn, you\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, you didn\u2019t know, did you? This is how I treat my rivals.\u201d\u00a0Bjorn grabbed the bottle from the table and leaning over the stricken Heinz, he poured the contents over the red face of Robin Heinz.\u00a0He smiled as Robin Heinz struggled and screamed for assistance, but no one came to help and Bjorn did not stop until the bottle was empty. He took his foot from the chest of the pathetic man and wandered back to his own party as if nothing had happened.Heinz laid on the floor for a long while, wailing at the ceiling. The rest of the lounge was abuzz with chatter and whispers.When Bjorn was finally done at the social club, he went to his carriage and the waiting footmen. These hot summer days had made him lethargic and lazy, it was nice to get some excitement back in his life. He felt energised.He had glee in his heart again as the carriage trundled along the road, back to the palace. When it turned down Tara Boulevard, he caught a glimpse of Lisa, Erna\u2019s maid. She was carrying a very large bundle alone.\u201cHmm, Erna is still absent.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She moved mechanically, as if just going through the motions and Lisa watched her. She was filled with wonder as she watched her beautiful mistress make beautiful corsages.She spent her days quietly in the Hardy Mansion, as per her fathers request, who had forbidden her to go outside until all her wounds had healed. Lisa would have been afraid for her lady, who constantly stared off into space, but at least she was keeping busy.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry Lisa, I hope you did not wait long.\u201d Erna said, noticing Lisa\u2019s presence.When she lovingly placed the newly completed rose in its box, she completed another order. She had three times more orders this week as she did last week.\u201cI think you\u2019re over doing it miss.\u201d Lisa said.Lisa looked at Erna with apprehension. The cuts and bruises of her fathers beating had fully healed, but Erna still looked haggard and drawn, mostly from all the extra work she was doing in the evenings.\u201cYou need sleep.\u201d Lisa added.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, being locked away isn\u2019t boring if you concentrate on your past times.\u201d Erna smiled.Lisa glossed over the conversation with a smile and picked up the next big bundle for the department store. When she left, Erna was left alone in the silent room. She did not notice. She had her desk situated under the large window and she stared out of it, at the fading flowers. They made her realise that summer would be over soon, her ordeal would be over soon.As if like clockwork, Erna ran through the numbers again, the dates, the sleeps until the date that she had promised Pavel. The date was all that supported her life right now.It was a shameless act, but she had decided to accept Pavel\u2019s help. Running away in the middle of the night was never the dignified thing to do, but there are moments where exception need to be made. It was a lesson taught by her father, though without meaning.Her father had lied to her, he had conned her into coming to the city and only sought his own profit off her back. When she reflected on this, heat rose up in her and she could feel the anger boil over.During her time at the house, she came to realised her father had lost a lot of money through being swindled himself. His fortune declined sharply and he had plans to sell his daughter on the wedding market to make up for his losses. It was shallow trick she would have seen if she had been more diligent.She was a crushed fool at the bottom of a swindlers food chain. She was angry at herself for being so naive, her pride was hurt and she could not sleep. She could sense the disappointment in her Grandfather, who had been so proud of how smart his Grandchild was. He had said Erna was a good student.She got up with determination, standing proud and strong. She looked like she was going to jump out of the window and fly away. Instead, she grabbed some supplied and carried on making the corsages. Even if she was going to run away, until that day, she was going to face her duties with pride, that included getting these orders filled.She wanted to say good bye to the naive Erna Hardy of the past, to be less complacent and to stare adversity with stubborn defiance.She noticed the pile of letters in the bin. They had all been letters asking for Lady Hardy\u2019s hand, to conduct courtship rituals and other such pompous traditions. Why was it so hard for these people to accept rejection? She had sent letters of rejection to every bachelor, but they still sent the same tired letters, inviting her to social parties, or fireworks displays. They can very well take themselves to see the fireworks.Lisa said it would bring shame if a lady was unable to find a gentleman escort on that day. She suggested not rejecting the courting letters out of hand and maybe consider one or two of them. Erna couldn\u2019t believe Lisa had really suggested going boating, in the night, with a man she didn\u2019t know? She would rather be an undignified lady, than uphold that tradition. Besides, fifteen more days.With each letter sent by the same person, Erna used a thicker pen, bolder letters and bigger, to underline her stubbornness in rejecting these letters. They never seemed to acquest the point however.\u201cMiss, miss! Look, its the Palace, the Schubert Palace.\u201d Lisa came rushing into the room without knocking.\u201cCalm down Lisa, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cHer Majesty\u2026The Queen is looking for you.\u201d Lisa said, wide eyed.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*It was in the afternoon, when the sun warm golden disc, that the carriage carrying Bjorn and Leonid trundled out fo the main gate of Schuber Palace. They were off to visit the Duchess of Arsene at her summer palace. Originally it was meant to be the Queen and Leonid, but it was changed at the last minute.\u201cYour Grandmother is very fond of you, Bjorn.\u201d The Queen said.Bjorn had been woken up right before lunch, to his mothers knocking on the door. She then proceeded to lecture him about late nights and drunken games. It seemed that the Queen sent him off to visit his Grandmother as some form of punishment.As his mother said, the Duchess loved her first Grandson more than anyone, so it was a little thing to bare this annoyance for a little while. It didn\u2019t help that Bjorn was just as stubborn in matters as his mother and that annoyance quickly became hatred, as they bounced along the road.\u201cThanks to you, it should be a fun evening.\u201d Leonid smirked.It was hard to judge Bjorn\u2019s mood at times, he remained so stoic at times, with a glint of a random smile. Even Leonid, who had dedicated his life amusing himself with Bjorn\u2019s discomfort, found it hard to judge his brothers mood.\u201cAt least I will get a decent dinner out of it.\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cOnly because she still loves you, despite everything, you\u2019re still her favourite.\u201d Leonid said dejectedly.Leonid referred to the incident with Princess Gladys and Bjorn felt heat rise against Leonid for bringing it up. The Duchess had barely spoken to Bjorn since the divorce. She accepted him at the table, tolerated his company when she must, but she was not as communicable as she used to be.\u201cYou could always tell her the truth.\u201d Leonid went on.He sat forward, hands clasped like he was at prayer. Bjorn looked out of the carriage window so that his brother wouldn\u2019t see the dejected snarl. Beside the Lars royal family, there were only three people in the whole kingdom that knew the truth. The king, the queen and Leonid. Four if you count the bastard Gladys cheated on him with.The Duchess resented him for his act. It might not have been so bad if he had just divorced Gladys, but his abdication from the throne, making Leonid the Crown Prince, seemed to properly upset the Duchess. Leonid tried to refuse the position, claiming that Bjorn was a much better suit.When ever he thought about the situation, Leonid felt terrible for his twin brother. He could never be like Bjorn, the one who taught Leonid all about how a single person could be heartless, responsible, distrusting and considerate all at once.The carriage moved across the bridge, Leonid had buried his nose in a book and Bjorn was still staring out of the window, not really looking out at anything, but looking in. The bridge reminded him of the time he met with Erna, to return his coat, right before the Heinz scandal blew up.\u201cWhat were you going to do if I didn\u2019t show?\u201d\u00a0Bjorn had asked Erna.\u201cCome back tomorrow, I suppose.\u201d\u00a0Erna replied. She answered like it was a matter of course. \u201cThere is only one road out of the palace and to the city, so I figured you\u2019d come past here eventually.\u201dHer own logic had frustrated Bjorn, he had not expected her to be, he felt like she was a match for his wits and she was fiercely independent. When they had arrived at her street, she hoped off the carriage like it was some ordinary thing and refused to let Bjorn see her off. She was so proud of the fact that she knew how to ride a station wagon, she made it sound like some great achievement. She left a modest farewell, like she was saying good bye to her grocer and crossed to the other side of the street.When Bjorn moved on, the woman didn\u2019t occupy much more of his thoughts, or at least, he didn\u2019t think she did. As the carriage passed the middle of the bridge and his mind was cast back to that day, he realised his thoughts had lingered on her more than he realised.\u201cWho is she?\u201d He muttered to himself.Leonid looked up from his book and out the window. \u201cHmm, who?\u201d He said, but Bjorn ignored him as he caught the site of a brown haired woman. He felt anxiety race up his body. The disappointment stung as he saw it was only a woman that reminded him of Erna.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*A table had been set up for the Queens guest deep in the garden annex. Isabel Dniester, the Queen, greeted Erna as she was escorted by footmen. It was as if they were two close companions set to enjoy afternoon tea together.\u201cYou may go.\u201d The Queen waved away the footmen. As the servants left, the garden was drapped in an awkward silence.\u201cShall we have tea.\u201d The Queen said and offered Erna a seat.\u201cOh, yes, of course your majesty.\u201dErna hurriedly took her seat and picked up the tea cup, waiting patiently for the Queen to take the first sip, she then took hers. She was frightfully aware of her trembling hands.The Queen examined Erna Hardy over the lip of her tea cup, worried that the poor girl was going to spill her tea and burn herself. This was a very different encounter than when they had met at the social gathering. Probably because of the lack of the old fashioned dress and make up.A couple days ago, the Queen had sent out investigators to covertly gather all the information they could about Erna Hardy. They returned with a thick report of the woman\u2019s history, information of the two families, Baden and Hardy and all the gossip and scandal they had been involved in.Erna was a lady that sported the Hardy name, but she had mostly been raised by Baden\u2019s. A righteous and good family of aristocrats. Although they had fallen on hard times, they lived without losing dignity.The information in the report claimed that Erna Hardy was a very different person to what the rumours suggested. So curiosity took the better of the Queen and she decided that she wanted to meet Erna in person.\u201cWhat is you r relationship to my son, Bjorn.\u201d The Queen asked.Erna looked up from her tea cup, confusion spattered her features and looked at the Queen with big, beautiful, deep blue eyes. It was no wonder she had caught the attention of all the socialites.\u201cTell me what happened between the two of you, Miss Hardy and you had better not try to deceive me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Viscount and his wife would be returning soon and if Erna was not at the mansion\u2026Lisa shuddered at the thought. She hated the idea that her Mistress would be punished because of her mistake.What could she have done though? She couldn\u2019t very well hide the letter from the Queen. If Erna never showed up to her summons, she would have been in greater trouble, Lisa doubly so.The turmoil swirling inside Lisa left her feeling something ominous was about to descend upon her and she was powerless to stop it. It drove her to an irritability that has her stuck pacing up and down the same short bit of road.When she had received the message that someone was looking for Lady Hardy\u2019s maid, she thought it was going to be yet another dashing young noble with a letter of heart felt emotions, accompanied by an overly elaborate bouquet.What she found was a fancy carriage, with a stern faced footman waiting at the foot of the step. He sounded like the most impatient person Lisa had ever met.\u201cThe Queen has requested Lady Hardy\u2019s presence.\u201d He said.Lisa didn\u2019t know if she should have apologised to the man, but she ran straight to Erna with the message. When Erna got to the carriage, everything moved so fast Lisa didn\u2019t have time to process what just happened.The footman ushered Erna into the carriage, Lisa didn\u2019t see anyone else in there and before she could ask, the carriage was away.She should have followed them, or maybe even convince Erna to take her to the palace with her, but she didn\u2019t, she just stood on the pavement and watched them leave.Her insides boiled in frustration. Lisa couldn\u2019t handle the anxiety twisting her up. She felt like a child\u2019s wind up toy that had been wound up too far. The stress of being held in that ready to go position was exhausting. It all finally came out in a sigh and she sat down on the curb.Her nerve spiked when she heard the clip clop and the rattle of carriage wheels. At first she was elated, Erna had finally returned from the palace. Then her dread took over, what if the Viscount had returned already?Relief washed over her as she saw the same carriage that had kidnapped Erna come around the bend, she nearly fainted.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The sound of the scissors constant rasping never ceased, except late at night when the wielder needed rest.Erna looked down blankly at the desk, her mind fleeing from her for a moment. The sound of the scissors was a hypnotic note that distracted her from pretty much everything. She placed the scissors down and tried to remember what flower she was making.\u201cRose.\u201d Erna whispered.She massaged her aching hands and throbbing joints. Pergola covered in rose vines in full bloom, calm waves and the sound of seagulls from afar. The memory suddenly came to her. Memories of table covered in white lace cloth, beautiful ceramics and the surreal face of her Grandmother.What would her Grandmother say if she knew her Granddaughter had met with the Queen? Erna thought about writing to her, but then stopped herself, what would her Grandmother think when she leaned why Erna had met with the Queen?The urge to write to her Grandmother soon faded. She would faint to learn Erna had met with the Queen to explain the scandal between her and Prince Bjorn. It would not go down well, especially so soon after the divorce and abdication from the throne.The ache in her hands did not subside, so Erna decided it was probably a good time to stop. She stood up to lean over and open the window. A cool night breeze chilled Erna\u2019s skin and ties a shawl over her nightgown. It felt like a dream as she leaned on the window sill and stared down into the dark garden.It felt like only yesterday she was living a rather mundane life out in the country. Then her Grandfather passed away and almost over night they were on the verge of losing their home. Erna was forced to come to her father for help and then all this scandal took over. So many incredible things happening in just one season.And then that whole thing earlier, with the Queen. As Erna recalled that conversation, she let out a deep sigh.She had told the Queen everything, in as much detail as she could, about her and Prince Bjorn. At times her mind went blank, but she never lied or knowingly distorted the truth in any way. Erna hoped it would help clear up any misinformation.\u201cAre you really saying Bjorn wanted that?\u201d\u00a0The Queen said, after she heard everything.The first time the Queen expressed any emotion, or thought, on the matter was when Erna told of the lost gold antler trophy and how Bjorn had agreed when Erna offered to pay for it.Erna spoke like she faced a terribly biased jury and she was pouring her heart out to prove her innocence. She even told the Queen that she was going to pay off the debt by selling corsages. The hope that a lady of aristocracy would stoop to such a level to pay off a debt, would it be enough to convince the Queen she meant no ill?\u201cSo, you really sold artificial flowers to pay off the trophy, Bjorn really accepted that? My Bjorn, the Prince?\u201dErna wasn\u2019t sure what the Queen wanted her to say, she seemed completely disbelieving. She smiled dejectedly and left it at that.Once that was done, her time with the Queen passed like any run of the mill afternoon tea Erna had attended. The Queen skilfully led a daily conversation as if talking to a long lost friend and they were catching up on old times. The Prince\u2019s name was not mentioned again.Erna closed the window and shuffled back over to the desk. Her hands still hurt, but they were no longer so bad that they kept her from her work.If you are soaked in pointless sentiment, you will only deepen your depression. If you work, you can reduce your debt.Erna continued to work as she repeated the mantra in her head.She knew that selling artificial flowers would never be enough to cover the cost of the trophy and then add the money Pavel had leant her, she would have to decorate the hats of every women in the city if she wanted to pay every one back.This was the only solution Erna could think of, so she decided to do her best. It might take her whole life, but she had to deal with these things, no matter how overwhelming they were.Erna was used to the struggle, her whole life had been one challenge after another. Sometimes she feels helpless, but other times, there is always something that can be done, no matter how small or insignificant. Erna knew she should never give up, especially not on herself.By the time Erna was done making the last petal, it was well past midnight. Other than the few hours with the Queen, she had dedicated the whole day to making flowers.After tidying everything away, Erna went to wash up before laying down on the bed. It was easy for her to fall asleep. Thanks to the fatigue of the work and the emotional drain on the afternoon, Erna slept the night away. She was even able to create harmony with her dream, which was of a flower the size of the city.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cLook over there, she\u2019s finally here.\u201d Peter declared.He was examining the crowed with wide eyes, scrutinizing every face he could, daring not risk missing the opportunity to see the young lady that was the main character for today\u2019s festival. The Hardy family had just entered the stand and with them was Erna Hardy.\u201cI knew it.\u201dWhile laughing at the crowds reaction, Leonard was also relieved. If Erna had not shown up once in awhile, all the young lads would have degenerated into mindless idiots, obsessing over mythical phantoms.\u201cWell, Miss Hardy, I am glad to see you don\u2019t have any trouble with boats.\u201d Peter said.\u201cPah, do you think you have the skill to ride your boat?\u201d Leonard scoffed.\u201cOf course.\u201d Even though ridicule was in his eyes, Peter stood firm.Among the young gentlemen who were taking part in the bet, Peter sent the most letters and flowers to Lady Hardy. From that, he got the most replies, which Peter took to mean she was more interested in him. The pride of his letters is the one preceding the one he sent asking after her health. Despite the reply containing a firm rejection, like the others, it did contain a little more, only to state that she was well.\u201cDo you really think you can entice a woman so embroiled in a scandal with Prince Bjorn Dniester?\u201d Leonard teased.\u201cOh that? Its fine, Bjorn is just using her to get at his ex-wife. I\u2019m different, we have a genuine, emotional bond.\u201d Peter said proudly.Thinking about the large pile of personal replies from Erna, Peter really thought he stood a chance, but little did he realise, he and Erna were not on the same boat.\u201cWell, here comes your rival now.\u201d Leonard pointed.He giggled like a school boy who just heard a funny fart joke. The Royal Family was coming down the narrow path from the palace to the riverside. The whole family came down to the VIP seats, all with the exception of Leonid, who participated in the games. The crowd applauded and cheered, charging the atmosphere of the riverside festival.\u201cPsst, Bjorn, look there.\u201d Peter whispered as he approached the podium and slipped into the seat next to Bjorn. Princess Louise gave him a stinging glare.Bjorn leisurely turned his gaze towards where his friend notioned with a not so subtle finger. Down at the bottom right of the stand he saw the woman that was his straight flush. Erna Hardy.Bjorn brushed away Peters silly behaviour and dipped his eyes. His long eyelashes vailed his eyes and Bjorn let a smile softly curl his lips.\u201cHuh, I see she is here.\u201d Bjorn said softly.When Erna turned her head to look around, Peter shrunk away a little and giggled. Bjorn really thought the man was going to hide in away in the flap of his coat. The movement alerted Erna and her eyes met Bjorn\u2019s. They exchanged polite nods and a half hearted smile.He could not help but notice how pale Erna looked. He had thought the news of her ill health had been excuses, but seeing her now, he might well believe the stories. She was still beautiful though. After that, Erna didn\u2019t know where to look and turned back to the face the front. She was a distance away, but Bjorn could still see she had blushed.\u201cOh boy, if I only Miss Hardy would accept my companionship, I think I would die.\u201d Peter said, staring at Erna\u2019s back. \u201cBecause my father will kill me.\u201d Peter practically laughed at his own punchline, but at the same time, it was no joke.Peter\u2019s father, Earl Bergen sat not too far away, laughing heartily. He was a good looking man and was a fairly famous pugilist in his youth. He proved he could still throw a punch when he caught his eldest son with a maid. Earl Bergen beat sense in the boy and called it repentence.The announcement for the start of the match sent the crowd into a cheer. Bjorn took off his gloves and leaned on the back of the chair in front of him. He was not watching the match, his attention was on Erna and as the noise of the crowd died down, she looked over her shoulder. Their eyes met and Bjorn\u2019s whole world became just her. She looked surprised he was looking at her, but to him, the whole world melted away and only she was left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone expected it, but the cheers were fervent none the less. Flowers thrown by the spectators laced the water of the river and gathered up along the banks on both sides.The Crown Prince, exhausted as he was, still took the time to greet the civilians that came out to see him. The girls sat in the very front row of the VIP stand, nigh on screamed and swooned when the Prince looked in their direction, though he was waving to his brother, mother and father.Erna did not allow herself to get swept up in the mindless display of testosterone fuelled sexual frustration. She watched from a distance and was amused by the behaviour of the young ladies.She had watched the race with intrigue too. She kind of half expected the boats to be something similar to what the country boys rowed in the village pond, but they were not and the atmosphere was greater by far, with so many people adding their voices to the cheers and shouts.Without meaning to, when Erna went to move off across the lawn, to avoid the more intimate social gatherings, she mingled with the crowd heading up to the award ceremony.As she puts up with the ceremony, she cant help but avert her gaze when the Crown Prince and the rest of his team lift the trophy. The outfits they wort were so form fitting that Erna could see every line of muscle and bodily curve. It seemed quite excessive.As she looked away, she notices Prince Bjorn standing there, before her. Erna was startled and unconsciously stepped back. Bjorn raised an eyebrow and laughed and his face glowed while exposed fully to the sun. At the moment, Erna felt like she could understand the duplicity of the maids, who cut out his picture in the newspaper, while cursing the Poisonous Mushroom Prince.\u201cErna? Erna,\u201d the voice of Viscountess Hardy interrupted the impromptu meeting with Bjorn. \u201cLook at you, when are you going to present yourself as a proper lady?\u201dAlthough Erna felt the malice in the words, the Viscountess wore a soft smile as she spoke. From the outside, you would have thought the two were sharing a little friendly banter and fun.Erna really struggled with grasping the manners of the people of city society and how they spoke to one another, saying one thing but meaning something else, she thought she could handle it for a little longer, until she was done with the place and could go home. Then she could forget all about the peoples glares and malicious meanings hidden behind polite platitudes.Adjusting the grip of her parasol, Erna fell in step behind the rest of the Hardy family. The sound of their diligent footsteps rang out from the sun baked stone path.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Coloured lanterns along the river bank were lit once the sun started to set. Those of the far side lit up the commoners summer celebration. The melodies of a small, three man orchestra could be heard from the far side of the river, overlaid with laughter and the buzz of conversation.The gardens of the palace was where the nobility and the upper caste had their party. They boasted a full orchestral set playing soft, ambient notes and even the buzz of conversation sounded more dignified, with lordly men guffawing into their fists and ladies tittering behind fans.Gladys put down the glass of champagne she had not taken a sip of. She was filled with old memories of growing up in these gardens and the palace she had spent her honeymoon in. She wished she could turn back time, to relive her childhood and encapsulate more pleasant times. That\u2019s when she sees Bjorn and her eyes turn red as she sees him with his friends.They were telling jokes amongst themselves and laughing. Their attention seemed overly focused on the Hardy family. Not the Hardy family, but the young Hardy girl. She was as the rumours suggested, a beautiful woman.Jealousy twinged at Gladys\u2019 heart as she noticed that Bjorn was also paying particular attention to the young woman. Her heart ached and she knew there was nothing she could do about it.She had never been in love with the old Crown Prince. Even when they were married, she knew their marriage was one of politics and the union between Lechen and Lars.There had never been any love between them from the onset, but Gladys was still so proud that she was going to get to marry Prince Bjorn. He was the most handsome and the most noblest man she had ever met and growing up surrounded by love, being in a relationship with none was strange.Being around Bjorn made Gladys feel insignificant. He was a man that never dropped his smile and was always of an amiable demeanour. He never once showed passion or genuine love and after they were married, Gladys realised why. The Crown Prince didn\u2019t careless who the Crown Princess was.He would have displayed the same kindness, with the same unfaltering smile, no matter what woman stood before him, declaring to be his wife. It was unbearable and even though Gladys was the most envied young woman in the country, she felt insignificant.Bjorn resembled the sun, a brilliant midsummer sun that blocks out all other light, including Gladys, who became lost in Bjorn\u2019s radiance.Gladys watched Erna as she managed to peel away from Count Lehman and catch her breath under a brightly lit tree. Coloured lanterns hung from the branches and bathed the young girl in a myriad of colours. Does that poor girl know what she\u2019s getting herself involved in? A smile appeared on Erna\u2019s lips and she seemed more docile and younger, if that was possible.\u201cGladys.\u201d Louise\u2019s voice crept into Gladys\u2019 consciousness.Gladys shook her head and looked about the table. The eyes of the noble ladies she shared a table with were considering her, when a moment ago they were busy chatting amongst themselves, barely giving Gladys a second glance. She felt her cheeks flush and she looked at the compassionate eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t pay any attention to that woman. She has no shame, even after all the scandal she has caused.\u201d Louise said.Louise noticed where Gladys was looking and tried to lift her spirits. Erna was looking around like an excited child, her innocent face was a stark contrast to Gladys\u2019 pensive look.\u201cIts fine, Louise, I\u2019m just going to go say say.\u201d Gladys stood and Louise\u2019s eyes went wide in surprise.\u201cNone sense, you cant speak to that woman.\u201d Louise said.\u201cIts fine, its what\u2019s expected. We cant just ignore the young Miss Hardy.\u201d Gladys said.Louise made to grab at Gladys\u2019 hands but Gladys shook it off. She approached the curious young lady and with the other young noble women not knowing what to do, follow after the princess.Erna did not notice the Princess and her entourage approach and was busy looking about the party and taking in all the sights. Gladys stopped in front of Erna, who finally looked around and saw the Princess. Their eyes met under the colourful tree.\u201cGood evening Miss Hardy, its a pleasure to finally meet you.\u201d Gladys said, braking the silence.Erna was frozen to the spot when she noticed the actual Princess was talking to her of all people. \u00a0 It was because of the Prince, Erna realised that the moment she saw the Princess before her. The Princess, who was once married to the Prince must be well aware of the scandal involving the pair.\u201cMiss Hardy?\u201d Gladys said when Erna didn\u2019t reply.Erna came to her senses and hurriedly stands to offer the Princess a polite curtsey and stumbles over any number of polite greetings. Erna was breathless a the idea of how far and fast rumour was going to spread. She wanted to pass the time as fast as possible and get out of this spiders web.Just like her time with the Queen, Erna found herself being led through a polite conversation as if two very best friends were idly chatting in a tea room.\u201cI hear you don\u2019t have anyone to keep company with. It must be very lonely for you Miss Hardy.\u201d Gladys said.She gave side glances to Bjorn as she spoke words laced with false sincerity to the ostracised country girl. He did not seem to be paying them any attention what so ever, being more concerned with what ever spectacle Leonard was getting involved in.Her brief conversation with Erna led Gladys to believe there was no merit to the rumours and with that revelation, she suddenly felt genuine sympathy for the young girl. She was also filled with guilt at the thought that Bjorn had used the girl to get at her.\u201cDo you like theatre, Miss Hardy?\u201d\u201cA play?\u201d Erna asked in surprise.\u201cYes,\u201d Gladys smiled as if considering a playful puppy. \u201cIn ten days there is a charity show, to raise money for the orphanage. I think it would be nice if you were to attend.\u201dIt was cruel to add any edge to her offer and besides, it wasn\u2019t the girls fault that Bjorn could be such a monster. She wasted to at least attempt to befriend the country girl and provide her with salvation in their friendship. Of course, Louise and the others would not understand.\u201cI\u2026ahem\u2026that is\u2026\u201d Erna stumbled over her words, looking for the right way to deny the Princess. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Princess.\u201dIn contrast to her hesitant words, Erna\u2019s voice is calm and clear. Gladys\u2019 eyes burned at the unexpected refusal. It was the first time she had lost her composure since the start of the conversation.\u201cI am really grateful for the invitation, but I don\u2019t think I will be able to attend the play. I\u2019m very sorry Princess.\u201d Erna finally found the words.Holding her hands in her lap, Erna gave a polite bow. When she came back up she pursed her lips as if she had more to say, but never let the words pass.There was silence enough that they could all hear the onlookers whispering amongst themselves. The daughter of the Hardy family just insulted the Princess. The rumour spread so fast and Gladys was surprised to see that Bjorn was amongst them.Gladys looked at Bjorn desperately trying not to shake in anger. Peter leaned in and whispered something in Bjorn\u2019s ear and Bjorn looked directly at Gladys with a cocked eyebrow. He started to chuckle, she couldn\u2019t believe it but he was laughing.What did that mean?Even in the face of disgrace, Gladys did her best to keep back the tears, clinging on to dignity like it was the only thing left to her. Bjorn approached the two women and the spectators looked on expectantly at the old couple.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their murmuring mixed with the sound of the bubbling fountain.Erna didn\u2019t not notice the buzz of activity beyond the approaching Prince. None of the criticism reached her ears as embarrassment separated her from the world around her. She had no idea what she could have done wrong. Was it etiquette of these socialites not to refuse invitations in public?Erna was unsure, but in all her training and reading, she had never come across anything that suggested that. She knew it was rude to falsely accept an invitation, knowing she would not be in town for the show.Was it her tone, or maybe even her attitude?Erna couldn\u2019t tell Gladys the real reason she could not attend, so she thought it probably was. She still couldn\u2019t tell the Princess that she was going to be running away in a week.Feeling helpless, Erna opened her mouth to apologise once more, but a deep shadow fell on the pair before Erna could speak.Erna looked up in surprise and let out a little involuntary noise. Prince Bjorn stood over her. He smiled down at her and she reflexively stepped away from him, but Bjorn was a little quicker and grabbed Erna\u2019s arm.\u201cAre you done with Miss Hardy?\u201d Bjorn asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Gladys stammered. Her eyes were puffy and red, but lacked tears at that moment.\u201cDon\u2019t cry Princess.\u201dBjorn looked like he did that day when he told Gladys he would be divorcing her. Gladys choked and felt like a little girl on the verge of tears, but unlike that day, she remained strong under the scrutiny of the other party goers.\u201cI will be taking Miss Hardy with me.\u201d Bjorn said.Satisfied that Gladys was not going to argue back and just stand there, desperate to keep her shame minimal, Bjorn moved away. Erna fought the Prince\u2019s firm grip all the while, but lacked the strength to break free.\u201cLets go.\u201d Bjorn said sternly. Erna looked back at him with defiance all over her face. Bjorn bowed his head and whispered in Erna\u2019s ear. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be stubborn, Miss Hardy, everyone is watching.\u201d\u201cI am having a conversation with Princess Gladys.\u201d Erna snapped like a petulant child.\u201cLooks to me like the Princess is done talking to you.\u201d Bjorn said.Erna looked at Gladys, she was struggling to hold back tears, her face had gone puffy and red, she was in no position to hold any conversation.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Erna tried to argue.\u201cThe best thing for you to do, right now, is come with me.\u201dNow realising the position she was in, after noticing the sharp daggers the other ladies were throwing at Erna with their eyes, there was nothing else she could do. Erna was still agitated in being carted away like this, but what else could she do? Gladys just stared at the pair walking away, speechless.Bjorn escorted Erna through the throng of people, who tried to act like they hadn\u2019t hung on every word and action that had just occurred under the colourful tree, by standing aside and hastily continuing stale conversations.In Gladys\u2019 eyes, as she watched the pair swan off like lovers, Erna had clearly won.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna was still dazed when their walk led them to the end of the road, which stopped at the riverside. An aqueduct ran from the canal to the great fountain, its arches decorated with flowers and more coloured lanterns, made the whole scene look like a dream.\u201cMiss Hardy.\u201d Bjorn said softly.\u201cDid I do something wrong, to the Princess?\u201d Erna asked immediately, before Bjorn could take the conversation over. She looked up at him with pensive eyes.\u201cDid you fight with the Princess?\u201d Bjorn asked. He wore such an absurd smile.\u201cNo, never.\u201d Erna said hurriedly.\u201cWell, I heard you declined her invitation.\u201d\u201cYes, did I do something wrong? It was for a charity play, but I\u2026\u201d Erna stopped herself before she gave the plan away.\u201cNothing concrete that I\u2019ve ever seen, but given Gladys\u2019 high statues, its probably an unwritten rule, especially to decline to her face, in front of her peers.\u201d Bjorn said through a sly smile.\u201cReally, that is bad.\u201d Erna said, the blue of her eyes deepened to a sadness, filled with regret.\u201cMaybe.\u201d Was all Bjorn said.Erna let out a desperate sigh and lowered her head.\u201cI cant attend the performance, what else could I do?\u201d Erna sounded desperate, like someone trying to prove their innocence without evidence.\u201cWhy?\u201d Bjorn said. He looked down and considered Erna\u2019s pale face, which seemed ever more pale in the coloured light of the lanterns.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Erna became lost for words.She avoided the Prince\u2019s gaze, for fear that he would see into her eyes and know the truth. He would realise she planned on running away and would probably tell her father. She had to keep her plan a secret. So how was she going to prove her innocence?There was an unpleasant moment, an awkward silence, between the two as Erna warred within herself. He is the Prince and he had good memories of Erna, she did not want to leave him with this one bad memory of her, as an inelegant and rude woman. There was still debts to settle between the two of them and Erna desperately wanted to talk to someone about running away.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Erna finally broke the silence with a soft squeak of a word. \u201cI am leaving Schuber, in a week.\u201d Erna confessed. \u201cI am returning to Buford, to be with my family.\u201dErna held her breath and Bjorn looked at her with a flt expression. He showed no sign or reaction to what she had just told him, so she continued.\u201cIf I had told the Princess that I would attend, knowing that I would not be going, it would have been a lie, I didn\u2019t want to lie to the Princess.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell her?\u201d\u201cI cant do that.\u201d Erna lowered her head and her voice to a whisper.People started walking down the road that led to the canal, where Erna and Bjorn were stood. That could only mean one thing, the fireworks were going to start soon. They were the highlight of the summer festival.\u201cIts\u2026a secret.\u201d Erna said softly, so no one could over hear.\u201cA secret?\u201d Bjorn whispered back.\u201cYes. I want to leave as quietly as possible.\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you planning on eloping or something?\u201d There was jest in Bjorn\u2019s voice.Erna\u2019s eyes could not hide the nervousness she felt and she swallowed dryly. She clearly did not share the same humour as Bjorn.Bjorn stared blankly at Erna for a long moment, then burst out laughing. He realised she really planned on running away and over everything else, Bjorn realised something, Erna was a simple, naive country girl who really didn\u2019t understand how the world worked.Bjorn\u2019s laughter attracted the attention of couples and groups that had gathered near by to watch the fireworks. The world suddenly seemed more beautiful, if only in its cruel twists of fate. Bjorn laughed at the idea of Viscount Hardy dreaming of selling his daughter to revive his fortune and status. He laughed at all the old men rubbing their hands at the thought of getting their twisted fingers on Erna\u2019s delicate flesh.Bjorn laughed for a long time, he could feel the surprised onlookers staring at him in bewilderment. He didn\u2019t care about them and when his laughter subsided, he looked at Erna like she was the only person in the world. She seemed embarrassed by his sudden mirth.\u201cWhy would you tell me this, of all people?\u201d Bjorn said.He still had a small smile as he looked down at Erna. At first glance, she seemed timid and shy, but deep down, she was strong and firm. Her pale face, blended with the colours of the lanterns, was cute and underlined with pouty red lips.\u201cWhat if I accidentally mess up your plans?\u201d\u201cI know the Prince is not like that.\u201d\u201cYou know? Miss hardy, you know me?\u201dEven though Bjorn\u2019s tone seemed to be spiteful, Erna could see there was still a soft smile in the corner of his lips and on his eyes. Erna nodded without hesitation. Blind faith seemed to be a tradition of her families.\u201cEven when I leave Schuber, I will not forget my debt to you, I will pay you back, my Prince.\u201d Erna said.\u201cDebt?\u201d Bjorn feigned trying to recall. \u201cOh, that.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry, I will pay back every penny. I promise, on the honour of the Baden family.\u201dThat name again, the woman was acting like it was her name. It was unfamiliar, but it least it was a name that higher prestige than Hardy. Bjorn readily agreed. The woman\u2019s wild plan to sell artificial flowers to pay for the debt had been working so far, would it still if she decided to run?A soft breeze blew off the canal and wrapped around the pair as they stood in silence, looking at each other. Bjorn looked out over the water, following the sound of people laughing on the boats that had just set sail. It was time to close the bet and collect his winnings.\u201cWould you like me to scrub your debt?\u201d Bjorn looked back at Erna. \u201cIts difficult to run away when you still have debt anchoring you to this place. Come to think of it, that night only happened because of my rudeness. Its not very gentlemanly to shift the blame to an innocent lady, such as yourself.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Erna was shocked, this was not what she was expecting.\u201cLet\u2019s make a deal,\u201d Bjorn said with a benevolent smile. \u201cAfford me the honour of enjoying your company on the Abit River, tonight, and if you do, I will wipe the debt.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTo be indebted to someone puts you in a very compromising position.Erna realised this as she lowered herself into the boat and prepared to enjoy an evening with a man she was not involved with. She couldn\u2019t help but think of the rumours that are going to rise from this. She was thankful that her Grandmother wasn\u2019t here to witness this. She always said that a man and a woman should be careful not to share careless glances.It was ridiculous.To conduct herself in such a foolish act, even if he was the Prince, was like pouring fuel on a fire that was already raging. Even she could sense that, It would have been better if she had politely refused and went about her evening.Being the youngest lady of the Baden family, Erna should have been a quiet lady in the corner, protected her family honour and not drawn attention to herself. She failed to even do that and now, she sullied the name of Baden, which she was more concerned about than the Hardy reputation that was already sullied.It was an opportunity to write off the debt, a debt that she was struggling to pay back. Even if she made flowers for the rest of her life, she would not have finished paying it off.The Prince looked so relax when he asked Erna out onto the water, like he knew what she was going to say before she said it. Erna had warred with herself over clearing the debt, or maintaining her families honour.Clearing the debt inevitably won and the Prince reached out his hand to help her onto the boat. Erna hated him for what he was putting her through and the clueless manner in which he conducted himself.Erna sat at the prow and looked down at the hand that was still holding hers. It felt like a dream, a distant thing happening to someone else. The gentle lapping of the current against the boat seemed to dictate the thudding of her heart and harmonised with her breathing.Bjorn skilfully rowed the boat out onto the water. Erna watched him with wide eyes. She was so close to him. When Bjorn noticed she was watching him, the corner of his mouth twitched upward.\u201cYou\u2019re not scared, are you?\u201d\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Erna said, a little too firmly. Even she was not convinced by her answer.Bjorn laughed as he pointed the boat in the direction of the coloured lanterns. They were of so many different shapes, some of paper and some of glass. They were all the colours of the rainbow, which blended to form new colours not of the rainbow.Erna watched the lights and colour spread around her in amazement. She had never seen such a splendid sight in all her life. Her Grandmother was right, the city really does lift your spirits. She had not realised before, concentrating so much on what made the city a poor place to live.The overwhelming beauty of the lights, reflected in dazzling shimmers on the water erased all thoughts.All the whispering onlookers, the gossipers and rumour mongers seemed so very distant now. She didn\u2019t even care how angry her father was going to be when he heard about this.It all felt so very distant.Erna cast her gaze about the river, trying to take in every mote of detail, committing every part of it to memory. When she realised she was staring directly at the Prince, and he looked right back at her, she reflexively touched the side of her face and knew it was careless.She needed to say something, to break the awkward silence they shared, but she couldn\u2019t think of anything. She became very aware of the itch in her fingers, all the work made them ache and no amount of massaging made them better. Erna hid her hands under the parasol so that Bjorn would not notice her fidgeting with them.It would be nice if he would say something, rather than just look at her with that soft little smile of his. He didn\u2019t say anything and just let out a laugh. It was a cool, soft laugh that quickly got taken away by the midsummer breeze.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cIt was a face after all.\u201d Peter declared.He watched Bjorn\u2019s boat drift out onto the river and saw that he was not alone. He was with Erna. He had sent flowers, passionate letters and made eye contact from time to time. He had put so much work in wooing Erna and Bjorn, the man who spent his entire time on the sideline watching, was going to be the one to lift the trophy.It was his face, it had to be, it was the only conclusion Peter could come up with. He had not written a single letter, he had not sent a single sincere flower and yet, Bjorn Dniester was the one who was going to claim victory.\u201cWhat fool put him up in the first place.\u201d Peter said.\u201cIf I remember correctly, it was you.\u201d Leonard said through laughter.\u201cMe? No way.\u201dThen Peter remembered. Sat at the gaming table, well on his way to drunken unconsciousness, a huge pile of chips in front of Bjorn and the feeling of desperately trying to grasp a win.\u201cUnbelievable, I should have known, he always sweeps up the stake.\u201d Peter said dejectedly.Bjorn had always shown sincerity when it came to money and he was a well known flirt with flamboyant women and when he tossed in his chip out of frustration, Peter felt sure he would not put the effort into courting someone as meek as Erna Hardy. He felt sure she would be too much work for him.Bjorn never went after women, he always let them come to him and they always seemed like they would have hung themselves for the Prince. Peter had watched him for decades and felt so sure of himself\u201cCould he be serious about Erna?\u201d Peter muttered to himself.\u201cWhat\u2019s that, you crazy bastard?\u201d Leonard laughed at him.\u201cYeah, as crazy as he is.\u201d Peter said and laughed back.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cYou row very well.\u201d Erna said.They had been sitting in a deafening silence for so long and Erna was losing her mind. She handed over the words carefully, as if breaking the silence was a sin. It felt right to start with praise, one of the most basic polite conversational skills.\u201cYou should row in next year\u2019s competition.\u201dRowing on the river and rowing in a race were two completely incomparable events and Erna felt a little silly for suggesting it, but she needed to say something, it was hard to bear this suffocating silence. Bjorn seldom seemed willing to talk, so she tried it out herself.\u201cYes?\u201d Bjorn said.It was a lame attempt, limping out of his mouth with the minimalistic effort only a man not interested in conversation would use. He still replied to her and Erna felt a little relieved, this was well on its way to becoming a successful conversation.\u201cDo you like rowing?\u201dThe next step in polite conversation is figuring out each other\u2019s likes and dislikes, finding common ground and building towards it. She remembered that young men like talking about sports, she didn\u2019t but the teachings of the speech book she read back in Buford also said that young men like to talk about themselves, a lot.\u201cNo, not really.\u201d Bjorn answered without much thought.Erna had been proud of her ability to follow the step by step guide. The teachings of the book she read were not much good in a place like Buford, but this had thrown her off. She fidgeted with the hem of her skirt.\u201cAh, why is that?\u201d She put the words together like a child figuring out a puzzle.\u201cI don\u2019t like the sweat and stink of other men so close to me.\u201d Bjorn said.From his tone, it was clear that he was not joking. This whole ordeal was throwing Erna through a loop, did the Prince not learn social norms when it came to conversation?\u201cBut you do like beasts?\u201d Erna was proud of herself for finding something to latch onto. \u201cI read that you are a top equestrian and won several competitions.\u201d\u201cYes, because horses are beautiful. Compared to sweaty, stinking, beastly men, horses are dignified.\u201dBjorn had stopped rowing, letting the oars sit lazily in the water, he watched Erna with a hand sagged over the end of the oar. She muttered to herself and nodded her head. It must have been a curious sight for him.\u201cBut why do you hate horse racing? I hear you own the fastest horse in Lechen, but rarely go to watch.\u201d Erna looked at Bjorn, her eyes sparkled with the multitude of coloured lights.\u201cOh, no, I\u2019m not interested in watching other people ride horses.\u201d\u201cNo? Are you the type of person who prefers to participate?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d There was a brief pause as Bjorn squinted at Erna. \u201cYou did a pretty diligent job investigating my background.\u201dEveryone knew Bjorn Dniester, it was hard not to hear about the Prince at even the most uncommon social event. If Erna had put her mind to it, she could probably find out all there is to know about the Prince in half a day.Erna shrunk away, feeling like she had over stepped herself, but the Prince only seemed to lean in closer to her. He moved into her sight line as she tried to look away and their eyes locked. Her cheeks flushed and she couldn\u2019t help but fidget with her fingers.She intended to enjoy this moment a little longer and was not going to let shyness get the better of her. What\u2019s the sin of enjoying a little gossip?\u201cSorry, Prince, please forgive my presumption.\u201d Erna said.She regained her composure under his scrutiny, but couldn\u2019t remove the tremble in her voice. If he continued to tease her like this, she was going to throw herself over board.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to apologise for, I don\u2019t think you were being rude.\u201d\u201cBut I offended\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk about you.\u201d Bjorn cut Erna off. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair if we only talk about me.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cDid you say you were from Buford? Are the festivals there like this one, too?\u201dThere was some sincerity in his voice, as if he genuinely wanted to know about Erna. He wanted to know about Buford, a place he didn\u2019t know existed until Erna Hardy suddenly appeared.\u201cAh, yes. Yes, but nowhere near as big and fancy as this I don\u2019t think, I\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d As if sensing his intentions, Erna answered with a relaxed smile.\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen it, why\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cMy Grandma and Grandpa didn\u2019t like crowded places and sometimes the festivals were held in places too far away. Instead, my family would have dinner under the Ash tree. We would make lots of wonderful things and delicious cakes. My Grandmother made a very special rose wine every year that she let me drink from when I was sixteen.\u201dErna remembered the disappointing taste of the wine she had been looking forward to drinking from such an early age. She loved the colour of it and its smell of summer flowers. It always reminded her of grass insects chattering and dandelions caught in the breeze.Erna spoke in a distant voice as she detailed the annual summer dinner party. It felt like she was back there now, with her Grandmother and Grandfather. The smell of rich cakes and juicy meats.Bjorn watched her with interest as she lost herself in the memory. He realised why Erna Hardy considered herself a Baden first, as she spoke so fondly of her Grandmother and father and her home.She looked happy. Bjorn had never seen her like this before and he found himself being drawn in by her smile.\u201cIt sounds beautiful.\u201d Bjorn said.It was nothing more than the appropriate response in praise of the woman\u2019s zeal, but Erna beamed at him for saying it. They looked at each other for a long while, right up until there was a sudden and resounding bang somewhere above them. Erna laughed her nervousness away as Bjorn turned his head up to watch the fireworks painting the night sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt first, Erna was scared of the sudden menacing sound, but quickly fell in love with the explosion of colours.A streak of bright light rose up from behind the palace and bloomed a vibrant red in the sky. The feast of colours was such a splendid display of beauty beyond comparison to anything Erna had seen before.\u201cWow.\u201d She said breathlessly.She innocently admired every streak of light, anticipating the explosion of colour that would follow. It left after images in her mind as she watched with wide eyes. Each flash of light brought new details to the landscape.\u201cIs this your first time?\u201d Bjorn asked.A shower of golden sparks rained down to the ground and wipe out the after image of dandelion seeds. It was only then she remembered the Prince was also in the boat.\u201cYes.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThis is my first time.\u201dShe smiled brighter than the lights in the sky and she felt the weight of the debt lift from her conscience and allow her to fully enjoy the moment.Bjorn watched Erna completely forget he was there. Gone was the demure she so carelessly wore like an old, but familiar, shawl. She was an excited child and Bjorn laughed a little despondently.Erna was younger than Louise, but in the city, she was still of an age to be married. Come to think of it, Gladys was about her age when he married her. That was four years ago, they had been out on the boat, just like this, the only difference being that Bjorn felt like he had to do it as a social display to the people of the happy newly-weds. Now, he wanted to be here, with Erna, for no other reason than to share her company.There were other differences, Gladys was less than enthusiastic about the boat race and when he took her out onto the water, her complexion went worryingly pale and she looked very out of place on the rocking boat.Gladys kept her composure till the end and reciprocated the love the people poured onto her as the Crown Princess. Bjorn recognised why she would make such a great fit as a future Queen, but he could not picture her as a wife. He accepted the marriage to her because it was what was expected.It wasn\u2019t until a week later he found out why Gladys had been so sickly that day. He was going to be a father.\u201cCongratulations, your highness, you will soon be a father.\u201d The doctor had said.The doctor was more thrilled about the pregnancy than Bjorn was. It had been a very hot and strange afternoon, he felt like a frog in a pan that was slowly heating up. He knew the child wasn\u2019t his.Bjorn looked at Erna, erasing the thoughts of Gladys and the tumultuous summer. She had a smile that made him feel like a flower blooming for her. The colours splashed on her face and caught as twinkles in her wide eyes.Would she really run away from her father?It didn\u2019t feel like she was making it up, being melodramatic to curry sympathy, but at the same time, she seemed too timid to do something so dramatic. His heart twists at the thought of her being an Autumn Bride, sold off by her father for profit.Bjorn was becoming tired of the falsities of society, the lies and rumours that spread from mouth to ear. There was rarely a shred of truth to the gossip. So where was the truth? At one time or another, he had desperately tried to cling to the truth, but it became like clutching a slimy Eel among the rapids. In the end, he just let go, let the current take him away, let all the dishonesty wash over him and away.A part of him still clung to those sentimental days, when things were easier and it was straight line from where he was to what he wanted. Now, he had to jump through hoops, do a little dance and exert more effort than what it was worth.Here, in the boat with him, was the most beautiful woman. They were enjoying a wonderful night together and although he found the fireworks boring, he had something else, someone else, to keep him entertained. Even if she was just being herself.He had won.It was a satisfying conclusion, he thought, the value of this woman\u2019s company far outweighed the lost trophy. Sure, in a few years Erna might become a nostalgic thought like Gladys, or simpler days, but for now he had a lot of fun with the pretty faced girl and her erratic behaviour.As the fireworks approached the end, they became ever more spectacular until the final climax saw an incredible display of light and sound.Erna had not realised her hat slipped from her head and dangled precariously close to the edge of the boat. She turned as Bjorn made a sudden move toward and , scared he was forcing himself on her, she fell back toward the prow, only to see her hand dive into the water, missing the hat.Embarrassed, Erna leaned out over the side and stretched for the hat. The boat leaned dangerously close to the water.\u201cHold still.\u201d Bjorn said.He grabbed her shoulder right as she felt herself about to pitch over into the colourful water. His movement was enough to send them the rest of the way and they splashed under the surface.\u201cOh my, look over.\u201d People shouted from the river bank.\u201cThere\u2019s been an accident.\u201d Other shouted.Right as the climax of the fireworks display let the sky into a false daylight. Showing drifting clouds of smoke and the heads of Bjorn and Erna bobbing in the river.Erna panicked as her world became drowned in darkness and muffled noise. She desperately heald her breath and thrashed about looking for the boat. She wanted to call out for help, but water rushed in and silenced her.\u201cIts okay. I\u2019ve got you.\u201dThe voice was urgent, but soothing. She felt strong arms take her round the waist and shoulders and lift her up out of the water. Nearly out of the water, she could feel it lapping at her waist and thighs and she was cradled. Her arms instinctively came up and around Bjorn\u2019s neck and she held him tightly.Even though the panic and fear was still there, she understood that she was alright, she was no longer in harms way. Bjorn stood and the water came up a little past her waist.\u201cMiss Hardy?\u201dHis voice came in clear amongst the buzz that filled her ears. She felt cold hard wood underneath as he laid her down on the jetty.\u201cAre you awake, Miss Hardy?\u201dEach time he called her name, the world came more into focus. The sky was dark now, no more blooms of colours, no more sounds bangs, pops and fizzes. Only the buzz.\u201cMiss Hardy.\u201dHer eyes fluttered open and she looked up into the eyes of a handsome young Prince. He smiled when she looked at him and her heart fluttered. She answered with a difficult nod and the buzz around her grew. She realised that a crowd had gathered around her.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Miss Hardy.\u201d Bjorn said.Erna felt like she was going to throw up and she coughed, which burned her lungs. She felt like they were on fire and as the coughing fit continued, she vomited up river water. Her shame was complete and she blushed in embarrassment.\u201cEverything is okay now.\u201d Bjorn soothed and rubbed her back.He let out a long sigh of relief. The water from their two wet bodies soaked the decking of the jetty and continued to pool out to the feet of the crowd around them.It was an absurd accident, but she was lucky. Bjorn sat down beside Erna and brushed his wet hair out of his face. The other hand was still around Erna\u2019s shoulders, holding her close. She leaned into him.Erna laughed. The more she thought about it, the funnier it got. It was the first accident at the festival in quite some time, not since a drunk couple stumbled into the river and turned the whole festival on its head. All for just a simple little hat.If she had just stayed calm when Bjorn tried to help, the boat wouldn\u2019t have capsized. He let out a sigh and joined in the laughter.Bjorn couldn\u2019t tell if this was typical country girl mischief, or she really was as naive as she showed, either way she was a troublesome woman. Its a good thing now that everything is over.Bjorn finally let Erna go and she pulled away as he stood up. Those who had been watching them, seeing that they were okay, rushed in and started to make a fuss. Bjorn simply removed his wet coat.\u201cIts okay, no need to worry, we\u2019re fine.\u201d Bjorn said, stopping the eager attendants.That wasn\u2019t the end of it. He saw a boat moving close to the dock, packed with onlookers muttering to each other. The group included Viscount Hardy and Princess Gladys and his parents.Bjorn looked over at Erna who was heading away, she had given him a strong beginning and a great end. She really was a lady of unconventional social disturbances. Turning up, causing a scene and then flitting off back to where ever. It was just a shame she was so embroiled in affairs and scandals.Erna turned and saw Bjorn. He tilted his head toward her and she gave a slight curtsey. He wished she didn\u2019t have to leave and hoped that she would lose the courage to run away. Settle down in the city so he could explore her friendship more. Either way, they had been here together and it was a good relationship.Bjorn strode down to the now anchored boat. All through his reminiscence of the evening, he did not look back once.\u201cIs everything okay? What of Miss Hardy?\u201d Peter blurted.He and Leonard had heard the commotion. They ran for Bjorn\u2019s carriage and caught him just in time. They had been drinking heavily and stank of alcohol.\u201cBring my money.\u201d Bjorn said to Leonard.Peter and Leonard stared at each other blankly as Bjorn pulled himself up into the carriage. They almost simultaneously clucked their tongues and shook their heads.Drenched as she was, Bjorn sat down and closed his eyes. The evening had been quite eventful and he was thankful it was over. It was time to put everything back into place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cYou shallow, selfish, foolish thing.\u201d Walter Hardy was full of anger and rage toward his daughter.He threw a paper onto the table, with the utmost face being a comparison article between Princess Gladys and Erna Hardy. It was one of a multitude of papers that ran a similar article, but Walter chose this one because of its more refinement. As if reading any of the other papers would drag his name through the gutter.\u201cI warned you, but you just don\u2019t seem to understand.\u201d The man raged on and grabbed a bottle, but as he went to drink, Brenda clutched at his arm.\u201cCalm down, dear.\u201d Brenda Hardy said. \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet, there is still Count Lehman.\u201dLehman. The name broke through the haze of anger like a ray of sunshine. Calming just a little, Walter put the bottle down.After the fiasco of the festival, it was expected that the scandal between Prince Bjorn and Erna would resurface, but what was underestimated was the depths the people of Lechen would go. The spread in the paper that stirred up public sentiment. The variable being Princess Gladys.The criticism against the Prince, for playing with another woman in front of Gladys, intensified. Even as she had forgiven him, it said in the paper and they had decided to reunite. The mention of a dead child was a fatal blow.The Princess countered the rumour that the Prince was a cold hearted father figure, who ignored his child. Mentioning that he had warmed up to the child, even after they had divorced. He showed nothing but respect at the funeral.Gladys urged a stop to the unjust accusations. After all, he too was a parent, a father who had suffered the loss of a beloved child. Their reunion was also not a very compelling issue. If he chooses to involve himself with the Hardy family, the Princess would respect that.The paper carrying Gladys\u2019 interview spread all over Lechen. It didn\u2019t help that it wasn\u2019t one of the gossip rags, but a well respected paper that everyone took as gospel.Walter rang the little hand bell frivolously, though his initial instinct was to reach for the bottle again. Even if he drank the water the maid would bring, the thirst would not go away.His daughter had been set up to look like a wicked witch trying to snatch the Prince away from the innocent Princess. The Lechinians were angered and were practically a baying mob that wanted to burn Erna at the steak.Because of this, the line of nobles courting Erna dwindled away one by one. There were no more letters of proposition, no more flowers and gentleman callers. All that was left was Count Lehman. The old man was still integral to public opinion.Count Lehman was only interested in an heir, no matter who it came from. That was all the old man wanted from Erna, anything he just didn\u2019t care about.\u201cMy lord, A letter from Count Lehman.\u201d A maid came in, brandishing the small envelope.For a moment, Walter was delighted at the news and at hearing the Counts name, but a worried look from Brenda made him change his thoughts.Count Lehman was due to share dinner with Erna later on that day. To receive a letter mere hours before the appointed time was a premonition for bad news.\u201cHurry, hurry, open it, what does it say?\u201d Brenda said.Walter stared at the letter in his hands and tried to swallow, but all moisture had left his mouth. He had asked the maid to bring him water, not a letter. Walter unceremoniously ripped the envelope open and read the letter.\u201cWell, what does it say? It\u2019s nothing, right, right?\u201d Brenda went on.Walter said nothing and simply heald the letter out to Brenda as a reply. Brenda took the letter and scanned over it as in such haste, it was a wonder she could have picked out any of the words.The letter was short, simply and lacked any formality. It simply stated that Count Lehman would not be attending dinner. Brenda read it again and again, but the words never changed and the lack of politeness could only mean one thing.Now, at the last, their only hope was gone. Count Lehman finally came to his senses and stepped away from wanting to marry Erna Hardy.Walter stared off into the middle distance as one thing circled his mind over and over. Bankruptcy.The day was probably not that far off now. He had to borrow money time and time again. He was reaching the end of the line, there was no one else willing to lend him money and he had no way of making it.Walter snatched up the bottle, Brenda didn\u2019t stop him this time and he took a long draft of the strong drink.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Overcome with shock, Baroness Baden slipped out of bed and grabbed her glasses that were sitting on the bedside table. Despite her exhausted appearance, she escaped the bedroom.\u201cErna, my baby,\u201d she said.When she remembered the name, the tears that had only just stopped after so long, flowed again in slow drips down her wrinkled cheeks.The old woman shuffled over to the rocking chair that sat beside a large window overlooking the back garden. She pulled out a heavily starched handkerchief and dabbed at her wet cheeks. The handkerchief was soaked pretty quickly.\u201cMadam\u2026\u201d Mrs Greve said.Mrs Greve came into the bedroom when she heard the Baroness shuffling about. She could not find the words to say, to comfort the Baroness, so she watched and stood close by. Her own eyes were red and puffy.Ralph Royce had brought them the newspaper. He had gone out to get some groceries and came back with this. When he first gave Mrs Greve the news, she thought the man was being senile, but then read the article.Mrs Greve rushed into the house and brought the paper to Baroness Baden and together they read the article, which had a large picture of Princess Gladys on it. The grief of it hi the Baroness like an iron hammer and she forgot her arthritis for a moment, as she scrambled out of bed and over to the chair.Mrs Greve quietly crossed the room and stood next to the Baroness. The newspaper told a story of Erna Hardy and Princess Gladys, making Erna look like a villain.\u201cErna wouldn\u2019t do that. This is wrong, it\u2019s all wrong.\u201d the Baroness said.\u201cOf course, absolutely.\u201d Mrs Greve reassured her.\u201cShe sent me a letter not too long ago, she said she was doing fine, adapting well to the city and seeing many rare and good things, and\u2026\u201d The Baroness cut off as the sobs became too much.\u201cIt\u2019s Walter Hardy, this is all his handy work, it must be.\u201d The Baroness continued when she was able to catch a break between sobs.The whole reason Erna left with her father was because of something Baron Baden had said. \u201cWe can\u2019t help her here, in this remote village, she needs to be out in the world, in the city, it will do her some good.\u201d The Baroness couldn\u2019t imagine being without the young girl and tried to delay it as much as she could.Before she knew it, Erna was a full grown woman, so she decided that she had to let her go. It was like her heart was being removed. She knew Walter Hardy was a heartless Viscount, but he is Erna\u2019s father.\u201cWe need to save Erna.\u201d The Baroness said, pushing her glasses back up her nose. \u201cI will not let her follow in Annette\u2019s footsteps. Never.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The reason Princess Gladys is as powerful as she seems is because she has no remorse.Bjorn observed the recent commotion stirred up by the tabloids and came to that conclusion. He knew it already, he had always known it, but this time Gladys seems to have taken it even further than ever before. It seemed like his ex-wife was out for blood and it was almost awe-inspiring.Bjorn tossed the paper away and it landed at the foot of the bed. He leaned back against the cushioned headboard and sighed. Leaning over, he took up the late morning tea from the night stand.Maybe Gladys is serious this time.The princess must have really tried to protect her ex-husband, who had been criticised for getting involved with Erna Hardy. He wanted to protect the Hardy girl as best he could, while she was being laid out on the chopping block.Bjorn let out a sigh as he set the teacup back on the night stand and ran a hand through his messy hair. He looked out of the window and saw the weather was a dark reflection of the mood he felt over the city. Dark and gloomy and threatened to storm at any moment.A father bearing the scars of a lost child.Bjorn burst into laughter when recalled Gladys\u2019 skilful lie. Gladys was so used to strangling people with the truth had finally learned to lie to achieve the same effect. To weave a lie around a truth so expertly deserved praise.Bjorn had to applaud the King and his attempts to get Princess Gladys and Prince Bjorn back together again, using the opinions of the people to sway events to his favour. It was a great strategy, if not a tearful idiom.The tea having washed away the sleepiness from his mind, Bjorn got up and put on a gown. He then headed over to the window and drew back the curtains. The wind blew in a rather strong smell of fish.Bjorn looked at the cloudy sky and put an unlit cigar into his mouth. Erna knew he was not trying to kindle any sort of flame between them and that was the moment a name suddenly came to Bjorn. He tossed the unlit cigar back into the ashtray and went to shower up.The sound of pouring water from the shower went on a little longer than usual.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 34": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAre you not making any flowers today?\u201d Lisa asked as she brushed Erna\u2019s hair.Erna had been making flowers constantly, shutting out everything else in the world and only stopping to sleep. That was until she took yesterdays delivery to the department store. Lisa had grown worried about the sudden change in Erna and she could see that Erna was a little paler than usual.\u201cAre you feeling unwell?\u201d Lisa asked.\u201cNo, not at all, I just want to rest a little.\u201d Erna replied.Lisa hoped it was the case, but she didn\u2019t feel any confidence in Erna\u2019s words. She worried that all the bitter talk in the city was not affecting Erna negatively.\u201cMy lady, no matter what anyone says, I will always like you,\u201d Lisa said, putting down the comb. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to those people out there, they don\u2019t know the first thing about you and when they realise, it will all quiet down again. It always does.\u201d\u201cYes, I know,\u201d Erna said with a smile and a nod. \u201cThank you Lisa.\u201d\u201cWhy do you act like we are never going to see each other again? Even if you get married, I\u2019m coming with you, Miss, you can\u2019t get rid of me that easily.\u201d Lisa let out a soft laugh.Erna answered with a simple smile. If only she knew. The appointed day with Pavel drawn close and this was going to be the last time Erna was going to end the day talking with Lisa. Tomorrow she will be on the train to Buford.After Lisa finished, she gave Erna a warm embrace and left the room. Erna sat, staring at the door until she could no longer hear Lisa\u2019s footsteps.She could only ever seem to recall memories of being deceived, hated and used in while in this city. Lisa was the only source of goodness in her life. That and maybe the Prince. Despite his reputation, Erna had found the Prince to be quite charming and a good person.Everything was quiet.Erna stood as if cutting off a distasteful discussion and went over to pull out the suitcase from under the bed. She opened it and began checking through the things she had packed. Like the day she arrived, she would be leaving light.Satisfied, Erna closed up the suitcase and stuffed it back under the bed, just in time to hear footsteps and the distinct shriek of Lisa just beyond the door.Giddy with fear, Erna raced over to the door on unsteady legs, but the door burst open just as she reached for the door knob. Looming over her like an imposing shadow stood Viscount Hardy. The stink of alcohol preceded him.Lisa was desperately trying to hold him back, but Walter shrugged her off as he strode into the room and slammed the door, shutting Lisa out. He turned on Erna and grabbed a fistful of her hair.A strong wind howled outside Erna\u2019s bedroom window. It carried away the sounds of Walters shouting and cursing, as much as it carried the sounds of Erna\u2019s screaming and sobbing.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The weather got worse as the night passed, so that by the morning, a fierce gale rocketed through the city.Pavel looked anxiously through the rattling window, he felt it an ill omen that they should have such bad weather on the day he was set to return to Buford with Erna Hardy.He thought about sending Erna a telegram to delay until tomorrow, but if he sent a telegram, it could fall into the hands of the Viscount and that would be very bad news for Erna. The risk was too great.Pavel let out an anxious sigh and drew the curtains, as if denying the storm would make it go away. The room he had rented in the old stone house was damp and dusty.He was only here because of a portrait commission and being only half a days train journey from Buford, Pavel jumped at the chance. The money he got from the commission was more than enough that the Hardy family wouldn\u2019t have to worry, at least, for a little while and it was not something that would take too long.The only problem that Pavel did not anticipated, was the advanced age of the model. The old lady found it difficult to sit for any amount of time, meaning the portrait was taking longer. He should have finished two days ago, but working just from sketches could only get him so far. In the end, he should have it finished by this morning.\u201cMr Lore, the mistress says everything is in order.\u201d The butler of the old lady finally said.Pavel rushed down the halls with great strides and haste. Was it him or did the corridors of the old place seem a lot longer today?All the while Pavel kept muttering to himself\u00a07 o\u2019Clock under the old clock tower.\u00a0As if repeating the promise would make time go faster. Light flashed out of the window and thunder rumbled over head in a slow peel of noise. The rain didn\u2019t look like it was going to stop at all today.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The social club was packed to the brim with card players. The harsh storm outside meant everyone took refuge inside for entertainment today.Bjorn\u2019s carriage stopped under the porch of the front of the social club. He lightly got off as is he didn\u2019t have a care in the world. His life was kind of peaceful despite the scandal that had reignited. He was not the point of that sword anyway, it was the one Erna Hardy.Bjorn exchanged greetings with the bus boy who opened the door before him and made his way directly to the card room. Stale smoke, trivial chatter and soft giggles followed him all through the social club. People seemed to have completely forgotten about the storm outside.\u201cOh, here we go. Didn\u2019t you take enough from us in that big stake the other day, your highness.\u201d Leonard said through laughter. \u201cNone of us have seen one wit of Miss Hardy since that day.\u201dBjorn simply settled into his chair and sparked a cigar into life. Leonard knew that Bjorn was just playing around, not rising to his goading, it was his way.Although the childish banter made everything seem in fun, Bjorn couldn\u2019t help but feel a twinge of guilt. This was all meant to be harmless fun, but their actions have potentially ruined a young woman\u2019s life. The root cause of which is entirely because of his participation in the game.What should he care about anyway? He was the heartless poison mushroom prince, why should he care about a woman he has already lost interest in? He probably wouldn\u2019t even raise an eyebrow if the story of Erna Hardy was ever brought up again. If the likes of Princess Gladys are insignificant to him, what hope does a destitute young woman, from a broken house have?There was no way he was able to help Erna Hardy and there was only a problem if he ever intended in getting back together with Princess Gladys and since he had no intention of ever speaking to that woman again, there was no problem.People\u2019s affections and devotion toward the crown prince and princess was unusual. They made it up like it was some fairy tale match between an irreplaceable pair. By the time the news of the engagement circled the city, they were already the main characters in a narrative that made them more popular than any musician or artist.People watched their every move and loved the stories that poured from them. A love story, complete with a perfect wedding, was the best selling story in all of Lechen. Crowds flocked to the streets on the day of their wedding. Commemorative coins sold out in no time and portraits of the couple hung in every single home.Bjorn and Gladys were the figure heads of the royal family and even those who didn\u2019t support the union between Lechen and Lars were onside with the royal couple. So when they got divorced, a huge rift opened up between the two countries and the only way to resolve it was for Bjorn to strep down as the Crown Prince.Once Peter returned from the toilet, Leonard dealt out he cards and they were able to begin play. Leonard and Peter exchanged glances, before focusing all their attention on the cards in front of them.While they cursed Bjorn\u2019s name, most of the supporters of the union still had portraits of the Crown Prince and Princess in a drawer or cupboard some where. Their anger was still hot because of how much they wanted the fairy tale to resume with their two favourite protagonists. There was not a single person out there who didn\u2019t hope for Bjorn and Gladys to reuinte.\u201cThis weather is crazy,\u201d Peter said, organising his cards.Bjorn looked up and out of the window. The scene painted beyond like a landscape picture was a distorted one of dirty water, as it continuously cascaded down the window. It was certainly a dramatic picture.Will she be able to fulfil her wishes?He rested his chin in his hands as he considered what Erna had told him. Either way, by tomorrow he will know the answer, lets hope the raid eases off in the meantime. Success or failure, why did he care so much? Bjorn let out a sigh and chuckle to himself.\u201cBjorn?\u201d Leonard said, bringing Bjorn back into the room.He looked down at the table and realised the others had been waiting on him. His cool eyes encapsulated the table and all the complicated numbers he saw there. He noticed the clock on the wall said it was nearly 5.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had a wide brimmed bonnet and a hooded cape, but they did little to protect against the wind and the rain. When she finally got to the fountain, she rested the suitcase on the railing and took a breath. It wasn\u2019t the weight of her burdens that made her short of breath, it was this cursed wind and rain.\u201cJust hang on a little longer,\u201d\u00a0 Erna kept muttering to herself.She hoisted the suitcase and pressed on once more, stopping only once she reached the carriage stop. The umbrella was pretty much useless in this wind and had already broken several times. Each time Erna coaxed it back into shape, only to have it blown out again.You look like your mother.\u00a0Walter Hardy had said before leaving her in a mess in her bedroom.\u00a0I don\u2019t know how that old man raised you, but here, you make a mistake, you get punished.\u00a0He looked down at Erna, who was like a broken rag doll on the floor. He walked away casually.Lisa came to her side and wept for her mistress. The strange thing is that Erna was no sad. It was going to be alright, she thought, it was going to be all over tomorrow, she kept telling herself.Erna let Lisa tend her injuries and took the medicine she brought. Erna didn\u2019t skip dinner, being sure to chew thoroughly and swallow. She wanted to make sure that everything went as it should so that she could leave safely. She didn\u2019t want to think about anything else.The sound of approaching horses made Erna dip her head and hide her face, but the carriage was empty, people were very reluctant to venture out in the rain. She crouched down in the far corner, keeping herself as well hidden from outside view as possible. She remained hunched up in the corner like this until the carriage finally stopped at the old clock tower neat the station.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d The panic in Pavel\u2019s voice made the words seem more forceful than he intended.\u201cSorry sir, a rockslide is blocking the tracks, we are going to be stuck here for awhile.\u201d The conductor replied, seemingly ignoring Pavel\u2019s harsh tone.\u201cHow long, do you think?\u201d Pavel said, worry lines wrinkled his forehead as he heard the news.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell at this point, we will get moving as soon as we can, don\u2019t worry, sir.\u201d The conductor said, pressing past Pavel to inform the rest of the trains passengers.Pavel gave up pacing up and down the carriage and returned to his booth. A middle-aged man was sat on the opposite seat, reading a newspaper. Pavel looked out the window and saw the drenched work gangs going by, the work was going to be too slow.\u201cThere\u2019s no point stressing, my dear boy,\u201d the old man said while still looking down at the paper. \u201cLandslides are quite frequent on these parts. Why not occupy yourself with dinner, I was just about to go myself. Care to join me?\u201d\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Pavel said. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry right now.\u201d\u201cSuite yourself, but don\u2019t get too lost in your head, or you\u2019ll miss dinner and that wont be healthy for you.\u201dPavel was left alone in the booth and the silence only grated on his anxiety. He couldn\u2019t believe his luck. It thought it was good, when the train arrived nearly an hour earlier than the allotted time, but soon realised it was bad. This was crazy enough to make him think someone was purposefully trying to sabotage him.The old man came back from the dinning cart. Pavel was brought out of his despair and hadn\u2019t noticed that all that time had passed. He looked at his watch, it was fast approaching the appointed time.\u201cI suppose you have an important engagement to get to?\u201d The old man said.\u201cYes,\u201d Pavel said dryly. \u201cDo you know if there is a village near by?\u201d\u201cOh, it wont be that long, no need to look for a place to stay, if that\u2019s what your thinking.\u201d\u201cNo, not that\u2026\u201d Pavel looked out of the window with desperate eyes, he had never broken a promise before and Erna will be arriving at the meeting spot right now. \u201cI need some where that might have a station wagon that can get me to Schuber. Or maybe I can rent a horse.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The result was always the same, the Grand duke took the pot and Leonard and Peter were left feeling a lot lighter. If you\u2019re going to play against Bjorn Dniester, you\u2019re going to lose. It has become a very solid saying in the social club.\u201cOh, you\u2019re going already?\u201d Peter said as Bjorn rose from the chair. \u201cI was feeling lucky, I have not lost nearly as much as I normally do.\u201d\u201cWhy not stay longer?\u201d Leonard added.\u201cYou boys really want me to run you into the ground?\u201d Bjorn pointed at Peter and Leonards significantly reduced pile of chips.They exchanged profane jokes and laughter as Bjorn collected up his winnings and tidied up his jacket. Once he left the smoke filled room, his mind cleared up a little and he found himself thinking of Erna again. What ever happened would have happened by now and a part of him felt loss thinking she might be on her way back to Buford.\u201cTake me by the station.\u201d Bjorn ordered the coachman as he stepped into his carriage. He knew it was a dangerous curiosity, but he felt the desire to see it through.\u201cYou\u2019re not planning on taking the train, your highness? I hear there\u2019s been trouble down the line.\u201d The coachman said, adjusting his coat to defend against the rain.\u201cNo, just drive me past it.\u201dBjorn felt something niggle at the back of his mind at hearing the news and he stared out at the passing lights. He looked bored of the gloomy city, but inside he was trying to work things out. He only knew that Erna was running away tonight, he didn\u2019t know for sure she was going to take the train, not to mention which train they were going to catch.Erna.Bjorn whispered the name to the rain streaked window, seeing her face reflected in each droplet. It had been a week since he had last seen Erna Hardy. Her eyes were as big and bright as a lost little child. Missing in action. A sad little girl who\u2019s forgotten how to cry.He didn\u2019t feel any longing, his eyes were blank as he looked out into the world. Recently he had been feeling that something was off, like he\u2019d brushed off a helpless child wanting comfort. Not quite like guilt, but like he was being sloppy. He kept asking himself where this feelings comes from, but he can never find an appropriate answer.The carriage came to a stop outside the train station and the sudden jerking brings Bjorn out of his thoughts.As expected, the train station was bleak and empty. No doubt the news of the trains not running because of a land slip forced everyone to find alternative means of travel. There were a few people milling about, but Bjorn doubted Erna would have hung around like a tramp at this hour. She might have found some where else to stay for tonight. She\u2019s sane enough not to return back to the Hardy Mansion.Bjorn laughed it off. He was being immature, trying to chase down a woman he had no interest in. Just as he opened the carriage door to tell the driver to take him home, he noticed a figure struggling with a trunk at the far end of the plaza.The small, slender woman waddled her away across the plaza to the old clock tower. She stumbled along, dragging the trunk behind her and Bjorn felt for sure she was going to fall a couple times.Just as Bjorn was getting annoyed at the rain falling on him, the woman looked up at the rain, knocking back the hood of her cloak. She still wore a wide brimmed bonnet, but he was sure he could make out the face and the tumbling brown hair.\u201cNo way.\u201d Bjorn muttered.He looked at his watch, it was some time after 11 and Bjorn couldn\u2019t believe his premonition. This was not the time for the pair of them to be roaming around in the rain together and as quiet as the streets were, there was always a witness.\u201cErna.\u201dHe whispered the name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The rain had started up not long after she found Pavel\u2019s house say cold and empty.They had agreed to meet under the clock tower in the afternoon, but as the sun started to set and he hadn\u2019t showed yet, Erna went to his house. That\u2019s when the rain started and she returned to the clock tower.It was getting close to midnight now and Erna\u2019s eyes were growing heavy. She looked up and down the water logged streets with half closed eyes. They were empty, cold and dark, just like everything else in her life.Without the money Pavel promised, she could not return to Buford. She didn\u2019t want to return to Hardy Mansion either, but she was wasn\u2019t going to be able to escape her father. She could always go to the train station, do what ever she could to get back to Buford and even if the trains were not running this late, she could find some where to stay for the night.Erna struggled to keep her eyes open. She couldn\u2019t stay here, she needed to get to the station and wait for Pavel, maybe he was already there, maybe he meant the clock tower in the station, not that it was an actual clock tower, more a clock face on the front of the building.With renewed hope, Erna could feel warmth spread to her stiff limbs and she rose up. Her legs wobbled from being cramped up for hours and buckled.Erna could not fight the emotions any more. Anxiety gave way to despair and she let herself give completely over to sadness. She cried as she sat on the cold, wet floor. The rain hid her tears. She felt abandoned and truly alone. She wished above all else that she was home in Buford, with her Grandmother, sitting by a warm fire.The rain stopped suddenly. Erna looked up from crying into her hands. The rain had stopped for her, but she could still hear the pitter patter on concrete. Above the\u00a0long shadow cast by the light of a gas lamp,\u00a0she saw a pair of polished shoes standing close.and when she looked up\u2026.\u201cPavel?\u201d She was about to ask, but the person she saw was\u2026.Prince Bjorn.Erna couldn\u2019t believe her eyes. It was dark, she was tired, tears blurred her vision, but it was still Bjorn that stood there, holding an umbrella over her.Bjorn didn\u2019t know how to handle the situation and just stood there, staring down at the hapless woman. They stared at each other for a long while, until a flash of lightning lit them up and the sound of thunder pushed them to action.Bjorn offered a hand, but Erna turned away from him. He considered her with his cold, grey eyes and face as implacable as ever. He knelt down beside her and turned her face toward hers by gently grabbing her chin. She trembled at his delicate touch.Bjorn sighed and muttered a curse under his breath, Erna did not hear. He moved his hand to cup Erna\u2019s cheek and ever so gently turned her face to meet his. She finally looked up at him properly and they froze in time as their eyes met.Bjorn looked at Erna until the trembling stopped. Her eyes were bright and clear, but so full of sorrow, even in her surprise to see him, just like the time on the riverside. Bjorn thought that was the last time he was going to get to see her.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna looked at Bjorn with wonder and was stuck some where between dream and reality. The running carriage, the pouring rain, sight clouded by heat and in the middle of it all, Bjorn\u2019s face. It was like a very vivid dream.Why was he there?Did he know she was there? Was he looking for her?The questioned flickered through her tired mind, but Erna couldn\u2019t say anything because of struggling to stay awake, there was no energy for talking, only sleep.\u201cI don\u2019t know who you were waiting for, Miss Hardy, but it seems like that person is not coming. He abandoned you.\u201d Bjorn said. Erna barely heard, she was struggling with keeping her eyes open and the rocking carriage didn\u2019t make it any easier.She tried to deny it, refusing the Prince\u2019s cold words, but what else could it be? It was already past midnight by the time she reluctantly climbed into the carriage and she promised she would give Pavel until midnight. Had he really abandoned her, her long time friend?Bjorn let out a frustrated sigh. The cape and hat were water logged and clung to her body irritated him. He thought about throwing them away and being done with his irritation, but thought it would be more irritating without them, allowing the cold wind to bite at her skin.He watched Erna as she slowly drifted off to sleep and realised it was not her clothes that irritated him, it was her situation. It was clear to him now that it wasn\u2019t just forced marriage that pained this woman. The moment he saw her bruised face he realised. It was probably all the scandal that turned a ruthless man to violence against this beautiful flower.The first time Erna hid away from the public eye was soon after the first scandal hit the streets. Now Bjorn figured out why. Not out of shame, or to keep a low profile, but because her own father turned his maliciousness on her. He scratched his most expensive and valuable wares. Walter Hardy was a pitiful merchant and a pitiful man.Cold anger seethed through him.\u00a0There was so much of tonight that made him angry, from the moment he saw Erna collapse under the clock tower, to the realisation of her father and no doubt the man she was waiting for. It had to be a man, why else would Erna willingly wait out in the bitter rain?She was probably going to run away with this disgraceful man that abandoned such a sweet rose. What hurt more was that this man was probably a close friend to Erna, or pretended to be, he probably took her money, promising to sort out all the travel arrangements and then flee the city at the last minute.Only thing is, Bjorn knew Erna didn\u2019t have enough money to attract scam artists, she barely had money selling flowers to pay off her debt to him and that\u2019s when he had a thought. Erna had one other friend in the city, someone he had seen her with many times, an artist, Pavel, was it?Bjorn remembered seeing him at the Royal Academy of Arts, that\u2019s how he knew he was an artist. He was burly, red haired young man. He seemed bright enough and not at all like someone who would go out of his way to harm a young lady.Bjorn suddenly thought of the Genius Poet of Lars. It was an unexpected memory of the man that had taken Gladys from him. He died a couple years ago, before he even turned thirty. A talented artist who passed away young.With a cynical laugh, Bjorn scrubbed the thoughts from his mind and looked out the window. The dark, empty streets were so quiet, save for the clopping of horses\u2019 hooves and being drawn to the sound, he could hear the approach on the other side of the road and sure enough, a single horse\u00a0 trundled past and driving was a burly red haired man.Pavel Lore, that was his name. Seeing the face made Bjorn remember the name. He had been wrong, Pavel had not abandoned Erna.The perfect manner in which seemingly random events fell in line made Bjorn smile as he watched the man trundle past. At least one thing was different from what he guessed, but it was not to Bjorn\u2019s liking.Thunder rumbled over head and Erna stirred from her shallow slumber. She looked about with a vacant stare, the brief nap fogging her memory. She looked like a lost child and it rubbed against Bjorn\u2019s nerves.The moment she looked out the window, Bjorn reacted instinctively and closed the curtains. There was no way she could spot Pavel now, but he wasn\u2019t willing to take that risk. Erna looked at him blankly, but sank back into her seat.With the situation back under predictable control, Bjorn let out a deep sigh and closed his eyes. They sat in silence for the rest of the journey. It wasn\u2019t a long before the carriage turned into Tara Boulevard, where the Hardy Mansion was.The driver knocked on the door to let the passengers know they were at their destination. Bjorn moved to take Erna into his arms, wrapping a spare cloak around her as he did so, then he had a thought.He opened the door and gave the driver an order, who was surprised at the words spoken to him, but Bjorn was the Prince and so, the driver followed his order without question, confused as he was.Bjorn tried to put Erna back into her seat, but she nestled into him like he was a giant teddy bear, no doubt finding the warmth of him comforting. She stirred a little as the carriage moved off again. It did not go to the Schuber Palace, but to somewhere in the northern part of the city.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was being neither calm, nor graceful, but she didn\u2019t care. People like Walter Hardy you just have to come right out and say what\u2019s on your mind and don\u2019t give him chance to dance around the topic of concern.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Walter said. He stank of alcohol and had a slack jawed expression on his face. His hair was greasy and his complexion was deathly pale. Along with his sloppy outfit, the Baroness could see that Walter had fallen a long way since the last time she saw him.\u201cI\u2019m talking about you giving Erna back into my care.\u201d The Baroness said once more.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want Erna to leave with you any more, you\u2019re a terrible father and you have ruined that poor girl\u2019s reputation.\u201d\u201cLook here, you old crone, if it wasn\u2019t for me you would have lost the house, so you should be more careful about the accusations you throw around.\u201d Walter said.\u201cI don\u2019t need that house.\u201d The Baroness bluffed, sticking out her neck. She had been willing to lose the house ever since she discovered how Erna was being treated and the few employees that worked at the mansion felt the same. As lovely as it was to have the summer house, nothing was more precious to the Baroness than Erna.\u201cIts just a house,\u201d the Baroness continued. \u201cKeep it, sell it, do as you wish, but I am not leaving without Erna.\u201dThe Baroness was clear and strong about her demands, she had been rehearsing what she was going to say on the long journey to Schuber. She executed flawlessly, with the right authoritative tone and harsh demands. She made sure not to leave Viscount Hardy any room for negotiation.\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d Walter said, stuck for words. He looked at his ex-mother-in-law with narrowed eyes and a fierce expression, so did Brenda, who sat beside Walter.\u201cErna didn\u2019t go back to Buford?\u201d Brenda said softly, the Baroness almost didn\u2019t hear her.\u201cWhat do you mean, Erna went back to Buford?\u201d All the sharpness had gone from the Baroness and now her voice was trembling a little. Had they lost Erna?Walter let out a harsh laugh, sobering a little, maybe the old woman didn\u2019t know where Erna was after all. He didn\u2019t seem like the type to secret away a young girl, he had doubted Erna would have run away with him in the first place, but then, the cunning little thing had run away all the same, but where?It was the morning after the storm that they realised Erna was gone. They were brought about the knowledge of her disappearance by Erna\u2019s maid, Lisa, who called out and dropped the breakfast tray she had been carrying.Erna Hardy has disappeared.Walter had drunk the night away and was in no state to do anything about Erna running off. It was nothing to worry about, after all, the only place she could go was back to that pokey little village. He intended to go out and get her back when he sobered up and could be bothered. Now that her value was minimal, there was no rush in marrying her off.He had to take this seriously now. His throat burned and his lips were dry. A pounding started thudding in his head and he felt a dizziness come over him.The Baroness got to her feet and let out an impatient sigh.\u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t so drunk, you might have noticed your own daughter running off.\u201d The Baroness said with all the malice she could muster. Her bitter words echoes around the parlour and made all the servants gave the old woman a sidelong glance. She came to them from the country, in her old fashioned dress and dusty old jewellery and spoke to the Viscount as she did.\u201cI was a fool to send Erna away to you, just because you were her father.\u201d The Baroness continued. Her legs could barely keep her upright and she left on shaky legs, fire and malice pouring forth in her words.\u201cMadam, are you okay?\u201d Mrs Greve asked as the Baroness came out of the drawing room. She had been pacing up and down the hallway and approached Baroness Baden with tears in her eyes. The Baroness took up Mrs Greve\u2019s hands and gave them a light squeeze.\u201cErna is\u2026I need to speak to an officer.\u201d The Baroness said.\u201cA police officer?\u201d\u201cYes, they say Erna is not here.\u201d Baroness Baden glanced at Mrs Greve with tears in her blue eyes. \u201cShe has run away.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Unlike the leisurely south, which was more like a resort, the north was much busier and more dynamic. Schuber was the central port city of Lechen and to say that it was the busiest in all the continent was not a stretch. It was certainly one of the most financially prosperous.There was no sign of the storm any more and as Bjorn stood on the balcony that over looked the harbour, across a forest of masts that stretched out to the sky, he looked up and bathed in the warm sun. It was a typical Lechen summer day.The town house was in a particularly good location. Located right on the edge of the residential area and the financial district. He brought it as soon as it was put on the market. The previous owner fell for some investment scam and had to sell a lot of assets to cover the loss.It was close to the bank, so he had a place to put his feet up when he was in the area on business and the resale value would see a lot of profit come his way. It was also discreet enough to blend in with the other town houses on the road.It was for this reason that Bjorn chose this location. He let himself smile as he looked back over his shoulder into the house, beyond the gently fluttering net curtains. He paid particular attention to the locked door of one of the bedrooms.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d Mrs Fitz said. She was looking at him with a stern expression and held a tea tray.\u201cMrs Fitz.\u201d Bjorn replied.When Bjorn had brought Erna to this town house, he immediately sent for his own doctor and for Mrs Fitz. He knew he could trust these two above all else, even if the doctor grated against Mrs Fitz\u2019s nerves.Mrs Fitz had scolded him for bringing the young Hardy family girl to the town house, but seeing her pale complexion, she soon changed her tune. The doctor confirmed what Bjorn had suspected and now Miss Erna laid up in bed, sick. Bjorn still owed Mrs Fitz an explanation.When he told Mrs Fitz all that had transpired that night, he felt like a child again, under her stern gaze. He waited for the admonishment, but it seemed the old nanny felt sympathy for the young girl, more than feeling like Bjorn needed a telling off.At that moment, as Mrs Fitz stood by the balcony window, Bjorn felt like she was about to start up with telling him off again. She looked like she wanted to punish him a thousand times over. He knew what she was expecting and like a responsible prince, he intended to care after Miss Hardy.Bjorn strode from the balcony, back into the town house and knocked on the locked door. There was the sound of hurried movement, before a soft voice finally answered.\u201cCome in.\u201dBjorn went into the room, closely followed by Mrs Fitz with a full tea tray, she busied herself preparing the breakfast, while Erna sat on the edge of the bed and Bjorn propped himself against the window.They sat in silence for a long while, even after Mrs Greve left. Erna stared down at her hands, which she had not stopped fidgeting with the entire time. She became distinctly aware of the ticking of the clock.\u201cHave some tea.\u201d Bjorn said.Erna looked up at him with wide eyes, as he offered her a tea cup. She did her best to hide the trembling as she took the cup. It looked like a child\u2019s doll house ornament in his hands. He had rather large hands, she realised this when he held her cheek on the night of the storm, three days ago. As Erna recalled the way he had held her, she blushed and looked down at the tea.She felt like she was outstaying her welcome and had spoken to the woman who had introduced herself as Mrs Fitz about leaving. Mrs Fitz said Erna was being silly and she could not go any where until she was much better. No matter what Erna said, the answer was always the same.Mrs Fitz was right, of course, even if Erna had thoughts of running away again, she couldn\u2019t. The sickness she caught out in the rain, firmly kept her confined to the bed. She was only just starting to find the strength to get up and move about.\u201cThanks to you, your highness, I am well again.\u201d Erna said, putting down the tea cup.Bjorn looked down at Erna, studying her rosy cheeks, pouty lips and the thin nape of her neck. He stopped when he looked at the bow of her dress, that sat perfectly central on the neckline. She did not look as sickly as she had done, but she was still pale. Bjorn laughed as the memory of the night came to him.The bonnet and cloak had been removed, but Erna was soaked through to the skin. She could not lay down in the wet cloths, so simply leaned against the couch. She stood there, shivering with her eyes closed.\u201cYou need to change out of those wet clothes immediately.\u201d Bjorn demanded.Erna was surprised at Bjorn\u2019s forceful words and when she didn\u2019t comply right away, he came over and roughly started pulling at her dress.\u201cI, I can do it. I can do it myself.\u201d Erna said, feebly pushing the Prince away.Bjorn realised that she may think he was aiming to molest her in her weakened state, so he quickly stepped away and let Erna remove the wet clothes herself. All he could do was bring her a towel and her trunk.He then left the room, but kept an ear to the door just in case Erna should collapse. There was the sounds of thumping and scraping, groans and heavy sighs. He could hear her rummaging through her trunk.Bjorn looked down at his pocket watch when things got a little too quiet for his liking. It had been ten minutes. Was it better to be accused of being a molester, than have a young girl\u2019s life on his conscience?So, Bjorn let himself in.Erna was laid out on the couch in her pyjamas and soaking up the heat of the fire. To his surprise, she had managed to get all her clothes on straight and all the buttons done up properly. She had even managed to tie the ribbon of the night gown.Bjorn very softly walked up to Erna and gingerly picked her up and cradled the surprisingly light girl in his arms. He took her to the guest bedroom and laid her under the warm blankets.\u201cI\u2026Your Highness?\u201d Erna said softly, half asleep. \u201cThank you,\u201d was all she could manage.\u201cIt\u2019s okay Miss Hardy, get some rest.\u201d\u201cNo, I can not let you get involved\u2026scandal.\u201d She muttered. \u201cI have a friend, he\u2026worried, looking for me.\u201d\u201cA friend, you mean Pavel Lore?\u201d Bjorn said.Erna\u2019s eyes shot open at the mention of the name and she looked at the Prince, confused. Bjorn simply looked at her with a smile.\u201cRight, Pavel Lore, the promising artist from the academy. He tried to escape with you, didn\u2019t he?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She never took her gaze from the prince as she became lost to her own memory. She became unreserved.\u201cSo no one knows except the Prince.\u201d Erna said.She gripped the end of her shawl tightly as she asked in a low tone, casting her eyes as she did. It seemed like she understood the situation now.\u201cMaybe,\u201d was all the Prince said, in his usual flat tone.\u201cWhat a relief, I was so worried if word had spread.\u201d She smiled nervously.The smile distorted the bruising on her face from her fathers beatings. No doubt she had some on her body as well, but Erna smiled as she talked about Pavel.Could it be that they are in fact lovers? As bewildered as Bjorn is, Erna\u2019s smile grew brighter.\u201cPlease keep it secret, your Highness, please, if rumors were to spread, Pavel would be in a lot of trouble.\u201d Erna bowed as she asked.\u201cWhy? There are most likely already rumours spreading of your attempt to run away with a lover. Maybe you should prepare for that.\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cWhat? Me and Pavel\u2026lovers? It\u2019s not like that at all.\u201d Erna said, eyes wide.\u201cOh, well I had assumed, the rest of the city will too.\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cPavel is a friend, he is practically family, we would never\u2026\u201d Erna cut herself, thinking. \u201cHe was just going to lend me money and help me get back to Buford. He was heading back anyway, so offered to take me with him.\u201d\u201cFor money?\u201d Bjorn said.Erna shrunk away as she realised she had let out more than she intended, how did she keep getting caught out by this man? She felt like she wanted to disappear somewhere and forget about pride.\u201cWhy do you borrow money from Pavel Lore?\u201d Bjorn asked.His eyes deepened as he looked at her. She had thought his eyes were so beautiful when she looked into them at the festival. That made her even more miserable. It would have been nice if that moment had never happened.Embarrassed by the fleeting memory, Erna bowed her head and caught sight of her lace gowns laid out on the table. With them came the memory of her soaking wet, in the rain and seeing Bjorn\u2019s carriage trundling out of the dark. The water that dripped from her dirtied the prince\u2019s pristine carriage.\u201cMiss Hardy,\u201d Bjorn\u2019s voice urged.With her eyes closed, Erna lifted her head in resignation. She would liked to have been brave and bold, but this was all she could muster for now.\u201cTell me, Miss Hardy.\u201d Bjorn\u2019s grey eyes pierced into her soul, but they were still as beautiful as that night on the river.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Pavel was about to leave when someone knocked on his door, it was Baroness Baden with Mrs Greve, her tear streaked face peered up at him from around the door.\u201cBaroness Baden.\u201d Pavel said.\u201cPavel, oh my, Pavel, my dear. Our Erna is missing.\u201d The Baroness said.When their eyes met, the old woman started to sob once again, no doubt spurred on by the memories of watching Pavel and Erna play together. Mrs Greve did her best to comfort Baroness Baden.It was a completely discomforting situation, but Pavel let the ladies in and escorted them to the sitting room. Along the way they explained the situation as best they could, including coming to Lechen to rescue Erna from the cruel society of the city, and ending with finding out that Erna had run away. All the while, fighting a losing battle with the tears and sorrow.\u201cIt\u2019s been over a day since we reported it, but no one has seen a single strand of hair.\u201d The Baroness said. She wiped the tears away with the corner of a kerchief. \u201cI told them about you, being the only other person Erna knew in the city, I hope that didn\u2019t get you into any trouble.\u201d\u201cNo, No of course not Baroness.\u201d Pavel said quietly. He felt like he was being strangled.He recalled the night as clear as if it just happened. The rockfall showed no signs of being cleared up in good time, so Pavel headed out to look for a stagecoach, or anything that could be heading to Schuber. All the stagecoach depots were closed for the night and the only thing Pavel could find was a post station.The officers profiteering saw Pavel pay four times as much to borrow a horse, but he was desperate and paid what the man asked. He was terrified of letting Erna down and wanted to be on the road as quick as possible.Pavel felt shameful that he didn\u2019t make it in time and now he was racked with guilt. It kept him up at night as he worried about what might have happened to Erna because he didn\u2019t make it in time.She had not been at the station, or under the clock tower. He shouted himself hoarse, as he rode all over town, calling her name and catching a cold at the same time. He worried that she got caught sneaking out of the house. Or maybe she got cold feet and decided not to go, or maybe she decided to head to Buford on her own.It had been dawn by the time Pavel had given up searching the streets and went round to the Hardy Mansion. The maid was the one who answered the door, who told Pavel that Miss Hardy was sick in bed and could not come to the door.The maid had shot him a wary look and told him not to come back, as Miss Hardy would be laid up for quite some time. The maid turned back into the house and left Pavel standing on the porch. He breathed a little easier, knowing that Erna had made it safely back home, but there was something in the way the maid looked at him.Pavel sent a letter, but there was no reply, maybe all he had to do was wait for Erna to get better, then when she was ready, she would contact him again. He hoped that would be the case. It had been days since the intended run away and there hadn\u2019t been a single whisper of Erna. Pavel was starting to get worried all over again.Something must be wrong.Pavel came to this conclusion when the errand boy came back for a third time empty handed. The atmosphere around the Mansion was still calm, but it was clear that there was something amiss. He then bumped into Baroness Baden as he was about to set off and conduct his own investigation.\u201cPavel, my dear boy, are you okay?\u201d The Baroness asked.She examined him and could see concern on his face. The face any boy made when they were about to do something foolish. Pavel looked at the Baroness with a flushed face.He had to tell the Baroness, but he had no idea how. She needed to know what was really going on between Erna and the Viscount, but what\u2019s the point now that Erna is missing? There was no point in piling on yet more sadness on this old woman. But what if Erna was not really missing?\u201cYes, Baroness, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Pavel said. His palms felt clammy.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. The Baroness reassured him.Even during the moment of cowardly evasiveness, Pavel would have to face the truth and at the very least, tell the police officer.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cI\u2019ll give you the money.\u201dBjorn finally broke the silence that had stood between them for a long moment. Even though Erna understood the words and their meaning, she stared at him blankly, not entirely sure she did know what the words meant.\u201cThe money you were going to borrow from Pavel Lore, I will give it to you instead.\u201d Bjorn said, hoping the clear explanation would help.Viscount Hardy was a despicable man for using his daughter to clear his debts and decent into poverty. To make a deal with a young girl, promising to let them keep Baden Mansion in Buford, all so that he could get her to Lechen and sell her off in marriage. Erna had suffered nothing but hardship since coming to the cityIt was not enough for him to get involved in the affairs of a disgraceful man and his young daughter, but part of Erna\u2019s hardship was his fault. If he had not crossed paths with the young girl, then none of the rumours would exist.It was no revelation that it had all been because of money. The one thing that he could give her, to help even if just a little. It felt a little underhanded, but he hoped that if he gave her the money he got from winning the bet over her, maybe that would cancel the dirty feeling.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miss Hardy, this is not another debt to fall into.\u201d Bjorn said. He wanted to reassure her that this was not like the time with the Deer Antler Trophy.\u201cYour Highness, you would just give me money?\u201d Erna said. \u201cWhy?\u201dShe looked at Bjorn warily and blushed. As expected, Erna was a little cautious about excepting money from him, without any thought of returning the favour.Bjorn sighed and looked out the window to order his muddled thoughts. He didn\u2019t want to owe her anything and he didn\u2019t want her to owe him, especially not emotionally. Emotional debt was especially abhorrent to him. Erna would be stubborn about taking the money, and with good reason.A knock came at the door just as Bjorn turned back to Erna and was about to speak\u201cYour highness, its Mrs Fitz.\u201d\u201cCome in,\u201d Bjorn sighed.Mrs Fitz pushed open the door and came only a little way into the room. She seemed bewildered and maybe a little flustered, it must be something important.\u201cAn order from his Majesty, the King, you are to attend him at the palace at once, your highness.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNormally, a missing girl is handled by the lower ranks of the police commission, but due to the identity of the missing girl, the Police Chief decided to tackle this one personally.Erna Hardy, the focal point of a lot of contention in the city right now, all centred around the Royal Family, namely Prince Bjorn. The Police Chief had authority of the Royal Family thanks to Philip III and another missing persons case some years prior, so the Police Chief was the only one that could handle the case properly.As always, he started the case by asking a few simple to answer questions to get his deductive reasoning working.Who is Miss Hardy? If the rumours are to be believed, she is the lover of the Grand Duke. So, who is the Grand Duke? He was the Crown Prince, but now labelled the Poison Mushroom Prince, he is still the eldest son of the King.After several of these types of questions, the Police Chief came to the conclusion that this disappearance was politically charged and the republicans would jump at the opportunity to point fingers at the Royal Family, because of the bad image such scandal brought them. So, if the girl was missing, the first suspect is the Prince.The Police Chief felt a little ashamed at accusing the Royal Family of foul play, just because a country bumpkin didn\u2019t know how the city works, he was a royalist to the core. It didn\u2019t mean he could look the other way if the Royal Family was involved in criminal plots. The least he could do was warn the King of the investigation.Fortunately the King understood, though he still flew into a rage at hearing his son may be involved in the disappearance of a young girl.\u201cGet me Bjorn, now!\u201d The King demanded.The King had always managed to maintain a benevolent aura and remain calm in the face of bad news, but this was something else, even the Queen was startled at her husbands sudden motion.By the time Prince Bjorn made it to the palace, the atmosphere was tense, Prince Bjorn was walking on thin ice as he approached his father.\u201cIt has come to my attention that Miss Hardy is missing. You better tell me the truth right now, Bjorn.\u201d The King held his anger in check for the moment, but his face was bright red.\u201cShe\u2019s not missing,\u201d Bjorn said coolly. \u201cShe is with me and I am helping her through a troubled time, it will all be cleared up soon, I promise father.\u201dBjorn remained calm and even offered a little bow. The King returned to his normal colour, though tinges of red still radiated from the fringes, he looked at Bjorn and contemplated. Had he really secreted the girl away and not said anything, to anyone, leaving her closest kin to report her missing? Even in the face of all the scandal between them two.The King let out a relieved sigh as he waved away the unimportant questions flooding his mind. He was just grateful that his son did not brake faith and had not committed such a heinous crime. He was curios as to why his son, the one everyone was labelling a cold hearted, self interested Prince, would do such a kind hearted thing. It must be to his own advantage some how.\u201cYou best clear it up.\u201d The King said, he knew that all the reporters that hung around the police station would get news of this eventually and like rabid dogs, starved for too long, would gorge themselves on this.Please don\u2019t tell me Bjorn has that Hardy girl in his heart.\u00a0The King thought to himself.\u201cHoney,\u201d the Queen said in a soft tone only for him.He looked at her and she could see the thought in his eyes as clear as if he had spoken it aloud. There was no way he could allow Bjorn to marry someone like Miss Hardy, it would be ruinous in the public eye.Is this really best?\u00a0The King thought, as he looked at his wife.His wife nodded slowly, as if reading the question in his mind. The image of Queen Isabel filled the Kings heart. The wise queen, the devoted lover and benevolent mother. She would never make a decision that would harm Bjorn.Philip could never understand Bjorn, he always seemed so cold and distant. He certainly didn\u2019t like the Hardy family, the Viscount was a charlatan, to speak nothing of the con artist. He did believe in his wife though, his lifelong companion, she always was and always will be.\u201cNow, I know Miss Hardy is a decent enough lady, contrary to rumours, but honey, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the Hardy family are a lost cause.\u201d The King said.\u201cDo you really think our son, who had the King of Lars wrapped around his finger at such a young age, would not be able to deal with the likes of the foolish Viscount Hardy?\u201dShe was certainly a girl that moved Bjorn\u2019s heart, which had never shown any interest in Gladys, who was the perfect Princess. If Bjorn missed this opportunity now, he would probably spend the rest of this life alone.Could I accept that, or approve Miss Hardy as a daughter-in-law?The thought was pointless as he had already made his mind up.\u201cOh come on, these two getting together?\u201d The King said, as if arguing with his own decision.The King\u2019s face became stern and Bjorn faced him with squinted eyes, as if he didn\u2019t know what his father was saying.\u201cFather?\u201d\u201cJust, go and marry her, if that is your will.\u201d The King said, who had become more solemn, Bjorn just looked at him, bewildered.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*A heavy silence hung over the room once the doctor had left. Erna was alone in the town house as Mrs Fitz had left for the palace with Bjorn. Erna was growing fond of Mrs Fitz, who had barely left her side for the last couple days.Erna had been staring up at the ceiling for a long while. Her body still ached and parts of her throbbed, but she was too nervous to sit still, so she got up and wrapped a shawl about her tightly and paced about.She thought about Bjorn\u2019s offer. She was going to reject him, but he got called away to the palace before she could say anything.\u201cI\u2019ll be right back, wait for me.\u201d Was all he said and rushed out the door like a flurry.She wanted to leave the town house right away, but imagined the insult that would leave behind. She would probably never see him again after that. Would that be a bad thing? She would be far, far away by then, but his offer clung to her.On that cold, wet and desolate night, she felt like the whole world had abandoned her, leaving her to her fate in the cold rain. But out of the darkness\u00a0 he came to her. He was her salvation. She remembered looking up into his eyes and was suddenly overcome with conflicting emotions. Shame and relief, love and despair. They still lingered in the corners of her mind.As she paced about the room, her head aching from trying to order her thoughts, she became dizzy and hurriedly sat in the chair by the window before she fainted. The sun was setting and splashed ambers and reds all over the sky. The light dyed Erna\u2019s pale complexion a deep tan.She should go and find Pavel, after conveying her rejection to Bjorn. Even if she couldn\u2019t find Pavel and he had truly abandoned her, she would still make for Buford.As she carefully ordered her chores, Erna\u2019s eyes did not leave the streets below, which was visible from the bedroom window. The shadows stretched out over the complicated road.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Pavel decided that he could not wait forever and returned to the Police Station the very next morning. The two old ladies from Buford in tow.\u201cIs this city really so heartless, Pavel? To treat out Erna like some worthless speck of dust.\u201d Baroness Baden said as she looked up at the police station. Her eyes were red and puffy from crying.\u201cI think they are just confused, Baroness, a lot of people are saying a lot of things and its difficult to find the truth in all of it.\u201d Pavel was angry and he did not hide it very well as he tried to convey words of comfort to Baroness Baden. \u201cYou two wait here, I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem fair to drag the Baroness and Mrs Greve all the way up the stairs especially since the two burst into tears at the slightest mention of the missing Miss Hardy.Pavel did not get very far, as an officer refused to let him up and see the officer in charge of the missing persons case. Sensing something was wrong, the officer actually came out to speak to Pavel, who was clearly upset and angry.\u201cThe investigation has been closed due to the fact that Miss Hardy is not missing.\u201d The officer said.Pavel couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing, Erna had not returned home and had not been seen in days.\u201cThat can\u2019t be, no one has seen Miss Hardy in days.\u201d Pavel desperately explained.\u201cYoung man, look here,\u201d the officer pulled out the missing persons report and showed it to Pavel. \u201cSee, the girl is not missing and it was a false report due to family error.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201d Pavel stammered.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it happens all the time, nine in ten cases involving missing aristocracy kids are like that. It\u2019s what happens when you force people into marriage.\u201d The officer gave a smirk and tossed a newspaper in front of Pavel before heading off to deal with another irate visitor.The daughter of Viscount Walter Hardy, who had been reported missing,\u00a0 was found to be living with the Grand DukePavel couldn\u2019t believe it, he re-read it several times. The article went into details about Miss Hardy and her in long standing involvement with the Grand Duke. Even going so far as to claim the pair was thought to have eloped.Pavel was horrified and snatched up the newspaper and read it again as he returned downstairs. The article was so vulgar he couldn\u2019t believe the person who wrote it considered themselves a journalist.\u201cOh my god, the old lady has collapsed.\u201d Someone shouted.Pavel looked up and saw a crowd gathering around the waiting area and his heart leapt into his mouth. He pushed through the crowd and saw the fallen Baroness Baden laid out on the floor, Mrs Greve close at hand. She was a mess and staring down at the unconscious Baroness.There was a newspaper gripped in her hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Erna pounded on the hard wood one last time, but there was still no movement beyond that she could detect.The wind buffeted her and made her stagger a little. She was able to catch herself, but let go of her trunk in the mean time. She could do nothing but watch it rattle down the stone steps. With a reserved sigh, she pulled out the letter she had prepared and slipped it between the crack of the door and went to retrieve her trunk.As she lifted the trunk, the handle broke off and Erna could feel her heart sag heavily with sadness. It was only a handle, but for some reason, it was the trigger that unleashed a heavy sadness. She closed her eyes tightly, trying to fight back the emotions swimming through her mind.Opening her eyes again, she dragged the trunk over to the stairs and looked to see if she could fix the handle in any way, but it was no use, the hinge and clasp that held it together was completely broken. Dejected, Erna flopped on the bottom step and sulked.She looked up and down the road, trying to think of what to do, but a broken trunk was one eventuality she had no counted on and she did not like the idea of dragging the heavy thing about the city. So, she waited for Pavel.She lowered her head as people passed her by, memories of last night suddenly springing to mind, she didn\u2019t want people to recognise her and generate yet more rumours and scandal.The long waiting continued long through the day and right up to sunset. She had a premonition that Pavel was not going to return, if he did not return by sunset. What was she going to do now? There was no way she could stay in the city any longer.Tiredness was starting to creep into the corners of her mind and turn her head fuzzy and distant. Resting her head on her crossed arms, supported by her knees, she was surprised by a man\u2019s voice. At first, she thought it was some lucid dreaming.\u201cErna?\u201dShe looked up as the man\u2019s voice called out to her, echoing up and down the street, her bleary eyes struggled to see who it was, but the voice was unmistakable.\u201cPavel, you\u2019re still here?\u201d She called back.There was no chance she could fight off the smile that spread across her face, even as she thought on how he had broken his promise the other night. Pavel ran up to her, his face was grim.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Pavel?\u201d Erna said, the smile melted away.\u201cI\u2026uh\u2026I need to take you to the hospital.\u201d Pavel said flatly. Then he noticed the bruises and half healed cuts on Erna\u2019s face. \u201cWhat happened to your face, was that your father? That bastard, did that bastard lay hands on you?\u201d\u201cNot now, what\u2019s going on, what happened?\u201d Erna said.There was so much to talk about, so many questions she wanted to ask, but the most important one for now was why did she need to go to the hospital?\u201cIt\u2019s your grandmother, Erna, come, we have to go right away.\u201d Pavel said and took her hand as if to lead her the whole way.\u201cWhat? Pavel, wait, what\u2019s happened to my Grandmother and why is she in the city?\u201d Erna became desperate.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cI think I was born in the wrong era.\u201dBjorn came to the conclusion as he caught a glimpse of today\u2019s tabloid tucked under an attendants arm. There was a picture of him, blown up on the front. It was a pretty good picture today.\u201cI should have been born in an age of moderate savagery, when it wouldn\u2019t have been frowned upon to cut the throats of annoying bastards.\u201d Bjorn leaned over the table and aimed his cue at the cue ball.With a gentle tap, the ivory ball rolled effortlessly down the table, threading between two balls and striking his intended target. He smiled. It was a stark contrast to the anger in his voice.Anger, Astonishment and bewilderment passed over Leonids face as he caught sight of the newspaper too. It was a dirty, provocative scandal that left no guess as to who the bastard was that Bjorn was referring too.\u201cI must admit, their writing skills are improving, I can\u2019t wait for the next episode.\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cI think this kind of cheap tactic to gain readership should be sanctioned in some way.\u201d Leonid said, lining up his shot.\u201cShould I buy it?\u201d Bjorn asked.He rested the cue against the wall as he took up his glass, the sound of ice clinking against the crystal as he took a measured sip.\u201cThanks to me, they\u2019re seeing increased revenue, I think it only fair that I should get a percentage of that profit.\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cBjorn.\u201d Leonid said in a scolding tone over the sound of clacking balls. \u201cYour turn.\u201dCrazy guy. Leonid muttered as he stepped away from the table. The game was not going in his favour today. Leonid was failing to produce even half his usual skill at the game. Normally he could make Bjorn sweat a little.He was distracted. His mother agreeing to let Bjorn marry Erna Hardy was certainly news to shock and when Bjorn came to him, all smiles and laughter, he asked if Leonid wanted to play a few frames of billiards.Leonid accepted. He had done something similar when he had decided to divorce Gladys, though that time there was a lot less smiles and a lot more threats of violence. Leonid played about as well that day as he was this day.They had played right through the day and finished up sitting side by side as the sun set in the evening, taking in the scenery on the balcony. It had been late spring and the flowers were in full bloom.\u201cAre you really going to get married?\u201d Leonid said, stepping away from the table.\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Bjorn said.Bjorn chuckled mischievously, but Leonid\u2019s expression did not change. His twin brother, twin in looks only, his mind was so much more complicated and lighter. He was like that, ever since they were young.Bjorn won, to no surprise to either of them. The twin brothers sat on the billiards table and watched the sun set out the window as they finished their drinks.The following morning, as Bjorn stood under a steady stream of hot water, he remembered the promise he had made thanks to the news his father had suddenly dropped on him. Determined to put an end to the scandal and erase her presence from his life, Bjorn hurried to the town house as soon as he was dressed.When he got there, he found that Erna had already left. She did have a letter waiting for him, should he happen to stop buy. It was a very formal thing and said nothing much beyond how grateful she was, but she did not need to borrow money.The attitude in the letter was kind of intrusive, to say the least, but Bjorn decided to let it go. He had no reason to deliver any money personally, no reason to seek out the woman. He actually felt relieved that Erna Hardy was gone. At least the headaches would finally blow away.\u201cI have decided to let you marry Erna Hardy.\u201dHis fathers words rang through his subconscious, absurd as they were, left him reeling and he leaned against the wall. She was gone now, far from the tumult of the city and back to her country bumpkin life. It won\u2019t be long and her life will be returned to normal.\u201cBjorn, I hope you find a nice lady, a good girl that will erase all the pain Gladys has caused you.\u201d\u00a0Leonids voice from yesterday came to him.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t like Miss Hardy, I don\u2019t know what mother and father think, but I mean it.\u201d\u201cAre you drunk, your highness?\u201d\u00a0Bjorn asked as he staggered around the billiards table, but Leonid showed no sign of backing down.Bjorn was thankful to see Mrs Fitz when he got back to the palace, but the expression she wore was one of concern.\u201cYour highness, It\u2019s Miss Hardy\u2026\u201d She began and then stopped, struggling to find the right words.\u201cWhat is it, tell me Mrs Fitz.\u201d Bjorn said coolly. He grew anxious at the mention of the woman he had already purged from his mind.\u201cMiss Hardy is at the Royal Schuber Hospital.\u201d\u201cHospital?\u201d Bjorn snapped.\u201cYes, erm, she is fine, it was the Baroness Baden, she collapsed at the police station and was taken in. Miss Hardy is there now, looking after the Baroness.\u201dSomething of relief tugged at Bjorn\u2019s heart, relief that Erna was not hurt. Relief that Erna was still in the city.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cYou\u2019re corrupted, you\u2019ve fallen..\u201dThat was all the Baroness could say to her Granddaughter when she saw the pale skinned child sat in the chair next to her bed. Her bony hand trembled as she massaged the side of her head.\u201cPlease, Grandma, don\u2019t excite yourself.\u201d Erna said, she got up and checked on the Baroness, showing her true kind and caring nature.\u201cDo you want to know why I\u2019m here in the first place?\u201d She gave Erna a stern, disproving look. It was a look that told Erna she no longer believed in the young girl, but no matter what, Erna was going to stan guard at her bedside.\u201cIt\u2019s common in the city, Grandma, people like gossip and spread rumours. It\u2019s the trend.\u201d Erna said, sitting back down.\u201cTrend? Trend, oh my God Erna, this city has corrupted you.\u201d Shouted the Baroness.Erna had trie to explain several times to the Baroness that the rumours were all lies and terrible lies that not even a child would fall for. The affair with the Grand Duke was a misunderstanding that people ran with and took too far. It didn\u2019t help that she kept running into the Grand Duke and he would behave in the most ungentlemanly manner.The Baroness simply lamented that she should not have sent her child here. Staying at a man\u2019s house, hanging around unwholesome people, gossip trends and now a poisonous prince. The city was a wicked place that had corrupted Erna.\u201cI need to rest.\u201d The Baroness whispered in a weary voice and shook her head.It had been a miracle that Erna had turned up like this, when she had thought to be missing for days. The Baroness had thought the worst, especially after hearing the rumours and gossip, then reading the newspaper? It was enough to put an elderly woman in an early grave and it nearly did. But still, Erna showed up as she did and she was well.\u201cYes, Grandma.\u201d Erna said. \u201cRest now, I will wake you up at meal time.\u201dErna got up and left the hospital room, only for Mrs Greve to take her place. Erna went down the hall, to the window that over looked the courtyard, at the front of the hospital. She had been holding back.She saw her reflection in the window pane and did not recognise the young girl staring back. Lousy eyes, as if she hadn\u2019t slept for days and smothered in makeup to hide all the bruises and scars.** STAY TUNE I WILL UPDATE 5 CHAPTER IN A ROW\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayErna leaned against the window frame. She was tired, her whole body was tired. She pressed the heels of her palms into her burning, wet eyes and tried to push away the sadness that dwelt there.The doctor told her that her Grandmother needed plenty of bed rest and stability. Erna didn\u2019t know how she was going to tell her Grandmother. Erna was still quite immature when it came to handling such serious matters. She decided not to tell her just yet, allow her to continue regarding her as if she were her naive granddaughter.She thought of her Grandfather. He had died of a heart attack and was found on the floor of the study. When Erna got the news that her Grandmother had been taken into hospital, after being found on the floor of the study, she ran as fast as she could to the hospital. When she got there, she could hardly breath, her chest felt heavy and hot.She came into the room where her Grandmother looked to be peacefully sleeping. It broke Erna\u2019s heart and she couldn\u2019t help but think of her Grandfather. The memory of it choked her, exacerbated by the news that she had fainted because of a weak heart.If they had not been in the middle of the city, or if Grandmother\u2019s heart was a little weaker, she would not have made it. Erna suddenly felt so alone and burst into tears.She pressed her palms into her eyes again and tried to suppress the tears. It was no good descending into self pity now, she had to be strong.Forcing herself to think about her Grandmother\u2019s recovery, enough that she can travel and then they can return to Buford together. They needed to get away from the city, and with the money Pavel had given her, she could rent somewhere nice, somewhere peaceful. Somewhere she could start fresh.\u201cAbsolute stability.\u201d The Doctor said, ensuring that Erna understood.His voice brought her back into the room and she looked up at her reflection in the window. Can absolute stability exist in life, in this place? Can it come from leaving a family mansion, filled with life long memories?\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d Erna stuttered.\u201cGood.\u201d The doctor said and left Erna alone with her Grandmother.It will surely be a big mess to move her Grandmother to Buford, but what else can be done? There is no way to protect the mansion any more. Should she have accepted Thomas Baden\u2019s proposal?When she thought it would be the easiest way, she became even more miserable. Her best efforts were becoming resolute and accepting less than optimal conditions.Erna stood at the window like a statue well into the evening. The hallway outside the room, which had been busy with visitors all afternoon, had grown quiet. She could see her reflection clearly staring back at her and the mess of her makeup the tears had made.She tried to fix it, but it was never as good as what Lisa could do, but at least it looked presentable. It felt like a mock expression of her life. No matter how much she worked at it, it never came out how she wanted and was a complete mess underneath.Erna let out a slow breath and suppressed the urge to wipe the makeup away. She put on a smile, a mask that reflected the life she wanted. She still wanted to love it as much as she could, even after all the suffocating drama. As much as she was ashamed and upset, she kept the smile on her face.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna, Erna, Erna.All through the summer it seemed to be the only name anyone ever mentioned. Here, there and every where, all people talked about was Erna. Within the modest ball rooms and lowliest cigar lounges. It was madness.The name was like tinnitus in Bjorn\u2019s ears. He closed his eyes as he tried to erase the annoyance from his mind. The card board was nearing its end, cooling down, which made sense as dawn was drawing close.Bjorn rested his chin on his fist and stared at the thin slither of light peeking in through the curtains at the far end of the room.Erna.As soon as the woman\u2019s name was mentioned, Bjorn could feel the press of a headache at his temples. When he opened his eyes, the silent waiter had placed a cup of tea on the table in front of him. The black broth was bitter and helped clear his head a little.Erna.It also cleared the woman\u2019s name in his mind too. He got word that she had rushed to the hospital, to be by her sick Grandmother\u2019s side. He also heard rumour that it was Pavel Lore that was paying for the hospital fees. Those two were definitely playing around in the night.Bjorn gave a chuckle as he considered what a woman had told him.\u201cWe\u2019re long time family friends.\u201d\u00a0She had said.Not likely. There\u2019s not a fool in the world that would spend that amount of money on family friends. Family, friends, lovers, whatever they were, Bjorn tried not to care any more. He was going to give that woman the money she needed and be done with this game. He would have done so sooner, if it wasn\u2019t for her fathers orders and absurd scandal.It came round to Bjorn\u2019s go and with an impatient huff, he played the card to end the game. The other players groaned at the expected defeat and resigned themselves to the loss.Bjorn did not reveal in the victory. He sat back in his chair, falling deeply into its warm comfort and closed his eyes. The bustle of the losers leaving the room lasted but a moment and there were not many others in the games room this early in the morning.\u201cHey Bjorn,\u201d Peter said, once everyone left. \u201cSo, um\u2026Miss Hardy\u2026.She\u2019s not a bad girl.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d Bjorn snapped.Peter was startled when Bjorn opened his eyes with a frown and looked at him with dark intent. Peter paused, not wanting to risk offending the prince, but the debt he owed Erna Hardy was too grand not to be known by pretty much everyone.A staunch supporter of Bjorn and Gladys, Peter\u2019s mother, grandmother, sister, and even Peter\u2019s little niece engaged in circulating cruel rumors about Erna Hardy and her family.\u00a0 Almost overnight, people rose up to fight this new, rising evil named Erna Hardy. The lads were the same way. Those who lacked the guts to confront Bjorn instead vented their repressed animosity on that poor woman.Peter was delighted to learn that Bjorn didn\u2019t detest or speak poorly of her; he felt a great sense of relief; otherwise, he would be the one in a very tough place being on Erna\u2019s side\u201cWell,\u201d Peter continued, finding his courage. \u201cWhat if you don\u2019t do this? Was all I was going to say. At this rate, you\u2019re going to be forced into a situation you can\u2019t revive from. Me and the other boys feel sorry for you.\u201d Peter tried to gloss over the awkward conversation with a friendly smile.Bjorn looked up at the ceiling, not saying a word or even acknowledging what Peter had said. He was growing tired of all the comments and questions people were pouring on him when it came to Erna Hardy. Go easy, be calm, he would always tell himself, but Peter was different.Everyone seemed to have the same aspirations as Louise when it came to Erna Hardy. Which boiled down to stop defending that woman and get the happy ending we all want.It was the spin everyone put on their excuses for meddling in his affairs. The false show of care and affection toward the prince, when really all they wanted to do was grab a juicy nugget of gossip to share at the next gathering and increase their status. Bjorn was getting bored of it.Bjorn looked down at the card table and his share of the chips he had won. The cards that sat face up showed queens, kings and knights. They resolved to look like Gladys, Louise and Erna. He blinked and they disappeared.Even if Erna were to disappear, he would still be left with this situation, but the drama would be aimed at another woman, even if he shared but a brief glance at another woman. The only way out, he could see, was to either marry, or die.Was his father\u2019s heart this cold and calculated, when he ordered him to marry Erna Hardy? Marriage without love, divorced without love. It was all politics and love had no room in politics.Bjorn did not think quite like that. He believed in something simpler. A clear sense of self and numbers. Like it not, it was either good, or it was bad. He did not want to deceive himself into wrapping up life in a neat little convenient lie. Not for Gladys, or for any woman and Erna Hardy was no exception.So just as he had married without love and divorced without love before. If the benefits are good and outweigh the negative, then there would be no reason why he shouldn\u2019t marry Erna.So what about Erna Hardy?She was beautiful, that was hardly up for debate and he did enjoy her company. She was like an old, ragged book, full of deficits that had no hope of yielding any benefits. If the position of the Grand Duchess was filled, at least he wouldn\u2019t have to hear about Gladys any more.\u00a0 And the significance of the role was enough to depress Walter Hardy.Bjorn shook his head as he realized he ran in circles and came back to square one. Sighing, he reached over to the poker table and grabbed a chip.\u00a0 The card table was a fitting place to resolve things of this turmoil, given that it was where it began. His tolerance was becoming thin under the mounting pressure of this bizarre circumstance.Front and Back. Head or Tail.He weighed all of the possible outcomes before launching the chip into the air. It wasn\u2019t long before he got the chip back into his hand. Bjorn slowly spread his fingers apart and saw a picture appear.Head.\u201cWhat are you doing, your highness?\u201d Peter asked, breaking the serene quiet of the games room. Bjorn realized Peter had not stopped looking at him the entire time he was in thought.\u201cOrganise and clean up.\u201d Bjorn said. He stood up, grabbed his jacket.\u201cAnything I can help with.\u201d Peter said, he felt spurred on by the prince\u2019s new found vigour.\u201cYeah, gather my chips would you? I need to head into the city.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They followed behind her like the wake of a ship.Even here, at the hospital, Erna heard people chatting amongst themselves. First it was the nurses in their little gaggles at the end of the corridor. Then it felt like people were standing around outside the door, peering in like school children.\u201cIs she really the one?\u201d Women said behind their hands, giving her sidelong glances.\u201cI know, is the prince blind?\u201d Nurses said, pretending to be talking to their clipboards.People could not believe that she was Erna Hardy, the one who beat the fair Princess Gladys for the Prince\u2019s heart. They would comment on how shabby she looked, with her plain cotton dresses and tacky make-up.\u201cIsn\u2019t she a noble lady, from a noble family? Why does she look like that? That can\u2019t be Erna Hardy.\u201dWorse still was that Baroness Baden heard these rumours from the doctors and nurses that tended her. When ever they would come to check on her or her medications, they would talk over her thinking she was asleep.\u201cIts all my fault,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let you go. I ruined your future to protect the house and now I will have to go and face your Grandfather and Annette.\u201d\u00a0As the Baroness blamed herself, tears filled up her tired blue eyes and just as she was recovering from one ailment, another threatens to take hold of the old woman. Erna could see it already, making the Baroness seem ever more tired. Her wrinkles deepened before Erna\u2019s eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t say that Grandma, the prince and I have nothing to do with one another.\u201d Erna said.\u00a0She wished she could say something to convince the Baroness that none of this was her fault, to put her mind at ease. Most were already convinced Erna was a fallen lady, but at least this one small point she can try and clear for her Grandmother.\u201cYou\u2019re really going to tell me that all this buzz is over nothing?\u201d the Baroness said.\u201cGrandma, please, you know full well that people will make up what ever stories they wish, from things they nothing about.\u201d Erna said.\u201cEven so,\u201d the Baroness looked at Erna with sad eyes. \u201cHow can you marry him and tarnish your reputation like this?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not getting married, so everything will be fine and people will see that.\u201d Erna gave a cheerful smile. \u201cJust hang in there. You\u2019ll be out of the hospital tomorrow and then we can move back to Buford. We can live happily there together. Everything here will just become a bad memory.\u201d\u201cErna, my little Erna, I can\u2019t be by your side forever. I will be with your Grandfather soon.\u201d The tears in her eyes deepened.\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Erna said and took up the old woman\u2019s hand. It felt thin and papery, and she could feel the veins.\u201cErna, please, its the sad reality of getting old. You should hold yourself back for my sake, you need to go out there and start your own family. The kind of family that will love and protect you. Not like your father.\u201d\u201cGrandma.\u201d\u201cWhat do you expect me to do, when you threaten to ruin your marriage because of me? If I could, I would throw everything that threatens to make you sad into the fires of hell.\u201d The Baroness turned away from Erna and shouted at the door. \u201cIncluding all these foul, ill tempered and mean mouthed rumour mongers.\u201d She turned back to Erna with a soft, even tone. \u201cThat terrible prince and your father, Walter Hardy and myself if you ruin your chances because of me.\u201dErna stood up abruptly, when there came a hard knock on the door.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Bjorn barged his way into the room after knocking on it, not waiting for a response. The surprise on the Directors face melted away quickly and was replaced by a quick display of emotional range. He was immediately angry that someone would have the audacity to barge into his office, to shock when he realized who it was that now stood before him, to confusion as he tried to comprehend the situation and finally something that could only be described as constipation, as he tried to recall the proper etiquette. Bjorn didn\u2019t give him chance.\u201cWhat room is the Baroness Baden in?\u201dBjorn was not demanding, or anything other than polite and firm. A far contrast to the dramatic manner in which he flowed into the room. He maintained an air of elegance about the entire scene.\u201cErm, Baroness Baden?\u201d The Director stammered.He knew the name, of course he did, she was in one of the regal suites near the back, for discretions sake, but right then, as his brain tried to catch up to the situation, he struggled with the papers on his desk as he looked for the room number.\u201cUh, yes, she\u2019s in room 15.\u201d\u201cGreat, lets go.\u201d Bjorn said, turning to leave. He paused as he noticed something on the directors desk. \u201cDo you mind if I borrow it?\u201d He said and delicately took the small red rose from a vase that was sat on the corner of the desk. In terms of roses, a darker shade of red conveys more negative meaning.Is he drunk?\u00a0The director thought, as he led the way.It wasn\u2019t an unreasonable insight, given the princes usual behaviour and it was quite late in the afternoon.The director led the prince at a fast pace along the halls. Doctors and nurses lining the halls, talking over patient files and charts, immediately stopped what they were doing and stood aside for the prince. The director could hear the rumours already, questions murmured at the back of the break room. What was the director doing with the prince?The director became enthusiastic about the royal visit and he met the eyes of the on lookers with a smug smile. When they got to the Baroness room, the director opened the door for the prince, who breezed past him and closed the door behind him, without so much as a second glance to the man.The director turned away and felt the heat rise to his cheeks as he heard a couple nurses down the hall giggling. He had his target for his rising anger.\u201cPrince\u2026\u201d Erna said.\u00a0She involuntarily stepped away and blinked rapidly, as if doing so would blink away the scene in front of her. He should not be here and had no reason to be here, so why was he here?The Baroness realized who had come into the room and made to sit up properly. Bjorn did his best to dissuade her from moving and bowed.\u201cBaroness, please don\u2019t exert yourself on my account. I am late in coming to see you, so I must apologise, I am sorry.\u201d Bjorn said.\u00a0His voice was a soft note that did not dare disturb the quiet serene of the hospital room. Mrs Greve, who was sat in the corner near the door finally let out a breath.Erna closed the rest of the distance between her and Bjorn, more to check he was really there. Why was he here, was he really only here to see the Baroness? The timing was very convenient if that was the case. A lump of sadness rose up to her throat. She hoped he had not come to trample her heart in front of her Grandmother.This was unacceptable. He should not be here and tarnish what could become her last memories of her Grandmother. Even though she appreciated him and his aid, this was unacceptable.\u201cI am also sorry to you, Miss Hardy.\u201d Bjorn said.\u00a0He looked down at Erna and she could see regret in his eyes.Was it genuine? The apology was unexpected.Go.\u00a0She wanted to say to him, but she swallowed the thought.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He said again, reading the concern on Erna\u2019s face.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes, its late, I\u2019m sorry to have kept you waiting.\u201d Bjorn gave the most charming smile he could.Erna didn\u2019t understand. She looked up at the prince and saw in his smile, but his eyes were calm. They were deep and calm as they considered her.She shrunk back and sagged her shoulders as she tried to understand the prince. It was then that the prince brought his hand out in front of her and revealed he had been holding a rose. He held it out to her.Bjorn tried a softer smile when he noticed Erna was frowning at the rose, as if in doubt. He came down onto one need and looked the woman directly in the eyes. They were sad, concerned and definitely cautious.\u201cMiss Hardy.\u201dBjorn\u2019s voice was distant to Erna, as her mind raced.***Would he be getting married soon?Bjorn asked himself the question for the hundreth time, looking down at the small silver coin flipping between his fingers. Would it be appropriate to decide such a matter in this way?He didn\u2019t have anything to gain from the marriage. She was from a humble family, with more than its humble share of complications. Walter Hardy. The royal family and society in general, would never be accepting of that little problem. It could mean it would be difficult to play the part of the Grand Duchess.It wasn\u2019t such a big deal. She might not benefit, but at least she wont cause any more harm. Like Gladys, maybe she was still holding a thorn for him, behind her sweet, innocent smile. But this weak woman\u2019s thorns aren\u2019t strong enough to hurt him.All Bjorn wanted was for Erna to live like a flower corsage she made with her own hands.Quietly,beautifully,and harmlessly.He considered the stake. It would be the easy option, to forfeit the bet and take the stake. Then he would be free of this tangle made for him, but that would only lead to his father breathing down his neck.Bjorn flipped the coin and watch it sail through the air, tumbling end over end.\u201cHead I do, TailI don\u2019t.\u201d He muttered under his breath.***\u201cErna Hardy, will you marry me.\u201d Bjorn held out the flower to Erna.Erna closed her eyes and squeezed them tightly, as if trying to erase the bizarre reality unfolding before her. When she opened them again, Bjorn was still there in front of her, kneeling on one knee.Is he really proposing me,\u00a0the prince?The fact that this was right in front of her did not make the play of it any more real. Her perception of reality seemed to slip away and the room span. She found herself looking over at her Grandmother, who seemed moved to emotion. The room span again as she looked back at the prince.How can you do this?\u00a0Erna thought.\u00a0You don\u2019t love me, a woman of nothing.Erna could feel the mood in her mind settle on resentment, she resented Bjorn for coming unbidden to the hospital. She resented that smile he wore as he looked up at her, waiting for an answer.Erna wanted to get away from this, to run as far as she could and forget about the mess unfolding before her. She reached out with a trembling hand. She would push the rose away and deny him, but as her fingertips touched the delicate petals, she hesitated.I\u2019m sorry\u00a0~ he had said.The apology was so brazen, but she was still glad for it. She doubted he really meant it, but she was still grateful that he came, late as it was.At the moment, when she wanted to hate him the most, she found herself clutching the rose of marriage proposal. The room span again.Erna fainted.Bjorn was quick to catch her and Baroness Baden immediately called out for a doctor. The doctor came through the door in the very same second. There were several doctors and nurses grouped up in the hallway.Within a heartbeat, the rumour that Prince Bjorn had proposed to the Lady Erna Hardy had spread across the city. Overdramatised stories of impulsive acts of devotion and love and a fainting happy Lady filled up the many cigar lounges, gin bars, smoke rooms and libraries.Lechen\u2019s love story abruptly ended, with a rather tragic end with the villain winning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So much so that the cup of tea she reached forward and put to her trembling lips was cold.\u201cThings were bad, at the time, I was cornered.\u201d Brenda said.\u00a0She tried to swallow, and despite the tea, her mouth was dry. She looked at Erna with a flat, soft expression, which only served to make Erna more nervous.\u201cI understand that it\u2019s upsetting for you, but you must understand\u2026\u201d\u201cYour tea is cold.\u201d Erna said, cutting Brenda off.The two women sat in silence as a maid came forward and cleared away the tea. She then poured two fresh cups and retreated to her post.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, that as rude, please continue.\u201d Erna said.\u00a0She looked up from staring at the steaming cups and faced Brenda Hardy once more. Erna was just trying to be polite, but it was clear that she didn\u2019t want to hear any more.Brenda bit her tongue though, she did not dare proceed with the interrupted conversation. Erna was to be marred to the prince, she will be the Princess Schuber and she would not be able to treat Erna how she used to. Erna was to be the cities most top lady. Brenda still saw her as the naughty little girl that ran away from home after being punished. Here she is now, returning home as a princess.When Brenda first heard the rumours of the marriage, she couldn\u2019t help but laugh. There was no way Erna would allow herself to get involved with the poisonous mushroom prince. Not even after he had ruined her marriage business, threw her life into a fire pit and with bankruptcy just around the corner.Then there was the king, Brenda felt sure he wouldn\u2019t allow such a thing to take place, but it was quite the opposite. The king set the ceremony for the end of Fall, braking with all tradition, but no one argued.This marriage was ridiculous, but it proceeded anyway. Once the proposal was common news, Erna and the Baroness Baden were moved to his town house and the Baroness began preparations.The Viscount couple, Erna\u2019s parents, were excluded from the preparations completely. A rivalry with the official royal family grew and there was no way to avoid the resentment and disrespect that followed. It was endured because the Hardy family could avoid bankruptcy with this endeavour and in a weeks time, the Hardy family will become the in-laws to the royal family.\u201cYou must understand,\u201d Brenda continued. \u201cYou should make up with your father before the wedding. The pair of you have to walk this road together and you don\u2019t want to make it more awkward than it needs to be. You should have dinner together.\u201d Brenda said, looking at Erna over the top of her tea.\u201cI don\u2019t think I can give a definite answer, ma\u2019am.\u201d Erna said. \u201cI will have to check my schedule,\u201dErna\u2019s hands trembled. She clasped them together to try and keep it from showing. She was able to keep her voice firm and calm. Brenda looked at Erna with disappointment, but could do nothing except for now. She was a stubborn old coot and would not conceive the point too readily.Even when Erna saw the Viscountess off, later that evening, she reminded Erna to make the time. Erna felt cold under the woman\u2019s hard gaze. It reminded her of the scornful eyes that constantly looked down at her through the buzz of public rumour.\u201cI know its disrespectful to say, but the Viscountess has no shame.\u201d Said Lisa, as the pair of them watched the Viscountess\u2019 carriage rumble down the driveway. \u201cHow can she suggest forgiveness after what they did to you.\u201d\u201cLisa.\u201d Erna said. She felt embarrassed.\u201cI don\u2019t think I would understand you but I\u2019ll still love you all the same.\u201d Lisa said with bright enthusiasm.Erna looked at Lisa and felt warmed by her shy smile. The day they met Lisa declared she would follow and love Erna for the rest of her life. It tickled Erna\u2019s heart.Now that she was to be Grand Duchess, Lisa thought Erna would forget about all about her, being an insignificant maid and all, but Erna came straight away to pick Lisa up. Troublemaker as she was, Erna liked having her around, she was a golden ray of sunshine on a stormy day.\u201cYou\u2019ve suffered a lot because of me.\u201d Erna said, touching Lisa\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for all the trouble.\u201dEven though she knew it would be indecent, Lisa let herself be taken into Erna\u2019s arms and she could feel the tears welling up. Erna said nothing and just comforted the maid.I\u2019ll follow you, love you and protect you, for the rest of my life.Lisa followed after Erna with rekindled determination. From a neglected hill-billy to a lady\u2019s personal maid and soon, handmaiden to the Grand Duchess. Lisa had quite the responsibility ahead of her.\u201cOh, miss, the prince is not coming to see you.\u201dLisa\u2019s attitude became firm as she recalled Prince Bjorn. He was a strong enemy of the Hardy family. The very same prince who rode in on a white horse to save Lady Hardy. There was a lot of talk about forgetting the past and moving on recently, but the more Lisa thought of it, the more it looked like a poisonous mushroom.They were turning the whole country upside down with their marriage. They very much seemed like a couple in love, but Lisa could see the shyness that surrounded their meetings. Lisa couldn\u2019t understand the Prince\u2019s attitude toward Erna. He never sent flowers or letters. It was not normal, they were not normal lovers. Something is wrong and after much internal debate, Lisa came to the conclusion that something is very, very wrong.\u201cOh, I\u2019ll visit him tomorrow, we are going to be having luncheon at the palace.\u201d Erna replied.She smiled casually, as if not meeting your fiance for two whole weeks was pretty normal.\u201cI will pick out a very nice dress, one that will make the prince fall in love with you.\u201d Lisa promised.The poisonous mushroom prince will fall in love, Lisa decided. Erna was beautiful, but after her work, Lisa will make sure Erna is irresistible.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cYou terrible thing.\u201d Leonard declared.He had fallen onto the table, spilling it and all the drinks upon it to the floor. Bjorn looked at the crazed man through bleary, drunken eyes. Empty bottles rolled around the floor like fallen leaves and the insensible idiots sprawled in-between. It was a colourful display of ugliness.Two bachelor parties so far and enough drink to put the prince\u2019s life at risk. The thought was there, but it did not register to Bjorn, as he looked down at the mouthful of brandy left in his glass. He raised the deer horn trophy above his head, downed the remnants and declared the evening at a successful conclusion.Bjorn managed to escape the club without incident. A few groans here and there, Leonard seemed to have fallen asleep on the floor where he had fallen, Bjorn had seized that opportunity to beat a retreat, Leonard would not have let him leave otherwise.His head was groggy and more than once he had to lean against a wall to stabilise himself. Wallowing around with drunkards did not happen.He realised he was still carrying the deer horn trophy when he went to touch his aching head. It was a reminder of a bitter past, but the lads were so determined to cut the horns of Bjorn Dniester, that they had made a new one and presented it to him last night, at the first bachelor party.Even though it was the second trophy, it still held a deep meaning and held the same feelings as the first. The whole reason he joined this madness was because the lads had ordered a gold trophy for him.\u201cIf you go, you lose. The trophy will be charged to Schuber Palace anyway.\u201d They laughed.Each time one of them got married, a trophy would be made, with their name written on it and the idea was to be the man who got away with it at the end of a very heavy drinking session. It was Bergman who lost the last trophy to Bjorn.Bjorn had almost lost his trophy to Leonard, but the drunk fool fell and the alcohol did the rest, allowing Bjorn to make a clean get away. It had taken two nights, but a victor was clear and Bjorn got to add another trophy to his rather large collection.He had not intended to stay that long. With so many trophies, he did not care to throw one away. He was going to raise a toast, say some polite words and then leave, but once that first drink passed his lips, he lost himself to the madness.In the end, everyone was obsessed with the trophy, as they always are and the party did not finish easily until the morning.Bjorn stumbled out of the club and into the snow laden night. The wind was cold and penetrated to his bones. When he saw the fountain he laughed. He kept laughing all the way to his carriage.When he sat on the frigid fabric seats, he closed his eyes and felt the world spin. He started to think how different things would have been if Erna had not come to the fountain that morning. Where would he be now, would he still be with Gladys? He doubted that.\u201cMiss Hardy is waiting.\u201d Came a voice.He was already back at his mansion? He must have drifted off into a drunken stupor.\u201cErna\u2026why?\u201d Bjorn said to the phantom voice.\u201cOh my god, my Prince, how are you in such a state at this hour?\u201d The voice belonged to Mrs Fitz.She approached him when he got out of the carriage and cried out when she noticed his drunken state. Bjorn staggered with a half hearted smile on his face and Mrs Fitz could do nothing but sigh.\u201cWhere is Erna?\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cWhere she said she would be, did you forget that you had a luncheon with your fiance, my prince?\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s only morning, the sun hasn\u2019t even come up yet.\u201d Bjorn said and looked up into the sky, where the sun lazily drifted over his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe came.Erna thought as she saw Bjorn enter the room.He actually came.She was starting to think he would not show and she felt the depression hit her like the wind, but now that he was here, striding across the room to her, she felt hope rekindle inside her.There was something off about the way he walked though and as the initial shock of seeing Bjorn enter the drawing room, she noticed that the man who normally walked with such grace and purpose, stumbled across to her.He did not have to get too close before she could smell the alcohol that surrounded him like an invisible cloud. She looked up into his drowsy eyes and they swivelled as they struggled to focus on her.\u201cAs you can see, I am in no fit state to have luncheon, at this current hour.\u201d Bjorn fumbled the words out of his mouth. She was surprised he could form a coherent sentence.Hope burned away in Erna\u2019s chest and made room for anger and disappointment. She knew she had to reply to him, but she couldn\u2019t find the right words. A part of her wanted to slap his silly, drunken face, but the royal etiquette training advised that a future queen did not behave in such a manner.She wondered if she could get a servant to do it for her.Bjorn sighed at Erna\u2019s silence. \u201cWill you wait for me?\u201d He said. \u201cHow does dinner sound?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Erna said, trying to make sense of his slurring and noticed he was looking at a clock on the table. \u201cFine\u2026yes.\u201dThe whole situation was ridiculous and disrespectful. Erna did not have to put up with this and knew she should say something, but what would the point be? She doubted Bjorn really knew where he was and what he was doing. Fine, we will have dinner instead, but she doubted he would even remember, or be conscious.\u201cOkay then.\u201d Bjorn moved in closer to Erna and whispered. \u201cMiss Hardy, I will bring you a gift of apples.\u201dBjorn handed something over to Erna, something he had been holding the entire time that Erna only just noticed. When she saw what it was, she recoiled and brought a hand up to her mouth. The golden deer antler trophy, the very thing that started all this mess in the first place.Lisa had explained to her the importance of the deer antler trophy, or rather, the feigned importance these bachelors put on it. It was awarded to the best drinker at the stag party. Which meant the Prince had broken his promise to her and had spent the entire night, at least, getting drunk for this stupid thing.Erna felt like she had been struck with a gong and her head spun. She stared at the trophy the Prince had put into her hands before wondering off to the sofa to lay down. He looked to be going to sleep.\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d Erna demanded.\u201cA wolf horn,\u201d Bjorn said sleepily.Erna felt suffocated.\u201cWolves do not have horns.\u201d\u201cIs that so,\u201d Bjorn lazily opened his eyes and looked at Erna. \u201cI suppose not now, its been cut off.\u201dBjorn whispered a laugh and the drawing room became silent, save for the ticking of the second hand on the clock. It eroded away the silence on top of Bjorn\u2019s heavy, drunken breathing.I should have refused you.\u00a0Erna thought as she let herself fall to the seat opposite Bjorn. She looked at the man she was to marry next week. All these problems and difficulties that she couldn\u2019t understand, all because she was to marry the Prince.The wedding was already done and the participants were fait accompli. Grandmother and Mrs Greve were moved to tears and were relieved the wedding was finally done. Bjorn smiled and looked as if it were a simple Sunday afternoon.He looked down at her with drunken eyes. \u201cYou are awake, I see.\u201dHer husband laughed like it was some great joke, but he remained taciturn as he laughed and offered her a blood red rose. Erna looked at it, confused and noticed the thick, swollen thorns that struck out at her. None pricked Bjorn\u2019s fingers and as Erna reached for it, the thorns reached for her, she knew there wasn\u2019t anyway to take the rose without being pricked. So she refused it.The world spiralled into darkness, Bjorn turned to a twisted visage of anger and fury, her Grandmother looked disappointed and Mrs Greve wept with pain.Erna roused from her sleep. She hadn\u2019t realised she was napping and saw through heavy eye lids that the prince was still asleep on the couch. It stank of alcohol in the room, so she got up and moved to a chair neat the window and sat down once she cracked it open.Erna looked at her drunken Fianc\u00e9 as he slept. He looked like a simple man that had fallen asleep. Not a hung over prince who had given her the most bizarre gift. A wolf horn, that was actually a deer horn, which is won by a bachelor in a drinking contest. Bjorn was not a bachelor and he did not win the drinking game. It was a confusing mess of identity ended in a confusing gift.The first thing Bjorn saw when he opened his eyes was a delicate young woman holding a gold stick like she was the Queen with a sceptre. Recognition was slow, memories hurt and pounded his mind for attention, but when he grasped at them, they fled to the back of his head.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dHe knew that voice. The soft, angelic song of Erna Hardy.\u201cShould we postpone dinner, like luncheon, or will that be delayed too, until it becomes breakfast, only for that to be luncheon once again.\u201d Erna said.Something was wrong, Bjorn realised, he picked up the thorns laden within Erna\u2019s tone. He sat up on the couch, which sent his mind into a panic as it tried to figure out which way was up, or was it down?\u201cWould you mind waiting a little longer.\u201d Bjorn said through a barren, dry throat. \u201cI think I need to do a little preparation before we have dinner.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d Erna snapped.Bjorn rose and looked down at the little kitten with its tail fluffed and claws out. He smiled pleasantly at Erna and strode out of the room. He tried to walk as straight as possible, but his head was still having trouble reorientating itself to the correct alignment of the world and he stumbled a little before he reached the door.About an hour later, Bjorn returned to the drawing room, freshly washed, shaved and dressed. All notions of his drinking had vanished and he was fully alert.\u201cShall we go,\u201d he said.He offered Erna his hand. For a moment he thought Erna was going to refuse. Her face was coy and it was clear that she was still upset, but Erna took his hand delicately and allowed herself to be led out to the garden room. It was mainly used for breakfasting, but Bjorn felt the need for some fresh air.Bjorn drew out a chair for Erna and then went to sit opposite. The table was already laid out for the evening meal, of which there was only a place mat and cutlery in front of Erna. Bjorn winked at the servants and they busied themselves with serving the food.Once the staff had laid out the dinner in front of Erna and a cup of coffee in front of Bjorn, Erna finally spoke.\u201cWhy do you not eat?\u201d Erna asked.\u201cThis is enough for me.\u201d Bjorn said and rubbed his stomach.The sun was setting and saturated the room in a deep, orange light. The wood in the fireplace popped and crackled, filling the room with the sound of burning wood. It was the only sound and seemed to draw attention to the silence between the two dinner guests.Erna hesitated as she went to pick up a fork. It was embarrassing to eat alone, even worse when you\u2019re not alone and being stared at. She was hungry though, having skipped lunch, so she put up with it for the sake of starvation.\u201cIf you have something to say, will you say it already.\u201d Erna said, who felt burdened by the pregnant silence.\u201cWell, not really.\u201d Bjorn said, playing with the coffee cup, he had not taken a sip of it yet.\u201cBut you\u2019re the one that set this up.\u201d Erna said, right before stuffing food in her mouth.\u201cWell, yes, I just thought it would be nice to share a meal together, before the wedding.\u201d\u201cIs that really all?\u201d\u201cWere you expecting another reason?\u201d Bjorn sipped at the coffee, regretting it soon after as his tummy gargled at him.\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0I don\u2019t expect anything from you.\u00a0She wanted to say, but stopped at no.Bjorn seemed to relax a little more and watched Erna eat her dinner. The hunger in Erna was enough that she ignored his staring. Now and then she would dab at the corners of her mouth with a napkin, take a sip of water and grab up the fork again to dig in. Erna might look like a bird pecking at a feeder, but she could eat like a horse, but she was always careful to follow proper etiquette as dictated by the book.By the time the desserts arrived, the mood between Bjorn and Erna softened a little, but each time Erna looked up at Bjorn, who hadn\u2019t taken her eyes of Erna, she would look back down at her food as if in embarrassment.\u201cYou wish to say something, Miss Hardy, would you just say it?\u201d Bjorn said in frustration.Erna put down the small fork. She had been harassing an innocent chocolate cake with it for hours. She looked up at Bjorn and met his eyes.\u201cI want to bring my maid to the palace.\u201d Erna said.\u201cYour maid? You mean the one who could be a guardian for the gates of hell?\u201d Bjorn said with a cocked smile. \u201cOf course, she and what ever servants you wish are welcome.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Erna didn\u2019t rise to Bjorn\u2019s jest. \u201cLisa will be enough for me.\u201dBjorn caught a look in Erna\u2019s eyes and a twitch in the corners of her mouth.\u201cThere is something else?\u201d\u201cThe wedding,\u201d Erna started, paused, fidgeted with the table cloth a little. \u201cI mean, our wedding, its traditional for the bride to be given away by her father.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cI would have liked my Grandmother to walk me down the aisle, she is the one who has earned that right, but if I don\u2019t follow tradition, it could bring harm down on the Lechen Royal Family and to you.\u201d Erna looked at Bjorn in earnest.\u201cSo, what you\u2019re saying is that you don\u2019t want to follow tradition to avoid your father walking you down the virgin road?\u201dErna nodded.\u201cIf memory serves, Viscount Hardy is still alive and well.\u201d Bjorn said thoughtfully.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to be lead into my new life by a man who gave up being my father.\u201d Erna said.\u201cOkay.\u201d Bjorn said.He showed interest in what Erna was saying by twisting the corners of his mouth thoughtfully. Erna\u2019s pale cheeks flushed red as they looked at one another and her will could be seen, clear as day, in her defiant eyes.\u201cIf it\u2019s going to cause disrespect, then I will abide by tradition, but if there is another way,\u201d Erna held her trembling hands under the table so the prince couldn\u2019t see. \u201cThen I would like to hold your hand. Would you please take me?\u201dErna\u2019s blue eyes reflected the candlelight that lit up the garden room. They seemed to dance with the very fires of courage and determination. Bjorn realised that before him sat a rebel with the face of an angel.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Baroness Baden closed the prayer book she had been reading.\u201cCan I sleep here tonight?\u201d Erna said.Baroness Baden knew there was no point in denying Erna, so she simply nodded. She had been pampering Erna like never before. It was her last night after all.When Erna left for her fathers, she thought she could put away the bad feelings she had toward him, but now she just felt incredibly empty and sad. When the carriage left earlier in the afternoon, taking her luggage to the Schuber Palace, that sadness deepened. Starting tomorrow, it would be her new home, for her new life and new family.\u201cIt feels so strange, Grandma.\u201d Erna said, fidgeting with her hands under the blanket.\u201cAre you scared?\u201d\u201cA little bit.\u201d Erna said, cautiously.From the day she received the marriage proposal, up until now, she had been scared and the closer the wedding got, the more the feeling dominated. The fact that she was going to marry the prince made Erna feel quite helpless.\u201cWhy did the prince propose?\u201d Erna said softly.\u201cIsn\u2019t it because he loves you? Contrary to popular opinion, the Grand Duke has an eye for hidden gems.\u201d The Baroness smiled. Erna laughed lightly.After Bjorn had proposed in front of the Baroness, her view of the man changed. She seemed to completely forget the past and all the times she cliticised the prince, dubbing him the problem child of the royal family.Erna wanted to tell her Grandmother that it wasn\u2019t true, the prince didn\u2019t love her, but she knew her Grandmother was lying, just as much as she was. Erna had almost gotten herself embroiled in a scandal which would have ruined her future. Becoming a Grand Duchess brought joy to the Baroness, but within that was the deep sadness of leaving her granddaughter.\u201cMy dear Erna, I was so afraid that you would follow in your mothers footsteps. To be with a man that cheats and lies and does not care for his children. Bjorn was horrifyingly like Walter, it made me sick. It would not have been good for you, to lose your heart to such a man. I rushed all the way here, to save my Granddaughter from such a fate, but I boiled my insides for nothing, the prince is not like the rumours, he is a fine young man.\u201d The Baroness smiled, even as her eyes turned red with tears.Erna knew of the rumours. During her tumultuous time in the city, she had heard all the evil gossip and learned how such rumours could destroy a person. Baroness Baden knew as well, so came to Erna\u2019s side.She knew the rumours about Erna were not true, the Baroness assumed the rumours about the prince could also not be true. She watched Bjorn Dniester over the last few months and came to the conclusion that the rumours were grossly exaggerated. She was wary and knew that her view could be distorted by the desire to find happiness for Erna, but she knew the prince could be afforded a level of trust.\u201cThere is nothing to be afraid of Erna, you will do well.\u201d The Baroness said. \u201cJust be yourself.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Erna said.\u201cOf course.\u201dErna knew her grandmother was not looking at this objectively, but she wanted to leave the mood light, so she smiled and nodded, so that her grandmother would be left with no worry in her heart.\u201cYou will make your mother proud, okay?\u201d Baroness Baden said, giving Erna a kiss on the forehead.\u201cYes, Grandma.\u201d Erna said.Erna closed her eyes and snuggled into Baroness Baden. It did not feel like a night that she would be able to sleep, but she closed her eyes and tried anyway. Her grandmother smelled like flower petals and her skin was soft and warm. She could hear the rhythmic thud of the old woman\u2019s heart. Erna engraved the moment in her mind, she wanted to remember this always.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cYou shameful bastard, do you really think you can treat the father of the Grand Duchess like this?\u201d\u00a0Walter Hardy gritted his teeth and looked down at his bandaged leg. He wanted to get rid of the damn thing, but he made a promise.\u201cHold on a little bit, honey. Its just for one day.\u201d Brenda Hardy said, holding out a set of crutches.Trembling at his humiliation, Walter accepted the crutches meekly.It had been two days ago, in the evening, that Prince Bjorn had come to Walter Hardy, at the Hardy Mansion. Walter felt pride that he was to be the father of the Grand Duchess, but the words the prince spoke boiled his blood.\u201cMiss Hardy will be holding my hand on the walk down the aisle.\u201d Bjorn said.It was an order that left Walter bewildered. He tried to argue tradition and formality, the many virtues that the prince should abide by, but he did not even raise an eyebrow. It was like talking to a wall.\u201cWhat? But your highness, what will the people say? There will be outrage, they will not accept this.\u201d Walter said.Walter was driven into a corner and he protested until he was red in the face. For his daughter to face such humiliation on such a momentous occasion, it was unbelievable and the prince acted so casually about it.\u201cThen we will create a reason.\u201d Bjorn said.He must be drunk, what other reason could there be for this madness. Walter blinked at the prince, as the prince stood there as tall and proud as ever.\u201cWe won\u2019t say that you are in bad health, I don\u2019t think that is a good reason.\u201d Bjorn said flatly. He was looking at Walters leg.\u201cWhat are you suggesting? You really dare go this far?\u201d Walter said.Maybe it was because Walter was worried that Erna had told the prince everything, but no matter who he was, he had no authority to intervene in a fathers discipline of his child. Walter carefully prepared a rebuttal and waited for Bjorn\u2019s response.\u201cYes, so what? She is my wife.\u201d Bjorn said.It took Walter off guard and he felt his fighting spirit bleed away. In the end, he had to acquest the prince\u2019s suggestion.Walter fumed at the ruse and cursed every living thing under the sun.\u00a0 The prince swanned into his home like a perfect gentleman, insulted him and then floated out of the house like nothing was out of place.Walter cursed the prince with every hobbled step he was forced to take. He had to keep reminding himself that he was to be the father of the Grand Duchess and the Hardy family could enjoy the honour of being raised up as part of the Royal Family.The prince was a crazy man, but he wasn\u2019t the only one crazy around here, Walter could be crazy too.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The roads were lined with crowds of people, that all clustered together along the paths to the Schuber Palace. Even though they spoke of the end of the world for the Lechen Royal Family, they cheered for the spectacle of it.\u201cHey, there they come, they\u2019re coming.\u201d They called when the luxurious golden carriage trundled past, pulled by four white horses.The brides procession was led by regal looking Royal Guard, in their formal attire they looked splendid and dignified. It was nothing when compared to when Princess of Lars as the Crowned Princess, but it could never be called inferior, only prepared in haste.\u201cI can\u2019t believe he can catch such a woman.\u201d Some said, as they saw the beautiful princess through the windows of the carriage.\u201cShe may be beautiful, but she is no Princess Gladys. She is a whole different class.\u201d Others said.The clatter of tongues permeated across the precession.\u201cThe Princes second wife does not look all that much.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s so arrogant, just staring off like that, she is very different to Princess Gladys. At least she showed some kindness.\u201d\u201cShe is very haughty, is she not, with her nose up in the air.\u201dBy the time the rumours spread through the streets, the carriage passed along the Arch-Dukes bridge. As the palace drew closer, Erna started to turn ever more pale.From the moment she put on her wedding dress, her mind went blank and she struggled with her nerves. She realised she had been like this from the moment she boarded the train to Schuber. Everything seemed like a dream and she imagined the real Erna Hardy was still asleep some where, probably on that train.That reality seemed a lot more likely than the one she found herself in right now. The one where Erna Hardy becomes a princess.When her carriage stopped outside the Royal Chapel, Erna let go of the tethers of her delusion. She struggled to suppress her rapid breathing as she got down from the carriage. It was lucky that she was led to where she was needed to be, her mind was so fuzzy, she struggled to notice where she was and when she looked down, she was already on the red carpet.Erna stared blankly at the bouquet of flowers that had appeared in her hand, a whisper of a voice in her mind wondered where they had come from, had she been holding them the entire time?She looked up at the closed door in front of her and she could feel the fear rise up in her. She was afraid of this door more than any door she had ever faced. It was about to open and beyond would be Erna\u2019s new life.\u2018I can be happy.\u2019She remembered the promise she had made confidently. Her heart pounded and felt ready to burst. Her legs were trembling so much they barely kept her upright and the flowers of the bouquet shook.\u2018I should turn and run.\u2019The conviction felt so certain in her head, it was the only true course of action, but as she felt the motion a shadow fell over Erna.\u201cErna?\u201dShe looked up at the soft voice and saw him, the prince, Bjorn. He was to be her chaperone into the new life. He felt more like a guard escorting her to her execution.\u201cBreathe.\u201d Bjorn said.Breathe.\u00a0Erna said to herself.\u201cThat\u2019s it, breathe, relax.\u201d Bjorn said.Bjorn seemed jovial at Erna\u2019s outward struggle to mentally contain the situation. He held her hand and she could feel it. She knew he was probably recalling the same memory as she was, their first meeting. The night of the fountain and the trophy.\u201cThank you.\u201d Erna said, her voice trembling. \u201cYou heard my request.\u201dErna gave an awkward smile as she waved a hand. Bjorn laughed lightly as if to confirm what Erna had said.\u201cI will be a good wife.\u201d Erna went on.The moment she made that promise, her voice became firm and the trembling stopped. Bjorn still just smiled at her, even as the door opened, he looked at her and smiled. Even as the sunlight, tainted with reds, greens and blues of the stained glass window at the far end of the chapel, washed over them, Bjorn smiled at her and led her to her new life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe second royal wedding was underway.It was a lot different from the first royal wedding, which was so noisy and busy that the souls of the Prince and Princess, who were so use to the tumultuous and public lifestyle, were drowned out.At the end of the Virgin Road, in front of the Archbishop who was to marry them, Bjorn slowly turned to Erna. He did not let go of her hand. The light from the stained glass window bathed the pair in rose light.Under the gaze of hundreds of onlookers, Bjorn lifted the vail that covered Erna\u2019s face. It was such a small gesture and only the first act in a long line of prescribed ceremony and tradition. It was also a pointless act, to uncover the face of the one he had looked upon so many times before today. It was mainly for the masses.The corners of Bjorn\u2019s lips gently curled into a smile as he looked into Erna\u2019s eyes. The fierce blue was tainted by the red light and looked like flame sparked in the sky. Erna looked like a flower in the wedding dress of layered lace and delicate silks. He wanted to applaud the tailor, who did a splendid job of encapsulating the country girl who liked long dresses.Erna avoided looking directly at Bjorn and even though her cheeks had been brushed red, he could still see the flush of embarrassment in them. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh.She had remained stiff right up until the moment the Archbishop began to speak and then a change came over her. She took on the air of an eager student. Her eyes shone as she concentrated on the Archbishop\u2019s long, projected syllables that resonated a little more enthusiasm than his usual bored droll.Bjorn looked out over the passionate sympathy of the onlookers as the Archbishop addressed Erna. He could tell who were the ones that were knowledgeable in the theory of all the traditions practised in this moment and those who were fully absorbed by the emotion of it.Erna nodded her head delicately and the cold, stern gaze of the Archbishop softened. He then turned to Bjorn and his face became a visage of damnation and hellfire once more. He stared at Bjorn with unnaturally forceful eyes.Those eyes made his words feel more like threats than promises of devotion. Especially when coupled with words like forever, until death, duty and honour.\u201cDo you hear me, your Highness? Do you understand my meaning, your highness? Under pain of burning in hell for all eternity, your highness.\u201d The Archbishop seemed to say.The Bjorn continued to smile in spite of the Archbishops stinging glare and coolly said \u201cYes, I get your meaning.\u201dBjorn thought the Archbishop may resent him a little. He smiled more at his wedding to Gladys and now, four years later, he was marrying another woman. No doubt that disturbed him a little. Bjorn could see that he looked at Erna with pity as he blessed the couple, with a booming voice that was loud enough to be overheard by the bells.Bjorn concluded the ceremony by bowing low and giving Erna a kiss. The crowd did not cheer, but they clapped and the hall of the chapel made it sound like a hundred thunderstorms, coupled with the bells, the noise was incredible. When Bjorn pulled away from the kiss, Erna\u2019s eyes opened and looked brighter than ever, like a pair of shimmering samphires.Erna nodded her head lightly, as if contemplating something and locked Bjorn with a firm gaze. She smiled at him. She no longer shied away.Erna Dniester is so beautiful.\u00a0Bjorn thought, it was a satisfying fact.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cNo.\u201dThroughout the wedding, she had heard the word repeated over and over again. No your grace, no your highness, no your excellency. She was sure that last one was wrong. If the only change was the name, then was there any change really?Erna looked at Mrs Fitz, who stared Erna down with firm, fierce eyes. She had only said that she could take a bath by herself, but was made to feel like a criminal about to be hanged.\u201cHis Royal Highness is the host of Schuber Palace, which means you are the first Princess, the Grand Duchess of Lechen. We have the responsibility to maintain the appropriate dignity, Your Highness.\u201d Mrs Fitz said.It was difficult for Erna to understand, would bathing alone be such a detriment to the dignity of the Grand Duchess?Mrs Fitz was the Princes nanny and had raised him from a baby. She was one of the most trusted servants on the Royal Families staff. Erna knew that she could learn a lot from her. She was quite literally Bjorn\u2019s will in another form. She had taken care of Erna in the months leading up to the wedding and had been responsible for ensuring all the wedding preparations went smoothly.Mrs Fitz was a stern woman and cold when needed to be, but she was also very bright and dignified. She was a nice person, according to Baroness Baden. So what could Erna do? She couldn\u2019t be in better hands, she supposed, so with a silent nod, Erna succumb to Mrs Fitz\u2019s will.In response to the silent order, the maids worked diligently to prepare Erna for her bath. By the time the Grand Duchess was sat in the scented water, she didn\u2019t really have time to feel any shame.Laid in the hot water, the scent of flowers making her mind all fuzzy, she thought back on the day. She had started the day at her Grandmothers side as Erna Hardy. She ended the day, naked, in a bath surrounded by maids, as Erna Dniester. It was a disjointed feeling. Luckily for Erna, Lisa was still by her side and poured hot water over Erna\u2019s shoulders.\u201cIt will be okay Your Highness.\u201d Lisa said. It was still unfamiliar to hear Lisa use that title.Erna lowered her head and touched the petals with her nose. She prayed that the time would pass, to be out of the bath and dressed, in her own room and alone.Finally coming out of the bath and into the Grand Duchess\u2019 chambers that she realised the wind brought ever greater ordeal.Big.\u00a0She thought.\u00a0Everything is too big.The thought, which must have come to Erna a dozen times, only now seemed appropriate. The palace was far too big and Erna was overwhelmed. When Erna moved to Hardy Mansion from Baden Mansion, she was amazed by the grand scale of luxury, but this blew that well out of the water.In Erna\u2019s room alone, there was enough grand luxury that was impossible to measure any value to. In reality, none of it belong to her. Although Mrs Fitz had prepared the room for Erna, technically it all belonged to Bjorn.How shameless of the Grand Duchess, to be married to the prince and have only her body to bring to the union. Erna was well aware of how the people viewed her and the slander they spread. The Baden family were unable to keep a single country house and the Hardy family was so poor they only brought debt to the Royal Family. Bjorn was willing to bare it all.The mansion of the Baden family was secure and firmly belonged to Erna. The Hardy family was able to escape bankruptcy and it was all thanks to Bjorn\u2019s money. The people added up imaginary sums of money and wondered how much of it could be left.While Erna was absently away in her daze, the maids busied around her, getting the Grand Duchess dressed. They dressed her in layers of night gowns and dressing gowns, piled her hair up into a neat bow and drenched her in the scent of flowers.\u201cHave a peaceful night, Your Highness.\u201d Mrs Fitz said.When the doors closed behind the old woman, Erna was left standing in the middle of the room all on her own. It was nearly dark in the room, deep shadows filling the corners where the fireplace and candle light didn\u2019t reach. Slowly, Erna turned around and took everything in.She noticed the flower decorated table and the two drinking glasses placed upon it. She was not so naive that she didn\u2019t know what was to be expected on a couples first night of marriage. She just never truly believed it could happen between her and Bjorn.She sat down on the large bed. It was softer than anything she had come across before and as she sat, the day unfolded in her memory once more. From the carriage ride up to the chapel, the stern gaze of the Archbishop, which quickly turned to pity.After the wedding, they rode together through Schuber in an open top carriage. There were so many people gathered, she wondered if every person in the city had poured out onto the streets.Even just remembering the spectacle of it all made her feel out of breath once more. She had been so frozen in terror she could only look ahead. When she had finally taken it all in, she found she could smile and even went as far as to wave at the people she passed. As Bjorn had told her to do.In her mind, as she waved, she imagined the people were not cheering for her, they were booing and as she sat on the edge of the bed, she felt like such a naive little girl.Bjorn had been reassuring during the parade. She would often forget that she was the Grand Duchess and just simply stare up at him. Taking in the sharp lines and delicate features of his face harmonised to give a very elegant impression. The blend of his slender figure and large, solid frame was the same. His light, golden hair looked bleached in the sunlight, which almost seemed like a cloud had decided to attach itself to his head.He noticed Erna looking at him and she dropped her eyes in embarrassment. She felt like a little child who had been caught doing something naughty. All through the reception, this same scenario kept playing out, she felt like she was not allowed to look at the Prince, her husband.Erna had been staring down at her fingertips, as she sat on the bed and drifted off to sleep. She didn\u2019t realise until she was rudely awaken by nearly falling from her perch. The clock said it was nearly midnight and Bjorn had not yet returned. He must still be celebrating with his friends.So Erna curled up on one side of the bed. Mrs Fitz\u2019s stern admonition came to her head, but she didn\u2019t care, she was too tired. Drowsiness and fatigue turned her mind to mush as she considered the ramifications.Her eyes slowly closed as she rationalised her choice. The sweet scent of flowers and the romantic candlelight wrapped Erna in sleep, which was to be her only companion on the night of her wedding.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Bjorn made it up to the bedroom long after midnight. Once he had gotten ready for bed, the night had gotten deeper.The master suite was enveloped in a dark silence, now that the attendants had withdrawn for the night. Bjorn loosened the overly tight knot of his gown and moved along the passage that connected his bedroom to the Grand Duchess\u2019 room.As he opened the door to Erna\u2019s room, the first thing he noticed was the sweet scent of flowers and soft lighting. It was strangely quiet, no sound of movement, but there was something breathing in there.Bjorn went into the bedroom and scrutinised everything. He stopped when he saw a bundle on the edge of the bed that was Erna. Even when he approached and his shadow fell over the bundle, Erna did not stir. She was really asleep. He giggled to himself.\u201cErna?\u201d He said softly, but she still didn\u2019t move.When Bjorn brushed her cheek gently, she finally stirred and turned over. \u201cY-Your Highness!!!\u201d She screamed when her eyes fully opened and saw the looming shadow leaning over her.Bjorn cupped her mouth to stifle the noise and drew her gaze back to him.\u201cHello, my wife.\u201d He said softly, reassuringly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was weary, but the greeting was still polite, Bjorn laughed.\u201cAre you tired?\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cWhat? Oh, I\u2019m sorry, I did not mean to fall asleep.\u201dBjorn did not mean to criticise her, but Erna made the apology with tears starting to show. Bjorn sat on the bed and placed a hand on Erna to hold her back as she moved to sit up. His new bride blinked at him.Bjorn looked down at where his hand was placed on Erna\u2019s night gown and begun to undo the buttons. He noticed the adornment of lace and frills, they seemed out of control and had Mrs Fritz meddling written all over them. Though the gown was to Erna\u2019s taste, it seems the old nanny can\u2019t help but interfere.\u201cIt\u2019s a very pretty nightgown.\u201d Bjorn said softly.Erna blushed at receiving the complement and at the gentle nature in which Bjorn parted the nightie.\u201cThank you.\u201d Erna mumbled under her breath.She looked so serious and her hoarse whisper was absurd, Bjorn couldn\u2019t help but laugh heartily. This made Erna shrink away a little from him and she curled up into her nightgown. Only her dainty little feet poked out of the bottom of them and she looked like a little child\u2019s doll, swamped in rich lace.\u201cErna,\u201d Bjorn said after he had finished laughing.Erna looked up at him, dazed and flushed. She still couldn\u2019t believe it was her name, it felt so unfamiliar.\u201cYes, Your Highness?\u201d Erna\u2019s voice trembled. She had not moved from her curled up position on the bed, but she was panting, her fingers kept curling.\u201cCall me by my name.\u201d Bjorn said. He reached up and released a ribbon that was tied in her hair. He brushed a large hand through it, helping it cascade down the front of her gown.\u201cI think calling me Your Highness in a situation like this,\u2026is a bit\u2026\u201d He held the end of the other ribbon. \u201cSay my name.\u201dHe pulled at the ribbon. Erna reflexively shook her head and grabbed at her hair.\u201cHurry up,\u201d Bjorn urged.He seemed unaware of Erna\u2019s resistance and urged her on. In the meantime, their fingers argued over the ribbon, but Bjorn finally came away with it.\u201cDo your best, Erna.\u201d He said firmly.With the ribbon intertwined in his fingers, he grabbed Erna\u2019s wrist and opened up her legs with his free hand. Erna gasped. He was not forceful, but Erna did not give any resistance either, she didn\u2019t really have the time.\u201cDidn\u2019t you promise me that you would be a good wife?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cThat was a lie?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Through all the fug of confusion and mix of sensations, Erna came through firmly. \u201cI did not lie about that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief, I don\u2019t like being deceived.\u201d Bjorn grinned and let Erna go.Erna felt like covering her body, but her small hands couldn\u2019t do a good enough job. She looked up at Bjorn, who\u2019s smile never reached his eyes. He was difficult to read. She fidgeted with the sheets, twisting them and her mind raced.She had made a promise and she intends to keep it, but she did not think about these duties she would have to perform. It was obvious to her what her responsibilities as a wife entailed, but now that she was here, she hesitated.Erna became madly aware of her shallow breathing, that would become rapid and erratic, and then silent as she fought to control herself. Bjorn was reaching up to undo the rest of her nightgown, more relaxed this time, gentle.As he gently pulled off each layer, Erna realised that the ritual undressing was not so bad. She felt pleasure warm her mind as each layer brought freedom from the stuffy clothes.\u00a0 Bjorn would have said it was fun, like unwrapping a lovingly crafted gift box. The slow process of revealing a woman\u2019s body was tantalising.\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Erna said, as Bjorn made to undo the first button of the last layer of pyjamas. She reached up with both hands and put them on his.\u201cMy name.\u201dBjorn took her hands and placed them on the bed. Erna did not resist.Her lips trembled as she tried to whisper his name. \u201cBjorn\u2026\u201d she finally said and to Bjorn, it was barely audible. He gave a nod.\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026I want to take it off for you,\u201d Erna said.She made to get up, but Bjorn still had hold of her hands. \u201cNo, you\u2019re tired, you should rest, let me do all the work.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI have to do my best to be a good husband too.\u201dCalmly Bjorn continued undoing the front of her pyjamas. One by one, the buttons came undone and little by little, Erna\u2019s body was revealed, until the last button was removed and Bjorn let the pyjamas slip from the shoulder.Erna looked away in unbearable shame and squeezed her eyes shut. Her cheeks blushed a bright red they practically glowed. Bjorn smiled.\u201cYou are so beautiful, Erna.\u201d He said softly.Erna gasped at Bjorn\u2019s words and looked at him with such wide eyes that all her whites were showing. She knew no response was polite enough and her will to persevere vanished. She tried to stand up, but Bjorn was already moving on the bed and easing her back.Erna closed her eyes and tried to scream as she felt the weight of Bjorn on top of her. The sound died on the end of her lips as she realised he was kissing her. The closeness of him, she could smell his sweat and it mixed with the smell of his breath. The feeling of his soft lips and a reaching tongue left Erna\u2019s mind blank, as she did her best to massage his lips with hers and meet his tongue half way.She tried to say his name, but their kissing turned it into a soft moan, he returned her moan with his own.When she finally came to her senses and opened her eyes, Erna found herself sprawled out in the middle of the bed, but instead of staring up at the ceiling, she was looking up at Bjorn\u2019s face. It seemed a little out of focus as her heat rose.A cold hand reaching down the front of her snapped her back to reality sharply and she watched as Bjorn craned his head to wrap his soft lips around her breast. It was such a sharp contrast between hot and cold, Erna gasped. Her hands came up and covered her face.As he sucked at her breast and stroked her tummy, she moaned helplessly and her head rocked side to side. The neatly brushed and tied hair that was supposed to make her look pretty, was not a tangled mess.The room became filled with the noise of hot breathing, thin moaning and skin gently rubbing on skin. Bjorn sucked and slurped at Erna, trying to entice her and the stillness eroded away.Bjorn\u2019s hands quested onward from stroking Erna\u2019s belly, moving along her small waist and between her legs. Erna\u2019s eyes opened wide as she felt his fingers move.\u201cB-Bjorn.\u201d She said breathily.She did not yet have the courage to call his name out as loud as she would have liked. She could still feel a part of herself holding back. Bjorn came up from her aching bust and looked at her.Erna took the opportunity to push him away. She was sobbing, she couldn\u2019t help it. Bjorn frowned worriedly and stopped the hand that hand been pushing a finger against Erna. Driven by fear that he had hurt her, he withdrew and helped Erna sit up.Under his gaze, as he loomed over her, Erna let out the tears she had been holding back.It was painful\u2026and from that pain,she was scared\u2026.It made her sad and she felt pitiful in Bjorn\u2019s shadow. She covered her face with her hands and the tears grew more intense.Bjorn looked at his weeping wife, like a spectator at a play. It was a pretty emotional situation, but at the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but admire her petite form and firm bust. His eyes followed the lines of her curves and delicate waist, her slender limbs and puffy nipples. Even though she was a petite woman, she never seemed immature.Erna had exceeded his expectations.The sobbing eventually subsided and Erna looked up at Bjorn, as if she was clinging to him with just a look.\u201cBjorn.\u201d She whispered between sobs.Her face was blank and emotionless as she spoke his name and with each utterance, her voice became firmer, stronger, louder. Erna didn\u2019t know what else to say, so she said his name.Bjorn sighed and brushed a hand through his hair. He could smell her and it only added to his irritation at the situation. He was bewildered by this woman, who was wet and moaning one moment, then suddenly wailing and crying the next.He felt arrogant. He thought he had trained himself well, beating all kinds of drunkards, earning numerous trophies. It surprised him then, that Erna could deliver this much embarrassment to him and without being drunk.Bjorn looked at Erna with narrowed eyes. In bed, it\u2019s supposed to be fun and he never needed to deal with whiny, clumsy women if he didn\u2019t want to. If he didn\u2019t want to have to deal with the trouble, he could leave and not feel ashamed.That thought had gone through his mind and he was about to, but Erna is his wife. This is no floozy picked up at the club. This was his wife.In that regard, Bjorn had to face this new challenge, whether he liked it or not. Erna was his as much as he was hers and he needed to make an effort. They had promised each other.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Erna said, finally looking up from her hands.Bjorn couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the sense of Deja Vu. Come to think of it, this was not actually the first time this had happened. There was a predecessor\u2026..Gladys.Is Erna another Glady s?Bjorn laughed at the foul feeling of crawling through mud again. The touch of Erna\u2019s hand on his shoulder brought him back from dark thoughts of bad times.\u201cI\u2026I\u2019ll keep my promise. I\u2019m not lying. I\u2019ll keep it.\u201d Erna said, haltingly.Bjorn couldn\u2019t shake the thought of how both Gladys and Erna behaved like they were being raped. It was terrifying to think that it what he was doing. The situation might have been the same, but the words uttered by the two women was completely different.\u201cBut, I\u2019m scared. It\u2019s strange, it\u2019s weird \u2026\u201d Erna\u2019s eyes wandered around the room before finally stopping on Bjorn\u2019s. \u201cI will keep my promise.\u201dPromise\u2026Her promise.The way in which Erna said it was confused and it confused Bjorn. It sounded like he was an usher come to collect her debt. When Earn had owed money for the lost trophy, she behaved like this. Maybe she still feels like she owes him, maybe, if he hadn\u2019t used the boating as an excuse to write off her debts. If she was still working to make artificial flowers.At that moment, Bjorn recalled the face of the woman who had offered him a flower as a token of promise\u00a0and let out a deep sigh of desperation.\u00a0Erna took it as a reprimand and took her hand from his shoulder. Half turning away, she began to wipe the tears from her cheek.Bjorn felt irritation rise up again, but it did not undermine the pity he also felt. He decided to not judge the extent of Erna\u2019s ignorance. He took it on point that she did not know anything.It surprised Bjorn that Brenda Hardy,\u00a0 Erna\u2019s stepmother, would have tried to send her daughter off to be married in this state. It also did not help that Erna lived with her Grandmother before she came to the city, the Baroness is a very conservative woman. Erna really did not know anything about love making.Bjorn had assumed that Pavel might have taught her a thing or two when they ran together. It was hard to believe that they had not even spoken about sex. Was the painter a eunuch or something?Bjorn looked at his wife, the woman who was rumoured to be a concubine, was in fact as untouched as freshly fallen snow. She was a blank slate. Bjorn let out a deep sigh, even in the midst of this annoyance, there was only one thing he could do.Erna looked at Bjorn in wide eyed shock as the Prince began to laugh.When he subsided the laughter, Bjorn went over to collect the drink and two glasses from the table. Erna reached down and grabbed whatever gown was to hand and covered her slender, naked body. They both sat on the bed together.\u201cHow much can you drink?\u201d Bjorn asked.\u201cI, don\u2019t know.\u201d Erna replied as she watched Bjorn pour out two drinks.\u201cHow much do you usually drink?\u201d\u201cOne.\u201d Erna said quietly.\u201cA single drink?\u201d He held the glass out to her.\u201cYes, after one drink I get all hot and, ermm\u2026. fuzzy.\u201d Erna said quickly, as if to avoid looking like an ignorant fool.Bjorn nodded. Erna\u2019s face was still wet with the tears she hadn\u2019t properly wiped away, but her expression was once again firm and strong, and her eyes were bright and assertive.\u201cHere, drink.\u201d Bjorn said and offered the glass again. Erna took it. \u201cDrink and bear it, Erna.\u201d His command was smooth and cooler than the touch of the glass in her hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She thought if she was drunk, it would make the night pass a little easier. With a clear head, it had not gone well so far. She sipped, then sipped again and kept sipping little bits until the glass was empty.The alcohol was a lot stronger than she expected, but it was fruity enough that it was easy to drink. The trembling in her fingers stopped.Erna knew the marriage hadn\u2019t been an act of love, but an act of necessity and she wondered if Bjorn was doing this out of pity, or a sense of responsibility as her husband. She wondered if he was just being chivalric to a woman in trouble, but that didn\u2019t feel right either.As far as logic dictated, Bjorn had proposed and she had accepted for no reason. She wondered if that was the best way. She could concentrate on being the best wife she, he had promised to be the best husband he could and in that way, they could both be happy. Together.As the heat of the alcohol raised to her cheeks, she raised the glass to Bjorn, who was sat motionless on the bed beside her. She looked between the fate she would have loved and the empty wine glass, Bjorn raised a hand to take the glass and their hands touched. Erna sighed, Bjorn bore a determined expression as he took the glass and placed it on the bedside table.\u201cThanks you.\u201d Erna said.She was so careful at braking the silence. Her own voice sounded foreign and distant. She didn\u2019t know what else to say, nothing came to mind in that moment, so she let her voice trail away into memory.Bjorn laughed and lay out on the bed close to her. Although she flinched, she did not try to run away this time. Bjorn leaned in and kissed her soft, moist lips. He was softer, more gentle, more delicate with the fresh rose in his hands.Erna leaned into it and felt more docile thanks to the drunkenness. As they kissed, Erna could feel something rise up from her toes to her tummy, a sort of excitement. She didn\u2019t even mind as Bjorn undid her gown and slipped it over her shoulders once more, exposing her bosom. She calmly accepted his touch.\u201cErna,\u201d Bjorn said, joviality underlined his soft tone.She opened her eyes to look at him and realised she was now laying on the bed, where she had been sitting.\u201cIs this, how its supposed to be? I feel, tingly.\u201d Erna said, embarrassed.\u201cYes.\u201dBjorn moved his hand up from kneading her breast to cup around her neck and cheek. He thought this would be enough, so long as she didn\u2019t start sniffing again and grating his nerves, but this wasn\u2019t fun, having her laid here, unmoving, like a corpse.Bjorn sat up and begun unfastening his own clothes. Erna looked away, as if seeing something she shouldn\u2019t.\u201cYou should look at me.\u201d Bjorn whispered. \u201cIf not, then I will feel dirty, or wonder if you\u2019re thinking of another man.\u201d\u201cNo, its not like that.\u201d Erna said, shock all over her face.While he was able to look at her so casually, she was seized with an uncontrollable feeling. He pulled her in close and she could feel the warmth of his chest against hers.\u201cSeriously, you say such unbearably insulting things.\u201d Erna said, looking up into Bjorn\u2019s eyes. Her eyes were sharp, as if guarding against the loss of her innocence.Bjorn kissed her, practically swallowing her lips as she was about to say something more. They fell back on the bed and Erna could feel the weight of Bjorn on top of her again. It was a shock, but not one she shied away from this time.Bjorn spread Erna\u2019s legs, which had risen up without being beckoned and he moistened her inner flesh. She could feel him moving about in delicate motions and goosebumps prickled across her skin. The tickle was so intense that she wriggled beside Bjorn. Her hand fell to her side and she could feel Bjorn\u2019s risen form. She knew he had been erect for most of the evening, but this was her first time touching it properly.Bjorn\u2019s breathing became shallow and rapid. It matched her own breathing. She was finally relaxing into the dizziness his touch affected upon her and it intensified as he explored. In return, she felt the entire length of him through his breeches. She tried to consider it, to understand it, but his movements on her sent her head into a fog and she barely realised he was there.By the time Bjorn got up and sat between Erna\u2019s legs, their breathing had become excited and Erna felt like she had ran across the front lawn. She found herself not wanting him to stop.Erna looked down at her husband and she felt a heat rise up to her cheeks once more. It was like embarrassment, but not fully so. She took in his square shoulders and large frame. His muscles were delicate shows of strength and power. It made her excited and anxious. She wanted to see more of him, if not all of him.Like a child at Christmas, wondering at the presents wrapped under the tree, Erna studied her husbands body with the same enthusiasm. It wasn\u2019t until her eyes ventured down to his waist did reality snap back into focus.\u201cOh,\u201d Erna sighed involuntarily.Even though she had seen one before, she stared wide eyed. She couldn\u2019t believe what she was actually looking at. She looked away, as if staring would insult Bjorn and she studied the walls and ceiling just beyond the darkness of the room.As if suffering from poor memory, Erna looked back at the shape of her husband thinking there was some detail she missed, or reaffirms the distortion of proportions in her mind.Everything was the same.\u201cB-Bjorn, I don\u2019t think\u2026, I-I mean, it\u2019s too big, it wont fit.\u201dShe could feel tears coming to her eyes and blur the bottom of her vision. She fought them back. It was a serious concern and Bjorn simply laughed.\u201cThank you,\u201d Bjorn said and pulled Erna gently towards him, wrapping her legs around his waist. They were thinner than his arms. \u201cThat\u2019s a very touching compliment.\u201d He said, imitating Erna\u2019s petiteness.Bjorn grabbed a hold of Erna\u2019s round waist with his firm hands, she began to struggle as she felt the unfamiliar touch of Bjorn against her tiny form. Erna\u2019s eyes went wide as Bjorn pushed against her with force, Erna could feel him forcing into the area she had never touched herself and she struggled against the overpressure and the pain.\u201cBe still, Erna.\u201d Bjorn pleaded.Erna tried to command him to stop, let her breath for a second, but it came out as a whimpering moan. Bjorn could feel that Erna was wet enough, but she was too narrow. It didn\u2019t help that she was frightened and rigid of the pain.\u201cB-Bjorn, it\u2019s not going to fit.\u201d Erna said, tears flowed again because of the pain.Bjorn ignored her and prepared to thrust again. He had barely gotten himself halfway in, but Erna had not way of knowing that and she thrashed about from the pain. She could feel him all the way inside her now and it felt like she was getting split in two.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Bjorn tried to reassure Erna. \u201cYou\u2019re fine now.\u201dHe leaned forward and gave her a gentle kiss on her cheeks and then her lips, deepening their bond. Sweat covered Erna\u2019s body as much as it dripped off Bjorn.He looked into her watery eyes, their perfect blue hue tainted by a red puffiness caused by her crying. He lied when he said she would be okay, but it had the desired affect. She seemed to relax and she could feel the tension in her groin lessen.Bjorn didn\u2019t hesitate, he seized the moment and thrust himself deep inside Erna. The shock made her eyes go wide and moments later, she screamed.\u201cStop, now, Bjorn, get off.\u201d She shouted.Bjorn withdrew as if he was going to back away and give Erna chance to breath, but as was almost out, he thrust his hips forward again. Erna struggled and moaned, Bjorn grunted as he thrust once more. His patience had worn out.\u201cIt-It hurts, please stop!!\u201d Erna sobbed.Bjorn didn\u2019t care any more and started thrusting faster and although the ache of it made Erna sob, the pain was no longer so bad that she could not feel the thrill of sex. She was a woman now and she seemed to suck in Bjorn as if she\u2019d been doing it her whole life.Blooms of blood formed like petals on the nightgown under her waist and smeared across their crotches. It was a scary amount of blood, Erna recalled thinking, but at that moment the pain was gone and all that was left was the pressure in her tummy from Bjorn thrusting into her and the overpowering pleasure.When Bjorn first opened the bedroom door, he told himself that he was doing his duty to his wife, but now that he was deep inside her, he felt entirely selfish as he sucked up every ounce of pleasure he could from taking his wife\u2019s virginity.It was sending him crazy.He looked down at his wife and saw that she was finally accepting of him. She looked so pretty, with her eyes closed and face sighing with pleasure. As he moved, Erna wriggled under him and clutched at his shoulders. Her nails would did into his skin, sending pulses of pain that exacerbated the pleasure.Bjorn buried his face into Erna\u2019s neck and started moving wildly. The sound of his heavy breathing caught in Erna\u2019s ear and she thought of some crazed beast. Her body shook violently and it became difficult for her to keep hold of reality.Erna didn\u2019t know what to do, the sensation was reaching unbearable levels and she didn\u2019t know what to do with it. Tears came again, she tried to hold them back, but the weight pushing against her waist felt like she was being crushed and she could barely catch a breath.The sound of their wet skin slapping against each other made Erna suddenly very self conscious. It was a disgraceful sound and she could feel herself slip away from the situation, but only to be met by the intense feeling building in her groin.Bjorn no longer minded the crying. He sat up and looked down at his wife. Her face was a puffy red mess of tears and sweat, but she still looked so beautiful. She breathed deeply in the momentary reprieve, making her chest heave and her bust stand up as two puffy mounds of soft flesh.Bjorn lifted her waist up to him. She muffled a cry into a fist and smiled drunkenly. It wasn\u2019t just Erna\u2019s skin that was soft and warm, but being inside her was also a soft, warm and wet mess of velvety pleasure.Holding her steady, Bjorn pumped into the deepest parts of her, which sent fresh pain wracking through her tiny body and she screamed out. With one last thrust, Erna felt Bjorn grow even bigger inside her and a warmth spread up through her tummy. Her body trembled and goosebumps prickled every inch of skin.Bjorn collapsed beside his wife and the room fell into silence. Their heavy breathing was the only thing that could be heard over the sound of the crackling fire.He stayed inside Erna for a while, wanting to hold onto the sensation of her soft, velvety inside.\u201cA-Are you done now?\u201d Erna asked\u201cYes,\u201d Bjorn said lazily.With great effort, he moved his head to be next to Erna\u2019s and while laid on the pillow, stretched out his lips to kiss her cheek. He missed and kissed the side of her nose instead.It was a sweet lie.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cYour Highness, are you awake?\u201d Came the soft, high pitched voice of Mrs FitzErna thought she was in a dream still, as the voice roused her from unconsciousness, to call it sleep felt like an understatement. Fear crept across her face as she woke in an unfamiliar room and naked.\u201cYes,\u201d Erna said quickly and sat up, pulling bedsheets over herself. Doing so sent a shock of pain up her and she was reminded of last night. \u201cI\u2019m awake.\u201dAs she pulled the bedsheets up, she saw the large blood stain that no longer looked like a flowering rose, but like someone was murdered in her bed.\u201cOkay, I\u2019m coming in.\u201d Mrs Fitz said.\u201cNo!\u201d Erna called out.She scrambled off the bed and tried to walk on shaky legs. They buckled under her and she collapsed to the floor.\u201cAre you okay, your highness, what happened?\u201d\u201cIts nothing, I\u2019m fine.\u201dErna forced herself to her feet and gathered up the bloody sheets. She looked around for some where to hide them and she saw on the clock that it was already noon.\u201cWere you still asleep?\u201dWhile Erna struggled to think of what to do, Mrs Fitz continued to knock on the door and pass words of concern through the thick wooden door.\u201cI\u2019m coming in, your highness.\u201dErna panicked and remembered the bathroom. She bolted for it with bedsheets in tow and slammed the door closed, just as the bedroom door opened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She eventually regained her composure. A messy bed, Pyjamas all over the floor, wine glasses with dregs left in them and a disappearing Grand Duchess. Mrs Fitz saw the hem of the bed covers stuck in the bathroom door.\u201cEvery go back and wait.\u201d Mrs Fitz said to the maids snooping around the bedroom door. \u201cHurry, go on, get away.\u201dEven though Mrs Fritz did not use stern words to shoo the maids away, the dispersed in good order. Even Lisa, who couldn\u2019t help but feel like she should linger, had to turn away back down the hall.After confirming no one was sneaking about, Mrs Fitz closed the bedroom door and approached the bathroom.\u201cYour Highness, we are alone now, you can come out.\u201dThere was a short pause.\u201c\u2026Yes, I\u2019m sorry Mrs Fitz.\u201d A thin, trembling voice came from the other side of the door.\u201cThat\u2019s fine, how are you feeling?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay, its just\u2026\u201dErna was speechless, but Mrs Fitz was patient and waited for Erna to come out in her own time. She busied herself cleaning up the mess of the bedroom.For Bjorn, he woke up in the morning and went about his ablutions as if nothing had happened. He washed, dressed and had breakfast, all without once mentioning his wife. It was as if he\u2019d completely forgot she existed.Mrs Fitz had a bad feeling, an ominous feeling. She didn\u2019t dare guess what was going on between the couple, but she knew that this was not a normal scene for a new bride. The same was true of the groom, who only seemed faithful to his usual way of life on his first day of being married.\u201cIf you are uncomfortable bathing, I will tell the maid not to come.\u201d Mrs Fitz called out toward the bathroom. \u201cBut I am going to need that sheet.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that Mrs Fitz couldn\u2019t guess what the pair had been up to in the middle of the night., but it was polite not to mention it directly, either way, the sheet would have to be thrown out, it couldn\u2019t be left as it was.The door slowly opened and Mrs Fritz backed up a little, allowing Erna all the space she needed. There was a moments silence and Mrs Fritz swallowed when she finally saw Erna on the threshold.The Grand Duchess sloppily covered her naked form with the bed sheet, stood there staring at the ground by her feet. She looked so haggard that it was hard to believe she was nobility. Blood shot and puffy eyes, tousled hair and red marks about her neck and chest.\u201cThank you, your highness.\u201d Mrs Fitz said and reached to take the bedsheet.She backed away the moment she had it and did not look directly at Erna.\u00a0Prince, if only, I would\u00a0The angry thought sent heat through the old nanny. If Bjorn stood in front of her right now, she would have given him more than an ear full.If Bjorn had married this woman out of love, then why was he not here? If he did love Erna, he would have stayed by her side, been with her all night and not up until his own ends were satisfied.With a sigh, Mrs Fitz took the laundry away. The bed sheet was carefully wrapped so that no traces of blood could be seen. What a morning for the first day of being Grand Duchess. She was more than worried for her future.\u201cThank you, Mrs Fitz.\u201d Erna repeated an unknown number of times.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Mrs Fits replied. \u201cThis is a drug that will help calm your nerves, eat and get some rest.\u201dAt first, it seemed like Mrs Fitz was being stern, like a school matron, but her expression was soft and warming.\u201cBut you were to give me a tour of the mansion.\u201d Erna protested.\u201cIts fine, we can postpone for one day. The Prince has requested that.\u201d Mrs Fitz lied.Erna was lost in thought for a moment. She really wasn\u2019t up for walking around the grand palace any way, not with her body aching the way it did. She appreciated Bjorn\u2019s concern and took the medicine bottle obediently.Erna laid back down in the bed and Mrs Fitz, satisfied, left, leaving Erna alone in the bedroom. It was kind of cosy, with the curtains drawn and the fireplace glow.Erna started at the fire blankly and absently pulled at the feathers of the duvet. She felt very lonely all of a sudden. She had spent the first days of her marriage, alone, on her bed, with her body aching still.Her Grandmother had been so excited to hear that Erna was going to be the Grand Duchess of the entire kingdom, if she could see Erna now, would she have been disappointed?\u201cGrandmother.\u201d Erna whispered to the fire, her heart ached for her Grandmother.It had been at the reception that Erna learned the Baroness had returned to Buford. Erna was in-bittered when she learned her Grandmother left without saying goodbye, but she knew that everyone in this high society has their place and her Grandmother\u2019s was in Buford.Erna\u2019s thoughts made her restless and she tossed and turned in the bed, before staring up at the ceiling with a pensive look on her face. None of this felt right. The name Dniester, this palace, Bjorn, none of it felt like hers.Her mind drifted to the other night and the energy of the medicine spread fast. Her tired body stiffened and she couldn\u2019t believe that just thinking about that night got her heat rising and made her breathless.Erna got up and checked the door of the bedroom was closed several times. She then scrambled back under the sheets, and pulled them up and over her head. She became distinctly aware of the pain that was still there. It was more of a dull ache now.She remembered laying out on the bed in the early morning of that night, before the sun\u2019s first light came over the horizon. She was curled up on the bed, willing the pain away so that she could sleep. She was vaguely aware of movement beside her and she turned just in time to see firelight reflect off of Bjorn\u2019s back. He didn\u2019t look back at her once, as he left, she remembered that much.Erna hoped he would be coming back soon, she wanted him to come back, but he never did. Erna buried her face into her pillows and fell asleep crying.Bjorn was friendly and he was heartless. He was as warm as he was cold. It was strange to see such disparity in one man. How could opposite aspects exist at once, there must be some falsity to Bjorn, but Erna could not detect any fabrication or lie.The more she looked at Bjorn, the more she realised she didn\u2019t know and because of her cluttered mind, nightmares and bad dreams followed. She dreamed of being eaten alive by a wolf.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The Grand Dukes carriage returned to Schuber Palace just as the sun settled in the west. Despite his busy schedule, Bjorn did not look tired, he was the same as usual. He exchanged brief glances with the servants as they came out to meet him. Mrs Fitz fell in behind him as he strode toward the entrance hall.\u201cHer Highness is asleep, she seems unwell, so I told her to rest.\u201d Mrs Fitz said.\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cYou have been busy with getting married, maybe a few days rest for you, is in order?\u201dBjorn sensed a thorn in the question.\u201cI\u2019ll enjoy some rest on my honeymoon.\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cThat\u2019s over two weeks away, my Prince.\u201d Mrs Fitz frowned.\u201cHas the Grand Duchess already swayed you to her side?\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way you don\u2019t know the honeymoon isn\u2019t just a honeymoon.\u201d Bjorn said, pausing on the landing and turning to face Mrs Fitz. He smiled, but it did not go as far as his eyes.The honeymoon was just a formality, in reality, it was an overseas diplomatic mission. It was important to reaffirm alliances and to check the intricate web of political power was intact. Especially after such a major event as raising up a new Grand Duchess. It had been Bjorn\u2019s job since the laying down of the crown.A visit by the king, or crown prince, is a major political act, but a prince who disbanded from the throne would not cause as big a fuss. Couple that with the ruse of going on a honeymoon, Bjorn was able to affectively spy on other countries with ease, as well as scout out financial markets.\u201cSo why do you say such things? There must be a reason, have you so quickly abandoned me?\u201d Bjorn said with a sly smile.\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d\u201cTo abandon me in just one day, you don\u2019t even look sad about it.\u201d Bjorn\u2019s intentions were made clear as he over emphasised his wounded pride.\u201cYour childish jokes is what pushed me to her, it was not a difficult choice, my prince.\u201d Mrs Fitz said. Even after all these years, she could not get used to his flirtatious jokes, so far. Sensing the clearly drawn line, Mrs Fitz stepped back.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like that.\u201d Bjorn said smiling.He climbed up the stairs like he was that child again and Mrs Fitz followed, preparing the words for her report.\u201cAh, Mrs Fitz,\u201d Bjorn said.She found him sat cross legged in the chair by the window, opening the letter he had just received.\u201cLike you said, there are fifteen days until the boat trip, plenty of time to teach my wife.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cSince there wasn\u2019t an adult in Erna\u2019s life that could have taught her the bedroom chores, we need someone else to do it now.\u201dMrs Fitz was stunned at the calm and monotonous manner in which Bjorn had given the command. She obeyed with her own calm demeanour.\u201cI will send for the right person for the job, Your Highness, erm, if I may?\u201d\u201cPlease, speak.\u201d\u201cWhy her, Your Highness? What was the reason for wanting this young girl as your wife?\u201d She knew she was being presumptuous to ask such a question, but her curiosity was out of control.\u201cErna\u2026\u201d Bjorn started to say, then stopped and stared up at the ceiling, as if pondering the great mysteries of the world. \u201cBecause she\u2019s pretty.\u201d\u201cYour Highness?\u201d Mrs Fitz said, breathless.\u201cShe\u2019s a very pretty woman.\u201d Bjorn turned to the window and opened the letter. \u201cIsn\u2019t she?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The gold wolf crest of the Archduke glistened at the top of the page. She kept making mistakes because of the pressure she put herself under to write this letter properly.She took a breath, straightened her quill and began scratching the ink onto the fresh but of paper.To Pavel.\u00a0The letter started. The neat handwriting pressed into the paper was satisfactory and Erna wrote line by line.Mrs Fitz had told her that it was customary for the bride to write a letter of thanks to all those who had attended the wedding and after so many, addressed to people she never knew, her wrist throbbed. But thanks to Mrs Fitz, they had all been written out without a single mistake.Only after fulfilling her duties as the Grand Duchess, was she able to write letters to her family, to her Grandmother and the people of House Baden, and Pavel.Erna was loathed to write anything to the Hardy family. Mrs Fitz was insistent that she should write a letter anyway, but Erna refused to bend her will on this matter, even after Mrs Fitz gave her harsh admonishment.Once the letter was finished, Lisa moved in with the hot wax and dribbled a few drops on the fold of the envelope. Erna than pressed the stamp firmly on the quickly cooling wax and left a rather bold looking wax seal, with the wolfs head embossed within.Lisa clapped her hands together. \u201cYou really do look like a Grand Duchess.\u201d She said as she picked up the letter and examined it.Erna gave a shy smile and flushed a little from embarrassment, it as only one stamp. She tidied up the writing desk, not leaving a single piece out of place. Putting the quills back in their stand and closing up the inkwells, putting them in their little alcove. It was her writing desk, but it didn\u2019t feel like it yet.Everything that had been given to Erna, she felt like she was only borrowing and took the greatest care that everything was kept neat and tidy, for when she came to return the borrowed items. Bemuse of this she was very cautious about how she handled things.\u201cIsn\u2019t this the gentleman you were supposed to meet?\u201d Lisa said as she checked the name and address of the letter.\u201cYes, Pavel Lore.\u201d Erna\u2019s answer was so unreserved, it caught Lisa off guard.Lisa\u2019s eyes narrowed as she prepared the letter. Pavel Lore, the respectable Royal Academy of Art painter. If only he bore a title of some sort so that he could associate with his childhood friend. Even though their relationship was a long one and plain, it was a little too plain.Lisa wanted to advise against writing Pavel a letter, but then again, she didn\u2019t want to mess with Erna by interfering, maybe she only wrote to thank the young lad, as she had done to everyone.\u201cOh, I nearly forgot, the goods have arrived.\u201d Lisa said, remembering why she came to her Mistress\u2019 study in the first place.\u201cThe goods?\u201d Erna questioned.\u201cYes, the things to bring to your honeymoon, goods that will make you look so pretty, go, have a look.\u201d Lisa smiled, taking Erna\u2019s hand.Unable to subdue Lisa\u2019s sudden excitement, Erna stood and allowed her maid to bring her to the goods.Mrs Fitz had been in charge of organising the honeymoon and was unaware that the old nanny had ordered Erna some new things to take with her. She already had enough and was unaware she needed yet more.\u201cLook, aren\u2019t they pretty?\u201d Lisa said.Erna had allowed Lisa to lead her to the bedroom, where, piled on the floor were beautifully wrapped boxes. They contained hats, shoes, dresses and coats. To top it all off, there was a beautiful new trunk to store them all in. Erna felt embarrassed to be so lavishly doted on.\u201cNo matter where you go, you will be the most beautiful, I will make sure of it. I have been learning hard with Mrs Fitz.\u201d Lisa said.It seemed like such a weighty task to entrust a fledgeling maid, but Erna would not permit anyone else, not even Mrs Fitz to attend her during the honeymoon, which meant Lisa was coming with her and if Erna could help it, Lisa would be by her side no matter where she found herself.All of the items that Mrs Fitz had picked out suited Erna very well and Erna enjoyed these delicately beautiful things. Especially since she was used to the vulgar things Viscount Hardy always seemed to parade around with.\u201cAre you not happy, your Highness?\u201d Lisa said.She noticed that Erna did not display the same level of excitement as her, instead, she stood staring blankly at the display of elegant dresses and dainty shoes. Maybe the frills were too much for her taste.\u201cNo, its not that.\u201d Erna said.Erna;\u2019s heart grew heavy as she thought all of these presents before her might have come from Bjorn. All the debt the Hardy family already owed and things just seem to keep piling up. How long until Erna outstays her welcome, pushes the debt too far, how much more is Bjorn going to put up with the Hardy family taking from him?\u201cI think I understand, after all, the first destination on the honeymoon is Lars.\u201d Lisa said, misunderstanding the lengthy silence. \u201cYou must be upset, I am too, your highness.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, Lisa.\u201d Erna said, trying to smile.There must be a reason that they go to Gladys\u2019 home country. The Grand Duke and Duchess were not just off on some fancy honeymoon like normal newly wed couples.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I wont let anyone compare you to Princess Gladys, you will be the prettiest in the world.\u201d Lisa continued, taking Erna\u2019s hand and reaffirming her fighting spirit.Mrs Fitz came into the room with a serious look that made Erna\u2019s heart sink. She gave Lisa a glare that made the maid shrink away, before locking her eyes on Erna.\u201cGuests have arrived, your highness.\u201d The old woman said.\u201cA guest? Ah yes.\u201d Erna said.She was suddenly reminded of the days itinerary that Mrs Fitz had briefed her on that morning. The only thing of any note was a royal tutor coming to teach Erna what, she didn\u2019t know yet.\u201cLisa, could you tidy up the clothes, while I\u2019m away.\u201d Without waiting Erna turned to Mrs Fitz. \u201cLets go.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The meeting went on for far longer than was scheduled and once concluded, the study fell into deep silence. Exhausted from the battle with the bank\u2019s director, Bjorn drank his cold tea in silence and sparked a cigar into life.Fatigue from the repetitively busy schedule reminded him of his duties when he was the crown prince. It was a forced march that made him constantly weary.\u201cI\u2019ll deposit all my savings into the bank.\u201d Something Bjorn was forced to agree to thanks to his fathers unconventional condition.His father was very skilled, he had awe for his father, who had baited him with something he could never refuse. It made him chuckle lightly.He had been offered a considerable amount and the symbolism of managing the kings fortune caused the banks to practically go to war with each other. This in a time where the banks controlled the capital market, whom so ever got to look after the kings fortune, would also gain royal favour. It felt like Bjorn was taking more than just the bait.The first destination on the royal honeymoon was Lars, which was the most important political destination. It was also a very important visit for his bank too, as he was going to gobble up one of Lars\u2019 insolvent commercial banks.\u201cShall we begin the merger then.\u201d Bjorn had concluded the meeting, extinguishing his half smoked cigar.The directors, who had settled in for a long debate, rose from their seats with grinning faces full of joy. They hurriedly left the study, leaving Bjorn half laid out in his chair. Bjorn was eager to get this under way, mostly because it meant he could relax on the boat during the crossing.Come to think of it, his wife, Erna, the Grand Duchess, must be finished preparing to leave by now.At that moment, when Bjorn remembered the radiant and pale face of his beautiful wife, he heard the bank directors exclaim at the door \u201cAh, your highness.\u201d It seemed like they ran into Erna on their way out.Bjorn massaged his own neck as he turned to face the door and saw Erna come into the study. She stepped forward with urgent meaning in her gait.\u201cBjorn, can we talk for a second.\u201d she asked. Her tone was more agitated than usual.Bjorn sat up right and nodded, while Erna came across the room and sat in the chair opposite facing him.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Erna?\u201d Bjorn said slowly, he was studying Erna\u2019s hair and the elaborate shape of the bun braid. Her maid was improving quite well.\u201cI heard it was you who asked Mrs Fitz to teach me, that.\u201d Erna eventually said, after a couple false starts.\u201cAh, that.\u201d Bjorn nodded calmly. He reached forward and took up the glass of water on the table. Erna looked off to the side, embarrassment flushing her cheeks. She gave them a little rub before turning back to Bjorn again. It seemed that she had not learned very well.\u201cDid you not come because I was too clumsy, or because I was ignorant?\u201d Erna asked.\u201cWhat, me not coming?\u201d Though confused by the question, Bjorn remained flat and cool.\u201cYou never came to my bedroom, not since that day.\u201d Erna said. Her delicate little hands twisted the hem of her dress as she spoke with a trembling voice. The conscious smile slowly melted from Bjorn\u2019s face as he became more aware of Erna.\u201cWell, if you know that, then shouldn\u2019t you be doing your part, not here?\u201d Bjorn let out a sigh.The real reason he had not returned to Erna since that night was that he was just plain busy. He had to stay in the capital and could not return to the Palace when he would like. Of course, he couldn\u2019t tell Erna that, he had to leave her believing what she believed.The pleasure of his wife\u2019s body was great, but he did not want to have to go through the trouble of dealing with her ignorance again. He will come to her again, when she is ready to be a proper wife. Erna would wait for him.\u201cI have a lot\u2026I know I am lacking, in that respect. I realise that I got married without know the things I should know, as a wife.\u201d Erna said. She had been looking down at her feet as she spoke. \u201cI am really sorry.\u201dMrs Peg, who was said to have taught all the royal ladies the work of the bedchamber, was a gentle and kind person. Erna followed easily, as she explained what was expected of her, step by step.As soon as Mrs Peg mentioned anything sexual, Erna lost all consciousness and fell away into an absent coma. Erna couldn\u2019t stand it and in the end, bolted from the class room, spraying apologies to Mrs Peg on the way out.\u201cI will learn.\u201d Erna said to Bjorn. \u201cI know it\u2019s part of my role, I will not shirk my responsibilities, but\u2026\u201d Erna paused to catch her breath. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want anyone else to teach me, if at all possible\u2026Bjorn, I want you to teach me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Bjorn said after taking a moment to fight off the drunken haze muddling his thoughts in the face of his wife\u2019s demands, and even though he had just scolded her for skipping her duties, she was scolding him for skipping his.\u201cYou are my husband, so teach me.\u201d Erna said, firmly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Erna\u2019s cheeks were brightly flushed at that moment. She acted so brazenly, like she was retrieving something that was rightfully hers.\u201cErna, are you serious?\u201d As his fingers clenched in disbelief, Bjorn asked.She hesitated at first, but her answer came as strong as ever. \u201cYes, of course, I beg you with sincerity.\u201dBjorn stared at her blankly for a moment, before a laugh came out from deep inside. He felt like he knew enough about Erna by now to know when this woman wasn\u2019t playing around, but it still felt like she knew more than she was putting on. Either from brochures, or the telling of vague stories, was she really acting like she knew nothing of bedchamber education.Can you teach me?\u00a0She was being bashful, like she had run away from class, only to later return and realise she had missed out on a lot. He found her ignorance cute and hateful at the same time.\u201cBjorn.\u201d She said his name, pleadingly and he felt a tingle run through him, followed by a warmth when she looked at him with those big, innocent eyes.As Bjorn reached up and pulled the tie of his dress loose, a sharp knock came at the door.\u201cYour Highness?\u201d Mrs Fitz called from beyond the door.Upon hearing the old nanny\u2019s voice, Erna wore an expression that could only be described as a deer caught in a trap. Her big, wet eyes pleadingly looked up at Bjorn, desperation turned her smile the wrong way.\u201cYes, come in.\u201d Bjorn said.As soon as there was an answer, the door opened and Mrs Fitz stepped into the room.\u201cAh, Her Highness is here too.\u201d Mrs Fitz said, noticing Erna was also in the study.Mrs Fitz wore a face that reminded Bjorn of the time he had run and hid as a boy, after accidentally knocking over one of his fathers most prized paintings. He laughed and reached for a sip of water.\u201cYou\u2019re highness, I\u2019ve been looking all over the place for you, you know you shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d Mrs Fitz said to Erna.\u201cLeave her be, Mrs Fitz.\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cBut\u2026The tutor\u201d Mrs Fitz started to argue, but Bjorn raised a hand to silence her.\u201cLady Erna is my wife.\u201dHe sounded ridiculous in his mind, but he would not reverse the decision, especially not after his actions made Erna smile at him, relief on her face. Beneath, he could see infinite confidence brewing in the young woman.\u201cTell the tutor we\u2019re sorry about the schedule clash, but we are having a few days off before our honeymoon.\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cYes,\u201d Mrs Fitz said. She seemed little upset, but Mrs Fitz skilfully suppressed her emotions. \u201cBut this is not polite to Mrs Peg, her highness, the Grand Duchess must personally ask for her understanding and bring the matter to a proper conclusion.\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Bjorn said, looking at Erna, who nodded her head emphatically, with the confidence that said she could do anything.\u201cMrs Peg, the teacher, let her know that the Grand Duchess will have dinner with our guest, maybe that will be a suitable apology for coming all this way.\u201dMrs Fitz\u2019s glare softened at the suitable suggestion, it would seem like maybe it would be a suitable apology after all. Mrs Fits bowed and left the study with the troublesome Grand Duchess.\u201cThank you, Bjorn.\u201d Erna said before she left.She turned and smiled at him shyly, embarrassed that she had completely forgotten about her prior engagement with the royal tutor. When the door closed and the two women\u2019s footsteps faded, the study was left to its serene quiet.Bjorn tilted his head back and laughed up a the ceiling. She was quite the naive and demanding woman. She was like hot ice, or a dark sun. A dangerous deer.He always seemed to get caught out unexpectedly by dangerous deer. He would have thought he would have learned to put his guard up by now, but this deer was different to the previous deer, still very dangerous mind.Bjorn washed his thoughts away with a languid sigh, he opened the silver cigar box and pulled out a fresh one. It would have been boring to spend the time on the boat alone, so he was grateful to have Erna there with him. He liked the idea of enjoying the venison presented to him on his plate. She may be irritating in many ways, but she was also very delicious.Bjorn smoked away on the cigar and picked up a file folder. The sighs and laughter stopped and were replaced with the soft rasping of flipping papers.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Gladys gently turned the pages of the photo album, with thin bony fingers. She paused when she came to a picture of a young nineteen year old woman in her spring. It was a wedding photo, the same one that spread all over Lechen and Lars, the very pride of the two nations unified.How could I not love this man?\u00a0She thought to herself.Looking back at it now, she couldn\u2019t believe how she had let herself be blinded by infant love, but maybe she couldn\u2019t have been any less foolish. She loved Gerald Owen, he was a good man. The genius poet of Lars, the Crown Princess\u2019 lover and Carl\u2019s father.Gladys took a sip of her drink and turned over to the next page. She was met with the deep, stern eyes of her lover. He had such a youthful handsomeness about him. Tears welled and blurred the picture of Gerald. Flipping the page again, the tears came out in a full blown stream down her cheeks. The picture was that of Carl, who looked just like his father.Carl Dniester.Bjorn had never seen the child, but at least gave him the Royal Family name. That was the price of the secret pact between Lechen and Lars and thanks to that, Carl was able to live his short life with honour.\u201cThank you and sorry.\u201d Gladys said to the picture of Carl.The sobbing finally subsided after reaching uncontrollable levels that made Gladys whole body shake. Finally calm, she got up to open the window and as she did so, a cold breeze blew into the room.She met Gerald at a routine social gathering in the spring of seventeen, about the time when the talk of marriage was on everyone\u2019s lips. It wrenched her heart to know that it could never, but the love was like an uncontrollable fever.She constantly dreamed of giving up everything and follow her dream, run away with Gerald and never look back. Gladys had to submit to her reality and except her marriage to Bjorn. In her belly, she could never dream of what was growing there.On the day everyone found out that Gladys was with child, Bjorn looked at her with scorn. She wished they had slept together and she could have pretended that child was his, but they had not so much as hugged.Gladys couldn\u2019t bare the thought of letting another man touch her, not after meeting her one true love and the passion they had shared. She didn\u2019t want to betray him. On their wedding night she apologised pathetically to Bjorn.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0Gladys had said.\u201cIt\u2019s okay Princess,\u201d\u00a0Bjorn said.\u00a0\u201cLet me know when you\u2019re feeling confident enough, until then, I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201dIn the morning shared an awkward breakfast, and the morning after, and the day after that and so on. All the while, Carl grew inside Gladys\u2019 tummy.For a long time Gladys couldn\u2019t except another man into her bed because of the memory of her first true love. Then came a certain point where Bjorn turned and became too frightening, and difficult, to approach. So spring passed by, summer came and with it, the news of the Crown Princess\u2019 pregnancy.If only she hadn\u2019t let herself get involved in immature love. If only she had been clever enough to play the game and fool everyone else. If only she had the confidence to do what needed to be done, then everyone wouldn\u2019t be so unhappy now.Gladys sobbed softly as a chilly breeze blew across her. She hated her own frankness and inability to deceive. It was hard to bear the hatred and her heart felt like it was going to explode.\u201cKeep it quiet, we will keep things as they are for now.\u201dBjorn had said when Gladys confessed to him. He did not raise his voice, or show any anger. It was actually a lot scarier.\u201cI mean to congratulate you on your pregnancy, so be happy and carry on as the great Crown Princess you\u2019ve been so far. Do you understand, Princess?\u201dOn the surface, the days continued on as normal, blissful happiness of the newly-weds. Tranquillity layers over the top of scrupulous lies. If Gladys had given birth to a daughter, they could have continued on like that indefinitely.But a son was born.Gladys returned to Lars with her son in tow after only a year since the grand wedding. Externally, she was with the son of Bjorn Dniester. She hoped that returning to Lars, she could be with the real man she loved and live happily with the child\u2019s real father, but it wasn\u2019t to last.When the two reunited, it was as it was before, the love and the passion they felt for one another was as strong and bright as ever. He was a good man.Gerald was comfortable and warm toward her, she was at ease when he was with her. As time went on, Gladys found herself thinking about Bjorn more and more out of guilt. She would smile vaguely at Gerald and their love became less fervent.Gerald passed away a season later, pistol suicide and soon after, Carl followed his father after succumbing to a fever. Gladys felt grief like none should ever have to. A lone widow with a lost child, could there be any worse heartbreak for a single person to have to go through?Although Gladys wept for her lost loves, but as the misfortune passed, Gladys found that her feelings for Bjorn she did not see when she was with him.It was all meaningless though.Gladys tossed the photo table on the chair and flopped onto the bed. She didn\u2019t bother closing the window, or throwing the curtains over herself. She hoped that she would close her eyes and never have to open them again.Morning came and Gladys did open her eyes again.\u201cPrincess, oh my, your Highness, please don\u2019t do this, are you really willing to risk your health?\u201dGladys lazily turned her head to the door and saw her dutiful maid standing there.\u201cI need to go back to Lars, would you make the arrangements.\u201d Gladys said, lazily pulling herself up from the bed.A dark shadow fell over the maids face as she heard the words she had been waiting for for a long time. All Lechen knew the Grand Duke and Duchess would be boarding a boat soon, destined for Lars as they started their honeymoon.\u201cYes, Princess, do you want to be on the same boat as the Grand Duke and\u2026\u201d The maid didn\u2019t get chance to finish her sentence.\u201cWhat do they have to do with me?\u201d Gladys snapped, staring blankly toward the window. \u201cIt\u2019s all pointless.\u201d With that, Gladys fell back onto the bed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Along with the normal crowds, there added to it all the people that had come to see the Ducal couple set off on their honeymoon. This more than doubled the number of people stood dockside.Going on another honeymoon, to his ex-wife\u2019s country, was quite surprising to a lot of people and what really tipped people over, was the fact that his ex-wife was getting on the same boat. Even those who were not interested in local gossip and rumour came out to watch.\u201cThe more I think about it, the more I notice the Princess is doing too much, too, too much.\u201d Lisa said loud enough for the other maids to hear. They just looked at her disapprovingly, but she didn\u2019t care.If you want to hit me, do it while you\u2019re looking at me. I will pluck every single hair from your head.!That fighting spirit was probably why all the other maids only whispered behind Lisa\u2019s back, out of ear shot. All the more when they witnessed Lisa rough up a maid who had been saying some not very nice things about the Grand Duchess and comparing her to Princess Gladys.\u201cWhy do we have to share a boat with that awful woman.\u201d Lisa said, as she passed by one particular maid who was fond of Gladys.After spending the last fifteen days at Schuber palace, Lisa came to realise that pretty much all the maids were rooting for Gladys and were on her side for everything. There were very few maids that regarded Erna\u2019s new hostess status and seemed ashamed to call her their master.Every time those mouths flapped and spoke ill of Erna, Lisa would curse Gladys louder, even though the Princess was one she had once admired and respected, but she had no choice, you get what you\u2019re given.Lisa followed on after Erna, glaring at the Prince, he was the culprit behind all of this. Thanks to his being taller and slimmer than most, he stood out, truly like a poisonous mushroom that dazzles and tempts. That is why the Grand Duchess fell for him.Lisa looked at Erna and became distraught, she really did look like a lady that had swallowed a poisoned mushroom. She had that twinkle in her eye every time she looked up at the Prince. She tried to hide her true feelings, but Lisa could see the girl in the throws of her first love.I should have used my Grandmothers teachings, about not falling for guys with pretty faces.\u00a0Lisa thought to herself.After thinking on it for a long while, Lisa figured her grandmother would probably change her tune upon seeing Bjorn. And anyway, the two are married, there is nothing wrong with a wife looking up at her husband in such a manner?She looked back at the Prince. He was so elegant and courteous with Erna, escorting her along the boat to their room. He was perfect and that was the problem, he was too perfect and that perfection disturbed Lisa.He must be aware of how Erna feels about him, everyone else can see it, so surely he can too. Even so, there was a cold aspect in his attitude towards Erna. Lisa felt like the Prince was treating Erna like a gentleman\u2019s cane, similar to the one he is always seen with. While he walked with Erna, he did not have the cane, but leaned on her like she was one and he treated her as such. Graceful, formal, but cold and uncaring.Lisa glared at the back of Prince Bjorn\u2019s head, as they walked through first class. He must have felt it, because the Prince turned and looked at Lisa. He considered her like he would consider any insect. Indifferent, not his concern. Lisa felt her heart melt and sink to the basement of her soul. She understood in that moment why all the girls cut out pictures of the Prince and stuck them up on their walls. Erna was married to that.Lisa composed herself and redoubled her ardent glare at the Prince. Look at your wife, isn\u2019t she so pretty? Maybe you\u2019d fall in love with her if you just looked.Erna was not one to be merited on her looks alone, she had many beautiful qualities about her, but with the competition being against Gladys, maybe looks was all anyone actually cared about.If so, I will make you the prettiest lady in the land.Lisa had always been determined in that and she worked hard at it. She was so proud of how pretty her mistress was, but why doesn\u2019t the Prince notice how pretty Erna is too?Lisa gritted her teeth in humiliation. She had adorned the prettiest woman in the world for Bjorn and he seemed blind to it. Even though the land gossiped about how Erna only became Grand Duchess because of her looks, so why couldn\u2019t Bjorn see it too? He could look around heaven and earth and not find a single woman more beautiful.\u201cDamn it.\u201d Lisa muttered.As she looked about, she noticed something on the opposite deck, the enemy, the woman Lisa had nearly forgotten all about. Princess Gladys.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The first impression Bjorn got after their first encounter on the boat was, shockingly, a positive one. Bjorn thought it was great that Gladys was holding onto Lechen. It was good to see that this woman, who had given him the shock of his life, was such a great person. It was comforting.\u201cIt\u2019s been awhile, Bjorn.\u201d Gladys said. Even in such an embarrassing situation, she remained calm and Bjorn responded with a gentle, but respectful nod.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit late, but congratulations on getting married.\u201d Gladys continued.If it had been any other woman, Bjorn would have just laughed at them for trying to play worn out tricks, but this was Gladys, her way of getting at people was with kindness and geniality.Gladys greeted Bjorn once more and like a heroine of some tragic fate, but with the attitude of regality, Gladys led her party away and back on their intended course. The people who had witnessed the scene unfroze and breathed a sigh in unison.\u201cErna.\u201d Bjorn said.Erna had not stopped looking up at him with eyes that trembled like the feathers that adorned her hat.Once Erna had composed herself, Bjorn motioned toward the deck at the end of the boarding ramp with a wink. It was going to be there that the Ducal couple would stand in marital bliss for all the people that came to see them off. Erna was obedient, not forgetting her duties.Erna waved to the onlookers, her bright smile never leaving her face. Not like her wedding day, where she had no idea where to look. She was improving remarkably well.Bjorn was proud of his dutiful wife and her ability to learn quickly. She never once mentioned Gladys\u2019 name in front of the masses who were eager to stir the pot for any gossip they could get their vulturous claws into.Erna\u2026A woman who is gentle, kind and not at all annoying.Based on the last two weeks, Bjorn\u2019s conclusion was pretty much that. She sometimes acted like a rubber ball, bouncing all over the place, but he didn\u2019t mind that so much. She was quiet. Beautiful and harmless. She was a woman who perfectly met his expectations and Bjorn was satisfied. Though, it was still too soon to know for sure.Once they were done with the waving and smiling, of greeting the crew and a short tour of the boat, they finally made it to their cabin. Erna started to get agitated.\u201cHow can they do this?\u201d Erna said.She looked at the guest room with awe. It was a room that had no business being on a ship. It had two bedrooms, a bathroom, a small solarium filled with palm trees and plants. A spacious drawing room. It made no sense, it felt like mansion.\u201cLook,\u201d she rushed over, pointing wildly. \u201cIt has a fireplace.\u201d Bjorn just laughed.\u201cYour highness, when will lunch be\u2026\u201d A man servant said, standing in the door way. He had been watching Erna the entire time.\u201cI\u2019m good, but please, what ever my wife would like.\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cAre you not going to eat?\u201d Erna said.Bjorn shook his head and went into his room, leaving Erna behind.Standing among the busy servants who were unpacking their things, Erna felt lost and followed after Bjorn. He had taken off his jacket and laid out on the sofa. The servants that were in here tidying things away left the two alone.\u201cI\u2019ll get some rest, its been quite the day already.\u201d Bjorn said.When Erna finally gathered the courage to speak, Bjorn spoke first.\u201cI just don\u2019t feel like doing anything for awhile, is all.\u201d Bjorn said and met Erna\u2019s gaze with a soft smile.\u201cOkay.\u201d She felt a little embarrassed, but she agreed.Right up until they left the Palace, Bjorn was in meetings and heated discussions. The ministers and officials were strict and obstinate, comparably so with Mrs Fitz, he must be so tired.You knew that very well.It is too much to beg to do things together, like a spoilt child. Erna knew the things Bjorn had to do and the late hours he had to work.\u201cThen shall we have tea, here, together?\u201d Erna said.Erna was curious about the restaurant on the ship, but she was willing to compromise. Unfortunately, Bjorn seemed utterly unwilling to sit at the negotiation table with her and work something out.\u201cLet\u2019s have dinner together.\u201d Bjorn said, checking his watch.Feeling dejected, Erna looked at the clock on the writing desk. It was only 10 in the morning. Bjorn had told her to go spend half the day on her own.Erna was sullen and left Bjorn to his napping. Before she closed the door, she looked back at him in anticipation, but he had thrown off his tie and his eyes were closed.\u201cWhere would you like to go? I hear the restaurant is quite nice, would you like to go there for some tea?\u201d Lisa asked.Erna smiled awkwardly at the young lady, who approached her with a face full of expectation. Her cheeks flushed as she recalled the conversation they had last night, about all the things they could do on a ship the size of a city.\u201cYes, let us have tea.\u201d Erna said.\u201cUs? You want to go out with me on your honeymoon\u2026\u201dDamn you Prince.\u00a0Lisa muttered under her breath. Putting Erna on a boat with his ex-wife and then sailing to the ex-wife\u2019s land wasn\u2019t bad enough.\u201c\u2026Yes, Your Highness.\u201d Lisa said with a light nod, trying to swallow the harsh words that were rising up from inside her.Erna looked at Lisa quietly and smiled brightly. The Grand Duchess\u2019 smile was so bright, even after losing her gentleman\u2019s cane. Lisa became more depressed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I can eat dinner by myself.\u201d Erna thought.The servants, who had been waiting forever, were relieved to hear they could finally set the table for dinner. They had been waiting patiently forever, not being allowed to wake up Bjorn, or get Erna to wait.\u201cThank you, it looks lovely.\u201d Erna said.She was being genuine, as the table was set in the solarium, the table the maids made up really did look lovely.From the ornate centrepiece of woven flowers, to the delicate lace table cloth and silver candlestick holders with engraved swirls. She had never thought she would be able to enjoy such luxury on a ship. She also didn\u2019t expect to spend the first days of her honeymoon as a loner.Erna ate the food presented to her slowly. She wasn\u2019t hungry, but the servants had put a lot of effort into this and she didn\u2019t want it to go to waste.She had spent the day touring the cruise ship with Lisa. They drank tea, walked the decks and spent time in the casino. It was a pleasant enough time, but it would have been better if Bjorn had not shunned her and violated by prosecutors.She thought it would have been better in the evening, but when she got back to her room and got changed for dinner, Bjorn was still asleep.Erna chewed her food and swallowed, looking about the room timidly as she did so. The room filled with the warm light of the fireplace, which only made the palm trees look gloomy and ominous. The solarium felt as vast and empty as the ocean outside her window. She wished the cutlery didn\u2019t clank so much, drawing attention to the pathetic young girl eating alone.After getting married, Erna spent most of her dinners alone over the last fifteen days. She attributed that to Bjorn just being too busy, but now they were on their honeymoon, nothing changed. At times, it felt like she was the only person in the world, filling up grand halls with her tiny presence.Starting up conversations with the servants was like talking to herself, they would nod and shuffle away as soon as they could. So she did start muttering to herself.The palace was so vast and empty, now the boat was vast and empty. Yes, there were people around, but they rarely gave her a second glance. They retreated to shadowy corners to talk about her behind their fans and flat palms.Can I ever be happy?\u00a0Erna thought to her self, staring down at the food on her plate.Taking a deep breath, Erna slipped a small cut of meat between her trembling lips.\u201cIts been awhile Bjorn.\u201d\u00a0Gladys had said, after calling his name across the deck. It came again, to Erna\u2019s mind, trying to block out the echoing sound of busy cutlery.\u201cCall my name,\u201d\u00a0Bjorn had said on their first night.They had been a couple, a fact that Erna already knew, scratched her heart again. For her, Bjorn had been her first, but she was Bjorn\u2019s second. The feeling crept into her chest like a chill.There was also her husbands nonchalant attitude. It was a sad understanding to realise nothing excited him, there was no feelings of anticipation. It felt like all of this was some boring repetition for him. A dance played out a hundred times a day.Erna put down the cutlery and pressed the heels of her palms into her hot eyes. She felt weakened by unfamiliar surroundings, but even the mansion was unfamiliar to her. At least there she didn\u2019t feel the desolate loneliness/How long am I going to last?Erna knew very well that people made bets against her like that. There were many mouths back at the palace, each voice she tried to block out, but they always reached her.Don\u2019t let yourself be swayed by careless gossip. Just do your best to be a good wife.She strengthened her resolve and made the same commitment each time, but in reality, how can the eternal second be happy?\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d Erna whispered to herself. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t know, so don\u2019t be silly.\u201dShe downed the glass of water and picked up her cutlery again. With renewed poise, Erna ate up the last of the food on her plate.When she was hungry her mind was weak, and a weak mind is prone to bad thoughts, and bad thoughts brought unhappiness. So the best thing she could do right now is eat well.She stabbed the fork deep into the meat and cut a square as large as her will. She had stuffed it halfway into her mouth when a figure appeared at the door.\u201cGood evening, Erna.\u201dHe\u2019s awake\u2026\u00a0She couldn\u2019t talk, her mouth was more than full.Erna grabbed her napkin and made as if to wipe sauce from her face, but disgorged the oversized bite into the cloth.\u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed, the food here is pretty good,\u201d Bjorn said. \u201cBut I will not soon forget what a big mouth you have.\u201d He cast the words with a sly smile.Erna\u2019s expression darkened and she finished wiping her lips and wrapped the meat up in the napkin. She turned to Bjorn, straight backed.\u201cWell, it would not have happened if you kept to the meal times.\u201d Erna said.\u201cAre you angry with me?\u201d Bjorn said, eye brow cocked.\u201cA little bit.\u201d Erna said, she suddenly felt small under his gaze.\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you wake me up?\u201d Bjorn responded as if he was the wounded party in this conversation.\u201cIt\u2026is it okay to wake you?\u201d Erna saidWhen Bjorn had finally woken up, he noticed that it was already past nine. He figured Erna had forgotten their dinner date, so took a lazy shower to wash away the sleep and went to the lounge. Only to find his wife sat having dinner by herself. Stuffing half a steak into her mouth like some ravenous beast.\u201cOf course. You wont be thrown in jail for waking me for our dinner date.\u201d Bjorn laughed. \u201cWell, maybe\u2026\u201dBjorn sat in his chair and food was hastily placed in front of him. He smiled at his wife and began to eat slowly. Erna watched him Bjorn like a hawk and resumed her meal as Bjorn did. Bjorn couldn\u2019t help but think how cute she looked, making delicately small cuts.They began talking as naturally as if they had been talking the whole day away. At first, Erna was still a little heated, making remarks like she was still trying to express her unresolved anger, but she quickly fell into her usual manner and they spoke as if considering their usual, daily routine, like a chirruping bird.\u201cIs this your first time on a boat?\u201d Bjorn said, a smile on his lips as he listened to Erna talk about her exploration of the cruise ship.\u201cNo, second.\u201d She replied, pausing as she was putting peas in her mouth.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes, the first time was when we were on the lake, remember.\u201d Erna said, finally managing to get the peas into her mouth.Not realising it wasn\u2019t a joke, Bjorn burst out laughing. It was always like that. Erna could always make people laugh without trying, or even meaning too. The light in the room got brighter and the gloomy shadows retreated to the corners. It didn\u2019t feel so vast and empty any more.Bjorn laughed until his cheeks tingled and rang the small bell to call the attendant. Soon after, a servant came in with a bottle of wine.As he watched the dark liquid fill the glass, he was reminded of Gladys. Their honeymoon had been much different. She spent most of the time crying or engrossed in other things, while he was busy working. Even as they sat together for dinner, there was not much interaction, like a wall was put up between them. They had not shared a single decent conversation through the whole course of their honeymoon. Not like this.The servant finished pouring his wine and moved around the table to fill Erna\u2019s glass. Just as he tipped the bottle, Bjorn stopped him.\u201cNo, do not fill my wife\u2019s glass.\u201d He ordered.\u201cWhy, I can have a drink too.\u201d Erna said, frowning at Bjorn.\u201cI know.\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cThen why?\u201d\u201cYou have to study.\u201d\u201cOh, oh my.\u201dBjorn slowly emptied his glass as he looked at Erna. Even if she was irritable, he could no longer think of Gladys when he was with her. He could now see why he had never visited Erna for the last two weeks.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? You asked me to teach you, right?\u201d Bjorn said, filling his glass himself.\u201cYes, but\u2026\u201d Erna looked at her plate with impatience. All that was left was some peas and a potato. If she knew this was going to happen, she would not have eaten so much, so fast.\u201cAre you finished eating?\u201dBjorn leaned back in his chair with the wine glass. Erna\u2019s cheeks went a peach colour that reminded Bjorn of that first night.\u201cWait, I need to wash first,\u201d Erna said sternly.\u201cThen go and wash.\u201d Bjorn said, sipping at the wine. The glass was already empty again.\u201cNo, I mean, I need to take a shower.\u201dBjorn put down the empty glass and made to stand up, but Erna urgently begged. Bjorn\u2019s forehead wrinkled as he looked at the confusing mess of his wife, she had enticed him on and now wanted to run away?\u201cPlease, I need some time.\u201d Erna said.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI just finished eating.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cSo\u2026what if I\u2026throw up.\u201d Erna looked ashamed.It was a remark that hurt his pride. She felt like vomiting when they made love? Bjorn tried to laugh it off, thinking he understood a little better after realising Erna\u2019s small frame and the empty plate.\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d Bjorn poured another glass of wine. \u201cThat would be awkward.\u201dHe winked at her and Erna got up. He couldn\u2019t help but chuckle to himself as he watched her leave the solarium and buy herself some time, so she didn\u2019t throw up.It seemed like the start of a not so bad honeymoon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Erna was sat on the edge of the bed, fiddling with the hem of her dress, eyes wide and looking like an innocent doe, not knowing what to do with herself as Bjorn came and stood in front of her.She looked down at the floor, but Bjorn cupped her chin in his massive hands and gently turned her face up toward him.\u201cHow much have you learned so far?\u201d Bjorn smiled at her with warmth.\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d Erna said.She chose to lie instead of saying she didn\u2019t have the courage to sit through a single second of listening to Mrs Peg tell her how to please her husband. She had feigned being sick and ran from the lesson.\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t remember.\u201dSeeing Bjorn\u2019s scrutinising gaze made her squirm and her mouth was devoid of saliva.\u201cIs that so?\u201d Bjorn said and sat down beside her. \u201cThen I guess we have to start from the beginning.\u201dWith those words and remembering that first night, Erna laid back on the bed. Memorise of how painful and shameful it had been flooded her mind. She could feel tears already. She remembered the weight of him on top of her, coupled with the embarrassing pictures Mrs Peg had brought with her.\u201cIf you want to kiss me, you need to open your mouth.\u201d Bjorn said.He touched her lips with care and strength. When their eyes met, he could see hers trembling.\u201cHurry,\u201d he said without hesitating.His tone was welcoming, but there was no warmth in his calm eyes. Erna parted her lips. He really was a man that could do what ever he wanted. It was a wake-up call from the first night.Bjorn used his tongue to part her lips and pushed it into her mouth. Reflexively, Erna felt her body squirm, but she knew should couldn\u2019t push away. Wife\u2019s duty.It had been a short class, but it was enough to learn what it meant. In the book she had read in her room, it said that it was the wife\u2019s place to give pleasure to her husband. It was important for the smooth running of a marriage.Erna didn\u2019t understand how things like this could be enjoyable, but she did know that Bjorn never came to her room because he wasn\u2019t happy. He had been so displeased with her inability to please him, that he never came to her room again. Their marriage was rocky right from the start.The kiss kept going on, for a lot longer than that first night. Bjorn\u2019s tongue had free reign of her mouth and he used it all verily. He only let go only once her own tongue started to tingle. Their breath mingles as he pulled away and became rapid without them realising.\u201cI hate this thing,\u201d Bjorn said, tugging at Erna\u2019s nightgown. \u201cIts so cumbersome, I don\u2019t like it.\u201dIt had ties and buttons all the way up to the neck.\u201cOh, I\u2019ll wear a different one from now on.\u201d Erna said.\u201cNo, don\u2019t wear anything.\u201d Bjorn said.He unfastened the last button and pulled the last ribbon. He removed the cumbersome pile of lace and tossed it across the room. He then pulled down the tiny shorts that were smaller than the palm of his hand. It was such a cute little thing, decorated with more lace and ribbons.He kissed his dazed wife on the cheek and picked up her naked body. She let out a small yelp as he did so and placed her on his thigh.Bjorn took in every inch of his wife\u2019s delicate little body and legs. He thought about what how clumsy and troublesome she was. Yet, he didn\u2019t hate that any where near as much as he thought he did. In fact, he found it more attractive.Her pale body looked like it gathered in the moonlight coming in through the window. What man in their right might wouldn\u2019t like such a body? Her skin looked like the texture of porcelain, or ceramic but at a touch it was infinitely soft and warm.\u201cBjorn\u2026\u201d Erna whispered.She was flustered in not knowing what to do and looked at Bjorn with pleading eyes. She wanted to do something, but didn\u2019t know what.Bjorn laughed softly and buried his face in her chest. He wanted to dive into her and take in her sweet, freshly washed scent. He wanted to surround himself in her softness, wrap it around him and snuggle into it forever. With each gentle bite of her and each time he sucked her in, she moaned.He had already taken off his robe, his half naked torso pressed against her and took in her warmth. He lowered his hand across her smooth skin, down to between her legs. The inside of her held him without struggling and he could feel its warmth. It was wet and made the sound of muddied water. She let out a noise that reminded him of that first night and the pain he caused. She was not so easily convinced yet.Bjorn swallowed her lips and brought his hand up onto her back and held her firmly, like she was going to run away. His fingers glistened in the firelight with the wetness of her.\u201cDo not be like a corpse, Erna, you can move.\u201d Bjorn said, releasing her lips from his.\u201cW-what?\u201d\u201cFirst, the tongue.\u201dAs if to demonstrate, he took hold of her lips again with his and kissed her. She did her best to mimic his behaviour, gripping his lips with hers and clumsily wagging her tongue about. Even that was enough to make his heat rise.\u201cAnd your hands.\u201d Bjorn said.With a wink, Bjorn pointed to the hand that had been resting on his shoulder and had not moved the entire time.Erna wrapped her arms around his neck and summoned up the courage to move her hand down his body. She could feel his muscles and his frame. She could feel his skeleton as she stroked over his shoulder and down his chest to his side.Becoming distracted as she took in his form in her mind, she looked down and inadvertently saw the thing of his that caused so much pain. Without meaning to, she let out a soft sigh at the sight of it. It wasn\u2019t the first time seeing it, but it seemed so distant.It had been a long time since that night, but the feeling of it inside her was engrained in her memory. She did not remember the brief pleasure she felt, only that it felt like it was splitting her apart and that\u2019s what she was scared of.Following Erna\u2019s anxious gaze, he saw where she was looking and so gave her some encouragement. He took her delicate hand and squeezed it gently, moving it down. Realising his intent, Erna panicked, but Bjorn kept going.\u201cYou asked me to teach you.\u201d Bjorn said.His eyes narrowed as he looked at Erna, who shook her head vigorously. He smiled at her, seeing that she was stunned just by the touch of his firm hand.\u201cYou have to learn.\u201d Bjorn said. He wrapped his hand around hers and guided. \u201cYou have to move Erna.\u201dErna let Bjorn guide her and then, his hand moved away, leaving her to concentrate on the rhythm he had set. His hand moved back down to between her legs and as he pressed into her, she clamped her lips shut, trying to suppress a moan.She thought about Mrs Peg. She wished she had endured those embarrassing lessons rather than ask Bjorn to teach her, but it was too late now.\u201cLips.\u201d Bjorn said.He reached up and grabbed her chin with a firm hand, slowly increasing in pressure until Erna opened her mouth and let out a moan. Only then did Bjorn smile and let Erna go.He settled down between her legs, both of them panting on the bed and Bjorn pressed against her slowly. Erna sobbed with pain and squeezed his shoulder.The pain passed. Erna was wet enough to let Bjorn slide inside her with ease this time. He did not know how to be more devoted to his wife than this. Even if he did, the moment had passed.Firmly gripping her waist with one hand, he dug in all at once. Erna twisted under him and bit her lip.\u201cMoan.\u201d Bjorn said.He moved his hips toward her, even as he pulled her toward him. A rough moan escaped, forced by the warm feeling of tightening.\u201cBjorn\u2026I feel so ashamed.\u201d Erna gasped.She looked up into his cold grey eyes, her own begged in despair. She had done a lot of shameful things in her time, but moaning like this sounded so obscene, it was really hard to bear.\u201cI like to hear you moan, Erna.\u201d Bjorn said.Erna\u2019s eyes furrowed as she faced Bjorn, who smiled so sweetly. Did he really enjoy the pain of others? There was so much she wanted to say, but couldn\u2019t find her voice.The feeling of swaying grew as Bjorn dug deeper and deeper inside her. The sound of wet flesh rubbing rose in volume rapidly. She didn\u2019t know if she wanted to cry, or feel relief that there was an even more lewd sound beside her moaning.\u201cAh, don\u2019t do it, please, ah\u2026\u201dWhen his hand went from her waist, to the bed, she began to struggle again. Her best efforts to push him away were in vain and all she could do was let out a shrieking groan and twist around.The moment she was overwhelmed by irresistible sensations, she thought back to when her father would beat her. Even though she knew the two situations were completely different, her body shrank away. There was a strange resemblance in the sound of being beaten, the lethargy and facing an unbeatable opponent.Fortunately, as she felt overwhelmed, Bjorn offered a reprieve and slowed down. He leaned down to face her.\u201cHug me.\u201d Bjorn said calmly.\u201cDo you like that too?\u201d Erna said in a daze.\u201cYes.\u201d Bjorn said and nodded. He licked his dry lips. \u201cI like it.\u201d He kissed her soft red cheeks that looked like apples.She put her arms round him and started caressing her delicate hands about the base of his neck and around his shoulder blades. It was cute.Bjorn sighed at her barely perceptible touch and moved to his original task. Even as she gasped for breath, she did not let go of him. She was so tight and wet. Her soft moans tickled inside his chest and he could not resist any longer.He sped up, kissing her wet eyes and hot cheeks, her quivering lips and behind her ears without stopping. He had a feeling that his wife\u2019s body would only get better with time.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Bjorn and Erna did not leave the bed until late in the morning. As he put on the dressing gown and tried to stand up, Erna grabbed his hand. She was curled up and still, as if dead. He looked down at her and she looked up at him with trembling eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t go, you can stay here.\u201d\u00a0 Erna said. \u201cI won\u2019t disturb you.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t rest, but you should. We can have lunch together at your favourite restaurant.\u201d Bjorn said.He gently brushed the hair in her face to behind her ear and gave her a warm smile. Erna let go of his hand and meekly accepted.\u201cSleep well, Erna.\u201d Bjorn said and bent down to kiss her flushed cheek.The door closed behind him and Erna drifted back to sleep as she watched the door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The hand writing was familiar, but the seal was not. He put the letter down with a dejected smile.\u201cErna Dniester.\u201dHe recalled her face when he whispered her name, a name that he was still not used to. She had been a younger sister to him, as Erna Hardy, a lovely girl from a rural village. Erna Hardy.\u201cI\u2019ll write a letter.\u201dErna\u2019s face floated above the stationary, densely filled with neat handwriting, she wore a bright smile.Baroness Baden had invited him to lunch, back in Autumn, just before the wedding. She expressed her gratitude for Pavel\u2019s friendship with Erna and that the family were emotionally indebted to him. He could feel her intent, to sort out the emotional connection before the wedding and Pavel\u2019s heart fluttered like dust devils in the desert.It was the last time, it had to be the last time that Erna and Pavel could face each other as childhood friends. Their friendship ended there, when the country girl became Her Highness, the Grand Duchess.Pavel smiled softly and reached out to touch Erna\u2019s cheek. After a moment she reached up to take his hand, looking at him blankly. She was trying to smile, but only looked at him blankly. She nodded her head as if to say she understood.Erna watched his back as he left later that evening. She was afraid he was not going to look back, but before he reached the end of the street, Pavel turned to see Erna waving slightly, she was still that little girl he had met in the village square, with one missing front tooth.He raised a hand to her, but did not wave and he said a final goodbye to the woman that was his sister, but now his Princess.Pavel opened his eyes and let the memory fade and started to read the letter.My Dearest Pavel.I know what you meant and I fully understand, but Pavel, I wanted to say my final goodbye properly. I didn\u2019t think I would get the chance, but when Mrs Fitz said it was courteous to write to my family, to thank them for all the days gone by, I naturally thought of you.Thank you, Pavel Lore.Thank you for reaching out to a lonely, muddy, wet child and giving me a ride on your cart. It was so lovely. Thank you for being patient with me, when I kept following you around the village. Thank you for all the lovely sweets and pictures you gave me, I love them all. Thank you for being a familiar, friendly face when I came to the city, I would have been so lost without you. I am so grateful for you and your kindness. I wish it wasn\u2019t so, but this has to be my last goodbye and my only regret is that I am unable to pay you back for all that you have done.I wont be able to write to you any more, but I will be okay, I promise, so you don\u2019t need to worry about me any more. I will be fine.It is sad that our friendship has to end here, like this, but I will never forget you and I will cherish all the memories we have together. Please, promise me you will go out and find happiness for yourself.Bye, Erna Dniester.Pavel smiled, he could feel every ounce of sincerity in every written word contained within the neat handwriting. She had a long way to go, but Erna was so full of will and seeing Erna\u2019s final farewell, he was somewhat relieved.He folded the letter with care and slipped it deep into the drawer of his desk. He took up the cauldron and headed out.Red leaves carpeted the path all the way to the art centre. He wished it hadn\u2019t rained that day, if only the Prince hadn\u2019t been out that day and reached the meeting point before he did. If, if, if\u2026The thoughts drifted through his mind like falling leaves tumbling in the wind. They disappeared before too long. The same as the thought about why the Prince would take Erna to be his second wife.The past can not be undone, so there was no point lingering on it. Erna would be on her cruise right about now, as the Grand Duchess of Lechen. All he could do now is wish Erna the happiest marriage. He wished, at the very least, she was loved.It was a strange wish, but he wished it with all the sincerity he could muster, because it would bring Erna happiness.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Bjorn\u2019s bedroom had been empty, the sound of running water gave away that he was having a shower.Erna felt guilty for sneaking into her husband\u2019s bedroom while he was showering.Husband.He was her husband, so why shouldn\u2019t she be allowed to sneak into her husband\u2019s bedroom while he was showering?Erna looked for the best spot for an uninvited guest to sit and delicately placed herself on the sofa in front of the porthole and tried to catch her breath.While she had been walking the deck with Lisa, they ran into the captain. He said they were coming to an area that was frequented by Dolphins. Excitedly, Erna ran back to get Bjorn.\u201cBjorn.\u201d She called out.The shower stopped and Bjorn eventually came out of the bathroom, draped in a towel and getting water everywhere. His eyes narrowed when he saw Erna perched on the soft.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dHe came and sat down next to Erna, seeing that she was excited, the stern gaze lifted. He did not scold her for helping herself into his room and she felt tension lift from her.\u201cHave you seen Dolphins before?\u201d Erna asked, unable to hide the excitement.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cDo you like Dolphins?\u201d The excitement faded a little.\u201cNo.\u201d Bjorn said dryly as he towelled his hair.\u201cWell, they say that seeing a Dolphin is good luck.\u201d Erna said, not wanting to let the mood take her excitement away.\u201cAh, luck.\u201dBjorn looked at his wife. From the hat on her head, to the parasol in her lap, she had been finely dressed since she got up that morning.\u201cThe captain has informed me that we will be passing through an area where Dolphins frequent, I was hoping you would like to see them with me.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Bjorn said flatly, despite the shy smile.His tone was firm. He had a vague idea of where his wife had been talking about. It must have been somewhere near here that his first wife had seen Dolphins on their honeymoon.It was on that first honeymoon, as he had been escorting Gladys to a party, he had stepped aside to let some people pass, coming from the other way. He happened to glance out to the sea and saw a pod of Dolphins swimming alongside the boat.It had been said it brought good luck to the ship when Dolphins swam in its wake. It seems like history was repeating itself as someone spoke of luck that day too. Seeing the Dolphins, the happily married couple moved on with smiles on their lips and joy in their eyes.Luck. Good or bad?Bjorn let out a sigh as he went over to the small desk and opened the cigar case.\u201cYou should go ahead, if you\u2019re curious.\u201d Bjorn said, placing a cigar between his lips.\u201cAlone, by myself?\u201d Erna pouted.\u201cYes.\u201dBjorn leaned back in the chair and lit the cigar, taking puffs of it between his fingers and drifted off into his thoughts, thinking that Erna would leave.\u201cThen I will see them next time too.\u201d Erna said.She put her parasol down and stood in front of him, she did her best to loom over him like Mrs Fitz did, that always seemed to work. She looked at Bjorn expectantly, even though she already knew he wasn\u2019t the type of person to be dissuaded from a decision made.Bjorn seemed to consider her for a moment and then nodded. Without warning, he grabbed Erna by the waist and pulled her onto his lap. She let out a shriek as he did so. Bjorn then took off her hat, he threw it onto the desk, along with his cigar.Erna recognised his intent and felt a flush of embarrassment come over her. Her gloves, shawl and dress effortlessly fell to the floor and Erna realised she was now sitting on his lap in nothing but stockings and shoes.\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Erna said.\u201cA husband\u2019s duty.\u201d Bjorn said, smiling casually.His lips whispered his intent as his eyes wandered down Erna\u2019s front, bathed in the bright yellow light coming in from the porthole.With sullen eyes, Erna looked at him. He seemed to have no regard for what she wanted to do and was only absorbed in what he wanted to do. At that moment, he was licking and sucking on her breasts. That\u2019s not to say she wasn\u2019t enjoying it, the sensation of his wet tongue on her nipples made her mind go blank.Her unreserved husband\u2019s desire was strange to her and even if he didn\u2019t truly love her, he kissed her like he did. His shy touch told her that he wanted her deeply. That thinking made a part of her heart tingle and desire this herself.She decided that she wanted to believe his love was genuine and like the boat on a cruise, their relationship was on track. There might be the odd difficult corner, a hurdle that needed jumping, but she hoped they would dissolve in time.She remembered all the lessons of the past few days and let out a quick breath as Bjorn stroked his hands through her hair. She could feel the heat rise between her legs and his. Sudden embarrassment made her instinctively want to retreat, but Bjorn wrapped himself around her and prevented her from pulling away.\u201cWhy do you always run?\u201d A hand slid down her back and around her waist. She knew where he was going. He smiled miscellaneously.Captivated by the feeling of his touch, her mind went white. She exhaled quickly and averted her gaze. The sky through the porthole was clear and bright. She stretched for the curtains, the desire to close them was overwhelming, what if someone was to look in and see them?The moment she reached, Bjorn pushed against her lightly. She sighed as she felt the force of him inside, the pain was minimal, the pleasure was everything.\u201cHey, Bjorn, Bjorn.\u201d Erna cooed, trying to draw his attention to the curtains.Bjorn dug in as deeply as he could. A sharp exclamation and a harsh sigh erupted at the same time. She was barely able to control her body and could do nothing to escape. She simply clung to his shoulders and let him move without hesitation.As she sighed, Erna let her lips part like she had been taught. Bjorn kissed her deeply to compliment his student and stroked the back of her neck.Bjorn could feel Erna tremble as became tight. She was still impatient, but at least it was not as difficult as the first time. He became aware of her reaching for the curtains and found it very off putting.Let\u2019s see if I can\u2019t make you forget about the curtains.\u00a0He said to himself.With a sudden burst of movement, Bjorn grabbed Erna tightly and twisted round to pin her on the sofa. Erna let out a surprised squeal. The light poured over them and their pale skin shone bright.\u201cBjorn, the curtains.\u201d Erna gasped.\u201cNo.\u201dBjorn dug into her deeply. She couldn\u2019t continue pleading any more and nearly forgot all about being exposed. Her breath was suffocated by the sense of Bjorn being inside her, all of Bjorn being inside her, it was almost too much.\u201cYou feel so good.\u201d Bjorn said.Erna\u2019s eyes, which had been clouded by the sensation, went wide as he whispered the dirty words into her ear.\u201cHow does it feel for you?\u201d Bjorn asked, as he slowly moved his waist rhythmically.\u201cSmooth\u2026soft.\u201d Were the only words Erna could think of.Bjorn smiled and as Erna tried to look away, he cradled her chin with a firm hand, holding her head in place. The muddy sound filled the air with its lewd chorus.\u201cYou feel so good, it\u2019s making me crazy.\u201d Bjorn said.He spat the last words out with an effort, not able to hold back any more. He let Erna go and rolled off to sit lazily on the sofa. Erna was in shock. She sat up and spread her trembling legs to see the bruising on the thighs.\u201cOh, Bjorn,\u201d she covered her face as the tears started to appear.Bjorn simply giggled at her crying. It would seem that his chaste ladies\u2019 values were being shattered. Having sex in full view of the bright sun. Hopefully she won\u2019t be scared in the future.He stood and his shadow cast over her. He realised she had a pretty good voice for calling out during sex, perhaps that\u2019s why her chattering never bothered him during the act. Her voice was so clear and soft.He leant down and picked up her gown and draped it over the arm of the chair. As much as he found her talking exciting, the next time and from now he had no time for idle chatter. He looked out of the porthole.Beyond the curtains that Erna couldn\u2019t close, the sea sparkled like sapphires under the bright light of the sun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A soft roll of laughter from beside her drew her attention to Bjorn, her husband.He was sitting at the head of the bed looking down at her. His tousled hair shone like thin threads of gold and so did his face, which still had the lingering smile.She grabbed the feather pillow and looked up at her husband. Bjorn was not very diligent, but he was very thorough in his responsibilities as a husband. Even if she begged because she could not go on, he would not stop until his greed was satisfied. Erna genuinely couldn\u2019t recall what happened at the end of the last time.Erna wished she had learned from Mrs Pegg. She brooded over her poor choice of teacher, but the regret was pointless, she made her choice and had to stick with it.She looked up at the clock and it told her that most of the day was done already. She regretted that she had missed the Dolphins, the sea they were in must be long gone by now. She felt like she will be spending the rest of the day in bed.\u201cIs it much longer to Lars?\u201d Embarrassed by the silence in the room, she mustered up the courage to speak. Bjorn closed the book he was reading and snuggled down next to Erna, resting his head on an arm.\u201cAbout three days,\u201d he said. \u201cWe started here and moved all the way down to here.\u201d He moved a hand to the hem of the blanket and pulled it down. \u201cWe are here now,\u201d his long index finger started to travel down to her chest and made a few little circles.\u00a0 \u201cJust a little further and we will dock in Lars.\u201d His finger continued its journey south. \u201cThen we get on another boat\u2026\u201d\u201cS-stop. It\u2019s okay if we don\u2019t talk any more.\u201d Erna said, grabbing his hand as he reached her naval.Bjorn stared at her as if he didn\u2019t understand what she was saying, but remained relatively carefree.\u201cBut you were curious.\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain it this way.\u201d Erna said.\u201cWhy?\u201d Bjorn smiled leisurely, as if he didn\u2019t care about his wife\u2019s input. \u201cI like this map.\u201dJust as Erna was lost with what to say, a knock came at the door and she felt relief wash over her.\u201cYour Highness, the delegation has sent an update to the planned schedule, I know its rude, but they require you to review it urgently.\u201d\u201cFine,\u201d Bjorn said after grouping Erna briefly. \u201cCome in.\u201dBjorn sat up, he was wearing a loose nightgown, Erna was completely naked. The door opened and Erna hurriedly pulled the blankets over her, she could have fainted from embarrassment. She was so ashamed she couldn\u2019t breath properly. Bjorn accepted the report as if nothing was amiss.Erna barely poked her blushing face out from under the blankets once the maid had left.\u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d Bjorn asked casually.\u201cI hate you.\u201d Erna said, her eyes speaking fire.\u201cHate what?\u201d Bjorn asked as he sifted through the documents brought by the maid.\u201cSomeone entering the room while I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\u201cErna, everyone knows what we\u2019re doing here. Would you like tea together?\u201d He turned from the door and asked, before he went through.\u201cYes,\u201d Erna said like a pouting child about to throw a tantrum. \u201cJust give me a minute to get dressed.\u201dIt hurt her pride a little, to be treated like an idiot, or an impudent girl, but she just couldn\u2019t go wondering around in just her nightie.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll wait for my quiet wife.\u201d Bjorn said, sarcastically.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Before entering the solarium, where tea had been prepared, Erna tidied away all her clothes. It took her a little while longer to find a dress she liked and thanks to Lisa\u2019s deft skills, her hair was in a perfect little braid.\u201cLisa, I\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are pretty, your highness.\u201d Lisa answered before the questions was even asked. \u201cYou\u2019re so very pretty, so don\u2019t you worry.\u201d She opened the door and gently pushed Erna out.Erna light footed over to the tea table and did her best to try and push down the embarrassment before she reached the tea table.Bjorn looked up from the report he was reading and a smile beamed at her. He pointed to the chair opposite him and went back to examining the papers.Erna sat and pressed out the ruffles of her dress as a maid slipped in from the edge of the room and poured her tea. She smelled faintly of bergamot. It was the scent that reminded Erna of Bjorn.\u201cThese came for you, your Highness.\u201d The maid said as she set a small tray of letters on the edge of the tea table. \u201cThey need replies as soon as you can.\u201dWatching Bjorn play the role of Grand Duke made Erna excited to play her role of the Grand Duchess. She was eager to show her princely side.\u201cYes, I will review them, Thank you.\u201d Erna smiled.She didn\u2019t have Mrs Fitz to hold her hand and provide experience guidance, so she would have to handle this invites on her own. Mrs Fitz had told her, before they left on the cruise, that if Erna had any doubts, she should turn to the eldest maid, Karen.Karen was the maid that served her tea and presented her with the invites. If Erna had left it to her, their marriage would be over by the time they finished the cruise. She had over heard the maid talk about how she wanted Erna\u2019s marriage to be over before they had kids, so that it would be easier for Bjorn to get back with Gladys.Erna went through the invites with straight back and high neck, as if rising above the gossip the maids liked to wallow in. She felt Bjorn look at her from time to time and she wanted to present herself as dignified and regal. She was the Grand Duchess after all.It was hopeless though. Erna couldn\u2019t figure out which invites to accept and which ones to reject. She recognised a few names that sided with Gladys, but there was four she couldn\u2019t not recall memories of.\u201cBjorn.\u201d Erna cautiously called over the tea table, adjusting the red ribbon in her hair.\u201cYes?\u201d His gaze briefly passed over her.She felt hesitant in talking any further, like she was only being a nuisance, but she had committed now and he was waiting.\u201cDo you know the Hawkins?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThat ruled Hawkins out and both subsequent names.\u201cWhat about the Foresters?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d He sounded distant as he flipped the papers.\u201cIs it someone we want a relationship with?\u201dA pause, \u201cyes.\u201dErna adjusted the ribbon in her hair, then picked up the small hand bell on the table to call the maid over.\u201cPlease prepare my things, I want to write a reply.\u201dKaren soon prepared her stationary and a pen with a fresh pot of ink.Erna took up the pen with excitement, Bjorn was still fully engrossed in his paperwork and was still when Erna finished her responses to the invites.She was a little disappointed, but she knew this trip was more than just a honeymoon. She had to maintain self control, so that she didn\u2019t come of as some needy child with no discipline.She must remain calm and graceful, like a lady, in every situation.While reflecting on her grandmothers teachings, Bjorn had finished going through the paperwork and looked up at Erna. The atmosphere around the tea table became more intimate when the maid left with Erna\u2019s replies and Bjorn\u2019s signed documents.\u201cYour handwriting is so wonderful.\u201d Erna said, fiddling with a teacup. \u201cYou have big, pretty hands.\u201d Erna couldn\u2019t make eye contact because of how shy she suddenly felt.Bjorn was looking at Erna. His expression seemed to say \u2018what kind of pointless conversation are you trying to drag me into?\u2019 But he laughed.\u201cYou look pretty too, especially in the rain,\u201d he said. \u201c And especially with that ribbon you keep fiddling with.\u201dHe reached out and took Erna\u2019s hand, together they poured whiskey into the tea. The scent of it mixed with the sweetness of the tea and tickled the tip of Erna\u2019s nose.\u201cAh, this? Thank you.\u201d She said.The ribbon in question had grown nearly to twice its original size because Erna kept pulling at it at every opportunity.Bjorn had been trying to tease Erna a little, but her smile was genuine and warm. Seeing that smile and watching her play with ribbon some more, Bjorn couldn\u2019t help but let out a little peek of a laugh. A slightly softer sound than the barks that came before it.Erna spoked about the people she met on deck, a joke she had heard from the maids, even about the dinner menu. Her stories might not have been poetic, but her voice, mixed with the sweet smells of the tea turned the afternoon into something leisurely.Bjorn decided against going to bed and instead watched his wife. She was like a little song bird chirruping away. He appreciated her voice, the eyes that revelled in shy excitement and her delicate hands still playing with the ribbon, which was as red as her rosy cheeks.\u201cBjorn\u2026\u201d Erna cautiously called his name.Bjorn simply nodded, lost in her wide blue eyes that took him in. They trembled slightly, as she considered what she was going to say. When he smiled, Erna blushed furiously and she smiled back at him with pure admiration.When he saw he had caused her to blush and smile in such a cute way, he realised something.This woman, its her,He loved everything about her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They looked at each other in amazement.\u201cOh my god, she actually showed up.\u201d They whispered to each other.Sending the invite had been nothing but a provocative prank. The Viscountess, who had sent the invite, wanted to remind the country bumpkin that Princess Gladys still existed and she had their full support. No one thought the Grand Duchess would attend a tea party held by a close relative of Bjorn\u2019s first wife.While the guests whispered to each other behind their fans, Erna Dniester glided into the room wearing a long, beautiful gown and hat stuffed with ostrich feathers. Who would have though the second wife of Bjorn would come out looking so beautiful and elegant. Not at all like the vulgar woman rumours pictured her to be.\u201cDoes she often pretend to be a lady?\u201d\u201cIt seems the Prince is showering his wife with expensive gifts, I wonder how long that will go on for.\u201d\u201cI guess she really doesn\u2019t know.\u201d Viscountess Forester said.Gladys looked at Erna with pity, mixed with a strange sense of humiliation. It will be Bjorn who will be embarrassed because his wife doesn\u2019t know the familial ties. Gladys had been at the tea party for awhile now and was starting to feel the heat.\u201cSorry, it was just supposed to be a little prank.\u201d\u201cNo, its fine, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Gladys said and slowly rose from her seat to approach the Grand Duchess. Erna\u2019s disgrace was also Bjorn\u2019s. She couldn\u2019t just sit by and do nothing.\u201cWelcome, your Highness, Grand Duchess. I\u2019m was hoping I would get to see you at least once.\u201d A bright smile appeared on Gladys\u2019 face, as if she could bring herself to actually welcome the unwanted woman from the bottom of her heart.They sat together and tea was presented to Erna. The noble woman started to chat amongst themselves, as if carrying on a conversation from earlier.\u201cHow is Count Lehman? He has been entombed for a long time.\u201d One lady was saying in a tone louder than was necessary.\u201cHe should be healthy enough soon. Though, I am worried because he is so old now.\u201d Another replied.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is need to worry, I hear was looking for a third wife, not too long ago.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dThe corners of Viscount Foresters mouth twitched slightly as she did her best to not laugh. While enjoying the fragrant tea, the spiteful chatter continued. From Count Lehman, to the troubled child of the Heinz family, graceful cynicism lingered in their voices as they diligently mentioned names they would never normally care about.Erna simply raised the lukewarm cup of tea to her lips and sipped. Only now was her thoughts organised. The Viscount Forester was a maternal relative of Princess Gladys and it would appear the two are very close.The invite that had been sent to her was never meant as an expression of goodwill. She had gleefully replied and made a fool of herself by coming. All because she relied on a single answer from her husband.She couldn\u2019t turn away from them now, it would only open her up to more ridicule. She would have to endure this cushion of thorns.\u201cHer highness, the Grand Duchess, is not very talkative.\u201d Gladys said.Erna placed down the cup of tea she had barely taken a sip of. Even thought she didn\u2019t give any sign of a special order, the other ladies stopped talking.\u201cAre you bored of the tea party?\u201d Gladys casually moved to sit next to Erna.\u201cNo, its just\u2026unfamiliar.\u201d\u201cAh yes, that\u2019s right, you said you were from the country.\u201d Gladys smiled as if to say she understood. \u201cStill, you have good taste. The hat is very pretty. It suits you well.\u201d\u201cOh, well, thank you.\u201d\u201cI think you should cut down on the decorations a bit, Bjorn\u2019s taste is more simple and elegant.\u201dGladys looked up at a waiting servant, who hurried over and poured out a fresh cup for her and then retreated to his post.Bjorn hates me so much he would torture me with this choice.\u00a0Gladys thought, as she supped at the fresh brew. That conclusion, the only one that made sense to her, made her miserable. She wanted so desperately to help him, but only seemed to be pushing him further away.\u201cYou need to take good care of him.\u201dGladys faced Erna, who was blushing, kept her neck straight. It might have been because of her small stature, or her appearance, but she looked like a young girl, rather than a mature woman. The authoritative air of a Princess of a country was now where to be found.\u201cFrom our divorce, to our lost child\u2026he has many wounds. So, Grand Duchess, please take good care of him.\u201d Gladys looked almost regal in the bright light of the mid morning sun. She was like a beautiful saint from an old painting. Her platinum blonde hair, which was like Bjorn\u2019s and her arrogant yet graceful smile overwhelmed Erna, who felt shabby sat next to her.\u201cAnd if I could give you one last piece of advice,\u201d Gladys said, holding up her tea cup. \u201cBe careful not to make this mistake in the future. We will be in Lars soon, so you can\u2019t be so carefree. Today, fortunately, I was here to get you out of trouble, but it wont always be possible.\u201dGladys stood up and looked down at Erna. She only had to endure that stare, but she couldn\u2019t find the words to say. Gladys politely said goodbye and moved away.\u201cHave a pleasant honeymoon, Grand Duchess.\u201d Gladys said as she went.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The tea party ended ahead of schedule as Gladys complained of a headache and left. Erna didn\u2019t notice, but Gladys glared at her as she left, like Erna was responsible for ruining the party.Erna stumbled down the narrow corridors and cursed the open ocean, where she could only see the vast, flat horizon where ever she looked. She bumped into Bjorn and the delegation as she entered the first class cabins. He turned and looked at her, they all did, she could feel their judgement.\u201cDid you enjoy the tea party?\u201d Bjorn asked.\u201cYes, it was the Viscountess Forester\u2019s tea party.\u201d\u201cForester?\u201d Bjorn questioned.There;s no way you didn\u2019t know.\u00a0Erna thought.Erna\u2019s eyes went stern. Her resentment toward her husband for sending her that awful tea party with those awful people, transformed into bewilderment.You heard me clearly and you answered.\u00a0Her shock was absolute.\u201cErna,\u201d Bjorn said her name as if sighing and stepped closer to her. His eyes were on hers and he bowed his head deeply, it no longer contained warmth. \u201cBefore accepting the invitations, you should really speak to Karen first.\u201dIt was a soft tone, but she could still catch the thorns laced within the words. It was scolding. Erna parted her lips in a moment of sadness and resentment, but she could not readily refute him.She was reminded of Bjorn, how he had been so nonchalant, but Erna had been so enraptured by their time together. He looked at her with kind eyes, like she was her lover.It was so exciting for her, especially when there eyes met across the table. She felt so pretty when those moments came. She didn\u2019t know how many times she had adjusted and fiddled with her bow.But he didn\u2019t.Realising that made Erna\u2019s heart sting. To him, with his wife sat opposite him, Bjorn was completely indifferent, to the point where he slipped into the room and threw out an answer to a question he did not hear.\u201cYes,\u201d Erna said, not being able to find the courage to confront him.She could not call him out in front of the delegation. He was their prince first and his wife second. They looked to him for leadership and despite it being their honeymoon, she could not discredit her husband in front of everyone.\u201cI\u2019m sorry Bjorn, I will be more careful in future.\u201d Erna held her trembling hands together as she apologised quietly.Only then did Bjorn giver her a smile. It was mix of a laugh of embarrassment and pity, much like what Gladys had done earlier.\u201cYour Highness.\u201dThe minister, who had been watching them, urged with polite impatience. Bjorn nodded his head and straightened.\u201cGo and get some rest, I\u2019ll be back for dinner.\u201d He whispered affectionately, like her lover again and then turned back to the envoy.Erna couldn\u2019t move, frozen to the spot until her husband disappeared round the corner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 58": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe sea was lost in the deep dark of the night. White foam scattered past the ship as waves crashed against the hull. The noise of it felt like a dreary note of despair, a noise that wasn\u2019t present during the day, like the light muted it.There was also the sound of a wrapper being opened and the lip smack of someone chewing on chocolate. Erna ate the chocolate she had been given how ever many days ago, she lost count.She looked out into the darkness as she ate. The cold bit at her cheeks and knuckles of the hand that held firm to the railing, but she didn\u2019t feel it.It was just past midnight when Erna decided to step out from the cabin to get some fresh air. It had been a pleasant enough evening, thanks to Bjorn\u2019s return, but for some reason she just couldn\u2019t get to sleep.Was she angry? She was too sad to be that.So maybe it was sadness? That too didn\u2019t feel appropriate.What ever it was, it felt like a sluggishness that wouldn\u2019t shake. A lethargy that sleep would not fix. So Erna came out onto the deck with a bag of chocolates in her hand. Lisa told Erna that when you\u2019re feeling depressed, you should eat something sweet.Lisa had been shocked to hear of the relationship between Viscountess Forester and Princess Gladys. Her reaction was so sudden that even the head maid Karen flinched. Lisa was the only person on her side on this whole ship.Erna felt so lonely when she realised that. She had already prepared herself for the unwelcoming role of the Grand Duchess, but even her own husband didn\u2019t seem to be on her side and that made her feel cold.Is he really a poisonous mushroom?While she chewed on the question, staring out into the endless darkness of the night sea, she popped another piece of chocolate into her mouth and chewed on that instead.The images of Bjorn Dniester formed in the shapeless dark. Emerging one by one;The trouble maker,problematic princeflirt,prodigal son,bad guy.The Bjorn Erna knew was nothing like any of those things. Sure, he could be a little ill-willed at times, but he was never anything like his reputation. Some said he should have taken after his father, but he could never be like that, he could never be like that.But what if her judgement is wrong?Erna looked up at the blanket of stars that filled the sky. Each time she blinked at them, her vision became a little blurrier.Even though she doesn\u2019t know the world, she still knows much.People often said that when they were talking about her mother, Annette Baden.She is naive enough to trust a man like that? She\u2019s not very smart.They always said stuff like that, after she got with Walter Hardy. The poor woman who only found herself in the situation because she was so naive. Foolish Annette Baden.As she lay on her sick bed, withering away day by day, the whispers only grew in intensity. It was at a time in the Baden mansion where the situation was only growing worse and there were fewer servants to help out.Erna would sometimes sneak into the pantry to rummage around for cookies, she would hear what little staff there was talking to each other. She was young at the time, but she was intuitive enough to understand why her mother was in a sick bed, it was the man who hurt her\u2026..his father.Hiding in the dark pantry with a half eaten cookie, Erna heard all the whispers and gossip. The memory of her mother, who eventually passed, shone in the stars. The Grandmother and Grandfather, who wept until they were out of breath and the father that left the funeral after only a brief visit, also shone in those stars.My dear Erna, please go out and be happy, for your mothers sake.\u00a0Baroness Baden had told her.There was no denying it, Erna knew that her Grandmother and Grandfather saw her as a replacement for their lost daughter. She felt like she owed it to them, as well as her mother, to live a happy life in her memory.Erna\u2019s vision was rudely interrupted by the smoke that lazily drifted out from the chimney stacks of the boat.A red rose from Bjorn. A shed tear from her Grandmother. The second wedding of Prince Bjorn, who stirred up the whole country with his actions. She had no way of making anything happen. When that fact engraved itself clearly on her mind, the tumult of her mind eased.After catching her breath and quieting her mind, Erna looked ahead, to the front of the boat. Her tousled brown hair billowed in the wind with the hem of her coat.She still wanted to believe in Bjorn. The one who had offered his hand every time she was in trouble. Those hard eyes that contained warmth for her and a smile that felt like love. She wanted to trust her own judgement, rather than the horrible rumours.Amor FatiTo love her fate..Erna resolutely ate the last of the chocolate. It was so sweet that she was starting to get a little sick from it. She did as Lisa had suggested and she was feeling much better.It was an overly big fate Erna had put herself on. She was the one who put herself on this path, not anyone else, so she had to take responsibility for where she found herself. There was no point fighting against it, or hiding from it like a coward. Even if it meant swallowing a poisonous mushroom, Erna had an obligation to survive and be happy.Folding up the paper bag carefully and deliberately, she stuffed it into the pocket of her coat and pulled out a handkerchief to wipe her hands. She turned away from the sea and felt fresh determination.Be strong, meErna stepped away from the railing and headed back to her cabin. With each step she repeated the mantra and felt it pump strength into her.The next morning, the boat arrived at its destinations, Lars, their first honeymoon destination, the home of Princess Gladys.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Bjorn finished up by adjusting the sash and the emblem draped over his shoulder. Satisfied, an attended came over and gave him his gloves and formal sword.Bjorn turned away from the mirror as he put on his gloves. He raised the sword and checked it for marks. There was no trace of the problem child any more. He was a dignified figure in a crisp black uniform, blue belt and dazzling golden ornamentation.\u201cWould you really mind going alone, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant asked.Bjorn had announced that he would be meeting the King of Lars alone. He was not to be accompanied by the Grand Duchess, or any of the delegation. Everyone was nervous, but Bjorn was calm and focused.\u201cAre you afraid the Prince of Lechen is going to get whipped by the King of Lars?\u201d\u201cYou highness, whipped!?\u201d\u201cIt might happen, which is why its best I go alone. Less embarrassment.\u201d Bjorn grinned as he strode across the bedroom with wide, graceful strides. The attendant just looked at him with wide eyed worry.After disembarking from the boat and then taking a day to rest, they had been in the city for three days before they were finally able to meet with the King. They were staying at the Manster Palace, the guest house of the Lars Royal Family.\u201cBjorn,\u201d Erna greeted Bjorn as he came into the drawing room.She had been sitting in a chair and stood up abruptly when he came into the room. She looked like she was seeing Bjorn off to battle.\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d Erna asked.\u201cIf it\u2019s not, will you accompany me?\u201d\u201cYou only need to ask.\u201d Even though he had been joking, Erna\u2019s response was flat and serious. The ribbon in her hair swayed slightly.From the moment they stepped from the ship, Erna had showed a lot of determination to fulfil her role as the Grand Duchess. How is this? And how about that? She would diligently babbled about the things she thought a Grand Duchess should be.He said she was being absurd, but somehow, that only made her double her efforts and Bjorn found that increasingly cute. In the evenings he found he had to kiss her more than usual, because even in bed, she would not stop talking about doing her duty.\u201cLate,\u201d he gently stroked his wife\u2019s blushed cheek. \u201cIf I get beaten up, its all on you to avenge me.\u201dErna blinked at him, her eyes going wide. \u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re making another joke. A bad one.\u201dBjorn giggled nonchalantly. Erna let out a small sigh and looked at her husband. He was an enigma in many ways, but one thing was certain: He loved making fun of his wife.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my dear,\u201d a long finger stoked her chin. \u201cI fight to win and don\u2019t stop until I do.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t joke like that, I\u2019m really worried.When his gloved hand stroked her lip, she shuddered and pushed his hand away. She looked like someone who had been caught doing something they shouldn\u2019t. That made her so much more adorable.\u201cIts because of me, isn\u2019t it,\u201d Erna said looking away in embarrassment. \u201cIt\u2019s because I married you, so the relationship between Lechen and Lars \u2026\u201d\u201cErna,\u201d his smile faded. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with the relationship between Lechen and Lars, nothing in the past or future is going to change that.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Bjorn was convinced. He considered the risks and knew that the alliance between Lechen and Lars must remain strong, it was to the benefit of both countries and Bjorn was determined to keep it that way.Bjorn had considered this very carefully and had made up his mind long before the honeymoon was planned. He wished he didn\u2019t have to stop in Lars at all, but it was unavoidable, but it was fortunate that he only needed to deal with the King and be on their way as soon as possible.Erna was lost in thought for a moment, but she eventually nodded and let go of Bjorn\u2019s hand. She was not convinced, her eyes still showed worry and guilt.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be of any help.\u201d\u201cYou could help by letting me slip in from the back.\u201d Bjorn said quietly.\u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d\u00a0Erna glared at him in shock, surprise and disbelief. She looked around for anyone that might have heard, they were alone.Bjorn found it amusing. Even after the first time he tried to turn her over, she declared that she was a lady, not an animal. She was worth the trouble of having to sooth her through most of the night, even when she finally relented, she was not happy about the position. It gave him a little sadistic pleasure looking at her swaying beneath him.After giving her a passionate kiss on the cheek, Bjorn headed out of the room. Erna followed him and saw him off. She saw him off every morning and greeted him every time he came home, it was part of her wifely duties and that of a Grand Duchess.\u201cHey, Bjorn,\u201d Erna called after him, just as he was about to close the carriage door. \u201cWill you be coming back late?\u201d\u201cMaybe.\u201d\u201cCan we still have dinner together?\u201d Erna gave him her best puppy eyes. There was a moments pause as they looked at each other, a battle of wills sparking between them. Then Bjorn surrendered and nodded. Erna smiled brightly.Erna waved a hand with a flutter as the carriage pulled away, like petals caught on the wind. Bjorn laughed, it was a soft laugh with a little warmth added to it, it was something different from his usual faded smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cCongratulations on your marriage,\u201d the king of Lars said, though he never meant it.\u201cThank you, your majesty,\u201d Bjorn replied, playing along.The two played their parts expertly, like actors performing a well rehearsed play. Their conversations flowed as naturally as a fresh water stream. The ministers who stood outside the door, trying to listen in, trembled nervously.\u201cAlthough it comes too late, I must say that I am grateful of the proposal you sent to me, with Princess Gladys compliments. I regret that my will gad already been pulled me along another course, I will remember that consideration for a long time to come.\u201d Bjorn wanted to get that out the way at the start, in the hopes that it would make things a little less awkward between them.Arthur Hartford\u2019s eyes creased as he took in the words. He felt he was being provoked by the Prince, who always wore a smile like he had some deep plot going on. His eyes never gave away his intentions, they were always so cold and calculating.Did you really think you could use your daughter to meddle in the internal affairs of another country?\u00a0The King imagined Bjorn was actually saying.Of course, it was an outrageous response to an act of faith, a helping hand to get him back his crown. But it was also laced with warning that he should not forget his tresspass.\u201cAs will I,\u201d Arthur said out loud, with a laugh in his tone.The King had expected Bjorn to have become spiteful over the years, but he seemed like the same Bjorn he had met when he came over to Lars and used Gladys as a means to tighten a snare around Lars.\u201cIt was not my intention to meddle in the affairs of Lechen, I am well aware of the ferocity with which the Wolves of Lechen can operate. I was trying to offer a hand of peace, to atone for my foolish daughter.\u201d\u201cI trust in your sincerity, in return, I hope you understand Lechen\u2019s intent.\u201d Born said.\u201cBjorn,\u201d Arthur let out a long sigh. \u201cI fully understand your not wanting Gladys back, but you must put aside personal feelings and think rationally. Having you as the Crown Prince would be far more beneficial. You must see that.\u201d\u201cHaving Leonid ascend would be no different. We would still maintain a friendly relationship, Your Majesty. Considering my brother would be a far more considerate and kind king, do you not think the situation would be better with him?\u201d\u201cYou really have no attachments to the crown, do you?\u201d\u201cIf I wanted to hold onto it, I would never have let it go in the first place.\u201d Bjorn smiled.Arthur\u2019s gaze narrowed as he tried to read Bjorn, but his face was cold, hard and unmoving.Lechen\u2019s Mad Dog has returned. A name that had been given to Bjorn\u2019s great grandfather, Philip II, the conqueror from Lechen. A gnashing enemy to everyone but Lechen itself and his Wolf Banner is still widely talked about.Back then, one country would beat another, then later that country would beat the other back. That wasn\u2019t the case for Lechen, its Mad Dog bit out at everyone and no one was brave enough to try and muzzle Philip II. Lars was always the worst bitten.There was a brief moment when Lars was richer and more powerful than Lechen. During this time, the King of Lars led a cavalry charge right into the heart of Lechen and obtained the Mad Dogs\u2019 surrender. That was the pride of Lars.It did not last long, as the following year Philip II led a massive naval engagement that nearly destroyed the entire navy of three countries. It became the cornerstone victory for the young king, who was barely thirty years old. He went on to conquer the entire continent and unite the countries. Bringing peace.It was a close call, reluctance and resignation eventually gave way and the beaten looked upon it as an opportunity to prosper in their unity. The continent stabilised, industry blossomed and an era of prosperity began.Fortunately, the light of a brighter future also fell on the wolves of Dniester and their descendants took to the peace, unlike their ancestors. Worried that the wolves would bare their teeth again, a marriage was arranged between Bjorn and Gladys. At the time, Bjorn was being labelled as the second coming of the mad dog.The young Prince was proving to be very much like his great grandfather. A cold-hearted conqueror, another mad dog. He had not even started his era yet and already people were becoming afraid of what he was going to do. So when he gave up the crown, everyone but Lechen was relieved.Arthur nodded, shaking away the thoughts.\u201cIn all honesty, Bjorn, if I can not make you my son-in-law and put you on the throne, maybe it would be better if you were kept far away from positions of power.\u201d\u201cThen we have reached a consensus on what would be best for the both of us.\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cBest? Is this really what is best for you and Lechen?\u201dBjorn faced Arthur, who eyed him suspiciously. Bjorn smiled lightly and Arthur couldn\u2019t find a shred of regret in that smile. He did see the image of the Mad Dog in him though.\u201cIt has become a time of chaos, your majesty, a time where we need negotiators, not conquerors, to navigate the waves of tumult, to solidify the peace that is quickly spiralling out of control.\u201d\u201cAre you not confident that you can be a negotiator? Is that why you hand the crown off to your brother?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t feel I am capable, I understand the burden of the crown, a weight that can not be lifted once it has been put on.\u201d Bjorn looked out the window of the meeting room, thinking. \u201cI just feel my brother would be better suited to the role. I just can\u2019t justify dedicating my one and only life to values that are different to my own.\u201d\u201cWhat values would they be, for someone who set aside the crown with no regrets?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s, probably\u2026I guess, living life to its fullest, enjoying everything it has to offer?\u201dArthur looked at Bjorn gobsmacked. Was he really sitting before the King of another country and talking this nonsense? He burst out laughing.\u201cA very beautiful value indeed, and I don\u2019t suppose buying up Lars\u2019 bank is part of that?\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s an honour that your majesty would take an interest in my small investments.\u201d\u201cSmall investments?\u201d\u201cYes, didn\u2019t the Prince Alexander of Lars recently buy up the most famous horse from Lechen some time ago?\u201dThe audacity of comparing Prince Alexander\u2019s hobby of racehorses and Prince Bjorn\u2019s attempts at merging with the Bank of Lars made Arthur laugh again.\u201cLeonid is well aware of the price both countries have paid for our unity. So there is no need to be worried, Your Majesty. There is no need for arranged marriages, the alliance will remain as strong as ever, you have my promise on the honour of the Dniester\u2019s.\u201dSunlight broke through a gap in the clouds and shone through the windows into the meeting room. Arthur saw Bjorn knelt before him and let out a sigh. What a foolish woman his daughter had been, the regret deepened.\u201cCan I open the door now?\u201d Bjorn said motioning to the door behind him with a tilt of the head. \u201cThe ministers must be worried sick that you might have beaten me to death.\u201d\u201cWhy do you put up with the awful rumours? Is it because you like to be seen as a troublemaker?\u201d Arthur tried to make light conversation, in response to Bjorn\u2019s joke.\u201cI suppose you could say that, but please consider, I am on my honeymoon.\u201d Bjorn said with a smile.\u201cI understand your meaning, but why on Earth did you get married\u2026the way you did? What a wonderful woman your bride must be.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Karen let out a sigh as she rubbed the nape of her neck. The Grand Duchess had been sitting at her reading table, memorising the Lechen nobilities family tree for several hours now. Karen had to stand by her side and give guidance where asked.How do you pronounce this family name? What crest does that family belong to, and what does it all mean?\u201cI\u2019m sorry Karen, are you tired?\u201d The Grand Duchess said with a look of concern.\u201cNo, Your Highness.\u201d She gave a mechanical answer.Karen\u2019s disapproval was evident on her face though. It would seem that the youngest member of the Royal Family, Greta, who was only twelve, knew more about this than the Grand Duchess.\u201cI hear you and Bjorn have been together for a long time.\u201d Erna said, trying to make conversation.\u201cYes, Your Highness, I have been serving the Dniester since they were young boys.\u201d\u201cMrs Fitz says you are very loyal, I think so too.\u201dKaren narrowed her eyes at the Grand Duchess. \u201cYes, Your Highness, thank you.\u201d She got the impression the Grand Duchess was trying to say something.\u201cI understand that you are unhappy with me because you respect and love Bjorn, Karen.\u201d Erna still smiled softly. \u201cI know you think I am not good enough to be his wife.\u201d\u201cWhat, no Your Highness, I\u2026\u201d\u201cSo I will study hard and I will work very hard to be the Grand Duchess that people like you are not ashamed of. All I ask is that you help me. Please.\u201dKaren swallowed dryly and sighed. Her tummy was all twisted and she couldn\u2019t stand it. She swallowed again and could do nothing more than accept the order. Erna seemed satisfied and turned her attention back to the almanack.The barrage of questions didn\u2019t come to an end until the sun had fully set. Then, Erna went to get ready for dinner with her husband. Karen was standing outside, getting some fresh air when a message came for Erna. It said that Bjorn was going to be late and that Erna should eat without him.\u201cWhat if the marriage doesn\u2019t last a year?\u201d The maids had laughed together when they heard the news. Instead of scolding them, Karen joined in.\u201cTell her later.\u201d Karen said. \u201cThe Duchess is changing right now, it would be rude to disturb her.\u201dThe noise of the maids laughing and talking continued. They joked about the Grand Duchess\u2019 reaction, after spending all that time getting ready for nothing. Their laughter and gossip carried way into the night.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t that Jade?\u201d A maid said.They all turned around to look and saw the maid of honour of Princess Gladys running toward them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She stopped to enjoy the shade of a tree. Lisa was with her too.The conversation of the two maids drifted round to her. Words that pitied the Prince, who was forced to tour Lars all by himself, because the Princess was so useless, she couldn\u2019t be seen out in public.\u201cThose bastards.\u201d Lisa spat and as she went to march on the other maids, Erna grabbed her wrist to stop her. She shook her head at Lisa.The disrespect was incomprehensible, Lisa couldn\u2019t resist, something had to be done, but Erna looked at her with pitiful pleas.While the maids chattered away, Erna and Lisa stayed hidden behind the tree. While Lisa was boiling over with rage, Erna remained resolute.Lisa pouted as she looked down at the long evening shadows. Her mistress\u2019 honeymoon was passing them by and Lisa was getting upset by it. Erna had already been left alone for several days in the Palace, waiting for her husband with no clue as to when he would return. That was her daily routine and if she was lucky, Bjorn would join her for dinner.For the most part, Erna was alone for the whole day. There were no gatherings for her to attend and no meetings that she needed to attend. She would spend her days walking alone, or with Lisa. It was unfair that she would also have to put up with this disrespect.While Lisa thought about how much she hated the incomprehensible Prince, the other maids gathered together and headed off. Only then did Erna let go of her wrist.\u201cLook there,\u201d Erna whispered like she had some big secret to tell and pointed up into the tree.When Lisa looked, she lost all of her heated anger and smiled. There was a fat cheeked squirrel looking down at them from the branch of the tree they were stood under.\u201cYou have great eye sight.\u201d Lisa said.The Squirrel startled at Lisa and run up into the tree.Erna turned away from the forest of maple trees and faced Lisa. She could see the wide eyes reveal redness in them and Lisa realised Erna\u2019s hands were trembling slightly.There was so much Lisa wanted to say, but didn\u2019t have the words. Fortunately, Erna\u2019s lapse didn\u2019t last long and she moved on down the path covered in red leaves.They passed the bench where the gossiping maids had sat. Lisa briefly stared at the spot, before chasing after Erna without saying a word. The late autumn day was short and the sun was already casting long shadows. The sky has dyed a bloody red.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cThank you, I am in your debt today.\u201d Erna said, closing the book with a smile.\u201cNo, Your Highness, I\u2019m just doing my job,\u201d Karen said.It was a very bland and formal answer. It was definitely a very different attitude to when she spoke tot the much praised Princess Gladys, who was, without a doubt, the most perfect Princess.\u201cI will get your bath run, Your Highness.\u201d Karen left Erna alone.It had been ten days since they arrived in Lars and only three of those she actually got to have dinner with her husband. If you counted the one day of rest they had when they first arrived. Still, it was fortunate that today she knew Bjorn was going to be late home. She would not have to bare the embarrassment of looking shabby after wasting hours waiting for him to return.She casually flipped through her notebook, only half paying attention to what was written on the pages. Until she flipped past a diagram that showed the relation between Lars and Lechen\u2019s Royal Families. She had struggled to complete that with Karen\u2019s help. She tried her best, but the results were still disappointing.Excluding the nobles that were close to Gladys, there were only a few, shabby remaining names. Erna would probably never meet any of them as they had shut themselves away from the social network.Erna closed the book with a heavy sigh. She decided that she would write to her Grandmother, in the hopes of changing her mood, but maybe they weren\u2019t the best choice.Grandma, I am having a wonderful honeymoon. Love Erna.After that one sentence, Erna struggled to find anything else to write. She couldn\u2019t worry her Grandmother with the truth. She was also frustrated because she had no idea what a fun honeymoon was, so even a lie was out of her grasp.After a long while, Erna finally had a letter she thought her Grandmother would be happy to read. It was laced with several lies. She told her Grandmother that Bjorn was an affectionate and caring husband. She found Lars more accepting than she first thought and she is busy travelling all over a new world. Thinking of how her Grandmother would enjoy the letter, Erna smiled.By the time Erna sealed the letter, her bath was ready. She had no desire to around anyone, so bathed alone and refused the attendants.\u2018At least she knows her duties in the bedroom.\u2019The mocking birds words ran through Erna\u2019s head. She wasn\u2019t willing to reveal the shame of her husbands marks all over her body. Resolute in her thinking, Erna lowered herself into the steaming bath.\u2018When the Prince came on his honeymoon with Princess Gladys, they went every where together. Do you remember? The two of them were the brightest protagonists every where they went, they were a perfect match.\u2019Perhaps it was because of the splashing water, the memories came unbidden. Erna stared blankly at the sloshing water and when she closed her eyes tight, trying to wipe the memories away, they only came on stronger, pushing her to tears.There was a sudden knock at the door. Karen did not come into the bathroom, knowing that Erna wanted to be alone, but she brought good news, Bjorn had returned.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cEveryone, go away and rest.\u201dThe maids had followed him to the bathroom and looked at each other as if they didn\u2019t know what to do, like they had never gotten such an order before. They hesitated, but in the end, they all retired without question.When the door closed, Bjorn let himself fall onto his wife\u2019s bed. He never bothered taking off his jacket or shoes. She wasn\u2019t there, maybe she hadn\u2019t finished her bath yet.Bjorn spread out on the bed, facing the ceiling and let out a long sigh. It had been a long day that had started with luncheon with the foreign minister. Then it was off to speak to the acquisitions team at the bank. Then finally a little social visit with Alexander, Princess Gladys\u2019 second brother. A troublesome day that ended with a splendid finale.As with all three of her brothers, Alexander is very protective of his sister. Bjorn had been constantly pestered by Alexander when he first broke it off with Gladys. Endless threats and promises of retribution, but that was before he knew what Gladys had done. When he was finally told, he only pestered Bjorn more, this time with endless streams of apology.Even tonight, in his drunken, fugue state, he cried and cried on Bjorn\u2019s shoulder, cursing fate for driving the best couple in Lars and Lechen apart.Bjorn wanted to argue that it wasn\u2019t fate, but a practical joke played by his sister and her poet, but he decided against it. Mostly because he was waiting patiently for the gold coins the Prince was going to deposit. It was certainly a decent amount worth showing patience for.\u2018How come you married such a woman?\u2019A peek of a laugh came from Bjorn as he recalled Alexander\u2019s drunken words, uttered in clumsy sympathy.\u2018Such a woman\u2019It had become a derogatory term used to describe Erna. It was just funny to Bjorn. It was especially funny as it often came from the mouth\u2019s of those who supported a Princess who had a child with another man.\u2018Damn Hartford\u2019s\u2019\u00a0Bjorn cursed.He sighed and pulled the knot of his tie and tossed it some where.The royalty and nobles were anxious about the Grand Duchess of Lechen standing next to their perfect little flower of Lars. They will never see \u2018that kind of woman\u2019 defeat their Princess. Mostly because Bjorn would not let her be ridiculed like that.\u201cBjorn?\u201dBjorn looked over and saw, standing in the doorway, Erna. Fresh from the bath and wearing a bright smile, he thought she looked exceptionally bright today.Maids rushed in to draw the curtains and Bjorn motioned for Erna to sit next to him. She waited patiently for her maids in waiting to leave before entering, then hurried over to the bed.\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d Erna said, dejectedly.\u201cNo,\u201d Bjorn said with a laugh and grabbed Erna round the waist to pull her in close.As she collapsed into his arms and threw her arms around him, Bjorn could smell the sweet scent of her. It was soft scent that softened his heart, after spending all day hardening it against the attacks of the nobility.He pulled Erna in close and hugged her. Erna flinched and stiffened, but didn\u2019t put up any resistance.\u201cDid something happen?\u201d Erna asked. She had been studying him carefully.\u201cNo,\u201d Bjorn smiled. It wasn\u2019t a lie.The profits he gained for Lechen today were insurmountable. It was a day where nothing could go wrong, even when dealing with Gladys\u2019 brothers, who were sympathisers to him.\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d it was a response of distrust, but Erna nodded her head with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine too. I took a walk in the forest behind the palace, with Lisa. Karen helped me study Lars and Lechen\u2019s royal family and I wrote to my Grandmother.\u201d Erna chatted with a smile, like she was proud of her days routine. \u201cOh, and I tried the traditional cake of Lars at tea time, it was delicious. Almond cookies too. When I went for a walk, I packed it and shared with Lisa. I also have something to give the squi\u2026hmph.\u201dBjorn suddenly leaned in and kissed the lips he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off. Erna tried to turn over, but was still trapped in Bjorn\u2019s arms.As the two laid down on the bed, Bjorn\u2019s look changed. He looked down into Erna\u2019s big, questioning eyes for a moment, before pouring out a more passionate kiss, filled with all the answer he could muster from his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA madman,\u00a0that was Bjorn\u2019s self assessment. How else could he explain how he was running amok around women like he\u2019d never been around them before. He didn\u2019t mean to, it was just the way it worked out.He really wanted to know everything about this woman, ever since he first hugged Erna, no, it was when he first heard her sweet voice calling his name.Clearing his thoughts, he looked down at Erna, who was swaying beneath him, with a mixture of desire and adoration. He gripped her soft hair with a firm enough grip to stop her from moving her head from side to side, in an attempt to avoid his gaze. She looked at him with a puny little scream.\u201cYou are learning well, you should look at me,\u201d Bjorn said.Bjorn looked at her anguished face and pushed into her as hard as he could. Erna let out a whine and swayed as Bjorn wished. She was obviously excited, but he could feel her body tense every time he moved into her. Why?Bjorn\u2019s eye narrowed with scrutiny. His annoyance at his stiff wife grew as much as it did at not taking the time to get undressed fully. He let out a heavy sigh, bit her shoulder and then flipped Erna over.\u201cBjorn?\u201d Erna said.Erna fell face down onto the sheet and realised Bjorn\u2019s intentions as he moved behind her. She tried to push her body back up, but he had already pushed himself deep inside her. After a deep breath, Bjorn started to thrust with more vigour. It was pointless to try and do anything, when they were already acting like wild beasts.Each time Erna tried to push Bjorn back, he would dig deep inside her and a wash of sensation would cause her to moan. She couldn\u2019t hold back any-more, it felt so good and she liked it.The sound of wet flesh slapping against each other became a harmony with Erna\u2019s moaning and Bjorn\u2019s heavy breathing. This was getting too good and Bjorn lost himself in the feeling.Every time Erna pushed her waist up, he could feel her and satisfaction washed over him. Gladys, who had been lapping Erna in the social hierarchy, was forgotten and Bjorn simply took in the pale form of Erna writhing on the bed.\u201cMoan louder,\u201d Bjorn said.After pushing as deep as he possible could, Bjorn paused briefly and Erna became a panting mess under him. She vigorously shook her head, but resistance was ineffective.\u201cI, I can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to,\u201d Erna protested.\u201cYou must.\u201dBjorn held her waist firmly and leaned in to kiss the nape of her neck. He then begun thrusting again, faster than before. Erna\u2019s moan was loaded with wetness and was so much more erotic than before.\u201cYou\u2019re good at this Erna, do you not see?\u201dHe hugged her limp body and whispered into her ear like he was praising a child. She was still babbling, but he didn\u2019t mind it any more. He became possessed by desire. Even shaking as she did, trying to deny the urge, she tightened , which forced Bjorn to let out a low moan. He could not over come his excitement.At the moment it felt like Erna could no longer speak, she let out a shriek. Bjorn leaned down and bit into Erna\u2019s neck, this was not like when he was playing, he was literally trying to cut off the breath of his prey.Erna twisted away from the pain. The pain was somehow not the thing that was upsetting her. The feel of rough clothes on her back, the sound of ragged breath and the sensations in her body were all\u00a0 a kind of similar pain, and that betrayal of her own body was what upset her.She didn\u2019t have to be swayed by the gossip of others, she knew what this marriage would entail and what would happen. She was caught in Gladys\u2019 shadow on this honeymoon that wasn\u2019t really a honeymoon. She was invisible in Gladys\u2019 country.Erna closed her eyes and swallowed a cry as Bjorn bit into her. She was sure she was doing well, he said so. She looked back at her determination to become stronger and she was, she just wished it wasn\u2019t so bestial.Bjorn gave Erna a delicate kiss on the bite mark he just left and turned her back over. He looked down at her as he pulled off his tie.Erna\u2019s lips trembled as she tried to say something, but Bjorn thrust inside her again. Taking it all the way back to the tip and thrusting hard all the way down to the base.Erna twisted and writhed on the bed. She let out loud gasps and was almost sobbing. Her shoulders and chest shook each time Bjorn thrust himself inside. A satisfied smile spread across his face as he looked down at the Erna\u2019s beautiful, tiny frame.His straight flush.Enjoying her glistening form, he moved a hand to brush away the sweat soaked hair from her face. She squeezed her eyes closed tight in disgust. She could feel the heat begin to cool.\u201cErna.\u201dAs he brushed her cheek to try and sooth her, Erna trembled like she had a chill. When he saw the reluctance and the flinching away, he realised something and a name came to mind.An unwelcome name of a disgusting man.Walter Hardy.The man\u2019s face came to Bjorn\u2019s mind and overlapped with the memory of a young girl quivering in the rain under the old clock tower, body beaten and bruised at the touch of a disrespectful man.Bjorn looked at his frightened wife with a slightly dazed expression. He felt renewed contempt for Walter Hardy and shame crept in at his own behaviour toward Erna.\u201cI-its all right, I d like it, it\u2019s just a little\u2026\u201dUnable to find the right words, Erna reached out a hand and cupped Bjorn\u2019s cheek. Her hand looked so small against his face.The fear had risen in her after feeling Bjorn\u2019s arousal and the smell of alcohol on his breath. She knew she did not have to fear the man, because she knew very well that Bjorn would never hurt her, but all the same, the feelings came up unbidden.\u201cBjorn.\u201dErna plucked up a little more courage and stroked her fingers through his fine, silky hair that tumbled between her fingers like fine sand. He just sat there and frowned at Erna. He did not try to stop her.\u201cJust, slow down a little. Can you do that, for me?\u201dBjorn looked at her blankly for a moment and let out a long sigh with a laugh. It was funny. This situation, this woman. Most of all, he didn\u2019t hate anything about it.Instead of answering, Bjorn wrapped Erna\u2019s hand around his cheek and kissed her wrist, where he felt her pulse beating.He found himself thinking about Walter Hardy and all the lecherous wretches back home. Clambering over themselves like wolves fighting over a helpless doe. They ranted and drooled over Erna, who had been thrust into the marriage market.\u201cThank you, Bjorn.\u201dErna put her hand on the back of his neck and pulled him in for a kiss. Bjorn lifted his head and Erna smiled.\u201cI\u2019m fine now, please continue.\u201dAs if to prove her resolve, Erna put strength into her arms and pulled Bjorn onto her. She whispered soft words of provocation. Bjorn was dazed for a moment, but then let out a hot sigh and laughed. It was like he was drunk without actually drinking.The whole affair, which had started in a hasty display of half adorned clothes, ended in an intimate atmosphere of red haze.Bjorn stayed inside Erna until they had both cooled and their breathing returned to normal. He even kissed he flushed face and stroked her wild hair. Every time he did, Erna would look away, avoiding eye contact. She was like a well behaved seductress, her ambivalence was both cheeky and cute.Bjorn got up from the bed and left Erna behind. Erna stuck like a viper and grabbed his arm. He turned to look at the tiny woman.\u201cDon\u2019t go, Bjorn, would you sleep here with me?\u201d Though her eyes were soft and pleading, her voice as strong and clear.\u201cRest, Erna,\u201d Bjorn said and gave Erna a kiss.\u201cCome on, lets rest together.\u201dNormally Erna would have left it at that, but she felt a stubbornness build inside her and she was showing no signs of backing down.\u201cErna, I\u2019m uncomfortable sleeping with someone else.\u201d Bjorn removed her hand from his wrist, but she only grabbed him by the hem of his shirt with both hands.\u201cMe too.\u201d\u201cThen you understand?\u201d\u201cYes, but we\u2019re a couple, shouldn\u2019t we do things together even if they\u2019re uncomfortable? They say that a marriage is a journey two people take together down a thorny path.\u201d\u201cWho says that nonsense?\u201d\u201cThe Archbishop did.\u201dIn that moment, Erna looked like she was going to cry. She was being persistent and clung to it. Bjorn forgot his irritation and smiled.\u201cErna, that\u2019s a plausible sophistry from a man that has never walked a thorny path his entire life.\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s married to God.\u201dEven though she was talking nonsense, Erna was as serious as ever. Bjorn wished he could lay a whole bush of thorns on the Archbishops bed and see what he made of it after that.\u201cLets try a little, please?\u201d\u201cWhy should I?\u201d\u201cBecause you are my husband,\u201d Erna said firmly.\u201cWhat does a husband mean to you?\u201d Bjorn\u2019s question contained doubts.\u201cIt means family, my lover, my closest friend. Its a lifelong companion that supports and loves, they provide dependence, love, hope.\u201d Erna said without hesitating.\u201cDid the Archbishop also say that?\u201d Bjorn made up his mind to dress the man in thorns.\u201cNo. That\u2019s my opinion.\u201d That clear answer quickly quashed the chance of war between religion and the royal family.After standing there for a long moment, looking up at the ceiling, Bjorn let out a long sigh. Erna flinched, expecting him to get angry, but she didn\u2019t let go of his shirt.\u201cSo, if we\u2019re planning on sleeping together, are you also planning on bathing together?\u201d\u201cYes?Ah\u2026\u201d Surprised, Erna let go of him. \u201cY-you can go now.\u201dBjorn just stood there and stared down at the young woman. It was because her eyes were filled with such innocence, but also something new, a strength that wasn\u2019t there before.Impulsively, he leaned down and hugged her. She hugged him back and then realised what he intended, but was too weak to fight his grasp. He lifted the woman like she was nothing and carried her off to the bathroom to run the bath.It was a deep autumn night when the thorny path began.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not one that he could remember, but the feeling of it remained as an after image. The feeling of warmth from a fireplace, or sunlight streaming in through a crack in the curtains. Or\u2026.feathers brushing his neck.The sensation of feathers was all too real and when Bjorn twisted his head to see what it was, he found Erna snuggled in close. Her breath blew across his neck and gave the tingling sensation.\u2018I will never make your bed uncomfortable.\u2019Erna had made that promise when they decided to walk the thorny road together. She curled up at the very end of the bed as they went to sleep, then, little by little, she edged her way closer, until she was right up against Bjorn.Bjorn carefully sat up and looked down at the resting angel. She looked so innocent in her slumber, like she knew nothing of the world\u2019s troubles, or her own. When did she put her nightgown back on? Even the ribbon was tied with a neat little bow.Confirming that he still had time to meet his morning schedule, Bjorn rested back against the headboard and closed his eyes. It was a little uncomfortable, but nowhere near as bad as he suspected.The first night he had a little difficulty, but that was mostly due to the unfamiliarity of it. As the nights went by, he found he was getting more and more comfortable with it and now, apparently, he was starting to have good dreams, even with Erna laid up against him.After a little time had passed, Bjorn opened his eyes again and looked down at Erna. She was still sleeping soundly. He took her all in, from the thin shadows of her eyelashes and the narrow shape of her delicate face and to the small hand rested on the pillow by her face.It was such a small looking hand. She was a petite woman, but he had never really stopped to properly study how small she really looked.A moment later, Bjorn could hear the maid dropping off the tea into the next room.\u201cErna,\u201d Bjorn spoke softly.Slowly, Erna opened her eyes and as she looked up at Bjorn, a welcome smile spread across her face. It was one of those moments that made walking the thorny path worth it.\u201cGood morning, Bjorn,\u201d she said softly.\u201cGood morning, Erna.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Lisa quietly closed the door to the suite and stomped her feet in joy. She didn\u2019t know how many times she pursed her lips to stop herself from calling.Two drinks!She felt like she wanted to shout to the whole world.\u201cLook, those who despise the Grand Duchess, two cups on the tray today. Two!\u201dLisa could barely contain her excitement as she raced away down the halls, looking for someone to share this news with.The first time she knew the two had woken together in the morning, was when the little serving bell had been rung. She went to the bedchamber, expecting to see the Grand Duchess, instead, it was Bjorn, sat up on the bed and half naked. Erna was still asleep beside him.When Lisa told the head maid that there would be two lots of tea prepared for the Grand Duchess\u2019 bedchamber, she was dumbfounded.Isn\u2019t it only natural for married couples to share the same bed?It seemed that this was a very special event, to have the Prince wake up in another\u2019s bed. The servants that had been working for the Prince for a long time were the most shocked.\u201cGood morning Head Maid.\u201d Lisa said to Karen. Her enthusiasm stunned the head maid, who looked at her incredulously.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to take His Highness\u2019s\u00a0 tea this morning. I just brought his morning tea along with the Grand Duchess\u2019, to her bedroom.\u201d Lisa smiled. \u201cThe two of them have become so close, my heart has become so satisfied, is yours Head Maid?\u201d\u201cHow many times have I told you not to waste your energy on this?\u201d Karen replied to the young maids\u2019 provocation.Lisa only answered with a raised eyebrow and a formal curtsey, before turning from the head maid and scampering away with a frivolous gait.Karen\u2019s head throbbed at the thought of all the change the country bumpkin had brought to the Royal Family. She endured it only because her pride at serving the next king had collapsed. This was starting to feel like a bottomless pit of disgrace.She missed Princess Gladys with each passing day, especially because she had been denied everything she strived for. Maybe it was nostalgia for the glory days, but they won\u2019t come again.Karen let out a sigh as she continued with her duties. Just as she was checking over the breakfast menu, Princess Gladys\u2019 maid came knocking at the kitchen door. Jade came with a letter from the Princess.\u201cDid the Princess really give this order?\u201d Karen said, eyes wide after reading the letter.\u201cYes, of course, can\u2019t you see, it\u2019s Princess\u2019s handwriting.\u201d Jade said. \u201cThen, I will trust you and wait.\u201dKaren waited until Jade left the back door and could no longer be seen before turning her eyes to the letter again. She read it through again and again, committing it to memory before chucking it on the fire.She felt bad about being a spy, but if there was anything she could do to help the Princess, who still had feelings for the Prince, she would do much worse. She only needed to inform Gladys of the Grand Duchess\u2019 schedule and considering she spent all day behind the fence of the palace, it wasn\u2019t an overly difficult chore.Princess Gladys had given Karen orders to make sure the Grand Duchess would come out to the lake behind Manster Palace.While Karen was hovering about the place, the Grand Duke and Duchess came into the breakfast room.\u201cGood morning, Karen,\u201d Erna greeted the head maid with a smile.Karen looked at the pair with despair as they sat across from one other, talking in low tones. It was mostly Erna doing the talking, with Bjorn giving the odd, short answer. It might have been the amber autumn light, but the pair looked so warm and friendly together. Karen couldn\u2019t take her eyes off them.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*As the time for Bjorn to be heading off to his first rendezvous, the servants all gathered together to see the Prince off. Erna was there too, to wish her husband a pleasant day.\u201cWill you be returning late today?\u201d Erna said.She didn\u2019t want to seem like she was begging, or whining and spoke with a clear voice. She also didn\u2019t forget to smile.\u201cMaybe,\u201d Bjorn said.He went through the day\u2019s events in his head and dismissed Erna\u2019s expectations with a clear, concise answer.\u201cAh, I see,\u201d Erna mutteredShe played with the corsage brooch, tied to a lace shawl. Gladys\u2019 words springing to the forefront of her mind.Bjorn\u2019s tastes are in the simpler, more elegant things.Feeling intimidated, she looked up at the Prince, who was still standing beside her and sighed with a sullen face. Bjorn looked at her and their eyes locked. She felt compelled to speak.\u201cAm I too old fashioned, for liking pretty little things, like flowers and lace?\u201d She decided to be open and honest.\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cI want to know what you think.\u201d She fiddled with the flower petals.She prided herself in getting better, thanks to Mrs Fitz and she was willing to let go of her stubbornness. She felt like she was falling short still. Even to Erna, who was not familiar with these things, Gladys felt like the pinnacle of grace and sophistication.\u201cWhy are you asking me that?\u201d Bjorn frowned. \u201cIt might be out of fashion, but it\u2019s fine as long as you look pretty.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Erna\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cAm I really pretty?\u201d\u201cI feel like you\u2019re not asking because you didn\u2019t know, are you trying to be boastful?\u201d\u201cNo, not at all\u2026\u201d Erna didn\u2019t know how to explain.Erna never really knew what other people truly thought of her, outside the gossip circles. Her Grandmother had told her that only shallow and vulgar people put so much emphasis on their outward appearance and Erna had lived by that teaching.\u201cWell, each person has a different standard of beauty, so, I mean, in your eyes\u2026\u201d\u201cYour pretty.\u201d Bjorn said, cutting her off. \u201cAnyone with eyes would say the same thing, so you can wear whatever you please, my wife.\u201dHis tone was so casual, but a soft smile pulled at the corners of his lips. Erna tried to enforce the teaching about a lady always being graceful, but she had no chance at holding back the smile.Pretty.Her heart swelled like a balloon at that short, simple word and she felt like she was going to float away into the sky.\u201cThank you.\u201d Erna said. \u201cYou are really handsome too.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Bjorn replied.Before she could think of any way to respond, Bjorn climbed into the carriage. Erna waved a hand that had been rubbing her hot cheeks. When she saw Bjorn\u2019s grinning face look out to her, her heart pounded so loud, she was sure he could hear it.As the carriage departed, Erna was left to her feelings of happiness mixed with regret. An aftertaste to the sweet words.Pretty.Erna chewed on the word with every step. When she stood at her window and when Lisa brushed her hair. Just when she thought the day was going to be a lonely one with that word, a knock came to the door.It was Karen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How long do you think the Lechen delegation will remain in Lars?\u201dAll eyes turned toward Gladys as Prince Alexander\u2019s wife changed the topic. She was as calm as the weather, riding her beautiful white horse.\u201cI think maybe four days. Then Lars can be at peace again, to think they allowed Prince Bjorn to stay at Manster Palace, after what he did to Princess Gladys.\u201dGladys had been so gloomy of late and she seemed so fickle. Ever since her terrible ex-husband announced he would be coming to Lars on his honeymoon. People wondered how he could do such an insensitive thing.The hour was slowly approaching and Gladys was starting to worry. Had Jade failed to deliver the letter? or maybe Karen was not as loyal to her as she seemed. The composure Gladys had been fighting to maintain this entire time slowly started to crumble.She felt a twist in her stomach. She knew she shouldn\u2019t be spying on the Grand Duchess like this and to top it off, casting such a devious plot was beneath her, but she couldn\u2019t help what her heart felt.She had waited so patiently for Bjorn to come around and take her back, so when the news came that he would be marrying Erna, the news struck like lightning.She is a good woman and I will cherish her.\u00a0Bjorn had said about Erna.Why couldn\u2019t I be like her? Gladys thought. Bitter regret ate away at her like tiny biting flies with ravenous appetites. All of them bore the face of Erna Hardy. A poor country bumpkin with a shallow desire to be more than what she deserves.Gladys surveyed the promenade with cold eyes, looking for the girl. She felt like Erna had stained her heart, a heart that had never once hated, or was jealous of anyone. If Bjorn had intended to hurt his ex-wife, he had done a perfect job.\u201cOh, look, someone\u2019s coming, over there.\u201dGladys looked, doing her best to hide the strife within her and saw a wiry little woman with a hat filled with flowers and ribbons. Karen didn\u2019t betray after all.Gladys swallowed the feeling of relief and shame, for fear that they would rise too close to the surface and give her away. At the same time, the woman enjoying her walk looked right at Gladys.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cWhere\u2019s Erna?\u201d Bjorn asked.His eyes narrowed when he saw his wife\u2019s room empty and called for the maid. She came running and hid a smile under her rigid expression.\u201cHer Highness went for some fresh air, down by the lake, Your Highness,\u201d the maid said.\u201cLake?\u201d\u201cYes, the one behind the palace, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, of course.\u201dBjorn nodded as he remembered the lake road. He never went there himself, not something he found enjoyment in. Nothing out there to see except water, trees and squirrels.The story Erna told of the chattering squirrel came to mind and Bjorn let out a chuckle. He didn\u2019t like people who talked to much, especially when they spoke five times more during sex. But there was something about Erna that made him feel\u2026It was hard to put a name to, but he liked that she spoke of the acorns and nuts squirrels ate, while they were having sex.Thinking nothing more of it, Bjorn sat down in front of the desk that was under the window. The chief maid hurried in and stopped at a respectful distance.\u201cForgive me, your highness, I was not told you would be returning so soon and have nothing prepared.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Karen, I came home on a whim,\u201d Bjorn answered calmly. He held out a blue note placed in the middle of the desk.He had broken of negotiations that were supposed to have taken most of the afternoon. It was too nice a day to waste his time with someone that started the negotiations with such a lousy bluff. He decided that he needed a little more time to reflect on the situation, so things were as clear as the sky.\u201cKaren, what do you think of my wife?\u201dThe maid swallowed dryly. \u201cI, don\u2019t dare evaluate Her Highness.\u201dBjorn looked up from the piece of paper that had several different family names scrawled on it, linked by lines and dots.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cStrange,\u201d Bjorn said, placing the note paper back on the table, \u201cbecause it seems to me like you already have.\u201d He looked at Karen with cold eyes and a gentle smile.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The glass conservatory that looked out over the lake had been built for Princess Gladys. It was a present to demonstrate how the Royal couple loved their one and only princess.Erna listened politely and sipped tasteless tea as the Princess of Lars told her the history of the glass house. It was filled with rare flowers and butterflies. It was a house of eternal spring that made you forget what was going on outside.\u201cCome to think of it, it was here that I received the letter of proposal from Lechen. It was such a beautiful letter, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a letter more beautiful since. I\u2019m sure you understand, you must have received something similarly beautiful,\u201d Gladys said as she dainty sipped at her tea.Erna couldn\u2019t see any shadow on Gladys\u2019 smiling face, as if she was recalling fond memories. The other noble woman didn\u2019t seem to care. This was no coincidence, Erna was convinced and put down her tea cup.Karen had advised her that she should visit the lake, telling her how the calm water reflected the colours of the trees so beautifully and it was a placed loved by all of Lars\u2019 royal family. Since it was so close, she didn\u2019t need to make any arrangements or seek permission.The sudden kindness from the woman she knew disliked her made Erna very suspecious, but by the time she realised the plot, she was already looking at Lars\u2019 Princess.\u201cI received flowers, Princess, a very pretty rose,\u201d Erna said.She was very calm, mostly because she had been through this already. She was able to maintain a calmer demeanour than the messy tea party, now that she realised what was going to happen.\u201cReally? You got married and didn\u2019t even receive a proper marriage proposal? Bjorn, really. A man who writes such beautiful letters can be so heartless,\u201d the Princess let out a theatrical sigh.Erna no longer avoided those eyes. The moment Gladys invited Erna for tea, she suspected what the Princess was really doing. Instead of choosing to run away and hide, Erna decided to face such obvious malice.\u201cCan I show you my favourite flower?\u201d Gladys asked.Before Erna could respond, Gladys was already up. Erna noticed the Princess\u2019 intentions and calmly responded.\u201cPrincess Gladys, I think the only reason you called me out here is because you have something to tell me.\u201d Erna said flatly.The chatter of the other ladies stopped and they all looked at Erna and Gladys.\u201cWhat are you talking about, Grand Duchess, I just want to show you my favourite flowers. You seem like the type of person who really enjoys flowers,\u201d Gladys smiled brightly at Erna.Erna looked away and tried to gather her thoughts. The flower bed Gladys stood before was filled with Lilly of the Valley, it was the only flower in the bed.No.\u00a0Mrs. Fitz\u2019s voice came to mind, when Erna had asked the old woman if she could use the Lilly for a bouquet display.\u00a0Absolutely not.Erna never guessed why, at the time, but now that Gladys stood before a bed of the flower, she guessed the reason why.\u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful flower,\u201d Princess Gladys said, \u201cit is my favourite flower. I guess you like them too.\u201d Gladys pointed to Erna\u2019s hat, where there was a Lilly of the Valley. \u201cWe have so much in common. We both have the same taste in flowers and the same taste in men\u2026ah, that might have been a bit ride. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Gladys\u2019 voice became lower and her words more brutal. \u201cThere are pink Lillie\u2019s over here, in this next bed. It is a precious flower that is only found in Lars. You may take a few as a gift, if you like.\u201dGladys calmly led Erna around the rest of the greenhouse, on a meaningless tour, all the while talking none stop about flowers. Erna remained clam and followed.\u201cDo you know, Bjorn was such a beloved crown prince,\u201d Gladys turned on Erna suddenly. She was no longer smiling, \u201cand I want to return that crown to Bjorn.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There is no one in the world that is more deserving of the position and I know that is what the people of Lechen really want, because they still love him. They watch him and hate him for the things he is doing. That is the reason I so fervently wanted our reunion,\u201d Gladys said, with cold and contemplative eyes.\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d Erna asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe to help you understand what I am trying to achieve.\u201dBjorn would have known, if he had listened to her a little more, that she never cheated on him, not once. She had already been pregnant when they got married. They wouldn\u2019t be broken and they could still shine brightly.\u201cSince he has married again, all this is has been in vain, it would seem the Grand Duchess is able to give Bjorn something I never could.\u201d Gladys narrowed the distance to Erna with small, thoughtful steps. Erna\u2019s eyes were red and blinked rapidly. Finally, she felt like she had pulled herself out of the mud.\u201cI don\u2019t believe you would be using such a great man for something as trivial as paying off your families debts and raising your status.\u201d Gladys continued.I hope this woman gets hurt.\u00a0Gladys thought.Gladys hated herself for being so vindictive, but she wished it all the same. Even if she couldn\u2019t have the seat next to Bjorn again, at least don\u2019t let it be this woman.\u201cSo, lets just\u2026\u201d\u201cPrincess,\u201d Erna cut Gladys off, \u201cthere is something I want to ask you.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Gladys said, turning to face Erna.\u201cI know that a woman should not speak of any man but her husband,\u201d Erna looked directly at Gladys.Erna wasn\u2019t sure what was best, even after thinking on it for so long, but one thing was clear. As it was, she couldn\u2019t live in the shadow of the Princess for the rest of her life. Erna realised that much and somehow, in this unfamiliar world, she had to make a place for herself. She couldn\u2019t live as she had, when she dreamed of returning to Buford after only a year.\u201cI understand that Lechen and Lars hold different standards of etiquette, but I would like the Princess to follow after Lechen.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Gladys\u2019 eyes narrowed at Erna.\u201cAnd Princess, I didn\u2019t know Bjorn from when he was a Crown Prince. Buford is a pretty remote place, it takes awhile for news to come in. The first I saw of Bjorn was when I came in from the outside, that was my first impression of Bjorn and that will be the way I will always see him,\u201d Erna stood straight and calmed her disturbed breathing. \u201cI am well aware that I can not offer anything to my husband but family debt, but you see, Bjorn chose me, so I have to believe that there is something I can offer him, something that he sees. So I am going to do my best for the Bjorn I know.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really going to stand up to me now, Grand Duchess?\u201d\u201cNo, I am just speaking honestly, from the heart,\u201dErna looked away and Gladys followed her gaze to the flower bed. \u201cI appreciate your offer of the pink Lilies, but I too like the white ones,\u201d Erna could feel her glove hands getting cold, \u201cand I will not be reducing the ornamentation of my hat, because it\u2019s pretty enough as it is and Bjorn likes it,\u201d Erna\u2019s voice was as clear as the autumn sky.\u201cGrand Duchess,\u201d Gladys said, as Erna turned to leave, \u201cyou really think you know your husband? You have no idea what a cruel and terrible man Bjorn Dniester really is.\u201dGladys\u2019 perfectly pale face was flush red with anger. Erna turned to look at the Princess and cocked her head slightly as if considering, or thinking.\u201cIf Bjorn was such a cruel and terrible man, why do you want him back so bad, Princess?\u201dGladys had no reply and just stood there before Erna, as she bowed politely. Leaving Gladys standing alone in the greenhouse, biting her trembling lip. Flowers, ribbons and delicate lace decorations around the young woman\u2019s bodice swayed as she walked away, flapping like the wings of a butterfly, flying over the greenhouse.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cStop, stop the wagon.\u201d The shouts of a maid called out.As soon as the startled coachman stopped the carriage, Erna and her maid burst out and made their way to the neatly trimmed grass. The coachman didn\u2019t know what was going on, until Erna fell to her knees and started throwing up into the bushes.\u201cWater, fetch water,\u201d the maid called back to the coachman.He jumped down from the drivers seat with a canteen in hand. The maid snatched it up and gave it to Erna, who didn\u2019t get back to her feet until she had rinsed her mouth out several times.\u201cPlease drive carefully, I feel like I am on a cloud.\u201d Erna said, climbing back into the carriage.The coachman nodded obediently and took up the reigns again, urging the horses to go careful and slow back to the palace.Lisa propped a pillow for Erna and watched the scenery slowly drift by. As warmth came back to her hands and feet, Erna felt a little better.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Lisa asked.Ever since the she had tea with the Princess of Lars, Erna\u2019s complexion had looked pale and was deteriorating all the time.\u201cLisa, I\u2026I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Erna muttered.\u201cIt\u2019s this place, Your Highness, everyone in the royal family is crazy. If we go crazy, we can do it together, it\u2019ll be more pleasant that way.\u201d Lisa said, adding another cushion.Lisa didn\u2019t know what happened in the greenhouse, but Erna must have done the right thing. It\u2019s not wrong to bite back at the dogs of Lars, even as they try to nip at your ankles.\u201cI believe the head maid is conspiring with the Princess. If not, then this really is a messy coincidence,\u201d Lisa said, her eyes looking at Erna with ponderous thought. \u201cYou can\u2019t wait, you must let His Highness know right away.\u201d\u201cNo, Lisa,\u201d Erna said with a shake of her head, \u201cWhat happened at the lakeside must remain a secret, please,\u201d taking up Lisa\u2019s hand, Erna pleaded with her maid.\u201cAren\u2019t you upset?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m upset.\u201d\u201cThen why\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause I am so upset.\u201dLisa didn\u2019t understand, she thought that if you were upset and it was caused by someone else, then you have to fight, even if it meant rolling around in the mud, pulling your hair out, you have to fight and fight to win. But Lisa couldn\u2019t go against Erna, not when the woman looked at her with the big, blue eyes.\u201cThank you, Lisa.\u201dLisa returned Erna\u2019s smile and looked out the window. Not too far away she could see Manster Palace come into view. The Lars villa she so desperately wanted to get away from.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Karen paced about the palace halls with an unusually jittery gait. She was powerless to do anything to help the Princess and she couldn\u2019t stand still knowing the Grand Duchess would be back soon.Bjorn never raised his voice, not once, he didn\u2019t even show the slightest hint of anger and somehow, that made it worse.Bjorn had looked at her for so long, in absolute silence, until he touched Erna\u2019s notebook and suddenly Karen lost all composure and collapsed.Karen knew what was in that notebook, she had been by the Grand Duchess\u2019 side whenever she wrote in it, which is why she knew what Bjorn was pointing at.It was always difficult to conduct any social gatherings without the influence of Princess Gladys and the royal family as a whole. Their family was so interlaced within Lars, it was difficult not to create a few rifts between acquaintances. Karen had left out all those details, of course, because she wanted the Grand Duchess to be left outside, on her own.Bjorn picked up the notebook and flicked the pages casually, \u201cof these two, which one is better?\u201d he put it down again as if he had been considering the menu.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, your highness, I wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d Karen pleaded.Bjorn leaned forward over his desk and steepled his fingers before his chin. Unwilling to raise her head, Karen stared down at the floor.\u201cFetch me a cup of tea please,\u201d was all he said.They had been standing in the Grand Duchess\u2019 bedroom for a long time, she left without a word and when she got out into the hallway, she slumped onto the floor. She was numb and thought that if she was to ever be in that situation again, she would not be so lucky.Just as the sunlight started to turn red, the Grand Duchess returned. Hearing the horse hoofs, Karen ran to the front door. Erna looked at her as she climbed out of the carriage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The hope she had was quickly dispelled, she could instinctly tell what happened at the lake just by the way the Grand Duchess was presenting herself. She seemed confident, almost arrogant.Most people had written Erna off as a naive country bumpkin, but the more Karen got to know the Grand Duchess, the more she saw that was not true.\u201cWell, Your Highness, the Prince has returned.\u201d Karen said. She decided that it was best to play her role for now.Erna\u2019s eyes widened in surprise and she looked out the window, expecting it to be dark already, but it was not. Erna cleared her throat.\u201cBjorn?\u201d She said to herself.\u201cYes, Your Highness, he said he came home early due to schedule cancellation. Should I get dinner prepared for the both of you?\u201dErna didn\u2019t answer right away. She was overjoyed that Bjorn had come home already, but she was still feeling the effects of her tea with Gladys, she didn\u2019t know if she could handle food right now.\u201cYour Highness?\u201d Lisa said, behind Karen.\u201cYes.\u201d Erna snapped almost at the same time as Lisa spoke. \u201cPlease prepare dinner.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna\u2019s bedroom was empty. She said she was going to retire early, after dinner, but she was no where to be found. Bjorn looked about the room carefully and leaned on the back of the chair that had been nearly tucked under the writing desk. The note book still lay upon it.Foolish girl.Bjorn fingered through the pages of the notebook again and looked at the elegant scrawl. At the back, Erna had segregated the pages to show families she could be friends with and families she could not, based on their support of Princess Gladys. All the families were under Princess Gladys and on her side was written one simple little thing.\u201cThere is no place for me so long as Princess Gladys remains.\u201dBjorn understood Karen\u2019s influence on that one page alone. Erna, none the wiser, worked hard with a bright smile.Just as he was thinking about throwing the notebook into the fire, the bathroom door opened and Erna came out, looking more pale than at the dinner table.\u201cAre you sick?\u201d Bjorn asked her.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Erna said, approaching him.Her smile seemed to revive her a little, but when she saw Bjorn\u2019s hand resting on the notebook, her face became fierce, like an angry cat.\u201cWhy are you looking at that? It\u2019s private.\u201d Erna shouted, snatching up the notebook.Bjorn was faster and stood tall, holding the notebook high above his head. He skipped around the room out of Erna\u2019s reach.\u201cBjorn, this is not gentlemanly of you at all.\u201d Erna glared at him with eyes full of resentment.\u201cIt\u2019s not a secret diary, is it?\u201d\u201cNo, but its still mine. Its rude to read it without my permission.\u201d Erna pouted.Bjorn\u2019s lips tilted sharply up into a mischievous grin as he looked down at his wife, who looked dejected.\u201cYou\u2019re such a smart girl for coming up with such a clever little chart.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWho do you plan on socialising with, your maid? The Squirrels? What a mess.\u201d Bjorn laughed.Too late he realised he had gone to far when Erna went stiff and looked hurt.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you think, but I\u2026I tried really hard.\u201d Erna said, it sounded like she was close to tears.Erna clenched her fists and stepped away, toward the window. Bjorn sighed and placed the notebook back down on the desk.What a mess.The sarcastic remark scratched at her heart like shards of glass. It felt like her stomach was being stabbed again, just like at dinner, but she was able to force the food down. Although she threw it all up again just now.\u201cErna,\u201d Bjorn said softly.The voice calling her name did nothing to stir her from staring down at her feet, wringing the hem of her dress in balled up fists.Don\u2019t cry, she thought to herself,\u00a0keep your pride, don\u2019t cry.Her eyes were hot, but maybe because of her will, the tears did not come. At the moment she wanted to turn around, Bjorn\u2019s hands were already around her waist. She wanted to pull away, but Bjorn pulled her in close and comforted her with a hug.He sat her down in the chair of the writing desk and just as she was determined to stand back up again, she was surprised to see Bjorn grab another chair and sit down opposite her. He took off his jacket and undid his cuffs.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Erna said.\u201cTake this,\u201d Bjorn said.He offer Erna his fountain pen. Erna looked at it as if it was going to bite her and took her own pen from the writing desk. Bjorn opened up the notebook to the offending page and pointed.\u201cMove them,\u201d he said, pointing to a few names.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThese three families, move them across to your column.\u201dErna struck a line across the page. \u201cBut, the three families in question were considered to be the closest relatives of Princess Gladys, according to Karen.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cBut why?\u201d Erna said, fiddling with the pen, \u201cAre they people of character?\u201d\u201cAlmost, they are people who have already spent my money.\u201dAs always, there was something in Bjorn\u2019s response that caught Erna off guard, which he gave quietly.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna\u2019s new education went well into the night. When Bjorn pointed to a name, Erna moved it across and Bjorn went into deep explanation about the family, using concise words easy for Erna to understand.When Bjorn had finished and put down his pen, Erna closed the lid of the inkwell and looked at her new notes. It was a crazy mess of lines and small words, but it was looking a lot more well rounded. Erna had more than a few names in her column now.\u201cYou can learn the details from Karen, I\u2019ve already spoken with her,\u201d Bjorn said.It was something she wasn\u2019t sure about, but Erna nodded her head deeply. Before she knew it, her old wounds faded and she was filled with excitement. Her heart did not stop pounding easily.\u201cThank you,\u201d Erna said. She found it hard to lift her head again, to look at her husband, it wasn\u2019t like earlier, when she was filled with anger toward him for snooping through her things.\u201cI will work hard and do my best,\u201d said Erna shyly.\u201cThat\u2019s my Erna,\u201d Bjorn said as he brushed her cheek and gently raised her head, \u201cWhen you talk to someone, you should be looking at them.\u201dHis voice was cool and soft. It permeated an energy that warmed Erna and filled her with laughter.\u201cJust like your favourite saying, ladylike,\u201d Bjorn stated. His lips were bent into a cosy smile. Erna enjoyed this moment, seeing that smile on his face. Bjorn always wore a loaded smile, but this time, his smile was different.\u201cIs it better for you and Lechen if I remain quiet and doing nothing while we are in Lars?\u201d She placed her hand over Bjorn\u2019s, that was still on her cheek and he nodded. \u201cThen after, when we leave Lars for the other countries, I will work just as hard and do well. Is that alright?\u201d Bjorn nodded again, \u201care you going to be as busy?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cSo that we can actually do things together. It\u2019s my first time travelling any where in my life,\u201d Erna closed her eyes and smiled shyly.\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d\u201cWill you join me if I tell you?\u201d\u201cWe will see.\u201dIt was not a definitive answer, but Erna\u2019s face lit up with excitement.\u201cFirst, I just want to go for a walk with you. A street, or a park in a foreign country would be so wonderful.\u201dBjorn was a little relieved that this was the most exciting thing Erna could think of. He nodded and accepted.\u201cI would love to find someone where to eat together and drink tea, too, in a pretty place.\u201d\u201cIs that all?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The excitement on Erna\u2019s face paused for a second.\u201cIs that all you want to do?\u201d\u201cah\u2026and\u2026.and\u2026\u201d Erna struggled to think of something wild and exciting, \u201cLet\u2019s talk, a lot, intimately.\u201dBjorn didn\u2019t see the value in her thoughtful wishes, but he was willing to give in to them.\u00a0\u201cFine.\u201d He heaved a sigh and gently caressed Erna\u2019s cheek. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201dErna looked at him and her eyes lit up. Like a flower opening its petals, her grin brightened the room.Very pure\u2026and pleasing to the eye.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna\u2019s letter came along with the first snows.Receiving the letter from the maid, Baroness Baden hurriedly found her glasses and sat in the armchair in front of the fireplace. Mrs Greve, who received word of the letter\u2019s arrival, came into the drawing room also. She hobbled from the pain of arthritis in her leg.\u201cYou have no idea how warm my heart is at hearing Erna is doing so well,\u201d the Baroness said, handing the letter to Mrs Greve when she finished.The strange sense of incongruity was no longer present and the letter felt more Erna-like. It was more so when they had moved on from Lars. It was said that they would be moving on to yet another country by the year\u2019s end.\u201cMy lady, she really has fallen into her role as the Grand Duchess,\u201d Mrs Greve said, returning the letter.Erna talked about the strangeness of the world in her letters and Baroness Baden soaked up all the information as the maid poured her tea. That was a nice change that came with her Granddaughter being the Grand Duchess.Baroness Baden had refused the extra staff, but it was hard to refuse the stubbornness of the Royal Family. The repairs to the mansion, which had begun at the moment the marriage was announced, were already completed and the number of servants increased dramatically.Ralph Royce, who had been a coachman in name only, finally had a beautiful wagon with which to work his magic on.The mansion was turned from a run down, dusty house, to a beautiful country estate and it was all thanks to Erna.\u201cHer birthday is in a few days, will she be able to celebrate properly, in a foreign country?\u201d Mrs Greve said.\u201cErna now has the most reliable family in the world, she will have a very special twentieth birthday.\u201d\u201cI do hope so.\u201dThe two old ladies looked out the window, at the slowly falling snow. It was the same window they would look out of as Erna built the biggest snowman for her Grandmother and Grandfather.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He played the caring husband when he wanted to, but mostly he acted like he completely forgot his wife existed, just like today.\u201cThe Prince is such a g.o.o.d husband,\u201d Lisa said sarcastically.\u00a0She had gotten so used to saying it, she wasn\u2019t even aware she kept doing it. She figured there was no man alive that enjoyed the same freedom as Prince Bjorn.\u201cHuh, what did you say?\u201dErna was busy pouring over tourist brochures for the city they were in. She looked up briefly to give Lisa a smile. She did not look unfortunate, like a Grand Duchess that had to enjoy her honeymoon with her maid, because that\u2019s what she was right then.\u201cNothing,\u201d Lisa said looking at her feet.When the tea they ordered came, Erna put down the booklet. The hotel\u2019s tea room was famous for its fancy china and colourful confectionery and it was presented exactly how it was shown in the booklet.She had planned on having tea with Bjorn this morning, but last nights card game went far into the early hours of the morning and by the time the Grand Duke returned to his bedchamber, he was blind drunk and Erna was about to get up to get ready for breakfast.The guests who visited them were all high standing members of the Royal Family and long time friends of Bjorn\u2019s. They certainly visited with dignity, but that intention quickly vanished after dinner, when the port was pulled out along with a deck of cards.\u201cOh my, it looks so pretty, how can I be expected to eat it?\u201d Lisa said.\u00a0She should feel sad that Erna is having to have tea with her maid, rather than her husband, but the cakes made Lisa forget all about her feelings of annoyance at the Grand Duke.\u201cEat as much as you want,\u201d Erna said.Lisa paused, reaching for a brightly coloured lemon slice. Something in Erna\u2019s words felt threatening and Lisa was unsure if the Grand Duchess meant for Lisa to scoff down all the cakes, knowing what a sweet angel she was.All day that had been following Erna\u2019s plan as diligently as they could, spinning a web all across the city, stopping only to enjoy the little things she spotted on their meticulously planned out tour. She was so different to Bjorn, who was lazy and insensitive.\u201cIt\u2019s so good,\u201d Lisa said melting into her chair.The lemon slice melted in Lisa\u2019s mouth. Not like the dried out bricks she always had when she and Erna went to the department story tea room, when dropping off flowers.It was just last summer she was sipping tea over a dry slice, that was unlikely to be eaten. Now, in just two season\u2019s, she was in the most luxurious hotel, eating the most luxurious food.\u201cYour Highness, it really feels like we\u2019ve made our way up in the world.\u201dErna let out a delightful laugh. It was not such a loud laugh that made every eye in the tea room turn to look at her. The other visitors couldn\u2019t take their eyes off Erna because she looked so beautiful, not that Erna noticed.Alas, Lisa Brill\u2019s not so vain masterpiece, the Grand Duchess of Lechen.Erna kept offering Lisa the cakes on the little tray and Lisa scoffed every single one that was given. It seemed like Erna was trying to strengthen her will and she ate well.Lisa wondered why the Erna wanted to visit a place known as the Sewer Museum. She supposed it didn\u2019t matter, so long as the Grand Duchess enjoyed it. It might be because they were going to have to sail to get to the museum. Lisa thought about the look on Prince Bjorn\u2019s face when he finds out that his wife\u2019s itinerary ended with a visit to the sewers.\u201cYour Highness, why are those people standing in line like that?\u201d asked Lisa.\u00a0\u00a0There was a long line of people going past the display window of the tea room. It went all the way down the street and around the side of the large building.\u201cThey are going to climb to the top of the dome of that cathedral there,\u201dErna said, pointing.\u00a0The Cathedral stood diagonally from the hotel tea room and on its top was a large golden dome. Lisa could see tiny little dots walking around it.\u201cThe cathedral was built two hundred years ago and built by the queen when she was to get married to the prince of Lechen. It is said, if you go to the top with your loved one when the bell rings, that love will last forever. When the cathedral was built, the royal couple of Felia did the very same.\u201dErna spoke like she had lived in the city for years. She had studied up on Felia as soon as she found out she was going to be visiting on her honeymoon. It was also the biggest reason she was looking forward to coming here.\u201cOh, my, then you should be going with Prince Bjorn, not me.\u201dErna looked up at the dome and nodded. \u201cYes, I will.\u201d She had already made plans to do so, when they laid together in bed on the boat over to Felia.It would be her birthday in ten days and she didn\u2019t want her twentieth birthday to go unnoticed after getting marred to Prince Bjorn. He had agreed to climb the cathedral with her and Erna felt embarrassed after worrying so much about being rejected.It was hard to show joy at that moment, with Bjorn moving so roughly inside her. It was a romantic conversation shared with such a barbaric situation. Looking back on the last three months, Bjorn was always more willing to do things when asked during their love making.Should she remind him of his promise?After thinking about it for a moment, it was a promise made with sincerity, as they looked into each others eyes. He even gave her his sweetest smile. There is the chance that he could have forgotten his wife\u2019s birthday though.\u201cShall we go?\u201d Erna said, after examining the clean plates in front of them. Erna gave a smile that would light up the sewers of Felia.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna was coming. The sound of her footsteps alone would have been a gentle whisper, but she came with her maid. The busy pace went right up to the door.There was a gently knock at the same time as the door opening. She was such a strange and obstinate lady, who would enter without permission and display pointless manners when doing so.\u201cBjorn, I hope I\u2019m not disturbing you.\u201dErna spotted him sitting on the couch, in front of the fireplace, reading a magazine. He folded it up and looked at her. She was in a green velvet dress, with ribbons and frills. She looked like yet another gift box today.\u201cDid your guests leave on their own feet?\u201d Erna looked around the room slowly, asking the sharp question with a soft smile.\u201cWell, maybe.\u201d\u201cWhat a relief, I thought they might have stumbled out on all fours,\u201d she said sarcastically.Bjorn chuckled as he tossed the magazine on the table and moved his leg off the sofa, Erna quickly seized the free seat and sat down next to Bjorn.\u201cAh, Bjorn, I went on a boat trip today, through the sewer museum.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Bjorn couldn\u2019t believe what he just heard.\u201cThe sewage museum, you didn\u2019t know? I went there this afternoon, it was amazing. Did you know there is a huge network of big, long, complicated tunnels right under our feet? It was just like that novel I read, about the main guy escaping through the tunnels.\u201dWhile Bjorn was marvelling at the fact that someone thought it was a good idea to make a museum for such a thing, Erna continued to recite all the mysteries she had learned from her trip.\u201cI took a boat ride and the guide taught me how to find things that fell down drains.\u201d She seemed particularly proud of that.Bjorn was thankful that Felia\u2019s favoured son ambushed him last night. It was much better to handle Felia\u2019s drunken dogs than some boat trip through a sewer.\u201cAnd then you came back here, from the sewers?\u201d\u00a0Bjorn inched his way along the couch, opening the gap between them. His perfect little gift box, was a sewer adventurer. Erna watched him shift away and wrinkled her nose.\u201cWhat are you doing? Do you think I went swimming in the sewers or something? Is that what you think, you, the one who broke his promise and went off to get drunk and play cards?\u201dErna shifted along the sofa after Bjorn, closing the gap he had just created. Each time he moved, Erna would too, until she was practically sitting on his lap. Bjorn laughed as he let himself fall off the end of the couch, wrapping his hands around Erna\u2019s waist and dragging her with him. She still smelled of sweet flowers.\u201cYour hat looks sad,\u201d Bjorn said, removing her cumbersome hat and tossing it onto the table. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was meant for the sewers.\u201dHe removed her cape from around her shoulders and started rolling up her dress. Erna laid quietly on his body and gasped when she felt his hands on her garter belt.\u201cCan\u2019t you just look at me for a second?\u201d Erna said, grabbing his wrist, \u201cLisa worked really hard on this dress.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re prettiest when you\u2019re naked,\u201d Bjorn unwound the garter belt very carefully. Erna was not very appreciative of the compliment.\u201cOh my God, Bjorn, you say such insulting things, how would you feel if I said that to you?\u201d Erna fired him an angry glance.Erna regretted her words as Bjorn got half naked in an instant. He was grinning at her, as if this display was enough of an answer.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d Erna hurriedly placed her hand over her husband\u2019s slightly parted lips.\u00a0\u201cNo, Don\u2019t answer.\u201dBjorn kept quiet as she\u2019d hoped, but his silence was much filthier than the answer she\u2019d tried to block.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She woke, bleary eyed and saw Bjorn sat at the breakfast table, he looked like he was all ready to leave.\u201cOh, are you going hunting with the Princes of Felia today?\u201d Erna asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Bjorn said simply.\u201cOh, until tomorrow?\u201d\u201cYes, did I not tell you?\u201d\u201cNo, I thought that was another time.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Bjorn turned his gaze back to the newspaper.Reading while eating was one of Bjorn\u2019s many little habits that Erna was really starting to take a disliking to. Would it be so much to ask for a little face-to-face time with her husband?\u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d Erna asked, getting up and sitting at the table.\u201cHmm, tomorrow. The hunt finishes later today, so should be about lunchtime.\u201dErna took up a teacup, trying her best to not let it rattle with her shaking. Bjorn smiled at her, not noticing. It was such a warm smile and made her feel like they were real lovers.Most of the events Bjorn had gone to over the last two months had been purely publicity events, so Erna couldn\u2019t really complain and make a fuss, it wasn\u2019t like he had any control over them.Bjorn turned his attention back to the newspaper. He looked at Erna more and more often, and he would share more stories of his doings. This helped Erna in gaining confidence toward her husband.He\u2019s not forgotten.Her husbands schedule was always going to be complicated, fulfilling his role as the Grand Duke and Prince of Lechen, so there was no point in feeling disappointed. Erna decided to think on the day they would have together when he came back.Just then, a maid came into the room.\u201cYour Highness, an urgent telegram.\u201dErna set her tea cup down and placed her hand in her lap. She looked at Bjorn as he studied the details of the telegram. She looked Bjorn over, examining his hunting clothes for the first time. From his red jacket to polished black boots, Erna looked him over slowly. She stopped when she came to his hand, jotting something down on a piece of paper, which he then folded and handed to the maid.\u201cBjorn, there\u2019s something I want to get, a letter.\u201d\u201cLetter?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d the ribbons in her hair swayed gently with the motion of her head,\u00a0 \u201ctomorrow, would you write me a letter that I may cherish and keep?\u201d In her mind it felt like such a grand request, but saying it out loud made it feel quite petty and small.Bjorn looked at Erna for the longest time, well after the maid had left with his response to the telegram. He got up, straighten jacket and made to leave, all the while giving Erna a wide smile.\u201cBjorn, the letter\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you want something,\u201d Bjorn said, cutting Erna off, \u201cjust say it, that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d His tone was not harsh, or admonishing, but was stern enough to make Erna feel shame.\u201cBut, words and letters are different.\u201d Erna had to work up a lot of courage to speak back to him, who stopped at the door and turned to her with a sigh.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of sending a letter, when we see each other everyday? I will be back tomorrow, anything that could be said in a letter can be said then.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the\u2026\u201d\u201cI will be back tomorrow,\u201d he bent down and gave her a kiss.Erna felt like a child who had been denied a toy on their birthday. There was no displeasure in it, but she couldn\u2019t help but feel sad. She nodded and he smiled at her like a father to a daughter and left.Erna went out to see her husband off, as she always did and stood sentinel at the door until the carriage had gone out of sight.She pondered waving her hand, but quickly dismissed the thought.It was the last remnant of pride she had left.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The guns sent a pang of sudden noise and the hounds barked and yipped as they sprinted off into the woods. Bjorn and the two princes of Felia encouraged their horses to follow. Their hooves thundering on the dry grass field.They came to a stop as the track dove into a dark wood. The hounds gathered, constantly barking and yipping. In there centre was a freshly dead rabbit.A servant gathered the kill, wading through the puddle of basset hounds. The three Princes continued to follow the track into the woods, filling the winter bitten land with busy sounds, driving prey out into the open.\u201cI was going to come visit Schuber during the opening ceremony of the spring fair. I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am that you decided to come to Felia first,\u201d Maxim said, he was one of the Felia princes.\u201cSo am I. It\u2019s a pleasure to come and witness your sharpshooting skills,\u201d Bjorn said, with a polite smile.There had been a poor show of game so far, only two pheasants and three rabbits so far, but their shooting skills had been far above average.\u201cThe negotiations between our two countries for the issuance of bonds, is coming along nicely, when they told me that you were heading it, I just had to have you visit for a round of hunting.\u201d Prince Maxim said, as he looked up at the wolf and eagle banners.Although it was a slightly antagonistic relationship, calling each other mad dogs and bald eagles, the union between Lechen and Felia was like that of two allied nations rising up against a common foe. Such were the times, when great powers unite to keep in check the traditional powers and although it hurt his pride a little to admit, Felia needed Lechen\u2019s support to help them out of financial difficulties.\u201cThat\u2019s the job of the financial minister,\u201d Bjorn suddenly stood in his saddle, bringing the shotgun to bare. A pheasant broke cover, scared out by the noise of the oncoming hounds. It started climbing into the trees canopy, but Bjorn brought it down quickly and the hounds fell upon it. \u201cI\u2019m just here to enjoy my honeymoon.\u201dBjorn gave Maxim a smile as if nothing had happened. It was an extremely brazen display, even though he had to be aware of who was holding the money for the Lechen delegation.\u201cHowever, the Felia royal family announced that they would be forcibly converting interest rates on government bonds and implementing new taxes to impose on securities.\u201d That was the unfortunate thing about Bjorn, he wore his heart on his sleeve.The two princes of Felia exchanged glances and started to co-ordinate their opinions. Crown Prince Maxim was about to speak when the rush of the hounds scared something big out of the brush. A small deer bounded onto the track and looked at the hunters.The Crown Prince brought up his gun, but was stopped by his brother, who pointed to Bjorn, Maxim got the meaning and waited to let Bjorn take the first shot. There was no sound of a gunshot from him though. He was just staring down at the doe and showed no signs of going to shoot his prey.Moments later, a much larger deer came out onto the track. Maxim sent a questioning glance to Bjorn, who simply shook his head to dissuade the others. They took his meaning and didn\u2019t raise a single threat.The mother doe had clearly come looking for its wayward fawn. While they looked on in silence, the baby approached its mother, looking for comfort.While the doe escorted the fawn back into the forest, Bjorn simply watched them leave. At first, it seemed like he had shown mercy, but to those who knew the mad dog of Lechen well, it was a disconcerting look because you could never hope to guess what was going on behind those cold, calculating eyes.\u201cDo you want to catch it?\u201d Maxim asked.Bjorn smiled like the warm spring sun and the fear of those who saw deepened. What does a baby deer mean to him? Was it because it ran right out in front of them, or maybe because it lived in a forest that had been cut down?\u201cNo, don\u2019t touch it.\u201d Bjorn said, kicking off his horse and riding on.The two princes of Felia watched him go and gave each other disgruntled glances. Maxim ordered his steed to follow first, with neither of them able to come to any conclusion or idea what the mad dog of Lechen was about.Maxim really hated this mad dog, a perverted mad dog.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The snow had fallen non-stop since the morning and Erna had been out in it. She finally stopped for lunch after making five snowmen about the front garden.She inspected her dainty snowmen lined up along the driveway, expressionless. She had made them, one by one, while she was waiting for Bjorn to return.Erna was still excited about her birthday, which no one else knew about, but she was starting to feel a little lonely. Bjorn will be back soon and even though she never got her letter, she was excited to climb up to the cathedral dome together. But even that was looking a lot less likely.The snow fell and everything became a colourless silhouette. Perhaps to reflect the disappearance of her lingering feelings of sadness. She had become so used to being disappointed and let down, she no longer felt anything. Not even her red hands felt cold any more.Bjorn wasn\u2019t coming.She was alone.After calmly accepting that fact, Erna turned to head back into the palace. It was probably best she didn\u2019t tell anyone today was her 20th\u00a0birthday, then they wouldn\u2019t be able to find it funny that she spent it by herself.It came to the late afternoon when Erna decided to go out. The servants of her entourage, who had been expecting a day in the city, had become lazy in their unexpected day of rest, so Erna was able to sneak out, passing by them like smoke.Erna slipped through the main gate of the guest-house and looked up at the brilliant white, cloudy sky. Last year she celebrated her birthday with her family, around a crackling fire. The table was full of delicious food and realised only now how happy she had been.Rubbing the tears from her reddened eyes, Erna began walking down the snow covered road.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was the one thing Mrs Fitz specifically told her not to forget. The Grand Duchess birthday. She stared at the calendar, she couldn\u2019t figure out what to do and where to start.The Grand Duchess never showed any signs and not once mentioned her upcoming special day. All she had done all day was wonder around the garden, making small snowmen.Karen went to find the Grand Duchess personal maid, Lisa, who was found in the maids rest room. She was braiding a maids hair, with a long line of maids waiting their turn.\u201cLisa, did you know?\u201d\u201cKnow what?\u201d Lisa said, not looking up.So no one knew? Unbelievable.\u201cRight, everyone, follow me,\u201d Karen clapped her hands and put on a stern voice, \u201cCome on, everyone, we have a lot of work to get done.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Well, this is the end of the line,Erna thought to herself as she stared out at the city, there really was no where one could look, without seeing men and women smiling at each other frivolously. Touching each other without hesitation.Erna stood up straight, as her eyes darting around the snowy landscape, her face became stern at the shameful situation. It was just then that the bells rand and all the couples started kissing. Erna didn\u2019t know where to look, even as she couldn\u2019t turn her gaze away, she rolled her eyes here and there. The debauchery of the city seemed to know no bounds, as the bells rang out as if heralding the end of the world.\u201cOh, my god\u2026\u201d Erna said.The bells stopped ringing and were replaced by the laughter of all the couples she shared the balcony with. She had hoped the dome would be empty when the snow came, but it was still quite crowded and although she was hoping to spend her birthday by herself, she felt more alone than ever.She wanted to leave immediately, but the climb up had taken a lot out of her. She didn\u2019t think it would be a good idea to climb down all those stairs with wobbly legs. She might lose her footing and end her life right there, at 20. Although she wanted to die in that moment, she didn\u2019t mean it literally.Deciding to sit at on the bench in the corner, out the way, she would only hang around long enough to allow the strength to return to her legs.New lovers came out onto the dome, to replace those who were filtering out. They meandered to the edge and looked out over the view. Erna decided against going to the railing and put her butt back on the seat.When she realised there were so many close lovers, she could feel sadness overcome her heart. There was nothing to be upset about, her birthday would come again, they can\u2019t all be special days, but Bjorn had forgotten.No, she couldn\u2019t be sure that Bjorn ever remembered in the first place. Even though he looked right into her eyes, she couldn\u2019t be sure he was actually seeing her. Erna realised she needed to admit to herself that she didn\u2019t mean anything to him.How can they be lovers, who would share moments like this together, if Bjorn didn\u2019t think anything of her?Erna let out a long sigh and held her self straight, as if trying to support her collapsing heart. Straightening out the hem of the dress and adjusting the sit of the heat on her head, it was all for nothing as a gust of wind made her efforts in vain.Resigned, Erna put her hands in her muff and tried to huddle away from the biting wind. She had picked out her clothes specifically for this trip, but it never seemed to feel like enough.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with her, she\u2019s all alone.\u201dErna frowned and turned to look at the couples, cluttering the view with their immoral presence, snuggling close to each other. With a click of her tongue and a sigh, she waited for the bells to ring at the end of the world.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cI think she went out, what should we do now?\u201d The maids were saying.Lisa, who had been bright faced, burst into tears. There was no holding them back. The rest of the maids were also concerned, even those who disapproved of the Grand Duchess.Lisa found the Grand Duchess\u2019 chambers empty, when she went to apologise for forgetting her birthday.\u00a0 They searched all over the palace and she was no where to be found. The Grand Duchess had ran away from home.\u201cThink carefully, where could the Grand Duchess have gone?\u201d Karen asked Lisa.\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cHow can you, of all people, the one person that followed Her Highness every where she goes, not remember her very birthday?\u201d Karen scolded.She was choked up and her anger soared, but Karen couldn\u2019t have a go at Lisa too much, she had forgotten too. It was easy to blame the young maid, she was the Grand Duchess\u2019 personal maid.\u201cFor now, we will split up and search every where we can. Group one will search beyond the palace wall, in the forest and group two will head to the city and \u2026\u201d\u201cHead maid, head maid,\u201d a young girl came rushing in, \u201cits, its the Prince, he\u2019s back and looking for Her Highness.\u201dThe situation Karen had feared the most was coming to pass. She rushed the search parties on and, with Lisa, went to meet the Prince, being carried their on very shaky legs.The pair arrived outside the Princes chambers and Karen took a moment to catch her breath. Lisa was still crying, but Karen didn\u2019t have time to wait for her to compose herself. She knocked on the door.\u201cCome in,\u201d came the Princes voice.Karen wiped her clammy hands dry several times before she was able to turn the door knob. Bjorn was stood on the balcony, arms folded, looking down at the five snowmen Erna had made for him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry Your Highness, its all my fault,\u201d said Karen, bowing deeply, \u201cHer Highness disappeared, but don\u2019t worry, every member of staff is out looking for her.\u201d\u201cMy wife, disappeared?\u201d Bjorn frowned at the two maids, \u201cwhy?\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna looked at the door, as if willing it to not be true. It was because her hands were numb with cold, she couldn\u2019t operate the door handle properly, there was no way it could be locked, with her trapped on the roof.She grabbed the cold metal of the handle again, with a firm grip and nothing. The door was as it was before, locked tight. She could hear the padlock knock against the door as she jiggled the handle.\u201cHello,\u201d she called out, \u201cis anyone there? Please, open the door.\u201d She banged on the door and shouted. Could this day really get any worse? \u201cIs anyone there? Please, open the door, I\u2019m still out here.\u201dHer voice echoed out into the darkness and her only reply was the silence of the cathedral. Erna looked about her with a blank expression on her pale face.The night sky was covered in dark clouds, blotting out the stars and moon. The dome was completely deserted. Laughter came to Erna then, she felt like crying, but she laughed instead. She had wished for a birthday to remember and it came true, though not in the way she expected.\u201cI should have gone down earlier.\u201d She looked up at the sky in dismay, always she thought of staying just a little longer and now it was too late.Giving up on the door, Erna headed over to the railings and looked down on the city. The height made her dizzy.\u201cThere are still people up here, please, can someone open the door?\u201d She shouted down to the streets, hoping that someone passing by might hear her.She gave up after awhile and slumped down on the ground. The dirt and grime left be a hundred footprints stained her dress, but she didn\u2019t care any more. She had no energy left.She looked up at the sky, as she wept for her fate and through her blurred vision, white points danced in the sky toward her. It wasn\u2019t until one landed on her cheek that she realised it was snowing. Just her luck.\u201cIts fine, I didn\u2019t want to see you at all anyway.\u201d Erna said aloud, thinking that she was going to be stuck there until the morning. If she survived till morning. The sudden thought made her stomach give way.Erna looked around with the eyes of a lost child and raised her soiled hands to her face. Her sobs were muffled by the snow drift.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 69": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI\u2019ll go by my self.\u201dAt that order, the hurried footsteps on Bjorn\u2019s heels stopped dead in the dark cathedral. All eyes were focused on him.\u201cYour Highness, please, its dark and the stairs are very steep,\u201d they protested.\u201cNo,\u201d Bjorn snapped.The prince approached the cathedrals curator with an outstretched hand. He bowed his head instinctively, then realised what the Prince was after and handed over the keys and lamp.\u201cI\u2019m going alone, wait here.\u201dHe strode over to the door that led to the stairs up. As he sighed, his breath came out as a thick white cloud that quickly evaporated.\u201cHaish, all this because I didn\u2019t celebrate your birthday.\u201dWhen he first heard of his wife running away, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh, it seemed to absurd, so childish. She was a Princess of a country, in a foreign land, it really was absurd. If she wanted too cause such a stir, she could have at least warned him first.About the time amusement gave way to frustration and anger, he remembered the one present his wife had asked for, when they were sat drinking tea just across the road from here. She wanted to go up to the dome, like all the other lovers and kiss when the bells rang.He couldn\u2019t believe he recalled that request and in such detail. He remembered her flush cheeks, the shy whisper of her voice as she spoke and the bright smile on her face. That was when he got the idea that she must have come to the cathedral.It was already several hours after the attraction had closed, but Bjorn got a strong feeling in his gut that was where he needed to go. When he got there and found no sign of Erna, he felt the need to check the dome.It didn\u2019t make sense for anyone to still be up there, especially on this snowy evening, but he had to check, he needed to be sure.He got to about halfway when his steady breath faltered and he started panting. Resting for a second, he laughed to himself. Couples that rise to the top will be together forever, Erna had said. Stupid churches and their stupid superstitions, it was like that all over the land.\u201cDamn Felia, damn stairs, damn\u2026\u201d He was about to say Erna, but stopped himself.With each step he climbed, he became more and more exhausted. His thighs burned and his breath was hot. It was getting harder to believe that Erna had made this climb herself.\u00a0 With her dainty feet and heavy lace dress. If it had been any women other than Erna, they would probably given up by now.Bjorn struggled up the last flight of stairs, his mind scattered everywhere, trying not to think of the burning in his thighs and the tightness growing in his calf\u2019s. He pushed himself to take one more step, until he was finally standing in front of the door.Pausing for just a moment to catch his breath and control his breathing, Bjorn undid the lock and pushed open the iron doors that groaned as they moved.He stepped beyond the door and out into a completely different world. It was so quiet and serene, you could hear the snowflakes land. It was cosy and cold and felt unrealistic.Bjorn paced around the balcony until he found a bench nestled behind a gargoyle. Upon the bench was a small bundled wrapped up in a blue cape and shivering.\u201cErna?\u201d The name came out like a soft sigh, Bjorn felt like it was a sin to disturb the calm up here.\u201cBjorn?\u201d A pale face peered out from the cape, bright red eyes and soaked cheeks considered him.He was furious, but he was also relieved. He hated being here as much as he was grateful that he was here. While his emotions fluttered wildly like the snowdrift caught in an up draft, Erna came out of her cocoon.\u201cIs it you, really?\u201d Erna said. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dQuestions and resentment filled Erna\u2019s eyes like the tears did. Bjorn stared down at her, taking her in and she filled his cold grey eyes. He stepped toward her, slowly.\u201cI came to wish twenty year old Erna a happy birthday.\u201d An annoying young woman, who he didn\u2019t understand in the slightest, who was always so pitiful and yet so pretty, his wife and he really had no idea what to do with her.\u201cHappy Birthday, Erna\u201dThe complement came out as a soft whisper and fell like graupel on her.Soft and cold, like winter snow.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*A sharp cry broke the serene calmness of the rooftop. Erna scrambled off the bench and backed away from Bjorn, leaving dainty footprints in the snow.\u201cHow can you say such a thing, why are you like this? How ridiculous, what the hell am I to you anyway?\u201d She shouted. \u201cWhy did you have to remember?\u201dShe rather he had forgotten.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d She hoped to never see him again.\u201cWhy did you come all the way up here!? Why!?\u201d She had swallowed the poison mushroom and this is what she got for it.Her emotions exploded through the cracks in her heart and assaulted him. Resentment, hatred. The fact she could name these emotions, even though she lived her life to do no harm to others, made Erna hurt even more.She loved him, even though she knew he didn\u2019t have the same feelings for her. Erna realised the moment she saw Bjorn before her. She should hate him, but she couldn\u2019t help but see her salvation. He was like the noble Prince in all the fairy tales, coming to the Princesses aide in her most dire situation. With just one kiss, all her sorrow and pain will melt away.She knew it wasn\u2019t like that, her life was no fairy tale and even though she was hurting, she wanted it so badly to be like that with him. She hated herself more for that.\u201cGo,\u201d she shouted, \u201cleave me alone, I hate you and I never want to see you again.\u201dAt that, Bjorn approached her and Erna felt his cold hand on her cheek, wiping away the tears and even though it was cold, she suddenly felt very warm.Bjorn forced her head around, even though she fought him as much as she could. He had pulled out a handkerchief and began drying her tears. Unable to fight him any more, she let go and cried for a long time. She couldn\u2019t help think how ugly and red her face must be.\u201cI waited,\u201d Erna said after a long time, \u201cI waited for a long time, in case you came.\u201dThat\u2019s why she had stayed, what had held her back. She was able to admit that to herself and she opened up.\u201cWhy can\u2019t you think of me as a special person?\u201d She did her best to blink away the tears, \u201ceven if its not love, can you maybe give me a little\u2026\u201djust a little bit of your heart?She couldn\u2019t bring herself to say the words out loud, she still clung to a fraction of her pride. Bjorn was looking down at her, both his hands wrapped around her cheeks and the bell begun to chime.She looked up at him again, who had been looking away at the sound of the bell. If you climb the stairs together then your love will last forever. That\u2019s what the bells seemed to be saying. Just as all the countless couples who had been teasing her heart all day had done.\u201cCan\u2019t you even kiss me?\u201d Erna sniffed.She wanted to forget for a moment what she looked like and hoped something could be salvaged. When the second bell chimed, Bjorn broke into laughter.\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want to see me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut why?\u201d\u201cKissing is done with your eyes closed.\u201dErna becmae urgent, the bells would not ring forever and she was suddenly filled with anxious, nervous desperation.Bjorn leaned in close and at that moment, when the feeling of anxiety climaxed at the realisation of what he was doing, the second his lips touched her a heat rose that melted away the cold and the snow.Erna closed her eyes and leaned into the kiss. It felt like the bells were blessing their love and like the fairy tale kisses, she felt all the anger and hatred melt into love and passion. A kiss that promised an eternity of happiness.Her heart fluttered like butterflies, even though she was still filled with bottomless misery. She knew this was just an illusion, there would be something else later, but for now, she was willing to believe it was real enough.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*It was slow going down the stairs. Bjorn could hurry down them pretty quickly, but he had to go slow for Erna\u2019s sake. He had taken the lead with the lamp in his hand and habitually looked back to make sure Erna wasn\u2019t struggling. It was when the end was near that they could hear voices.Erna was hesitant and when Bjorn realised it was because of the commotion she cause, he laughed. Even after causing such a scene, she dared act all demure. Bjorn wrapped his coat around his wife and gave her a hug.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to see me, I suggest you close your eyes,\u201d Bjorn said softly, \u201cyou\u2019re good at that.\u201d He added the joke to try and calm her flusteringBjorn move forward and opened the door. Erna stopped resisting and buried her face in his arm, as if trying to hide from the people outside.\u201cI can\u2019t believe she was really up there,\u201d exclaimed the curator.Wading through the crowd of people that had gathered to watch the spectacle, Bjorn strode past them all and to the waiting carriage. He bundled Erna inside and climbed in after. He held her tight for nearly the entire journey.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayErna was laid up in bed, with a cold, for three days. When she was able to get up, she could only make it as far as the breakfast table.\u201cFortunately, you have not turned into the Ghost of the Grand Duchess of Lechen,\u201d Bjorn joked.Erna adjusted her clothes, making a fuss. She wore a shawl over her dress, which was embroidered with various flowers, her favourite being on a brooch. Her hair was loosely braided and tied up with a pink ribbon.She spoke less than usual at the breakfast table, much to the delight of Bjorn, and although she found the energy to come to the breakfast table, she was still emaciated. She emptied her plate of food step by step.\u201cWill you be late again today?\u201d She asked.Putting down the tea cup she had been holding for a long while, she looked at her husband, who had finished his breakfast awhile ago. Bjorn was about to stand up, but decided to sit back down and leaned back.\u201cWhat are you thinking, Erna?\u201d He asked calmly.\u201cWhy? Even if I were to tell you, you\u2019d just forget.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Bjorn paused as he noticed the smile on Erna\u2019s face, \u201cyou think now\u2019s the time to be joking on such matters?\u201d\u201cOf course, I would say it more elegantly, but\u2026\u201d\u201cBut?\u201d\u201cBut I only feel good when you listen to me.\u201dErna\u2019s expression was serious. It seemed like Bjorn was in the dog house after the way he treated Erna, it was not an unfair assessment.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you say it in an elegant way?\u201dBjorn winked at the attendant who came into the room to announce the readiness of his carriage. This was one appointment he could not skip, though the Bald Eagle that was Felia\u2019s noble lineage was quick tempered, they would not go to war because they were kept waiting for a couple minutes.\u201cI\u2019ll listen to you Erna,\u201d Bjorn said softlyErna was still drummed up the courage to speak her mind.\u201cI just want to have dinner with you, if you have time,\u201d the confidence she finally found was undermined by her hoarse voice, which shattered the elegance in the words.\u201cI will,\u201d Bjorn agreed, after thinking for a second.He had no other meetings scheduled for that day and the good thing about the impatient Bald Eagle, was that they would finish up pretty quickly.\u201cCan you look me in the eye and say that?\u201d Erna said, all notions of cheer was gone from her and she fixed Bjorn with a stern gaze.Bjorn looked Erna dead in the eyes and repeated what he had said. Satisfied, Erna smiled with relief.\u201cHow about tomorrow? I would like to travel with you,\u201d Erna said, pushing her luck.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to,\u201d Bjorn said, he could see she was in no fit state to travel yet.Erna looked like she had been slapped in the cheek unexpectantly. All her aspirations suddenly dashed on the floor.\u201cWhy, didn\u2019t you say you would listen to me?\u201d\u201cI did listen to you and I said no.\u201d\u201cAre you trying to make fun of me, by treating me like a child?\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cSo I hope you don\u2019t still see me as a young girl.\u201d\u201cYou might be twenty now, but you are still younger than me.\u201d\u201cOnly by five years.\u201dIt was hard to tell when he first saw this woman, but she can be quite the talker. Even being ill was no hurdle for her talkativeness. Once she started, there was no stopping it.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you treat me kindly sometimes? Like now, like this?\u201d\u201cAnd, what else\u2026\u201dThe attendant came back into the room, to express the need to get moving. Bjorn needed to leave.\u201cIt would be nice to hear something romantic, sometimes.\u201d Unable to miss this rare opportunity, Erna found the courage to say so much more.\u201cRomantic?\u201dBjorn stood from the table and adjusted his coat. He looked like he went back to that same old Prince, who had just forgotten when what they had been talking about. The look on his face stung, as if he was looking down at an immature child.Erna changed her mind about giving Bjorn an example and went out to see him off, like she always did. She ignored his order to go back to bed. It was only fair, he ignored her all the time, what was fair for him was for her too.\u201cSee you later,\u201d Erna said, \u201cDon\u2019t be late.\u201dShe looked Bjorn in the eyes when she reminded him. Her eyes were big and wide, and sparkled as they caught the light of the sun.Bjorn looked back at her and nodded once, before setting the carriage off. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh when his route took him past the old cathedral.There had been a little fuss, but in the end, everything was back in its place. Light and fresh, without any unnecessary emotional exhaustion. Bjorn liked the fact that she was an easy and clear woman. By the time he was satisfied that this somewhat impulsive marriage was a good choice, the carriage stopped outside the royal palace.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*It was late in the afternoon, when the Grand Duchess was having afternoon tea in their guesthouse, that she received an unexpected visitor.Lisa had tried to negotiate with the man who had promised an audience with the Grand Duchess without an appointment, returned, panting.\u201cYour Highness, you have to go. This is really, I can\u2019t explain.\u201dLisa dragged her away and Erna could do nothing but be led on by her maid, who led her to the parlour, where the guest was waiting. The other servants were all as surprised and stunned as Lisa, even Karen.\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201dIn the parlour, Erna came face to face with a polite man, bowing before her. People lined up behind him, each with a colourful box.\u201cFirst of all, please have a seat,\u201d Karen said, leading Erna to the sofa in the middle of the room, \u201cIt\u2019s a gift from the Prince.\u201dErna\u2019s eyes grew wide as she sat and Karen whispered in her ear. A middle-aged man, who had been waiting, approached as soon as Erna was seated.\u201cIt is our honour to present to you, her royal highness, the princess of Lechen, with these wonderful jewels,\u201d he bowed again, as he spoke clumsily in Lechenian language, \u201cas ordered, we have selected only the very best for you, Your Highness.\u201dWhen he smiled with a face full of pomp and pride, he sent a glance to the others behind him. They had been waiting patiently in the shadows of the parlour, but now stepped forward and opened up their boxes.\u201cPlease, take your time and choose,\u201d as he stepped back, the box bearers moved a step closer.The revealed jewels. Such jewels that were so gorgeous and beautiful enough to make your head wander.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cBjorn!\u201d Erna called as soon as he entered the drawing room.Bjorn stopped when he noticed the jeweller was still standing guard outside the parlour, he should have left ages ago. Erna was sitting on the sofa, surrounded by people holding boxes filled with sparkling colours.\u201cYou haven\u2019t chosen yet?\u201d Bjorn looked at his watch, bewildered.The jewellery had arrived on time, which should have given Erna plenty of time to choose. It would seem the Erna was incredibly indecisive.\u201cI\u2026I just can\u2019t do it.\u201dErna ran up to him and grabbed his sleeve, she looked like she was begging him to take her away from this. He couldn\u2019t believe she had gotten stuck choosing a simple accessory. He let out a long sigh and led her back to the sofa, like she was a lost child.\u201cMy wife, you must hurry and choose.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about these things, they all look so beautiful, its impossible for me to choose one.\u201dAs she continued to speak, Bjorn could feel his impatience rise and he was getting angry.\u00a0 Looking at Erna, he could see the confusion on her face and she would probably cry if he raised his voice even slightly.\u201cIf it\u2019s that hard for you decide, then take them all.\u201d\u201cNo way. That\u2019s not what I want at all, never.\u201d Erna flushed. \u201cI already received so many gems when we got married, I couldn\u2019t possibly, I\u2019m not that greedy, really.\u201d\u201cErna.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you pick for me, please?\u201d\u201cI wish that I could, but you see, you have a much better eye for these things than I do, so I know what ever you pick, will be the most special jewel.\u201dBjorn placed his hand on Erna\u2019s hip bone and gently urged her toward the jewels. He nodded with his chin at the jeweller who had been watching them and he came over.\u201cBring the most expensive one.\u201dThe jewellers eyes widened slightly at the princes command in Felian. He quickly regained his composure and ushered forward the clerk in the middle, who stepped forward with a box containing a blue diamond necklace.\u201cThis is a necklace I have made recently. I am proud to say that this is one of the finest and unique gems in Felia\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take that one.\u201d Bjorn said.Bjorn had cut off the jeweller before he had chance to finish explaining, he was disappointed at not being able to share the work he had put into it, about how unique the gem was and the fascinating technology used to cut it and set it, but he accepted the Princes request.Bjorn placed the box given to him by the jeweller into Erna\u2019s hands.\u201cA little while ago, what did you say?\u201d Erna asked, as she examined the necklace with both fear and joy.\u201cRomantic words.\u201dA smile spread across Erna\u2019s face, Bjorn studied that smile for a long while. The eyes of his wife were so beautiful, that the jewels of Felia could not compare and they were full of him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What remained of the Honeymoon was a week of rest.Erna paused at the door, reaching for the doorknob, and looked at her husband. He was laid out on the couch, reading a book, with a half empty bottle of wine on the table. He had been like that for so long, just like a part of the furniture.She walked across the room to him, Bjorn looked up at her and smiled, then immediately went back to his book. He did not even move his legs so Erna could sit down, she had to make do with another chair.Erna realised that she had been with the Prince everyday since they got married had been perfectly healthy, until recently.Bjorn didn\u2019t rise from bed until around noon. Where he would sit, reclined, reading a newspaper and slowly sipping on some tea. He would get up for some lunch, then would go horseback riding, play cards or drink. Then he took a nap. Most of the time he spent with her was during sex.\u201cWow, I hope you didn\u2019t sit down so hard you hurt your back,\u201d Erna said.\u201cYou know best about my back health,\u201d Bjorn said unexpectantly. He stood from the couch and filled up his wine glass.\u201cIs it not boring, to lie around all day?\u201d Erna habitually fiddled with the ribbon in her hair.\u201cI\u2019m working hard, Erna.\u201d\u201cOn what, it doesn\u2019t look like your working.\u201d\u201cResting, conserving stamina, regaining my strength.\u201d\u201cWhy, what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cSomething very obscene,\u201d he looked at Erna with hooded eyes and a dirty smile. Erna flinched away, pulling her shawl in tight and shifting back into her seat.\u201cWe just did that.\u201dBjorn laughed at Erna\u2019s reaction and she pouted at him. Not wanting to speak any more, she cast her eyes down to her hands.When ever he had that grin on his face, the corners of his mouth pulled up just so, she went numb.\u00a0 All thought disappeared and only the thumping of her heart remained.Erna rolled her eyes about the room until the heat in her cheeks faded. All her senses were directed at him and she could only hear the turning of pages and a low chuckle. She hated the fact that she still reacted in such a manner, even at the smallest hint.After awhile, she was able to look at Bjorn again without feeling her cheeks flush and her heart race. He was bathing fully in the sunlight and she could see through his shirt to the beautiful body underneath.Erna quietly approached him and lifted the hem of her dress, it kept falling.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Bjorn turned his gaze from the book to Erna.\u201cThe gown is being weird,\u201d Erna said in a small whisper.\u201cDo you not like wearing it?\u201dErna continued to fiddle with the hem of the dress. Bjorn eventually put the book down and leaned over, dropping the hem of the dress Erna had been fiddling with.Shocked, Erna opened the front of her gown and tried to hide her face as if she just saw something she really shouldn\u2019t. The straps of the dress were done up tight and the whole thing became a tangled mess, it looked like Erna had been done up in a bow.\u201cHave you come to refill your stamina?\u201d Bjorn asked.Bjorn grabbed her around the waist as she tried to return to her seat. Erna lost her footing and fell onto his lap. He suddenly lost interest in the book he had been reading and let it dropped to the floor. He gently stroked the back of Erna\u2019s head, who he held gently in his arms as she stared up at the ceiling in a daze.\u201cWe have only a week left,\u201d Erna said, \u201cisn\u2019t it sad to spend all day stuck indoors like this?\u201d\u201cDo you still have something you wish to see in the city, was the sewers not interesting enough?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d her shawl flowed to the floor, over the book dumped on the floor, \u201cwe haven\u2019t done very much together, so why don\u2019t we go out together this afternoon?\u201dThe ribbon that had her hair tied up quickly followed the shawl and rested on the floor. Before Erna realised, Bjorn was unbuttoning her gown. Erna frowned and started to wriggle, but Bjorn adjusted his seating position, while holding her and in her hesitation, he unbuttoned the rest of her gown.It flowed down her smooth skin and fell the floor with the rest of her clothes. Erna stopped resisting. It was always like this, in the end. She didn\u2019t hate it, but she could hear her grandmothers admonition,\u00a0you\u2019re fallen.\u201cIf we go out, what are we going to do?\u201d Bjorn said, stroking Erna\u2019s hair.\u201cI don\u2019t know, lets just look around the city together and\u2026\u201dBjorn\u2019s hands slowly made their way down and cupped Erna\u2019s chest. She felt numbness come to her mind and she couldn\u2019t remember the rest of what she was going to say.\u201cAnd buy a gift, I want to buy a gift,\u201d she said with renewed strength. If she let this conintue any further, she would have wasted another day stuck in the bedroom.\u201cA gift?\u201dBjorn sat back up from kissing Erna\u2019s chest. Erna nodded vigorously, knowing she couldn\u2019t miss this opportunity to do something more.\u201cA gift for my grandmother.\u201d\u201cJust get Karen to do it.\u201d\u201cNo, I want to do it myself, can I?\u201d Erna pleaded.Although Erna is mostly docile. She had a way about her, a tenacious spirit that would always rise to the surface when she wanted to get her own way. She looked at Bjorn with big, sparkling eyes and a hint of a pout. She looked like she was about to cry at any moment. Bjorn nodded and Erna\u2019s face lit up again.\u201cThank you,\u201d she said and wrapped her slender arms around his neck, \u201cyou know, once I got to know you, I could see that you are a much nicer person than you first seemed.\u201d\u201cMe, nice, are you okay?\u201dBjorn laughed, even though he was overly generous with describing himself, he would never have called himself nice, but Erna nodded confidently.\u201cYou have always helped me when I needed it the most. Any time I get upset, you seem to do your absolute best to cheer me up. You might not think it, but you are really good at the things you put your mind to and you know your limits. Whether you\u2019re playing cards or speculating on horse racing, you play to win.\u201dBjorn felt like he had heard those words before, but not in a nice way, from Leonid. He always said that Bjorn was cursed to die from alcohol poisoning, across a cards table, but Erna said it as if it were something to be proud of.\u201cDon\u2019t forget you, Erna, you\u2019re working exceptionally hard too.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Her eyes twinkled, \u201cwhat about me?\u201d She felt a blush of embarrassment.\u201cYou have a beautiful face,\u201d he said, kissing her rosy cheeks, \u201cand a beautiful chest,\u201d he kissed her chest, even as he massaged a breast in his hand, \u201cand a beautiful\u2026\u201dErna\u2019s bright smile narrowed as Bjorn went through his list and as his hand made its way down her front, she quickly kissed him to stop him from uttering the next words she didn\u2019t want to hear. Bjorn giggled through his lips as he returned her clumsy kiss. She was now frowning a lot, but he thought it was cute.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Lisa finally got the chance to show off everything she had learned from reading countless magazines and perusing shop windows. Erna rarely wore any proper clothes, so when this mission came to her, right when she was getting bored, she jumped at the chance to dress Erna for her date.The Grand Duchess, the country bumpkin Princess was going to show everyone that she was more than just a rural girl, with a rural maid. The results will be the most satisfactory.When she was done, she wanted to take a picture, so that she could remind the Prince of how beautiful his wife was. He might have eyes on his head, but they might as well be on the other side of a cloud for all that he notices Erna.If anyone calls Erna an ordinary country girl today, Lisa would have to scrub their eyes, or get them glasses as they were clearly blind.\u201cGo ahead, Erna,\u201dThe wicked prince broke Lisa\u2019s heart once more.When going out as a couple, it\u2019s proper to do things together. What a horrible husband to make his wife travel all this way just to be left alone in a mall!Lisa ground her teeth. Could this be happening? Was the Prince really going to break Erna\u2019s heart like this?\u201cYes. Okay! By the way, Bjorn.\u201d\u00a0Erna\u2019s eyes wandered the crowded lounge of the department store before returning to rest on Bjorn\u2019s face. The book he brought to read was already open on the table. \u201cCan I ask for some advice?\u201d Erna said.\u201cAdvice?\u201d Bjorn replied, not looking up from the book.\u201cI want to get the Royal Family a gift, but I have no idea what to get them.\u201dShe had been thinking on this little problem all the way to the department store, but had no idea what she was going to get. She thought it would be better if Bjorn was there with her, but it seemed like he had no mind to do any shopping together.\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure if there was something they wanted, they would just go out and get it,\u201d Bjorn said absently.Erna looked about the lounge of the department store, feeling a sense of loss. The department store far outshone the one she used in Schuber. It was a bright, colourful place, filled with well dressed men and women. People were sat, having tea at a table around a palm tree and from somewhere, the sound of trickling water. The sunlight shone in through tall windows and further doubled the atmosphere of peace.At first glance, they did not seem like the Grand Ducal couple from Lechen. Bjorn didn\u2019t like bringing too many people about with him, creating a fuss of people who would just hustle and bustle around him. He liked it peaceful.Erna liked this fact. It made her feel like a proper married couple, just out spending time together, but that just seemed like a pipe dream right now.\u201cWell, what gift would you like to get?\u201d\u201cMoney,\u201d Bjorn nearly answered immediately, without giving it much thought.Useless.Erna stood up from the table, calm, before passing through the entrance of the lounge, Erna involuntarily turned around. Bjorn was still just sat, reading his book, turning the page and sipping the tea he had just been served.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was getting bored and stood up from the table. The attendants that were close by quickly followed him.\u201cWhere\u2019s Erna?\u201d\u201cI believe Her Highness is still looking around on the third floor.\u201dBjorn nodded and turned for the stairs that led up to the third floor. Many eyes turned to consider him and even though this was a department store that catered to the nobility, it was very unlikely that anyone in Felia would recognise him. Even if they did, they would not harass him, it\u2019s not polite.As he reached the third floor, he slowed his pace and looked about. The department store was circular in construction, with a void down its middle, so that you could see across an entire floor without much getting in the way.\u201cWe will find the Grand Duchess, Your Highness and then\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, there she is,\u201d Bjorn said, pointing.There was a woman in a red dress, standing in front of a store on the opposite side. She was too far to get a good look at her face, but Bjorn didn\u2019t doubt his vision.Bjorn kept his eye on Erna as he strode around to where she was standing. His haughty gait showed no concern for those who might get in his way. The store was busy, lots of people were coming and going, but he met no trouble from anyone while taking a walk.Erna had been pacing in front of the store for a while, before finally deciding to go in, just as Bjorn reached her. He looked at the shop sign, it was a crafts centre.\u201cAre you planning on learning how to draw?\u201d He muttered.At that moment, Bjorn thought about the red haired man that Erna had planned on running away with, in the middle of the night. The aspiring painter.Bjorn paused for a moment and looked at where Erna had been standing. He gripped his cane with a tight fist briefly.By the time his attendants caught him up, exchanged puzzled glances and Bjorn stepped off again making to enter the store, but Erna was already on her way out.\u201cAh, Bjorn, there you are,\u201d she greeted her husband with a warm smile. There was an entourage of maids behind her, each with several boxes piled in their arms. \u201cI was just about to come back, I am done shopping. Did you finish your book?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Bjorn said, escorting his wife.The moment dropped into an awkward silence and the smile Erna had been wearing faded a little. So she broke into a long winded version of how she picked out all the gifts. Bjorn listened moderately.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*It was an evening of no special note. After leaving the department store, they took a short walk along the river and had dinner. Erna smiled brighter and brighter with each passing moment, right up to when they rode the carriage home.Bjorn watched her as she described all the places she had explored before. She was mesmerised by the scenery that flowed past the carriage. The flowers and feathers in her little, brimless hat fluttered in the slight breeze from the open window.Bjorn tapped on his cane as he peered out the window, at where Erna was looking. Fancy buildings, gas lamps and people. It was just like any other city.It was then that he realised the barren trees and dull bushes lacking flowers. Bjorn had chosen an unfavourable season to have his honeymoon. It was distinctly different to the last honeymoon he was on, during the spring and summer time, but the outside now reflected what was inside back then. A barren marriage doomed to fail. It was a strange flip to reality.He felt strange, watching Erna speak so fondly of the ungodly landscape of the winter city. It wasn\u2019t really a problem, but for some reason it still bothered him. When the irritation reached its peak, the cathedral bells rang.She sat back from the window and laughed with the joy of a child. She felt the embarrassment of that day come rolling back. The sight of her from that day softened his heart.\u201cDo you want to go up again?\u201d Bjorn asked.\u201cNo, once is more than enough,\u201d she looked at him with docile eyes, \u201cstill, there must be a reason why everyone else does, it just seems like a whole lot of extra effort.\u201dErna had been looking into his eyes for a long time and whispered as she spoke, he couldn\u2019t understand it, she always talked like a drunk, even when in a normal state of mind.When he smiled, Erna smiled back at him. His heart felt lighter and Bjorn relaxed deeper into his backrest. They can come back here anytime, they were a married couple after all and they would be sharing many, countless seasons together.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cHis highness is ready, hurry up,\u201d the head maid ordered and the other maids bustled about on pattering feet.It was the last night in Felia and there was to be a party to say farewell to the Grand Duke and Duchess of Lechen. Even the maids who despised the Grand Duchess showed unwavering loyalty to the couple. It was a matter of show, no outsiders should see the slander the maids spoke of the Grand Duchess. They did not want to see the wife of the once Crown Prince of Lechen disgraced.Erna was dressed up and adorned with all the new accessories she had bought. With each adornment, she looked more and more beautiful, more and more regal. Even the maids couldn\u2019t hide their surprise.There was no sign of the ignorant country girl, she looked like she had always been among true nobility. No one dared to think that just a few months ago, she was a scandal-ridden bumpkin, tossed to the bottom of the marriage pile.Once the maid had fitted the necklace gift, Lisa came forward with the last piece of jewellery. It was a tiara that the Queen had gifted her. Erna looked at it nervously.\u2018It\u2019s a very dear treasure to me, please cherish it.\u2019Although she had been embarrassed, Erna had curtsied and promised the Queen she would look after it.Although Erna had inherited several other tiaras, she cherished this one the most. When she got married, it was this tiara she chose without hesitation.\u201cIt\u2019s done, Your Highness.\u201dLisa backed away. Erna got up and left the room. She passed through the long hallway and when she came to the stairs, Bjorn was waiting at the bottom. As they made eye contact, she felt the fear melt away, like snow in the summer sun.As she came down the stairs, she held out her hand to Bjorn and smiled with excitement.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*It was a night that passed like a beautiful dream.The splendid world always stole the breath from her, but she was fine as long as she was with him, with Bjorn, with this man who always held her trembling hand.Everything would be fine.She wanted to believe that, even when she was hurt, because she loved him.With Bjorn, Erna forgot everything.The only thing that filled that forgotten feeling, the tension and the fear that still plagued her heart, was Bjorn. It was not something that could be seen, only felt and Erna really did.That dazzling, brilliant night often came to her.Erna saw that night in the sunrise, over the sea, as she stood on the deck, in the familiar, yet unfamiliar streets of Schuber and in the still-overwhelming unfamiliar Palace. Then everything became fine like magic.The love she felt was as bad as her husband,sad,\u00a0sometimes hurtbut it was also alluring like him.When the waters rose and the branches of the tree filled with leaves and became good again, Erna knew it would hold true. She maintained that firm belief, until winter turned to spring.\u201cErna,\u201d\u00a0A voice interrupted the afterglow of her beautiful dream, \u201cwake up Erna.\u201dWhen she slowly opened her eyes, she saw a faint smile greet her. The first thing she felt was a warmth about her. It was from the fresh spring sun pouring in through the curtains and\u2026She saw him.A beautiful dream smiling down at her in the light,Bjorn.\u201cDo you still want to see the fountain\u2019s first operation? It\u2019s nearly time,\u201d he playfully tapped the bridge of her nose with a delicate fingertip.\u201cA\u2026fountain?\u201d Erna\u2019s eyes slowly came into focus and the dream fuzz melted.Erna jumped up and got off the bed. It wasn\u2019t until she was practically out onto the balcony that she realised she was not wearing a single thread of clothes. Bjorn burst into laughter, as Erna ran back to put on a robe.Mrs Fitz had told her a few days ago that the fountain would resume operation today, after being switched off for the winter season. Erna had been talking about it to everyone and was very excited to see the first jets of water. She was embarrassed by the fact that she had slept in.\u201cBjorn, you too\u2026\u201dErna turned to call him and stopped as his naked body stood before the bed. Sunlight streamed in and made him glow almost. She was used to his nakedness by now, but seeing it in the sunshine like that made her falter.While Erna turned back to the fountain, Bjorn put on his own gown and came out to the balcony. As he leaned on the railing, his long shadow was cast back into the room and merged with hers.Erna watched the great fountain and held his hand. The Fountain was at the end of a long waterway, stretching down the garden, it was attached to the Abit River, which sparkled under the spring sun.While she frowned at the glittering water, great spouts jettisoned into the air all along the watery path until it reached the fountain that exploded into motion. Her gasp harmonised with the sound of gushing water.By her side, Bjorn looked at his wife, who was beaming like a child.The first day of spring had arrived, it was his third season with his wife.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBreakfast had been set up to the side of the garden, near the great fountain, under the orders of Bjorn.\u201cThere are so many pretty places in the palace,\u201d Erna said.Erna looked about and admired the rich table that had been set up under the shade of an apple tree. The jets of water from the fountain glistened in the spring sun and even Bjorn. Everything she looked upon was like a beautiful dream.Bjorn looked back at her with a light smile, before turning to look out to the distant sky.\u00a0 Sunlight penetrated through the tree and shone upon his languid face.Erna watched her husband as she chewed on a thing pancake. He was so tall, he must have felt the chairs were far too small when he sat in them. Which was probably why he always stretched his legs and sat in such an awkward and twisted position. She liked it because it made him look cool. The tea cup he held in one hand, the blossom of the apple tree fluttering in the wind and even the fat pigeon that had started pacing near his feet, they all looked so beautiful.\u201cBy the way, Bjorn, about that concert yesterday, I met with Countess Brunner, who was really very sweet to me and introduced me to a lot of other ladies.\u201dBjorn looked up from the newspaper he had been reading, as Erna attempted to engage with a random topic.\u201cBrunner?\u201d Bjorn scratched the tip of his chin and considered. It was no surprise, given how much money they had borrowed from his bank.\u201cEveryone who is kind to me, all seem to have borrowed money from you. I am starting to think it would be nice if all the aristocracy borrowed money from you.\u201d\u201cWe have the same dream,\u201d Bjorn said with a little chuckle, \u201cits not a bad idea, great ambition.\u201dBjorn folded up the newspaper he had not fully read yet and set it aside, on the table. A bank that could swallow up the whole continent certainly sounded like a dream.\u201cI\u2019ll have to keep the leash of debt tight to all the families within the social circle of my wife.\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cI know what its like to be tied to debt, so, if you want to make them, then, its too bad.\u201d Erna\u2019s expression was serious.\u201cDid you really intend to pay off your debt by selling flowers?\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll show you some time.\u201d\u201cShow what?\u201d\u201cThe money I had saved up to pay you back, I still have it.\u201dBjorn didn\u2019t complain about the absurd remarks Erna kept making, purely because he found her face very pretty in that moment. Stern, pouty and full of matter of facts.\u201cAnyway, the attendees of the luncheon were not those who had borrowed money from you, I think it was because Duchess Heine was there.\u201dLouise?Bjorn looked confused as Erna mentioned his sister. Of all the people who he would thought hated Erna Dniester the most, he would have said her. She had the closest relationship with Gladys.\u201cLouise?\u201d\u201cYes, she is helping me in a lot of ways and convinced all the other wives that were weighing their attendance.\u201d\u201cStill looks like she\u2019s trying to become the Princess of Lechen,\u201d Bjorn muttered.\u201cWhy do you talk about your sister like that?\u201d\u201cBecause that\u2019s just the kind of brother I am.\u201dBjorn waved to the waiting servants, who bustled forward noiselessly and cleared the table, poured out fresh tea, then retreated back to a discreet distance.\u201cDon\u2019t expect any favours from Louise, she hates you as much as she loves Gladys.\u201d Bjorn picked up a cigar, snipped the end.Erna gave him a wounded look, an intrusive look, but Bjorn did not change his mind. The truth was the truth.She might not have been the woman he had chosen first, but he wanted her to be the Grand Duchess. Erna was supposed to bring peace to his life and at least one of them accomplished that.Erna looked down at her plate and played with the fork.Bjorn reached for the matches but did not strike. Erna did not handle cigar smoke very well, but she was too stubborn to move to a safe distance, she wanted to be next to him. In the end, Bjorn conceded and put the matches down and looked at his wife with an unlit cigar between his lips.He watched Erna delicately cut up the baked apple and eat it little by little. Although she didn\u2019t show much enthusiasm for food, she was a woman of strange temperament who eats evenly and diligently. That was probably why she had the strength to travel around the world with such a thin and frail body.\u201cAh, its spring,\u201d Erna mused.She watched the apple blossom sway in the gently morning breeze. Her eyes looked as if she was about to cry, but were smiling brightly.\u201cSpring,\u201d Bjorn whispered quietly,\u00a0\u2018Autumn, Winter and Spring,\u2019\u00a0when he remembered that nearly half a year had gone by, he felt strange.\u201cWe met, nearly a full year ago, before the National Foundation Festival Ball, remember?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes, it was the day I had come up from Buford and you showed up at the train station that day. I remember the crowd had shoved me all the way to the front and I saw the Grand Dukes procession.\u201d Erna smiled and Bjorn captured that satisfied smile.Quiet.Beautiful.Harmless.He was generally happy with the wife he chose because of that, although, as he got to know her, she wasn\u2019t very quiet at all, but she was definitely beautiful and harmless. Being such a noisy woman, but only to him, was not as irritating as he thought.\u201cI saw you on Tara Boulevard quite often, Lisa had to tell me who you were.\u201d\u201cYour maid? Hmm, I bet that must have been a curse.\u201d\u201cOh, no,\u201d Erna shook her head.Bjorn\u2019s lips curled softly as he looked at his wife, who held no talent for lies.\u201cYou should have come and spoken to me,\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIf we often crossed paths, why didn\u2019t you say hello?\u201d\u201cIf I did, would you have greeted me in return?\u201d\u201cMaybe, maybe I could have done more.\u201d\u201cWould you kindly not tarnish my memories with those kinds of thoughts.\u201d\u201cWhat, why? What did you think I meant with \u2018more\u2019?\u201d There was a playfulness to his tone.\u201cT-thats\u2026\u201d\u201cI meant a handshake.\u201d\u201cYou did not.\u201d\u201cOr, what then?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026that thing\u2026\u201d Erna\u2019s cheeks turned red, like the blossoms of the apple tree.\u201cOh, that thing.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cCongratulations on becoming a lay about, Grand Duchess of Lechen,\u201d Bjorn gave a mock applause to the woman that had become just like him. Erna became flustered.\u201cNext time, I think I would like to make an apple flower for my hat,\u201d Erna said after a long moment of staring down at the table, attempting to change the subject.\u201cDo you still have a vacancy on your hat?\u201d Bjorn said, with his chin propped up on his fist. Her wide brimmed hat was already adorned with countless artificial flowers.\u201cOf course, there is so much left to fill,\u201d she grouped at her hat, \u201cI\u2019ll make you one too.\u201dErna was excited and started laying out plans to make Apple Blossom corsages. She seemed the same when she was planning on paying off her debts by making artificial flowers.Bjorn habitually bit on his cigar, still between his lips, as Erna spoke. He was still not going to light it, he didn\u2019t like the sound of a coughing woman braking this tranquility.\u201cHow is the flower? The token of our promise.\u201d Erna asked, eyes sparkling with anticipation. A vague smile came to Bjorn\u2019s lips, recalling the little white flower that had been thrown away into an ashtray.\u201cFine.\u201dErna smiled brightly at the small, reasonable answer. It was just a fake flower.Bjorn looked at Erna with a strange thirst. The irritation at not being able to light his cigar had changed into something more exuberant and lethargic, like the spring sun. Again, any kind of addiction was dangerous. He put the Cigar into the ashtray with a sigh. Again, his wife was studying the flowers.Bjorn studied the cigar, then Erna, one after the other then back again. He looked about the garden, there were only two servants left. He rose from the table and approached Earna.\u201cBjorn?\u201dEven when he met Erna\u2019s surprised eyes, he calmly untied the ribbon of her hat and tossed it onto the table.\u201cW-wait, no, people can see.\u201d Erna shook her head as he lowered his to kiss her.\u201cNo one is here,\u201d Bjorn said calmly.He pointed to the empty waiting area, where the servants had quietly slipped away. The garden was visible from the bedroom window, it would have been the same as then.\u201cBut here\u2026\u201dNo I don\u2019t want to do it here. Erna thought to herself, instead of saying the unfinished words out loud.Against her will, her body rose to meet his and by the time she came to her senses, she was pressed up against the tree and Bjorn\u2019s body. Before she could protest again, Bjorn\u2019s lips were on hers and she drank deeply of the passion he poured into her.She was nervous that someone might see, pretending to give in to Bjorn\u2019s kissing lips. She thought it might be okay, because of the tree blocking line of sight to the palace. It wasn\u2019t until Bjorn\u2019s large hands rolled up her skirt, that she didn\u2019t know what Bjorn was thinking.\u201cBjorn, what are you thinking right now?\u201d\u201cThinking just like a lay-about,\u201d he said, looking into Erna\u2019s wide eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bjorn looked up at Erna as she moved on top of him, her breasts bouncing with the exertion. Her delicate little body glistened with perspiration and glowed a flush red.\u201cI don\u2019t like it here, can\u2019t we go inside?\u201d She asked.Bjorn swallowed her words with a kiss and moved his hands down to her buttocks. He lifted her skirt and removed her underwear. Erna gasped and struggled a little, the resistance didn\u2019t last long. She hugged Bjorn, with her arms around his neck and with her legs. She lost her balance and hung off Bjorn by the nape of his neck.They were pressed together and Bjorn could feel that she was already wet enough, maybe because she secretly enjoyed this. He began grinding against her without penetrating.\u201cLook at this.\u201d Bjorn\u2019s hand, which had been stroking Erna\u2019s moist bottom, reached up to caress her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d\u00a0 like he was applying lipstick, his fingers glided over Erna\u2019s lips, and then he slowly inserted a finger into her open mouth. \u201cEat it. It\u2019s your taste.\u201dBjorn started to wiggle her tongue slowly and Erna could do nothing to stop him from making his lewd deed on her.\u201cIs it delicious?\u201dHis sweltering breath drowned out his words. Erna sobbed as she took a deep breath for the first time after he slowly pulled his fingers.\u201cLook here, you act like you don\u2019t want to, but your body tells a different story,\u201d he said.\u201cDon\u2019t do this, this words you use, its so crude,\u201d Erna protested, but he was right, she was secretly enjoying this.Bjorn pushed himself into her and she arched back, letting out a gasp. She was pushed up against the tree, becoming trapped between it and her husband. Now that he was inside her and thrusting deeply, she had no longer had the desire to escape this situation. She felt weak to give in so easily to the sensations.With her thin legs wrapped around him, Bjorn pushed up into Erna with all his might. Erna had been stubbornly keeping her mouth closed, to stifle any more lewd noises, but at this she finally collapsed and moaned out loud.Bjorn found this intoxicating. He did not mind that he had to work for it, because once Erna finally gave into the feelings, he never felt more attracted to a woman.The tree bucked and swayed to their motion and the petals fell like snow. Erna opened her eyes, water in them blurred the world around her and to her, it looks like snow in springtime. It was beautiful, she thought.It was good and a little sad.The man inside her caused all her thoughts to be erased. Even as she struggled with shame, she could feel the heat of his body against her cool flesh, her toes tingle and curling.Bjorn moved more erratically and moments later, Erna could feel him finish and settle down to a slow, sensual motion and peace was returned to the world. Erna clung to him as she felt the end and breathed heavily into his neck.When she pulled away, he looked at her and she looked at him. Small petals of white fell between them. It was an empty and emotionless expression they shared.She was as beautiful as this spring day, Bjorn thought to himself, but did not think to say it out loud.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cLook, here it is,\u201d Erna said, standing up from where she had been rummaging through the bottom drawer.She turned to Bjorn, who was reclining in an armchair and held out the box she had been looking for.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Mrs. Fritz to get you a safe?\u201d Bjorn said casually, eyeing the box.Erna clutched the box to her chest defensively. It looked like an antique cookie jar.\u201cI like this. I\u2019ve been using it for a long time and I am familiar with it.\u201dErna removed the tin lid and Bjorn could see inside. It was filled to the brim with junk. Small notepads, trinkets, lace collars and a rolled up bundle of paper, tied up and kept together by ribbon. As he frowned in disbelief, Erna pulled out the fat roll of bills and a small cotton pouch that contained coins.\u201cI\u2019ve collected so much.\u201dShe proudly showed off the money she had been hoarding in the large cookie jar. She was like an old banker, who was well versed in securing liquidity and stabbed Bjorn in the heart with it.This deer was never a common one.Bjorn was stunned to find such an adversary under his own roof. Gone are the days when the bank would say that anyone could come in and deposit their money safely.\u201cWhy?\u201d Bjorn asked, stunned.Erna looked at Bjorn with round eyes. She felt like she was facing his own grandmother, the Duchess of Arsene, who had been so against the rapidly changing world. No. The Duchess of Arsene had some of her own savings accounts, so that comparison was not exact.Bjorn looked at his wife, who seemed to be living in the last century not in just the manner of her dress, but ideals as well. He burst into laughter and Erna cocked a look at him, not understanding the joke.The Grand Duchess\u2019 cookie jar bank. This was the form of Bjorn\u2019s insult? How he had been shut down. Erna placed the bills back into the jar and replaced the lid. The smiling snowman, who\u2019s nose made up the handle, was laughing at him, as if teasing him.It was like the kids that would walk around with a piece of muslin for comfort. Never letting it go and throwing a tantrum should anyone attempt to take their comfort blanket from them.A knock came at the door and Mrs Fritz came in.\u201cAh, you\u2019re back, Your Highness. You need to give confirmation to the Director of the Royal Academy of Arts today.\u201dBjorn raised an eyebrow. \u201cTo the art director, why?\u201d\u201cFor your portrait with the Grand Duchess. You are needed to confirm if you wish to go ahead with the recommended artist.\u201d\u201cAh, that.\u201dAccording to royal custom, the portraits of the Grand Duke and Duchess were to be hung in the hallways with all the portraits of all the Dniester ancestors. It has been several seasons already. Bjorn was procrastinating on the matter, he found it very dull.\u201cJust do as the art director suggests,\u201d Bjorn said, waving a hand.He had no interest in art, so it didn\u2019t really matter to him. Since the Academy of Arts houses some of the best artists in the land, whoever the art director suggested would no doubt be well suited to the task.\u201cYes, Your Highness, I will send the reply immediately. I believe the Director mentioned the artist\u2019s name as Mister Lore.\u201d\u201cLore?\u201d Bjorn thought for a second, \u201cPavel Lore?\u201d\u201cAh, yes, Your Highness, Pavel Lore.\u201dErna let out a sigh as Mrs Fitz confirmed the name. Bjorn looked down at his restless wife.\u201cDo you wish to discuss this more?\u201d Mrs Fitz asked, seeing Erna\u2019s reaction. Bjorn shook his head and Mrs Fitz left.\u201cBjorn, I wish we could get a different artist,\u201d Erna said, letting everything out once Mrs Fitz had left, \u201cplease, get someone else.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cPavel\u2026\u201d Erna faltered as she recalled that Autumn night and how she had said goodbye to Pavel.Painting the portraits of the royal family was a great honour for any painter, but Erna could not face a reunion with the man she told never to write to her. No matter how great the honour was for him, she didn\u2019t want to go through with that and didn\u2019t want to put him through that.\u201cI don\u2019t want to see him,\u201d Erna said, strength coming to her words, \u201cplease Bjorn, please.\u201dErna begged again, an attitude that grated against Bjorn\u2019s nerves, even though Erna spoke softer than when she was constantly prattling on.Bjorn leaned back on the cushions and looked out the window. The spring day was very beautiful and the sunlight streaming in, making Erna\u2019s skin glow, made her look just as beautiful. There was no reason to linger on this painter, but if Erna was going to be uncomfortable with him being around, maybe he should get her a new painter.What would have happened if he had not found her, abandoned in the rain on that fateful night? It was a meaningless question that suddenly came to his mind when he looked at Erna. It wasn\u2019t a hard question to answer, she would have run off with that painter.She really must have intended to follow him, if she was willing to wait so long in the rain, in the dead of night. If he had not taken the carriage past the station, she would have gone with Pavel Lore and probably be his wife by now.A light smile came to Bjorn as he considered the scenario. Then, while Erna looked at him pitifully, he rang the small service bell and Mrs Fitz returned.\u201cYes, Your Highness?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get things moving as they are, the sooner it\u2019s done, the sooner we can move on to more important things.\u201d Bjorn said.He saw no reason to change the artist just because things might be a little awkward for Erna, the sooner they got the paintings done, the sooner they could move on from this.When Mrs Fitz withdrew, the drawing room became very silent. Erna looked at Bjorn, bewildered, but said nothing. The snowman on the cookie jar in her lap carried on smiling innocently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cIts a shame you didn\u2019t wear that necklace today, it would have been nice to have taken a look at it, Your Highness,\u201d said the Baroness, seated at the far end of the table.The noble ladies had been talking about the fair that was due in Lechen within the month, but the Baroness suddenly changed the conversation to the Grand Duchess\u2019 diamond necklace, which had made the whole of Lechen tumultuous for some time.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that it is a very beautiful piece of jewellery. Its so wonderful to see the two of you getting along. I really envy you.\u201dThe ladies about the table had been showering Erna with praise and compliments. Erna struggled to detect any thorns laced within the words, thanks in part to her lack of understanding of the social world.\u201cI didn\u2019t wear it because I felt it a little inappropriate for a luncheon,\u201d Erna said, trying not to show any signs of embarrassment.The flutter of her heart and the ache in her stomach did not cause her smile to falter, as she promised to show it off to them next time. The conversations turned back to words of encouragement, praise and acceptance for the newly-weds. They came like the sweet scent of flowers in the garden.Erna managed to play the part of hostess very well. Following the natural course of conversation without faltering, adding appropriate responses where needed. They had walked the garden, admired the flowers and drank tea in the summer house. All that was making Erna tired, but her smile never once faltered.It wasn\u2019t until after Erna returned that she heard the rumours. The Grand Duchess, Erna Dniester, had swooped in to prevent the happy reunion of Bjorn and Gladys. She was only after his money and the news coming out of Felia was that Erna had coerced Bjorn in buying the most expensive diamond necklace. Of course, there was no time to explain what really happened.People judged, defined and exhibited their own opinions about Erna, without ever really knowing the woman. All Erna could do was tread carefully and not let things get any worse.Slowly, all the guests left later on in the afternoon, until there was only one guest left, Princess Louise.\u201cLouise, I must thank you. Thanks to you I was able to safely hold today\u2019s luncheon.\u201dLouise looked at Erna with the same smile she had greeted her with when she arrived. She sighed deeply and folded away her fan. The smile that she had been wearing all day faded. She looked so much like Bjorn.Say thank you, invite her to a late dinner, talk about fountains and flowers.Unable to continue the conversation she had planned out and rehearsed, Erna suddenly lost the flow of conversation and looked at Louise blankly.Many of Schuber\u2019s noble ladies had only come today because of Louise. She had come forward and persuaded those who had been sitting on the invites to go to the luncheon.Erna was glad that Princess Louise, who had been cold to her this entire time, finally decided to open up. On the one hand, Erna had been fearing this day, expecting an ambush, but at the same time, she was excited for it.\u201cLouise, if I make any mistakes\u2026\u201d\u201cThe reason I stand on your side is to save face for my brother and the royal family. I hope you don\u2019t think this is any sort of friendship.\u201dWhen Erna sat down opposite Louise, the Princess pushed herself up from the table and stepped away.\u201cStill, you\u2019ve been a great help, so, thank you\u2026\u201d Erna said.\u201cCan\u2019t you think about by brother and the Royal Family a little more? It\u2019s just the necklace that people are making noise about. Did you have to get such lavish and expensive jewellery abroad and cause such a stir?\u201d\u201cIt was a birthday present, I did not ask for it.\u201d\u201cIf you want to be extravagant, do it in Lechen. I won\u2019t get involved in that,\u201d Louise frowned as if to say she didn\u2019t want to hear any more on the matter. \u201cI also don\u2019t like letters asking for more friendship than is deserved.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken, Princess, I didn\u2019t ask for anything. It was a simple to say hello. Like any person would send to acquaintances, friends or family.Erna\u2019s lips began to tremble, but she fought hard to keep her voice level and stern. Mrs Fitz had told her that it was customary for members of the Royal Family to send each other letters now and then. It was especially important for the Grand Duchess and it was one responsibility Erna was determined to take seriously.\u201cYes, but Grand Duchess, we are not anything like those relationships,\u201d the wrinkles on Louise\u2019s brow deepened, \u201cdo you not think it\u2019s emotional violence toward me? Someone who is close personal friends with Princess Gladys, who is then expected to force a relationship with the Grand Duchess?\u201dErna could not find the appropriate response. It seemed like every word Louise spoke was edged like a razor blade and designed to cut deep into Erna\u2019s mind.\u201cI just wanted to tell you that I am still friends with Princess Gladys and my friendship with her is important to me. Of course, as the Princess of Lechen, I will stand by the Grand Duchess for my brothers sake, but please do not ask for more acquaintances than is absolutely necessary. And please, try and be a good fit for the Prince of Lechen.\u201dOnce she had finished what she wanted to say, the Princess left the summer house. Erna had been absent minded for a time, then hurriedly followed after the Princess. Emotional violence? Erna understood the meaning of the words the Princess had so coldly thrown at her, but she wanted to finish the social properly.Louise had just stood there, staring at Erna blankly as she said her farewells to her last guest. Louise left without saying another word.Erna returned to her room and slumped in the chair in front of the desk, letting out a long sigh. It was lucky that Louise rejected her before Erna had invited her to dinner, that would have been embarrassing.Bjorn was right. She didn\u2019t want to admit it, but she had to accept the fact. Should she live without expectations, taking for granted the hate from everyone who still loved Princess Gladys?No matter how many times she thought about it, she could not come up with a reasonable answer. Emotional violence. Erna was ashamed of that label attached to her.Erna sat in the chair and continued to repeat the question, until the walls were painted the colours of sun set. Suddenly, she found that she missed her Grandmother.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cNot bad,\u201d Bjorn said, he could scarcely believe the report he held in his hand.Bjorn approached the fireplace and tossed the report into it without hesitation. The repost of the atrocities caused by Count Hardy and his wife went up in flames.\u201cFrom now on, I want you to report to me every two weeks,\u201d Bjorn said to the butler who had brought the report.\u201cYes, Your Highness,\u201d Greg the butler said flatly.Seeing that the reporting period was reduced from one month to two weeks, Greg was satisfied that the Prince was at least aware the situation needed to be kept an eye on. His mind was relived.It was on the night of his wedding that Bjorn decided to keep an eye on Walter Hardy. Even during his honeymoon, he had been receiving reports and telegrams. For awhile, it looked like Walter Hardy was taking care of himself, touching on minor luxuries and investments and as time went by, the fence got a little bigger.The report of the day was that Walter Hardy had been selling his son-in-laws name to raise investment money. It was still in its early stages, but it seemed like a lot of people were being affected by the name Prince Bjorn.Bjorn left the study after confirming the weeks schedule. The conscious, ever present smile, faded as he climbed the stairs and walked down the long corridor.He had foreseen the Hardy families lax behaviour coming and was prepared for it. There was nothing to be surprised, or angry about and Bjorn was determined not to get involved unless they crossed a line. To appease a noisy child, give them sweets.Bjorn headed straight for Erna\u2019s room.\u201cHer Highness is not yet finished, Your Highness,\u201d said Lisa, Erna\u2019s maid.She quickly approached him when he came into the drawing room and bowed her head. After checking the time, Bjorn nodded happily and walked over to Erna\u2019s desk to sit down. There was plenty of time before the painter finished preparing.\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll wait right here.\u201dBjorn sat cross legged in the chair, that had a delicate length of lace draped over it. The maid bowed and continued about her business.Pavel Lore.As Bjorn thought about the name, a strange sense of desolation came over him. He felt concerned by it.Bjorn looked about the room and found his gaze fall upon the golden antler he had given Erna, whole utterly under the influence of alcohol. She had tied a little ribbon at the top. His tight lips relaxed gently.It had been the weekend after the honeymoon that he had seen the ribboned trophy. He was leaning out of the window, looking at something, then when he turned his eyes inward, he caught sight of the jagged shape.\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d He had said in surprise.\u201cThere are so many trophies in this house, I tied a ribbon on my to distinguish it from the rest,\u201d Erna said, looking up from her writing desk.She had the poise of calm and grace about her, as she turned back to her writing, like someone completely unaware they had just done something out of the ordinary.That day, when Bjorn laughed so loud, Erna gave him a confused look, the ribbon tied around the trophy had been blue. Today, the ribbon was pink. It seemed like Erna changed the ribbon depending on the season, or her mood.Bjorn smiled as he fingered the ends of the pink ribbon, just as the door opened and Erna stepped in. She wore a watery blue dress, adorned with gold, pearls and delicate lace. She was more splendid and beautiful that Bjorn could have imagined.Bjorn stood in front of her with a satisfied smile. His gaze, which had been slowly examining the sparkling tiara, elaborately braided hair, veil and dangling earrings stopped on the nape of her neck.\u201cWhere\u2019s the necklace I gave you?\u201d Bjorn\u2019s eyes narrowed as he considered the sparkling pearl necklace about his wife\u2019s neck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They looked about the room as if not noticing the Prince\u2019s questioning glance.He liked the necklace, either way, his wife was beautiful what ever she wore. Bjorn knew the reason his wife didn\u2019t wear the necklace was just because of aesthetic.\u201cBring it here,\u201d Bjorn ordered a maid, \u201churry up.\u201dThe bewildered maid left and Bjorn turned to his wife. It didn\u2019t matter if he replaced the necklace, Erna was still his, but there was something about that pearl necklace that scratched his nerves. Erna lifted her sad eyes to look at Bjorn.\u201cBjorn, I\u2026\u201d\u201cI like that necklace, Erna,\u201d Bjorn\u2019s tone was soft, but Erna didn\u2019t feel it, \u201cplease wear it.\u201dIt was the first gift Bjorn had chosen for her and he wanted her to wear it for the portrait. It was the most precious jewel to Erna, no matter what anyone said, but she did not want to wear it for the portrait. It felt to her like she was showing off her extravagance, providing ammunition for the excitedly slanderous women of Lechen.Bjorn didn\u2019t seem willing to listen and Erna couldn\u2019t muster up the courage to speak her mind. In the meantime, the maid eventually returned with the jewellery box containing the necklace.Bjorn took the necklace from its box and placed it around Erna\u2019s neck. The tips of her closed lips trembled ever so slightly as the cold metal touched her skin.\u201cYou look beautiful, Erna,\u201d Bjorn said, smiling as he put the necklace on her.The compliments Bjorn gave her always made her heart flutter, but now, they felt as cold and heavy as the necklace around her neck.\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, with a laugh.She like Bjorn enough to want him to be happy, so she didn\u2019t show any of the true emotions she felt. She hated herself for lying to him like this. It was a strange feeling.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Pavel\u2019s hand was rigid as he sketched. He had drawn Erna many times before, but the fact that the Prince of Lechen, her husband, was stood right next to her made things a little awkward. He took a breath and recomposed himself, filling the quiet air with the soft rasping of charcoal on paper.They had chosen to do the portrait in the drawing room, where there were large windows that faced south. The space had a lot of vibrant blues, the colour of the Lechen Royal Family.Pavel had painted a lot of aristocratic families, over the years, but none of them had a mansion quite this size. It was actually quite intimidating.Seeing Erna here felt strange. He felt like he was meeting her for the first time. There was no sign of the girl he had spent his childhood walking the fields with. This was an elegant, noble lady that stood before him.Erna had feared that Pavel would greet her as he would do when they were growing up, but that did not happen. Pavel remained respectful as he said hello to the Ducal couple.Pavel had tried to refuse the order of the art director, he no more wanted to do this than embarrass himself in any social situation, but the director was insistent and told Pavel that this assignment would elevate him to grand statuses.Pavel was well aware of this, but when it came to Erna, he had a hard time accepting the decision. He missed her a lot and wanted to see how she was doing, but he didn\u2019t want to open old wounds. It was a strange mix of feelings he had a hard time coming to terms with.In the end, Pavel decided that he was going to flat out refuse the assignment, but it was too late. The order had been given by Prince Bjorn and Pavel Lore was to be the artist for the royal portrait.The wolf seal on the letter confirming the order and the appointment stuck in Pavel\u2019s mind when he first met the Ducal couple. Erna looked up from fiddling with her fingers, as she always did when nervous and Prince Bjorn looked at him too, with a sly smile.\u201cErn\u2026er\u2026Would Her Highness please raise her head a little. Thank you.\u201d Pavel said, stumbling over what to call Erna.At Pavel\u2019s request, Erna awkwardly raised her head.\u201cIs this alright?\u201d\u201cA little lower, sorry.\u201d\u201cLike this?\u201d Erna was trying to do as requested, but this time bowed her head a little too deeply.Still the same Erna, over eager to please.Erna used to love posing for Pavel, but as soon as she got in front of an easel, she went as stiff as a plank of wood. He had always preferred to draw Erna doing something she was comfortable with; running in a field, reading a book under a tree, picking an apple, driving a goat. She was the soul reason he had perfected his croquets skill.As if she was recalling the same memories, Erna smiled shy and awkwardly. Those clear, kind eyes and sweet smile. Definitely the same Erna Pavel had always known.Pavel sketched for a moment, then slowly approached the Ducal couple, looking at Bjorn as if asking permission before doing anything. Bjorn nodded.\u201cIf you could look in this direction, head this way. You can leave your hands a little more natural here,\u201d Pavel gestured and held Erna in her posture.The Prince moved as Pavel struggled to get Erna in the right pose without touching her. Erna could not get a sense of what Pavel was trying to do.\u201cHere, just bow a little deeper,\u201d Bjorn said and gently moved her chin, \u201chands like this,\u201d he arranged the position of her hands so they sat a little more naturally. It showed that Bjorn had sat through a good many portraits.\u201cThere, I think we are done now, Mr Lore,\u201d said Bjorn, adopting his pose once more.Pavel felt like Bjorn was being more than a little arrogant as he sat straight backed, but he could not complain, Erna was finally sat like a true model, just as he wanted.Pavel went back to his easel and started sketching again. There was no need to add comment about the Prince\u2019s pose and posture, he was perfect.The sunlight shone bright between the two men staring at each other.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cWould you like to take a break?\u201d Pavel asked as he stepped back from the easel.Bjorn turned to see that Erna was looking a lot more pale than she usually did. He felt a little ashamed that the painter noticed it before he did, but he had been looking at them the entire time, Bjorn had completely spaced out.\u201cI do feel a little dizzy,\u201d Erna said, \u201cbut I will be okay to continue if I can just rest a little bit.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re tired, we can stop for the day,\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cNo, no, that wont be necessary.\u201d\u201cErna.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, really,\u201d Erna smiled, shaking her head.After Erna assured Bjorn she would be alright, she left the room with Lisa, leaving Bjorn and Pavel together. Bjorn went to sit on the couch and lit a cigar. He called Pavel over, who hesitated a moment, before reluctantly going over to the couch.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t smoke cigars, Your Highness,\u201d Pavel said when Bjorn offered him one.Bjorn poured out a glass of whiskey and ice, offering it to Pavel, but again, Pavel declined the drink respectfully.\u201cDon\u2019t you enjoy drinking either?\u201d Bjorn said, taking a sip of it instead.\u201cI do, You Highness, I apologise.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, your working, I get it,\u201d Bjorn said, ringing a serving bell and requesting the servant bring a cup of tea for Pavel. \u201cMr Lore, what do you like? besides painting, obviously.\u201dPavel turned to look at the Prince, \u201cI enjoy reading, when I have any spare time. I\u2019ll go for a walk and read a book.\u201dPavel answered with all the courtesy he could muster. He behaved politely, without seeming servile. Bjorn looked at him for a long moment. The model student that wasn\u2019t quite as boring as Leonid.Bjorn came to the conclusion that Pavel had quite a noble baring about him. Had Erna decided to run away with him, she would no doubt still be playing house. He could almost see Pavel as a friend, or even a brother.Their conversation was interrupted by the servant bringing in tea. Bjorn leaned back on the couch as he considered Pavel, slow cigar smoke drifted lazily to the ceiling.\u201cWhen do you think the portrait will be completed?\u201dBjorn changed his conversation as he brushed the ashes away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bjorn listened attentively, but even so, Pavel doubted he wouldn\u2019t remember half of what he said by this evening.\u201cWhere\u2019s Erna?\u201d Bjorn asked absently once the conversation between them reached a natural end. He called a maid, who went to check.\u201cHer Highness is feeling much better and will be on her way shortly.\u201dBjorn nodded and tossed the half finished cigar into the ashtray. Pavel stood up and returned to his easel. It seemed like the suffocation was probably caused by the confusing behaviour of the Prince. It was just as people had told him it would be.He was light and dignified, with a grace as if he were roomy. Even when he was relaxing, he did not let his guard down, always putting on heirs. Just the fact that Pavel couldn\u2019t read or understand something as simple as a smile from the Prince, made him feel embarrassed.Pavel busied himself with sharpening the charcoal, ready to resume his sketch. The Prince was finishing off the whiskey, standing in front of the window that over looked the river. He then came round to stand behind the easel, playing with the remaining ice.\u201cKeep going,\u201d the Prince said, dissuading Pavel from putting down his palette knife.Bjorn looked over the canvas, then at the art supplies with an unenthusiastic eye. He was a man that moved slowly, took his time, as if enjoying a leisurely walk. It was only when he looked away from him, that Pavel realised he had broken his charcoal.Is Erna really happy with this man?As if to erase the question, Pavel focused on sharpening the charcoal he had just broke. The sound of Pavel sharpening the charcoal sounded more like he was sharpening the tension in the silent room, filled only with the sound of Bjorn\u2019s footsteps and the tinkle of ice in an empty glass.\u201cIt looks good,\u201d Bjorn said, nodding to the workbench.Pavel clenched his fists without realising it.\u201cThey were a gift from a very dear person to me.\u201d\u201cOh, a present?\u201d Bjorn said, passing a glance over the brushes and paints, back to Pavel. There was no emotion in his lethargic expression. Pavel swallowed dryly.\u201cHer Highness has returned,\u201d Lisa said as she opened the doors.Bjorn and Pavel both looked over just in time to see Erna standing in the doorway, with an awkward smile.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cOh my god, Your Highness.\u201dThe maids\u2019 startled cry roared up the spire at the west end of the palace. Erna looked back in shock, her hand freezing as it was withdrawing from a box of chocolates.\u201cOh, Karen, it\u2019s you.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI just wanted to get some fresh air,\u201d Erna smiled shyly.The setting sun filtered in through the spires\u2019 window. It cast reddened light across the room.\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I caused any trouble, I didn\u2019t think anyone would come up here. I didn\u2019t mean to cause any trouble.\u201d\u201cNo, Your Highness, you may go where you wish, but I didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d Karen sighed.When she had seen the doors of the spire had been left open, she thought that some of the servants who were secretly dating had come up here. She never expected to see the Grand Duchess.All too often Erna had been turning up in places Karen would never have thought to see her. The pottery room, the stairway to the coal bin, an abandoned well. Most of the places were remote enough that people did not frequent them unless necessary.This had all started about the middle of last month. She had asked to see the floor plans for the mansion, Karen brought them to her and Erna had poured over the plans for days.Did she hear us?Erna had gotten lost in the mansion several times and the servile staff had made fun of her about it, when they were sat in the lounge. They were not exactly quiet with their ridicule and laughter.What if she heard us and she tells the Prince?The young maids had looked at Karen with tears in their eyes.Don\u2019t worry about such pointless things.\u00a0Karen had told them.From then on, the Grand Duchess was never found lost around the mansion again. Instead, she had become like a ghost, suddenly popping up where she was not expected.\u201cIf you keep eating those chocolates\u2026It\u2019ll be bad for your health, Your Highness,\u201d Karen said to Erna.\u201cI\u2019ve not eaten that many.\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be eating them on a day like today, were you not ailed earlier?\u201dThe Grand Duchess had vomited after standing for the painter for so long. She was now hovering over a box of colourful chocolates like nothing had happened. Even when it was suggested that the painter come back another time, Erna insisted on getting the work done. She had a smile on her face, like she hadn\u2019t just voided the contents of her stomach.\u201cYour Highness, the necklace,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Erna stopped fiddling with the box of chocolates and gave Karen a quizzical look.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the nonsense people are saying. The staff were there, they knew the necklace was a gift from the Prince.\u201d Karen said, her throat becoming suddenly dry.All the servants who had been on the honeymoon knew that the diamond necklace had been a present from the Prince and had nothing to do with the whims of the Grand Duchess. The Grand Duchess was a noble lady, even if she lacked a little in the education of one, but she was definitely not one to enjoy frivolous luxury.Even if Erna had begged the Prince to get her the necklace, there would be no reason to criticise and probably wouldn\u2019t have, if it had been anyone other than Erna. She is his wife after all. No one would have taken issue with it.If not for the necklace, people would have looked for something else to criticise the Grand Duchess for. The shameless woman who took the position away from the more deserving Princess Gladys.Karen rarely felt at ease in this matter. She certainly felt like Gladys was the more deserving of the two of them, but she could see how uncomfortable the Grand Duchess was, when the Prince sent for the necklace and then put it on Erna\u2019s neck. Karen could vaguely guess the heart of the Grand Duchess in that moment.\u201cAre you worried about me?\u201d Erna asked with a gentle smile.\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you, Karen. Sincerely.\u201dErna took Karen\u2019s advice and began to wipe her hands with a handkerchief. Even if she had decided to eat the remaining chocolates, she would have only made herself feel more sick and she wouldn\u2019t be able to make dinner.Erna went back down the spire, clutching the half eaten box of chocolates. She had felt much better in the cool breeze and a stomach full of sweets. She had been so upset and depressed when she climbed the stairs.There were so many feelings swirling around her when she saw Pavel, but none of them she could express. She had to stick to formal greetings and conversations, it felt unfair to Pavel. She became more resolute in that feeling when Pavel left in the late afternoon. She was resentful of Bjorn for deciding to go with Pavel.She couldn\u2019t even reveal how she felt about that, because she didn\u2019t want to cause any misunderstanding. It was not only the reputation of herself and Pavel that would be damaged, but that of Bjorn as well and Erna did not want to be that kind of wife.It was okay for her to be ridiculed and ignored by everyone, she was able to endure it, as long as she was with Bjorn. If he could understand her true feelings, consider her a good wife and live happily for a long time, then she would be content.As she entered the hallway leading to the bedroom, Erna saw Mrs Fitz walking on the otherside.\u201cAh, there you are, Your Highness.\u201d Mrs Fitz stopped a few steps away and greeted Erna. Erna bowed her head in a corresponding greeting.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I left my seat.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s quite alright, Your Highness, I will get the maids to set your dinner.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll discuss that with Bjorn and decide.\u201dA flash of embarrassment appeared on Mrs Fitz\u2019s face.\u201cYour Highness,\u201d wrinkles fanned out from between Mrs\u2019 Fitz\u2019s brow, \u201cHis Highness has stepped out. He probably won\u2019t be back until late.\u201dIt was as unreal as the sunset that filled the hallway with golden light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe bedroom was locked in total darkness, even in the middle of the day, thanks to the blackout curtains.Bjorn laid on his bed, staring up at the ceiling. He didn\u2019t look at his watch, he sensed that it was around midday. There was no rush, there was nothing important going on today. Not unless Erna intended to bug him with something.He wondered what sort of mundane adventures that woman might have planned for them if he were to get up now. He let out a sigh and closed his eyes.He had decided not to go to his wife\u2019s room when he came back late last night, he figured it would be more comfortable for the pair of them. Erna would have hounded him too early in the morning, then chased him about the mansion, looking like she was about to cry.Even just thinking about Erna clinging to him constantly was enough to annoy, so he rang the service bell and started to rise from his bed. Feet barely touched the floor when the maids came rushing in, pulling aside the curtains and illuminating the bedroom with bright sunlight.Bjorn moved to stand in front of the window. The sun tickled his skin with warmth and it reminded him of Erna\u2019s touch. The second the woman crossed his mind again, he realised the mansion was uncharacteristically quiet.\u201cHas my wife gone out?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness,\u201d said the maid serving late morning, lunchtime tea.\u201cFor what?\u201d\u201cI do not know, Your Highness, I will go and check with Mrs Fitz.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d said Bjorn, taking up a tea cup, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201dThe rich aroma of the tea tickled his nose as he took a sip. The sun was warm, there was a pleasant scent of flowers on the breeze and the day was quiet, there was no need to go out and chase chaos, when the day started out so well.The morning felt like the time before Bjorn had decided to take a wife. Quiet, relaxed and everything done in his stride. He drank the tea, read the paper, then took a shower and sat at the breakfast table out on the balcony, smoking a cigar. He completely forgot about Erna.He was well aware that Erna was just an innocent woman, who followed him around like a newly hatched duckling. She always looked at him like he was the centre of the world. She accepted him as he was and understood him. He did not believe Erna had anything but love in her heart.Then he found himself thinking about the artist. His true intentions were unknown to him, but at least Erna was adamant that he was just a friend. The fact that he knew that all too well made him feel bad and he did not like that feeling one bit.Is this jealousy? Bjorn would ask himself that on occasion and each time he would laugh to himself. What has he got to be jealous of? He was friends with Erna, that was all, Erna is quite insistent on that fact. There was no need to be jealous.Tired of the thought, Bjorn decided to walk the gardens to clear his head. There was no use obsessing over this thing, there was not much that could be done about it.It was the kind of relationship where you just had to stick at it, enjoy your wife and love her as best you can. Don\u2019t put any unnecessary meaning to the bed feelings. Keep it light and fresh, like just another means of entertainment in his life.Bjorn plucked a ripe green and red apple from a tree and leaned on the railing that bordered the small stream that went down to the fountain. Its jets of water sparkled in the midday sun. Taking a bite of the apple, Bjorn let the acidic juices swell in his mouth and enjoyed the sweetness of it.The bad feeling that had been plaguing him since thinking about Erna and Pavel faded away like a dream and he was able to enjoy the splendid afternoon.Or so it would seem.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cIt\u2019s already that late?\u201d Erna said when realising the time.She had been talking none stop for two hours.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t want to take up too much of your time, I should be going.\u201d The young Grand Duchess said with wide eyes.\u201cHow long are you going to keep doing this?\u201d Duchess Arsene said, fixing Erna with a glare. She had been silent the entire time Erna was talking. Her white cat didn\u2019t seem to mind, curled up on the uninvited guests lap.It was toward the end of the last winter that Erna first started to invade the Arsene Duchy. She had only come to say hello and maybe talk about how great her honeymoon had been.Duchess Arsene did not like her eldest Grandson because he had turned a lifetime of pride, into a lifetime of shame. She hated her Grandson\u2019s bride even worse, as she felt the Grand Duchess was only trying to show off her position.The Grand Duchess had stayed for over two hours in the drawing room. Before leaving, she left a little gift, with a note to suggest she would be back next week.The Duchess Arsene had ordered it to be thrown away, she suspected that the Grand Duchess was trying to buy favour with expensive gifts, but when a maid emptied the box, the Duchess was surprised to find slippers, a shawl and a corsage brooch. Relatively ordinary looking gifts of very little value.What was more absurd was that the box next to it, a gift for Charlotte, the white cat, it contained a small pillow and a feathered fishing rod.She had originally thought that Erna was trying to play a little prank on her. That was until she heard Erna had given Philip a reading stand and Isabelle a pair of pruning scissors. It seemed like Erna completely disregarded the fact that they were king and queen, but considering their hobbies of reading and flower arranging, they were entirely appropriate gifts.She had laughed when she heard Erna had gifted Leonid a pair of glasses. It seemed like the woman was going out of her way to find gifts people would find useful. She laughed again and threw hers in the bin.She thought Erna was a snob, who secured the position of Grand Duchess by her looks. Now that she had come to know the girl, she seemed just that, a little child with barely an interesting side to her.It was only for that reason that she wanted to meed the new Grand Duchess in the first place, but now she was stuck meeting the girl every Wednesday, or so it would seem.\u201cI\u2019ll ask you directly, what are you intentions?\u201d\u00a0She said to Erna, before she left.The Duchess felt silly for being scared to ask the girl such a serious question. Whether she\u2019s unbelievably clever, or just an idiot with no plan, she was going to find out. Seeing the smile on the Grand Duchess\u2019 face made Arsene feel like the idiot.\u201cIts Bjorn\u2019s birthday in a couple months, I really want to invite you to dinner.\u201dHow could she have not known that that was such a rude request? Is this girl a monster or something?\u201cAre you sure? It has been years since I\u2019ve celebrated your husbands birthday.\u201d\u201cI know, but I still want to invite his Grandmother.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIts the first birthday present I want to give my husband.\u201dThis innocent looking girl, who was both an idiot and a monster, was declaring war with an angelic smile.\u201cDid your husband put you up to this?\u201dSurely this child couldn\u2019t have thought of such plot on her own. Or was she just intending to make fun of the Duchess of Arsene?\u201cNo, please, you must keep it a secret from Bjorn, it\u2019s to be a surprise.\u201dThe Grand Duchess gave such a thrilling answer, it broke the Duchess Arsene\u2019s fighting spirit. Then, for the last two months, she has been coming round, like clockwork, every Wednesday, disturbing her peaceful life.If she had locked her self away and not seen the Grand Duchess, she would probably have just sat and drank tea with the cat. When she did sit with her face to face, showing nothing but stern contempt, the girl would yammering on endlessly, mostly about her husband.\u201cI wont be able to breath until this birthday passes,\u201d the Duchess said.Charlotte stretched on Erna\u2019s lap, before moodily waltzing over to her cushion on the other side of the couch.\u201cHis birthday isn\u2019t just this year, Grandma.\u201dThe girl gave out such spiteful words, but her face remained placid and carefree. Was this why Bjorn had chosen this wife? Such a troublesome young girl.\u201cNever come again,\u201d the Duchess Arsene would say, as Erna left.\u201cSee you next week,\u201d the Grand Duchess would always reply.And so it was, that Wednesday\u2019s uninvited guest would come back each week, to harass the poor, old woman.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The whole basin of the Abit River had been dyed red, Erna saw, as she went over the Grand Duke\u2019s bridge in her carriage.Chewing on a lace of liquorice to sooth a sore throat, Erna gazed out at the scenery. The sky was painted red by the setting sun and with the water rose-coloured, she couldn\u2019t get enough of it. She was always like that, even thought she saw it every day, just like her husband.Soon she will be back at Schuber Palace, where her husband would hopefully be waiting, if he has not already gone out. Erna put up with it.Erna endured it. He would get up late, break his promises and head out to the social club. Drink and gamble until the earliest hours of the morning, stumble in drunk and sleep until the afternoon. Again and again, Erna endured it, but her husband had a talent for showing his affection when she most needed it and for that reason, she endured some more.Erna would repeatedly doze off and wake up, waiting for Bjorn to come home. She tried not to care if he came home or not and tried to get a good nights sleep, but she couldn\u2019t relax, sleeping alone in her bed.\u2018Bjorn, why can\u2019t you be a more stalwart husband? I don\u2019t like this.\u2019\u00a0she had said, when he finally came home, stinking of alcohol.\u2018Who do you think you\u2019ve married?\u2019\u00a0He swept his dishevelled hair back and looked at her with cool eyes, quite uncharacteristic of a drunkard.\u00a0Is it not funny to marry a prodigal son and expect a saint?\u2018That\u2019s not what I meant\u2026\u2019\u2018If you marry this kind of man, than you should love him anyway, is that not a wife\u2019s duty?\u2019\u00a0Bjorn said, coming closer to Erna with his head cocked, looking her up and down.He threw a sharp, mocking glance at Erna, laced with a friendly tone as if whispering love. He walked past her as if nothing had happened.Erna tried to be patient. Se was to see it through, somehow, but Bjorn had snapped her last nerve, broke her patience.\u2018You were supposed to sleep in my bed with me tonight.\u2019Looking at his back as he headed toward his bedroom, Erna summoned up the courage to face him. She hated him a lot at that point, but she didn\u2019t want to be shunned by him.\u2018Bjorn, we were supposed to share the same bed.\u2019Bjorn opened the door to his bed room with a sigh, went in and closed the door again behind him. Erna stood in the quiet corridor, alone, for a long time.Erna opened her eyes when the carriage came to a stop, she tried to erase the thoughts that swam endlessly around her mind. Today, she would understand if Bjorn wanted to spend all night drinking and playing poker, she hoped for it really.\u201cWelcome, Your Highness, the Prince is waiting for you,\u201d Mrs Fitz said.Of course, today would be the day the man didn\u2019t want to do anything he liked the most.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As always, Bjorn laughed it off.\u201cWhy, what did you get up to today?\u201d He hated it when Erna behaved like a sulky child.\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it, I too have a private life,\u201d she looked away from the dinner table.Bjorn finished up his dinner and the servants took the empty dishes away. He leaned on the back of the chair and watched Erna. She normally liked to make a fuss about her day, but she just stared at her plate as she ate, pretending she couldn\u2019t feel Bjorn staring at her.\u201cErna, you shouldn\u2019t waste your energy on such pointless things, you should concentrate on doing what makes you happy.\u201d It was a harsh remark, made to feel friendly by his soft tone and inviting smile.\u201cWhat do you think I should do? Am I some sort of doll that you can pose however you like, whenever you like?\u201d The words came with effort, but Erna let them come out.More and more it seemed like she didn\u2019t know Bjorn. He was a kind and considerate man at times, but now she could see that he probably didn\u2019t mean it, or did these things by accident. The closer she got to him, the more difficult he was. It felt like she was better off keeping Bjorn at a distance, remaining indifferent.\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea, why don\u2019t you try being that kind of wife?\u201d He titled his head slightly and wore a wicked grin on his face.\u201cNo,\u201d Erna said, standing up in a shot and throwing her napkin onto the table.She had wanted to resolve the awkwardness of the relationship, but she forgot she was dealing with a completely cold-blooded man. A poisonous mushroom.\u201cI know I\u2019m lacking in most areas, but still, I am trying to make an effort and I will continue to do so.\u201dIt had been almost half a year since they had gotten married, but she still thought of herself as that lost girl in a strange world. She believed she was getting better, but was she still lacking so much in his eyes? Or maybe it was simply because he never had any expectations in her in the first place.Although she was completely disillusioned with her efforts to please her husband, she still didn\u2019t want to become some emotionless doll that he could do whatever he wanted with.\u201cSit down, Erna,\u201d Bjorn said with a sigh.It was just like last night, he threw hurtful words and showed a strange joy on his face, like he was confirming that he had this woman\u2019s heart. That secret joy of his to see her shamed, like looking at her own bottom.\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d Erna said, rubbing her red eyes, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I am busy doing useless things.\u201d Erna bowed her head and left, stomping as she went.When she disappeared from view, Bjorn let out a dry laugh. The servant approached hesitantly and placed down a plate of pudding in front of Bjorn.\u201cNo, take it away,\u201d Bjorn said with a wave of a hand.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cDo you not have anything to say?\u201d Mrs Fitz asked Bjorn, as he sat at his desk with his nose buried in some important file. He did not respond. \u201cNo? I\u2019m just surprised to hear you and the Grand Duchess fighting.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s fighting?\u201d Bjorn looked up with a bland smileIt was funny to call that unprecedentedly fierce and bitter rebellion a fight. Erna was just being Erna, a woman who will smile like the sun again after a few jokes, a smile and a friendly kiss.\u201cYou are a good person, Your Highness, a better person with her at your side,\u201d Mrs Fitz spoke in a low voice.\u201cWhat a generous evaluation, from the strict Mrs Fitz.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just speaking the truth.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Bjorn nodded. Mrs Fitz looked at him anxiously.The former crown Prince and the Princess of Lars had such a perfect honeymoon. It was a quiet, elegant, peaceful time. It was not suitable for a young couple of that age, but they were the pride of Lechen and Lars.But was the marriage perfect?Mrs Fitz had often asked herself that question recently. The Prince she had known since he was a little child, seemed unfamiliar to her these days. She could not imagine him spending so much time fretting over his wife, only to throw it all away by arguing with her.Mrs Fitz looked at the Prince, then over to Erna\u2019s bedroom. Bjorn and Gladys used to be praised on how they seemed like an old couple, like they\u2019d been together for decades, it made her wonder.\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Mrs Fitz said impulsively, could he really have had an affair? \u201cNo, never mind.\u201dAs always, Mrs Fitz buried the question. It was not the kind of thing she could have brought up casually, even if it was the truth, or other truths existed. There was no way to find out, if he decided to hide, there was going to be no way to prise it from him.Bjorn got up from the desk and went over to the door to Erna\u2019s bedroom. The Prince Mrs Fitz had raised was such a gentleman and she loved him for that. He knocked confidently on the door.\u201cGo away,\u201d Erna shouted.Bjorn frowned and knocked again with more force, making the handle rattle.\u201cOpen the door, Erna.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to. My bed is expensive.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt means you can not come and go as you please,\u201d her cry was ferocious, like a beast.\u201cErna, you\u2019d better open this door.\u201dBjorn was laughing, more out of surprise and knocked on the door again. The harder he knocked, the louder Erna shouted and the dark, quiet halls of the Grand Palace was filled with the battle of newly-wed\u2019s. Surprised by the disturbance, maids and servants filtered out and gathered around to listen.\u201cYou really think I can\u2019t open this door if you don\u2019t open up?\u201dBjorn was no longer relaxed, or wore a smile like this was some big jest. The servants looked at each other, what were they going to do if the Prince asked for the key to the door?The Prince took a breath and calmed himself. He backed away from the door, but never once took his cool, cold eyes from the lock. He looked like a predator about to pounce and unless the servants intervened quickly, he was really going to open the door with a kick.\u201cWho do you think is going to lose out in the end, Erna?\u201d Bjorn shook off the servant holding him back.\u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly not going to be my loss!\u201dBjorn took a deep breath and swallowed dryly. It looked like he was controlling his anger, but anyone looking closer would be able to see the vein\u2019s popping in his head.\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you, so go away and before you even think of it, the couple\u2019s passage is also locked.\u201dThis woman\u2026she\u2019s out of mind.\u00a0Bjorn thought.This deer was definitely a mad.\u201cIf you don\u2019t open this door and come out right now, you\u2019ll never see my face again,\u201d Bjorn\u2019s was quite serious in his threat.\u201cWow, thank you so much for your consideration!\u201dThe onlookers witnessing the fight grew embarrassed and wondered if they should have given the couple space.\u201cIf you need a doll, go ask your nanny. A pretty doll, the ones that all the princes like!\u201d\u201cFine, let\u2019s see who will lose out in the end,\u201d Bjorn turned away from the door with a laugh.Surprised, the by-standers hurried back, lowering their eyes. There was only one, Mrs Fitz, who dared not move and looked at the prince.\u201cCongratulations on your first fight,\u201d she said. From his first cry, his first babble, or his first step, she always congratulated him on every Prince\u2019s \u2018first.\u2019\u00a0 \u201cDo you need me to fetch you a doll?\u201dBjorn\u2019s brow wrinkled at the question, it was a different look to the one he had just been wearing during the fight, like he was seriously considering it.After staring into space for awhile, Bjorn turned as if nothing had happened. He walked back to his room at a leisurely pace. His anger was still brimming on the surface, as he slammed his bedroom door.\u201cYup, he\u2019s our prince,\u201d someone muttered.\u201cWhy, were you expecting another Leonid?\u201d Mrs Fitz said.Some of the other servants muttered to themselves, or whispered to each other, \u201coh my god, that\u2019s our prince.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It really was the end of the world when they had to resort to revealing the winners and losers of the married couple fight.\u201cHey, Lisa, what about you?\u201d A maid asked Lisa with a bright face.It had been nearly a week since the first terrible fight between the Grand Duke and Duchess and in that week, they had not spoken to each other once.Lisa flashed a frown as she approached the table. Everyone here was betting on the prince, Lisa wasn\u2019t intending to bet, she was a self respecting person, but at the same time, she wanted to show support for her long time mistress.\u201cI bet for the Grand Duchess.\u201d Lisa put in, she felt bad for doing this, but she couldn\u2019t just watch Erna get ignored.The other servants showed sympathetic looks at Lisa, as her name was added under Erna, which had been empty up until that point. Lisa didn\u2019t have chance to say anything when the call bell the the Grand Duchess\u2019 room rang.\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should rest?\u201d Lisa said.Erna\u2019s complexion was worrying. Over the last few days, it seemed like her health was deteriorating, but Erna behaved like nothing was wrong. Other than looking pale, paler than normal, she didn\u2019t look like a person who had just emptied her stomach.\u201cI\u2019m okay, Lisa, I\u2019m resting.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure this counts as resting,\u201d Lisa added, worry all over her face.All about the desk Erna had been working at, scraps of cloths lay strewn out and half cut up. Erna was busy scissoring and judging by the shapes of the petal pattern she was cutting around, she was making a rose.\u201cBecause my mind goes all over the place when I\u2019m resting, I need to keep busy so my mind can rest,\u201d Erna smiled at Lisa, but didn\u2019t take her eyes from the cloth.Lisa looked at the piled up corsages already finished, the desk crammed with petals and the faint smile on Erna\u2019s face. She might be a petite woman, but she had the strongest spirit. It was clear that her idea of resting was very different from most.Erna put down her scissors and rubbed her red fingers. Then, after taking a sip of lukewarm tea, she picked up the scissors and resumed her work. Lisa could do nothing but help. Clearing away wasted material and bringing in fresh cloth. It felt like the time Erna was making corsages to raise money to pay off debts.\u201cYour Highness, if we sell this back to Mr Pent\u2026ah, you cant.\u201dThe excitement quickly dissolved as she took up a bunch of colourful corsages. It was quite impossible for the Grand Duchess to sell artificial flowers to department stores.At that time, they were in a situation where they needed money, but now that she was famous for being the Grand Duchess of Lechen, it might be considered unseemly. They could have sold the corsages under a pseudonym, but if anyone was to find out, well, the Grand Duchess had enough scandal to worry about.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give them to the maids?\u201d Erna said excitedly.\u201cWhy? All they do is gossip behind your back.\u201dThe corsages were beautiful and coveted by many. Lisa remembered well the face of Mr Pent when he found out Erna would no longer be providing them.\u201cThis precious thing,\u201d Lisa help up a rose corsage Erna had just finished, \u201chow much money would you get for selling this?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t sell them, but, why would the maids hate them?\u201d\u201cWell, they wouldn\u2019t, but why would you want to give them to people who only gossip about you?\u201d\u201cWe can give it to them as a present, Lisa, then they might realise that I am a good person, at least, a little bit.\u201dLisa felt only cynical answers come to the surface, but couldn\u2019t bear to say them out loud and just nodded at the Grand Duchess as she smiled. Anyone who didn\u2019t fall for her smile were evil people, the Poison Mushroom Prince especially so.\u201cWill you give a present to the prince too?\u201dAlthough she was desperate for the two to get along more than anyone, Lisa also wanted Erna to win this fight. It was sad to be in a position of unbridled love for a man, but resentful to lose the first fight.\u201cWhat was that, Lisa?\u201dErna had been so caught up in her flowers, practically face down on the desk, looked up at her maid, waiting for her to say those resentful words again.Although they had fought because they could no longer hold back their feelings, Erna didn\u2019t want this. On the first day, she felt relieved, on the second she grew worried and on the third, she slowly opened the door to her chamber. Had Bjorn been there, she was ready to pretend that he had won, but once more he showed his true face and was absent.Bjorn had never looked for Erna.He slept along, ate alone, went out alone and everything he did, he acted like he didn\u2019t have a wife back home. He acted like he was never going to see her face again. Their relationship had been stuck like this for over a week as Erna, who\u2019s pride had been hurt, responded in the same vain. The overly spacious palace made it easier for the pair to ignore and avoid each other.Erna took a sip of her tea as she began to feel nauseous again. She gathered together the finished corsages. Roses, Cherry Blossoms, Lilies of the Valley and orange flowers. The flowers almost seemed to bloom as they were disturbed.Lisa began to mix the flowers. Erna was much better at making artificial flowers, but Lisa was better at weaving them together.\u201cThe more I think about it, the more its just a waste. These are some of the finest corsages you\u2019ve made.\u201dWhile complaining, Lisa carefully made gifts for the other maids. The remaining flowers were also decorated on Erna\u2019s hat.Just as she tried on the hat, Mrs Fitz picked it up. Staring at the still, nervous people like children caught doing bad things, she began to report without much admonition.\u201cThe Royal Family will arrive at Schuber Palace in three days, before the opening ceremony. I got a call from the palace sayign that you don\u2019t have to prepare a separate meeting for that day. It is the will of Her Majesty the Queen that it will be enough to have the family together at dinner.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, then prepare the banquet dinner for that day according to Her Majesty\u2019s wishes,\u201d Erna said calmly.With the King and Queen, the couple had five children, Princess Louise and her husband and their young children. Adding Erna to the mix, the family would easily fill up the dinning room table.\u201cThis is the final guest list, please check it through,\u201d Mrs Fitz said.The Royal Family, including the King and Queen, would be staying at Schuber Palace for the World Expo opening ceremony. If it had not been for the fact that the twin princes birthday was only a couple days before the opening ceremony, they might have gone some where else, but for now, the banquet was under Erna\u2019s jurisdiction, being the hostess of the Palace. She was nervous.Erna went over the list very carefully and went on to discuss a few more. It was just as Mrs Fitz was leaving that the nausea came to Erna again.\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mrs Fitz, I\u2019ve been feeling quite nauseous recently.\u201d\u201cI will call a doctor,\u201d Mrs Fitz said.\u201cNo, there\u2019s no need, I have medication for stomach cramps,\u201d as Erna shook her head, Lisa was already coming up with the medication.\u201cDon\u2019t take that medicine,\u201d Mrs Fitz demanded, \u201cI will get the doctor to give you a proper check up, maybe its just symptoms of a stomach ache, but didn\u2019t you miss your cycle this month?\u201d\u201cMy, cycle? Oh\u2026\u201d Erna flushed with embarrassment.Erna\u2019s mind suddenly raced.Mrs Fitz turned to Lisa, who was desperately trying to hold back the desire to jump about and stamp her feet.\u201cGo to the housekeeper\u2019s office and tell her to call the doctor, now, Lisa.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*A dark brown stallion galloped through the forest.The powerful sounds of hooves echoed up and down the path, littered with new spring growth in full bloom. The hooves stopped only when it reached the end of the forest and overlooked Schuber Bay. The mane blustered and billowed in the fresh sea breeze.Bjorn got off the horse, took off his riding hat and breathed in the cool air. The calm sea glittered brightly with the light from the sun. It was a beautiful day and the perfect presentation of spring. Thick cotton clouds hung suspended in the azure blue sky. There was a sweet scent of blossom, the low buzz of busy bees and the chirrup of finches. Bjorn laughed at the fact that some people didn\u2019t like spring.The weather resembled Erna. When he roused in the morning and went out onto the balcony, he first got that thought, the start of an unlucky day.When the swear cooled, Bjorn got back on the horse. When he erased the thoughts of that woman, his day resumed its carefree calmness. Thanks to her, he had been enjoying riding out a lot more. He had nothing to lose.Two days ago, he had run into Erna, who had been out for a walk with her maid. Even when their eyes met, she didn\u2019t turn around and she was still entirely unforgiving. She simply held up her parasol to block their view of each other and carried on walking.She passed him by, lace and ribbons fluttering in the breeze as if trying to tease him. Bjorn sat on the horse for a long time, not moving and just griped the reigns tightly.Bjorn shook his head and erased the bad memory as he came into the garden. When he reached the front door of the Grand Duke\u2019s residence, the servants rushed out to greet him.\u201cYour Highness, it\u2019s the Grand Duchess, the medical examination has been done, you need to go to her.\u201d\u201cMedical examination?\u201dBjorn wore a frown on his face at the dumb grin on the servants face, he was fast becoming annoyed at the situation and as he was about to speak.\u201cCongratulations, Your Highness, you\u2019re about to become a father.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She thought about it a hundred times over already, but she could not focus her attention.\u201cDon\u2019t worry so much,\u201d Dr Erickson said.He offered Erna a kind smile. Had the situation been reversed, he would feel embarrassed too, so he did his best to reassure Erna.Mrs Fitz stood alongside the doctor. Lisa had been slowly backing away through the whole examination, had left the room a little while ago. Erna was relived that there was one less person in the room.\u201cI\u2019m very glad to report that there is nothing wrong with your body, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a given,\u201d said Mrs Fitz.Erna tried to smile as the two attempted to reassure her. She had thought she was pregnant, due to her nausea and being late for her period. Just as the doctor came to call, her period started. Erna stopped the examination for awhile and went to the bathroom. She couldn\u2019t believe the reality of the situation and felt embarrassed. She wanted to disappear like smoke.\u201cYou\u2019ve only been married for half a year, you\u2019re young and have plenty of time. There is no need to hurry,\u201d the doctor said, looking at Erna.Erna barely raised her head. She grabbed the quilt and pulled it up over herself. She felt like she wanted to cry because she was lying in bed as a patient, but at the same time, she was not a patient.\u201cHowever, I am worried about the constant stomach cramps and nausea. I\u2019ll prescribe a stronger medicine, but no matter what I give you, this is not something that will go away while you are under stress, so please take it easy.\u201dIt was clear that this was not pregnancy, but Dr Erikson expressed his intention to continue the examination. If the symptoms of vomiting are severe enough to be mistaken for morning sickness, then he needed to find the root of the problem.Erna let out a sigh of relief when the doctor packed up his medical bag. It was then that the door opened without warning. Bjorn revealed himself, the man who had shouted that Erna would never see his face again.He strode across the room and stood by the bed, his eyes were only ever on Erna. She faced him helplessly. There was no sign of the childish man who had gone to war with her, anywhere on his face.\u201cErna, is it true, are you pregnant?\u201dErna blinked at the suffocating feeling. Every time she closed and opener her eyes, it felt like her consciousness was flickering. It would be nice if she could just let go, she recalled when she had fainted from being proposed to, but it didn\u2019t go her way, which only deepened her despair.Bjorn, not getting an answer from the flushed Erna, looked over to the doctor and Mrs Fitz.\u201cPlease explain.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dAs Dr Erickson began to talk, Erna raised her hands and covered her face. She hated her husband, she really hated him.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna lay dead on her bed, staring up at the ceiling. Her pale complexion, white clothes and neatly stacked hands on her chest, she certainly seemed like she should be sleeping in a coffin.Bjorn sat back in a chair. The shadow of his lanky legs swayed in the dusk light. He pretended like there was nothing wrong. Erna stubbornly turned away from him.\u201cWhy are you still here? Go back to your own room!\u201dBjorn didn\u2019t move, he just carried on staring at Erna with a mocking smile.\u201cYou should be ashamed,\u201d she continued.She sat up in her bed, still not turning to face Bjorn. Her pyjamas were all crumpled and her hair was a mess. She saw no reason to look her best for a man she didn\u2019t even care about.\u201cYou\u2019re just mean, do you feel better now that you see me like this?\u201d\u201cNo, well, not yet.\u201d Bjorn tilted his head, \u201cbe more embarrassed.\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201d\u201cGet flushed and panicked, stomp your feet, you\u2019re good at that.\u201d\u201cNo, I won\u2019t! I\u2019m not embarrassed at all!\u201d Erna held her head up, as if reaffirming her resolve, \u201cit\u2019s not my fault, Mrs Fitz was the one that called the doctor and spread the rumour.\u201d\u201cOh, so you wish to blame others?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Erna shouted.Bjorn burst into laughter. No matter how his wife felt after her great disgrace, this commotion was amusing.Glaring at her husband with tears in her eyes, Erna also burst into laughter. Her stomach ached, her belly ached and she still didn\u2019t know why. Laughing, she suddenly felt better. It was probably all because of this man in front of her.\u201cI see.\u201d That was all Bjorn had said, when the doctor told him the full story. Erna was taken aback by his attitude, as if it wasn\u2019t such a big deal.When Bjorn stopped laughing, the silence came back. It was a soft silence, not as awkward as it had been before. It was a silence that seemed to be born from the inky darkness slowly permeating the room, so Bjorn got up and lit he bedside lamp.\u201cLie down Erna,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m not a patient, there\u2019s nothing wrong with me.\u201d\u201cDoes the cramps not hurt?\u201d He wore a warm smile.\u201cWell, at least I\u2019m not pregnant,\u201d she didn\u2019t mean for it to sound like a joke.She rubbed her hot cheeks and laid back down and pulled the blanket up over herself. She continued to stare up at the ceiling. After a long moment, she turned to look at Bjorn, who did not flinch when their eyes met. He was so mean, but he didn\u2019t look away.He was such an uncomfortable man who made her nervous all the time, but for some reason, when ever she was in trouble, it was him she would think about. The worst thing about it was that the person who embarrassed and upset her the most was Bjorn, but when he was around her, she felt better and at ease.\u201cSorry for causing a commotion,\u201d Erna whispered.They were married, they were husband and wife. She realised that when he came into the room. They got married, they\u2019re going to have kids one day and they will be parents. They will have to raise a family together. Holding his hand through this would mean so much.As she recalled all those emotions, she didn\u2019t want to continue on with this meaningless quarrel any more.\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d a small smile tugged at the corners of Bjorn\u2019s lips.\u201cBjorn, how did you feel when you heard the wrong news?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just curious about how you felt.\u201d\u201cWhat I felt\u2026\u201d Bjorn\u2019s eyes narrowed in thought.From the moment he heard the news, to the moment he came into the room was blank. In its place was the moment from four years ago. The disgusting smell of grass on the hot summer breeze. The suffocating knot of the tie around his neck. The shadows of strangely twisted objects and the smile of a father with his first child.Before opening Erna\u2019s door, he had stood there for a long moment, holding the door knob, not sure if he should even go in. He knew full well that it would not be the same as that day, but he couldn\u2019t shake the memory of it from his mind. He was annoyed at himself.Once he cleared the confusion was he finally able to open the door, only to face dejection at the fuss caused by Mrs Fitz over his wife\u2019s simple maladies.It wasn\u2019t something to get upset about though. The explanations from the doctor and Mrs Fitz was ridiculous, but he ignored them and concentrated on his cute wife. It all turned out to be a simple fuss on a beautiful spring day.Bjorn realised that there was a minor change from the events of four years ago, minor changes do exists.Congratulations, you\u2019re going to become a father.Even as he heard the greeting, he knew he was not the father, but today, he would have been. With that small change, he no longer thought back on that hot summer day, there was only Erna, her bashful cry, her languid body in the sunlight and her own laughter that permeated the landscape like a gentle breeze. One day, when he would hear that congratulations again, he will be the father. The father of the child the woman in front of him will give birth to.Bjorn lowered his eyes and faced Erna. Her nervous face considered him breathlessly, clutching at a pillow case.When he was the Crown Prince, he considered it part of the reasonability given to him, but now that he has come down from that position, it was not his job any more. He had married again and the supposition that a child would come along was only a matter of course.Actually, he still didn\u2019t know what being a father would be like, what he would truly feel. The only thing he did know was that he was curious. What would a child between Erna and himself be like?\u201cWell,\u201d Bjorn tried to express his thoughts with a laugh, \u201cget some rest, Erna.\u201d He stood up and leaned over to kiss his wife on the cheek. There was no longer any point in continuing any childish argument with his wife.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Nervous, Erna reached out and grabbed his hand as he turned away. He looked down at her, with his body turned away.\u201cYou said it was expensive, your bed.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201d\u201cBut?\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re rich.\u201dErna clutched his long smooth fingers more tightly. Quietly, looking down at the hand, Bjorn sighed and sat on the edge of the bed.\u201cWill you sleep here, with me?\u201d Erna looked at Bjorn with eyes filled with anticipation.\u201cIf you let me touch your chest,\u201d he whispered sweetly.Erna threw Bjorn\u2019s hand. The sound of slapping and giggling filled the soft darkness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since the spring came in full force, she had been spending most of her mornings out in the garden. Bjorn would wake up and find Erna missing from the bed, it was not very pleasant for him.Bjorn leaned on the railing of the bedroom balcony and watched Erna walk the path that connected the great fountain with the Abit River. Lisa was following behind as always, Erna\u2019s ever present shadow.The rich artificial flowers in Erna\u2019s hat were different from the ones she had yesterday, which were different from the ones she had the day before. She was changing those flowers every morning, before she went out for her walk. Somehow, he found that side of her was cute.Bjorn went back into the bedroom with a smile on his face and rang the service bell. Greg, the butler, came in with the morning paper and tea.\u201cYour Highness, a customer from the bank is waiting in the study,\u201d Greg said slowly.\u201cTell him I will be there as soon as my wife returns from her walk.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness, what time should I have the carriage ready to depart?\u201d\u201cEleven o\u2019clock would be good,\u201d Bjorn said, as he settled in to read the paper.Today\u2019s paper had an entire page devoted to talking about the strong alliance between Lechen and Lars. It was a fairly credible article, with quotes from the foreign minister of Lars.The King of Lars maintained a happy and stable relationship with Lechen, even after he failed to return Gladys to the throne. It would have been a huge dent to his pride, but he did not let that affect his relationship with Lechen.Bjorn liked this kind of relationship. The type where everyone maintains a friendly disposition to each other, so long as everyone gets their share of the pie.After reading through the few interesting articles in the paper, Bjorn went back out onto the balcony and fired up a cigar. The stone wall was warmed by the sun already, he leaned on it as he watched Erna climb the steps that led up to the mansion.Bjorn watched Erna carefully. Every time the wind gusted, her chemise dress clung to her body, revealing the welcome curves of her lovely body. Erna looked up at him, almost as if she sensed his lecherous study. How could such a small woman hold more presence than the Great Fountain, or any of the statues around it?\u201cOh, Bjorn, you\u2019re awake.\u201dHer voice echoed up to him and he smiled, letting out a thick puff of smoke that was quickly snatched away by the breeze. Their petty turmoil was a faded memory and his world was calm again.The spring morning seemed more beautiful and peaceful, after the fact. He waved to Erna as she climbed the steps leading into the mansion, admiring the fluttering tails of her ribbons and flowers.Bjorn unconsciously pulled on the cigar, the ash seemed to him like warm embers of falling snow, which fell quietly somewhere deep in his heart, in infinite silence.The cigar was stubbed out in the ashtray and Bjorn prayed that Erna would run into Mrs Fitz on her way up to the bedroom, realising that she would probably choke on the cigar smoke before it had a chance to be blown away.Despite the smoke, Erna would still stand by him and she would start getting an irritating, scratchy cough. Her lack of desire was more tolerable than a nerve-scratching cough.\u201cBjorn,\u201d Erna called out, knocking before coming into her own bedroom.Judging by the bright smile on her face, and glow, it would seem she was able to avoid Mrs Fitz and she came right up in front of him.\u201cLook at you, all worn out,\u201d Bjorn stroked Erna\u2019s cheek with the back of a couple fingers.The tips of his fingers brushed her cheeks and showed a little playfulness that was at odds with her calm expression.\u201cI think I need to work on my stamina though.\u201d\u201cStamina?\u201d\u201cWell, whenever we have sex, I would always fall right to sleep after, because I am so exhausted. I\u2019m a bit sorry for that,\u201d Erna said calmly. The corners of Bjorn\u2019s lips curled as he looked down at his shy, but brazen, wife.\u201cYou work so hard on everything you do, it\u2019s no wonder my shoulders are getting tired. I\u2019m starting to think I should exercise a little more too.\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to at all,\u201d Erna was still smiling, even as she acted serious.Bjorn laughed and let his wife go.\u201cGet ready, Erna, there is someone you need to meet.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*All she got for emptying the cookie jar was a thin stack of papers that looked like a small book. She looked at the bankbook in her hand with a frown. It had her name on it and the amount of money that had been deposited, but she couldn\u2019t believe that this little booklet was replacing all her money.She knew that people in the city liked to keep their money in the bank, but she never thought she would be one of those people, not until Bjorn introduced her to the Freyr Bank employee in her study.Erna looked at her empty cookie jar regretfully. It had been a memento from her time before she knew Bjorn and the circumstances that had led to their marriage. It was a symbol of her past efforts and a promise she had made.When the banker concluded the business and stood to leave with Erna\u2019s savings, she let out a sad sigh.\u201cDon\u2019t you like your new cookie jar?\u201d Bjorn said, motioning to the bankbook.Bjorn sat with his arms loosely crossed. Erna looked at him, then to the bankbook, then back at him again, then nodded a little.\u201cI liked the old way better, can\u2019t we get it back?\u201d\u201cNow Erna, you need to let go of the cookie jar and embrace civilised society.\u201d\u201cBut this paper doesn\u2019t look like money at all.\u201d\u201cNo, but it represents your money, see, your name here?\u201d\u201cEven so, what if the bank misuses my money, what if they lose it, what if they don\u2019t give it back to me?\u201d Erna looked at Bjorn with mistrust in her eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t fret, they won\u2019t keep your money from you.\u201d\u201cWhat about if they go bankrupt? I heard that\u2019s another way people end up losing their money.\u201dErna became more serious, concerned that the bank would go bankrupt and completely oblivious to the fact that the owner sat right next to her.\u201cIt\u2019s good to have that suspicion, Erna, I don\u2019t think you will ever get scammed,\u201d at the mention of getting scammed, Erna\u2019s eyes went so wide.\u201cCould you please not say that? I really hate that word,\u201d when Erna looked at Bjorn with a stern face, Bjorn became mischievous.\u201cOh, you don\u2019t want me to say scam? Is scam a painful word for you, Erna? I guess I can stop saying scam.\u201d\u201cBjorn,\u201d Erna pouted.\u201cIf the bank goes bankrupt, I will make sure you get your money back first, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dFrom the accusations of being a petty thief, to being called a scam artist, Bjorn felt like his pride should be bruised, but he understood Erna\u2019s concerns. There was no reason that he should not be showing a little more tolerance, as this had been a gift for Erna.\u201cYou just need to get yourself more acquainted with your new cookie jar, trust me, it will be a lot better, and easier, than the old cookie jar,\u201d Bjorn looked at his rival, the cookie jar, with a sullen expression. The snowman was still smiling at him and it seemed a lot more menacing. \u201cYour snowman might keep your money in one place, but the new cookie jar will increase in value.\u201d\u201cReally, I will be getting more money?\u201d Erna\u2019s eyes went wide, \u201cwill I really get more money, even if I leave it alone?\u201dErna clearly had no clue about interest rates. She looked at him with a mixture of surprise and doubt. Bjorn started to wonder about the place Erna had grown up, had they really raised such an ignorant lady?Calmly, Bjorn went on to explain deposits and interest rates. Erna listened to him intently, with wide, wondrous eyes and a desire to learn. When he was done, Erna was so excited and decided that she was going to hang her bankbook next to her bed.\u201cThank you Bjorn, I will cherish it,\u201d Erna smiled brighter than ever.She packed her bankbook into the snowman cookie jar. It seemed like she was still too stubborn to completely abandon that jar.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you use the safe and leave that old thing?\u201d\u201cIt might be old, but it\u2019s precious to me. I don\u2019t want to throw it away, it was a gift from my Grandfather,\u201d Erna carefully placed the jar in her lap, \u201che got it for me when I was eight years old, the first birthday after my mother passed. He said he wanted me to smile just like the snowman on the cookie jar. We went outside and made a snowman just like this one,\u201d she patted the battered tin lid and smiled just like the snowman. \u201cIt\u2019s more precious now than ever. The snowman has melted away and my Grandfather is no longer here. I want to keep this by my side for as long as possible.\u201d Even as Erna shared her heartbreaking memory, she kept smiling.Bjorn felt a little embarrassed, he could not expect Erna to throw the cookie jar away now and so simply nodded.Eight years old.The words lingered in his ears for quite some time. He already knew Viscount Hardy\u2019s ex-wife had died, but hearing how old Erna was at the time, filled him with melancholy.Abandoned by her father, only to lose her mother soon after. Come to think of it, she has had a pretty sad life. Although she was saddened by her past, she rarely seemed to let it affect her as she always wore a smile.\u201cOh, Bjorn, isn\u2019t it time for you to leave? You said you had a meeting with the directors of the bank.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I might cancel,\u201d Bjorn leaned back against his chair.\u201cWhat, why?\u201d\u201cEven if I did nothing, I feel you would happily busying yourself with making your flowers and feeding me.\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d Erna got up and shook her head violently, \u201cgo, work hard and earn me lots more interest.\u201dBjorn laughed, seeing the resolute ambition of his wife.\u201cGo, now, before I send for Mrs Fitz.\u201dBjorn couldn\u2019t stand the pressure from his wife and the horrid threats she was making. As always, Erna escorted him out to his carriage. Bjorn felt like she was making sure he was heading off to the meeting. He had created a monster.He had to use this to his advantage, teasing her with interest whenever he wanted her to do anything dirty.\u201cBye,\u201d Erna said.Bjorn looked back at her from the carriage and saw a baby deer waving at him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cNot too long ago we had our first fight,\u201d Erna was saying, bringing up the shameful event.Duchess Arsene looked up from the book she had been reading for the first time since Erna had arrived, right on time for her Wednesday intrusion. Erna had been talking nonstop for the last hour and showed no signs of slowing.\u201cI\u2019m guessing you were horribly defeated.\u201d\u201cNo, Grandma, I think I won, but not on purpose.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cReally. The maids and servants had placed bets on who would hold out the longest. My maid, Lisa, was the only one to choose me and because everyone bet on Bjorn, like you Grandma, Lisa won a very sizeable pot, she even bought me chocolates to say thank you.\u201dThe Duchess saw the proud smile on Erna\u2019s face and knew it to be true. She laughed at the ridiculousness of it.It was clear that Erna had no chance of being a dignified princess, talking about marital problems to others. Not like Gladys, she would never have shared the details of any argument with Bjorn. She was certainly proving to be not as fun as Erna.Erna slowly began to open up and share details about the fight. The Duchess closed her book and placed it on the table, along with her reading glasses. Charlotte sauntered over from looking out of the window sill and settled on the Duchess\u2019 lap.As the Duchess listened to the story, she stroked Charlotte, who purred in satisfaction. It did not seem like a very dignified thing to do, to share the details of the fight and by the end of it, even though Erna had won, it felt like Erna was not in a favourable position.\u201cMy dear, why do you like Bjorn so much?\u201dErna was stunned by the question and looked at the Duchess, not entirely sure how to respond. The Duchess looked at her with lazy, sleepy eyes, which looked just as Charlotte did.All these stories Erna had shared with the Duchess, made the woman think that Erna had a very deep crush on her husband, but her husband did not share the same feelings. It seemed like a very one sided relationship.\u201cFor most men, it\u2019s all about the looks, a man is nothing but a face and your husband is very gifted in this regard.\u201d\u201cUm, yes?\u201d Erna didn\u2019t know if she should agree or question.The statement came very unexpectedly. The Duchess rarely contributed in the conversations, so to be hit by such words, true as they were, was still shocking to hear.\u201cJust because a man seems pleasant enough on the outside, does not mean he is pleasant on the inside. There is no universal law that dictates that something bad on the outside, is bad on the inside, or vice versa. It\u2019s always best to try and get yourself a man that\u2019s at least handsome on the outside, so then if he turns out bad on the inside, at least he\u2019s good looking.\u201dErna never expected the Duchess Arsene to say such a thing, or any noble lady for that matter, but even still, the Duchess spoke on as if idly talking about the weather.\u201cA handsome face alone can bring joy and that joy can help to create patience. I\u2019m sure you understand well enough, being with Bjorn and all.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Grandma, I\u2019m not like that.\u201d\u201cSure, but don\u2019t expect too much from him, otherwise, you will have more of these arguments and inevitably he will get bored of you and the constant fighting.\u201dErna grew anxious as the Duchess speared her emotions with the sharp words. She thought she knew the Duchess quite well, but it seems like her arrogance has only bred ignorance. There was quite the disparity between this urban Grandmother and her own rural Grandmother.There was something about the old woman that reminded Erna of Bjorn. She thought it would be enough to give her strength to come and face her week after week.Embarrassed, Erna looked out of the window. She imagined all the things that Bjorn had done that had upset her and realised the deeds fit another face. She became angry at herself for having such a snobbish side to her. Baroness Baden would have freaked out, if she knew what Bjorn was really like.\u201cI can see that I am right, am I not?\u201d A mischievous smile came across the Duchess\u2019s face, a smile that reminded Erna of Bjorn.\u201cActually, yes, it is a bit like that,\u201d Erna murmured, cheeks blushing.The Duchess looked bewildered at Erna. She had been fun to tease, but looked all too seriously out the window. She had been caught off guard with the Duchess\u2019 statements. That was wholly unexpected.The Duchess burst into laughter, which scared Charlotte, who jumped off the Duchess\u2019 lamp and dove under the sofa. The laughter reverberated all about the guest parlour.She thought that Bjorn had reached rock bottom and was plumbing the depths for anyone that would marry him. At least, it seemed like he made the choice out of desperation and was just giving up.The Duchess smiled for a long time while looking at Erna. She got up from the couch and brushed Erna\u2019s cheek with a hand.\u201cWhat are you staring at, so far away?\u201d The Duchess asked.Erna simply looked at her, with sad eyes. The Duchess Arsene clucked her tongue and left the guest parlour. Erna followed in her footsteps quietly contemplating.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The room was decorated with light green wallpaper, where it could be seen in between all the portraits and pictures. It felt like this room was an exhibition, recording an entire family history.Erna followed on after the Duchess Arsene with a little excitement. This was the first time she had seen anything of the mansion beyond the guest parlour.\u201cIs this the Duke of Arsene?\u201d asked Erna, carefully.She stood before a large portrait that hung in the middle of the wall. The Duchess nodded as she came to stand next to Erna, the resemblance to Bjorn was uncanny.\u201cI was quite the famous beauty when I was younger. I was getting proposals from all over the world.\u201d\u201cFrom all those suitors, Duke Arsene must have been the finest of them all. He\u2019s certainly made a good first impression. He must have had a great personality.\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s just say I was luckier than you,\u201d the Duchess said playfully, moving away to the next painting.They moved around the gallery slowly and Erna took in so many faces. There was even one of Queen Isabella and her children when they were much younger.\u201cAh, Bjorn,\u201d Erna said, recognising the twins in the picture.\u201cCan you guess which one he is?\u201dErna became serious and studied the painting. It was very difficult to tell when they were so young, but the Duchess took Erna around to other paintings made as the twins grew up. She could see their personalities come through as they aged and Erna was able to accurately guess which one was her husband.\u201cNo matter how much a man is a face and you like that face, you must not openly show your feelings. Your husband is very good in this regard. You have to learn how to hide that you like them.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Erna asked, confused.\u201cIt means pushing, when you need to push and pulling when you need to pull. Right now, Erna, all you\u2019re doing is pulling, giving Bjorn what he wants.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cReally, child, did you get married to a man without ever having been in a relationship before?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, Grandma?\u201d Erna said, looking down at her feet like she was being punished.\u201cFoolish girl,\u201d the Duchess said, clicking her tongue once more and turning back to the paintings.The Duchess took Erna back to the guest parlour, where they finished their tea and bid their farewells.\u201cSee you next week at the palace, Grandma.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d the Duchess said sternly.\u201cOf course, see you then, Grandma.\u201dThe foolish child smiled brightly as she left, leaving the foolish statement in her wake.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*After getting ready ahead of schedule, Erna made her way along the couples passage to Bjorn\u2019s room. Her mind was wonderfully clear, though the worry of welcoming guests had kept her awake.\u201cBjorn?\u201d Erna cautiously peeked around the door. Bjorn was standing in front of a mirror, with servants around him, getting him ready, all looking at her. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d\u201cLooks like you already have,\u201d Bjorn laughed.The servants continued getting Bjorn ready as Erna came all the way into the room. Erna looked at her husband from a safe distance from the servants who were constantly in motion. He was wearing a tie and was choosing which cufflinks to wear.\u201cI think this one would be better,\u201d Erna said.She thought it would have been best not to interfere, but she couldn\u2019t help herself. The onyx that Bjorn had picked out were lovely, but she wanted him to wear matching jewellery as her.Bjorn changed his mind and put the onyx back, picking up the blue sapphires. Erna looked at her husband and her eyes sparkled along with the sapphires.They were to welcome the royal families that were coming to the grand opening ceremony of the World Exposition. They would also be staying to celebrate the birthday of the twin princes a couple days after. The thought that her reputation rested on how she spent the next week made Erna nervous.Bjorn\u2019s preparations were finished just as soon as a servant presented Bjorn with his jacket and gently placed it on his shoulders. Bjorn stepped away from the mirror and approached Erna. He really was more handsome than his Grandfather.\u201cI think what the adults say is mostly right,\u201d Erna whispered under her breath, as she took Bjorns outstretched hand.\u201cWhat?\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cNo, nothing, let\u2019s go,\u201d Erna said, blushing a little.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He left with a sulky face.Isabelle Dniester smiled like she knew and pointed to the furthest seat. It was next to Princess Greta, who was daintily sipping at her tea. The prince sighed as if displeased with having to sit next to his younger sister, but he obeyed his mother.Erna watched the Dniester family with curiosity. The Queen and Princess Louise were enveloped by quiet conversation. Princess Louise\u2019s children, a boy and a girl, were being looked after by their nanny. Prince Christian, who was frustrated at still bring treated like a child and Princess Greta, who was just having fun.All these faces, that all had some resemblance to one or two of the others made Erna feel a little left out. There was no one here of her family and she realised she missed her Grandmother very much. People had said that Erna bore a very close likeness to her Grandmother.\u201cNo, leave that lady\u2019s dress alone.\u201dErna looked down to see Princess Louise\u2019s daughter clutching at the hem of her lacy dress, where gold thread made strange patterns. The nanny was rushing over.\u201cLeave her alone, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d the nanny said.Erna laughed and stopped the nanny. The child watched her with rolling eyes and a bright smile. Erna thought she looked like Duke Heine, Louise\u2019s husband, but the smile was definitely from the child\u2019s mother. The same smile all the Dniesters seemed to have inherited.Erna looked at the tiny, chubby hands that were playing with the patterns of her dress. The little girl had peachy cheeks and fine hair tied up with ribbons. This was actually the first time Erna had encountered such a small child. She was nervous because she didn\u2019t know how to act around the toddler.\u201cHello,\u201d she said to the little girl.As their eyes met again, Erna smiled awkwardly. The child looked at Erna with big, blank eyes and tried to wave. Her hands were like a maple leaf and Erna\u2019s smile was as bright as the child\u2019s.Erna let the little girl play with the hem of her dress to her hearts content. Then she began pulling on Erna\u2019s hand, as if trying to lead her somewhere. She pointed to a palm tree on the other side of the room.Erna got up and slowly walked the child around the room to the palm tree. Isabelle watched the pair from over her fan. Louise, realising who her child was with, called for the nanny.\u201cLet them be, Louise,\u201d Isabelle Dniester said.Erna and the child stood before the palm tree and Erna listened intently to the little girls mumbles and chatter. The whole thing made Isabelle giggle.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you are so lenient with the Grand Duchess, mother,\u201d Louise said, disappointingly.\u201cIs there a reason not to be?\u201d\u201cWell, no, but\u2026\u201d Louise swallowed Gladys\u2019 name and sat tight lipped.Erna was now holding the child in her arms. It disgusted Louise, to see Erna do something she did not want her to do, just to satisfy her mother. Erna circled around the room, bringing the child wherever she pointed. It was a shameless display, like Erna didn\u2019t know what she was doing to get all the attention.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you loved children,\u201d Louise said to Erna, when she came back with her daughter. Louise sat the little girl on her lap, \u201cis there any news of your having children yet?\u201d\u201cLouise, shush, they\u2019re still newly-wed,\u201d Isabelle said.\u201cBut now is the time, Gladys came back from her honeymoon with news of her pregnancy already.\u201d The mood in the room stiffened as Louise let slip the name.Louise realised that she had slipped up and looked at Erna, who looked startled. Louise had just crossed the line, she would have placed the blame on the pressure from her mother, who seemed to be taking Erna\u2019s side.\u201cThat\u2019s rude, Louise,\u201d Isabelle Dniester said in a low voice that broke the delicate silence. \u201cApologise, now.\u201d\u201cMother.\u201d\u201cNow, Louise.\u201dDespite her daughters stubbornness and stern look, there was not a child alive that could stand up against their mother. Christian and Greta had stopped their conversation and where looking upon the scene with a sigh.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026sorry,\u201d Louise said reluctantly, \u201cI spoke without thinking, please forgive me Grand Duchess,\u201d Louise\u2019s face wrinkled in humiliation.\u201cOh, no, I\u2019m fine, it\u2019s really alright,\u201d Erna flustered, not sure what she should do.\u201cThank you for understanding,\u201d Louise said.It was only when Erna met her pleading eyes, that she finally showed a smile.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for my daughters rudeness,\u201d Isabelle added with soft words.Word came in that the business the men were conducting in the study was nearly concluded. It was time for the Dniester family dinner.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cI think our father has changed his mind for sure, too.\u201d Leonid said.With narrowed eyes, Bjorn hit the ivory ball and watched it roll down the table with narrow eyes. It looked to be slightly out and his six ball streak came to an end.\u201cThat reading table, father kept it and uses it regularly,\u201d Leonid continued with a flat expression. He seemed like someone unconcerned with how far behind he was on the score board.\u201cReading table, the one Erna got him?\u201d Bjorn chuckled.At first, Bjorn had thought the gifts she had bought were ridiculous, but it turned out that they were very well received. His mother had even praised Erna for the gift of the pruning scissors, saying that she uses them very carefully. It seemed like a deliberate compliment at the dinner party. It made Erna quite happy.\u201cHis Majesty the King of Lechen is easily swayed with gifts,\u201d Bjorn said, watching Leonid line up a shot.The ball rolled down across the table and Bjorn could see that it was a perfect angle and as he took a sip of brandy, Leonid sunk a ball and scored.\u201cThe Grand Duchess seems like a nice enough person,\u201d Leonid said.\u201cI distinctly remember the Crown Prince saying he did not like Miss Hardy. It felt like a very firm opinion at the time,\u201d Bjorn said, puffing out smoke from a cigar.\u201cYes, I thought so at the time, but that was only because I did not know the Grand Duchess.\u201d\u201cWell, I must say that I am glad you have corrected your opinion,\u201d Bjorn said, laughing.Leonid closed the gap by scoring four more points, before missing his next shot and conceding the table to Bjorn.Bjorn took one last sip of brandy before taking up his cue. Even though he had drunk a fair bit already, it was hard to detect any drunkenness in him. Given how much he usually drinks, it was fair to say this was nothing more than pre-dinner drinks.The Grand Duchess was doing her best for her husband. Those who supported the ill-fated Crown Princess Gladys thought it only a myth and tried their best to ignore it. But any one with eyes could see.When Leonid\u2019s turn came back around, he calmly grabbed the chalk and went on to win by three points. Bjorn accepted the miraculous defeat graciously. It was only a friendly game, so nothing to worry about. His twin was obsessed with winning more than he was.\u201cSince you got yourself a good wife, have you thought about becoming a good husband?\u201dBjorn frowned deeply at Leonid, who had put his spectacles back on.\u201cAren\u2019t you the one who asked me to play billiards so I had to leave my wife in another room?\u201d Bjorn puffed out a few smoke rings from his cigar.Leonid sighed and sat down at the table opposite his brother, giving him a stern look. It was him who always invited Bjorn to play billiards, when he wanted to discuss matters of state and importance. He was well known for it.\u201cSo what are you doing now? The game is finished, are you not going back to your wife?\u201d Leonid said, feigning scorn.\u201cYou have no alcohol left, Your Highness,\u201d Bjorn filled their empty glasses with a shake of his head and a smile.\u00a0 \u201cThe Bald Eagles have broken their stubbornness,\u201d Bjorn said raising the glass, \u201cthey will not touch the government interest rate, or the tax on securities.\u201d\u201cWhat do they want in return?\u201d\u201cWell, it would be most urgent for them to resolve the fiscal deficit with Lechen\u2019s funds. Apparently they want to sell the northern railway, unless you have another card to play. What we\u2019re going to give and what we will receive in return, that\u2019s between you and Maxim.\u201d Bjorn put the cigar back into this mouth after patting away the ash. It was a casual gesture, as if to say it wasn\u2019t his problem any more.Leonid no longer asked. He knew well enough, Bjorn didn\u2019t like to get involved in things that weren\u2019t his business. Given Bjorn\u2019s attitude and the information he brought from last visit, he probably already had a plan of action.\u201cI\u2019m suddenly curious,\u201d Leonid explained, deep in thought, \u201cif you added that bank job to the trips schedule, what the hell did you do on your honeymoon?\u201d\u201cI took care of business, if you would care not to pry, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cBjorn, I think you should\u2026\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s my wife, Leonid,\u201d Bjorn cut him off with cold words, \u201cI know her better than anyone and I\u2019m actually a pretty good husband, when you get to know her and her needs.\u201dLeonid stared at Bjorn for a long moment, then laughed at Bjorn\u2019s words, as if they had been sharing crude jokes.Leonid put down his half empty glass and let Bjorn top it up. He thought about Pavel Lore, randomly and it deepened Bjorn\u2019s mood.\u201cWhy?\u201d Leonid asked sullenly, holding up the glass.\u201cJust because,\u201d Bjorn sat obliquely against the back of his chair and sucked the last of the cigar, \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time dealing with her.\u201dBjorn exhaled smoke that obscured him briefly and as the smoke dissipated, Leonid looked into his blank face. He ended up laughing at his brothers deadpan expression.\u201cWhat? You\u2019re crazy.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The people lined the streets and filled the squares, their cheer shook the very earth and the heavens.Erna looked about the crowds from the open top carriage, over whelmed by the sheer amount of people. There was quite the crowd on her wedding day, but now there seemed to be three times that number. There was more royal guard escorting them too, making the atmosphere even more majestic.The cavalry marched in step with the horses of the wagons. All the nations flags hung from windows and lamp posts. Erna took in all the sights until her gaze rested upon Bjorn, who looked as unconcerned as always. Prince Christian and Princess Greta looked the exact same and Erna remembered the type of family she had married into.Erna struggled to catch herself and correct her posture. She had to force herself to sit still and she even raised a hand, but didn\u2019t yet find the courage to greet the people properly.One year at most. The Prince\u2019s mistake. A poor substitute for Princes Gladys.She thought she could hear the crowd call out at times. They were the words that came to her, even though she didn\u2019t want to hear it and she definitely didn\u2019t want to keep them in her heart.Erna finally lowered her hand, unable to greet the crowd that seemed to dislike her so. None of the cheer in the crowd was directed at her.By the time Erna could smile naturally again, she found herself outside the entrance to the fair ground, built along the river bank. It was a grand structure of steel frames and glass arches that glittered brightly in the sun. She was overwhelmed by the spectacle of it all and next thing she knew, she was sitting on a platform in the centre of the fair ground. She sat perfectly behind the king.Erna looked around the fair ground. Display halls and exhibits branched off from the central aisle, which stretched from the entrance, all the way to the large Elm tree at its centre.Only VIP\u2019s got an invite to the opening ceremony, but there was still a large number of people. Their blurring faces made Erna dizzy.Erna looked about he exhibits in wonder and before she knew it, she came to the second floor where she saw Princess Louise. Erna gave her a warm smile, but Louise turned away without so much as an acknowledgement. She whispered something to her husband and Erna turned away, flush with embarrassment.Bjorn was leaning in close to his brother, sitting next to him. Erna, who had been watching him closely, gently shifted her cautious gaze to Leonid.Mrs Fitz had urged several times that she should not confuse the Grand Duke with the Crown Prince and although Leonid wore glasses, that was not always the case. She should not assume the one without glasses is Bjorn.Looking at them from this close, Erna could understand Mrs Fitz\u2019s concern. It was surprising how the two looked so similar, enough to confuse anyone who gave the two princes a casual glance.Just as Erna was studying the two princes, Leonid looked at her. Their eyes met and Erna swallowed dryly. Bjorn also turned his head and Erna was seeing double. She blinked rapidly, trying to figure out who was who.Erna was afraid that Leonid would look down at her again, but instead, she was greeted with a warm smile. At the same time, Bjorn also smiled at her, his was the usual, cock sure, arrogant smile she had seen a thousand times.Their smiles looked the same, but felt totally different. Even without glasses, Erna felt sure she would be able to tell the two apart. At that moment, a cheer broke out amongst the crowd.Erna hurriedly got up from her seat, following Bjorn and joined in the applause. The King was about to give his opening speech.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Philip III was famous for his natural oratory skill. He opened the Schuber Exposition with a speech that drew out the enthusiasm of the crowd. As the largest participating country of the fair, that contributed the most innovative technologies, all the crowd was excited to see what was on display, the Grand Duchess more than anyone.Bjorn looked down at his wife with a smile. Her eyes were so big and bright with curiosity, even as she tried to preserve at least some dignity.When it was time to take the commemorative photo, Bjorn quietly escorted his wife over, who had been busy looking over the exhibition halls on the second floor.The Grand Duke and his wife were the last couple to join the group for the photo. It was a composition of five siblings lined up with the king and queen sat front and centre. Erna stood alongside Bjorn, behind the queen.Erna looked at the assembled people, they all had platinum blonde hair. The Duke Heine, Princess Louise\u2019s husband, was also blonde, though it was a little darker. So had been Princess Gladys.The whispered words of the servants of the Palace always said that the royals preferred people with blonde hair, to maintain the same hair colour for generations and maintain the symbol of the Dniester family.Even her hair didn\u2019t fit in here.It was such a meagre thing to get worked up over, but for some reason, the thought of it stuck in Erna\u2019s heart. She tried to ignore it, but it was always there, niggling at the back of her mind.Erna tried to ease her beating heart, but even as she tried, she noticed other little things, like how everyone of the Royal Family were far taller than her, even the women. She felt like a weed surrounded by trees.A misplaced marble\u2026She suddenly felt sad because she didn\u2019t fit in anywhere. Princess Gladys did, she melded into the royal family with ease, she had confidence and was beloved by the people.\u201cGet ready,\u201d the photographer said.Erna opened her eyes, which she had been squeezing shut against the barrage of doubt and sat up straight. After much consideration, she lifted her heels so that she raised up on tiptoes. As she rose up, Bjorn noticed and placed a hand on her shoulder, pressing her down.Erna tried her best to push against his pressure, but it wasn\u2019t easy to match his strength. It would be nice if he just pretended he didn\u2019t notice, he was such a cruel man at times. Erna eventually gave up and stood properly.\u201cOne,\u201d the photographer went under the black cloth, \u201ctwo,\u201d Erna moved in close to her husband, \u201cthree.\u201d At that moment, she raised her chin, instead of her heels and the flash popped.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Once the opening ceremony was done, the crowds moved around and explored the exhibitions freely.Erna followed her husband around. After moving past a huge steam engine that was said to be powering the whole fair, they found themselves at an exhibit of industrial machines that were moving by themselves.It was so bizarre to see so much stuff made of metal, but Bjorn seemed quite happy. He spoke to the director of each exhibit, asking them a myriad of questions about how they expect their inventions to fit into society and how they will change the world. They said words Erna had no understanding of, but she listened attentively.\u201cPeople these days make everything with machines,\u201d Erna said, noticing a machine that was playing music.It was a small machine called a phonograph and it imitated the sounds of a piano. It was amazing, but at the same time, a little creepy. Bjorn decided that he wanted to buy it.After examining more machines, Bjorn led Erna to something called a telephone. It was said that it would allow people to talk to each other over large distances, but she couldn\u2019t understand it.\u201cWould I be able to talk to my Grandma too?\u201d Erna asked.She had been staring at the telephone for a long while. It was the first thing Erna showed any proper interest in since coming into the machine hall.\u201cIt will take awhile for the telephone line to get there,\u201d the man in charge of the exhibit said.\u201cYou can\u2019t talk without that line?\u201d Erna asked, the man nodded. \u201cI see.\u201dAfter that, Erna did not show much interest in the telephone any more. Even though Bjorn was showing her all these amazing inventions, it seems like she was still stuck in her rural lifestyle.By the time Erna was getting bored of the exhibits and inventions, they arrived at a both that had been set up by a type writing company. Without even realising, Erna was frozen to the spot and looked at the new type writer developed using Lechen\u2019s technology. Bjorn almost missed Erna stopping.\u201cWhat\u2019s up, do you want to become a typist?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Erna said, turning her head but not looking away from the woman demonstrating the type writer. \u201cThe machine is writing so fast.\u201dErna was genuinely thrilled. The Grand Duchess was obsessed with the type writer. Bjorn gazed at her interestingly, she looked like a completely different woman.The person demonstrating did not want to miss the opportunity, so offered Erna to try the typewriter. Bjorn figured Erna would refuse, but she cautiously approached and pressed a key. A delicate looking arm struck out and stamped the paper with a letter.\u201cIts writing, Bjorn, look,\u201d Erna laughed and pointed to the paper.A smile burst onto Bjorn\u2019s lips as he admired his wife\u2019s enthusiasm.Erna was finally happy and she looked beautiful, that was enough for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There, Erna became like a character in a fairy rale.Faraway\u00a0lands\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0east\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0desert,\u00a0myriad\u00a0undiscovered\u00a0kingdoms,\u00a0rare\u00a0and\u00a0lovely\u00a0flora,\u00a0and\u00a0bizarre\u00a0and\u00a0unusual\u00a0fauna.\u00a0She strolled through that extraordinary world alongside her princeShe completely forgot about the honeymoon and the lack of time she had with her husband. The time she was now spending with Bjorn had\u00a0had\u00a0supplanted\u00a0those\u00a0unpleasant\u00a0memories.He laughed as he pointed out a wonderfully colourful carpet that seemed to be enchanted by magic and flew.When Erna saw an Elephant, she flinched into Bjorn arm\u2019s and he kissed her briefly, under the stained glass window, filling the space with ecstatic light.Erna squeaked into Bjorn\u2019s arms when she spotted an elephant, and they\u00a0shared\u00a0a\u00a0quick\u00a0kiss\u00a0beneath\u00a0the ecstatic\u00a0light\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0stained\u00a0glass\u00a0window.Wherever she turned her eyes, Bjorn was there. She liked the fact that she saw her husband often. In those moments, she wanted to take a picture of Bjorn, capture him in the way that she saw him. If she could, her mind would explode, like the fireworks they saw together that night.\u201cWhat are you so excited about?\u201d Asked Bjorn.Erna didn\u2019t realize she had been grinning the entire time until Bjorn asked her that question.\u201cOh, no, nothing, never mind.\u201dShe brushed her feelings aside because she found them to be somewhat embarrassing.\u00a0Bjorn\u00a0laughed,\u00a0and\u00a0another\u00a0flash\u00a0of\u00a0desire\u00a0swept\u00a0over\u00a0her heart\u00a0at\u00a0that\u00a0very\u00a0moment.\u00a0Those bad memories that had formed for days were wiped away in an instant.Firming her heart to accept her wonderful fate, Erna threaded a hand into Bjorn folded arms and snuggled in close to him. She decided to try a little harder in the hopes that one day she will get reach Bjorn\u2019s heart.Even if she couldn\u2019t erase the shadow of Princess Gladys, maybe she will be able to find her own spot in his heart, even if its a small little nook, a slither of golden sunshine just for her.Perhaps because of that renewed determination, the walk back was a little lighter and cheerier than the first time.She couldn\u2019t help but look back in regret, but she didn\u2019t leave the fair with any ill will. Grand Duke Schuber and his wife were the last ones to go sightseeing, and when they saw their wagons waiting, Erna grew impatient and opened up her stride.\u201cStand back everyone, back off, I said back off.\u201dDespite the orders of the royal guard,onlookers pushed forward to get a better look at the Grand Ducal couple. It was fair to say that\u00a0 that Erna Dniester, Grand Duchess of Schuber, was currently the most popular royal in Lechen.Erna\u2019s pale complexion blanched even more. The noise of the crowd tingled her ears and she seemed to be holding her breath. She wanted nothing more than to hide away in the carriage, but if she did so, she could guarantee that her face would be on the front page in the morning, splashed in big, bold letters, declaring her Schuber\u2019s rudest royal.She had to be strong.The momentary pause gave Erna the chance to gather her strength and continue walking. The carriage was now in front of her, just a few more steps, just a little longer\u2026.\u201cERNA!!!!\u201dBjorn\u2019s shout roared to the sky the moment she widened her stride and took another step.The memories of the next moments remain a fragmented sensory overload. Bjorn wrapped his arms around her, people screaming, Royal Guards rushing past her.\u201cThat seductress took Princess Gladys\u2019 place, she is ruining the royal family,\u201d some evil cried out.Erna looked to the person who had shouted, throwing something toward her, just in time to see him get caught up in a tangle of royal guards. He glared at Erna with maddened eyes full of hatred, and never stopped pouring out obscenities.\u201cAre you all right, Your Highness?\u201dAt first, Erna thought the guard was talking to her, until she looked around and saw that Bjorn had been pelted in the back with an egg. Then she realised what had happened.\u201cThat sorceress is the devil, she\u2019s a demon that will ruin the royal family and bring Lechen down too.\u201dHe continued cursing at her as he was being dragged away. Bjorn threw off his jacket and faced the man, murder in his eyes. Bjorn only stopped because Erna dissuaded her husband from doing anything rash.\u201cNo, Bjorn! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d Her cold hands trembled as she held onto his arm tightly, she did not have the strength to hold him back and the two princes came running up to help.\u201cCalm down, Bjorn,\u201d Leonid said, holding Bjorn by the shoulders.\u201cGet out of my way,\u201d Bjorn growled.\u201cNo, Bjorn, there are too many eyes on us.\u201dLeonid looked at their little brother, Christian, who was holding the opposite arm to Erna. He looked confused, but did not let go. Luckily, the assailant had been taken away and they could no longer see him. Bjorn finally became calm after that.Bjorn closed his eyes and swore several times under his breath. He laughed as he opened them again, they were still intense and staring in the direction the assailant had been taken off too.\u201cYour Highness,\u00a0 Grand Duchess!!!\u201dBjorn stopped struggling against his brothers, turning to face the attendant that had screamed at him and then saw that Erna was slouched to the ground. Her pale skin was far paler than normal, like that of a corpse and she gasped for breath like something was caught in her throat.Bjorn completely forgot about the assailant and rushed over to her. He went to his wife with no one blocking his path.He scooped her up and cooed soft words to her as he took her to the carriage.\u201cBrother, this is,\u201d Christian picked up the Grand Duchess\u2019 belongings that scattered on the ground.Leonid looked down at the gathered up pamphlets and commemorative postcards Christian pressed into his hands. It looked like such shabby traces of a perfectly good day, ruined by the devil himself.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Catherine Owen walked out of the old building with a glare. She appeared extremely worn out, but her main emotion was anger. Every publishing house in Lars that she had visited had turned her down.The Lars genius poet, Gerald Owen, who had died early, had only one manuscript left. It had almost become a thing of myth, but there wasn\u2019t a single publishing house that wanted to print it. There used to be a time when people would fight tooth and nail for a single line of one of Gerald\u2019s poems, now, it was sad to see this manuscript being treated so poorly.Catherine gripped the manuscript-her brother\u2019s will-close to her chest, struggling mightily to control her tears and anger.She discovered it in the spring. Since his suicide, the home has been vacant and has sat empty for a considerable amount of time. Their mother couldn\u2019t get over the fact that her son had died until the Academy of Arts decided to keep the house and turn it into a memorial hall in his name. Preserve it as his birthplace. Catherine then discovered the stack of manuscripts hidden beneath the floorboards.The name that made me live and also killed me. To Gladys, my love and my abyss.Once Catherine had opened up the bundle, sealed with wax, she saw the tributary front page written with force. All the letters and poems contained within were all dedicated to one person, Gladys Hartford, the lover Owen called his love and abyss.That day, Catherine learned the cruel truth, told in a beautiful language. This was some of Owen\u2019s best work, and she was determined to get it published as her brother\u2019s most posthumous work. The whole world needed to know the truth, and Lars was not the only place in the world that had publishers. She would travel across the sea if need be.Catherine wore her hat deeply and began walking down the street. It was paved with the golden rays of sunlight, embracing the will of a man who had died for love.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*When the doctor arrived at the palace, the Grand Duchess was already looking stable. Other than a smile that was too feeble, there were no other symptoms to be concerned about. Her breathing was stable and her stomach cramps were no more.Mildly neurotic.That was the only diagnosis Dr Erickson could come up with. He was worried about the young Duchess, who was enduring something that could not be waved away with a laugh and a smile.\u201cI won\u2019t spare that lunatic,\u201d Lisa said, breaking down in tears, \u201cI will throw so many eggs at him, until that bastard\u2019s head cracks open like one.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine Lisa, I\u2019m okay. It was just an egg and I\u2019m not the one who got hit with it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so glad the Prince did well, and you didn\u2019t have to go through that yourself.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Erna said through a tired smile, \u201cI think it would have been better if the egg did hit me.\u201dWhen she recalled the stain from the rotten off that had hit Bjorn, her eyes turned red against her will.The attacker was a schizophrenic man. He believed Erna had forced out Princess Gladys and killed her child. So he did it to appease the devil, who was going to come and ruin the royal family. The police said she didn\u2019t have anything to worry about, but she did, especially when she thought of Bjorn.Erna clenched her eyes tightly while fighting back tears and got out of bed. She reeled from the pain in her feet. Lisa rushed over and helped her, so that she would not fall to the floor.\u201cYou have to be careful, alright?\u201d Lisa looked worriedly at Erna\u2019s bandaged foot.Erna returned with blistered and scarred feet after spending the entire day in new shoes. She even had blood soaking her stockings. She didn\u2019t even seem to notice until Lisa saw it and screamed the palace down.Lisa nearly started crying when she realized Erna had been walking around the expo all day with feet like that. Lisa couldn\u2019t say anything, because she knew how Erna felt, her foolish, naive love for Bjorn was what made her do it, wanting to look pretty for that man.In the end, a sudden attack by a lunatic ruined the entire day,\u00a0 that could have been so perfect. Lisa\u2019s stomach turned, thinking about how people were going to talk about this tomorrow.Suppressing her anger with deep breaths, Lisa helped Erna over to the chair by the window and sat her down gently. Erna regained her smile as she looked up at Lisa.\u201cYou will keep your promise, right?\u201d Erna said.Lisa was about to explode with rage, but she restrained herself and instead softly nodded. Erna did not show the injured foot to anyone, not even the doctor. She didn\u2019t want anyone to know about this. Lisa knew this was a small amount of pride Erna wanted to keep.Erna sat by the window and breathed in the cool air as if nothing had happened. Once she was bored of that, she went back to the bed and laid down as if it was any other night.When Lisa finally left, Erna closed her eyes and basked in the deep silence that came. Not long after, there was the sound of the bedroom door opening. Bjorn came into her bed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayErna looked like she was fast asleep. Even when he perched on the edge of her bed, she didn\u2019t seem to move. He was rather relieved. Maybe it was better that she didn\u2019t wake up, rather than looking at each other in the dim light, not finding anything to say to each other.Bjorn turned off the lamp on the night stand and looked at his wife in the darkness of the early evening. The doctor said there was no major health problems and it was just all shock of the events. He knew that well enough, but he was still nervous.It was just all the fuss.An absurd crime committed by an insane person. The culprit had been arrested and would soon receive his punishment. Fortunately Erna was not hurt, so all he had to do was forget about it and move on.Perhaps he was simply checking in to make sure everything was fine,\u00a0 he thought as he looked at the long shadows of the long lashes of Erna\u2019s eyes. He wanted to see her smiling face as she called his name, then he thought he could get rid of this horrid feeling.It was already speculated, before to the event, that Erna would get swallowed up by Gladys\u2019 shadow. Any lady in Erna\u2019s situation would have been in the same boat. Gladys, the unfortunate Crown Princess, has become a legend in the eyes of the people.Erna was up against an unbeatable foe she couldn\u2019t see or defeat.\u00a0 The odds never favored her, eventually she would lose and would always just be the second wife of Bjorn. The lesser wife.Bjorn looked up at the ceiling. It was harsh, he knew that. He looked about the room, passing his eyes over the faintly shadowed furniture. In the end, was this life the best thing for this woman?Where else could she have gone? She would have been sold off to the highest bidder after being put on the marriage market. At best, she would have been a trophy wife of an old aristocrat who was on the verge of death. At worst, she would have become a plaything for the likes of that lord of trash, Heinz.Even though she was put on the alter of sacrifice, in the temple of the unfortunate Crown Princess, Erna could not have hoped for a better like than this.After that clear conclusion, Bjorn looked down at his wife one more. Erna\u2019s decision to flee her father and run away with that red haired painter was not a variable worth considering.Bjorn got up and stood at the head of the bed. He saved this woman from a terrible fate and gave her the best life possible. As that realisation dawned on him, he let out a slow sigh. The temple of Gladys was built on strong foundations and so long as he kept her secret, Lars would compensate him. It was impossible to bring that temple down.His second wife would have to sacrifice herself on the altar for years to come, and perhaps for the rest of her life, but there was so much compensation he could give her and he would give her everything she asked for.He leaned over and placed a delicate kiss on her cheek.The memory of her sparkling eyes that had been looking at him all day long were a source of solace. He knew that tomorrow, Erna would look at him with those same eyes. It was the greatest gift this woman had given him yet.Bjorn slipped out of bed without a sound as he pulled the curtains shut.\u00a0 Before he closed the door, he completely erased the feeling that suddenly came over him.It will be fine, because she is Erna.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cI\u2019m glad she looks fine, Isabelle,\u201d Phillip said, as he looked out the window.Isabelle moved to her husbands side. A chariot carrying the Grand Duchess sped off down the road, taking her to the summer palace.The Grand Duchess had visited their place every morning, just to say good morning to them. It was the same the day after the surprise attack. One positive note is that her coming brought much-needed relief.\u201cI think Bjorn has picked out a very decent woman. I don\u2019t know much, but I know that kid takes after his father, in that he has a good eye for woman.\u201d Phillip said in jest.Isabelle Dniester\u2019s laughter echoes throughout the sunlit drawing room as she looked up at her husband.\u201cWhere has the disproving King, displeased with the daughter of the Hardy family go?\u201d She said.\u201cProbably went off on vacation again.\u201d\u201cThere are times when you resemble Bjorn very much.\u201d\u201cYou say some pretty awful things,\u201d the king smiled, \u201cI hope they are getting along, what do you think, is Bjorn doing well?\u201d\u201cHow am I supposed to know? I don\u2019t know everything about that spoiled brat. I just pray that he is being a good husband, just like his father.\u201d\u201cTrue. A happy marriage is possible If he learns to listen to his wife, like me.\u201d Phillip remained deadpan, even after his self praise. Isabelle laughed, though she frecaled a far away time where she struggled to tame the wolf.\u201cBy the way, Isabelle, what the hell is that?\u201dPhillip\u2019s eyes narrowed as he peered out the window. Erna had gotten out of the carriage with a bouquet of flowers as big as she was. An even larger bouquet was still in the carriage.Phillip and Isabelle exchanged puzzled looks before breaking into laughing. The birthdays of the twin princes seemed as if it was going to kick off with a very fragrant start.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*BIG!That was Leonid\u2019s first thoughts.In terms of size, this bouquet was big, very big.\u201cFrom the bottom of my heart, I hope you have the most wonderful of birthdays, Your Highness,\u201dErna said. Her eyes were just as radiant as the bouquet she offered.Leonid nodded absently and accepted the huge gift. Christian, who had been watching in amazement, drifted into the silence, with only a partially suppressed laugh.\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d Erna said.\u201cNo, no of course not, I was just not expecting such a, big, present like this,\u201d Leonid said, trying to show a reassuring smile.Erna left after saying a few more congratulatory words and about the bouquet for the Grand Duke. She left with a modest farewell, as if she hadn\u2019t just gifted a huge bouquet of flowers, that proclaimed her extraordinary character.\u201cI merely came to wish you a happy birthday and to think I would witness such a scene,\u201d Christian said.Now that the Grand Duchess had left, Christian let the laughter flow freely and loudly. He couldn\u2019t contain it. Flowers and the Crown Prince, it would be hard to find a more incompatible match. Even now, Leonid\u2019s sombre expression made the bright blossoms pop even more.\u201cYou know, she probably made them herself,\u201d Christian said, inbetween bouts of laughter.He made the conclusion as he studied the bouquet in Leonids arms. Even to his eyes, the flowers looked so expertly made.\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky brother.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t belittle another persons sincerity like that,\u201d Leonid scolded his brother.\u201cWhat? No, I didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d Christian\u2019s expression quickly changed and the laughter immediately stopped. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 its just that the Grand Duchess is pretty cute.\u201d\u201cThe Grand Duchess is Bjorn\u2019s wife, Chris, she\u2019s your superior.\u201d\u201cI know, but superior can be cute too, right?\u201dLeonid let out a sigh, but in the end, he shared in the final chuckle. In any case, it was fortunate that she wasn\u2019t hurt at all. It seemed like Christian\u2019s claim was not entirely wrong.\u201cBy the way, brother Bjorn will also receive a bouquet, right?\u201d Christian said.\u201cNo doubt he will.\u201d\u201cOh my God,\u201d Christian said.Christian decided to go back on his opinion about a more mismatched couple than Leonid with a huge bunch of flowers, now that he thought about Bjorn receiving the same.\u201cI should have gone to him first, I would love to have seen that,\u201d Christian said.\u201cYeah, me too, actually.\u201dThey both ran to the window in time to see the open carriage pass the gate house. A grander arrangement of flowers than Leonid\u2019s was nestled in the Grand Duchess\u2019s arms.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cHappy birthday Bjorn,\u201d the voice came as a sweet whisper on the wind.Bjorn opened his eyes and lowered his arm, which had been covering his face. He shifted his gaze to the front door, where billowing draperies wavered in the light spring breeze. There he saw the huge bouquet of flowers that obscured his view.\u201cThe weather is so fine for you today,\u201dHe was startled because he thought he saw a floral ghost when, all of a sudden, Erna\u2019s smiling face appeared from behind the flowers.Bjorn sat up and looked at his wife, trying to make sense of what he saw. He was still groggy from sleep, but he was not dreaming any more.\u201cI made them myself, with flowers that bloomed this morning.\u201d\u201cI can tell,\u201d Bjorn said.The flowers smelled so sweet and their colour poured out without restraint, even to Bjorn\u2019s half awake eyes could see the skill with which his wife had put them together.\u201cDon\u2019t you like them? His Highness the Crown Prince did.\u201cYou gave some to Leonid?\u201d\u201cYes, of course, its his birthday too, but yours is bigger,\u201d Erna wore a very prideful look on her face.Seeing his wife talk about it like it was some kind of special privilege, made him laugh. He decided not to tell her that he would have preferred her, with a neat little ribbon tied around her nakedness..\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Erna asked again, her face now serious.Bjorn nodded and waved for her to come to him. Her smile returned and she looked so beautiful. She put down the massive present and stepped gingerly towards him, before falling into his arms. She was incredibly lovely to the touch, delivering both warmth and a pleasant aroma.Erna kissed him on the lips and he was filled with a languid smile. The playful kiss, which had been soft on his, deepened shortly after.Bjorn closed his eyes as they embraced each other. He reached out and gently touched the back of her head, drawing her closer to him. She had gotten pretty good at kissing. He was sure that days like this would continue on for a long time. As long as she was Erna.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was as beautiful as spring itself. After carefully examining the placement of the candleholders, the preparations were perfect.Erna then went to check with the chef, then hurried around to the hall where the guests would be coming to celebrate.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Your Highness, I can assure you that no one will find fault with the celebration,\u201d Mrs Fits kept saying, as she followed Erna around like a shadow.\u201cIt\u2019s a little comforting to hear you say that, Mrs Fitz,\u201d Erna said with a weak smile.The banquet hall was lit up with soft amber hues from elaborate chandeliers that reflected off the polished floor. Draped in front of the large, floor to ceiling, windows were cream coloured, silk curtains. Everything in the hall was picked out to match the beautiful spring garden.\u201cErna,\u201d someone called out.Following the voice calling her name, Erna turned to see Bjorn standing on the royal crest that was ingrained into the floor, at the centre of the hall. Seeing him standing in the middle of the Grand Dukes hall made the whole scene even more perfect to her.She approached cautiously and as she did so, Bjorn held out his hand. She stood beside him and didn\u2019t want to be anywhere else.\u201cDoes it look okay?\u201d She asked him, in her usual soft whisper.\u201cWhat does it matter? My birthday comes around every year,\u201d Bjorn said, giving a flat answer.\u201cBut this is the first birthday we are celebrating together.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really important to me,\u201d Erna said sternly.Bjorn looked down at his wife and gave her a smile. She always tried to celebrate minor events with grand gestures. Then he thought about her first birthday, the one in which no one remembered. He pushed the thought from his mind.\u201cThe first guests are arriving,\u201d a servant informed them, Bjorn felt Erna squeeze his hand.Lisa was standing close by and was admiring all the hard work she had put into making sure the Grand Duchess was the most beautiful. She was wearing a light blue dress, looking as pure and beautiful as a fairy of water. She hated to admit it, but Erna looked more elegant when she was around Bjorn. She almost seemed to glow and shimmer whenever she was around her husband.\u201cPlease, please, please,\u201dLisa begged, praying that the selfish prince would recognise his wife\u2019s beauty.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cI think we need to adjust the seating around the dinner table,\u201d Mrs Fitz said.\u201cNo, I think I will wait a little longer,\u201d Erna said, giving it some thought.\u201cYour Highness, you must make a decision,\u201d Mrs Fitz looked at Erna desperately.It was nearly time for the banquet and the Duchess Arsene had not yet shown up. She had a seat next to Bjorn and if she didn\u2019t come, it would be empty.As soon as Mrs Fitz was about to insist some more, the buzz of conversation in the hall suddenly became very quiet. All the guests were looking at the entrance.\u201cOh my god, I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d they were all whispering.\u201cGrandma, you came?\u201d Princess Louise said.The Duchess Arsene, who had brought about this big disturbance, marched across the room as if simply walking down the street. She ignored everyone and only looked at one person, the Grand Duchess.\u201cAh, Grandma, you came,\u201d Erna said, running toward the Duchess.She forgot about the people looking at them with their shocked faces. Duchess Arsene clicked her tongue at Erna\u2019s reckless behaviour, but her eyes were softer than her before.\u201cWell, you look normal for someone that was attacked by a lunatic, Erna, I only came to see how pathetic you\u2019d become, but I see I\u2019ve wasted my time.\u201dShe spoke maliciously and the people about them started to hiss with whispers. To their surprise, Erna simply laughed in the face of such brutal insults.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here, you didn\u2019t say anything to me, mother,\u201d the Queen said.The Duchess gave the Queen a sullen look, as the King, Crown Prince and Bjorn came over to stand at Erna\u2019s side.\u201cIt was nothing to do with you, so there\u2019s no need to get bent out of shape about it. I am a guest of the Grand Duchess, isn\u2019t that right Erna?\u201dThe Duchess looked at Erna, after glancing at Bjorn. The old woman\u2019s expression, which had always been cold and hard, turned into a smile. All eyes were turned to the Grand Duchess as the Duchess questioned her. Erna completely forgot her nervousness for a moment and smiled with secret conspiracies.\u201cYes, Grandma, welcome. I am so happy that you came.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*All eyes were on the upright lady as she was shown to her seat. When the Duchess found out she would be sat next to Bjorn, expressed her blatant discontent with a deep frown. Knowing of the woman\u2019s great temper, the crowd waited for the outburst, like a coming thunderstorm.When the Duchess had found out that Bjorn was stepping down as Crown Prince due to an extramarital affair, it was said that she marched into the palace and slapped the Prince, vowing never to speak to him again.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the Grand Duchess was thinking,\u201d Louise whispered to her husband.The Duchess looked like she was about to turn and leave at any moment, but she obediently took her seat next to Bjorn. She calmly sat down, completely forgetting the years of enmity.Bjorn did not have much time to react, he had been engrossed in something and barely noticed how the crowd had gone completely silent. When he realised his grandmother was approaching him, he could do nothing but meet the woman\u2019s gaze. There was slight agitation, but neither of the two broke eye contact.Don\u2019t you think you can fool me,\u00a0the Duchess had shouted so many years ago. Her shouts, as she stormed into the room, roused Bjorn.Tell me the truth,\u00a0she demanded,\u00a0and don\u2019t even think about lying to me. Why, why did you do it, for what reason?Duchess Arsene refused to believe the truth, she was sure that Bjorn had thrown up a smoke screen to hide something and pressed him for the truth.It\u2019s just who I am, Grandma,\u00a0Bjorn had said, it was the only answer he was allowed to give.\u00a0Please accept it.When Bjorn said those words, with a laugh, Duchess Arsene\u2019s anger snapped and the sound of a slap rang out in the hall. It was a very sharp slap, but the pain didn\u2019t last long. It was the tears that stuck with Bjorn the most, seeing his Grandmother cry as she swore to never speak to him again.It was for the good of the royal family and the nation. He pretended to be a martyr for a face cause, but now that he thought back on it, well, he wasn\u2019t sure any more. Perhaps he was really just being selfish, but that was him.Even now, that fact didn\u2019t change, there was still nothing he could do about it. He couldn\u2019t tell his Grandmother the truth, no matter how badly her heart had broken. He had been her favourite and rather than having to face her, he was content with simply facing the contempt.\u201cYou seem well, at least, your wrinkles have improved a lot,\u201d Bjorn said with a laugh.\u201cI\u2019m very moved by your first words, after so many years,\u201d the Duchess replied to the joke with a laugh too.That was it, Erna thought, even with something so mundane and small, the Duchess had broken her promiseStarting to recover from the shock of the Duchess\u2019 appearance, the party guests started talking amongst themselves again. Even the Queen, who was well known for being able to keep her composure, looked at the scene with agitation. The only one that was keeping their cool was the Grand Duchess.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cErna, Erna,\u201d Brenda Hardy called.Erna had been leaning on the railing of the balcony as the woman came running up to her. Erna looked at Brenda in surprise.Brenda Hardy looked about and confirmed that there was no one in earshot to eavesdrop, hurriedly stepped closer to Erna. How alert she must have been, to pick this moment to talk to Erna.\u201cWhat is it Viscountess?\u201d Erna said, hiding her embarrassment.It was only because of Mrs Fitz that they had been invited to the party in the first place. The two were steeped in rumours about the Grand Duchess and it might have been wise to invite them, if only to throw cold water over the rumours.Erna had been so reluctant at first, but for the sake of Bjorn, she finally invited them. It didn\u2019t mean that she would have to associate with them, however and as far as Erna was concerned, she had no longer any connection to the Hardy family name.They stood together on the balcony in silence for a long while.\u201cWell, if you have nothing to say, I wish to leave,\u201d Erna said.\u201cThere\u2019s no news yet, I\u2019m starting to worry.\u201d\u201cNews?\u201d\u201cOf a child,\u201d Brenda Hardy said, looking like a concerned mother, \u201cI\u2019ve been asking around and come across a concoction to improve your chances of getting pregnant. You need to have a child soon, to secure your position. Look, I\u2019ve prepared a sizable batch and will drop it off to the mansion later.\u201d\u201cViscountess!\u201d Erna declared, stunned by what the woman was saying.\u201cThis is not the time to be careless, Your Highness, look at Princess Gladys, she had a son and was so easily cast aside, what chance do you think you have, if you don\u2019t have a child,\u201d Brenda took Erna\u2019s hand, \u201cthink carefully, you of all people know what the Prince is like.\u201d\u201cDo not talk about my husband like that,\u201d Erna said, snatching her hand back.\u201cI know you don\u2019t like me very much, but there is no one else on your side, no one you can trust, aren\u2019t we in the same boat?\u201d She reached out for Erna again, but Erna backed away, just as an attendant came out onto the balcony.\u201cYour Highness, her majesty, the Queen, wishes to speak with you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The waltz melody played in the chamber orchestra aroused the mood of the spring night. The crowd drew together in pairs and with laughter and chat, danced about the hall.\u201cYour first party is quite the success,\u201d she spoke the words of praise in a soft and warm manner.\u201cThank you Your Majesty, it\u2019s mostly thanks to Mrs Fitz\u2019s help.\u201d\u201cStrange, Mrs Fitz said that this was all thanks to your indomitable effort. I also heard that you had visited the Duchess Arsene every week, to convince her to come, as a present for Bjorn.\u201d\u201cOh, ah, yes,\u201d Erna said shyly.\u201cThank you so much, Erna,\u201d Isabelle Dniester said, turning to face Erna.She didn\u2019t have high expectations for her daughter-in-law. She had been sure that Bjorn would never marry again, but Erna had changed his heart. All the Queen had ever wanted was for her son to live happy and well, she didn\u2019t ask anything more of Erna, but she never thought the child would be such a gift.\u201cI owe you a great debt,\u201d the Queen said.\u201cNo, really, I liked visiting the Duchess. I almost felt like I was visiting my maternal Grandmother every week, in Buford. Bjorn\u2019s grandmother was kind to me.\u201d\u201cNow that you mention it, why didn\u2019t you invite the Baroness? It would have been nice if we had been together.\u201d\u201cI wanted to, but my Grandmother refused,\u201d Erna became visibly sullen.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you go to Baden Street with Bjorn?\u201d Isabelle suggested, impulsively. She could understand, if only a little, why the Baroness would stay away from the city, so as not to become embroiled in scrupulous rumours too.Isabelle\u2019s heart became heavy when she thought of the kind old lady wishing her granddaughter well from so far away. She couldn\u2019t even believe that Erna had not yet visited Baden Street in all the time she had been in the city. It was hard to decide which one to be surprised at most, Bjorn, for his nonchalantness, or Erna, for her indomitable patience.\u201cReally, may I?\u201d Erna said in disbelief, \u201cIt would be nice to visit, but the foundation festival is soon and the summer season\u2026\u201d Erna trailed off.\u201cWould you like to let go of all that worry? The absence of the Grand Ducal couple would not interfere with the festival, or the summer\u2019s social season,\u201d Isabelle smiled softly.She felt sorry for the child, who was placing her royal duties before her desire to visit Baden Street. It would be easy for her to endure the glares of those eager to find fault with the Grand Duchess. She let out a long sigh as she thought about the kind of pain Erna endured, to be compared to Princess Gladys in every detail and bear all the arrows of criticism directed at Bjorn.\u201cForget about things for a while, go and see your Grandmother. Think of it as a gift from the King and myself, in return for the gifts you have given us.\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Majesty, thank you so much.\u201dErna showed complete joy. For a moment, Isabelle couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the child before her. She still felt sorry for her and her joyless smile. She needed to put a very harsh bridle on the child who knew nothing.Difficult thoughts weighed heavy on her heart, but it was fortunate to have this child by her son\u2019s side and she hoped she would continue to love him, as she did now.Yes, she was a selfish mother.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The terrace, which connected to the hall, where the party was in full swing, was crowded with gentlemen sitting in clustered groups, smoking cigars.Bjorn sat in a spot where he could better hear the fountain and looked out over the garden. The mood of the spring night gradually deepened as the smoke rose up into the night sky and disappeared.\u201cHey Bjorn, Viscount Hardy seems to be very interested in you,\u201d Peter jested.\u201cI know,\u201d Bjorn said, letting the cigar smoke escape his lips.Walter Hardy had been trying to struggling to get Bjorn\u2019s attentions all night. It was a fruitless effort, one that Bjorn had no interest in. He just smiled, welcomed and sat with him at the same table. Bjorn was already getting tired of his inexhaustible shadow. He was only here because Erna invited him.She had not bared the thought of walking the aisle with her father and yet, she had invited the whole Hardy family to save face with the royal family. So he put up with them, to honour his wife\u2019s intent.When Bjorn no longer showed any interest, the party goers returned to their usual topics of conversation. Horse racing, the foundation festival ball, or which socialite was currently enjoying the lime light of fame. Although Bjorn showed disinterest, he still listened in to the conversations.\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t think our prince would do so well, with a woman he had won on the gambling table,\u201d Leonard said, \u201cyou should thank me, because that whole bet happened because of me. I\u2019m the number one contributor to his marriage, ain\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cShut up, Leonard,\u201d Bjorn said with a smirk, the rest of the table burst into laughter.\u201cI wont ask for anything in return, just give me some investment tips, maybe. We served as bridesmaids so that she would marry the Poisonous Mushroom Prince, so you should show us some gratitude at the least.\u201d Leonard did not shut up.\u201cI know. Tell us the truth, it was a bet that you won not because you did well, but because the rest of us are so damn hideous,\u201d Peter said, everyone else rankled.\u201cWhat are you talking about, you crazy bastard? I\u2019m no where near as ugly as you are,\u201d Leonard said.The conversation grew heated as the men exchanged insults in a joking manner.\u201cErna!\u201dThe shout came just as Bjorn was putting down him drink. He looked up to see Walter Hardy shouting. When Bjorn turned to look where Walter had been shouting, he saw Erna coming out onto the terrace. Walter was about to approach his daughter, pretending to be a doting father.Bjorn stood up without hesitation. Erna had been anxiously looking around, looked at Bjorn with relief softening her worry.\u201cErna,\u201d Bjorn said.As he approached and called her name, Erna hurried over to his side. Bjorn held his wife\u2019s hand tightly and he glared at Walter Hardy.\u201cAh, Your Highness, you\u2019re here also,\u201d Walter\u2019s face went servile, \u201cI was having a chat with my daughter, whom I have not seen in quite some time.\u201dBjorn wished they were living in a more barbarous time, so that he could swat this insect away and no one would bat an eye. He would probably even be praised for the act. Bjorn grieved anew and forced a smile.\u201cI see,\u201d Bjorn simply said, in his usual, nonchalant manner.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I would really like to talk to my daughter.\u201dJust as he was about to tell the man to leave, Bjorn\u2019s attention was dragged away by Erna\u2019s sudden coughing fit, he noticed the cigar in Walters fingers.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but as you can see, my wife is not feeling well, so you will have to postpone the conversation for another time.\u201d Bjorn ended the conversation with a snap of his chin.His father-in-law is always blinded by greed and was very good at getting scammed, so much so that he has amounted a huge amount of debt and tried to sell his daughter to get out of it. Leonard was partially right, but the chief contributor to driving Erna into Bjorn\u2019s arms was Walter Hardy, not Leonard. A terribly hunter, who had driven a baby deer out onto the hunting grounds. There was no reason why he couldn\u2019t show a little patience for such a worthy person.Bjorn left the terrace with Erna linked into his arms, leaving Walter Hardy to stare dumbfounded at their backs. Once they were down the last flight of steps and out into the garden, Erna stopped coughing and although her eyes were watering, and her nose was red, she still smiled.\u201cBjorn, the Queen said it would be okay to go and visit Grandma with you. If you wanted?\u201d\u201cDo you want to go?\u201d Bjorn asked, even though he knew the answer.\u201cYes, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201dErna took a step closer to him and she reached up to adjust his bow tie. He had spent ages trying to tie that knot and smiled despondently. As Erna wriggled it straight, it felt like the knot was mocking him.\u201cI won\u2019t take up too much of your time, okay?\u201dErna\u2019s eyes became desperate as she took his prolonged silence as a rejection. He really liked those eyes. Beautiful, sparkling eyes that only stared at him. Erna, who cried and laughed all because of him.Bjorn readily admitted that he was enjoying this moment of petty control as he watched her. It was like he didn\u2019t have any regrets about the crown and was just happy, here, with this woman. It was funny even so, the fact that the marriage hadn\u2019t been that bad made Bjorn laugh.Bjorn smiled and nodded. The wind smelled sweetly of spring flowers and then Erna laughed. The throne and the crown shone in her eyes brightly. She was his beautiful little kingdom.Bjorn stretched out a hand and brushed her cheek as she finished with his tie. He leaned in and kissed her on her forehead, then the bridge of her nose, then eventually her lips. She shrank into his arms. Bjorn couldn\u2019t deny it, everything had worked out in the end.He was the king of his kingdom and he really loved it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They hadn\u2019t even passed a single farm building for a long time. All Bjorn could see out of the window was a sea of green waves, frozen as hills.Erna was immersed in the passing countryside. She seemed so engrossed by all the trees and bushes and green fields.\u201cBjorn, we\u2019re almost there,\u201d she said excitedly.Erna had repeated those words several times in under an hour, but this time, her expression was one of excitement and Bjorn found that cute, so he accepted her lie one more time. It wasn\u2019t like they had to go to the end of the world.Erna was bothered by his bored expression and tried to get him excited for the countryside. She explained the rural scenery, words that sounded foreign to Bjorn\u2019s ears.\u201cThe swamp beyond that field is full of buttercup and water parsley. There,\u201d she pointed to a distant copse, \u201cthere is a black strawberry tree in the wood.\u201dBjorn stared out the window with a languid stare, like a sleepy cat. A dandelion-drenched river bank, a maple grove and a tranquil pond that shimmered like a mirror, passed by his indifferent eyes. He wished he could have slept, but the carriage ride was far too rough.\u201cWe\u2019re almost there,\u201d Erna said again, as the sun began to set over the hills. \u201cThis time for real.\u201dPerhaps she felt the distrust in his eyes, so Erna added that last bit to try and perk him up. She pointed out the window and beyond a field of bright yellow flowers, he could see the beginnings of a stone building. It was a mansion built within the literal heart of nature.Bjorn looked at the house with tired eyes. He considered the town, where Buford station was so remote and rural. Just as his tiredness was reaching its peak, the carriage pulled into Baden Street.\u201cGrandma, Grandma,\u201d Erna called.As soon as Erna saw the front door, she shouted and called. Her voice made Bjorn\u2019s ears tingle. As soon as the carriage stopped, Erna was out of the carriage before the footmen could open the door for her. The Baroness was already waiting at the mansion\u2019s gate.\u201cYou don\u2019t look like a lady, Erna,\u201d the Baroness mockingly scolded Erna as they embraced.Bjorn watched the scene play out, feeling slightly embarrassed and unwelcome in their reunion. He couldn\u2019t help but feel like some sort of villain who had separated Erna from her family, but he was in a position where he didn\u2019t really have any say in the matter.\u201cOh my, I have committed a great offence,\u201d the Baroness said, noticing Bjorn, \u201cGrand Duke, it\u2019s been awhile. Thank you so much for coming all the way out here to see this old woman.\u201dThe Baroness faced Bjorn with a smile. Bjorn wondered, in the far distant future, would this be what Erna would look like? Bjorn smiled as he bowed in front of the grey woman that would be his wife. The same friendly eyes, tone and even her brooch of artificial flowers.\u201cThank you for you welcome, Baroness.\u201d\u201cOh my God, he\u2019s a real prince,\u201d Someone\u2019s startled whisper came on the wind.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Mrs Greve said. Her gaze never left the Grand Duke.\u201cYes, of course, its more than enough,\u201d Bjorn said as he looked around Erna\u2019s room.Baroness Baden wanted to offer the two newly repaired guest bedrooms to the married couple, but Erna still had some lingering attachment to her old room. It might be a little uncomfortable, but Bjorn saw no real reason he should deny his wife\u2019s heart.\u201cIn that case, I will call the servants to change the bed for you, that one is a bit narrow,\u201d Mrs Greave said.\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Bjorn said with a smile, \u201cif it\u2019s too narrow, I will just put my wife on top of me.\u201dErna and Mrs Greave let out a sigh at the same time, shocked by Bjorn\u2019s nonchalantness. Mrs Greave, at a loss as to what to do, simply nodded and left the room, closing the door behind her. Only once they could no longer hear her footsteps, did Erna breath again.\u201cBjorn, how could you make such a joke?\u201d\u201cWhat joke? I was being serious.\u201dBjorn approached the window. A cool breeze blew in when he opened the rustic window. He could not see out into the scenery because of the deep night, it was so dark in the country and Bjorn could hear the whisper of leaves being caught in the wind.\u201cThere\u2019s an apple orchard over there, we can go there for a picnic tomorrow. The hills beyond it must be in full bloom by now.\u201d Erna then pointed to another dark patch, \u201cin that forest, there is a secret place that no one knows about, but I will make an exception for you.\u201dErna chatted excitedly like that for ages. Bjorn listened to the chatter, looking at his wife instead of the world she pointed out to him. She seemed so different out here, than when she was in the city.\u201cBjorn, thank you so much,\u201d she said suddenly, \u201cthank you for coming to see my grandmother with me and for repairing the mansion, and finding servants for my family. Thank you so much.\u201dErna was so moved that she looked like she was going to cry. Feeling a little awkward, Bjorn shifted his gaze to the view out of the window, everything was just darkness, so he looked about the room, with its cosy, warm light.It had been his mother that had suggested this little trip. Repairing Baden\u2019s house and hiring the servants were all his mother\u2019s\u00a0 doing. He had nothing to do with it.\u201cIsn\u2019t this room a little uncomfortable for you?\u201d Erna said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we go sleep in the guest bedrooms, I can do that, its fine, really.\u201d\u201cI like it here, Erna,\u201d Bjorn said, looking at his with with a heartfelt smile.Erna\u2019s bedroom, which over looked Baden Street, was decorated to the taste of a country girl. The furniture, ornaments and props, were cute, just like Erna, so it wasn\u2019t all that bad.\u201cIs that you?\u201d Bjorn was drawn to some pictures hanging on the wall, or sat on a drawer.\u201cYes, this is a picture drawn when I was a baby and this is my mother,\u201d Erna said, pointing to a portrait of a young woman holding a small baby.Erna smiled shyly as Bjorn looked at the woman with a bit of surprise. She was the exact same as Erna, save for the colour of her hair.Erna explained the pictures in the other frames, one by one. Portraits of her when she was five years old, all the way up to a mature girl. There were some other rough sketches, more of them than actual completed pictures and oil paintings. Without even trying, Bjorn could guess at who the artist was, none other than Pavel Lore.Come to think of it, Pavel Lore grew up here too and even though Bjorn knew nothing of the painting before him, he could tell how precious the girl was to the person that painted the picture. Friends, really?Just as his judgement was taking him to suspicion, Erna turned to him with a smile on her face. When he looked at her, he couldn\u2019t detect any signs of attraction and he was relieved. Erna headed away to the side of the bed.\u201cBjorn, can you turn around for a moment.\u201dErna looked at him and to the pyjamas on the bed. Bjorn replied to her request by not turning around, but instead folding his arms and leaning against the wall.Erna sighed and turned around to get changed. Bjorn stared at his wife\u2019s naked back and exposed buttocks as she got changed, doing her best to ignore his lecherous stare.Bjorn felt a twang of guilt in his stomach, for leering at his wife, who had done far more scrupulous things than getting naked in front of him. He couldn\u2019t believe he felt that way and even though he scolded himself, he did not turn away. Then, out of the blue, he wished he had some artistic talent, so that he could paint his wife\u2019s lovely body and keep it as a secret collection.Bjorn was stuck in the room even after the pyjama-clad Erna sat at the vanity and began brushing her long, brown hair. Her hair was very fine and cascaded down to her lower back.It was a sweet irritation to feel the touch of her revive at his fingertips. The desire he felt for Erna right then was strange, not unlike anything he had felt for her before, he could have her right now, if he wanted, but he didn\u2019t, despite the pull he felt.He blamed the new, unfamiliar surroundings, making him hold back his wants. As he restrained himself, a noise came from outside, a howl. Even as he frowned at the noise, Erna turned to him and laughed.\u201cThey are your friends, Bjorn,\u201d Erna said, putting down the hairbrush and came to his side, \u201cbut they wont come down here, not while they have prey in the forest.\u201d\u201cYou mean that wolf whimper?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Erna said, behaving very strangely.She talked about them like someone would talk about a pet dog and Bjorn started to understand Erna\u2019s sudden behavioural shift.\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, if they come close, we can scare them off easily. A shot from the gun in the study will scare them off.\u201d\u201cYou know how to shoot?\u201d\u201cYup, you kind of have to around here.\u201dErna spoke of violence that greatly contrasted her neat, prim and proper appearance, like a fairy talking of death dealing. Bjorn laughed in time with another wolf howl. He realised that his trip-the\u00a0act of kindness\u00a0toward his wife, might be more enjoyable than he realised.Bjorn closed the window and moved to hug Erna, his barbaric fairy wife. Once they lay in bed together. It was an old bed, not designed for two and it creaked under their weight.\u201cWould you like to try and vanquish this wolf?\u201dErna\u2019s brow furrowed questioningly at his words, as he lay on top of her.\u201cBjorn, this is a place of my most precious childhood.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cWords like that are an insult to me,\u201d Erna\u2019s mood shifted and she pushed him off. Their position changed.The White Wolf laughed under Erna\u2019s shadow and he was dumbfounded. It seemed like the gun downstairs was not the only one with bank shots in it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To be in a house with a warm and considerate Bjorn and a loving family. Every day passed like a dream in the landscape of her hometown that she had missed so much.After looking around the garden, she spent some time with her grandmother in her room and chatting. Baroness Baden was busy with a patchwork and Erna sat beside her to talk about the days planned events. It would have been a peaceful day, but the thread was about to run out.\u201cErna, dear, would you pass the red thread from the drawer.\u201dErna hurried over to the drawer. When she hurried over to the desk, where the Baroness kept her spare thread, Erna noticed a small stack of newspapers. She saw her own face staring back at her, in a picture on the papers front sheet. It was a picture from her wedding, but the headline stated that the Grand Duchess had been attacked by a schizophrenic madman.\u201cIs there no red thread left? There should be,\u201d the Baroness said, \u201cErna? My dear, what are you doing?\u201dErna did not reply, instead the room was filled with the soft whisper of rustling paper.\u201cGrandma, why are you keeping this?\u201d Erna came up to her feet, holding the small stack of papers. Baroness Baden\u2019s mood shifted as she realised her mistake. \u201cYou\u2019re not the type of person to hoard this stuff, Grandma, but why do you keep this nonsense?\u201d\u201cOh, Erna, its not like that,\u201d the Baroness shook her head, \u201cI got those papers for the crosswords, that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t, Grandma, if you read these articles, they will only make you upset and you will think I am a bad Granddaughter.\u201dErna realised that she had over reacted and lost control of her emotions. The Baroness had probably wondered how the rest of the world viewed the Grand Duchess, that the letters Erna had sent were laced with lies about how she was getting on.Erna knew that she shouldn\u2019t over react like this, but knowing did not help her reign in her emotions. She felt like some dirty little secret, which had been so well hidden, had finally come to the light of day.Erna wanted to come to Baden Street and forget all about the troubles of the city. All her pent up rage at such a cruel place came out all at once and she lashed out at the wrong person, her Grandmother. Guilt washed over her as she stood there, trying to think of a way she could undo her mistake.\u201cYou know very well that I like to do the crosswords, Erna.\u201dErna was speechless.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, I promise I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d\u201cErna couldn\u2019t find the words to say.\u201cErna, my baby?\u201d\u201cI will throw this lot away,\u201d Erna muttered softly, as she looked down at the stack of newspapers.\u201cErna, are you angry?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Erna could feel tears forming, \u201cit\u2019s not like that.\u201d Erna let out a long sigh, hanging her head in shame, \u201cI\u2019m going to go for a walk.\u201dErna hurried out of her grandmother\u2019s bedroom, leaving the unconvincing excuse hanging in the air. Her breathing became suffocating and her legs wobbled.\u00a0It\u2019s okay,\u00a0she tried to tell herself, but the words had no impact.\u201cLady Erna, where are you going in such a hurry?\u201d Mrs Greve called after Erna, as they crossed paths.Erna made for the walkways beyond the wooden fence. She had a long way to go, to get away from Baden house.Erna walked for a long while and eventually came to a field filled with wild flowers, primroses and bluebells, dandelions and foxgloves. It was a picturesque scene, but Erna did not have the notion to take it in. She hurried across the field and with great effort, threw the sack of newspapers into the swamp.Erna did not move as she watched the sack slowly sink into the water logged mud. Only once it was out of sight completely did she slump down and sit on the back of her heels. Only then did she feel that rapid breathing hissing through her teeth.She looked back down the hill, at the path she had come. This was not like her, she didn\u2019t feel herself as she stared back at her past with blank eyes, she almost looked insane. Goosebumps prickled her skin.Erna let out a long sigh that didn\u2019t stop until her lungs felt like they were going to collapse. A mixture of bewilderment and relief washed over her as she looked at the marsh, where it had swallowed the evidence of guilt and shame.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna was no where to be seen.Bjorn peered around the room that Erna had pretty much spent all of her time milling around, but now, the room stood empty and cold. During their morning walk, Erna had prattled on so excitedly about going into town, now, as he was ready to leave, she was no where to be found.Bjorn left the room and closed the door. He made his way outside, to the well kept garden, there he spotted the Baroness, lounging under an enormous ash tree. She was staring out beyond a fence.\u201cErna will be back soon,\u201d the old woman said as Bjorn approached, \u201cit seems like she decided she wanted to go on little stroll through the woods, but don\u2019t worry, Baden Street is easy to navigate, you\u2019ll be able to find her with your eyes closed.\u201d\u201cAre you a mind reader?\u201d\u201cMaybe, Your Highness,\u201d the Baroness smiled.\u201cPlease, there\u2019s no need for that, ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I should be speaking to the Prince of Lechen any other way, you are the prince first and my grandson-in-law second.\u201d The Baroness was smiling, but her eyes conveyed a fierce determination. \u201cI may be an old lady, out in the middle of nowhere, but I pride myself on my courtesy, Your Highness.\u201dBjorn looked at the elderly woman, whose words and feelings were exactly like those of Erna and nodded.He waited for Erna by the Baroness side. As the housekeeper brought him a glass of lemon water, he sat back to take in the early views of the rural neighbourhood and Baroness Baden\u2019s stitching.It wasn\u2019t until the Baroness had completed four rows of patchwork that she looked up at him again. The warmth of the spring sun was comfortably warm on her face.\u201cMy late husband had hair just like yours, Your Highness, beautiful platinum hair. So did Annette, who had inherited it from her father.\u201dThe Baroness voice was serene as she spoke about her daughter. Bjorn set down his glass and listened intently.\u201cErna is a miraculous child in that regard, resembling her mother so closely, save for that one aspect. We don\u2019t mind so much, but Erna only ever seemed to associate it with her abusive father and the pain her mother endured at his hands.\u201d The Baroness paused her stitching and placed her hands on her knees. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have planted such guilt in the child. We had to rush to see our ailing daughter, so we were unable to give Erna the loving attention she needed. Instead, she overheard all the nasty little words any grown up would use for such a horrible, tyrant of a man.The Baroness looked at the horizon with remorseful eyes, \u201cshe had to endure alone and to cope, she decided to dye her hair. She chased the maids, asking them how she could make her hair blonde. I don\u2019t know why they did it, but one of the maids told Erna that if she stared at the sun for long enough, it would turn her hair the colour of sunlight. Erna thought it was probably true, being young,\u201d the Baroness looked up at Bjorn, with a weak smile.\u201cThat day, Erna basked in the sunlight all day, from sunrise to sunset. It was early July, when the sun was at its hottest. I couldn\u2019t find her anywhere about the house, but when I had finally found her laying in the field, her hair was not blonde, but her skin was red. The walk back was so painful for her and she cried, thinking that she had failed because she took shade when she became too hot and exhausted.\u201dUnconsciously, the Baroness clasped Bjorn\u2019s hands as she thought about Erna on that day. It was a thorn planted deep in her heart. Bjorn stared back at her, waiting for the words to follow.\u201cEven now, when the sun is hot, I think of that day, Your Highness. Now that she has grown into a lady and even became the Grand Duchess, she will always look to me, like the sweet little girl with a beautiful red nose, now matter how old she gets.\u201dFrom afar, Bjorn could see a beautiful, flowery dress coming down the path, our of the woods. The Baroness, who also caught sight of it, looked at Bjorn with a warm smile.\u201cHer hair is so pretty. It doesn\u2019t need to be anything else. She is perfect just as she is and we love that about her. The things I couldn\u2019t tell her sooner, still remains as a hard lump in the depths of my heart. Perhaps Annette and my husband feel the same.\u201dThe Baroness watched Erna all the way to the gate, then picked up her needle and thread and carried on with her patchwork.\u201cYour Highness, I wish Erna could learn to love herself just the way she is, it is my earnest wish.\u201dErna noticed the two people sitting across from each other and froze for a second.\u201cI think her hair is pretty, Grandma,\u201d Bjorn said with a smile on his lips, \u201cits very pretty.\u201dThe worry seemed to melt away from the old woman\u2019s face, upon hearing Bjorn\u2019s warm words.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that the pair of you are going into town later?\u201d\u201cYes, I need to send a telegraph to Schuber, let them know that I am going to be staying here for awhile.\u201d\u201cAh, good, you\u2019ll enjoy it, the May Festival has begun in the village, it won\u2019t compare to the fancy festivals you have in the city, but its a good way to kill some time.\u201d The Baroness looked up from her sewing, with a beaming smile, \u201cdid you have a good walk?\u201d She said to Erna, who had been sneaking up on the pair the entire time.\u201cYes, Grandma,\u201d Erna said, after hesitating for a moment.\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t come back late, His Highness has been waiting for you.\u201d\u201cBjorn?\u201d Erna looked at her husband with surprise in her bright eyes.\u201cHis Highness is curious about the May Festival in the village, so I hope that you are not to exhausted from your walk to show him about. All good wives should do that.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI know you lied.Erna realised the truth when Baroness Baden suggested her and Bjorn went to the festival together. Her husband was not the type of person to consider doing such things.She pretended she didn\u2019t know and hoped into the carriage with Bjorn anyway. She was anticipating too much, but being here and not at Schuber, Bjorn had showed his more doting side. Unfortunately, she saw the truth of it and realised she had been a fool.\u201cI\u2019ll be back in about an hour,\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cI thought we were going together,\u201d Erna said, brow furrowed.\u201cI have business to take care of first.\u201d\u201cWell, then I will come with you,\u201d Erna said, steeling her nerves.\u201cJust go with your maid, Erna,\u201d Bjorn checked his watch, \u201cI will be back soon.\u201dErna could do nothing but except the cordial departure, which only served to increase Bjorn\u2019s indifference. She smiled at him as he turned away and headed for the telegraph office with his attendant.The miracle of Buford was over.That was the reality of the situation and Erna sighed as she quietly accepted it. She should have known, the scenery was different, but the man remained the same. Erna kept looking at the corner where Bjorn disappeared and only stopped when Lisa\u2019s face popped up in front of her.\u201cLets go have some fun, Your Highness, lets go to the festival and play all the games, eat all the tasty food. Lets go and enjoy ourselves.\u201d Lisa only just stopped short of saying\u00a0Lets put that wicked Prince from our minds.Erna simply smiled and gave a light nod from under her colourless parasol.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*There was no one around the bronze equestrian statue. Bjorn frowned and looked at his watch, realising that he was twenty minutes early.He looked around the square, even with the festival in full swing elsewhere in the village, it seemed like the Village Square was still the busiest spot. The sounds of youngsters laughing and shouting on the merry-go-round and the cries of the street vendors filled the air in the square, carried by the sweet, flowery wind.\u201cI\u2019ll go alone, wait for me here,\u201d Bjorn said to the attendant.\u201cBut Your Highness\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you afraid of? We are among people that don\u2019t even recognise me.\u201dThe attendant was at a loss for words in the face of Bjorn\u2019s convincing argument. It was clear that no one here knew who the Prince was. They bustled around him without so much as a courteous glance. This sort of behaviour would have been unthinkable in the city.Bjorn wasn\u2019t even remotely curious about the village festival, but even so, there was an uncomfortable feeling in his gut and his mouth was dry. He always seemed to get like this when he thought about how he had to deny Erna, who had been so excited to go to the festival with him, even the Baroness, who was so glad to see the way he was caring for her granddaughter.Maybe that was why he pressed on with his task as quickly as possible, so that he could go and be with Erna for the festival, where he could enjoy the anonymity. So far, all he had gotten was a brief sidelong glance from a man, who was quickly engulfed by joy of the crowd he was with.Bjorn turned into a street that was lined with stalls. Almonds roasted on a cast iron skillet and filled the air with its sweet aroma, mingling with the smell of cinnamon and honey. Sizzling sausages, spat and hissed, while beer filled men swung frothing jugs at each other in laughter and toasts.\u00a0 Soap bubbles passed over his head, drifting on the sweet wind and casting pearlescent light. There was a stage at the end of the street, where an orchestra played a polka.He scanned the crowds, narrowing his cool, grey eyes and immediately found a woman standing at the end of a crowd. He could recognise his wife anywhere.Bjorn snuck up on her as quietly as he could, until he was stood right behind her. Erna was completely immersed in the show, but Lisa, her maid, noticed him almost right away. She made to call out, but Bjorn shook his head slowly, putting a finger to his lips. Lisa folded in her lips and clamped them with her teeth, as she turned back to the show.Erna bobbed her head along with the music and followed the rapid movements of the dancers. She made the flowers and ribbons of her hat bounce and sway.Lisa couldn\u2019t hold her tongue any more. Without a word, she thrust Erna\u2019s parasol into Bjorn\u2019s hands and turned away into the crowd. Bjorn quickly took her place.\u201cLisa, where are you\u2026\u201d Erna said as she turned, she looked up just as Bjorn looked down.There was a second or two while Erna tried to make sense of the person she thought was Lisa, but was now a couple feet taller. Then her face brightened with elation as she recognised Bjorn standing next to her. Her laughter was an explosion of noise, accompanied by the laughter of all the festival goers.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Miracles are Capricious/They takes your hand and comfort you, if only briefly, before melting away. Just as you think to give up, they return to you in the form of a pleasant dream. Similar to the Prince.Erna chewed on a sweet almond, even as she prepares to put another in her mouth. She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off Bjorn, sat opposite her, for fear he might melt away like smoke. He leaned back in his chair, in that casual manner he always did, holding a half filled wine glass. It was too early to drink, but at the festival, most were in some form of drunkenness or another. Bjorn decided not to take issue and join in.They sat under the shade of a baldachin, eating the honeyed almonds Bjorn had bought her. They were nearly all gone and Erna was regretful of that, so she folded the bag over and taped it shut. She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off him, studying his platinum blonde hair, narrowed eyes and lips curled into a mirthless smile.They watched the May festival together and strolled along the street, stopping at interesting stalls and purchasing beverages. They were just two ordinary people, enjoying what ordinary people enjoyed. Light conversation and festival foods.The festival had always piqued her interest, even though she pretended to act indifferent. Her grandparents never liked the festival, Erna had thought about sneaking out to see it many times when she was growing up.They would tell her of an innocent young girl who had gone to the festival. There she met a handsome young man, who was the heir of a Viscount in the city. They fell in love and had a passionate relationship. Even though the girls parents didn\u2019t like the young man, they gave their blessings for marriage, because she was already pregnant.What would have happened if the girl hadn\u2019t snuck off to the festival?Just as the thouht came to Erna, Bjorn suddenly moved, raising a hand to get the attention of a waiter.\u201cYes, how may I help you, sir?\u201dBjorn lifted his empty wine glass and the waiter filled his glass.\u201cWill you be taking part in the Man of Buford contest? I think you would be a great contender,\u201d the waiter said, attempting at making polite conversation, spurred on by the excitement of the festival around them.\u201cMan of Buford?\u201d\u201cOh, you must not be from here, its a simple competition, a race, where a man carries his lady on his back to the finish line. The prize is the most sought after title of The Best Man of Buford.\u201d\u201cBest man of Buford\u2026\u201d Bjorn thought to himself, \u201cso, any man can take part, so long as they have a wife?\u201d Bjorn asked, looking suddenly very interested in his wife.\u201cYes sir, any man that has a wife to sling over their shoulder.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Erna said, catching up to the conversation, \u201cno, no thank you. Bjorn, we must keep our dignity.\u201dBjorn didn\u2019t listen to her and only smirked as he got up from the table to approach her. She knew all too well the meaning behind that devils grin.\u201cI don\u2019t want to, Bjorn, I clearly said no.\u201d\u201cCome my dear, we have a race to win,\u201d was all Bjorn said as he took her hand.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cWell this is hardly fair,\u201d said a man that stood on the start line next to Bjorn and Erna.His wife was clearly three times heavier and twice as old as Erna. It hardly seemed fair to participate in a race who\u2019s winner was already clearly defined. A tall man, with a half mile stride and a wife that was so petite, she almost looked like a little girl.\u201cThat\u2019s life,\u201d Bjorn said with a smirk.He was not the only man unhappy with the line up. Most of the other competitors looked at Bjorn and Erna with the same dejection.\u201cMy wife is also light as a feather,\u201d a man called out, \u201cwhen she was twelve.\u201d Some laughed, the man\u2019s wife did not.The race was about to start, despite the loud and often gaudy protests of some of the participants.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you at least make it a little fair, why don\u2019t you start back there,\u201d one participant said, pointing far behind the start line.He was met with the cheers of the rest of the contestants and the crowd, as if they had been waiting for someone to suggest it. Bjorn looked back at his suggested start line and frowned. Then nodded his head as he took several steps back.\u201cGet ready,\u201d the official called out.Everyone in the crowd hushed as they waited for the race with bated breath. The participants hoisted up their wives and set themselves ready, stern faced and determined. Erna studied the men, who seemed to carry their wives like some great burden.\u201cLets go Bjorn.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d Bjorn asked, confused.\u201cNo, lets go back, alright.\u201dBjorn looked at Erna as he removed his jacket, then his cufflinks, which he tucked into a pocket. He examined Erna closely, probably deciding which way would be best to carry her.\u201cWhy are you being like this? We have the dignity of the Royal Family to uphold.\u201d\u201cNobody knows who we are, there\u2019s nothing no worry about.\u201d\u201cBjorn.\u201d\u201cThey give a very big prize, Erna, and the title of Best Man of Buford,\u201d he said, with a cheeky grin on his face.\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m the one that will be running.\u201d\u201cAre you kidding, Bjorn? You\u2019re going to carry me the whole way?\u201dInstead of answering, Bjorn took immediate and decisive action. In the blink of an eye, Erna was up and over Bjorn\u2019s shoulder like a sack of potatoes.\u201cErna, Dniesters never play to lose, so, my dear wife, you can co-operate or not, we are going to win either way.\u201dHe was at a slight disadvantage, starting from so far back from the start line and his wife was thrashing about, making co-ordination a little difficult, but in his eyes, he was already at the finish line.Bang, the starter gun went off and everyone moved as fast as physically possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The absurdity of the situation blinded her to the fact that they had already caught up with the last man and was overtaking most of the other racers.Erna finally stopped screaming when she realised they might actually win. She looked to her front and saw the finish line. Bjorn was quite a strong runner. Her heart began to thunder in her chest, as the man right behind them seemed to find a burst of energy from some where and was closing the gap fast.\u201cBjorn, run, hurry up Bjorn,\u201d Erna was surprised to hear herself say, \u201cthey\u2019re right behind us, Bjorn, run faster, faster.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to do this, but she didn\u2019t really have much of choice and so became lost in the competition. It might have been a disgrace to the Royal Family, but maybe winning would soften the blow.\u201cWe\u2019re almost there, they can\u2019t catch us now.\u201dAs the finish line came ever closer, the man who had found his second wind, quickly began to flag. Bjorn raced flat out to the finish line, increasing the ever growing gap. The crowd roared their excitement at Bjorn\u2019s stunning recovery and inevitable victory. In contrast to her earlier cries of protest, Erna was one of voices adding her excitement to the yells of joy.\u201cKyaa!!! We did!!\u00a0 We\u2019re first, we won!\u201d Erna jumped about in excitement.\u201cYou certainly seem excited, now that we\u2019ve won,\u201d Bjorn said with a laugh.\u201cDniester don\u2019t play games to lose,\u201d Erna repeated Bjorn\u2019s earlier words.Where had the quiet lady gone? She seemed to steadfast in her decision not to participate. Bjorn smiled cheerfully and spread his arms to take in Erna, high on her win, she rushed headlong into his embrace.It was a bliss that the couple achieved together.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d Erna said as she studied the trophy she had won at the festival. Besides that, she was speechless.Bjorn had amassed a huge pile of harvest for being the best man in Buford. Pumpkins, potatoes, garlic, oats and wheat. Piled on top of all that were more crates of vegetables and grains that made a pile bigger than Erna\u2019s head.Bjorn looked over his winnings with a wide grin. The waiter wasn\u2019t lying when he said prize was huge. To top it all off, the crates of Buford\u2019s bountiful harvest was elaborately decorated with flowers.\u201cHey, you two, come up here,\u201d the host of the festival called to Bjorn and Erna, urging them up onto a podium, which was also decorated with flowers.The winning couple was honoured up on stage, to the cheers of the crowd. Bjorn was gifted a bottle of wine, while Erna was given a wreath of flowers and a necklace of Lillies, Buford\u2019s flower of the May festival.\u201cLets hear it for the Prince and Princess of the festival,\u201d the host called and the crowd cheered.\u201cHey, Erna, I guess I am always destined to be the Prince,\u201d Bjorn said with a laugh.He was the Prince of crops, with a crown of flowers and a sceptre that was a bottle of wine. He offered his hand to the Princess of crops and the pair made their way through the crowd, who parted like the red sea to let them pass.Bjorn looked so absurd that Erna couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the sight of it. Her playful cheers played over the crowd and she waved to them with dignity. It reminded her of her Royal Visits and parades.\u201cIs it just me, or does that young man look familiar,\u201d Erna heard a middle ages woman say.\u201cHey yeah, he reminds me of the twin Prince,\u201d a man said.\u201cAw, silly, you must be drunk already,\u201d another woman said.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Bjorn and Erna did not return to Baden Street until well after sunset. Baroness Baden watched them arrive through the window, just as she was finishing the last square on the patchwork. She could tell they had a good time by the bright smile on Erna\u2019s face, as she was helped out of the carriage by Bjorn.\u201cI\u2019m so glad to see that you are in good spirits, madam,\u201d Mrs Greve said.Baroness Baden simply bobbed her head as she folded up the completed work. She put away her glasses and got up to great the loving couple. Mrs Graves put a blanket over the Baronesses shoulders as she made for the front door.\u201cDid you enjoy the festival?\u201d the Baroness asked, as the two entered.\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d Bjorn said with a polite bow and a friendly smile.\u201cI\u2019m glad, Erna, what about you?\u201d\u201cI did, despite the embarrassment,\u201d Erna said, looking up from studying her fingers. She looked like she was still worried about the mornings events.\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d the Baroness said and moved in for a hug.Erna hugged her Grandmother, the rose coloured sun set falling onto her back, \u201cthank you for letting us go.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry it came late, sweetheart,\u201d the Baroness said, regretting raising Erna in such a remote village.She always regretted the decision, every time she read about the Grand Duchess, who was mocked by everyone for being a clumsy bumpkin. She was concerned that she would be unhappy, just like her mother, that she raised walls, which only got higher with time, even though she knew Erna couldn\u2019t be confined to such a small world.She should have had the chance to live like all the other noble ladies. If she had, maybe Erna wouldn\u2019t be such a pariah.\u201cYou must be hungry, come, lets go have some dinner,\u201d the Baroness said, letting the regrets melt away. \u201cOh my God, Erna, what is that?\u201d the Baroness shouted, as she noticed the crates and crates of produce for the first time.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The horse carrying the two stopped under a large tree. Once the servants had finished setting up the picnic, they departed, leaving the forest deserted. While Erna looked around excitedly, Bjorn dismounted first, then helped Erna. The breeze ticked his nose and carried the fresh aroma of scented flowers.Bjorn hugged Erna softly and set her down on the ground. There was a set a cushions on the blanket, as well as a basket filled with savoury treats and a small brazier for brewing tea.Erna forgot she was a princess for a moments and hopped around the picnic, checking everything off her imagined list. She bounced around the picnic area and saw the Roses and Blackberry bushes growing wild at the edge of the small field. The water in the creek was crystal clear. She bounded around like a juvenile puppy, let out for the first time.Bjorn watched his wife while getting comfortable, leaning on his stack of cushions. The sky was filled with billowing clouds and the trees swayed in the gentle breeze. Great swathes of daisy\u2019s painted the rolling hills white. It was certainly as beautiful as Erna had described.Bjorn couldn\u2019t take his eyes from his wife. Her loosely knotted hair danced as she bounced along with the white ribbons of her sun hat.Erna gathered up some flowers as she strolled through the lilies by the creek and brought them back to the blanket. Bjorn smiled affectionately at his wife and popped the cork on the bottle of wine.\u201cI would like a drink too,\u201d Erna said.\u201cShould a decent lady be drinking during the day?\u201d\u201cToday is a special day,\u201d Erna said, holding out her wine glass.Erna smiled timidly and her cheeks turned a light shade of peach. Bjorn filled her glass and the forest rang out with the sound of wine glasses touching in toast.The pair started on the first glass of wine and Erna found compulsion to tell Bjorn about her childhood. She told him all about her growing up in Buford, about her mother and affectionate grandparents. The wonderful days spent in Buford, there wasn\u2019t a single bad memory.By the time she was done talking, the bottle of wine was nearly empty.\u201cI like this flower too,\u201d Erna said, pointing to the Lily of the Valley she had picked earlier.\u201cI know,\u201d Bjorn hummed, topping up their glasses with the last of the wine.\u201cI\u2019ve loved the flower since I was a kid, but I don\u2019t think I like them any more. A flower is a just a flower and it doesn\u2019t just bloom in the greenhouse, but all over the fields here. There are so many, its strange.\u201dShe was clearly drunk, Bjorn could see that, they had drunk three glasses of wine each and starting on their fourth. He emptied the last drops into her glass.\u201cThank you, Bjorn,\u201d while drunk, it seemed that Erna was needlessly polite.He found the contrast between sober Erna and drunk Erna to be hilarious. Nothing seemed too much for the attractive drunkard to put up with in such good weather and beautiful scenery.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She wasn\u2019t a terrible drinker, she still talked the same, though slower and with droopy eyes.\u201cDid you know that today was our one year anniversary?\u201d Erna said, suddenly diverting the conversation away from how she used to play house as a kid. \u201cThe day we met was exactly one year ago today, at the founding party.\u201d\u201cWell, you have a pretty good memory for a drunkard.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not drunk,\u201d Erna said, her face became stern and bright red.Bjorn laughed and filled her glass once more, from a fresh bottle of wine.\u00a0Has it really been a year?Bjorn stared at the forest for a long moment, thinking. Golden rays of sunlight pierced through the trees canopy. The air was filled with the melodies of countless, unknown birds. It all seemed so unrealistic.A woman who had grown up in such a remote place, to suddenly be thrust into the wedding market over night. As he thought on this, it all made sense, their meeting a year ago, why she was at the festival. She might as well have had a \u2018for sale\u2019 sign around her neck. He suddenly laughed at the past days and although it had been a misunderstanding, he was glad of it, because he won in the end.\u201cThank you Bjorn,\u201d he thought she was talking about the wine. \u201cYou really saved my life,\u201d maybe she wasn\u2019t talking about the wine.\u201cIs that so?\u201d he said.\u201cYou bailed me out twice. At the Marchioness Harbor dinner and on race day. You also never filed a claim for your missing trophy.\u201dThat\u2019s because you were a much more valuable trophy.\u00a0He never spoke the words. His throat hurt, like something swelled up inside, accompanied by a strange irritability. It seemed to come more often these days and always when he thought about Erna.\u201cThat you asked me to marry you meant the world to me. I was able to escape my abusive father and escape a rotten marriage. I was able to keep the Baden Mansion safe. I owe you an ever increasing debt.\u201d\u201cErna\u2026\u201d He called her name in haste, but lost what he was going to say.It was nice that he didn\u2019t have to think too hard about Erna. She should be burdened with so many duties as the Grand Duchess, but he didn\u2019t want that for her, he wanted her to stay like a lovely deer. Quiet, harmless, and beautiful. Just someone that brought peace and love to his world.So what has changed? His anxious mind was disrupted.His train of thought was disturbed by the sound of glass on glass. Bjorn looked at his wife, as she shuffled in front of him and tinged his wine glass with hers. She smiled at him shyly. Her dramatic entrance into the world of drink was an interesting one.\u201cYou\u2019re definitely drunk now, Erna,\u201d Bjorn said.She had emptied her glass and waggled it in front of him, waiting for a top up. If she drank any more, she was going to fall asleep.\u201cYou need to stop drinking, you drunkard.\u201dBjorn took the glass and placed it to one side, then pushed Erna back against her cushions as he leaned in and kissed her. He grabbed her by the waist and pulled her in close.The distant chirrups of birds could be heard.Erna let out a sigh of resignation and her body went limp. Bjorn\u2019s chest against hers was hard and warm. He grip around her waist was firm. His body had always felt some what cool, was now as warm as the spring afternoon. If this was because she was drunk, she felt like she understood why people drank so much.\u201cI think I understand why you drink so much, it feels so good,\u201d Erna said. \u201cYou are the reason, I love you too.\u201d Her cheeks were bright red from alcohol.\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes, even though I sometimes despise you, I do like you overall. I want to keep you in my cookie jar.\u201dBjorn just laughed. Being confined to Erna\u2019s old cookie container didn\u2019t sound all that bad. She favoured all the gaudy junk she kept in that jar like fine jewellery.\u201cBy the way, Bjorn, will the interest rates increase a lot on my savings?\u201d Erna\u2019s face suddenly lit up with excitement.Drunkards were inherently random, it would appear and Erna only seemed to play up to that stereotype. Bjorn\u2019s jolly laugher joined the chorus of singing birds.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we are doing our best to keep the interest rates high.\u201dErna beamed like a lighthouse, although, that might have just been the wine making her skin cheeks glow.\u201cWhat are you going to do with all that money from the interest?\u201d Bjorn asked, settling from his mirth.\u201cI don\u2019t know, yet.\u201d\u201cThen why are you so obsessed?\u201d\u201cIts just, I want to make sure my savings are growing,\u201d Erna said, her wonky smile formed a dimple on her cheek.Bjorn looked at his wife, who was smiling as though in a lovely day dream. Bjorn shared in Erna\u2019s smile. She was a materialistic girl, despite having grown up in the bosom of mother nature. She was a very appealing character.\u201cWhen I have enough interest saved up, I will buy you a present,\u201d Erna said, suddenly serious.\u201cOh, wow, what an honour, another giant bouquet?\u201d\u201cWell, what kind of present would you like?\u201d\u201cOther than that? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cTell me, anything, except cigars, they are bad for you. Alcohol too.\u201d\u201cThen why ask me what I would like, if you\u2019ve already made up your mind?\u201d\u201cNo, I will respect your wishes,\u201d Erna looked around the field, like an answer was going to jump out at her. \u201cOh, you like horses, don\u2019t you?\u201dTies, gloves, shoes, cufflinks. Nope. Erna\u2019s ambition had blown up into something enormous.\u201cBut horses are expensive, aren\u2019t they and take up a lot of time,\u201d Erna said, resigned.Bjorn simply replied with laughter, as Erna\u2019s tone became more solemn. With her deposit, it would be a gift he would receive when he was old and grey.\u201cAnything else\u2026\u201d\u201cYou,\u201d Bjorn said.\u201cMe?\u201d Erna couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing.\u201cI think putting a ribbon around your neck would be enough, except for all the other cumbersome things you like to wear, of course,\u201d Bjorn drank the last of his wine as Erna stared at him in bewilderment.Erna had hoped this trip would prove to be romantic, despite knowing that Bjorn didn\u2019t love her and she still felt let down. She was happy that Bjorn did want her, at the very least. She wondered what this strange feeling was called, a feeling that encompassed so many different emotions.\u201cYou really are difficult, Bjorn.\u201dShe shifted into a seated position and let out a huff. She wasn\u2019t sure if the booze was to blame, but she had a hard time understanding her husband sometimes.\u201cAre you a kind person, or a heartless one? I just don\u2019t know you, other than being a pain in the neck,\u201d Erna stared at Bjorn willing the answers. \u201cI just don\u2019t know. I wish you were kind though, will you be, please?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201dBjorn let out a small sigh and reached for the wine bottle. He was certainly drinking more wine than he expected and while he filled his glass, Erna started to take her dress off.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m getting prettier for you, you told me that I look prettier the less I wear,\u201dBjorn just grinned in disbelief. Once the dress was removed, folded up and placed neatly in the basket next to her, Erna removed her underwear and folded it up, placing them in the basket with the dress.\u201cIts strange, normally I would have to work hard to look pretty. Wear the prettiest dress and do my hair in the prettiest style. Decorate myself with all sorts of pretty little ornaments. I never thought I could be pretty naked before.\u201dBjorn struggled to maintain his composure. He rubbed a hand along his cheek and looked everywhere but at Erna. Taking in the bright spring sun, the beautiful flowers swathed across the fields and even the birds song. Was it because he was more tipsy than he expected? He felt a hot flush rise to his cheeks as Erna removed the last of her under garments and stacked them neatly on top of her dress.Bjorn looked at his pocket watch through the rosy haze, no one would be looking for them for awhile yet. He gulped down the freshly poured glass of wine. Unable to organise his scattered thoughts and simply watched Erna remove her stockings, her last item of clothing.\u201cAh, the ribbon,\u201d Erna said.Erna tapped her chin with a dainty finger, as she thought on the only item of clothing she was allowed to wear. She pulled the ribbon free from her braided hair and tied it around her neck.\u201cI guess you can have me now,\u201d Erna said. \u201cNow that I am all naked and pretty for you,\u201d she said with a broad grin.\u201cErna, now you\u2026\u201d\u201cRight now,\u201d Erna interrupted Bjorn. \u201cI\u2019m giving you a present, interest free, that I can freely give, so you be nicer to me, okay?\u201d Erna said.She ran her fingers through her messy hair that hadn\u2019t quite lost the braid, then moved to right in front of Bjorn\u2019s face, closing her tiny hands around his cheek and chin. Bjorn finally made sense of the words Erna mumbled in her sleep. God, he couldn\u2019t think straight.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her pale complexion stood out when laid amongst the vibrant red and of the blanket.Their eyes met and never wavered. Ordinarily, Erna would have shrunk away from him, avoided eye contact as much as possible, but right now, she seemed to hunger for his gaze upon her. She wanted to be seen and even though Bjorn could barely focus through the alcoholic haze, he could see the shadows of tall grasses and flowers dance upon her breasts.Bjorn leaned in and kissed her, fighting the urge to rush right to the sex. He was enjoying this newly found passion in her and he could taste the wine on her lips. She responded to him with more enthusiasm than she had ever shown. She was breathing heavily and her fingers scrapped through his hair.After releasing the lock on her lips, his hands moved around to the back of her neck and he moved in to caress her. He laughed when he found the silk ribbon in the way, Erna laughed too. It was a pure of heart noise and more eccentric.Bjorn did his best to fight off the urges with deep sighs, but as the two continually embraced and kissed, he was finding it harder. In the end, he caved in and started kissing along her clavicle, down the centre of her chest and took her breast into his mouth.Erna moaned like a purring kitten. She gripped the blanket tightly, scrunching up the fabric, causing the empty bottles and glasses to topple. The sound of their clashing fell on deaf ears.Bjorn continued kissing and sucking at her creamy flesh, around her breasts, her waist and her navel. He teased her with his tongue and Erna gasped with the introduction of each new sensation. He was barely touching her, but she felt like she couldn\u2019t breath, grabbing and pulling at the picnic blanket did nothing to help her control the feeling pulsing up from her groin and chest.Bjorn lips were being exceptionally tenacious today. Erna had been counting, to try and maintain control, but she lost that idea some time ago and could do nothing now but lay back and let Bjorn do his thing. Bjorn let go, pulling away from her and giving her chance to catch her breath.As she breathed, Erna opened her eyes and looked at Bjorn. He parted her legs wide and she felt like a butterfly, landing on the picnic blanket to rest, before taking flight on fragile wings.\u201cBjorn?\u201dHe ignored her call. When she realised where he was looking and what his intentions were, she tried to cross her legs with an embarrassed scream. His firm grip prevented her and she no longer felt like the fragile butterfly.\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d she said in embarrassment.She felt shame that she had lost control during her drunkenness. She tried to free her ankles from his grip, but he just held on tighter. Sunlight gathered in the corners of his narrowed eyes, like he was trying to evaluate something.Erna stared at him in a daze. His lips curled into a sly grin and he moved to rest between her far flung thighs. Erna\u2019s confidence left her as she forgot the lessons in the bedroom in that instant.Erna\u2019s shrieks melted to moans and sent the songbirds flying off in panicked cries. She had been trying to escape Bjorn grasp, but the second she felt his tongue, she couldn\u2019t resist and melted into the pleasure of his movements. When Bjorn came back up to look at Erna panting on the ground, her hands gripped his hair and pulled him back in.Eventually, Erna turned into a trembling puddle and Bjorn kissed her shaking thighs. His lips were wet and warm. Her bosom rose and fell with dramatic heaves of breath, it was like flowers blooming within her and a kaleidoscope of butterflies dancing around her tummy.Composed just a little, Erna grabbed Bjorn and pulled him in for a kiss. She had wanted to hide the shame of her covering his lips, it tasted lewd and she didn\u2019t know what to do with that. Without meaning to, she wrapper her legs around his and thrust her hips up toward him as they kissed deeply.\u201cErna\u2026Erna hold on a second,\u201d Bjorn said, pulling away from Erna. She noted the surprise on his face.\u201cYes, yes, I know,\u201d She mumbled half to herself and sighed.She quickly fumbled with the belt and buttons of his trousers. The damn things didn\u2019t want to come off and she could hear Bjorn chuckling to himself, laughing at her inexperience. That only spurred Erna on and before he knew it, he was exposed and her thighs were wrapped around him again, pulling him in close.\u201cErna, seriously, what are you doing?\u201dEmbarrassed by the unintentional situation, Erna applied all her training before Bjorn could stop her. Shy at first, but step by step, with sincere, ladylike repose, she worked his hardened penis like it was a lollipop she had gotten at the festival.Bjorn\u2019s head went back and he let out a gasping moan. He tugged at Erna\u2019s brown hair and his eyes were wide with the pleasure of her teasing.The day when he had to calm a his hysterical wife after their first time was gone, now there was just this greed for the pleasure. He had done his best to control himself, out of respect for Buford, her birth place. That\u2019s what the feeling had been all along. This place, where little Erna had been playing house, making daisy chains and other such childish games.Erna noticed Bjorn\u2019s furrowed brow and wondered if she had hurt him accidentally, he was thicker in her mouth than she expected.\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d she asked, amidst shallow breaths of pleasure.\u201cNo,\u201d Bjorn replied, swallowing his saliva, he was salivating like a wild animal.Erna went back to sucking on the tip of Bjorn and the surprised gasps from his urged her to try and take more. It was strange, his moans made her smile grow wide.\u201cErna\u2026stop it,\u201d Bjorn whispers, but Erna was unrelenting.Bjorn tried to pay homage to the fertile land around them, which grew the best grapes, made the best wine. He didn\u2019t know what they did to the wine, but it certainly had a profound effect on his wife. Buford deserved the title of the best wine in the land, no, the continent.\u201cStop, Erna, stop it,\u201d he cried it ecstasy.He grabbed a fistful of Erna\u2019s hair and even as he told her to stop, pushed himself into her mouth. She pulled away and he didn\u2019t stop her.\u201cBjorn?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t, please, don\u2019t stop,\u201d he whimpered.Hesitantly, Erna continued.He recalled all the deeds of all the unfortunate things he had left behind and was barely able to endure it. Today was the day to celebrate Buford\u2019s amazing ability to create the finest pleasures in many ways. If it wasn\u2019t for the alcohol, he might have had to endure considerable humiliation.Erna let out a high pitched, surprised squeal, muffled by a full mouth and swallowed. Bjorn went limp and a sleepy look rested on his face.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you,\u201d Erna said, taking a breath and sitting to face Bjorn. \u201cThis is your taste?\u201d she said with sultry words as she kissed him\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would say it was a pleasant taste, but it was your taste, so I like it.\u201dThat final blow really stunned Bjorn and he looked at the once naive girl. Was this really the same Erna? He had raised a wild beast.Seeing Erna blur her consciousness with a bright smile, Bjorn was amazed and understood why Leonid wanted to stay in college to teach the younger students.Bjorn practically threw himself at Erna, who accepted him eagerly, even before he had a chance to strip down fully.She became awash with unbearable intoxication, which only grew stronger with each crashing wave of pleasure. Everything became hyper vivid, from the soft, cotton clouds that hung lazily in the sapphire blue sky, to the emerald grass that danced in the gentle breeze. Even the lilies and daisy\u2019s looked like flickering gemstones on the grass swathed hills. Everything in her rose tinted vision was dazzlingly beautiful, Bjorn above all. The man inside her.Bjorn thrust into her with ever growing force, pushing her into the soft earth and through it. A little more, just a little more.Under him, caught by impatience, Erna moaned and writhed as he did, their movements were synchronised. Bjorn knew that under her breathy ecstasy, she was feeling a little pain too, but that was out of his control and she practically begged for him.What has changed?The question he could not answer only made him more impatient and fierce with his thrusting. He tried to block out everything else in the world, except the woman under him. He couldn\u2019t believe she was so amicable to do it outside, in the open air like this.When their eyes met, Erna parted her lips in such a small and delicate manner, like she was eating little bits of fruit, and let out a cry. Bjorn kissed her and Erna draped all over him. She found him to be exceptionally gentle and comforting, but now Bjorn was only interested in one thing and Erna felt the rise.Erna held on tightly, gripping Bjorn in a bear hug and Bjorn strained, paused in his movements and his hips spasmed wildly. Erna felt his warmth spread inside her.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna looked about in a half daze, trying to pull the world back into focus. The blurred leaves of the tree danced above her head, making shadows ripple over her body. She struggled to catch her breath and the view quickly changed. Where the unfocused branches swayed, it was replaced by the sharp focus of Bjorn\u2019s face.While their sweaty bodies cooled, the two remained silent in each other\u2019s arms. She was worried about what to do if she was heavy, but decided she could be a little selfish and snuggled deeper into his arms.\u201cAs for you,\u201d Erna mumbled, her thoughts starting to organise themselves again, \u201cyours is warm, a bit too big and hard, but still soft.\u201d\u201cShut up, you drunkard,\u201d Bjorn teased.\u201cI like it, it tastes good. I\u2019m a lady, so I won\u2019t be using harsh words, but please don\u2019t think that I am too good to not use them.\u201dThe beast he had raised whispered softly into the pleasant selling wind. A tiny sigh of bittersweet resignation left Bjorn\u2019s lips and he wrapped his arms around Erna tighter. After such a thoughtful present, it was his time to show gratitude and generosity.He was willing to accept that deal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She squeezed her eyes closed tight and counted to ten. Once she reached ten, the nausea faded away.Today would have been the perfect day to go for a walk, but she was having trouble even just standing without the threat of throwing up making itself known.\u201cYour Highness, maybe\u2026\u201d Lisa started to say.\u201cNo, Lisa, it\u2019s just a little, I\u2019m just not feeling well.\u201d Erna said.\u201cWould it not be safer to call a doctor?\u201d\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need a doctor.\u201dAt the sound of the voice, sneaking up behind her, Lisa spun round and saw the Prince looming over her. He had already returned from having breakfast with the Baroness.\u201cMy wife is simply dealing with the side effects of too much drinking.\u201d\u201cBjorn!\u201d Erna scolded.She was embarrassed by her state and didn\u2019t want Bjorn to go around and announce it to everyone. Lisa rolled her eyes and with a sigh, left the couple in the room.\u201cWhy did you tell her that?\u201d\u201cDid I lie?\u201d Bjorn asked, as he nonchalantly walked over and sat on the end of the bed.\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Embarrassed by the memory, Erna looked over at the window, the daylight was so bright. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d She knew the lie probably wouldn\u2019t work, she remembered everything.Erna remembered vividly having to have Bjorn carry her back to the mansion in her dishevelled state. The shock on her Grandmother\u2019s face to see a very drunk granddaughter and sent her off to bed to sleep her off. She remembered the way the room kept spinning every time she closed her eyes, making her dizzy as she was trying to sleep. Worst of all, she remembered the horrible pain in her head when she woke up the next morning.\u201cHey, chaste lady, be honest. You remember everything, don\u2019t you?\u201d Bjorn said with a sarcastic tone.\u201cNo, no I don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThe more you deny it, the more miserable you look.\u201d\u201cWell, I think I remember some of it,\u201d Erna offered up the compromise.\u201cOkay, if that makes you feel more comfortable.\u201d\u201cI thought alcohol was a good thing, but it seems I was sorely mistaken.\u201dBjorn laughed at Erna\u2019s confession. She stared at the pattern of the wallpaper, as if shell shocked.\u201cIs this what happens when you always drink?\u201d Erna asked Bjorn earnestly.\u201cIt is when you drink as much as you did,\u201d Bjorn let out a renewed chuckle.\u201cHow are you okay? You drank so much more than me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not new to drinking, like you,\u201d Bjorn playfully ruffled Erna\u2019s hair.Erna smoothed out her messy hair. Even though she had been quite drunk last night and this morning, she seemed to be slowly returning to her usual, composed self.\u201cAre you able to attend dinner tonight?\u201d\u201cDinner?\u201d\u201cYes, the Baroness is putting on a farewell dinner for us.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Erna let out a shocked noise.The thought of having to leave Buford tomorrow weighed heavily on Erna, she so longed to stay in Buford, to never return to the city again, but she had duties as the Grand Duchess.\u201cI just need to rest a little longer and I will be fine,\u201d Erna calmly said, shaking her head free of all the excuses to delay her departure.Erna hated the constant scrutiny and criticism that accompanied her every action. The disdainful rumours that spread, constantly comparing her to Princess Gladys, followed her about the City like an unwanted stink. She had no desire to return to a life of being despised and treated like the villain. She wished to remain in Buford, enjoying the wondrous days like she was a child again.As Erna wondered around her beautiful world within her mind, her imagination always brought her back to Bjorn. She could see his face everywhere and yet, if she remained in Buford, he would be gone from her, her Prince, the knight in a royal suit that had saved her life, with a cocky smile.From beneath the cosy blanket, Erna gently extended her hand, like a turtle coming out of its shell and held Bjorn\u2019s hand. His eyes, which had been studying the view beyond the window, looked down at her. As their gazes locked, Bjorn smiled softly and suddenly a warmth spread through Erna that felt like someone was tickling her deep inside her tummy. It was a moment she would cherish forever.She had to be patient.After blowing out the cobwebs of her mind, she was able to smile back up at him. She would be fine, she reasoned, so long as she was with him and although he made it very difficult for her, she loved him very much.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? If there is something wrong, just tell me,\u201d Bjorn said, staring at Erna. \u201cWhat are you feeling? Even if you feel the need to use harsh words, I don\u2019t mind, I would rather you tell me when something is wrong.\u201dErna gasped a breath and squeezed her eyes closed, attempting to evade Bjorn\u2019s inquiry.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me? Yesterday, we spoke all the time,\u201d Bjorn tapped the side of her nose.\u201cWhat? Well, that, I think, belongs in the half of my memory I don\u2019t remember.\u201dDespite feeling shame for her actions yesterday, a part of her was happy and she was content that she was able to bring Bjorn some happiness. She had made him laugh so much.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this is going to be a little difficult,\u201d the middle aged publicist said.His smile was somewhat awkward, but yet unmistakably conveyed his disappointment at the refusal. She recognised the expression well, having seen it quite a few times already.\u201cThis is my brother\u2019s manuscript, of which you can be certain. Once again\u2026\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d he cut off Catherine Owen\u2019s plea. \u201cThese are beautiful sentences, yes, very distinctly Gerald Owen, that I do not doubt. But Miss Owen, you must understand the repercussions if I were to publish this work.\u201d\u201cSo? This is about the truth, it must be spoken.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you ever think that the truth would be damaging to your brother\u2019s reputation?\u201d the old man shot Catherine an admonishing look, as if she was a child. \u201cThe royal family will not sit idle on this and not only Lars, but Lechen also. Your brother, the genius poet, who got involved with a married Princess and had an illegitimate child, your brother will be ruined.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Catherine said sadly.She took a deep breath and with no other choice, accepted the reality. After discovering the damming manuscript, she had all the same thoughts. Many have told her that it would be better if she hid the truth and protected her brother\u2019s honour. Nevertheless, she was unable to divert her mind from this task. Princess Gladys was basking in the limelight by exploiting the anguish and sorrow of others.\u201cWhat my brother wanted was the truth, not a facade of honour. I have an obligation to follow his will. If you don\u2019t have the courage to publish the truth, I\u2019ll find someone with a backbone.\u201d Having repeated the same spiel, Catherine spun around and left. She might have visited every publisher in Lars, but that didn\u2019t mean it was time to give up.So, where now then?With each step down the stairs out of the publicists office, Catherine\u2019s mind raced with thoughts on her next move. Just as she was contemplating going to Lechen, a young man suddenly appeared at the bottom of the stairs. To her surprise, it was a young publisher she had met with before.\u201cMiss Owen, I\u2019m glad I managed to find you, do you have a moment to talk?\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Nestled under the shade of a towering Ash tree, the table in the garden blended seamlessly with its rustic landscape. The tableware and candlestick holders exuded a timeless elegance, hinting at a cherished history. The food on the table provided a hearty and unpretentious feast.Bjorn sat at the table, sipping the wine in his glass and watched as Erna spoke on in her usual manner, with her Grandmother. She looked so pretty, even in a simple muslin dress decorated with elaborate floral patterns. He wondered if her hangover had finally dissipated, as she complimented the Baroness on a well presented meal. The Baroness watched her Granddaughter with bright, adoring eyes twinkling in the candlelight.\u201cHow about staying in Schuber during the summer season?\u201d Bjorn made a suggestion out of impulse.All the most prestigious noble families flocked to Schuber for their summer vacations. Even those who spoke carelessly about Erna couldn\u2019t object.\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you to offer, Your Highness, but I like it here. Big cities are far too crowded for my liking,\u201d her tone was gentle and kind. \u201cBut you are always welcome to stay here, whenever you wish, that\u2019s enough for this old lady, right Erna?\u201dNo, not so.\u00a0Was what Erna wanted to say, but found it difficult to express her true feelings and instead, she rolled up her napkin and clutched it tightly. Her desire to remain in Buford was as strong as her reluctance to share her true feelings. Although her grandmother was probably already aware of the vicious rumours, she didn\u2019t know what would happen if she were to see the situation with her own eyes.\u201cYes, Grandma,\u201d Erna lied, \u201cI will come back again before the end of the year.\u201dDespite her apprehension, Erna spoke with unmistakable sincerity, reassuring her grandmother that she would come back soon. If not before the end of the busy summer season, then before the mid-winter festivities at the very least.\u201cYes and I will be here, waiting for you,\u201d the Baroness smiled and nodded, as if conveying an understanding.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The Ducal couple left Buford the next morning. They left at an early hour and the Baroness saw them off with a warm smile. The parting was a fortunate one, as Erna was acting more resolute than the Baroness was expecting.There had been so much Baroness Baden wanted to say to Erna, but seeing her resolute granddaughter, she ended up hiding it all behind a smile. She didn\u2019t want to be a burden and make Erna\u2019s heart heavier than it already was.Erna had attempted to turn back to her Grandmother, like there was more she wanted to say, but the Baroness was already embracing Bjorn. The way he came out to the carriage, holding Erna\u2019s hand, meant he was definitely family now. He had to be her source of support.\u201cPlease take good care of our Erna, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cOf course I will,\u201d Bjorn readily agreed at the heartfelt words.The procession, led by the carriage carrying the Grand Duke and Duchess, slowly made its way down the country road, leaving a small cloud of dust in its wake. Erna waved her hand out of the window, as the carriage disappeared from view. At that moment, she didn\u2019t care if her unladylike behaviour was to make the sky fall.The Baroness stood at the entrance to the mansion until the last carriage was gone, then finally made her way inside. She was greeted by the golden light of the morning, streaming in through the windows.\u201cMy lady,\u201d a servant said as the Baroness made her way into her bedroom. \u201cHer Highness asked me to give you this,\u201d the maid said, presenting a small package.\u201cWhat, Erna did?\u201dThe Baroness accepted the packed with a hint of surprise on her face. As she carefully unwrapped it, she found a book contained within. The Baroness smiled and let out a low chuckle, it was a book of crossword puzzles.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As she did so, she realised that her brush had fallen and was rolling down the desk. The brush fell to the floor and left a splash of red which threatened to stain the carpet.\u201cCome in,\u201d Erna called, as she grabbed a cloth to dab at the stain.\u201cOh, leave it, Your Highness,\u201d Lisa said coming into the room and seeing her mistress on hands and knees. \u201cWhy are you doing the work of a maid?\u201d\u201cBecause it was my fault, I fell asleep.\u201d\u201cThe weather is getting hotter, its easy to doze off in this heat.\u201d Lisa waved a hand as if it were nothing to worry about.Erna had been napping a lot lately. It was inevitably the topic of conversation and rumours were going round that she had actually fell asleep during an opera show not too long ago.While it was certainly Erna\u2019s mistake, it didn\u2019t necessarily warrant the intense criticism that she received. All the same, the people were outraged and lashed out at the Grand Duchess, who was no better than a savage they couldn\u2019t relate to. They did not hesitate to compare her to Gladys, who was known for her class and elegance.\u201cThis is all because you are so diligent. When you work so hard, your body can\u2019t keep up. You need to take a break when you have free time.\u201d Lisa noticed that the desk was a scattered mess of tools and materials for making corsages, \u201cwhat are these things?\u201d\u201cI wondered what it would be like to give summer flowers to the people of he Grand Duke\u2019s residence,\u201d Erna responded with a cool smile. \u201cI think everyone likes the corsage flowers I gave them last time.\u201d\u201cThey did, but why do you go to such trouble?\u201dErna found herself unable to speak the words she was thinking, she knew it was all pointless, so she just smiled and nodded.Lisa wanted to tell Erna of the servants who gossiped the most behind Erna\u2019s back, even after accepting her gifts, but Lisa held it in, it would do no good. Its not that she didn\u2019t understand Erna\u2019s desire to do something good for the servants. Still, compared to the beginning, she was making some progress.\u201cOh, Your Highness, lets sort this out later, we need to go look for presents.\u201d\u201cPresents?\u201d\u201cYes, the goods the Prince bought at the fair have just arrived. When you see it, you will be surprised.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Bjorn had just gotten back to sleep after enduring the noise of the energetic madmen rowing up and down the river right outside his bedroom window.\u201cBjorn, Bjorn, are you awake?\u201d Erna burst into his room, all energy and no politeness for knocking.Erna ran over and sat on the side of the bed, then began to fervently shake Bjorn until he acknowledged he was awake. He let out a long sigh and looked up at his excited wife. Having played poker until sunrise, he had only just gotten home and into bed, it felt like midnight to him. Although it was not the opportune time to be woken up, Erna had no consideration for the time.\u201cBjorn, all the presents have arrived from the fair, all the things you bought.\u201d\u201cI\u2026know,\u201d Bjorn said lazily.He expressed his annoyance with a low groan and turning away from Erna. He pulled the sheets over his head. Despite his clear sign of not wanting to be disturbed, Erna refused to take any notice and continued to press the matter.\u201cWe need to talk, Bjorn, please.\u201d\u201cTalk, about what?\u201d\u201cThe gifts, there are too many gifts,\u201d Erna shouted, her voice devoid of any traces of joy now.Bjorn broke out from the sheets and say up as though he had been doused with cold water. Erna\u2019s pensive expression reflected in Bjorn\u2019s sleepy eyes, it was a look he had not seen on her before.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you,\u201d Erna said, noticing Bjorn\u2019s irritated look. \u201cBut still, I can\u2019t have all the gifts and we must send back the ones I don\u2019t want, okay?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cPeople\u2026\u201d Erna said, her eyes were intense, she was sure he already knew the answer.\u201cHa, right, people,\u201d Bjorn shut his eyes, trying his best to hold back the anger. He took slow, deliberate breaths, his neck muscles tensed and twitched. \u201cNo matter what you do, the people will think and talk about what ever they want, believe what suits them.\u201dBjorn turned and looked at Erna again, his eyes were filled with icy coldness. This didn\u2019t sit well with Erna, who had been increasingly preoccupied with her reputation of late. Her attempts at increasing her standing had all been in vain, just like Bjorn\u2019s constant cold and dismissive demeanour towards her.After a moment of deep thought, Erna replied with a look of terror on her face, \u201cI know, but later, I\u2019ll have to make excuses to mollify those people.\u201dBjorn let out a dejected laugh as he mulled over his wife\u2019s words, feeling as if they were dirty words. He couldn\u2019t help but think that it was unfair on him to have to spend his money on his wife\u2019s folly.It would be nice to just be happy once in awhile, but Erna was always like this, she couldn\u2019t just enjoy the little things. He understood her behaviour and her desire to get the people on her side, if to just stop the rumours, but did she always have to make it irritating for him?\u201cWhat are your intentions, to carry on as if your were dead? Just be a breathing statue or something,\u201d Bjorn stroked his fingers through Erna\u2019s hair. \u201cNo matter what you do, the people will gossip, using the pretext that you are an incompetent Duchess, who can do nothing right.\u201dErna looked hurt, but Bjorn showed no concern. Such was life as the Grand Duchess of Schuber. Any woman who fulfilled that role after Princess Gladys, would have been prone to the same treatment, no matter who Bjorn chose for his second wife.Erna had willingly accepted the role, without any clue as to what the price would be and as such, she had an obligation to endure. Bjorn hated how his wife still clung to this thought and he couldn\u2019t help but mock himself for lingering on it himself.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dwell on it so much, because the more you care, the more persistent and cruel the people will seem to be. No matter what you say or do.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Erna\u2019s voice trembled slightly.Erna understood what Bjorn was trying to get her to see, but detaching herself from emotion was not so easy for her. She couldn\u2019t help but hear all the ridicule, whether she wanted to or not. Her sorrowed deepened when she thought about all those articles written about her, stacked up in her Grandmothers drawer.\u201cYes, Erna,\u201d Bjorn nodded. \u201cYes it is.\u201dHis tone was light, but his sincerity was unmistakable. He seemed unfazed by all the accusations and speculations that were hurled at him. His attitude was completely indifferent, like it wasn\u2019t him the people criticised.Erna pouted and lowered her head without saying another word. Not liking her reaction, Bjorn gently grasped her chin and lifted her head to look into her eyes.\u201cHey, we can bare it together, Erna, you\u2019re not alone. It is, unfortunately, the nature of our lives right now.\u201dHis grey eyes were exquisite, sparkling like finely crafted jewels. She was an extravagant Duchess and wholly unfamiliar with what that meant.Rebuke and a glare flashed along his face, as if anticipating the chaos that was about to grip the city. It was unfortunate, but Bjorn couldn\u2019t blame the people this time.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, \u201c Erna said, \u201cand thank you.\u201dErna expressed sincerity as she said thank you, almost exaggerating it. Only then did Bjorn let go of his wife\u2019s face. The shouts of the rowers out of the window suddenly came in clear as they passed by the window.\u201cThose crazy bastards,\u201d Bjorn muttered and shook his head.Bjorn got up from the bed and Erna watched his nakedness bathe in the brilliant light of the sun. She realised she had been staring and averted her gaze, embarrassed. Bjorn chuckled, amused at her bashful behaviour.\u201cOh, by the way, why did you buy that huge elephant?\u201d Erna said, watching Bjorn walk over to the window and bite down on a cigar.\u201cElephant? I wasn\u2019t aware I had bought an Elephant,\u201d wrinkles appeared on his forehead as he thought.His thoughts were interrupted as a knock came from the door. Greg appeared and the embarrassment was clear as he realised Bjorn was naked and the Grand Duchess was also there.\u201cWhat is it Greg?\u201d Bjorn said.Greg looked at the Grand Duchess nervously, as he walked across the room to hand Bjorn a folder. With narrowed eyes, Bjorn glanced through the report.\u201cIs there something going on?\u201d Erna asked Studying Bjorn\u2019s expression of worry.\u201cNo,\u201d Bjorn answered calmly, handing the folder back to Greg. The Butler couldn\u2019t leave the room fast enough. \u201cIts nothing.\u201d\u201cYour expression says different, are you really okay?\u201dBjorn set aside his cigar as if releasing a lingering emotion and then placed his hands in his wife\u2019s lap. As they kissed, Erna\u2019s shoulders quivered slightly. She did not refuse him, she could never refuse him.\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Bjorn whispered. It wasn\u2019t a lie.Walter Hardy\u2019s greed was still within his control and the reigns would need to be tightened, although the process may be somewhat difficult and chaotic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cSorry, but this is all we have to say on the matter,\u201d despite his polite demeanour, the directors expression conveyed a strong sense of determination.Walter Hardy couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing and stared at the director in disbelief. After all, the bank was owned by his son-in-law and he was the father of the Princess of Lechen. How could the director refuse to lend him money, not even a few pennies.\u201cHave you forgotten who I am?\u201d Walter said.\u201cNo, you are Viscount Hardy, last I checked.\u201d\u201cWell then, there seems to be some kind of mistake.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Viscount Hardy, it\u2019s a board decision, a meeting presided over by the Prince, Grand Duke Dniester himself. There is no firm collateral, the paper work is incomplete and above all, it has been unanimously concluded that this is an unprofitable venture. There is nothing we are willing to do about it.\u201d\u201cCollateral? She\u2019s my daughter. What more collateral do I need?\u201d Walter Hardy\u2019s face turned bright red.People had been doing their best to impress the father-in-law of the Grand Duchess, until recently. It seems that in just the last week, everyone had changed their minds. Walter was even more stunned that it was the Prince himself that disrupted his reputation.He felt like the one man who could afford to give away a little coin was acting entirely selfish. He felt anger rise in him toward Erna, for making a fool out of him. Walter even considered the possibility that the Prince had lost interest in his second wife, given the well known reputation of the Grand Duchess. Given that there was no news of a child, it was no surprise that the problematic Prince had lost interest.\u201cSorry,\u201d the director said insincerely.Walter had to restrained himself from slapping the director and left the VIP room at Freyr Bank. He got into the waiting carriage at the front of the building and his frustrations came out as spontaneous swearing.The prince had settled all his debts that he had been swindled into, to maintain the dignity of the Hardy family. So it wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t received anything from him.He had provided only the barest minimum to help him get to his feet. While it helped, he was hoping that he could use his ties to Bjorn Dniester for more of a financial gain. He was not asking for money from him, he was willing to borrow it legitimately, so why was he still given such disgrace?Nervously biting his lip, Walter anxiously waited for his carriage to take him to the mansion. He worried that Erna\u2019s lifespan as the Grand Duchess might not last too much longer.Once at the mansion, Walter stomped hurriedly to his wife\u2019s bedroom.\u201cBrenda, what about the drug, have you told Erna about the drug?\u201dBrenda sighed at Walter\u2019s intrusion, coming into her room without so much as a knock.\u201cAre you deaf or something, I told you before, the child is flat out refusing.\u201d\u201cJust like her damn mother, so stubborn, it\u2019s definitely a Baden family curse. She can\u2019t even get pregnant properly.\u201dThe words of Walter were filled with raw hatred, so much so that Brenda was taken aback by the venom in them. How could a man say such things about his own daughter. She thought about Baroness Baden, who hadn\u2019t given birth until after ten years of being in a relationship. Annette died during child birth. Though his words were harsh, he did seem to have a point, the Baden bloodline struggled to bare children.\u201cMaybe she just needs time,\u201d Brenda said.\u201cWhy, you think he\u2019s cheating again?\u201d Walter said.\u201cIts not that, but if Erna is like the rest of the Baden\u2019s, it wont be long before is kicked out from the position of Grand Duchess before she is able to get pregnant.\u201d\u201cWell, look at Princess Gladys. So, I have to finish before then, but what am I going to do with this? We have already promised dividends tot he investors. I even told them that the Prince would make up for the shortfall.\u201dThe sound of Walter\u2019s footsteps, as he paced around the room, could be heard through the mansion. Brenda watched her husband silently, before moving to her cupboard and retrieved a box from its depths. She wore a determined look on her face.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Walters eyes went wide as Brenda revealed the jewels in the box.\u201cIts my collection,\u201d Brenda whispered conspiratorially. \u201cEven though the Grand Duchess is a country bumpkin, despised within the social world, she is gaining popularity with the young people, who have no experience in the world. To that extent, I am impatient to try and get in with these crowds and have them accept my gifts.\u201d\u201cBut even with this, will it be enough?\u201d\u201cIt would be better if we had more,\u201d Brenda shrugged lightly, her eyes lighting up with joy. \u201cThere is a trader I am most attracted to, would you like to meet him? He is from a lowly background, but his pocket book has just as much depth as any aristocratic family in Lechen.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Bjorn had come to recognise that Walter Hardy had ambition and drive, if that could have been honed properly, he could be a formidable business man, but Walter always directed his attention to terrible and trivial matters.Bjorn laughed as he pulled himself out of the bathtub. Walter Hardy\u2019s business plans were always doomed to fail from very early on and with the help of Greg, under Bjorn\u2019s instruction, none of Walter\u2019s terrible idea\u2019s were allowed to see the light of day.There was the problem that Walter was a lot more persistent that Bjorn gave him credit for, so much so that Bjorn couldn\u2019t help but feel awe at Walters persistence. There was only one other person who was more so, Gladys Hartford, who was the single most determined person Bjorn knew.Walter was kind of clever. He had successfully managed to materialise a plan and even brought it to the bank. He took over an insolvent commercial association and converted it into a stock company. This was much easier than registering as a stock company from inception, it was pretty clever.Even when Bjorn looked at the falsified financial documents, he couldn\u2019t help but express admiration. Walter had recovered from being scammed to turning into the scammer, it was truly impressive growth. Bjorn almost felt sorry that he was going to have to crush the man before his skills as a swindler properly flourished.Bjorn turned off the night stand light and crawled into bed next to his wife. How could this amazing woman have come from such a disgraceful man? As he admired his wife, he concisely stroked her brown hair, which had become a dishevelled mess on the pillow.The image of a young girl, bathing in the scorching rays of the sun, trying to erase her fathers influence on her. The child seemed pitiful, yet lovable, having learned the secrets of life too early. She longed for her hair to resemble the golden rays of sunlight she bathed in.Although he had never seen the little girl before, Bjorn could vividly imagine Erna on that fateful day. It would appear the Baroness\u2019 story had a greater impact on him than he first thought.Does her hair resemble that of Walter Hardy\u2019s?In retrospect, Bjorn never really noticed. He didn\u2019t put much mind into whether things looked the same. To him, it didn\u2019t really matter, regardless if her hair was blonde, brunette, red head or even pink or purple. What truly mattered to him was what was on the inside, the integrity of a person and Erna was Erna. The sweetest, naive and beautiful young woman who cared too much. He couldn\u2019t help but think the brown hair actually suited her better.He leaned in and planted a kiss on his sleeping wife\u2019s cheek. He could smell a sweet fragrance on her hair. The kiss on the cheek became a kiss on her forehead, which was marked by a slight sun burn.\u201cBjorn?\u201d Erna mumbled as Bjorn kissed her lips.Her eyes fluttered, struggling to open properly, revelling water coloured eyes that were marred with sleep.Bjorn kissed her on the lips once more, before angling himself to be on top of Erna. Though she allowed it, she did shrug her shoulders when Bjorn tried to remove her night gown.\u201cBjorn, not tonight, I\u2019m tired.\u201d\u201cRest then,\u201d Bjorn said with a soft smile, continuing to unbutton her gown.He started to kiss behind her ears and down the side of her neck. Erna accepted him, at first, but her expression changed when Bjorn kissed and sucked down the nape of her neck.\u201cNot there,\u201d Erna suddenly demanded, slapping Bjorn away.Bjorn respected his wife\u2019s wishes and regretfully moved away. He found compensation in burying his face into Erna\u2019s bosom. Erna started to breathe deeper and grumbled softly, sleepily, as Bjorn played with her nipples. There was a mixture of the sounds of pleasure and pain. She seemed to be more sensitive than usual.\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201dErna blushed as she lightly nodded. Though she looked a little unwell, a little paler than usual, Bjorn had reached the point of no return and was unable to stop himself. Or so he thought. There was a cool sense of shame that doused the heat of lust in him. When Bjorn looked up at Erna, she smiled down at him as she hugged the scruff of his neck.Bjorn moved slowly, repeating his actions, thinking he could stoke the flames of passion once more. He knew that asking for more would be greedy, he didn\u2019t want to ask either, he found it amusing.Due to her slight fever, he found Erna was a lot softer and a lot warmer inside. It threatened to steal away his control, but he did his absolute best to work as slowly and gently as possible. He still found enjoyment in going softly and slowly. Every time he looked up, he saw Erna enraptured by the gentle pleasure and smiled warmly.At the moment where Bjorn felt his desire starting to take over, Erna opened her legs a little more, making it easier for Bjorn to move.He sat up and looked down at the woman he couldn\u2019t find a single thing not to like. His heart beat hard in his chest, filled with more than just desire, but love and that was a much heavier burden to bare.Erna let out a soft moan, eyes closed and lost in Bjorn\u2019s hypnotic movements. She was so beautiful, laid out before him, her body was a study in perfection. Bjorn couldn\u2019t help but allow his hands to follow the sweeps and curves of her form.It felt that God had put a man like Walter Hardy into the world, just to drive this angel into his arms. It was an empty sentiment and Bjorn pushed it from his mind.He forced himself to concentrate on Erna and as he leaned forward again, to kiss her, she looked at him with vacant eyes, lost in the pleasure he poured into her. Surprisingly, Erna pulled him in close and bit down on his clavicle. Even her biting felt good to him.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Bjorn drifted off to a comfortable sleep, feeling completely satisfied with the intimacy he had shared with his wife.He was later awakened by a dream, which quickly dissipated as he stared out into the clear darkness typical of a summer night. Despite the dream fading away, he still felt a sense of warmth and comfort lingering within him.Bjorn laid on his back for awhile, before turning his head to look at his wife, only to find the spot vacant. It would appear he had been awoken by his wife\u2019s absence. He frowned and sat up, looking about the dark room. Erna was nowhere to be found.He knew she had to be here some where, but the anxiety within him did not go away. He laid back down, but could find no rest. He rolled out of bed and that was when he saw a thin line of light coming in from under the drawing room door. Bjorn let out a sigh and walked toward the light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayGently, he opened up the door and found the drawing room filled with all the gifts he had bought Erna. The gifts were laid out in a haphazard manner and turned the room into chaos.Mrs Fitz had suggested in calling an upholsterer, to tidy up the room a little. Bjorn saw no need, this wasn\u2019t a guest room and he liked seeing Erna surrounded by the gifts he had bought her.Bjorn leaned on the door frame as he surveyed the scene. Erna was sat at her desk, the faint sound of tapping keys clacking away as she worked in silence. He was amused by the fact that his wife had snuck out in the middle of the night to practice her typing. She studied one of several textbooks spread out over the table and a large, gold elephant stood at her side, as if on guard duty. Bjorn chuckled.Mrs Fitz had the perfect word for the elephant, \u2018eyesore\u2019 and she had argued strongly to have the statue removed. She didn\u2019t want to have to look at it. Erna insisted on keeping it, saying that it was a gift and she would find a use for it.Bjorn strode across the room with long strides, not thinking that Erna was going to look back at him. She was busy typing away, trusting in the watchful sight of the elephant. She didn\u2019t raise her head until he had stopped at the desk.\u201cBjorn,\u201d Erna said in surprise.\u201cI thought you said you were tired, what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI woke up early and couldn\u2019t get back to sleep, I should not have napped during the day.\u201dAs she turned to talk to him, he could smell the sweetness on her much stronger, then realised she was sucking on a sweet and saw a glass jar of them next to the typewriter. Erna noticed where Bjorn was looking.\u201cOh, these?\u201dErna became paranoid that Bjorn was going to scold her for behaving like a child, but he just smiled sweetly at her. She swallowed hard, pushing down the guilt. She had over reacted, she noticed that she had been a little sensitive recently. She found herself becoming more wary of the people around her and even the slightest sound of laughter, she couldn\u2019t help but think they were laughing at her.\u201cAre you really planning on becoming a typist?\u201d Bjorn said, prodding at the books about the table.\u201cI didn\u2019t think the person who gifted me this would say such a thing.\u201d\u201cIndeed, but I thought you would only play with it in moderation,\u201d Bjorn said, pushing a random key on the typewriter.Erna furrowed her brow in annoyance at the misspelling now on the piece of paper, but her frustration dissipated as Bjorn laughed.Erna\u2019s sharp emotions faded away and she wondered if there was anything this man could do that would truly make her angry. All she felt was a sweet comfort for him and her laugh chorused with his.\u201cSince it is still a git from you, I am trying to make use of it as best I can. It\u2019s still a little awkward and clunky, but I think it\u2019ll be nice to be able to write quickly, once I get used to it. I can\u2019t write letters just yet.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Bjorn sounded genuinely interested.\u201cThey say that a receipt-like letter, written on a machine like this, damages a ladies dignity.\u201d\u201cMrs Fitz?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0 Erna\u2019s smile faltered, like she could still her the old woman\u2019s admonition. Bjorn\u2019s expression mimicked Erna\u2019s as he recalled similar memories. They shared that moment together and Bjorn could feel deeper connections to Erna take root within him, because of that, Erna found a little courage.\u201cIf I learn to type, could I write you letters with this?\u201d\u201cLetters?\u201d\u201cYes, you like receipts.\u201dAlthough Bjorn had been speaking seriously, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh heartily in that moment. The good mood in the room was broken by the sudden chime of the Grandfather Clock in the hallway.\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d Bjorn held out his hand. \u201cI think you should put off your dream until tomorrow, my little typist.\u201dErna looked up at him and took his large, sleek hand. All the worry and bitterness fell away from her. She felt grateful that she was being a good wife. With nothing but joy and love in her heart, she held his hand tightly.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Three days later, in the afternoon, Bjorn found a receipt from the Grand Duchess he had been warned about. Mrs Fitz brought in with the rest of the mail. He laughed heartily, recalling the beautiful midsummer dawn, a memory that remained fairly vivid.\u201cRead it, my prince.\u201dIt seemed like Erna was successful in pulling Mrs Fitz into her little plots, making her an accomplice. It was evident that his wife had a knack for bewitching grandmothers. He opened the letter with a letter opener and read it.\u2018My Dearest Bjorn.Thank you for the wonderful gifts.\u00a0I will cherish them for the rest of my life. The elephant statue is a bit frightening, but I think I can get used to it if I look at it for a long time.As the summer changes to autumn, it seems that it has already been a year since we got married. I am determined to keep my promise as a good wife for you, but I am sorry to say that I still have a lot to learn. Never the less, I will continue to work hard.I was very happy to marry you. Thanks to you, I realised that the walls that surround my small world were actually doors. I will never forget the countless doors we have opened together over the past year and the world beyond.What was the past year like for you?I hope that you were happy.I wonder if the moments that are precious to me, share the same importance to you.Were we a good couple?Will we be able to do better in the future?\u2019Bjorn read through the series of questions, he felt like he could actually hear Erna\u2019s voice asking them from right behind him. He could almost see the serious frown she always wore when concerned, pressing down hard on the question mark key.\u2018I hope that we can continue to open many doors together in the future. Someday, I will work even harder to become a person who can give you everything.Thank you for being so patient with me. I wish you all the best, for many days to come.Your Wife, Erna Dniester.\u2019Erna\u2019s handwritten signature was added to the bottom of the letter, adding a personal touch to the message. Bjorn\u2019s eyes lingered on the writing for a long time.Wife.He rolled the words around his tongue for a long moment, savouring the sweetness of the memories it held.Wife, my wife Erna.Mrs Fitz stood on the other side of the desk, watching Bjorn\u2019s expression change and noticed the special significance behind it.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow about writing a reply, Your Highness?\u201dShe was well aware of how hard Erna had worked on that letter and how much she wanted to repay her husband\u2019s gifts with heartfelt words. She hoped that Bjorn could reciprocate, but he shook his head casually.\u201cLater,\u201d he whispered to himself.\u201cYour Highness?\u201d\u201cWe live in the same house, so, why?\u201dBjorn smiled and moved onto the next letter, while Mrs Fitz, knowing the princes stubbornness, refrained from pushing the matter any further.Bjorn despised writing letters, something that persisted from his childhood. His tutors had said that he would be great at writing letters, in war time, to his enemies. Of course, being the prince, he had the ability to write any number of good natured letters, if he put his mind to it, but Bjorn didn\u2019t have the mind to do so.In the end, the Royal Family used ghostwriters to write any letters expected from Bjorn and because of this, rumours went around that Bjorn was one of the finest letter writers in the land.\u201cWhich family are hosting the picnic tomorrow?\u201dBjorn looked up from the last letter he had read. Mrs Fitz released a sigh and displayed a rather impatient looking expression.\u201cDuke Heine\u2019s household, Your Highness, Princess Louise\u2019s family.\u201d\u201cIts going to be a very long day,\u201d Bjorn said with a little mirth.Mrs Fitz turned with a sigh, she wished she hadn\u2019t bumped into Erna in the hall now. She was going to have to go back to her with disheartening news. No doubt she was going to have that doe eyed look about her, as she expectantly waited on news and a reply from her letter.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Duke Heine\u2019s summer residence was situated amidst the Abit River, distant from the sea, yet renowned for its scenic forests and grassy fields. Bjorn looked at the landscape with calm eyes.He gazed upon the landscape. The Heine family picnic marked the initial event of the social season that he would be attending. An event that he had not been too since the honeymoon with Princess Gladys, that was over five years ago.\u201cBrother,\u201d Louise welcomed him with a smile. \u201cI thought you would never come. It is an honour.\u201d\u201cYou should give thanks to Erna,\u201d Bjorn said, leading his wife before him. \u201cIt was only because my wife had already accepted the invitation.\u201dLouise hardened hearing Bjorn\u2019s words, but conscious of all the judgmental eyes around her, Louise turned to Erna with an amiable smile.\u201cThank you for attending and bringing my brother with you, Grand Duchess.\u201d\u201cNo, I also received a lot of help from you, Princess,\u201d Erna recited the long rehearsed greeting. \u201cI am so grateful that you invited out to such a beautiful pla\u2026\u201dThe words stuck in Erna\u2019s throat as she noticed familiar face.Pavel.As she muttered the name like a sigh, Bjorn and Louise shifted their gaze and noticed where Erna was looking.\u201cAh, I invited him as well. I saw the portraits of the Grand Duke and his wife, I can see that he is very talented painter. So, today I commissioned him to draw our children. Come to think of it, didn\u2019t you say that the Grand Duchess and Pavel Lore share the same home town?\u201d\u201cYes, yes I did,\u201d Bjorn said.Erna looked at Bjorn with nervous eyes. Bjorn didn\u2019t like Pavel. During the last painting session, Erna became acutely aware of the fact. She noticed Bjorn staring at the young man, with the same calm, indifferent expression as he always held.Pavel also spotted them. Suppressing a sudden stomach ache, Erna held her breath and her hands began to tremble slightly. She held onto her parasol as tightly as she could.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Problematic PrinceCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cLook at her, sleeping again,\u201d a small group of gossipers were saying.They had been indulging in various topics of discussion, but always seemed to circle back to Erna Dniester. The Grand Duchess had been entertaining the Heine family children for most of the day and was now sitting in a chair, toy still in hand and eyes closed.\u201cIt\u2019s not been that long since she last disgraced herself at the theatre. If I was her, I would be so embarrassed.\u201d\u201cWhat on earth was she doing last night, to so brazenly fall asleep during the day.\u201d\u201cOh I know, right, I think I can guess though.\u201dThe quiet words of mockery fell away as they drifted out into the bright summer sun. When the Duchess Heine appeared, the chittering whispers fell silent as a matter of course. Despite her deep disapproval of the Grand Duchess, she still needed to maintain a facade of cordiality.\u201cThe Grand Duchess seems to be very tired,\u201d Louise said, as she saw the Grand Duchess slumped in the chair. \u201cShe is weak with worry, I should imagine.\u201dLouise tried to stifle her laughter as those around her watched in anticipation. She was fully aware of the eager curiosity that everyone harboured about the ongoing feud between the Grand Duchess and the Royal Princess, but Louise was resolute in not showing her opinions on the matter.The conversation faltered, people ran out of things to say and so the conversation drifted toward other topics. Louise added a few measured words here and there, but she was waiting for the right moment to approach Erna.\u201cGrand Duche\u2026\u201d\u201cErna\u201dBjorn came in from finishing off a cigar and saw his sister at Erna\u2019s side. He came up with her and called her name too, softly. Erna\u2019s eyes snapped open and the wooden doll she had been holding fell to the ground.\u201cCome on, wake up, let\u2019s go,\u201d Bjorn said.He helped Erna up to her feet, as she groggily looked about the room. Bjorn led Erna away from the shaded canopy where the other guests were gathered and toward a grove of Sycamore trees, where servants had prepared a picnic blanket and a mound of cushions. Bjorn lowered Erna onto the blanket and sat opposite her.\u201cBjorn, should we be alone like this? We have guests,\u201d Erna said.She cast a worried glance back to where Louise sat with her entourage of natters. Erna could not relax, thinking about what those ladies would be saying about her.\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d Bjorn said nonchalantly. He closed his eyes and got comfortable, as if settling in for a nap.Erna hesitated for a moment, but gradually she felt herself begin to calm down again. Seeing Bjorn with his eyes closed made her feel sleepy again, the weight of her eyelids proved to be too much and she was overcome.For a brief moment, Erna\u2019s world vanished into a spiral of shame. When she regained consciousness, she was looking up at the sky just in time to see a kingfisher flit by. She realised she was lying next to Bjorn, they were side by side.As she looked about the amazing scenery, reaffirming her grip on reality, her eyes met Bjorn\u2019s. He chuckled, as he rolled onto his side and delicately placed a hand on her tummy. It was one of his genuine laughs, not the faux presentation he often used to be polite, perfectly polite, but lacking in sincerity.Bjorn brushed a hand through her windswept hair and overwhelmed with a sense of relief, Erna found herself unable to resist the drowsiness once more and before she knew it, her eyes were already closed again.Erna knew she shouldn\u2019t be giving into her drowsiness, but her body simply wouldn\u2019t obey her will. She felt content knowing that she was able to spend the day at Bjorn\u2019s side, the handsome prince who had come to save her.Despite her best efforts to keep her eyes open, to take in Bjorn\u2019s genuine smile once more, she found herself succumbing to lethargy almost like an illness.\u201cRest, Erna,\u201d Bjorn\u2019s voice came through to her softly.The whisper of his voice tickled her ears and she nodded sleepily. She fell into another dreamless sleep.Bjorn lay on her side, stroking Erna\u2019s hair, his own head propped up in his palm. He found it difficult to think of what to do with this woman who lay beside him. He wondered why Erna, who was so self-conscious of what others thought of her, would allow herself to succumb to this drowsiness. Is she sick?The sudden ominous thought crossed his mind and stuck. Bjorn took a deep breath as he studied his wife\u2019s complexion. He noticed that she was looking a little emaciated, despite her cheeks still being full and radiant. Her skin was its normal pale shade and smooth. None of these things seemed like the usual characteristics of a sick person.Bjorn touched his hand to Erna\u2019s forehead and his eyes narrowed in concern. Just then, a servant approached them.\u201cShh,\u201d Bjorn mimed by putting a finger to his lips.Cautiously, Bjorn sat up and with a subtle wink, he motioned for the end of the mat. The servant quickly brought over a thin blanket and with it, Bjorn covered Erna and left her there to rest.He decided to take lead the servant past the meadow of violets, until he reached the edge of the stream, far away from the shade of the tree where Erna lay.\u201cYour Highness, attorney Byle asked to see you, about the Hardy family matter? He said he will wait for you at the pergola, down by the river.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Erna slowly opened her eyes and realised she was alone. The sudden emptiness left by Bjorn\u2019s absence felt immense, causing her to feel like a lost child in a strange and unfamiliar world.She slowly sat up and meticulously folded the blanket that had covered her. Her gaze wandered to the deep, dark parts of the forest she had laid on the edge of and as she sat against a trunk, eating a piece of candy to soothe her stomach, she kept looking into the dark depth of the forest.In the distance, she could hear the muffled laughter of mingled voices. Erna knew she should be getting back to the party, but she wanted to sit and wait for her husband. She couldn\u2019t bear going back to their judgemental stares without him.Another wave of nausea washed over her and so she popped another piece of candy into her mouth.She hated being without Bjorn. Without him by her side, she felt a sense of unease and discomfort, even the sweet taste of the candy couldn\u2019t sooth her. Her mind was filled with anxiety.Stupid Erna.\u00a0She muttered to herselfShe stood up as if she was possessed. The sound of her hasty steps cut across the grass, disturbing the warm sunlit day. She couldn\u2019t help but feel like a child, both laughing at herself and yearning to see Bjorn at the same time.As she approached the sheltered area where the men were lounging around and smoking cigars, she suddenly stopped herself. What if they were talking about Bjorn and she overheard them? She contemplated turning around and just as she was about to walk away, she heard a familiar voice.\u201cThis season is so dull, last year was much better because we had the wonderful Miss Hardy around.\u201dErna paused to listen.\u201cEven if Bjorn wanted to bet again, it would only be for another baby deer.\u201d The voice belonged to Peter Bergen, Erna realised.She also recognised the chittering and laughing voices of Bjorn\u2019s other associates and that\u2019s when she remembered that this time last year, they were all trying to court her and showered her with gifts.Erna hid under the shade of a tree and listened to their vulgar jokes. They hadn\u2019t noticed her presence and she sat, watching the every growing wall of cigar smoke.I must go back.\u00a0Although her consciousness urged her to move, she found that her legs refused to act.\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising, if you think about it. Prince Bjorn, one of the most powerful men in the world, taking his second wife at a poker game. After clearing out all the bets, sweeping up all the prizes and then taking the woman as his trophy.\u201d Peter joked and the others laughed.\u201cIf you think about it, he must have planned it all out. He swooped in, like some shining knight on a white horse, appearing to rescue the damsel in distress. Let\u2019s not forget how handsome he is, how could any woman resist? I can see why Miss Hardy fell for him, or should I say, the Grand Duchess.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite impressive, no?\u201d Peter replied. \u201cEven with all his money and good looks, he put so much effort in winning the stake. There\u2019s a certain charm about someone who values something so deeply, even if it\u2019s just for money, but let\u2019s be real, in the end, he did marry Miss Hardy and spent more money than was ever in the pot. I think he lost, really, he lost big time.\u201d\u201cYou make it sound like Miss Hardy bankrupted him. Do you really think Bjorn Dniester even knows the meaning of deficit? He turned a bet for fun, into winning the most beautiful socialite, winning the stakes on that beauty and eventually even winning his second wife.\u201d\u201cAh, but Bjorn Dniester isn\u2019t the only person to lose money.\u201dErna was taken aback by the casual words of slander. The cigar smoke caught in her throat and she tried to stifle the cough. Covering her mouth with both hands and feeling her heart beat faster, her whole body started to tremble.She missed Bjorn.Erna looked around more earnestly than ever. She knew that her vision was constantly blurring from the tears, but she felt no emotion. She wanted Bjorn to come.Erna, are you okay?\u00a0With those few words, from him, she would be.\u201cOh, over here, our Prince has finally come back to join us.\u201dBefore the evening\u2019s rowing event got under way, the names of the ladies the boars were being named after were called out, accompanied with playful cheers and booing. Erna ignored them all and found the shade of a tree to sit under. That was when Bjorn approached her, her saviour, appearing at the gathering with a warm smile.The young men chatted excitedly and started placing their bets. Bjorn sat down on a ramshackle chair, not at all interested in joining in the childish endeavours, smoking a cigar casually.\u201cHey there trophy hunter, fancy rubbing some of your luck off on me?\u201d Peter said.Bjorn exhaled the cigar smoke with a chuckle.\u201cWhat, why are you ignoring me? Do you think I can\u2019t win or something?\u201dBjorn continued to chuckle, not taking much notice of their jokes and jests.\u201cHey, leave the Grand Duke alone, his luck will be of no use to you. Not even a blind lady would willingly go with your ugly mug.\u201d Leonard jibbed.\u201cCrazy bastards,\u201d Bjorn mumbled, the group rumbled with laughter.Erna covered her mouth to stop her pitiful sobs from breaking free. She looked out to the dark forest through teary eyes. Once their merry laughter faded away to the distance, Erna let out a sigh and the wail she had been holding for a long time.Amidst the gasps and sobs, echoes of retching permeated the air, mingling with the sounds of a wounded beast. Above, the sky remained unblemished and the frightened birds scattered in disarray at the sounds of a woman\u2019s cries.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
